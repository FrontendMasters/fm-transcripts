1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.222
Let's do it, let's start tmuxing,
I feel so excited.

2
00:00:03.222 --> 00:00:08.040
So the first thing we're gonna do is
execute this command, tmux list-sessions.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.406
So go tmux list-sessions, so as long
as you closed down everything properly,

4
00:00:12.406 --> 00:00:14.040
you should see this.

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.098
No server running, there's nothing here,

6
00:00:17.098 --> 00:00:21.044
it's just nothing's happening,
all right, awesome.

7
00:00:21.044 --> 00:00:24.081
And if you actually got excited and
press tmux and you wanted to kill it,

8
00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:26.219
do tmux kill- server,
it'll kill everything.

9
00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:29.970
So just make sure you're in the know,
server running item here.

10
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.935
All right, so let's just do tmux.

11
00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:36.491
I actually jumped ahead and already drew
what happened here, so let's do tmux,

12
00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:38.250
all right, awesome.

13
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.380
And we already did this drawing here,
right, yeah, we did this drawing.

14
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.127
So if I were to execute tmux again,

15
00:00:43.127 --> 00:00:47.122
I think we can probably all guess what
would happen, but let's keep on going.

16
00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:48.254
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

17
00:00:48.254 --> 00:00:49.870
So let's close the terminal.

18
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.867
And when I say close the terminal,
what I want to make sure that you do is

19
00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:59.210
that you don't do Ctrl+D,
literally close the terminal.

20
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.526
So I'm gonna just close it right here.

21
00:01:01.526 --> 00:01:03.050
It's gonna say, hey,
do you wanna close this terminal?

22
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.916
Yes, I've pressed x, it's gone,
there's nothing left.

23
00:01:05.916 --> 00:01:07.430
I'm gonna reopen it back up.

24
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.470
Now I have a brand new terminal open, and
this does not have tmux running right,

25
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.530
it's just a terminal.

26
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.294
I've closed off that previous one.

27
00:01:15.294 --> 00:01:20.970
And we're gonna do this,
tmux a or tmux attach, tmux a.

28
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.543
Notice we went back to our previous
session, so though I close the program,

29
00:01:26.543 --> 00:01:32.128
because tmux runs a server, the server
lived on, the server kept on going.

30
00:01:32.128 --> 00:01:36.379
And now when I tmux a,
I've reattached to that server,

31
00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:40.637
which happens to be in a session,
and I'm on window 1.

32
00:01:40.637 --> 00:01:42.120
All right, awesome.

33
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.850
I don't have to have my
terminal always open, right?

34
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.590
It doesn't have to be open for
things to be running.

35
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.740
I can literally leave it, close it and
never look at it again, right, awesome.

36
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.412
Okay, that's pretty neat,
that's pretty neat, so

37
00:01:55.412 --> 00:01:58.690
let's talk about a little
bit of terminology here.

38
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.344
The prefix key, prefix key is really
important to understand what it is.

39
00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:06.862
So if you are using tmux
with no tmux configuration,

40
00:02:06.862 --> 00:02:11.595
it is 100% likely you have
a prefix key of Ctrl+B.

41
00:02:11.595 --> 00:02:15.270
You press Ctrl+B and
that will be your prefix.

42
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.283
Now, you're probably saying
you keep saying this term,

43
00:02:17.283 --> 00:02:19.710
I don't know what you're trying
to tell me, I don't get it.

44
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.538
Well let me draw up something like this.

45
00:02:21.538 --> 00:02:27.034
So here is tmux server,
here's our terminal.

46
00:02:27.034 --> 00:02:30.450
I press Ctrl+B, well, what happens?

47
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.242
Well, normally what would happen is
this would go into your terminal and

48
00:02:33.242 --> 00:02:36.264
your terminal would interpret it the way,
whatever actions are determined by

49
00:02:36.264 --> 00:02:38.820
your terminal,
since we're using tmux and all this.

50
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.124
Tmux is gonna to take in this key
action here and go, all right,

51
00:02:43.124 --> 00:02:45.084
what key did we just get set?

52
00:02:45.084 --> 00:02:48.382
Let's just say it was Ctrl+B,
our prefix key.

53
00:02:48.382 --> 00:02:51.645
It's gonna say, it's Ctrl+B,
you know what we're gonna do?

54
00:02:51.645 --> 00:02:56.850
We're not gonna send it to the current
active, actual running item underneath.

55
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.903
Instead, we're gonna hold on to this cuz
the next key coming is gonna be a command

56
00:03:00.903 --> 00:03:01.880
for me to do.

57
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.990
So then let's say you press D afterwards,
it's gonna send the D through here.

58
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.453
And when the D goes to the tmux server,
it's gonna go okay,

59
00:03:10.453 --> 00:03:14.404
since we're in command mode,
I'm now gonna perform action D, and

60
00:03:14.404 --> 00:03:17.980
it's gonna look up that action,
perform it for you.

61
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.000
And D does actually have an action.

62
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.843
Whereas if you were to type say just
D by itself without Ctrl+B first or

63
00:03:25.843 --> 00:03:30.143
your prefix key, it would send it to tmux,
tmux would then send it to the active

64
00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:34.210
session which would send it all
the way down to your focused window.

65
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.890
And then D would come out, and look,
here am I, right, you would see it.

66
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.228
And so you don't realize you're sending
it through all this information and

67
00:03:41.228 --> 00:03:44.370
all these things are happening, but
it is what's actually happening.

68
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.008
So there is some level of interpretation
slash caching that happens somewhere

69
00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:51.430
within all these processes you
just don't only realize it.

70
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.710
And your key to changing
it is your prefix.

71
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.056
Now a minus prefix a, why did I choose a?

72
00:03:58.056 --> 00:04:00.792
There's historical reasons,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

73
00:04:00.792 --> 00:04:03.096
I kinda look back at it and
I kinda wish I would have kept B.

74
00:04:03.096 --> 00:04:07.046
I'm actually considering changing it back
to B just so I'm more like all the other

75
00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:11.070
ones, so when I jump on, say someone
else's tmux, it feels fairly comfortable.

76
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.270
I don't have to, I can't use my normal, I
don't wanna have to think about it, right?

77
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.948
It's kinda silly to change
some of these defaults,

78
00:04:16.948 --> 00:04:18.320
I probably should have done that.

79
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.650
But anyways, that is what's
happening with the prefix key.

80
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.060
I wanna make sure you understand that.

81
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.778
So now we have tmux open, I keep
saying this word session/window/pane,

82
00:04:25.778 --> 00:04:28.260
it hasn't quite become clear yet on that.

83
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.799
I've now talked about this prefix key
which is like a command key to be able to

84
00:04:31.799 --> 00:04:33.170
send commands to tmux.

85
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.240
Let's start bringing this all together.

86
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.466
All right, so first, let's come back
here and let's just type in here,

87
00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:40.950
tmux kill-server.

88
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.820
That's just boom, kill tmux, it's gone,
you should be exit back out.

89
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.672
Now you're just back out in your terminal.

90
00:04:46.672 --> 00:04:48.960
Okay, awesome.

91
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.780
Next, let's redo lists sessions again
just to prove it out, tmux list-sessions.

92
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.295
By the way, if you're wondering how I'm
kind of completing things so quickly,

93
00:04:58.295 --> 00:05:01.890
if you have zsh installed, it's kind
of part of zsh's default behavior.

94
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.953
If you start typing and
then you press literally up arrow,

95
00:05:04.953 --> 00:05:08.250
it will complete it based on
your history at that point.

96
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.730
So tmux l, if I press up,
I always usually do tmux list-session.

97
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.537
It'll get it all there for me right away,
so I can just type part of the command and

98
00:05:15.537 --> 00:05:17.665
press up and it'll just jump
through the history like that.

99
00:05:17.665 --> 00:05:18.661
Awesome, okay.

100
00:05:18.661 --> 00:05:21.361
Nothing is running, okay, perfect.

101
00:05:21.361 --> 00:05:25.006
So then let's type in tmux and
let's create this.

102
00:05:25.006 --> 00:05:28.600
So tmux, all right,
we're back in tmux, awesome.

103
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.780
Now let's do that tmux list server again.

104
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.940
Now notice what happens this time,
a little bit different.

105
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.497
Let me kind of walk you through what's
happening cuz there's two things that

106
00:05:37.497 --> 00:05:39.898
are happening right now and
they're both saying the same information,

107
00:05:39.898 --> 00:05:41.720
I just wanna make sure you see it.

108
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.744
One, it says, I am session 0, this little
0 right here, look straight downwards,

109
00:05:47.744 --> 00:05:52.710
you will probably see down here a 0,
meaning hey, this is session 0.

110
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.898
Okay, 0, 0 awesome,
I can see that right here.

111
00:05:55.898 --> 00:05:57.720
Then it says 1 windows.

112
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.900
The first thing you're probably
thinking is wow, pluralization is hard.

113
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.281
Pluralization is really, really hard,
give them a break, okay?

114
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:05.389
It's just windows, why?

115
00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.707
I don't know, and
notice down here mine says 1,

116
00:06:08.707 --> 00:06:11.719
yours probably says 0
if you have no config.

117
00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:15.573
It starts at 0, I hate that word,
starts at 0 then 1, so

118
00:06:15.573 --> 00:06:18.890
I just made it start at 1,
makes more sense.

119
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.262
Then lastly over here, it says attached.

120
00:06:21.262 --> 00:06:25.138
This says hey,
you're attached to this session currently,

121
00:06:25.138 --> 00:06:29.210
which also implies you can
detach from sessions, right?

122
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.996
So that's kind of what is happening
in this little list sessions.

123
00:06:33.996 --> 00:06:38.350
So let's try executing tmux, again, tmux.

124
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.035
Now, if this behaves like this,

125
00:06:40.035 --> 00:06:44.232
I would assume that it's gonna send
a command here, say do I have a server?

126
00:06:44.232 --> 00:06:45.925
I already have a server,

127
00:06:45.925 --> 00:06:50.618
let's create a new session with
a new window with a new pane, right?

128
00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:53.660
That's what we would probably
all think would happen.

129
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.970
So let's do it, tmux, run,
that's not what happens.

130
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:02.490
It's trying to start a new tmux server
in a tmux instance, that's no good.

131
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.523
You cannot do that, I mean, technically
you can, but don't do that, okay?

132
00:07:07.523 --> 00:07:11.240
It's bad news bears, you don't wanna
be a part of it, so don't do that.

133
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.200
It prevents you from doing it,
which is good, awesome.

134
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.957
And the same thing happens if you go tmux
new- session, it will also say, hey,

135
00:07:18.957 --> 00:07:22.150
you cannot nest tmux
sessions in themselves.

136
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.891
It's very confusing, it would be kind of a
bizarre experience to be able to do this,

137
00:07:25.891 --> 00:07:27.950
so it's good that you don't do that.

138
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.358
And so that errors out, but
you know what we can do?

139
00:07:31.358 --> 00:07:35.018
new- session -d, so let's try that again.

140
00:07:35.018 --> 00:07:38.030
Let's try new session but
this time let's put a -d.

141
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.120
Now before I hit Enter,
what do you think is gonna happen?

142
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:47.169
I want you to think to yourself and
try to come up with something, all right?

143
00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:53.813
Did that do what you thought it did,
which is apparently changed nothing?

144
00:07:53.813 --> 00:07:55.327
It didn't give me any errors?

145
00:07:55.327 --> 00:07:56.988
I don't think so.

146
00:07:56.988 --> 00:08:00.450
Well let's do this,
let's do another tmux list-sessions.

147
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:06.223
Now look at what we see,
we are still attached to session 0,

148
00:08:06.223 --> 00:08:10.540
but now there is a session
1 with 1 windows.

149
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.623
We're not even looking at it, but
it does exist, we just don't see it.

150
00:08:13.623 --> 00:08:15.170
All right, what was the question?

151
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:19.240
&gt;&gt; Several people said, detached or
creates a new detach session.

152
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.200
&gt;&gt; Yes, it creates a new detach session,
that is precisely correct.

153
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.570
That is exactly what's happening and
you could see that, right?.

154
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.975
You can definitely see, okay,
I'm still in the same session, but

155
00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:31.280
there is a new session somewhere else.

156
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.980
Now, how do you get to that new session?

157
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:37.080
Well, currently, those are mysteries,
so let's not worry about that quite yet.

158
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.105
All right, navigation tip,
let's worry about that right now.

159
00:08:41.105 --> 00:08:43.752
Now that we've done that,
you can go to the next or

160
00:08:43.752 --> 00:08:45.844
previous session by pressing prefix.

161
00:08:45.844 --> 00:08:49.748
Now remember, yours is likely Ctrl+B,
mine is Ctrl+A, so

162
00:08:49.748 --> 00:08:53.051
I'm gonna go Ctrl+A or
prefix and open bracket, or

163
00:08:53.051 --> 00:08:57.760
open parentheses, the sorta curvy ones,
and it'll go to the next one.

164
00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.099
Notice in here, there's no text, so
now let's do tmux list-sessions again,

165
00:09:03.099 --> 00:09:09.305
you'll see, look, I'm in 1 and I'm
attached to it, you can see the attaching.

166
00:09:09.305 --> 00:09:13.222
All right, I can see these things,
I can, okay, we just moved forward.

167
00:09:13.222 --> 00:09:16.820
So I'm gonna do it again, tmux close
parenthesis, I went back to that one, and

168
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.145
now you can see I can go back and
forth between them.

169
00:09:19.145 --> 00:09:22.156
I can even just press open parenthesis
over and over and over again, and

170
00:09:22.156 --> 00:09:24.127
it's just going back and
forth between them.

171
00:09:24.127 --> 00:09:26.840
Make sure you know how to do that,
that's pretty cool, right?

172
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.450
It's pretty cool, but don't worry.

173
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.682
This feels not that cool.

174
00:09:30.682 --> 00:09:32.177
A, if you don't use
the terminal that much, and

175
00:09:32.177 --> 00:09:33.870
you're like, that's not that cool.

176
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.144
Trust me, it's gonna get a lot better,
this is just,

177
00:09:36.144 --> 00:09:38.230
I wanna make sure you start seeing, okay.

178
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.290
So now you should see, all right, I know
about the server, the server made sense,

179
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.395
but now I see there's actually sessions.

180
00:09:44.395 --> 00:09:48.460
Sessions are different places
where I can put input into, okay.

181
00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.043
You're starting to see it, right,

182
00:09:50.043 --> 00:09:53.740
it's starting to come into
hopefully better understanding.

183
00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:58.915
All right, so let's close the session and
let's create a new session.

184
00:09:58.915 --> 00:10:02.430
So let's go tmux kill-server.
[SOUND] That's too bad.

185
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.388
Let's go tmux new-session, all right.

186
00:10:05.388 --> 00:10:08.910
So now we have a brand new one,
it's just the way it was.

187
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.980
We can go tmux list-sessions
just to look at it.

188
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.500
Notice now we're back down
to only a single session,

189
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.293
we're attached to that one session.

190
00:10:15.293 --> 00:10:18.225
All right, good, we're brand new.

191
00:10:18.225 --> 00:10:21.478
So this time let's close our tmux, but

192
00:10:21.478 --> 00:10:26.420
let's use prefix D instead of
doing Ctrl+D, so prefix D.

193
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:31.350
Remember prefix D will be Ctrl+B D
if you're on an unconfigured tmux,

194
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.720
for me it's Ctrl+A D.

195
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.618
Now notice what happened,

196
00:10:35.618 --> 00:10:40.332
it's like I did tmux kill-server
except it simply said detached.

197
00:10:40.332 --> 00:10:44.980
And when I'm on the outside,
I can do tmux list-sessions.

198
00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.345
And you'll notice that it shows me the
sessions that are currently running, but

199
00:10:48.345 --> 00:10:49.890
nothing has the word attached to it.

200
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:53.970
It's because I'm now detached from tmux,
this really strongly shows

201
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:58.670
the server nature of tmux, how it is
truly two different things right here.

202
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:02.596
And now you can kind of really feel
the difference between tmux sessions and

203
00:11:02.596 --> 00:11:05.130
server, you can kinda see that interplay.

204
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:09.016
I'm trying to draw a picture here and
we can reattach to it with tmux a, or

205
00:11:09.016 --> 00:11:10.689
you can say attach all the way.

206
00:11:10.689 --> 00:11:14.160
If you're kinda more of a,
I like to get force push to master.

207
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.366
I don't like to get push -f, I like to
really get the full words in there.

208
00:11:19.366 --> 00:11:20.811
It feels better, feels more powerful.

209
00:11:20.811 --> 00:11:24.515
And so I'll attach with using the full
spelt out version, there we go,

210
00:11:24.515 --> 00:11:25.395
we're back in.

211
00:11:25.395 --> 00:11:28.786
You can see my previous command that
I executed there a little bit ago.

212
00:11:28.786 --> 00:11:32.146
And if we were to re-execute it,
says the same thing, awesome.
