00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.169
First, there's this
thing's called snippets,

2
00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:07.940
I am sure most of you have used some
form of snippets in vscode, right?

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.525
We're gonna just do a quick example,
I know they're available in IntelliJ,

4
00:00:11.525 --> 00:00:15.610
vscode, emacs, vim, they're all over
the place, you can definitely use these.

5
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.174
So if I were to come in here and just type
in the word, function foo and do this.

6
00:00:20.174 --> 00:00:23.659
I could type all of that in there,
took me a little bit of time, or

7
00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.903
I could just type in fn and
use this little snippet program.

8
00:00:26.903 --> 00:00:30.670
And then go foo, hit tab I don't
want any of those, hit tab.

9
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.950
And then there you go, I'm now in
the body and I can start typing.

10
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.470
Snippets, they're pretty cool, right?

11
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.265
They're pretty neat, but for the most
part, I actually don't really like

12
00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:43.359
snippets too much, they're great for
learning a language.

13
00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.401
Hey, I wanna do a for loop and go, and I
don't really know how to do a for loop and

14
00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:50.219
go, type in for, look for
the snippet auto complete,

15
00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.968
use that as a method of learning.

16
00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:53.358
Great but it's not,

17
00:00:53.358 --> 00:00:57.926
I feel snippets are just simply
a stepping stone to something better.

18
00:00:57.926 --> 00:01:02.022
Ultimately I do think there is
something better,it's not available for

19
00:01:02.022 --> 00:01:06.240
everybody and I think it's coming and
I think we're all gonna use it.

20
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.086
I think by 2024 there will be most
developers using some form of this,

21
00:01:10.086 --> 00:01:14.262
I know that's a pretty big guess,
two years, maybe it's gonna be five years.

22
00:01:14.262 --> 00:01:15.699
But of course, what is it?

23
00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:20.024
It is gonna be GitHub Copilot, I think
something like a GitHub Copilot is gonna

24
00:01:20.024 --> 00:01:24.101
be a part of every person's job being
able to do AI assisted programming.

25
00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:26.562
And if you haven't had the time
to use it or even look at it,

26
00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:28.900
we're gonna take a brief
little look at it right now.

27
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.973
So I'm gonna actually just touch a file
in here, let's call it, make-a-game,

28
00:01:32.973 --> 00:01:36.450
I'm gonna do something really simple,
and ts, there we go.

29
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.660
And let's go over here, just to kinda make
it easy, type script is its best language.

30
00:01:41.703 --> 00:01:44.942
Gosh, I agree to these
additional telemetry.

31
00:01:44.942 --> 00:01:47.490
My goodness, my goodness.

32
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.760
Not a fan of telemetry but hey,
some people like giving all

33
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.460
their information to other people, so
GitHub Copilot right here, ready to rock.

34
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.566
For those that don't know
anything about GitHub Copilot,

35
00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:01.495
it uses the entirety of GitHub,
scans through things.

36
00:02:01.495 --> 00:02:06.316
It uses another, that open AI,
Codex, whatever it's called,

37
00:02:06.316 --> 00:02:11.577
to kind of generate this smart item to
be able to give you suggestions and

38
00:02:11.577 --> 00:02:15.012
some of the suggestions
are pretty dang good.

39
00:02:15.012 --> 00:02:19.627
Actually here, this is what I was doing,
create a matrix, let's see a translation

40
00:02:19.627 --> 00:02:23.144
matrice, I wanted to do something
that was a little bit easier.

41
00:02:23.144 --> 00:02:29.696
Translation matrice
homogenous four by four.

42
00:02:29.696 --> 00:02:34.122
Function, createTranslationMatrix.

43
00:02:34.122 --> 00:02:36.593
There you go, there we go,
we got a createTranslationMatrix,

44
00:02:36.593 --> 00:02:38.654
it's obviously doing
something a little bit goofy,

45
00:02:38.654 --> 00:02:40.787
it's putting the values over
here as opposed to here.

46
00:02:40.787 --> 00:02:42.245
It has a rotation in the matrix but

47
00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:44.601
it's able to generate these
things pretty quickly.

48
00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:49.408
And you can kind of, you know,
okay now we gotta create that mat4 class.

49
00:02:49.408 --> 00:02:57.155
Create mat4 class, From values.

50
00:03:01.461 --> 00:03:05.070
Yeah, that's exactly how
we used it elsewhere.

51
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.237
And there we go.

52
00:03:10.135 --> 00:03:11.191
And there we go.

53
00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:15.838
It effectively worked,
now we just gotta create the constructor.

54
00:03:15.838 --> 00:03:21.087
It's kind of interesting how it's doing
this, notice how it's kind of programming.

55
00:03:21.087 --> 00:03:25.814
It definitely did exactly what it said it
was going to do, just a little bit goofy.

56
00:03:25.814 --> 00:03:27.189
How do you wanna do this?

57
00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:28.290
How do you wanna do this?

58
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.910
What a funny way it did it.

59
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.390
It's obviously not that great.

60
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.355
You can see that it's doing things in kind
of a really goofy not very great matrice

61
00:03:36.355 --> 00:03:40.146
way, but nonetheless, it's actually
attempting to create these things on

62
00:03:40.146 --> 00:03:43.660
the fly and eventually you'll
actually get something that works.

63
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.403
I was able to make a couple games that
worked fairly successfully like this and

64
00:03:47.403 --> 00:03:50.670
so this is really where I think
the future will ultimately go.

65
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.239
Right now it's like a toy.

66
00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.007
You use it, it fails all the time, but
it's only gonna keep on getting better and

67
00:03:57.007 --> 00:03:58.212
better and better.

68
00:03:58.212 --> 00:04:01.809
And I do think one day it will be quite
incredible because you're gonna be typing,

69
00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:05.461
it's gonna be able to A, understand your
project which there's a lot of questions

70
00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:09.187
about, do private companies want GitHub
to understand the project, blah, blah?

71
00:04:09.187 --> 00:04:11.767
But barring all those things aside,
ultimately,

72
00:04:11.767 --> 00:04:14.767
if this thing can make really great like,
hey, by the way,

73
00:04:14.767 --> 00:04:18.607
this code already exists in this one spot,
you would have never known that.

74
00:04:18.607 --> 00:04:22.040
You would have created duplicate code,
it's gonna be able to spot so

75
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.896
many things that just tools
aren't easily able to spot.

76
00:04:24.896 --> 00:04:28.000
And I do think one day this
will be really incredible.

77
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.438
Right now it's kind of in its infancy,
It's in its technical preview.

78
00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:34.070
Sometimes it's awesome,
sometimes it's ridiculous.

79
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.705
Sometimes you can get it to say funny
things like, tell me a joke, and

80
00:04:37.705 --> 00:04:40.540
then it's gonna come in here and
say, tell me a joke.

81
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.633
And what are you gonna do?

82
00:04:41.633 --> 00:04:43.421
Knock knock, who's there?

83
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:44.447
Java, Java who?

84
00:04:44.447 --> 00:04:47.050
Java, it's me, look at that,
how great is that?

85
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.520
How great is that knock knock joke?

86
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.990
It just gave me a joke right then and
there using alert boxes but

87
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.680
nonetheless, I find this thing
to be pretty interesting.

88
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.288
It gives you a whole new perspective
on how some things could be done and

89
00:04:59.288 --> 00:05:00.952
some things are really useful.

90
00:05:00.952 --> 00:05:04.924
Things that have really concrete values
that you know probably exists a lot out

91
00:05:04.924 --> 00:05:06.940
there they can do really quickly.

92
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.257
Some things,
it doesn't do very good right now.

93
00:05:09.257 --> 00:05:13.289
Create a rotational, watch,
matrix, there we go.

94
00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.889
Create rotation matrix and it's gonna
do all these nice little things,

95
00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.606
I don't even know where
it's going right now.

96
00:05:20.343 --> 00:05:21.624
Let's see where it goes, does it?

97
00:05:21.624 --> 00:05:25.116
Let's undo this because
it's obviously bad.

98
00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:30.181
Four by four homogenous, there we go.

99
00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:31.220
Let's see if we can get it to do that.

100
00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:37.018
All right, yes, yes, yes.

101
00:05:37.018 --> 00:05:40.593
Do it, my goodness that is
looking potentially incorrect.

102
00:05:40.593 --> 00:05:42.267
This is looking very incorrect,
interesting.

103
00:05:42.267 --> 00:05:43.775
So that time I couldn't do it,

104
00:05:43.775 --> 00:05:47.495
I've actually written a few programs
that have got it completely correct.

105
00:05:47.495 --> 00:05:52.445
It just is a really funny thing right
now because it's so untapped right now,

106
00:05:52.445 --> 00:05:57.091
but I do think that there's gonna be
a moment within the next couple years

107
00:05:57.091 --> 00:05:59.852
that we are all using
some version of this.

108
00:05:59.852 --> 00:06:03.508
And I do think it's significantly
better than snippets,

109
00:06:03.508 --> 00:06:06.128
because snippets only allow for so much.

110
00:06:06.128 --> 00:06:08.234
You can look through the suggestions.

111
00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:11.882
You can look through all the suggestions,
I was just taking the first one but

112
00:06:11.882 --> 00:06:14.909
nonetheless it's actually rather
incredible what it can do.

113
00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:17.989
I mean, the fact that it can
even get to that point for

114
00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:20.514
me is already just an amazing experience.

115
00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:26.350
I don't know what it's going to be like,
but I do know a lot of people always

116
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.503
worry, I hear a bunch like, hey,
is Copilot gonna take our jobs?

117
00:06:29.503 --> 00:06:31.705
I don't think Copilot's
gonna take people's jobs.

118
00:06:31.705 --> 00:06:35.371
But I think people who know how to
use Copilot in the next couple years

119
00:06:35.371 --> 00:06:37.430
are gonna be sought after engineers,

120
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.603
people that know how to take
advantage of these new tools.

121
00:06:40.603 --> 00:06:44.053
Because you're just gonna be able to
generate a lot of things that can kinda

122
00:06:44.053 --> 00:06:45.158
self heal themselves.

123
00:06:45.158 --> 00:06:49.532
These AIs, these robots, as they get more
and more experience, they're just gonna

124
00:06:49.532 --> 00:06:53.170
know how to do things better faster
than we will ever be able to do.

125
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.827
You could have a million line codebase and
say a summing function already exists,

126
00:06:56.827 --> 00:06:58.050
but you couldn't find it.

127
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.131
You could imagine that you'd start
typing the code, it's like, hey,

128
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:03.202
already exists here,
go check this out, jump,

129
00:07:03.202 --> 00:07:05.850
boom, you just import it,
then it just knows all the things.

130
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.358
And the skill gap is definitely,
so someone's mentioning skill gap,

131
00:07:10.358 --> 00:07:13.672
I think skill gap is gonna
become very interesting.

132
00:07:13.672 --> 00:07:16.769
Because the faster and
better you're able to use these tools,

133
00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:19.995
I think it's gonna greatly change
what type of engineer you are.

134
00:07:19.995 --> 00:07:23.659
And so I'm not someone that likes to
reject cool new technologies just because

135
00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:26.447
they're, I mean,
obviously this example kind of stunk.

136
00:07:26.447 --> 00:07:29.046
I did this literally last week and
it was spot on.

137
00:07:29.046 --> 00:07:32.652
It was so ridiculous to the point where
even when it was comparing input,

138
00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:34.081
it was like player one wins.

139
00:07:34.081 --> 00:07:37.278
I was like, correct is like
Player Two Wins, is that correct?

140
00:07:37.278 --> 00:07:40.867
Then it did an L statement, I'm like,
all right, it's doing an L statement,

141
00:07:40.867 --> 00:07:44.257
it was like, it's a tie and I never put
anything in there about doing a tie.

142
00:07:44.257 --> 00:07:48.280
It knew from all the other stuff that it
could put in a tie, it was incredible.

143
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.212
It's very hard to make this thing
always work consistently but

144
00:07:51.212 --> 00:07:53.656
I do think that there's a lot of room for
this thing.

145
00:07:53.656 --> 00:07:56.900
It's gonna be really cool, I'm very
excited about it at least, minimally
