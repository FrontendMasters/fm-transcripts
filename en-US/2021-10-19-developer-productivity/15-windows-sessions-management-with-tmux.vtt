WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.570
I know, is moving slowly but
it's also moving awesome.

2
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.310
So hopefully you're like,
okay, okay, I feel things.

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:05.950
I feel and I'm kind of excited.

4
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.874
So let's create a bunch of windows for
a quick more or let's create a bunch of,

5
00:00:10.874 --> 00:00:14.700
let's see Han, oopsies,
create a bunch of sessions here.

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.334
I don't know why it says
create a bunch of windows,

7
00:00:16.334 --> 00:00:18.437
I got confused cuz we're only
talking about sessions right now.

8
00:00:18.437 --> 00:00:22.378
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna go
tmux, new-session with that little d.

9
00:00:22.378 --> 00:00:24.940
And then I'm gonna do it a bunch of times,
right?

10
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.800
And now, we're gonna use this little
navigation tip right here, prefix w.

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.590
Now, prefix w will show you a kinda
list of all of your sessions in Windows.

12
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.938
Now notice that there's one window
per every single session, and

13
00:00:41.938 --> 00:00:43.760
I can just walk through them.

14
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.344
Look at me, I'm going up and down.

15
00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:48.496
This is pretty inconvenient form of
traveling through your windows and

16
00:00:48.496 --> 00:00:51.030
sessions, but you could,
I'm going through them all.

17
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.637
Awesome, look at that,
I could go select this one,

18
00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:56.180
I'm in a completely different one.

19
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.220
I am number 1.

20
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.388
And so after doing that,
I can do that little w, and

21
00:01:00.388 --> 00:01:03.277
you can actually see right in here,
you can see command I not found.

22
00:01:03.277 --> 00:01:06.239
That was the last command,
if I zoom it out a little bit,

23
00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:09.230
you can see I am number 1
as the last command there.

24
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.542
Whereas this one shows all those ones,

25
00:01:10.542 --> 00:01:12.700
you can kinda get a little preview
window of what's happening.

26
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.858
I'm really zoomed in for
everyone looking so

27
00:01:14.858 --> 00:01:17.640
you don't get to have as
nearly as much viewing.

28
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.250
And so then these ones are all blank.

29
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.140
I can kind of walk through
all these different ones.

30
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.880
Awesome, I can see all
the different sessions, great.

31
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.510
Now, we can do a little killing
of each one of those servers,

32
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.680
remember Ctrl+D is end of file, prefix D
is tmux attached, very, very different.

33
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.080
So if I'm in here and I do Ctrl+D,
it obviously kicks me out of tmux.

34
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.979
If I just simply do prefix D,
it just backs out, and

35
00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.770
let's say I'm attached the tmux.

36
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.574
If I just type in tmux detach,
it's the exact same thing as Ctrl+D.

37
00:01:49.574 --> 00:01:52.729
So you can see, this is highly scriptable.

38
00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.627
You could actually kick people out
of tmux sessions if you wanted to.

39
00:01:56.627 --> 00:02:00.125
So let's do a little tmux kill server
again, if you followed along and

40
00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:01.650
made a bunch of servers.

41
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.860
Let's clean everything up.

42
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.169
Let's start again, start again.

43
00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:09.125
So, obviously it's very difficult still, I
haven't really talked a lot about windows

44
00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:13.814
and panes, but it's kind of hard to see
the difference between all these sessions,

45
00:02:13.814 --> 00:02:14.958
windows and panes.

46
00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.537
And so even with that exploded view
where you could walk through each one,

47
00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:21.320
you'd have to walk to each one and
then look at the input.

48
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.370
Not very convenient but
it is a way you could do it.

49
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.220
So let's start talking about the windows.

50
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.580
Obviously, that's kind of the next
thing we need to talk about.

51
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.389
So I already did this,
we already cleaned it up,

52
00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:36.920
you can execute it again just to really
assert your domination over tmux here.

53
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.150
You will make it kill the server twice.

54
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.450
So let's create a new window.

55
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.900
So first let's do tmux, awesome.

56
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.460
We're exactly what we've done many,
many times here.

57
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.940
List session, you can see it,
one windows attached.

58
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.620
Now let's do this, tmux new window.

59
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.290
Now Enter, look at what happened.

60
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.700
Did anyone see what just happened there?

61
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.040
Hopefully what you saw is that all
the input on the screen went away.

62
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.980
But what you really should have
been looking at is right here.

63
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.610
Now notice what it says,
session zero has window 1 and window 2.

64
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.200
So now hopefully you're starting
to understand what windows are.

65
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.320
Now it's starting to kinda
make a little bit more sense.

66
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.140
Just like a server can have many sessions,
a session can have many windows,

67
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.870
it's the same principle effectively again.

68
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.910
I mean, they're effectively
identical to each other.

69
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.360
This operation tmux new-window is
identical to you pressing prefix c.

70
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.280
So let's do that right now.

71
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.800
I'm gonna go prefix c, prefix c, prefix c,
you can just see that number going up.

72
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.456
I'm on windows seven now at this point, I
have a bunch of different windows just by

73
00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:45.370
pressing prefix c, or for
you likely Ctrl+B, C.

74
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.030
And that makes sense, prefix create is
how I kinda say it in my head, awesome.

75
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.730
Now if you wanna navigate around to these,
you have a couple of options.

76
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.830
You can do prefix p to walk backwards,
you can watch my little asterisk.

77
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.798
Now it's on 5,
it's gonna go to 4, 3, 2, 1, or

78
00:04:02.798 --> 00:04:05.780
I can press prefix n for next.

79
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.377
So much like how you transfer sessions
using prefix open and closed parentheses,

80
00:04:10.377 --> 00:04:15.870
whatever they're called, parentheses yeah,
you can use p and n to do it on windows.

81
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.378
Or what makes it a little bit easier,
let me zoom it out a little bit,

82
00:04:18.378 --> 00:04:19.880
I can also just press the window number.

83
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.168
So prefix one will take me to window one.

84
00:04:22.168 --> 00:04:26.970
Prefix two will take me to two,
prefix seven will take me all the way over

85
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.820
to seven, you can see my little
asterisk right there, there we go.

86
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.700
So now I'm jumping to the window I
want by just pressing its number.

87
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.773
Awesome and
when I press Ctrl+D to close it,

88
00:04:38.773 --> 00:04:41.250
it happens a little differently this time.

89
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.033
Before when I press Ctrl+D,

90
00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:46.954
it would not only kill my window
which would thus kill my session,

91
00:04:46.954 --> 00:04:51.611
which would thus kick me out of tmux even
if there was other sessions to be had.

92
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:55.710
This one it will close the window but
it will go to my previous window so

93
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.600
I just pressed it, I killed seven,
I'm over here on two.

94
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.870
I call these things usefulness tips.

95
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.854
I didn't know really what to call it,
but a session should contain like items.

96
00:05:05.854 --> 00:05:09.107
So if you have a project that
requires two terminal things running,

97
00:05:09.107 --> 00:05:12.660
have your product, just have a session
with those two things in it.

98
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.308
This will become more clear as we
kind of extend to tmux further, but

99
00:05:16.308 --> 00:05:19.074
you should really just try
to contain like things.

100
00:05:19.074 --> 00:05:22.200
For a long time,
I'd have a single session and

101
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.220
I'd have it auto populate all my
projects the exact way I wanted them.

102
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.642
And though this was really useful,
I just found myself scrolling too much,

103
00:05:30.642 --> 00:05:32.430
I didn't really like it as much.

104
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.595
I've kind of evolved since then and
went, okay,

105
00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:37.440
I'm gonna find a better way
to navigate my sessions.

106
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.930
And thus all my projects can have
as many windows as they want, but

107
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.160
I will know exactly how to navigate them.

108
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.700
So sometimes you do want to ask this
question, who does number 2 work for?

109
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.750
It's a very important
question to be asked.

110
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.139
And you don't know, because you're
just looking at these windows,

111
00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:57.700
none of them are making sense.

112
00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.320
There's just a bunch
of numbers by them and

113
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.880
all the sessions this just have
a bunch of numbers by them.

114
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.490
So let's try something
a little bit different.

115
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.710
Let's go back here and go tmux.

116
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.360
Now I'm currently in the second window of
my first session, let me zoom back in.

117
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.759
I'm gonna go new session, now remember
we need to do dash d for detach.

118
00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:17.780
Now I'm gonna go like this,
dash s and I'm gonna give it a name.

119
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.690
Let's give it the name, foo.

120
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.900
So now when I press Enter,
I created the session, detached.

121
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.310
Let's press prefix w
to look at everything,

122
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.010
here's our first session with six windows.

123
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.549
And then we have our second session,
it's named foo, it's not named one,

124
00:06:34.549 --> 00:06:36.620
it's named foo as a single window.

125
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.700
Now when I open it, instead of saying
the number one right here, it says foo.

126
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.910
I can start naming my sessions,
this is really, really good.

127
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.990
And this is kinda where things
get a lot more exciting.

128
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.290
And you'll see why here shortly.

129
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.840
And so now they're a little bit
more meaningful, little bit easier.

130
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.280
And you can do the exact
same thing with windows.

131
00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:04.060
I can go tmux new window, and
then I can give it a name, foofoo.

132
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.380
And now look,
window number 2 is named foofoo.

133
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.820
I can actually give them
the names that I want.

134
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.976
You can even create a tmux new session.

135
00:07:12.976 --> 00:07:16.408
And you can also give the initial
name to the first window, so

136
00:07:16.408 --> 00:07:18.845
that way you don't have something silly.

137
00:07:18.845 --> 00:07:21.764
Let's call this one bar, there we go,
let's bring this back up.

138
00:07:21.764 --> 00:07:25.282
And you'll notice that if we go to bar,
bar has one windows and

139
00:07:25.282 --> 00:07:27.480
its windows' name is aoeuaoeu.

140
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.970
Which of course is the first
four characters of Dvorak.

141
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:34.380
By the way I used the Dvorak,
have I by the way that one yet?

142
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.855
All right, it's good to know,
got always by the way people.

143
00:07:36.855 --> 00:07:39.832
So we're back here,
this is awesome, usability tip and

144
00:07:39.832 --> 00:07:42.270
really this is not just a usability tip.

145
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.340
This is actually something
that's pretty exciting.

146
00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.020
Let's jump back here and
go like this, new session.

147
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.370
Let's just re execute this,
duplicate session bar.

148
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.721
So hopefully, right away your little
programmer brain's going, okay, okay,

149
00:07:54.721 --> 00:07:57.720
we can do something special
with session names.

150
00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.950
They're like key values, I can now access
kind of a map of things that are running.

151
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.238
Very important to remember that,
put that up here for now.

152
00:08:06.238 --> 00:08:09.500
So obviously sessions cannot have
the same name, very, very good.

153
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.879
There are pains, I don't like them,
I personally like to say pains or

154
00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:15.260
pain in the ass.

155
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.580
I just am not a huge fan of them,
but I will say this much,

156
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.800
you can open them pretty easily.

157
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.610
Prefix percent sign will
split your window in half.

158
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:25.910
So look at what I just did here.

159
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.102
So I'm in window foofoo, but
I actually have two things running.

160
00:08:29.102 --> 00:08:32.062
So I have already have this
setup inside my tmux RC

161
00:08:32.062 --> 00:08:34.081
to do this is I can press prefix h,

162
00:08:34.081 --> 00:08:39.380
prefix l to walk between these two,
vim command, vim movements, right there.

163
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.740
And so
I can actually walk between the splits.

164
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.928
And I can be over here and
I can walk over here and do this for

165
00:08:44.928 --> 00:08:48.132
people that like that split lifestyle,
which I don't.

166
00:08:48.132 --> 00:08:52.327
You can have it right here, me, not so
much for me, so if I press Ctrl+D,

167
00:08:52.327 --> 00:08:54.046
it'll get rid of one of them.

168
00:08:54.046 --> 00:08:55.622
I'm still in window foofoo.

169
00:08:55.622 --> 00:09:00.261
I haven't changed at all,
I just had multiple splits there or panes.

170
00:09:00.261 --> 00:09:01.893
So hopefully at this point,

171
00:09:01.893 --> 00:09:06.245
this whole notion of server window pane
makes a lot more sense at this point,

172
00:09:06.245 --> 00:09:09.856
because you saw that I had a single
window with multiple panes.

173
00:09:09.856 --> 00:09:15.210
And panes really were the thing
that are running the shell.

174
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.335
This is two shell instances side
by side in a single window,

175
00:09:18.335 --> 00:09:21.250
the window being what is
being displayed right here.

176
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.480
It is my terminal.

177
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.103
And then of course it lives
within the session foo,

178
00:09:25.103 --> 00:09:27.120
which is one of many sessions.

179
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.363
I think at this point it's
probably a good idea to say, hey,

180
00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:36.010
is there any questions kind of
about tmux in its basicness?

181
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.775
I just wanna make sure that we
don't have any confusion out there.

182
00:09:38.775 --> 00:09:42.002
And ultimately, I think what is really
important is that, if you have a question,

183
00:09:42.002 --> 00:09:43.490
somebody else has the same question.

184
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.536
They're just not willing to ask it, so,
ask it now and we can just get it over

185
00:09:47.536 --> 00:09:51.980
with, and hopefully this little diagram I
have right here makes a lot of sense now.

186
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.224
When I first showed it to you,
probably made no sense.

187
00:09:55.224 --> 00:09:58.886
Now you're like, okay, I get it, maybe
I don't remember all the keys I have to

188
00:09:58.886 --> 00:10:01.693
press, I don't remember all
the commands I have to type in.

189
00:10:01.693 --> 00:10:04.811
But I get the idea and
that's the ultimate goal here.

190
00:10:04.811 --> 00:10:06.571
But now here's the question,

191
00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:10.295
I gotta ask this question cuz
remember we want to solve problems,

192
00:10:10.295 --> 00:10:14.310
I don't want to show you technology for
the mere sake that it's neat.

193
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.120
I'm not into neat technology,
I'm into useful technology.

194
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.186
And I wanna be really specific about that.

195
00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:21.710
We got a question, William, what is it?

196
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.522
&gt;&gt; Two questions actually,

197
00:10:23.522 --> 00:10:28.141
when would you ever use windows
in TeamHooks if you're using i3?

198
00:10:28.141 --> 00:10:30.020
&gt;&gt; So that's a good question.

199
00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.580
So I mean,
that's kinda the reason why I don't,

200
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.780
some people like things side by side.

201
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.301
And the reality, for
those that don't know when he said i3,

202
00:10:38.301 --> 00:10:40.270
he's talking about the window manager.

203
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.561
So here let me close that,

204
00:10:41.561 --> 00:10:44.960
I can actually just open up two
windows side by side right here.

205
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.620
And look at that,
they're kind of next to each other.

206
00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.080
Personally, I don't use splits.

207
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.174
So I don't have a strong answer for
why you would ever want to use splits,

208
00:10:52.174 --> 00:10:54.170
let alone why would you
use one over the other?

209
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:59.950
I personally would rather use
i3 to do a split than tmux.

210
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:04.736
But tmux also has a lot of really
great programmaticness to it that's

211
00:11:04.736 --> 00:11:05.900
really simple.

212
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.486
And so I think you could probably do
cooler things with tmux with less

213
00:11:10.486 --> 00:11:12.663
effort than you could with i3.

214
00:11:12.663 --> 00:11:18.520
At least as far as my experience goes,
i3 is not as beginner friendly as tmux is.

215
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:23.000
Tmux is fairly beginner friendly, it has
a lot of easy pass, a lot of cool plugins,

216
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.520
that just kind of work.

217
00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.399
Here's one of the things, never mind,
I don't wanna show quiet,

218
00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:31.430
I almost got ahead of myself,
I get so just excited.

219
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.400
But yes, I virtually don't use splits for
anything.

220
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.064
My whole life has been driven around
trying to create navigation which I don't

221
00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:39.350
need splits to begin with.

222
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:42.244
So I'm probably not the best person
honestly to ask that question,

223
00:11:42.244 --> 00:11:45.341
I'm sure someone else would probably
have a much better answer than me,

224
00:11:45.341 --> 00:11:47.430
why someone would or
would not want splits.

225
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:52.130
Cuz even when I'm copying code and
doing that, I don't still use splits.

226
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.890
I still hop between two windows really,
really fast.

227
00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.610
So anyways, my question really, wait,
you had a second question, William.

228
00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.080
What's the second question?

229
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:06.265
&gt;&gt; So the other question I had is
when you have named sessions or

230
00:12:06.265 --> 00:12:11.881
windows, is there an easy way to
jump to it by name like a search?

231
00:12:11.881 --> 00:12:16.100
&gt;&gt; I love that question,
and here's the answer.

232
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.102
Absolutely, and it's so
good that right after this,

233
00:12:20.102 --> 00:12:25.790
we're gonna make some things in tmux
that are gonna be pretty awesome.

234
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:29.301
And so I wanted to first just kinda set
up that and I'm very happy you asked that

235
00:12:29.301 --> 00:12:32.320
question cuz that's exactly
what you should be thinking.

236
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.883
You saw that you can't have
duplicate session names,

237
00:12:34.883 --> 00:12:37.446
that should immediately
trigger in your head, okay,

238
00:12:37.446 --> 00:12:40.470
there's some sort of programmatic
nature to this whole thing.
