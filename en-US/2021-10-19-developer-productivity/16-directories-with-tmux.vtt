1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.500
And then lastly,
of course let me ask this question.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.640
Have we solved this problem?

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.920
Really, have we solved it?

4
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.928
The answer should be no,
we haven't solved it.

5
00:00:12.928 --> 00:00:17.555
Cuz really when I have to press prefix
W and like scroll through all these.

6
00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:19.600
Are we still playing where's Waldo?

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.110
Yes, we are.

8
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.120
But now we're playing in a linear fashion
which is almost worse than any other way.

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.426
So I think that in some sense we've
actually made the problem a little

10
00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:28.540
bit worse.

11
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.019
maybe a little bit more visible, a little
easier to see what you're looking for, but

12
00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:34.210
nonetheless, I think it's a little worse,
right?

13
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.310
It's not what I want.

14
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.168
I don't want the heartburn cortisol,

15
00:00:37.168 --> 00:00:39.990
inducing moment that I'm sitting
right here on my screen.

16
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.350
I just want a nice Tmux.

17
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.540
Nice simple terminal experience.

18
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.590
So we're gonna take it to the next level.

19
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.670
Yes, once again, I am an artist.

20
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.890
I can draw lines that
are incredibly straight.

21
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.240
I'd even see one person comment on how
beautifully straight this line is.

22
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.920
I'm a little hurt.

23
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.960
I'm not gonna lie to you.

24
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.350
I expected at least a few praises
of line straightness there.

25
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.670
That's freehand okay?

26
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.180
Free hand.

27
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.873
All right, let's create a this [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; It's very nice.

28
00:01:06.873 --> 00:01:07.604
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

29
00:01:07.604 --> 00:01:08.392
Thank you everybody.

30
00:01:08.392 --> 00:01:11.750
I trained many years Juilliard.

31
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.972
So I'm gonna talk about what I want to
do or how I would solve this problem,

32
00:01:17.972 --> 00:01:19.040
particularly.

33
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.019
This is how I think about the problem is
that I have three places in which code

34
00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:25.120
may exist.

35
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.340
I have it in my home directory, right?

36
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.120
I have my dot files repo right
because that's where store is.

37
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.880
That's where I store into my home folder.

38
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.970
So therefore I have a folder on my
home directory called Dot files.

39
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.760
I also have my Ansible folder there.

40
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.860
Then on top of that,
I have personal, right?

41
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.257
Personal is kind of where I have all my
personal projects because, I dont know,

42
00:01:43.257 --> 00:01:44.630
I call them personal why not?

43
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.205
It feels right okay, and
that's also right off my home directory.

44
00:01:48.205 --> 00:01:51.435
Then on top of that,
I also have my work directory.

45
00:01:51.435 --> 00:01:53.827
Now I did mix work with pleasure or
personal actually,

46
00:01:53.827 --> 00:01:57.265
they're both on the same machine, but
nonetheless, they're right there.

47
00:01:57.265 --> 00:02:01.725
So these are really the three places
in which I want to navigate to quickly.

48
00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:04.765
Anything else could be a little bit
smaller blades, E prime can use a lot.

49
00:02:04.765 --> 00:02:09.145
Let's see I just self promoted.

50
00:02:09.145 --> 00:02:10.250
Where is that?

51
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.150
Is a 9.
I'm still out.

52
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.950
I don't even know where
that can you read that.

53
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.790
I don't even know where zoom is.

54
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.420
Zoom is somewhere.

55
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.185
So instead of comment, something about
me even being a better GIMP user,

56
00:02:21.185 --> 00:02:22.310
I'm very excited.

57
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.690
I'd like to know this GIMP tip.

58
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.259
All right, so
this is kind of an idea right here.

59
00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:30.340
Every one of these folders that exist
right here, every one of these folders

60
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.782
that exists at each one of these
levels are likely a git project or

61
00:02:33.782 --> 00:02:36.950
a folder I want to navigate
to as quickly as possible.

62
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.690
Obviously, I don't wanna navigate to
somewhere really deep in here, right?

63
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.360
I don't need to go to the node
module folder somewhere deep down.

64
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.800
Nodes module nodes module that weird
thing that happens with node modules.

65
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.280
Like those are the folders that
I'm super concerned about.

66
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.820
Right?

67
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.842
Those are the places I want
to get to immediately.

68
00:02:53.842 --> 00:02:58.104
And on top of it I love fuzzy finding for
those that don't know what fcf or fuzzy

69
00:02:58.104 --> 00:03:02.600
finding Fcf is a specific fuzzy finder
it just stands for fuzzy finding right?

70
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.170
A Fuzzy Finder.

71
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.001
If you don't know what that is, or

72
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:08.726
the best way to kind of say it is that
have you ever used Ctrl p in VS code if

73
00:03:08.726 --> 00:03:12.706
that's more familiar to you Ctrl P brings
up all of your like files right and

74
00:03:12.706 --> 00:03:16.860
you can start typing and it finds
the file with a few keystrokes, right?

75
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.926
That's a fuzzy finder.

76
00:03:17.926 --> 00:03:20.447
It means you can type a partial
match to a string and

77
00:03:20.447 --> 00:03:23.710
return to you all the strings
in some sort of sorted order.

78
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.470
That makes sense.

79
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.330
FCF has a lot of options,
blah, blah, blah.

80
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.780
But it's just a fuzzy finder, it's good
to know this is very, very good to know.

81
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.028
All right, so I want to be able
to take these two things and

82
00:03:35.028 --> 00:03:38.850
I want to be able to create a Tmux
experience out of them right?

83
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.692
I want to take all these folders right
here, and I wanna be able to navigate to

84
00:03:42.692 --> 00:03:45.860
them instantly and
I want to filter them by FCF.

85
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.462
So that is what I want to create and
we're gonna create that right now,

86
00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:54.480
because I want better,
faster, smoother navigation.

87
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.320
All right, that seems about right, right?

88
00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.360
So we do know a command, right?

89
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.770
We did walk through this command earlier.

90
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.990
We can create a session and
we can name it, we can detach it.

91
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.260
Awesome, right?

92
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.110
It's beautiful.

93
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.720
It's exactly what we want.

94
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.475
But did you know, I know, my goodness,
you can create a new session and

95
00:04:13.475 --> 00:04:18.180
you can even say, hey, this is
the directory I want you to go to, right?

96
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.820
So we can actually even tell it
what directory to go to with -c.

97
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.150
We can create a new window with
a directory it should go to.

98
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.770
And we can also call switch client switch
client will switch to a new client and

99
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.270
it uses this -t parameter.

100
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.192
Now the -t parameter, it will put it on
switch client what it would effectively

101
00:04:39.192 --> 00:04:42.640
it does,
it allows you to put in a session name.

102
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.638
Now I only ever use session name but
you can even go further and

103
00:04:47.638 --> 00:04:50.870
do window name and pain number.

104
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.210
So you can really give it like
a really targeted string to jump to.

105
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.515
And so if you name your Windows as well,
you could even like fuzzy find into that

106
00:04:59.515 --> 00:05:03.495
you could list your sessions and then
fuzzy find the cross it and jump in if

107
00:05:03.495 --> 00:05:07.960
you have really well named session in
Windows schemes, it's pretty darn cool.

108
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.670
But I tend to just do session name foobar,
right.

109
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.773
So right now just kind of show it to you
there's bar that's one of the sessions

110
00:05:16.773 --> 00:05:17.310
name is bar.

111
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.700
So we're in food,
right now so I can go Tmux.

112
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.230
Switch client, no,
I didn't spell that right at all.

113
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.480
And then do T and go foo right?

114
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.160
And by doing that, we are currently
in foo, I thought I was in bar.

115
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.638
So now instead tricking you guys making
sure you're paying attention and

116
00:05:33.638 --> 00:05:35.950
we press bar and we jump over to bar.

117
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.780
So look at that,
I programmatically switched sessions.

118
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.080
So we were like, okay.

119
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.610
We have a lot of the tools here to
create this style of navigation, right?

120
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.992
We know that there's commands that exist,
that we can do this with,

121
00:05:48.992 --> 00:05:51.561
we know what folders we want to do it, and

122
00:05:51.561 --> 00:05:55.135
we know that we want to fuzzy
finder to be able to help us.

123
00:05:55.135 --> 00:05:57.790
So there's like kind of a lot
of things going on here.

124
00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.517
And lastly, there's another command
that I have right here that I,

125
00:06:00.517 --> 00:06:01.560
we don't need this time.

126
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.698
But we're gonna need pretty near or

127
00:06:03.698 --> 00:06:07.920
you may want soon is you can also
include a command right here.

128
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.136
So not only can you create a new window
with a name, you can also say hey,

129
00:06:12.136 --> 00:06:13.980
run node js whatever, right?

130
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.840
So you can actually tell
it to do something.

131
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.160
And lastly,
always read the friendly manual.

132
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.888
I believe that's what that
abbreviation stands for

133
00:06:22.888 --> 00:06:25.280
RTFM always read the friendly manual.

134
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.090
It's very important to do that.

135
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.380
And so man tmux actually has a lot
of information inside of it.

136
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.551
If you're not familiar with man,
which stands for

137
00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:37.510
manual do man it will tell you
actually how to read a manual.

138
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.973
And what it means, what each one of
these numbers mean along with it,

139
00:06:40.973 --> 00:06:44.449
it'll even tell you like,
bold means type it exactly as shown.

140
00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:46.241
Okay.
So let's go back to tmux man,

141
00:06:46.241 --> 00:06:47.160
look at that.

142
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.420
This means type it exactly like this tmux.

143
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.081
It actually gives you a lot of information
and once you read through the man's

144
00:06:53.081 --> 00:06:56.080
manual, it makes a lot more
sense reading manual pages.

145
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.951
They're actually they're very, nice and

146
00:06:57.951 --> 00:07:01.180
T mux is is particularly nice because
it has like everything in it.

147
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.060
You're confused at how
switch client works.

148
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.150
Well here you go.

149
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.070
Here's every single option, all of it.

150
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.880
Here's the alias that it's also known by,
here's everything that can possibly do.

151
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.540
It's very, very nice to learn these
commands using this little manual page.

152
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.100
Always recommend reading
the friendly manual
