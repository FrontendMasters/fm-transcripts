00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
Now the terminal, this is my jam, okay?

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.881
This is where I feel
I've spent more time in.

3
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:09.146
Obviously not enough time, but
definitely more of my time is spent here.

4
00:00:09.146 --> 00:00:12.020
Vim is where I've spent all my time,
right?

5
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.004
Then I spent more time playing around
with terminal stuff and then less for

6
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:17.038
everything else.

7
00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:19.749
And so this is,
I find this to be super sad.

8
00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.037
No, where we're not talking
about Vim today, I get it, okay?

9
00:00:22.037 --> 00:00:25.628
I know I want to, I wanna tell you
about our lord and savior Vim, but

10
00:00:25.628 --> 00:00:27.630
I'm not gonna do that today, okay?

11
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.528
And so just to be upfront,
I use xterm and tmux.

12
00:00:31.528 --> 00:00:35.807
Xterm is really old,
it's just your basic terminal

13
00:00:35.807 --> 00:00:40.196
emulator that comes on a lot of systems,
easy to use.

14
00:00:40.196 --> 00:00:42.581
There's also GNOME Terminal,
I just use the old stuff.

15
00:00:42.581 --> 00:00:44.817
I don't want any of the new fancy stuff.

16
00:00:44.817 --> 00:00:47.932
I don't need it,
they tend to be slower at rendering.

17
00:00:47.932 --> 00:00:50.281
I just want simple, right?

18
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:52.796
I just want simple, straightforward,
and of course, tmux.

19
00:00:52.796 --> 00:00:56.726
And tmux is really incredible, not just
because it's incredible by itself.

20
00:00:56.726 --> 00:00:59.924
But it also works on,
you can use it on your Windows,

21
00:00:59.924 --> 00:01:03.141
you can use it on Mac OS X,
and you can use it on Linux.

22
00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:07.116
And the best part is, is that once you
have an RC setup and the way you like

23
00:01:07.116 --> 00:01:11.117
to use it, you get to use tmux on all
three of those systems the same way.

24
00:01:11.117 --> 00:01:13.823
For me that is just a huge selling point,
right?

25
00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:16.675
I just want a similar uniform experience.

26
00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:20.433
I know at some point in my future
I'm gonna have to use a Mac and

27
00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:23.700
it's gonna happen and
I'm gonna shed my Mac tears.

28
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.945
And then I'm gonna have to set up my
system and I'll just use tmux, and

29
00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:29.322
I'll be a happy camper anyway,
so it'll be fine.

30
00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:31.616
And really the problem we're
trying to solve is this one.

31
00:01:31.616 --> 00:01:36.175
Now, this one, I swear I already
feel my cortisol going up.

32
00:01:36.175 --> 00:01:38.067
I used to be this, I kid you not,

33
00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:42.007
I was definitely 100% this person
at one point in my lifetime.

34
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:47.589
So many terminals, so many things,
it was just stressing me out all the time.

35
00:01:47.589 --> 00:01:48.814
So we're gonna get started.

36
00:01:48.814 --> 00:01:51.166
This is where really the fun starts.

37
00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:53.860
Now, if I'm not, let's see,
yeah, a little story about me.

38
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.691
I did wanna put this in here.

39
00:01:57.691 --> 00:01:58.660
When I was younger,

40
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.032
you remember that job I told you about
where they said what about grep?

41
00:02:02.032 --> 00:02:03.513
I had to use a lot of terminals.

42
00:02:03.513 --> 00:02:07.474
The first time I ever had to use
a terminal ever in a professional

43
00:02:07.474 --> 00:02:12.729
environment, we used GAE, Google App
Engine back then, we also had AWS, right?

44
00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:16.118
And then there's a lot of stuff you
had to set up inside the terminal.

45
00:02:16.118 --> 00:02:19.112
And I'd have iTerm2 and
I'd have 15 tabs, and

46
00:02:19.112 --> 00:02:23.266
every time I need to find something,
[SOUND] it was always so painful.

47
00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:26.841
And then I had an intern, I was a tech
lead for one of these things, and I had

48
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:30.966
an intern and I remember he was just like
yeah, I just use bash for these things.

49
00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:34.543
And I remember thinking bash is such
a stupid language, it's just so

50
00:02:34.543 --> 00:02:37.021
annoying to write,
it's impossible to read.

51
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:38.567
It really is impossible to read, though.

52
00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:41.533
And I just like,
why would you ever use it?

53
00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:44.708
And he's just like, yeah, cuz it just
works on every computer in the world,

54
00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:45.458
it's fantastic.

55
00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:50.128
And I remember going, yeah,
I mean, this guy has a point here.

56
00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:52.680
And so, that kind of helped
lead me further down this road,

57
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.044
that one simple interaction like hey,
you know what?

58
00:02:55.044 --> 00:02:58.970
Maybe I have opinions about
things I really don't understand.

59
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.897
Maybe I should take
a little bit more time.

60
00:03:00.897 --> 00:03:03.314
And my love of the terminal and
of the shell and

61
00:03:03.314 --> 00:03:07.638
all those things of that lifestyle grew
from that point, which is really funny,

62
00:03:07.638 --> 00:03:09.370
I don't even think he knows it.

63
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.200
I'm not gonna be recommending any of
the new terminal emulators, like I said,

64
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.442
xterm, it was developed in 1984, okay?

65
00:03:15.442 --> 00:03:17.699
It's older than me, which is fantastic.

66
00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:22.901
But we all know the moment you mention
a terminal emulator, what happens?

67
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.516
This guy comes in,
he needs to tell you about Alacritty.

68
00:03:25.516 --> 00:03:27.233
Alacritty, the greatest terminal ever.

69
00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:29.954
It's written in Rust, so
you already know it's fantastic, right?

70
00:03:29.954 --> 00:03:33.228
If anything's written in Rust, it's
already better than the previous version.

71
00:03:33.228 --> 00:03:36.577
But here's the thing,
the moment you mention Alacritty, too bad,

72
00:03:36.577 --> 00:03:40.677
Alacritty guy, there's actually the Kitty
guy that comes out and goes no, Kitty,

73
00:03:40.677 --> 00:03:42.546
Kitty is the greatest terminal ever.

74
00:03:42.546 --> 00:03:46.561
I have never had a conversation ever on
the Internet that does not devolve into

75
00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:49.482
Kitty versus Alacritty when
terminals are brought up.

76
00:03:49.482 --> 00:03:51.915
So that's why I've stayed out of it,

77
00:03:51.915 --> 00:03:55.803
I'm on something from generations ago,
it's fantastic.

78
00:03:55.803 --> 00:04:00.488
So we're really gonna focus really
in to multiplexing your terminal

79
00:04:00.488 --> 00:04:05.022
experience to solve that problem
that we've showed you earlier.

80
00:04:05.022 --> 00:04:08.648
But really to,
what I call that harpoon navigation style,

81
00:04:08.648 --> 00:04:13.083
to really be able to get to where you
want to be as fast as you possibly can.

82
00:04:13.083 --> 00:04:17.605
You stop having all this navigation woes,
all the different terminals open, or

83
00:04:17.605 --> 00:04:21.077
the control tab going through
each one of the different tabs.

84
00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:25.846
You don't wanna live that, you don't
want that, I don't want that for you,

85
00:04:25.846 --> 00:04:29.469
you don't want that for you,
let's fix that, all right?

86
00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.899
And so we can kinda get started now,

87
00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:35.470
really into the technical
part of the next section.
