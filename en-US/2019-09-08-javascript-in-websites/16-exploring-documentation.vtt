1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.662
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're gonna look
here at this little tab called API,

2
00:00:03.662 --> 00:00:07.454
which stands for
application programming interface, or

3
00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:11.344
maybe I'm making that up,
you should probably look it up.

4
00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:15.693
Anyway, API, API basically means
this is how you interact with it.

5
00:00:15.693 --> 00:00:16.312
Right?

6
00:00:16.312 --> 00:00:18.992
Here's all the knobs and switches and

7
00:00:18.992 --> 00:00:23.189
buttons you can press on it to
get it to do different things.

8
00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.982
So here you can see you
have Swiper Parameters.

9
00:00:26.982 --> 00:00:31.176
This is all the stuff
I'm passing into swiper.

10
00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:35.561
So you can see here like we
have the speed with height,

11
00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:38.690
like there's a lot of things in here.

12
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.342
But like, this one is kinda fun.

13
00:00:40.342 --> 00:00:42.770
Let's mess around with effect here for
a second.

14
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.658
So, I'm gonna go back to gallery or
Swiper gallery, rather.

15
00:00:49.658 --> 00:00:50.820
So we got Luna there.

16
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.679
And I'm gonna come back to my My Gallery.

17
00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.646
I'm going to add one more thing
here that's gonna be effect.

18
00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:02.980
And let's just go look at
all the effects can be,

19
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.861
they have slide, fade,
cube, covered flow or flip.

20
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:13.317
Flip sounds fun, so
I'm going to put flip there.

21
00:01:13.317 --> 00:01:14.224
Okay?

22
00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:18.016
Now I'm going to come back over
to my gallery here and refresh.

23
00:01:18.016 --> 00:01:19.615
Now try hitting your arrow.

24
00:01:24.115 --> 00:01:29.587
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you can kind of
mess with it a little bit, right?

25
00:01:29.587 --> 00:01:31.548
When does it change?

26
00:01:31.548 --> 00:01:32.912
Right there.

27
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.360
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's pretty cool, right?

28
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.988
Or one of them was cube, I think.

29
00:01:38.988 --> 00:01:44.595
Let's go look at the slide,
fade, cube, let's try cube.

30
00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.363
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, notice there's
a little drop shadow down there now, and

31
00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:55.544
if I hit the arrow, so again,

32
00:01:55.544 --> 00:01:59.752
really cool stuff that I
didn't necessarily have to do.

33
00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:05.160
Someone else went through and bothered to
do this, but it's a really cool effect.

34
00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.825
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And fade,
as well, it's one of them.

35
00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:19.060
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then you can kinda
go back and forth between the two.

36
00:02:22.368 --> 00:02:24.210
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's one of
them you can mess around with!

37
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.470
Let's go back to slide,
cuz we're gonna keep working with that.

38
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.701
Another one that was on here was,

39
00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:39.870
swiping, no swiping.

40
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.180
Like you can disable it, you can re-enable
it, you can say, I don't want them to be

41
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.760
able to just slide, like, just to
each photo, I want them to be able to

42
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.638
slide in between, and not have to like
snap to a grid or anything like that.

43
00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:56.583
This has just an amazing amount of things,
one of them that Mark was showing

44
00:02:56.583 --> 00:03:00.526
you was break points you can show and
hide certain amounts.

45
00:03:00.526 --> 00:03:05.123
So the one that I actually wanna
show you is slides per view.

46
00:03:05.123 --> 00:03:06.375
Slides per view, that one.

47
00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:11.259
So, over here, I'm going to
put slides per view instead of

48
00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:16.451
having just one that's the default,
I'm going to put three.

49
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:21.391
Okay, so now that I have that,
I'm going to come back over here and

50
00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:23.168
I'm going to refresh.

51
00:03:23.168 --> 00:03:24.684
And now I have three other pictures.

52
00:03:24.684 --> 00:03:28.179
If I slide,
it's going to just do one at a time.

53
00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:32.656
And the images are kind of cut off, so I'd
have to tool around with that eventually,

54
00:03:32.656 --> 00:03:35.828
until I was happy with how it
was showing and hiding things.

55
00:03:35.828 --> 00:03:39.681
But, nonetheless,
that's pretty cool too, right?

56
00:03:44.917 --> 00:03:48.324
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And last one I was
gonna show here has an auto advance of

57
00:03:48.324 --> 00:03:49.096
some sort.

58
00:03:54.788 --> 00:03:55.902
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Touches.

59
00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.732
I don't care about touching.

60
00:03:57.732 --> 00:03:59.400
Free mode progress.

61
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.025
So you can have it loop as well.

62
00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:05.970
So if I put like loop,
when it got to the end, it would go back,

63
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.801
you would be able to go indefinitely.

64
00:04:15.098 --> 00:04:17.318
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And death,
there's other things as well.

65
00:04:17.318 --> 00:04:23.586
So, put loop:true, there as well,
see what happens with that.

66
00:04:23.586 --> 00:04:28.055
So, now if I go back,
it will take me back to the end, right?

67
00:04:28.055 --> 00:04:32.231
Or if I go all the way through it,
it will loop back around as well.

68
00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:37.127
So bunch of stuff

69
00:04:37.127 --> 00:04:42.378
you can do there.

70
00:04:42.378 --> 00:04:44.223
Questions about that?

71
00:04:44.223 --> 00:04:44.815
Yeah?

72
00:04:44.815 --> 00:04:47.524
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, so I really want
my buttons to not be all the way

73
00:04:47.524 --> 00:04:51.415
over on the side, the edges of the page,
I want them to be like on the image.

74
00:04:51.415 --> 00:04:51.968
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mm-hm.

75
00:04:51.968 --> 00:04:58.479
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I couldn't see anything
obvious in the API that would change that.

76
00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.786
How do you know if you wanna do something,
if it's like in the API, or

77
00:05:02.786 --> 00:05:06.746
it's something you have to change
in your own HTML versus CSS.

78
00:05:06.746 --> 00:05:11.090
Is there a good rule of thumb, or you
just have to search through the API and

79
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.365
try to figure it out?

80
00:05:12.365 --> 00:05:14.087
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's kind of
going to be more of what it is.

81
00:05:14.087 --> 00:05:15.734
There's not a good rule of thumb.

82
00:05:15.734 --> 00:05:18.156
In that case, I can almost
guarantee you it's going to be,

83
00:05:18.156 --> 00:05:20.346
you're going to have to write
the CSS that does that.

84
00:05:20.346 --> 00:05:24.689
I didn't see anything in
here about button options.

85
00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:25.316
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

86
00:05:25.316 --> 00:05:29.788
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that probably, to me
means, I'm gonna have to do it myself.

87
00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:34.301
So I gave it these swipe or
button previous and next.

88
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:36.243
This gives it the style
that it has right now.

89
00:05:36.243 --> 00:05:40.710
I can totally take these out and
just put them like next and prev.

90
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.630
And as long as those matched
what was here in my gallery,

91
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.064
so I'd have to change this to be next and
prev.

92
00:05:46.064 --> 00:05:51.955
This would have no style,
right, from the library.

93
00:05:51.955 --> 00:05:56.095
Then I would get to write all the styles,
right?

94
00:05:56.095 --> 00:05:57.895
And then you could do whatever
you wanted to do with it.

95
00:05:57.895 --> 00:06:01.017
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Would that still
let us use Swiper, though?

96
00:06:01.017 --> 00:06:04.113
Cuz I thought you had to call
them swiper-button-prev.

97
00:06:04.113 --> 00:06:05.185
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You don't have to.

98
00:06:05.185 --> 00:06:08.627
So here you're telling us these
are the navigation buttons.

99
00:06:08.627 --> 00:06:11.248
And so it'll add event
listeners on those for you.

100
00:06:11.248 --> 00:06:12.735
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay, that's what that does.

101
00:06:12.735 --> 00:06:14.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's all that does.

102
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.749
And then all the styling was coming
from the CSS that we brought in.

103
00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:21.288
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

104
00:06:21.288 --> 00:06:24.190
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Does that make sense?

105
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.185
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yes, it's [CROSSTALK]-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

106
00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:26.742
then you can do whatever you want.

107
00:06:26.742 --> 00:06:31.950
I suppose that just comes from intuition
of working with a lot of libraries.

108
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.255
Nothing said that to you.

109
00:06:36.255 --> 00:06:40.992
So I don't know if I have anything
more comforting to tell you than that.

110
00:06:46.212 --> 00:06:49.356
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, like what I would
do is, I'd look through is, like,

111
00:06:49.356 --> 00:06:52.131
look, they have components here and
I would not see,

112
00:06:52.131 --> 00:06:54.490
I don't see anything
in here about buttons.

113
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.990
So to that means, like,
if you wanna change how it looks,

114
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.044
you're gonna probably
have to do it yourself.

115
00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:01.472
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: But
I couldn't change those into buttons,

116
00:07:01.472 --> 00:07:04.566
because they have to be divs in order for
Swiper to work?

117
00:07:04.566 --> 00:07:08.911
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't think so.

118
00:07:08.911 --> 00:07:10.152
So if I did this, so

119
00:07:10.152 --> 00:07:14.354
all Swiper is gonna do is it's
gonna end event listener on that.

120
00:07:14.354 --> 00:07:17.531
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Which is what
navigation nextL and prevL does.

121
00:07:17.531 --> 00:07:18.211
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Exactly.

122
00:07:18.211 --> 00:07:19.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.
