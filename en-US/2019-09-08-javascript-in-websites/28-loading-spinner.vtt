00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.956
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There is other ones you can
do, I think I've pulled up a CodePen here,

2
00:00:04.956 --> 00:00:05.970
some others.

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.274
These are the things that people
have done that are loading spinners,

4
00:00:09.274 --> 00:00:11.971
that are just kind of fun to
see how they did them with CSS.

5
00:00:16.806 --> 00:00:18.552
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I haven't
looked at this one at all, so.

6
00:00:20.118 --> 00:00:23.119
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: These are quite advanced,
so I don't expect you to know how to

7
00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.350
do things like this, that would
take me a very long time, in fact,

8
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.158
I'm not even sure if I could do that.

9
00:00:31.796 --> 00:00:35.803
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But,
cool stuff nonetheless, right?

10
00:00:35.803 --> 00:00:40.372
But what's cool about that, look,
this person used zero JavaScript for that,

11
00:00:40.372 --> 00:00:42.465
this is all just done when using CSS.

12
00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:48.820
Now granted, that's about 150 lines of
CSS to do just that, but pretty cool.

13
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.254
If I was gonna do a loading spinner for
this, the first thing if

14
00:00:52.254 --> 00:00:56.746
someone called addDoggo, I'm just gonna
put pseudo code in here, I would say,

15
00:00:56.746 --> 00:00:59.874
first thing I would do is
show loading spinner, right?

16
00:00:59.874 --> 00:01:01.574
As soon as someone clicks the button,

17
00:01:01.574 --> 00:01:03.817
that's when you wanna
show the loading spinner.

18
00:01:03.817 --> 00:01:07.174
When do I stop showing
the loading spinner?

19
00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:15.667
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here,
stop showing loading spinner, right?

20
00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:19.588
As soon as it's done requesting,
and it's being placed in the DOM,

21
00:01:19.588 --> 00:01:22.169
then we're gonna show the loading spinner.

22
00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:24.452
Now, if you wanna go
even one step further,

23
00:01:24.452 --> 00:01:27.839
which you don't have to,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But

24
00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:30.891
as soon as this loads, and
then you append the image to the DOM,

25
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:34.416
that's actually when it was going to
begin to load the picture, right?

26
00:01:34.416 --> 00:01:38.970
Because you get the URL back from the API,
and then you add the image tag to the DOM,

27
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.079
and then at that point it's
going to request the photo.

28
00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.476
That's also not instantaneous, right?

29
00:01:44.476 --> 00:01:47.102
So, if you stop showing
the spinner right now,

30
00:01:47.102 --> 00:01:50.911
you're gonna have a bit of a gap
between when you get the data back from

31
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:54.669
the API and when the image actually loads,
that makes sense to you?

32
00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:57.849
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Why would that
be the case if you're stopping

33
00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:02.374
showing the loading spinner
after you've appended the image?

34
00:02:02.374 --> 00:02:06.193
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, let's take
a look at this, if we go back and

35
00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:08.682
look at mine, wherever it is.

36
00:02:10.928 --> 00:02:13.868
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so this page,
notice as soon as I click it,

37
00:02:13.868 --> 00:02:18.917
there's going to be a one, just very small
second, it's gonna show me the alt text.

38
00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:23.911
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Because it appends
that image to the DOM, and

39
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:26.720
that image has not yet loaded, right?

40
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.292
So it actually has to go out and
get this URL right there,

41
00:02:30.292 --> 00:02:33.867
it has to go request that from
the server and get it back.

42
00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:39.785
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's something to be
aware of, there's ways to mitigate that,

43
00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:42.928
but for now let's just,
expect that to happen for now.

44
00:02:48.216 --> 00:02:49.818
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

45
00:02:49.818 --> 00:02:54.479
I do explain how to do it in there,
if you want to, feel free.

46
00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:57.446
Do that definitely,
as the very last thing that you do.
