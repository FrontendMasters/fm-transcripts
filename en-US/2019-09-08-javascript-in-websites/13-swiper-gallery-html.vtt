00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.342
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So first thing we have
to do, is we're gonna create a div.

2
00:00:03.342 --> 00:00:05.607
And its class is gonna be,
swiper dash container.

3
00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:11.238
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And these are class
names that Swiper chose, so

4
00:00:11.238 --> 00:00:12.849
you actually have to
use these class names,

5
00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:14.692
cuz that's what Swiper's
gonna be looking for.

6
00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:21.689
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then we're gonna do
div class equals Swiper dash wrapper.

7
00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.862
Wrapper.

8
00:00:24.862 --> 00:00:30.400
And then inside of swiper dash wrapper,
we're gonna have a bunch of slides.

9
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.962
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It is all in the Frontend
Master's website in the notes.

10
00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:36.792
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
that would be an easier way of doing this.

11
00:00:36.792 --> 00:00:37.292
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

12
00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:42.509
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's like I wrote this or
something.

13
00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:43.302
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Almost.

14
00:00:43.302 --> 00:00:46.439
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
that is an easy way of doing it.

15
00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:51.334
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so
let's just grab all of these.

16
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:56.748
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

17
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.056
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that all it does,

18
00:01:08.056 --> 00:01:12.730
is a bunch of Swiper slides with image
tags inside of them with one through 12.

19
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:19.736
Now, I create a new director, so I'm gonna
have to go copy over my images, right?

20
00:01:19.736 --> 00:01:21.647
Otherwise, it won't be
able to find those images.

21
00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:25.195
So I'm gonna open 12 to there.

22
00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:30.423
And I'm gonna copy over images, and
that the CSS is largely the same too.

23
00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:34.649
So I'm going to just,
do I even need the CSS, whatever,

24
00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.038
we'll copy off our CSS as well.

25
00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:41.781
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I did was from
our previous project gallery,

26
00:01:41.781 --> 00:01:45.529
I moved into gallery to the images, so
that we have all the Luna pictures, and

27
00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:48.142
then the previous styles that
we had on there as well.

28
00:01:51.975 --> 00:01:54.598
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now inside of gallery
two there's an images directory,

29
00:01:54.598 --> 00:01:55.810
was tall pictures of Luna.

30
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.882
There's an index HTML which
we just wrote together, and

31
00:01:58.882 --> 00:02:03.174
there's a style that's at CSS, which is
all the styles from our last project.

32
00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:06.895
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: By the way,
I do this all the time,

33
00:02:06.895 --> 00:02:09.322
I cannibalize code from
previous projects all the time.

34
00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:13.272
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's no shame
to do it or I'm shameless,

35
00:02:13.272 --> 00:02:14.830
I haven't decided which it is.

36
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.232
So now, we're gonna come up here into
the head, cuz we're just putting our CSS.

37
00:02:20.232 --> 00:02:24.434
So I'm gonna say link, and
I'm going to link my styles.CSS.

38
00:02:24.434 --> 00:02:28.681
Now this is key, notice that I put my
style sheet after their style sheet.

39
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:34.522
And you should do the same as well, the
order actually is important here, right?

40
00:02:34.522 --> 00:02:38.723
Because you want your code to be,
your CSS to be parsed and run last,

41
00:02:38.723 --> 00:02:43.472
because if it conflicts with their code,
you want your code to win, right.

42
00:02:43.472 --> 00:02:46.286
You want all of their stuff to
do whatever it's doing, but

43
00:02:46.286 --> 00:02:50.034
if you want your code to do something
different, you'll want that ability.

44
00:02:50.034 --> 00:02:52.973
So here with the CSS,
make sure you're putting yours second.

45
00:02:56.794 --> 00:02:58.690
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then down here at the bottom,

46
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.409
we're gonna also include
our own JavaScript.

47
00:03:04.423 --> 00:03:08.775
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
we're gonna say, script, and

48
00:03:08.775 --> 00:03:14.585
say src=./, well, we'll just call this.

49
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.343
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, I guess my dash
gallery or something like that.

50
00:03:27.441 --> 00:03:27.976
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Same thing here.

51
00:03:27.976 --> 00:03:31.560
And next, it's even more important for
the JavaScript.

52
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.856
If I put this above here,
what happens if I try and refer to Swiper?

53
00:03:36.856 --> 00:03:41.083
It's not gonna be available,
because Swiper is loaded here.

54
00:03:41.083 --> 00:03:45.653
So if I try and use Swiper up here,
it's gonna not know what that is.

55
00:03:45.653 --> 00:03:50.569
However, if I put it below it, Swiper
will be loaded before this gets run.

56
00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.933
So then it will be available to run.

57
00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:54.919
Make sense?

58
00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:59.944
So make sure that your JavaScript
comes after the Swiper JavaScript.
