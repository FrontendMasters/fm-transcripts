00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.293
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cuz I want you to go into
your portfolios that you engine built, and

2
00:00:04.293 --> 00:00:06.219
add something interactive.

3
00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:09.593
Something you can add a swipe or
gallery of images,

4
00:00:09.593 --> 00:00:12.966
you can go write your own
image gallery like we did,

5
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:18.087
you can go add some sort of thing we did
up here with dragging the puppy around.

6
00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:20.921
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That is up to you.
But

7
00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:24.801
I wanna see what kind of
creative stuff you come up with.

8
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:25.912
So I'm just gonna show you that,

9
00:00:25.912 --> 00:00:27.663
this doesn't necessarily
even have to be an emoji.

10
00:00:27.663 --> 00:00:35.020
So I dropped an image in there as well,
that we can really quick.

11
00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:43.387
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if you have some sort of
lpersonal image or something like that,

12
00:00:43.387 --> 00:00:48.107
that you like,
instead of having a puppy here,

13
00:00:48.107 --> 00:00:54.361
I'm gonna put an image and
class equals brand alt equals logo,

14
00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:58.609
and source equals .slash images slash and

15
00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.396
there's a bH KPMG in there, as well.

16
00:01:07.492 --> 00:01:12.128
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
then here's I'll save that, and

17
00:01:12.128 --> 00:01:17.130
I'm gonna go in here to the gala or
styles .CSS,

18
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.254
and here I'm gonna add
just a couple more things,

19
00:01:22.254 --> 00:01:24.944
background color white.

20
00:01:24.944 --> 00:01:30.012
Border radius, 50%, width,

21
00:01:30.012 --> 00:01:35.604
75 pixels, height, 75 pixels,

22
00:01:35.604 --> 00:01:42.620
border, one pixel solid, something 777.

23
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.128
Nice gray color.

24
00:01:45.867 --> 00:01:49.861
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so now if I come back
over here, hopefully, if I refresh that,

25
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:53.044
you can see here,
that actually put my image up there and

26
00:01:53.044 --> 00:01:54.634
it's still drag and drop.

27
00:01:54.634 --> 00:01:55.182
All right?
So

28
00:01:55.182 --> 00:01:56.870
that doesn't actually matter what that is.

29
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.601
You can put whatever
you want them to there.

30
00:02:03.546 --> 00:02:05.460
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now that actually
looks more like a portfolio,

31
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.250
rather than just somewhat
obsessed with docs.

32
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.709
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is true, but

33
00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.627
now I don't want to be
that upfront about that.

34
00:02:12.886 --> 00:02:14.030
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about that?

35
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.910
So anything can be draggable.

36
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.301
Right, any sort of HTML element
that you feel putting up there.

37
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:20.860
You could make that drag-able and
drop-able.

38
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.182
So hopefully you got
your ideas flowing for

39
00:02:24.182 --> 00:02:28.250
what sort of things you
wanna put onto your website.
