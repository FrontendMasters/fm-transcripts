00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.018
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just as touch on
what's actually going on here.

2
00:00:02.018 --> 00:00:06.991
We don't actually have to incredibly
in depth understand everything that's

3
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:07.981
going on here.

4
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:12.960
Some of this is just like listen is
a function that come from popmotion.

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.898
And I'm not gonna dive in and
figure out all the ins and outs of it.

6
00:00:16.898 --> 00:00:19.119
As long as it works the way
that I expected to,

7
00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.930
I'm pretty well okay leaving
that as mostly a black box.

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.165
But for your purposes, I did dig in and
figure out what this actually does.

9
00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:35.886
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And so listen is just
basically, it's like an event listener.

10
00:00:35.886 --> 00:00:37.600
It's saying, listen for events on this.

11
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.960
It's listening for mousedown, right,
which is the beginning of a click, right?

12
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.508
mouseup here is the end of a click.

13
00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:46.137
And as you might imagine, touchstart and
touchend is, if I'm on a phone,

14
00:00:46.137 --> 00:00:48.686
as soon as I put my thumb down,
that's touchstart.

15
00:00:48.686 --> 00:00:51.500
And as soon as I take my thumb off,
that's touchend.

16
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.590
In fact, you can simulate that
in your browser if you want to.

17
00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:57.308
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's do that.

18
00:00:57.308 --> 00:01:02.536
Let's move this to the side,
dock to the right.

19
00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:04.873
Okay, I have this little thing up here.

20
00:01:04.873 --> 00:01:07.054
And Chrome has one that looks
really similar to that, but

21
00:01:07.054 --> 00:01:08.745
it looks like two phones
next to each other.

22
00:01:10.394 --> 00:01:12.049
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
then I can make this look like a,

23
00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:17.049
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's go with iPhone XS or

24
00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.509
something like that.

25
00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.859
So now this is relative to
the same form factor as an iPhone.

26
00:01:24.754 --> 00:01:28.842
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And so now,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's not even working with

27
00:01:28.842 --> 00:01:30.478
the touch events, that's interesting.

28
00:01:30.478 --> 00:01:31.676
Is this working?

29
00:01:34.735 --> 00:01:37.450
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So it's not a necessarily
perfect one-to-one emulation.

30
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.890
But it is a good way as like, I wonder
what this looks like on an iPhone, right?

31
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.480
Or if I click on this, it's like, I wonder
what it looks like in portrait mode.

32
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.034
So you can see here, our site
doesn't work super great on phones.

33
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.256
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Not too bad,
in portrait mode, anyway.

34
00:01:53.256 --> 00:01:56.637
But that's really useful if you don't
wanna necessarily pull up everything on

35
00:01:56.637 --> 00:01:58.458
your phone and get all that stuff working.

36
00:01:58.458 --> 00:02:00.284
This is a nice shortcut to
get all that stuff working.

37
00:02:00.284 --> 00:02:06.475
And I just have to click
that again to get it out.

38
00:02:06.475 --> 00:02:11.866
I thought some people might
have some questions about this.

39
00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:12.886
This is called destructuring.

40
00:02:12.886 --> 00:02:16.172
We minorly touched on it,
but just a drive at home.

41
00:02:16.172 --> 00:02:21.311
So if I have const person = name Brian and

42
00:02:21.311 --> 00:02:27.217
job engineer, something like this, right?

43
00:02:27.217 --> 00:02:32.575
And I wanna pull name out of person
just so I can have a name variable.

44
00:02:32.575 --> 00:02:37.541
I could say something like this,
const name = person.

45
00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:40.202
And this looks like kinda strange.

46
00:02:40.202 --> 00:02:42.999
But what this is saying is
I have this person object,

47
00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:44.598
which I defined right there.

48
00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:47.438
And I'm pulling out name, so

49
00:02:47.438 --> 00:02:53.127
that I can just say something
like console.log(name).

50
00:02:53.127 --> 00:02:56.499
So name, in this case,
will correspond to this property up here,

51
00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:57.776
which is Brian, right?

52
00:02:57.776 --> 00:02:59.443
So that's what this is doing up here.

53
00:02:59.443 --> 00:03:02.803
This is just pulling out styler,
spring, listen, pointer, value,

54
00:03:02.803 --> 00:03:05.057
all the stuff that's on
the popmotion object.

55
00:03:05.057 --> 00:03:06.798
Make sense?

56
00:03:06.798 --> 00:03:13.962
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Isn't that code then
reassigning the name to the entire object?

57
00:03:13.962 --> 00:03:18.368
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, I can see why you would
think that, and that's what it looks like,

58
00:03:18.368 --> 00:03:20.363
but that's not how this works.

59
00:03:20.363 --> 00:03:24.856
Because I have curly braces here, it does
destructuring instead of reassignment or

60
00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:26.069
something like that.

61
00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.814
It's saying this person object,
pull that out and pull name out and

62
00:03:29.814 --> 00:03:32.320
assign its own variable to be person.name.

63
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.840
So const name = person.name.

64
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.045
That's what it's doing
underneath the hood.

65
00:03:45.452 --> 00:03:46.764
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It is confusing.

66
00:03:46.764 --> 00:03:49.776
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay,
because you could already say person.name.

67
00:03:49.776 --> 00:03:51.462
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Which will give you Brian.

68
00:03:51.462 --> 00:03:54.124
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, so [COUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Now you're just creating

69
00:03:54.124 --> 00:03:55.583
a shortcut for Brian.

70
00:03:55.583 --> 00:03:57.683
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Exactly,
exactly [COUGH] and so

71
00:03:57.683 --> 00:04:01.574
this is convenient when you
have a bunch of these things.

72
00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:04.293
Otherwise, I'd have to have six
lines of pulling stuff out.

73
00:04:08.552 --> 00:04:11.251
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there are lots
of people that don't like that,

74
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:14.354
that they think this is more
confusing than it's worth.

75
00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:17.005
But I'm lazy, so I like it.

76
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.856
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Does that
answer your question?

77
00:04:22.856 --> 00:04:23.798
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

78
00:04:23.798 --> 00:04:25.119
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You just
look upset by the answer.

79
00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:25.733
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

80
00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:27.749
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, that's fine,
that's fine, you can be upset.

81
00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:29.435
[LAUGH]
