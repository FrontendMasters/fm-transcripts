00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.762
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's talk about
rotations for just a second.

2
00:00:02.762 --> 00:00:06.395
We didn't talk about animations or
keyframes or anything like that, did we?

3
00:00:06.395 --> 00:00:09.904
Okay, so it's not too bad.

4
00:00:09.904 --> 00:00:11.243
So let's look at spin here for

5
00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:14.256
a second, which is the second little
mole guy is doing right here.

6
00:00:16.302 --> 00:00:19.714
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
this is on the dog exercises page.

7
00:00:19.714 --> 00:00:21.946
You're gonna define some
sort of animation here.

8
00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:26.054
So, here, I'm creating one called spin.

9
00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:27.246
And what you're saying is,

10
00:00:27.246 --> 00:00:32.185
I want you to go from this state,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: From,

11
00:00:38.184 --> 00:00:43.571
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Transform z to 0 degrees,

12
00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:44.982
okay?

13
00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.727
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
ignore everything else here,

14
00:00:51.727 --> 00:00:53.938
we're just looking at this
keyframe spin for a second.

15
00:00:53.938 --> 00:00:58.626
So these are how you define
reusable animations in CSS.

16
00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:04.060
So I'm saying, go from a 0 degree
rotation to a 360 degree rotation,

17
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.859
which CSS knows, okay, that means I'm
gonna go from 0, all the way around.

18
00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:14.794
If I change this to be 180,
wow, or you can set it to 1800,

19
00:01:14.794 --> 00:01:17.072
and he's put on the spin cycle.

20
00:01:17.072 --> 00:01:21.326
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But here,

21
00:01:21.326 --> 00:01:26.027
it would go to the top and then it would
go back all the way around, right?

22
00:01:26.027 --> 00:01:27.946
That's why we do 360, so
it goes all the way around.

23
00:01:33.442 --> 00:01:37.507
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So from and to, it
basically says, start here, end here, and

24
00:01:37.507 --> 00:01:40.364
figure out what to do in the middle,
right?

25
00:01:40.364 --> 00:01:42.046
You can actually be more
specific than that.

26
00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:48.289
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can be super specific,
so 90%,

27
00:01:51.833 --> 00:01:58.362
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or let's do 0%, 100%.

28
00:01:58.362 --> 00:02:02.983
And then I can say something in here like,
90%,

29
00:02:02.983 --> 00:02:09.120
transform,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: 350,

30
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.300
so it's gonna make the first part of this
super fast and the last part super slow.

31
00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.665
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I gotta
change this back to 360.

32
00:02:24.428 --> 00:02:26.749
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, so it kind of
gives it that little jerk at the end.

33
00:02:29.574 --> 00:02:31.923
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So suffice to say,
you don't really have to,

34
00:02:31.923 --> 00:02:36.217
if you're just gonna make it spin, all you
have to do is just to define the 100%.

35
00:02:36.217 --> 00:02:41.072
Or you can also say, 2,
which is shorthand for 100%.

36
00:02:41.072 --> 00:02:43.891
And this just makes it
spin all the way around.

37
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:46.811
Okay, make sense?

38
00:02:46.811 --> 00:02:49.228
So that's defining the spin part of it.

39
00:02:49.228 --> 00:02:52.496
Down here,
you actually have to use it here.

40
00:02:52.496 --> 00:02:56.903
To spin, you say, animation,
which is the name of the property.

41
00:02:56.903 --> 00:03:01.407
Say, I want you to spin,
which refers to this, right?

42
00:03:01.407 --> 00:03:04.205
I want you to take 3 seconds to do it.

43
00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:06.216
There's this thing called ease in and out.

44
00:03:06.216 --> 00:03:10.766
Notice that when it spins, it goes and it
starts slowly, and then it goes faster and

45
00:03:10.766 --> 00:03:13.960
then it ends slowly, that's called easing.

46
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.326
So if I just said, linear, it means
it's gonna spin in equal parts and

47
00:03:18.326 --> 00:03:21.956
it's not gonna go faster in
any particular part, right?

48
00:03:21.956 --> 00:03:26.050
Now it's just gonna keep spinning
at the same speed the entire time,

49
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.449
which is how I was doing the CSS
spinner before with that.

50
00:03:31.741 --> 00:03:33.461
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sense?

51
00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:37.445
If you're asking why we're
doing rotate z right here, so

52
00:03:37.445 --> 00:03:41.036
we're thinking about things in 3D space,
right?

53
00:03:41.036 --> 00:03:44.671
You have the x-axis,
the y-axis and the z-axis, right?

54
00:03:44.671 --> 00:03:47.929
So we're spinning things around
the z-axis, which is between you and

55
00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:48.698
me and the user.

56
00:03:48.698 --> 00:03:53.558
So I'm spinning like this, right, which is
why it looks like it's spinning like that.

57
00:03:53.558 --> 00:03:56.548
So now if I change this to be rotateY,

58
00:03:56.548 --> 00:04:00.606
it's gonna spin like that,
right, like a coin.

59
00:04:03.653 --> 00:04:08.399
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Same thing if I do rotateX,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's

60
00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:09.393
gonna rotate like that.

61
00:04:12.883 --> 00:04:15.240
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
in this case, we want z, right?

62
00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:25.709
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And if I want it
to go faster, so the 3 seconds,

63
00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:30.959
I can put .5 or .4,
now it is going pretty fast, right?

64
00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:35.507
And you can get it going pretty damn fast,
like 0.04.

65
00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:40.813
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Faster than
the projector can display it.

66
00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:44.325
So this is how you would do, like if
I wanted to do an emoji there, right?

67
00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:50.392
I would just put a spin or a div there and
just have it rotate that particular div.

68
00:04:50.392 --> 00:04:55.287
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So then do you use it as
a background image when you're displaying?

69
00:04:55.287 --> 00:04:57.210
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You could,
you could do it that way if you wanted to.

70
00:05:00.437 --> 00:05:04.508
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In fact,

71
00:05:04.508 --> 00:05:12.119
I could totally come down here and
say, &lt;h1 class="spin"&gt;.

72
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.761
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I could put hi, right?

73
00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:23.269
Now look at-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

74
00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:23.852
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, why is it

75
00:05:23.852 --> 00:05:25.323
going all the way around like that?

76
00:05:25.323 --> 00:05:28.943
Well, an h1, by default is gonna try and
take the entire line, right?

77
00:05:28.943 --> 00:05:34.288
So let's see what happens here if I say,
text-align-center,

78
00:05:34.288 --> 00:05:38.868
then it's gonna at least put
it into the center of that.

79
00:05:41.267 --> 00:05:43.134
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sense?

80
00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:45.262
So it's kind of fun.

81
00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:49.658
Let's maybe slow that down a bit,
I'm probably making someone sick.

82
00:05:49.658 --> 00:05:50.595
But there you go.

83
00:05:53.028 --> 00:05:54.669
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But even still,
if I right-click and

84
00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.603
Inspect Element on this,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Look,

85
00:05:58.603 --> 00:06:02.819
it's spinning the entire div, right?

86
00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:05.745
We probably wanna talk about this one
as well, right, this psychedelic one.

87
00:06:05.745 --> 00:06:08.177
This is kind of fun.

88
00:06:08.177 --> 00:06:14.010
So there's a thing in CSS called filters,
which there's also blur, right?

89
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.202
Where you can make CSS blur things,
and in the background.

90
00:06:17.202 --> 00:06:18.328
And there's a bunch of other ones.

91
00:06:18.328 --> 00:06:20.739
You can make them sepia and
black and white.

92
00:06:20.739 --> 00:06:22.903
Filter allows you to do
a bunch of that stuff.

93
00:06:22.903 --> 00:06:27.331
The one I'm using here is hue-rotate,
which if you're familiar with colors and

94
00:06:27.331 --> 00:06:29.974
things like that,
there's a thing called HSL.

95
00:06:29.974 --> 00:06:34.399
Hue, saturation, and lightness, or
brightness, depending on who you ask.

96
00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:37.521
In CSS, we call it HSL.

97
00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:41.287
And what we're doing is, is we're rotating
the color around the color wheel, right?

98
00:06:41.287 --> 00:06:46.303
So if you think about a big color wheel,
in fact, it's actually built into this.

99
00:06:46.303 --> 00:06:48.948
If I get my CSS here.

100
00:06:48.948 --> 00:06:50.723
Let's grab another one
here that I have open.

101
00:06:53.082 --> 00:06:56.552
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: CSS,
okay, so I think, yeah.

102
00:06:56.552 --> 00:07:01.870
So what this is doing is it's rotating
basically this around like this.

103
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.608
And that's rotating the hue.

104
00:07:03.608 --> 00:07:08.584
So this progression of
color here is the hue.

105
00:07:08.584 --> 00:07:11.582
Whereas this right here, whether or

106
00:07:11.582 --> 00:07:16.428
not how far I'm this way,
that's gonna be how light it is.

107
00:07:16.428 --> 00:07:20.422
And then saturated is how
vibrant the color is.

108
00:07:20.422 --> 00:07:23.271
None of that stuff is actually really
important in this particular case.

109
00:07:23.271 --> 00:07:26.212
What's important here is that I'm
just rotating around the color wheel,

110
00:07:26.212 --> 00:07:28.229
which is how we get this
crazy psychedelic effect.

111
00:07:29.696 --> 00:07:33.930
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Point being here is, with
keyframes, you can animate more than just

112
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:38.097
rotating or things like that,
you can actually rotate positions.

113
00:07:38.097 --> 00:07:41.353
The animations for
the final game, for the the fox,

114
00:07:41.353 --> 00:07:43.654
are all done with keyframes as well.

115
00:07:43.654 --> 00:07:46.521
So another thing that you can
do that's kinda fun here,

116
00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:49.088
if I do spin, and
then I also do alternative here.

117
00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:54.681
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If I look here, it's gonna
spin one way and then spin the other way.

118
00:07:59.083 --> 00:08:01.518
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is pretty fun too.

119
00:08:01.518 --> 00:08:04.885
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can you have it rotate on
multiple axes without overwriting it?

120
00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:06.817
Cuz if you just put it below,
it just changes.

121
00:08:09.627 --> 00:08:11.423
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This should work.

122
00:08:11.423 --> 00:08:12.143
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Maybe it's not for me.

123
00:08:12.143 --> 00:08:13.688
I don't have the image loading,
so it's just.

124
00:08:13.688 --> 00:08:14.806
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hold on.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Solid color.

125
00:08:14.806 --> 00:08:15.933
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Actually, you know what?

126
00:08:15.933 --> 00:08:16.433
It has to be this.

127
00:08:18.786 --> 00:08:19.494
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

128
00:08:21.552 --> 00:08:23.328
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's a way to do it,
I can't remember what it is.

129
00:08:23.328 --> 00:08:25.136
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

130
00:08:25.136 --> 00:08:26.077
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There it is.

131
00:08:26.077 --> 00:08:27.222
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Cool.

132
00:08:29.937 --> 00:08:32.426
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Wow, I mean,
let's go with full gyroscopic motions.

133
00:08:32.426 --> 00:08:40.576
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

134
00:08:40.576 --> 00:08:44.019
in case you're wondering,
that's what it looks like.

135
00:08:44.019 --> 00:08:45.489
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Just in case
you wanna make people sick.

136
00:08:47.973 --> 00:08:49.716
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you wanna fix this,
what you're doing right now,

137
00:08:49.716 --> 00:08:50.741
just remove the periods here.

138
00:08:50.741 --> 00:08:55.846
So this has period,
period right now, just put period/.

139
00:08:55.846 --> 00:08:57.701
I thought I would fix that,
but apparently I haven't.

140
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.553
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so
these are fun, right?

141
00:09:05.553 --> 00:09:08.093
Definitely stuff you can be
doing today with your CSS.

142
00:09:08.093 --> 00:09:11.532
And so this is what I want you to do,
is I want you to make a dog or

143
00:09:11.532 --> 00:09:14.378
some sort of emoji spinner
when you're loading.
