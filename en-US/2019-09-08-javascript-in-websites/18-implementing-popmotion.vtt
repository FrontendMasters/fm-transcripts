00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.165
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now, I want to grab
this off of pop motion over here, right?

2
00:00:07.165 --> 00:00:11.186
So if you click here on
the fork on CodePen,

3
00:00:11.186 --> 00:00:17.108
this little button down here,
it's gonna bring up a code pen,

4
00:00:17.108 --> 00:00:25.917
contain this,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

5
00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:28.702
it has a bunch of stuff in here,
and you know what I'm gonna do?

6
00:00:28.702 --> 00:00:30.892
I'm just gonna copy and paste all of it.

7
00:00:33.513 --> 00:00:37.816
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm gonna copy, go over
to my gallery, underneath my swiper stuff,

8
00:00:37.816 --> 00:00:40.432
it could be above, too, doesn't matter.

9
00:00:40.432 --> 00:00:49.631
So this is gonna be
the Navigation physics.

10
00:00:49.631 --> 00:00:54.298
This is all the stuff that
they gave me from CodePen.

11
00:00:54.298 --> 00:00:57.553
And the only thing I'm gonna
do up here is the ball,

12
00:00:57.553 --> 00:01:00.520
in the sense,
it's not this ball right here.

13
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.563
We want that to be brand, right?

14
00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:10.167
Cuz we want the brand to have physics
operate on it, not some sort of box.

15
00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:13.821
Now, this is called ball, and
that's not really a good name for it.

16
00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:17.125
But for now, let's just leave it,
cuz it's already set up and working.

17
00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:22.180
So now, if I save that, we'll talk
about the code here in a second,

18
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.113
but, for now,
it's enough to copy and paste this.

19
00:01:26.113 --> 00:01:30.223
They come back over here to swipe or

20
00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:34.338
gallery, and I refresh the page.

21
00:01:34.338 --> 00:01:37.004
Now, you can drag and drop this.

22
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:40.109
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Said that the z-index should
keep it from going behind anything?

23
00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.249
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mm-hm, so
if we go back over here,

24
00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:46.924
mind this thing in front of the pictures.

25
00:01:46.924 --> 00:01:49.905
So if I inspect element here.

26
00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:52.828
So I have the z-index right there.

27
00:01:52.828 --> 00:01:54.955
I just give it a value of ten.

28
00:01:54.955 --> 00:01:58.007
But if I take that off,
notice I drag and drop it,

29
00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:00.625
it's gonna go behind the pictures here.

30
00:02:02.903 --> 00:02:05.901
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Because it's higher on the
page, it's implied be behind something.

31
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.029
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's why if I give
the z-index, that should it, above it.

32
00:02:13.832 --> 00:02:15.502
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So are you seeing this?

33
00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:16.829
This is working for you.

34
00:02:21.388 --> 00:02:25.300
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the key here, is I
got everything off of the CodePen, and

35
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.230
the only thing I changed about the
CodePen, is I changed the query selector

36
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.500
right there, to be dot brand new set of
dot box, and then, you have to load the.

37
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.741
You have to have the nav
up there obviously, right?

38
00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:42.671
And you have to have this script tag.

39
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.434
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then, that should work.

40
00:02:53.517 --> 00:02:56.337
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, if you're still
having issues, the next place to dive

41
00:02:56.337 --> 00:02:59.500
into would be the console to see
what kind of errors you're getting.

42
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.845
So I'm not getting any errors, but
this is where you would find them.

43
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:17.247
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But then, this is a nice
little Easter egg that you can show your

44
00:03:17.247 --> 00:03:20.781
people that are visiting your portfolio,
or something like that,

45
00:03:20.781 --> 00:03:23.137
is you could make stuff
randomly draggable.

46
00:03:23.137 --> 00:03:25.869
I always think those
things are kind of fun.

47
00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:31.318
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Stuff you commented out in
the JavaScript is not meant to break it,

48
00:03:31.318 --> 00:03:32.884
Math and damping.

49
00:03:32.884 --> 00:03:35.457
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I never even
tried to commenting it.

50
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.409
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Iron common today,

51
00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:49.650
and it won't move for me.

52
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.576
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sure you have
all your comma's, it's probably.

53
00:03:52.576 --> 00:03:56.329
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yep,
right above, what does mass do?

54
00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.391
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I have no idea.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

55
00:03:57.391 --> 00:04:00.014
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [LAUGH] My guess
is that have to do something with

56
00:04:00.014 --> 00:04:01.302
the physics, right?

57
00:04:01.302 --> 00:04:06.791
So if I make like a really heavy, and
I make the physics interact differently.

58
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:07.811
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, there you got.

59
00:04:11.822 --> 00:04:14.153
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Lucky guess.
