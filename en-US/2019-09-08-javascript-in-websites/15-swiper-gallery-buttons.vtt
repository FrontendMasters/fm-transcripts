WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.538 --> 00:00:03.450
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
let's go do those buttons really quick.

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.225
So we forgot to do that.

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.440
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The buttons, okay.

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.496
Back to your index.html here.

5
00:00:10.496 --> 00:00:17.618
Underneath the two divs here, above
the scripts./ We're gonna do two buttons.

6
00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:21.447
One of them's gonna be div

7
00:00:21.447 --> 00:00:27.196
class="swiper-button-prev".

8
00:00:27.196 --> 00:00:31.921
And this one's gonna
be swiper-button-next.

9
00:00:36.178 --> 00:00:38.423
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now, if we come
over to our little gallery here,

10
00:00:38.423 --> 00:00:40.471
the swiper gallery, and
we refresh the page.

11
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:44.130
Looks relatively similar, right.

12
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.555
But now we have this
button here on the side.

13
00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:46.846
And if you click on it.

14
00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:50.064
Get like a nice little
sliding animation there.

15
00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:57.957
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So does this look better or
worse than the one that we built?

16
00:00:57.957 --> 00:01:00.422
I think ours had some
like homey charm to it.

17
00:01:00.422 --> 00:01:04.930
But what's also cool,
try clicking and dragging on it.

18
00:01:10.218 --> 00:01:11.328
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right,
that's pretty cool as well.

19
00:01:14.852 --> 00:01:16.728
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So how much time
will this take us to write by hand?

20
00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:17.922
A lot.

21
00:01:17.922 --> 00:01:19.860
So it's really nice to be
able to do someone else's.

22
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.755
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it supposed
to be interactive already?

23
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.729
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Did you link your
JavaScript here at the bottom?

24
00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.432
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

25
00:01:34.432 --> 00:01:36.767
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then I would
probably look at your console and

26
00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:39.354
see if you have any errors or
something like that.

27
00:01:39.354 --> 00:01:43.186
I don't have anything in
my console at the moment.

28
00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:48.925
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Curious about like
when you're doing a big web page,

29
00:01:48.925 --> 00:01:51.381
more than just like a gallery.

30
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:54.698
What is the maximum amount of
JavaScript you would link?

31
00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:57.707
Is it average like just one library and
then one of your own?

32
00:01:57.707 --> 00:02:01.963
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know if there's
gonna be a cap on how much you would do.

33
00:02:01.963 --> 00:02:06.979
Like if you go to like something like
Netflix.com and see how many script files,

34
00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.538
they're probably loading 20 or
something like that.

35
00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:13.359
The more succinct answer to that is,

36
00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:19.185
I'm kind of showing you how to do
something like very crafted the each page.

37
00:02:19.185 --> 00:02:21.837
When you start getting
into larger companies and

38
00:02:21.837 --> 00:02:23.583
larger amounts of JavaScript,

39
00:02:23.583 --> 00:02:28.044
you'll have basically tools that you'll
write a bunch of JavaScript files, and

40
00:02:28.044 --> 00:02:32.008
it'll concatenate them and minify and
send them down as all in one file.

41
00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:36.380
So you could have a little bit more
control in what's loaded in what order and

42
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.484
things like that.

43
00:02:37.484 --> 00:02:40.360
So that's a little bit
more advanced use case.

44
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.587
In the other version of this that
I teach for Frontend Masters,

45
00:02:44.587 --> 00:02:48.357
there's a part on how to do that,
in a very basic level.

46
00:02:48.357 --> 00:02:50.003
So that's definitely
a video worth checking out

47
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.694
if you're interested in
learning how to do that.

48
00:02:51.694 --> 00:02:55.456
And then there's a webpack course here.

49
00:02:55.456 --> 00:02:56.595
And that's kinda what webpack is for.

50
00:02:56.595 --> 00:02:59.034
But that's way more advanced.

51
00:02:59.034 --> 00:02:59.818
Cool?

52
00:02:59.818 --> 00:03:00.952
Not cool?

53
00:03:00.952 --> 00:03:01.539
Pretty cool?

54
00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:04.418
Yeah, Lenny thinks it's cool.

55
00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:05.317
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: John has a question online.

56
00:03:05.317 --> 00:03:10.688
He's asking, are these divs a bad thing
to implement due to accessibility issues?

57
00:03:10.688 --> 00:03:13.477
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I love that
you asked me that question.

58
00:03:13.477 --> 00:03:16.327
And my first answer is probably.

59
00:03:16.327 --> 00:03:18.085
And my second answer is I don't know.

60
00:03:18.085 --> 00:03:19.599
So let's take a look.

61
00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.003
Let's see how well.

62
00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:22.722
You know what?

63
00:03:22.722 --> 00:03:24.775
They did okay.

64
00:03:24.775 --> 00:03:28.672
Look, so they have a role=button here,
an aria-label next slide.

65
00:03:28.672 --> 00:03:30.049
And aria-disabled is false.

66
00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.687
So this is actually well done.

67
00:03:34.712 --> 00:03:37.676
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But as you can see here,
they had to put all this stuff on here to

68
00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:39.852
make it look like a button
to a screen reader.

69
00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:41.968
It's a lot easier to just
put a damn button there.

70
00:03:41.968 --> 00:03:45.953
So [LAUGH] because all that
stuff's just built into buttons.

71
00:03:45.953 --> 00:03:51.429
So I could not do this from memory,
I would have to go look up.

72
00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:54.104
It's like okay, what are all the things I
need to for this to look like a button?

73
00:03:54.104 --> 00:03:56.058
It's better to just use
a button typically.

74
00:03:56.058 --> 00:03:57.799
Other questions?

75
00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.398
&gt;&gt; Mark: Is this a good
time to mention that this

76
00:04:00.398 --> 00:04:03.491
script is on
the Frontend Masters home page?

77
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:06.540
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so should I just,
I'll just bring it up here.

78
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.114
FrontendMasters.com.

79
00:04:12.114 --> 00:04:15.124
So if you go down here.

80
00:04:15.124 --> 00:04:16.318
This is Swiper, right, Mark?

81
00:04:16.318 --> 00:04:17.383
&gt;&gt; Mark: Yeah.

82
00:04:21.642 --> 00:04:24.642
&gt;&gt; Mark: There's a lot of
performance things I've added to it.

83
00:04:24.642 --> 00:04:26.270
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But you can see down here,

84
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.170
you can see the little
pagination that it has.

85
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.502
It has a ton of features into it.

86
00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:33.304
In fact, I wanna play around with a couple
more of them just to show you how to

87
00:04:33.304 --> 00:04:33.851
mess with it.

88
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:35.984
But If it's good enough for
Frontend Masters,

89
00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:37.647
it's probably good enough for you.

90
00:04:37.647 --> 00:04:39.124
&gt;&gt; Mark: [LAUGH] Resize the browser and
hit refresh.

91
00:04:39.124 --> 00:04:41.440
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like to a smaller size?

92
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.514
&gt;&gt; Mark: Or bigger.

93
00:04:42.514 --> 00:04:44.892
Or I guess you don't need to refresh it.

94
00:04:44.892 --> 00:04:45.509
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so

95
00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:50.778
it's actually dynamically alotting how
many tweets it's showing at one time.

96
00:04:54.468 --> 00:05:00.197
&gt;&gt; Mark: Yeah, and then, I like lazy
load the tweets, because otherwise.

97
00:05:00.197 --> 00:05:00.998
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It takes forever.

98
00:05:00.998 --> 00:05:04.674
&gt;&gt; Mark: Yeah, there's like 100 tweets.

99
00:05:04.674 --> 00:05:05.613
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

100
00:05:05.613 --> 00:05:07.989
&gt;&gt; Mark: So,
if you have like a ton of them, and just,

101
00:05:07.989 --> 00:05:09.753
you don't want to load them all.

102
00:05:09.753 --> 00:05:12.844
So Swiper has a lazy load feature.

103
00:05:12.844 --> 00:05:13.739
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's cool.

104
00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:17.981
So this library is incredibly flexible.

105
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:19.367
There's tons of stuff you can do with it.

106
00:05:19.367 --> 00:05:22.429
You can have it go vertically,
you can have it be able to scroll.

107
00:05:22.429 --> 00:05:25.264
It's very touch friendly for
like phones and

108
00:05:25.264 --> 00:05:28.479
stuff like that,
which is really, really great.

109
00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.726
I think we used it,
at least at one point, on Netflix.com.

110
00:05:32.726 --> 00:05:35.052
So that's also a pretty big endorsement.

111
00:05:35.052 --> 00:05:37.580
And if you look on their website,

112
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.747
they actually show you all
their companies down here.

113
00:05:41.747 --> 00:05:48.066
Adobe, Cisco, Disney, BMW,
a bunch of companies like that.

114
00:05:48.066 --> 00:05:50.286
So Swiper's great.

115
00:05:50.286 --> 00:05:53.288
But in general, what I'm trying to
show you here is that if you think

116
00:05:53.288 --> 00:05:55.720
it's like I need to put
an image gallery on my webpage.

117
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.304
You can build it like, like now you know,
definitely that you can build it,

118
00:05:59.304 --> 00:06:01.160
because we built it together, right?

119
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.401
But oftentimes, it's better to just say
like someone else put a lot of time and

120
00:06:05.401 --> 00:06:06.503
thought into this.

121
00:06:06.503 --> 00:06:08.037
I'm just going to rely
on what they've done.

122
00:06:08.037 --> 00:06:09.914
So there's nothing wrong with that.

123
00:06:09.914 --> 00:06:12.426
That's not cheating or anything like that.

124
00:06:12.426 --> 00:06:13.756
That's what you should be doing.

125
00:06:20.838 --> 00:06:23.428
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: One of my colleagues at
Microsoft made the example of machine

126
00:06:23.428 --> 00:06:23.946
learning.

127
00:06:23.946 --> 00:06:28.521
He sat down, he taught us in
a workshop how machine learning works.

128
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:32.139
It's surprisingly not as
complicated as one might expect.

129
00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.345
And so he sat down and
like showed us how to do it.

130
00:06:35.345 --> 00:06:38.311
And then at the end of it, he's like,
okay, you know how this works.

131
00:06:38.311 --> 00:06:39.568
You could build it.

132
00:06:39.568 --> 00:06:41.241
Do you want to?

133
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:46.180
The answer's no, I just want Tensorflow or
whatever library to do it for me, right?

134
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.037
That's kind of how I feel about
a bunch of these widgets.

135
00:06:48.037 --> 00:06:51.947
I could do this, I don't want to,
so I'm not going to.

136
00:06:51.947 --> 00:06:53.375
I'll let someone else handle it for me.

137
00:06:53.375 --> 00:06:57.732
&gt;&gt; Mark: The fact that you know how
to do it means you're gonna better

138
00:06:57.732 --> 00:07:02.363
understand how to modify or
change the behavior or something.

139
00:07:02.363 --> 00:07:03.851
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Absolutely.

140
00:07:03.851 --> 00:07:04.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, like you were saying.

141
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.251
Like you modified it to be like more
in line with your expectations for

142
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:08.285
frontendmasters.com.

143
00:07:08.285 --> 00:07:11.112
And that's absolutely
what you should be doing.

144
00:07:11.112 --> 00:07:15.310
I bastardize other people's
code all the time.

145
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.033
Actually you could probably call
me a professional bastardizer.
