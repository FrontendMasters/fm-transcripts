00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.400
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, the last tricky thing
that we kind of have to do here is,

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.710
what happens when we reach the end?

3
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.980
We do have to check if we're at the end.

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:08.960
So how are we gonna do that?

5
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.410
How do we know that we're
at the end of images?

6
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.770
Cuz eventually I'm gonna click Next,
and I'm gonna run out of pictures here.

7
00:00:18.872 --> 00:00:19.880
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think
this is the last image.

8
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.660
So if I click Next,

9
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.400
now it's just gonna, you went
somewhere that I don't know how to do.

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.090
So I need to once it reaches the end,
stop it.

11
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.506
So how do I know I'm at the end?

12
00:00:29.506 --> 00:00:32.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The length of the NodeList.

13
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's it,
it's exactly right.

14
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.270
So here I'm gonna say if,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: NodeList, yeah.

15
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.965
What I call galleryImgs,
galleryImgs.length

16
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.230
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: === currentlySelected + 1.

17
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.855
Now why + 1?

18
00:00:56.855 --> 00:01:03.159
So if I have 12 images in here, the last
element in that array is 11, right?

19
00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.170
Because we start at 0 with indexes, right?

20
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.200
And so currently selected is going to
be 11, if we've reached the end of it.

21
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.710
So you also could have put -1 over here,
that's fine as well.

22
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.500
You can either add one on one side or
subtract one on the other side.

23
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.050
Depends on whatever speaks to you.

24
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.282
I like + 1, so I'm gonna stick with that.

25
00:01:28.491 --> 00:01:32.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If that happens, then
we've reached the end of the Next, right?

26
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.440
So all we have to do then is say,

27
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.439
nextBtn.disabled = true.

28
00:01:44.852 --> 00:01:46.883
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
now if we come back over here and

29
00:01:46.883 --> 00:01:49.051
click through all of our Luna pictures.

30
00:01:53.745 --> 00:01:56.647
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hopefully,
we should get to this point and

31
00:01:56.647 --> 00:01:58.669
now Next button is disabled.

32
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.220
And again, I can click on this now.

33
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.360
And despite the fact that I haven't
removed this event listener here,

34
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.729
it's not gonna fire because
the button is disabled.

35
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.130
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I have a NodeList but
nothing happens when I click on Next.

36
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.560
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so if nothing's
happening when you clicked Next.

37
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.830
So even if you console log there,
it's not saying-

38
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Should I be console and

39
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.306
down logging?

40
00:02:23.306 --> 00:02:26.520
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just here,
just say this happens, right?

41
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.360
And if I come over here to my,
let me refresh this.

42
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.020
If I click Next then it should
say this happens, right?

43
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yep.

44
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.835
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that is happening?

45
00:02:37.835 --> 00:02:38.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Mm-hm.

46
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.104
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So problem is you have
an error somewhere inside of your,

47
00:02:43.104 --> 00:02:45.523
inside of your code somewhere.

48
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.211
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Tough to say
without looking at it, but

49
00:02:55.211 --> 00:02:56.670
I'll look at it with you.

50
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I'm looking at it.

51
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Even when looking at stuff.

52
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.093
I can look at it with you at the break.

53
00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:08.474
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is it working for
other people here so far?

54
00:03:15.524 --> 00:03:17.890
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So pretty cool, right?

55
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.080
We built an image gallery and it took
us about 20 lines of code to do it.

56
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.530
So what has this been to
demonstrate to you is one,

57
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.330
this is a useful thing that you could put
on to a production website today, right?

58
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.170
Rotating through images is
something that every website does.

59
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.640
And two, just a little bit of
JaveScript goes a long way with doing,

60
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.369
if youâ€™re more interested in
the styling sides of websites.

61
00:03:41.115 --> 00:03:42.914
Cuz who doesn't wanna
look at puppy pictures?
