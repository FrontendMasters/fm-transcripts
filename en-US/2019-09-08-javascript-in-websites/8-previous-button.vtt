00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.880
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think it makes
sense that we should go back and

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.793
do previous then right?

3
00:00:02.793 --> 00:00:07.746
As you might imagine,
it's pretty much the opposite, right?

4
00:00:07.746 --> 00:00:09.650
You do pretty much the same set of steps.

5
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.111
It's just gonna be almost the opposite.

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this line right here,
line 12 literally gonna be the same.

7
00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:26.385
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt:
GalleryImgs[currentlySelected].classList.-

8
00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:28.935
remove("active");.

9
00:00:33.197 --> 00:00:36.375
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, because if
you're going previous in the list,

10
00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:39.022
then you still have to
hide the current image.

11
00:00:42.017 --> 00:00:45.529
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then here,
currently select instead of going forward

12
00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:50.184
we're gonna go backwards, so if I'm on
image one and I wanna go back to zero,

13
00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:53.067
I have to do current image minus minus,
right?

14
00:00:53.067 --> 00:00:59.335
And again, that's the same as
currentlySelected = currentlySelected- 1.

15
00:00:59.335 --> 00:01:00.832
Let's make that a comment.

16
00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:11.022
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

17
00:01:14.455 --> 00:01:17.632
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then I do the same step here,

18
00:01:17.632 --> 00:01:25.414
galleryImgs[currentlySelected].classList.-
add("active");.

19
00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.444
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then we're
gonna say the nextBtn.

20
00:01:34.436 --> 00:01:37.406
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: .Disabled
is gonna be assigned false.

21
00:01:42.313 --> 00:01:43.446
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

22
00:01:45.616 --> 00:01:47.385
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now when do
we stop going previous?

23
00:01:47.385 --> 00:01:50.481
At what point do we have no
more previous images to show?

24
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:51.946
What is currently selected?

25
00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:53.453
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The first one.

26
00:01:53.453 --> 00:01:55.615
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is index what?

27
00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:59.236
What is currently selected
going to equal at that point?

28
00:01:59.236 --> 00:02:01.182
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Zero.

29
00:02:01.182 --> 00:02:04.520
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so you're both right.

30
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.398
That zero one, is the first one.

31
00:02:06.398 --> 00:02:07.209
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is the first yeah.

32
00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:09.035
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, exactly, you got it.

33
00:02:09.035 --> 00:02:13.890
So if currently selected,

34
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.067
=== 0 then prevBtn, is that right,

35
00:02:21.067 --> 00:02:25.509
yep, disabled = true.

36
00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.047
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So as you can see,
the logic here is almost exactly the same.

37
00:02:35.047 --> 00:02:38.987
The only thing that changes here is
we're going backwards instead of going

38
00:02:38.987 --> 00:02:42.310
forwards and then which buttons
were enabling and disabling.

39
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.106
Otherwise it's 100% the same logic.

40
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.048
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so now, I have
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Luna here and

41
00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:56.835
if I hit next, and
I hit previous again, it does go back.

42
00:02:56.835 --> 00:03:00.095
It does disable previous,
does everything that we're supposed to do.

43
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.369
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah?

44
00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:06.194
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I'm using the code
form the course website.

45
00:03:06.194 --> 00:03:10.990
In the init function, does it matter
the order that you put your functions in?

46
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.864
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nope.

47
00:03:11.864 --> 00:03:17.089
As long as they both get called,
yeah, it doesn't matter.
