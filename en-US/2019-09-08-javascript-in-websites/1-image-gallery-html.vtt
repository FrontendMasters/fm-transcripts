00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.963
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: On the course website,

2
00:00:00.963 --> 00:00:03.140
I have all the HTML if you
wanna just copy and paste it.

3
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.398
But I'm actually gonna go through it and
write and explain what I am gonna do.

4
00:00:07.398 --> 00:00:10.891
So I'm gonna make just like
a base level document.

5
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:11.996
Let's make this a lot bigger.

6
00:00:13.255 --> 00:00:15.730
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And here, we're gonna call
this photo gallery or Luna gallery or

7
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.590
something like that.

8
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.574
We'll call it the Luna gallery.

9
00:00:21.346 --> 00:00:21.984
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

10
00:00:25.283 --> 00:00:26.978
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then here,
I'm gonna create a div.

11
00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.211
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Call it the image gallery.

12
00:00:38.646 --> 00:00:40.949
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, what I wanna
get here is I wanna get 12 images.

13
00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.465
I want them to have
the class of gallery image.

14
00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:45.827
And have an alt text of Luna.

15
00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:50.322
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
if you don't want to copy all that again,

16
00:00:50.322 --> 00:00:51.619
that's all just right here.

17
00:00:53.767 --> 00:00:55.325
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
that's actually what I'm gonna do.

18
00:00:59.836 --> 00:01:01.814
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Otherwise,
feel free to write 12 image tags.

19
00:01:01.814 --> 00:01:03.696
That just doesn't seem like
a useful exercise to me.

20
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.542
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's go ahead and
make sure this is indented all correctly.

21
00:01:15.323 --> 00:01:16.224
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go.

22
00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:22.721
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now,
if I come over here to Firefox.

23
00:01:22.721 --> 00:01:24.352
Let's actually make a new tab here.

24
00:01:24.352 --> 00:01:25.365
Open.

25
00:01:26.598 --> 00:01:31.594
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Go to the desktop
gallery index dot html, and open that.

26
00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.908
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right now, I have not moved
those images into the directory, but

27
00:01:36.908 --> 00:01:39.220
you can see here all of
the alt texts are showing up.

28
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.696
So far so good.

29
00:01:41.696 --> 00:01:44.746
So I'm gonna go download that gallery.

30
00:01:47.948 --> 00:01:49.998
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I guess I can
just copy it from where I have it.

31
00:01:49.998 --> 00:01:51.033
Well, whatever.

32
00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:53.291
We'll download the image
from the image gallery.

33
00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:55.842
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Open.

34
00:01:58.093 --> 00:02:01.876
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then here,
I'm just gonna grab this folder here,

35
00:02:01.876 --> 00:02:03.284
the images folder.

36
00:02:05.112 --> 00:02:10.158
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Going to just
move that into my gallery.

37
00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:14.418
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and so now,

38
00:02:14.418 --> 00:02:18.119
you can see here, I have all of these
images here next to my index dot html.

39
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:20.145
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good?

40
00:02:27.985 --> 00:02:29.804
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now,
if we come back to gallery

41
00:02:29.804 --> 00:02:30.926
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Not that one, this one.

42
00:02:30.926 --> 00:02:35.056
Now, you can see,
we have all these large images showing up.

43
00:02:35.056 --> 00:02:37.788
So the way that we're gonna show and

44
00:02:37.788 --> 00:02:42.261
hide images is we're gonna
be using CSS classes, right?

45
00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:46.917
We're gonna take advantage of
the fact that we can add and

46
00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:51.194
subtract classes from image
elements very simply.

47
00:02:51.194 --> 00:02:55.451
And so, let's go ahead and
create another CSS file here.

48
00:02:58.426 --> 00:03:01.173
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And call it,
I'm gonna call it styles dot css,

49
00:03:01.173 --> 00:03:05.171
just cuz I'm not creative and
that's what I call all of my CSS files.

50
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:08.616
But feel free to call
what you wanna call it.

51
00:03:08.616 --> 00:03:11.667
And we're just gonna put in it
just a handful of CSS here.
