1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.982
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What we're going
to do today, is we're going

2
00:00:04.982 --> 00:00:09.597
to focus more on interacting with the DOM.

3
00:00:09.597 --> 00:00:15.629
So, and then we'll go over
the feed-a-mole on the last part.

4
00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.350
So making your site interactive.

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.904
So click on this section here,
and we're gonna go through and

6
00:00:23.904 --> 00:00:28.293
we're gonna add some pizzazz
to your portfolios, right?

7
00:00:28.293 --> 00:00:34.257
So some more interactivity, some more
different kind of things you can do here.

8
00:00:34.257 --> 00:00:36.629
So, let's see if I can find for

9
00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.021
you what we're going to build
first we're gonna build.

10
00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:42.118
This.

11
00:00:42.118 --> 00:00:45.762
We're gonna build a little image gallery.

12
00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:46.882
This is my dog.

13
00:00:46.882 --> 00:00:51.605
[LAUGH] And so you can notice here,
if I hit next, the previous one gets

14
00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:55.677
grayed out and scroll through
all the various images here,

15
00:00:55.677 --> 00:01:00.584
till eventually, you get to the end and
then it grays out there as well.

16
00:01:00.584 --> 00:01:02.536
This should be fun.

17
00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:09.118
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I have a question.

18
00:01:09.118 --> 00:01:10.586
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: When those images load,

19
00:01:10.586 --> 00:01:13.207
do they load all at once or
do they load when you click the button?

20
00:01:13.207 --> 00:01:14.593
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question.

21
00:01:14.593 --> 00:01:19.168
So when I refresh the page here,
if I inspect element here,

22
00:01:19.168 --> 00:01:22.469
you can see these ones
that are grayed out.

23
00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.411
If I click on that, you can see done here,
that it has display none on it.

24
00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:30.498
So something that has display none on it,
is not going to load as images.

25
00:01:30.498 --> 00:01:35.102
So these are actually being loaded on
the fly, until this actually gets clicked,

26
00:01:35.102 --> 00:01:36.380
then it load that one.

27
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.631
This one is still technically
loaded in memory, probably,

28
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:41.934
depending on which browser you are using.

29
00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:45.111
So it just depends on which
browser you're using, and

30
00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:48.563
that kind of stuff that,
when there's display none on it,

31
00:01:48.563 --> 00:01:52.170
you can pretty well be guarantee
that it's not going to load.

32
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.673
Good question.

33
00:01:55.426 --> 00:01:56.122
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.
So,

34
00:01:56.122 --> 00:02:00.380
what I want you to do now is I want you
to get a bunch of your images together,

35
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.950
and we're going to build an image gallery.

36
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.255
You are welcome right there, you can
download the pictures of my dog, and

37
00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:11.075
just use those if you don't want
to go gather your own images, but

38
00:02:11.075 --> 00:02:13.458
feel free to use your own images as well.

39
00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:15.983
I'll give you just a second to do that,
and

40
00:02:15.983 --> 00:02:19.925
then we're going to open a brand
new VS code project and make this.

41
00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:23.996
It doesn't matter how many images you
have, I mean, as long as you have,

42
00:02:23.996 --> 00:02:24.600
I'd say.

43
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.134
But she have five, it's a minimum.

44
00:02:27.134 --> 00:02:32.364
They again, you feel free to just go ahead
and use the ones that I gave you as well.

45
00:02:36.054 --> 00:02:38.625
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is there particular sizes
that are going to be recommended?

46
00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:44.050
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I mean, for the sake
of this project, not particularly.

47
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.234
In general, you want the resolution
of the image to be larger

48
00:02:49.234 --> 00:02:53.910
than what you're displaying it at,
so if these ones,

49
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.621
if I didn't distinct how high they were,
they'd be much taller.

50
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:05.520
Right, cuz if I try and stretch them out,
then they look pixelated and it looks bad.

51
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.390
Right.

52
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.018
So once you kind of have
those images together,

53
00:03:10.018 --> 00:03:13.838
we’re gonna make a new
project here with VS code.

54
00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:23.272
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And do a file, new window.

55
00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:27.931
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Close that one.

56
00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:30.346
And I'm gonna come in here, and

57
00:03:30.346 --> 00:03:34.559
I'm going to make anew project
here just to my desktop.

58
00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:38.109
New folder,
I'm gonna call this the gallery or

59
00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:43.182
something like that, or carousel,
or whatever you wanna call it.

60
00:03:43.182 --> 00:03:45.062
I'm going with the gallery.

61
00:03:45.062 --> 00:03:45.981
Okay.

62
00:03:49.108 --> 00:03:51.595
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And let's just go ahead and
put this over here.

63
00:03:57.201 --> 00:03:58.562
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And let's make
this split a screen with Firefox.

64
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:08.965
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

65
00:04:08.965 --> 00:04:12.089
So once I've done that,
I'm gonna make a new file,

66
00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:14.300
and I'm gonna call it index.HTML.
