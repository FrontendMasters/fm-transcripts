00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.641
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now this
is fetching from the API.

2
00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:08.202
We wanna show a loading spinner, right,
because if I'm using your website and

3
00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:12.601
I click on bulldog and
nothing happens right away, I the user,

4
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:15.351
I'm gonna assume that this is broken.

5
00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:20.731
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In fact, it's not even
changing, so it might actually be broken.

6
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:23.730
See, it just took a long time
to request that picture, right?

7
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.287
So anything that's not,
there's some magic number, but

8
00:00:28.287 --> 00:00:32.665
it's basically if you don't respond to
someone's interaction in a half second,

9
00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:34.747
a user's going to think it's broken.

10
00:00:34.747 --> 00:00:36.589
And they notice it, and
they think it's broken.

11
00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:41.273
Anything that you can do in less than 400
milliseconds, I think it's what it was,

12
00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:45.242
then the user can think it's
instantaneous, it feels instantaneous,

13
00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:46.433
it feels quick to it.

14
00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:50.209
There's a lot of research around those
kind of paradigms of thinking of what

15
00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:51.390
site's broken or not.

16
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.400
So because this is likely going to
take longer than 400 milliseconds

17
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.950
we need to show the user
that something's happening.

18
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.160
We need to acknowledge you did something
and now I'm doing something, and

19
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.180
you need to just sit down and
wait for a second.

20
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.680
So loading spinners
are a good way of doing that.

21
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.870
So we have to go create really
quick some CSS on here.

22
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.900
I don't have any CSS,
I'm gonna call this styles.css.

23
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.240
And we talked a little bit about this,
but let's just throw in some keyframes,

24
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.739
spin to transform,

25
00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:30.560
rotate Z to 360 degrees.

26
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.150
And we're gonna have loading-spinner.

27
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.590
I'll just call it spinner.

28
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.870
Font size, 50 pixels,
that's a little bit bigger.

29
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.590
It's gonna be text align,
center, animation.

30
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.023
I'm gonna have a go for

31
00:01:56.023 --> 00:02:01.264
two seconds, spin, linear, and

32
00:02:01.264 --> 00:02:06.881
I'm missing one thing, aren't I?

33
00:02:10.302 --> 00:02:15.190
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll figure it out,
and probably should be good for now.

34
00:02:17.128 --> 00:02:21.040
And we'll have it to say display none,
initially.

35
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.082
And then whenever it's like
we put the show class on it,

36
00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:27.410
then we'll say display block.

37
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.155
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Also need infinite there,
otherwise, it just does it once and stops.

38
00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:46.120
Okay, so going back to our index.html,
I have to include my link tag up here.

39
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.090
That's gonna go to ./styles, and

40
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.500
then here underneath this
I'm gonna have a div.

41
00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.055
I'm gonna call this spinner, and

42
00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:05.090
I'm going to have it be the dog emoji.

43
00:03:10.783 --> 00:03:14.522
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
if I come back over here to my Dog Viewer,

44
00:03:14.522 --> 00:03:17.830
wherever that one is, this one.

45
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.200
Shouldn't see it, right?

46
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.415
Because I have,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I have it display none,

47
00:03:25.415 --> 00:03:27.880
right, and then I'll show it
whenever something's loading.

48
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.477
So let's go back over to our code here.

49
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:44.618
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
whenever someone calls getDoggo,

50
00:03:44.618 --> 00:03:48.724
the first thing that we're gonna do,

51
00:03:48.724 --> 00:03:57.860
we're gonna have const spinner =
document.querySelector('.spinner').

52
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:06.359
We're gonna say
spinner.classList.add("show"),

53
00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.860
no dot here, just show.

54
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.340
Okay, so

55
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.320
when everyone starts requesting an animal
then we'll show the loading spinner.

56
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.994
Then as soon as we get the data message
down here we're going to remove show.

57
00:04:28.662 --> 00:04:32.226
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So line 65 there,
and line 73, oops.

58
00:04:35.823 --> 00:04:40.397
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now hopefully if we come
over here, and I've put like a picture on

59
00:04:40.397 --> 00:04:44.332
there, you'll see that the image
here is not being hid but

60
00:04:44.332 --> 00:04:49.420
at least the loading spinner down
there is being shown, right?

61
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.514
So next thing we're gonna have
to do is we're gonna have to

62
00:04:51.514 --> 00:04:58.100
say,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: How do we wanna do this?

63
00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.230
I think we'll just do it the same way,

64
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.169
we'll have dog-img here, but
we'll also add show on this.

65
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.613
So that way we can just reuse the same
class on the styles.css, on our dog image.

66
00:05:17.714 --> 00:05:19.037
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Above show,
that's important.

67
00:05:19.037 --> 00:05:24.390
.dog-img, we'll have display none as well.

68
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.391
So if we refresh over here it
still should show the dog.

69
00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:36.114
But now, if we take away the show class,
it's gonna hide the dog.

70
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.318
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now we can say
img.classList.remove("show").

71
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.276
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Same thing down here,
except we're going to add show.

72
00:05:54.162 --> 00:05:57.248
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now hopefully
if you change it it'll hide it.

73
00:05:57.248 --> 00:05:59.884
And you can see it's
happening pretty quickly,

74
00:05:59.884 --> 00:06:07.536
but,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

75
00:06:07.536 --> 00:06:12.627
still not necessarily quite there,
but in general,

76
00:06:12.627 --> 00:06:16.710
this is kind of where
I expected you to get.
