1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.245
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So up at the top,
when we did the query selector,

2
00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:08.442
we used dot prev,
dot next to get that class name.

3
00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:12.054
But then,
down inside of the event listeners,

4
00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:15.045
I was saying remove and add dot active.

5
00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:18.102
I didn't get any errors cuz-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I

6
00:00:18.102 --> 00:00:21.338
mean,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That doesn't do what you

7
00:00:21.338 --> 00:00:22.063
want it to do, right?

8
00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:23.259
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.

9
00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.925
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Well,

10
00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:26.849
that's the name of a class, so
I have to put a period first.

11
00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.343
But apparently,
not when you are adding and removing.

12
00:00:29.343 --> 00:00:32.329
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes, so
this is a good point to bring up.

13
00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.566
Let's just take a look at what
it looks like in the HTML here.

14
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.953
Notice this is not
a class called disabled,

15
00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:40.320
it's actually an attribute on
the element called disabled.

16
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.590
So this is actually something
built into the browser.

17
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.921
Because we often have to enable and
disable buttons, right?

18
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:51.452
So we could have just made this like
a class here and called it disabled and

19
00:00:51.452 --> 00:00:54.138
worked with that and added the same style.

20
00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:57.549
This is inferior to what we've
chosen to do for two reasons.

21
00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:59.764
One, just like I was showing you here,

22
00:00:59.764 --> 00:01:04.196
I don't have to detect inside of my event
listeners if this is disabled or not,

23
00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:07.574
because it will not fire events
if it's disabled, right?

24
00:01:07.574 --> 00:01:10.869
And this works with inputs,
this works with a bunch of stuff as well.

25
00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.512
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I was talking about next and
previous, which are classes.

26
00:01:14.512 --> 00:01:15.188
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So

27
00:01:15.188 --> 00:01:18.940
when I was trying to add and remove them.

28
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.444
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So when you were saying
instead of saying classless dot add,

29
00:01:23.444 --> 00:01:26.281
you were doing something like-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: No,

30
00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:30.588
I had classless dot add,
quote, dot active.

31
00:01:30.588 --> 00:01:31.779
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Dot active, gotcha.

32
00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:33.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, and that didn't work.

33
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.314
But it didn't give me any errors,
so I was like-

34
00:01:36.314 --> 00:01:37.111
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's interesting.

35
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:40.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And it confused me because
up at the top when we did query selector,

36
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.618
we did have to put the period.

37
00:01:41.618 --> 00:01:44.952
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, it is kind of
contextual in that sense, yeah.
