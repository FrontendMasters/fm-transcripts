00:00:03.352 --> 00:00:06.762
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We just built a rotating
image gallery, so that's really cool.

2
00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:11.007
However as you might imagine, after
browsing the Internet for a little bit,

3
00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:13.761
lots of people have already
solved this problem.

4
00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:21.667
We haven't invented some
wonderful new UI pattern here.

5
00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:22.670
So in light of that,

6
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.873
there's lots of people that are actually
really happy to share their code with you.

7
00:00:26.873 --> 00:00:30.756
So that's what's really cool about
the JavaScript community, and current

8
00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:34.831
programming community in general, is we
like to share our code with each other.

9
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:37.624
I'm gonna give you my code if I can
use the code that you write as well.

10
00:00:37.624 --> 00:00:41.032
So we're gonna use one called Swiper.

11
00:00:41.032 --> 00:00:44.659
So let's actually just
open Swiper's websites.

12
00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:48.077
Swiper super swiper.

13
00:00:48.077 --> 00:00:50.372
So I have it up here.

14
00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can probably
just Google for Swiper JS, and

15
00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.200
it's gonna be this top one right there.

16
00:01:03.982 --> 00:01:06.305
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So Swiper,
most modern mobile touch slider.

17
00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:08.898
That's a lot of words.

18
00:01:08.898 --> 00:01:12.538
But what's cool about is,
I can actually click and drag this, and

19
00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:15.015
it just goes back, and
forth just like this.

20
00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:16.521
We get really cool image
galleries like that.

21
00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:20.907
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So as you can see,

22
00:01:20.907 --> 00:01:23.424
this is slightly more
complicated than what we built.

23
00:01:23.424 --> 00:01:27.412
[LAUGH] But there's nothing to say that
you couldn't build this, just you would

24
00:01:27.412 --> 00:01:31.414
need a little bit more time and a little
bit no more know how with CSS animations.

25
00:01:31.414 --> 00:01:32.323
Me too, right.

26
00:01:32.323 --> 00:01:38.601
Building these tilt animations is kind
of a unfun exercise in my opinion.

27
00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:40.873
Still, depends on who you ask.

28
00:01:40.873 --> 00:01:44.310
So I want to show you how that you
would go grab someone else's code off

29
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.407
the Internet and
integrate it into your own project, right.

30
00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:49.770
It feels a little bit like cheating,
right.

31
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.564
Because I get all this
really cool stuff happening,

32
00:01:52.564 --> 00:01:54.608
but I didn't have to write most of it.

33
00:01:54.608 --> 00:01:56.746
It's not cheating, this is actually
what you're supposed to do.

34
00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:00.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm gonna go in and

35
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.021
actually create another
new directory here.

36
00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:07.028
Cuz I don't wanna overwrite this
gallery one that I wrote, so

37
00:02:07.028 --> 00:02:09.428
I'm gonna create a new folder here.

38
00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:13.800
And I'm gonna call it gallery two,
or something like that.
