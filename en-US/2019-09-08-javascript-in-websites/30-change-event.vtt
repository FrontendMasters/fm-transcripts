WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.995
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now we wanna make it so
that, I'm not gonna show you the last

2
00:00:02.995 --> 00:00:05.911
part which is, once you request the image,
how does it display?

3
00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:08.730
Cuz I showed you how to do that, and
that's gonna be your project for today,

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.623
is the last kinda part.

5
00:00:09.623 --> 00:00:13.321
And then making it styled and look nice.

6
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:16.948
But I wanna show you what happens,
if someone selects Pekingese,

7
00:00:16.948 --> 00:00:18.774
how to fire that event listener.

8
00:00:21.502 --> 00:00:25.953
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's actually just move

9
00:00:25.953 --> 00:00:26.461
this out.

10
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:32.101
So I'm gonna move this const select
out from the function in here.

11
00:00:36.143 --> 00:00:39.240
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I have this select
out here, I have the fetch here.

12
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.374
Then what I'm gonna do down here is
I'm gonna say select.addEventListener.

13
00:00:48.374 --> 00:00:52.570
And what do I wanna listen for
with this particular event listener?

14
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.599
Well it's one that I've shown you before,
but

15
00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:59.923
it's been re-applying it somewhere else,
it's called change.

16
00:00:59.923 --> 00:01:01.382
You're basically listening for

17
00:01:01.382 --> 00:01:03.730
whenever the user changes
that to be something else.

18
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.530
So I'm gonna say change function.

19
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.878
It's gonna take in an event, right?

20
00:01:08.878 --> 00:01:10.225
We've see that before as well.

21
00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:14.965
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you write e or event?

22
00:01:14.965 --> 00:01:16.670
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: or is it r?

23
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Whatever you wanna call it.

24
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.745
I have to abbreviate
this as e cuz I'm lazy.

25
00:01:21.745 --> 00:01:26.000
And there's lots of people
that will always call that e.

26
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.970
But for clarity sake for you,
I'm putting out events just so

27
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.210
you know that's an event, okay.

28
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.590
And now I have the event, so

29
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.500
I wanna know what the value
is of what's being selected.

30
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.054
So I'll just show you here say
console.log, event.target.value.

31
00:01:55.341 --> 00:02:02.210
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now if I come over here,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

32
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.620
refresh the page, if I select Akita here,
notice that Akita comes up here,

33
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.640
or if I select Basenji,
Basenji comes up here.

34
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.759
So the event,
this is coming from the Dom, right.

35
00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:22.280
As soon as an event fires on this
particular select, it fires this event.

36
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.305
And the event.target is the select.

37
00:02:26.305 --> 00:02:32.750
You could have just as easily said
select.value here as well, right?

38
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.317
Because the event.target and
the console.log,

39
00:02:39.317 --> 00:02:43.370
select triple equals evet.target.

40
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.970
Notice that that's true, right?

41
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.430
The select is the event.target.

42
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.386
Two separate ways to, I would recommend
doing event.target cuz that's normally how

43
00:02:56.386 --> 00:03:02.060
you're gonna do it, but,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It is the event.target,

44
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.785
let's do that.

45
00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:07.827
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

46
00:03:09.393 --> 00:03:12.368
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now anytime this changes,
you're gonna get an event fired off and

47
00:03:12.368 --> 00:03:14.979
now you have what the user
actually selected.

48
00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:17.533
You seeing that come up in your console?

49
00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:20.542
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Where did you move this
select for breeds to outside of the-

50
00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:22.296
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just outside of the right?

51
00:03:22.296 --> 00:03:25.112
Just somewhere above the event listener.

52
00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:29.781
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right because if it was
in here, then it would be out of scope.

53
00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:36.368
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, now I have this but
what the hell you gonna do with it?

54
00:03:36.368 --> 00:03:39.710
[LAUGH] So,
let's look at the API docs really quick.

55
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.967
Dog API,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

56
00:03:49.967 --> 00:03:56.090
we're gonna look at the documentation,
and we wanna get a dog image by breed.

57
00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.100
Again, I'm reminding you,
ignore the sub-breed stuff for now,

58
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.790
we're just focusing on breeds.

59
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:10.200
So, there is this API here,
dog API breeds slash hound,

60
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.990
but whatever we put in here, that's what
kind of images we're gonna get back.

61
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.450
So if I just copy that,
put that in my API.

62
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.013
So if I put hound, it's gonna give me
literally every hound image that it has.

63
00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:30.350
Or if I put poodle, it's gonna give
me every poodle image that it has.

64
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.250
Let's go back in here, you can limit
how many pictures it gives you.

65
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.760
This is asking for all, and
I don't actually want all.

66
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.461
I think I just want, I think random works.

67
00:04:43.461 --> 00:04:49.220
Nope, all right,
let's figure out which one I want.

68
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:59.811
So for example, if you grab this one,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go,

69
00:04:59.811 --> 00:05:02.943
so if I put that one,
that's gonna give me a random hound.

70
00:05:02.943 --> 00:05:05.680
If I put poodle here,
it'll give me a random poodle.

71
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.076
If I put bichon there,
it should, or is it frise?

72
00:05:12.076 --> 00:05:13.124
That's what they call them.

73
00:05:15.312 --> 00:05:19.932
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, it'll give
you a frise picture right there.

74
00:05:19.932 --> 00:05:23.210
So given that, going back over to my code,

75
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.053
how am I gonna get the correct
breed of what they've selected?

76
00:05:28.053 --> 00:05:31.316
Well, it's probably gonna
look something like this.

77
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:39.185
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so I have cancelled
out log there, and I'm logging out this so

78
00:05:39.185 --> 00:05:41.413
if you just look at what it is right now.

79
00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:55.931
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Where is my,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here we go.

80
00:06:00.664 --> 00:06:04.392
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
what do I wanna replace in here?

81
00:06:06.287 --> 00:06:08.730
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Spoiler,
it's what I highlighted.

82
00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.860
[LAUGH] Well,
you remember template strings, right?

83
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.630
It's the dollar sign curly brace thing,
right?

84
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.290
So I wanna put in there,
event.target.value.

85
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.812
And now if I refresh this,

86
00:06:25.812 --> 00:06:30.180
go over to this one.

87
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.097
Notice low and behold,
there is the correct URL.

88
00:06:40.193 --> 00:06:41.989
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right,
and if I click on that,

89
00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:44.693
it should take me actually
to the correct URL.

90
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:56.440
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah?

91
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.594
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So if you put that,
if you turn that into a variable,

92
00:06:59.594 --> 00:07:03.785
you wouldn't be able use it outside
of the event listener, right?

93
00:07:03.785 --> 00:07:05.693
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
which is kind of the point, right?

94
00:07:05.693 --> 00:07:07.554
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

95
00:07:07.554 --> 00:07:10.306
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right,
because you want, you're going to,

96
00:07:10.306 --> 00:07:12.360
let's just pseudo code this out.

97
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.340
Like, what are you gonna do
once you get this at URL?

98
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:20.050
So, make URL, right, that's the first
thing we're gonna do, okay.

99
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:25.785
Then, we're going to
use the URL to change.

100
00:07:25.785 --> 00:07:29.289
Yeah, fetch right, fetch from the API.

101
00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:31.675
Once you have it from the API,

102
00:07:31.675 --> 00:07:36.081
then you gonna use the URL
to change the current image.

103
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:39.423
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You do wanna do
that all in the event listener?

104
00:07:39.423 --> 00:07:42.229
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, you can make
another function that does it too,

105
00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:43.207
that's up to you.

106
00:07:43.207 --> 00:07:46.228
I would probably make
another function to do it

107
00:07:46.228 --> 00:07:48.846
but,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think I'm just confuse

108
00:07:48.846 --> 00:07:50.862
about scope but then.

109
00:07:50.862 --> 00:07:55.586
So if I turn that,
if I set let URL equal that URL.

110
00:07:55.586 --> 00:07:57.705
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, that URL.

111
00:07:57.705 --> 00:08:02.790
So this is gonna be some URL, right?

112
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:03.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

113
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.410
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then I'm gonna call here,
getnewdoggo or something like that?

114
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:09.670
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

115
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.580
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then I
would just passing URL.

116
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

117
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:16.434
then I would have a function out
here called, get your doggo and

118
00:08:16.434 --> 00:08:18.958
that takes in a URL, and now I have it.

119
00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:19.791
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

120
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.049
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sense?

121
00:08:21.049 --> 00:08:21.735
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

122
00:08:21.735 --> 00:08:23.340
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

123
00:08:24.801 --> 00:08:32.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So yeah, I guess the other
thing you do here is show loading spinner.

124
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:39.356
Fetch on the API,
use the API as change the current image,

125
00:08:39.356 --> 00:08:42.173
stop showing loading spinner.

126
00:08:47.192 --> 00:08:48.776
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's basically
the steps you're gonna take.
