1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm gonna show you
one more library here that we can tool

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.941
around with.

3
00:00:03.941 --> 00:00:10.291
We're gonna just work on the same page to
add a little bit of physics to our page.

4
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:13.595
And luckily you're not gonna have
to do much physics programing,

5
00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:14.716
they do it all for you.

6
00:00:14.716 --> 00:00:17.001
There's one called Popmotion.

7
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.943
I think if you just search for
Popmotion JS.

8
00:00:19.943 --> 00:00:26.567
You're looking for popmotion.io and
we're gonna use Pure down here.

9
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.644
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so click on Pure.

10
00:00:30.644 --> 00:00:35.590
And if you'd look here they'd have just
a bunch of really cool animation demos for

11
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.458
you, right?

12
00:00:38.315 --> 00:00:39.750
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So like this is
the one that we're actually gonna

13
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.381
do, the Spring one.

14
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:44.459
So you can just like drag it around and
it just kinda goes back to place.

15
00:00:47.494 --> 00:00:50.344
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But you can see here all
of this stuff they just have for you,

16
00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:53.039
they wrote the libraries that
do all this kind of stuff.

17
00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.475
And you pretty much just have to copy and
paste their code and it more or

18
00:00:56.475 --> 00:00:57.134
less works.

19
00:00:58.973 --> 00:01:02.262
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So in this one you can like
play catch with yourself with a ball.

20
00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:06.054
And you can see here there's
not a lot of code to do that.

21
00:01:06.054 --> 00:01:09.151
This one you could make
your own gallery like that,

22
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:11.179
that has like more physics to it.

23
00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:13.666
Pretty fun stuff, right?

24
00:01:16.757 --> 00:01:19.165
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, if i had to write
this, this will take me forever,

25
00:01:19.165 --> 00:01:21.524
because in order to be able
to write physics like this,

26
00:01:21.524 --> 00:01:24.372
it requires a decent amount of like
math and all that kinda stuff.

27
00:01:24.372 --> 00:01:27.221
And that's not necessarily my expertise.

28
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:33.251
So what I'm gonna do here is the first
thing I'm gonna do is get started.

29
00:01:33.251 --> 00:01:36.359
So they want you to install
it through a build process.

30
00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.634
We're not gonna use
the build process right now.

31
00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:41.703
This one, install Popmotion page.

32
00:01:41.703 --> 00:01:43.883
There we go.

33
00:01:43.883 --> 00:01:50.226
So if you're on Popmotion, on the home
page, click the Get started up here.

34
00:01:53.653 --> 00:01:55.512
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then click the Install Popmotion.

35
00:01:55.512 --> 00:02:00.363
And down here you should have this one,

36
00:02:00.363 --> 00:02:04.338
the script include right here.

37
00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:12.669
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
you're just gonna copy and paste that.

38
00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:15.382
We're gonna put that,
as long as you're above my-gallery,

39
00:02:15.382 --> 00:02:17.749
it doesn't matter if it comes before or
after Swiper.

40
00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:24.273
It doesn’t have any CSS, so you don’t
have to worry too much about that.

41
00:02:24.273 --> 00:02:28.702
Okay, and so
you all are right here right now

42
00:02:28.702 --> 00:02:33.503
listening to me, so
you can use this link as is.

43
00:02:33.503 --> 00:02:38.048
If you're watching this
video in the future,

44
00:02:38.048 --> 00:02:42.134
you might have to put @8.5.0 here.

45
00:02:42.134 --> 00:02:45.978
The only reason that you might have to
do that is if they change this library

46
00:02:45.978 --> 00:02:49.958
between now, at this moment in time,
and when you're watching the video.

47
00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:53.528
The version might change, and
how it works might change.

48
00:02:53.528 --> 00:02:56.982
So just to be safe you might
wanna just drop in @8.5.0,

49
00:02:56.982 --> 00:03:00.584
that's just like the version of
the code they're working on.

50
00:03:00.584 --> 00:03:03.547
Maybe on version 10 they're gonna
change everything, I don't know,

51
00:03:03.547 --> 00:03:04.465
these things happen.

52
00:03:08.885 --> 00:03:12.289
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so now we're gonna
have, if we go back over to Swiper and

53
00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:13.589
refresh the page here.

54
00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:16.024
I go into console.

55
00:03:16.024 --> 00:03:20.187
I now have a Popmotion object
available on the global scope,

56
00:03:20.187 --> 00:03:24.446
that we can start doing some
more animation-y kinda stuffs.

57
00:03:29.391 --> 00:03:33.799
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what I wanna do
is I wanna make like a navigation

58
00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.956
header on my page here.

59
00:03:35.956 --> 00:03:39.953
And I wanna make it so that I have
a little brand, like my personal brand, or

60
00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:44.030
like an emoji up there that people can
drag around and have fun with, right?

61
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.974
So basically I wanna emulate,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Go back to this.

62
00:03:50.974 --> 00:03:52.222
I wanna emulate this, right?

63
00:03:52.222 --> 00:03:55.206
I want this to be on my navigation,
that people can play around with it.

64
00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:02.486
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go ahead and
do that, let's go add the HTML for that.

65
00:04:02.486 --> 00:04:09.161
So above your swiper-container,
here, we're gonna put a nav element.

66
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:16.632
You put your nav element there,
I'm gonna call it main-nav, = main-nav.

67
00:04:18.973 --> 00:04:22.232
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
then I'm gonna put my each h1, and

68
00:04:22.232 --> 00:04:25.924
the class here is gonna be
like whatever brand I'm.

69
00:04:25.924 --> 00:04:28.920
Yeah, like it's the main
brand of the page.

70
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.128
For now I'm gonna put an emoji here.

71
00:04:33.128 --> 00:04:36.035
So feel free to put whatever
emoji you want to here.

72
00:04:36.035 --> 00:04:40.746
I am obviously going to put the dog emoji,
because that's the most important emoji.

73
00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:44.116
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's science.

74
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:50.628
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so we have a dog
emoji there, but you can put, again,

75
00:04:50.628 --> 00:04:52.135
whatever emoji you want to put there.

76
00:04:54.074 --> 00:04:57.466
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna have to go
modify our styles.css a little bit.

77
00:04:57.466 --> 00:05:03.283
So go to your styles
down here at the bottom.

78
00:05:03.283 --> 00:05:09.895
We're gonna put body, padding 0, margin 0.

79
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.684
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: By default HTML bodies
have some margin and padding on, and so

80
00:05:15.684 --> 00:05:16.958
we just wanna to get rid of those.

81
00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.219
And then .main-nav.

82
00:05:21.251 --> 00:05:28.834
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're just gonna give
it like a nice little background color.

83
00:05:28.834 --> 00:05:29.658
I'm gonna make it black.

84
00:05:29.658 --> 00:05:31.504
You can make it whatever color you want.

85
00:05:31.504 --> 00:05:37.333
Color white, though that is not gonna make
much of a difference, but that's fine.

86
00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:43.719
Margin 0, font-family, I guess that's not
really important either, cuz I don't.

87
00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:48.614
So if you're putting text on there instead
of like an emoji, this would be important.

88
00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:51.018
So let's just go ahead and do it.

89
00:05:52.974 --> 00:05:57.568
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we'll just make the
font Arial, cuz that's on most browsers.

90
00:05:57.568 --> 00:06:02.422
Padding 15 pixels,
cuz we want it to be nice and big.

91
00:06:07.198 --> 00:06:11.788
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Brand, we're gonna add,
it's gonna be margin 0,

92
00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:17.603
font-size 50 pixels, cuz we want
the emoji to be nice and large.

93
00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.021
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then we're gonna do cursor, grab.

94
00:06:23.021 --> 00:06:24.912
So it's gonna make it look grabbable, so

95
00:06:24.912 --> 00:06:27.302
people can know that they
can click on it and grab it.

96
00:06:32.002 --> 00:06:32.556
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

97
00:06:36.975 --> 00:06:38.686
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
if you don't give this a z-index,

98
00:06:38.686 --> 00:06:40.883
it's going to be pulled
behind other elements.

99
00:06:40.883 --> 00:06:45.822
So if we give it a z-index of basically
anything, that means it won't be pulled in

100
00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:50.347
front, or it won't go behind other
elements, it'll always stay on top.

101
00:06:50.347 --> 00:06:53.577
And I'll show you what that looks like
if you don't have it on there as well.

102
00:06:53.577 --> 00:06:55.280
But for now, just put it on there.

103
00:06:59.995 --> 00:07:00.659
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

104
00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:06.269
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now,
if we come back over here and look at it,

105
00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:08.878
we have a nice little
brand here at the top.

106
00:07:08.878 --> 00:07:10.852
Notice that it's got
a little grab guy on it.

107
00:07:10.852 --> 00:07:12.167
It's not working yet, right?

108
00:07:12.167 --> 00:07:16.691
But we got a little dog header up there.
