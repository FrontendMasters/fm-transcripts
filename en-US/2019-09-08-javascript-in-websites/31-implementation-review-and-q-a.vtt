00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So again, let's just take
a look at what my version of it did.

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.640
So here's mine.

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.762
Yours has to be more beautiful than this
terrible monstrosity that I've put in

4
00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:12.516
front of you.

5
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.622
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Looks something like that.

6
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.914
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a cutie.

7
00:00:32.984 --> 00:00:38.383
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, that's

8
00:00:38.383 --> 00:00:44.029
gonna be your homework for tonight, is
to get the dog viewer working correctly.

9
00:00:47.478 --> 00:00:49.050
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is more important.

10
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.553
This is the first thing I
want you to accomplish.

11
00:00:50.553 --> 00:00:55.150
If you want to after you finish this,
do some more work on the mole game.

12
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.780
Please do that.

13
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.480
If you don't get to the mole game, or
if you're just like brain melted out,

14
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.280
that's okay too, and we'll go ahead and
write that too [COUGH] excuse me.

15
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.300
I need more coffee at this point.

16
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.545
We will accomplish that tomorrow.

17
00:01:14.477 --> 00:01:17.921
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any last questions or
anything you want me to talk about,

18
00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:19.150
anything unclear?

19
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.639
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you just go back to
your doggo JavaScript for two seconds?

20
00:01:32.332 --> 00:01:33.596
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Scroll up, or you got it?

21
00:01:33.596 --> 00:01:34.318
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, just a little bit.

22
00:01:44.647 --> 00:01:48.117
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Inside the, slightly
down the console log, the second one,

23
00:01:48.117 --> 00:01:49.390
the dog API.

24
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.761
When you go in .then .target.value, for
some reason, mine's not going blue,

25
00:01:55.761 --> 00:02:01.210
it's just staying in there and
it's a dollar sign, I mean.

26
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.118
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sir,
you need to use back ticks.

27
00:02:03.118 --> 00:02:06.625
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Thank you.

28
00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:08.579
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can do
it with normal strings, but

29
00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.734
you just have to do the plus
concatenation that I showed you earlier.

30
00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:13.665
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

31
00:02:13.665 --> 00:02:16.000
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, I just find
this to be a little bit easier.

32
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I guess.

33
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.590
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Something else, so
notice when I first show up that

34
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.404
it does display a random
dog picture right away.

35
00:02:30.404 --> 00:02:33.440
So that's something you
can do if you want to.

36
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.510
Just, what I did is instead of
having this just be fetch out here I

37
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.930
put into a function and
the first thing I do is call the function.
