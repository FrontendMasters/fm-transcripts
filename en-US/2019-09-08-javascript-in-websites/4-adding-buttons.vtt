00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.342
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's go right to buttons.

2
00:00:02.342 --> 00:00:06.634
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
under the div with all the pictures,

3
00:00:06.634 --> 00:00:11.980
I want you to create
another div called buttons.

4
00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:17.663
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And inside of buttons,
I want you to put, as you may imagine,

5
00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:18.641
two buttons.

6
00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:19.534
Button.

7
00:00:19.534 --> 00:00:25.417
Class equals button and previous.

8
00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:28.556
And then, we're gonna put prev in there.

9
00:00:28.556 --> 00:00:30.258
And then, another one,
which is gonna be next.

10
00:00:30.258 --> 00:00:34.090
And put next in there.

11
00:00:35.496 --> 00:00:37.503
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
let's go get over here in Luna Gallery so

12
00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:39.740
you can see here that
they're coming up as well.

13
00:00:42.303 --> 00:00:43.839
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, one of these buttons,

14
00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.848
since we're gonna start at
the first element, right?

15
00:00:46.848 --> 00:00:49.576
If we start at the first element,
it means you can't go back, right?

16
00:00:49.576 --> 00:00:52.447
So we're gonna have to
disable the previous button.

17
00:00:52.447 --> 00:00:55.891
Because initially, in the very first
state, you can't go back, right?

18
00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:57.135
Make sense?

19
00:00:57.135 --> 00:00:59.927
So what we're gonna do here is,
we're gonna say disabled.

20
00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:07.880
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you can see there,
now the first the Back button is disabled.

21
00:01:09.107 --> 00:01:12.801
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, what's cool about
disabling a button, we're about to hop

22
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:17.454
into the JavaScript to make this work to
browse through all of the images, right?

23
00:01:17.454 --> 00:01:22.175
If I have an event listener on the button
and then I disable the button,

24
00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:26.108
it will not fire the event listener,
even if I click on it.

25
00:01:26.108 --> 00:01:27.892
So I have to, I guess, de-disable.

26
00:01:27.892 --> 00:01:30.860
You have to enable the button for
the event listener to fire.

27
00:01:32.076 --> 00:01:36.509
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's very convenient cuz
then we don't have to keep track of that

28
00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.066
stuff.

29
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:39.588
All we have to do is disable the button.

30
00:01:39.588 --> 00:01:42.799
And it's also cool,
cuz you can see down here,

31
00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.272
that we were able to select that disabled
button just by putting colon disabled.
