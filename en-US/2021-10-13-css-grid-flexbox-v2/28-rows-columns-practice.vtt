1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.507
So we've got the right shape.

2
00:00:01.507 --> 00:00:07.110
Now we definitely don't have it lining up
here exactly right with the other boxes.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.524
That's okay.

4
00:00:08.524 --> 00:00:09.808
We'll get there in a moment.

5
00:00:09.808 --> 00:00:12.841
We just have to get all
the rest of the boxes in place.

6
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:19.095
So, now that you get a sense of what's
going on here and how this goes,

7
00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:25.778
don't worry again about exactly lining
these boxes up with the painting.

8
00:00:25.778 --> 00:00:31.714
We will get there momentarily,
but right now what I'd like for

9
00:00:31.714 --> 00:00:36.418
you to do is to take,
let's say five minutes, and

10
00:00:36.418 --> 00:00:41.906
I'd like you to go, grid dash row,
and grid dash column,

11
00:00:41.906 --> 00:00:45.838
for the rest of d, e and f, d, e, f and g.

12
00:00:45.838 --> 00:00:49.515
All four of those,
see if you can spell out the grid row and

13
00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:51.650
the grid column values.

14
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.212
And again, it's not gonna line up
perfectly, but we'll get there.

15
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.750
So specifically I'm going to tell you
whether I want the row or the column and

16
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.640
for what letter, that we won't have
any confusion mixing up columns and

17
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.496
rows and such.

18
00:01:10.496 --> 00:01:12.970
So let's start with letter d.

19
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.632
What was your answer for grid row?

20
00:01:16.632 --> 00:01:17.760
&gt;&gt; 3 slash 5.

21
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.607
&gt;&gt; 3 slash 5, absolutely right.

22
00:01:21.607 --> 00:01:26.011
So remember that we have little f and
little g over here on the end.

23
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:29.250
And so we're going to have
to span across some rows.

24
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.016
How about grid column for letter d?

25
00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:33.093
&gt;&gt; 1 slash 2.

26
00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.950
1 slash 2, exactly right.

27
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.033
That's gonna line up
right underneath a and b.

28
00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:40.187
So there we go, perfect.

29
00:01:40.187 --> 00:01:43.882
All right, how about letter e,
the row for letter e?

30
00:01:43.882 --> 00:01:44.760
&gt;&gt; 3 slash 5.

31
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.503
&gt;&gt; 3 slash 5,

32
00:01:45.503 --> 00:01:50.108
absolutely right again, because it's
gonna look exactly the same as Letter d.

33
00:01:50.108 --> 00:01:54.184
And check that out, f and g have already
all lined up exactly as we want, but

34
00:01:54.184 --> 00:01:57.540
we'll fill out the rest
of our numbers anyway.

35
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.983
So the grid column for letter e is
going to be something like 2 slash 3.

36
00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:08.853
And then when we get to f and
g, for letter f,

37
00:02:08.853 --> 00:02:13.020
we're gonna have 3 slash 4 for a row.

38
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.221
Our column is gonna be 3 slash 4.

39
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:21.472
And for letter g,
our row is gonna be 4 slash 5 and

40
00:02:21.472 --> 00:02:24.420
our column is gonna be 3 slash 4.

41
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.043
So you won't see the actual layout change,
this is another aspect of grid.

42
00:02:30.043 --> 00:02:35.469
So grid tries to guess what it is that
you want to do with this particular page.

43
00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.756
And so we have been very deliberate
about spelling out all of the values for

44
00:02:39.756 --> 00:02:44.235
our rows and columns, but
we don't necessarily need to do that.

45
00:02:44.235 --> 00:02:45.881
And as you'll see going forward,

46
00:02:45.881 --> 00:02:49.457
we'll start to drop out some of these
properties, these extra properties

47
00:02:49.457 --> 00:02:52.711
that aren't strictly needed here,
but this is good practice too.

48
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:56.473
Think about those lines and do all of the
counting and come up with the answers that

49
00:02:56.473 --> 00:02:58.980
you're looking for here for
these complex layouts.
