WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.097
We're gonna write two additional pieces
of code for that homepage that we've

2
00:00:05.097 --> 00:00:09.540
been building where we have now
the header with the navigation bar in it.

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.430
We have the mission, we have
the collections, we have the footer.

4
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.131
Now we're going to add to
that two more elements.

5
00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:20.335
We're gonna add a hero banner
across the top of the page, and

6
00:00:20.335 --> 00:00:25.990
we're going to add a featured poster or
something that is a very large image.

7
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.820
And so let's walk through how
we might go about doing that.

8
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.686
Given that we've seen the performance
of this banner across our

9
00:00:33.686 --> 00:00:38.731
various browsers and so forth,
I'm going to write some code to set

10
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:44.350
this up as a picture for this hero
banner at the top of the web page.

11
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.120
And then for that featured image,
we're gonna use source set and sizes.

12
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.763
And we'll get started with that using the
Responsive Image Breakpoints geGerator,

13
00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:57.675
which is at responsivebreakpoints.com.

14
00:00:57.675 --> 00:00:58.460
It's a free resource.

15
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.907
And as you see here on the screen,
you can upload a file and

16
00:01:02.907 --> 00:01:08.376
then you can set what resolution you
want for that particular image and

17
00:01:08.376 --> 00:01:13.120
how many sizes and
how many final images you want generated.

18
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.589
Because you can get into the ridiculous
very easily with this as we've seen.

19
00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:24.254
So, where I'm gonna do first is I'm
going to set my resolution from,

20
00:01:24.254 --> 00:01:30.415
let's say, 300 is probably good when
you actually type the numbers in.

21
00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:33.285
300 to, let's say, 1200 resolution,

22
00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:37.213
because we have a max with
a resolution of 1200 on our web page.

23
00:01:37.213 --> 00:01:42.445
300 is probably about as small
as a mobile device will need.

24
00:01:42.445 --> 00:01:43.680
We can do a size step here.

25
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.610
Let's just say 25 or so K per image.

26
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.570
You can make that smaller if you want.

27
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.080
And then for the maximum number of images,
let's just do 3.

28
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.100
We don't need to go crazy here.

29
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.990
So just give me three final images.

30
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.917
Then we can choose our image, and I'm
just gonna select mine from my desktop.

31
00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:10.825
It's in folder number 6,
chapter 6, the responsive-images.

32
00:02:10.825 --> 00:02:15.211
And if you take a look right
there in that chapter 6 folder,

33
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:20.930
you'll see an image here called
too-cool.jpg and that's the one we want.

34
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.094
Go ahead and say Open, it will upload and
then it will spit out here.

35
00:02:26.094 --> 00:02:28.390
Here's the image that I gave it.

36
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.939
And here is the bit of
code that it wrote for me,

37
00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.170
it generated three images
of different sizes.

38
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.820
And it has also given me down here
the responsive design code that I need.

39
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.260
So, remember that, of course,
those file names we could change.

40
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.187
And you need to be aware of
the path to those images,

41
00:02:50.187 --> 00:02:53.740
because that may not be the path for
your particular web page.

42
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.870
But it has very nicely written
out exactly the sizes piece.

43
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.400
It wrote out the source set piece for
you, and so forth.

44
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.517
It also writes out the way this
might look with a picture tag,

45
00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:08.620
leveraging sizes and source set.

46
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.080
I'm less impressed with that
particular little bit of code.

47
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.214
So I'm gonna write my own picture
code in just a moment for

48
00:03:16.214 --> 00:03:18.820
the other image that we're going to do.

49
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.350
So this little bit of HTML here,
you can copy that.

50
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.360
You can also download
the images right here.

51
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.980
Here's the button, Download Images.

52
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.591
And when you click that,

53
00:03:30.591 --> 00:03:34.290
it'll just download a zip file
with all the images in it.

54
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.690
And I already, of course,
have already put that in the folder for

55
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.250
you in the distribution of the files.

56
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.780
So, let's just take a look back then here.

57
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.660
We are in folder number 6,
the responsive-images.

58
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.041
We can look in the Begin folder and
look in the Image folder here,

59
00:03:53.041 --> 00:03:57.370
let me make sure, nope,
I don't have those images.

60
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.140
I have them in the End folder.

61
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.970
Yeah, okay, I'm just gonna copy
these images from my End folder,

62
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.460
drop them into my beginning
images folder here.

63
00:04:14.042 --> 00:04:19.080
There's three hero images in
addition to the too-cool images.

64
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.748
Okay, and
now I'm gonna open up index.html,

65
00:04:25.748 --> 00:04:29.490
and then I'm gonna scroll down here.

66
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.877
So just after the opening header for
this web page, just before the start

67
00:04:34.877 --> 00:04:40.270
of mission, so we're around line
27 to 28 inside of the HTML.

68
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.996
This is where we're gonna
put our hero image.

69
00:04:43.996 --> 00:04:48.241
Hero image goes here.

70
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.893
And then if you keep on scrolling
past the collection, no, actually,

71
00:04:52.893 --> 00:04:55.790
it's before the collections,
just after the mission.

72
00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:03.216
So around line 37, 38, that's where
we're gonna put the two-cool images.

73
00:05:03.216 --> 00:05:08.320
So here, let's just go ahead and
put in the code.

74
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.000
We're gonna start with another section.

75
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.460
And this one will have an id of featured.

76
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.740
And inside of this, of course, we're gonna
put in our h2 with a featured print.

77
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.339
Okay, and then after that,

78
00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:35.793
I just decided I'm gonna keep
using my figure notation here.

79
00:05:35.793 --> 00:05:38.275
Even though there's just one picture,

80
00:05:38.275 --> 00:05:41.050
let's just keep setting
this up as a figure.

81
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:49.110
So we can actually just sort of copy
an existing figure, bit of HTML here.

82
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.043
It's all the same.

83
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.723
But here, oops.

84
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.520
Here we're gonna make a few
modifications to that HTML.

85
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:11.673
So here for image, source,

86
00:06:13.494 --> 00:06:19.350
Let's just change all of this.

87
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.090
So you can copy and paste in the code
that you had from that website.

88
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.340
My code is slightly different here,
so I'm just gonna type this in.

89
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:34.630
So this is &lt;img sizes = add a min-width,

90
00:06:36.932 --> 00:06:44.444
Of 300 pixels,
display it at 33.3 viewport widths,

91
00:06:44.444 --> 00:06:50.795
otherwise display it at
100 viewpoint widths.

92
00:06:50.795 --> 00:06:58.800
And then srcset =, And
then there's a whole bunch of these.

93
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.315
So img, I actually have four
here in my example, too-cool,

94
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:12.056
How is that not finding it?

95
00:07:19.062 --> 00:07:24.252
300 wide.

96
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.680
img/too-cool, yep.

97
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.698
&gt;&gt; Is there a platform agnostic API for

98
00:07:32.698 --> 00:07:38.730
auto generating these image
sizes that you could recommend?

99
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.958
&gt;&gt; Not off the top of my head, but
it wouldn't surprise me if there was one.

100
00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:47.720
&gt;&gt; I believe I've heard a lot
of people use Cloudinary.

101
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, Cloudinary, yeah.

102
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.390
And in fact, they sponsor Responsive
Breakpoints, so that would be a good one.

103
00:08:01.685 --> 00:08:03.794
1058.

104
00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:15.691
And finally, img/too-cool-

105
00:08:15.691 --> 00:08:22.736
1200.jpg, 1200 wide.

106
00:08:22.736 --> 00:08:28.971
And then the source will
be img/too-cool- 1200.

107
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:32.316
And then we can put an alt tag.

108
00:08:32.316 --> 00:08:37.402
Remember that your alt tags should be

109
00:08:37.402 --> 00:08:42.490
descriptive of what people would not

110
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:49.230
get from that image if they
were unable to see it.

111
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.754
So in other words,
if we just said featured print,

112
00:08:51.754 --> 00:08:55.640
we're not telling a screen reader
anything that they wouldn't already see.

113
00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.415
So a better description here would be
something like close up of woman in

114
00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:04.567
sunglasses, showing eyes,
nose, and fingers over mouth.

115
00:09:04.567 --> 00:09:09.398
So that is something
that you would not get

116
00:09:09.398 --> 00:09:14.651
from that image if you
were not able to see it.

117
00:09:14.651 --> 00:09:17.521
So that is a better alt description.

118
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:23.790
And then the name of this is Too Cool for
School.

119
00:09:27.357 --> 00:09:31.890
So that's what our figure
might wind up looking like.

120
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.599
I'm gonna switch this from color7
to color6 up here on line 40 so

121
00:09:35.599 --> 00:09:39.520
that we have a different color banner
around it that looks really nice.

122
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:46.109
And if you save that, in theory when
we put it in the browser, there we go.

123
00:09:46.109 --> 00:09:51.210
So there's our featured print,
and it's Too Cool for School.

124
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.787
These are not numbered, so
as you shrink the window down,

125
00:09:54.787 --> 00:09:58.227
you will not know if it
switched to different pictures.

126
00:09:58.227 --> 00:10:03.394
But you'll notice that along the way,
we have some other issues that pop up

127
00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:08.990
here that are coming from other styles
that we've set up here in the style sheet.

128
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:13.305
Earlier we said when you got down
to a smaller dimension like this,

129
00:10:13.305 --> 00:10:15.926
we had that object position property and

130
00:10:15.926 --> 00:10:20.259
we set it to negative 150 to show
more of the bottom of the image.

131
00:10:20.259 --> 00:10:23.030
We don't need that here for
this featured print.

132
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:28.443
So that's a little piece of CSS that
we need to adjust, Probably for

133
00:10:28.443 --> 00:10:30.830
mobile devices, but
otherwise it looks pretty good, okay?

134
00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:35.670
We may wanna fiddle around with
Too Cool for School here as well.

135
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.990
Maybe we want it a little taller or
something.

136
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.352
It's part of the process,

137
00:10:41.352 --> 00:10:44.860
how much of that picture we're gonna
wind up showing here on the page.
