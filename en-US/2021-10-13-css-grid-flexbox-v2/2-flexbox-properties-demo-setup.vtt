00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.017
So if you hop into the website for
the course,

2
00:00:04.017 --> 00:00:10.157
which is at
frontendmasters.github.io/grid-flexbox-v2,

3
00:00:10.157 --> 00:00:14.282
take a look at
the Flexbox Introduction item,

4
00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:17.903
that's the first one on the list there.

5
00:00:17.903 --> 00:00:22.136
I just went through the slides that are
there, so you have a copy of the slides.

6
00:00:22.136 --> 00:00:23.485
We're gonna come back and

7
00:00:23.485 --> 00:00:27.170
revisit those momentarily when
we talk about flexbox grid.

8
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.220
And then what we're gonna look
at next is the starting CodePen.

9
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.484
So let's go on ahead and code, and we're
gonna start with this particular CodePen,

10
00:00:36.484 --> 00:00:39.820
the link is there inside of the website.

11
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.487
So what I have here is some very
simple HTML and some starting CSS.

12
00:00:45.487 --> 00:00:48.523
So let's see what we've got
here to get us started and

13
00:00:48.523 --> 00:00:52.455
then we can look at each of these
flexbox properties independently.

14
00:00:52.455 --> 00:00:56.587
Part of the problem is that we all wanna
rush into making beautiful web pages

15
00:00:56.587 --> 00:00:59.277
without understanding all
of the properties and

16
00:00:59.277 --> 00:01:01.123
values that are available to us.

17
00:01:01.123 --> 00:01:05.065
So if you build a little system like this,
that isn't supposed to be pretty,

18
00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:08.463
that's supposed to simply
demonstrate those properties to you,

19
00:01:08.463 --> 00:01:11.697
you'll get a much better sense
of how all of these things work.

20
00:01:11.697 --> 00:01:15.087
So here in my HTML,
I have a bulleted list,

21
00:01:15.087 --> 00:01:20.170
a UL followed by a bunch of LIs and
I have only two classes in here,

22
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.990
on the second and the fifth bullet,
I have a class of flex2.

23
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.809
Some of these bullets have numbers, some
of them have a little bit of text, okay.

24
00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:32.950
So very, very simple HTML to work with.

25
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.876
In our CSS, we have this set
up a little bit differently.

26
00:01:36.876 --> 00:01:39.920
First of all,
we start with the border-box model.

27
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.812
If you're not familiar with
the border-box, the way CSS is configured,

28
00:01:44.812 --> 00:01:47.995
it starts off with
a so-called content box, and

29
00:01:47.995 --> 00:01:52.512
it has to do with how we determine
the value of the CSS property width.

30
00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:57.520
Are we going to include the width of
the border and the width of the padding

31
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.288
plus the width of the content to determine
the value of that property called width?

32
00:02:03.288 --> 00:02:07.840
Or are we just gonna say it's
the width of the content itself?

33
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.351
So content-box says,

34
00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:13.586
the width of the content itself is
the value of the width property.

35
00:02:13.586 --> 00:02:17.329
The border-box says,
let's include the border and

36
00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.988
the padding as well to
determine the value of width,

37
00:02:20.988 --> 00:02:24.998
and it is much easier for
math if you use the border-box.

38
00:02:24.998 --> 00:02:27.302
And so
this is the declaration that you use,

39
00:02:27.302 --> 00:02:30.290
you simply say the box
sizing is border-box.

40
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.850
It doesn't inherit by default.

41
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.816
So the next declaration you say
universally, the entire universe and

42
00:02:36.816 --> 00:02:42.637
everything that comes before the universe
and after it, inherit the box sizing.

43
00:02:42.637 --> 00:02:44.898
And then you don't have to worry about it,
okay.

44
00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:48.085
After that,
we just have a body declaration,

45
00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:52.075
we declared a font,
we removed the margin and padding.

46
00:02:52.075 --> 00:02:54.957
Some browsers have margin,
some browsers have padding.

47
00:02:54.957 --> 00:02:59.388
It's responsible for the tiny little box
you see around the edges of web pages if

48
00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:02.965
they don't go all the way out
to the edges of the screen.

49
00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:07.567
This is the reason why, add your
margin and padding, zero those out,

50
00:03:07.567 --> 00:03:09.058
and we set a font size.

51
00:03:09.058 --> 00:03:13.321
And then here in the UL, we've turned
off our padding, we put in a little bit

52
00:03:13.321 --> 00:03:17.600
of margin to make it look pretty and
a border, we gave it a width and a height.

53
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.590
And then finally down here in our LI,
we've set up a border,

54
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.480
a background color,
a min width and a height.

55
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.460
So pretty standard stuff,
nothing exciting here so far.
