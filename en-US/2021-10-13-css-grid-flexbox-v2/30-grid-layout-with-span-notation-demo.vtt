00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.165
Let's take a look at this Mondrian
painting example one more time.

2
00:00:04.165 --> 00:00:09.917
This time, what I'd like to do is work
on a different type of syntax and

3
00:00:09.917 --> 00:00:11.977
show you how that works.

4
00:00:11.977 --> 00:00:14.629
So, rather than going
through all of the details,

5
00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.344
cuz this is the same example that we
just coded in detail using numbers.

6
00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:22.778
I'd like to just sort of slide by all of
the niceties of background colors and

7
00:00:22.778 --> 00:00:25.320
grid gaps and all the rest of that.

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.242
Let's just slide right on into
looking at the new syntax for

9
00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:33.110
each one of the positions
of these particular cells.

10
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.273
I'd also like to talk about,

11
00:00:35.273 --> 00:00:40.222
how grid is going anticipate
the layout of this webpage in advance.

12
00:00:40.222 --> 00:00:44.554
You don't actually have to spell out
the position of each one of these cells

13
00:00:44.554 --> 00:00:48.639
individually with each one of these
declarations the way we just did.

14
00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:53.018
So let's just take this one step further,
slightly different syntax,

15
00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:56.410
specifying less code,
which we always love less code.

16
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.180
And achieving the same type of layout.

17
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.796
So to get started with that,
right here on the wrapper,

18
00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:09.120
let's start with display,
grid, just like we had before.

19
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.068
And we're going to have
of course our grid,

20
00:01:14.068 --> 00:01:19.954
template, rows of 170 pixels, 210 pixels,

21
00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:26.450
61 pixels and 61 pixels,
just like we had before.

22
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.218
We're also gonna have our grid, template,

23
00:01:31.218 --> 00:01:35.862
columns of 124 pixels, 376 pixels,

24
00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:40.830
and 42 pixels, just like we had before.

25
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.236
So by specifying these in advance you see
already that grid is starting to try to

26
00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:46.990
arrange things here in space.

27
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.060
So it knows that we have four rows and
it knows that we have three columns.

28
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.178
So what it'll do right out of
the box is it'll just say, well,

29
00:01:58.178 --> 00:02:02.860
I've got seven different HTML
elements that are my children, right?

30
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.100
Here in the HTML if you take
a look at all of those dibs,

31
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.980
those are all of the children.

32
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.204
So we can simply,
just start putting one box per cell inside

33
00:02:14.204 --> 00:02:18.050
of our grid based layout
which is really nice.

34
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.020
And then of course to this,
we can add our gap.

35
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.321
And that'll be 30 pixels, 20 pixels.

36
00:02:26.321 --> 00:02:29.219
And that'll give us a little
bit of space here in between.

37
00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:33.132
So as you see here, we start off with
this type of arrangement already.

38
00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:34.657
So, as you can see right now,

39
00:02:34.657 --> 00:02:37.721
we don't even have to specify
where letter A is going to be.

40
00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:41.510
It's already in the right spot.

41
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.551
So we can actually start
here with letter C.

42
00:02:45.551 --> 00:02:48.770
And this new syntax is
gonna look like this.

43
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.156
This is going to be grid, hyphen row,

44
00:02:53.156 --> 00:02:57.140
of one slash, spanned space two.

45
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.209
So that's the way this syntax works.

46
00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.540
So rather than before, when we said
start at one and go to number three and

47
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.950
we've specified very
specifically which one of those.

48
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.750
We're gonna say start at one,
and then go across two.

49
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.308
So it's sort of more of a relative
type of layout type of thing.

50
00:03:14.308 --> 00:03:17.381
And so C will do that for us.

51
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:25.949
And of course, we need to add to this grid
hyphen column of two, slash span two.

52
00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.715
So start at two and go across two columns.

53
00:03:29.715 --> 00:03:34.099
And so that will just show up there
on the page exactly like that.

54
00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.400
So, a and
b now are already in the right places.

55
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.394
We don't need to go through and
spell them out exactly their locations.

56
00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:52.218
Likewise, when we get on down here
to something like letter d, okay?

57
00:03:52.218 --> 00:03:57.145
We can, we've got d kind of in
the right place, it's not tall enough,

58
00:03:57.145 --> 00:03:59.090
e is not tall enough.

59
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.260
And g needs to come over here to the side.

60
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.463
So here for letter d,
if we say our grid row,

61
00:04:06.463 --> 00:04:10.834
we could simply say this, span two.

62
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.810
All right, so
this is a second type of syntax.

63
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.421
And let's just compare and contrast.

64
00:04:17.421 --> 00:04:21.730
So here with letter c we said start
at line number one and span two.

65
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.938
So just figure out what the next
two lines are and the second one.

66
00:04:26.938 --> 00:04:32.630
Here, for
letter d I've said go across two lines.

67
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.152
So there's no exact starting
point just span across two lines,

68
00:04:36.152 --> 00:04:38.837
just figure out what they are and
make it happen.

69
00:04:38.837 --> 00:04:41.809
And so that's what it's done here.

70
00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:45.110
So that's a second way of
writing this type of syntax.

71
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.019
It's more relative and we're gonna
see that becomes really helpful when

72
00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:52.119
we start working on a grid system,
an actual grid system.

73
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.869
And then so for letter e,
we can do something similar here.

74
00:04:59.869 --> 00:05:06.220
A grid row of span two.

75
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.018
Okay, so that sort of puts
things in the right place.

76
00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:14.947
And now all we need to do in order to
achieve the rest of our layout is to

77
00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:18.856
put in our background colors,
take out the opacity.

78
00:05:18.856 --> 00:05:23.776
And we pretty much got our painting
done here in a lot less code just

79
00:05:23.776 --> 00:05:28.170
by specifying a few of these
particular items on the page.
