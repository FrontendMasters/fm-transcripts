1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.050
All right, so we're on to then
the mobile portion of the navigation.

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.600
And remember I said we were just
going to set these up as buttons.

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.233
I know the default these days is really
to always set your navigation as

4
00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:12.780
a hamburger button.

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.220
There's nothing wrong with that,
you can definitely do a hamburger button.

6
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.524
And I have covered that in
the advanced CSS layouts course if

7
00:00:19.524 --> 00:00:21.241
you want to check that out, and

8
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:25.952
how you can make a hamburger button with
just CSS without involving any JavaScript.

9
00:00:25.952 --> 00:00:29.950
But for today, let's make it with buttons
because this is a layouts course and

10
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.659
we can lay out some buttons here.

11
00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:34.600
We don't have that many navigation items,
and they're kind of fun.

12
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.180
They add a little bit of extra
color to the mobile display.

13
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.087
I'm just scrolling up a little bit here.

14
00:00:40.087 --> 00:00:43.862
I have two nav ul declarations here.

15
00:00:43.862 --> 00:00:47.724
I think I did this,
because this nav ul, this part of it,

16
00:00:47.724 --> 00:00:50.470
is kind of something that we always do.

17
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.210
And then this is the flex
box portion of it.

18
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.790
Absolutely you can combine
these into a single style.

19
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.860
There's no particular reason to
declare the same thing twice.

20
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.540
So there we go.

21
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.825
We haven't have one style with
all of these elements in place.

22
00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:10.604
And then we'll go on to our nav li.

23
00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:13.478
So nav lis.

24
00:01:13.478 --> 00:01:16.106
These are just sort of in general for
all of our lis,

25
00:01:16.106 --> 00:01:18.076
I'm gonna have two buttons per line.

26
00:01:18.076 --> 00:01:23.464
So we'll set our flex basis to 48% and

27
00:01:23.464 --> 00:01:29.337
we'll set our margin bottom to 0.5 rem.

28
00:01:29.337 --> 00:01:34.197
That'll give us a little bit of space in
between our buttons there at the bottom.

29
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.565
Okay, so
let's check what we've got here so far.

30
00:01:40.565 --> 00:01:44.386
I'm gonna scrunch up the screen a little
bit more to get us to the mobile kind

31
00:01:44.386 --> 00:01:45.080
of layout.

32
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.250
So there we are.

33
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.753
You can see that we have
our logo on its own line,

34
00:01:48.753 --> 00:01:50.980
which we definitely want here too.

35
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.860
And we have all of our various
hamburger button navigation items here.

36
00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.250
Okay, so let's start to turn
things red with white text.

37
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.959
So to do that,
we'll add here on our nav a.

38
00:02:11.836 --> 00:02:16.516
So I initially set this to be color one.

39
00:02:16.516 --> 00:02:19.115
I'm gonna change that now to white.

40
00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:24.586
So we have white text and
I'll set our background color

41
00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:32.395
To, I think it's color

42
00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:36.662
10, color 10.

43
00:02:36.662 --> 00:02:40.916
Nice red, so a nice red button with
a white text on top of it, okay.

44
00:02:40.916 --> 00:02:43.220
So then to this we'll
also add some padding.

45
00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:53.062
Of 0.5 rem and
we'll add a border radius, Of 5 px.

46
00:02:53.062 --> 00:02:56.891
This will match the other in the
collections portion of the webpage where

47
00:02:56.891 --> 00:02:57.778
we had borders.

48
00:02:57.778 --> 00:02:59.995
We had a 5 px radius there, and so

49
00:02:59.995 --> 00:03:03.830
we're going to add it here as
well to keep it consistent.

50
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.686
One of the signs of an amateur designer
is to have slightly different curves

51
00:03:08.686 --> 00:03:10.149
all over the web page so

52
00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:14.173
try to keep them consistent if
you're gonna make use of them.

53
00:03:14.173 --> 00:03:19.091
And then finally, text, align, center.

54
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:22.852
Okay, let's see what that looks like.

55
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.572
So great.

56
00:03:28.572 --> 00:03:32.307
We have red backgrounds for
all of our buttons, right?

57
00:03:32.307 --> 00:03:33.711
Exactly what we wanted.

58
00:03:33.711 --> 00:03:39.410
But it's also given us a red background on
our SVG, which is transparent by default.

59
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.653
So now it's time to override that.

60
00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:49.849
And so here, we can say,

61
00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.440
our nav li first child a.

62
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.877
We'll have a background
color of transparent,

63
00:03:59.877 --> 00:04:05.589
and that will fix that problem very,
very nicely.

64
00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:06.260
Much better.

65
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.562
Okay, then we want to hover state for
these.

66
00:04:16.018 --> 00:04:20.431
And so nav a hover

67
00:04:20.431 --> 00:04:25.160
background color

68
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.578
of var color 1.

69
00:04:32.311 --> 00:04:34.150
So that'll give us our black.

70
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:41.140
And a color, var color 5.

71
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.720
So yellow text on our black background.

72
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.879
So let's test that.

73
00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:54.307
So now when I mouse over our buttons,
those all look good,

74
00:04:54.307 --> 00:04:56.894
nice big contrast the changes and
so forth.

75
00:04:56.894 --> 00:05:01.925
When I mouse over the wall of wonder here,
we do not get that same hover effect.

76
00:05:01.925 --> 00:05:03.469
Why is that?

77
00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.493
Well, it has to do with specificity,
believe it or not.

78
00:05:06.493 --> 00:05:11.768
Right here on line 100 and
notice it says nav li first child a,

79
00:05:11.768 --> 00:05:17.335
and that is a more specific style,
it contains a pseudo class in it,

80
00:05:17.335 --> 00:05:22.537
the first child plus the a,
then this nav a hover declaration.

81
00:05:22.537 --> 00:05:27.948
And since we are talking about the a state
this is actually overriding the a state

82
00:05:27.948 --> 00:05:32.738
for all of the states of the link,
length visited focus hover active.

83
00:05:32.738 --> 00:05:37.110
And so when we try the more
generic navei hover over our logo,

84
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.832
it's actually overridden by this
transparent declaration that

85
00:05:41.832 --> 00:05:44.863
comes slightly earlier, which is fine.

86
00:05:44.863 --> 00:05:47.717
We really don't wanna have
a black hover on our logo anyway.

87
00:05:47.717 --> 00:05:49.510
So, it's kinda magic.

88
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.673
But that is the cascade in effect there,
cascade and specificity.

89
00:05:54.673 --> 00:05:59.673
All right, so, I think we've got our whole
nav bar together at that point then.

90
00:05:59.673 --> 00:06:03.670
So, we have a nav bar that changes
radically over the website.

91
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.379
Here we are at desktop,
logo in the middle,

92
00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:09.029
navigation spaced evenly on either side.

93
00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:12.639
As we start to pull this in.

94
00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:18.120
At some point here we wind up with a break
and our text wraps on to the next line.

95
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.184
And then when we push this
closer a little bit more,

96
00:06:21.184 --> 00:06:24.050
we wind up with buttons here on mobile.

97
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.460
And those are fully
clickable mobile areas.

98
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.940
And notice that when you hover
over the edges of the button,

99
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.477
it not only changes the hover state, but
we also still have a clickable area.

100
00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:38.728
That's because we put that
display block on our a really,

101
00:06:38.728 --> 00:06:43.517
really important for
making good usable links on mobile, okay?

102
00:06:43.517 --> 00:06:46.187
Any questions on headers, and nav bars?

103
00:06:46.187 --> 00:06:50.136
&gt;&gt; On hover on mobile,
those states wouldn't be seen, or

104
00:06:50.136 --> 00:06:53.507
seen quickly before moving
to the linked page.

105
00:06:53.507 --> 00:06:57.210
Is there a way for
the hover to be seen utilized on mobile?

106
00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.132
Yeah, with touch interaction,
you're not really gonna see a hover?

107
00:07:00.132 --> 00:07:01.656
&gt;&gt; Right.
Yeah, yeah,

108
00:07:01.656 --> 00:07:07.641
absolutely true on with a touch device of
course there is no hover state on mobile.

109
00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:10.311
And so that's just the way it is.

110
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:15.123
But you can put in the hover state
here on mobile, people may have for

111
00:07:15.123 --> 00:07:18.346
example I was using
an Apple Pencil earlier.

112
00:07:18.346 --> 00:07:23.183
Maybe you have that kind of device,
a stylus device with a small screen which

113
00:07:23.183 --> 00:07:27.200
might allow you to do some kind
of hover still on those devices.

114
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.327
But if you can't see it,

115
00:07:28.327 --> 00:07:32.112
it's actually it's one of those wonderful
graceful degradation kind of things.

116
00:07:32.112 --> 00:07:37.287
You don't have to see the hover state
in order for those buttons to work.

117
00:07:37.287 --> 00:07:39.807
But I'm sorry, there's no way that
you can hover with your finger.

118
00:07:39.807 --> 00:07:41.172
You are absolutely right.

119
00:07:41.172 --> 00:07:45.390
And we don't have a CSS state for
an equivalent type of effects for touch.
