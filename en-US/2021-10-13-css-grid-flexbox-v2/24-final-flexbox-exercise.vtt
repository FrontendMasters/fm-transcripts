00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.504
Okay, so let's go through
then these last exercises.

2
00:00:06.504 --> 00:00:10.897
So for your last exercise,
the big wrap up, the big finish here for

3
00:00:10.897 --> 00:00:15.292
flexbox, I'd like you to finish
up this particular web page, and

4
00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:20.025
I'd like you to add one final
section to this particular website.

5
00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:26.365
So I am inside of the GitHub files,
I'm inside of VS Code.

6
00:00:26.365 --> 00:00:30.011
We're looking at chapter number 7,
and I am going to go through

7
00:00:30.011 --> 00:00:33.737
the screenshots of what it is
you're going to be doing here.

8
00:00:33.737 --> 00:00:35.695
So starting with the desktop,

9
00:00:35.695 --> 00:00:39.487
this is what your web page is
going to wind up looking like.

10
00:00:39.487 --> 00:00:42.054
So right now you've got the hero image,

11
00:00:42.054 --> 00:00:46.523
we put that in place, we have our
featured print that we added as well.

12
00:00:47.623 --> 00:00:51.335
What you are going to add is
the Popular Prints section of this and

13
00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:55.186
that is right there in between
the Mission and the Featured Print,

14
00:00:55.186 --> 00:00:58.880
so that is the part of the web
page that you're gonna add.

15
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.074
And as you see here on desktop, that
is three images next to each other and

16
00:01:04.074 --> 00:01:09.010
the color needs to stretch all
the way to the edges of the page.

17
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.270
We've talked about how to
do that earlier today.

18
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.276
Then we're gonna go to the tablet here,
and

19
00:01:14.276 --> 00:01:18.930
let me just zoom in on
the Popular Prints part of this.

20
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.330
I want you to do this crazy thing right
here in the middle under Popular Prints.

21
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.047
So when we go to Popular Prints and
we go to a tablet dimension,

22
00:01:28.047 --> 00:01:32.330
that last image normally would
wrap onto the next line.

23
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.450
You'd have two on the top and one
underneath, and then a big gaping hole.

24
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.840
So instead, I'd like you to use flexbox
to make that final image here on tablet

25
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.630
dimensions, stretch all the way
across the width of the screen, so

26
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.178
you have two on top and
a big one on the bottom.

27
00:01:47.178 --> 00:01:51.490
And then finally, of course,
when we go to mobile,

28
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.906
these will just set right
on top of each other, okay?

29
00:01:55.906 --> 00:02:00.462
A lot of the code is already
there inside of the web

30
00:02:00.462 --> 00:02:04.030
page that we've been coding all day.

31
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.898
So a lot of the stuff like the figures,
and the styling, the borders, and so

32
00:02:08.898 --> 00:02:11.850
forth, a lot of that's already there.

33
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.859
But you're gonna have to write some
additional code to make these pictures do

34
00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.090
the crazy things that
I want you to do here.
