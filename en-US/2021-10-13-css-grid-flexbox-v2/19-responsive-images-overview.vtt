00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.680
So the next thing I would like to
talk about are responsive images.

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.051
And specifically, we're gonna talk about
the picture element, source set and

3
00:00:08.051 --> 00:00:11.580
sizes and we're gonna talk
about when to use each one.

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.485
The actual code for these things.

5
00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:17.375
Is just an HTML and
it is not all that difficult to write.

6
00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:19.585
And it's not that difficult to understand.

7
00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:24.357
But choosing the right HTML element at the
right moment in time is not necessarily

8
00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:26.055
all that straightforward.

9
00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:26.872
Are you Easy.

10
00:00:26.872 --> 00:00:31.179
So I wanted to talk a little bit about
these types of responsive images and

11
00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.769
give you some background so that you can
make more intelligent choices when it

12
00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.970
comes to responsive images
inside of your web pages.

13
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.120
So that's what this little
PowerPoint deck is all about.

14
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.300
So in the beginning, it was really easy.

15
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.274
We just had an image tag and
we would just put in one image and

16
00:00:47.274 --> 00:00:50.700
it would display on all the websites and
everything was just fine.

17
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.495
It was a beautiful world to live in and
we had rainbows and unicorns and ponies.

18
00:00:55.495 --> 00:00:59.354
But then we the market had to ruin it.

19
00:00:59.354 --> 00:01:02.990
And we came up with this
concept of responsive images,

20
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.969
which makes us ask a whole bunch of
different questions when it comes to what

21
00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:11.465
kind of image should be
displaying on which device.

22
00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:14.383
So first of all,
you have many content choices.

23
00:01:14.383 --> 00:01:17.238
One of those might be the so
called Art direction.

24
00:01:17.238 --> 00:01:21.190
A lot of people when they write about
responsive images, they talk about art

25
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.153
direction, but we never really have
any idea what they're talking about.

26
00:01:25.153 --> 00:01:29.088
I'm going to demonstrate for you what
art direction is here in just a moment.

27
00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:34.311
You might be thinking about the format
of your image, because there are so

28
00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:39.520
many where's GIF, JPG and PNG,
which we've had for years.

29
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.500
SVGS are a relatively recent addition, of
course for illustration types of things.

30
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.935
But now we're just about to come up with
a whole new suite of image formats, AVIF,

31
00:01:48.935 --> 00:01:52.535
web P, and there's several others
that are coming down the pipe,

32
00:01:52.535 --> 00:01:54.870
you may need to think about pixel density.

33
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.125
So, you have retina images, for
example, on Apple devices or

34
00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:04.440
you have some other different type
of pixel densities on other devices.

35
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.527
So are you serving up the right image
with the right pixel density to

36
00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:08.910
the right device?

37
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.650
What dimensions is the image
going to display at?

38
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.500
Sometimes we have images that are quite
large that we display in a small space.

39
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.972
Hopefully we don't go the other way
around to the images look terrible.

40
00:02:20.972 --> 00:02:24.624
So we need to know what size will
that image display on the web page,

41
00:02:24.624 --> 00:02:28.095
it'll actually affect your performance and
how things look.

42
00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:29.394
And then finally,

43
00:02:29.394 --> 00:02:34.354
who is going to choose what image you
use at any particular point in time?

44
00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:37.990
Do you want to make those
choices as the web page author?

45
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.061
Or are you okay with letting
the browser decide and

46
00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:45.022
we're gonna take a look at that in
a little bit of detail as well.

47
00:02:45.022 --> 00:02:50.291
So a lot of these things are outlined
in audios manies fabulous book

48
00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:56.889
image optimization, which came out in
April of 2021 from Smashing Magazine.

49
00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.066
It's a great book, it's 528 pages so

50
00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:03.124
if you thought there wasn't that much
to know about images, you're wrong.

51
00:03:03.124 --> 00:03:07.661
There's a ton to know about images,
it has information about HTML, CSS, and

52
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:10.983
all kinds of JavaScript and
performance implications.

53
00:03:10.983 --> 00:03:13.896
So, what I'm gonna talk
about here is a tiny,

54
00:03:13.896 --> 00:03:16.670
tiny subset of everything
you need to know.

55
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.704
I encourage to check his book for
more information.

56
00:03:19.704 --> 00:03:24.034
So the brief history of response
of images of this, in May 2010,

57
00:03:24.034 --> 00:03:27.468
Ethan Marcott defines what
a responsive image is, and

58
00:03:27.468 --> 00:03:31.390
then from 2010 to 2014,
it was just a disaster.

59
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.423
We had a big disaster where
response of images were concerned.

60
00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:39.445
There were server side solutions for
serving up different images under certain

61
00:03:39.445 --> 00:03:42.880
conditions, there were client
side images driven by JavaScript.

62
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.466
There were paid solutions.

63
00:03:44.466 --> 00:03:45.678
There were free solutions.

64
00:03:45.678 --> 00:03:47.892
There was all kinds of different things.

65
00:03:47.892 --> 00:03:50.710
But that was the time when
everybody was talking about it.

66
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.980
Seeing what a responsive image was,
we had to define some standards.

67
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.626
And then finally in 2016, the picture
element was the first one that was

68
00:03:59.626 --> 00:04:03.764
supported by the big four web browsers,
Firefox, Chrome, edge,

69
00:04:03.764 --> 00:04:07.190
and Safari all supported
picture at that point in time.

70
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.007
And then as I mentioned a little
bit earlier in 2017, source set and

71
00:04:12.007 --> 00:04:16.260
sizes were released as part of
edge meaning that all of the major

72
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.240
browsers supported those
attributes as well.

73
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.605
And so now here we are in 2021, we have
different solutions available to us for

74
00:04:26.605 --> 00:04:33.480
responsive images that are all free,
that are HTML driven that are very good.

75
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.756
And so it's a great place to be finally
11 years after the beginning of

76
00:04:36.756 --> 00:04:37.750
responsive design.
