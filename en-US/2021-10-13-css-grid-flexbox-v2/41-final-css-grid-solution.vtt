00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.995
So I hope you had fun with
that particular exercise,

2
00:00:02.995 --> 00:00:07.480
building your own inside page based on
some of the materials that I gave you.

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.616
I'm gonna talk through my particular
answer using the mosaic style layout and

4
00:00:11.616 --> 00:00:15.110
then we had that one grid cell
that had the text inside of it.

5
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.060
So let's take a quick peek into
how I'd put that page together.

6
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.437
In the HTML, what I've done is
recycled the headers that I had from

7
00:00:23.437 --> 00:00:29.120
the previous layout of the website and
all of the CSS that went along with that.

8
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.042
So that is the header and I kept down here
the footer of the webpage as well which we

9
00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:36.773
coded in the Flexbox
portion of the course.

10
00:00:36.773 --> 00:00:40.743
These two particular layouts, the header
and the footer, work really well

11
00:00:40.743 --> 00:00:44.651
in Flexbox, I didn't really feel a need
to recode those inside of grid, so

12
00:00:44.651 --> 00:00:45.911
I just left them alone.

13
00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:50.644
The concept of a series of rows stacked
on top of each other worked with

14
00:00:50.644 --> 00:00:53.429
this particular design of the website.

15
00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:55.789
So I kept that concept as well.

16
00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.751
And so that meant that here
inside of the content portion of

17
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:05.350
this web page,
I've set it up in the following way.

18
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.010
So I have a section,
I give it an ID of donut.

19
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.240
Here is the title of that section,
Sharon McCutcheon: Donut Love.

20
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.870
And then we have a series of images inside
of an unordered list as you would expect.

21
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.731
So here's my unordered list.

22
00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:22.995
I have a list item,

23
00:01:22.995 --> 00:01:27.580
I've given them a class of D1 to D5
as in donut 1 to donut number 5.

24
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.669
And we have images here with
the images themselves and

25
00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:38.270
then the description that goes with them
and the descriptions are all the same.

26
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.018
They're just donuts with sprinkles.

27
00:01:40.018 --> 00:01:48.050
Inside of number 3,
I added a div with a class of author.

28
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.514
It's an h3 for that particular heading
along with that particular text and

29
00:01:52.514 --> 00:01:55.620
the links and so
forth are all inside of it.

30
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.949
That div with the class of author,
once again,

31
00:01:59.949 --> 00:02:05.480
as always, managing our parents and
children here.

32
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.108
We have that div and
we have then after it the image.

33
00:02:11.108 --> 00:02:15.725
So that means that within this li,
we can use grid to orient the text and

34
00:02:15.725 --> 00:02:17.774
the image on top of each other.

35
00:02:17.774 --> 00:02:21.797
And then they can separate
at smaller screen sizes.

36
00:02:21.797 --> 00:02:26.315
So that's the the technique that I use
here with the overlapping grid cells.

37
00:02:26.315 --> 00:02:29.524
All the rest of them
are pretty much the same,

38
00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:32.410
the li with the donut image inside of it.

39
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.849
Now let's look at the CSS.

40
00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.099
And so here in the CSS, all right,
so here in the CSS outside

41
00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.080
of all of the media queries,
we have the following.

42
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.840
So I have a donut image.

43
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.920
I set that to its hack of a width of 100%.

44
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.790
The ul winds up being my grid parent or
the grid container.

45
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.820
And the li's wind up being my grid items.

46
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.948
So here outside of the media queries,
all I've said is display

47
00:03:02.948 --> 00:03:07.730
as grid with a 1 rem gap and
one single column of 1fr wide.

48
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.910
That's all I did here.

49
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.153
And specifically for d3,
I set it on its own row, so

50
00:03:14.153 --> 00:03:20.110
make sure it displays on the first
row of that particular cell.

51
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.059
Then as we go into the media queries,

52
00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:28.700
down around line 476 in the CSS,
this is where all of that starts.

53
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:36.576
So here for the donut ul, I've set up my
two columns with a minimum of 100px s and

54
00:03:36.576 --> 00:03:42.190
a maximum of 1fr because I want
my donuts to be big enough.

55
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.698
And then I've spelled out exactly where I
want each one of those images to display.

56
00:03:46.698 --> 00:03:49.474
So I'm not anticipating
an unknown number of images.

57
00:03:49.474 --> 00:03:51.230
This is an art site, I have five images,

58
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.257
those are the five that
we're gonna display.

59
00:03:53.257 --> 00:03:57.553
And I've set them up to display
in a lovely sort of way.

60
00:03:57.553 --> 00:04:02.212
So the interesting part of all of
this winds up being d3 which is,

61
00:04:02.212 --> 00:04:07.651
as I've told you is possible before,
both a grid item and a grid container.

62
00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:12.880
So, the first two, the grid column and
the grid row, make it a grid item and

63
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.611
that's indicating where it's gonna
display in the grid pattern.

64
00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:23.410
And then inside of d3, we also have its
own grid where we have one column and

65
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.190
one row as I have showed you before.

66
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.496
So the d3 image and the author will
both occupy that same single row and

67
00:04:33.496 --> 00:04:36.830
the single column that I had set up.

68
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.648
Then I give my image an opacity of 0.2
such that my text becomes readable,

69
00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:46.339
and the image just sort of whites out
a little bit there in the background.

70
00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:50.563
And then make sure that the author text
shows up on top, give it a little bit of

71
00:04:50.563 --> 00:04:55.660
padding, give it as the index so it shows
up on top of the image and not behind it.

72
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.420
That's really important.

73
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.785
When you take a look at this because
of the opacity without the z-index,

74
00:05:01.785 --> 00:05:03.584
let me show you what happens.

75
00:05:06.356 --> 00:05:11.310
If we just did that much there, let me
show you this in the default browser.

76
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.747
So this is coated up with a couple
of links, but notice that because of

77
00:05:15.747 --> 00:05:20.430
the opacity of the image, it looks
like you can read this text just fine.

78
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.449
It's no big deal, but
the links are unclickable

79
00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:29.250
unless you add that bit of CSS there.

80
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:37.355
So if we put in that z-index and
then refresh our web page,

81
00:05:37.355 --> 00:05:41.080
now those become clickable links.

82
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.315
So even if it looks right,
make sure you test it.

83
00:05:45.315 --> 00:05:48.250
[LAUGH] Make sure you can
mouse over those links.

84
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.610
Make sure that they
are actually clickable.

85
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.380
Otherwise you need to adjust your z-index
