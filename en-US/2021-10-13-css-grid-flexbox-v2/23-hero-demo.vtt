00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.992
So while we're here let's go ahead and
write the picture tag up here at the top.

2
00:00:07.992 --> 00:00:12.419
So where it says hero image goes
here around line 28 in your HTML.

3
00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:14.724
Let's put in our picture element.

4
00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:19.403
So here I am making the choice as to
which picture will display at which

5
00:00:19.403 --> 00:00:20.463
point in time.

6
00:00:20.463 --> 00:00:26.376
So here we're gonna say section Id=hero.

7
00:00:35.098 --> 00:00:36.921
And then inside of this we'll say picture.

8
00:00:41.544 --> 00:00:45.258
And inside of that then we
can put all the good stuff.

9
00:00:45.258 --> 00:00:49.849
So we start with source set,
source source set,

10
00:00:52.711 --> 00:01:01.561
Image/hero-1200.png And

11
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:07.988
then media equals quote, parentheses,

12
00:01:07.988 --> 00:01:12.769
min-width of 839 pixels.

13
00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:14.951
How did I come up with all this?

14
00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:19.010
Mostly I wrote this webpage and I played
around and decided what looked good,

15
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.081
where and so forth.

16
00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:23.820
So there's no magic bullet as
to how this stuff is gonna go.

17
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.169
We just kinda have to play around and
make some decisions.

18
00:01:33.198 --> 00:01:34.258
Here's another one source set.

19
00:01:34.258 --> 00:01:37.089
This one is gonna be 838.

20
00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:46.538
.png and this will have
a minimum width of 301 pixels.

21
00:01:46.538 --> 00:01:52.458
And then we'll have our default image down

22
00:01:52.458 --> 00:01:58.543
here at the bottom c = image/hero.300

23
00:01:58.543 --> 00:02:02.489
will be our default image and

24
00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:08.583
then alt will be Rainbow
hero image banner.

25
00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:11.633
Probably come up with a better
description for that.

26
00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:17.878
Okay, and if we save that,
To refresh our page,

27
00:02:17.878 --> 00:02:22.234
there's the hero image up there at the top
of the page for the wall of wonder.

28
00:02:22.234 --> 00:02:28.056
And we can squash that down, and
you actually will see it jump there.

29
00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:30.345
So see how I'm squashing it and

30
00:02:30.345 --> 00:02:35.023
then I when I get to my breakpoint
wherever it was, there it is.

31
00:02:35.023 --> 00:02:37.242
Now it just loaded in another image.

32
00:02:37.242 --> 00:02:40.719
That's the smaller version of the image,
okay?

33
00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:44.017
We have other things going on or
navigation is changing and

34
00:02:44.017 --> 00:02:45.103
all the rest of it.

35
00:02:45.103 --> 00:02:48.827
But one of the things you'll notice is I
make that window smaller there with that

36
00:02:48.827 --> 00:02:49.724
picture element.

37
00:02:49.724 --> 00:02:54.491
Notice that the image itself,
like all the other images on the page have

38
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:59.435
that width of 100% set so that it
scales down without those big jumps.

39
00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:04.171
And this picture element does not
have that because it has different

40
00:03:04.171 --> 00:03:08.824
codes associated with it,
then does the image tag which is used for

41
00:03:08.824 --> 00:03:11.005
displaying everything else.

42
00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:15.954
So we can make some more
modifications to this in

43
00:03:15.954 --> 00:03:20.915
RCSS to get rid of those
big jumps along the way.

44
00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:23.039
So if we do that, we'll jump into our CSS.

45
00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:26.320
Just gonna go into
the finished style sheet here.

46
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.145
And I will show you

47
00:03:32.108 --> 00:03:35.663
Here we go, some of the hero styles.

48
00:03:44.548 --> 00:03:47.517
So let's put this in after the navigation,

49
00:03:47.517 --> 00:03:52.652
just to sort of keep our CSS in the order
of the things that appear on the page,

50
00:03:52.652 --> 00:03:58.528
so I'm around line 124 in my CSS, and I'm
going to add two additional styles here.

51
00:03:58.528 --> 00:04:03.191
So to the hero section itself,
I'll set a background

52
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:07.969
color with color seven,
which I think is a gold color.

53
00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:10.836
Text align center max width of 100%.

54
00:04:10.836 --> 00:04:13.051
Turn off the padding and the margin.

55
00:04:13.051 --> 00:04:16.944
And then for the hero image,
see how I'm handling this one?

56
00:04:16.944 --> 00:04:23.302
So I have a max width of 100% and
I have a max height of 454 pixels.

57
00:04:23.302 --> 00:04:24.652
How did I come up with that?

58
00:04:24.652 --> 00:04:28.861
Well, when we get to
the 1200 pixel wide picture,

59
00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:33.538
that's 1200 pixels wide and
it's 454 pixels tall.

60
00:04:33.538 --> 00:04:39.923
So I've taken that tallest dimension and
set that as my max height,

61
00:04:39.923 --> 00:04:44.527
we don't really want it
to get bigger than that.

62
00:04:44.527 --> 00:04:52.080
And then just set the max width
accordingly to 100% so that can scale.

63
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.233
So when I save this and
I drop it into a web page and refresh,

64
00:04:53.233 --> 00:04:53.883
there's my background color.

65
00:04:53.883 --> 00:04:56.627
And now when I scratch
the screen down here.

66
00:04:56.627 --> 00:04:59.263
See how much nicer and smoother that is.

67
00:04:59.263 --> 00:05:06.209
So much better, okay?

68
00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:10.995
So the key takeaway here is, yes,
we're using the responsive images,

69
00:05:10.995 --> 00:05:15.233
absolutely, which are loading in
at different points in time so

70
00:05:15.233 --> 00:05:19.391
that we can get smaller file sizes
at the appropriate points and

71
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:23.728
potentially with art direction,
not in this specific example.

72
00:05:23.728 --> 00:05:25.060
But it could happen.

73
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.817
And we're combining it with sort of that
little hacky thing that I told you about

74
00:05:29.817 --> 00:05:32.519
to make that transition very, very smooth.

75
00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:37.826
Just in case somebody winds up close to
the edge or maybe they resize the browser.

76
00:05:37.826 --> 00:05:40.542
It won't be a jarring experience
as they're looking at that

77
00:05:40.542 --> 00:05:41.670
particular hero image.
