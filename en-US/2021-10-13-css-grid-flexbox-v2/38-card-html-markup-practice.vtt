00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.456
This last example that I'd like to go
through is card based layouts, but

2
00:00:04.456 --> 00:00:06.868
we're really gonna shake things up and

3
00:00:06.868 --> 00:00:10.904
push cards probably farther than
you have looked at them before.

4
00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:15.308
So what I'm going to do first is,
I'm gonna talk through some of the HTML

5
00:00:15.308 --> 00:00:18.070
that might be used to
put this card together.

6
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.889
Just so to show you how you can think
through the most semantic markup that

7
00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:27.787
you might be using on that, and then
we're going to mix up both Flexbox and

8
00:00:27.787 --> 00:00:32.692
grid, then dealing with these cards and
this layout on our next CodePen.

9
00:00:32.692 --> 00:00:37.651
So as always, the starting CodePen is
available inside of the chapter 14

10
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:40.340
on the website for the course.

11
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.324
So let's start here and
we have a series of four items here for

12
00:00:45.324 --> 00:00:47.587
this particular webpage.

13
00:00:47.587 --> 00:00:50.703
And they all have the same
type of content, so

14
00:00:50.703 --> 00:00:53.497
I'm just gonna focus on this first one.

15
00:00:53.497 --> 00:00:57.162
And then I'll give you a few
minutes to code the other three.

16
00:00:57.162 --> 00:00:59.218
So let's look at what we have here,

17
00:00:59.218 --> 00:01:02.300
what we have given been
given here in our notations.

18
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.561
So we have a section with an ID of
artists, this might eventually be

19
00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:11.354
something you wanna plug into either
the page that you are looking at here,

20
00:01:11.354 --> 00:01:14.115
the homepage that we've been working on.

21
00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:18.620
It might become part of the inside page or
an additional page in this website.

22
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.756
So let's set it up from the start with
that section with an ID of artists.

23
00:01:22.756 --> 00:01:27.673
And I've given that section a heading
because sections require headings and

24
00:01:27.673 --> 00:01:32.600
we're given an h2 because there's
likely an h1 elsewhere on the website.

25
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.678
After that, then we have basically these
units of content that have almost no

26
00:01:38.678 --> 00:01:40.190
markup in them.

27
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.950
So I have here the words mixed media.

28
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.700
Anny Ronky,
I'm sorry if I pronounced your name wrong.

29
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.779
Anny Ronky, the image and

30
00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:55.010
then a little bit of a description
with a link to annyronky.com.

31
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.295
So how are we going to go
about marking this up?

32
00:01:59.295 --> 00:02:04.562
This is reflective of a trend that we have
seen quite a bit in cards where often

33
00:02:04.562 --> 00:02:09.605
those words mixed media or teensy tiny,
they're at the top of the card.

34
00:02:09.605 --> 00:02:14.558
And then Anny Ronky who is the focus
of this card would be enlarger

35
00:02:14.558 --> 00:02:17.485
type because this is our artists.

36
00:02:17.485 --> 00:02:22.250
That's the main Identifier of
this section of the website.

37
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.680
Anny Ronky is an artist, so
she's the next most important thing.

38
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.860
And the fact that she works in mixed
media is the third most important thing.

39
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.703
So that would indicate in terms of our
headings that our artists is the h2,

40
00:02:38.703 --> 00:02:43.803
Anny Ronky would be the h3 and
mixed media winds up being the h4,

41
00:02:43.803 --> 00:02:49.040
but it does mean it looks like
those headings are out of order.

42
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.289
And that's okay, you can in fact put your
headings out of order if you're trying to

43
00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.840
tell the story in the way
that I just told you.

44
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.634
Our artists, Anny Ronky, mixed media.

45
00:02:58.634 --> 00:03:03.529
So let's start by putting
in that particular markup.

46
00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:08.835
This will be mixed media is the h4 here.

47
00:03:10.544 --> 00:03:14.062
And then Anny Ronky will be the h3.

48
00:03:18.863 --> 00:03:23.780
Okay, then we're going to
have our image here in place.

49
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.834
I've given you the image because here in
CodePen, you have to have the pro version

50
00:03:27.834 --> 00:03:31.910
of CodePen in order to host images and you
would know what the URL was for the image.

51
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.083
So I've given you that
along with the old text.

52
00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:35.916
After that,

53
00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:41.100
we have a bit of text here that is
the description of what's going on here.

54
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.120
This description of the artist.

55
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.900
That of course is just a paragraph.

56
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.802
So we'll mark that up as such.

57
00:03:47.802 --> 00:03:50.930
And then I just put in the words
down here on the bottom,

58
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.059
be sure to link to this website,
that's her website.

59
00:03:54.059 --> 00:04:01.218
So we'll just mark that up and we can
say something like, make it a paragraph.

60
00:04:01.218 --> 00:04:07.746
And then nahref = 'HTTPS'.

61
00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:13.948
www.annyronky.com We'll

62
00:04:13.948 --> 00:04:17.489
make it open in a new window,
target equals underscore blank.

63
00:04:23.316 --> 00:04:31.280
Underscore blank and then we can
say visit website slash A, slash P.

64
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.000
Okay, so that's sort of the general markup
of the text that we've been given here.

65
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.026
Now, we need to think a little bit
more about how we would mark up or

66
00:04:43.026 --> 00:04:48.070
indicate that this is one unit of text,
whatever that unit happens to be.

67
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.578
So many of you are probably thinking,
well, we should take all of this and

68
00:04:51.578 --> 00:04:54.240
we should probably just wrap,
div around it.

69
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.890
That would be one approach.

70
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.960
But I think we could argue that we're
a little bit more specific here.

71
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.840
This chunk of information could
potentially show up on a syndication feed.

72
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.072
And it stands alone and
tells its own story,

73
00:05:07.072 --> 00:05:10.340
we can see that this is a mixed
media thing at Anny Ronky's work.

74
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.450
Here's an example of her work.

75
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.230
Here's a little bit of
information about her.

76
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.951
There's a whole little mini-story
in this chunk of content.

77
00:05:15.951 --> 00:05:19.200
And if that's the case,
then you can make use of the article tag.

78
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.352
So we'll start this with article and
we'll end it with slash article.

79
00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:35.190
Okay, so that is my thoughts on how
we would go about marking this up.

80
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.300
And as always, good markup is the best
way to start this type of thing.

81
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.225
You can go through and
mark up all the rest of these,

82
00:05:42.225 --> 00:05:44.753
then we'll go on to
the styling after that.

83
00:05:51.458 --> 00:05:55.404
Now, we're gonna take
a quick peek at my markup.

84
00:05:55.404 --> 00:05:58.785
It looks pretty much
exactly like the first one.

85
00:05:58.785 --> 00:06:03.169
It's just a series of articles
that I have here on this web page.

86
00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.681
So the next thing that I need to think
about is, as I keep telling you the whole

87
00:06:07.681 --> 00:06:12.971
way through this course, the whole secret
of managing layout, whether you're working

88
00:06:12.971 --> 00:06:17.930
with Flexbox or you're working with get
grid, is managing parents and children.

89
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.880
One of the things that
we're going to need to

90
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.601
do in this website is treat each of
these particular units of content.

91
00:06:25.601 --> 00:06:27.994
In this case,
they happen to be the articles.

92
00:06:27.994 --> 00:06:31.210
We wanna make sure that we can
grab onto those articles and

93
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.140
manipulate them in whatever way
we want in terms of layout.

94
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.580
Then we might also manipulate what goes
on inside of the article for its layout.

95
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.708
So we've got two types of layouts that
we might be working on here with these

96
00:06:44.708 --> 00:06:45.830
particular cards.

97
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.087
So let's take a quick peak
at how our parents and

98
00:06:50.087 --> 00:06:53.099
children are configured
inside of our HTML, and

99
00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:57.590
see if we need to add anything before
we move on to the layout side of this.

100
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.867
So, here in CodePen, if you go to
the little down arrow next to the HTML and

101
00:07:02.867 --> 00:07:08.164
you say fold all, I had problems
getting this working in Firefox myself.

102
00:07:08.164 --> 00:07:10.999
But seems to be working in Chrome,
which is what I'm using now.

103
00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:12.901
It seems to be working there better.

104
00:07:12.901 --> 00:07:16.051
You fold it all up,
it folds all into the single section

105
00:07:16.051 --> 00:07:19.420
element which contains
everything we're working with.

106
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.336
If you hit the down arrow once,

107
00:07:21.336 --> 00:07:25.772
it'll show you that we now have
the following children of the section.

108
00:07:25.772 --> 00:07:30.070
We have the h2 and
we have our four articles.

109
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:35.048
So that means that if I
was to do something here

110
00:07:35.048 --> 00:07:39.371
in my CSS and say, let's say artists,

111
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:44.750
the artist's ID here,
and I said display grid.

112
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:53.110
What would happen is, and
let's say grid, template, columns.

113
00:07:53.110 --> 00:08:00.413
And let's say I wanted to do something
like, repeat four comma 1fr,

114
00:08:03.517 --> 00:08:07.700
The h2 becomes part of this
particular issue here on the webpage.

115
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:14.350
See that, because the age two is a child
of artists as are all of these articles.

116
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:20.550
So even though, I just said,
make four columns, grid will do its best.

117
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.574
It says, okay, I made four columns and
I put in the h2 and

118
00:08:23.574 --> 00:08:26.160
the first three articles
into those columns.

119
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.930
Oops, I have an extra item.

120
00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.650
I'll add another row and I'll start
populating my columns from there.

121
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:35.450
So that is exactly what just happened
with this particular layout.

122
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:36.658
Then around that problem,

123
00:08:36.658 --> 00:08:39.840
we're going to have to group
together our articles in some way.

124
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.280
So you actually don't
need that CSS at all.

125
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.900
We're not gonna use it.

126
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:49.702
What we'll add to this then
is a div with a class of,

127
00:08:49.702 --> 00:08:53.071
I've just called it article wrap.

128
00:08:56.076 --> 00:09:00.040
And because that's the whole purpose
is to wrap around this article.

129
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.728
It serves no purpose whatsoever
in communicating anything about

130
00:09:04.728 --> 00:09:09.326
this web page, the whole purpose
of this div is to hold a class and

131
00:09:09.326 --> 00:09:15.070
to give us an environment for laying out
our cards in some method or another.

132
00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:19.806
So that is the last thing that we need to
add to our HTML before we're ready to move

133
00:09:19.806 --> 00:09:22.080
on and do some styling to what we have.
