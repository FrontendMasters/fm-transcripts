00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.175
Because grid allows cells to overlap
each other, there's more that you can do

2
00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:09.670
here besides just what I just showed
you with figure and figure caption,

3
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.668
overlapping cells and
putting in a little bit of transparency.

4
00:00:13.668 --> 00:00:20.040
And the 11 bonus code pen, which is
available from the website here I have,

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.100
an actual animation that's going on here.

6
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:31.110
And we have, in this case, two images of
cats that are fading one into the other.

7
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.880
And I have coded this with CSS grid,
and CSS animation.

8
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.232
So I'll just talk you through a little
bit about how this is set up so

9
00:00:40.232 --> 00:00:42.400
you can see how this is done.

10
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.668
I'm not saying it's a perfect solution or

11
00:00:44.668 --> 00:00:49.017
a beautiful solution, clearly there we
could add some UI here with something like

12
00:00:49.017 --> 00:00:53.060
JavaScript to give a user more
control over what's going on.

13
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.480
But this is just to generate some interest
in overlapping grid cells and to get you

14
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.645
thinking about other ways that you might
be able to use them in your own work.

15
00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:05.874
So here we have in our HTML,
we have two figures and

16
00:01:05.874 --> 00:01:10.190
I've given one of them a class of cat1.

17
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.780
And they're basically set up the way that
you've seen figures set up throughout

18
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.155
this course we have an image,
and we have a figure caption,

19
00:01:18.155 --> 00:01:19.857
just as you've seen before.

20
00:01:19.857 --> 00:01:25.138
So what we're doing here
In our HTML is here

21
00:01:25.138 --> 00:01:30.272
at cat1 that is going
to be our wrapper for

22
00:01:30.272 --> 00:01:34.090
this particular animation.

23
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.968
So this is the figure itself,
we're adding the animation so

24
00:01:38.968 --> 00:01:42.900
on the wrapper we have
a layout that's going on.

25
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.320
That's right here display
grid with a gap of 1%.

26
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.367
And then I have said for
my figures, I overlap them,

27
00:01:53.367 --> 00:01:57.530
both figures take the same style here.

28
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.760
Where I've said the grid row and
the grid column are exactly the same.

29
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.799
It's a one cell grid, one column, one row,
and these are gonna overlap each other and

30
00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.530
I set a width on it
because this is an image.

31
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.930
Notice too I've added a property
here called justify-self center and

32
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.430
that is a grid property that
allows this fixed width piece of

33
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.290
content to center itself in
the middle of that particular self.

34
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.380
Then on cat1, I can just fill in
the kind of animation that I want.

35
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.318
So what I'm really doing here, is I'm
fading in and out the cat that's on top,

36
00:02:36.318 --> 00:02:38.660
cat1 that fades in and out.

37
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.088
And the other cat is up there
on the screen the whole time,

38
00:02:42.088 --> 00:02:44.873
but because the first cat is fading in and
out,

39
00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:48.599
it looks like they are alternating
even though they're not.

40
00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.130
If you're not familiar with CSS animation,
this isn't a CSS animation course.

41
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.265
But I'll just briefly sort of tell
you what these properties are and

42
00:02:56.265 --> 00:02:57.780
what they do.

43
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.280
First of all we wanna give this
animation a name I've called it fade.

44
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.976
And the reason you give it a name is
because you're gonna attach it to what's

45
00:03:06.976 --> 00:03:08.905
down here this keyframes part of this.

46
00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:13.369
And this is the instructions for what
it should be doing at each point along

47
00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:17.264
the path in the animation,
I'll explain that in just a moment.

48
00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:21.619
So I've given it a one second delay to
start, the reason I do that is because we

49
00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:26.140
wanna give these images a chance to
load in before the animation starts.

50
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.701
We can say how long we want
the animation to last,

51
00:03:28.701 --> 00:03:31.170
in this case I've said five seconds.

52
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.148
And then we have some things about
the animation film mode said both

53
00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:40.049
the iteration count infinite, in other
words, never stop, you could put in some

54
00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.140
number of iterations here if you want,
and the animation direction is alternate.

55
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.713
So we're gonna run the animation this way,
and then we're gonna run it back,

56
00:03:48.713 --> 00:03:51.970
we're gonna run it this way,
and we're gonna run it back.

57
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.905
If you put it all in one direction, so
it runs start to finish, start to finish,

58
00:03:56.905 --> 00:04:00.090
start to finish,
that can get a little bit choppy.

59
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.776
So here it's running back and forth, so

60
00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:08.120
that's sort of the broad characteristics
of the CSS animation up front.

61
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.850
And then here in the key frames,
we say exactly what we wanna do.

62
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.536
I've set up 0%, 25%, 75%, and
100%, that is of the time,

63
00:04:16.536 --> 00:04:22.129
that's what those percents are referring
to 100% of the time would be in this case,

64
00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:25.708
five seconds,
the animation duration that I set here.

65
00:04:25.708 --> 00:04:30.540
So 25% of that five seconds
would be at 1.25 seconds in

66
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.550
this specific case,
we're going to do this thing.

67
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.918
So here the keyframes
are set up such that and

68
00:04:38.918 --> 00:04:44.652
the first sort of 25% of the animation,
the first one and a half second,

69
00:04:44.652 --> 00:04:49.490
1.25 seconds will have it
displaying at the same opacity.

70
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.949
Basically new animation is occurring,
then between 25 and

71
00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.721
75% of the time so 1.25 to 3.75 seconds,

72
00:04:57.721 --> 00:05:03.880
we'll transition from an opacity of 1
to an opacity of 0, that's the fade.

73
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.080
That's where the fade completely happens.

74
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.936
And then we'll keep that to 100%.

75
00:05:08.936 --> 00:05:12.200
So that's what's happening here,
just two grid cells,

76
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.025
we've placed them on top of each other
then we animate one to fade in and out.

77
00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:21.401
So that's one idea that you might take
away and thinking about overlapping

78
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:24.815
grid cells and what you could
do with them in your designs.
