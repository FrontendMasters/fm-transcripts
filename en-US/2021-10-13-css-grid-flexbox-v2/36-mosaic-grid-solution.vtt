00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.591
I hope you did well with challenge
number 12 trying to layout

2
00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:06.893
these images in a mosaic grid.

3
00:00:06.893 --> 00:00:11.801
And so let's go through exactly
what I did in terms of my code and

4
00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:14.869
how I solved this particular problem.

5
00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:20.347
So here in my HTML, we have
the setup as pretty much as you saw.

6
00:00:20.347 --> 00:00:25.252
The HTML written in the flexbox portion
of the course we have a section.

7
00:00:25.252 --> 00:00:28.263
I've given an id of pop
art to be consistent with

8
00:00:28.263 --> 00:00:31.366
the notation that I was
using inside of flexbox.

9
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:36.453
We have an h2 called pop art and then we
have our images set in an unordered list

10
00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:41.710
because.This is just a series of images
they could go in any particular order.

11
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.239
Inside of that we have a series
of figures and figure captions.

12
00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.739
And those have images and
the figure caption associated with them.

13
00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.924
The figure caption has the link.

14
00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:55.774
That's basically the way this
is set up the whole way through.

15
00:00:55.774 --> 00:00:59.864
So what I would need to do to this
HTML in order to make this work,

16
00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:03.971
you'll see that occasionally I
have thrown in a call span too.

17
00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:06.722
And occasionally I've
thrown in a row span too.

18
00:01:06.722 --> 00:01:10.052
So that is what is going
to be responsible for

19
00:01:10.052 --> 00:01:14.649
driving the spanning of the various
cells and columns here.

20
00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.385
Inside of my layout.

21
00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:22.197
Because, what we gonna do is we're
gonna declare our grid on our ul,

22
00:01:22.197 --> 00:01:25.719
and then our allies become our children.

23
00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.488
So the ul is the grid container,
or the parent,

24
00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:33.176
the allies are the children or
the grid items.

25
00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:37.046
And that's the way this
is all gonna line up.

26
00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:39.868
Alright, so.

27
00:01:39.868 --> 00:01:46.030
As always, the best place to start with
this is to take a look at your image.

28
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.130
And you're going to want to
think about how many columns and

29
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.627
how many rows you have here.

30
00:01:50.627 --> 00:01:54.920
So here we've got 1, 2, 3, 4,

31
00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.053
5 rows and we've got 1, 2, 3 columns.

32
00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:05.590
Which is great, and then we just
start setting things up accordingly.

33
00:02:08.935 --> 00:02:12.444
Instead of our CSS if you
scroll going down here,

34
00:02:12.444 --> 00:02:15.790
given you a lot of CSS
that we wrote yesterday.

35
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.466
So starting here inside of the media
query, remember, outside the media query,

36
00:02:20.466 --> 00:02:23.201
the images will just stack
on top of each other.

37
00:02:23.201 --> 00:02:24.867
There's actually no styling for

38
00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:27.792
the pop art portion of the site
outside of the media query.

39
00:02:27.792 --> 00:02:32.123
But inside of it,
we've added our pop art ul.

40
00:02:32.123 --> 00:02:34.320
That will be our display grid.

41
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.588
I want three evenly sized columns.

42
00:02:36.588 --> 00:02:41.498
Easiest way to do that is just to
make them all one fraction big, and

43
00:02:41.498 --> 00:02:43.611
I gave them a 10 pixel gap.

44
00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:50.164
Then I set up my three styles here, call
span 2, a call span 3 and a row span 2.

45
00:02:50.164 --> 00:02:53.837
And all I had to do is set up
a grid column or grid row column.

46
00:02:53.837 --> 00:02:57.257
Property and just set it up to
say span two or span three.

47
00:02:57.257 --> 00:03:01.657
So wherever I happen to place
that in the particular web page.

48
00:03:01.657 --> 00:03:07.621
Then the image is going to span over
that many columns or that many rows.

49
00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:10.373
Notice here too,
I've added at the bottom here for

50
00:03:10.373 --> 00:03:13.841
some reason the figures don't
always fill their li container.

51
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:18.583
So I found that by adding a height of
100% on the figure help to keep those

52
00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:19.574
evenly sized.

53
00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:25.402
So that is how I solved this
particular problem here,

54
00:03:25.402 --> 00:03:29.687
inside of this particular challenge.

55
00:03:29.687 --> 00:03:31.339
So that's the first part of this.

56
00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:34.761
We've got now our mosaic
grid all coated up.

57
00:03:34.761 --> 00:03:39.107
If you want to take a quick peek
at that inside of the web page so

58
00:03:39.107 --> 00:03:41.763
here's the way it winds up looking.

59
00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:46.929
We have our various images,
they're all of the same height and

60
00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:49.864
it's a fun and engaging layout it.

61
00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:53.551
There was nothing wrong with what we did
with flexbox in terms of all of those

62
00:03:53.551 --> 00:03:55.083
images all next to each other.

63
00:03:55.083 --> 00:04:00.509
But this to me is much more interesting
in from a design perspective.

64
00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:01.302
All right.

65
00:04:01.302 --> 00:04:07.129
So now that we've got that in place, let's
go on to incorporating that grid layout.

66
00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.835
Now let's plug it into our main web page.

67
00:04:09.835 --> 00:04:14.901
And what I did was I got rid of the
collections portion of that web page and

68
00:04:14.901 --> 00:04:17.449
substituted in this pop art piece.

69
00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.722
If you wanted to keep that
collections layout that we coded in

70
00:04:20.722 --> 00:04:22.656
the flexbox portion of the course.

71
00:04:22.656 --> 00:04:25.139
There's absolutely
nothing wrong with that,

72
00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.375
you could just add this on as part
of the web page if you want it.

73
00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:32.240
So we're starting with
the HTML here with our

74
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.517
incorporating this part
into the main home page.

75
00:04:36.517 --> 00:04:38.554
This is the homepage from yesterday.

76
00:04:38.554 --> 00:04:41.764
And I have scrolled all
the way down to the bottom,

77
00:04:41.764 --> 00:04:45.289
close to the bottom anyway,
past the featured print.

78
00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:56.665
Somewhere down around line 83 and I just
copied the HTML that I had generated.

79
00:04:56.665 --> 00:05:02.032
In the 12 A exercise,
pasted it here into my index study HTML.

80
00:05:02.032 --> 00:05:05.941
I didn't need to make any
changes here along the way.

81
00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:10.937
Because I have all of the styling that
I had been previously using is carrying

82
00:05:10.937 --> 00:05:12.821
over here into this design.

83
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:17.619
The only thing that needs to be added are
those additional classes that are going to

84
00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:20.205
make this a grid system
instead of flexbox.

85
00:05:20.205 --> 00:05:24.656
And the classes that are going to set
up the spans across the columns and

86
00:05:24.656 --> 00:05:25.798
across the rows.

87
00:05:25.798 --> 00:05:28.082
So then here inside of our CSS.

88
00:05:34.814 --> 00:05:39.487
Down around line 157,
this is outside of the media queries.

89
00:05:39.487 --> 00:05:42.556
I had set up our figures
to have one border color.

90
00:05:42.556 --> 00:05:44.608
In this case, I picked color number eight.

91
00:05:44.608 --> 00:05:47.397
You could have picked any of the colors
that probably would have been fine.

92
00:05:50.002 --> 00:05:54.383
I also set up the object position and
the object fit here.

93
00:05:54.383 --> 00:05:57.344
For the image,
the object position is set to zero and

94
00:05:57.344 --> 00:05:59.101
the object fit is set to cover.

95
00:05:59.101 --> 00:06:03.379
To make sure to differentiate these images
from some of the other ones that we had.

96
00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:06.874
Where we were changing some of
the positions in the flexbox

97
00:06:06.874 --> 00:06:08.309
portion of the course.

98
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:11.375
Okay, and
then inside of our tablet media query,

99
00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:15.760
we're all the way down to line 395
inside of our tablet media query.

100
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.373
And in here I have copied over the call
span and row span columns here.

101
00:06:21.373 --> 00:06:25.226
And then finally the last thing that
I did here on row span 2 figure.

102
00:06:25.226 --> 00:06:28.731
I have a max height of unset.

103
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:32.902
We had previously put on
the figure elements way far up

104
00:06:32.902 --> 00:06:37.176
towards the top in the mobile
version of this website.

105
00:06:37.176 --> 00:06:41.554
We had set it to have a max height
of 400 pixels for all of our images.

106
00:06:41.554 --> 00:06:47.574
When you bring your mosaic in to
this layout here on this homepage.

107
00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:51.492
That max height of 400 pixels would apply
to everything that's inside of your

108
00:06:51.492 --> 00:06:52.190
grid system.

109
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.916
In that particular case, the way these
images are in their sizes and so forth,

110
00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.221
it really chopped them all in pieces.

111
00:06:59.221 --> 00:07:01.380
And so I didn't like that effect.

112
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.877
I just turned off the max height
here by using the unset value.

113
00:07:05.877 --> 00:07:08.989
So it would forget about that
max height of 400 pixels.

114
00:07:08.989 --> 00:07:15.983
And so that fix that problem, particularly
on the row span 2 where that was an issue.

115
00:07:15.983 --> 00:07:20.748
And that's pretty much all I needed to do,
those styles will carry then into

116
00:07:20.748 --> 00:07:23.886
the desktop layout which
is exactly what we want.

117
00:07:23.886 --> 00:07:29.135
So that's how you can code up a little
example over here in isolation and

118
00:07:29.135 --> 00:07:32.820
then very easily integrated
into your homepage.
