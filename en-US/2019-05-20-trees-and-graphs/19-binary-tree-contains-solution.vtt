1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.261
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Let's adapt this,
to contain.

2
00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:08.474
So what contains does
is it takes a value and

3
00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:13.505
it looks at every node in our tree and
returns true or

4
00:00:13.505 --> 00:00:17.380
false if we have that value in our tree.

5
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.054
Cool, so, maybe we want to check if
we have a particular question or

6
00:00:23.054 --> 00:00:25.754
a particular recommendation.

7
00:00:25.754 --> 00:00:29.744
Right, again, just to note,
if we have a recommendation,

8
00:00:29.744 --> 00:00:33.360
we can just add another
field called recommendation.

9
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.219
But it would be the same,
the logic would be the same.

10
00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:39.304
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right.

11
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.255
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
what do we do first?

12
00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:48.079
&gt;&gt; Student: Take the value.

13
00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:55.251
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
if the first, so if this.question,

14
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.010
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Let's keep it so

15
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.879
if this.question === question,
we return true.

16
00:01:14.182 --> 00:01:14.939
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah?

17
00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.551
All right, that's the first one.

18
00:01:16.551 --> 00:01:19.877
Now we need to deal with the nested.

19
00:01:19.877 --> 00:01:25.228
What if, so we know that this
is gonna be recursive, right.

20
00:01:25.228 --> 00:01:26.831
Why do we know that?

21
00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:32.029
&gt;&gt; Student: iii
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

22
00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:33.926
because we need to traverse it.

23
00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:36.559
So it's gonna be really
similar as our traverse.

24
00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.334
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: But
also a little bit different, right?

25
00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:42.586
Because we're returning a value here.

26
00:01:42.586 --> 00:01:45.875
With recursion we need to preserve
that value that we're returning.

27
00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:48.538
So there's some considerations.

28
00:01:48.538 --> 00:01:51.220
But let's take it from step one.

29
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.391
Let's imagine that we only need
to check the next children.

30
00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:04.094
So we can then say contains.

31
00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:15.001
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: This will
check all the left, sorry,

32
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:18.083
also this needs to say this.

33
00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.562
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay?
So what happens here.

34
00:02:28.562 --> 00:02:29.568
Let's break it down.

35
00:02:29.568 --> 00:02:33.368
So let's look at,

36
00:02:33.368 --> 00:02:39.306
where is our data structure?

37
00:02:39.306 --> 00:02:42.534
Let me grab one from a slide.

38
00:02:42.534 --> 00:02:46.399
Here we go, okay.

39
00:03:03.218 --> 00:03:06.948
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, so we have our
question, we have yes and we have no,

40
00:03:06.948 --> 00:03:07.490
right?

41
00:03:12.164 --> 00:03:14.389
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And we want to see if,

42
00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:19.174
let's look for,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Something

43
00:03:19.174 --> 00:03:20.131
that exists here.

44
00:03:29.143 --> 00:03:29.829
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, let's see.

45
00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.535
Do you like butter?

46
00:03:34.535 --> 00:03:35.316
I don't know.

47
00:03:35.316 --> 00:03:35.954
Something like that.

48
00:03:35.954 --> 00:03:39.996
So that's just another
node with a question.

49
00:03:39.996 --> 00:03:43.383
So we're gonna check the first
one if it contains yes.

50
00:03:43.383 --> 00:03:44.808
So how does that work?

51
00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:49.509
So we start with the first question,
we're looking for, do you like butter?

52
00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:57.027
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: First question is,
do you feel like cooking?

53
00:03:57.027 --> 00:03:59.101
Is that equal to question?

54
00:03:59.101 --> 00:04:01.590
No, so it's not gonna return true.

55
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.759
We call contains with this.yes of that,

56
00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:10.455
so the yes is do you have milk?

57
00:04:10.455 --> 00:04:14.519
If we go in here,
do you have milk does not

58
00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.938
equal,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Do you have butter?

59
00:04:19.938 --> 00:04:21.351
Do you guys see the bug?

60
00:04:21.351 --> 00:04:23.344
What does this say?

61
00:04:23.344 --> 00:04:29.124
&gt;&gt; Student: You're not
going one level more?

62
00:04:29.124 --> 00:04:32.336
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
this says, do you like cooking?

63
00:04:32.336 --> 00:04:36.610
&gt;&gt; Student2: Well, it's taking [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: This is gonna say,

64
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.271
do you like cooking?

65
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:43.943
&gt;&gt; Student2: Yes, so it's gonna be
an object and it's gonna be a tree.

66
00:04:43.943 --> 00:04:48.470
&gt;&gt; Student: It should be

67
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.974
this
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You guys see that?

68
00:04:53.974 --> 00:04:59.402
So this.contains, if we pass this .yes,

69
00:04:59.402 --> 00:05:04.389
the problem is that we are overwriting,

70
00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.536
first of all, we're overwriting this.

71
00:05:09.536 --> 00:05:12.882
So let's look at it with the value.

72
00:05:12.882 --> 00:05:18.313
So this question is, do you have milk.

73
00:05:18.313 --> 00:05:21.069
So then we're changing the question here.

74
00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:24.014
See the problem there?

75
00:05:28.237 --> 00:05:30.954
&gt;&gt; Student2: I don't think that we
should be calling this.contains.

76
00:05:30.954 --> 00:05:34.431
I think we should be
calling this.yes.contains.

77
00:05:34.431 --> 00:05:34.959
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

78
00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:41.356
How is that different, this.yes.contains
and then we pass the question in there.

79
00:05:43.345 --> 00:05:50.311
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Now, we pass question,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: To

80
00:05:50.311 --> 00:05:53.225
that,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

81
00:05:53.225 --> 00:05:54.928
we preserve the value of question.

82
00:05:54.928 --> 00:05:56.412
See the difference there?

83
00:06:00.875 --> 00:06:06.490
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, all right.

84
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.478
So let's take it from here.

85
00:06:07.478 --> 00:06:10.668
So this.yes.contains question.

86
00:06:10.668 --> 00:06:13.087
We pass it in.

87
00:06:13.087 --> 00:06:16.393
We have the whole node, right,

88
00:06:16.393 --> 00:06:21.791
not just the string,
this.question = question.

89
00:06:21.791 --> 00:06:26.682
So it's does do you have milk
equal do you like butter?

90
00:06:26.682 --> 00:06:27.401
No.

91
00:06:27.401 --> 00:06:35.725
This.yes.question, [SOUND].

92
00:06:35.725 --> 00:06:36.905
So we keep going, right?

93
00:06:36.905 --> 00:06:38.649
It's gonna keep going.

94
00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:41.826
Eventually this is gonna air out, right?

95
00:06:41.826 --> 00:06:44.050
So we have to say if this.yes.

96
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.461
See the similarity here?

97
00:06:53.067 --> 00:06:56.225
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And
what else do we need to do here?

98
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.327
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We
wanna traverse the right.

99
00:07:10.227 --> 00:07:13.499
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then,
what about that return value?

100
00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:19.011
If this returns false this will,
might short circuit

101
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:23.797
our recursion prematurely,
or it might not.

102
00:07:23.797 --> 00:07:26.243
Or maybe we need to store it.

103
00:07:26.243 --> 00:07:29.102
Let's investigate.

104
00:07:29.102 --> 00:07:33.896
All right, so
the question here is do you like butter?

105
00:07:39.227 --> 00:07:39.783
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And let's start.

106
00:07:39.783 --> 00:07:43.573
Okay, so question,

107
00:07:43.573 --> 00:07:48.211
do you feel like cooking?

108
00:07:48.211 --> 00:07:52.903
This is not,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Not gonna

109
00:07:52.903 --> 00:07:55.082
enter this.yes.

110
00:07:55.082 --> 00:07:57.079
Do we have a yes, true.

111
00:07:57.079 --> 00:08:00.847
So then we're gonna go into that,
which is do you have milk?

112
00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:04.009
It's gonna come in here.

113
00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:07.583
This.question is gonna
be do you like milk?

114
00:08:07.583 --> 00:08:09.302
This is gonna be fo you like butter?

115
00:08:09.302 --> 00:08:09.905
Nope.

116
00:08:09.905 --> 00:08:11.407
It's gonna go in here again.

117
00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:16.253
And whatever that is there is also

118
00:08:16.253 --> 00:08:20.926
not gonna return true, and so,

119
00:08:20.926 --> 00:08:25.958
it's going to then skip to the no.

120
00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.605
See that?

121
00:08:27.605 --> 00:08:31.653
The no of this one.

122
00:08:37.435 --> 00:08:40.420
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then it's
gonna go through all of the no's, or

123
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.833
it's gonna go through the no,
and then the yes of that no.

124
00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:48.425
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Because
we're gonna call, so

125
00:08:48.425 --> 00:08:51.665
if you say this.contains with a no,
it still is gonna call this one first.

126
00:08:51.665 --> 00:08:55.956
So what this is doing is
it's checking itself.

127
00:08:55.956 --> 00:08:58.321
It's checking all the left.

128
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:04.040
Then it's checking the right one and
all the left ones.

129
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.165
The right one or the left ones like that.

130
00:09:08.165 --> 00:09:12.574
But we're still not really
returning anything.

131
00:09:12.574 --> 00:09:14.076
Let's imagine that we get
to the bottom of this.

132
00:09:14.076 --> 00:09:17.576
The bottom of this, so

133
00:09:17.576 --> 00:09:22.003
we haven't found this yet.

134
00:09:22.003 --> 00:09:25.791
How do we return this value?

135
00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:27.456
How do we get this out, right?

136
00:09:27.456 --> 00:09:34.851
So we could return return, right?

137
00:09:34.851 --> 00:09:41.001
&gt;&gt; Student: We can't have
two return statements.

138
00:09:41.001 --> 00:09:46.092
We can actually, I think we should put

139
00:09:46.092 --> 00:09:51.342
a variable up there, like contains and

140
00:09:51.342 --> 00:09:56.921
put another why logic until that is true.

141
00:09:56.921 --> 00:10:02.600
Until that as far as we keep doing
this once that is true we stop doing.

142
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.155
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

143
00:10:03.155 --> 00:10:06.617
So using a while loop
with our recursion and

144
00:10:06.617 --> 00:10:12.299
then kind of holding a value,
what if we just did something like this?

145
00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:20.921
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And that works.

146
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:27.946
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,
if one of the yesses has a question,

147
00:10:27.946 --> 00:10:30.996
or this one has a question.

148
00:10:30.996 --> 00:10:35.334
&gt;&gt; Student: What about that break

149
00:10:35.334 --> 00:10:40.156
when you get to the end?

150
00:10:40.156 --> 00:10:41.793
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Would it?

151
00:10:41.793 --> 00:10:45.105
&gt;&gt; Student: It'd return to
false if nothing has it.

152
00:10:46.118 --> 00:10:51.185
&gt;&gt; Student3: But
what happens when this.yes is null?

153
00:10:54.211 --> 00:10:56.136
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What
happens if yes is null?

154
00:10:56.136 --> 00:10:58.500
You can have a check in there.

155
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:06.037
So it's,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You can check,

156
00:11:06.037 --> 00:11:07.022
can guard.

157
00:11:13.335 --> 00:11:18.438
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,
so this will check if this

158
00:11:18.438 --> 00:11:22.975
is true, what does that do?

159
00:11:22.975 --> 00:11:27.589
&gt;&gt; Student3: If we get to the case where
there's no yes and there's no no property,

160
00:11:27.589 --> 00:11:29.242
this will return false.

161
00:11:29.242 --> 00:11:34.987
So that'll be our bottom of the pyramid.

162
00:11:34.987 --> 00:11:39.441
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,
you're saying that,

163
00:11:39.441 --> 00:11:44.862
if this is, we get to the bottom,

164
00:11:44.862 --> 00:11:48.938
and this is nul, right?

165
00:11:48.938 --> 00:11:53.497
&gt;&gt; Student3: Yeah, if that's null,
this .yes will be evaluated as false.

166
00:11:53.497 --> 00:11:58.222
Then this.yes.contains question

167
00:11:58.222 --> 00:12:02.646
will run and it will look at the or.

168
00:12:02.646 --> 00:12:10.024
And if this.no evaluates to false,
it won't run this .no.contains question.

169
00:12:10.024 --> 00:12:10.954
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

170
00:12:10.954 --> 00:12:12.411
&gt;&gt; Student3: Does that return false?

171
00:12:12.411 --> 00:12:15.106
Will that return false then?

172
00:12:15.106 --> 00:12:20.182
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so if we get
to the bottom, this will return false.

173
00:12:20.182 --> 00:12:25.719
But what if we went in here first?

174
00:12:25.719 --> 00:12:27.673
Are we able to preserve this value?

175
00:12:27.673 --> 00:12:31.212
That's the real question, right?

176
00:12:31.212 --> 00:12:32.920
So, is this carrying over?
