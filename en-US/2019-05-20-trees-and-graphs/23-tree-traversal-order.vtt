&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Really quickly.

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.360
There are different types of trees.

3
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.680
Are there different types of

4
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.600
orders that I kind of have been alluding
to we haven't explicitly talked about yet.

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.275
So we have pre order,
in order in post order.

6
00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:21.147
And I don't think it really matters that
you memorize which ones which and why.

7
00:00:21.147 --> 00:00:25.530
I don't think like the people are going
to be like, traverse a tree post order.

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.270
You just need to understand like how to

9
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.770
switch between these depending on
the problem that you're solving.

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.870
So let's just look at it.

11
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.700
So a lot of it has to do
with where you traverse.

12
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.580
If you traverse first,
or do the work, right?

13
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.980
Whether that's the console.log or
whatever it is you may be doing.

14
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.440
So for this one,
it will go through all of the left,

15
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.270
then the root, and then all of the right.

16
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.600
This one is the one that we've been
working with where we do work on the root

17
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.100
first, and then we do left,
and then we do right.

18
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.260
And this one is the opposite of
that where you go to the left.

19
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.450
Then you go to the right, and
then you do work on the root.
