00:00:00.134 --> 00:00:02.758
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We
created our data structure.

2
00:00:02.758 --> 00:00:07.929
We have an ability to insert nodes,
build our tree,

3
00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:13.345
build up our recommendations and
questions, right?

4
00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:15.692
Maybe, we could get there.

5
00:00:18.444 --> 00:00:19.643
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No, still confused?

6
00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:27.488
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, we'll keep
going, unless you stop me, all right.

7
00:00:27.488 --> 00:00:33.754
So we have our data structure, we need
to do something useful with it, right?

8
00:00:33.754 --> 00:00:37.410
So we built it,
now let's run an algorithm on it.

9
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.774
Seems reasonable,
seems like the logical next step.

10
00:00:39.774 --> 00:00:42.687
We have the thing,
now let's do something with it.

11
00:00:42.687 --> 00:00:48.217
So I think a good starting point for
this is just to count

12
00:00:48.217 --> 00:00:54.967
the number of recommendations
that our chat-bot can recommend.

13
00:00:54.967 --> 00:01:00.712
How might we differentiate

14
00:01:00.712 --> 00:01:08.209
a recommendation from a question?

15
00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:10.232
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It wouldn't
have any children.

16
00:01:10.232 --> 00:01:14.992
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, yeah, so
if we get to a node that doesn't have

17
00:01:14.992 --> 00:01:19.225
any children,
that can be a recommendation.

18
00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:23.223
So just like we had to go down a path,
we have our recommendation.

19
00:01:23.223 --> 00:01:24.834
Any other ways that we can do it?

20
00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:26.874
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Depends on the tree, right?

21
00:01:26.874 --> 00:01:32.146
Cuz if it's binary, then you could just
assume that it's only two, right or no?

22
00:01:32.146 --> 00:01:35.866
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Well, so
our recommendation is binary,

23
00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:38.745
actually cuz we have yes and no.

24
00:01:38.745 --> 00:01:43.757
So each question will only
have two options, yes and no.

25
00:01:43.757 --> 00:01:46.673
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So each node would be
the same, you could extrapolate then from

26
00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.709
the nodes the recommendation,
the number of recommendations?

27
00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.882
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: But how?

28
00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:57.498
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You can look for
the yes or no keys in the object.

29
00:01:57.498 --> 00:02:00.837
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So maybe if it's
a recommendation we don't have a yes or

30
00:02:00.837 --> 00:02:01.554
no option?

31
00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:03.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, cool,

32
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.318
all reasonable.

33
00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.139
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So here's our tree,
we have our questions and

34
00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:18.259
then we have our recommendations, so,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: This

35
00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:19.709
looks familiar, right?

36
00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:27.053
So if you were to adapt your tree with
insert child, what would be the different?

37
00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:31.904
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You
guys just did the exercise,

38
00:02:31.904 --> 00:02:34.275
what are the different
about building this?

39
00:02:34.275 --> 00:02:35.560
All right, let's take a look.
