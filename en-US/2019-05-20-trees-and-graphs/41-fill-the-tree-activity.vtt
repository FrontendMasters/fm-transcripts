00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.510
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Knowing what
we know about binary search trees,

2
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:06.560
take just two minutes.

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.500
We don't need a break for
this or anything.

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.975
Just take two minutes to figure out
which node goes where in this blank.

5
00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:22.980
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Take two minutes to
think about it and then we'll reconvene.

6
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.800
All right, so,
anyone know what this node is?

7
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.270
Five.

8
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.535
Okay, how do we know that it's five?

9
00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:40.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Started from
the bottom left 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

10
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.540
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That's how you did it.

11
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.680
So you just started like, like the
furthest left is going to be the minimum.

12
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.242
Awesome.
Anyone else figure that out in

13
00:00:47.242 --> 00:00:47.921
different way?

14
00:00:50.094 --> 00:00:52.105
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Just on the mid point based

15
00:00:52.105 --> 00:00:53.500
on the weighted sides.

16
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.108
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so you're like
there's 4 less and there's 3 greater, so

17
00:00:59.108 --> 00:01:00.102
it has to be 5.

18
00:01:00.102 --> 00:01:04.270
Cuz here is 3 greater,
here's 5, here's 4 less, yeah.

19
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.790
That tends to be how I think about it.

20
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.480
Cool, so five here, and then here.

21
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: 4.

22
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.955
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: 4.

23
00:01:14.955 --> 00:01:15.455
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 2.

24
00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.875
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 1.

25
00:01:20.715 --> 00:01:21.697
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 3.

26
00:01:21.697 --> 00:01:24.816
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Great,
I don't know why that one's not working.

27
00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:25.494
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 7.

28
00:01:28.298 --> 00:01:28.902
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 6.

29
00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:32.476
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 8.

30
00:01:32.476 --> 00:01:34.028
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, awesome.
