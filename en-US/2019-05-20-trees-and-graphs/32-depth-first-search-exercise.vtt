00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:00.910
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Question.

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.619
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How do you
make the connections then,

3
00:00:04.619 --> 00:00:07.985
if you're going to this
is just as search it to?

4
00:00:07.985 --> 00:00:10.489
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What connections?

5
00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:16.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So you have the graph,
you graph it, you gone through it all.

6
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.620
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
this graph exists already.

7
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.075
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It has values in it,

8
00:00:20.075 --> 00:00:20.920
it has edges.

9
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.323
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So this is just a way
to look through it for something.

10
00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:23.826
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

11
00:00:23.826 --> 00:00:26.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And then once you find
that thing, you would've stopped this.

12
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.290
Let's say eight, you were looking for
8, so then you would stop at 8.

13
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.570
You're done or 7,
you would've stopped before.

14
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.830
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So you can,
so that's more like a find?

15
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.966
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That first search is

16
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:45.932
gonna traverse through everything,
every time.

17
00:00:45.932 --> 00:00:50.090
I mean you can, doing fine can be
like a modified depth research.

18
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.930
But when we talk about depth research,
we're visiting every node in the graph.

19
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.867
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: To do what?

20
00:00:55.867 --> 00:00:57.815
What is the, I guess-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All kinds of

21
00:00:57.815 --> 00:00:58.484
fun stuff.

22
00:00:58.484 --> 00:00:59.259
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so

23
00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:03.613
you can use it to see if paths exist,
if there's cycles,

24
00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:07.994
you might wanna validate
the information in your graph.

25
00:01:07.994 --> 00:01:09.160
So there's all kinds of things.

26
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.112
We might want to traverse
it to get recommendations,

27
00:01:12.112 --> 00:01:14.351
that's what we're doing eventually.

28
00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:17.838
Yeah, so once you have the stuff,
you need to be able to look at it, so

29
00:01:17.838 --> 00:01:19.355
that you can do stuff with it.

30
00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:23.378
What that stuff is,
you can get really creative with it.

31
00:01:23.378 --> 00:01:25.941
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, so for
a recommendation, so I guess,

32
00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:28.120
you're gonna go into that problem.

33
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.398
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We're gonna get there,
yeah, yeah, but, yeah,

34
00:01:31.398 --> 00:01:33.716
I like where your head's at, okay.

35
00:01:33.716 --> 00:01:35.443
Are you guys ready?

36
00:01:35.443 --> 00:01:36.400
Take a stab
