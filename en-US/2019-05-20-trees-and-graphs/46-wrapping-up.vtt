00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.920
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We are gonna wrap up.

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.800
I had fun hanging out
with all of you today and

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.170
talking about grass and
trees for many, many hours.

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.520
And some further resources,

5
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.500
Brian Holt also has a CS class
here on Frontend Masters.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.930
And there's always Geeks for Geeks.

7
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.635
Cracking the Coding Interview.

8
00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:28.820
Interviewing.io and Pramp are pretty
cool for getting interview help.

9
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.790
So for interviewing.io,
you actually interview with companies,

10
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.630
which is kinda cool.

11
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.970
It's anonymous, so
if you fail, no one knows.

12
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.610
But if it works out,

13
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.530
you might actually get moved on
to the next round of interviews.

14
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.960
So that's kinda cool, interviewing.io.

15
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.210
And then Pramp is like a peer-to-peer
interview practice site,

16
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.020
where you and a peer can interview each
other and give each other feedback.

17
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.219
And by a peer,
it's like a random person on the internet.

18
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.876
Not someone who's judging you for
work, necessarily.

19
00:01:02.876 --> 00:01:06.790
Yeah, and that's it.

20
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.040
Special thanks to my husband, Chris.

21
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.990
And a couple of my friends
who helped me proofread this,

22
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.810
who helped me with the solutions,
and things like that.

23
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.120
And also, if you like the comics and

24
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.930
illustrations, you can follow
these people on Instagram.

25
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.634
They're pretty cool, and
were really nice to let me use them.

26
00:01:26.874 --> 00:01:29.234
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, thank you.

27
00:01:29.234 --> 00:01:33.337
