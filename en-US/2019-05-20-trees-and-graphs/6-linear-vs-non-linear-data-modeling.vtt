&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So you brought
up the the linear versus nonlinear.

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.090
This is a thought experiment, okay?

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.610
So in these data structures and
algorithms classes,

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.970
it's easy just to take what I say and
then just try to memorize,

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.270
especially with time complexity, people
don't want to actually think about it.

6
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.898
They just want to be like, merge sort and

7
00:00:17.898 --> 00:00:21.783
log in, without actually deeply
understanding what that means.

8
00:00:21.783 --> 00:00:24.030
And I'm going to challenge
you to not do that.

9
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.934
And so I'm going to stop, and
we're gonna have these discussions on,

10
00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:34.263
what if our chat bot here, Mr. Breakfast
bot, was a linear data structure?

11
00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:36.070
Is that possible?

12
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.240
What would that look like?

13
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.090
And I think I just want to give you,
does everyone have pen and paper?

14
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.545
I think it's a good time,
if you have pen and

15
00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:53.363
paper, to kinda brainstorm,
how, if we can,

16
00:00:53.363 --> 00:00:59.275
how can we model our chatbot
to be a linear data structure?
