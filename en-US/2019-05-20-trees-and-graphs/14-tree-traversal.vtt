&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We're gonna traverse
through our tree, which requires us to

2
00:00:05.373 --> 00:00:11.304
understand how to loop through or
traverse a data structure like a tree.

3
00:00:11.304 --> 00:00:18.032
Let's jump to that, here are our leaves.

4
00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:19.408
Let's just talk about traversing.

5
00:00:19.408 --> 00:00:24.648
There are different
traversal techniques and

6
00:00:24.648 --> 00:00:30.160
it all has to do about which
order we visit a node.

7
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.065
And we're going to start with
something called preorder and

8
00:00:35.065 --> 00:00:38.245
it's gonna print the nodes like this.

9
00:00:38.245 --> 00:00:43.163
It's gonna start with
the actual node itself.

10
00:00:43.163 --> 00:00:48.557
Then it's gonna do the left children,

11
00:00:48.557 --> 00:00:56.905
then it's going to do the right children,
etc, like that.

12
00:00:56.905 --> 00:01:02.490
So there's the order, Q1, Q2,
Q3, coffee, egg, bacon, toast.

13
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.780
So that's one order.

14
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.451
There are many orders,
but we'll start with this.
