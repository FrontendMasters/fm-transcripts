00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.620
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So let's just
talk about insertion really quickly.

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.759
So, we have a root node here of 3,

3
00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.683
we wanna insert this value 20.

4
00:00:11.683 --> 00:00:14.490
At every step,
we need to do a comparison, right?

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.080
We say, is this greater than or less than?

6
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.110
Let's take a peek.

7
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.930
So, I got 3, greater than or less than?

8
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.621
Greater than, so we go right.

9
00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:26.793
15, greater than or less than?

10
00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:30.333
So we go, it's greater than,
right, we go right.

11
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.500
20, greater than or less than?

12
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.628
It's less than, right, or 26,
it's less than, so we go left.

13
00:00:36.628 --> 00:00:40.047
21, greater than or less than?

14
00:00:40.047 --> 00:00:40.726
&gt;&gt; Audience: Less.

15
00:00:43.016 --> 00:00:45.616
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Greater than or
less than?

16
00:00:45.616 --> 00:00:46.180
&gt;&gt; Audience: Greater than.

17
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.520
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Greater.

18
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.275
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yep.

19
00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:52.328
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And
that's how we find it's spot.

20
00:00:52.328 --> 00:00:56.218
So we when we insert a node,
we have to go through and

21
00:00:56.218 --> 00:01:01.742
compare until we find an open spot
where it meets the criteria, mm-hm?

22
00:01:01.742 --> 00:01:06.409
&gt;&gt; Audience: Why do we put 20
as a child to 19 instead of put

23
00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.516
it between 19 and 21 or 15 and 26?

24
00:01:12.264 --> 00:01:15.140
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
at each point, you have to compare.

25
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.900
So at 15, it's greater,
so it has to go right.

26
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.285
At 26, it's less than,
so it has to go left.

27
00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:26.351
21, it's less than, so it has to go left.

28
00:01:26.351 --> 00:01:29.956
19, it's greater than, and there's a spot.

29
00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:35.053
It has to have a spot, cuz it either
has to go to a left or right.

30
00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:38.456
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm, yeah.

31
00:01:38.456 --> 00:01:40.941
&gt;&gt; Audience: And
it can only have two spots.

32
00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:42.367
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so if it was 22-
&gt;&gt; Audience: But

33
00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:45.108
you were thinking inserting,
I mean you could've put it between.

34
00:01:45.108 --> 00:01:47.162
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Then you'd
have to rebalance the two.

35
00:01:47.162 --> 00:01:47.883
&gt;&gt; Audience: Okay, I see.

36
00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.065
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: For sure, cool.

37
00:01:53.065 --> 00:01:56.658
&gt;&gt; Audience: So, [COUGH] we had
a side topic about rebalancing.

38
00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:59.515
This is the topic right here?

39
00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:02.453
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm, we're not
actually gonna go into how to rebalance

40
00:02:02.453 --> 00:02:04.490
because of time constraints.

41
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.180
But we're getting there,
we're moving towards building this and

42
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.830
why it's important to rebalance.
