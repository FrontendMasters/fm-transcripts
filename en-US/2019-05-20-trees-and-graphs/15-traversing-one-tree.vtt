1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.562
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
let's take it to the editor.

2
00:00:02.562 --> 00:00:07.140
We're going to do group live coding.

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.374
If you've taken one of my classes before,
you know it's my favorite.

4
00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:16.877
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we're gonna have our data structure here.

5
00:00:19.342 --> 00:00:20.874
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I wonder why it's so
upset.

6
00:00:24.293 --> 00:00:26.835
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's mad
at me because my file name,

7
00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:29.050
it doesn't like the file name.

8
00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:38.764
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

9
00:00:42.832 --> 00:00:44.787
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, okay.

10
00:00:44.787 --> 00:00:46.578
Here we go.

11
00:00:46.578 --> 00:00:52.305
Let's wrap this so we can see it.

12
00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:57.769
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right.

13
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.500
There we go.

14
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.250
And then, we want to traverse.

15
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.420
Let's just go rid of that.

16
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.019
Actually, I'll leave it
cuz I'll send it out.

17
00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:12.960
So, let's just start fresh here,
and we are going to.

18
00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:16.800
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Just talk
about traversing, right?

19
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.350
So we like need some function.

20
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.285
We'll call it traverse.

21
00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:23.954
You know,
we can like take our graph, why not.

22
00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:27.247
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

23
00:01:27.247 --> 00:01:28.269
So.

24
00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:36.584
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Our
graph will start with what?

25
00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:41.008
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, the sum value.

26
00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:45.470
So, this is our graph,

27
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.910
mother, it has a name and it has children.

28
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.729
So the first thing we can do is what,
check if it has children, right?

29
00:01:56.647 --> 00:01:58.158
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Shoot,t
his is supposed to be tree,

30
00:01:58.158 --> 00:01:59.784
you're supposed to be correcting me.

31
00:02:02.948 --> 00:02:04.278
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Children.

32
00:02:05.951 --> 00:02:09.584
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So if the tree has
children, and notice this is different,

33
00:02:09.584 --> 00:02:11.480
we're not doing this is here.

34
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.200
Why is that?

35
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.312
We were doing this.children.push before.

36
00:02:16.312 --> 00:02:20.068
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

37
00:02:20.068 --> 00:02:23.417
Yeah, so
before we were writing class, here,

38
00:02:23.417 --> 00:02:26.532
we're just passing our tree to a function.

39
00:02:26.532 --> 00:02:29.938
So it's just a different
way of approaching it.

40
00:02:29.938 --> 00:02:34.869
From my personal preference, I feel way
more comfortable just using functions

41
00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:38.784
cuz I'm a little more old school,
like the classes and stuff.

42
00:02:38.784 --> 00:02:46.047
Like we're horrendous,
yeah six classes are much nicer.

43
00:02:46.047 --> 00:02:50.302
However, for me,
just cozy to just use a function,

44
00:02:50.302 --> 00:02:53.708
like why are we making this complicated?

45
00:02:53.708 --> 00:02:58.108
That's me, but you should choose
whatever you feel good about,

46
00:02:58.108 --> 00:03:01.794
whatever you think showcases
your skill set the best.

47
00:03:01.794 --> 00:03:05.833
So like if you're like an ES six wiz and
you want them to know that, then yeah,

48
00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:06.403
go crazy.

49
00:03:06.403 --> 00:03:10.280
Do all the crazy stuff.

50
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.338
I'm always impressed anyway.

51
00:03:12.338 --> 00:03:18.224
Okay, so if they're children,
what do you wanna do?

52
00:03:26.904 --> 00:03:31.608
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Like maybe you wanna
first, we wanna do something with,

53
00:03:31.608 --> 00:03:36.804
let's back up, we probably wanna
do something with the node.

54
00:03:36.804 --> 00:03:38.649
The first node, right?

55
00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:45.787
And we can do something easy,
just like console.log(tree.name).

56
00:03:48.137 --> 00:03:49.152
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool?

57
00:03:49.152 --> 00:03:54.283
So we'll console log the name, so
that the very first thing we pop in here,

58
00:03:54.283 --> 00:03:56.978
this will print out actually, right?

59
00:03:56.978 --> 00:03:58.517
Again, danger.

60
00:03:58.517 --> 00:04:00.978
We're not checking if there's a tree.

61
00:04:00.978 --> 00:04:03.936
But that's okay cuz we're
talking about it, and

62
00:04:03.936 --> 00:04:07.750
we'll prioritize that if we have time,
which we won't today.

63
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.663
But, maybe you won't
either in your interview.

64
00:04:11.663 --> 00:04:16.644
Hopefully you don't, because that's
like the boring stuff anyway, I think.

65
00:04:16.644 --> 00:04:20.280
So we're gonna print Ashley.

66
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.540
Cool, everyone cool with how we got here?

67
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.858
Now we have our children to deal with.

68
00:04:27.778 --> 00:04:28.836
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What do we think?

69
00:04:31.916 --> 00:04:36.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I mean children,
your children can help children.

70
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.110
Check to see if the child is a parent.

71
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.640
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Well first, let's
just deal with these immediate children.

72
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.870
Let's imagine a world where our
children don't yet have children.

73
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

74
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.424
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Let's
just start simple.

75
00:04:51.116 --> 00:04:54.635
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's start with
the index at zero as the left side.

76
00:04:54.635 --> 00:04:56.700
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

77
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.360
And then?

78
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.050
And then do what?

79
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So, I guess it would
just console.log, children at 0, and

80
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.030
that would be the last side of the node.

81
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:11.390
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Like this?

82
00:05:14.893 --> 00:05:20.939
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, so then,
that would print out little Summy.

83
00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:22.414
But what about Alex?

84
00:05:28.067 --> 00:05:30.020
&gt;&gt; Alex: So we can loop through the array.

85
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.520
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

86
00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:38.824
&gt;&gt; Alex: Print out the name
of each child node.

87
00:05:38.824 --> 00:05:39.552
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Sure.

88
00:05:43.362 --> 00:05:44.680
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Let's go crazy.

89
00:05:52.703 --> 00:05:54.253
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

90
00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:57.268
We'll do something like this, val.name.

91
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.354
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Does seem reasonable.

92
00:06:04.354 --> 00:06:05.304
There are bugs here.

93
00:06:11.862 --> 00:06:13.175
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Are you guys
running this code in your mind?

94
00:06:13.175 --> 00:06:14.931
Do you know how to do that?

95
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:16.157
Mind debugging.

96
00:06:16.157 --> 00:06:17.261
It's also a good thing.

97
00:06:17.261 --> 00:06:23.350
Useful in your interview,
is debugging your code without running it.

98
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.520
&gt;&gt; Alex: We don't need the if,
anymore, cuz they're using for each.

99
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.280
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

100
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.020
&gt;&gt; Alex: I couldn't hear that, sorry.

101
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.350
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: We don't
need the if anymore.

102
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.357
Cuz for each we'll [INAUDIBLE].

103
00:06:36.357 --> 00:06:39.728
&gt;&gt; Alex: But
if i'ts undefined for each will.

104
00:06:39.728 --> 00:06:41.242
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Good point.

105
00:06:41.242 --> 00:06:42.082
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

106
00:06:42.082 --> 00:06:44.602
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: That do all trees
have children by default?

107
00:06:44.602 --> 00:06:47.859
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes,
we define that, right?

108
00:06:47.859 --> 00:06:50.141
There are gonna be empty,
it'll be an empty array.

109
00:06:50.141 --> 00:06:56.785
Okay, so maybe we need the f maybe we
don't, let's go with node if, I like less.

110
00:06:59.008 --> 00:07:00.800
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.

111
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.880
So again,
this is all like even treed out name,

112
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.459
we just need to make sure there's a tree.

113
00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:13.235
We can catch that before, but
we don't need to worry about that.

114
00:07:13.235 --> 00:07:15.932
Let's just assume that
we always have a tree.

115
00:07:15.932 --> 00:07:20.040
And just note, that we do need
a handle that kind of thing but

116
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.940
we'll do it later, cool?

117
00:07:24.928 --> 00:07:29.142
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So now,
this is cool, we have printed

118
00:07:29.142 --> 00:07:33.631
out all the names of this little family.

119
00:07:33.631 --> 00:07:37.981
So sweet, I feel like I know them already.

120
00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:46.750
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Now it gets fun.

121
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.699
What if Sammy gets a child,

122
00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:55.335
maybe its a dog name Bowser, and

123
00:07:55.335 --> 00:08:01.359
Bowser, Bowser's got puppies.

124
00:08:01.359 --> 00:08:08.465
Let's just say one,
because my slide was too small.

125
00:08:08.465 --> 00:08:14.347
But you'll know it's
little puppy pickles here.

126
00:08:14.347 --> 00:08:19.595
So, we traversed through our
tree with one level, right?

127
00:08:19.595 --> 00:08:23.226
One to five,
how complicated was that for you?

128
00:08:23.226 --> 00:08:23.986
This.

129
00:08:27.228 --> 00:08:30.910
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: One to five,
like one being not complicated and

130
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.312
five being very complicated.

131
00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:34.261
One or two?

132
00:08:34.261 --> 00:08:34.992
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Two.

133
00:08:34.992 --> 00:08:37.027
&gt;&gt; Alex: Two.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Two, yeah.

134
00:08:37.027 --> 00:08:41.723
So when we look at it, you're like,
yeah, it's simple now that we know, but

135
00:08:41.723 --> 00:08:46.634
coming up with that might be what takes it
to make it a little bit more complicated,

136
00:08:46.634 --> 00:08:47.726
but now you know.

137
00:08:47.726 --> 00:08:50.307
Now we all know, that if we get a tree and

138
00:08:50.307 --> 00:08:55.179
we need to go through this one level
of children, will just look through.

139
00:08:55.179 --> 00:08:59.422
It makes sense now after we have started,
but sometimes it's hard to get there.

140
00:08:59.422 --> 00:09:03.939
So, we'll be like as with practice,
we just get that intuition and

141
00:09:03.939 --> 00:09:05.297
how that all works.
