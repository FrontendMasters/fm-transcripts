00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.090
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
the question is, for

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.060
our recommendation,
what do you think is better?

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.781
So, the path we wanna take is,
we want to find

4
00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:17.050
a person and then find a mutual interest.

5
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.516
Like a mutual thing that
I don't already like,

6
00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:25.768
you guys have a sense of
what would be better?

7
00:00:29.116 --> 00:00:30.315
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That first date.

8
00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:31.244
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Why?

9
00:00:31.244 --> 00:00:35.045
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well, you're gonna go
immediately to your food, which is gonna

10
00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:39.830
go back to another person, and then the
third thing is gonna be into food, maybe.

11
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.390
Actually, I take it back.

12
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.080
I take it back.

13
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.757
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You take it back?

14
00:00:43.757 --> 00:00:44.433
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

15
00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:45.952
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
you think breadth first search then?

16
00:00:45.952 --> 00:00:46.605
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Uh-huh.

17
00:00:46.605 --> 00:00:48.057
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

18
00:00:48.057 --> 00:00:49.656
What do other people think?

19
00:00:56.126 --> 00:00:58.075
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Are you the starting note in

20
00:00:58.075 --> 00:00:59.860
this,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What's that?

21
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.718
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Are you the starting note?

22
00:01:00.718 --> 00:01:02.280
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I am
the starting note in this.

23
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.626
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So we do browse first, and

24
00:01:03.626 --> 00:01:06.883
we'll see all the things that
you like already first, right?

25
00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:07.668
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

26
00:01:07.668 --> 00:01:11.672
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So would it make sense to go
depth first to get away from the things

27
00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:14.680
that you're already connected to?

28
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.450
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

29
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.980
That could be a strategy like,
the furthest thing away from me

30
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.830
would definitely be something that,
let's see if I have, where is that graph?

31
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.428
So,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Here's a different

32
00:01:31.428 --> 00:01:33.250
version of the graph.

33
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.580
So if we go depth first, right?

34
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.810
We can make it there faster.

35
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.370
Whereas, breadth first would do
this first and then the people, and

36
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.290
then it wouldn't be this one, right?

37
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.020
So I think my recommendation would be,

38
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.580
if you're just trying to find one thing,
right?

39
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.920
Like we just need one recommendation.

40
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.050
Do that first, but if you wanna have
multiple recommendations it might be nice

41
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.830
to do breadth first because then you
would just have that list at the level.

42
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.560
You know what I mean?

43
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.850
All at the same time.

44
00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:07.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's just,

45
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.920
I feel that it should be two different
trees that you're connecting.

46
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.680
It shouldn't be in the same, like that.

47
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.470
It shouldn't look like this.

48
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.635
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Why?

49
00:02:17.635 --> 00:02:22.954
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Because,
maybe you could have your,

50
00:02:22.954 --> 00:02:27.618
I guess it can look like this but,

51
00:02:34.304 --> 00:02:35.353
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Because I don't know,

52
00:02:35.353 --> 00:02:39.430
it's organized better like if you have
people's recommendations and then.

53
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.546
Then how are the people
connected to each other, and

54
00:02:41.546 --> 00:02:44.542
then the food that heir people
are connected to, that's one way to do it.

55
00:02:44.542 --> 00:02:45.215
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

56
00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:48.353
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Or, I guess, here you
have your food, your first breakfast,

57
00:02:48.353 --> 00:02:50.382
your number one breakfast repetition.

58
00:02:50.382 --> 00:02:50.957
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

59
00:02:50.957 --> 00:02:53.592
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And then you have your
people, and then their recommendation.

60
00:02:53.592 --> 00:02:55.025
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
this is just a traversal,

61
00:02:55.025 --> 00:02:56.620
actually the graph looks like this.

62
00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Right.

63
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.403
That's, yeah.

64
00:03:00.403 --> 00:03:01.550
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: But
when you traverse it,

65
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.437
it kind of starts to look at a tree,
right?

66
00:03:03.437 --> 00:03:04.165
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Right.

67
00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:06.126
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cuz you
only visit each day once.

68
00:03:06.126 --> 00:03:07.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay,
I see what you're saying.

69
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.870
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so
they're actually the same thing.

70
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.442
This is just like a traversal.

71
00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:13.407
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I see what you're saying.

72
00:03:13.407 --> 00:03:14.319
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

73
00:03:16.273 --> 00:03:18.570
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's like
a tree of the traversal.

74
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Right.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: But the graph still is

75
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.030
the same as it was.

76
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: But this traversal, it
shouldn't the traversal be different for

77
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.094
the DFS versus BFS, or are you asking?

78
00:03:27.094 --> 00:03:29.668
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The traversal,
the DFS goes like this.

79
00:03:32.374 --> 00:03:33.157
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yup.

80
00:03:33.157 --> 00:03:34.971
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And
then the BFS goes like this.

81
00:03:34.971 --> 00:03:35.505
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I see what you're saying.

82
00:03:35.505 --> 00:03:36.430
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

83
00:03:39.407 --> 00:03:41.955
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So
the DFS looks better because,

84
00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:47.550
at least you'll know if there's
recommendations right away.

85
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.240
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yup, yeah,
I mean you do a lot less work.

86
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.410
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: To get a recommendation.

87
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.100
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, right, so like
this one, we would have to do one, two,

88
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.490
three, four, five, and if there was even
more, right, keep going until we got here.

89
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.750
And you can imagine this could be huge.

90
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.380
Yeah, I like those few things, but there
are a lot of things I like for breakfast,

91
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.650
and there's a lot of things that
my friends like for breakfast.

92
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.862
So, yeah.

93
00:04:13.858 --> 00:04:15.634
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay,
there is no issue with your code,

94
00:04:15.634 --> 00:04:17.273
there's just an issue with my code.

95
00:04:17.273 --> 00:04:25.744
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay
[LAUGH] all right, great.

96
00:04:25.744 --> 00:04:31.450
All right, so just like thinking more
about breadth first search and depth

97
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.680
first search, and just these traversals
in general, what they're used for?

98
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.760
What kind of questions come up,
that these are suited for.

99
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.710
So, we have logging and validating
which we've been doing a lot of, right?

100
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.070
We're logging all over the place, but
validating is useful to which you get to

101
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.740
like binary search trees which is,
there's like certain

102
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.070
rules that has to follow and traversing
that and validating it is important.

103
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.034
So, there's similarly like copying is
another thing that you might wanna do,

104
00:05:05.034 --> 00:05:07.269
counting edges or vertices.

105
00:05:07.269 --> 00:05:12.300
There's another one or you even
leaves that we were doing earlier.

106
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.360
Identifying if a component is
connected in a graph like I mentioned,

107
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.010
you can add a note to a graph, but

108
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.290
it doesn't necessarily have to
have an edge to another node.

109
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.460
And so you can test if things
are connected and sort of like a social

110
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.480
media world this might look like is
someone in your LinkedIn network, right.

111
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.792
Or, like are there clicks

112
00:05:37.792 --> 00:05:42.783
in,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I don't know,

113
00:05:42.783 --> 00:05:45.340
Twitter, what else?

114
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.950
And then finding paths or cycles
are pretty common interview question.

115
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:55.990
So a path is, can you get from
point A to point B, right?

116
00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.000
And then cycles is,
can you start at point A and

117
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.099
come back to point A through this graph?

118
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:11.150
So detecting cycles, finding paths,
shortest paths, things like that.

119
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.660
So shortest path's gonna be
breadth first search for sure.

120
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.095
There's a few different
algorithms to get you there, but

121
00:06:17.095 --> 00:06:21.453
they're all breadth first search
base algorithms with optimizations.
