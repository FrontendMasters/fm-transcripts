00:00:00.275 --> 00:00:04.968
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we wanna have a smarter recommendation

2
00:00:04.968 --> 00:00:10.203
engine to power our morning routine,
right?

3
00:00:10.203 --> 00:00:11.929
Optimal success, that's the goal.

4
00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:13.612
We need to have breakfast.

5
00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:18.960
So we need to model our data better
to give us these recommendations.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.537
So the natural choice for
this is gonna be a graph, right?

7
00:00:21.537 --> 00:00:26.368
So we have many preferences with
relationships to one another.

8
00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:32.086
So graphs show relationships of
things to other things, right?

9
00:00:32.086 --> 00:00:36.709
We draw that with circles and lines, but
we'll see what that looks like in code and

10
00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:37.990
a little bit.

11
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.178
But first,
let's take a stab at drawing a graph.

12
00:00:42.178 --> 00:00:49.765
So get your paper back out, and
we have three friends here.

13
00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:53.193
First one is me,
I like coffee, toast, and tea.

14
00:00:53.193 --> 00:00:56.230
And we have another friend,
she likes coffee, eggs, and tea.

15
00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.553
And then I have another friend,
our friend,

16
00:01:01.553 --> 00:01:06.747
he likes coffee, iced tea, and also eggs.

17
00:01:06.747 --> 00:01:12.543
So let's take a stab at
what this might look like,

18
00:01:12.543 --> 00:01:16.279
drawn out with relationships.

19
00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:19.080
Just guess, it doesn't have to be right.

20
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.309
Some things to consider is, do you want
to include the people on this graph?

21
00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:24.659
Do you wanna exclude them?

22
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:34.848
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
I guess that's the main thing and why?

23
00:01:34.848 --> 00:01:39.874
So here I am, I am just putting the toast.

24
00:01:39.874 --> 00:01:45.364
So I just kinda changed this where I'm
thinking about excluding the people.

25
00:01:45.364 --> 00:01:50.818
We'll talk about like why or why not,
but let's just draw out the food

26
00:01:50.818 --> 00:01:56.012
relationship and we'll talk about
in a few minutes why or why not.

27
00:01:56.012 --> 00:01:59.715
We may want to exclude or
include the people.

28
00:01:59.715 --> 00:02:04.012
So I like coffee, I also like toast.

29
00:02:04.012 --> 00:02:05.519
We draw a line, right?

30
00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:06.478
We've been doing this for a while.

31
00:02:06.478 --> 00:02:09.682
If you've been taking data structures and
algorithms, we put a thing,

32
00:02:09.682 --> 00:02:11.214
we put a thing, and we draw a line.

33
00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:12.637
And we draw another line, right?

34
00:02:12.637 --> 00:02:17.992
And we keep doing this until we have
a bunch of lines connecting our nodes.

35
00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:21.440
Except this is a graph, so
we call these vertices.

36
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.980
So a node in a graph, it's called
a vertex, you could call it a node, but

37
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.481
it's called a vertex.

38
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:32.726
And the relationships
represented by the line

39
00:02:32.726 --> 00:02:37.977
is called an edge, and
so it's interesting.

40
00:02:37.977 --> 00:02:44.737
Think in your head like what that could
look like in code, just think about it.

41
00:02:44.737 --> 00:02:49.288
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Only coffee is
connected to toast and egg and

42
00:02:49.288 --> 00:02:54.688
iced tea
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

43
00:02:54.688 --> 00:02:56.278
what's the question exactly?

44
00:02:56.278 --> 00:03:00.184
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I mean I'm just saying that
information we need to put into that

45
00:03:00.184 --> 00:03:00.914
graph.

46
00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:03.763
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, it's definitely
like something we would need to store.

47
00:03:03.763 --> 00:03:07.423
Definitely we need to know,
we've had to store the objects and

48
00:03:07.423 --> 00:03:09.852
then we have to store the relationships.

49
00:03:09.852 --> 00:03:14.884
Yeah, but the thing about what else
I wanna tell you about graphs.

50
00:03:14.884 --> 00:03:17.629
There's so much to say.

51
00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.363
We can just keep it like this.

52
00:03:19.363 --> 00:03:21.065
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can you
add other categories?

53
00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:24.243
It can be food and
drink or [INAUDIBLE] or?

54
00:03:24.243 --> 00:03:28.475
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You could,
I mean that's the cool thing actually that

55
00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:32.339
I should say about graphs is that is so
flexible and

56
00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:34.919
there in lies the power, right?

57
00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.933
Because we could put people and
food in it,

58
00:03:38.933 --> 00:03:43.960
you can do some really cool
stuff based on all of that.

59
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.433
You can model a lot of real
life things with a graph.

60
00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:53.383
From maps, Google Maps, totally a graph.

61
00:03:53.383 --> 00:03:58.843
Even modeling like in
Princeton's computer science

62
00:03:58.843 --> 00:04:04.918
algorithms one class,
they talk about this percolation.

63
00:04:04.918 --> 00:04:11.581
So they model gravel,
a rock in space, as a graph.

64
00:04:11.581 --> 00:04:15.927
And you can find the path to
see how the water runs through,

65
00:04:15.927 --> 00:04:17.887
if it is permeable or not.

66
00:04:17.887 --> 00:04:22.498
So you can model,
literally rocks in spaces,

67
00:04:22.498 --> 00:04:25.698
to see if water can run through.

68
00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:28.598
Also, genetics and stuff like that.

69
00:04:28.598 --> 00:04:31.914
So graph theory as of subject, it's huge.

70
00:04:31.914 --> 00:04:34.449
There's so
many things that you can do with it.

71
00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.339
Today, we'll just learn the very first
things that you need to know, and

72
00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:41.312
then you can go online and
read about all the cool stuff.
