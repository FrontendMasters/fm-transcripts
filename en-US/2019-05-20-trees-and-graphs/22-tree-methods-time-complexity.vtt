00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.554
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Let's talk about
time complexity super quick, insert.

2
00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:11.802
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You guys remember
how you implemented your insert?

3
00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.650
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What do you think,
do you have it open?

4
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.390
You can look at the solutions,
they're there.

5
00:00:22.993 --> 00:00:24.280
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Wild guess?

6
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.260
Someone who's quiet.

7
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.120
How about, I feel like this area,

8
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.000
you guys are really either focused or
really not focused.

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.730
Just take a stab, what do you think?

10
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.750
We need to add a node into our tree.

11
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.114
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If we're adding a node
to an array that contains children,

12
00:00:42.114 --> 00:00:43.748
it'd be in a constant time.

13
00:00:43.748 --> 00:00:46.060
We're just adding it to the end.

14
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.740
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm, yeah,
if you add it to the end, for sure.

15
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.460
If you have reference to that node, right?

16
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.736
So if we wanted to give 2 a child,
2 has an array of

17
00:00:59.736 --> 00:01:04.896
children that are empty
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

18
00:01:04.896 --> 00:01:10.940
it would just be like,
children.push, right, easy.

19
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.904
If we don't have a reference to 2,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: How

20
00:01:15.904 --> 00:01:17.200
does that change things?

21
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We'll
have to traverse to it.

22
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.910
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

23
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So it's at least linear.

24
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.183
For some reason, I wanna say log,
but I don't know why.

25
00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:33.156
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You don't have to traverse

26
00:01:33.156 --> 00:01:36.896
all the trees, so it's not gonna just
necessarily go into at least linear.

27
00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:38.800
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Right, but
we have to think worst case scenario.

28
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We have to be like,

29
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.970
okay, what if it's in
the farthest reaches of our tree,

30
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.380
then we'd have to say linear, yeah.

31
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.069
So it's linear if you had to look for
it, right?

32
00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.985
Cuz traversing is linear.

33
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.724
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Counting
the recommendations?

34
00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:01.093
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You'd have
to touch everything again.

35
00:02:01.093 --> 00:02:02.546
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, linear.
