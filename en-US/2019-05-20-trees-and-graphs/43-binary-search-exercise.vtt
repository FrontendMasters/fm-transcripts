00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.981
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then let's
skip ahead and talk about the find and

2
00:00:03.981 --> 00:00:08.149
search operation and
we'll do it together all at once.

3
00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.198
So, this a binary search tree, right?

4
00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:16.516
So, we need to be able to find/search for
the thing that we are looking for right?

5
00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:20.480
So we are trying to detect if
something is in collection.

6
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.426
And we are gonna need to traverse
the tree to find that value, right?

7
00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:31.850
So, with no numbers here, we can know
that we will take our value and we will

8
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.330
compare it to this node and we'll say,
is this value less than or greater than?

9
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.070
If the value is greater than,
we go to the right.

10
00:00:40.698 --> 00:00:46.346
We compare it to this node now,
if the value is less than or greater than.

11
00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:50.890
If it's less than, for example,
we would go to the left.

12
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.030
And this has no children.

13
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.940
So if this isn't it,
then it doesn't exist on this tree.

14
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.159
Does that make sense?

15
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.322
Cool.

16
00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:08.615
So let's say that we are looking for
15, let's look for 15.

17
00:01:08.615 --> 00:01:12.380
So we'll start at eight,
greater than or less than.

18
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.342
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Greater.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Greater,

19
00:01:14.342 --> 00:01:15.450
everyone knows that, right?

20
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.920
Greater, we know, compare,
less than or greater than?

21
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Greater.

22
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.901
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Greater.

23
00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:23.557
Less than or greater than?

24
00:01:23.557 --> 00:01:24.191
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Greater.

25
00:01:24.191 --> 00:01:25.840
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Greater.

26
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.249
Is there a 15 there?

27
00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:31.070
No.
So, this does not contain our value,

28
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.870
yeah pretty straight forward, all right.

29
00:01:35.216 --> 00:01:39.070
So letâ€™s take some of our
last moments together,

30
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.070
15 minutes,
to take a stab at our binary search tree.

31
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.040
I know it's been a long day.

32
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.270
Well, let's just take a stab at it.

33
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.240
It's easier than the graph.

34
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.530
So I think it's a nice thing.

35
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.232
We'll end on top,
we'll have completed something.
