1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.281
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, we're gonna
do it, we're gonna walk through it again.

2
00:00:07.017 --> 00:00:09.965
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right,
so let's simplify our

3
00:00:09.965 --> 00:00:14.844
tree,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: To,

4
00:00:16.978 --> 00:00:17.765
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Look something

5
00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:18.372
like this.

6
00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:23.834
So we have a and we have b and c,

7
00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:34.068
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then c contains d.

8
00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.024
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Does that make sense?

9
00:00:43.024 --> 00:00:44.020
So we have a tree.

10
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.020
The root note is A.

11
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.350
Then we have B.

12
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.820
We have C.

13
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.418
And then we have D.

14
00:00:55.418 --> 00:00:58.373
Yeah.

15
00:00:58.373 --> 00:01:01.328
Okay.

16
00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:09.254
So, let's look for
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The value

17
00:01:11.206 --> 00:01:13.615
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Here.

18
00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:19.105
So we'll have left and right, well,
we'll keep yes, on that one's fine, okay.

19
00:01:19.105 --> 00:01:24.320
So the first thing, let's look for D.

20
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.390
Actually, let's look for C.

21
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.210
So we're gonna pass this value, C.

22
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.049
So for our first one,

23
00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.540
is this .value is what?

24
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A equal to C,
that's gonna be false.

25
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.680
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

26
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.983
And then we jump here.

27
00:01:43.983 --> 00:01:47.678
That was a little weird, but
we can get through this.

28
00:01:47.678 --> 00:01:52.010
So this .yes which is gonna be a left.

29
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.829
Iâ€™ll just call it left.

30
00:01:59.438 --> 00:01:59.938
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

31
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.710
So Stefanie do we have a this .left?

32
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yes.

33
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.240
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

34
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.770
And because we have a this.left we
can move on to the second side.

35
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.990
What if this was false, what would happen?

36
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It would check the
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It

37
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.710
would just skip this.

38
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.250
Yeah.

39
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.580
Okay.
But it's not false so, we don't skip it.

40
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.737
We call this,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Eli,

41
00:02:24.737 --> 00:02:27.540
what happens next?

42
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well it's gonna do
another contains on the b tree,

43
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.980
the tree that has b's above it.

44
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.580
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah so
we're gonna do another contains.

45
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.070
This is gonna say does b equal c?

46
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.280
No.

47
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.690
Kareem, what's gonna happen next here?

48
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Gonna check to see if

49
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.910
there is a right I guess or-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Well.

50
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's gonna go
to see if there's a left.

51
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.770
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
exactly, is there a left?

52
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:04.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No.

53
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.488
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,
Seth, what happens next?

54
00:03:06.488 --> 00:03:08.583
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's gonna
check if there's a right.

55
00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:11.330
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so
it skips over this completely,

56
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.490
it's gonna check if there's a right,
is there a right?

57
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.016
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's not.

58
00:03:14.016 --> 00:03:16.187
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What happens next,
Aisha?

59
00:03:22.907 --> 00:03:24.056
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It goes
back to the beginning.

60
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.150
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
so we return here.

61
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.100
What are we going to return?

62
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.300
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: False.

63
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.107
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: False, okay.

64
00:03:34.107 --> 00:03:39.847
So,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We're done with this,

65
00:03:39.847 --> 00:03:42.510
we're gonna pop it up, here.

66
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.990
This is now false, right?

67
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.468
Do you see how that happened?

68
00:03:51.468 --> 00:03:54.596
This returned false.

69
00:03:56.843 --> 00:03:59.481
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay?

70
00:03:59.481 --> 00:04:01.329
So, false.

71
00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:02.390
Okay?

72
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.770
Remember we are back at a.

73
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:12.730
All right, so the next thing
we're gonna check, who's next?

74
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.390
Sony, what's the next thing that happens?

75
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.668
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You will check on c.

76
00:04:19.668 --> 00:04:28.755
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so this.right
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We have it so

77
00:04:28.755 --> 00:04:32.615
then we then call it again.

78
00:04:32.615 --> 00:04:33.880
Like this.

79
00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:39.290
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right,
so we're at C now.

80
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.241
So C equals C.

81
00:04:46.132 --> 00:04:47.226
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Is gonna return true.

82
00:04:47.226 --> 00:04:50.689
So we know we're getting
down here returns true.

83
00:04:53.753 --> 00:04:55.865
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And
so this evaluates to?

84
00:04:55.865 --> 00:04:57.434
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: True.

85
00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.554
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And
what does this return?

86
00:05:03.554 --> 00:05:04.899
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's true.

87
00:05:08.082 --> 00:05:08.802
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So it works?

88
00:05:10.514 --> 00:05:11.482
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Looks like it works.

89
00:05:13.642 --> 00:05:15.764
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, any questions?

90
00:05:15.764 --> 00:05:20.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Do we need to check the edge
case of where we are looking for it now,

91
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.478
when it doesn't exist in the tree
to make sure that that execution

92
00:05:24.478 --> 00:05:26.952
path will still return as we expect?

93
00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:27.704
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, sure.

94
00:05:27.704 --> 00:05:30.770
So, I think, the execution path
is gonna be the same as this.

95
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.027
It would be false or false.

96
00:05:33.027 --> 00:05:33.920
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

97
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.407
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Which is false.

98
00:05:35.407 --> 00:05:36.001
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I believe you.

99
00:05:36.001 --> 00:05:38.137
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, for sure.

100
00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:38.763
But, I think,

101
00:05:38.763 --> 00:05:42.940
if you're feeling like when you're doing
this on your own you're, I'm not sure.

102
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.660
Definitely, definitely do it.

103
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.670
And like, just explore everything.

104
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.630
And the more you do that the more you
kinda get a sense for how this works and

105
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.630
you can kinda pick up on like, okay,

106
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.770
if it works on this size it
should work on that side.

107
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.619
Which is kinda the magic
of working with trees.

108
00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:01.544
Especially binary trees, like you
do one thing on the right side and

109
00:06:01.544 --> 00:06:03.355
one thing on the left side and recursion.

110
00:06:03.355 --> 00:06:08.557
It's the same thing, so if it works on
one side it's gonna work on the other

111
00:06:08.557 --> 00:06:13.181
side generally, but definitely just
test it out on your own time so

112
00:06:13.181 --> 00:06:15.842
that you can feel confident about it.

113
00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:19.647
How we feeling?

114
00:06:19.647 --> 00:06:20.346
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Great.

115
00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:21.139
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Great, or middle?

116
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.150
Middle meaning great, yeah.

117
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.610
It's cool, right?

118
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.864
It's very elegant and
that's what is nice about recursion.

119
00:06:32.864 --> 00:06:37.655
But it's not obvious or
intuitive which is a kind of recursion,

120
00:06:37.655 --> 00:06:42.268
I think in an interview setting
depending on where in your at,

121
00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:46.793
like I would say,
if you're interviewing at a big company,

122
00:06:46.793 --> 00:06:51.406
the expectation is you do recursion,
if it's like a very data

123
00:06:51.406 --> 00:06:55.973
structure algorithm heavy interview,
just do recursion.

124
00:06:55.973 --> 00:06:58.717
But if it seems more,
like there's some interview places and

125
00:06:58.717 --> 00:07:02.092
it tends to be more startups, they kinda
want you to hit the ground running,

126
00:07:02.092 --> 00:07:05.571
they don't care if you know how to reverse
a link list, they wanna know, hey,

127
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:08.788
can you like create this view and
render data if you're on the front end or

128
00:07:08.788 --> 00:07:11.010
whatever backend people do, I don't know.

129
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.840
So then you're more interested in that.

130
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.830
And I say if you're more comfortable doing
an iterative solution in that setting,

131
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:20.460
prefer that.

132
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.096
In a more academic feeling
setting you can prefer

133
00:07:26.096 --> 00:07:30.363
recursion thatâ€™s kinda
how I see it though.
