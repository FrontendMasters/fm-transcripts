00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We are going to take a
stab at implementing breadth first search.

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.260
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.520
go high level again for that one?

4
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.130
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

5
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Before you wanted to go,
just go.

6
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.770
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, absolutely.

7
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.710
So high level breadth first search.

8
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No, it's a depth.

9
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.219
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, for sure.

10
00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:24.990
Breadth-first search is going to
search all of the closest adjacent

11
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.790
nodes before the further ones,
or depth-first is going to

12
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.500
go to the furthest ones first and then
back and then the furthest ones and back.

13
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.069
So it's the order-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How does it go to the next

14
00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.629
one?

15
00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.258
So go up or down and then over, or?

16
00:00:42.258 --> 00:00:43.401
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: For a breadth-first?

17
00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:43.958
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

18
00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.260
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Breadth-first
is going to go in rings.

19
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.980
So it's gonna be,
you're gonna have your center.

20
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.220
And then you have the ones
that are adjacent.

21
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.890
And then you have sort of
the second degree ones.

22
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.549
And then it spirals out like that.

23
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.566
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And does it fill a stack
like how it kind of did that with

24
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:03.920
the other one, or?

25
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.440
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Fills a queue.

26
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A queue.

27
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.140
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, that's
the primary difference between this,

28
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.490
is one uses a stack and one uses a queue.

29
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.830
Yeah, and that changes the order that
we visit, but it's largely the same.
