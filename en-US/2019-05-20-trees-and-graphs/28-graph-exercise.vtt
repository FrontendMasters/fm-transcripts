&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: In
an interview setting,

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.200
I recommend using the adjacency list, but
it is important to understand the pros and

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.550
cons between the adjacency list and
the adjacency matrix.

4
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.780
So as you saw, right,
inserting a node into the adjacency

5
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.110
matrix is much more work than
the adjacency list, right.

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.020
Constant versus linear.

7
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.556
Also, adjacency list takes
up a lot more space, right?

8
00:00:27.556 --> 00:00:31.094
You have to build that whole matrix
even if you don't have a lot of edges,

9
00:00:31.094 --> 00:00:32.950
could be just full of zeroes, right?

10
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.010
So you have all this space for nothing.

11
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.320
Whereas the adjacency list is
only going to track the edges.

12
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.221
However, a pro of the adjacency matrix is,
if you're into

13
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:49.350
matrix math-type stuff,
you can do cool stuff with that.

14
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.660
But that's way over my head.

15
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.480
But if you're into that,
you can look into that.

16
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.930
So that's just a cool thing.

17
00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.520
So with that said, in real life,

18
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.050
practically speaking and
adjacency list is the one you should use.

19
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.470
However, if the adjacency matrix is,
makes more

20
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.550
sense to you because it just kind of looks
more like a real life tangible thing.

21
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.070
You can use it in your interview,
but just note that you

22
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.210
should talk about the pros and
cons with your interviewer ahead of time.

23
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.390
And just be prepared if you're like,

24
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.610
I'm only gonna use an adjacency matrix
when I have a graph traversal question or

25
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.600
whatever, just explain the pros and
the cons.

26
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.450
And also, practice it first because,

27
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.620
even though it might seem easier,
it can actually be a bit trickier.

28
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.600
But everyone's brain is different.

29
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.270
Okay, so right now for
this exercise, the graph exercise,

30
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.660
we are going to implement the constructor.

31
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.060
Adding a node, adding an edge, and
removing a node of an adjacency list.
