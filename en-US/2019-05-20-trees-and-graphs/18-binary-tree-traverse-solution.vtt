00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.647
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, so
we wanna do a few things here.

2
00:00:03.647 --> 00:00:06.418
We're gonna do a traverse and contains.

3
00:00:06.418 --> 00:00:11.440
Let's go back over to our guy over here.

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.679
Let's take our class, and we'll just
copy it over and we'll do it together.

5
00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:23.471
So we can leave our,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Traverse as

6
00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:27.890
notes that we can reference for ourselves.

7
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.816
Okay, again this is a little bit
different because we're creating a class.

8
00:00:30.816 --> 00:00:34.730
We're gonna see this and whatnot, okay?

9
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.635
So, for each tree we wanna give it,
we know we had our question

10
00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:45.140
= question kind of deal.

11
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.720
Here we go.

12
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.870
Okay.

13
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:48.970
So we have a question.

14
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.897
And then we're gonna have our yes and
our no.

15
00:00:50.897 --> 00:00:51.930
Does this?

16
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.680
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,
this is our binary tree with yes and no.

17
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.196
Okay?
If you did it with left and

18
00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:04.712
right that's totally fine.

19
00:01:04.712 --> 00:01:07.725
And in the solutions you'll see
that it's also left and right.

20
00:01:07.725 --> 00:01:13.915
Okay, so we have a traverse here.

21
00:01:13.915 --> 00:01:18.890
And often with our traverse we want to
we want it to take like a function.

22
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.671
So once you visit every node you
might want to do some work, right?

23
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:26.090
So, so far we've been console logging, but

24
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.415
there are a variety of things you
might want to do on each node.

25
00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:36.013
Maybe you're validating that
the data there is correct.

26
00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:38.957
Maybe you're looking for

27
00:01:38.957 --> 00:01:44.047
something in the sense of contains, right?

28
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.678
Yeah, all kinds of fun
things we do with traverse.

29
00:01:49.678 --> 00:01:55.840
All right, so as you might

30
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.700
notice in the exercise as well, there are
different orders that you can traverse.

31
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.090
But we can just work
with what we have here.

32
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:11.015
We can just start with this, and
we'll adapt it for our class, okay?

33
00:02:11.015 --> 00:02:15.020
So right off the bat, we know that
this tree.name isn't relevant, right?

34
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.701
Right, so we want this.question, right?

35
00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:28.790
So the first time we get here we're just
gonna print out the question, right?

36
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.950
What if we wanted to do
something different?

37
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.127
What if we wanted to pass a function
here to be called,instead of, so

38
00:02:37.127 --> 00:02:40.350
console.log is a function, right?

39
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.880
Console is like a DOM object.

40
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.474
Log is a method.

41
00:02:46.474 --> 00:02:48.660
And we call it like we would.

42
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.590
Sometimes when you see things
a lot you kind of take it for

43
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.062
granted and don't break down what it is.

44
00:02:53.062 --> 00:02:57.926
So console.log is just a question,
so we can pass our function here and

45
00:02:57.926 --> 00:03:01.345
we can replace console.log
with some function.

46
00:03:01.345 --> 00:03:09.690
And when we call it let's
see we have myTree.traverse.

47
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.390
We can actually just pass in console.log
here and it will do the same thing.

48
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.579
Everyone following?

49
00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.748
Yes, can I get some thumbs, we're good?

50
00:03:20.748 --> 00:03:23.009
Right, awesome.

51
00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:28.319
So we have our question, and
this is gonna be different too, right?

52
00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.443
Because we don't have an array,

53
00:03:32.443 --> 00:03:37.320
we have two different property names.

54
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.722
How did you guys handle
it when you did this?

55
00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:48.049
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I called in order
transversal on this.left, and

56
00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.530
then called it on this.right.

57
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:59.015
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
So we just recurse, right?

58
00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:00.285
Again you can say,

59
00:04:08.431 --> 00:04:10.441
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Something like that,

60
00:04:10.441 --> 00:04:12.138
seem reasonable?
