1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.480
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And we're gonna
talk about the implementation, right?

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.020
I asked you guy to think a little bit
about how this might look in code.

3
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.313
And we're gonna break it down.

4
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.300
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, so
what data needs to be stored?

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.230
Two main things, right,
we need you to have the objects.

6
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.834
And the relationships, right?

7
00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:27.493
So the object is being our food or
our people and or

8
00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:33.187
our people and the relationships
being the lines or edges.

9
00:00:36.528 --> 00:00:39.635
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, we're gonna
be using numbers to simplify, but

10
00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:43.160
you can imagine that
this could be anything.

11
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.516
Some data structures you need
the value to be comparable, right?

12
00:00:48.516 --> 00:00:52.080
So we can compare like greater or
less than something like that.

13
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.304
And those numbers are important for that.

14
00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:57.940
But in a graph, we're still flexible but
we just use it for simplifying a label.

15
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.341
Okay, so there are three

16
00:01:06.341 --> 00:01:14.102
main ways to represent a graph.

17
00:01:14.102 --> 00:01:15.665
I'm going to tell you about two, and

18
00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:19.057
I'll give you a recommendation about
which one to use in an interview setting.

19
00:01:19.057 --> 00:01:24.246
And I also want you to be open minded,
like I've been saying this whole time.

20
00:01:24.246 --> 00:01:25.893
That this is computer science,

21
00:01:25.893 --> 00:01:28.830
there are many ways to solve
lots of different problems.

22
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.690
And it's up to you to think critically
about your particular problem that

23
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.436
you're solving.

24
00:01:32.436 --> 00:01:39.099
Whether it's on the job, or at work,
or whatever it may be in your mind,

25
00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:44.480
I don't know,
to model it to suit your needs, cool.

26
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.139
So the first one is
the adjacent matrix and

27
00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:55.142
we're going to use that to
create our graph, right?

28
00:01:55.142 --> 00:01:57.445
Because we can't code just circles and

29
00:01:57.445 --> 00:02:01.180
lines we have to deal with
what we have access to.

30
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.200
Right, we have ones and
zeros, and we have, you

31
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.120
know, one through five as well,
but that's not what this is.

32
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.370
This is a matrix.

33
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.970
Have you guys worked at all with matrices?

34
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.890
Yea, a little bit.

35
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.206
Like in math class, maybe.

36
00:02:24.206 --> 00:02:30.069
So the adjacency matrix, a matrix is
basically an array inside of an array,

37
00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.460
right, when we get down to it.

38
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.770
It looks something like this.

39
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.710
I like this picture better though.

40
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.230
And so how we are modeling the
relationships here is with the ones and

41
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.180
zeros, okay?

42
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.670
How we're modeling the data
itself is through these vertices.

43
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.830
So one is one.

44
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.890
So one does not have
a relationship with itself.

45
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.309
So is zero okay.

46
00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:04.800
2 is connected to 1,
as we can see here with this line.

47
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.270
So we add a 1 here, and
we also add a 1 here.

48
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.850
And so on and so forth.

49
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.050
So here our Edges.

50
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.453
Here are our Vertices.

51
00:03:16.862 --> 00:03:18.350
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool?

52
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.940
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So 3 is connected to 0?

53
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.550
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So 3,
we can look at 3 is connected to 2.

54
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.160
3 is also connected to 4.

55
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I see. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And that's it.

56
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.790
Yeah.

57
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.066
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So shouldn't 1 and
1 should also be 1?

58
00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:45.810
I mean, that's called

59
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.660
a self loop and
in this case we don't have self loops.

60
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.635
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

61
00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:57.621
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I'm kind of confused where
did we lose the people in the whole

62
00:03:57.621 --> 00:03:59.058
equation.

63
00:03:59.058 --> 00:04:00.032
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

64
00:04:00.032 --> 00:04:01.292
Where did we lose the people?

65
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.070
We'll get there.

66
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.260
We're gonna start with this and
then the people will be back.

67
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.270
You have a question.

68
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.044
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: This is a dumb question, but
oaky, one is connected to, okay I get it.

69
00:04:14.044 --> 00:04:15.150
Now I get it.
Never mind.

70
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.549
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, cool.

71
00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:22.990
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right,
so Adjacency Matrix.

72
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.570
Here's the code.

73
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.361
Awesome, okay.

74
00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:33.674
So now that we know that this is a 2D
array, we wanna add an edge, and

75
00:04:33.674 --> 00:04:35.436
an edge is a relationship.

76
00:04:35.436 --> 00:04:37.925
How do we represent an edge again?

77
00:04:37.925 --> 00:04:40.237
With the number One or zero?

78
00:04:40.237 --> 00:04:44.909
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: One, one is the edge
zero is the lack of an entrenched.

79
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.150
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we'll pass like a couple of vertices and

80
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.380
we will set it to one.

81
00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:00.930
So our adjacency matrix, we can call
it this, we have v1 at v2, right?

82
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.074
Equals to 1.

83
00:05:03.074 --> 00:05:06.240
Of course this is not exact,
this is a little bit naive.

84
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.527
Right, there's a little bit more
that needs to happen here, right?

85
00:05:08.527 --> 00:05:14.420
Because this is actually the 0th index for
example, it's not 1.

86
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.140
But you can imagine, right?

87
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.250
It's pretty simple, right?

88
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.852
We're just kinda toggling
these values to add an edge.

89
00:05:28.525 --> 00:05:33.702
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So the v1 is this way,
v2 is that, down this way?

90
00:05:33.702 --> 00:05:37.260
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So the v1 and the v2,

91
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:44.440
these are just variable names so we could.

92
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.990
For example, call this, I wish this is,
it used to let me edit this.

93
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Why do
you wanna add an edge?

94
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.540
I mean, maybe there's.

95
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.310
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Why
you wanna add an iedge?

96
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.600
Like what if, for example,
like I suddenly started to also like eggs.

97
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.130
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

98
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.780
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then I wanna
have that relationship represented.

99
00:06:05.284 --> 00:06:08.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Maybe I'll, afterwards.

100
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.052
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
do you wanna add an edge.

101
00:06:10.052 --> 00:06:13.777
So what if like, I wanted to,
say this was a map, right?

102
00:06:13.777 --> 00:06:19.180
This is a city, and these are like
intersections and these are roads.

103
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.242
And actually let's say these are points of
interest and these are roads between them.

104
00:06:23.242 --> 00:06:25.904
Let's say that it's approved and

105
00:06:25.904 --> 00:06:31.160
we're gonna build a row between
these two points of interest.

106
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.682
So we wanna add a new Edge
to connect these, yeah.

107
00:06:36.682 --> 00:06:39.584
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And another
thing that we'll talk about soon is,

108
00:06:39.584 --> 00:06:42.360
what if we wanna add
another point of interest?

109
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.230
So that would be adding
a node to our graph.

110
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:48.720
Another interesting thing,

111
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.480
is that you can add a node to a graph,
even if there's no edge.

112
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.440
So you can have sort of like
these disconnected components.

113
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.346
That's kind of fun, so
we'll talk more about that.

114
00:07:00.346 --> 00:07:06.307
Okay, so we add in an edge,
this is just adding an edge and

115
00:07:06.307 --> 00:07:11.543
removing an edge,
very similar, we set to zero.

116
00:07:11.543 --> 00:07:15.243
Again, don't copy and paste this,
this is not actual code,

117
00:07:15.243 --> 00:07:17.890
it's just kind of demonstrating, right?

118
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.729
Like we don't [INAUDIBLE] actually isn't
defined, you're gonna get errors but

119
00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:23.448
this just.

120
00:07:23.448 --> 00:07:26.994
To get the gist.

121
00:07:26.994 --> 00:07:28.009
Do you guys get the gist?

122
00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:29.240
Is it working?

123
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.008
Okay, awesome, all right,

124
00:07:33.008 --> 00:07:37.688
time complexity for adding an edge.

125
00:07:37.688 --> 00:07:39.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Constant time.

126
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.350
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Constant time,
removing an edge?

127
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.130
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Constant.

128
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.019
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You
guys are good at this.

129
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.655
All right, so that's adjacency matrix.
