00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.007
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Hello,
welcome everyone.

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:06.357
This is an introduction to Graphs and
Trees.

3
00:00:06.357 --> 00:00:12.093
This is Part 3 and 4 of my four part
course on Practical Data Structures and

4
00:00:12.093 --> 00:00:15.748
Algorithms geared for
technical interviews.

5
00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:23.210
So let's just talk about an overview
of an interview data structure.

6
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:30.030
So these are the main ones that are listed
and, cracking the coding interview.

7
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.760
Highly recommend if you don't have a copy,
all of these sort of

8
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.678
like online tutorials as well as
most Computer Science courses.

9
00:00:39.678 --> 00:00:43.765
When I was developing this course, I took
a punch of syllabuses from university

10
00:00:43.765 --> 00:00:48.044
courses and kind of cross-referenced, and
just picked out the most common ones.

11
00:00:48.044 --> 00:00:53.518
And also the ones that you actually
will get asked about in an interview.

12
00:00:53.518 --> 00:00:58.797
Cool, so we have arrays and strings, hash
tables, linked lists, stacks and queues.

13
00:00:58.797 --> 00:01:00.200
We covered that prior.

14
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.110
And today we're gonna to talk about
graphs, and we're gonna talk about trees.

15
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.098
So graphs we use to model complex
relationships between objects.

16
00:01:10.098 --> 00:01:15.231
And trees are pretty similar
to graphs except that we

17
00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:20.257
have a hierarchical
relationship between nodes.

18
00:01:20.257 --> 00:01:25.181
Cool, so we're gonna cover trees,
graphs, and binary search trees.

19
00:01:25.181 --> 00:01:28.909
And we're gonna start from
like small tidbits and

20
00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.977
we're gonna build and build and
build until we have a full picture.

21
00:01:33.977 --> 00:01:36.964
And so that's just what to expect,
we're gonna ramp slow.

22
00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:40.409
And so you're gonna need to keep
each piece for the next piece.

23
00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.442
So if there's any point where
you're confused, please stop me.

24
00:01:44.442 --> 00:01:49.019
Cuz it's gonna be required that you
understand each piece to understand

25
00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:50.527
the next piece, cool?

26
00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:54.385
Can I get a commitment from everyone that
you'll stop me when you have questions?

27
00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:55.683
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yep, yes.

28
00:01:55.683 --> 00:01:58.310
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Awesome,
can I get a verbal yes from everyone?

29
00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.435
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

30
00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:00.618
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Feel
like more excited?

31
00:02:00.618 --> 00:02:02.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, woo.

32
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.918
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You didn't do it.

33
00:02:02.918 --> 00:02:05.399
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH] It's okay,

34
00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.119
I forgive you, but next time, next time.

35
00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.365
Awesome, thank you.

36
00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:15.537
Okay, so some tips on how to be effective.

37
00:02:15.537 --> 00:02:18.792
First of all, don't memorize,
it's not gonna help you.

38
00:02:18.792 --> 00:02:21.984
You wanna learn sort of
this overarching themes so

39
00:02:21.984 --> 00:02:24.721
you can apply them to different problems.

40
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:29.078
You wanna practice, so first of all,
practice, practice, practice but

41
00:02:29.078 --> 00:02:30.746
also practice with a timer.

42
00:02:30.746 --> 00:02:36.753
If you're learning this for an interview,
you're interview is gonna be timed.

43
00:02:36.753 --> 00:02:39.429
There's probably gonna be 30 minutes or
an hour.

44
00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:41.727
And so,
if you're going through these problems and

45
00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:45.240
it's taking you more than 30 minutes or
an hour depending on the complexity.

46
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.252
Just note that, and then keep
practicing so you can get faster.

47
00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:51.807
Reading about it doesn't count.

48
00:02:51.807 --> 00:02:55.275
So someone said here that they,
who was it that likes to watch but

49
00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.408
doesn't actually like to code it out.

50
00:02:57.408 --> 00:02:59.324
Was that you, Eli?

51
00:02:59.324 --> 00:03:01.341
And Joe, did you also say that?

52
00:03:01.341 --> 00:03:03.065
That you-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yes, I did.

53
00:03:03.065 --> 00:03:04.349
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That you
didn't like to practice?

54
00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.111
Okay, yeah, so hate to break
it to you all, doesn't count.

55
00:03:09.111 --> 00:03:12.898
It's cool, you can talk about
theoretically, but we're programmers here.

56
00:03:12.898 --> 00:03:14.058
We have to program this out.

57
00:03:14.058 --> 00:03:18.380
So we need to take that theory and
we need to actually apply it to code.

58
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.179
Because that's the point, right?

59
00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:27.423
And also, just in life,
communicate, be nice.

60
00:03:27.423 --> 00:03:29.542
This also applies to interviews.

61
00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:34.246
Just treat it like any relationship
you would cultivate with someone.

62
00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:38.928
Respect, kindness,
they're not there to attack you.

63
00:03:38.928 --> 00:03:45.966
So those are my main tips for interviews
and learning this kind of stuff.

64
00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:48.122
Any questions?

65
00:03:48.122 --> 00:03:51.155
Anyone else have a tip that
they would like to offer?

66
00:03:51.155 --> 00:03:54.631
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: With the practice,
do you also suggest practicing,

67
00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:58.814
like doing it on a whiteboard as
well as doing it on the computer.

68
00:03:58.814 --> 00:04:02.630
Since so many interviews
still use the whiteboard, and

69
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.157
don't actually give you a machine.

70
00:04:05.157 --> 00:04:10.605
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, personally,
I don't practice on a whiteboard.

71
00:04:10.605 --> 00:04:14.087
But I could see that it
could be really useful.

72
00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:17.577
Especially if you feel like you're
gonna be nervous about that,

73
00:04:17.577 --> 00:04:21.904
like the change in the environment,
if that makes you uncomfortable, kill it.

74
00:04:21.904 --> 00:04:24.688
Just keep do it all in
a whiteboard until it gets easier.

75
00:04:24.688 --> 00:04:29.430
The reason I don't practice in
the whiteboard personally is because it's

76
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.280
just slower and it's messier,
and that kind of bothers me.

77
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.582
So I guess you could practice
making it really neat.

78
00:04:37.582 --> 00:04:40.913
Starting up at the very top,
writing really small,

79
00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:43.877
making lots of spaces
in between everything.

80
00:04:43.877 --> 00:04:48.790
But I also don't own a whiteboard,
yeah, but that's good.

81
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.699
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Applications.

82
00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.857
So finding something you
can apply to something.

83
00:04:53.857 --> 00:04:54.953
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

84
00:04:54.953 --> 00:04:56.396
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: That's how I learned, but

85
00:04:56.396 --> 00:05:00.990
it's very hard with algorithms sometimes
to, because it's like that's the basic.

86
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.108
And then afterwards, you have to
actually build the app, function.

87
00:05:03.108 --> 00:05:05.872
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, for sure.

88
00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:08.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: But it's always
nice to think about it that way,

89
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.139
from that point of view, but
finding that real application is also for

90
00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:13.676
a bunch of different-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

91
00:05:13.676 --> 00:05:14.970
it'll stick too, right?

92
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.294
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It'll be more

93
00:05:16.294 --> 00:05:18.046
interesting, absolutely.

94
00:05:18.046 --> 00:05:19.683
One last tip, who's got it?

95
00:05:24.695 --> 00:05:26.692
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I actually do
the whiteboard thing itself.

96
00:05:26.692 --> 00:05:29.564
At home I painted a whole whiteboard.

97
00:05:29.564 --> 00:05:34.985
So, I code it up, go through this sort
of code kinda deal and then decode it.

98
00:05:34.985 --> 00:05:38.824
And then when I go on my interviews,
I actually take my own pens and markers.

99
00:05:38.824 --> 00:05:40.615
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Wow.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Wipe the board clean,

100
00:05:40.615 --> 00:05:44.546
get ready for it and
it's very impressive to actually do both.

101
00:05:44.546 --> 00:05:46.681
Say I'll talk you through, write a loop,

102
00:05:46.681 --> 00:05:49.186
talk about anything that
tbey want me to discuss.

103
00:05:49.186 --> 00:05:49.736
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

104
00:05:49.736 --> 00:05:52.359
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Code it out on the board and
then if they want me to,

105
00:05:52.359 --> 00:05:53.865
I'll code it on a computer.

106
00:05:53.865 --> 00:05:54.604
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.

107
00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:56.249
I like that your ringer on.

108
00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:57.657
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You're professional

109
00:05:57.657 --> 00:05:59.914
whiteboard that you have to
have your special markers.

110
00:05:59.914 --> 00:06:03.866
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: [LAUGH] They get really,
really, they laugh at that.

111
00:06:03.866 --> 00:06:05.708
They're like,
you came here with your own marker.

112
00:06:05.708 --> 00:06:06.761
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: They'll
remember you though.

113
00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:07.995
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah, that's right.

114
00:06:07.995 --> 00:06:08.998
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: If you can

115
00:06:08.998 --> 00:06:12.181
find a quirk and you go in there,
and you do a really good job,

116
00:06:12.181 --> 00:06:16.503
they're gonna be like, who's that awesome
guy who brought his markers, cool.

117
00:06:16.503 --> 00:06:20.686
All right, cool, and
just some perspective.

118
00:06:20.686 --> 00:06:24.028
We're on a journey.

119
00:06:24.028 --> 00:06:26.207
We're all at different
places on our journey.

120
00:06:26.207 --> 00:06:30.923
And for some of us, this will come easier.

121
00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:35.925
It'll be harder for others, but it's okay.

122
00:06:35.925 --> 00:06:40.759
And manage your time, keep at it,
keep practicing, be present.

123
00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:43.816
Find ease and joy if you can through this.

124
00:06:43.816 --> 00:06:46.057
For some people this
can be really painful.

125
00:06:46.057 --> 00:06:49.195
They're only doing this because
they wanna get a job and

126
00:06:49.195 --> 00:06:52.551
this is like a hurdle that you
have jump through to get a job.

127
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:55.661
And that can be a burden.

128
00:06:55.661 --> 00:07:01.185
But I invite you to just let that go and
try to find joy in it.

129
00:07:01.185 --> 00:07:08.528
Try to find something, just one thing that
is interesting or exciting about this.

130
00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:14.213
And maybe that one thing is your
dream job, or whatever that may be.
