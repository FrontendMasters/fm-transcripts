00:00:00.042 --> 00:00:02.508
&gt;&gt; Jem: I know, some people's domains
probably aren't resolving yet, but

2
00:00:02.508 --> 00:00:04.880
give it a few minutes,
they'll resolve eventually.

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.310
But our server's not
really doing anything, so

4
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.320
let's go ahead and get it set up.

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.400
Right now we're on
the Ubuntu operating system.

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.646
There's two main types
of operating systems.

7
00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:16.930
There's Windows based systems and
there's POSIX based systems, or

8
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.600
we'll say Unix in this particular case.

9
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.306
Windows, there's some flavors.

10
00:00:21.306 --> 00:00:25.180
There's Windows NT, Windows Server.

11
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:32.450
But most of the world uses Unix servers
because they're ubiquitous and they work.

12
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.980
Like, the commands on your Mac
work on a Ubuntu just as well.

13
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.980
And that's what's great about
using a Unix based system.

14
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.270
Mac OS is based on BSD which is
a flavor of Unix, which is based,

15
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.960
it's based on freeBSD, and
that's what OS X is based on.

16
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.670
Linux is a kind of cleaner, more
user-friendly wrapper on a Unix system.

17
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.850
Linux has a ton of flavors.

18
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.560
There's Ubuntu, Debian, those are free.

19
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.280
Red Hat is a paid type
of operating system,

20
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.840
but with Red Hat you get
enterprise-level support.

21
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.273
So they're the ones always patching bugs,
things like that.

22
00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:08.414
But in this case,
we're using Ubuntu as an operating system.

23
00:01:08.414 --> 00:01:11.669
But the great thing about when you
get to the Linux world, there are so

24
00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:13.299
many different flavors of Linux,

25
00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.110
you're guaranteed to find one
that fits your particular style.

26
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.860
I like Ubuntu, it's the most popular
one and it's easy to Google problems.

27
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.140
But again,
you're free to use any one you want.

28
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.870
So, why Unix based system?

29
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.914
Windows is pretty popular.

30
00:01:29.914 --> 00:01:32.764
Windows is by far the most popular
operating system in the world, so

31
00:01:32.764 --> 00:01:34.430
why not use that for servers?

32
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.130
Well, Unix is powerful and it's
ubiquitous, which means it's everywhere.

33
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.750
Unix servers are everywhere.

34
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.740
Most of the Fortune 500 companies
run some sort of Unix server.

35
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.140
And it's open source, which is awesome.

36
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.840
The people that work on Unix
are just mind-blowing smart.

37
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.950
People that have been doing this for
20, 30 years.

38
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.460
They know things about things that,
I can't even.

39
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.249
Like they're,
when you think of old-school hackers,

40
00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:07.180
that's the people that work
on this type of stuff.

41
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.950
We're talking about low
level kernel things.

42
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.150
They're very, very smart.

43
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.074
And Unix is mostly free.

44
00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:13.810
You could download most of the flavors,
other than Red Hat and

45
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.028
a few other paid services.

46
00:02:15.028 --> 00:02:17.570
You could download most of them for
free, which is great.

47
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.540
You can go to Ubuntu and
download, ubuntu.com, and

48
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.410
then dual boot at home if you
want to run Windows and Ubuntu.

49
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.775
Mac, well, they're pretty proprietary, you
can't really dual boot on Mac as easily.

50
00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:32.280
But that's why we're using Unix.

51
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.460
And also what's great about Unix is,
the commands work across all the flavors,

52
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.480
so things like cd, crontab, mkdir, pwd.

53
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.688
Basic commands will always work in
every single flavor because Unix is

54
00:02:45.688 --> 00:02:46.555
Unix is Unix.

55
00:02:46.555 --> 00:02:50.490
Linux is a nice wrap around that and
Mac OS is a nice wrap around BSD, but

56
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.310
at the core, it's still Unix.

57
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.447
So every command that you learn,
that we're learning today,

58
00:02:55.447 --> 00:02:57.470
is gonna work across all the platforms.

59
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.110
And that's cool cuz I, too,
suffer from JavaScript fatigue.

60
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.789
You know, webpack 2 is coming out,
there's a great course coming up.

61
00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:07.926
But a year or two,
they'll probably be on webpack 3,

62
00:03:07.926 --> 00:03:12.588
and webpack 4, and so on and so forth,
and React 3, or whatever, Angular 4.

63
00:03:12.588 --> 00:03:14.697
And JavaScript fatigue's a real thing.

64
00:03:14.697 --> 00:03:18.855
But if you learn Unix systems, this does
not change, this hasn't changed in 20,

65
00:03:18.855 --> 00:03:20.140
30 years.

66
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.902
And it won't change in another 20,
30 years.

67
00:03:21.902 --> 00:03:24.459
So this is valuable life knowledge,

68
00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.010
like how to swim, how to ride a bike,
how to change a tire on a car.

69
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.640
Things that won't change and
you're probably gonna use in the future.

70
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.240
Learning Unix is just,
it's an extremely useful skill.

71
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.570
I know I'm blathering on and on and
on but it's just that powerful and

72
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.740
it's that useful.

73
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.480
So that's why we're using Ubuntu today.

74
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.000
And Ubuntu has two basic flavors.

75
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.180
It has a GUI, it has a desktop.

76
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.740
And the desktop, it's kind of nice.

77
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.370
It's a little clunky for me.

78
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.060
But it also has a command line,
which is what we're doing.

79
00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.030
So we don't have a GUI based system yet
because GUIs are expensive.

80
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.770
It's expensive to send all that graphical
user information over the wire.

81
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.690
So we use command lines, because they're
short, sweet, and very lightweight.

82
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.990
Honestly, I do my development on Mac,
because it's what I want.

83
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.160
It's a clean wrapper on
a Unix-based system with a nice UI.

84
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.850
And that's why I use a Mac and
I don't use a Windows machine to develop.

85
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.830
But lots of people use Ubuntu for their
personal machines, and it's great, too.

86
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.720
It's got a pretty solid core.

87
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.480
It's backed by Canonical Foundation,

88
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.200
which is they kind of own the trademark to
Ubuntu and they work on it all the time.

89
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.980
There's Ubuntu based phones,
tablets, things like that.

90
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.820
Sorry for going off the rails a bit.

91
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.610
But if you're gonna get into Unix,
I recommend Ubuntu.

92
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.422
I'm sure there's someone out there, the
people that are really into this are very

93
00:04:44.422 --> 00:04:46.833
passionate about their particular
flavor of Linux and they're like,

94
00:04:46.833 --> 00:04:48.255
you're wrong Jem, this one's better.

95
00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:52.540
But, hey, I stand by my argument.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Everyone on

96
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.736
FreeBSD, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jem: Do people still use FreeBSD

97
00:04:55.736 --> 00:04:56.458
other than?

98
00:04:56.458 --> 00:04:59.214
Yeah, that's true, yeah.

99
00:04:59.214 --> 00:05:02.634
And not to mention not only
are there a lot of flavors of Unix,

100
00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:05.467
there's a lot of GUIs built
on top of Unix as well.

101
00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:08.507
So this, again,
can be customized any way you want.

102
00:05:08.507 --> 00:05:09.288
It's pretty fun.

103
00:05:09.288 --> 00:05:10.630
It's a pretty fun world to be in.
