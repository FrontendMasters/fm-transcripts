WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.470
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Now, let's buy a domain.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.490
So, we have our server.

3
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.490
It's not really doing much right now, but
we're able to login as a non-root user.

4
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.710
So, let's buy a domain and
let's hook it all up together.

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.650
So, I like namecheap.com.

6
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.750
I'm not sponsored by namecheap.

7
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.580
I don't have any referral codes,
once again.

8
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.180
I really should get on this.

9
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.890
You are free to use any domain that you
currently own, if you already own a few.

10
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.220
Most people own.

11
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.790
Domains, it's what we do.

12
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.050
That's a funny domain, let's buy it.

13
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.440
I own a few, magic8ball.co,
you can go there on your phone sometime,

14
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.380
it's pretty fun.

15
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.260
So, I like Name Cheap just cuz I know
where everything is, that's what I use for

16
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.860
all my domains.

17
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.589
But, you are again free to
do whatever you want, and

18
00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:43.675
if you own a domain use that
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So, I'm gonna login to

19
00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:53.592
namecheap,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And

20
00:00:53.592 --> 00:00:54.730
it's gonna two factor me.

21
00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:00.775
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,
always turn on two factor on your domains.

22
00:01:00.775 --> 00:01:06.175
People, domains are worth money, it's
real estate in the land of the Internet.

23
00:01:06.175 --> 00:01:09.895
And domain hijacking is a very real thing
where people take over your domain and

24
00:01:09.895 --> 00:01:12.685
then sell it to somebody else
before you even knew what happened.

25
00:01:12.685 --> 00:01:15.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Always add two
factor auth to everything.

26
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.920
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Your Google accounts,
your GitHub.

27
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.130
It always surprised me when I log into
GitHub and I see a bunch of people are on

28
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.910
a project with me, and they don't have two
factor aut, it's like, what are you doing?

29
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.052
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Exactly,
that's good life advice.

30
00:01:31.052 --> 00:01:34.590
Two-factor everything,
it's a hassle, but just do it.

31
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.200
It's a bigger hassle to get hacked and
lose all your all your things.

32
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.970
So, I'm gonna go to the my domain list.

33
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.090
After you purchase your domain,

34
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.770
I'll give you time to run through
the steps if you don't have a domain yet.

35
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.115
And yeah, these are all domains I own.

36
00:01:47.115 --> 00:01:49.902
Reallybored.com, I don't think
that's pointed at anything, so

37
00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:51.062
I'm gonna use that domain.

38
00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:00.622
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And
I'm gonna go to the advanced

39
00:02:00.622 --> 00:02:05.174
DNS tab
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: [LAUGH] Mark with

40
00:02:05.174 --> 00:02:07.120
a referral again on it.

41
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah but, the only thing
I don't think he gives you anything, so

42
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.120
I'm not sure it's really worth,
I thought maybe it'd be a free,

43
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.360
I don't think he'd get anything for using
it so it's probably not as big a deal.

44
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.600
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: That's-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You only help Marco.

45
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.019
You don't help yourself out.

46
00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.509
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So, I'll slow down a minute,

47
00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:28.620
cuz I'll give everybody
a chance to catch up.

48
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.590
I'll put the slides back,

49
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.320
but we're gonna jump back to this
particular screen in a second.

50
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.640
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I have a question
about the root again.

51
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.170
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes.

52
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So, if I try to log in to
the root, just to test it, it asks for

53
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.200
a password, is that just
a fake password nothing there?

54
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.420
Is there an actual password for root now?

55
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.340
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: No password, it's a fake.

56
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.920
It's a good way of not giving
away too much on your sever.

57
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.050
You don't want people to
know that root's disabled so

58
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.610
they can keep banging
away at root all day and

59
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.620
it won't get you anywhere,
you can't log in as root anymore.

60
00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.564
But great question.

61
00:03:06.514 --> 00:03:09.070
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So everybody,
let's take a minute or two.

62
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.900
If you have a domain already set up,
perfect.

63
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.720
What we're gonna do is we're gonna point
your domain to your server at this point.

64
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.625
So, you can use GoDaddy.

65
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay now we need
to know what domain you bought,

66
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.690
you have to paste it in the chat.

67
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.640
We want to see-
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I already showed it,

68
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.070
I bought really-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I thought everybody was

69
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.200
gonna buy their own domains.

70
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.590
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah yeah,
everybody buy your own domain, and-

71
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah so buy your own domain,

72
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.913
and paste [LAUGH] your domain into chat.

73
00:03:37.913 --> 00:03:40.020
Okay maybe when we get it running, right?

74
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.558
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Let's, I like cuz I think
that .xyz domains are pretty cheap.

75
00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:49.433
Let's see what they're going for
these days.

76
00:03:49.433 --> 00:03:53.191
Registration-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I just want to see what

77
00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:54.705
names people came up with.

78
00:03:54.705 --> 00:03:57.847
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: [INAUDIBLE]
see what's available.

79
00:03:57.847 --> 00:03:59.379
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Maybe some
people are ashamed.

80
00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:04.674
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: jemrulez.club?

81
00:04:04.674 --> 00:04:08.310
Yeah so these are all 88 cents,
this is the entire year.

82
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.550
So, if you want a real domain,

83
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.810
you could buy a dotcom,
they tend to be a bit more expensive.

84
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.210
But if you just want a test domain,

85
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:22.021
I think this is about as cheap
as you can get Jebrules.press.

86
00:04:22.021 --> 00:04:29.660
I think there's too many
top-level domains, honestly.

87
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.909
Do we really need .win as a?

88
00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:32.079
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] Yeah, .win.

89
00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:32.979
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Jenrules.party.

90
00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.130
&gt;&gt; Group: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I don't need it.

91
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.025
I could buy all these is all.

92
00:04:37.025 --> 00:04:40.389
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] You
know you want jenrules.party.

93
00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.010
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I do.
&gt;&gt; Group: [LAUGH]

94
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.858
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] I can see it in

95
00:04:42.858 --> 00:04:43.390
your face.

96
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.670
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I wonder if we can buy-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We're only one dollar.

97
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.589
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: If jem.party is available,
I want to buy that.

98
00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:54.300
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: The problem is there's

99
00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.290
entire investors that just go with
bots that buy up good domains.

100
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.290
Someone bought all these already.

101
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: $65,000 each.

102
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.500
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,
it's a real business of just buying.

103
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Did someone buy jim.party?

104
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.370
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Let me see.

105
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.523
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: It hasn't shown up yet.

106
00:05:12.523 --> 00:05:16.869
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: jem.download,
jem.win, jem.date.

107
00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:18.601
Yeah, jem.party.

108
00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:21.984
&gt;&gt; Group: [APPLAUSE] It's available,
88 cents.

109
00:05:21.984 --> 00:05:22.897
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: jem.party.

110
00:05:22.897 --> 00:05:24.481
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Okay, I'm doing this.

111
00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:25.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Uh-oh, I gotta go get Mark.

112
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.810
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: $1.06 for
the year, that's not bad.

113
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.280
I'll use whois guard,
that's always useful.

114
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.710
Whois guard just, if you do a whois on
a domain it tells you who the owner is.

115
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.000
And whois guard just protects you and
your personal address.

116
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.790
Cuz, legally, you're supposed to
put your address in for a domain.

117
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.230
But, obviously, most people don't.

118
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.530
And whois guard is just a good way of
keeping spammers from emailing you.

119
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.695
So, I recommend who is guard,
it's free for the first year on namecheap.

120
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.513
And
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does that mean that's gonna

121
00:05:53.513 --> 00:05:55.316
auto renew at 26 bucks?

122
00:05:55.316 --> 00:05:56.481
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It's $2 a year.

123
00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.350
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it $2 a year?

124
00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.591
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No, no I mean the domain

125
00:05:59.591 --> 00:06:00.430
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: This one yeah.

126
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.940
Let me turn off auto renew, good point.

127
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.255
It'll email you before it auto renews but
I don't think I'll need jem.party.

128
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's amazing how
much money people throw down for

129
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.880
some of these domains.

130
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.510
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Think about the first person
to buy, I don't know, Microsoft.com,

131
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.590
in the early, early days.

132
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.212
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.

133
00:06:20.212 --> 00:06:21.255
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Or the good names.

134
00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:24.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well, I've seen even some
domains like top level domains going for

135
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.890
like 160 million.

136
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.396
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just like whatever.com and

137
00:06:30.396 --> 00:06:37.711
somebody's been sitting on it for
10 years and it's 160 million, sure.

138
00:06:37.711 --> 00:06:39.294
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Netflix bought fast.com.

139
00:06:39.294 --> 00:06:41.530
I don't know how much we paid but
I'm sure it was a lot.

140
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.800
I mean cuz that's a great domain name.

141
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.329
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,
I use that all the time.

142
00:06:46.329 --> 00:06:48.425
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I use fast.com
as well just in case you,

143
00:06:51.913 --> 00:06:52.596
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah

144
00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:55.446
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Nice.

145
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.720
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Mark wasn't lying,
this is a good Internet connection.

146
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:07.845
Okay, so, so right now if I go
to jem.party, this is awesome.

147
00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:09.950
&gt;&gt; Group: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It's just

148
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.470
gonna be central link.

149
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.720
See this is ISPs injecting
their own things in there.

150
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Wasn't it jemrules.party,
or did you change it?

151
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.820
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I think
it was just jem.party.

152
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No, he got jem.party.

153
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:20.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Okay.
All right, yeah.

154
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:21.963
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah it should be-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: We're good.

155
00:07:21.963 --> 00:07:24.450
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But I think this is

156
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:28.200
the ISP injecting their own-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, so

157
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.920
what you do when you set up your laptop,
you set up your DMS to 0.20.

158
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.890
I forget, what's the service?

159
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:35.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Google?

160
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Google DNS?

161
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.222
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, Google's 8.8.8.8.

162
00:07:39.222 --> 00:07:40.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,
I just always remember that one.

163
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.180
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But because I think,
just because I just bought this.

164
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.920
This domain doesn't resolve to anything.

165
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.220
Because remember,
we talked about it takes awhile,

166
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.600
all these servers around
the world have to sync up.

167
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.072
So right now, jem.party is syncing
up to parking.namecheap.com.

168
00:07:55.072 --> 00:07:57.370
So, it could take a few minutes.

169
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.810
It could take longer,
that's why we're doing this stuff now.

170
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.010
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: He said give
it 48 hours usually, but

171
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.200
it's usually up in like ten minutes.

172
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.340
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, I've seen it
take anywhere from a few minutes up

173
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.870
to a day or two.

174
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:15.117
So right now, okay, so everybody here, you
don't necessarily have to use namecheap.

175
00:08:15.117 --> 00:08:19.256
But, whatever hosting
provider you're using for

176
00:08:19.256 --> 00:08:23.684
your domain,
you should have some sort of way to adjust

177
00:08:23.684 --> 00:08:28.657
the DNS Is everybody sorta,
everybody in the room with me?

178
00:08:28.657 --> 00:08:29.301
Domain
