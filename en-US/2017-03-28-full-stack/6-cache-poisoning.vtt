&gt;&gt; Jem: What's a potential
security hole with DNS?

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.420
We mentioned before that you can
take a bunch of sites offline

3
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.470
if you have only had one DNS provider.

4
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.500
What's something else that's
pretty dangerous that can happen?

5
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.470
I know it's in the slides, so.

6
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.140
But, just don't jump ahead.

7
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.550
What do you guys think?

8
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.920
Nobody?

9
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.060
So let's, lets say you copied my site
completely, you copied jemyoung.com.

10
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.120
Now this part where it says,
buy my book, I don't own a book.

11
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.900
But it says buy my book,
insert your credit information.

12
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.920
Let's say someone copied my site entirely,

13
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.670
how would they know
they're at the right site?

14
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.080
Well, you could use something
called DNS cache poisoning.

15
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.375
So, if I somehow poison all this cache
that we talked about earlier, to say that

16
00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:54.290
jemyoung.com isn't 23.23.185.61,
it's actually this other IP address.

17
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.570
And you go there and
it looks just like my site.

18
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.025
And your browser doesn't know because in
the browser it says jemyoung.com, right?

19
00:01:01.025 --> 00:01:04.040
So, DNS pass voice is a real thing.

20
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.290
One way to solve that is through HTTPS, so
that just says it's a handshake between

21
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.580
the browser and the server, and the DNS
provider says, I am where I say I am.

22
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.290
But in the early days of internet,
this was so malicious.

23
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.630
You can go to google.com and
you're typing in you're logged in and

24
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.380
you think your on google.com but
you're actually not.

25
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.580
You're on a completely different server
in China or something like that.

26
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.960
So this is a whole, this actually gets
brought up probably once a year, someones

27
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.940
DNS gets attacked and the cache gets reset
and pointing to the malicious websites,

28
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.620
which is why companies like Chrome and
Firefox are so insistent on HTTPS.

29
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.540
HTTPS, again, is just it's a handshake
that says you are where you say you are.

30
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.200
But this is something to be very wary of,
DNS cache poisoning, so.

31
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Sorry, Jem,
are you gonna actually talk about HTTPS?

32
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.370
&gt;&gt; Jem: If we have time
at the end of the day,

33
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.910
I would love to get
everybody set up on HTTPS.

34
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.860
But that's, it's a bit more involved,

35
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.630
there's still,
there are companies like less encryptors.

36
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.360
It's fantastic.

37
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.822
I use them for my own site, but
it's pretty advanced to get that set up,

38
00:02:12.822 --> 00:02:14.958
but I'll talk about it
a little bit later and

39
00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.120
hopefully we have time
at the end of the day.

40
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.536
We'll get everybody
a nice screen lock icon.

41
00:02:19.536 --> 00:02:20.140
Pretty fun.
