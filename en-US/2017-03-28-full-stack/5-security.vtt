00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.880
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Security Terry.

2
00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.950
So this is Security Terry.

3
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.140
Security Terry pops up when there's
something that we should know about cuz

4
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.570
we should always think about security.

5
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.680
I'll hit this point over and
over and over again today.

6
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.350
People are always trying to
break into your computer.

7
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.970
It's just a fact of life.

8
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.210
I guarantee right now that I
have a server up and running for

9
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.410
this class, someone is trying
to break into it right now.

10
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.490
It's probably an automated script or
just someone with too much free time.

11
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.105
So we always have to be
mindful of security,

12
00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:31.510
we always have to be mindful of security.

13
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.490
So-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Little anecdote about that.

14
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.230
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I threw up a WordPress

15
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.860
sandbox site, just to play with,
I threw like the first post up there.

16
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.704
Five minutes, someone hit it with spam.

17
00:00:42.704 --> 00:00:49.570
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: [LAUGH] It's
just a fact of life now.

18
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.120
You don't leave your front
door unlocked do you?

19
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.382
You don't leave your car unlocked.

20
00:00:52.382 --> 00:00:54.610
No, so we secure everything.

21
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.740
And I will always be dropping in
security hints the whole time because

22
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.190
honestly you can't DDoS one.

23
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.550
So DDoS is distributed denial of service.

24
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.140
Essentially it means you take over
a bunch of unsecured computers and

25
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.200
you just slam one site with a bunch of
traffic that they can't response to you.

26
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.700
That's a DDoS,
essentially takes it offline.

27
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.800
And the way that happens is
unsecured computers mainly, so

28
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.060
that's why people like to
break in on these computers.

29
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.680
They have this thing, some sort of
script that'll take over my computer

30
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.510
it'll mine BitCoin or
spam people or do whatever.

31
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.450
And unfortunately it's people's bad
security practices that are responsible

32
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.400
for DDoS attacks, because

33
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.930
let's face it a hacker's not gonna buy $7
million of Amazon servers to do something.

34
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.020
No, they're going to take over free
servers, computers like yours and mine.
