00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.188
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: At this point you should be,

2
00:00:02.188 --> 00:00:05.192
everything is hooked up
to your node server.

3
00:00:05.192 --> 00:00:08.775
But the problem is every time we wanna do
something on the command line, we have to

4
00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:12.400
CRL+C, do whatever we wanna do then
restart our node server, that's a pain.

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.060
So we can do a better way to do this.

6
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.908
We're gonna build an entire deploy
system that is a one-click deploy,

7
00:00:18.908 --> 00:00:22.175
or one click,
one-button press, as in enter.

8
00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:26.494
And [LAUGH] it automatically deploys and
restarts your node application for you,

9
00:00:26.494 --> 00:00:28.150
which is pretty cool.

10
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.720
But first, we're gonna start with Gulp.

11
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.995
So how do we build and
deploy our application?

12
00:00:32.995 --> 00:00:35.224
We've gone through all
this unfamiliar territory.

13
00:00:35.224 --> 00:00:38.733
And now we're in territory that we should
all be a little more familiar with.

14
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:42.870
We're in JavaScript land,
HTML, CSS, good times.

15
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.950
So what we're gonna use
is we're gonna use Gulp.

16
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.202
Gulp is a task runner,
it's more like a streaming task builder,

17
00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:52.635
but we can call it a task runner for now.

18
00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.363
There's also Grunts,
Broccoli, Brunch, Jake,

19
00:00:55.363 --> 00:00:58.471
I'm sure there's more that
are being invented everyday.

20
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:01.279
But we're gonna use Gulp because
Gulps just JavaScript and

21
00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:03.850
it's pretty straightforward to use.

22
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.670
We use it at Netflix pretty heavily.

23
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.121
I'm more of a MPM script type of person
over at Gulp, but to each their own.

24
00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:12.869
We're gonna do some MPM
scripting a little bit later,

25
00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.280
it's the last thing we're gonna do today.

26
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.440
But we're getting at the home stretch.

27
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.360
We've got everything hooked up.
