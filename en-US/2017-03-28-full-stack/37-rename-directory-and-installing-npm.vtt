00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.580
&gt;&gt; Jem: So, we clone the repo, but
DevOps Frontend's kind of a long name.

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.107
We want to rename that, and the way we
rename that is the move command, mv.

3
00:00:09.107 --> 00:00:11.952
I know, it's not,
this one doesn't make as much sense,

4
00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:13.939
to rename something it's called move.

5
00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:18.863
But we're just gonna move
Dev-Ops-for-Frontend/ into app.

6
00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.560
&gt;&gt; Jem: And again, tab complete will
save you from typing Dev-Ops in front,

7
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.524
you just type d and it'll auto
complete the whole thing for you.

8
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:39.015
&gt;&gt; Jem: So, gonna move
&gt;&gt; Jem: And

9
00:00:39.015 --> 00:00:42.163
I'm just gonna cd into my app directory.

10
00:00:42.163 --> 00:00:48.588
And we have a basics of a working
node server just about.

11
00:00:48.588 --> 00:00:51.508
And then just go ahead and
while we're in here, let's just npm i,

12
00:00:51.508 --> 00:00:52.825
because it'll take awhile.

13
00:00:52.825 --> 00:00:53.828
Just install the packages.

14
00:00:57.796 --> 00:01:01.150
&gt;&gt; Jem: And there ways of, you can do
it in Sublime, there might be a way.

15
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.582
But you could actually edit files live in
your IDE if you sync things correctly.

16
00:01:07.582 --> 00:01:11.774
I don't do that too often,
since Git has become much more popular.

17
00:01:11.774 --> 00:01:14.552
But back when I first started,
Git wasn't really a thing, so

18
00:01:14.552 --> 00:01:16.770
you had to add the files
directly on the server.

19
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.560
So, we just did that directly over
an SSH connection on my local machine.

20
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.950
But another story for another time.
