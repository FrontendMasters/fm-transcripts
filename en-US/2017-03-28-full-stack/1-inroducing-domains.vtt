00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.625
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: A domain, we all know what
a domain is cuz you got here somehow.

2
00:00:04.625 --> 00:00:06.623
Fredandmasters.com is a domain.

3
00:00:06.623 --> 00:00:10.917
A subdomain would be
tech.fredandmasters.com.

4
00:00:10.917 --> 00:00:11.463
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We have

5
00:00:11.463 --> 00:00:15.744
next.fredandmasters.com which
is our beta player.

6
00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:16.331
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Ooo, but

7
00:00:16.331 --> 00:00:18.440
it's beta, so probably crap.

8
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.180
I know Mark, he's late night coding.

9
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.470
No, but this is a domain,
so basic terminology.

10
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.220
I know, some people are just like,
this is so basic, but

11
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.670
we gotta start at the beginning,
this is a complete intro class.

12
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.670
A sub domain like,
blog.jemyoung.com or it could be,

13
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.340
I don't think I have
any other sub domains.

14
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.470
But yeah, this is just basic terminology.

15
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.221
So, this is my real
doormat in my apartment.

16
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:52.210
IP addresses, domains are just a high
level wrapper on an IP address.

17
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.860
But because we're humans we can't
remember most IP addresses.

18
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.365
There are certain core ones, 127.0.0.1
is always home on your local machine.

19
00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:08.626
192.168.0.1 is always your local network,
it could be 10.0.0.1.

20
00:01:08.626 --> 00:01:10.860
And if someone's like, man, he's so smart.

21
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.780
No, I've typed these things,
cuz my router goes down all the time, so

22
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.430
I know all these IP addresses.

23
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.270
But a domain is just a wrapper
on top of an IP address.

24
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.050
And how that gets resolved
is something called DNS.
