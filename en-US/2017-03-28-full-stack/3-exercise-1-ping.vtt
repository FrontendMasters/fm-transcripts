00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.280
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: First exercise.

2
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.550
Yes, we're here already.

3
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.390
Let's do a ping command.

4
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.670
Ping is super useful for
just telling you, is my website up?

5
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.840
Because if DNS goes out,
you're thinking, man,

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.040
my websites down cuz my
DNS isn't resolving.

7
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.610
Jemyoung.com isn't resolving to a server,
that doesn't mean your server's down.

8
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.720
It could be that DNS is down.

9
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.170
So Ping is a good way of telling you,
is my server still up and

10
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.730
running, without actually logging into it.

11
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.430
So, in your command line, go ahead and

12
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.670
fire up, just type ping google.com,
anything you want.

13
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.740
Some of these exercises, I'll be joining
in, but some of these are pretty

14
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.250
straightforward, so I'm not gonna
exit it out and break the flow.

15
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.660
But, just go ahead and ping,
ping wherever you want.

16
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.890
Ping Netflix, Google, Frontend Masters.

17
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.016
All right?

18
00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:52.510
You should get something like that.

19
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.070
Depending on where you are in the world,

20
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.079
the IP address is gonna
be a little different.

21
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.390
But, go and ping jemyoung.com and
see what happens.

22
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's timeout.

23
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.870
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Exactly yes because
I do not respond to pings.

24
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.680
I don't need to because why should I?

25
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.546
So [LAUGH] It's my server,
I could do what I want.

26
00:01:12.546 --> 00:01:15.091
All right, so
it's important to note that yes,

27
00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:17.647
you don't actually have
to respond to the ping.

28
00:01:17.647 --> 00:01:21.580
It's just a different protocol,
a port that's opened on your server.

29
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.600
But it's a good way of telling
you if your server's up.

30
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.690
I don't use it because honestly
I don' t care if my server's up.

31
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.470
[LAUGH] It sounds so mean to say but
it goes down sometimes and

32
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.350
I don't even know it for days.

33
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.080
But ping is an extremely useful command
and this is just the basic, basic level.

34
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.030
If you wanna impress your friends,
just open this full screen and like ping,

35
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.520
and let it run in the background and

36
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.220
they'll think you're a cool hacker and
all sorts of things.

37
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.840
I used to do that in school,
just back in high school.

38
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.808
They'd be like what are you doing.

39
00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:50.615
I'm like Internet stuff.

40
00:01:50.615 --> 00:01:51.115
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
