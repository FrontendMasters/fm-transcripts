00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.900
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: DNS, the best way to
think of it is just it's a phone book.

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.390
But you have caches everywhere
because say you go to google.com.

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.250
You don't want to keep
looking that up every time.

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.930
You don't have to resolve that to whatever
the IP address every single time.

5
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:14.770
So you have a local cache.

6
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.320
That's on your computer.

7
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.990
And then on your router somewhere,
you likely have another cache there

8
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.990
which says, okay, these are commonly used
IP addresses that you know and love.

9
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.621
So it speeds up that look up time.

10
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:30.390
Then your ISP has another cache.

11
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.920
And then that's essentially how DNS works.

12
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.550
It's just caches on caches
on caches on caches.

13
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.220
You always want to make
the shortest hop possible.

14
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.160
So popular sites, Netflix,

15
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.240
Google, Facebook, FrontendMasters,
they're probably on your local ISP cache.

16
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.380
So when your computer says,
hey I want to go look something up,

17
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.400
it doesn't have to go far.

18
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.200
It cuts down on latency.

19
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.760
Whereas if you ever noticed,
I don't know, go to a Russian site or

20
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.100
a Chinese site, the DNS resolution
probably takes a long time.

21
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.570
Because the server has to say,
is it on my local cache?

22
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.150
No.

23
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.270
Is it on my network cache?

24
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.950
No.
ISP?

25
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.180
No.
And it keeps going up, going up, going up.

26
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.260
And there's core backbones that have maps
to every single IP address in the world.

27
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.780
Billions and billions and
billions of addresses.

28
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.990
But by the time you get that high,
you're pretty far off.

29
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.170
You're in New York or San Francisco,
or some of the core hubs,

30
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.290
where everything is, so
we always capture everything.

31
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.120
And what's fun about DNS is that
they're always talking to each other.

32
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.980
They're constantly updating.

33
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.050
It's just this flow of data that
we never think about taking place.

34
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.370
But obviously, when you build a domain
today, all the DNS has to update.

35
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.770
So I wonder if you point your domains,

36
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.910
say, Ilovecats.xyz,
you point that to an IP address.

37
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.520
Around the world,
all these servers are suddenly updating.

38
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.770
And it's just so cool to think about.

39
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.510
These things are happening in real time,
and

40
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.570
we just don't think about all
this complexity that's happening.

41
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.353
So yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Quick question.

42
00:01:55.353 --> 00:01:56.053
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes.

43
00:01:56.053 --> 00:01:57.237
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They're wondering if we're

44
00:01:57.237 --> 00:01:59.175
gonna be covering the A record,
CNAME, MX, and

45
00:01:59.175 --> 00:02:01.010
other record types today.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Absolutely.

46
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.970
We're gonna cover A record and

47
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.230
CNAME, probably not gonna go into MX,
but, great question, Henry M.

48
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.250
Yes, we will cover that later.

49
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.900
Unfortunately, not unfortunately,
we're going in steps,

50
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.600
in that, you have to understand one
part before I hook up another part.

51
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.120
Because I don't want to just
tell you to do something and

52
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.210
you're just blinding trusting me.

53
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.040
I want you to understand it first.

54
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.880
And then we're going to
put it all together.

55
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.140
But, great question, Henry.

56
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.012
Is there any other record?

57
00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:32.331
Yes, dying DNS that was the thing they
attacked, so a week before the Internet

58
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:36.942
we all learned a little bit something
on how fragile everything is.

59
00:02:36.942 --> 00:02:39.895
But, you have your local
area network cache so

60
00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:43.240
there's probably one here ISP cache.

61
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.050
And there's a lot of caches
