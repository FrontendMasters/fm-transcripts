00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.760
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
first let's install Nginx.

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.680
So, now we are not root so
we have to sudo of all our installs.

3
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.590
So sudo apt-get install nginx.

4
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.770
This is on your server again,
not on your main machine, on your server.

5
00:00:17.388 --> 00:00:18.634
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So I'm going go ahead and
do that, on mine.

6
00:00:18.634 --> 00:00:22.719
So, sudo, whoops, clear.

7
00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.345
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Nginx.

8
00:00:35.926 --> 00:00:37.280
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And
I'll just hit Enter for yes.

9
00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:50.785
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: [LAUGH]
All

10
00:00:50.785 --> 00:00:55.228
right.

11
00:00:55.228 --> 00:00:58.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: That was pretty painless,

12
00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.440
hopefully that works.

13
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.220
Didn't work if you had some
sort of network error,

14
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.600
you can get install again and it'll run.

15
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.050
So next let's go ahead and start up nginx.

16
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.829
So say sudo service nginx start,
and we're started,

17
00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:23.340
that was it there's really no output,
nothing, no fireworks.

18
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.460
So now, let's see if jem.party's
resolving correctly.

19
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.914
Still not resolving.

20
00:01:29.914 --> 00:01:31.090
It's taking so long.

21
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.222
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: When I go to it it
says it was bought by Namecheap.

22
00:01:34.222 --> 00:01:37.907
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: [SOUND] [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The domain is registered

23
00:01:37.907 --> 00:01:40.550
at Namecheap, so
it looks like you have it.

24
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.210
I don't know why yours
says 400 Bad Request.

25
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.560
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: The default nginx
state should look something like-

26
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.125
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It works.

27
00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:49.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah,

28
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.920
I got the default nginx page.

29
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.640
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,
you should have something [CROSSTALK]

30
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: They changed that.

31
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.720
Let's try this.

32
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.320
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So this looks like
it's just not resolving correctly.

33
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Just try refreshing
it again cuz I got the right nginx

34
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.550
page when I went to it.

35
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.420
That's weird.

36
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.080
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I'm just gonna try
my IP just to make sure that.

37
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.960
See, yeah, so
it's just not resolving correctly.

38
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.550
I've just gotta give it more time.

39
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.190
And don't forget,
on Namecheap when you change the records,

40
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.950
make sure you hit Save.

41
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.740
Otherwise you didn't save anything,
you just typed stuff into a field.

42
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.440
So until this resolves, no big deal.

43
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.570
I'll just use my IP address for now.

44
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.490
So this is the page you should all see if
nginx installed and is running correctly.

45
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.099
Just give me kind of a thumbs if it works.

46
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.700
Excellence, excellent.

47
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.175
Now we are officially responding to
requests across the Internet on our sever.

48
00:02:42.175 --> 00:02:46.665
Drunkencoder.club, that's a good one.

49
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.324
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Okay, and again just in case
the DNS has not propagated correctly,

50
00:02:56.324 --> 00:03:00.503
just type your IP address and
you'll see the Nginx start page.
