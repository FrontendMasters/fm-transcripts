00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.710
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So now we're gonna log in.

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.210
We're gonna log in to your
very own personal server.

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.930
All right, this is confusing so
I'm gonna break it down for you.

4
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.209
ssh, we know what that does,
it's a way of logging in to a server.

5
00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:15.446
-i means identity,

6
00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:19.716
it's saying I wanna use this specific
private key to log in to the server.

7
00:00:22.287 --> 00:00:24.122
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: This first
part is your username so

8
00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:28.850
right now your root because we don't have
a user, so it's always gonna be root.

9
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.157
And then paste in your SERVER_IP
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So

10
00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:35.590
give everybody a minute to go ahead and
do that and

11
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.770
then I will demonstrate
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: how to do it?

12
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.650
So if you're already
in your SSH directory,

13
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:51.340
you don't have to do the ~/.ssh/my_key,
you can just say my_key, okay?

14
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.290
So I'm just gonna go ahead and
demonstrate this, clear ssh

15
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.230
and pwd stands for print working
directory just tells me where I am.

16
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.730
Pwd always gets me because I think
password every single time but

17
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.160
it's print working directory.

18
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.118
And just tells me I'm in ssh directory.

19
00:01:08.118 --> 00:01:15.157
So I'm just gonna say ssh-i my_key,
think it's 2.

20
00:01:15.157 --> 00:01:18.965
And we're not using the public key, we're
using the private key on this instance so

21
00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:20.070
we don't have a .pub.

22
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.174
And on roots at,
this is my server IP address but

23
00:01:23.174 --> 00:01:25.822
you're gonna have your own obviously.

24
00:01:28.061 --> 00:01:31.686
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And just say yes, what it's
gonna do is it makes a fingerprint of

25
00:01:31.686 --> 00:01:36.387
the server and if that server ever changes
the fingerprint changes it's gonna warn

26
00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:38.315
you every single time.

27
00:01:38.315 --> 00:01:38.875
Question?

28
00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:42.045
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They're just asking
with the -i does in that command.

29
00:01:42.045 --> 00:01:44.345
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, -i stands for identity,
it's just saying I want to use this key.

30
00:01:45.675 --> 00:01:50.794
Your particular private key
to log in to your server.

31
00:01:50.794 --> 00:01:53.831
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And then another question
was about when they're getting this

32
00:01:53.831 --> 00:01:56.810
authenticity of the fingerprint
message for the first time,

33
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.460
do you just want to explain that to them?

34
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.779
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, so let me see if I
can find that, let me exit out of here.

35
00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:09.790
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Ta-da, there we go.

36
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.039
So we can look at the known host file.

37
00:02:14.142 --> 00:02:17.968
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Known hosts is a file on
your computer kind of like a cache of

38
00:02:17.968 --> 00:02:24.200
places you've connected to with a specific
fingerprint to that specific server.

39
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.870
So just like DNS cache poisoning,

40
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.490
someone could also trick your IP and
you could hijack someone's computer.

41
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.840
And when you hijack,
say my server and I'm sh-ing in.

42
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.830
If that identity ever changes,
your computer will let you know.

43
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.134
Because now at this point,
we're sending through our private key and

44
00:02:42.134 --> 00:02:46.110
if someone steals your private key, then,
well, they can get into all your stuff,

45
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.078
especially if you're using your sh key.

46
00:02:48.078 --> 00:02:51.757
So that authentication screen where
it says this is your identity,

47
00:02:51.757 --> 00:02:53.816
do you wanna connect?

48
00:02:53.816 --> 00:02:55.630
If you're ever connected to
a server that you know and

49
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.090
love and that comes up, you should say no.

50
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.150
Because it shouldn't ever say that
unless the server has changed and

51
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.550
then your administrator will tell
you that the server has changed.

52
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.220
But that's a good tip, beware of that,
let me just highlight that one more time.

53
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.202
Yeah, so if you're connected to
a server over ssh and this comes up and

54
00:03:16.202 --> 00:03:19.048
you're not familiar with why it's there?

55
00:03:19.048 --> 00:03:21.894
As in you don't know why
the service changed, say no.

56
00:03:21.894 --> 00:03:25.730
Because again, we're sending our
private key, over the wire this time.

57
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.010
Okay?
So.

58
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Typing it yes adds
it to the known host file, right?

59
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.040
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's just kinda what.

60
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.398
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah.

61
00:03:32.398 --> 00:03:34.546
And it's a good security so
that way, again,

62
00:03:34.546 --> 00:03:36.585
if that server ever changes unexpectedly,

63
00:03:36.585 --> 00:03:39.853
your computer will let you know before
it sends over your private key.
