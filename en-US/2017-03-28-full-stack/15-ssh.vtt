WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.120
&gt;&gt; Jem: All right, so
now we're come to SSH.

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.880
I know I told you I wouldn't do that so
until you do something and

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.980
I'll explained it, but
SSH, I'll explain it now.

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.630
All right, so
SSH is Secure Socket Shell and

5
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.384
it's a way of connecting to remote devices
and there's two basic ways of doing that.

6
00:00:19.384 --> 00:00:23.720
there's username/password which we
just did, so student was the username,

7
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.916
password is I am a great engineer and
there's also ssh key.

8
00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:31.370
And we're gonna find out why ssh key
are preferential to login to a server.

9
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.370
But for now, you can start off
with just the username and

10
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.760
password, that's probably
the most basic way of getting in.

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.410
But it's not the most secure of doing
things and someone in the room tell me

12
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.390
what's wrong with logging in with
a password, without looking at the slides.

13
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.079
Sorry?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I was saying someone could

14
00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.572
just know your password.
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yeah,

15
00:00:52.572 --> 00:00:58.190
someone could break into it because humans
in general we're so bad at passwords.

16
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.203
So we make things easy to remember, and if
it's easy to remember it's probably short,

17
00:01:01.203 --> 00:01:04.060
if it's short someones gonna break in.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Especially in this case if

18
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.420
it's easy to type.
&gt;&gt; Jem: Exactly, Exactly so

19
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.770
these are some of the most commonly
use passwords in the world.

20
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.400
If I'm speaking to a room
of a thousand people,

21
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.450
at least 10 of these people
have one of these passwords.

22
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.390
I love password eight,
my favorite is the last one.

23
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.430
Cuz you know, servers like know,

24
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.130
we like to make users more secure
cuz we're bad at passwords.

25
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.990
So we're gonna make
the minimum length eight.

26
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.150
So they say okay, one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

27
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.320
It's, yeah,
it's a never ending quest of security.

28
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.230
And as security terrier reminds us,
we have to always be vigilant.

29
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.564
So, username/password is just a bad idea
because people are always trying to break

30
00:01:43.564 --> 00:01:44.366
into servers.

31
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:47.189
And the best is when you
make some arbitrary,

32
00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.501
it's gotta be an uppercase letter and
a symbol and two characters and

33
00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:55.630
your mother's maiden name and
your dog's birthday.

34
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.610
People just write it on a post-it note and
put it on their computer because,

35
00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.750
I can't remember this password.

36
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.890
Screw IT, screw security, humans,

37
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.200
we're bad at remembering things,
that's why we have a DNS system.

38
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.560
So we don't have to remember IP addresses.

39
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.110
So, we're not gonna use
user name password anymore.

40
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.720
It's just too insecure,
it's too easy to break into, and

41
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.620
people are always trying
to break into a server.

42
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.010
I know you probably can't use this, but

43
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.330
this is just a quick
snippet of my off-log.

44
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.100
From my own personal server,

45
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.565
like Jemyoung.com there's literally
nothing interesting on it.

46
00:02:27.565 --> 00:02:29.230
[LAUGH] Literally nothing.

47
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.550
But people are always
trying to break in and

48
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.770
this is the one day of people
attempting to break in to my server.

49
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.850
But I don't use a password on my server,
I use an SSH key, why?

50
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.440
Because people keep trying to guess.

51
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.920
So what are they using here?

52
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.087
They're using admin,
[SOUND] lot of admins, tests, admin.

53
00:02:48.087 --> 00:02:49.910
Yeah, people are always
trying to break in.

54
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.632
That's, I'm gonna hit this later over and
over and over again, but

55
00:02:53.632 --> 00:02:56.270
people want to steal your crap,
all the time.

56
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.140
It's just happening right now.

57
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.830
As we speak, someone is trying to break
into that server that we just logged into.

58
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.240
So, we're gonna use something
called Public Key Authentication,

59
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.410
instead of user name, password.

60
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.610
Because passwords are easily guessable
even if you have a 21 character password,

61
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.070
that's not that secure.

62
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.660
This laptop could guess
all the 21 password,

63
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.720
like all the iterations of 21 length
character password in seconds.

64
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.440
Just this laptop.

65
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.650
So we're not gonna use passwords,
we're gonna use an SSH key.

66
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.600
So, there's a question on how to check
each person has logged into my server?

67
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.550
We will go over looking
at the auth log later.

68
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.830
But, for now, you don't have a server,
so don't worry about it.

69
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.150
There's no one trying to break in yet.

70
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.540
They will, [LAUGH] so
public key authentication.

71
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.720
We're gonna make an SSH key here shortly.

72
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.600
What that means is you have a public key,
you have a private key.

73
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.690
The public key is the one
that you put onto the server.

74
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.930
What's the best analogy for it?

75
00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.630
It's like a two-way lock essentially,
public key in encrypts everything.

76
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.933
But the only way to decrypted
it is with your private key.

77
00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:08.471
The private key you never,
ever, ever give out.

78
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:10.970
But your public key, I can hand it out
like a business card, like here you go,

79
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.248
here you go, here you go, here you go.

80
00:04:12.248 --> 00:04:14.270
And that's the great thing about
public key authentication.

81
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.590
Is I could put it on Twitter,
I could put it anywhere and I

82
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.770
could say hey, I wanna give myself
the ability to log into your server.

83
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.420
Here's my public key.

84
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.425
And since I have the private key,
I'm the only one that can login,

85
00:04:30.425 --> 00:04:32.099
even though you have the public key.

86
00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.583
It's such a fantastic system.

87
00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:40.346
And so
we're gonna make an SSH key right now.

88
00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:44.420
The public key goes on your server,
your private key stays on your computer.

89
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.290
And we're gonna look at
the private key and see why,

90
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.800
I won't say unbreakable cuz everything's
breakable with enough time and money.

91
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.080
But it's as close to unbreakable as
we can get with current technology.
