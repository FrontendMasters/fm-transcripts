00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.660
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So, I'm Harem Jem,
because we will absolutely,

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.048
absolutely use it later.

3
00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:10.216
So go ahead and type this out,
I know it's pain, it's pedantic, but

4
00:00:10.216 --> 00:00:13.923
you learn things by doing them, and this
is coming from me, years of experience,

5
00:00:13.923 --> 00:00:17.440
trying to learn VIM, but
I'm always looking at the same commands.

6
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.292
So just go ahead and type this out in VIM,
I want everybody to get used to just

7
00:00:22.292 --> 00:00:26.159
typing in something that is
not user friendly whatsoever.

8
00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.642
It's really not.

9
00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:29.159
There are some questions.

10
00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.375
Craig asked, are we gonna go over how to
change some of the default settings in VIM

11
00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:34.820
like indent spacing, color scheme etc.?

12
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.921
No, we will not.

13
00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:41.961
You can look that up and customize as
you'd like but this class all you really

14
00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:47.670
need to know is how to write a file,
how to save a file, undo, redo, find.

15
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.933
Those are just the absolute basic
things we need to get stuff done.

16
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:55.820
But, again, this is a tool that you could
spend years learning and perfecting.

17
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.517
And I encourage you, if you say this
is fantastic, go ahead and do that.

18
00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:03.040
If you only wanna learn just the basics,
do that too, either way.

19
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.563
Whatever it takes to get stuff done,
so that's what I say.

20
00:01:07.563 --> 00:01:12.850
And someone asked when I right-quit, how
to access a file, and oop, thanks, Amir.

21
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.866
Yes, if you wanna open that file you've
just written in the command line is

22
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.565
the i.file and
it's gonna open it right back up.

23
00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:23.304
All right,
if you're trying to open your file again,

24
00:01:23.304 --> 00:01:26.080
we're just going to vi someotherfile.

25
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.206
And I'm gonna say Hello!

26
00:01:31.206 --> 00:01:35.040
And then escape, right quit.

27
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.766
And if I wanna look at all these files,
I can say ls.

28
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:41.830
But this is in my SH folder,
it's not really that relevant.

29
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.885
Actually, let me just make
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: CD, clear,

30
00:01:47.885 --> 00:01:53.035
so make a temp directory, oops,

31
00:02:02.212 --> 00:02:05.106
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So, somefile,

32
00:02:05.106 --> 00:02:09.651
search,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Hi.

33
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:11.627
Escape, right quit.

34
00:02:11.627 --> 00:02:14.223
LS will show you that you have some file.

35
00:02:14.223 --> 00:02:18.737
Again, because VIM doesn't
necessarily save in any sort of file

36
00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:23.099
format there is not .txt dot anything,
it's just some file.

37
00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.224
Just wanna open that back up.

38
00:02:24.224 --> 00:02:27.590
Just vi somefile and
we're back in that file.

39
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.018
Nothing to it.

40
00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:32.860
Is everybody caught up?

41
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.018
We are all good?

42
00:02:35.018 --> 00:02:37.270
We've solved all our issues?

43
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.245
Everybody can write and save a file?

44
00:02:39.245 --> 00:02:43.440
That's really all you need to know,
how to write and save and insert and find.

45
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.830
And undo, redo.

46
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.360
Okay, looks like we're all good.

47
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.773
Skip.

48
00:02:51.773 --> 00:02:55.921
Random useful tips in case
everybody didn't know,

49
00:02:55.921 --> 00:02:59.227
if you tab completion in most terminals.

50
00:02:59.227 --> 00:03:02.670
So if I type S, I hit tab,
it's gonna finish that file for me.

51
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.801
This is, it's so
useful on any command line.

52
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:09.900
I probably should have.

53
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.115
This is a top tip, it's not important but
it's extremely helpful.

54
00:03:13.115 --> 00:03:17.060
So if I wanna say, slash FC.

55
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.980
If I double tab,
it'll tell me everything in the folder.

56
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.807
Not relevant to the class, just It'll
help you later, it'll help you be faster.

57
00:03:24.807 --> 00:03:31.780
All right, so we are VIM pros,
or VIM comfortable at least.
