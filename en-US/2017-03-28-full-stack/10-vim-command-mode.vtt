00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.020
&gt;&gt; Jem: All right command mode,
let's go back into VIM.

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.580
So when I tap I, Haha, VIM is easy.

3
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.378
Yeah sorry, thank you.

4
00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:16.923
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jem: All right.

5
00:00:21.744 --> 00:00:22.750
&gt;&gt; Jem: Okay, thank you.

6
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.410
Thanks for reminding me.

7
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.170
So, Insert mode.

8
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.599
It says INSERT mode at
the bottom of the screen.

9
00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.860
Hit ESC, or in command mode.

10
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.530
So, let me just reference my slides.

11
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.190
So in command mode, you can do file
manipulations, things like that.

12
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.020
So if I hit U.

13
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.920
I can undo what I just typed,
that's a useful command.

14
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.645
And if I press CTRL+R, that's redo.

15
00:00:49.928 --> 00:00:53.608
&gt;&gt; Jem: Undo, redo, undo, redo.

16
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.464
&gt;&gt; Jem: So if you wanna delete a line,
dd is delete the line.

17
00:01:11.176 --> 00:01:17.586
&gt;&gt; Jem: So, escape, dd,
if I wanna undo that, just type U.

18
00:01:17.586 --> 00:01:19.922
The thing about command mode, it doesn't
tell you you're in command mode.

19
00:01:19.922 --> 00:01:23.144
You just have to look at
the bottom of the screen and

20
00:01:23.144 --> 00:01:25.309
see that I'm not in insert mode.

21
00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:26.408
Undo.

22
00:01:33.394 --> 00:01:36.186
&gt;&gt; Jem: And again,
vimgifs, fantastic site,

23
00:01:36.186 --> 00:01:39.150
will tell you exactly what you're doing.

24
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.290
So Harris asked,

25
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.770
if DNS a phone book, how will I be
using it to find relevant numbers?

26
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.950
Again, it's just a cache.

27
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.330
It's just a giant, giant phone book.

28
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.590
But I'm glad people are still
thinking about DNS and

29
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.880
everything cuz we're just
gonna keep building on layers.

30
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.890
So if you have any questions, just tell
me to slow down and I'll jump back.

31
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.730
Danielle said, I don't clear backspace.

32
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.170
You can absolutely clear a backspace.

33
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.890
That's when you're in Insert mode.

34
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.090
So Insert, hello, and you can backspace.

35
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.210
But once you get out of Insert mode.

36
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.122
Backspace [NOISE],
won't do anything anymore.

37
00:02:17.122 --> 00:02:19.240
Different modes, different commands.

38
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.310
Think of them as contextual commands for
different parts of the menu.

39
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.560
But since I'm in command mode, some do.
