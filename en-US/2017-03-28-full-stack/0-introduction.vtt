[MUSIC]

2
00:00:39.177 --> 00:00:41.664
&gt;&gt; Jem: Welcome, I am Jem Young,

3
00:00:41.664 --> 00:00:48.040
this class is about teaching
across the stack for everybody.

4
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.680
But it's from a perspective of a frontend
engineer, so, I, like you, build UIs.

5
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.780
So, everything I say is just only
the relevant data that you need.

6
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.640
There's not gonna be anything extraneous,
nothing you don't need,

7
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.540
but I just want you to be comfortable
working across the Stack.

8
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.010
And we'll get more into what this
class is, kind of an intro, but

9
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.080
if you have any questions,
just ping me or Mark.

10
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.860
Or if I'm going too fast, just tell me to
slow down, and I'll slow it down for you.

11
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.220
All right, let's get started,
yes, my name is Jem Young.

12
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.080
I'm a senior software engineer at Netflix,
I work on the acquisition team.

13
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.160
The short way of putting that is I
work on the front door to Netflix.

14
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.790
So I work on the website, so
I work on sign-up, registration.

15
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.450
Essentially, if you're not logged in to
website, that's what my team controls.

16
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.330
And we work on TV-Y, iOS, Android,
we work across all the platforms.

17
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.275
I work mainly on WebUI, but sometimes I
dabble in, other platforms like that.

18
00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:52.918
I love what I do, I, not only working at
Netflix, cuz I watch a lot of Netflix.

19
00:01:52.918 --> 00:01:56.896
But I love coding, it's something
I'm really passionate about,

20
00:01:56.896 --> 00:02:00.210
the only thing I'm not
passionate about is mornings.

21
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.350
I am not a morning person, so
if you see me over here just like

22
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.960
chugging his Coke cuz I'm trying
to wake up cuz it's still ,what,

23
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.570
7 AM my time,
which I don't wake up that early.

24
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.390
Let's talk a bit about
some serious business.

25
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.521
The slides, in case you lose them later or
you lost the link,

26
00:02:18.521 --> 00:02:22.258
that's jemyoung.com/fefs,
front end full sack.

27
00:02:22.258 --> 00:02:24.097
I guess I should've done
it the other way but

28
00:02:24.097 --> 00:02:28.060
I saw that I was like I'm not changing
my NGINX config I'm too lazy to do that.

29
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.010
If you're using Windows
it's not preferable, but

30
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.250
if you use GitHub for
Desktop that will install a GitHub shell

31
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.840
which has a nice Bash interface
which is pretty sweet.

32
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.231
Windows 10 has Bash built
into it on some level,

33
00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:45.071
I think it's an optional tool probably.

34
00:02:45.071 --> 00:02:46.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I know I have get Bash,
so I'm not really sure.

35
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.760
&gt;&gt; Jem: Perfect, yeah but it's generally
preferred to use some sort of a Unix

36
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.210
based system but if not Windows will work.

37
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.126
We're not gonna do that much deep dive
on your own personal computer and

38
00:02:59.126 --> 00:03:01.890
all right.

39
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.710
No questions yet, so that's good, so

40
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.320
I want everybody to understand by the end
of this, how does the Internet work?

41
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.740
This is my most favorite interview
question that I ask people sometimes.

42
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.733
I'm not giving you any inside hints,

43
00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:20.940
cuz if you're from Netflix I probably
won't ask you that, but I might.

44
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.780
But it's my favorite question because
it doesn't matter which part of

45
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.940
the stack you're familiar with.

46
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.710
You can answer at least some portion,
this class is about giving you the broad

47
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.200
overview to answer the entire question,
how does the Internet work?

48
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.510
From end to end, but the best part about
this is if you're a backend engineer you

49
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.380
know a lot about the backend.

50
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.600
So you're gonna talk to me about
threading and how the processes work.

51
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.530
If you're a frontend engineer,
you're gonna talk to me about HTTP and

52
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.400
how the TCP packets work in DNS lookups.

53
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.150
If you're a network engineer,
you know way, way more than I do.

54
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.340
And you're gonna talk to me about
all the layers that are involved.

55
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.020
But everybody should know
how the internet works.

56
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.810
We're engineers, we're web engineers,
we build things for the web.

57
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.220
So we should all know how
the internet works, and

58
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.780
by the end of this class,
I guarantee you will know how it works.

59
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.400
Maybe not in an extreme detail, but you'll
be enough to ace any interview question.

60
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.251
So when I say how does the Internet work,

61
00:04:13.251 --> 00:04:15.800
I don't mean this boring
stuff in layer stack.

62
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.620
Anybody who has a CS degree, or
just has too much free time,

63
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.990
has probably seen something like this.

64
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.530
It's called a seven layer model,
and it's so boring.

65
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.188
I learned it in school, and

66
00:04:25.188 --> 00:04:30.170
it's this kind of a dry representation of
how networks worked, and it's [SOUND].

67
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.426
You can look at it if you want,
but I don't recommend it,

68
00:04:32.426 --> 00:04:34.210
don't worry about this.

69
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.490
If you wanna say, very technical,
you're, well, actually,

70
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.800
type of person,
this is how the Internet works.

71
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.890
But, we're not gonna do that, cuz I'm
a front engineer, just like you, so

72
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.890
I wanna tell you how it
works from my perspective.

73
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.420
So, things we're gonna learn today, we're
gonna level up your command line skills.

74
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.190
This class is almost
entirely command lines,

75
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.176
so, if you're just groaning
inwardly right now, I'm sorry.

76
00:04:59.176 --> 00:05:03.280
[LAUGH] It's, command line is not sexy,
you don't build

77
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.240
cool things that you can impress your
friends and show your grandma or whatever.

78
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.230
But this is like the low level

79
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.100
how things get done on the Internet,
or how things get done anywhere.

80
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.890
It's all command line, just like in the
1980s, 2016, command line doesn't change.

81
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.910
We're gonna learn how the Internet works,
the entire thing.

82
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.460
So when you're done,
if you have some great idea, so

83
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.292
if you wanna build I don't know,
Netflix for cats.

84
00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:33.820
You could build that, you can build
anything you want or Netflix for dogs,

85
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.360
I love both of them.

86
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.640
All right,
you can build anything you want.

87
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.901
Every business ever gets started with
an idea and some sort of server, and

88
00:05:41.901 --> 00:05:45.748
by the time you're done you will
have that ability to just go out and

89
00:05:45.748 --> 00:05:47.277
build whatever you want.

90
00:05:47.277 --> 00:05:49.875
And that's what I want,
I want everybody just feel so

91
00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:53.620
powerful just like I have this crazy idea,
and I'm gonna build it.

92
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.920
And you're gonna learn
the tools to do that today.

93
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.914
We're gonna learn how to create and
manage web server.

94
00:05:57.914 --> 00:06:01.750
So I'm gonna tell you some best practices,
not all best practices because server

95
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:07.660
management is a life-long pursuit of just
excellence and it's so hard to get right.

96
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.690
As we see really, really smart
people getting hacked all the time,

97
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.190
because it's hard to
get these things right.

98
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.410
So I'm gonna tell you just
the high level best practices

99
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.780
on how to kinda not shoot yourself in
the foot, cuz it's really, really easy.

100
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.240
We're gonna create a deploy system for
a Node app.

101
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.790
So because it's front end masters,
we're gonna use Node.

102
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.490
But everything we're gonna learn today
you can use Java, you can use C#,

103
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.090
you can use any sort of back end you want,
Python.

104
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.190
We're using Node cuz well we
all know a bit of JavaScript.

105
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.470
But everything we're gonna
learn is totally hot swappable,

106
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.240
we're gonna learn NGINX, but
you can use Apache if you want.

107
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.450
We're gonna use Node but again you can
use Python or Java or anything you want.

108
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.340
These all just are different parts
that just plug together, by the end,

109
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.060
we're gonna build a really basic web page.

110
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.980
We're not gonna go too in depth on that,
there are better classes that give you

111
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.130
a really,
really deep dive into build a web page.

112
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.990
But by the end, you'll have a server.

113
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.820
You'll have a server that points to
a domain that you could show your friends

114
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.120
and it all works.

115
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.690
So let us get started,
well, getting started.

116
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.970
So this part we're gonna cover domains,
a bit of DNS, command line basics, VIM,

117
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.650
and then for the end of part one,
we're gonna log into a server.

118
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.900
And logging in is kind of the most
crucial part cuz you need a server,

119
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.970
we need to get in there somehow.
