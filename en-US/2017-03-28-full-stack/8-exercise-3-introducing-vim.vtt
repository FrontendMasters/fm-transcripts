00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.520
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: We all learned trace route,
we all know ping now.

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.700
Let's move on to something a bit more fun.

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.302
And not cash cats, I love cash cats.

4
00:00:10.302 --> 00:00:15.303
VIM, yes, this is what you
see people in movies typing

5
00:00:15.303 --> 00:00:20.740
in cuz you look so cool,
and it's just a lot of fun.

6
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.772
VIM is VI Improved, I know, it's like php,
one of those self referencing definitions.

7
00:00:26.772 --> 00:00:30.910
But vim.org says it best,
VIM is an editor.

8
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.500
It's not gonna hold your hand,
it's a tool, and it has to be learned.

9
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.280
The reason why we're learning VIM is
because, actually, I asked that question.

10
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.340
VIM's the ubiquitous text editor,
but why should you care?

11
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.570
Because servers don't have GUIs.

12
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.495
You can't use sublime text or VS code or
any of your tools that you have, any IDE.

13
00:00:49.495 --> 00:00:50.786
You can't use it on the server.

14
00:00:50.786 --> 00:00:54.290
The server's gonna have Emacs or VIM,
and it's almost guaranteed to have VIM.

15
00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.241
So if we're gonna edit any files
on a server, we're gonna use VIM.

16
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:02.150
That's why we're gonna learn VIM today.

17
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.550
But best part about VIM,
if you're a VIM pro,

18
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.730
which takes a long time, you're much
faster than anybody else on the IDE.

19
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.680
You're just flying through your keyboard,
cuz you don't use your mouse anymore,

20
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.480
it's all keyboard commands.

21
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.310
And someone that's good at VIM, I was at
React Rally, and was it Michael Jackson?

22
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.670
No, it was Ron Florence.

23
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.130
And he was live coding a React component,
and he was using VIM.

24
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.250
And he was just flying through,
way faster than I could do it, because

25
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.480
if you're good at VIM, you are just
a speed demon, and you're so productive.

26
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.324
I like VIM, I don't use it in my every
day, because, well, I like Sublime Text,

27
00:01:39.324 --> 00:01:43.694
I like all my plugins, but VIM is just
an awesome, awesome tool to learn.

28
00:01:43.694 --> 00:01:48.050
It's one of those things that if you learn
it early, it keeps giving back to you.

29
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.060
Question?

30
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.372
Sorry.
[LAUGH]

31
00:01:53.152 --> 00:01:53.890
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: There's a question.

32
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.189
What does DNS mean to your site for you.

33
00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.804
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I asked them to maybe
clarify that but then I wasn't quite sure.

34
00:02:01.804 --> 00:02:02.742
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah.

35
00:02:05.774 --> 00:02:09.250
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But all right, so when
we clarify, we'll answer that question.

36
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.220
But let's get on to VIM because I think of
everything that you're gonna learn today,

37
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.400
VIM is one of the most useful tools
you could have in your toolbox.

38
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.594
So let's go ahead and open up our
command line, and just type in vi.

39
00:02:29.088 --> 00:02:31.812
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And
you should see something like this.

40
00:02:31.812 --> 00:02:36.493
Yes, so
you are in the beginnings of great ideas.

41
00:02:36.493 --> 00:02:39.320
The journey of a million miles
begins with a single step.

42
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.220
Opening a simple vi,
you can build the world with vi.

43
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.164
So I'm just gonna go ahead and
jump into mine, whoops.

44
00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:57.010
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Same, and
I can go to insert mode, hello.

45
00:02:59.234 --> 00:03:01.280
All right, just make sure my VIM is up and
running as well.
