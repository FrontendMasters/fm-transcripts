00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.180
&gt;&gt; Jem: Step one is to get the IP address
of the VPS that you just bought, so

2
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.130
the VPS of course is your server and
you have an IP address.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.490
If you don't know what the IP address is,
it's the thing you SSHed into, so

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.150
it was SSH your username@IP address.

5
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.185
And we're gonna add two
A records to our IP address and

6
00:00:17.185 --> 00:00:20.369
I'll explain what A records are and
C names in a second.

7
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.880
So my VPS, the IP address was this.

8
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.500
So I am just going to copy and paste that.

9
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.880
And then, I'm gonna go here under Type,
I'm gonna put A Record.

10
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.469
Put 1 for host, leave it at www.

11
00:00:48.726 --> 00:00:51.078
&gt;&gt; Jem: And the other A record,

12
00:00:51.078 --> 00:00:56.610
the @ symbol.
&gt;&gt; Jem: I think I'm doing that correctly.

13
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.420
Let me double-check my own slides.

14
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:07.403
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Jem: So these are the records for

15
00:01:07.403 --> 00:01:12.568
jemyoung.com.
&gt;&gt; Jem: But

16
00:01:12.568 --> 00:01:18.406
for Jem, Jem the party it is,
looks something like this.

17
00:01:18.406 --> 00:01:20.943
The, see if I can make
this a little bigger,

18
00:01:20.943 --> 00:01:25.927
there we go.
&gt;&gt; Jem: Okay and

19
00:01:25.927 --> 00:01:31.620
the TTL looks good,
I am gonna hit save all changes.

20
00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:41.269
&gt;&gt; Jem: Nice.

21
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.400
I like GameCube,
they have a very nice UI here.

22
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.890
So the host is just means that when I

23
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.692
got to dubdubdub.gem.party,
it's going to resolve to this IP address.

24
00:01:54.692 --> 00:01:58.790
But putting the @ means
I don't need the www,

25
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.590
I can just go jem.party and it'll
still resolve to the same IP address.

26
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.630
That's what the two A records mean.
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yes?

27
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So what if like when I

28
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.096
got my DNS server,
it already has IP addresses?

29
00:02:14.096 --> 00:02:18.430
Like it pre-populated them, other ones.

30
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:26.130
So I guess, I don't know why it has two or
three IP addresses.

31
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.390
It gave me two at IP addresses and
I just cut and pasted my one for

32
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.170
my server.
&gt;&gt; Jem: Clear those out,

33
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.090
just use the one for your server.

34
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.320
I guess it automatically parks
some domains there for you.

35
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So did you just edit?

36
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.470
Cuz when it first showed up it has a CNAME
Record and then a URL Redirect Record,

37
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.290
did you just change those to be A Records?
&gt;&gt; Jem: Correct.

38
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, cool.

39
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.220
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yeah, just in the drop down here?

40
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, I just wanted to make

41
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.620
sure I was on the right page.

42
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.990
And then we just use the IP from

43
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.809
our server?
&gt;&gt; Jem: Exactly.

44
00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:57.309
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: All right.

45
00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:01.373
Cool. &gt;&gt; Jem: Well it [INAUDIBLE] Cool,

46
00:03:01.373 --> 00:03:05.090
good question though.

47
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.110
Okay, thumbs up everybody.

48
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.780
Good.

49
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.624
There's a question, Mangum M.

50
00:03:10.624 --> 00:03:14.180
It says wait to delete the URL,
redirect record and CNAME record?

51
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.150
I did.

52
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.840
We're only gonna use A Records
in this particular instance,

53
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.450
we don't need the CNAME.

54
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.040
And I'll explain what those are as
soon as we're all same page.

55
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.177
Cool?
So I'm just gonna try it now see if

56
00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.935
&gt;&gt; Jem: Cool and that's good.

57
00:03:34.935 --> 00:03:37.479
That means at least it is resolving
something and Centurylink or

58
00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:40.385
whoever the ISP is not
intercepting that request anymore.

59
00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:48.900
All right
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does

60
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.740
it take a little while for
those to go through once you change it?

61
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.667
&gt;&gt; Jem: It does, it does.

62
00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:56.140
It can take a few minutes or a day.

63
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.520
So if it doesn't immediately resolve
today, it's not the end of the world.

64
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.690
It would be hopefully by the end of class,

65
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.210
you'll be able to type your domain and
it'll hit your server.

66
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.290
But if not we can just use our IP address,
it's not catastrophic.
