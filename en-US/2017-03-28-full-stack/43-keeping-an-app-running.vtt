00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.390
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
how do we keep our app up and running?

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.390
Currently we have to run note app every
time and kill it then make a change,

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.100
run GULP, make a change, and
then do that over and over.

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.700
We don't wanna do that.

5
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.440
There's better ways to do that.

6
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.410
We're engineers.

7
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.920
A good tenant of a good
engineers is they're lazy.

8
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.910
They do not wanna repeat
themselves over and

9
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.830
over again that's what we have scripts.

10
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.690
That's true ask any engineers you've
been around awhile they're very,

11
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.910
very lazy, as they should be.

12
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.580
So we're gonna use Forever.

13
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.600
Forever is a process manager and
it's gonna keep our app up and

14
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.720
running indefinitely until we kill it.

15
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.780
Or there's some sort of error that causes
it to error out where it can't restart but

16
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.810
it'll keep it up, so
that way we run forever, and

17
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.190
it's just gonna run to the background and
we don't have to worry about it anymore.

18
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.980
It's just always gonna be running.

19
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.710
There's also Strong Loop Process Manager,
or PM2.

20
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.650
PM2's pretty popular.

21
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.830
I like Forever because
it's just JavaScripts,

22
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.170
and by default I generally use
the JavaScript packages more.

23
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.750
But, PM2's also great.

24
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.880
Strong Loop's pretty solid too.

25
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.650
So, let's run Forever.

26
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.200
Let's make sure we're
in our app directory.

27
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.449
Then, "npm i -g forever"

28
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.103
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And I will go ahead and

29
00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:10.616
do it as well.

30
00:01:33.115 --> 00:01:34.599
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And
those optional dependencies are fine,

31
00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:35.570
it won't affect anything.

32
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.470
So now, if I say forever start app.js.

33
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.150
Instead of saying node.js, we can start
app, because it defaults to a node system.

34
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.242
Hit Enter and
now our app's up and running.

35
00:01:52.794 --> 00:01:55.408
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But we can keep using
the command line as we will and

36
00:01:55.408 --> 00:01:58.030
let's just double check
that the app is working.

37
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.340
So go to gem.party and
it's still up and running.

38
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.950
Yes I didn't add to my HTML cuz
I am a lazy, lazy person, but

39
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.640
I can do HTML, trust me.

40
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.480
So our app is up and running.

41
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.960
And it's up and
running in the background now.

42
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.560
It's gonna stay up and
running until we stop it.

43
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.820
So to stop a Forever script,
we're just gonna say forever stopall.

44
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.080
And that's gonna stop our node process.

45
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.490
Refresh, it's a bad gateway
cuz node is no longer running.

46
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.590
That's the great thing about Forever,
once you get it up and

47
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.520
running, it just runs forever, and
you don't have to worry about it.
