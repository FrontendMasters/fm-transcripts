00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.250
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: An A record, and
this is straight from dnsimple.com,

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.140
they're pretty decent people,
and this is a good write-up,

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.890
I have a link in the slides, but an A
record maps a domain to an IP address.

4
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.310
That's it, nothing fancy, it's probably
the most basic type of DNS record,

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.050
and there's also a CNAME record,
which maps a name to another name.

6
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.670
So, we only care about a records in this
instance, cuz we're pointing a domain to

7
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.890
an IP address, but if we go to,
actually, skip this one for now.

8
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.826
So if you go to keycode.info.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I'll just

9
00:00:38.826 --> 00:00:44.126
do that now.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: This is a great guy Wes Bos,

10
00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:47.122
he made a quick web page for
Java Script key code, so

11
00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:52.019
if you ever work on a project, and like
what's the key code for space, type space.

12
00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.866
Really cool projects, really nice guy,
but it's a domain, but you think this is

13
00:00:56.866 --> 00:01:01.150
pointing to a server, but this is
actually pointing to a GitHub server,

14
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.068
cuz GitHub will let you host things for
free, which is really really awesome, so,

15
00:01:06.068 --> 00:01:08.805
if we go back,
if we look into the actual repo on

16
00:01:08.805 --> 00:01:14.193
GitHub.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: We see that,

17
00:01:14.193 --> 00:01:18.854
if you want to make a GitHub page,
you make a branch called gh-pages, and you

18
00:01:18.854 --> 00:01:23.874
automatically have a hosted site, and if
you add a CNAME record, with a domain that

19
00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:29.290
you own, that's all it takes to point,
this is now pointed to your GitHub page.

20
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.541
So, if you don't want to pay for hosting,
if you don't wanna pay for a server,

21
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:37.539
you can use it through GitHub,
the load time's kinda high it's not very,

22
00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.032
it's pretty reliable, but
If you're cheaper, or student, or

23
00:01:41.032 --> 00:01:45.345
you just don't wanna spend the money, this
a really cheap way to give a domain and

24
00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:48.174
point it to a GitHub page,
really, really useful.

25
00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:51.400
And that's just a bonus tip,
it's not crystaly classified.
