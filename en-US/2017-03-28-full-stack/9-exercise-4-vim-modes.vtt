00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt; Jem: So now we're on VI,
it's kind of boring.

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.230
If you're trying to click or hit enter,

3
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.550
it's probably not doing anything
because that's not the way VI works.

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.690
And that's what makes it
tricky in the beginning.

5
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.760
But once you kind of wrap your
hand around how it works,

6
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.420
it's pretty fast to move around.

7
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.020
So VIM has three modes.

8
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.460
You've got command mode,
insert mode, and last-line mode.

9
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.600
Some people say it only has
two modes command and insert.

10
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.360
I like to say last-line because
you have to write, save,

11
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.690
do all sorts of file things.

12
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.290
So three main modes.

13
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.540
And this is, I know it's confusing but
I guarantee by the end of

14
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.750
the class once you come back to this
you're like, this makes perfect sense.

15
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.650
So command mode is where you start.

16
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.600
That's where you're at right now.

17
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.612
If you type anything with VIM,
you saw the blank screen,

18
00:00:47.324 --> 00:00:50.150
&gt;&gt; Jem: Let's see.

19
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.530
So if I'd Escape,
there's nothing on the screen.

20
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.030
At the bottom you see,
it's telling me nothing.

21
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.620
I'm in command mode.

22
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.810
So when I hit I, I'm in insert mode.

23
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.730
And insert mode I can type,
I hit Escape, I'm back in command mode.

24
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.050
All right, everybody follow?

25
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.090
That's why I went Mac with their
new laptops, remove the Escape key,

26
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.151
it was bizarre to me because you
can't use VIM without the Escape key.

27
00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:17.520
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense,
I don't know why they did that.

28
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.180
Sorry, personal rant.

29
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.390
So insert mode I.

30
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.150
We can type.

31
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.160
To get out of insert mode, Escape.

32
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.830
That's it.

33
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.450
Go ahead and try that now just so
you're kind of familiar.

34
00:01:29.394 --> 00:01:32.060
All right, so
everybody was able to type something.

35
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.850
So let's go and type Haha VIM is easy.

36
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.570
I know it's silly, but
you learn best by repetition.

37
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.270
That's just the fact of the matter.

38
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.100
And probably you'll forget half these
commands by the end of the day.

39
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.241
It happens.
You have to use VIM over and over and

40
00:01:46.241 --> 00:01:48.310
over and over again to like muscle memory.

41
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.840
A great site if you're
interested is vimgifs.com.

42
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.120
And it tells you all the commands and
kind of what should be happening.

43
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.017
So I, of course, is insert mode,
that's how we type things into VIM.

44
00:02:11.225 --> 00:02:13.040
&gt;&gt; Jem: All right, any questions so far?

45
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.240
Cuz we're gonna dive a little
bit deeper into VIM.

46
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.660
I wanna make sure everybody's comfortable.

47
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.910
It's weird the first time cuz if you've
only used a GUI based text editor

48
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.170
this is bizarre, why do I have to type I
to hit Escape and keep going in a circle,

49
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.630
it doesn't make any sense.

50
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.939
But over time it will,
it'll become second nature.

51
00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:50.330
&gt;&gt; Jem: Just to go into VIM,
that's all it takes.

52
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.152
So I'm in a chatroom
just watching questions.

53
00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:55.718
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You can repeat
the question out loud [INAUDIBLE].

54
00:02:55.718 --> 00:03:00.580
&gt;&gt; Jem: Okay, the question was
I'm not able to open VIM on Mac,

55
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.530
so on a Unix-based
system we'll type in VI.

56
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.680
In Windows, you need to be in the Bash
shell, or some sort of Bash interface.

57
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.504
Windows does not have VI
built into PowerShell.

58
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.428
&gt;&gt; Jem: Good question,

59
00:03:19.428 --> 00:03:23.950
is there any reason why you'd use VIM over
Nano if you're just editing text files?

60
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.453
Personal preference,

61
00:03:25.453 --> 00:03:30.119
I'm sure we have all heard of that
great nerdy debate of VIM versus Emacs.

62
00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:34.190
This is a longstanding debate
just like tabs or spaces.

63
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.660
Or two spaces or four spaces or yeah.

64
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.200
No preference.

65
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.360
I prefer VIM because VIM is baked into
almost every single Unix distribution,

66
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.460
so if you're on any sort of Unix server,
there's gonna be VIM in there.

67
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.730
Nano is on most of them as well.

68
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.220
It's a different kind of text editor.

69
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.700
But again, it's all kind of
non GUI based text editor.

70
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.370
There's also Emacs which
is very powerful as well.

71
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.660
Just as powerful as VIM but

72
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.150
Emacs is generally not installed
on a lot of distributions as well.

73
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.007
But totally personal preference, but

74
00:04:07.007 --> 00:04:10.277
that's why we're learning VIM
today because it's on most server.

75
00:04:10.277 --> 00:04:15.036
But again, If you wanna get good on server
stuff and you wanna use Nano instead of

76
00:04:15.036 --> 00:04:18.820
VIM, totally your call,
I'm not biased towards any of them.

77
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.650
Cool, yes James, great answer.

78
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.880
He said VIM is more widely available,
and that's absolutely true.
