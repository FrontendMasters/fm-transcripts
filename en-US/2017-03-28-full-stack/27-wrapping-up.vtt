00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.440
&gt;&gt; Jem: We have taken this long journey
and gone through 80 slides, 90 slides.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.810
We've gotten to this point now.

3
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.230
So now that I have a domain,
it is now pointed to an IP address.

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.200
But the bonus part is,
we understand how it works.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.320
We understand how DNS works.

6
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.570
We understand that we
have a server running.

7
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.970
We understand how domains work.

8
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.300
And I know, it was a long step to get
from here to there, but we're here.

9
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.550
And now, we're gonna start speeding up
a little bit, getting a bit more exciting.

10
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.620
We're gonna make our server do things,
make it respond to commands.

11
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.440
So let's set up our server.

12
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.800
We did some minor setup before
just to get some basic work done.

13
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.656
Let's see,
I just wondered if there was no questions.

14
00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:46.500
Someone says, what happens if
someone else points to my domain?

15
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.240
As the domain owner,
you are the authorized person.

16
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.020
So, in this case,
name sheep is the DNS server.

17
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.420
And they say I'm the only one
that has the ability to point

18
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.620
any records to this IP address for
just this domain.

19
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.140
So, as domain owner,

20
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.920
no one else can take over my domain and
point it to something else.

21
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.900
Is everybody clear on that?

22
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:19.040
So anybody else can make their own server
and points their server to my domain.

23
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.360
But my domain is only gonna resolve to
one IP address, the one that I choose,

24
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.089
cuz I own it.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Domains point out to the IP

25
00:01:25.089 --> 00:01:26.869
addresses.
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yes.

26
00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:27.382
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And it's not the other

27
00:01:27.382 --> 00:01:29.920
way around.
&gt;&gt; Jem: Right, question?

28
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a question about

29
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.970
having two A records.

30
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.444
Wouldn't that mean that there's two
addresses pointing to the same IP?

31
00:01:37.444 --> 00:01:38.190
&gt;&gt; Jem: Correct,

32
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:41.830
&gt;&gt; Jem: I'll explain it again.

33
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.160
So the first A record,

34
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.666
the www means when I go to www.jam.party
it's gonna resolve this domain.

35
00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:51.780
The @ host means,
if I just go to jam.party

36
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.970
it's gonna resolve to this IP address,
so they'll both work.

37
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.418
And let's see if I can
pull up the one for,

38
00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:02.550
where is jemyoung.com,
cuz I know I have subdomains on this one.

39
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.290
And, in this case, for
my subdomain blog.jemyoung.com,

40
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.790
I'm just using a CNAME record for that.

41
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.082
Because I don't need an A record because I
already have A records on that domain and

42
00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:23.336
since it's a subdomain I just use a CNAME.

43
00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:29.260
CNAME is quicker, easier, and it's just
the names entry, everybody understand?

44
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.786
So this why,
if you go to blog.jemyoung.com,

45
00:02:31.786 --> 00:02:35.420
that resolves correctly.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So what's the difference

46
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.170
between a CNAME and an A record?
&gt;&gt; Jem: They're just different

47
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.818
types of records.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: An A record points to

48
00:02:40.818 --> 00:02:41.806
the IP Address.

49
00:02:41.806 --> 00:02:44.359
The CNAME points to another domain name.
&gt;&gt; Jem: Exactly.

50
00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:45.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay, all right.

51
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.770
&gt;&gt; Jem: So this will, we're getting,

52
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.000
this is a bit more advanced.

53
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.400
But, so my CNAME point.blog.jemyoung.com
will now point to jemyoung.com.

54
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.554
In NGINX, I see that the request is
coming in for blog.jemyoung.com.

55
00:03:00.554 --> 00:03:03.520
And it's automatically gonna
direct to the appropriate routes.

56
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.330
And that's all done in NGINX,
but good question.
