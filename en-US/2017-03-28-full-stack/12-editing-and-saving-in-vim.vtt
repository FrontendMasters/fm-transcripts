00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.290
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So let's go to editing and
saving a file in VIM.

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.790
So we're going to move
into last-line mode.

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.530
So, in VIM, so
whatever you have in your file,

4
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.605
it doesn't matter if you type
some gibberish or anything,

5
00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:22.074
press esc, :, so its going to do, its
going to be shift-colon on most keyboards.

6
00:00:22.074 --> 00:00:25.268
Type q, what happens?

7
00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:29.890
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Hello.

8
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You get an error.

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.430
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Exactly.

10
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.820
Got an error.

11
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.490
It's cuz VIM says,
you can't just quit without saving.

12
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.490
Its trying to save you from yourself so
you don't actually quit.

13
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.270
Its really nice, but if we wanna say no,
I know what I'm doing.

14
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.590
I'm way smarter than you VIM,
we can say in last-line mode :q!.

15
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.636
The!, means yes I'm serious, essentially.

16
00:00:50.636 --> 00:00:53.250
[LAUGH] :q!, plugs you right out of there.

17
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.070
So we go back into VI.

18
00:01:01.886 --> 00:01:05.170
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But
let's say we wanna save this file.

19
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.800
So w is save.

20
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.900
We didn't give it a file name.

21
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.910
So w, I don't know, testfoo.

22
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.330
Save it as testfoo.

23
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.530
So I'll do that again.

24
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.495
So w, some file name testfoo,
that will write and

25
00:01:24.495 --> 00:01:29.000
save your file, but you're not gonna quit.

26
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.939
So, generally, this is like
the muscle-memory I've built in.

27
00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.575
It's always wq.

28
00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:35.980
So, that's write and then quit.

29
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.700
Shortcuts to having to type your
filename in every time is just vi

30
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.630
somefilename and
that's gonna open VI already saved.

31
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.996
So now in inserts, hello, escape,
I can just write quit and

32
00:01:53.996 --> 00:02:01.060
I don't have to do that weird file name
savings, cuz it already has a file name.

33
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.700
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Couple questions.

34
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.770
Why is VIM faster than other editors?

35
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.178
Is it just because we don't
have to use the mouse trackpad?

36
00:02:12.178 --> 00:02:15.601
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, absolutely.

37
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:20.630
High-level context, which is expensive for
engineers, you know,

38
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.610
when you're working on a project, and
your boss comes over and she says,

39
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.150
hey you got that thing I sent you, and
you like, what I'm doing something.

40
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.360
Content switching's expensive and
the same goes for your hands as well.

41
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.672
So if you never have to leave
your keyboard you're just so

42
00:02:34.672 --> 00:02:37.988
much faster versus this, and
that's why VIM is faster.

43
00:02:37.988 --> 00:02:42.280
Again, there's probably a well actually
person, well actually Emacs is faster, and

44
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.217
that's cool too.

45
00:02:43.217 --> 00:02:48.423
Whatever your best at use that, but VIM,
if you're a master, you are just flying

46
00:02:48.423 --> 00:02:53.260
across the keyboard, because again,
you don't use the mouse at any time.

47
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.300
You're just mastering everything.

48
00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The other question was, can
you map these commands to other inputs,

49
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.720
like to handle all the new MacBook Pro
won't have the escape key?

50
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.220
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Absolutely.

51
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.030
VIM is infinitely configurable,

52
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.820
the first step when you install VIM is
probably installing a bunch of plugins,

53
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.910
same you'd do with Adam or Sublime,
or VS Code, or IntelligeN whatever.

54
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.320
Plugins make the world go round, and VIM
has a bunch of plugins, and it's totally,

55
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.800
totally configurable, and that's also
what makes it very, very powerful.

56
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.330
So we can add syntax editing, or

57
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.890
syntax highlighting, file editing,
all sorts of other things.

58
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.760
Oops, too far.

59
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.270
Question.

60
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.940
James has a link in the chat room for
mapping escape key on the,

61
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.950
if you have a brand new Macbook.

62
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.410
Which if you have your brand new Macbook,
that's awesome, I wanna see it.

63
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.500
Anybody have one?

64
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.340
No, I wanna see that control bar,
that's cool.

65
00:03:50.655 --> 00:03:53.670
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But yeah, again,
we're seeing escape key is so powerful.

66
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.130
That's why I don't understand
why they took it out,

67
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.360
because you really need it in VIM.

68
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.520
So at this point, does everybody here
understand how to write in VIM and

69
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.426
save a file?

70
00:04:04.426 --> 00:04:08.236
Because we will be doing this later and
if you don't know I'm gonna laugh at you.

71
00:04:08.236 --> 00:04:10.901
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: No, I won't, but

72
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:14.710
we will absolutely need to be able
to edit files on a server and

73
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.564
there is no GUI to control, paste into,
and let's say you really love this,

74
00:04:19.564 --> 00:04:24.850
let's say, Jem, you inspired me
to become a server administrator.

75
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.380
So you're in this big, cold building
with a whole row of servers, and

76
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.670
you just have a terminal to
access all these servers.

77
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.630
You have to use VIM, cuz you can't copy,
paste, you can't do anything like that.

78
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.300
It's only a command line.

79
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.790
So, again, we're seeing the command
line is the ultimate toolbox

80
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.220
in every engineer's toolkit.
