00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.960
&gt;&gt; Jem: So engineX is running, it's
responding with the basic 404 page but

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.350
you know we actually wanna make
it respond to real requests.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.950
Actually hit a real live node server,
so first we're going to install git.

4
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.553
All right,
I am not gonna explain what git is,

5
00:00:13.553 --> 00:00:15.210
I hopefully everybody
knows what git is by now.

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.420
And then we're gonna install nodejs and
npm.

7
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.400
This is important,
make sure you installed nodejs, not node.

8
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.770
Node is a completely different package.

9
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.930
It's used like for analyzing radio
frequency, telemetry or something.

10
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.720
So you're gonna install node and you'll
wonder why it's not running anything,

11
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.590
it's because they got there first, they
own the package name node in the repo.

12
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.099
But so go ahead on your server,
sudo apt-get install git.

13
00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:45.950
And then sudo apt-get install nodejs npm.

14
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.370
Or you can do it all at once.

15
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.250
You can do sudo apt-get install nodejs and
npm.

16
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.756
I'm probably just gonna do it all at once.

17
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.878
&gt;&gt; Jem: So sudo apt-get, whoops,

18
00:00:56.878 --> 00:01:01.698
let me clear this out
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Git was already

19
00:01:01.698 --> 00:01:04.029
installed on 16.10 for me.

20
00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:05.470
&gt;&gt; Jem: Nice.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Some people might get.

21
00:01:08.805 --> 00:01:09.600
&gt;&gt; Jem: I think you're correct.

22
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.460
Awesome, that makes it shorter.

23
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.790
So we'll just install nodejs.

24
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.326
And we're gonna install
npm along with that

25
00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:22.085
&gt;&gt; Jem: And continue.

26
00:01:57.494 --> 00:01:58.707
&gt;&gt; Jem: Awesome.

27
00:01:58.707 --> 00:02:03.292
So my node is installed, so
I'm just gonna verify so

28
00:02:03.292 --> 00:02:08.307
I can type in nodejs --version and
I'm on 4.2.6.

29
00:02:12.782 --> 00:02:15.740
&gt;&gt; Jem: Which is okay,
it's a little old but it'll do for

30
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.581
what we need in this instance.

31
00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:19.495
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just to clarify the site's
available we were just looking at

32
00:02:19.495 --> 00:02:21.270
that right,
we didn't actually do anything in there?

33
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.040
&gt;&gt; Jem: We didn't do anything,
we were just looking at it.

34
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.000
Good question though.

35
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
later if we did wanna install Apache,

36
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.170
do we have uninstall Engine X, or do
that command with stop instead of start?

37
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.140
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yeah.
You just stop it.

38
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.350
You can keep it on your machine.

39
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.110
And you can actually have
both if you wanted to.

40
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.519
But yeah, you can just stop it, or you can
remove it and then just install Apache.

41
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But is there a easy command
for upon installing to the command line?

42
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.130
&gt;&gt; Jem: Sudo apt-git remove I
believe Engine X and that'll do it.

43
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.390
But if you're installing Apache,
are you installing PHP or anything?

44
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.728
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, I wanna do a LAMP.

45
00:02:57.728 --> 00:03:01.160
&gt;&gt; Jem: Okay,
I don't know off the top of my head but

46
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.270
I want to say there is a package
that will do it all for you.

47
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.660
Maybe it's Build Essentials might No,

48
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.090
Build Essentials just
gives you the compilers.

49
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.493
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right, there is a way
&gt;&gt; Jem: You need those, you do need those.

50
00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:18.115
Yeah, I want to say there probably is
a package that does it all for you.

51
00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:19.455
I'll have to look it up later, but

52
00:03:19.455 --> 00:03:23.795
cuz it's an extremely common package,
the Apache, MySQL and PHP.
