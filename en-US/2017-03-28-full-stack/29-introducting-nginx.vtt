00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.290
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
now we're gonna move on to Nginx.

2
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.440
We learned about operating systems,
but we're already using that.

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.110
So we don't have to go into
too much detail about that.

4
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.228
Nginx, pronounced engine x,
when I first saw Nginx,

5
00:00:11.228 --> 00:00:16.972
I didn't know how to pronounce it, so
I was like yeah, that ninx, nin jix.

6
00:00:16.972 --> 00:00:20.066
Yeah, it was one of those things like
you can't pronounce until someone says

7
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.120
it before you, so Nginx.

8
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.256
Nginx is an extremely powerful,
you can call it a server, but

9
00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:29.367
it's more of a reverse proxy.

10
00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:35.930
But it's a reverse proxy, mail server,
and generic TCP/UDP server.

11
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.230
Earlier we talked about
the Internet runs on TCP/IP,

12
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.590
transmission control
protocol/Internet protocol.

13
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.003
There's also such thing as UDP packets,
and just,

14
00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:47.571
this is just nerd talk,
the difference between TCP and

15
00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:51.510
UDP essentially is TCP is
guaranteed to get there.

16
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.768
So I send a bunch of packets, and
then the server says I got those packets,

17
00:00:54.768 --> 00:00:56.252
send me some more, that's TCP.

18
00:00:56.252 --> 00:01:00.167
UDP is I just broadcast things and
it may or may not get there.

19
00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:05.223
I have a great joke about UDP packets,
but you guys probably wouldn't get it.

20
00:01:05.223 --> 00:01:06.384
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Anyways, yeah.

21
00:01:06.384 --> 00:01:08.680
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Nobody?

22
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.680
I can't hear the laughter
around the world, but.

23
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I thought it was funny.

24
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.590
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Thank you, thank you.

25
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I smiled,

26
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.421
I didn't laugh, but I smiled.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Thank you, Mark,

27
00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:18.629
I appreciate that.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

28
00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:20.425
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But don't worry about UDP

29
00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:23.334
for now, that was just a fun joke.

30
00:01:23.334 --> 00:01:25.351
Let me slow down,

31
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:30.020
people are still on A records.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I think he's just looking

32
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.212
for the advanced DNS tab.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Back on namecheap,

33
00:01:36.212 --> 00:01:39.226
if you go to your dashboard, Domain List,

34
00:01:39.226 --> 00:01:44.581
click Manage,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And

35
00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:46.101
then click Advanced DNS at the top.

36
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.819
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: [LAUGH] Okay,

37
00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:02.780
[LAUGH] that was a good joke.

38
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.180
Use it at a conference,
and some nerds will laugh.

39
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.310
So mainly today, we're gonna be
using Nginx as a reverse proxy.

40
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.310
So what's a reverse proxy?

41
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.590
But if you're a hacker or
someone that pirates movies illegally or

42
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.700
software, you probably are using some
sort of proxy because otherwise,

43
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.480
the ISPs would trace you
right back to your house.

44
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.270
So you're using a proxy.

45
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.140
And what a proxy does is it takes a bunch
of inputs, routes it through the proxy,

46
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.800
and it sends it all out as one traffic.

47
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.040
So in this case, it would be all
of us using our different IP

48
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.200
addresses going through a proxy, and all
our traffic shows up as one IP address.

49
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.990
We're all masked, and
it goes out to the Internet.

50
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.012
I hope somebody gets
the Internet joke from-

51
00:02:45.012 --> 00:02:46.087
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The Internet.

52
00:02:46.087 --> 00:02:47.326
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: The IT crowd.

53
00:02:47.326 --> 00:02:48.493
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's so light.

54
00:02:48.493 --> 00:02:50.126
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: [LAUGH] I'm looking at

55
00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:53.580
the chatroom to see if anybody's laughing.

56
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.750
No one is laughing.

57
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.470
All right, Samir got it, thank you.

58
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.270
So that's what a proxy is.

59
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.214
So a reverse proxy is reverse of that,
it takes all the Internet traffic and

60
00:03:03.214 --> 00:03:04.792
it goes into the proxy.

61
00:03:04.792 --> 00:03:07.880
And in this case, we're gonna proxy
all our traffic into Node, so

62
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.876
that's why it's called a reverse proxy.

63
00:03:09.876 --> 00:03:13.325
Nginx just sits on top of your server,
it intercepts all the requests, and

64
00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:15.318
it routes those requests appropriately.

65
00:03:15.318 --> 00:03:17.370
And in this case, Node is our main server.
