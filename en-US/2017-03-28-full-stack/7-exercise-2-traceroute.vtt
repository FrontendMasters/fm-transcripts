00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.950
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right,
next exercise, trace routes.

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.321
So, Ping tells us is the server alive.

3
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:09.040
But it won't tell us how we got there.

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.890
Trace routes is a way of saying

5
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.570
these are all the hops that your
request took to get to a server.

6
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.345
So you rarely ever connect
directly to a server,

7
00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:21.300
cuz the server is probably on
the other side of the world.

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.584
He has to keep passing
that data along the pipe.

9
00:00:24.584 --> 00:00:28.050
Trace route is a good way of
showing how we got there.

10
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.938
So, in Windows, it's tracert.

11
00:00:30.938 --> 00:00:35.411
In OSX, Mac OS, or
Unix based system, it's traceroute.

12
00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:41.435
And you should see some nice,
cool output, looks something like this.

13
00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:50.097
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Everybody see something,
trace route?

14
00:00:50.097 --> 00:00:54.654
All right so what's happening is,
your request on your local machine,

15
00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:57.355
it should be 192.168.whatever.

16
00:00:57.355 --> 00:01:00.680
That's a local address, and
it keeps making these hops.

17
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.064
So this is so cool because you're
literally seeing your requests hop from

18
00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:09.462
server to server to server to server
to server to server around the world.

19
00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:10.900
Until it finally gets to where it's going.

20
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.580
So we see, we start on a local machine.

21
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.440
Then we move to our router.

22
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.918
Remember I said 192.168.01
is generally your router.

23
00:01:19.918 --> 00:01:23.050
And we see that's the second
request in my particular example.

24
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.470
And then it hops to your ISP, and
then it hops into another level.

25
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.360
Yes?

26
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.288
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's
just a question on Linux.

27
00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:32.836
He was getting Inetutils,
traceroute tracerout.

28
00:01:32.836 --> 00:01:34.750
He's actually asking, which one?

29
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.840
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It's just traceroute.

30
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Traceroute here, okay.

31
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.720
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It should be built into
the core of most Linux distributions.

32
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.608
But if not, you can just act install.

33
00:01:46.313 --> 00:01:50.150
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Okay, but, so,
this is incredibly useful.

34
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.050
So Ping says, is my site alive and well?

35
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.850
Trace route says, how am I getting there?

36
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.630
And it's really useful to know,
because let's say your DNS is up, but

37
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.343
you're typing in your domain.

38
00:02:03.343 --> 00:02:06.554
You're going to jemyoung.com,
but it's still not resolving.

39
00:02:06.554 --> 00:02:09.950
Trace route will tell you exactly
where in the stack that it's failing.

40
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.650
So it could be your ISP's down.

41
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.587
It could be your router's down.

42
00:02:13.587 --> 00:02:17.573
It could be Amazon's down,
God forbid, jeez.

43
00:02:17.573 --> 00:02:20.410
It could be Rackspace down,
it could be a lot of things.

44
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.790
But trace route is just saying,
here's how I got here.

45
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.020
Here's how I got from one
end to the other end.

46
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.980
And I love trace route, it's one of
my favorite tools, extremely useful.

47
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.140
It's a good tool to have in your
toolbox just for network diagnostics.

48
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.470
Just seeing what's
happening on your server.

49
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.730
And it uses something called
Internet Control Message Packet.

50
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.442
So, there's a TCP,
transmission control packet, and

51
00:02:43.442 --> 00:02:45.960
also a transmission control protocol.

52
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.940
ICMP is Internet Control Message Packet.

53
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.640
It's just a way of communicating to
your server, not information, but

54
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.580
just commands.

55
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.790
So you can do time, sometimes you
can do email commands through ICMP.

56
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.290
But through trace route,
you're actually sending ICMP packets.

57
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.156
I know, this stuff is not sexy at all.

58
00:03:06.156 --> 00:03:09.330
But it's how the internet works,
and it's so cool.

59
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.160
I love this stuff.
