00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.410
&gt;&gt; Jem: So now let's clone a repo I made,
it's called Dev-Ops-for-Frontend,

2
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.570
I changed the name at the last minute
because full stack of front end's

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.498
kind of more appropriate.

4
00:00:07.498 --> 00:00:11.650
But it's
github.com/young/Dev-Ops-for-Frontend.

5
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You got to be,
your username's literally young?

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.630
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's cool.

7
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.700
&gt;&gt; Jem: Let me see, let me just.

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.690
Paste this in the chat too, so
everybody doesn't have to copy paste this.

9
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I just pasted it in there.

10
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.896
&gt;&gt; Jem: Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yep.

11
00:00:32.203 --> 00:00:35.020
&gt;&gt; Jem: So when you git clone,
make sure you're in this directory.

12
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.280
And again pwd will tell you
which directory you're in.

13
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.146
Of course, you can always see up here so,
I'm just gonna run this command.

14
00:00:45.443 --> 00:00:48.299
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: If you wanted to send
something directly from our computer to

15
00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:50.800
this server,
is there a easy way to do that?

16
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.430
Or is it easier just to upload
to GitHub and then clone it, or.

17
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.120
&gt;&gt; Jem: There are many,
many ways of transferring files.

18
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.836
There's FTP, SFTP SCP.

19
00:01:02.836 --> 00:01:06.964
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: [CROSSTALK] Can't you just
get an SSH client too, and just SSH and

20
00:01:06.964 --> 00:01:08.430
drag files over to it.

21
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Or
is that an FTP type thing?

22
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: SCP is basically SSH copy.

23
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Okay.

24
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.298
&gt;&gt; Jem: Wait, wait, I think,
I might have a useless blog post on this

25
00:01:21.298 --> 00:01:22.437
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: [LAUGH]

26
00:01:22.437 --> 00:01:23.810
&gt;&gt; Jem: Because this,

27
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.970
I generally make a blog first and
I'm trying to remember something.

28
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.750
I might have one.

29
00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:37.060
&gt;&gt; Jem: I think one of my first ones and,
yes.

30
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.570
Three years ago, SCP,
simple file transfer from a remote server.

31
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.950
Yeah, SCP is useful.

32
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.780
There are many many ways
of pulling down a file.

33
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.560
You can also curl.

34
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.690
You can wget.

35
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.950
There are not infinite, but there
are dozens of ways to transfer a file.

36
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.060
But we're using wget
just because it's easy.

37
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.560
We're all familiar.

38
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.729
And wget clone sets up
things really nicely for us.

39
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.640
But here's the blog post if you're
curious about how to transfer more.

40
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.020
Like, heavier weight files.
