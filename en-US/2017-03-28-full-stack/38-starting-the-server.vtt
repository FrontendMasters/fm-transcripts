00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.290
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All rightâ‰¤ so
let's go ahead and start our server up.

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.030
So node app js.

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.114
So I will do that as well.

4
00:00:08.114 --> 00:00:12.350
So node, cool.

5
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.490
And it's listening on port 3001,
that's just what I've configured it to.

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.470
So If I go to jem.party,
aah, it still doesn't work.

7
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.810
But if we go to port 3001,
we should get our web page.

8
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.890
We are now hitting our Node server.

9
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.150
Everybody here with me so far?

10
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.240
Awesome, so what's the problem with this?

11
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.597
You can't make a web site, and
it's like, jem.party port 3001.

12
00:00:38.597 --> 00:00:40.920
Then someone would be like,
how do you do a port in a URL?

13
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.660
That's dumb.

14
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.180
No, so what we want is port 80 to redirect
to port 3001 on our local machine.

15
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.110
So how do we do that?

16
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.990
This is where we're gonna use NGINX.

17
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.070
So, as of right now,
I don't actually need NGINX.

18
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.580
If I want to serve my Node
server just out of port 80,

19
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.230
I change 3001 to port 80,
that would work too.

20
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.370
It would connect directly to my Node
application, but we don't wanna do that.

21
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.290
We wanna leave NGINX as
the server that sits between, so

22
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.090
that I can free up the rest of my port.

23
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.220
Since Port 80 is a very valuable port and

24
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.060
you don't generally wanna serve
files directly from a server.

25
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.460
It leaves you open to
all sorts of attacks.

26
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.450
So right now we're gonna
configure our NGINX

27
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.930
to point jem.party directly
to our Node server.

28
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.180
This is where it gets fun if
you weren't having fun before.
