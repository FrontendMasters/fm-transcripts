00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.530
&gt;&gt; Jem: Servers,
I know this is a class about servers and

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.806
things like that and
we haven't onto servers yet, we will now.

3
00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:10.911
So, this is a server, this is
a particularly good looking server but

4
00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:13.730
a server, it's just a computer.

5
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.570
They generally don't have GUIs, they are
just probably some sort of Unix system.

6
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.100
And they're all command line which
is why we're using command line.

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.930
That is a good looking server.

8
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.521
That might be like a or something.

9
00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:28.190
I don't actually know,
but that's a cool server.

10
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.820
So now we are gonna do some
real engineering stuff.

11
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.860
Let's log into a server.

12
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.030
All right, so
we're gonna use ssh to log into a server.

13
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.190
I'm gonna explain what ssh is shortly.

14
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.506
But for now ssh into this test
server that I have up and running.

15
00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:52.692
So, in your command line,

16
00:00:52.692 --> 00:01:01.438
just type in ssh student@45.55.24.145.

17
00:01:11.194 --> 00:01:13.168
&gt;&gt; Jem: Okay, everybody in?

18
00:01:13.168 --> 00:01:14.598
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jem: You know some part of the movie

19
00:01:14.598 --> 00:01:16.904
where they're like come in,
I'm in the server!

20
00:01:16.904 --> 00:01:21.370
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jem: I am so sorry.

21
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.450
Man, where is my head?

22
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.197
The password is iamagreatengineer,
one word all lowercase.

23
00:01:26.197 --> 00:01:32.318
I will type it into the chat room,
iamagreatengineer.

24
00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:40.340
&gt;&gt; Jem: That's the password?

25
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.573
Yes, that is the password.

26
00:01:41.573 --> 00:01:42.294
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That is the password.

27
00:01:42.294 --> 00:01:43.143
&gt;&gt; Jem: All right!

28
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.149
&gt;&gt; Jem: Is everybody in the server?

29
00:01:52.636 --> 00:01:54.100
&gt;&gt; Jem: Cool.

30
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.660
All right let me just,
I am gonna ssh in myself.

31
00:02:05.503 --> 00:02:09.448
&gt;&gt; Jem: So right now, when I say student@,

32
00:02:09.448 --> 00:02:15.188
I'm saying I want to log into
the server as this user.

33
00:02:15.188 --> 00:02:17.531
I forgot what the IP address is already.

34
00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:22.046
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jem: See what it is.

35
00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:24.011
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 45.55.

36
00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:25.022
&gt;&gt; Jem: Thank you.

37
00:02:25.022 --> 00:02:27.690
45.55.

38
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.686
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 24.

39
00:02:28.686 --> 00:02:29.531
&gt;&gt; Jem: 24.

40
00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:30.125
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 145.

41
00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:31.794
&gt;&gt; Jem: 145.

42
00:02:34.516 --> 00:02:38.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 58 users, [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Jem: This poor tiny server's crashing.

43
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.829
Lucky- [LAUGH] we're not the.

44
00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.319
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah there's some
people saying they can't get in.

45
00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.634
&gt;&gt; Jem: Connections being closed but.

46
00:02:54.342 --> 00:02:55.258
&gt;&gt; Jem: Magic.

47
00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:57.894
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Uptime command.

48
00:02:57.894 --> 00:02:58.710
&gt;&gt; Jem: Up time.

49
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.358
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Connection
closed by remote host.

50
00:03:14.533 --> 00:03:16.760
&gt;&gt; Jem: All right,
is everybody still having trouble?

51
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.810
I can try to increase
the server size temporarily,

52
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.680
if we're all having trouble but-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's on a drop plate?

53
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.360
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yeah.

54
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.490
This is using a digitalation drop plate
which we'll talk more about in a second.

55
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.443
I just wanna make sure
everybody can get in.

56
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.900
&gt;&gt; Jem: All right, everybody's in.

57
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.350
All right, you are on a server.

58
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.120
I know, it looks just like you're
on your computer still and again,

59
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.960
that's the beauty of
learning command line.

60
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.200
It works across everywhere.

61
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.330
Let's see, common commands, you could say,

62
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.180
actually probably won't work cuz
there's so many people on the server.

63
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.690
But ls lists files,
actually I'll go over commands later,

64
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.290
yeah, cuz it's not really important.

65
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.400
But the important part is,
you got into the server, you are on.

66
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.330
So if you're at work or something like
that, you can just ssh into a server as

67
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.500
a username and
this is where everything begins.

68
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.056
This is where the power comes from.

69
00:04:09.056 --> 00:04:13.060
So later, [LAUGH] nice.

70
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.890
So later, we're gonna make your own
server, and you can control, and

71
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.640
ssh in, and delete people all you want.

72
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.560
You can broadcast messages.

73
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.840
And you can set up a chron job which
is just a job that repeats over and

74
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.690
over to spam everybody if you want.

75
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.810
But for now, let's move on.

76
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.720
I just want everybody to practice logging
into a server and be comfortable.

77
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.910
So now when someone says,
I'm gonna log into the server,

78
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:36.700
you know what I'm talking about.
