00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.480
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Let's build a Gulp task.

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.880
This is what a Gulp task looks like.

3
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.150
So, you give it a name, and

4
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.720
you say I wanna do these things,
and it executes them.

5
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.920
That's what a task runner does.

6
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.330
It runs tasks.

7
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.773
So, let's create a Gulp task, cuz right
now, you have some boilerplate Gulp tasks

8
00:00:16.773 --> 00:00:20.544
in there, but they don't do everything
that you wanna do for a server.

9
00:00:20.544 --> 00:00:24.685
So,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: You can go ahead and

10
00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:25.810
kill your Node server for now.

11
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.925
So in your command line, on your computer,
on your server, open gulpfile, so

12
00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:35.590
vigulpfile.js, note I'm not
doing direct commands anymore,

13
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.340
cuz at this stage you should know
how to open your gulpfile GI.

14
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.694
And there's a gulp task in
there called clean-css.

15
00:00:46.694 --> 00:00:51.374
Go ahead and fill that out so that when
we run clean-css all the CSS files in

16
00:00:51.374 --> 00:00:56.729
the distribution folder are deleted.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Because

17
00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:59.580
we're using less in this particular
instance, you could also use SaSS.

18
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.230
It's gonna rebuild that every single time.

19
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.530
And our ultimate goal is so
that if we make changes to the HTML, CSS,

20
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.420
the JavaScript it's gonna rebuild all
that, minify into one file, a CSS file and

21
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.032
a JS file and then it's gonna
restart your application for you.

22
00:01:15.032 --> 00:01:19.867
Okay so if you're an uber hacker,

23
00:01:19.867 --> 00:01:24.037
you'd probably just copy and

24
00:01:24.037 --> 00:01:29.390
paste it from the JSS one.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And

25
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.910
then just adjusted it to change to CSS,
that's all you gotta do.

26
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.110
If you typed it all out by hand,
that's also good too.

27
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.500
And I am using ES6 syntax.

28
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.980
So hopefully it's not too
unfamiliar to everybody.

29
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.818
If it is I believe there's a good
course on ES6 on Frontend Masters and

30
00:01:46.818 --> 00:01:50.486
they will tell you exactly
what's going on right now.

31
00:01:50.486 --> 00:01:52.800
But that's it, so
we just made a Gulp task.

32
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.370
The reason why I filled out most of these
and just had you do this one, Gulp task is

33
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.140
a good foundation for just getting stuff
done on a server in a very concise way.

34
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.290
This is all just JavaScript, so it's
easier to reason about than if I said,

35
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.490
let's just make a shell script or
do this in Python.

36
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.662
You can do a lot of powerful things
just using JavaScript and Gulp.

37
00:02:12.662 --> 00:02:16.635
So, next.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: We

38
00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:20.542
have,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: This one,

39
00:02:20.542 --> 00:02:22.890
actually I think I'm just
gonna copy paste this one.

40
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.550
I think everybody's got Gulp pretty well
and I'm gonna put this in the chatroom,

41
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.350
let's take a say 10 minute break,
15 minute break?

42
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.950
Your Gulp task should look
something like this It

43
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.850
all should look exactly like
this cuz that's what I posted.

44
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.820
But essentially all this Gulp task does is
it runs less and it converts it into CSS,

45
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.140
concatenates it all into one file and
puts it into your distribution folder.

46
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.516
The pattern of a distribution folder is
generally a pretty good pattern where you

47
00:02:54.516 --> 00:02:57.537
know that all your production
code is in one folder, and

48
00:02:57.537 --> 00:02:59.621
is the only place you're gonna look.

49
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:03.933
And it's all minified into two distinct
files, your JavaScript files, and

50
00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:04.870
your CSS files.

51
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.220
So it's a good pattern to follow, but
as always, this is your own server,

52
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.590
follow your own pattern as
whatever you're comfortable with.

53
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.850
And let me just save this, oops.

54
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.710
I think I forgot to put that into my yes,
I forgot to put it in here.

55
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.097
Now we just add this to the tasks.

56
00:03:34.038 --> 00:03:35.029
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Put less in there.

57
00:03:37.375 --> 00:03:38.903
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And we'll put the clean,

58
00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:44.994
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Css task in there and

59
00:03:44.994 --> 00:03:46.400
that's it.

60
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.739
That is a pretty solid well
rounded Gulp build system.

61
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:54.790
Pretty straightforward.

62
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.980
We're making sure our
JavaScript's cleaned up.

63
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.994
Our CSS cleans up.

64
00:03:57.994 --> 00:04:02.620
And we can concatenate and minify our
JavaScript files and then we run our less.

65
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.870
We can concatenate and minify that.

66
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.530
And then we serve it up.

67
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.530
Don't worry, we're gonna plug this
all in and will all make sense for

68
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.540
anybody who's confused.

69
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.045
But again, Gulp tasks are a good
way of just getting stuff done on

70
00:04:15.045 --> 00:04:20.017
a server in JavaScript.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So right-click that,
