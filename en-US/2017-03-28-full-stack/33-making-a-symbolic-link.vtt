00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.010
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
one issue right now is I run node, but

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.560
I don't wanna type, if I type node,
it's not going to resolve to anything.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.512
I have to type nodejs.

4
00:00:08.512 --> 00:00:13.160
Well, that's lame, so now I'm in node.

5
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.060
But I don't wanna do this every time.

6
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.040
I'm gonna make a symbolic
link to link node to node.js.

7
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.786
So to make a symbolic link,
first you sudo it.

8
00:00:24.786 --> 00:00:29.477
ln -s,
the first one is where we're coming from,

9
00:00:29.477 --> 00:00:33.633
the second part is where
we're pointing to.

10
00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:38.710
So we're pointing the nodejs binary
to just the symbolic link for

11
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.773
node.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Okay,

12
00:00:45.773 --> 00:00:47.260
so I'm gonna go ahead and do that as well.

13
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.175
So sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs,

14
00:00:54.175 --> 00:00:58.727
and I'm gonna point that to,

15
00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.550
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: /usr/bin, oops, node.

16
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.980
So now, when I type node, we're good.

17
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.820
So now we can run commands as you
do on your personal laptop at home.

18
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.802
You don't have to do this.

19
00:01:17.802 --> 00:01:20.970
It's just easier to, for

20
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.950
your cognitive sense to just always use
node instead of nodejs every single time.
