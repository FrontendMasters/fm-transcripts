00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.400
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: We're almost there.

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.440
We've got a way to keep it up and running.

3
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.370
We can play with our server.

4
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.790
We can keep forever,
we can build our goal task and

5
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.320
keep our app up and running forever.

6
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.090
But, let's put it all together
into something useful.

7
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.630
Yes, I almost forgot about this part.

8
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.820
This is the most important part actually.

9
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.750
We need a log file.

10
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.560
We wanna log everything that happens
cuz let's say forever keeps crashing.

11
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.840
How would you know how and
why it keeps crashing?

12
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.250
Well we have to log it somewhere.

13
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.710
Well first we need to change
ownership of the log directory.

14
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.740
So currently they're owned by sudo.

15
00:00:40.076 --> 00:00:41.047
So.

16
00:00:41.047 --> 00:00:45.959
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Sudo chown -R $USER
shorthand, /var/log/forever.

17
00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:47.540
So I'm gonna go ahead and
do those as well.

18
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.316
That didn't show up.

19
00:00:49.826 --> 00:00:51.320
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: First make that directory.

20
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.273
I'm sorry, need to fix my animations.

21
00:00:53.273 --> 00:00:56.410
So, clear this out,

22
00:00:58.686 --> 00:01:02.501
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: sudo -p mkdir.

23
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:10.370
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Var/log.
We'll just call this forever.

24
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.720
Cool.

25
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.570
Just Linux general tip.

26
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.260
All of your log files are almost
always going to be in /var/log.

27
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.920
So you see here your nginx log is in here,
your auth log's in here.

28
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.050
You always want to put your logs in one
place, and it's just much easier then

29
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.250
trying to dig through your system like,
where did I log that output to?

30
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.530
Always put things in / log.

31
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.930
So we made our log directory, so but

32
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.840
we still need to change ownership cuz
we have to sudo this every time and

33
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.880
we don't want to do that when
we're running forever scripts.

34
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.862
So we can sudo chown -R $USER or

35
00:01:47.862 --> 00:01:52.000
your username doesn't matter.

36
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.288
And we're just going to say
/var/log/forever and we just

37
00:01:57.288 --> 00:02:03.622
changed ownership of that particular
directory into the current user.

38
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.420
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Excellent,
everybody's looking good, a little tired.

39
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.920
So we're there,
that means we learned a lot today.

40
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.400
So now, we're going to start forever but

41
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.880
we're going to log the output
into our log file.

42
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.680
So, what do you call it,
greater than greater than sign.

43
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.600
What is that actually called?

44
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.750
Is it called the greater than sign?

45
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.510
I don't know,
I'm gonna call it the greater than sign.

46
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.710
So two of those will
actually write to a file.

47
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.160
So everything that forever start puts out,
it's gonna write to this log file.

48
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.270
So it's gonna write to forever.log.

49
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.880
And because we changed
the ownership of forever.log,

50
00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.119
we don't need to sudo any of this.

51
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.740
So let's go ahead and do that.

52
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.759
So, forever.

53
00:03:07.928 --> 00:03:14.873
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Start app and
put the output to /var/log/forever.

54
00:03:14.873 --> 00:03:16.868
And we're just gonna call it forever.log.

55
00:03:21.712 --> 00:03:24.030
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And
you don't see any output, why?

56
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.550
Because it's writing to the log.

57
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.410
So if I just cat that file, so

58
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:37.050
cat /var/log/forever/forever we see all
the output is going into that log file.

59
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.850
This is extremely useful.

60
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.320
Logging is how you solve things.

61
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.690
Otherwise, you're just guessing.

62
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.770
If you don't log it,

63
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.980
you're literally just guessing about
what's happening on your server.
