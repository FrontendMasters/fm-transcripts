00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.590
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: This is a way of looking
at the Nginx default configuration for

2
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.120
the server or for the reverse proxy.

3
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.332
So you can cat, but cat just jumps
everything out into the terminal.

4
00:00:12.332 --> 00:00:15.470
It's not terribly useful so
I prefer to use less.

5
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.110
Less is another way of looking at a file
except it will only give you page by page.

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.130
It's much more useful than cat.

7
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.140
So just a refresher, cat dumps everything,
less gives you more page by page.

8
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.300
It's much more useful.

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.389
So go ahead and go to sudo less
/etc/nginx/sites-available/default

10
00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:37.941
on your server, and
I'll go ahead and do that on my end.

11
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:41.817
So clear, sudo less

12
00:00:41.817 --> 00:00:50.937
/etc/nginx/sites-avalable/default.

13
00:00:50.937 --> 00:00:54.402
And you should have been
nginx configuration and

14
00:00:54.402 --> 00:00:59.488
it should look exactly like this
cuz it's the default configuration.

15
00:00:59.488 --> 00:01:01.910
Okay, everybody with me so far?

16
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.410
Yeah, it's kind of ugly,
it's got a lot of, I don't know,

17
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.680
weird comments in here that
you might not understand.

18
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.500
But, Nginx is, why we're using it,
it's A, it's extremely powerful.

19
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.520
It's very configurable.

20
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.370
And it's fast.

21
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.190
It is extremely fast.

22
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.680
Nginx can handle millions and millions of
connections on sometimes a single server,

23
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.800
and that's why we're using Nginx.

24
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.590
You can also use Apache,
Apache is a different type of server.

25
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.030
Apache can actually serve files directly,
similar to Nginx but

26
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.170
it's more of a server where
as Nginx is more of a reverse

27
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.580
proxy is generally the differences but
anybody's ever heard of a LAMP stack?

28
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.700
So Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP.

29
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.860
Apache and PHP go very well together,
and so if your running PHP,

30
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.970
you're likely running Apache.

31
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.900
But, we will focus on that but you're also
free to install Apache on your server but

32
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.260
I prefer Nginx.

33
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.440
It's so fast and it's really,
really, really configurable.

34
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.766
I won't say it's easy to use cuz it's a
little tricky but, it's very configurable.

35
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:14.347
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Actually,
I'll spend a little bit of time so,

36
00:02:16.794 --> 00:02:17.896
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I can actually.

37
00:02:17.896 --> 00:02:23.130
Oops, Q to quit.

38
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.170
I am gonna VI into this, so I can edit it.

39
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.670
You do not have to do this.

40
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.817
I'm just gonna kinda clean
up some of these lines.

41
00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:35.270
And just gonna delete
the comments out of here.

42
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Blue is really hard to read.

43
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.990
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, that's a good point.

44
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.180
Don't worry about the comments for now.

45
00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:53.230
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: The main,
actually leave that alone.

46
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.730
No, I'm good.

47
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.010
The main thing you wanna worry
about here is the server block.

48
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.100
The server block, it's called block
cuz it's just server in brackets.

49
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.147
And this is one of your servers, so

50
00:03:05.147 --> 00:03:08.121
you can have multiple
servers in an Nginx config.

51
00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:11.779
As in, if I go to on my website,
personal website,

52
00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:16.468
blog.jemyoung.com, it has it's
own server configuration.

53
00:03:16.468 --> 00:03:19.614
Just like different parts of my site,
I run different types of servers.

54
00:03:19.614 --> 00:03:22.650
And Nginx, you can put them all in one
file you can split them all across files

55
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.850
and it's really easy to use and
it's so simple looking at it.

56
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.970
You're like, this is the server.

57
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.120
Yes, this is the server, so
this is your default block.

58
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.780
So we're in our server.

59
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.080
We're listening to port 80.

60
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.480
Port 80 is the internet server, that's
what you connect to in your browser.

61
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.026
So if you go to your IP Address Port 80,

62
00:03:40.026 --> 00:03:43.570
it's just gonna take you straight to
the Nginx page, cuz that's default.

63
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.920
Port 443 is the SSL port.

64
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.880
You don't have to worry about this,
cuz browsers do this automatically for

65
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.090
you, but it's just good to have these
things in the back of your head.

66
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.740
So this is my default server,
it's listening on Port 80.

67
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.300
And it's called Default Server.

68
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.991
And it responds to different paths.

69
00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:03.689
So in this case, when I go to.

70
00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.925
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: When I go to this, this is
actually the equivalent of slash, and

71
00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:16.330
Nginx is responding with This 404 page,
it's just the fall back page.

72
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.350
So if I wanted to edit this,
don't do this yet, it's just a demo.

73
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.180
If I edit this and go to /foo,
I can now make all requests go to /foo.

74
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.370
I can make that respond to something else.

75
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.630
So we're gonna edit this in a second,

76
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.750
I just want everybody to kinda
start getting familiar with Nginx.

77
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.290
It's a little intimidating to look
at cuz it's very strange syntax,

78
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.110
but we're gonna do some very
minor modifications, but

79
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.138
I just want you to familiar Nginx works
and how the server configuration works.

80
00:04:43.138 --> 00:04:45.700
So, just gonna exit out of here.

81
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.605
Quit bang, cuz I didn't save anything.

82
00:04:57.261 --> 00:04:59.980
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So now,
we've learned a little bit more.

83
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.470
[LAUGH] It has taken many hours, but
now we're getting down the internet stack.

84
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.910
So now we know we have a domain,
resolves to an IP,

85
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.450
the IP resolves to a server,
Nginx or Apache.

86
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.460
This is where we're
currently at right now.

87
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.520
But in an interview if
you got this far and

88
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.040
you knew all this I'd be pretty impressed.

89
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.200
Anybody having trouble so far?

90
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.130
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: If they're seeing
the 400 of an Nginx page,

91
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.840
is that just the DNS propagation?

92
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.908
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,
cuz I get that on jem.party as well, but

93
00:05:29.908 --> 00:05:33.060
if you choose your IP address,
it should resolve to an Nginx/Apache.

94
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You wanna
tell them about the dig?

95
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.350
The dig command?

96
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.541
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Dig?
I'm not familiar with that one.

97
00:05:39.258 --> 00:05:40.693
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Tell us.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I'll put it in the chatroom.

98
00:05:40.693 --> 00:05:41.237
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Okay.

99
00:05:41.237 --> 00:05:42.671
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH].

100
00:05:42.671 --> 00:05:47.439
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I believe someone asked
earlier how to see domain resolutions so

101
00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:48.338
I believe.

102
00:05:48.338 --> 00:05:51.957
Oops, I'm a little rusty on this one but

103
00:05:51.957 --> 00:05:57.172
I believe I can do nslookup
on we'll say jemyoung.com and

104
00:05:57.172 --> 00:06:01.680
it should tell me where
things are pointed.

105
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.300
So let's see if jem.party is up yet.

106
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.249
I really should've,
every time I say it it's just.

107
00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:11.066
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's so
awesome I'm glad you did that.

108
00:06:11.066 --> 00:06:14.191
We're gonna have a jem.party
after this workshop.

109
00:06:14.191 --> 00:06:15.558
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] And

110
00:06:15.558 --> 00:06:19.023
we'll list the workshop or
the party info on jem.party.

111
00:06:19.023 --> 00:06:19.829
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Just a gif of me going.

112
00:06:19.829 --> 00:06:22.014
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Where am I, where am I.

113
00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:28.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE] We need
a gif creator, and make that.

114
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.988
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So this should resolve
correctly as well, so they both work,

115
00:06:30.988 --> 00:06:35.130
jem.party and
www.jem.party both resolve correctly.

116
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.670
And again, if you wanna see,
whoa, how did I do that?

117
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.950
If you wanna see,
nslookup is some nice commands.

118
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.640
You don't necessarily need it, but
just showing where the domain is pointed.
