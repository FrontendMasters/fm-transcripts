1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.690
&gt;&gt; Jem: So next we need to install Gulp.

2
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:05.427
So we wanna install Gulp globally,
so when we run it,

3
00:00:05.427 --> 00:00:07.678
we run it from the command line.

4
00:00:07.678 --> 00:00:12.382
Otherwise we have to do /nodeModules/Gulp/
something, and that's messy,

5
00:00:12.382 --> 00:00:15.200
so we install things globally.

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.380
So, everybody do npm install -g Gulp.

7
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.950
This one, it doesn't matter
where you install it from.

8
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.875
Doesn't have to be var,

9
00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:30.027
because we're installing it globally.
&gt;&gt; Jem: And

10
00:00:30.027 --> 00:00:31.540
I'm gonna go ahead and run that as well.

11
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.027
So mpm i -g gulp

12
00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:52.980
&gt;&gt; Jem: Permission error.

13
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.770
All that work for nothing.

14
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.120
Yes because we're golf and
solitude/usr/local/lib.

15
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.610
It's not owned by a user,
it's owned by root.

16
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.850
So, the naive approach is let's just

17
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.060
change ownership of local
lib to the current owner.

18
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.200
Don't do that, it'll break everything.

19
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.750
So, what we have to do in this case
is we're going to follow MPMs steps.

20
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.280
I didn't even make slides for it because
their steps are so much better than ours.

21
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.880
But what we're essentially gonna do is
we're gonna point our npm repo into

22
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.156
a different repo that we own, okay?

23
00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:26.903
So everybody that jumped ahead and
tried to global install,

24
00:01:26.903 --> 00:01:29.040
you probably ran into this error, and
you're like, what did I do wrong?

25
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.080
Nothing, that was deliberate.

26
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.210
So,
&gt;&gt; Jem: First we

27
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.490
need to make this directory,
because it doesn't exist.

28
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.118
This is I've run through
all these slides before.

29
00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:46.149
Yeah, thanks.

30
00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.636
I've read through all these slides before,
and

31
00:01:47.636 --> 00:01:50.006
their instructions will tell you to
make something that will throw an error.

32
00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:51.373
So first, make this directory.

33
00:01:51.373 --> 00:02:00.730
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/node_modules.

34
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.110
Because that currently doesn't exist, so
when we run the NPM steps, it will break.

35
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.685
So, I'm going to do that as well.

36
00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:13.674
So, sudo

37
00:02:13.674 --> 00:02:20.240
mkdir dash p
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: mkdir

38
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.670
is spelled wrong.
&gt;&gt; Jem: Thank you

39
00:02:22.922 --> 00:02:29.699
&gt;&gt; [NOISE]

40
00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.571
&gt;&gt; Jem: Local/lib.

41
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:33.731
I think that's what it was.

42
00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:43.674
Node_modules.

43
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.980
Okay.

44
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.500
Everybody with me so far?

45
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.850
Excellent.
So we're just gonna use the npm docs for

46
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.580
this particular incidents because well,
they're pretty solid.

47
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.900
And honestly,
this is how I get stuffed on as well.

48
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.960
I look stuff up and I do it.

49
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.550
So, just a common problem,
enough that they have documentation.

50
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.710
So first, let's run this command.

51
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.460
Let me make this bigger.

52
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.290
Let's run this command in our server and
see what comes up.

53
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.980
So, MPM.

54
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.710
Config.

55
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.000
Get prefix.

56
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.850
And this is just gonna tell,

57
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.180
it's just gonna tell us where MPMs
actually looking for the global installs.

58
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.290
Let me clear this out.

59
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.310
Config.

60
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.900
Flushes your local perfect so
that's that's exactly what it should be.

61
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.580
If it's not, well it is because we're all
the same box again this is the importance

62
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.440
of using the same distribution.

63
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.950
I've run into the thing where if you use
something slightly different at this point

64
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.871
if you're running npm config get prefix
it could be /usr instead of /usr/local.

65
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:59.280
If it's /usr you have to
go through all these steps.

66
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.990
This is why we all are on the same
distribution, lessons learned.

67
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.350
So, what we're gonna do is we're gonna
chown, we're gonna change ownership of

68
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.220
that directory along with the rest of
these directories to our current user.

69
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.300
So, that way we don't have
to suedo install everything.

70
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.030
You should never, ever suedo MPM install
anything because when you install it

71
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.710
you're installing as the root user,
not your current user.

72
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.500
So in this case, I'm going to copy
paste because I'm lazy and it's 3:00.

73
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.350
But feel free to type out if you

74
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.812
want to be a better than me.

75
00:04:37.812 --> 00:04:39.598
And I'm just going to show this.

76
00:04:39.598 --> 00:04:41.853
Cool.

77
00:04:41.853 --> 00:04:46.690
So now, -g gulp, hopefully

78
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.930
this works, fingers crossed.

79
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.095
And it installed correctly, so everything
ran, probably cuz I copy pasted it,

80
00:04:56.095 --> 00:05:01.042
didn't trust my own typing.
&gt;&gt; Jem: This who

81
00:05:01.042 --> 00:05:05.671
am I command just the case,
it tells you what user you are,

82
00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:08.990
so if you run that as
a dollar sign who am I?

83
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.000
It's gonna try to execute
this as an actual command,

84
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.338
which jem is not a package.

85
00:05:15.338 --> 00:05:19.931
So.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You could have

86
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:22.513
also used $USER at that point.
&gt;&gt; Jem: Absolutely,

87
00:05:22.513 --> 00:05:25.058
I should have just used that,
but I was copy and

88
00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:30.701
pasting.
&gt;&gt; Jem: So,

89
00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:36.230
is everybody with me so far?
&gt;&gt; Jem: We copied this from the npm docs.

90
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.373
And we're just changing ownership of
the npm directory to our current users so

91
00:05:41.373 --> 00:05:44.132
that we don't have to
pseudo-install global modules.

92
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.599
&gt;&gt; Jem: Thank, Mark, for pasting that in.

93
00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:01.390
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yes, there we are, slide 124.

94
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.850
We have about 11 more to go.

95
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:10.367
So, almost there.
&gt;&gt; Jem: Okay so

96
00:06:10.367 --> 00:06:14.360
now gulp Let's go ahead and
make sure gulp is up and running.

97
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:21.147
Now make sure I'm in my working directory.

98
00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:22.260
Clear.

99
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:29.090
So, I should be able to run gulp build and
all the tasks complete successfully.

100
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.090
If you have a syntax error,

101
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.130
you're about to discover that you
have a syntax error at this point.

102
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.695
The Gulp task will not complete.
&gt;&gt; Jem: If we ls our dist file,

103
00:06:38.695 --> 00:06:43.129
we see that we have only two files
that we're gonna serve out for

104
00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:46.825
our web page main.min.css and
main.min.js file

105
00:07:02.493 --> 00:07:06.058
&gt;&gt; Jem: Okay so, here's our Gulp locally,

106
00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:11.578
globally, we have the ability
now to install npm modules

107
00:07:11.578 --> 00:07:18.030
globally without having a pseudo command,
which is very useful.

108
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.720
I have done the pseudo install, and

109
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.920
it's a nasty business that you just have
to keep pseudoing every single time.

110
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.210
And it's just unpleasant.

111
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.930
So, it's a little bit extra work
to do it right the first time, but

112
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.260
it's better in the long run.
