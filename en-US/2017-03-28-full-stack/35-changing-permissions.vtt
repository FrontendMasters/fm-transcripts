00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.720
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Okay, so
we all have a www directory.

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.721
So, you know, I had to keep
sudoing when I wanna make a file.

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:07.610
I don't wanna do that anymore.

4
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.684
So, I'm gonna chown something, so,
chown stands for change of owner.

5
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.360
And I'm just gonna change
that into donor to be me.

6
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.157
In this case,
this particular case $user is

7
00:00:22.157 --> 00:00:26.330
dash shorthand for your current user.

8
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.905
It's not a placeholder.

9
00:00:27.905 --> 00:00:32.802
So,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I'm going to chown the www

10
00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:34.480
directory to myself.

11
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.986
So sudo,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: chown -R for

12
00:00:39.986 --> 00:00:44.790
recursive, and $USER is me.

13
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.180
And the group is also me.

14
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.400
You don't have to do the group,
it's just a good habit.

15
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.110
And I wanna change the ownership
of the www directory to myself.

16
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So does root on it now?

17
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.680
And we're changing it to our ownership.

18
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.523
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Exactly, so
currently now I own it.

19
00:00:59.523 --> 00:01:06.910
So now I can make directory tmp2, and
it won't as me to sudo it anymore.

20
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:07.720
So that's useful.

21
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.210
Permissions is a whole nother two hour
lesson, but don't overdo permissions,

22
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.200
don't change things just because
it makes it easier on yourself.

23
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.800
If something's owned by sudo,

24
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.640
leave it owned by sudo until you
understand exactly what's happening.

25
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.950
Stupid story of my own, I was trying
to globally install an MPM module.

26
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.100
But I don't own /user/local,
it's owned by sudo.

27
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.160
So I was like,
I'll just change ownership to me.

28
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.630
So I changed the ownership to me, and
then it just broke the entire computer,

29
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.670
cuz sudo couldn't get in anymore.

30
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.870
It didn't work properly, and
I locked myself out, and

31
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.270
I had to delete the entire server and
start over.

32
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.938
So anyways, moral of the story is,

33
00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.730
don't change ownership unless
you really really need to.

34
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.505
But in this case,
since we're gonna be writing a lot, and

35
00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:50.773
we don't want to sudo every single time,

36
00:01:50.773 --> 00:01:53.050
it's better to change
ownership to yourself.

37
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.189
So let me just remove,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Is it RAM 3 or

38
00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.174
is it Windows?

39
00:01:59.174 --> 00:01:59.830
Yeah.

40
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.320
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Tmp star, cool.

41
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.748
If you want to remove things
that are named similarly, so

42
00:02:08.748 --> 00:02:11.712
let's make mkdir tmp, mkdir tmp2.

43
00:02:11.712 --> 00:02:15.985
If I want to remove multiple things,
I can say rmdir tmp*, and

44
00:02:15.985 --> 00:02:19.630
it's gonna remove everything
that starts with tmp.

45
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.040
It's just a fast way of moving a bunch
of files that are named similarly.

46
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.586
It's good for cleaning up log files, or

47
00:02:25.586 --> 00:02:30.960
something where you know what
the file name starts with.

48
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.552
So I can also say rm -rf tmp *,
and it'd do something similar.

49
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.117
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: See now we're getting
into the good, fun command-line stuff.

50
00:02:43.117 --> 00:02:44.990
And I'll just keep throwing
random tips out there.
