00:00:00.042 --> 00:00:02.160
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right,
we are in a server now.

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.865
So, let's just run a quick exercise.

3
00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:12.740
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Just go out on your server.

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.522
Just go ahead and run top.

5
00:00:15.727 --> 00:00:16.634
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So, I'll do that now.

6
00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:23.321
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Top.

7
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.720
Top is, think of it as the equivalent
of Activity Monitor on Mac,

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.900
or your Task Manager on Windows.

9
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.160
It just tells you what's
happening on your system,

10
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.980
what's using up a lot of processes.

11
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.710
I use top quite often
if the system's slow.

12
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.535
We can see, nodes eating up two cores of
my CPU, or it's eating up all my RAM,

13
00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:44.930
things like that.

14
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.826
Top is just one of those utilities
you have in your belt just to see to

15
00:00:48.826 --> 00:00:50.852
see what's going on in my system.

16
00:00:50.852 --> 00:00:55.254
There is something called htop,
which is a little bit cleaner.

17
00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:56.933
And to quit out of top, just hit q.

18
00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:01.390
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So, again, top to get in.

19
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.240
Just type q to quit.

20
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.942
So, let's see if htop is installed.

21
00:01:08.942 --> 00:01:10.279
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I had to install it.

22
00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.912
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It's not installed.

23
00:01:10.912 --> 00:01:14.186
So, to install it let's just say apt-get.

24
00:01:14.186 --> 00:01:17.630
Apt-get is the package manager for Ubuntu.

25
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.447
Install htop.

26
00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you
have to type get anymore?

27
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.009
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I guess you don't.

28
00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.915
I guess [CROSSTALK].

29
00:01:28.915 --> 00:01:30.034
Nice.

30
00:01:30.034 --> 00:01:33.200
They really flying along.

31
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.305
Okay, so, now we can say htop,
which is a prettier version of top.

32
00:01:40.886 --> 00:01:44.134
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And htop is pretty popular.

33
00:01:44.134 --> 00:01:46.723
I tend to use it a bit more than top,
just cuz it's nicer to look at,

34
00:01:46.723 --> 00:01:47.618
easier to recognize.

35
00:01:47.618 --> 00:01:48.243
But, again,

36
00:01:48.243 --> 00:01:52.007
top is gonna be installed on most Linux
distributions without installing anything.

37
00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:57.202
So, it's good to know
kinda the core utilities.

38
00:01:57.202 --> 00:02:00.593
So, anything interesting happening?

39
00:02:00.593 --> 00:02:01.202
Not really.

40
00:02:01.202 --> 00:02:04.353
We're actually using,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: No,

41
00:02:04.353 --> 00:02:06.597
nothing really interesting happening,
cuz there's nothing running.

42
00:02:06.597 --> 00:02:08.488
Just basic system commands, so far.

43
00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:13.930
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And to quit out of htop,
just type q, just like normal.
