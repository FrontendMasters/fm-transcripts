1
00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.800
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So,
we made a public key authentication.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.340
Let's talk about the blank slate,
the tabula rasa of engineering.

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.458
And that's servers.

4
00:00:09.458 --> 00:00:15.620
A server is,
well it's anything you want it to be.

5
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.340
A server's just a dumb box and it has no
purpose or intent when you first start.

6
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.930
A server can be a web server,
they serve out HTML files.

7
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.016
It could be a database server that
you only connect to to serve MySQL or

8
00:00:28.016 --> 00:00:29.220
Postgres or Mongo.

9
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.770
It could just be a dumb
storage server that you use

10
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.750
to upload all your cat pictures to.

11
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.500
A server doesn't do anything until
you give it some sort of purpose,

12
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.680
and that's the great thing about a server,
it can be anything.

13
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.414
Sorry, that's my passionate,
passionate speech on servers.

14
00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:51.464
I know we talked about SSH,
and I just jumped to servers.

15
00:00:51.464 --> 00:00:55.588
We're gonna use the SSH key
later to get into a server.

16
00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:57.616
But, we're gonna build a server and

17
00:00:57.616 --> 00:01:00.697
then we're gonna use the SSH
key to get into the server.

18
00:01:00.697 --> 00:01:04.030
So there's two main types of servers.

19
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.310
There's a dedicated server, and
that's something where I own the box,

20
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.100
the box sitting in the backroom,
or something.

21
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.960
I can plug into that,

22
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.770
I can take parts out, that's a dedicated
server, it's only your machine.

23
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.490
Or there's a VPS,
a virtual private server.

24
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.140
So a dedicated server if you wanted
to look at a decent analogy.

25
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.570
That's what a dedicated server look,
you own the entire machine.

26
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.780
You own all 8, 16 cores,
you own everything from top to bottom.

27
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.680
But most of the time we don't do that
because a server is extremely expensive,

28
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.080
thousands of dollars.

29
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.520
So we use something called a VPS.

30
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.390
A VPS takes a dedicated server and

31
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.550
just breaks it up into
chunks that we can all use.

32
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.280
So we're all going to use a VPS today.

33
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.550
So that means there's a server somewhere,

34
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.930
we're all just taking
a little bit of chunk.

35
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.860
We're taking a core and
two gigs of memory a piece.

36
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.000
And the invention of the VPS was so
fantastic, because before,

37
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.630
if I wanted a server,
I needed to buy a dedicated server.

38
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.640
So like, a Xeon processor and
spend thousands of dollars.

39
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.250
Plug it in somewhere, hook up the DNS,

40
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.850
do all of this other sort of terrible,
terrible mess.

41
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.540
But with a VPS I can just
hook it to the cloud and

42
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.570
I just get a little chunk of the server.

43
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.906
And if I need a little bit more,
I can buy a little bit more server time.

44
00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:18.500
I can buy a little bit more, a little
bit more, it's very, very scalable.

45
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.430
So we understand what a VPS is and
a dedicated server.

46
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.574
This essentially what most
internet services look like and

47
00:02:28.574 --> 00:02:31.178
this is colloquially known as the Cloud.

48
00:02:31.178 --> 00:02:34.330
So when someone says cloud computing,
this is what they mean.

49
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.840
It just means you're buying a chunk
of a server somewhere, and you

50
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.670
buy a bunch of them than you tie that up
as a service, and that's cloud computing.

51
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.030
That's it, nothing fancy.

52
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.430
I mention it because I think
there's a survey, maybe 30,

53
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.280
no it's like 2 years ago,
it wasn't that long ago.

54
00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.900
And they asked adults like 18 to 35 if it
rains does the cloud performance get bad?

55
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.090
And I think like 60% of people said yes,

56
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.440
because they don't
understand cloud computing.

57
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.640
It's such a buzz word.

58
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.660
This is all cloud computing is.

59
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.820
Just a bunch of servers somewhere.

60
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.640
They could be in Singapore,
it could be in Russia.

61
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.890
It could be in China,

62
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.910
could be in United States in
Virginia where AWS is, the main one.

63
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.390
That's all cloud computing is.

64
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.070
So, I don't like buzz words so
I won't use cloud anymore.

65
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.160
The advantages of the cloud are,
well I said I wouldn't use it.

66
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.150
The advantage of VPSs
are they're flexible.

67
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.230
I can make one server,
I can make ten servers just as easy.

68
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.944
They're scalable, so if I say,
man I need more memory.

69
00:03:41.944 --> 00:03:46.020
I can just increase the memory,
I can just increase the allocation.

70
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.160
Of course there's a maximum limit on VPS,
so

71
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.680
the maximum limit is of course
the size of that server.

72
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.460
I can't make my VPS bigger
than the server that it's on.

73
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.460
But, and it's on demand as well.

74
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.730
That's the advantage of a VPS is that,
when I'm done today,

75
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.720
I'm probably gonna turn off my server so
I don't have to pay for it anymore.

76
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.971
And that's what's great versus owning your
own server that you have to maintain and

77
00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:10.036
do all these other things.

78
00:04:10.036 --> 00:04:13.230
I can use it on demand.

79
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.879
Yeah, cloud computing is such a boon.

80
00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:20.980
We wouldn't be where we are today
without things like this.

81
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.510
The main providers that you've
probably heard of for VPSs are AWS,

82
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.570
that's Amazon's big offering.

83
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.950
Rackspace, another big one,
and Digital Ocean.

84
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.040
Digital Ocean is the one
we're gonna be using today.

85
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.410
I use AWS on jemyoung.com.

86
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.580
But AWS is very advanced,
it's extremely powerful.

87
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.540
It's what Netflix runs on.

88
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.249
We're the biggest users of AWS.

89
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.799
And, thousands and thousands and
thousands and thousands of servers.

90
00:04:49.799 --> 00:04:53.260
But it's, I wouldn't say AWS is
friendly to beginners whatsoever.

91
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.070
[LAUGH] Yeah, anybody who's used
AWS knows what I'm talking about.

92
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.940
Digital Ocean I find fantastic,

93
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.710
it is such a clean user interface, and
it's really, really easy to get started.

94
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.860
And It's just fantastic to use.

95
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.907
Sponsored by Digital Ocean.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,

96
00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:08.801
exactly.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: No.

97
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:11.522
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] Now we're gonna

98
00:05:11.522 --> 00:05:12.462
fleece them down for

99
00:05:12.462 --> 00:05:14.560
some cash after this workshop.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: You should.

100
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.940
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Maybe they could give

101
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.510
members some DO credit or something.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,

102
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.750
I should've emailed them.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I'm pretty sure

103
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.750
Digital Ocean gives out free credit for
students cuz there's a Github

104
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.560
pack I think they're a part of.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So I think they would

105
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.155
probably be down for that honestly.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: We should,

106
00:05:32.155 --> 00:05:38.240
maybe closer to lunch we'll see
if we can hook ourselves up.

107
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.340
But regardless, Digital Ocean, for a VPS,
the smallest one is only $5 a month.

108
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.330
And since we're only gonna use it for

109
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.510
maybe a few hours it's
gonna be a couple cents and

110
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.046
that's that's what's fantastic about
building a scalable, on-demand system.
