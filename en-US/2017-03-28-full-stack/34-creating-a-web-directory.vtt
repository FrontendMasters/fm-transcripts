00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.525
&gt;&gt; Jem: So
next we're gonna make a www directory,

2
00:00:02.525 --> 00:00:06.208
this is where we're gonna put all of
our files that we want to serve out.

3
00:00:06.208 --> 00:00:09.559
So we're gonna make it in the /var is
generally where you put things like this.

4
00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:16.790
&gt;&gt; Jem: So sudo mkdir -p /var/www.

5
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.930
And I'll go ahead and do that as well.

6
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.980
So sudo mkdir.

7
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.497
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We already got one.

8
00:00:25.497 --> 00:00:26.435
&gt;&gt; Jem: You do?

9
00:00:26.435 --> 00:00:28.149
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think NGINX-
&gt;&gt; Jem: It might have it by default,

10
00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:30.891
that's a good point, let me-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah that's usually where

11
00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:32.542
the it works comes from.

12
00:00:32.542 --> 00:00:36.020
&gt;&gt; Jem: It already has one in there,
awesome, so we don't have to do that.

13
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.480
But just in case you're on a server
that doesn't have a www built in,

14
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.960
you can make it.

15
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.147
But let's just go ahead and
cd into that directory, so cd /var/www.

16
00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:50.303
And if we ls, there's an HTML
folder in there already, but

17
00:00:50.303 --> 00:00:51.830
we won't need that for now.

18
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So, question, what's
the point of the p after make directory?

19
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.850
Won't that make a directory?

20
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.680
You know what I'm saying?

21
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.550
You said that the p was for it'll create
a directory if it's not there already.

22
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.093
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But

23
00:01:07.093 --> 00:01:12.998
what's the point of having-
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yeah, so let's test that out.

24
00:01:12.998 --> 00:01:17.180
So if I wanna mkdir,
actually I'll just do a temp one here.

25
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.749
So mkdir tmp, forgot to change sudo.

26
00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:23.361
Bang, bang.

27
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:26.700
So now I've got temp directory.

28
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:35.520
So if I mkdir again,
&gt;&gt; Jem: It's gonna throw an error.

29
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.852
But if I do sudo-p, it won't error out.

30
00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:43.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: mkdir.

31
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:51.310
&gt;&gt; Jem: Thanks, I am not perfect,
by far, and it won't throw an error.

32
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.100
That's where you use a -p command.

33
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The other thing you can do
is if you create a directory chain and

34
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.069
the intermediate directories don't exist,
the -p will create them as well.

35
00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.351
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cool, okay.

36
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:03.469
&gt;&gt; Jem: Good, good point, yeah.

37
00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:04.168
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cool.

38
00:02:04.168 --> 00:02:07.727
&gt;&gt; Jem: So generally if I'm making
a directory, I always use -p because it's-

39
00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:08.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just to be safe.

40
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.300
&gt;&gt; Jem: Just to be safe, yeah.

41
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, that's why I
just didn't, yeah, okay, cool.

42
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.260
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yeah, great, thank you,
that's an excellent tip.
