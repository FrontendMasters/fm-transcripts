00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.670
&gt;&gt; Jem: Command mode, so
let's go to insert mode.

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.220
Type "Hello, World!", then press Enter.

3
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.029
Type "Hello, class!", okay so,
now that we have something to search,

4
00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:13.450
we're gonna use the search command.

5
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.840
Back in VIM,
let me just type Hello, world.

6
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.650
So hit escape back in command mode.

7
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.937
So if I wanna search /
I can type in Hello.

8
00:00:30.937 --> 00:00:34.396
I hit Enter, I'm now searching documents.

9
00:00:34.396 --> 00:00:38.411
I hit End, still in command mode,
and move to the next

10
00:00:38.411 --> 00:00:44.481
instance.
&gt;&gt; Jem: I know,

11
00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:47.368
this seems trivial for
a two line document, but later,

12
00:00:47.368 --> 00:00:50.450
when we're in much larger documents,
find will save you.

13
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.090
Unless you wanna just scroll, scroll,
scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.

14
00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.466
Shift+N searches from the bottom
of the document, so Shift+N,

15
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:06.007
N for search.
&gt;&gt; Jem: I have VIM cheat sheets,

16
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:07.249
and they are massive.

17
00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:09.243
Because there are a lot of
commands that you use and

18
00:01:09.243 --> 00:01:11.013
you probably don't even know that you use.

19
00:01:11.013 --> 00:01:16.150
But I don't wanna get too bogged down
in all the commands, cuz they are many.

20
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.870
So, so far we've learned search
from bottom search from the top,

21
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.420
we've learned how do undo and redo.

22
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.290
Let's keep going and
learn some more commands.

23
00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:31.513
&gt;&gt; Jem: Okay, yeah, so, I cut and

24
00:01:31.513 --> 00:01:36.110
paste out of linuxmoz.com,
they have cheat sheets.

25
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.940
But trust me when I say it is many,
many pages so

26
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.720
I only want to give you the relevant, yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there a way to make

27
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.150
the search non case-sensitive?
&gt;&gt; Jem: There is,

28
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.954
I actually don't know
off the top of my head.

29
00:01:48.954 --> 00:01:53.810
I am not a VIM pro, but the good thing is
if you Google non case-sensitive search,

30
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.750
actually I'll just do that now.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think it is non

31
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.000
maybe you meant case-sensitive,

32
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.375
cuz I dont think it is.
&gt;&gt; Jem: I think it is currently,

33
00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:04.284
it's case-sensitive now.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: By default, case-sensitive.

34
00:02:04.284 --> 00:02:07.109
&gt;&gt; Jem: So I'm just gonna do what I'm

35
00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:11.298
doing, VIM case-insensitive, search.

36
00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:13.329
This is how I solve all
my problems at work, too.

37
00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:20.314
How do I do case-insensitive search?
&gt;&gt; Jem: Slash C,

38
00:02:20.314 --> 00:02:23.375
interesting, let's give that a shot.

39
00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:27.783
So I'll go back in Insert mode,
actually go to here.

40
00:02:27.783 --> 00:02:31.242
Just want to go to the end, Insert.

41
00:02:31.242 --> 00:02:35.021
Actually, undo, say hello.

42
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.483
&gt;&gt; Jem: Hello /, what's that, forward c?

43
00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:48.272
&gt;&gt; Jem: Cool.

44
00:02:50.816 --> 00:02:54.427
&gt;&gt; Jem: So that was in command mode,

45
00:02:54.427 --> 00:02:59.694
escape / \c, and then case unsensitive

46
00:02:59.694 --> 00:03:04.756
search.
&gt;&gt; Jem: I know,

47
00:03:04.756 --> 00:03:09.518
it's so gnarly,
cuz this is not what we're used to at all.

48
00:03:09.518 --> 00:03:12.355
And it gets people the first
time they use VIM.

49
00:03:12.355 --> 00:03:14.123
They're just like, this is so ugly.

50
00:03:14.123 --> 00:03:15.992
But, again, if you're a VIM pro and

51
00:03:15.992 --> 00:03:18.778
you have all this stuff
memorized from muscle memory.

52
00:03:18.778 --> 00:03:22.872
You're so much faster than most
other IDEs you could possibly

53
00:03:22.872 --> 00:03:27.695
use.
&gt;&gt; Jem: Great question though, and

54
00:03:27.695 --> 00:03:29.644
never be scared to Google something.

55
00:03:29.644 --> 00:03:34.442
[LAUGH] Trust me, so many people just,
I don't know, they get intimidated.

56
00:03:34.442 --> 00:03:37.050
And think no I need to
memorize everything.

57
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.900
No, I don't memorize most things,
I have a search engine.

58
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.490
So these are valuable cheats that you use.

59
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.191
Again DD deletes a line, useful.

60
00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:54.509
:q will exit VI without saving anything.

61
00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:56.314
:wq is probably the one
you're gonna use most.

62
00:03:58.739 --> 00:03:59.762
&gt;&gt; Jem: So,

63
00:04:01.342 --> 00:04:02.325
&gt;&gt; Jem: Actually, I think that's

64
00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:02.928
the next slide.

65
00:04:02.928 --> 00:04:07.933
So this just,
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yeah, so feel free that, these

66
00:04:07.933 --> 00:04:12.208
slides again are on jemyoung.com/fefs
if you need to come here and reference.

67
00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:14.538
Or you can just Google VIM cheat sheet,
and

68
00:04:14.538 --> 00:04:16.880
it'll tell you a whole bunch of commands.

69
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.680
It'll tell you probably way
more than you want to know.
