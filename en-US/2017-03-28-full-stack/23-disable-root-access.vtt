00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.987
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Excellent,
back to the slides.

2
00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:07.494
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Again,
just run this command so

3
00:00:07.494 --> 00:00:10.801
you log in with your ssh key and
Security Terry.

4
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:11.780
What's he gonna say?

5
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.920
Disable root login!

6
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.320
Yes, we do not ever want to log
in as root cuz you don't have to.

7
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.130
You never wanna log in as root.

8
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.980
Again if you're doing things with root the
server will not warn you when you're about

9
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.390
to do something really stupid,
it'll just let you do it and

10
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.110
we wanna let the server tell us if
we're about to do something stupid.

11
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.170
So disable root login,
actually why do we single root login?

12
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.850
So this is a screenshot from last night,

13
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.640
number eight maybe it
was the night before.

14
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.670
Two days ago.

15
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.210
So I created a test server that students
over there already logged into earlier.

16
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.350
So, here is where I created it and
then this was thirty eight seconds

17
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.330
later somebody is already trying
to break into that server,

18
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.250
from that IP address and
if you look at where that IP address is?

19
00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.860
It's somewhere in China.

20
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.730
So this is why I say
security is a real thing.

21
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.390
I make light of it, but it's a serious
business especially if you have customer

22
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.990
sensitive data on your server you want to
disable root login cuz that's the first

23
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.570
thing that people are gonna try to go for
when they try to break into your server.

24
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.670
Cuz root is the easiest way.

25
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.020
Root with no password is just like,

26
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.910
it's leaving your house wide open
with your flat screen, invisible, and

27
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.130
your gold bars and your Ferraris,
and whatever else everybody has.

28
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.840
You don't have Ferraris in your-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] Certainly not on my

29
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.330
Digital Oceans server.

30
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.830
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, yeah.

31
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.540
[LAUGH] So, what we wanted to do is,
we wanted to disable re-login.

32
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.380
So we are gonna modify the SSH config.

33
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.344
SHD, stand for SH Daemon.

34
00:01:42.344 --> 00:01:44.440
A Daemon is just a process
that runs on your server.

35
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.220
So, we are sudo into that and edit it in
vi and we are just disable root login.

36
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.285
So, I will give everybody
a second to do that.

37
00:01:54.285 --> 00:02:02.863
So in your command line sudo
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

38
00:02:02.863 --> 00:02:04.213
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Of course,
this is from the server, right?

39
00:02:04.213 --> 00:02:05.137
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: This is on the server, yes.

40
00:02:05.137 --> 00:02:09.267
Everything we do from now on will be
on the server until I say exit out.

41
00:02:09.267 --> 00:02:10.332
Good question, though.

42
00:02:12.894 --> 00:02:15.442
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there no
auto-complete on the server?

43
00:02:15.442 --> 00:02:17.375
Or tab complete, I should say.

44
00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:18.105
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: There is.

45
00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:19.128
That's a good way to tell
if you're [INAUDIBLE]

46
00:02:19.128 --> 00:02:20.926
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE] delayed.

47
00:02:23.067 --> 00:02:27.489
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And just find the line that
says permit root log in an it'll say yes,

48
00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.737
change that to no.

49
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:35.283
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And if you can't find it,

50
00:02:35.283 --> 00:02:39.230
remember how to find in command mode
slash whatever you're trying to find.

51
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.559
So as soon as more people start
looking up, I'll go ahead and

52
00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:47.361
demo that on our server.

53
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.210
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Okay, so I'm just
gonna go ahead and do that example.

54
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.761
So I'm on my server, so

55
00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:04.680
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_,

56
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.923
let's Tab complete that.

57
00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:13.339
To my sudo password, and

58
00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:18.388
I'm gonna find permit right there.

59
00:03:18.388 --> 00:03:23.786
And dollar sign's gonna jump
me to the end, insert no.

60
00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:25.071
And write quit.

61
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:30.950
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Everybody follow that?

62
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.409
It's pretty fast but
these are the commands we're running.

63
00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.534
You're gonna vi sshd PermitRootLogin,
change that to no.

64
00:03:39.534 --> 00:03:40.856
Then we're gonna restart the ssh service.

65
00:03:40.856 --> 00:03:42.149
So you can change this file all day,

66
00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:44.920
until you restart the service
it won't take effect.

67
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:52.850
So to restart the service, sudo service,
ssh and we'll say restart.

68
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: SSHD?

69
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.500
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: In this case no.

70
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.260
Usually it would be sshd but
ssh I believe will do into this one.

71
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.930
You might be right.

72
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:01.870
Actually I'll do sshd.

73
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.040
I think they both work on a for
some reason.

74
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Interesting.

75
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.470
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, I've done it before
and it works with ssh but great point.

76
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.710
Let's do sshd,
that's the daemon that's actually ssh.

77
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.720
But I believe you can do either.

78
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, I just did
the other one and it worked, I think.

79
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.073
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Wow.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Okay, hey,

80
00:04:16.073 --> 00:04:18.376
I learn something new every time.

81
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.830
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So at this point,
you have now disabled your root login.

82
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.630
So I know I've hammered
it at least 50 times.

83
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.190
But if you were not able to login
with the user you made, you are now,

84
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.900
once you log out, you will be locked
out unless you did things correctly.

85
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.730
So I'm just gonna exit.

86
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:41.610
I just wanna make sure that I'm
still able to login, and we're good.

87
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.730
So if you exited and
you were not able to login,

88
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.750
you might have to start
over at this point.

89
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.084
I am really sorry.

90
00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:51.025
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes.

91
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.115
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah,
they were just asking about what sshd is.

92
00:04:55.115 --> 00:04:55.830
Can you just explain that?

93
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.757
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, so there are processes
on servers which are constantly running in

94
00:04:58.757 --> 00:04:59.500
the background.

95
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.834
They're called daemons.

96
00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:03.360
And sshd just stands for ssh daemon.

97
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.050
It's the process that's running ssh
in the background at all times.

98
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.861
Great question, though.

99
00:05:11.109 --> 00:05:14.228
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right, so
everybody in this room looks good,

100
00:05:14.228 --> 00:05:16.393
no one looks scared or perplexed.

101
00:05:16.393 --> 00:05:18.593
So we are all logged in.

102
00:05:21.586 --> 00:05:24.166
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right, so
if you did this correctly,

103
00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:27.057
Internet High Five from
my hand on the screen.

104
00:05:27.057 --> 00:05:28.774
You can't see me at home, but

105
00:05:28.774 --> 00:05:33.311
good work everybody that was a that was
pretty hard and it's a little dangerous

106
00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:37.390
to get into the land of lock yourself
out of server but we're good now.
