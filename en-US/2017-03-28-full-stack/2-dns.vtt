00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.910
&gt;&gt; Jem: So, IP address,
stands for internet protocol.

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.960
It's just the type of protocol that people
agreed on years ago to say, here's how

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.570
I wanna communicate with other networks,
and there are lots of different protocols,

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.155
but we use something called,
TCP/IP, let me switch.

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.090
TCP is transmission control protocol,

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.240
we're not gonna cover that because
that is a totally different class.

7
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.500
That's networking 101, but
just know that when someone says TCP/IP,

8
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.310
that's a system that the internet
uses to communicate, one of many.

9
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.300
And it maps IP, we're using,
it takes IP addresses,

10
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.830
which we all learned, and
it maps them to domains.

11
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.150
So think of DNS as
the internet phone book.

12
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.044
If you to jim-young.com,
you're actually going to 23.23.

13
00:00:49.044 --> 00:00:53.071
I don't even know my own IP address,
that's why we use domains.

14
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:59.950
So remember like two weeks ago when
the internet broke, the internet went out?

15
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:00.510
What happened?

16
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Wouldn't,
all the major companies got hacked, right?

17
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.810
There was a, was it a DDoS?

18
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.022
&gt;&gt; Jem: It was some sort of DDoS.

19
00:01:08.022 --> 00:01:10.598
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [CROSSTALK] hack where
they hacked all the major companies,

20
00:01:10.598 --> 00:01:11.222
like Google.

21
00:01:11.222 --> 00:01:12.702
All the major, like Amazon or
whatnot, that so

22
00:01:12.702 --> 00:01:17.750
one could do the online- They
actually hacked the DNS provider.

23
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.669
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Which basically shut down
everybody from looking up any address.

24
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.000
&gt;&gt; Jem: Exactly right.

25
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.710
And this is one of the weak
points of the internet is that

26
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.610
as humans we can't remember
what these IP addresses are.

27
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.240
I don't even remember my own IP address
from my own server I've had for years.

28
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.440
So DNS is just kind of a friendly way of
resolving domain names, IP addresses.

29
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.460
So when that hack happened actually, it
wasn't an attack on individual companies

30
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.790
and it was only an attack on one company,
I believe in Massachusetts or main.

31
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.872
And it took the DNS offline
which broke the internet but

32
00:01:49.872 --> 00:01:54.750
it didn't, it just meant that we can
type in domain gets resolved anymore.

33
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.205
So that's a failing of DNS and
it's something to be aware of.

34
00:01:58.205 --> 00:02:02.060
But don't worry, it's probably
not gonna happen to your website.

35
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.250
And there's caches and all sorts of
different mechanisms to prevent that.

36
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.660
But we see the internet's so fragile,
it's a lot of different parts,

37
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.570
that if one gear breaks,
the whole thing breaks.

38
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.290
But anyway, sorry, that was a total
tangent, but yes, DNS, Domain Name System.

39
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.360
Internet phone book, that's all you
need to remember, internet phone book.

40
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.320
So now I know, 23.185.

41
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.728
Yeah, so now,
wwwjemyoung.com 23.23.185.61.

42
00:02:29.728 --> 00:02:30.396
I know.

43
00:02:30.396 --> 00:02:32.082
I am just beating this into you.

44
00:02:32.082 --> 00:02:34.413
I know, because this is the beginning,

45
00:02:34.413 --> 00:02:36.960
this is the intro on
how the Internet works.
