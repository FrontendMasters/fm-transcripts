WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.280
&gt;&gt; Jem: We're gonna buy a VPS now.

2
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.080
We're gonna buy your very own server
that you can know and love and

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.360
play with and destroy,
delete, do whatever you want.

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.929
So let's go to digitalocean.com,
&gt;&gt; Jem: Again I'm not sponsored by

5
00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:14.540
DigitalOcean.

6
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.080
I've just used a bunch of interfaces.

7
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.100
Theirs is the most friendly.

8
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.300
So, I'm gonna show you AWS for now, and
while we're not using [INAUDIBLE] So

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.280
this is DigitalOcean, so if I wanna create
a droplet which we will do in a second.

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.746
[SOUND] Look at this nice pretty user

11
00:00:33.746 --> 00:00:38.366
interface, this is good looking.

12
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:41.182
This is a good UI.

13
00:00:41.182 --> 00:00:43.560
Now this is an AWS.

14
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.130
Yes, this is why we're not using AWS,
it's very intimidating.

15
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.210
It's a very, very powerful system but
this is not user friendly at all.

16
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.220
So if I wanna make a server on AWS,
call it EC2 instance.

17
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.580
So I'll click on EC2,
I'll say, launch instance.

18
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.470
And then I have all these kind
of options to go through.

19
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.570
Yeah, we are not using AWS, this is why,
because it is very very powerful,

20
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.150
but with power comes-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We actually do have a course

21
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.950
that is coming out on node,
basically, full stag node or

22
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.110
whatever, production node,
I think is what the course will be called.

23
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.650
And it he, Kevin,
shows how to configure all this stuff.

24
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.490
How to use Elastic Beanstalk, so
that as he's using a Python script.

25
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.490
To hit it with tens of thousands of users.

26
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.780
And then it autoscales with
Elastic Beanstalk, the AWS [INAUDIBLE] So

27
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.490
I encourage you to check that out
if that's interesting to you.

28
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.800
Auto scaling and that kind of
stuff when that course comes out.

29
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:53.510
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yes.

30
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.890
Can they hear you?

31
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

32
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.480
&gt;&gt; Jem: Okay, perfect.

33
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.860
Yeah, there is a [INAUDIBLE]
course coming out.

34
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.180
And AWS is infinitely powerful.

35
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.449
You can literally build anything with AWS.

36
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.940
But for a beginner class,
we're definitely not gonna go there.

37
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.544
And back to DigitalOcean,
much, much easier.

38
00:02:18.544 --> 00:02:20.150
So we're gonna create a droplet now.

39
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.290
A droplet is DigitalOcean's
way of saying a VPS

40
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.720
just like on AWS it's
called an EC2 instance.

41
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.470
So they're equivalent.

42
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.850
So make sure we're using Ubuntu,
&gt;&gt; Jem: .10.

43
00:02:39.504 --> 00:02:45.010
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yes, let's make sure, okay?

44
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.920
This is really important that you're
using the correct version of Ubuntu.

45
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.780
If you're using the wrong version,
things will not work correctly.

46
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.420
Or they'll work differently than expected.

47
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.690
When we choose a size,
let's choose the smallest one.

48
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.500
So, this one is $5 a month.

49
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.430
Since everybody got a [LAUGH]
all those free credits, we,

50
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.070
you should be able to run your server for
two months without paying anything.

51
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.060
We're not going to add any block storage.

52
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.290
Pick a data center that is closest to you.

53
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.370
So if I was running a server for

54
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.560
my personal use I'd use San Francisco
cuz that's the closest to me.

55
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.400
It's gonna have the least
amount of latency.

56
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.600
But use a server that's the data
center is closest to you.

57
00:03:27.258 --> 00:03:33.843
&gt;&gt; Jem: Back to the version,
the version is 1610.

58
00:03:33.843 --> 00:03:37.614
So put it there.

59
00:03:37.614 --> 00:03:42.100
And silly question, why do we want the
data center closest to, like say you're

60
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.609
building a company, why do you want
the data centers closest to your users.

61
00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:52.200
Exactly, latency, so
if I make a server in Singapore it's

62
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.350
gonna take me forever cuz remember how we
used trace route to see all those hops?

63
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.160
There's gonna be a lot more
hops to get to my server.

64
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.120
And that costs expensive,

65
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.730
100 milliseconds matters in terms of
conversion rates for building a business.

66
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.240
So you always wanna choose
a datacenter that's close to you.

67
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.566
When you're more advanced we'll
actually make, not today but

68
00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:15.507
we can make a server on every single one
of these data centers so that no matter

69
00:04:15.507 --> 00:04:19.225
where you're at in the world you can
have a server that's close to you.

70
00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:21.720
So let's add an SH key.

71
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.055
I'll go back to the slide for this one.

72
00:04:28.103 --> 00:04:29.600
&gt;&gt; Jem: Data center.

73
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.530
So we're gonna add our SH key.

74
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.024
So, what you wanna do is,
back in your terminal,

75
00:04:38.514 --> 00:04:40.530
&gt;&gt; Jem: Just cat your SH key.

76
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.120
Cat is just a way of displaying a file.

77
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.390
And make sure it's your public key.

78
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.240
The one the ends in .pub.

79
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.775
So if use the my key nomenclature
it will be my key.pub this

80
00:04:50.775 --> 00:04:54.761
is confusing too you because
product keys don't have an ending.

81
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:56.133
So you're like, which one is it?

82
00:04:56.133 --> 00:04:57.317
Just remember .pub.

83
00:05:04.056 --> 00:05:05.210
&gt;&gt; Jem: There's a question.

84
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.170
If I'm in Singapore,
should I choose Singapore?

85
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.940
Yes.

86
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.860
Use the data centers closest to you.

87
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.224
It has the least amount of latency.

88
00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:18.685
&gt;&gt; Jem: Another question is what do
the numbers on the data centers mean.

89
00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:21.735
It's just arbitrary.

90
00:05:21.735 --> 00:05:28.955
So Amazon's main data center is in
Virginia and it's called US East.

91
00:05:28.955 --> 00:05:36.610
And the three main ones that Netflix use
are US West, US East, and U West, I think.

92
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.541
And the numbers are just arbitrary they
indicate which specific data center you're

93
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:44.043
at, you can pick one, two or three,
it doesn't matter in this instance.

94
00:05:47.365 --> 00:05:48.830
&gt;&gt; Jem: Okay, so-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Its

95
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.781
a different physical location so-
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yeah, exactly, exactly and

96
00:05:53.781 --> 00:06:00.138
it's helpful to know in case
say one day center goes out so

97
00:06:00.138 --> 00:06:05.049
your UCS1 goes out UCS2 is up and running.

98
00:06:05.049 --> 00:06:09.570
[LAUGH] These are for
all [INAUDIBLE] that's cracking me up.

99
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.760
Okay, so
I'm gonna just do this in my terminal.

100
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:23.420
So I'm gonna cats my_key2.pub.

101
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.710
Okay, so this is one instance where
I'm actually just gonna copy paste.

102
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.670
It wouldn't normally do this but
just copy that.

103
00:06:39.127 --> 00:06:43.680
&gt;&gt; Jem: And
just paste in your public key into that.

104
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.880
And again, the public key, I can share,

105
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.070
put this on Twitter, I can put this
on Facebook, it doesn't matter.

106
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.870
Public key doesn't get you anything?

107
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.450
So, feel free to share it around.

108
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.280
It won't, I don't know why you would.

109
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.800
But don't feel bad if you do.

110
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.920
And if you're ever looking for
a shortcut and you're trying to remember.

111
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.420
Is this my public key or private key?

112
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:10.349
The public key is significantly shorter
and smaller than the private key, yes?

113
00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:14.701
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So mine has my user account
at the name of my machine at the end of

114
00:07:14.701 --> 00:07:15.450
mine.

115
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.280
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Should I

116
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.010
leave that in there?

117
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:17.960
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yeah, leave that in there.

118
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.410
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Jem: Perfectly acceptable.

119
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.770
Just, for reference, this is what it
looks like when I cat my public key.

120
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.124
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If yours doesn't, does that-
&gt;&gt; Jem: It's fine, too.

121
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:30.680
&gt;&gt; Jem: Okay, so paste that in.

122
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.390
Give it a name that you'll remember.

123
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.060
So I'll just call this front end master.

124
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:39.560
Francois has a good tip.

125
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.580
If you are on a Mac,
you can use pbcopy and

126
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.030
that will copy things to your clipboard.

127
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:52.314
So I can say cats, think I have pbcopy in
and then I'll copy it to my clipboard.

128
00:07:57.789 --> 00:08:01.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a question about why
would one share his or her public key?

129
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.260
&gt;&gt; Jem: I don't know why you
would share your public key.

130
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:11.240
Actually, no,
if you say your friend made a server,

131
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.070
and you don't wanna share
your password out, obviously.

132
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:19.320
So you give him your public key and
only you can log in to that server.

133
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.875
It's a fairly useful authentication
method, but, great question.

134
00:08:25.144 --> 00:08:29.664
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Does DigitalOcean have a
limit on the public keys that you can add

135
00:08:29.664 --> 00:08:31.620
your account?

136
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.591
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You can just copy it.

137
00:08:33.591 --> 00:08:35.414
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: When we generated
a key on this computer,

138
00:08:35.414 --> 00:08:38.970
I've got another computer at home, and
maybe I'll just generate another key.

139
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.790
&gt;&gt; Jem: I've generated up to
about ten without any issues.

140
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:46.990
I'm sure there is an upper limit,
but I haven't hit it.

141
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.653
So probably like 50 or
so, I'm just guessing.

142
00:08:51.824 --> 00:08:53.944
&gt;&gt; Jem: Okay, so we add our SSH key.

143
00:08:58.647 --> 00:09:02.600
&gt;&gt; Jem: I'm gonna give,
everybody with me so far?

144
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.653
It's good, okay.

145
00:09:05.107 --> 00:09:06.465
&gt;&gt; Jem: Just gonna add that SSH key.

146
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:11.340
&gt;&gt; Jem: And
you can call it whatever you want.

147
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.320
Whoops.
Why Singapore?

148
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.510
Let's do San Francisco.

149
00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:14.362
There we go.

150
00:09:17.185 --> 00:09:17.841
&gt;&gt; Jem: And remember,

151
00:09:17.841 --> 00:09:20.671
naming your server is important
because you can only name it once.

152
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:22.630
So, give it a good name.

153
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.170
There's a good xkcd on naming a server.

154
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.880
Actually, no, I won't look it up.

155
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's
a good xkcd on everything.

156
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:30.700
&gt;&gt; Jem: Yeah.

157
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.230
But, give your server a good, meaningful
name because it will be with you for

158
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.020
the life of the server.

159
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.436
But it doesn't really matter,
you can name it whatever you want.

160
00:09:38.436 --> 00:09:43.180
Okay?
So we're all here, we've got our SSH key.

161
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:48.470
And we can create a Droplet now.

162
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:49.289
And it's creating.

163
00:10:06.341 --> 00:10:13.370
&gt;&gt; Jem: While it's creating, [LAUGH] Derek
asked what do you think about back ups?

164
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.380
I remember it being more difficult
to turn on than turn off.

165
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.710
You should absolutely
back up your machine.

166
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.540
I believe in DigitalOcean you can
just make a copy of the volume.

167
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.449
The volume is essentially a copy
of the hard disk for that image.

168
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.170
I do that regularly on my personal
machine about every, probably a week or

169
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.780
so, I just make the regular copy.

170
00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.980
Just because A, if you locked yourself out
of your server, you do something stupid or

171
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.080
someone breaks in, drops a virus.

172
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.400
Always have a backup,
backups are a hassle.

173
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.375
But you don't need them so you need them,
when you need them, you need them.

174
00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:45.701
[LAUGH] Thank you, Samir.

175
00:10:45.701 --> 00:10:51.100
[LAUGH] As any experienced engineer will
tell you, when you need it, you need it.

176
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:51.960
And if you don't have it,

177
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.640
you'll be like why didn't I just spend
the extra five minutes making a backup?

178
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So it's just a cron job
then that runs every week that you do?

179
00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:58.690
Or, how do you do it?

180
00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.700
&gt;&gt; Jem: So with AWS, I can set up a job.

181
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.930
Not a cron job, but
you can also do a cron job.

182
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.970
But I just set up a backup in
the AWS console, but great question.

183
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.880
So if we click in, we see there's no
data yet cuz there's nothing happening.

184
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.950
But what's important is you
have an IP address now.

185
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.670
This IP address is your
own personal server.

186
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:27.330
So if we just hit Copy and
hit Enter, nothing happens.

187
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.640
Because there's nothing running on your
server yet, it's just at empty blocks,

188
00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.200
is a blank slate.
