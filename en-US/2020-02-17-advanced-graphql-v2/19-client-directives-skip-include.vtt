00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.920
Sorry about client directors.

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.500
So let me think of a good situation here.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.590
So, okay, cool.

4
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.500
We can do the user.

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.070
We do the user.

6
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.198
So we got error.

7
00:00:09.198 --> 00:00:13.420
We got username.

8
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.450
You got created at all.

9
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.280
That's all that work.

10
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.800
I think that works.

11
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.850
Where is that coming from?

12
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.780
&gt;&gt; You overrode the error
handler at the core level it,

13
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.040
with your custom error on the server,
formatError.

14
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.720
&gt;&gt; Format, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.

15
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.732
Let's get rid of that.

16
00:00:41.905 --> 00:00:47.149
Cool, it can represent 32,
yeah, yeah, no, I'll say that's

17
00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.151
a string There you go.

18
00:00:56.728 --> 00:00:58.750
Okay, cool.

19
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.070
All right, so now we got a user.

20
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.990
So now we do some client
side directors here,

21
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.450
some couple client side
directors that come for free.

22
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.140
So I'll talk a little
bit about live queries.

23
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.350
You don't see that here.

24
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.230
But when that becomes available, you will
do something at live, what's really cool,

25
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.600
but you can look into that.

26
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.400
But the ones I wanna talk
about are skip and include.

27
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.950
I think those are really cool.

28
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.590
So in order to take advantage of that
we need to create an operation here.

29
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.920
I'm a Korean operation called query.

30
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.740
And I was gonna say for
get me gonna take in some arguments.

31
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.060
I'm just gonna call this argument.

32
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.780
Yes, and I'm gonna say it's a Boolean.

33
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.580
And it's required.

34
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.040
So I'm gonna do that.

35
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.250
And then we're gonna say is, I only want
to include the airfield if yes, it's true.

36
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.570
So I can say include, like this,
that takes an argument called if.

37
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.460
And you could take a variable like yes,
so I'm only gonna include this if Yes,

38
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.400
it's true that committed
to my query variables.

39
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.180
Open this up and argued for Yes,
I'm going to say it's false.

40
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.340
I'm going to run this and you see
errors is gone, because Yes, is false.

41
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.480
If Yes, it's true then errors there.

42
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.980
So, include is a really good one.

43
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.000
And then, skip is the opposite of include.

44
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.250
So, skip it if Yes is true.

45
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.870
And then don't skip it if Yes is false.

46
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.800
So is the inverse.

47
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.660
So, skip and
include are really good client directives.

48
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.830
I've talked about in other
GraphQL courses here,

49
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.760
a really cool library
called Lodash GraphQL.

50
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.980
This one looks really cool.

51
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.290
You literally can do Lodash queries and
your GraphQL.

52
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.900
So, I mean, it look pretty good GIF,
you can see that's insane.

53
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.275
So the possibilities are endless
of what you can do with stuff and

54
00:02:52.275 --> 00:02:55.680
GraphQL, you can get
lost in this real quick.

55
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.310
There's also another library of
some really helpful ones as well,

56
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.210
but I know that those are really cool.
