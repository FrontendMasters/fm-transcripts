WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.320
So let's do that.

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.910
We can make two directives or
we can make one directive.

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:08.720
I think I'll make two so

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.730
I can show you how you can use two
directives in combination with each other

5
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.100
on one field, cuz I think it will be
really cool, cuz I didn't talk about that.

6
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.710
So we'll make one for
authentication directive That

7
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.710
extends the schema direct the visitor I'm

8
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.165
just gonna copy that and make another one
down here for authorization directive.

9
00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:38.739
[SOUND] Okay, and we're going to
visit the field definition here.

10
00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.351
We're going to get the field for
authentication,

11
00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:46.220
we know the strategy is grab
the user from the context.

12
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.020
If the user is not there, throw an error.

13
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.740
That's what we did.

14
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.470
It's exactly what we're going to do.

15
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.925
So we're going to say,
resolver is going to equal

16
00:00:53.925 --> 00:00:59.360
field.resolve or
it's going to equal the default resolver.

17
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.110
And then we're going to say,

18
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.620
field.resolve = async function,
really get the route.

19
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.490
We don't really care about the args here.

20
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.350
We do care about the context though.

21
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.753
The content is what we're interested in,
we're interested in user, so I'm actually,

22
00:01:17.753 --> 00:01:20.102
I'm just gonna say just give me
context and then give me info.

23
00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:23.000
Cool.

24
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.080
So then I'm gonna do the same
thing I did an all file.

25
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.940
So I can go copy that actually,
I'm gonna all file and

26
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.460
I could literally just copy that,
we'll copy that.

27
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.250
Come back over here.

28
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.619
Spill, that.

29
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.540
And I can say if not context.user
throw authentication error.

30
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.810
Make sure I import that up top here.

31
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.310
There we go.

32
00:01:45.748 --> 00:01:48.690
So I'm just gonna throw an authentication
error instead of returning next.

33
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.659
I'm just going to return resolver.

34
00:01:53.846 --> 00:01:55.290
And that should be ctx.

35
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.630
And that should also be cx,

36
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.610
I following you that stream
is the exact same code

37
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.320
regardless get the role here,
role is going to be this arcs.

38
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.800
There we go.

39
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.660
So basically it's the same thing here.

40
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.110
So filled out, resolve If not context,
if context that user

41
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.949
role does not equal role than

42
00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:33.030
wrong role, right?

43
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.620
So you're not going to get in here and

44
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.230
then we're going to return the resolver,
cool.

45
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.028
And obviously the export these things,
cool.

46
00:02:42.357 --> 00:02:51.410
Authorization, authentication,
Awesome, and go back to our typedefs.

47
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.930
Let's do some directive things here.

48
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:05.447
directive, and
we'll say authentication Authorization.

49
00:03:10.372 --> 00:03:11.240
Cool.

50
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.841
And authentication doesn't take any
arguments, and it's on a field definition.

51
00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:25.780
Author of these others isn't does take an
argument takes a role which is type row.

52
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.330
And that's required.

53
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.800
And that's going to be
on a field definition.

54
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.870
&gt;&gt; You get a default?

55
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can get a default you can say
like I don't know, like me, like that.

56
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.399
Do you want to default admin or member,
whatever you want to do, but yeah,

57
00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:50.714
you can give to default.

58
00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:54.544
Cool.

59
00:03:54.544 --> 00:03:56.960
So we require that, that looks good.

60
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.550
We need to, add them on our index.

61
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.940
So we got the FormatDateDirective.

62
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.950
We also need the dedication directive and

63
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:16.165
the Authorization directive.

64
00:04:16.165 --> 00:04:19.024
We had to say authentication.

65
00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:23.252
Is the dedication and

66
00:04:23.252 --> 00:04:27.630
then authorization key.

67
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:36.850
There we go, authorization director.

68
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.190
Cool.
All that looks good.

69
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.930
Let's just make sure this didn't
break while we're moving along.

70
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.300
Cool guy looks good but nothing breaks.

71
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.620
And now you gotta do is just add them
wherever you want so these are field

72
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.610
definitions, so queries are types and
they have filter so you can add them here.

73
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.510
So if I wanted to get me,
I will had to say you need to be

74
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.150
authentication here, where's that one
worse you had to invite so if I invite,

75
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.820
you also had to be authentication and
you also have to be authorization.

76
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.650
I should rename those of us.

77
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.503
Those are not good names.

78
00:05:14.503 --> 00:05:18.480
Authentic kated and authorized.

79
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.105
That's a lot better.

80
00:05:19.105 --> 00:05:23.976
Let's do that.Dedicated and

81
00:05:23.976 --> 00:05:27.360
authorized, cool.

82
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.032
So yeah, you need to be, got put that out.

83
00:05:31.032 --> 00:05:32.910
Where did you go?

84
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.030
there we go so authenticated, like that.

85
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:44.067
And then down here you also
have to be authenticated and

86
00:05:44.067 --> 00:05:50.720
authorize and you can pass in a roll
here to be whatever you want.

87
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.976
So you can just put these
side by side like that.

88
00:05:57.446 --> 00:05:59.020
Pretty cool, right?

89
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.370
All right, so let's see,
unknown directive authentication,

90
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.560
where am I still using that?

91
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.882
&gt;&gt; Couple lines up, 94.

92
00:06:06.882 --> 00:06:08.584
&gt;&gt; I could have swore I change that.

93
00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:12.420
Cool, there we go.

94
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.640
Refresh this.

95
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.440
And now if I do the, and just to verify
if I go to my resolvers I'm pretty sure I

96
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.400
don't have any of those
authentication things on there.

97
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.350
Yeah, I don't, I have any any of those
wrappers that you might have had.

98
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.510
So if it errors out because it's
authentication is definitely direct us and

99
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:32.439
not the resolvers.

100
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.540
So if I say cool, let me get me.

101
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.840
Can ID, kind of property role of no role.

102
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.210
&gt;&gt; On the take off, the director has to
authorize instead of the authenticated.

103
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.150
&gt;&gt; This one right here.

104
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.410
Yeah, you are right,
it's already authenticated.

105
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:56.910
Thank you.

106
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.150
It's like, I don't know why it's looking
for a role there, that's strange.

107
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.960
Cool, not off.

108
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.400
So it totally works.

109
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.040
Let's do a sign up really quick
just to get a token going.

110
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.110
So I think I might already have one.

111
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.160
I don't Bet I got one
copied in here somewhere.

112
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.340
Come on.
There's one!

113
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.150
Look at there.

114
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.740
Let's copy that.

115
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.642
Let's pray that still works.

116
00:07:24.642 --> 00:07:29.340
[LAUGH]
I'll have to sign up again.

117
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.492
So authorization.

118
00:07:39.383 --> 00:07:40.370
It still works.

119
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.670
It gotta load.

120
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:42.510
It's good old JDLT.

121
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.510
So cool, that works.

122
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.450
And now if we try to do like
the invite one, [INAUDIBLE]

123
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.670
know that's I'm sure that's an admin so
I would definitely have to sign out.

124
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.772
So kind of [INAUDIBLE] this time.

125
00:07:51.772 --> 00:07:55.442
Mutation, Signup,

126
00:07:55.442 --> 00:08:01.478
auth SignupInput, like that.

127
00:08:01.478 --> 00:08:07.280
Signup, Input, auth, give it a token,

128
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.605
it's all I care about and,
like all thing here like the email,

129
00:08:12.605 --> 00:08:18.820
age.com and the password of

130
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:24.230
pass and a row of member.

131
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.180
Cool, so
we did that get back to this token here.

132
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.190
All right, and then we'll try and
do an invite here.

133
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.335
&gt;&gt; You missed an E on the front of it,
[COUGH]

134
00:08:32.335 --> 00:08:33.160
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

135
00:08:36.255 --> 00:08:41.131
I'll get that token there,
do a mutation here for

136
00:08:41.131 --> 00:08:46.835
an invite, which takes an input and
an email, whatever.

137
00:08:46.835 --> 00:08:54.890
And the role of Doesn't matter and
then we'll try to get this here.

138
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.890
And our QUERY VARIABLES are HTTP HEADERS.

139
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:07.286
Authorization and
our token here wrong role.

140
00:09:07.286 --> 00:09:08.800
So, works out pretty good.

141
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:16.170
Now, if I change this to this one or this
one would I'm assuming this is an admin.

142
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.950
I don't know, this and this very
well might not be an admin token.

143
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:19.730
I have no clue.

144
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:20.460
But let's find out.

145
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.300
Paste that in there.

146
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.330
Yeah, that works.

147
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.709
And that's how you do
authentication directives.

148
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.400
Pretty easily.
It's basically the same code we

149
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.090
already wrote.

150
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.620
And, you know, I'll leave up to you.

151
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.900
What do you think is cleaner?

152
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.570
Ryan stuff like this?

153
00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:38.840
Or wrapping all your resolvers?

154
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.240
I don't know.

155
00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.310
You tell me.

156
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.790
This is way cleaner.

157
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:43.990
Any questions?

158
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:47.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So this is at a field level, right?

159
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.100
So if I read a query that
doesn't include that field

160
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.940
does that mean I could still
get data from that query?

161
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.830
&gt;&gt; If you write a query that
doesn't include that, Phil?

162
00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.210
Well, I did.

163
00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:03.290
I placed these on the field on the query,
these are on queries and mutations.

164
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:07.424
&gt;&gt; So if I, offer me, got it, okay.

165
00:10:07.424 --> 00:10:10.480
That makes sense.

166
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so you should be good.

167
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.720
I mean, you can also put
them on fields on a tight.

168
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.230
&gt;&gt; This is what I did initially.

169
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:17.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah you can do that too.

170
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.510
Yeah, you could totally do that.

171
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:23.630
Like there's like, you know,
