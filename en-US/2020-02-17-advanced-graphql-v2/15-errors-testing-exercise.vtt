00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.200
Use Apollo error classes to handle errors.

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.340
So every where where we're throwing
errors, like this authentication helpers

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.570
and authorization helpers
you created earlier on.

4
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.240
Or anywhere else you're throwing errors,

5
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.910
use the built in Apollo
error classes instead.

6
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.485
So slap those out, and then I need you
to create some integration tests for

7
00:00:15.485 --> 00:00:16.755
your queries and mutations.

8
00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:18.820
Just try to create one for a query.

9
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.005
Try to create one more for
mutation and that should be fine.

10
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:23.265
Don't have to worry about all of them.

11
00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:25.755
I mean, you fill in like you
really want to write some tests.

12
00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:27.425
Go ahead and test them all out.

13
00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:29.595
But one for query and
one for mutation just so

14
00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:31.450
you can get a feel of it should be good.

15
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.580
And then I would say also just,
I know resolvers seem pretty trivial,

16
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.490
but also create a test for your resolver.

17
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.896
So I don't have an example of that because
it's pretty much the exact same thing

18
00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:42.433
as this.

19
00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:47.057
You will just need a test block or test
just doesn't matter which one you use, and

20
00:00:47.057 --> 00:00:50.462
then you might do something
like instead of snapshotting.

21
00:00:50.462 --> 00:00:54.948
You might do something results from

22
00:00:54.948 --> 00:00:59.733
a resolver to equal something else and

23
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:04.967
that's kinda how Matchers work in this,

24
00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:07.979
just so pretty simple.

25
00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.869
You just you don't need snapshots for
that.

26
00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.859
So just just pick a resolver that
you want maybe two or three,

27
00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:15.029
they should be pretty
simple to get those going.
