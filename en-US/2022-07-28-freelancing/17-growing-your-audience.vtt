1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.661
We should have, by this stage,
a small but growing mailing list.

2
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:11.308
That's the hope, and
don't despise those small beginnings

3
00:00:11.308 --> 00:00:15.519
when you've only got 50
people on your mailing list.

4
00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.306
That's a good start, you're doing well.

5
00:00:18.306 --> 00:00:21.861
And it does take time for
these mailing lists to grow,

6
00:00:21.861 --> 00:00:26.372
but they tend to grow exponentially
after a certain length of time.

7
00:00:26.372 --> 00:00:31.082
I remember from very long time, I felt
like I was stuck at a certain ceiling and

8
00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:36.390
then suddenly an event happened, something
happened, I can't even remember what.

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.000
And the growth started, and
things became much better over time.

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.727
So don't give up too early.

11
00:00:44.727 --> 00:00:48.190
I think the message there is I see
people giving up way too early on

12
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.704
this kind of thing, when they don't see
the results that they want straight away.

13
00:00:54.524 --> 00:00:58.575
So we've got our small core that we're
starting with, how do we grow from there?

14
00:00:58.575 --> 00:01:04.422
How do we maintain and look after,
nurture that audience over time.

15
00:01:04.422 --> 00:01:09.838
Well, a lot of this will come down to
the planning of our regular emails.

16
00:01:09.838 --> 00:01:15.977
So once we get past that email course
where people are on-boarded effectively,

17
00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:22.038
then you're beginning to get into the kind
of regular emails that you send out.

18
00:01:22.038 --> 00:01:27.422
Now, I think there's something that
I need to say at this point as well,

19
00:01:27.422 --> 00:01:31.762
that over time you may decide
to target multiple sectors.

20
00:01:31.762 --> 00:01:36.119
So you might initially have done
like no charities and whatever.

21
00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.898
And you went through and you did the
report and the survey and everything, and

22
00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.664
you got that up and running, you got
an email course for that up and running.

23
00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:45.311
And then you decide you wanna
target higher education.

24
00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:50.252
And that doesn't mean that you
get rid of the charities one.

25
00:01:50.252 --> 00:01:55.150
So you've got some people that will be
still coming in via that route, and

26
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.658
now you're gonna basically copy and
paste for a different sector.

27
00:01:59.658 --> 00:02:03.843
Now you probably can keep a lot of
the report, a lot of the emails,

28
00:02:03.843 --> 00:02:08.739
a lot of everything, and reuse it for
a different sector with some changes.

29
00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.879
But what this ultimately means is you've
got some people coming in from one

30
00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.518
sector and
some people coming in from another.

31
00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:19.076
They're going through two
separate email courses, and

32
00:02:19.076 --> 00:02:21.976
then they're merging
into one overall list.

33
00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:26.839
So, what that effectively means
is that our regular emails

34
00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:31.323
that go out are gonna have to
be not as sector specific.

35
00:02:31.323 --> 00:02:34.516
Unless we want to tag
users which we can do,

36
00:02:34.516 --> 00:02:40.465
based on which sector they've come from,
which campaign they've come from,

37
00:02:40.465 --> 00:02:44.936
and then do separately tailored emails for
each audience.

38
00:02:44.936 --> 00:02:49.040
Now personally,
I think in most cases that's overkill.

39
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.375
So on my own mailing list for example,
I know whether people come from

40
00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:57.413
a particular background, or
they work in a particular sector or

41
00:02:57.413 --> 00:03:00.282
whatever else based on
where they signed up.

42
00:03:00.282 --> 00:03:05.070
But most of the time they will get
the same email irrespective of what

43
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.529
sector they came from,
in terms of the regular ongoing email.

44
00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:13.646
Now, there are occasionally, I will
write a topic where I wanna say slightly

45
00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:17.779
different things to different audiences,
and that's fine, I can do that.

46
00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:22.948
But most of the time I wanna keep
the work level manageable and not have to

47
00:03:22.948 --> 00:03:28.133
write double or triple the number of
emails in any one particular week.

48
00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:32.828
So don't worry about overly worried about
that, think more about writing generic

49
00:03:32.828 --> 00:03:36.651
emails and we'll get into how to
write those emails in a minute, and

50
00:03:36.651 --> 00:03:38.813
how to go about organizing yourself.

51
00:03:38.813 --> 00:03:45.224
But before we do that, I wanna talk about
how your different channels fit together.

52
00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:49.764
Because you've got different
channels that you will be using.

53
00:03:49.764 --> 00:03:54.142
You've got email, you've got your blog
probably and you've got social, and

54
00:03:54.142 --> 00:03:58.075
the relationship between all of those
is quite important to get right.

55
00:03:58.075 --> 00:04:02.337
Because if you get those right then
they reinforce one another, and

56
00:04:02.337 --> 00:04:05.497
don't involve a lot of
extra work the whole time.

57
00:04:05.497 --> 00:04:08.353
So, let's look at the role of each.

58
00:04:08.353 --> 00:04:13.141
Social, the role of social is
to grab people's attention and

59
00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:16.272
encourage them to share your content and

60
00:04:16.272 --> 00:04:20.339
to drive traffic to a blog
post on a related subject.

61
00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.930
Normally speaking that's what they are.

62
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.770
Your blog has two roles.

63
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.356
First is to attract traffic
through SEO-targeted posts.

64
00:04:30.356 --> 00:04:36.433
So as I said before, if you can't
write guest posts for other people,

65
00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:42.420
you can write posts on your own site
that are targeted with their SEO.

66
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:48.952
But they should also drive people
to your landing page as well.

67
00:04:48.952 --> 00:04:54.109
So, social grabs our attention,
blog hopefully is a kind

68
00:04:54.109 --> 00:05:00.650
of intermedia to drive them to the landing
page that gets them on to email.

69
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.283
And once on your mailing list,
email will keep them front of mind,

70
00:05:05.283 --> 00:05:09.778
slowly building your credibility
until they're ready to buy.

71
00:05:09.778 --> 00:05:15.419
So that's their separate roles, but
you can do a lot of doubling up.

72
00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:16.853
So, for example,

73
00:05:16.853 --> 00:05:21.617
in my situation I released an email
this morning that went out.

74
00:05:21.617 --> 00:05:27.508
That email was also
replicated as a blog post.

75
00:05:27.508 --> 00:05:33.824
Same content, just I released it as
a blog post at the same time, okay?

76
00:05:33.824 --> 00:05:38.365
And I took bits out of that email and
used those to create

77
00:05:38.365 --> 00:05:43.402
the social media updates that
drove people to the blog post,

78
00:05:43.402 --> 00:05:46.687
that had a sign-up form for the email.

79
00:05:46.687 --> 00:05:47.681
You got me?

80
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:52.188
So that same email gets reused
three times in three places.

81
00:05:52.188 --> 00:05:57.270
Now actually, because I'm a sucker for
punishment or

82
00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.141
I don't know why,
I also do a video version of that.

83
00:06:02.141 --> 00:06:06.730
That video version appears in the blog
post and is posted to YouTube.

84
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.995
I then also extract the audio from
that and release it as a podcast.

85
00:06:11.995 --> 00:06:15.427
So from that one email,
I've got a blog post,

86
00:06:15.427 --> 00:06:19.213
social media updates,
video and podcast, okay?

87
00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:21.370
From one single email.

88
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.765
And that's what you're looking to do,

89
00:06:23.765 --> 00:06:28.211
to reach people in whatever channel
they're using with the same content.

90
00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:31.666
So let's look where all of
that starts with email, right?

91
00:06:31.666 --> 00:06:34.866
The email that you're gonna be
sending out every other week,

92
00:06:34.866 --> 00:06:36.780
every month, whatever you decide.

93
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.151
So what do you want to include
in those emails, right?

94
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:44.917
Well, the first thing to say is
they have to be personal, right?

95
00:06:44.917 --> 00:06:49.112
These emails mustn't read
like a marketing material.

96
00:06:49.112 --> 00:06:52.629
They need to be as if you
were talking to someone.

97
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:56.858
Well, the British answer to this is,
if you were talking to someone in a pub,

98
00:06:56.858 --> 00:06:59.982
in your case maybe a coffee shop,
but we won't quibble,

99
00:06:59.982 --> 00:07:01.892
whatever fits with your culture.

100
00:07:01.892 --> 00:07:05.613
But in an informal atmosphere,
you're just chatting over a subject and

101
00:07:05.613 --> 00:07:10.070
you're trying to keep it as informal, and
friendly and personal as you possibly can.

102
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.603
Like you would write
any other email really.

103
00:07:12.603 --> 00:07:16.527
The majority of emails that
we write to colleagues,

104
00:07:16.527 --> 00:07:21.536
they don't read like a marketing email and
neither should yours.

105
00:07:21.536 --> 00:07:25.725
What I find helps me,
is if I think of somebody I know and

106
00:07:25.725 --> 00:07:29.746
I actually write my emails for
that person, right?

107
00:07:29.746 --> 00:07:33.991
And I even start, Hi Sarah or
whatever, the beginning,

108
00:07:33.991 --> 00:07:38.945
just to get me in that mindset,
then I do have to remember to go up and

109
00:07:38.945 --> 00:07:41.344
remove their name afterwards.

110
00:07:41.344 --> 00:07:47.630
Otherwise that ends up getting published,
which did happen once, but anyway.

111
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.387
So they should be personal,
they should also be helpful.

112
00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:54.925
So every email should provide
value to the reader, right?

113
00:07:54.925 --> 00:07:57.601
So that could be in the form of advice,
but

114
00:07:57.601 --> 00:08:02.041
it might be just about demonstrating
empathy over their challenge.

115
00:08:02.041 --> 00:08:08.066
Some of my emails are nothing more than
me moaning about something, right?

116
00:08:08.066 --> 00:08:11.906
And not necessarily even giving
the answers to how to overcome that.

117
00:08:11.906 --> 00:08:17.039
But it's amazing how grateful people
are to receive an email that says

118
00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:22.090
effectively you're not alone,
I face those problems too, right?

119
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.187
So be helpful, be empathetic.

120
00:08:25.187 --> 00:08:27.864
And then the final thing is just even now,

121
00:08:27.864 --> 00:08:33.388
even all the way through this process that
we've got, you still don't need to sell.

122
00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:36.631
You don't need to mention your services,
you don't need to sell them.

123
00:08:36.631 --> 00:08:41.556
It's okay to say something like,
as I was preparing a workshop that I'll

124
00:08:41.556 --> 00:08:45.220
be giving on finding clients,
that's fine, right?

125
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:52.388
It occurred to me that, [SOUND] that's
about as sales-y as you get, right?

126
00:08:52.388 --> 00:08:55.553
Because, effectively the knowledge and

127
00:08:55.553 --> 00:09:00.536
expertise that you are sharing
will be you're selling, right?

128
00:09:00.536 --> 00:09:04.917
That's how you demonstrate
your expertise and knowledge.

129
00:09:04.917 --> 00:09:07.637
So that's what should be
included in emails, but

130
00:09:07.637 --> 00:09:12.106
there are some common mistakes that I see
people make with these kinds of ongoing,

131
00:09:12.106 --> 00:09:14.264
well, it applies to blogging as well.

132
00:09:14.264 --> 00:09:19.971
Anything, emails and your blog,
there things I see again and

133
00:09:19.971 --> 00:09:25.587
again, and it's why so
often these kinds of attempts fail.

134
00:09:25.587 --> 00:09:28.927
The first one is inconsistencies, right?

135
00:09:28.927 --> 00:09:29.819
So what do I mean by that?

136
00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:34.927
You got to decide on a release
schedule and then stick to it.

137
00:09:34.927 --> 00:09:41.231
The same time, the same day,
every single time, right?

138
00:09:41.231 --> 00:09:43.801
Set aside time to work on these emails.

139
00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:47.681
They matter as much as your
client work does, right?

140
00:09:47.681 --> 00:09:52.136
Building your own business is as
important as building other people's

141
00:09:52.136 --> 00:09:55.041
businesses in the services
that you provide.

142
00:09:55.041 --> 00:09:59.741
So you've really got to be incredibly
regimented about these things.

143
00:09:59.741 --> 00:10:03.445
People have got to come
to expect your emails.

144
00:10:03.445 --> 00:10:09.884
So I had some technical problems a few
weeks ago where my email didn't send out.

145
00:10:09.884 --> 00:10:13.847
And obviously I'd scheduled it and
presumed had gone out, and

146
00:10:13.847 --> 00:10:18.653
within an hour people started dropping
me emails going, you got a problem?

147
00:10:18.653 --> 00:10:21.675
I got your email this week, right?

148
00:10:21.675 --> 00:10:24.907
That's a really great sign.

149
00:10:24.907 --> 00:10:27.660
Secondly is infrequent, right?

150
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.251
Readers cannot be allowed
to forget about you,

151
00:10:30.251 --> 00:10:34.213
if you only email them a couple of
times a year they'll forget you exist.

152
00:10:34.213 --> 00:10:37.334
So I recommend at least once a month.

153
00:10:37.334 --> 00:10:41.899
And so, if you're in that mindset
of I'll send an email out when

154
00:10:41.899 --> 00:10:46.328
I've got a gap between client work,
you're gonna fail, right?

155
00:10:46.328 --> 00:10:47.456
Simple as that.

156
00:10:47.456 --> 00:10:52.835
Either, it's not gonna be regular enough
and so people are gonna forget about you,

157
00:10:52.835 --> 00:10:57.481
or you're gonna forget to do it, or
it's gonna be totally infrequent.

158
00:10:57.481 --> 00:11:01.311
So people aren't gonna expect your emails,
they're not gonna look forward to them or

159
00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:02.262
anything like that.

160
00:11:02.262 --> 00:11:06.520
And then the final mistake
I see is promotional again.

161
00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.250
I know I keep saying don't sell and
I really mean that.

162
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.856
Your advice is gonna
establish your expertise and

163
00:11:12.856 --> 00:11:17.086
the topics you write about will show your
readers the kind of services you offer.

164
00:11:17.086 --> 00:11:21.454
I don't need to say I provide
conversion rate optimization services,

165
00:11:21.454 --> 00:11:24.965
I just need to talk about
conversion rate optimization.
