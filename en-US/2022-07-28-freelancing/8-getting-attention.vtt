1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.626
Okay, so we have identified our audience,
we've worked out the sector

2
00:00:05.626 --> 00:00:11.050
that we want to speak to and
we've got all of their contact details.

3
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.409
Now how do we get their attention
without it becoming sleazy and

4
00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:19.780
awkward, and salesy and nasty?

5
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.390
Well, let's start by looking
at the strategy that I'm

6
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.345
proposing that we use, all right?

7
00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:32.299
The first thing to say is we
will not be selling at people,

8
00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:37.020
right, people can smell spam a mile away,
okay?

9
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.684
So the moment that we have in our heads,

10
00:00:39.684 --> 00:00:44.805
it'd be great if this turned into a lead,
or I'd love to work for these people.

11
00:00:44.805 --> 00:00:48.899
Or the minute it becomes
anything other than an honest,

12
00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.036
sincere interest in who they are,
what they do, how their job works,

13
00:00:54.036 --> 00:00:59.040
challenges they face, and
turns into a sales thing, forget it.

14
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.000
You will get nowhere.

15
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.561
And also, even if you did write them
a sales email, the chance of contacting

16
00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:12.030
them at the exact moment where they're
willing to buy is pretty unlikely.

17
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.680
However, what will we do?

18
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.640
Well, we will ask for their help, right?

19
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.776
Spam wants you to buy something or
do something.

20
00:01:21.776 --> 00:01:26.545
Spam doesn't seek your opinion, and
it doesn't want to hear from you, so

21
00:01:26.545 --> 00:01:30.785
instead, we're going to ask people
to share their experience and

22
00:01:30.785 --> 00:01:35.965
their wisdom, and we're gonna make people
feel valued and listened to, okay?

23
00:01:35.965 --> 00:01:40.485
And in return,
we're gonna provide value, right?

24
00:01:40.485 --> 00:01:44.770
We're going for for them,
sharing their experiences,

25
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.767
telling us their pain points,
their challenges, their goals for

26
00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:55.270
the insight that they're giving
us into the sector and their job.

27
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.730
We're gonna actually,
give them something back.

28
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.170
Okay, so
what does this look like in practice?

29
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.577
What are our deliverables here,
what are we going to be sending them,

30
00:02:06.577 --> 00:02:08.680
what we gonna be providing them?

31
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.744
Well first of all, we're probably,
and I say probably and

32
00:02:13.744 --> 00:02:17.930
you'll see why in a minute
gonna write the report.

33
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.675
So, in return for their feedback and
their involvement, and

34
00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:25.564
sharing their experiences with us,
in return for signing up for

35
00:02:25.564 --> 00:02:29.542
our emails, we're gonna provide
them with an industry report.

36
00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:34.803
That gives them insights into their sector
and the kind of challenges that other

37
00:02:34.803 --> 00:02:39.840
people face, and some advice and
best practice about how to deal with that.

38
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.290
That could be something different,
but we'll come to that in a minute.

39
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.230
Secondly, we're gonna offer to
give them a review of their site.

40
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.379
Right, so, and
this works may be more if you're involved

41
00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.794
in things like performance or
accessibility, or

42
00:02:58.794 --> 00:03:04.488
user interface stuff that can be
seen from the front end I guess.

43
00:03:04.488 --> 00:03:07.505
But we're going to say to them look,
thank you so

44
00:03:07.505 --> 00:03:12.570
much for giving up a little bit of your
time to share your experiences with us.

45
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.720
In return for that,

46
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.713
if you want us to do a quick first
impressions review of your website and

47
00:03:17.713 --> 00:03:22.860
return for your participation, then we
would happily do that as a thank you.

48
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.150
Alright, so we're about giving value.

49
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.860
And then third, we're going to be
offering them regular email advice.

50
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.915
So, we're going to provide
them with ongoing value and

51
00:03:32.915 --> 00:03:37.010
keep people engaged by sending them
regular advice via email, to help them

52
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.180
overcome the challenges that they've
shared with us and identify with us.

53
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.760
So how are we actually going
to engage with our audience,

54
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.450
what are the different touchpoints and
interactions that are going to go on here?

55
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.750
Well, first of all is going
to be an introduction.

56
00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.266
Now, we're just going to email people or
reach out to them on Linkedin.

57
00:04:00.266 --> 00:04:02.671
And we're going to introduce ourselves and

58
00:04:02.671 --> 00:04:06.441
explain that we're doing some
research into the sector, and we want

59
00:04:06.441 --> 00:04:10.734
to help overcome some of the challenges
in the sector, and that kind of thing.

60
00:04:10.734 --> 00:04:16.662
And we're gonna ask them whether
they would find that help useful,

61
00:04:16.662 --> 00:04:21.248
whether there are challenges
that we can help with.

62
00:04:21.248 --> 00:04:25.632
To be honest I'm not expecting you
to get a reply to that one, right,

63
00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:29.865
the aim is not to get a reply,
the aim is to say, hey, we're here,

64
00:04:29.865 --> 00:04:33.057
we're working on this,
right, and that's it.

65
00:04:33.057 --> 00:04:37.388
Then we're gonna follow up
afterwards with a survey, okay?

66
00:04:37.388 --> 00:04:42.116
And in the survey, we're gonna say, welI,
I said we wanted to understand the sector

67
00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:46.450
a little bit, so we've put together
a survey that's gonna help inform what we

68
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.365
produce for example,
the report that I mentioned.

69
00:04:49.365 --> 00:04:52.262
We'll offer that to give
them the report for

70
00:04:52.262 --> 00:04:56.725
free if they're willing to take
part in completing the survey, and

71
00:04:56.725 --> 00:05:02.157
we'll probably say we're willing to do
it that first impression review as well.

72
00:05:02.157 --> 00:05:06.030
And then the final time we're
gonna reach out to them, okay?

73
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:13.282
Because we don't want to abuse this
initial relationship is just to say,

74
00:05:13.282 --> 00:05:18.191
we've produced that report,
whatever it ends up being,

75
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:21.311
and they can go and check it out here.

76
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:24.814
They can get access to it,
and they can sign up for

77
00:05:24.814 --> 00:05:29.990
more email advice if they want to,
but they're not obliged to.

78
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.207
Okay, so those are the three touch points
as the only time we're going to contact

79
00:05:34.207 --> 00:05:36.750
people cold without their permission.

80
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.750
Okay, so this report I keep
banging on about what is it, and

81
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.654
why are we talking about doing it.

82
00:05:44.654 --> 00:05:49.189
The aim of the report is to
give them something of value,

83
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:53.436
in return for their interaction,
okay, return for

84
00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:58.220
acknowledging that you exist and
engaging with you.

85
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.310
And a report is often a really
good way of doing that.

86
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.220
It's not the only way and I'll touch
on other options in just a minute.

87
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.450
So this is your equivalent
of a lead magnet, right.

88
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.404
If you come and sign up to our emails,
you'll get this report,

89
00:06:14.404 --> 00:06:19.267
this thing of value, so
what you include in that report will be

90
00:06:19.267 --> 00:06:23.024
dependent on where your
expertise lies right?

91
00:06:23.024 --> 00:06:27.444
So if you're someone that specializes in
performance the report is obviously going

92
00:06:27.444 --> 00:06:29.747
to talk about performance related issues,

93
00:06:29.747 --> 00:06:34.229
if you're a data scientist it's going to
talk about data visualization issues, and

94
00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:37.984
that kind of stuff if you're a UX
designer, user experience and so on.

95
00:06:37.984 --> 00:06:42.682
Right, and it should also focus on
the kind of work within that area that you

96
00:06:42.682 --> 00:06:44.600
want to win more of.

97
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.504
So, if you work in user
experience design and

98
00:06:48.504 --> 00:06:53.849
you're frustrated that you
don't get to do enough testing,

99
00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:58.268
your report might be how
testing can help the higher

100
00:06:58.268 --> 00:07:02.714
education sector,
something like that, right?

101
00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:08.184
So, you're tying it back to the products
and services that you offer,

102
00:07:08.184 --> 00:07:13.745
and it's also can be really useful
way of drawing attention to different

103
00:07:13.745 --> 00:07:19.970
problems within a sector, and offering
solutions to a problem within a sector.

104
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.683
So for example,
if in your research you discover one of

105
00:07:24.683 --> 00:07:29.498
the biggest problems is that
there is not enough time and

106
00:07:29.498 --> 00:07:36.056
budget to enable proper usability
testing on a website within that sector,

107
00:07:36.056 --> 00:07:39.963
your report can focus on
how to get that time.

108
00:07:39.963 --> 00:07:42.690
Right, how to make that happen,
how to bring about that change.
