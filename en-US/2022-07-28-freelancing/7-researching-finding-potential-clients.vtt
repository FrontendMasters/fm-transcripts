1
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.400
Research your sector and pick a winner.

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.970
How do we do that, okay?

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.969
Now, I'm gonna be honest,
this is the most boring part, right?

4
00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.120
It involves Excel spreadsheets, okay?

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.208
This is not gonna be fun people,
but buckle in, we'll try and

6
00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:20.980
keep it to a minimum, and
this is worth doing, right?

7
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.290
I promise you this is worth doing.

8
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.620
We're going to basically create two lists,
okay?

9
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.060
So you've got a sector in your head
that you think is approximately right.

10
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.010
And we're going to give it a go or

11
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.780
maybe you've got three sectors
that you're not sure about.

12
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.067
So we could do this exercise for
all three, so for each of your sectors,

13
00:00:40.067 --> 00:00:41.790
you wanna create two lists.

14
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.420
The first list is influencers and
I want just to write individuals and

15
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.812
I don't like using the word influencers,
cuz it sounds so frigging pretentious.

16
00:00:49.812 --> 00:00:52.016
But I can't think of a better word.

17
00:00:52.016 --> 00:00:55.957
So individuals, events,
blogs, communities,

18
00:00:55.957 --> 00:01:01.480
membership organizations,
that last one is a doozy actually.

19
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.413
These membership organizations, cuz they
list all their members on their site, and

20
00:01:05.413 --> 00:01:09.080
that's invaluable for
kind of seeing who's in the sector.

21
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.210
So look for all of those online, right?

22
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.114
So you wanna collect a basically,
the name of all of these people and

23
00:01:16.114 --> 00:01:17.290
their URLs, okay?

24
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.767
Then you wanna create a separate list,
which is a list of perspective

25
00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:27.487
clients that you'd like to work with
within the sector, dream dreams.

26
00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:32.273
Who would you like to work with within
that particular sector and again,

27
00:01:32.273 --> 00:01:35.880
write a company name down,
URL down, easy peasy.

28
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.472
Just a quick reminder of what we want
to know about the sectors that we're

29
00:01:40.472 --> 00:01:41.580
considering.

30
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.592
We wanna know what conferences they do.

31
00:01:43.592 --> 00:01:46.859
Do they have small scale meetups?

32
00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.090
Do they have on and offline publications?

33
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.750
Are there mailing lists or forums?

34
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.640
Can you find any influences?

35
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.523
So as you're compiling the list,
bear all of that in mind, right?

36
00:01:59.523 --> 00:02:04.061
Now, once you've done that,
you now looking for

37
00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:08.716
some of the key players within the sector,
right?

38
00:02:08.716 --> 00:02:12.453
So those might be individuals, or
publications or that that kind of thing.

39
00:02:12.453 --> 00:02:16.665
So how do you find that that
influencer list, if that makes sense.

40
00:02:16.665 --> 00:02:20.029
Well, I mean, obviously,
you can just Google it, but

41
00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:24.196
also talk to any contacts you've
got in the sector already, right?

42
00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:28.570
If you've got existing clients in
the sector, talk to them, right?

43
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.757
Ask what publications they read,
what events they attend and

44
00:02:31.757 --> 00:02:34.470
what communities they participate in.

45
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.970
So that will help start off
your influencer list, right?

46
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.320
Then you can turn to search, right?

47
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.726
Search for your sector combined with
words like conference meetup, members,

48
00:02:46.726 --> 00:02:50.230
organizations, blogs,
that kind of thing, right?

49
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.156
So you might go, I don't know university
conferences, university blogs,

50
00:02:55.156 --> 00:02:56.460
that kind of thing.

51
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.190
Also, when you do those searches
pay attention to who's advertising

52
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.278
on that those keywords, because those
are people that have got money.

53
00:03:10.278 --> 00:03:13.680
And so add them to your list as well,
right?

54
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.047
Another technique, now, this is somebody
asked about LinkedIn earlier and

55
00:03:19.047 --> 00:03:20.430
how I use LinkedIn.

56
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.190
One of my favorite ways of using
LinkedIn as a research tool, right?

57
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.727
Everybody seems to focus on I'm
going to spam LinkedIn with

58
00:03:29.727 --> 00:03:32.547
social media updates and whatever.

59
00:03:32.547 --> 00:03:36.903
Okay, fair enough, there is a place for
that, I'm not, dismissing that and

60
00:03:36.903 --> 00:03:39.410
we'll actually come on to that later.

61
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.036
But actually,
it's more valuable as a research tool

62
00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:47.965
to actually search on the sector that
you're after and see who comes up.

63
00:03:47.965 --> 00:03:50.890
What people come up.

64
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.404
So I use social a lot, not just LinkedIn,
either Twitter to find influencers,

65
00:03:56.404 --> 00:04:00.770
companies, membership organizations,
and other groups and

66
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.580
sector, social can be really,
really good for that.

67
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.050
Okay, so that's how you find your
influencers and fill out that list.

68
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.505
Then you've got to find some
prospective clients that maybe you'd

69
00:04:12.505 --> 00:04:13.420
like to work with.

70
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.178
So I would aim to identify about 30 to
50 specific organizations that you'd

71
00:04:18.178 --> 00:04:20.550
like to work with within the sector.

72
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.364
So it doesn't need to
be an enormous number,

73
00:04:22.364 --> 00:04:24.160
but it needs to be a significant number.

74
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.100
Start with companies you already know, and
like and would really like to work with.

75
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.085
So there might be, let's say you were
targeting environmental charities.

76
00:04:35.085 --> 00:04:38.040
You might really wanna
work with Greenpeace,

77
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.397
great, put them down, no problem.

78
00:04:40.397 --> 00:04:45.130
Then I would suggest you add any
recommendations for personal contacts.

79
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.871
So if you've got somebody
already within the sector,

80
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:54.251
ask him who else is worth working with or
worth reaching out to, inclued them.

81
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:57.370
And any connections you've
already got on LinkedIn,

82
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.252
it's surprising what like not
maybe direct contacts you've got.

83
00:05:01.252 --> 00:05:06.066
But second or third degree contacts
to various companies within

84
00:05:06.066 --> 00:05:09.997
the sector you're after,
great, include those.

85
00:05:09.997 --> 00:05:12.321
And then turn to Google search for

86
00:05:12.321 --> 00:05:16.640
the rest to bulk out the rest of the list,
right?

87
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.440
So what we've ended up with then
just to recap is our two lists.

88
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:28.363
Each list has got company name, or
blog name, or influence and a URL, okay?

89
00:05:28.363 --> 00:05:34.690
So influences list, client list,
that's not enough in itself, right?

90
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.611
We need to be able to identify
the initial contact point,

91
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:42.790
who are we going to reach out
to within these organizations?

92
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.321
Right, you've got your two lists, but

93
00:05:45.321 --> 00:05:50.100
we need specific people we can contact
within these organizations, okay?

94
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.527
So you can make an educated guess about
the role of the person that you want

95
00:05:56.527 --> 00:06:00.360
to contact based on what
services you offer, right?

96
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.934
So in my case, I'm looking for
customer service director,

97
00:06:05.934 --> 00:06:13.140
marketing director, head of digital,
people like that, right?

98
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.710
If you're more development focused,
it might be the head of IT.

99
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:24.640
It might be head of analytics, or data
management or that kind of thing, right?

100
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.316
So ideally, we want to kind of
connect with a very specific person

101
00:06:30.316 --> 00:06:37.140
in the company rather than just using
their generic contact address, right?

102
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.287
Because that will go through to some
kind of customer service team and

103
00:06:40.287 --> 00:06:43.560
that's not really gonna help us very much,
we need a specific person.

104
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.208
So we need to identify the role
that that of that person and

105
00:06:47.208 --> 00:06:50.104
we need to make an educated
guess about that.

106
00:06:50.104 --> 00:06:53.507
Now, the role will be
very much dependent upon

107
00:06:53.507 --> 00:06:58.496
the organization sallies as well as,
who you're trying to reach.

108
00:06:58.496 --> 00:07:01.202
So their size or
structure in their sector.

109
00:07:01.202 --> 00:07:05.950
So for example, in smaller companies,
you might go for the founder, right?

110
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.947
Cuz that's gonna be the key
decision maker in most places.

111
00:07:09.947 --> 00:07:12.387
If it's a single product company,

112
00:07:12.387 --> 00:07:16.614
then if you offer design any kind
of services or web services,

113
00:07:16.614 --> 00:07:22.270
you're probably gonna want to talk to
a digital lead or head of marketing.

114
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.819
If it's more developing services,
probably gonna be the head of IT or

115
00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:28.913
like I said, data management.

116
00:07:28.913 --> 00:07:34.164
Now, for multiple product companies,
it gets a lot more complicated, right?

117
00:07:34.164 --> 00:07:39.674
So if you're trying to target Nestle
that you've got like dozens and

118
00:07:39.674 --> 00:07:41.480
dozens of companies.

119
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:47.270
You're gonna need to pick particular brand
names that you go for and do it that way.

120
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.687
I would avoid that to begin with
until you get a bit slicker at this,

121
00:07:50.687 --> 00:07:53.490
because it turns into a nightmare.

122
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.669
If you don't know what you're doing.

123
00:07:56.669 --> 00:07:59.980
So we kind of got a roll,
we got the company.

124
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.340
Now, we find the right name,
we've got to find a person here.

125
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.070
Well, once again,
that's where LinkedIn comes in, right?

126
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.920
Once we know the role of the person
that we wanna contact and

127
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.700
we've got their company information,
it's as simple as a LinkedIn search.

128
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.836
Most of the time that will
get you where you need to be.

129
00:08:21.836 --> 00:08:25.751
Alternatively, you can search
on the company website.

130
00:08:25.751 --> 00:08:31.176
They often list senior members of
management on their website or

131
00:08:31.176 --> 00:08:32.990
via Google, right?

132
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.938
So you search head of marketing, or

133
00:08:35.938 --> 00:08:39.872
director of marketing,
or marketing leads and

134
00:08:39.872 --> 00:08:46.360
different combinations till you get
to the kind of person you're after.

135
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.854
If you can't find a name, that's okay,

136
00:08:48.854 --> 00:08:52.433
reach out to somebody within
the same company and ask them.

137
00:08:52.433 --> 00:08:55.255
I'm trying to work out who
the head of marketing is.

138
00:08:55.255 --> 00:08:58.678
It's surprising how helpful
people are as long as you say,

139
00:08:58.678 --> 00:09:01.359
I'm trying to contact
the head of marketing.

140
00:09:01.359 --> 00:09:05.023
Because I'm running a research project,
you don't say,

141
00:09:05.023 --> 00:09:08.280
because I want to sell some shit, right?

142
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:14.040
And, of course, then you can't sell stuff,
you do need to be honest about it.

143
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.280
Failing that, try emailing the catch
all email address and asking them.

144
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.162
So most companies will have
a inquiries at whatever.

145
00:09:22.162 --> 00:09:24.359
You can drop them an email, although,

146
00:09:24.359 --> 00:09:29.300
they tend to be pretty more cautious about
handing out people's contact information.

147
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.342
Alternatively, just give up and
try another role or another company,

148
00:09:35.342 --> 00:09:38.670
don't beat yourself up over,
it's not really worth it.

149
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.480
So we're getting there now.

150
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.388
We've identified our companies or
our influences,

151
00:09:43.388 --> 00:09:45.980
cuz this approach applies to both.

152
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.781
We've identified the role that we
wanna reach out to in each case.

153
00:09:49.781 --> 00:09:56.246
I found the name of the person, so now,
it comes to actually contacting them.

154
00:09:56.246 --> 00:10:00.812
And so we wanna contact of their email,
how do we get their email address?

155
00:10:00.812 --> 00:10:07.480
Okay, there's a couple of ways, right?

156
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.251
You could make a guess of their email
address, by looking at email address of

157
00:10:12.251 --> 00:10:16.700
anybody else in the company and
extrapolating it, right?

158
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:22.622
It's really, really simple, because if
it's formatted first name dot last name,

159
00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:26.580
then you're good to go,
you could even validate that.

160
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.978
There's a tool called Email hippo,
there'll be a link in the slides to that,

161
00:10:30.978 --> 00:10:32.711
where you can actually go in and

162
00:10:32.711 --> 00:10:36.600
validate that it's real email
address which is great.

163
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.559
The tool the way that I only do
it is slightly different to say,

164
00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:42.300
cuz it saves me time.

165
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.084
I use a page tool,
I got it for a one off payment,

166
00:10:46.084 --> 00:10:50.266
I think of $35 and
some deal that they were doing.

167
00:10:50.266 --> 00:10:55.127
Where you can look up, it kind of
looks up email addresses for you and

168
00:10:55.127 --> 00:10:57.200
works out what they are.

169
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:04.420
It's called findthatlead.com, that said,
increasingly, I'm just using LinkedIn.

170
00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.090
Instead of using email, I reach out
to people via LinkedIn instead.

171
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.230
Now, you will have to sign up for
their kind of paid service to do that.

172
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:20.094
Because LinkedIn, unless, you've got
already a contact with the person,

173
00:11:20.094 --> 00:11:24.260
they don't let you send
a direct message to them.

174
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:29.649
Although, sometimes I've just
sent a connection request and

175
00:11:29.649 --> 00:11:32.401
put in the connection request.

176
00:11:32.401 --> 00:11:37.890
I'm working on a research piece and I'd
love your feedback, and see what happens.

177
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.483
So you don't necessarily, and
LinkedIn is just a great way.

178
00:11:41.483 --> 00:11:44.992
I find people very
approachable over LinkedIn,

179
00:11:44.992 --> 00:11:48.682
almost better than email
in some cases these days.

180
00:11:48.682 --> 00:11:51.069
So there's a little bit about
defining your audience and

181
00:11:51.069 --> 00:11:52.770
how we're gonna contact the audience.

182
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:57.214
I'm gonna talk you through the specifics
of contacting them in a minute.

183
00:11:57.214 --> 00:12:01.098
But that kind of gives you
the how we get the list part.

184
00:12:01.098 --> 00:12:02.982
So let's just recap that, and

185
00:12:02.982 --> 00:12:06.536
then we'll do any questions
about that before we move on.

186
00:12:06.536 --> 00:12:09.656
So you got research sector,
you're looking for

187
00:12:09.656 --> 00:12:13.395
a sector which has got cultural
sharing and interaction.

188
00:12:14.485 --> 00:12:17.983
You wanna create a list of companies
that you'd like to work for and

189
00:12:17.983 --> 00:12:20.442
influences within that sector.

190
00:12:20.442 --> 00:12:25.419
Then you wanna identify the role within
the organization that you should be

191
00:12:25.419 --> 00:12:27.272
contacting.

192
00:12:27.272 --> 00:12:33.254
Find the name of the person with that role
via LinkedIn, via Google search, etc.

193
00:12:33.254 --> 00:12:37.629
And find their email address or LinkedIn
profile, and contact them that way.

194
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.106
So at the end of all that,
you're gonna end up with

195
00:12:43.106 --> 00:12:47.791
a spreadsheet with company name,
company URL, role,

196
00:12:47.791 --> 00:12:52.595
person's name, person's email or
LinkedIn profile.

197
00:12:53.685 --> 00:12:57.345
That's the boring bit done,
any questions about that?

198
00:12:57.345 --> 00:13:02.555
Incredibly painful and boring, and
process that you've got to go through.

199
00:13:02.555 --> 00:13:06.951
By the way you only have to do
that probably every three years.

200
00:13:06.951 --> 00:13:10.842
So [LAUGH] it's not
gonna be an ongoing one.

201
00:13:10.842 --> 00:13:13.602
Anything from the chat room or
from you guys?

202
00:13:13.602 --> 00:13:21.008
&gt;&gt; Do you use any other paid services that
help you with the lead like databases or?

203
00:13:21.008 --> 00:13:25.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are many paid services
that help with a lot of this stuff, but

204
00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.270
to be honest, I don't like a lot of them.

205
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.641
A lot of them are really designed about,
okay,

206
00:13:31.641 --> 00:13:36.810
we're gonna harvest a load of
email addresses and spam them.

207
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:41.732
So they're not designed for
this very targeted approach of these

208
00:13:41.732 --> 00:13:46.488
specific individuals I wanna
reach out to on a personal basis.

209
00:13:46.488 --> 00:13:51.443
And I feel that considering the kind
of services we offer in the way that we

210
00:13:51.443 --> 00:13:54.378
operate and the level in which we operate.

211
00:13:54.378 --> 00:13:59.410
That kind of, it doesn't work in any
way I think is yucky and horrible.

212
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:00.850
So no.

213
00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.380
&gt;&gt; And those conferences that you go to.

214
00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

215
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.628
&gt;&gt; Okay, so your plan is to be
a speaker not to get a booth, that's.

216
00:14:07.628 --> 00:14:14.456
&gt;&gt; It's not off the table a booth,
I don't favor that.

217
00:14:14.456 --> 00:14:22.000
Because I'm tight, I don't like paying
money, if I can be somewhere for free.

218
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.153
But at the moment,

219
00:14:23.153 --> 00:14:27.639
you almost don't need to worry about
is web where we're in this process.

220
00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:30.890
You're not even necessarily thinking
about I'm gonna attend these events, or

221
00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.750
speak at them or doing a booth,
we just need to know what they are.

222
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.500
&gt;&gt; Just go to them and
get information and-

223
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.004
&gt;&gt; Get, all we need at the moment, yeah.

224
00:14:37.004 --> 00:14:37.760
&gt;&gt; Find the leads.

225
00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.468
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're very early stage,

226
00:14:39.468 --> 00:14:43.630
we can worry about that when we get to the
grow your list bit which will be later on.
