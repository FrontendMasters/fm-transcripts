1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.570
So for example, I'm a UX consultant,

2
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.419
I enjoy doing conversion
rate optimization work.

3
00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:09.544
And yet I'm frustrated that most
organizations launch their website and

4
00:00:09.544 --> 00:00:12.230
then basically abandon them, right?

5
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.370
So, my report therefore might focus
on the fact that websites need post

6
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.167
launch optimization, okay?

7
00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:26.276
So the report is basically
doing various roles here,

8
00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:31.281
one is giving us a reason
to reach out to people.

9
00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:36.709
Two it's offering them an incentive
to sign up to our mailing list,

10
00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:39.960
three is demonstrating our expertise.

11
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.272
And four, it's focusing them on
issues that we can help with, right?

12
00:00:45.272 --> 00:00:48.078
So it's a really valuable tool.

13
00:00:48.078 --> 00:00:55.367
That said, you don't necessarily
need it to be a report, okay?

14
00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:58.803
Because I know that not
everybody likes writing, and

15
00:00:58.803 --> 00:01:03.628
to some extent there's no getting away
from that in the kind of thing we do.

16
00:01:03.628 --> 00:01:07.788
But it could be something else,
if you're a developer,

17
00:01:07.788 --> 00:01:12.740
it might be an app, a tool,
a code library, a Wordpress template.

18
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.131
It could be anything like that,

19
00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:19.038
that essentially you can
give away as an incentive.

20
00:01:19.038 --> 00:01:22.150
Yeah go for it, that sounds like
this question is in chat room.

21
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.176
&gt;&gt; Do you ever do research and
community experience to forums, and

22
00:01:28.176 --> 00:01:31.696
other communities to
come up with these ideas?

23
00:01:31.696 --> 00:01:32.648
&gt;&gt; Absolute.

24
00:01:32.648 --> 00:01:33.252
&gt;&gt; Writing reports.

25
00:01:33.252 --> 00:01:38.696
&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely, that is going to
be a part of what we're gonna cover.

26
00:01:38.696 --> 00:01:43.454
So before we do the report,
we're gonna reach out to people,

27
00:01:43.454 --> 00:01:47.830
to find out what the report
should be about, right?

28
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.640
Or before we create a tool,
we're gonna reach out and

29
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.400
find out what kinda tool would be useful.

30
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.152
And we do that by contacting the people or
the list of companies,

31
00:01:58.152 --> 00:02:00.880
and the list of influences, right?

32
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.532
And some of those influences
will be forums, right?

33
00:02:04.532 --> 00:02:07.940
Or blogs or places like that, okay?

34
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.190
So absolutely, yes.

35
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.832
The first communication,

36
00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:17.360
if you remember I listed the different
communications, if I can find that.

37
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.080
Yeah, is the introduction
which is when we say, hey,

38
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.740
we're gonna do something in this area.

39
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.754
We're gonna, we wanna help people in
this area if you've got any ideas,

40
00:02:26.754 --> 00:02:28.904
that's the equivalent of doing that.

41
00:02:28.904 --> 00:02:34.070
Then we've got the survey where we get
into the specifics of it, then we get

42
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.236
the output of it, whether it be the report
or it be the app or whatever else.

43
00:02:39.236 --> 00:02:43.563
The only advantage that report has
really over those other options,

44
00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:46.180
is because it contains written content.

45
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.611
We can actually reuse that content
in lots of different ways later on,

46
00:02:51.611 --> 00:02:55.211
so that's why I tend to
lean towards a report.

47
00:02:55.211 --> 00:03:00.189
But I fully recognize that writing
a report sounds really intimidating,

48
00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:04.040
I promise you I'm gonna talk
you through how to do it, and

49
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.058
it's not as bad as it sounds.

50
00:03:06.058 --> 00:03:12.120
But it's not insignificant amount of work,
right?

51
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.750
And that it's worth saying that at this
point, that setting this up, right?

52
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.892
So going from now to
creating your give away,

53
00:03:21.892 --> 00:03:27.342
to setting up the initial emails
that are gonna be sent out,

54
00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:31.491
and landing pages and
various other things.

55
00:03:31.491 --> 00:03:34.209
This is all your upfront work, right?

56
00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.379
Once you're over that hump
of doing that upfront work,

57
00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.460
it gets really easy after that.

58
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.144
So my advice is,
if you're a freelancer or agency,

59
00:03:46.144 --> 00:03:49.346
find a slow time in your
year to do this chunk.

60
00:03:49.346 --> 00:03:52.637
Because there's usually certain periods
where you know, it's slower than others.

61
00:03:52.637 --> 00:03:56.895
So do this upfront in that, and then all
you've got to do is maintain it over time,

62
00:03:56.895 --> 00:03:59.370
which is really, really lightweight.

63
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.573
So I'm very conscious that this
sounds like quite a lot of work, but

64
00:04:03.573 --> 00:04:08.510
it only needs to be done once and then you
can live off of it for two, three years,

65
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.062
right?

66
00:04:09.062 --> 00:04:11.027
So yeah, doesn't need to be a report,

67
00:04:11.027 --> 00:04:13.717
but ideally I think a report
is probably the way to go.

68
00:04:13.717 --> 00:04:16.930
So we got to make our initial contact,
we're gonna reach out.

69
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.280
Now I am really going to
handhold you through this, okay?

70
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.258
I want it to be as simple for
you to do as possible,

71
00:04:24.258 --> 00:04:29.190
to the point where I've written
the emails for you to send out, right?

72
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.095
And I'm gonna run through them, now I say
emails it could be a LinkedIn message,

73
00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:35.740
doesn't really matter, same principle.

74
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.496
But I'm gonna go through
it in enormous detail,

75
00:04:38.496 --> 00:04:41.531
because the devil is in
the detail with these things.

76
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:44.375
The later ones I won't go
through in as much detail,

77
00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:47.221
because you'll have began
to get the idea then, but

78
00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:51.320
this first one is really important,
so there's your email, right?

79
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.955
I don't expect you to be able to
read it on screen, don't worry,

80
00:04:54.955 --> 00:04:58.787
you can have it download this slide
deck afterwards, you can copy and

81
00:04:58.787 --> 00:05:01.250
paste the wording, you're all good to go.

82
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.884
But I wanna explain what I'm doing in
this email, because it's important.

83
00:05:05.884 --> 00:05:10.229
So you've got to do everything you can to
prevent it looking like a marketing email.

84
00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.889
So send it from your
personal email address or

85
00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.164
from a personal LinkedIn account,
don't send it from a corporate one.

86
00:05:17.164 --> 00:05:21.448
Keep it plain text if it's email,
avoid using links,

87
00:05:21.448 --> 00:05:27.980
anything that gives the impression that
it might be a marketing email, all right?

88
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.930
Secondly, if it's an email, make sure
that the subject matter makes it clear

89
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.956
you're not selling something, and
it's not some kind of typical spam email.

90
00:05:37.956 --> 00:05:42.557
So I've written the subject here,
can I ask for your advice,

91
00:05:42.557 --> 00:05:46.260
because you'd never get
that in a spam email.

92
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.946
Next we wanna personalize it, so

93
00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:51.150
we wanna assure the email is
personalized as much as possible.

94
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.105
So we want it actually to
have the person's full name,

95
00:05:54.105 --> 00:05:58.235
that shows that it's not just being
sent to a generic mailing list, right?

96
00:05:58.235 --> 00:06:04.518
And we also want it to use the person's
name in the introduction, right?

97
00:06:04.518 --> 00:06:09.613
You wanna acknowledge that email is
solicited, you wanna make people

98
00:06:09.613 --> 00:06:14.638
feel appreciated, by suggesting
that they've been recommended.

99
00:06:14.638 --> 00:06:19.698
Now they might not have been recommended
in which case don't lie, but

100
00:06:19.698 --> 00:06:24.955
say what you can to say, we really
think that you could offer value here.

101
00:06:24.955 --> 00:06:28.707
So what I've written is sorry for
emailing you out of the blue, but

102
00:06:28.707 --> 00:06:32.739
it's been suggested you might be
the ideal person to contact, right?

103
00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:36.465
So keep it short but relevant to
your audience, so in this case,

104
00:06:36.465 --> 00:06:37.848
charity fundraising.

105
00:06:37.848 --> 00:06:42.116
So I've written, my name is Paul Boag,
I'm a user experience consultant,

106
00:06:42.116 --> 00:06:45.795
we're running a user experience
consultancy called Boagworks,

107
00:06:45.795 --> 00:06:48.780
who specialize in charity fundraising,
right?

108
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.770
Because I'm aiming at charity fundraising.

109
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.568
Now, that might not be the best line
actually, you kinda need to make

110
00:06:56.568 --> 00:07:02.690
a judgement in a situation that might
immediately come across as salesy.

111
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.696
In which case you might wanna just say,
my name is Paul Boag,

112
00:07:06.696 --> 00:07:10.246
I'm doing some research
into charity fundraising.

113
00:07:10.246 --> 00:07:17.054
You need to make a judgement,
this kind of thing is not black and white.

114
00:07:17.054 --> 00:07:20.197
Flattery, never hurts in emails like this,
and so

115
00:07:20.197 --> 00:07:25.314
I've written the reason I'm writing is
that alongside experts, such as yourself

116
00:07:25.314 --> 00:07:29.866
in the field I'm preparing a report
on the state of digital fundraising.

117
00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:35.084
So I've called them an expert,
I've implied that they've associated

118
00:07:35.084 --> 00:07:39.711
with other experts, and
I've made it clear why I'm emailing.

119
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:44.473
Howard before I undertake such formal
research, I wanna ensure that the scope of

120
00:07:44.473 --> 00:07:47.638
this report is as relevant
to provide maximum value.

121
00:07:47.638 --> 00:07:51.161
So make it clear why you're
asking them for their advice.

122
00:07:51.161 --> 00:07:56.022
And then highlight the most important bit,
which is I would appreciate any insights

123
00:07:56.022 --> 00:08:00.720
you have into what areas of research,
would provide particularly useful.

124
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.630
For example, I was considering focusing
on the level of user research,

125
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:09.150
and testing that's being done within
the sector, would that be relevant?

126
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.670
There are other areas I
should be looking at.

127
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:15.964
So highlight what you're specifically
asking, then give them an example, so

128
00:08:15.964 --> 00:08:20.780
that they've got some kind of sense
of what response they should give.

129
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:24.320
I appreciate you're hugely busy and
don't know me, however, even a line or

130
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.850
to pointing me in the right direction
would be hugely beneficial.

131
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.565
You're only asking for a line or two,
not too much, thanks for your time and

132
00:08:31.565 --> 00:08:32.920
consideration.

133
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:38.975
So basically it's very,
very low key, you're not selling,

134
00:08:38.975 --> 00:08:45.480
you're not pushing,
you're just looking to learn from them.

135
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:51.470
But as I said, you're not gonna get many
replies to that, that's fine, right?

136
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.790
This stage is not about replies,
it's about introducing yourself.

137
00:08:54.790 --> 00:09:00.376
However, if somebody does reply,
make sure you respond to them and

138
00:09:00.376 --> 00:09:03.320
you thank them for their comments.

139
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:08.182
And reference, when you reply to them,
make sure you reference

140
00:09:08.182 --> 00:09:13.059
the comments they made, so
it doesn't read like an auto reply.

141
00:09:13.059 --> 00:09:17.958
Actually make it say, Dave, thanks so
much for taking the time to reply,

142
00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:22.560
what you said about was really useful,
try and make a connection.

143
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.501
Cuz you gotta remember, only one of these,

144
00:09:26.501 --> 00:09:31.933
if one of these you kick off
a meaningful conversation with,

145
00:09:31.933 --> 00:09:35.999
that could be six months
worth of work [LAUGH].

146
00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:39.961
So based on the feedback you get,
you'll actually refine the report or

147
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:43.736
the free thing you give away,
whether it be an app or whatever it is.

148
00:09:43.736 --> 00:09:47.267
So, you will receive feedback,
they will get some, but

149
00:09:47.267 --> 00:09:50.873
probably won't be a lot, but
we'll get some and make sure

150
00:09:50.873 --> 00:09:55.824
that you allow that to shape the kind of
content and where you go with the report.

151
00:09:55.824 --> 00:09:59.044
But as you're beginning to think
about the scope of the report,

152
00:09:59.044 --> 00:10:02.751
because you've got to do that or
the scope of what you're gonna produce.

153
00:10:02.751 --> 00:10:07.824
Keep it as focus as possible,
but still bold enough to be able

154
00:10:07.824 --> 00:10:12.506
to write 2500 words don't
need to be a huge amount.

155
00:10:12.506 --> 00:10:14.638
It has to fill a lot
more than the blog post,

156
00:10:14.638 --> 00:10:17.503
if it's gonna be a report you
gonna give it away, right?
