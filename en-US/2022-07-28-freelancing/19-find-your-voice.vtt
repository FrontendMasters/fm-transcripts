00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.970
So let's talk about this idea of finding
your voice, when you write emails.

2
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:13.691
Old blog posts or, due speaking or
anything really, why is this important?

3
00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:17.300
Why is this a subject I'm even
talking about in this course?

4
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.150
And it's because personality is how we win
business at the end of the day, right?

5
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.120
More so than your skills,
more so than anything else.

6
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:35.512
I mean, look at myself,
I'm a good user experience designer, but

7
00:00:35.512 --> 00:00:41.580
I'm not the best by any
stretch of the imagination.

8
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.951
There are many more well
qualified people to teach user

9
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:52.681
experience design than me,
but they don't, all right?

10
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:56.814
And that's because, although
they're very good at what they do,

11
00:00:56.814 --> 00:00:58.845
they don't market themselves,

12
00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:03.500
they don't have the personality to maybe
come out and do this kind of thing.

13
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.024
So, I guess what I'm getting at is
we're not hired just on our ability,

14
00:01:11.024 --> 00:01:17.694
we're hired on lots of different factors,
personality is a big part of that.

15
00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:19.140
When we write online,

16
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.555
we've got this impression that we
have to be professional, right?

17
00:01:24.555 --> 00:01:29.685
And we have to write in this certain
way and it makes us so dull, right?

18
00:01:29.685 --> 00:01:31.949
And I fallen into this before.

19
00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:36.578
Of I need to be a bit more
professional and so I stopped joking,

20
00:01:36.578 --> 00:01:40.400
I stopped messing around which is me,
that is who I am.

21
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.580
That's my personality.

22
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.917
I make quips and throwaway comments
to get me in enormous trouble,

23
00:01:46.917 --> 00:01:50.000
that's just part of who I am.

24
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.873
But I was repressing that and I must
be considered, I must be professional.

25
00:01:54.873 --> 00:01:59.569
And actually that's detrimental
at the end of the day

26
00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:04.053
because you can only be who you are,
and if we try and

27
00:02:04.053 --> 00:02:10.646
strip out our personality, it just
leads to dull and unengaging content.

28
00:02:10.646 --> 00:02:18.002
Your personality is the one thing that
your competitors can't replicate.

29
00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:22.300
Not everyone will like you, that's fine.

30
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.820
There are a lot of people
that strongly dislike me.

31
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.374
But enough people will like you
to sustain your business and

32
00:02:29.374 --> 00:02:31.519
that's what ultimately matters.

33
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.517
And if people do like you, then they'll
listen to you, and if they listen to you,

34
00:02:37.517 --> 00:02:42.056
they'll come to trust you, and if they
come to trust you, they'll buy from you.

35
00:02:42.056 --> 00:02:47.345
So personality really is
a very powerful tool for

36
00:02:47.345 --> 00:02:52.376
winning work and
we need to stop trying to put on

37
00:02:52.376 --> 00:02:57.544
a face of professionalism
in everything we do.

38
00:02:57.544 --> 00:03:02.990
Because I deal with really
big hired organizations.

39
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.058
I deal with, C-suite people.

40
00:03:07.058 --> 00:03:11.140
But at the end of the day they're
all human beings, they all laugh,

41
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.220
they'll joke, they will make mistakes in
work, they're just like anybody else,

42
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.821
and so you need to connect with
them just like anybody else.

43
00:03:19.821 --> 00:03:24.584
You don't treat them like some kind of
corporate bot that you have to program in

44
00:03:24.584 --> 00:03:26.830
a certain way with the words you use.

45
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.223
Effectively, I think
it boils down to this,

46
00:03:31.223 --> 00:03:34.340
be more of what you already are, right?

47
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:41.680
One of the things I see a lot is you can't
be anybody else, so don't try, right?

48
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.310
So, the best one, I'm almost back on well,
I am embarrassed to say this right?

49
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.119
I'm quite an outgoing person and

50
00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:56.041
I'm quite informal, but
I came across Gary Vaynerchuk.

51
00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:59.105
I don't know whether you've
ever followed him, and

52
00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:03.570
I went through a period of time where
I just saw I want to be like him.

53
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.562
I don't know why, cuz he annoys me now but
at the time, I wanna be like him and

54
00:04:08.562 --> 00:04:12.400
I tried to be like Gary Vaynerchuk and
it was a train wreck.

55
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.280
I was just such an idiot, It wasn't me.

56
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.380
And you can only be who you are.

57
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.180
And there was another time there's this
guy that I really admire a guy called

58
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.855
Carmela Moles ,who is just as
well spoke quietly spoken,

59
00:04:28.855 --> 00:04:31.610
when he speaks it's words of wisdom.

60
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.230
And you go, wow.

61
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.735
And I wanted to be like him, but
I couldn't, because I gamble and

62
00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:40.380
I talk rubbish half the time.

63
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.896
And it's like, no, you just be yourself,

64
00:04:42.896 --> 00:04:47.340
to be a little bit more of yourself
than you would be normally, right?

65
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.970
Instead just exaggerate, a little bit of
who you are, to make it more obvious.

66
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.809
So for example,
I'm enthusiastic and passionate,

67
00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:03.301
I get excited and I might want to be,
and so I'm more of that.

68
00:05:03.301 --> 00:05:08.069
If could you imagine how annoying I'd
be to live with if I had this level of

69
00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.666
excitement and
monster energy drinks the whole time,

70
00:05:11.666 --> 00:05:15.595
if I talked like this the whole time,
my wife would kill me.

71
00:05:15.595 --> 00:05:19.650
But it is naturally in my personality, it
comes out more when I do stuff like this.

72
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.828
When I write, I'm more flippant
than I would be normally.

73
00:05:22.828 --> 00:05:26.361
I'm a little bit more of what I
am now perhaps you are someone

74
00:05:26.361 --> 00:05:30.884
who is really considered and thoughtful,
that's fine, then amp that up,

75
00:05:30.884 --> 00:05:33.940
be really considered and
thoughtful, right?

76
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.520
No personality type is wrong
when it comes to this stuff.

77
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.470
You just got to be a little
bit more than you are.

78
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.750
You don't need to appeal to everyone,
the Internet is a big place.

79
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.094
And there are a lot of
potential clients out there and

80
00:05:47.094 --> 00:05:49.451
someone is going to love who you are.

81
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:53.176
It sounds like something in
a self help book that doesn't it?

82
00:05:53.176 --> 00:05:55.050
You can find your perfect partner.

83
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.110
Someone will love you for
who you are, but it's true.

84
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.028
It really is, right?

85
00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:03.986
And then going back to what we talked
about a minute ago, have opinions,

86
00:06:03.986 --> 00:06:06.060
don't just recycle the thoughts of others.

87
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.125
I know it's kind of scary expressing your
opinions, but it's really worthwhile and

88
00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:12.570
people want to know your perspective.

89
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.348
And a lot of us go, we look around and
we look at other people in our industry.

90
00:06:17.348 --> 00:06:21.147
We go yeah,
they really know their stuff, all right?

91
00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:24.480
I could never be as good
a communicator as then.

92
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.501
No, you couldn't be the same as them, but
actually your way of explaining things,

93
00:06:32.501 --> 00:06:38.040
your way of talking about things,
will appeal to a different group.

94
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:43.928
Some people, for example, I really
admire this guy called Jeremy Keith,

95
00:06:43.928 --> 00:06:47.390
who is, I just love the way he talks.

96
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.671
But I know for a lot of people,
he's too intellectual it just go,

97
00:06:50.671 --> 00:06:55.089
it's like, that's all theoretical, which
is kind of goes over their heads, and

98
00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:57.500
he's not for people like that.

99
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.900
And so maybe my voice is more appealing
for people like that I don't know.

100
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.522
So basically,
you have got your place in all of this,

101
00:07:07.522 --> 00:07:12.190
you have got your market,
you've got your space.

102
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.430
And I would encourage you to
express your own opinions.

103
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.170
Maybe write yourself a bit of
a personal manifesto, right?

104
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.850
What is it you care about, right?

105
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:21.940
What are your big passion?

106
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.310
So for me, right at the top
of my list is accessibility.

107
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.594
I believe the web should be for
everybody, right?

108
00:07:28.594 --> 00:07:32.848
That's one of my fundamental
principles that I believe.

109
00:07:32.848 --> 00:07:37.880
What really annoys me, right,
what don't I believe, what don't I like?

110
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.800
Well I've got this real deep hatred of
dark patterns they irritate me, okay?

111
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.370
What do I believe in,
what not just what do I care about?

112
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.190
What do I believe in?

113
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.990
I believe in the fact that it what's good
for the user, is good for the business.

114
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:57.614
These are my fundamental underlying
principles that shape what I share online,

115
00:07:57.614 --> 00:07:59.510
and what I stand for.

116
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.363
So people when they mentioned Paul Boac,

117
00:08:02.363 --> 00:08:06.204
they kind of know what he cares about,
what he's into.

118
00:08:06.204 --> 00:08:08.600
So, there's a little bit of advice.

119
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.410
So it all got a bit little
airy fairy there for a minute.

120
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.230
I'm sorry about that.

121
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:17.448
But it is worth thinking about who you
are, how you're gonna present yourself and

122
00:08:17.448 --> 00:08:20.751
how you're gonna communicate as
you begin to build your list and

123
00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:23.120
give yourself a little bit confidence.

124
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.816
The other thing I will say, which is not
in the slide deck, but when you start,

125
00:08:26.816 --> 00:08:28.229
you'll be rubbish, right?

126
00:08:28.229 --> 00:08:33.350
All of my blog posts back to 2005
are all on the BI world website.

127
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:38.078
If ever you're feeling bad about your
content, and you think you're rubbish,

128
00:08:38.078 --> 00:08:41.708
go back through my archives and
read what I wrote in 2005.

129
00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:44.150
It will be a train wreck, right?

130
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:48.710
And even better if you
really want a giggle, right,

131
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:53.280
go and
look at my podcasts that started in 2005.

132
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:58.994
When my first podcast is
me sitting on a mic going,

133
00:08:58.994 --> 00:09:06.300
today I want to talk about all
accessibility of PDF files.

134
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.140
And then I drone on like this for
a very long time.

135
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.550
I mean it's appalling it's a train wreck,
right?

136
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.270
So check those out and
make you feel better about yourself.

137
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:20.582
And to begin with, the thing you've got
reassure yourself tougher this nobody's

138
00:09:20.582 --> 00:09:22.202
going to be list watching to begin with.

139
00:09:22.202 --> 00:09:23.679
Nobody's gonna be reading to begin with,

140
00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:25.450
your mailing list is going
to be tiny to begin with.

141
00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.679
So, that's the time to make the mistakes
because nobody's going to know,

142
00:09:28.679 --> 00:09:29.695
anyway let's move on.
