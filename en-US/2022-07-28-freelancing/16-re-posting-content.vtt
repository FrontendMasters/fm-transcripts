WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
We have put an immense amount
of work into this so far, right?

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.468
We have created an email course.

3
00:00:07.468 --> 00:00:09.877
We've created a report.

4
00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:11.276
We've audited a load of sites.

5
00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:12.973
We've made a load of contacts.

6
00:00:12.973 --> 00:00:14.554
We've done a lot of work, right?

7
00:00:14.554 --> 00:00:19.981
Now, I'm inherently lazy, okay?

8
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:23.108
And I can't remember who said it, but

9
00:00:23.108 --> 00:00:27.508
somebody said about the best
coders are lazy coders,

10
00:00:27.508 --> 00:00:33.292
cuz they reuse their code, right,
and they write it in a modular way.

11
00:00:33.292 --> 00:00:37.818
Well, I'm exactly the same with content,
right?

12
00:00:37.818 --> 00:00:40.710
We've put so
much effort into all this content.

13
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.239
We are gonna now squeeze that content
till every drop has come out of it and

14
00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.328
we've got every piece of value.

15
00:00:47.328 --> 00:00:49.116
Because, let's be honest,

16
00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:53.916
we're not gonna wanna be recreating this
amount of content on a regular basis.

17
00:00:53.916 --> 00:01:00.266
So now we've kind of exhausted that
initial list of influencers and companies.

18
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.043
We've contacted them as much as we can.

19
00:01:02.043 --> 00:01:03.693
If they've signed up, great.

20
00:01:03.693 --> 00:01:06.708
If they haven't, the moment has passed.

21
00:01:06.708 --> 00:01:10.919
But there are many,
many more people we want to reach.

22
00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:15.556
So now we're gonna start to use some
more traditional techniques of content

23
00:01:15.556 --> 00:01:17.299
marketing to achieve that.

24
00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.698
But we're gonna reuse and
recycle the content that we've

25
00:01:22.698 --> 00:01:29.654
already created to generate that
content for content marketing, right?

26
00:01:29.654 --> 00:01:32.279
Does that sentence makes sense?

27
00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:36.607
So we're gonna use everything
that's in the emails and

28
00:01:36.607 --> 00:01:41.130
the report, and
we are going to turn them into blog posts.

29
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.232
We're gonna turn them into webinars.

30
00:01:43.232 --> 00:01:45.661
We're gonna turn them into
social media updates.

31
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:48.290
We're gonna turn them into
guest speaking slots.

32
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.154
We're gonna turn them
into podcast interviews.

33
00:01:51.154 --> 00:01:53.651
We're gonna turn them into
anything we can possibly think of.

34
00:01:53.651 --> 00:01:56.753
We are gonna dine out on that content for

35
00:01:56.753 --> 00:02:01.746
as long as we possibly can just
as a frame of reference, right?

36
00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:05.366
Brad Frost,
you guys probably know Brad Frost,

37
00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:11.302
the guy that came up with atomic design
and really popularized design systems.

38
00:02:11.302 --> 00:02:13.126
Amazing guy, very talented.

39
00:02:13.126 --> 00:02:18.012
He dined out on atomic design for
years, right?

40
00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:19.632
That was what he was hired for.

41
00:02:19.632 --> 00:02:21.143
That was what he was known for.

42
00:02:21.143 --> 00:02:23.052
Hey, I've done the same thing.

43
00:02:23.052 --> 00:02:25.610
Every time I write a book,
that's it for four years.

44
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.730
That's enough to keep me going,
just saying the same thing in slightly

45
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.870
different ways in slightly
different mediums.

46
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.467
So that is exactly what
you guys are gonna do now.

47
00:02:33.467 --> 00:02:36.279
You're not gonna have to
constantly come up with new stuff.

48
00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:40.500
We're just gonna take those things,
and we're gonna repurpose them.

49
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.320
So for example,
we're gonna turn our report into posts.

50
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.358
So ideally,
we wanna take our content, right,

51
00:02:48.358 --> 00:02:51.411
that we've created in the report and

52
00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:56.545
turn them into guest posts on
other people's sites, right?

53
00:02:56.545 --> 00:02:59.967
So all those influencers we were
reaching out to, all those publications,

54
00:02:59.967 --> 00:03:02.599
we're gonna say, hey,
we've got this amazing report.

55
00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.363
It would be wonderful if you promoted it.

56
00:03:04.363 --> 00:03:09.132
But if you'd like, I'll quite happily
write you a guest post around some of

57
00:03:09.132 --> 00:03:11.530
the report's key findings, right?

58
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.303
Brilliant, that's superb.

59
00:03:14.303 --> 00:03:18.673
So all you need to do, take the content,
take one of the topics, or

60
00:03:18.673 --> 00:03:22.045
take the report as a whole,
whatever you wanna do.

61
00:03:22.045 --> 00:03:23.264
Write a guest post.

62
00:03:23.264 --> 00:03:24.681
You've done all the hard work already.

63
00:03:24.681 --> 00:03:28.079
It will come together really
quickly with no effort.

64
00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.135
However, failing that, if you can't get
guest posts, then what we're gonna do

65
00:03:33.135 --> 00:03:38.431
is we're gonna research into some keyword
phrases using a tool like kwfinder.com.

66
00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:42.480
Which allows you to research
into different questions, maybe,

67
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.592
that people ask.

68
00:03:43.592 --> 00:03:48.101
And we'll then create
keyword-optimized blog posts designed

69
00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:51.699
to rank well on those different keywords,
right?

70
00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:56.951
So these guest posts based on
a report are really easy to create.

71
00:03:56.951 --> 00:04:01.228
You decide on a question that
you answered in your report, and

72
00:04:01.228 --> 00:04:04.773
you use that question as
the basis of your content.

73
00:04:04.773 --> 00:04:08.007
You write a post with using exactly
the same editorial process I

74
00:04:08.007 --> 00:04:09.236
already talked about.

75
00:04:09.236 --> 00:04:14.303
You remember the write drunk,
edit sober approach.

76
00:04:14.303 --> 00:04:19.113
And this is the critical bit,
and where people often go wrong.

77
00:04:19.113 --> 00:04:24.087
You include a clear call
to action in the post

78
00:04:24.087 --> 00:04:28.935
to signup for the report and email course.

79
00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:35.103
I started off by criticizing
content marketing, right?

80
00:04:35.103 --> 00:04:39.809
And the big problem that I see with most
people's content marketing approaches,

81
00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:43.219
most agencies and freelancers,
is they write a blog post,

82
00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:45.075
they shove it on their website.

83
00:04:45.075 --> 00:04:49.650
They've written it about
whatever popped into their head.

84
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.520
Nobody reads it,
cuz nobody visits their website.

85
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.023
And even those people that do read it,
they then go away and

86
00:04:56.023 --> 00:04:59.469
go, that was nice, and
never think about it again.

87
00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:04.318
So instead, what we're doing, is we
are creating articles specifically for

88
00:05:04.318 --> 00:05:05.719
our target audience.

89
00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:08.729
We're trying to get them shown or

90
00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:14.116
published on blogs where we
know our audience are reading.

91
00:05:14.116 --> 00:05:19.017
And we're having a clear call to action at
the end of it to try and encourage them

92
00:05:19.017 --> 00:05:23.414
to give us their email address so
that we can keep in contact with them.

93
00:05:23.414 --> 00:05:26.339
And that is the underlying principle.

94
00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:31.348
Whatever you do, whether you run
a webinar, whether you run a course,

95
00:05:31.348 --> 00:05:36.191
whether you do a social media update,
whether you write a blog post,

96
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:40.222
whatever you do,
it needs to have a clear call to action.

97
00:05:40.222 --> 00:05:43.102
Otherwise there's no point of doing it,
right?

98
00:05:43.102 --> 00:05:46.832
If there's not a value that's
coming out of it, I mean,

99
00:05:46.832 --> 00:05:51.807
if you're speaking at a conference for
free, or going to a local meetup, or

100
00:05:51.807 --> 00:05:56.784
doing any of these stuff, and
you don't try and capture someone's email,

101
00:05:56.784 --> 00:06:00.163
there's very little value
in it compared to this.

102
00:06:00.163 --> 00:06:03.419
And then, of course,
whatever that post is,

103
00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.431
you're gonna promote it on social media.

104
00:06:06.431 --> 00:06:10.914
But you can also turn your
report into a webinar.

105
00:06:10.914 --> 00:06:14.242
So considering running
a webinar based on your report.

106
00:06:14.242 --> 00:06:19.093
But I'll wait for that until maybe you've
built up a bit of a following on social,

107
00:06:19.093 --> 00:06:20.568
or on your mailing list,

108
00:06:20.568 --> 00:06:25.159
because obviously, otherwise no one's
gonna come to the webinar, right?

109
00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:30.268
The thing about a webinar, the reason
that it's something worth considering,

110
00:06:30.268 --> 00:06:32.296
is because up until this point,

111
00:06:32.296 --> 00:06:38.340
we haven't had any face-to-face contact
with our potential audience, right?

112
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.328
And webinars are a great way of engaging
with your audience in a kind of

113
00:06:43.328 --> 00:06:45.180
personalized way.

114
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.945
So you could have read a course on this.

115
00:06:50.945 --> 00:06:52.545
It could have been a written course,
right,

116
00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:54.958
where you read all of the instructions
I've shared with you today.

117
00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:59.881
But you wouldn't felt like you got to know
me like you have from listening to me,

118
00:06:59.881 --> 00:07:00.405
right?

119
00:07:00.405 --> 00:07:03.803
You wouldn't have got a sense
of my sense of humor, or

120
00:07:03.803 --> 00:07:08.122
maybe my pragmatic nature, or
my Britishness, or whatever it is.

121
00:07:08.122 --> 00:07:12.834
All of those things are the kinds of
things that influence your decision of

122
00:07:12.834 --> 00:07:14.890
whether to hire someone or not.

123
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:19.822
So a webinar is actually a really good way
of beginning to make that kinda connection

124
00:07:19.822 --> 00:07:20.671
with people.

125
00:07:20.671 --> 00:07:25.330
But then, maybe don't do that on day one,
but it's certainly worth considering.

126
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.351
If you're gonna do it,
it only needs to be about 40 minutes,

127
00:07:28.351 --> 00:07:30.575
along with maybe 20 minutes for questions.

128
00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:34.204
Cover maybe three of the key
findings in the report.

129
00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:36.070
That's probably all you need to cover.

130
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.868
So again,
all the contents written for you.

131
00:07:39.868 --> 00:07:44.463
Add the webinar to your landing
page where the report is.

132
00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:49.098
Once you've done it, you can record it,
put it on their landing page.

133
00:07:49.098 --> 00:07:52.650
It actually adds credibility
to the landing page.

134
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.654
And then consider maybe approaching
some meetups in your areas or

135
00:07:56.654 --> 00:08:01.331
conferences in your areas and saying look,
here's a webinar I did online.

136
00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:04.320
Would you like me to come and
do it for your group?

137
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.952
So then you can start getting
in front of audiences and

138
00:08:07.952 --> 00:08:10.302
talking about some of this stuff.

139
00:08:10.302 --> 00:08:14.444
Now you might think that
all sounds very scary.

140
00:08:14.444 --> 00:08:15.774
And public speaking's not for everybody.

141
00:08:15.774 --> 00:08:19.909
And if it really terrifies you,
by all means, don't do it.

142
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:24.020
There are other opportunities
that are available to you.

143
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.799
But I think you'll be surprised how you
feel once you've finished the report,

144
00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:32.450
because you'll be very confident
in the material, right?

145
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.575
You'll know exactly what
you're talking about.

146
00:08:34.575 --> 00:08:37.268
You'll have statistics, and quotes, and

147
00:08:37.268 --> 00:08:41.140
all these kinds of things that
will make it so much easier to do.

148
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.555
So yeah, have a think about that.

149
00:08:44.555 --> 00:08:48.358
And then, of course,
you need to be promoting your course and

150
00:08:48.358 --> 00:08:50.201
your report on social media.

151
00:08:50.201 --> 00:08:53.454
But again, even this is so much easier,

152
00:08:53.454 --> 00:08:58.065
because you've got all this
material to work with.

153
00:08:58.065 --> 00:09:03.392
So you can take the material from
your report and your email course,

154
00:09:03.392 --> 00:09:07.131
pull out snippets,
turn them into pictures and

155
00:09:07.131 --> 00:09:12.465
put them on Instagram, turn them
into text and put them on Twitter.

156
00:09:12.465 --> 00:09:16.766
So for example, there's all kinds of
things that come straight out of that

157
00:09:16.766 --> 00:09:20.980
report that you can just regurgitate and
people will love to share.

158
00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.680
Things like statistics,
we've got statistics from the survey.

159
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.494
Everybody likes sharing statistics.

160
00:09:26.494 --> 00:09:27.910
It makes them look clever.

161
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:32.312
Did you know that people only read
an average of 25% of the content on

162
00:09:32.312 --> 00:09:33.067
a web page?

163
00:09:33.067 --> 00:09:34.677
Well, that's true.

164
00:09:34.677 --> 00:09:38.292
Jacob Nielsen did research on this.

165
00:09:38.292 --> 00:09:41.475
So now you think how intelligent Paul is.

166
00:09:41.475 --> 00:09:45.144
That could just trip off that fact,
that figure isn't actually right.

167
00:09:45.144 --> 00:09:46.983
I think it's 24%, but anyway.

168
00:09:46.983 --> 00:09:50.450
So statistics are a really
good thing to share.

169
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:55.360
You've got great quotes from
people within the industry, right?

170
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.535
Because hopefully you've spoken
to a few people by this stage,

171
00:09:59.535 --> 00:10:01.500
put that in the report.

172
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.484
And now you can quote
that on social media.

173
00:10:03.484 --> 00:10:08.060
And of course, if people were mentioned
on social media, what do they do?

174
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:13.903
They reshare it, they retweet it,
so that spreads it further.

175
00:10:13.903 --> 00:10:19.234
Then also, you can share little practical
actions and advice that help people.

176
00:10:19.234 --> 00:10:23.376
So you made little recommendations in
the report, so you can rechurn those and

177
00:10:23.376 --> 00:10:25.400
put those into social media updates.

178
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.488
I would recommend where possible,
use some video and audio.

179
00:10:30.488 --> 00:10:35.749
You can take bits maybe from
the webinar if you did that.

180
00:10:35.749 --> 00:10:43.000
Or you can create little audio grams which
are tiny little kind of audio snippets.

181
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Quotes in the report can
be shown as nice images.

182
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.280
There's some great tools out
there to make them look fancier.

183
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.941
Tableau is just one, but there are others.

184
00:10:53.941 --> 00:10:58.788
And then of course, critically, whenever
you do any of these things, you end with

185
00:10:58.788 --> 00:11:03.788
and for more information, see our report,
and you link through to the landing page.

186
00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:08.294
Also throw in a few relevant hashtags,
just for good measure for

187
00:11:08.294 --> 00:11:13.980
those people that follow such things,
and mention influences where relevant.

188
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.790
Now, you might be thinking, okay,
I'm Paul, hang on a minute.

189
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:21.969
You said that once we were done
with the big heavy lifting at

190
00:11:21.969 --> 00:11:27.102
the beginning that I only had to do
to one email every two weeks, right?

191
00:11:27.102 --> 00:11:29.713
And now you've thrown in
social media on top of this.

192
00:11:29.713 --> 00:11:33.168
Don't think I haven't noticed, you liar.

193
00:11:33.168 --> 00:11:39.840
Well, I'm not actually lying, because my
entire social media feed is automated.

194
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.800
I don't write my social updates.

195
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.151
I mean, obviously I wrote
them once the first time, but

196
00:11:46.151 --> 00:11:48.100
I don't send them out individually.

197
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.650
Instead I use a tool called CoSchedule,

198
00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:55.000
which has got two really good features
that make life so much easier,

199
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.930
and mean that I don't have to keep
thinking of social media updates.

200
00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:05.083
First is that I can schedule updates
through an editorial calendar.

201
00:12:05.083 --> 00:12:08.330
So for example, it plugs into WordPress.

202
00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:13.709
So every time I release a blog post,
I then have said, okay,

203
00:12:13.709 --> 00:12:18.466
when this blog post is released,
send out this post.

204
00:12:18.466 --> 00:12:21.239
A day after it's been released,
send out this post.

205
00:12:21.239 --> 00:12:23.073
A day after that, send out this post.

206
00:12:23.073 --> 00:12:25.351
A week after that, send this one.

207
00:12:25.351 --> 00:12:27.161
A month after that, send this one.

208
00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:31.909
So I line up a whole load that
are associated with any particular post

209
00:12:31.909 --> 00:12:35.100
that I put out or announcement.

210
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.955
And then the other feature that its got,
which is really nice,

211
00:12:38.955 --> 00:12:41.820
is it will then fill in the gaps, right?

212
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.340
So between those ones that are very
small specifically scheduled,

213
00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:51.733
I've also got a whole bank of these quotes
and statistics, and stuff like that,

214
00:12:51.733 --> 00:12:57.305
that I've taken out my reports, and my
books, and various things over the years.

215
00:12:57.305 --> 00:13:00.834
And I've literally got hundreds of them
that have built up over the years.

216
00:13:00.834 --> 00:13:05.081
They're in a massive big bank,
and basically CoSchedule goes in,

217
00:13:05.081 --> 00:13:08.669
picks them out, fills in the gaps,
and shoves them out.

218
00:13:08.669 --> 00:13:12.248
And it will monitor which ones perform
best and put those out more often.

219
00:13:12.248 --> 00:13:16.762
And it will ensure that you don't have
the same one going out more than x amount

220
00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:20.043
of time, and all of these kinds
of things you can set up.

221
00:13:20.043 --> 00:13:24.872
So it means you can automate your whole
social media feed based off of your

222
00:13:24.872 --> 00:13:26.548
single report, right?

223
00:13:26.548 --> 00:13:30.665
Wow, that's social media done, okay?

224
00:13:30.665 --> 00:13:33.800
And obviously, it posts across
different platforms as well.

225
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.150
So let's recap.

226
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.610
We're beginning to build
our mailing lists.

227
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.271
We're establishing contact.

228
00:13:41.271 --> 00:13:41.927
How are we doing that?

229
00:13:41.927 --> 00:13:46.891
We're doing that by writing an email
course around the report findings.

230
00:13:46.891 --> 00:13:51.782
We're gonna create a landing page that
sells that report and that email course.

231
00:13:51.782 --> 00:13:59.670
We're gonna email our cold email group,
the initial audience with our report.

232
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.150
We're gonna reach out to our influences.

233
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:07.584
And then we're gonna recycle the heck
out of our content in two kinds

234
00:14:07.584 --> 00:14:12.552
of different formats to attract
a bigger audience over time.

235
00:14:12.552 --> 00:14:19.020
And we're gonna automate our social media
to avoid it becoming a pain in the neck.
