1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.973
So let's talk quickly about this
email course, because I've just

2
00:00:04.973 --> 00:00:10.131
suddenly dropped this on you [LAUGH]
as another thing you've got to do.

3
00:00:10.131 --> 00:00:15.369
So, there are reasons for
doing this, right?

4
00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:20.369
One is that it leads nicely, because there
are some people you have promised to

5
00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.623
give the report to for free, whether they
had sign up for the email or not, right?

6
00:00:25.623 --> 00:00:29.700
So anybody who's completed the survey,
you've basically turned around to them and

7
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.619
said, if you've completed the survey,
I'm gonna give you the report, right?

8
00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:39.164
Everybody else, they will only get the
report if they sign up for your emails.

9
00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:43.124
But that group that completed the survey,
we also want to add,

10
00:00:43.124 --> 00:00:45.454
we want to encourage them to sign up.

11
00:00:45.454 --> 00:00:50.179
So, we want to give them a course that
packs a little bit more of the report,

12
00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.513
and that encourages them to sign up.

13
00:00:52.513 --> 00:00:57.269
Also, the course is a nice
little kind of introduction,

14
00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.633
if you like, to the report,
builds on the report and adds to it.

15
00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:06.991
And then the way that the course will
work is it's basically what's called

16
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:08.733
a trigger-based campaign.

17
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:15.511
So if somebody signs up today,
they will get lesson one tomorrow,

18
00:01:15.511 --> 00:01:21.088
lesson two the day after,
lesson three the day after.

19
00:01:21.088 --> 00:01:25.234
And if someone doesn't sign up for four
days, they'll still get one, two, three,

20
00:01:25.234 --> 00:01:26.856
four, and those kinds of order.

21
00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:28.612
Does that make sense?

22
00:01:28.612 --> 00:01:33.550
So, that means that everyone is
going through the same initial

23
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.472
introduction, okay,
no matter when they join.

24
00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:41.731
So they're not just being dumped into
your mailing list at some random thing,

25
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:45.927
where maybe you're ranting about
something that's very time sensitive and

26
00:01:45.927 --> 00:01:46.977
not appropriate.

27
00:01:46.977 --> 00:01:49.736
Everybody gets that nice
structured introduction.

28
00:01:49.736 --> 00:01:52.543
So that's why the course is worth doing.

29
00:01:52.543 --> 00:01:57.009
In terms of how you create your course,
very simple,

30
00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.686
one email for
each of the topics in your report, right?

31
00:02:01.686 --> 00:02:04.260
So we went six to eight topics, didn't we?

32
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.679
And then you schedule those
to go out once a week.

33
00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.207
So once somebody is subscribed,
they get one a week.

34
00:02:10.207 --> 00:02:14.829
Now, I know that normally you might not
be emailing them more than once a month.

35
00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.292
But it means to begin with,

36
00:02:16.292 --> 00:02:19.804
you're really building that
relationship in those early days.

37
00:02:19.804 --> 00:02:24.002
So once a week,
they get an email from their course.

38
00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:26.995
They only need to be about 500 words each.

39
00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:28.674
Don't need to be very long.

40
00:02:28.674 --> 00:02:32.850
They only need basic formatting
to aid a bit scannability.

41
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.342
And that's it, that's all there is
to the structure of the course.

42
00:02:36.342 --> 00:02:40.344
When they finish the course,
then they just get your monthly email or

43
00:02:40.344 --> 00:02:41.655
your biweekly email.

44
00:02:41.655 --> 00:02:43.487
Writing each email, right?

45
00:02:43.487 --> 00:02:45.387
Basically, it's really easy.

46
00:02:45.387 --> 00:02:50.930
You create a recap of what was
said in the report, right?

47
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.613
Recap briefly the challenge or

48
00:02:52.613 --> 00:02:56.637
piece of advice from the report that
you're gonna focus on in that email.

49
00:02:56.637 --> 00:03:01.497
You're gonna give a little bit of advice,
provide a few practical tips about

50
00:03:01.497 --> 00:03:06.234
how to address that challenge, or
take them closer to that best practice.

51
00:03:06.234 --> 00:03:09.680
And then you're gonna encourage them
to contact you if they're struggling or

52
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.245
if they've got any questions, so
we're beginning to encourage that contact.

53
00:03:13.245 --> 00:03:14.842
That's it, right?

54
00:03:14.842 --> 00:03:18.607
Really nice and simple.

55
00:03:18.607 --> 00:03:21.809
A side I wanna say at this
point is with any of this,

56
00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:26.792
with the report, with the emails,
the whole thing, don't ever hold back.

57
00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:29.050
Share all the advice that you have freely.

58
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.052
Don't worry about people doing it for
themselves and not hiring you.

59
00:03:33.052 --> 00:03:37.288
People are still gonna reach out to you
because they don't have the time or

60
00:03:37.288 --> 00:03:40.789
they feel too intimidated by
the topic to try it themselves.

61
00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:45.632
Don't worry about your competition
reading it and copying you, right?

62
00:03:45.632 --> 00:03:49.492
You're always gonna be a step ahead.

63
00:03:49.492 --> 00:03:53.140
People are gonna hire you
because they know and like you,

64
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.419
not because somebody copied what you did,
right?

65
00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.009
And the other thing is still do not sell.

66
00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:02.019
You don't need to sell in those emails,
right?

67
00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.128
There's no need to promote
your services actively.

68
00:04:05.128 --> 00:04:08.297
Be open about what you do, that's fine.

69
00:04:08.297 --> 00:04:13.480
You might wanna recommend to
the reader that they might hire

70
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.815
somebody to help them with this, but
it doesn't have to be you, right?

71
00:04:19.815 --> 00:04:23.363
Don't push yourself at all,
there's absolutely no need.

72
00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:30.058
And so that email series, those first six
to eight emails that go out as part of

73
00:04:30.058 --> 00:04:35.211
this email course could be
utterly automated, all right?

74
00:04:35.211 --> 00:04:39.418
People will enroll at different times, but
they'll all pass through the same course.

75
00:04:39.418 --> 00:04:45.058
And again, I use ConvertKit to do this,
which will handle all of that,

76
00:04:45.058 --> 00:04:50.049
including, to be honest,
building the landing page as well.

77
00:04:50.049 --> 00:04:52.544
Right, so that's what you're
gonna do from the landing page.

78
00:04:52.544 --> 00:04:55.170
People can sign up,
they can get the report.

79
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.442
And when they get the report,
they get instantly.

80
00:04:57.442 --> 00:05:00.356
Then over the next few weeks,
they get those emails, and

81
00:05:00.356 --> 00:05:02.550
then they go onto the normal mailing list.

82
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.060
What about those people that
took part in the survey or

83
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.897
didn't take part in the survey,
that cold list that we're contacting,

84
00:05:10.897 --> 00:05:13.018
what are we gonna do about them?

85
00:05:13.018 --> 00:05:15.951
Well, those people that
participated in the survey,

86
00:05:15.951 --> 00:05:18.067
we're gonna drop them one last email.

87
00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:21.518
And it's gonna make it clear that
the email is about the report and

88
00:05:21.518 --> 00:05:23.041
showing our appreciation.

89
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:29.086
So our title is gonna be, Your
promised report, with a big thank you.

90
00:05:29.086 --> 00:05:33.946
And then it's gonna say how much you
appreciated them being involved in it and

91
00:05:33.946 --> 00:05:37.708
how they'd managed to help
turn it into something bigger.

92
00:05:37.708 --> 00:05:42.798
You're then gonna tell them what
the report ended up covering,

93
00:05:42.798 --> 00:05:46.298
thanks to their feedback and involvement.

94
00:05:46.298 --> 00:05:51.006
You're then gonna actually
attach the report to the email,

95
00:05:51.006 --> 00:05:55.263
right, as a PDF file, so
people can help themselves.

96
00:05:55.263 --> 00:06:00.189
Also, if you did do the review,
the audit of their site,

97
00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:06.566
attach their scores to it as well so
they can see their individual scores.

98
00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:11.467
And then you wanna just introduce
this idea of the email series,

99
00:06:11.467 --> 00:06:14.389
what the email series is gonna cover.

100
00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:19.301
Finally, you say, if that email course
sounds good, you can subscribe for

101
00:06:19.301 --> 00:06:20.080
free here.

102
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.556
So you're not requiring that group
to subscribe to get the report,

103
00:06:25.556 --> 00:06:30.083
because that group contributed
to the survey, right?

104
00:06:30.083 --> 00:06:33.511
So you promised you'd give it to them,
you're giving it to them, right?

105
00:06:33.511 --> 00:06:37.721
You're hoping they will also sign
up to the email course as well, but

106
00:06:37.721 --> 00:06:39.257
there's no guarantee.

107
00:06:39.257 --> 00:06:43.667
For everybody else, if they want
the report, they have to sign up for

108
00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:45.429
the email course, right?

109
00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:48.230
So they just get a variation,
which is very similar.

110
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.593
It just says, if you wanna download
the report, get the email course,

111
00:06:52.593 --> 00:06:53.841
click here, okay?

112
00:06:55.576 --> 00:06:58.336
Right, so we got a landing page.

113
00:06:58.336 --> 00:06:59.774
We told a load of people about it.

114
00:06:59.774 --> 00:07:04.742
Hopefully, you've now got some sign ups,
people who've gone in to get the report,

115
00:07:04.742 --> 00:07:07.228
or to get the email course,
or to get both.

116
00:07:07.228 --> 00:07:08.692
So they're in there.

117
00:07:08.692 --> 00:07:09.883
There are now on our list.

118
00:07:09.883 --> 00:07:15.198
They're beginning to move through
that email course very slowly.

119
00:07:15.198 --> 00:07:17.926
In the meantime, what are you gonna do?

120
00:07:17.926 --> 00:07:22.857
Now, you've got to start promoting
that report, any opportunity you get.
