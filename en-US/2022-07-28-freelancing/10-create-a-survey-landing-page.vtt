1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.470
In my experience, try to pick a topic
that you can support by numbers.

2
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.253
So people love it when you
say things in a report like,

3
00:00:10.253 --> 00:00:16.240
22% of respondents have never done
usability testing on their website, right?

4
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.060
That kind of insights people really like.

5
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.431
So don't pick a subject that's so

6
00:00:22.431 --> 00:00:26.920
wooly that it wouldn't enable
that kind of analysis.

7
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.170
Again, I'm gonna get into exactly how to
do the report, so don't overly worry.

8
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.328
So once you've done that initial contact
and you're beginning to get a sense of,

9
00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:38.836
okay, I wanna write a report
on this kinda subject and

10
00:00:38.836 --> 00:00:41.390
I want it to cover these kinds of things.

11
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.207
Then you can get into preparing
to send a survey, right?

12
00:00:47.207 --> 00:00:49.530
Why a survey, right?

13
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.700
Why are we asking people
to complete a survey?

14
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.720
Well, there's several reasons.

15
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.092
First of all, it's gonna give us
valuable content for the report,

16
00:00:58.092 --> 00:01:02.040
cuz as I've already said,
writing a report is quite intimidating.

17
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.538
But if you've got a survey and you can
just reference things that have been said

18
00:01:06.538 --> 00:01:11.120
in the survey, means a lot less work on
you, makes the whole thing a lot easier.

19
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.605
Secondly, and probably more importantly,
it's an opportunity to contact

20
00:01:16.605 --> 00:01:21.421
people again and go, hey, don't forget I
exist and I'm interested in your sector.

21
00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:24.790
It's also really good for
understanding your audience, right?

22
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.813
What is it they want?

23
00:01:25.813 --> 00:01:27.830
What is it they care about?

24
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.330
So let's talk about creating that survey,
right?

25
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.240
So we know roughly what
we wanna write about.

26
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.770
We know who we wanna reach out to.

27
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.300
What do we wanna ask in that survey,
all right?

28
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.350
First thing, it can't take more
than 5 to 7 minutes to complete.

29
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:51.062
I reckon around 20 questions
is about right, okay?

30
00:01:51.062 --> 00:01:55.506
Too few and
it looks like you're not really trying,

31
00:01:55.506 --> 00:01:58.948
too many and people don't complete it.

32
00:01:58.948 --> 00:02:03.819
So by far the majority of those questions
should be multi-choice questions,

33
00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:04.570
all right?

34
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.438
That will, A, it makes it a lot easier for
people to complete, and

35
00:02:08.438 --> 00:02:12.720
they can do it faster and they don't
have to think so much about it, and B,

36
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.160
it makes your data analysis much easier.

37
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.599
So doing things like,
22% of people said this,

38
00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.977
you can see it instantly without
having to do a lot of digging.

39
00:02:24.977 --> 00:02:26.149
With any survey,

40
00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:31.008
it's always good practice to start
with a really easy question, right?

41
00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:34.642
The reason being is that
once people start something,

42
00:02:34.642 --> 00:02:37.020
they're more likely to finish it.

43
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.349
So ask them a no-brainer question or
so something like,

44
00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.779
how big is the company you work for
or something like that.

45
00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:50.404
Or alternatively, ask them a question
which you know they're gonna

46
00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:53.446
have a really strong opinion about, right?

47
00:02:53.446 --> 00:03:01.080
A question like, is your department
adequately funded, right?

48
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.598
Cuz they're all instantly going,
of course it's not.

49
00:03:04.598 --> 00:03:11.012
And it's a bit of a wasted question, but
it's a good one at getting them engaged.

50
00:03:11.012 --> 00:03:13.901
Right, so, at the end of the survey,
you wanna ask,

51
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:18.219
would you be willing to be interviewed,
right, cuz I'd love to chat with you.

52
00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:22.380
Now this, the people that say yes
to this are invaluable, right?

53
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.753
So I had one agency who who did this and
they sent out their survey, bless them.

54
00:03:27.753 --> 00:03:30.834
But not agency,
it was a freelancer, right?

55
00:03:30.834 --> 00:03:36.890
Freelancer sent out the survey and
he picked a very niche market.

56
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.040
But even so, it should have worked.

57
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.580
He unfortunately only got three
replies to the survey, right?

58
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.243
He was gutted.

59
00:03:44.243 --> 00:03:50.130
Yet one of those replies said,
you can contact me.

60
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.157
And so he gave him a ring and
had a chat with them, and

61
00:03:54.157 --> 00:03:57.448
it led to six months worth of work for
him.

62
00:03:57.448 --> 00:04:03.177
So if anybody who says they're
willing to be interviewed,

63
00:04:03.177 --> 00:04:10.065
take them up on it, really invaluable,
often that can turn into work.

64
00:04:10.065 --> 00:04:12.245
So it's a really good one.

65
00:04:12.245 --> 00:04:13.911
And then at the end as well,

66
00:04:13.911 --> 00:04:17.399
it's worth offering that site
review thing that I said.

67
00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:23.614
Now, the site review only
needs to be very lightweight.

68
00:04:23.614 --> 00:04:28.046
It just basically needs to be, well,
the one that I do because I do usability,

69
00:04:28.046 --> 00:04:31.272
I basically spend 20 minutes
looking around the site,

70
00:04:31.272 --> 00:04:34.564
recording me live with Loom,
saying this isn't so good,

71
00:04:34.564 --> 00:04:38.888
that's great, that's wonderful,
no, I don't like that, basically.

72
00:04:38.888 --> 00:04:40.920
And I send that to them.

73
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.898
If you work in something like performance,
you just could run it through some

74
00:04:45.898 --> 00:04:49.433
of the tools that are out there
that enable you to do it.

75
00:04:49.433 --> 00:04:50.804
Keep it very, very lightweight.

76
00:04:50.804 --> 00:04:52.250
Don't spend a long time doing it.

77
00:04:52.250 --> 00:05:00.590
But people really appreciate personal
feedback on their particular website.

78
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.055
So offer that if they want it as
a thank you for completing the survey.

79
00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:10.369
In terms of creating a survey,
I happen to use an app called Forms.app,

80
00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:16.130
because it's easy to embed it in my
website, and it's not easy to customize.

81
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.388
But really, it's up to you,
you can use anything you want.

82
00:05:18.388 --> 00:05:22.947
I wouldn't use Google Forms
because they look damn ugly and

83
00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:28.517
we wanna integrate it into a landing page,
and yes, I would avoid that.

84
00:05:28.517 --> 00:05:29.930
But other than that, you're okay.

85
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.860
So what specifically to ask in your in
your survey with those caveats in mind.

86
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.602
So really you're after
questions that provide insights

87
00:05:42.602 --> 00:05:47.154
into the audience, and
what they're interested in.

88
00:05:47.154 --> 00:05:52.076
Or particularly who they are and how they
kinda fit into the broader structure.

89
00:05:52.076 --> 00:05:57.390
So a common question that I ask is,
who does your web team report into?

90
00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.623
Because what you're after,
right, I know that there

91
00:06:02.623 --> 00:06:07.745
are certain things that
people within organizations

92
00:06:07.745 --> 00:06:12.930
want to know about how
other organizations do it.

93
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.620
Does that make sense?

94
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.770
So one of them for example is,
are we reporting to IT?

95
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.872
I don't think that works very well,
is that common?

96
00:06:22.872 --> 00:06:27.760
So if my report can say,
only 23% of people reporting to IT,

97
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.262
then that's valuable to them.

98
00:06:30.262 --> 00:06:35.789
So it's questions about information
that your audience are interested

99
00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:40.420
in knowing and allows them to
compare themselves to others.

100
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.840
Questions that address the audience's
pain point in some way.

101
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.955
So a typical one would be,
do you have a dedicated budget?

102
00:06:47.955 --> 00:06:53.490
Because a lot of teams don't
have a dedicated budget.

103
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.080
They're at the whim of senior management.

104
00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.030
So that might be those kinds of
pain point questions, good to ask.

105
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.450
Questions about the company's
make up is quite useful,

106
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.878
mainly to allow you to segment
your results afterwards.

107
00:07:07.878 --> 00:07:09.260
So what do I mean by that?

108
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.739
So for example,
you could say 23% of companies

109
00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:17.469
with less than 100 employees do this,

110
00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:23.133
while 53% of companies with
over 100 employees do this.

111
00:07:23.133 --> 00:07:27.764
So asking them a little bit
about their company and

112
00:07:27.764 --> 00:07:31.299
what its structure is is worthwhile.

113
00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:35.495
And then questions relating to your area
of expertise or the services you offer.

114
00:07:35.495 --> 00:07:39.890
So when was the last time
you did a performance audit?

115
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:46.707
Do you run ongoing conversion
rate optimization?

116
00:07:46.707 --> 00:07:50.209
Do you have a design system for
managing your front-end code?

117
00:07:50.209 --> 00:07:51.234
Things like that.

118
00:07:53.615 --> 00:07:57.605
So you've decided on your 20 questions.

119
00:07:57.605 --> 00:08:00.254
You've got the additional at the end of,

120
00:08:00.254 --> 00:08:05.035
would you be willing to do an interview,
do you want this free site review?

121
00:08:05.035 --> 00:08:09.632
Now, we've gotta send that,
we've gotta get that to our audience, but

122
00:08:09.632 --> 00:08:14.454
what we're gonna do first is we're gonna
create a landing page to go with that

123
00:08:14.454 --> 00:08:15.584
survey, right?

124
00:08:15.584 --> 00:08:19.090
So we're gonna embed
the survey in a landing page.

125
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.678
Now in terms of what that
landing page is gonna cover,

126
00:08:22.678 --> 00:08:25.085
it's gonna explain the offering.

127
00:08:25.085 --> 00:08:26.555
Now, what do I mean by that?

128
00:08:26.555 --> 00:08:31.495
Well, we're gonna start that landing
page by clearly explaining what they

129
00:08:31.495 --> 00:08:33.665
get if they complete the survey.

130
00:08:33.665 --> 00:08:36.940
So something like, for
five minutes of your time,

131
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:42.424
you will get insider insights into charity
fundraising by getting our free report for

132
00:08:42.424 --> 00:08:45.870
your participation,
something along those lines.

133
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:51.732
We'll also emphasize the benefits
of completing the survey, or more

134
00:08:51.732 --> 00:08:57.805
specifically, the benefits of the final
report that will come out of the survey.

135
00:08:57.805 --> 00:09:02.956
Benefits could include an awareness of
the competitive landscape, evidence

136
00:09:02.956 --> 00:09:09.160
to support your requests to management,
and insights into areas of innovation.

137
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.259
So it's not necessarily the detail of
what the report is gonna cover but

138
00:09:12.259 --> 00:09:13.561
how it's gonna help people.

139
00:09:13.561 --> 00:09:18.634
It'll help me get my manager to
agree to give us a dedicated budget,

140
00:09:18.634 --> 00:09:21.127
for example, that kinda thing.

141
00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:22.621
Then there's the scope.

142
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:26.805
So landing page will say what
the final report is gonna cover.

143
00:09:26.805 --> 00:09:30.028
And that will be broadly based on the
kinds of questions that you're asking in

144
00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:30.580
the survey.

145
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.426
You don't need to get
into too much details.

146
00:09:32.426 --> 00:09:34.870
So you've got a bit of flexibility later.

147
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:39.732
And then finally a little bit,
this is where you can just now begin to

148
00:09:39.732 --> 00:09:44.353
introduce the idea of you and
your expertise and your services.

149
00:09:44.353 --> 00:09:49.296
You can say a little bit about why your
company is undertaking this research,

150
00:09:49.296 --> 00:09:52.350
all right, and
your experience in the sector.

151
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.393
So it's all very, very gentle, all right?

152
00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.960
What's the phrase?

153
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.773
Slowly slowly catchy monkey, which I never
really did understand that phrase or

154
00:10:04.773 --> 00:10:09.388
where it came from or what it means,
but apparently, the idea of going slow.

155
00:10:09.388 --> 00:10:11.910
Why you'd wanna catch a monkey,
don't get it.

156
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.293
So, in terms of designing
the landing page, look, basically,

157
00:10:15.293 --> 00:10:16.460
if you are a designer,

158
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.780
then you're gonna wanna design it yourself
cuz you wanna showcase the work you do.

159
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:25.399
But really, for anybody else,
you can just use a tool like Leadpage,

160
00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:30.257
Pages.net, there's an ample of these
kinda landing page creator tools

161
00:10:30.257 --> 00:10:35.140
out there where you just pick a template,
you can pop your stuff in there.

162
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.279
Try not to write reams of content, try and

163
00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:43.134
break it down into nice content
blocks that make it easy to scan.

164
00:10:43.134 --> 00:10:46.680
You don't need to say a lot, but
you do need to say a little bit.

165
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.640
Use lots of lists and icons if
possible to make it more scannable.

166
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.996
And don't repeat yourself too much or
overstate things.

167
00:10:54.996 --> 00:11:00.721
And then have that obvious call to
action start the survey, right?

168
00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:03.854
So we've got a little
landing page in place,

169
00:11:03.854 --> 00:11:08.643
don't spend too long on it, but
have it there with your survey in it.

170
00:11:08.643 --> 00:11:13.377
Either embedded actually in the page or
linked from it, whatever's easiest.
