00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.389
Let's talk about growing that list, cuz we
don't want it to be tiny forever, I mean,

2
00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:10.450
in actual fact, your subscribers are
the best way to grow your reach, right?

3
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.008
You wanna encourage your subscribers
to recommend your list to others and

4
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:19.641
to feel able to recommend your services
despite them not having personally

5
00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:21.274
worked with you, right?

6
00:00:21.274 --> 00:00:24.295
This is a really weird one,
normal word of mouth comes from, yeah,

7
00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:26.377
I've worked with this
guy he's really good.

8
00:00:26.377 --> 00:00:30.722
Most of my word of mouth recommendations
come from, here's a guy I've followed for

9
00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:32.445
ages he's really good, right?

10
00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:34.852
Most of them haven't
even worked with me but

11
00:00:34.852 --> 00:00:39.278
they still recommend me to other people,
so anything you can do to encourage your

12
00:00:39.278 --> 00:00:43.270
users to start spreading the word
about you, you should absolutely do.

13
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.750
So how do you do that?

14
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.368
How do you turn your users Into advocates,
your readers into advocates,

15
00:00:49.368 --> 00:00:51.850
well, connect with them, right?

16
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.570
Take opportunities to actually talk
with them, so you can do this in lots of

17
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.730
different ways, you can ask them questions
and get them to reply to you, right?

18
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.194
You can run surveys in your
emails from time to time,

19
00:01:03.194 --> 00:01:07.213
you could start debates,
I pick controversial subjects and

20
00:01:07.213 --> 00:01:11.650
let people argue it out with one
another in a in a safe environment.

21
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.322
I've got Slack channel where we do that,
and I'm the arbiter that says,

22
00:01:15.322 --> 00:01:17.524
[INAUDIBLE] no, you've gone too far there.

23
00:01:17.524 --> 00:01:22.575
[LAUGH] Ask for help, that's one of
the best ways of getting your audience to

24
00:01:22.575 --> 00:01:27.644
engage with you is by going, I'm stuck
on something, can anyone help me?

25
00:01:27.644 --> 00:01:32.097
It's amazing, cuz people love the idea
that after they've been getting advice

26
00:01:32.097 --> 00:01:34.727
from you for ages,
suddenly they can help you.

27
00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:40.315
So that's a really good way of connecting
with people, do meetups, right?

28
00:01:40.315 --> 00:01:45.209
I know it sounds stupid but after a while
you'll have a few followers, right?

29
00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:49.809
And okay, they might be spread
out over the world and so

30
00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:52.909
you can't do a in person meet up, but

31
00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.322
just start up a Zoom call
every two weeks over COVID.

32
00:01:57.322 --> 00:02:01.651
In fact was every week when COVID
was particularly bad, we just,

33
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:06.135
on a Friday afternoon, I'd open
a Zoom call up and invite people for

34
00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:09.300
my mailing list and
Slack channel and Twitter.

35
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.773
Come and hang out together, we've got
to know each other and it was great,

36
00:02:13.773 --> 00:02:18.609
just spent a bit time together, and get
them connecting with each other as well.

37
00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.489
So that's why I like having
a Slack channel where they can

38
00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.570
talk to one another, cuz there's this
great thing it's stupid story, right?

39
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.195
Let's say, I give a really silly example
of this cuz it's more entertaining,

40
00:02:30.195 --> 00:02:31.920
doing it this way.

41
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.440
Imagine we went out after this, we all
went out, we went to the pub, right?

42
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.540
We're sitting in the pub together,
and we're chatting and getting to know

43
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.190
one another, and I turn around and
I say, I collect paper clips, right?

44
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.794
Now, by this stage, you've had a couple
of pints you're quite relaxed with me,

45
00:02:53.794 --> 00:02:58.019
I know, maybe not cuz you're
nicer than British people, but

46
00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.350
I know you will mercilessly tease me for
that.

47
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.056
I mean, who collects paperclips, right?

48
00:03:04.056 --> 00:03:07.959
And so I'm then gonna get a bit shy and a
bit embarrassed that I clicked paper clips

49
00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.980
and I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.

50
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.001
Now imagine the same scenario, but

51
00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:19.054
when I say I collect paper clips,
Mark goes, you don't so do I, and

52
00:03:19.054 --> 00:03:25.250
then we start infusing together about
how cool it is to collect paper clips.

53
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.987
Now that's changed the dynamic all of
a sudden, we're reinforcing one another,

54
00:03:29.987 --> 00:03:34.127
and you too was sitting there going,
well perhaps paper clips are cool?

55
00:03:34.127 --> 00:03:37.429
I don't know,
am I missing something in here?

56
00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:42.332
And that's what happens when you
connect your followers to one another,

57
00:03:42.332 --> 00:03:47.311
they start reinforcing each other going,
I like Paul's work too, yeah,

58
00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:48.826
I find him inspiring.

59
00:03:48.826 --> 00:03:53.349
Fact that everybody finds me
inspiring just makes me giggle but

60
00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:59.165
I do get emails like that, so yeah,
they reinforce one another and it's great.

61
00:03:59.165 --> 00:04:03.269
So connecting users to one another,
you building their relationship is really

62
00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.718
important, the other thing
I do a lot is I try and

63
00:04:05.718 --> 00:04:08.810
show my appreciation to
those people that follow me.

64
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.875
I'm thanking people all the time,
I do giveaways, so,

65
00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:17.616
if ever I get offered free stuff,
I get a lot of people write to me and

66
00:04:17.616 --> 00:04:22.310
go, we want you to try out
this cool new app or whatever.

67
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.153
And so, which will happen as you get
a bit of an audience, and these days,

68
00:04:27.153 --> 00:04:31.340
I say, no, but
I'll give it away to somebody else, right?

69
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.208
It's great, free stuff for
people there on my mail list, why not?

70
00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:39.339
The other thing I do sometimes
is random acts of kindness, so

71
00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:43.875
if I got a bit of spare time,
which doesn't happen that often, but

72
00:04:43.875 --> 00:04:46.801
I'll drop out one of my mails also emails.

73
00:04:46.801 --> 00:04:49.119
I'll say, I've got bits free time,

74
00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:52.970
anybody need any help with
anything free a charge, all right?

75
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.216
And you'd think you'd getting inundated
with people going, yeah, yeah, but

76
00:04:58.216 --> 00:05:01.192
you don't, people very
sheepishly write to you and go,

77
00:05:01.192 --> 00:05:05.050
if you can spare me just a few minutes
to do this, and it's like, why not?

78
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.680
Why not help them out?

79
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.919
It's a nice thing to do, and then just
asking people how you can do better?

80
00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.731
What do they want help with?

81
00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:15.835
What are they struggling with?

82
00:05:15.835 --> 00:05:17.950
How can you be there for them?

83
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.890
So you can do that, and then finally, once
you've done those things, then you can

84
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.020
start encouraging referrals cuz you kind
of built a bit of social credit with them.

85
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.083
So you make your newsletter easy for
sharing for start, so,

86
00:05:30.083 --> 00:05:35.261
that's why all of my newsletter emails,
also make available as blog posts so

87
00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:38.863
that people can easily share
them with other people.

88
00:05:38.863 --> 00:05:43.317
You can do things or
offer commission and stuff,

89
00:05:43.317 --> 00:05:50.065
I'm not a massive fan of the idea of
commissions and if they refer people.

90
00:05:50.065 --> 00:05:55.828
But you can offer them something in
return, maybe, I've tried that before,

91
00:05:55.828 --> 00:06:00.718
but anything really, but
then oftentimes I just asked politely,

92
00:06:00.718 --> 00:06:04.933
can you help me out,
I'm really trying to grow the list.

93
00:06:04.933 --> 00:06:09.621
One of my favorites of all time that
I did [LAUGH] I can't believe I did

94
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:12.970
this on my list but
they were brilliant over it,

95
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.640
I wrote this is about honesty and
personality.

96
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.580
I wrote an email that said,
I'm coming up to the end of the month and

97
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.730
I really wanna buy myself a new camera,
right?

98
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.534
But my wife has told
me I'm not allowed it,

99
00:06:29.534 --> 00:06:35.027
unless I get over our agreed
target by the value of the camera,

100
00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:39.990
and I'm sure 800 pounds or
whatever it was.

101
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.306
Anybody willing to hire me for
800 [LAUGH] pounds so

102
00:06:44.306 --> 00:06:48.238
I could meet the target and
people did, right?

103
00:06:48.238 --> 00:06:52.039
They contacted me and said,
I'll take a couple of hours or

104
00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:56.710
an hour's worth of consultancy or
whatever, different things I did.

105
00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.642
Just from being honest and
asking nicely and

106
00:07:01.642 --> 00:07:07.115
with humanity rather than
being some sales bot.

107
00:07:07.115 --> 00:07:11.339
And then also you can occasionally, and
you got to word this in the right way, but

108
00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:14.213
you can ask people well,
why don't you recommend me?

109
00:07:14.213 --> 00:07:16.094
Am I doing something wrong?

110
00:07:16.094 --> 00:07:17.813
Is there something I
could be doing better?

111
00:07:17.813 --> 00:07:22.655
But you have to ask that in
a non accusatory way [LAUGH]

112
00:07:22.655 --> 00:07:25.479
you sound like a bit of an ass.

113
00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:32.055
Right, but obviously, there are loads
of other ways that you can build your

114
00:07:32.055 --> 00:07:38.035
list beyond just passively waiting for
your followers to refer you.

115
00:07:38.035 --> 00:07:42.639
You can do those search engine
optimized blog posts I talked about,

116
00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:45.305
you do the webinars we've discussed,

117
00:07:45.305 --> 00:07:49.533
you can do speaking podcast
guests that's a really good one.

118
00:07:49.533 --> 00:07:53.807
There's loads of podcasts,
they're constantly looking for

119
00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:58.010
guests, you've got something
good to talk about, why not?

120
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.038
You could do more cold emailing, you
could reach out to people individually,

121
00:08:02.038 --> 00:08:05.714
don't do bulk emails, don't buy a list or
anything stupid like that.

122
00:08:05.714 --> 00:08:09.314
But if there are a few people you
encounter that you really would like to

123
00:08:09.314 --> 00:08:10.910
connect with, that's okay.

124
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.992
There's obviously your social media,
there's community engagement as well,

125
00:08:16.992 --> 00:08:21.684
getting involved in things like that
higher education mailing list I mentioned,

126
00:08:21.684 --> 00:08:23.120
LinkedIn or Google Ads.

127
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.117
Now they're a little bit more worthwhile
considering because you've got a call

128
00:08:28.117 --> 00:08:32.453
to action that isn't just by me,
it's signed up for my mailing list so

129
00:08:32.453 --> 00:08:36.440
you can nurture that relationship,
promote the report, etc.

130
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:42.254
Guest posts, obviously I've talked about,
you could decide, okay,

131
00:08:42.254 --> 00:08:45.962
I'm done with that sector,
I'm not getting any further,

132
00:08:45.962 --> 00:08:50.460
let's try a different sector and
repeat the whole process.

133
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:54.343
And then finally you can do
the going generic approach, so

134
00:08:54.343 --> 00:08:59.255
I'm kinda now at the stage where I've
built my profile enough that is that

135
00:08:59.255 --> 00:09:02.362
I've got the sectors I
particularly target.

136
00:09:02.362 --> 00:09:06.399
But I do allow people to sign up
to my newsletter just Willy Nally

137
00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:10.450
not through a specific landing page or
from a specific sector.

138
00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:15.041
So a lot of my growth now actually
just comes from people stumbling

139
00:09:15.041 --> 00:09:19.980
across me through various means and
not through a specific campaign.

140
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.109
But I would leave you with this
when it comes to growing your list,

141
00:09:24.109 --> 00:09:27.120
don't abandon a sector too soon.

142
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.629
I see a lot of people kinda giving up
before just before they're about to make

143
00:09:31.629 --> 00:09:34.095
it, and it's frustrating to watch, and

144
00:09:34.095 --> 00:09:37.990
really it comes down to monitoring
what works and what doesn't.

145
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:44.569
So, for example, I'll be honest with
you guys that like I said at the end,

146
00:09:44.569 --> 00:09:48.769
you will go to a landing page
to get the slides from today and

147
00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:51.881
you can see an example
of the landing page.

148
00:09:51.881 --> 00:09:55.741
Landing pages I build on screen
now through Convert Kit, and

149
00:09:55.741 --> 00:09:57.719
I'll pay attention, right?

150
00:09:57.719 --> 00:10:03.598
So I'll look, how many did the finding
clients course lead people to sign up for

151
00:10:03.598 --> 00:10:04.925
my mailing list?

152
00:10:04.925 --> 00:10:09.576
And that wasn't as successful
as the design processes course,

153
00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:13.289
i'll probably focus on that
one a little bit more.

154
00:10:13.289 --> 00:10:17.869
Or hey front end masters is a really
good way of reaching people with a that

155
00:10:17.869 --> 00:10:21.640
leads to a lot of people signing up for
my mailing list.

156
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:27.040
[INAUDIBLE] Grovel to Mark and see if I
can persuade him to let me do another

157
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:33.353
course, things like that so really pay
attention to what works and what doesn't.

158
00:10:33.353 --> 00:10:38.176
So you're not wasting your time on
channels that don't really take

159
00:10:38.176 --> 00:10:39.283
you anywhere.

160
00:10:39.283 --> 00:10:44.242
And I think it's important that
we've kind of just before we move on

161
00:10:44.242 --> 00:10:47.722
to turning all of this
into an actual business,

162
00:10:47.722 --> 00:10:52.945
that we just look at remembering
that ultimately that ongoing Emails.

163
00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:57.768
That you're sending out every two
weeks needs to be appropriate to

164
00:10:57.768 --> 00:11:02.675
a broader audience than just your
initial group that you targeted,

165
00:11:02.675 --> 00:11:07.360
so you're gonna need to
segment your audience, right?

166
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.590
So what do I mean by that?

167
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:13.747
Well, for example, have separate forms,
so if you've got a landing page for

168
00:11:13.747 --> 00:11:18.594
charities, you'll have a separate
landing page for higher education,

169
00:11:18.594 --> 00:11:21.505
a separate landing page for whatever else.

170
00:11:21.505 --> 00:11:24.075
Heritage, whatever sectors, and so

171
00:11:24.075 --> 00:11:27.850
each one is gonna have its own
different landing page and

172
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:33.570
you can tag people based on which landing
pages you know which sector they're from.

173
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:36.210
So that allows you to kind
of segment your audience,

174
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.910
the other ways you can just ask people.

175
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.710
As I said earlier, on my own signup form,

176
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:46.035
I actually have a drop down list
that says, do you work in house?

177
00:11:46.035 --> 00:11:49.454
Do you work as part of an agency or
are you a freelancer?

178
00:11:49.454 --> 00:11:53.856
Because I tend to customize my content
a little bit around those different

179
00:11:53.856 --> 00:11:54.639
audiences.

180
00:11:54.639 --> 00:11:59.609
And the final thing I do is I actually
watch people not in a creepy stalkiry way,

181
00:11:59.609 --> 00:12:03.840
but I will know what they've clicked on,
for example in an email.

182
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.011
So what I can do is based
on what they click on,

183
00:12:07.011 --> 00:12:10.210
I will tag them with different subjects.

184
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:15.200
So if they're always looking at design
content, then I tagged them as probably

185
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:20.420
being designers and they might get some
customized content more specific to them.

186
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.953
In terms of how you actually
then customize their experience,

187
00:12:26.953 --> 00:12:28.970
how is it different?

188
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.788
Well, it's a couple of different ways,
one is they get different on boarding.

189
00:12:31.788 --> 00:12:36.907
So for example, that the email course that
somebody from charities receives will

190
00:12:36.907 --> 00:12:42.780
be different from the email course, that
somebody from higher education receives.

191
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:47.074
But also I will vary my emails
every once in a while as well, so

192
00:12:47.074 --> 00:12:51.287
basically that the emails might
get tailored based on their

193
00:12:51.287 --> 00:12:54.470
different interests or segmentations.

194
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:58.813
You could do that really easily with
an if statement [LAUGH] basically in

195
00:12:58.813 --> 00:13:03.522
Convert Kit, so this statement says if
you know a designer then write this,

196
00:13:03.522 --> 00:13:05.751
if it's anyone else they get this.

197
00:13:05.751 --> 00:13:10.951
So it's a really kind of easy way of just
being able to tailor those emails just

198
00:13:10.951 --> 00:13:15.834
a little bit, normally it's only one or
two paragraphs is different and

199
00:13:15.834 --> 00:13:18.973
they're basically
the same other than that.

200
00:13:18.973 --> 00:13:22.910
So that's it really, that's how you
grow your list, if you're feeling super

201
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:26.630
enthusiastic, you could take your
marketing to the next level.

202
00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:30.751
But this is for further down the line, but
I'll just throw it in here anyway to give

203
00:13:30.751 --> 00:13:33.550
you something to aim
towards in the future.

204
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:37.659
First thing I would say is get organized,
dedicate regular time to marketing and

205
00:13:37.659 --> 00:13:40.387
get better at tracking what works and
what doesn't.

206
00:13:40.387 --> 00:13:45.769
Start using a B testing, which I think
you mentioned at one point, an experiment

207
00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:50.980
to monitor the results and things like
that, in terms of dedicated time.

208
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:55.691
I'm now at the position,
you can get yourself into a virtuous

209
00:13:55.691 --> 00:14:00.402
cycle if you get it right, so
the more time you spend marketing

210
00:14:00.402 --> 00:14:05.402
the more people you attract
the higher your rates you can charge.

211
00:14:05.402 --> 00:14:10.012
Because you only need to convert
a small percentage of them, which means

212
00:14:10.012 --> 00:14:15.244
the higher your rates are, the less hours
you have to do with chargeable clients.

213
00:14:15.244 --> 00:14:19.758
Which allows more time for
marketing and you go round and

214
00:14:19.758 --> 00:14:25.137
round in circles, so my for example,
I'm in a situation now where

215
00:14:25.137 --> 00:14:30.250
my business is based on me
charging out phony 50% of my time.

216
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:35.860
So that means the other 50% time, I can
either use for doing boring admin stuff,

217
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.544
for marketing, or sitting around on
the beach if I really want to, but

218
00:14:39.544 --> 00:14:41.810
I tend to just pump it
more into marketing.

219
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.843
Be more ambitious work on bigger projects,

220
00:14:46.843 --> 00:14:49.946
eventually if you can churn
out a few of these reports and

221
00:14:49.946 --> 00:14:54.880
you're feeling more confident in your
writing, you might wanna look at books.

222
00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.827
You might wanna look at video courses or
workshops, these are really good

223
00:14:58.827 --> 00:15:03.110
at raising your profile because they've
got higher barrier to entry, right?

224
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.153
They're harder to do,
fewer people do them,

225
00:15:06.153 --> 00:15:11.750
therefore they're considered more
valuable, and then price higher, right?

226
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:15.249
As you see more work don't necessarily
just start hiring more people,

227
00:15:15.249 --> 00:15:18.110
which is what everybody
instinctively wants to do.

228
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:22.427
Instead raise your prices instead,
that allows more time for marketing and

229
00:15:22.427 --> 00:15:25.270
leads to that virtuous
cycle I was talking about.

230
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.861
So let's do a quick summary of that and

231
00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:32.200
then we'll take our last
break before we are done.

232
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.813
So growing your audience,
your checklist for this,

233
00:15:34.813 --> 00:15:37.893
includes setting aside regular
time to focus on marketing, so

234
00:15:37.893 --> 00:15:41.803
you're putting out your marketing
material regularly, Friday afternoons.

235
00:15:41.803 --> 00:15:46.224
Let's go to one with me, keep a list of
possible topics that you can write about,

236
00:15:46.224 --> 00:15:49.488
so that you're not starting
from a blank sheet every time.

237
00:15:49.488 --> 00:15:53.739
Don't be afraid to be yourself in your
emails, you are an amazing precious

238
00:15:53.739 --> 00:15:57.890
snowflake that's got something
unique to bring to the world.

239
00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.432
And I say that dripping with irony but

240
00:16:00.432 --> 00:16:05.030
at the same time I do totally mean
it from a marketing point of view.

241
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.217
Experiment to find the best way of adding
more people to your list some things will

242
00:16:10.217 --> 00:16:11.555
work better than others and

243
00:16:11.555 --> 00:16:14.309
don't be afraid to dump
something if it doesn't work.

244
00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:18.409
I'd podcast for
16 years and then went, no,

245
00:16:18.409 --> 00:16:22.827
this isn't working anymore and
stopped, right?

246
00:16:22.827 --> 00:16:27.623
Create a way for your audience to start
talking to one another and sharing, and

247
00:16:27.623 --> 00:16:29.296
consider alternatives and

248
00:16:29.296 --> 00:16:33.885
be more ambitious in your marketing
approach as you gain more confidence.
