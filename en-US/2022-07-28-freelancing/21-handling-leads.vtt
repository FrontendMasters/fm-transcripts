1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.564
So here we are, at the very last
section of the day, really,

2
00:00:04.564 --> 00:00:06.917
the critical one, [LAUGH] right?

3
00:00:06.917 --> 00:00:12.811
We've gone to all this effort to build a
mailing list, to nurture the relationships

4
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:18.360
with people to hang on, keeping them
engaged until they're ready to buy.

5
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.964
And the moment finally
comes when they email you.

6
00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:29.102
And they say, I've got a project,
I've got something I wanna do with you.

7
00:00:29.102 --> 00:00:35.777
Now, first thing to say about this is this
is gonna be an utterly different type of

8
00:00:35.777 --> 00:00:41.389
lead than any lead you have ever
had before, because they know you.

9
00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:43.111
They've built a relationship with you.

10
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:44.534
There is a rapport there already.

11
00:00:44.534 --> 00:00:47.180
You're not just another supplier.

12
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.934
They know you're an expert.

13
00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:50.621
You're in a great position.

14
00:00:50.621 --> 00:00:52.237
They're gonna be more interested.

15
00:00:52.237 --> 00:00:57.077
The client has come to you because
they're interested in working

16
00:00:57.077 --> 00:01:00.605
with you in particular,
and that is a big deal.

17
00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:03.485
Secondly, they're more informed,
all right?

18
00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:08.482
They have had weeks, months, maybe even
years of you informing them about best

19
00:01:08.482 --> 00:01:13.789
practices, teaching them about the way
you work, teaching them about your stuff.

20
00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:15.254
They know what they're gonna get.

21
00:01:15.254 --> 00:01:16.916
They know how you can help.

22
00:01:16.916 --> 00:01:18.489
They're really well informed.

23
00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:20.694
And finally, they're gonna be more open.

24
00:01:20.694 --> 00:01:25.902
The leads will come to you earlier so that
decisions won't have already been made.

25
00:01:25.902 --> 00:01:30.746
And they're gonna be more open to hearing
about your opinion of the best approach,

26
00:01:30.746 --> 00:01:33.734
because they're used to
getting advice from you.

27
00:01:33.734 --> 00:01:37.163
So these are the perfect leads, all right?

28
00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:42.727
They're such a pleasure to work with, and
people that come to you out of the blue.

29
00:01:42.727 --> 00:01:45.958
So you're gonna get people coming to you.

30
00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.240
But that last one,

31
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.061
that one about them coming to you
earlier does create a slight problem.

32
00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:56.000
Sometimes they come to you so
early, right, that actually,

33
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.817
there isn't a formal project in place yet.

34
00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:05.184
And so that lead needs to be nurtured and
taken all the way through.

35
00:02:05.184 --> 00:02:08.823
So what that means is that we need
to get organized with our leads,

36
00:02:08.823 --> 00:02:12.081
because a lead is gonna come
to you earlier in the process.

37
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:16.595
It may take a lot longer before it
becomes a deal that can be closed.

38
00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:19.134
And so you need a system to manage that.

39
00:02:19.134 --> 00:02:26.156
You need a CRM,
a Customer Relationship Management system.

40
00:02:26.156 --> 00:02:30.341
Now, this is normally the kind of thing
that big organizations have, right?

41
00:02:30.341 --> 00:02:34.302
They have things like Salesforce,
and all these big things.

42
00:02:34.302 --> 00:02:37.146
I'm not talking about anything like that,
because obviously,

43
00:02:37.146 --> 00:02:38.601
that's not appropriate for us.

44
00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:43.463
But we need a CRM because we
need a method of tracking every

45
00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:45.905
conversation that we have.

46
00:02:45.905 --> 00:02:51.086
Even if it's not an official request for
proposal, and a way of nurturing those

47
00:02:51.086 --> 00:02:56.209
conversations all the way through to
them being full blown projects, right?

48
00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.055
So that's why we need them.

49
00:02:58.055 --> 00:03:02.924
In terms of what we need that CRM to do,
we need to be able to create

50
00:03:02.924 --> 00:03:07.904
some deals in it that are tied to
individuals in an organization.

51
00:03:07.904 --> 00:03:11.649
Because you may have multiple
deals with multiple people within

52
00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.114
the same organization.

53
00:03:13.114 --> 00:03:17.420
You need to be able to assign tasks and
reminders to those deals for

54
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.700
you to follow it up.

55
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.275
You need to be able to add notes to
remind you, because it may be a month,

56
00:03:24.275 --> 00:03:27.500
two months,
six months between conversations.

57
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.300
So you need the ability to add notes
of where you're at with those deals.

58
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.401
And you also need to be able to
see all of those emails that

59
00:03:37.401 --> 00:03:41.610
you've ever had about that
deal held in a central place.

60
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:43.470
So not a lot then.

61
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.320
So what do I use to achieve all of that?

62
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.792
Well, personally,
I use a tool called Pipedrive, okay?

63
00:03:50.792 --> 00:03:55.648
And Pipedrive is a really powerful
tool that allows me to organize all

64
00:03:55.648 --> 00:03:58.996
of my different deals,
see where they're at,

65
00:03:58.996 --> 00:04:03.539
be regularly prompted to follow
them up and interact with them.

66
00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:07.400
And basically,
you can organize it in a couple of ways.

67
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.213
One is that you can organize your deals
on how likely they are to come off.

68
00:04:13.213 --> 00:04:17.071
So whether they're almost signed, or
whether they're just possible, or

69
00:04:17.071 --> 00:04:17.924
whatever else.

70
00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:23.720
And also, and this is a really useful
view for me as an independent consultant,

71
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.021
is I can see when they're
likely to come off.

72
00:04:27.021 --> 00:04:32.988
So that I can start organizing my cash
flow and organize my projects in terms

73
00:04:32.988 --> 00:04:39.443
of ensuring that I'm capable of delivering
them, because I am just one person.

74
00:04:39.443 --> 00:04:42.998
So let's talk a little bit
about using your CRM and

75
00:04:42.998 --> 00:04:48.006
making it a powerful tool to deal
with these inquiries as they come in.

76
00:04:48.006 --> 00:04:53.714
First of all, every person who reaches
out to you needs to go into your CRM,

77
00:04:53.714 --> 00:04:55.901
even if it's not a project.

78
00:04:55.901 --> 00:05:00.385
So every time someone from my
mailing lists drops me an email, or

79
00:05:00.385 --> 00:05:04.385
anybody else drops me an email,
they'll go into my CRM.

80
00:05:04.385 --> 00:05:07.799
Secondly, I will follow
up on every conversation,

81
00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:09.825
even if it's just a question.

82
00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:14.090
So if somebody's dropped me an email say,

83
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.101
in your last group email,
you wrote about so and so, and

84
00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:26.268
so and so, I've got a question about it,
can you help me, and I reply, right?

85
00:05:26.268 --> 00:05:29.640
That's not the end of the conversation,
as far as I'm concerned.

86
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.494
I will set a task to in a week,
a month whatever I feel is

87
00:05:33.494 --> 00:05:38.230
appropriate to drop them a follow up and
say did that advice help?

88
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.190
How did it go?

89
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.011
What turned out?

90
00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:43.742
Because often it's a question about,
well, at my company,

91
00:05:43.742 --> 00:05:46.481
we've got this issue at the moment, right?

92
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:49.399
So you follow up and
say so how did that go?

93
00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:52.446
Did it help?

94
00:05:52.446 --> 00:05:53.916
So follow up questions.

95
00:05:53.916 --> 00:05:58.870
But probably the most important
use of your CRM is to basically

96
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.735
do something that my dad taught me.

97
00:06:01.735 --> 00:06:06.014
My dad works in sales,
or did work in sales.

98
00:06:06.014 --> 00:06:10.067
And he gave me a piece of advice
when I first started my business,

99
00:06:10.067 --> 00:06:13.746
which has been absolutely
invaluable through my career,

100
00:06:13.746 --> 00:06:16.692
which is to pursue every
lead to destruction.

101
00:06:16.692 --> 00:06:20.272
So what he meant by that
is follow up every project,

102
00:06:20.272 --> 00:06:26.010
every inquiry until they say no,
we don't wanna work with you, right?

103
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.399
One of the biggest mistakes I see
people make when they get an inquiry

104
00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:33.790
is they respond to it, and
then don't follow it up.

105
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.653
Instead, you need a way of
consistently following up

106
00:06:39.653 --> 00:06:44.434
with somebody until they
eventually say no, right?

107
00:06:44.434 --> 00:06:47.602
So how do I go about doing that,
and how do I use my CRM for that?

108
00:06:47.602 --> 00:06:53.986
Well basically, let's say I've got
an inquiry through, and I write a reply.

109
00:06:53.986 --> 00:07:00.710
A week later, I will get a reminder in
Pipedrive, my CRM, to follow them up.

110
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.972
So I'll drop them a follow up and say do
you have any questions about what I said?

111
00:07:03.972 --> 00:07:05.760
How's it going?

112
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.819
If I don't hear back from them, in two
weeks, I'll drop them another email and

113
00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:15.898
go, I've just realized I never heard
back from you, is everything all right?

114
00:07:15.898 --> 00:07:17.117
Are there any questions I can answer?

115
00:07:17.117 --> 00:07:19.279
I'm here to help.

116
00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:24.066
If I still don't hear back from them
after four weeks, I'll drop them another

117
00:07:24.066 --> 00:07:28.939
email going, whatever happened to that
conversation we were having, right?

118
00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:32.439
If I don't hear from them after 4 weeks,

119
00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:37.339
they'll get an email after 8,
and then 16, and so on,

120
00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:42.652
forever and ever and ever and
ever, right, until they say no.

121
00:07:42.652 --> 00:07:47.444
And you might think, wow,
Paul, that's a bit hardcore.

122
00:07:47.444 --> 00:07:55.374
But it's paid off, because I've got
a reason to keep going back to them.

123
00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:58.370
Now, oftentimes,
they come back to me, obviously.

124
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.221
Very rarely do I get beyond about eight
weeks before somebody drops me a line.

125
00:08:03.221 --> 00:08:07.596
And then they'll say something like,
we're not quite there yet,

126
00:08:07.596 --> 00:08:11.123
or this has got delayed to
the next quarter, or whatever.

127
00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:14.701
And I say absolutely fine, completely
understand, these things take time.

128
00:08:14.701 --> 00:08:20.168
I'll drop you an email next quarter,
and so I add a reminder in to do that.

129
00:08:20.168 --> 00:08:23.978
So every email has to be
carefully followed up.

130
00:08:23.978 --> 00:08:27.852
And you might think, well,
are you banging against a closed door?

131
00:08:27.852 --> 00:08:29.923
Are you wasting your time?

132
00:08:29.923 --> 00:08:37.877
No, so often, these emails turn into
something eventually, so often.

133
00:08:37.877 --> 00:08:40.301
And I often get emails back
going you know what, Paul,

134
00:08:40.301 --> 00:08:42.367
I'm really grateful you
kept pursuing this.

135
00:08:42.367 --> 00:08:45.206
It kept getting pushed down my list, and

136
00:08:45.206 --> 00:08:49.639
I never got around to it, but
your emails reminded me, right?

137
00:08:49.639 --> 00:08:53.329
So don't be afraid,
very rarely do you annoy people.

138
00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:58.910
And I often adopt a very
apologetic tone in them as well.

139
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.615
I'll say look,
I don't wanna annoy you, but

140
00:09:02.615 --> 00:09:06.130
I don't wanna seem disinterested either.

141
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:10.378
And it is about showing genuine
interest in their project and

142
00:09:10.378 --> 00:09:12.386
what they're trying to do.

143
00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:17.046
Give them permission to tell you to stop.

144
00:09:17.046 --> 00:09:20.927
Say look, if I'm annoying you,
just drop me an email, let me know.

145
00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:22.738
I don't wanna annoy you.

146
00:09:22.738 --> 00:09:24.856
But I don't wanna give up,

147
00:09:24.856 --> 00:09:30.945
because this looks like a really
interesting project, and show an interest.

148
00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:33.820
Okay, so
there's a bit about how I use my CRM.

149
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.861
Let's talk a little bit about how

150
00:09:36.861 --> 00:09:41.755
to engage with a new lead
when they first contact you.

151
00:09:41.755 --> 00:09:44.841
So somebody dropped you an email says

152
00:09:44.841 --> 00:09:48.818
I got this project that
we're thinking about doing.

153
00:09:48.818 --> 00:09:52.325
Is this the kind of thing that
you might be able to help with?

154
00:09:52.325 --> 00:09:55.477
I often get emails like,
do you do this kind of thing?

155
00:09:55.477 --> 00:10:00.455
Because I've never come out explicitly and
said these are the services I offer, but

156
00:10:00.455 --> 00:10:02.290
they still contact me anyway.

157
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.030
So first of all,
I'll arrange a call as soon as possible.

158
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:11.633
Speaking to somebody over Zoom instantly
builds a relationship that you just

159
00:10:11.633 --> 00:10:14.040
cannot build in the same way via email.

160
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.530
So get them on a Zoom call,
get them talking.

161
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:21.337
I use a tool called Calendarly to let them
book a meeting in themselves without that

162
00:10:21.337 --> 00:10:26.120
endless backwards and
forwards over trying to arrange your time.

163
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.390
Second, I try and
understand their challenge.

164
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:34.030
And on that call,
I will help them in any way I can, right?

165
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:38.254
So I'll let them pick my brain,
I'll give them all the advice I can.

166
00:10:38.254 --> 00:10:40.189
I don't hold back anything.

167
00:10:40.189 --> 00:10:43.554
And some people do abuse that.

168
00:10:43.554 --> 00:10:46.726
Occasionally I get people
that will basically ask for

169
00:10:46.726 --> 00:10:51.237
a call, have a load of advice, getting
hours free consultancy from me, and

170
00:10:51.237 --> 00:10:53.507
I never hear from them again, right?

171
00:10:53.507 --> 00:10:56.244
But they're the minority,
most people are pretty good.

172
00:10:56.244 --> 00:11:02.988
They don't like to abuse your time, and so
I will give them as much advice as I can.

173
00:11:02.988 --> 00:11:03.763
I'm there to help.

174
00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:05.698
If they hire me, that's a bonus.

175
00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:08.784
They almost always do.

176
00:11:08.784 --> 00:11:12.945
Then I will actually on that
call discuss budget, right?

177
00:11:12.945 --> 00:11:17.879
And the reason I discuss that is because I
can very much tailor what I provide based

178
00:11:17.879 --> 00:11:20.286
on the budget they've got available.

179
00:11:20.286 --> 00:11:24.873
So I ask the client if they've
got any budgetary constraints.

180
00:11:24.873 --> 00:11:29.140
If they say they don't,
that's normally a lie.

181
00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.851
Not necessarily a conscious lie,

182
00:11:30.851 --> 00:11:34.339
it's just it's their way of saying
I haven't thought about budget.

183
00:11:34.339 --> 00:11:36.637
But in truth, they've got constraints.

184
00:11:36.637 --> 00:11:41.323
So what I do is I start throwing around
some numbers and gauge their reaction.

185
00:11:41.323 --> 00:11:43.169
So they'll say, we don't have a budget.

186
00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:46.745
And I say, so if I came back with
a million and a half project,

187
00:11:46.745 --> 00:11:48.298
you're happy with that?

188
00:11:48.298 --> 00:11:52.031
No [SOUND], 50,000?

189
00:11:52.031 --> 00:11:53.746
No, we could probably do 50,000.

190
00:11:53.746 --> 00:11:54.822
What about 100,000?

191
00:11:54.822 --> 00:11:57.906
[SOUND] And so you're beginning
to kinda narrow it down and

192
00:11:57.906 --> 00:12:00.164
just have a frank conversation about it.

193
00:12:00.164 --> 00:12:05.504
And the way I do is I say it's
a bit like buying a house, right?

194
00:12:05.504 --> 00:12:10.412
The first thing an estate agent is
gonna ask you, or real estate, or

195
00:12:10.412 --> 00:12:14.815
whatever you call them,
is how much can you afford to spend?

196
00:12:14.815 --> 00:12:19.638
Because even if you say you
want a three bedroom house

197
00:12:19.638 --> 00:12:24.692
that's detached in a nice area,
well, okay, then.

198
00:12:24.692 --> 00:12:29.276
But the price could still will vary
wildly depending on what other

199
00:12:29.276 --> 00:12:33.208
facilities it's got,
what condition it's in, etc.

200
00:12:33.208 --> 00:12:34.315
So without a budget,

201
00:12:34.315 --> 00:12:38.140
you've got no framework within which
to work to suggest a good solution.

202
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.093
So I always discuss budget up front.

203
00:12:41.093 --> 00:12:44.831
The other thing I'd say is don't be afraid
to challenge in these conversations.

204
00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:47.484
If a client comes to you saying
they want a mobile app, and

205
00:12:47.484 --> 00:12:49.989
you think that's a terrible idea,
tell them it's.

206
00:12:49.989 --> 00:12:52.031
Well, don't tell them
it's a terrible idea.

207
00:12:52.031 --> 00:12:56.013
But say, well,
have you considered doing this instead?

208
00:12:56.013 --> 00:12:59.789
If you disagree with their suggestions,
it's okay to say so.

209
00:12:59.789 --> 00:13:04.589
Be a peer and an advisor,
not a supplier, right?

210
00:13:04.589 --> 00:13:09.745
And the reason you can get away with that
is because you've been their peer and

211
00:13:09.745 --> 00:13:15.400
advisor for weeks, or months, or years,
as they've read your stuff, all right?

212
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.826
They want you to come up with ideas.

213
00:13:17.826 --> 00:13:21.647
They're expecting the same from
you that they've been reading.

214
00:13:21.647 --> 00:13:24.960
So that's how I go about engaging
with leads as they come in.
