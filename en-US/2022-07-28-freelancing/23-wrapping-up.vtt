1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.860
Time for call to action, isn't it?

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.290
Time for me to have my signup form.

3
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.370
So you can download the slides and

4
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.770
you don't need to sign up
to anything to do this.

5
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.360
Go download the slides at
subscribe.boagworld.com/findclients.

6
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.431
If you wanna sign up for my newsletter as
well, you know exactly what you're gonna

7
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:23.619
get by this stage [LAUGH] of things but
that's entirely up to you.

8
00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.414
The slides have got all of
the information we've talked about,

9
00:00:26.414 --> 00:00:28.230
they've got links in it.

10
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.875
And I really wanna emphasize that at any
stage even if you're watching this four

11
00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:37.239
five years from now, if you've got
a question, drop me an email, my email

12
00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.280
address is in the slide so every question
there's a link to my email address.

13
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.916
I'm more than happy to answer questions
because I know how much anxiety

14
00:00:46.916 --> 00:00:50.570
finding clients and
keeping work coming in can be.

15
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.286
And to be honest, I've had moments
in my life where it's really damaged

16
00:00:55.286 --> 00:00:59.925
my mental health and I don't wanna
see anybody else in that position and

17
00:00:59.925 --> 00:01:02.031
if I can help, I honestly will.

18
00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:06.615
Talking of questions, we got any
final questions before we wrap up for

19
00:01:06.615 --> 00:01:10.670
today, I would love to deal with
them now if you've got them.

20
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.990
&gt;&gt; Are there any thoughts whether
freelancers should do their

21
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.660
website on a domain named after
themselves or after their own company?

22
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.754
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm probably the worst person
in the world to ask this question from.

23
00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:35.160
Yeah, inadvertently I've managed to
build a brand name on Boagworld.

24
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.790
How egotistical does that sound, right?

25
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.700
How did that happen?

26
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.299
That was such a mess up.

27
00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.745
It was supposed to be just a personal
site and it kind of escalated and

28
00:01:45.745 --> 00:01:48.560
before I knew it, now it's my brand name.

29
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.390
Well, here's the thing,
it depends on your aspirations.

30
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.927
If you intend to build an agency one day,
if you tend to take on multiple employees

31
00:01:57.927 --> 00:02:02.010
then you might wanna consider
one that's not around your name.

32
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.340
The one thing that you should definitely,

33
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.720
definitely not do is to pretend to
be something you're not, right?

34
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.103
And what do I mean by that?

35
00:02:12.103 --> 00:02:19.289
I despise with a passion freelancers
who use the word we, right?

36
00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.510
When it's just one person, okay?

37
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.216
There is this perception that to
attract big clients you need to be

38
00:02:27.216 --> 00:02:30.496
a big agency and
that is complete BS, right?

39
00:02:30.496 --> 00:02:35.153
I work with UNICEF,
I work with European Commission,

40
00:02:35.153 --> 00:02:38.290
I work with PUMA, I work with Shell,

41
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:45.060
all of these massive companies and
it's just me on my tod, all right?

42
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.010
That has nothing to do with it.

43
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.167
If you are a single person,
an independent freelancer or

44
00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:56.014
consultant just like I am,
be honest, there's no shame in that,

45
00:02:56.014 --> 00:03:00.440
in fact there's a lot of
benefits to being that, okay?

46
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.687
For a start, one of the things that
companies hate is they hire an agency and

47
00:03:05.687 --> 00:03:09.160
they end up with the billy staff, right?

48
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.810
When they hire you, they get you and
that's a great selling point.

49
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.846
Whether or not that domain name is your
name or not, that doesn't really matter,

50
00:03:17.846 --> 00:03:19.730
that's a toss up whatever you fancy.

51
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.946
I think if you're intending maybe
to one day grow into an agency,

52
00:03:22.946 --> 00:03:25.170
it's probably better to avoid it.

53
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.160
But on the other hand, it's quite nice,
it's quite personal if it's your own name.

54
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.566
So I haven't really
answered the question but

55
00:03:32.566 --> 00:03:36.410
hopefully there's a few
thoughts in there worth having.

56
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.260
Any others come out?

57
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.475
&gt;&gt; Do you ever find that
maybe getting work or

58
00:03:41.475 --> 00:03:46.157
having a job disrupts the process
of making a survey or a report or

59
00:03:46.157 --> 00:03:49.730
extrapolating out of those
to get your content?

60
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; How do you manage those?

61
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.430
&gt;&gt; That's a really good question cuz yes,
it would.

62
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.260
Yeah, it does.

63
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.670
So it's a tricky one because there
are certain things that you can leave gaps

64
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.830
between and
there's certain things you can't.

65
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.259
Once you've first reached
out to your audience,

66
00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:13.111
that cold list,
you have to move relatively quickly to

67
00:04:13.111 --> 00:04:19.280
delivering the report because
otherwise they go cold, right?

68
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.100
So your first email needs to go out
then maybe two weeks later, the survey

69
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.430
needs to go out and then maybe a month
later, the report needs to be there.

70
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.945
So in that period of time, you really
need to pick a period where you know

71
00:04:33.945 --> 00:04:38.130
you're gonna be free and
gonna be able to do this, right?

72
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.073
So that might be that you book it out
from client work which I know is really

73
00:04:43.073 --> 00:04:45.370
hard to turn away.

74
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.866
Maybe it's you take a holiday for
that length of time,

75
00:04:48.866 --> 00:04:53.806
maybe it's you pick a time where you
know it's gonna be nothing much goes on,

76
00:04:53.806 --> 00:04:57.460
whatever, but
that bit you can't really split up.

77
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.779
Everything else really can be fitted
around normal client work cuz after

78
00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:06.453
that you're talking about guest posts,
you're talking about interviews,

79
00:05:06.453 --> 00:05:10.163
these are just one of little
things that can be done whenever.

80
00:05:10.163 --> 00:05:14.800
And you can grow your list at
whatever speed you can afford to do.

81
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.518
The only thing that
obviously needs to be set

82
00:05:17.518 --> 00:05:22.380
is your email to go out every fortnight or
every month, wherever is possible.

83
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.120
So it's just that first bit that really
you can't let client work get in

84
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.991
the way of, which I haven't
found a way around that yet but

85
00:05:30.991 --> 00:05:34.324
it is a weakness because
I know that's hard to do.

86
00:05:34.324 --> 00:05:39.412
&gt;&gt; Have you thought about
doing outsourcing because you

87
00:05:39.412 --> 00:05:45.300
are outsourcing by using these
tools that you have in a sense.

88
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.179
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Have you thought about actually having

89
00:05:48.179 --> 00:05:52.691
a list of other freelancers that
you reach out to do some of your,

90
00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:57.706
could be even just maintaining these
things that you do like tracking,

91
00:05:57.706 --> 00:05:59.985
analyzing your surveys and-.

92
00:05:59.985 --> 00:06:03.546
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's quite a lot of
opportunities if you wanted to go down

93
00:06:03.546 --> 00:06:04.440
that route.

94
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.895
I'm a bit of a control freak and
also I'm fortunate that I've got

95
00:06:08.895 --> 00:06:12.550
enough space in my business
to be able to do it myself.

96
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.352
For a start, all that boring
research at the beginning of

97
00:06:17.352 --> 00:06:21.454
making the list of companies and
influencers and

98
00:06:21.454 --> 00:06:26.971
all that kind of stuff, I have been
known to get my wife to do that.

99
00:06:26.971 --> 00:06:31.532
She kind of volunteered [LAUGH], so
I guess I outsourced that a little bit,

100
00:06:31.532 --> 00:06:36.475
that's a great one, anybody could do that,
you could get student doing that.

101
00:06:36.475 --> 00:06:40.360
Equally getting email addresses and
all that kind of stuff.

102
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.720
Any contact with the client I wouldn't
outsource or people in the list so

103
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.433
your emails, your newsletters,
all that kind of stuff.

104
00:06:46.433 --> 00:06:49.090
Landing page,
you could outsource that if you wanted to.

105
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.690
If you're not a good designer
it makes sense to do that.

106
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.835
Your kind of analytics,
maybe you could do that.

107
00:06:56.835 --> 00:07:01.001
Social media updates, getting someone
to take content from your report and

108
00:07:01.001 --> 00:07:04.200
turn it in social media updates,
you can outsource that.

109
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.831
So yeah, absolutely,
if you wanna go down that route.

110
00:07:08.831 --> 00:07:15.560
I just think it depends on how much cash
you've got to do that kind of thing.

111
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.198
A lot of freelancers are a bit
tight on their cash flow and so

112
00:07:19.198 --> 00:07:22.922
don't really wanna do that but
an agency certainly could.

113
00:07:22.922 --> 00:07:24.111
So yeah, it's an option.

114
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.875
Any more questions from chat or
should we call it a day?

115
00:07:27.875 --> 00:07:32.169
&gt;&gt; Any advice to younger freelancers or

116
00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:38.685
advice you would give yourself
earlier in your career?

117
00:07:38.685 --> 00:07:43.080
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,
I get asked this question all the time.

118
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:48.657
And I was kinda talking about
this earlier because I'm actually

119
00:07:48.657 --> 00:07:56.210
the worst person to ask that question of
cuz I started in my career in 1994, right?

120
00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:03.290
So any experiences that I learned then
are definitely not relevant today.

121
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:09.228
Unlike anything I know now, I'm so
skewed by all my years of experience and

122
00:08:09.228 --> 00:08:14.792
my well established business at
the moment that actually my advice for

123
00:08:14.792 --> 00:08:20.844
a freelancer probably isn't particularly
useful for a young freelancer.

124
00:08:20.844 --> 00:08:25.156
I will give the same advice that I gave
earlier, I think it was in a break or

125
00:08:25.156 --> 00:08:29.005
over lunch which is that,
if you are just starting out, right?

126
00:08:29.005 --> 00:08:32.530
Maybe you've just done a boot camp or
you're very early on in your career.

127
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:36.440
My advice is not to jump
straight into freelancing, right?

128
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.763
My advice is first of all, spend even
just a year working for an agency and

129
00:08:41.763 --> 00:08:46.668
see how they do things even if
they're a terrible agency, right?

130
00:08:46.668 --> 00:08:50.087
You will learn loads about
how not to do it and

131
00:08:50.087 --> 00:08:55.448
you'll get exposed to these kinds of
soft skills and the kind of stuff

132
00:08:55.448 --> 00:09:00.550
that you don't think about when
you set up a freelance business.

133
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:04.730
You just think, well, I can build a
website so I can run a freelance business.

134
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.100
Yeah, but can you sell yourself?

135
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.080
Can you deal with clients?

136
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.580
Can you do project management?

137
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.690
Can you do finances, right?

138
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:14.049
That took me by surprise [LAUGH].

139
00:09:14.049 --> 00:09:17.918
How complicated that was when I went by
myself cuz when I ran an agency I had

140
00:09:17.918 --> 00:09:22.510
a partner that dealt with all of that and
so that came as a real shock to me.

141
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:27.267
So take a bit of time in an agency
before jumping into freelance,

142
00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:30.450
that's really the only advice I can give.

143
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:36.043
I guess another piece of
advice I'd give myself is,

144
00:09:36.043 --> 00:09:41.148
don't spend too much time
learning the latest framework or

145
00:09:41.148 --> 00:09:45.232
the latest design tool or
the latest whatever,

146
00:09:45.232 --> 00:09:48.518
they come and go really fast, right?

147
00:09:48.518 --> 00:09:50.995
What doesn't change is people.

148
00:09:50.995 --> 00:09:52.826
People are always the same.

149
00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:57.279
So spend your time,
I'm not saying don't learn the technology,

150
00:09:57.279 --> 00:10:02.529
of course you've gotta learn technology
and Frontend Masters is an excellent

151
00:10:02.529 --> 00:10:07.075
source of advice on all the technology
you could ever want to learn.

152
00:10:07.075 --> 00:10:12.426
But in addition to learning that stuff,
don't forget to learn the soft skills,

153
00:10:12.426 --> 00:10:15.652
don't forget to learn how
to deal with clients,

154
00:10:15.652 --> 00:10:20.430
how to build relationships with
colleagues, all of those things.

155
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.050
Those are the things that last and
don't change.

156
00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.150
Technology will come and go.

157
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.850
So yeah, just bear that in mind.

158
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.250
&gt;&gt; I feel like sharing my own experience.

159
00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:31.670
&gt;&gt; Go for it, yeah, do it.

160
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:32.930
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] this.

161
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.228
In the early stages, I always worked for

162
00:10:36.228 --> 00:10:40.016
pennies on the dollar
just to get experience.

163
00:10:40.016 --> 00:10:40.699
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

164
00:10:40.699 --> 00:10:45.537
&gt;&gt; And so I did a ton of websites for
cheap under selling myself.

165
00:10:45.537 --> 00:10:50.966
However when I did get a full time
job again, I was underpaid but

166
00:10:50.966 --> 00:10:55.730
I did learn a lot at an agency
building a lot of things.

167
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:56.291
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And

168
00:10:56.291 --> 00:11:02.000
then to take the leap what I did was,
I got a 20-hour week contract.

169
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That would essentially cover my

170
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.650
living expenses.

171
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.442
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then from there I would try to get

172
00:11:12.442 --> 00:11:18.450
the high paying work which I eventually
replaced that 20 hours a week with.

173
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.206
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Once that was up and

174
00:11:20.206 --> 00:11:25.093
I had more work flowing then I was
continually kind of like climbing

175
00:11:25.093 --> 00:11:29.107
that ladder of increasing my rate,
getting better and

176
00:11:29.107 --> 00:11:33.052
better projects and
no longer under selling myself.

177
00:11:33.052 --> 00:11:37.588
But it took a lot of work in the early
stages to get the reputation and

178
00:11:37.588 --> 00:11:42.529
the skills to be able to manage even at
kind of a lower where we were getting

179
00:11:42.529 --> 00:11:45.620
paid $10 an hour or peanuts or whatever.

180
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; For a long time but anyways.

181
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.337
&gt;&gt; That idea of of taking
a 20-hour contract, so

182
00:11:51.337 --> 00:11:57.550
don't jump into freelancing with both
feet overnight cuz that's terrifying.

183
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.479
But actually to do it more gradually
I think it's excellent advice,

184
00:12:01.479 --> 00:12:03.710
totally agree with that.

185
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:06.860
I think on those words of wisdom
from Mark, we should finish simply.

186
00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.760
Thank very much for watching this course.

187
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:14.745
Hope you found it useful and good luck
with your future career and direction.

188
00:12:14.745 --> 00:12:18.150
