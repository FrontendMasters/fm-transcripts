1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.110
So let's look at each of those
stages in our basic sales funnel.

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.714
First, is attract attention, we got to
grab people's attention, all right?

3
00:00:07.714 --> 00:00:12.600
So first we need to identify who
we wanna make contact with, right?

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.363
Who is the audience, okay?

5
00:00:15.363 --> 00:00:20.274
And then we need to work out
how we're gonna contact them

6
00:00:20.274 --> 00:00:24.154
without actually selling to them, right?

7
00:00:24.154 --> 00:00:27.435
We're not gonna sell to them because
they're not gonna be ready to buy.

8
00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:33.022
The chance of us emailing them exactly the
moment that they're ready to buy is pretty

9
00:00:33.022 --> 00:00:38.840
near zero, which is why cold calling and
things like that don't work very well.

10
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.689
So instead, we're gonna approach
them with another thing in mind but

11
00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:43.740
we'll get into that more.

12
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.039
Instead, right, what we're gonna
do is we're gonna approach them,

13
00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:51.708
we're gonna approach people and
these will be cold emails.

14
00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:57.104
These is where I do personalized one
to one emails to certain people.

15
00:00:57.104 --> 00:00:59.680
I'm not gonna try and sell them anything.

16
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.960
Instead, I'm gonna approach them and
say that you want their help,

17
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.500
right, because that's not sales email.

18
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.612
You don't get emails from sales
companies going, can you help us,

19
00:01:12.612 --> 00:01:15.371
in a very personal way,
it's not like that.

20
00:01:15.371 --> 00:01:20.272
We're gonna approach them in a very non
threatening way, we're gonna ask them for

21
00:01:20.272 --> 00:01:24.694
their help and their feedback for
some research that we're carrying out.

22
00:01:24.694 --> 00:01:31.146
Then later on, we're gonna introduce them
to something we're gonna give them value.

23
00:01:31.146 --> 00:01:34.666
It might be a course, it might be
a report, it might be a free app,

24
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:37.301
it might be at lots of different things,
right?

25
00:01:37.301 --> 00:01:41.543
And we're gonna get them involved in
the creation process of whatever that

26
00:01:41.543 --> 00:01:42.350
thing is.

27
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.394
Now I know all of this doesn't make
a huge amount of sense right now but

28
00:01:46.394 --> 00:01:48.290
we'll get into it more as we go.

29
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.863
So what we're doing here is we're
gonna build awareness in that group's

30
00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:54.980
mind, right?

31
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.987
We're gonna make them aware that we exist.

32
00:01:56.987 --> 00:02:01.837
And we're gonna do it in
such a way that we're

33
00:02:01.837 --> 00:02:07.199
going to demonstrate our
interest in the sector,

34
00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:12.320
our desire to help them and
provide them value.

35
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.429
And we're also then later on gonna
start building further awareness and

36
00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:21.700
growing the list further using
things like guest blogging,

37
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.390
speaking social media and
other kinds of stuff.

38
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.980
So we're gonna get into all of
that in a lot more detail later.

39
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.102
So don't worry if it doesn't make
an enormous amount of sense right now.

40
00:02:33.102 --> 00:02:36.487
This is as much what's on the screen
at the moment, is as much for

41
00:02:36.487 --> 00:02:39.700
your quick reference later than it is for
helping right now.

42
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.544
With the building the connection,
so we've got people's attention,

43
00:02:44.544 --> 00:02:48.061
we're gonna get people's attention
by contacting them directly and then

44
00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:52.400
through things like guest blogging and
social media and all these other things.

45
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.231
Once we got their attention,
we need to create a connection, right?

46
00:02:58.231 --> 00:03:04.708
And so what we're gonna do is we're going
to offer people something for free, okay?

47
00:03:04.708 --> 00:03:07.063
So this is a marketing terms,

48
00:03:07.063 --> 00:03:12.908
is called a lead magnet where you give
them something for free in return for

49
00:03:12.908 --> 00:03:17.620
get into contact them and
build a relationship with them.

50
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.450
So maybe you're giving them a course,
for example, a free course.

51
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.737
And when they access the course,
we're also gonna ask them to sign up for

52
00:03:25.737 --> 00:03:29.251
a mailing list, right,
offering them not to be sold out but

53
00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:31.780
more advice on best practice.

54
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.347
So let's say you did a course on,
well, let's use a real example,

55
00:03:36.347 --> 00:03:41.334
Harry Roberts, a friend of mine,
he is an expert in performance, okay?

56
00:03:41.334 --> 00:03:45.768
So he gives away course
material about how to improve

57
00:03:45.768 --> 00:03:49.406
the performance of your website, right?

58
00:03:49.406 --> 00:03:52.415
And you sign up for his mailing list and

59
00:03:52.415 --> 00:03:58.448
he shares more advice about how to
improve the performance of your website.

60
00:03:58.448 --> 00:04:03.371
So by giving away,
by helping people you get the permission

61
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:08.397
that you need to stay in contact
with them over the long term.

62
00:04:08.397 --> 00:04:11.116
If you are only selling at them,

63
00:04:11.116 --> 00:04:16.790
you're not creating value,
there's no benefit to them.

64
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.748
But if you're helping them, you're
giving them advice, you're giving them

65
00:04:21.748 --> 00:04:26.484
free stuff, you're being there for
them to support them in any way you can,

66
00:04:26.484 --> 00:04:30.203
then you got permission to talk
to them on an ongoing basis.

67
00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:33.817
And of course you got keep them
engaged over the long term and

68
00:04:33.817 --> 00:04:37.150
that's where my two weekly
newsletter comes into it.

69
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.443
So once they're on the mailing list
we need to keep them engaged and

70
00:04:41.443 --> 00:04:44.863
keep providing value otherwise
they're going to unsubscribe, right,

71
00:04:44.863 --> 00:04:47.840
before potentially they're ready to buy.

72
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.518
So but basically the aim of keeping
them engaged is to ensure that

73
00:04:52.518 --> 00:04:57.382
they remember you when they have
a need for your services, right?

74
00:04:57.382 --> 00:05:02.340
So the first person that pops into their
head is pulled back when they need user

75
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.615
experience services or
conversion rate optimization services,

76
00:05:06.615 --> 00:05:10.040
that's what I'm aiming for, right?

77
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.948
And that gets me away from, take the
procurement platforms I was talking about,

78
00:05:14.948 --> 00:05:18.280
where you're there to make up the numbers.

79
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.039
But suddenly you are that
preferred supplier and

80
00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.487
everybody else is the ones making up
the numbers, right, hugely different.

81
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:30.695
And then once we got them on the mailing
list, we've got them following regularly,

82
00:05:30.695 --> 00:05:34.416
we want to get them to contact us, to talk
to us, even if they haven't got a job.

83
00:05:34.416 --> 00:05:40.160
And the reason that we want to do that
is because that builds a relationship,

84
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.424
it builds a rapport, right?

85
00:05:42.424 --> 00:05:47.294
One of the biggest reasons why somebody
hires you over somebody else isn't

86
00:05:47.294 --> 00:05:52.329
your skill set, right, there are other
people that have got your skill set.

87
00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:56.182
The reason someone wants to hire you
rather than someone else is because they

88
00:05:56.182 --> 00:06:00.452
like you, they like the way you think,
the way you behave, your professionalism,

89
00:06:00.452 --> 00:06:04.090
your attitude, your personality,
all of those things sell, right?

90
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.990
And that comes from building trust and
the relationship and the communication.

91
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.540
So we wanna encourage
that as much as we can.

92
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.363
So if you're on my mailing list,
you'll find that I often say.

93
00:06:15.363 --> 00:06:19.000
Look, what I've shared today maybe
it's a little bit complicated,

94
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.082
maybe you don't get it all,
maybe you've got questions,

95
00:06:22.082 --> 00:06:25.923
maybe your circumstance is unique,
drop me an email, I'm here to help.

96
00:06:25.923 --> 00:06:33.080
And I make no judgments
about who writes to me.

97
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.571
So I don't look at,
when someone writes to me and

98
00:06:36.571 --> 00:06:41.085
they've got a Gmail address and
it's not coming from Virgin or

99
00:06:41.085 --> 00:06:45.450
Nike or Pepsi, I don't go,
I'm not going to reply to them.

100
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.725
I reply to everybody, I help everybody,

101
00:06:48.725 --> 00:06:53.415
even people that write to me and
say I'm a student, right?

102
00:06:53.415 --> 00:06:56.262
Now this is how long term my strategy is,
right?

103
00:06:56.262 --> 00:06:59.762
Because I know that
that student can go and

104
00:06:59.762 --> 00:07:03.864
get a job and
then they'll recommend me, okay?

105
00:07:03.864 --> 00:07:09.695
And I do to this day,
now I've been doing this for so long.

106
00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:12.776
I get people I honest and
this this really,

107
00:07:12.776 --> 00:07:18.179
I can never work out whether I want to
hug them or hit them when they say this.

108
00:07:18.179 --> 00:07:22.420
But they'll say something like,
I've always wanted to work with you,

109
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.380
man, I listened to your podcast
when I was in high school.

110
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.861
And it's like kids, and now they're
like senior management of Twitter or

111
00:07:31.861 --> 00:07:34.565
something and there's but, yeah.

112
00:07:34.565 --> 00:07:38.910
And so just build that relationship,
get chatting with people,

113
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.648
help everybody, right?

114
00:07:40.648 --> 00:07:46.276
This is the underpinning principle of
everything that we're talking about today,

115
00:07:46.276 --> 00:07:49.930
is don't market, don't sell,
be helpful, right?

116
00:07:51.705 --> 00:07:55.925
So let's recap what we've said so far and
then I think it's time to take a break.

117
00:07:55.925 --> 00:07:59.756
So, first of all,
we wanna grab people's attention, the P,

118
00:07:59.756 --> 00:08:04.722
the specific audience we wanna reach,
we wanna grab their attention.

119
00:08:04.722 --> 00:08:09.906
We wanna then get permission to contact
them regularly, we wanna demonstrate

120
00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:14.313
value and expertise to them to show
that we are worth working with.

121
00:08:14.313 --> 00:08:19.312
And then we wanna keep in contact
with them until they're ready to make

122
00:08:19.312 --> 00:08:20.082
a purchase
