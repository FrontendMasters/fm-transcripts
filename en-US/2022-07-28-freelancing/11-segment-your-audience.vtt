WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.650
And then we gotta prepare and
send our survey email.

2
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.802
Now, in this particular case, we
are going to segment our audience, right.

3
00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:14.401
So that means we're gonna send different
emails to slightly different groups.

4
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:19.619
We're gonna send an email to
those we consider influences.

5
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.960
We're gonna send a version of the email to
those who didn't reply to our first email.

6
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.288
And then we're gonna send a version to
those who did reply to our first email,

7
00:00:33.288 --> 00:00:34.270
right.

8
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.180
Does that makes sense?

9
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.440
Okay, so in terms of how you do that,
it's up to you.

10
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.030
You could just do it in Excel, just make
a note of who replied and who didn't.

11
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.118
Or you could use a tool I use ConvertKit,
which is a great tool for

12
00:00:48.118 --> 00:00:49.760
managing email lists.

13
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.312
And actually longer term,

14
00:00:51.312 --> 00:00:56.510
once you've actually got a proper
mailing list rather than this cold one.

15
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.530
Then that becomes particularly useful,
but we'll revisit that later.

16
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.459
So let's look at our emails very quickly,
so

17
00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:07.246
make the subject line to write
to influences in this case.

18
00:01:07.246 --> 00:01:10.172
Make the subject line clear and
reference your previous communication.

19
00:01:10.172 --> 00:01:15.176
So I've put next step in the Charity's
report we discussed, right.

20
00:01:15.176 --> 00:01:21.050
So makes it very obviously tied
to previous conversations.

21
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.169
You may remember I emailed you in regards
to a report we are creating on user

22
00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:27.450
experience in the Charity sector.

23
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.250
I mentioned I was interested in your
feedback as to what she covered.

24
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.269
So I'm reminding them about
the previous conversation,

25
00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:37.180
make it clear why you're contacting them.

26
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.735
Then introduce the survey so

27
00:01:38.735 --> 00:01:42.720
I've prepared a survey that I
would love you to complete.

28
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.626
I will use it to inform the final report,

29
00:01:44.626 --> 00:01:47.430
it should only take you
five minutes to complete.

30
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.390
Obviously in return I will send you a copy
of the final report when it's completed.

31
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.874
So you introduce the survey, make it
clear what you want them to do, and

32
00:01:54.874 --> 00:01:56.750
what they will get in return.

33
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.250
All right, but
also emphasize it won't take them long.

34
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.952
Also feel free to share this with your
network if you think it's of value,

35
00:02:03.952 --> 00:02:06.848
the more responses we get,
the more accurate the final results.

36
00:02:06.848 --> 00:02:11.060
So encourage them because they're
influencers to share it with their broader

37
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.771
community.

38
00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:14.602
And also explain why that's
worth their time in doing that

39
00:02:14.602 --> 00:02:16.400
it's gonna lead to a better report.

40
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.123
If you have any feedback on the survey or

41
00:02:20.123 --> 00:02:23.427
maybe you would like to
collaborate on it with me.

42
00:02:23.427 --> 00:02:25.864
Because these are influences remember,

43
00:02:25.864 --> 00:02:30.020
then drop me a reply and I'm happy
to set up a call, I'd love to chat.

44
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.623
So make it personal and
use the opportunity to directly engage,

45
00:02:33.623 --> 00:02:36.306
cuz these are the kind
of people that actually.

46
00:02:36.306 --> 00:02:40.693
If they turned around and said, this
sounds like a really good idea, you want,

47
00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.273
let's get their name on it.

48
00:02:42.273 --> 00:02:46.034
Because they've already got
an established name and stuff like that.

49
00:02:46.034 --> 00:02:51.608
So that's how I deal with influencers,
in terms of 'No contact' emails,

50
00:02:51.608 --> 00:02:55.020
so the people that
didn't reply previously.

51
00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:02.444
It's pretty much mainly the same as the
other one but it's got some differences.

52
00:03:02.444 --> 00:03:06.300
So I've written well, thanks to some great
feedback from others in the sector I've

53
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.671
now prepared a short survey.

54
00:03:07.671 --> 00:03:09.382
That will inform the final report.

55
00:03:09.382 --> 00:03:12.332
If you could spare five minutes
max to complete the survey,

56
00:03:12.332 --> 00:03:16.620
I'll be more than happy to give you a free
copy of the final report in return.

57
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.861
So I've added a bit where I emphasize
how others have got involved.

58
00:03:21.861 --> 00:03:24.939
Even though you didn't,
it's that old fear of missing out thing.

59
00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:29.818
And then I end with if you have any
feedback on the survey, we'll be happy or

60
00:03:29.818 --> 00:03:33.620
we'd be happy to be interviewed,
drop me a reply.

61
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.692
So instead of this whole
collaboration thing,

62
00:03:36.692 --> 00:03:39.929
I've changed out to being
interviewed instead.

63
00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:44.924
People like being interviewed,
because it makes them look like an expert.

64
00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:49.608
And if you quote them in the report,
then that goes down very well.

65
00:03:49.608 --> 00:03:53.039
For those people that had
previously contacted,

66
00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:58.524
I've changed the subject a little bit,
your feedback helped our survey a lot.

67
00:03:58.524 --> 00:04:03.026
And then we thank them for
their previous involvement,

68
00:04:03.026 --> 00:04:06.774
then pretty much everything
else is the same.

69
00:04:06.774 --> 00:04:12.510
So it's just a lot of kind of thank
you for your contributions etc.

70
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.930
So yeah and
that's the email you're sending out, or

71
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.360
you have to write LinkedIn message or
whatever else.

72
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.076
So it's all there word for word, obviously
you need to tailor it to make it sound

73
00:04:23.076 --> 00:04:25.860
like you, obviously you need
to tailor it for your sector.

74
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.173
But hopefully that's a good starting
point you can get to from the slide deck

75
00:04:29.173 --> 00:04:31.933
that'll save you a bit of work
rather than start from scratch.

76
00:04:31.933 --> 00:04:36.866
There's nothing worse than that
flashing cursor on a blank page when

77
00:04:36.866 --> 00:04:40.277
you're supposed to write
an important email.

78
00:04:40.277 --> 00:04:45.200
So this idea I keep talking
about of offering a site audit

79
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.514
to encourage responses.

80
00:04:47.514 --> 00:04:50.750
It's optional you don't have to do it, but

81
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.620
I have found it is quite worthwhile doing,
so it provides a number of benefits.

82
00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.994
When you're auditing websites,

83
00:04:59.994 --> 00:05:04.352
if you bother to go to these different
websites and audit them and look at them.

84
00:05:04.352 --> 00:05:07.860
Then it also actually provides
really good quality content for

85
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.720
your report, cuz you can now go.

86
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.088
For example, on this site,
they do dot dot dot, or

87
00:05:14.088 --> 00:05:16.904
their performance was better than average.

88
00:05:16.904 --> 00:05:21.127
And you can reference things
that's going on in the industry,

89
00:05:21.127 --> 00:05:24.084
it's a good way, bulking out your report.

90
00:05:24.084 --> 00:05:26.088
So it gives you more
content in your report,

91
00:05:26.088 --> 00:05:28.220
improves the quality of your report.

92
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.092
And also, the other great thing is people
love to know how they're ranking and

93
00:05:31.092 --> 00:05:31.886
how they're doing.

94
00:05:31.886 --> 00:05:34.034
Especially compared to their competitors.

95
00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:39.393
So this kind of site audit potentially is
an interesting strategy for doing that.

96
00:05:39.393 --> 00:05:42.291
Now I'll explain how to do
it in just a minute, and

97
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:45.160
encourages people to contact you as well.

98
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.482
Because they have to write back and
say yeah we'd love to be included in that.

99
00:05:50.482 --> 00:05:55.355
So, this is the approach that I tend
to use, I use a scorecard approach.

100
00:05:55.355 --> 00:06:00.516
So this is a scorecard for
[LAUGH] bizarrely an Egyptian university.

101
00:06:00.516 --> 00:06:04.470
Cuz I did a whole load of work
with the Egyptian universities,

102
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.129
and so we started exam scoring
them against one another.

103
00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:12.942
So I had different criteria accessibility,
relevance, usability, engagement, and

104
00:06:12.942 --> 00:06:16.460
I gave them scores against
different criteria in each.

105
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.452
So basically, you identify a small number
of criteria related to your report,

106
00:06:21.452 --> 00:06:23.400
whatever the subject that is.

107
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.493
You rank a site against each of your
criteria on a simple one to five scale,

108
00:06:27.493 --> 00:06:29.088
nothing very complicated.

109
00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:32.140
And you even use automated
tools where possible.

110
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:38.438
So for example, when I was doing,
I think it was usability or

111
00:06:38.438 --> 00:06:42.770
one of my factors included performance.

112
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:48.599
So I just use GTmetrix to get
a performance figure out there,

113
00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:54.900
and then I write a tiny few lines
of recommendations for each one.

114
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.265
So that it feels a bit more personal, and

115
00:06:57.265 --> 00:07:01.660
I spend no more than 30 minutes on
each of these things, filling them in.

116
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:08.850
It's really fast and furious, you don't
need to review every site on your list.

117
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:13.531
You can even review only the ones that
specifically asked you for a review, or

118
00:07:13.531 --> 00:07:16.560
you could choose to
review a cross section.

119
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.171
You can put as much or
as little time into this as you want,

120
00:07:20.171 --> 00:07:24.800
but this is what people really love,
which is league tables, right.

121
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.550
Where you publish how different
sites performed against one another.

122
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.670
Everybody wants to know how they're
doing compared to everybody else.

123
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.371
So this is why I really think
this is although optional,

124
00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:40.540
is a really good thing
to put in the report.

125
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:45.599
Because if you could say there is
a league table where your website is

126
00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:50.682
compared to your competitors in
the report, they will wanna know.

127
00:07:50.682 --> 00:07:55.444
They will wanna download that, so
it's a good one for getting downloads.
