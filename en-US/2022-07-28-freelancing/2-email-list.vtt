00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.499
So what's the answer?

2
00:00:01.499 --> 00:00:04.863
So far, [LAUGH] I've just slammed
everything, I'm like, and

3
00:00:04.863 --> 00:00:07.285
now it's time to go home, good luck, yeah.

4
00:00:07.285 --> 00:00:12.823
[LAUGH] So let me provide you
with what I think the answer is,

5
00:00:12.823 --> 00:00:19.958
and I think it might surprise you
a little bit, cuz it's not very popular.

6
00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:25.963
Actually, I think email is
gonna be our answer, right?

7
00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:30.348
Don't worry, we're not talking about
spamming email or anything like that.

8
00:00:30.348 --> 00:00:34.168
It's not as bad as it sounds,
[LAUGH] right?

9
00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:38.400
But email has got a lot going for
it that all of the others don't.

10
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.420
Let me explain why.

11
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.378
For a start,
we work business to business, all right?

12
00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:49.976
So every single person that is a potential
client for you lives in email, okay?

13
00:00:49.976 --> 00:00:55.522
Yeah, but we've moved to Slack now, but
they're still checking email, right?

14
00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:57.319
Everybody checks email.

15
00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:03.585
So while there was a time, right,
I remember the halcyon days,

16
00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:10.729
I'm really sounding old now, where
people subscribed to RSS feeds, right?

17
00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.563
And they would get notified
every time I released a blog,

18
00:01:13.563 --> 00:01:16.161
and they would immediately
trot along to the blog and

19
00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:18.837
read it,
because they'd received a notification.

20
00:01:18.837 --> 00:01:22.904
Are we honestly saying that
everybody does that anymore,

21
00:01:22.904 --> 00:01:25.564
that anybody follows a blog anymore?

22
00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:27.775
No, of course not.

23
00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:31.016
The only time you end up on a blog
is where you google something and

24
00:01:31.016 --> 00:01:33.189
it happens to take you to the blog, right?

25
00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.318
And then there's no connection,
there's no relationship there.

26
00:01:36.318 --> 00:01:40.517
Social media, you post something on social
media and it's gone in a blink of an eye,

27
00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:43.667
it shoots off the top with all
the other noise that's going on.

28
00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:48.994
Email, every email that somebody
receives they might not read it.

29
00:01:48.994 --> 00:01:54.781
But they will be reminded you exist,
they will see it.

30
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:58.592
So yeah, you will be seen.

31
00:01:58.592 --> 00:02:01.395
Every single message you
sent out will be seen.

32
00:02:01.395 --> 00:02:05.845
It might not be read in detail, but
you will at least be remembered.

33
00:02:05.845 --> 00:02:10.303
They're not gonna forget you in the same
way as traditional content marketing.

34
00:02:10.303 --> 00:02:13.594
And in lots of situations,
you will be read.

35
00:02:13.594 --> 00:02:17.916
So I've got a subscriber mailing
list of 8,500 currently,

36
00:02:17.916 --> 00:02:20.832
that's where my mailing list is standing.

37
00:02:20.832 --> 00:02:23.308
And I get an open rate of 38%.

38
00:02:23.308 --> 00:02:28.707
And that means, every two weeks,
I send an email out every two weeks,

39
00:02:28.707 --> 00:02:35.310
3,230 people, potential clients these are,
are reading about my expertise.

40
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.698
That's pretty good, right?

41
00:02:37.698 --> 00:02:40.687
That's more than enough to sustain me.

42
00:02:41.815 --> 00:02:46.455
So, actually, email might not be
very trendy, but it is very good,

43
00:02:46.455 --> 00:02:49.584
and there are other good
reasons about email.

44
00:02:49.584 --> 00:02:52.600
I own my email list, right?

45
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.642
That's mine, okay?

46
00:02:53.642 --> 00:02:58.866
It's not some social media platform
where they can change the algorithm and

47
00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:03.201
wipe me off the face of the Earth
in a blink of an eye, I own that.

48
00:03:03.201 --> 00:03:06.930
So there's lots of reasons why
email has got lot of potential.

49
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.350
So where does that leave us?

50
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.357
Well, it leaves us with needing
to get people on a mailing list,

51
00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:18.989
so that we can build
a relationship with them.

52
00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.911
And I'm not talking about a mailing
list where we sell at them.

53
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:26.200
As you'll see as we go through this,
this is very soft, this is very gentle.

54
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.402
It's not pushy in any way at all,
but we need to take some

55
00:03:31.402 --> 00:03:36.275
of the lessons of marketing and
sales techniques and

56
00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:40.835
use those in a much gentler way for
our purposes.

57
00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:45.883
So what we basically got to do,
is get people to subscribe by moving them

58
00:03:45.883 --> 00:03:50.780
through something, they call it
marketing a sales funnel, right?

59
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.291
So what is a sales funnel, okay?

60
00:03:54.291 --> 00:03:59.116
Well, a sales funnel is basically
a journey that a prospective client

61
00:03:59.116 --> 00:04:02.714
goes through from the moment
they first hear that you

62
00:04:02.714 --> 00:04:07.075
exist to the moment that they
sign up to your services, right?

63
00:04:07.075 --> 00:04:12.002
So in many ways, if you happen to
have any experience in design,

64
00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:17.130
I'm sure you've come across
the term customer journey mapping.

65
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.800
A sales funnel is very similar
to a customer journey mapping.

66
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.028
It's just the emphasis is more
around moving the customer

67
00:04:26.028 --> 00:04:30.730
along that journey to
the point where they hire you.

68
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.881
So what does that typically look like?

69
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:37.705
Well, let's just kind of give you
a very simplistic sales funnel,

70
00:04:37.705 --> 00:04:40.390
because we don't need
anything complicated,

71
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.371
we're not a multinational corporation
selling multiple products.

72
00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:46.448
Our needs are fairly basic.

73
00:04:46.448 --> 00:04:51.494
First thing we wanna do is
attract their attention, right?

74
00:04:51.494 --> 00:04:55.336
Hey, here I am,
notice me in all of the noise.

75
00:04:55.336 --> 00:04:59.713
Then once we've got that attention,
then we wanna build a connection, right?

76
00:04:59.713 --> 00:05:03.448
We wanna be more than just
another faceless web designer or

77
00:05:03.448 --> 00:05:07.273
faceless data scientist or
developer or whatever you are.

78
00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:10.365
We wanna be someone that
there is a connection with.

79
00:05:10.365 --> 00:05:15.254
And then we wanna keep people engaged,
right?

80
00:05:15.254 --> 00:05:20.834
Keep them talking, so
keep them hearing from us regularly.

81
00:05:20.834 --> 00:05:23.809
And then actually, we wanna encourage
them to start talking to us.

82
00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:26.792
Even if they've not really
got anything to hire us for,

83
00:05:26.792 --> 00:05:31.171
the more contact we have with them, the
more of a relationship we build with them,

84
00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:34.165
the more that they will want
to eventually work with us.

85
00:05:34.165 --> 00:05:38.612
And then finally, we wanna close the sale.

86
00:05:38.612 --> 00:05:43.701
And the reason a sales funnel is so
important is because the chances of

87
00:05:43.701 --> 00:05:49.055
you reaching out to somebody or
them hearing about you at the exact moment

88
00:05:49.055 --> 00:05:54.694
they're ready to hire you is extremely
low, right, if you think about it.

89
00:05:54.694 --> 00:05:59.707
So what we need to do is maintain
that contact then until they

90
00:05:59.707 --> 00:06:05.140
are ready to holla at you, and
that's what sales funnel is for.

91
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.537
Now, I'll be honest with you,
that's not a kinda quick fix, right?

92
00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:15.890
If you right now are in the middle
of a crisis where your work is dried

93
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:22.104
up as a freelancer, and you've got not
enough work coming through the door,

94
00:06:22.104 --> 00:06:27.190
this ain't gonna solve that overnight,
I'm afraid, okay?

95
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:32.210
What I'm talking about
building here is a long-term

96
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.899
sustainable kind of stream of
potential work coming through

97
00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:43.157
the door that you can rely on and
know that will be there.

98
00:06:43.157 --> 00:06:48.774
So I'm now at the point, for example,
where maybe if I get slow month,

99
00:06:48.774 --> 00:06:52.724
I send an email out, and
that will generate work.

100
00:06:52.724 --> 00:06:55.827
If I wanna do a different type of work,
I send an email out and

101
00:06:55.827 --> 00:06:57.700
it'll generate that type of work.

102
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:04.103
That's where I wanna get you to, but
that's not gonna happen instantly.

103
00:07:04.103 --> 00:07:06.702
So why do you want this sales funnel,
how does it help?

104
00:07:06.702 --> 00:07:11.090
Well, first of all,
you could target your sales funnel, right?

105
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.558
So you can pick a group of clients that
you would really like to work with and

106
00:07:15.558 --> 00:07:17.158
you can focus in on those.

107
00:07:17.158 --> 00:07:21.277
I wanna work on those with those people,
so let's build a sales funnel for

108
00:07:21.277 --> 00:07:22.151
them, right?

109
00:07:22.151 --> 00:07:23.315
So that's one thing.

110
00:07:23.315 --> 00:07:27.136
Second is the consistent thing
I just talked about, right?

111
00:07:27.136 --> 00:07:31.510
Once you've got sales funnel up and
running for a while, it will provide

112
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:36.261
you with a relatively consistent and
reliable source of new clients, right?

113
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:40.877
There won't be that kind of emotional
trauma when the phone stops ringing and

114
00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:44.215
it goes dry for a particular month,
or, I don't know,

115
00:07:44.215 --> 00:07:46.433
a global pandemic happens, right?

116
00:07:46.433 --> 00:07:50.328
For me, the global pandemic,
a lot of the agencies and

117
00:07:50.328 --> 00:07:54.410
freelancers that I worked
with were devastated by that.

118
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:59.490
For me, I had about two months
that were slower than normal.

119
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.557
So having a sales funnel
really kinda helps with that.

120
00:08:03.557 --> 00:08:05.637
And then finally, it's controllable.

121
00:08:05.637 --> 00:08:09.019
By tweaking your sales funnel and
the messaging that you use,

122
00:08:09.019 --> 00:08:13.652
you can control the amount of clients that
you win, the type of clients that you win.

123
00:08:13.652 --> 00:08:15.740
You've got real control over what you do.
