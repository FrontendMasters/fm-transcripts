1
00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:01.695
So where are we at?

2
00:00:01.695 --> 00:00:04.577
How far have we got along this journey?

3
00:00:04.577 --> 00:00:09.042
We have looked at pretty much
everything that's involved in

4
00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:12.552
identifying the people
that we wanna contact.

5
00:00:12.552 --> 00:00:16.414
We've identified how we can
go about contacting them.

6
00:00:16.414 --> 00:00:18.051
We've made initial contact.

7
00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.881
We've done a survey.

8
00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:22.109
We've put together a report.

9
00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.921
Everything's looking great and wonderful,
but we still don't have a mailing list.

10
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:30.997
We don't have a group of people
that we can talk to regularly.

11
00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:34.727
We've kind of taken a chance and
contacted some people fairly cold,

12
00:00:34.727 --> 00:00:39.053
but they haven't given us their permission
to talk to them on an ongoing basis.

13
00:00:39.053 --> 00:00:43.753
And we really need that because we don't
wanna be emailing people all the time

14
00:00:43.753 --> 00:00:45.502
without their permission.

15
00:00:45.502 --> 00:00:49.940
So, why and
how do we gain that permission?

16
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.136
All right, so first off,
why is ongoing communication so important?

17
00:00:56.136 --> 00:00:57.660
Why does it matter so much?

18
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.845
Well, our survey and report will
have got us on our audience's radar,

19
00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:10.471
but we need to stay on that
radar really to give us a chance

20
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:15.655
to build credibility in
the minds of our audience.

21
00:01:15.655 --> 00:01:19.900
We need to be able to show
them how great we are, okay?

22
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.446
Then you can tell somebody,
yeah, I'm an amazing developer,

23
00:01:24.446 --> 00:01:26.973
I do all this great work or whatever.

24
00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:31.131
But that is not as valuable as them
discovering that from sales based on what

25
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:35.751
they've learned about you, what they've
heard about you, what they've read,

26
00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:38.194
that you've said, those kinds of things.

27
00:01:38.194 --> 00:01:41.693
So it's essential as well
that we stay front and

28
00:01:41.693 --> 00:01:46.680
center in people's minds so
that when they need our services we're

29
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.453
instantly their preferred supplier,
all right?

30
00:01:50.453 --> 00:01:54.018
So it's those two things that we need
to stay front and center in the minds,

31
00:01:54.018 --> 00:01:55.499
we need to build credibility.

32
00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:59.175
And that's where regular contact
via email can provide that.

33
00:01:59.175 --> 00:02:02.545
That's why on my website,
at the bottom of every single page,

34
00:02:02.545 --> 00:02:05.595
you've got a call to action to
sign up to my mailing list,

35
00:02:05.595 --> 00:02:08.664
cuz once I've got you on my mailing list,
I've gotcha.

36
00:02:08.664 --> 00:02:12.209
That's it, you are at my mercy.

37
00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.332
So how do we gain
the permission that we need?

38
00:02:16.332 --> 00:02:20.473
Well, there are several
steps involved in this, and

39
00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:24.163
that will change a little
bit over time as well.

40
00:02:24.163 --> 00:02:31.731
So the number one thing that we wanna do
is we wanna promote the report, okay?

41
00:02:31.731 --> 00:02:35.097
So we're gonna contact our audience and
tell them about the report.

42
00:02:35.097 --> 00:02:39.673
And we're also gonna reach out to those
influencers, and we're also gonna use some

43
00:02:39.673 --> 00:02:43.232
other promotion techniques that
I'm gonna get into in a moment.

44
00:02:43.232 --> 00:02:49.372
In addition to that, alongside the report,
we probably want to offer a short email

45
00:02:49.372 --> 00:02:55.444
course that dives a little bit deeper into
the issues that are found in the report.

46
00:02:55.444 --> 00:02:59.229
Now, don't worry, I know that sounds
like a lot more extra work, but

47
00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:00.266
it really isn't.

48
00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:03.624
It's regurgitating what's in the report
and adding a bit more detail.

49
00:03:03.624 --> 00:03:08.225
So it's not overly taxing,
don't worry about it.

50
00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:12.693
And we're gonna use that really
as the kind of next step.

51
00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:14.602
Okay, so you've downloaded the report.

52
00:03:14.602 --> 00:03:18.440
Now, you get these kind of
series of introductory emails.

53
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.218
And then once you've had that emails, then
you're going on to that ongoing advice.

54
00:03:23.218 --> 00:03:28.413
So after people finish the course,
they will continue to hear from

55
00:03:28.413 --> 00:03:34.274
you via monthly emails forever or
bi-weekly or whatever you decide to do.

56
00:03:34.274 --> 00:03:40.032
So really, the report is done, that's
your upfront work, piece of work done.

57
00:03:40.032 --> 00:03:44.704
Then we're gonna put together a short
email course that only ever needs to be

58
00:03:44.704 --> 00:03:46.169
done once, all right?

59
00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.191
And then when people sign up, they're
gonna get those over a series of weeks.

60
00:03:50.191 --> 00:03:54.870
So once you've done all of that,
then really, your kind of week to

61
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.737
week marketing is literally just
doing those ongoing newsletters.

62
00:03:59.737 --> 00:04:01.244
All right, that's it.

63
00:04:01.244 --> 00:04:04.423
So right now,
I'm not targeting a new audience,

64
00:04:04.423 --> 00:04:07.007
I'm not targeting anybody different.

65
00:04:07.007 --> 00:04:12.098
So my marketing activities consists of
writing an email once every two weeks,

66
00:04:12.098 --> 00:04:12.645
right?

67
00:04:12.645 --> 00:04:16.343
So you can see how it
does become lightweight.

68
00:04:16.343 --> 00:04:20.774
Yes, you need to block up some time to put
everything in place to begin with, but

69
00:04:20.774 --> 00:04:24.563
once you've got it there,
then it's a very lightweight process.

70
00:04:24.563 --> 00:04:29.113
So first of all, we need to design
a landing page that encourages permission.

71
00:04:29.113 --> 00:04:33.625
So this is the point where
people can get the report, and

72
00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:39.579
they can then go on and sign up for
the email course and the ongoing emails.

73
00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:42.566
So what are the objectives
of this landing page?

74
00:04:42.566 --> 00:04:45.383
It needs to establish your credibility.

75
00:04:45.383 --> 00:04:48.053
So why do I want emails from this person?

76
00:04:48.053 --> 00:04:50.514
Why do I care about what they do?

77
00:04:50.514 --> 00:04:53.806
We need to create a desire for
the course and the report.

78
00:04:53.806 --> 00:04:57.758
We need to say,
show people why that is worth having.

79
00:04:57.758 --> 00:05:03.543
We want to encourage people to sign up
fairly obviously to the mailing list and

80
00:05:03.543 --> 00:05:04.704
at all stages.

81
00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:08.313
And it is not about selling your services,
right?

82
00:05:08.313 --> 00:05:13.591
This is not the place to promote yourself,
which means that we probably don't want to

83
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:18.815
make this a part of our existing website,
although it can share the design, right?

84
00:05:18.815 --> 00:05:23.327
So one of the questions I was
being asked over lunch was,

85
00:05:23.327 --> 00:05:26.696
should I integrate this into my website?

86
00:05:26.696 --> 00:05:28.553
The answer is probably no.

87
00:05:28.553 --> 00:05:30.900
You can do if you really want to, but

88
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.580
the minute you integrate it
alongside your services and

89
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.915
the stuff you're selling, it's suddenly
all feels a lot more salesy, right?

90
00:05:39.915 --> 00:05:45.119
And I wanna focus it just on
your giving away free advice.

91
00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:46.868
So you probably don't wanna do it.

92
00:05:46.868 --> 00:05:50.932
But you can reuse the design,
if you want to, that's not a problem.

93
00:05:50.932 --> 00:05:53.943
So, what needs to go on this landing page?

94
00:05:53.943 --> 00:05:57.564
I touched on the earlier version of
the landing page for the survey.

95
00:05:57.564 --> 00:06:03.317
This one is for the report in the email,
so it's slightly different.

96
00:06:03.317 --> 00:06:06.872
You provide an outline of the main topics,
the report covers, and

97
00:06:06.872 --> 00:06:08.722
what the email course will cover.

98
00:06:08.722 --> 00:06:13.359
And you maybe share a couple of key
findings to get people interested, you'll

99
00:06:13.359 --> 00:06:18.011
be surprised to who is not nice, sounds
very clip biting, I wont say out loud.

100
00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:22.497
[LAUGH] The three highest ranking

101
00:06:22.497 --> 00:06:27.314
sites based on our criteria were,

102
00:06:27.314 --> 00:06:33.302
find out how you ranked
that kind of thing.

103
00:06:33.302 --> 00:06:38.203
Then we talk about the benefits that
are provided by getting the report

104
00:06:38.203 --> 00:06:39.291
in the course.

105
00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:44.032
So you get instant access to the report,
you get actionable advice on improving

106
00:06:44.032 --> 00:06:47.515
your site or app or
whatever it is that you're targeting.

107
00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:50.184
You get awareness of
the competitive landscape.

108
00:06:50.184 --> 00:06:54.171
You'll get evidence to support
your requests of management.

109
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:56.678
You'll get insights into
areas of innovation.

110
00:06:56.678 --> 00:07:00.443
So you basically show
the benefit that it provides.

111
00:07:00.443 --> 00:07:04.580
And then you add a couple of
sentences about your own credibility.

112
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.586
And then it's really about creating
a compelling call to action.

113
00:07:08.586 --> 00:07:12.168
So this is the call to action
that goes on my own website.

114
00:07:12.168 --> 00:07:16.843
This is just for
my generic newsletter sign up.

115
00:07:16.843 --> 00:07:19.948
It kind of has got a lot
of the key components.

116
00:07:19.948 --> 00:07:23.363
I know it looks like quite
a lot of information, but

117
00:07:23.363 --> 00:07:26.309
that's okay if it's done in the right way.

118
00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:29.426
So what does a good call to action
need to have on your landing page?

119
00:07:29.426 --> 00:07:32.050
It needs to be clear about
what people are gonna get.

120
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.751
So my case, my generic mailing
list is Improve Your Knowledge of

121
00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:40.354
User Experience Design, Digital Marketing
and Digital Leadership, right?

122
00:07:40.354 --> 00:07:43.817
And then it says you're gonna get
emails every one to two weeks.

123
00:07:43.817 --> 00:07:46.176
You get a free course on
getting design approval.

124
00:07:46.176 --> 00:07:49.829
A free course on building
a user centric culture.

125
00:07:49.829 --> 00:07:55.179
So you can see how I'm outlining
what it is you'll get.

126
00:07:55.179 --> 00:08:00.363
Now, here is an interesting one,
it maybe, this is a little bit

127
00:08:00.363 --> 00:08:06.609
of a manipulative technique, and
I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it.

128
00:08:06.609 --> 00:08:09.912
It popped into my head as I
was preparing this workshop,

129
00:08:09.912 --> 00:08:14.781
and not something I've actively tried,
but I'm gonna share it with you anyway.

130
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:19.861
One thing you might wanna consider
doing is allowing people to actually

131
00:08:19.861 --> 00:08:24.784
purchase the report if they don't
want to sign up to your email list.

132
00:08:24.784 --> 00:08:29.118
Now, nobody will ever do that because
why would you if you can get it for

133
00:08:29.118 --> 00:08:31.560
free from signing up for an email list?

134
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.513
But it means you could put
monetary value on the report,

135
00:08:35.513 --> 00:08:40.571
which makes the report look more
valuable when you then get it for free.

136
00:08:40.571 --> 00:08:42.462
I don't know whether
that's a bit manipulative.

137
00:08:42.462 --> 00:08:46.702
I can't quite work out whether I've just
described a dark pattern or not, go on.

138
00:08:46.702 --> 00:08:49.866
&gt;&gt; You've also given them a value,

139
00:08:49.866 --> 00:08:54.838
you're getting their
information as value to you.

140
00:08:54.838 --> 00:08:57.608
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's a good point, actually.

141
00:08:57.608 --> 00:09:00.260
So, I'm not sure quite how
I feel about that, but

142
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.482
I thought I'd throw it out there anyway.

143
00:09:02.482 --> 00:09:07.042
The other thing you might wanna do is
consider making it free for a limited

144
00:09:07.042 --> 00:09:11.930
period, because that motivates people
to sign up now and rather than later.

145
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:16.139
And one of the really important things you
call to action is make sure you handle any

146
00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:17.918
objections that people may have.

147
00:09:17.918 --> 00:09:19.046
So for example,

148
00:09:19.046 --> 00:09:23.809
people obviously are nervous about
giving over their email address.

149
00:09:23.809 --> 00:09:27.301
So you wanna make it clear that
you're not gonna sell it them.

150
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:32.174
You wanna make it clear that they
can unsubscribe in one click.

151
00:09:32.174 --> 00:09:35.802
And that you're never gonna share
their email address with anybody.

152
00:09:35.802 --> 00:09:39.500
So you're really kind of
reassuring them in the moment.
