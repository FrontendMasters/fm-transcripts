00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.643
Hello, it's great to have you here for
hopefully a good

2
00:00:04.643 --> 00:00:09.602
day exploring the subject of how
to go about finding clients.

3
00:00:09.602 --> 00:00:13.674
Whether you're a freelancer, whether
you're an agency doesn't really matter.

4
00:00:13.674 --> 00:00:16.905
This hopefully will help in both cases.

5
00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:19.663
In fact, this course is really good for

6
00:00:19.663 --> 00:00:24.689
anybody who might be considering
becoming a freelancer at some stage.

7
00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.119
Or even somebody that maybe just wants
to build an audience and a following so

8
00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.460
that they can maybe sell a product later
down the line or do something else.

9
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.366
So it's a pretty flexible course and
hopefully,

10
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:44.251
you'll find it helpful and useful.

11
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:46.971
To provide you with a little
bit context on this course and

12
00:00:46.971 --> 00:00:49.749
why we're doing it and
how it works and that kind of thing,

13
00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.320
I think it's worth saying
a little bit about myself.

14
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.600
Mainly because I like talking about
myself, obviously like everybody does.

15
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.783
So basically, I've been working in digital
for my entire career, so 27 years now.

16
00:01:04.783 --> 00:01:12.054
I know I don't look that old, but
13 years of which was running an agency.

17
00:01:12.054 --> 00:01:15.040
We got up to about 20
people in the agency.

18
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.903
And so the kind of techniques I'm
gonna share today is enough to

19
00:01:19.903 --> 00:01:23.868
support an agency of that
kinda size if you want to.

20
00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:26.086
And then after about 13 years,

21
00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:30.923
I stepped back from the agency because
I'm not really a people person and

22
00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:36.510
I'm very bad at managing staff and
have the attention span of a small child.

23
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.533
So instead,
I decided to go freelance myself and

24
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.829
became an independent consultant.

25
00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.252
And I've been using the same techniques
to support myself quite happily for

26
00:01:47.252 --> 00:01:48.790
the last six years.

27
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.760
So it's a really flexible approach
that I'm gonna share with you and

28
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.960
can hopefully help in pretty much any
circumstance you find yourself in.

29
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.621
I've worked with clients in all kinds of
sectors, every conceivable sector you

30
00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:09.294
can imagine, from, I don't know,
financial services through to charities.

31
00:02:09.294 --> 00:02:14.035
And again, what I'm gonna share today is
pretty flexible whatever sectors you end

32
00:02:14.035 --> 00:02:15.057
up working with.

33
00:02:15.057 --> 00:02:18.693
I also work with all kinds of different
sizes of organization, and again,

34
00:02:18.693 --> 00:02:20.318
this will help with that as well.

35
00:02:20.318 --> 00:02:25.405
So really a very flexible approach
based on my personal experience.

36
00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:28.807
I'm not saying it's the only
way of finding clients, but

37
00:02:28.807 --> 00:02:32.703
it's certainly the one that's
worked best for me over the years.

38
00:02:32.703 --> 00:02:36.098
Also, it's worth saying that
I've written a lot of books.

39
00:02:36.098 --> 00:02:37.157
I speak a lot on these topics.

40
00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:42.116
And I share almost everything that we
cover today in a lot more detail on my

41
00:02:42.116 --> 00:02:44.491
blog and via the emails I send out.

42
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:50.100
So I would encourage you at the end
of this slide that you'll find a URL,

43
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.851
and that URL will give
you access to the slides.

44
00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:57.583
And throughout the slides,
I kinda linked different articles and

45
00:02:57.583 --> 00:02:59.990
things that I've written over the years.

46
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.691
So you might wanna check that out as well,
because then you can read and

47
00:03:03.691 --> 00:03:04.650
get more detail.

48
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.370
So what are we gonna cover today?

49
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.360
Let's get into looking at the subject
matter we're gonna be talking about.

50
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.867
Well, we're gonna look at kind of
six different areas over the day.

51
00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:21.161
We're gonna start at why you
are struggling to find clients.

52
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:26.556
So if you're already a freelancer or
already run an agency and you have

53
00:03:26.556 --> 00:03:32.696
that deep seated worry about where the
next month's salary is gonna come from.

54
00:03:32.696 --> 00:03:37.762
Then we're gonna address that and we're
gonna deal with why that is the case,

55
00:03:37.762 --> 00:03:40.393
why things are not easier than they are.

56
00:03:40.393 --> 00:03:43.504
And if you're ever
considering going freelance,

57
00:03:43.504 --> 00:03:47.421
this will help you identify
the pitfalls before you reach them.

58
00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:52.512
Because one of the reasons I love
teaching this particular workshop

59
00:03:52.512 --> 00:03:57.435
is because it can have such
a transformational effect on people.

60
00:03:57.435 --> 00:04:01.836
That when we become freelancers, a lot
people become freelancers because they

61
00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:04.010
work for a company and they do this job.

62
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.388
And they see themselves being charged out
with twice the amount that they get paid.

63
00:04:10.388 --> 00:04:13.870
And they think, well, why should
I be doing it for somebody else?

64
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.170
And then they jump in and

65
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.138
they become a freelancer thinking
that they're gonna have more time and

66
00:04:19.138 --> 00:04:22.990
they're gonna be paid more and
it's gonna be this idealistic world.

67
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.300
But so
often it doesn't work out like that,

68
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.330
because there are many parts
you're not being told.

69
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.210
You might be the best coder in the world.

70
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.110
You might be the best data scientist.

71
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.779
You might be the best UI designer,
whatever it is that you do, but

72
00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:41.250
that doesn't mean you
can sell your services.

73
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.954
And so
a lot of people end up very stressed,

74
00:04:43.954 --> 00:04:48.760
very worried about where the next
paycheck is gonna come from.

75
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.942
So once we kind of establish
what doesn't work and

76
00:04:51.942 --> 00:04:56.183
why there are problems,
we're then gonna look at, well, okay,

77
00:04:56.183 --> 00:05:00.050
how are we going to define
the market that we wish to target?

78
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.195
Who do you wanna work with, right?

79
00:05:02.195 --> 00:05:06.997
Instead of having this attitude of,
I'll just take whatever work I could get,

80
00:05:06.997 --> 00:05:10.881
wouldn't it be great if you could pick and
choose your clients?

81
00:05:10.881 --> 00:05:13.326
You could say what sector
you wanted to work and

82
00:05:13.326 --> 00:05:15.152
what type of work you wanted to do.

83
00:05:15.152 --> 00:05:17.878
So we're gonna look at
how to make that happen,

84
00:05:17.878 --> 00:05:21.910
how to market to a specific audience,
how to identify that audience.

85
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.608
And once you've identified them,
how do we get their attention?

86
00:05:25.608 --> 00:05:29.660
Cuz let's be honest,
unless you're a freelancer or

87
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:36.157
an agency that offer marketing services,
you're not a marketing and salesperson.

88
00:05:36.157 --> 00:05:41.361
And in my experience, most designers and
developers kinda look at marketing and

89
00:05:41.361 --> 00:05:44.051
sales and go, that's kinda nasty.

90
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:47.221
Nobody likes the idea of selling yourself.

91
00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:51.443
And they certainly don't like
the idea of spamming people or

92
00:05:51.443 --> 00:05:55.600
cold calling them or
anything like that, how horrendous.

93
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.794
It'd be soul destroying to
start doing that kind of thing.

94
00:05:58.794 --> 00:06:04.805
So how do you get people's attention in a
way that's not salesy and not marketingy?

95
00:06:04.805 --> 00:06:09.723
Then once we got their attention, how do
we get permission to stay in touch with

96
00:06:09.723 --> 00:06:12.417
them, to build a relationship with them?

97
00:06:12.417 --> 00:06:18.292
Because again, we don't wanna be kind
of constantly spamming people or

98
00:06:18.292 --> 00:06:19.843
annoying people.

99
00:06:19.843 --> 00:06:25.125
Because we've got a soul and
[LAUGH] we don't want to be evil.

100
00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:30.057
So we've gotta find a way of making it
a mutually beneficial relationship.

101
00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:34.029
So how do we get the permission for
ongoing contact and

102
00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:37.835
how do we maintain and
grow our audience over time?

103
00:06:37.835 --> 00:06:41.475
And then eventually,
when that audience is ready to buy,

104
00:06:41.475 --> 00:06:44.390
how do we turn those
leads into real projects?

105
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:49.640
So there's a lot of ground to cover here,
but interestingly, and

106
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.728
I've looked, there's not much
teaching this stuff, right?

107
00:06:54.728 --> 00:06:55.905
You just finished a bootcamp.

108
00:06:55.905 --> 00:06:57.766
Did it cover anything like this?

109
00:06:57.766 --> 00:07:00.050
&gt;&gt; Not much about finding freelance work.

110
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.156
They kind of spoke about contract work and
the benefits and things of that,

111
00:07:04.156 --> 00:07:05.860
but not how to actually go out.

112
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.375
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

113
00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:06.877
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

114
00:07:06.877 --> 00:07:11.913
&gt;&gt; So a lot of people do turn to
contracting simply because they find

115
00:07:11.913 --> 00:07:18.087
selling kinda distasteful and horrible,
and I can totally understand that.

116
00:07:18.087 --> 00:07:23.241
But there is something, there's a huge
flexibility that comes with freelancing or

117
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:26.740
running your own agency that's
very appealing as well.

118
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.480
But yeah, you need to be able to
solve those kinds of sales problems.

119
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:38.036
I mean, you can go online, and you can
easily learn the latest Ruby techniques or

120
00:07:38.036 --> 00:07:41.939
the latest framework or how to use Figma.

121
00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:48.120
There's thousands of courses
about that kind of stuff.

122
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.160
But about actually winning work,
there's not a lot out there.

123
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:56.165
So that's why I'm doing this is hopefully
to bring a bit of peace of mind to

124
00:07:56.165 --> 00:08:01.860
people and feel like they're in
control of their sales and marketing.

125
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.691
So with that in mind, let's look at, well,

126
00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:07.380
why are so
many of us struggling with this?

127
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.033
Why is it such a horrendous thing for

128
00:08:10.033 --> 00:08:14.464
many people that causes a lot
of stress and a lot of anxiety?

129
00:08:14.464 --> 00:08:16.290
So let's dive in with that.
