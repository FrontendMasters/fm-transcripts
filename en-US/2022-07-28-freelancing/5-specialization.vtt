WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.090
Okay, so where have we got to?

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.776
We have decided that we
need a sales funnel.

3
00:00:05.776 --> 00:00:09.388
We've decided that email
plays a big role in that.

4
00:00:09.388 --> 00:00:14.004
But before we can do any of that,
first of all, we need to decide, well,

5
00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:16.146
who do we wanna work with, okay?

6
00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:21.155
Because so many of us just actually
kind of will take anything

7
00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:27.950
that walks through the door and are not
particularly fussy about who we market to.

8
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.908
But there's really good
reason why we want to

9
00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:36.831
segment our market as they call it.

10
00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:41.164
Why we want to put another way specialize,
okay?

11
00:00:41.164 --> 00:00:44.446
You hear this thing about
specialization a lot,

12
00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:49.660
that you should definitely specialize,
and there's a lot to be said for it.

13
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.896
For example, if you specialize,
you're gonna face less competition.

14
00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:58.878
There's less people that are going
provide the services that

15
00:00:58.878 --> 00:01:03.110
you provide, and
have the expertise that you have.

16
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.255
Secondly, if you specialize
in a particular area,

17
00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:08.620
you're seen as an expert in that area.

18
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.121
So even though potentially,
but let's take something like,

19
00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:19.220
let's say you specialized
in charity websites, right?

20
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.738
Now, admittedly, someone who didn't
specialize in charity websites could

21
00:01:23.738 --> 00:01:27.444
design that website and
build that website just like you could.

22
00:01:27.444 --> 00:01:32.173
However, because you're a specialist in
that area, you're seen as an expert, and

23
00:01:32.173 --> 00:01:34.880
that gives you an advantage
in winning the work.

24
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.205
And then finally, if you specialize,
you can charge more, right?

25
00:01:42.205 --> 00:01:44.397
Because you're more in demand and

26
00:01:44.397 --> 00:01:49.773
because there are fewer people that can do
what you do, you can charge higher rates.

27
00:01:49.773 --> 00:01:54.159
And so overall,
specialising is really good, but

28
00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:00.389
I know that it creates a lot of
nervousness in freelancers and agencies.

29
00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:05.323
And the reason that it does this,
there is this fundamental fear that if

30
00:02:05.323 --> 00:02:09.860
I specialize, I'm going to be
turning away work that I could do.

31
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.640
And you see so many agencies, where
you visit their website, and it says,

32
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.560
we do web design, we do print design,

33
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.510
we do branding design,
we do this, that, and the other.

34
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.287
And developers who go,
I could do WordPress, I could do Ruby,

35
00:02:23.287 --> 00:02:26.183
I could do and so it goes on.

36
00:02:26.183 --> 00:02:31.080
So let me clarify a little bit about
what I mean when I'm talking about

37
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.270
specializing.

38
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.540
First of all,
it doesn't mean turning away work, right?

39
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.099
I'm not suggesting that you,
if somebody comes to you and

40
00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.482
says, I've got WordPress build,
I'd like you to do.

41
00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:52.868
Then you go, actually, I'm sorry, but I
specialize only in, I don't know, Python.

42
00:02:52.868 --> 00:02:57.356
I'm not very up on programming
languages showing.

43
00:02:57.356 --> 00:03:00.895
You're not gonna turn that work away,
okay?

44
00:03:00.895 --> 00:03:05.834
Neither am I suggesting that you
redesign your website to say you only

45
00:03:05.834 --> 00:03:08.229
work in your specialism, okay?

46
00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:12.390
All I'm saying is that we're
gonna target our audience.

47
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.164
This audience that we wanna reach,

48
00:03:15.164 --> 00:03:20.535
the specialty in terms of the group
of people we're reaching out to.

49
00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:24.745
Secondly, it doesn't mean
you're gonna lack work, right?

50
00:03:24.745 --> 00:03:29.172
There's this big view that, well,

51
00:03:29.172 --> 00:03:33.725
if I specialize, there's not many people

52
00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:38.667
that are gonna wanna
hire me within that area.

53
00:03:38.667 --> 00:03:42.010
Okay, there's two things
I wanna say with that.

54
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.572
One is you're probably mentally
being constrained by geography,

55
00:03:46.572 --> 00:03:48.740
I come across this all the time.

56
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.419
So what you mean when you say
there aren't many people,

57
00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.530
say if you're specializing in charities.

58
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.950
Well, there aren't that many
charities that will hire me.

59
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.420
What you mean is there's not many
charities in my area, right?

60
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.480
But well wide,

61
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.060
there are a lot of charities more
than you could ever work through.

62
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.899
So that's one thing to say.

63
00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:10.600
Let go of geography,

64
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.660
because geography is a rubbish wave
of constraining your audience, okay?

65
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.230
Secondly, I'm not saying you only
ever specialize in one area.

66
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.283
And that brings me on to the last
concern that people often have,

67
00:04:25.283 --> 00:04:30.327
which is that the work will get boring
if I'm only ever doing charity websites.

68
00:04:30.327 --> 00:04:32.164
I'm gonna get sick of that.

69
00:04:32.164 --> 00:04:37.377
You can move from one specialism,
one focusing on one particular

70
00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:41.750
group to another, and
I've done that over the years.

71
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.750
So what does specializing
mean in real terms?

72
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.082
It means tailoring your message, right?

73
00:04:49.082 --> 00:04:51.897
Because you're focusing
on a specific audience,

74
00:04:51.897 --> 00:04:55.440
we can tailor our message to
better resonate with them, right?

75
00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.640
So we can talk about their problems and
their pain points and their issues.

76
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.290
Secondly, it means you're
gonna be heard more often.

77
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.910
Now, what does that mean?

78
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.760
Well, imagine taking a pebble and
throwing it in the ocean, right?

79
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.910
It's gonna just disappear,
okay, lost, gone forever.

80
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.441
Take that same pebble and
throw it into a tiny puddle,

81
00:05:18.441 --> 00:05:20.880
and it will create ripples, right?

82
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.962
So what I mean is if you're targeting
a specific group of people, the chances

83
00:05:26.962 --> 00:05:33.151
of that small group of people hearing
from you multiple times is good, right?

84
00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:37.111
People need to hear from you multiple
times before they're gonna be willing to

85
00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:38.620
sign up to their newsletter.

86
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.860
Your newsletter or mailing list or
whatever you wanna call it.

87
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.827
And then the final benefit of or
thing that specializing

88
00:05:47.827 --> 00:05:51.842
means is that you become
the go-to person for

89
00:05:51.842 --> 00:05:56.610
a particular sector,
a particular group of people.

90
00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.209
So for example,
when I was running my agency,

91
00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:04.178
we got to the point where
we decided to specialize or

92
00:06:04.178 --> 00:06:08.240
focus on marketing efforts
on the heritage sector,

93
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.317
which is areas of outstanding naturally,
your national parks,

94
00:06:13.317 --> 00:06:17.500
and old historic buildings,
and that kind of thing.

95
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.549
And we ended up winning 95%
of the heritage jobs that

96
00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:27.720
were in the market because
we became the go-to person.

97
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.064
If you've got heritage website,
you'd go to head scape.

98
00:06:32.064 --> 00:06:34.078
That was just the way it was.

99
00:06:34.078 --> 00:06:39.592
So that's what I mean by specializing,
is focusing on a particular audience or

100
00:06:39.592 --> 00:06:43.640
a particular sector so
that we can build their attention.

101
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:49.290
I don't mean specializing in WordPress,
right?

102
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.160
So you're not talking about
specializing in deliverables.

103
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.358
And we're certainly not talking about
specializing in something as broad

104
00:06:56.358 --> 00:07:00.088
as WordPress, which you might as
well say I'm not specializing,

105
00:07:00.088 --> 00:07:04.495
because WordPress consists of whatever
ridiculous percentage of websites.

106
00:07:04.495 --> 00:07:09.304
It has to be a very small, well defined
niche audience, and we'll get into that,

107
00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:11.550
how to find that audience in a minute.

108
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.130
And I'm also not saying you change
everything overnight, right?

109
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.313
You can take it slow.

110
00:07:17.313 --> 00:07:20.749
So jumping into a specialism full scale,

111
00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:25.960
saying I only work with charity
websites is a bad idea, right?

112
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.777
It's risky, it's dangerous, and you're
not gonna wanna not do it until it works.

113
00:07:30.777 --> 00:07:36.147
You don't need to redesign your website
to focus exclusively on your specialism,

114
00:07:36.147 --> 00:07:36.922
all right?

115
00:07:36.922 --> 00:07:42.487
And you don't need to turn away work
that's outside of your chosen area.

116
00:07:42.487 --> 00:07:47.464
Instead, what we're gonna do is create
a separate campaign and landing page, and

117
00:07:47.464 --> 00:07:51.393
all the rest of it is aimed at
the audience we're trying to reach.

118
00:07:51.393 --> 00:07:57.457
And just as a slight aside at this point,
Whenever I talk

119
00:07:57.457 --> 00:08:03.472
about anything in marketing terms with
any agency or freelancer I ever talk to,

120
00:08:03.472 --> 00:08:08.790
their instant reaction is,
I need to update my website, right?

121
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:13.392
Stop updating your website
every five minutes, right?

122
00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:14.881
It's not gonna make any difference.

123
00:08:14.881 --> 00:08:16.760
It's not gonna help.

124
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.035
Your failure to when you work is
not because of your website, right?

125
00:08:21.035 --> 00:08:23.934
It's because you're not
targeting the right people and

126
00:08:23.934 --> 00:08:26.357
providing them with value regularly,
right?

127
00:08:26.357 --> 00:08:32.786
Your website is a minor part of
your ability to win work at best.
