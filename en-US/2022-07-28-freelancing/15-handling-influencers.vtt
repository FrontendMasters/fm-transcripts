00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.790
We wanna reach out to our
influencers at this point.

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.740
Now, there are many different ways of
doing this and many different formats.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.830
But let's first of all look at
the trouble with influencers, right?

4
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.189
I get dozens of emails every week,

5
00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.860
pitching something to me, right?

6
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.565
And I'm a relatively small influencer
in a very niche field, right?

7
00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:32.650
And it just drives me nuts, right?

8
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.290
Even a niche influencer like myself
get dozens of emails asking me for

9
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.410
links, to promote various
stuff via social media.

10
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.148
And with so much noise, a single email
is not gonna get their attention, right?

11
00:00:46.148 --> 00:00:49.469
Now we've sent them a couple of emails,
we have warmed them up a little bit.

12
00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.524
But really, if you wanna start building
a relationship with these people and

13
00:00:54.524 --> 00:00:58.950
you want them to be promoting
the report and that kind of thing.

14
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.345
You're gonna need to engage with
them a little bit better than that.

15
00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:05.550
You're gonna need to build
a relationship with them, right?

16
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.132
The best way of doing
that is to be helpful.

17
00:01:08.132 --> 00:01:13.728
So, following them on social media, paying
attention to what they're talking about,

18
00:01:13.728 --> 00:01:16.279
contributing to those conversations.

19
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.512
Providing with help where you can,
be encouraging and

20
00:01:22.512 --> 00:01:26.933
grateful, amplifying their content for
them and

21
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:30.313
re-sharing it, that kind of thing.

22
00:01:30.313 --> 00:01:34.582
And then only after you've built
a bit of a report to the point where

23
00:01:34.582 --> 00:01:39.097
maybe they've contacted you directly
once or twice and thanked you.

24
00:01:39.097 --> 00:01:44.725
Then at that point, you're probably
in a position to reach out to them.

25
00:01:44.725 --> 00:01:49.214
And don't just immediately email them,
but over social media just ask them,

26
00:01:49.214 --> 00:01:52.013
is it all right if I drop you an email,
all right?

27
00:01:52.013 --> 00:01:54.683
So nurture that relationship first of all,

28
00:01:54.683 --> 00:01:57.361
rather than just going
in with a cold email.

29
00:01:57.361 --> 00:02:01.567
And when you are emailing influencers,

30
00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:06.389
basically, the key there
is to really go in and

31
00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:11.474
thank them for
all that they've shared online.

32
00:02:11.474 --> 00:02:16.605
Be very honest about that you'd like
their help, tell them that you wanna

33
00:02:16.605 --> 00:02:22.090
share stuff, but only after you've
kind of established that relationship.

34
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.232
Now if you get lucky earlier
on in the process when

35
00:02:26.232 --> 00:02:30.983
you reach out to them previously,
you might have either got an influencer

36
00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:34.830
who is willing to put their name
on this and do this with you.

37
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.504
In which case that changes
the ballgame entirely,

38
00:02:38.504 --> 00:02:42.610
because you can use their name and
reputation to promote the report.

39
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.342
Or alternatively, they might have been
willing to be interviewed for the report,

40
00:02:47.342 --> 00:02:50.670
in which case make sure you
mentioned them in the report.

41
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.373
And now you can go back and say, hey,
thanks so much for that interview,

42
00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:58.050
I've included you in the report,
here's a free copy of it, right?.

43
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.571
When it comes to emailing
influencing publications, again,

44
00:03:03.571 --> 00:03:06.040
I've provided you with a sample email.

45
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.726
I'm not gonna go into all the details
of why it is the way it is.

46
00:03:10.726 --> 00:03:13.924
But it's basically talking
about what the report is,

47
00:03:13.924 --> 00:03:17.060
whether they'd share it
with their audience, etc.

48
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.499
So, you've done your best with your

49
00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:28.351
initial list to promote
sort of the course and

50
00:03:28.351 --> 00:03:32.833
the report and you've shared it around.

51
00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:37.578
But we're not done yet because it's
still gonna be a relatively small

52
00:03:37.578 --> 00:03:42.340
list you may well have less than 50
people on your list at this point.

53
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.545
So we're gonna start, building on that and
taking it to the next level.

54
00:03:48.545 --> 00:03:51.858
But before we do that,
are there any questions out of that,

55
00:03:51.858 --> 00:03:53.635
what we've had so far?

56
00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:56.003
&gt;&gt; Does Paul recommend a separate domain,
or

57
00:03:56.003 --> 00:04:00.285
removing all of the navigation on the rest
of your site, or a landing pitch?

58
00:04:00.285 --> 00:04:03.051
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a fair comment,
I do get that.

59
00:04:06.095 --> 00:04:11.615
I would probably stick with your
same domain, why complicate things?

60
00:04:11.615 --> 00:04:16.002
But just create subdomain
would seem logical to me.

61
00:04:16.002 --> 00:04:19.880
But I would remove all the navigation
to the rest of the site.

62
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.750
So that you're not overly pushing your
services and things alongside that.

63
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.560
So if you look at most of my,
well, cards on the table, right?

64
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.030
At the end of this, I'm gonna give
you a link to get the slide deck.

65
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.248
But am I gonna leave it there,
of course I'm not, right?

66
00:04:37.248 --> 00:04:40.430
I'm also gonna ask you to
sign up to my newsletter.

67
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.164
So when you go to that page,
you're gonna see for

68
00:04:43.164 --> 00:04:47.047
yourself that is not part of the main
blog world sites on a subdomain.

69
00:04:47.047 --> 00:04:50.423
But there's no navigation,
there's no mention of my services or

70
00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:52.240
anything like that there.

71
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.970
So that's the kind of
thing you're aiming at.

72
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.099
So you can see for yourself when
you download the slide deck, so

73
00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:58.291
hopefully that helps.
