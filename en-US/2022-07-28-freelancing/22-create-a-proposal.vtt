1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.922
Let's talk about proposals, right?

2
00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:08.127
Cuz I really wanna give you as
much as I can about how I do it.

3
00:00:08.127 --> 00:00:12.243
Whether that's always gonna be suited to
you and your situation, I don't know.

4
00:00:12.243 --> 00:00:17.960
First thing to say is in many cases, the
proposal for me is gonna be a formality.

5
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.560
The client has already decided they
want to work with me before they even

6
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.350
contacted me.

7
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.870
And, I've discussed budget,
I've discussed scope.

8
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.990
It's all been agreed and
that the proposal really is a matter of

9
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.950
me writing that all down so
that it's in a written format.

10
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.706
However that said, I do make an effort
with my proposals simply because I know

11
00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:44.960
other people might read them, right?

12
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.915
So I'm actually gonna show you what
I include in my proposals cuz one of

13
00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:51.850
the weird things is that everybody seems
to be really secretive about this stuff.

14
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.361
And it's like that's his secret
sauce that winds and work.

15
00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:59.963
And it's like you never get to see other
people's proposals so what the heck,

16
00:00:59.963 --> 00:01:00.810
let's do it.

17
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.630
So this is the,
I use a tool called qwiil, qwiil.com.

18
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.398
I think I might have
a link in here somewhere.

19
00:01:11.398 --> 00:01:14.457
And I like it because
you've got templates.

20
00:01:14.457 --> 00:01:19.662
And you can just fill in the template,
and it does it a lot faster.

21
00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:26.522
So yeah, basically the first section in my
proposals is called engagement evaluation.

22
00:01:26.522 --> 00:01:30.766
And I just start by explaining
the need that they have for my help,

23
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:31.930
why they want me.

24
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.002
I avoid talking about the company because
they already know who they are, so

25
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:42.007
many people start their proposals, so
and so is a SME in the retail sector.

26
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:45.200
Well, they know that,
why are you telling them that.

27
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.898
But to repeat back to them why
they need to hire you, well,

28
00:01:48.898 --> 00:01:51.167
that's a whole another ball game.

29
00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:55.181
The second section I have is objectives,
where I outline a small number of

30
00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.721
objectives that the project
should deliver.

31
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:01.729
For example, one objective might be
to increase the number of leads.

32
00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.992
So that really focuses people
on the benefits that working

33
00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:09.667
with me will provide, because those are
the objectives they're trying to reach.

34
00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:11.160
Then we've got measures of success.

35
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.588
By the way, these blue bits in between
their testimonials from various clients.

36
00:02:16.588 --> 00:02:19.810
They're always good to put in, especially
if they're big names, it always helps.

37
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.590
Anyway, measures of success.

38
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.466
So for each of my objectives,

39
00:02:23.466 --> 00:02:28.920
we need a way of knowing whether those
objectives have been achieved or not.

40
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.508
So I write down some how we're gonna
measure success, and that reassures

41
00:02:33.508 --> 00:02:38.701
the client and sets you up for more work
when you can actually demonstrate success.

42
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:41.434
When you go back at the end of
the project, and go look, we agreed with

43
00:02:41.434 --> 00:02:44.805
these, I've delivered all of these, then
they're more likely to hire you again.

44
00:02:44.805 --> 00:02:46.678
So I include that in there.

45
00:02:46.678 --> 00:02:47.892
Next section is the value.

46
00:02:47.892 --> 00:02:51.976
Now a lot of people skip over this,
the value to the company.

47
00:02:51.976 --> 00:02:56.857
For each of my objectives,
I attempt to tie it to a tangible,

48
00:02:56.857 --> 00:02:59.746
ideally monetary return, right?

49
00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:02.273
Doing this makes your price
look a lot more reasonable.

50
00:03:02.273 --> 00:03:06.774
Now we go into a conversation
about pricing over lunch, and

51
00:03:06.774 --> 00:03:09.934
the subject value brace pricing came up.

52
00:03:09.934 --> 00:03:14.555
This idea of your fee is related to

53
00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:18.854
the benefit that it provides.

54
00:03:18.854 --> 00:03:21.968
It's a really tricky one to do.

55
00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:24.940
And in most cases, for
the type of work I do at least,

56
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.046
I haven't been able to make it work.

57
00:03:27.046 --> 00:03:31.969
But what I have taken away
from value-based pricing is

58
00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:36.677
this idea of showing the value
that you are going to be

59
00:03:36.677 --> 00:03:41.397
providing ideally in monetary terms,
so I do that.

60
00:03:41.397 --> 00:03:43.670
Then we get into the methodology.

61
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.766
Now, so
this is more what I'm gonna do, but

62
00:03:46.766 --> 00:03:50.320
I always create options for people, right?

63
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.232
I always try and offer a client multiple
options, so normally it's three.

64
00:03:56.232 --> 00:04:02.638
And basically there's one that is going
to come in just under their budget,

65
00:04:02.638 --> 00:04:07.055
right, so
whatever we agreed the budget should be.

66
00:04:07.055 --> 00:04:11.091
Then we're gonna do a second one that's
slightly higher than their budget,

67
00:04:11.091 --> 00:04:14.145
with a few extra bells and
whistles that are appropriate.

68
00:04:14.145 --> 00:04:18.274
And then the third one,
I totally ignored their budget and

69
00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:23.175
just spec it up as if I was doing it
as good as I possibly could, right?

70
00:04:23.175 --> 00:04:29.387
Amazing, it's amazing how many times they
end up picking the deluxe version, right?

71
00:04:29.387 --> 00:04:34.032
If you always stick within their
budget that the client has said,

72
00:04:34.032 --> 00:04:37.850
you're throwing away good work, basically.

73
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.427
And you're not always giving
the client the best solution

74
00:04:41.427 --> 00:04:46.440
either because you're having to stick
within the budget they've given you.

75
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.120
Then after that,
I get into basically how great I am.

76
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.950
So I have a section that outlines
the benefits you in particular provide.

77
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.320
So define both why you're a right fit,
but also why you're not.

78
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.430
Now that may seem a strange thing to do.

79
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.134
So just to give you a snippet of
how I do that, I say at the end,

80
00:05:10.134 --> 00:05:14.664
ultimately whether you hire me comes
down to your ambitions for digital.

81
00:05:14.664 --> 00:05:18.452
If you consider digital key to
your long-term business success,

82
00:05:18.452 --> 00:05:20.354
I'm probably the right choice.

83
00:05:20.354 --> 00:05:25.067
However, if it is seen as an important but
secondary component,

84
00:05:25.067 --> 00:05:28.850
there may be better and
cheaper suppliers, right?

85
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.470
So I'm positioning myself in a very
particular place in the market.

86
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.220
And I begin that section by saying I'm
not the cheapest option there, right?

87
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.508
So don't be afraid to exclude
yourself sometimes because actually

88
00:05:43.508 --> 00:05:48.435
saying what you're not reinforces
what your others aren't.

89
00:05:48.435 --> 00:05:52.318
Sounds like that's kicked off something
in the chatroom, doesn't surprise me,

90
00:05:52.318 --> 00:05:53.600
often creates a reaction.

91
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.065
Yeah, what you got Mark?

92
00:05:56.065 --> 00:06:02.026
&gt;&gt; Does the deluxe version cost a lot less
or bit less than the value to the company?

93
00:06:02.026 --> 00:06:05.659
&gt;&gt; The deluxe version,
the value to the company,

94
00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:10.253
I don't even try and
tie it to the value of the company, right?

95
00:06:10.253 --> 00:06:15.259
As I'd say over lunch,
I think am getting myself in such

96
00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:20.811
trouble with the people that
promote value-based pricing.

97
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:23.659
And I've got a good friend,
Jonathan Stock,

98
00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:26.151
who really pushes value based pricing.

99
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:29.813
And to his credit,
has made it work really well for himself.

100
00:06:29.813 --> 00:06:32.651
So I don't know what
he's doing that I'm not.

101
00:06:32.651 --> 00:06:37.458
But I haven't managed to get
value-based pricing to feel

102
00:06:37.458 --> 00:06:40.706
like I'm not just ripping people off.

103
00:06:40.706 --> 00:06:47.408
And I understand in principle of tying the
value you provide to the value that you,

104
00:06:47.408 --> 00:06:52.183
sorry, the value that you
charge to the value you create.

105
00:06:52.183 --> 00:06:55.305
I do I understand that in principle.

106
00:06:55.305 --> 00:07:00.110
But, you can't make the guarantees that
you will provide the value that you

107
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.550
say you'll provide.

108
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.130
I think it's very hard in
most situations to do that.

109
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.740
So I don't tend to work in that way.

110
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.734
So my deluxe version really is just priced
at whatever I think the right way of

111
00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:16.305
doing this project is.

112
00:07:16.305 --> 00:07:19.653
And I just basically,
no budget is a constraint.

113
00:07:19.653 --> 00:07:22.518
Now it may work out.

114
00:07:22.518 --> 00:07:27.486
I mean, obviously, I don't ever allow that
figure to go over the potential value

115
00:07:27.486 --> 00:07:32.097
that I think I can bring in, otherwise
it's not the right solution, is it?

116
00:07:32.097 --> 00:07:34.051
If it's gonna lose the company money,

117
00:07:34.051 --> 00:07:36.848
then it can't possibly be
the right solution for them.

118
00:07:36.848 --> 00:07:41.575
So it will come under that figure,
but it may not come under it by a lot,

119
00:07:41.575 --> 00:07:43.430
at least in the first year.

120
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.077
It may even make a slight
loss in the first year, but

121
00:07:46.077 --> 00:07:49.190
then over subsequent
years it'll make it up.

122
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.179
So yeah, I don't tie it that closely or
pay that much attention.

123
00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:57.581
But that's just me, I mean,
there are other ways of doing this stuff.

124
00:07:57.581 --> 00:08:04.680
Okay, then I get into logistics,
how long is it gonna take?

125
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.460
Who's gonna do it?

126
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.355
What's the role of both myself and
the client?

127
00:08:07.355 --> 00:08:09.972
All of that kind of stuff.

128
00:08:09.972 --> 00:08:14.306
And then actually, because I use this
app called Quiller, allows me to create

129
00:08:14.306 --> 00:08:18.708
an interactive pricing table that lets
people pick whatever option they want,

130
00:08:18.708 --> 00:08:20.762
lets them change certain criteria.

131
00:08:20.762 --> 00:08:23.407
So for example,
I often do usability testing, and

132
00:08:23.407 --> 00:08:27.500
they can change the number of people I
do testing with to adjust the price.

133
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:32.060
They get it all right as they want it,
they click the Accept button, and

134
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.794
then they can actually sign there and
then within the app.

135
00:08:35.794 --> 00:08:37.196
I don't always do it that way.

136
00:08:37.196 --> 00:08:41.726
Because for example, when I'm working
with very large organizations,

137
00:08:41.726 --> 00:08:44.072
they all have their own T's and C's.

138
00:08:44.072 --> 00:08:47.516
They have their own procurement policies
and all the rest of that, and so

139
00:08:47.516 --> 00:08:50.523
my T's and C's almost always
get rejected in that situation.

140
00:08:50.523 --> 00:08:54.140
But where I can,
I do it all within the app.

141
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.709
So that's my proposals and
kinda gives you a sense of those.

142
00:08:57.709 --> 00:09:02.110
Now there's one thing that, I don't
know whether you've spotted it, but

143
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.849
there's something that's been
missing from my process here.

144
00:09:05.849 --> 00:09:11.298
Something that is very normal and
normally appears but

145
00:09:11.298 --> 00:09:14.740
hasn't, and that's pitching.

146
00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.716
I don't pitch, okay?

147
00:09:17.716 --> 00:09:22.519
And I think if you can build the process
that I've talked about here, and

148
00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:27.005
if you can get through all of the,
if you can build up that audience,

149
00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:32.201
if you can nurture that audience, if you
can handle them right as they come in,

150
00:09:32.201 --> 00:09:35.862
then you're not gonna have to pitch for
work, right?

151
00:09:35.862 --> 00:09:40.168
Because the client will already
know they want to work with you.

152
00:09:40.168 --> 00:09:45.209
And occasionally,
there was a period of time when I would

153
00:09:45.209 --> 00:09:50.670
do the occasional pitch because
the company had said so,

154
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:56.779
we've got to procurement and yeah,
I'm sorry we have to do a pitch.

155
00:09:56.779 --> 00:10:01.670
I mean, I'd only ever do them if they
basically turned around and said yeah,

156
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.525
we are gonna go with you but
we have to jump through the hoops.

157
00:10:05.525 --> 00:10:10.098
These days I'm very fortunate, and
I'm actually at the point where I say,

158
00:10:10.098 --> 00:10:14.256
look, if you're going out to tender,
I'm not taking part in this.

159
00:10:14.256 --> 00:10:17.603
Even if you turn around to me and
say we want you,

160
00:10:17.603 --> 00:10:23.494
cuz I think that's unfair to the other
people that have been played along, right?

161
00:10:23.494 --> 00:10:26.270
So I don't play in that
game at all now but

162
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:31.860
I fully recognize that's only because
I'm now in a privileged position.

163
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.762
But what you will find is that the amount
of pitching you have to do considerably

164
00:10:36.762 --> 00:10:40.252
drops off, because people
are coming to work with you,

165
00:10:40.252 --> 00:10:42.570
you're not just another supplier.

166
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.410
So really that's all I
wanted to say on that.

167
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:46.960
I do wanna leave you with that checklist.

168
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.040
I'm doing a checklist at the end
of each of the sections.

169
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.920
So most of my checklist for
turning leads into projects.

170
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.261
Get yourself a CRM to track every lead
that comes in, you won't regret it.

171
00:10:58.261 --> 00:11:02.653
It's a little bit money but
it's a business expense well-worth paying.

172
00:11:02.653 --> 00:11:08.451
Pursue every lead to destruction,
don't give up people, keep going.

173
00:11:08.451 --> 00:11:12.654
Arrange a call with any lead as soon
as possible, get them on the phone,

174
00:11:12.654 --> 00:11:13.718
get them on Zoom.

175
00:11:13.718 --> 00:11:16.694
It makes a huge difference to
building the relationship.

176
00:11:16.694 --> 00:11:20.058
When talking to a client act like
an advisor not as a supplier.

177
00:11:20.058 --> 00:11:23.539
They've been used to you being
advising them and giving them advice,

178
00:11:23.539 --> 00:11:25.375
they want you to carry on doing that.

179
00:11:25.375 --> 00:11:29.178
They don't want you to suddenly turn into,
I don't know,

180
00:11:29.178 --> 00:11:34.516
one of the servants in Downton Abbey going
yes sir, no sir, whatever you want sir.

181
00:11:34.516 --> 00:11:38.320
Be that advisor they've come to expect.

182
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:44.860
Ensure your proposals demonstrate value,
the value that you're going to bring.

183
00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:50.405
And offered lots of different options, at
least when three is about right actually,

184
00:11:50.405 --> 00:11:55.580
never offer a single option because
there's always opportunities to upsell.

185
00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:00.849
So I've hit you with a lot of stuff in
this workshop, and there are a lot of

186
00:12:00.849 --> 00:12:05.340
steps involved and it's gonna take
you time to process all of that.

187
00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.352
But just as you go away from today,
I wanna try and

188
00:12:08.352 --> 00:12:12.050
leave you with just the basic next steps,
right?

189
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:16.353
You can come back and go over this
material as many times as you need to.

190
00:12:16.353 --> 00:12:20.005
I suggest you come back to it
as you're going through it.

191
00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:23.250
So watch each section as
you're implementing it, but

192
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.079
just to give you the next
steps to get you going.

193
00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.967
Step one,
decide on who you wanna work with,

194
00:12:28.967 --> 00:12:31.481
that's all you got to do to begin with.

195
00:12:31.481 --> 00:12:36.821
Step two, work on that survey so that you
can better understand those people and

196
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:40.818
what they need,
the problems that they're facing, etc.

197
00:12:40.818 --> 00:12:43.677
And make contact with them by doing that.

198
00:12:43.677 --> 00:12:48.151
Then you wanna build that landing page
with the associated email course and

199
00:12:48.151 --> 00:12:50.787
you'll report to encourage more sign ups.

200
00:12:50.787 --> 00:12:55.795
And then you wanna nurture
the relationships over time via email.

201
00:12:55.795 --> 00:13:00.570
And get organized with how you
deal with those incoming leads.
