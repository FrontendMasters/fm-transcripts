00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
Let's move on and look at, okay,

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.990
how are we going to find our
minimum viable audience, right?

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.031
So this is the smallest group
of people we can find that

4
00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:19.184
is capable of generating enough
work to keep us busy for

5
00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:22.670
at least two or three years, right?

6
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.340
That's what we're after.

7
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.882
And this audience has to have
certain characteristics for

8
00:00:30.882 --> 00:00:33.491
this to work well, right?

9
00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:39.167
So let me run through some of the
characteristics that you're gonna look for

10
00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:43.610
as you come to choose,
to think who your audience might be.

11
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.101
First of all, we are looking for

12
00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:53.062
an audience that provides
certain characteristics.

13
00:00:53.062 --> 00:00:57.790
And one of those characteristics is
that they boost and amplify your voice.

14
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.514
Well, what does that mean?

15
00:01:02.786 --> 00:01:05.971
There are some groups of people,

16
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:11.318
some sectors that have got
a strong sense of community,

17
00:01:11.318 --> 00:01:15.094
right, that talk to one another a lot.

18
00:01:15.094 --> 00:01:20.954
So for example, developers, right, they
share a lot, they talk to one another.

19
00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:25.305
There are conferences you can go on,
there's blogs you can read.

20
00:01:25.305 --> 00:01:27.445
They interact with each other a lot.

21
00:01:27.445 --> 00:01:32.035
And so that means that you're more
likely to get, anything that you put

22
00:01:32.035 --> 00:01:36.852
out into a sector like that is more likely
to get handed around the sector and

23
00:01:36.852 --> 00:01:41.391
promoted across the sector without
you having to do additional work.

24
00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:46.390
While there are other sectors that are
highly competitive with one another and

25
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.050
they don't talk to one another, right?

26
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.090
And so those, you're not gonna
get that same amplification.

27
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.221
So you're ideally looking for a sector
where there is a sense of community.

28
00:01:58.221 --> 00:01:59.920
And we'll come on to that in
a little bit more in just a second.

29
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.003
But there's some more fundamental
questions we need to ask about our chosen

30
00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:06.890
target audience,
whoever it is we're tryna reach.

31
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.486
For a start, can they afford us, right?

32
00:02:11.486 --> 00:02:16.070
Before you worry about anything else,
really you need to establish whether

33
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.028
the audience that you wanna reach out to
can afford the kind of services you offer.

34
00:02:21.028 --> 00:02:24.721
Have they got the kind of size of clients,
right?

35
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:29.119
Because if they can't, then you might as

36
00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:33.525
well forget it, they're no good for us.

37
00:02:33.525 --> 00:02:38.569
Now, going back to this thing
about boosting your message and

38
00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.322
having a community and
passing your name around, right,

39
00:02:43.322 --> 00:02:45.850
which is what we wanna happen.

40
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.691
One of the things that's really
good to look for in a sector is,

41
00:02:49.691 --> 00:02:52.310
do people move around
a lot in that sector?

42
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.235
So do people tend to
work at one company for

43
00:02:55.235 --> 00:02:59.840
a few years and then go to another
company within the same sector?

44
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.986
That is a great way of getting your name
and reputation spread around, right?

45
00:03:04.986 --> 00:03:09.569
So for example, you remember I was
talking about an insurance company

46
00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.375
earlier that I'm doing loads of work for.

47
00:03:12.375 --> 00:03:16.909
Well, my primary point of contact
in one of those companies is now

48
00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.885
moving to an American insurance company.

49
00:03:19.885 --> 00:03:24.710
Aha, now, we're opening up the American
insurance company sector as well as

50
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.281
the UK, brilliant, loving it, right?

51
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:30.157
So if people are moving around
in the sector, that's good.

52
00:03:30.157 --> 00:03:34.157
And you just look at people's
job history on LinkedIn and

53
00:03:34.157 --> 00:03:38.670
you can quickly get an idea of
whether that's happening or not.

54
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.079
So can they afford you?

55
00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.024
Do they move around?

56
00:03:42.024 --> 00:03:43.962
Do they talk to one another, right?

57
00:03:43.962 --> 00:03:48.504
So some sectors are very protective of
things like their intellectual property.

58
00:03:48.504 --> 00:03:52.140
So there's little communication
between the different companies.

59
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.387
Others, on the other hand, are very open,
and you'll want the latter.

60
00:03:55.387 --> 00:04:00.611
So some of the sectors I've worked in,
for example, higher education,

61
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:04.824
they talk to each other a lot,
they don't really compete,

62
00:04:04.824 --> 00:04:09.061
at least in the UK,
I don't know what it's like over here.

63
00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:13.153
Charities, they don't feel like
they're competing very much,

64
00:04:13.153 --> 00:04:15.210
they tend to talk to one another.

65
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.060
Is there a community, right?

66
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.797
So does the sector have dedicated blogs,
conferences, online communities?

67
00:04:22.797 --> 00:04:24.396
Do they have forums?

68
00:04:24.396 --> 00:04:30.600
Do they have mailing lists,
places where that sector,

69
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.560
that community assemble, right?

70
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.864
So for example, if I know I wanna
reach developers like you guys,

71
00:04:39.864 --> 00:04:46.917
I know that I want to contribute to Stack
Overflow, right, cuz that's where you are.

72
00:04:46.917 --> 00:04:52.281
I know I maybe wanna write
a guest post on, I don't know,

73
00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:57.970
I have forgotten the name of the blog,
the Chris Coyier, CSS 1.

74
00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:58.814
&gt;&gt; CSS Tricks.

75
00:04:58.814 --> 00:05:00.235
&gt;&gt; CSS Tricks, that's it.

76
00:05:00.235 --> 00:05:03.222
I might wanna work right there, or

77
00:05:03.222 --> 00:05:09.313
there are places I know that you guys
go [LAUGH] that I can go and find you.

78
00:05:09.313 --> 00:05:13.342
And then finally, are there
influences in that community, right?

79
00:05:13.342 --> 00:05:18.167
Are there people that kind of
stand out within that community?

80
00:05:18.167 --> 00:05:23.299
So a great example of that was in higher
education, all right, when I decided to

81
00:05:23.299 --> 00:05:28.296
target higher education in the UK,
with one, one higher education client.

82
00:05:28.296 --> 00:05:29.291
It had gone really well.

83
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:31.990
I'd really enjoyed the project and
I thought I wanna do more of that.

84
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:38.784
So at the end of the project,
I asked my client, where do you guys meet?

85
00:05:38.784 --> 00:05:41.078
Have you got any conferences?

86
00:05:41.078 --> 00:05:44.306
Have you got any blogs or
anything like that?

87
00:05:44.306 --> 00:05:50.166
And he said, well, we do have this mailing
list called the IWMW mailing lists,

88
00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:54.370
the Institutional Web Managers Workshop
mailing list.

89
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.720
Wow, what a snappy title that had, right?

90
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.782
And I tried to join it, and
I couldn't, because I didn't

91
00:06:02.782 --> 00:06:08.067
have an ac.uk domain name,
which is the equivalent of edu.

92
00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:11.932
And they knew that I was an evil
commercial person trying to sneak in

93
00:06:11.932 --> 00:06:12.560
and sell.

94
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.062
But instead of giving up, I actually
contacted the guy around the list and

95
00:06:18.062 --> 00:06:22.781
said, can I join it and
just listen in and see what's going on?

96
00:06:22.781 --> 00:06:26.518
And I actually started chatting with this
guy cuz he was obviously an influencer in

97
00:06:26.518 --> 00:06:27.121
the sector.

98
00:06:27.121 --> 00:06:28.310
He ran this list.

99
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.290
I found out he ran a conference, and
we've become really good friends.

100
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.001
And to this day, I've never asked
him to sell anything for me,

101
00:06:37.001 --> 00:06:39.462
I've never been pushy at all with him,.

102
00:06:39.462 --> 00:06:44.020
But I've actually keynoted his conference
for about ten years on the trot.

103
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.568
And I've become a big part of that
community just by joining in and

104
00:06:48.568 --> 00:06:49.900
offering advice.

105
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.379
So looking for people like that
as well is really worthwhile.

106
00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:58.488
So don't be afraid to go niche when it
comes to thinking about your sector.

107
00:06:58.488 --> 00:07:03.076
I'm hoping even right now as you're
listening to this, you're beginning to

108
00:07:03.076 --> 00:07:07.801
think of different sectors maybe that
you've got a little bit experience in, or

109
00:07:07.801 --> 00:07:09.272
that you've worked in.

110
00:07:09.272 --> 00:07:13.578
But you'll have this desire to go broad,
right,

111
00:07:13.578 --> 00:07:18.203
because you're afraid of
not having enough people.

112
00:07:18.203 --> 00:07:21.222
But this one sector doesn't need
to support you in isolation.

113
00:07:21.222 --> 00:07:24.292
There's no reason why you
can't do multiple sectors.

114
00:07:24.292 --> 00:07:29.989
So don't be afraid to go niche, because,
actually, you could do, I don't know,

115
00:07:29.989 --> 00:07:35.230
instead of higher education, I could
have done just universities, right?

116
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.531
That immediately knocks out all
the further education people,

117
00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:40.128
that enables me to go.

118
00:07:40.128 --> 00:07:42.954
And effectively,
that's what I ended up doing,

119
00:07:42.954 --> 00:07:46.734
because they were the ones that
could afford my services, right?

120
00:07:46.734 --> 00:07:53.274
And that was actually enough to sustain
my agency for quite a long time.

121
00:07:53.274 --> 00:08:00.290
But I could have added to that,
charities, or mental health charities,

122
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:06.986
or charities that work with a particular
community or whatever else.

123
00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:12.219
Cuz you can have more than one sector
on a go, that's not a problem.

124
00:08:12.219 --> 00:08:17.370
And it doesn't take that
many people to sustain

125
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:21.756
a business, that many organizations.

126
00:08:21.756 --> 00:08:25.386
If the sector has just got
a handful of publications,

127
00:08:25.386 --> 00:08:30.305
a few events it puts on every year,
it's got one or two communities, and

128
00:08:30.305 --> 00:08:34.984
approximately maybe 1,000 companies
in the sector as a whole,

129
00:08:34.984 --> 00:08:37.106
that's about the right size.

130
00:08:37.106 --> 00:08:39.608
It doesn't need to be enormous.

131
00:08:39.608 --> 00:08:44.714
So as you're thinking about possible
sectors that might fit into this category,

132
00:08:44.714 --> 00:08:48.492
I would also suggest that you
consider your own experience.

133
00:08:48.492 --> 00:08:52.713
If you've got experience before,
look at your own portfolio of clients,

134
00:08:52.713 --> 00:08:56.473
look at previous employers,
who have you worked with in the past.

135
00:08:56.473 --> 00:08:58.784
Are there any reoccurring sectors, right?

136
00:08:58.784 --> 00:09:01.802
Do you have any good contacts
in a particular sector?

137
00:09:01.802 --> 00:09:06.814
Maybe somebody that knows a lot of people,

138
00:09:06.814 --> 00:09:09.745
he's is an influencer.

139
00:09:09.745 --> 00:09:13.801
But don't feel constrained by
that experience necessarily.

140
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:20.317
It's more important to find a sector that
excites you than has the proper criteria,

141
00:09:20.317 --> 00:09:25.364
because if it's a sector you don't
really care that much about,

142
00:09:25.364 --> 00:09:29.056
then you're not really gonna really go for
it.

143
00:09:29.056 --> 00:09:32.784
More important, it's something you
really enjoy, got passionate about.

144
00:09:32.784 --> 00:09:36.650
So as I said, there's three sectors
that I've targeted over the years.

145
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.390
So I did UK charities for a while.

146
00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:46.622
That one went pretty well,
I had a good degree of success there.

147
00:09:46.622 --> 00:09:50.885
Worked with, not top tier charities,
I mean we did a few,

148
00:09:50.885 --> 00:09:55.677
we did Oxfam, which is a big charity,
I've worked with UNICEF.

149
00:09:55.677 --> 00:09:59.903
So that was a few of those, but there was
a lot of kind of middling ones underneath

150
00:09:59.903 --> 00:10:03.073
that, that were really good
long-term sustaining work.

151
00:10:03.073 --> 00:10:07.836
There were loads of charity,
conferences, and publications,

152
00:10:07.836 --> 00:10:12.090
and online communities, and
I just joined in with those.

153
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.037
I did the same with Heritage,
I mentioned that earlier.

154
00:10:15.037 --> 00:10:18.419
And then of course, universities is
where I got on this mailing list.

155
00:10:18.419 --> 00:10:24.316
And that's quite an interesting one,
the universities one,

156
00:10:24.316 --> 00:10:29.220
because it's very easy to
give up too soon, right?

157
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:34.095
So I went to this mailing list, I couldn't
join it, but I didn't just give up at that

158
00:10:34.095 --> 00:10:38.854
point, I contacted the guy that ran it,
and he gave me very strict instructions.

159
00:10:38.854 --> 00:10:42.758
Obviously, I said, look,
I'm just trying to learn about the sector.

160
00:10:42.758 --> 00:10:47.580
And he said, fine, you can be on
the mailing list, but you cannot post.

161
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:52.385
Well, it would be tempting to think then,
but why am I bothering, what's the point?

162
00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:56.291
But I did sincerely wanna learn about
the sector and understand it better.

163
00:10:56.291 --> 00:10:59.866
So I joined the mailing list and
just read what their problems were,

164
00:10:59.866 --> 00:11:03.203
what their challenges were,
what they were struggling with.

165
00:11:03.203 --> 00:11:07.950
And actually over time, there started to
be questions that I felt I could answer.

166
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:12.674
So I wrote up my answer and sent it to
the guy that ran the list and said,

167
00:11:12.674 --> 00:11:13.826
can I post this?

168
00:11:13.826 --> 00:11:19.670
And he would say, yeah, that's fine,
you haven't, so go for it.

169
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:24.636
And I did that again, and again, and
again, and eventually, he said, look,

170
00:11:24.636 --> 00:11:26.951
Paul, just post, but don't sell.

171
00:11:26.951 --> 00:11:29.399
So that's what I did, and
I started joining in.

172
00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:33.674
And then I discovered they had
a conference every year, and

173
00:11:33.674 --> 00:11:39.507
I said to Brian, the guy that ran the
conference, can I speak at the conference?

174
00:11:39.507 --> 00:11:42.923
And he said, no,
you're commercial, you can't.

175
00:11:42.923 --> 00:11:45.010
And I said, can I come to the conference?

176
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:48.786
Yes, if you pay, and you don't sell.

177
00:11:48.786 --> 00:11:50.230
So I went along and I joined in.

178
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:54.847
I bought everybody drinks, always a good
way of getting people on your side,

179
00:11:54.847 --> 00:11:56.350
especially in Britain.

180
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.402
So I had a great time,
met loads of people.

181
00:11:59.402 --> 00:12:02.530
Next year, I said, can I submit a talk?

182
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.030
He said, you can submit one, we'll see.

183
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.800
So I submitted a talk.

184
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.787
And they said, yeah, all right, you can
give that in this tiny little room out

185
00:12:11.787 --> 00:12:14.450
the back [LAUGH] as
long as you don't sell.

186
00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.478
So I did that for one year.

187
00:12:17.478 --> 00:12:20.633
And then the next year,
I submitted another talk.

188
00:12:20.633 --> 00:12:24.385
And because everybody had been
very nice and I hadn't sold,

189
00:12:24.385 --> 00:12:28.960
I got to stand on the main stage, and
so and so on, and it went on like that.

190
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.722
So you gotta kinda commit to
doing this over the long-term.

191
00:12:32.722 --> 00:12:38.400
You can't just swoop and poop on
the sector, beautifully worded there.
