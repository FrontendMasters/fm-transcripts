1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.177
So that will make sense, let's take a
pause for a minute just to see if there's

2
00:00:04.177 --> 00:00:07.300
any questions around any
of that before we move on.

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.600
Anything sprang to mind, no.

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.326
&gt;&gt; How fast do you, I mean, now that
you've got it all working like clockwork

5
00:00:14.326 --> 00:00:17.189
send out an email how
fast you get a response?

6
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.425
Just curious.

7
00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:24.553
&gt;&gt; In response in terms of actual work or
in terms of communication?

8
00:00:24.553 --> 00:00:25.867
&gt;&gt; You know what, is either all.

9
00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:30.380
&gt;&gt; Right, so I'll send out an email,
out today actually,

10
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.495
my emails go out every other Thursday.

11
00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:37.888
And it's within 10 minutes
I'd had three people reply

12
00:00:37.888 --> 00:00:42.960
going really great email today,
Paul, blah blah blah.

13
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.358
And I will always reply to them, okay?

14
00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:50.344
So I get instant feedback at this point
because I've spent so long on and

15
00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:52.776
nurturing-
&gt;&gt; There is something about the email,

16
00:00:52.776 --> 00:00:54.040
you have to send a message.

17
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.851
Yeah, there's content in the email.

18
00:00:55.851 --> 00:00:58.499
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll get into that.

19
00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.735
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; You said the blank email [LAUGH]

20
00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:03.285
&gt;&gt; I won't.

21
00:01:03.285 --> 00:01:05.505
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah that would be good.

22
00:01:05.505 --> 00:01:10.150
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Absolutely but
you do AB testing or like?

23
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.010
&gt;&gt; I don't actually.

24
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.234
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; No, I should do, but

25
00:01:13.234 --> 00:01:16.190
who's got the time, right?

26
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.557
This whole thing this isn't
we're not talking about building

27
00:01:21.557 --> 00:01:28.950
a kind of a multinational, segmented,
AB tested, world class sales funnel here.

28
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.150
We're talking about something
that's enough to support us.

29
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.927
In terms of turning into work that,
so one of the things that I do and

30
00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:38.500
we'll get into this all
in a lot more detail.

31
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.031
But one of the things I do is,
so I get bored easily, right,

32
00:01:43.031 --> 00:01:46.659
like I said the attention
span of a small child,

33
00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.790
which means that I don't
wanna do another UX audit.

34
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.280
I'm fed up with doing those.

35
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.350
I wanna do some prototyping.

36
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.860
So what I'll do, is I'll send two or
three emails, right?

37
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.812
So that's over, say, probably about
a six week period on various aspects of

38
00:02:02.812 --> 00:02:06.060
prototyping, and that will win me work.

39
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.630
Within maybe a month's period,
something like that.

40
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.420
So you can turn it around
relatively quickly.

41
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.660
So, a question from chatroom.

42
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.348
&gt;&gt; Do you encourage referrals, and

43
00:02:16.348 --> 00:02:22.410
do you have more clients from referrals
versus warm leads from the emails?

44
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.530
&gt;&gt; Right, good question.

45
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.347
So, I don't encourage referrals, so
you can use it for various incentives and

46
00:02:29.347 --> 00:02:32.270
I have played with this in the past.

47
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.691
So, you can sale, I'll give you
10% if you refer me as a client,

48
00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:45.220
just, I felt dirty during that,
it just didn't feel like me.

49
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.180
And it didn't work anyway.

50
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.200
So I kinda dropped doing that.

51
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.720
I've also tried doing
referrals of the email, right?

52
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.550
So in other words, if you invite
someone else to subscribe to this,

53
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.600
then you'll get whatever.

54
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.268
And I actually found a really good tool
that kinda has this whole gamification

55
00:03:07.268 --> 00:03:12.650
thing built into it tried that,
didn't work for my audience.

56
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.234
I'm not saying it doesn't
in certain situations but

57
00:03:16.234 --> 00:03:19.269
I'm kinda positioning, I'm not selling.

58
00:03:20.334 --> 00:03:21.470
No, widgets.

59
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.550
I'm not selling paper cups.

60
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.570
I'm selling a bespoke custom
high end service, right?

61
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.719
So really these kinds of gimmicks don't
really suit it particularly well, in terms

62
00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:40.534
of the balance between referral work and
new work that comes in via this method.

63
00:03:40.534 --> 00:03:45.456
I would say it swings, right?

64
00:03:45.456 --> 00:03:50.355
It's about a 6040 split but that
depending on the particular quarter or

65
00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:54.641
particular month or whatever else
it could go either way, I mean,

66
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:59.790
it could be 60 for referrals one month and
then 60 for emails the next month.

67
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.152
So I don't track it that closely
because again who's got time, right?

68
00:04:05.152 --> 00:04:08.597
I probably should do a better job of that,
but I don't.

69
00:04:08.597 --> 00:04:12.250
Any other questions or
is that it at the moment?

70
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.160
&gt;&gt; The response,
what is the response rate to these things?

71
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.770
How many emails do you need to send?

72
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.827
Did you figure it out like, okay, I need
to send 10,000 emails, or you were just

73
00:04:22.827 --> 00:04:26.270
like, I need to send out as many emails
as I can, as many people as I can, or

74
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.080
do you scale it down, okay,
now I wanna tailor her this?

75
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.706
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so-
&gt;&gt; What's the controllability that you

76
00:04:30.706 --> 00:04:31.357
were talking about?

77
00:04:31.357 --> 00:04:32.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah, got you.

78
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.014
I always send out, because I'm lazy,

79
00:04:36.014 --> 00:04:40.424
because we want something
that's manageable here,

80
00:04:40.424 --> 00:04:45.823
I send out to my entire mailing
list once every two weeks, right?

81
00:04:45.823 --> 00:04:49.005
You could get a way with
once a month I think.

82
00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:54.188
I know some of my colleagues that
have used similar to now every day

83
00:04:54.188 --> 00:04:59.859
which is just crazy they can do that,
but they it seems to work for them.

84
00:04:59.859 --> 00:05:03.896
And the guy that I've got in my head is
actually got a mailing list it's more than

85
00:05:03.896 --> 00:05:06.742
twice my size from doing that,
so I'm not knocking it.

86
00:05:06.742 --> 00:05:10.840
But I'm not committed enough to do that so

87
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.526
it's balancing you gotta
balance the amount of

88
00:05:15.526 --> 00:05:20.576
effort that goes into
sending emails out against.

89
00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:24.635
The how often the people need to
hear from you to remember you,

90
00:05:24.635 --> 00:05:26.913
because that's the aim, right?

91
00:05:26.913 --> 00:05:35.382
I do do some very basic
segmentation of my list.

92
00:05:35.382 --> 00:05:41.190
So, when people sign up,
I ask them, do you work in house?

93
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.590
Do you work for an agency or
are you freelancer?

94
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.573
That's all I ask them,

95
00:05:44.573 --> 00:05:48.180
because you don't wanna put too
many barriers in people's ways.

96
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.625
And so because I've got some services
aimed to freelancers and agencies and

97
00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:56.070
I have some services aimed
at people that are in house.

98
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.510
So I will tailor sometimes do the same.

99
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.451
You say I'm doing
a newsletter on prototyping,

100
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:06.350
I might write two slightly
different versions of it.

101
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.527
So that's about as clever as I get,
because again,

102
00:06:09.527 --> 00:06:11.490
we want this to be lightweight.

103
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.027
Anything else from the chat room?

104
00:06:18.522 --> 00:06:24.030
&gt;&gt; Do you prefer sending a bunch of emails
or would you send personalized emails?

105
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.370
&gt;&gt; I do personalize to a degree.

106
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.385
I mean, at different times, right?

107
00:06:32.385 --> 00:06:37.037
So as we go through this you'll get a much
better understanding of when I send

108
00:06:37.037 --> 00:06:41.417
a personal one to one email, because
I do do personal one to one emails.

109
00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:46.435
But with my main mailing list,
no, it's doesn't

110
00:06:46.435 --> 00:06:51.689
generally tend to be
personalized beyond your name,

111
00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:56.490
I tag people within
the particular system I use.

112
00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.460
So I learn about what they like and
what they don't.

113
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.100
And so it might get some degree
of personalization based on that.

114
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:08.054
So for example, sometimes I get
myself into situations where,

115
00:07:08.054 --> 00:07:12.733
let's say, I'm giving a workshop
on this for example, and

116
00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:17.790
then, I'm also about to release
a book on a different subject.

117
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.590
Well, I need to promote both
of them at the same time.

118
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:21.617
How am I gonna do that?

119
00:07:21.617 --> 00:07:26.586
Okay, well, basically, I know these
people are agencies and freelancers so

120
00:07:26.586 --> 00:07:31.483
they're gonna get this presentation as
the pitch in that particular email,

121
00:07:31.483 --> 00:07:34.967
and this group is going to
get you know the other thing.

122
00:07:34.967 --> 00:07:39.520
So I do that kind of basic segmentation
but nothing very complicated.

123
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.001
And the personalization, the real
personal emails I do a much earlier in

124
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:48.600
the process before they've joined
the official mailing list.

125
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.400
The only exception is I do keep an eye
on my mailing list to check for

126
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.987
as people sign up, I do pay attention
to the domain names because if somebody

127
00:07:58.987 --> 00:08:04.868
like I don't know Nike pop up in the list,
they're gonna get a personal email.

128
00:08:04.868 --> 00:08:07.794
[LAUGH] So, I do a bit of that.

129
00:08:07.794 --> 00:08:09.050
But other than that, no.

130
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.400
Yeah, no one, this is good,
God engaged audience today.

131
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.920
&gt;&gt; What are your feelings about LinkedIn?

132
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.470
Do you use it in conjunction
with the emails?

133
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:22.231
&gt;&gt; Yes, so,
we're gonna get into all of this later and

134
00:08:22.231 --> 00:08:26.140
I'll show you exactly how I use LinkedIn.

135
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.674
So I won't answer that question right now
because otherwise I'll just be repeating

136
00:08:29.674 --> 00:08:30.480
what I said later.

137
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:35.466
I think-
&gt;&gt; The other person said I assume you're

138
00:08:35.466 --> 00:08:37.463
gonna cover this later in the course but

139
00:08:37.463 --> 00:08:40.538
they're very interested in
growing the mailing list.

140
00:08:40.538 --> 00:08:42.130
&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely covering that.

141
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.740
So whole section on that.

142
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.340
Well, that's the majority of
the course [LAUGH] To be honest.
