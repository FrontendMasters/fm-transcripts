00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.846
So one of the concerns that I
hear from people whenever I talk,

2
00:00:04.846 --> 00:00:09.563
how do you do it Paul,
how do you keep coming up with content?

3
00:00:09.563 --> 00:00:13.706
You're always coming up with new things
to talk about, how do you manage it?

4
00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:16.399
I can never think about what to write.

5
00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:20.600
I totally get that, and the reason
that you're struggling is because

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.480
you're sitting down and going,
what shall I write about today, right?

7
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.568
And you know what happens if
anybody puts you on the spot, and

8
00:00:29.568 --> 00:00:34.140
say something, you blank,
you can't think of anything.

9
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.530
So you need to avoid that.

10
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.350
So really, ultimately, it's about just
building up an ongoing list of topics.

11
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.230
And a lot of that is just about you're
surrounded by ideas all the time.

12
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.159
You just need to pay attention and
write it down so

13
00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.350
that when you sit down to write an email,
you've already got ideas there.

14
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.820
So, pay attention to the conversations
you're having with clients.

15
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.570
They'll ask you questions.

16
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.900
That's an email, right?

17
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.110
You'll get stuck on a project and
frustrated on a project.

18
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.930
That's an email.

19
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.322
Keep an eye out for subjects being
discussed on the influencer sites,

20
00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:19.840
the sites that your audience
are hanging out at.

21
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.446
Those are all potential emails.

22
00:01:21.446 --> 00:01:25.456
Every question that's asked on a forum,
every search that's done

23
00:01:25.456 --> 00:01:29.971
on Google related to a particular subject,
every mention on social media.

24
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:32.683
Those are all email topics.

25
00:01:32.683 --> 00:01:35.709
Think about the work you're
doing at that particular time.

26
00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:38.793
That's all content, right?

27
00:01:38.793 --> 00:01:45.288
I've been working at the moment
on doing usability testing.

28
00:01:45.288 --> 00:01:47.691
That's a subject.

29
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:53.024
And I had a particularly bad experience
recently where I did usability testing,

30
00:01:53.024 --> 00:01:57.574
and we were benchmarking my version
against the existing version and

31
00:01:57.574 --> 00:02:01.830
my version performed worse than
the existing version, right?

32
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.395
I actually wrote an email
saying how to deal

33
00:02:07.395 --> 00:02:13.123
with [LAUGH] when your
usability test fails.

34
00:02:13.123 --> 00:02:15.663
That's a good subject.

35
00:02:15.663 --> 00:02:19.471
And people wrote to me afterwards going,
I'm so glad it's not just me.

36
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:23.000
[LAUGH] Or
I really appreciated your honesty there.

37
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.750
It's great.

38
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.830
Write about services you offer, not
directly, but write around those services.

39
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.677
Don't say this is a list of
the services I offer, but

40
00:02:33.677 --> 00:02:36.350
write about topics relating
to those services.

41
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.859
Pretty obvious really.

42
00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.764
And write about the value
of what you want to offer.

43
00:02:42.764 --> 00:02:48.525
So if you want more work,
I don't know, doing usability testing,

44
00:02:48.525 --> 00:02:53.087
then you write about the value
of usability testing.

45
00:02:53.087 --> 00:02:54.840
It's not rocket science.

46
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.910
Also pay attention to what annoys you.

47
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.460
This is really good,
cuz it will annoy other people as well.

48
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.440
So for example, I really get
annoyed by cookie notifications.

49
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.057
They are something that really
grinds my gears, logins as well,

50
00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:15.000
that's another pet subject of
mine which really irritates me.

51
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.470
So I'm always writing about these
things cuz they annoying me.

52
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.100
And then keep an eye out for
good examples, right?

53
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.427
You live in a world full of examples,

54
00:03:27.427 --> 00:03:31.590
you're interacting with it every day.

55
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.032
So me as a user experience person,
every app I use, every website I visit,

56
00:03:36.032 --> 00:03:40.380
they're all potential good
examples that I can refer to.

57
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.982
If you work in performance,
then you're gonna see good and

58
00:03:43.982 --> 00:03:47.790
bad examples of well performing or
poorly performing sites.

59
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.060
So that's all material you can draw upon.

60
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.990
And if all else fails,
research what people are Googling.

61
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.557
If you type in user experience or
performance and

62
00:03:57.557 --> 00:04:01.215
see what comes up afterwards,
then it's great.

63
00:04:01.215 --> 00:04:07.167
Well, actually if you hit return, so
you type in performance hit return,

64
00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:11.607
get the results up,
actually it's a block of questions

65
00:04:11.607 --> 00:04:16.063
related to that topic, right,
in the Google results.

66
00:04:16.063 --> 00:04:19.373
Those are all emails you can send out.

67
00:04:19.373 --> 00:04:25.360
And then if you're struggling with topics
then on any particular topic there are so

68
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.961
many different ways you
can approach that topic.

69
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:31.610
You can write reviews
of different products.

70
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.075
You can ask questions.

71
00:04:33.075 --> 00:04:33.894
You can do how tos.

72
00:04:33.894 --> 00:04:35.767
You can share industry news.

73
00:04:35.767 --> 00:04:39.369
You can talk about controversial subjects.

74
00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:41.701
You can create checklists and
cheat sheets.

75
00:04:41.701 --> 00:04:46.510
You can create case studies and so
on, and so on, and so on, and so on.

76
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.510
You really don't need to run out of ideas.

77
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.356
The trick is not starting
from a blank sheet,

78
00:04:55.356 --> 00:05:00.429
not sitting down to write
an email without existing ideas.

79
00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:06.349
And so the way that I resolve this is by
starting to keep a list of possible ideas.

80
00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.542
Now I use Notion.

81
00:05:08.542 --> 00:05:13.812
Where in Notion I have basically
ideas split out as to whether

82
00:05:13.812 --> 00:05:21.062
they're a course or an email or a webinar
or a social media update or whatever else.

83
00:05:21.062 --> 00:05:25.970
And then I jot down the title of
the subject I wanna cover and maybe a few

84
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.491
bullet points on it and just leave it at
that until it comes time to next write.

85
00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:35.110
And every time you have an idea, you just
drop it into the list along with a few

86
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.350
bullet points to help you get started
when it comes time to write it.

87
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.522
And so
once in a while I will also sit down and

88
00:05:42.522 --> 00:05:47.100
just brainstorm a load of ideas
to keep the list topped up.

89
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.571
But I don't do that at the moment
I'm gonna sit down and

90
00:05:49.571 --> 00:05:51.850
write because that's when
your mind goes blank.

91
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.712
So are there any questions around coming
up with ideas or writing emails or

92
00:05:57.712 --> 00:06:01.070
any struggles that you have
around that kind of thing?

93
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.300
Is it something you've ever tried doing?

94
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.989
&gt;&gt; Outside of selling like
to not talk about that,

95
00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:08.622
is there anything else
you would say to avoid?

96
00:06:08.622 --> 00:06:13.462
&gt;&gt; Not really ,I think a lot of
people are afraid of expressing their

97
00:06:13.462 --> 00:06:17.774
opinions because someone will
tell them they're wrong,

98
00:06:17.774 --> 00:06:21.119
which I totally understand and
totally get.

99
00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:25.301
And if that is you, I would say you
don't need to be afraid of that

100
00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:30.390
because people will tell you you're
wrong even if you say nothing, right?

101
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.739
I've received emails before saying,
why haven't you spoken out on so and

102
00:06:34.739 --> 00:06:35.644
so an issue on.

103
00:06:35.644 --> 00:06:40.300
Okay, I hadn't even said anything and
I'm in trouble.

104
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.570
So some degrees you can't win that.

105
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.654
But if you are worried,
if you're one of those people that,

106
00:06:45.654 --> 00:06:49.730
I don't wanna put my head above the
parapet because people might criticize me.

107
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.428
Then my advice is stick to talking about
your personal experience because nobody

108
00:06:54.428 --> 00:06:56.094
can say that that was wrong.

109
00:06:56.094 --> 00:06:58.971
That was what happened to
you in your situation.

110
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:03.635
Or focus on quoting other people,
so and so says, or

111
00:07:03.635 --> 00:07:07.460
I noticed this, so those kinds of things.

112
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.340
But no, I think, really, you shouldn't
be afraid to express your opinion.

113
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.861
One of the things I'm about to come onto

114
00:07:17.861 --> 00:07:23.000
is finding your own voice as you write.

115
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.221
And I think that it's okay to recognize
not everybody's gonna agree or

116
00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:31.360
like what you say, and that's all right.

117
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.630
Also you don't need everybody to like you
just need enough people to keep you in

118
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.570
business, right?

119
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.600
But yeah, that is tricky one.

120
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.070
Yeah, have got a question from chatroom?

121
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.954
&gt;&gt; Have you tried different
processes like drafting in batches?

122
00:07:45.954 --> 00:07:47.480
&gt;&gt; Yes, I have.

123
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.850
And that might work for
you, it didn't work for me.

124
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.425
The reason it didn't work for
me is because, I've said it once,

125
00:07:56.425 --> 00:08:00.200
I will say it again, I have
the attention span of a small child.

126
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:06.710
So siting and batching a whole load
of emails never really worked for me.

127
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:11.472
I'm very much a person that gets
enthusiastic in the moment about

128
00:08:11.472 --> 00:08:13.037
something, right?

129
00:08:13.037 --> 00:08:16.365
Something has particularly hit me, and so

130
00:08:16.365 --> 00:08:20.531
I wanna write an email about it there and
then, okay?

131
00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:23.677
So actually,
although I've got these backlog of ideas,

132
00:08:23.677 --> 00:08:25.742
I only use those if I really get stuck.

133
00:08:25.742 --> 00:08:27.977
Most of the time,
something's popped into my head and

134
00:08:27.977 --> 00:08:29.860
I wanna write about it straight away.

135
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.361
So doing a whole load I
would find a bit tedious.

136
00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:36.917
But there's no reason why not, and in
actual fact that's probably a good way of

137
00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:40.046
doing it, have a whole load
lined up ready to release.

138
00:08:40.046 --> 00:08:44.823
I always try and be one ahead of myself in
case I get ill or something like that, and

139
00:08:44.823 --> 00:08:47.223
so I've always got something to go out.

140
00:08:47.223 --> 00:08:50.719
But no, I don't batch that much.
