00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.105
Okay, so let's break down how
to actually write the report,

2
00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:09.528
cuz I know this is the most
intimidating part for most people,

3
00:00:09.528 --> 00:00:15.595
neither the designers I speak to or the
developers are particularly writey people.

4
00:00:15.595 --> 00:00:19.007
And as someone that's written six books,

5
00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:24.614
I can make it sounds really easy,
but I know it's not for many people.

6
00:00:24.614 --> 00:00:27.343
So let's just really run
through how I write and and

7
00:00:27.343 --> 00:00:31.089
how you stop yourself getting into that,
it's not good enough or

8
00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.990
I'm gonna have to start again, no, and
going around around in circles, right?

9
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.008
You got to be really regimented,
cuz we don't wanna waste time on this.

10
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:43.768
We're busy people, we wanna be earning
money, we do wanna be marketing.

11
00:00:43.768 --> 00:00:48.323
So you stick with this, and
this approach to writing applies with your

12
00:00:48.323 --> 00:00:52.425
writing a report, an email,
a blog post, anything, right?

13
00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:56.482
First, you create an outline, okay?

14
00:00:56.482 --> 00:01:01.345
So in the case of our report,
we're gonna divide our report

15
00:01:01.345 --> 00:01:05.623
into six to eight topics
relating to a problem area or

16
00:01:05.623 --> 00:01:09.610
trend that we have observed
through the survey or

17
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.035
if we did the review, right, the audit.

18
00:01:13.035 --> 00:01:19.580
So, and then what you wanna do is think of
each section as a short blog post, okay?

19
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.266
It makes it suddenly
a lot more manageable,

20
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:27.144
you're writing six to eight short blog
posts, not one massive report, okay?

21
00:01:30.353 --> 00:01:33.993
So at the beginning,
before all of those six to eight topics,

22
00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:36.583
we're gonna introduce a summary section,

23
00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:41.287
which is gonna outline the topics that
are gonna be covered in the key findings.

24
00:01:41.287 --> 00:01:46.854
You're gonna write that last, okay?

25
00:01:46.854 --> 00:01:51.650
We're gonna add a before our topics
a short section on the methodology

26
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.768
that we used, where we're gonna talk
about the survey, the site audits,

27
00:01:56.768 --> 00:02:00.849
the interviews,
if you carried out any interviews, etc.

28
00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:05.998
And then we're gonna end the whole thing
with the benefits of signing up for

29
00:02:05.998 --> 00:02:11.242
ongoing advice, and that will become
more obvious as to what that is later.

30
00:02:11.242 --> 00:02:14.815
So, then you're going to
write the initial draft.

31
00:02:14.815 --> 00:02:20.849
This is the bit, you're gonna write it one
section at a time over many days, right?

32
00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.765
Don't sit down in one go,
yeah, you'll go nuts.

33
00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:29.240
Write one topic of all six to
eight topics a day, maybe,

34
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.679
or a week for all I care,
but spread it out.

35
00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:37.416
And then this is the most important
piece of advice that I can give

36
00:02:37.416 --> 00:02:40.059
about writing your initial draft.

37
00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.499
Write drunk, edit sober, right?

38
00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:46.290
This is Ernest Hemingway that said this,
and

39
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.079
I am not suggesting that you
will become alcoholics, but

40
00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.092
what I am suggesting is that
the thought behind it is right.

41
00:02:56.092 --> 00:03:00.570
When you first write,
write with gay abandon, right?

42
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.549
Write as if no one's reading,
write as if it doesn't matter, okay?

43
00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.243
Write as if you were drunk.

44
00:03:08.243 --> 00:03:11.389
Because you can pass back through it and
tidy up later.

45
00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:15.522
The biggest mistake people make when
trying to write things like this is they

46
00:03:15.522 --> 00:03:19.008
agonize over every word, they try and
edit as they go along, and

47
00:03:19.008 --> 00:03:20.317
it just doesn't work.

48
00:03:20.317 --> 00:03:23.789
Just write as if you were
talking to a friend, okay?

49
00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:28.265
I've just finished a massive report and
I got to the end of it,

50
00:03:28.265 --> 00:03:30.418
right, in the first draft and

51
00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:35.430
I thought that is a pile of steaming
manure, it felt awful, rqight?

52
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.190
But when I went back through it,

53
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.851
I found out it was nowhere near as
bad as I thought it was, you know?

54
00:03:40.851 --> 00:03:45.368
So for each section, right,
aim for between 500 and

55
00:03:45.368 --> 00:03:50.381
800 words for a short blog post for
each of our topic areas.

56
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:56.537
Outline any findings that you
found from the survey and audit.

57
00:03:56.537 --> 00:03:57.933
Use your survey results so

58
00:03:57.933 --> 00:04:01.686
you can actually reference some
figures from the survey if relevant.

59
00:04:01.686 --> 00:04:06.526
Show some examples from your audit that
backup whatever it is that you found.

60
00:04:06.526 --> 00:04:10.396
Quote anybody who's spoken
about that thing, right,

61
00:04:10.396 --> 00:04:13.699
that happen to mention
whatever that topic is.

62
00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:16.954
And make some basic recommendations
based on best practice.

63
00:04:16.954 --> 00:04:19.295
That's it, right?

64
00:04:19.295 --> 00:04:23.278
That is all you need to do for
each of those topic areas.

65
00:04:23.278 --> 00:04:27.602
So most of it is just regurgitating
what was in the survey or

66
00:04:27.602 --> 00:04:30.261
what other people have said to you.

67
00:04:30.261 --> 00:04:33.492
Then once you've done that,
then once you've written all of those,

68
00:04:33.492 --> 00:04:36.585
you've done the initial draft,
then we're gonna do one, what?

69
00:04:36.585 --> 00:04:42.234
No, we're gonna do two
pass-throughs to edit it, right?

70
00:04:42.234 --> 00:04:49.445
Pass-through number one is we are going
to take it through Grammarly, okay?

71
00:04:49.445 --> 00:04:52.980
I don't know whether you own Grammarly,
if you don't own Grammarly, get Grammarly,

72
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.106
it's amazing,
it will do all the thinking for you.

73
00:04:55.106 --> 00:04:57.498
You won't need to worry about typos,

74
00:04:57.498 --> 00:05:02.452
you won't need to worry about bad grammar,
it'll fix it all for you, right?

75
00:05:02.452 --> 00:05:03.751
Absolutely invaluable, right?

76
00:05:03.751 --> 00:05:07.772
So you take your drunk copy and
run it through Grammarly and

77
00:05:07.772 --> 00:05:11.314
it'll identify all of those
kinda things for you.

78
00:05:11.314 --> 00:05:16.586
Then what you're gonna do is read it back,
okay?

79
00:05:16.586 --> 00:05:23.984
Now, the way I read it back is I get
the computer to read it back to me.

80
00:05:23.984 --> 00:05:31.103
Because a computer will read what's there,
not what I think I wrote, [LAUGH] right?

81
00:05:31.103 --> 00:05:35.130
So get it to read it back to it and
listen to it once.

82
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.720
So that's what you do,
Grammarly, read it back.

83
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.588
Now the third step is by
far the most important,

84
00:05:42.588 --> 00:05:46.491
stop, don't read through it again.

85
00:05:46.491 --> 00:05:49.740
Don't agonize over it again,
walk away from it.

86
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.088
Even if you think it's shit,
even if you think it's a failure,

87
00:05:54.088 --> 00:05:56.432
I don't care, it's ready to go.

88
00:05:56.432 --> 00:06:01.021
Cuz the truth is, you don't have
the time to go over it again, and

89
00:06:01.021 --> 00:06:03.036
again, and again, right?

90
00:06:03.036 --> 00:06:06.602
And if you get into that mindset
of picking over everything

91
00:06:06.602 --> 00:06:11.476
that you have done, then you will never
do any marketing, you'll never blog,

92
00:06:11.476 --> 00:06:15.953
you'll never do anything because
it'll never be good enough, right?

93
00:06:15.953 --> 00:06:18.403
So you have to stick to that.

94
00:06:18.403 --> 00:06:22.534
Then you can design it up, make it look
pretty, make sure it's easy to scan by

95
00:06:22.534 --> 00:06:26.107
adding images, pull out quotes,
bullets, that kinds of stuff.

96
00:06:26.107 --> 00:06:31.057
If you're not a designer, you might
wanna consider using fiverr.com to find

97
00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:34.140
yourself a designer just
to make it look pretty.

98
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.007
It's not gonna cost you very much
because as we've already said,

99
00:06:38.007 --> 00:06:39.675
there are worksheet there.

100
00:06:39.675 --> 00:06:42.678
Don't forget to end your report
with a strong call to action,

101
00:06:42.678 --> 00:06:44.659
which is to sign up to your mailing list.

102
00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:48.110
And we'll come on to why that's
got to be in there later.

103
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.815
And that's it, so that's how you're
gonna get your audience's attention.

104
00:06:52.815 --> 00:06:55.834
You've got all the assets, you've got
all the emails, you're ready to go,

105
00:06:55.834 --> 00:06:56.945
let's just briefly recap.

106
00:06:56.945 --> 00:07:00.940
Make contact to ask for
some initial feedback and thoughts,

107
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.695
that's your initial get on their radar.

108
00:07:03.695 --> 00:07:07.679
Then you're gonna prepare the survey and
associated landing page.

109
00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:10.399
Then you're going to ask people
to complete the survey and

110
00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:11.851
that's your second contact.

111
00:07:11.851 --> 00:07:15.199
You're gonna review some sites,
you're gonna create some scorecards,

112
00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:19.038
you're gonna carry out some interviews,
if anybody's willing to be interviewed.

113
00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:24.907
Then you're gonna write your final report
and you all done on the hard work.
