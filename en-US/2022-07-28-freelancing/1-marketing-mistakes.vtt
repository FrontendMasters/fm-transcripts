1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.435
Let's first of all say to ourselves,

2
00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:05.640
what is it that we really
want from our marketing?

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.284
What are we trying to actually achieve,
okay?

4
00:00:09.284 --> 00:00:14.385
In an ideal world,
how would we use kind of our outreach to

5
00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:19.715
the rest of the world to benefit
us in our business, right?

6
00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:24.053
So I think there's basically
three things that an agency or

7
00:00:24.053 --> 00:00:28.750
a freelancer wants depending on
where they are in their career.

8
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.419
Sometimes it's just,
I need more, [LAUGH] right?

9
00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.833
Any kind of work would be good right now,
so I just need something.

10
00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:40.915
I need to know that I'm gonna be
able to feed my kids next month.

11
00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:45.751
It can get that bad sometimes,
and it's a tough situation.

12
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:50.632
Other times, we're in a bit more of a
comfortable state where we've got enough,

13
00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:53.618
but what we're getting
isn't really very good.

14
00:00:53.618 --> 00:00:56.113
It's not the kind of
work we wanna be doing.

15
00:00:56.113 --> 00:01:00.158
So a big part of my job these
days is actually mentoring and

16
00:01:00.158 --> 00:01:03.036
supporting agencies and freelancers.

17
00:01:03.036 --> 00:01:07.357
And one of the things I often find is that
a lot of people are scrambling around at

18
00:01:07.357 --> 00:01:10.976
the bottom of the market,
which is very, very price sensitive.

19
00:01:10.976 --> 00:01:15.216
So they're working on tiny little
websites when they're massively

20
00:01:15.216 --> 00:01:16.905
overqualified to do them.

21
00:01:16.905 --> 00:01:22.169
And they could be charging a lot more
than they are, except the stuff that

22
00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:27.885
comes through the door is very price
sensitive, so they need better clients.

23
00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:32.200
But better clients isn't necessarily
just those that aren't so

24
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.613
price sensitive, better might be if I have
to design one more insurance website,

25
00:01:37.613 --> 00:01:41.787
please, can I work on something
a little bit cooler than that.

26
00:01:41.787 --> 00:01:44.216
I wanna work with record labels,

27
00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:48.131
or whatever it is that you
happen to want to work with.

28
00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:53.576
Or if you are a more worthy person than
maybe I am, perhaps you wanna work for

29
00:01:53.576 --> 00:01:58.342
charities, or sustainable organizations,
or whatever it be.

30
00:01:58.342 --> 00:02:00.207
So better is another one.

31
00:02:00.207 --> 00:02:02.751
And then the final one is easier, right?

32
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:08.574
The vast amount of time and energy
that can go into winning work is huge,

33
00:02:08.574 --> 00:02:14.805
right, especially if you get yourself
into the world of pitching, right?

34
00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:19.209
Where you have to basically apply
to win the piece of work and

35
00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.861
you produce these long proposals.

36
00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:25.499
And if you're particularly a green and
all of this,

37
00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:30.309
you might even get convinced you
have to do speculative design work.

38
00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:34.588
And you really get kind of sucked into
doing an enormous amount of work and

39
00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:36.002
then you don't win it.

40
00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:40.630
And it's like, wow, that was hard work for
not very much in return.

41
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:47.330
And then, of course, the other thing
is even doing marketing stuff.

42
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.587
I'm sure you've seen online all
the things you're supposed to do.

43
00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:55.020
You're supposed to be blogging, and you're
supposed to be doing social media updates,

44
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.401
and you're supposed to be doing this,
and that, and the other, and

45
00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:00.288
all of these things take a lot of time.

46
00:03:00.288 --> 00:03:06.237
And if you're a freelancer or a small
agency, you don't have that time, right?

47
00:03:06.237 --> 00:03:11.214
Every minute that you're doing that
kind of stuff, you're not working on

48
00:03:11.214 --> 00:03:15.955
chargeable work, which means that
you're not earning money, okay?

49
00:03:15.955 --> 00:03:20.360
So we kind of gotta come up with
a way of minimizing the amount of

50
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.988
effort that goes into winning work,

51
00:03:22.988 --> 00:03:28.363
from getting people's attention all
the way through to closing the deal.

52
00:03:28.363 --> 00:03:30.856
So that's kind of our aims, right?

53
00:03:30.856 --> 00:03:33.652
That's the utopia that we're aiming for.

54
00:03:33.652 --> 00:03:39.532
And it isn't actually utopia,
all of those things that are achievable.

55
00:03:39.532 --> 00:03:43.648
It takes time, but you can get there.

56
00:03:43.648 --> 00:03:47.181
So let's look at some
of the common mistakes,

57
00:03:47.181 --> 00:03:51.810
right, that I see freelancers and
agencies making, okay?

58
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.552
And because there are kind of four that
I keep coming across time and again.

59
00:03:57.552 --> 00:04:02.819
The first is that people rely much too
heavily on word of mouth recommendation,

60
00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:03.377
right?

61
00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:06.124
We're gonna dive into these a little
bit more detail in a minute.

62
00:04:06.124 --> 00:04:11.640
Secondly, we waste a lot of
money on advertising, right?

63
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.320
So freelancers might do things
like take pay per click ads, or

64
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.540
Facebook ads, or get convinced that
they should buy a newspaper ad,

65
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.332
or to take part in some conference,
or whatever.

66
00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:30.374
There are all these people trying to
extract money from us in return for

67
00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:32.693
supposedly leads and clients.

68
00:04:32.693 --> 00:04:38.927
And then another common mistake is getting
work through online marketplaces, or

69
00:04:38.927 --> 00:04:44.996
if you just go to, sign up to fiverr.com
or guru.com, you can win work there.

70
00:04:44.996 --> 00:04:50.172
You can, but it's not the best work,
but we'll come on to that in a minute.

71
00:04:50.172 --> 00:04:55.534
And then finally, is approaching content
marketing in entirely the wrong way right?

72
00:04:55.534 --> 00:04:59.386
Content marketing is supposed to be
the answer to everything, right?

73
00:04:59.386 --> 00:05:02.001
That's how you win work and
build your reputations.

74
00:05:02.001 --> 00:05:07.902
And it's like yes and no,
it very much depends on how you use it.

75
00:05:07.902 --> 00:05:11.048
So let's dive into those
a little bit more details so

76
00:05:11.048 --> 00:05:14.991
you can kind of understand where
the problems come from, right?

77
00:05:14.991 --> 00:05:20.543
Word of mouth recommendations,
this just drives me nuts, right?

78
00:05:20.543 --> 00:05:25.406
Every now and again,
it often happens with well established

79
00:05:25.406 --> 00:05:29.326
people that have been in the industry for
years.

80
00:05:29.326 --> 00:05:32.927
They make comments on social media like,
yes,

81
00:05:32.927 --> 00:05:37.830
we don't advertise or marketing,
our work speaks for ourselves.

82
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.561
And people come to us because

83
00:05:42.561 --> 00:05:47.299
[SOUND] it's so kind of yeah.

84
00:05:47.299 --> 00:05:49.752
Now, don't get me wrong, right?

85
00:05:49.752 --> 00:05:54.816
Word of mouth for recommendation
is really, really important, okay?

86
00:05:54.816 --> 00:05:57.909
A lot of my work comes
through word of mouth, okay?

87
00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:02.189
And the longer you work,
the more clients you have,

88
00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:08.522
the easier the work comes because you
get more word of mouth recommendation.

89
00:06:08.522 --> 00:06:12.317
But there are some fundamental
problems with it and

90
00:06:12.317 --> 00:06:16.818
I don't think we should be in
all good conscious encouraging

91
00:06:16.818 --> 00:06:21.245
anybody to rely entirely on
word of mouth recommendation.

92
00:06:21.245 --> 00:06:22.285
And in my opinion,

93
00:06:22.285 --> 00:06:25.925
there's kinda three problems that
we've got with word of mouth.

94
00:06:25.925 --> 00:06:28.712
Number one is that is passive, right?

95
00:06:28.712 --> 00:06:30.793
So if the phone stops ringing,

96
00:06:30.793 --> 00:06:35.195
right, if you have a month where
nothing comes through the door,

97
00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:40.259
what you gonna do about it if you only
rely on word of mouth recommendation?

98
00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:43.165
Are you're gonna nag your
clients to recommend you?

99
00:06:43.165 --> 00:06:45.423
Yeah, that'll go down well.

100
00:06:45.423 --> 00:06:47.906
You've got no action that you can take.

101
00:06:47.906 --> 00:06:52.998
So in that sense,
it's really weak because you do,

102
00:06:52.998 --> 00:06:57.638
every your company goes
through slow patches.

103
00:06:57.638 --> 00:07:01.125
And you could put your feet up and
have a holiday, but

104
00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:04.622
that's not always particularly sensible or
good.

105
00:07:04.622 --> 00:07:06.770
Second is it's limiting.

106
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.093
The problem with word of mouth
recommendation is it typically happens

107
00:07:11.093 --> 00:07:15.793
within a particular sector or amongst
companies of a certain size, right?

108
00:07:15.793 --> 00:07:20.581
So somebody running the chip shop,
sorry that's a really

109
00:07:20.581 --> 00:07:25.088
British choice of restaurant there,
the old chippy.

110
00:07:25.088 --> 00:07:29.921
Yeah, the person that runs
the chippy on the corner doesn't

111
00:07:29.921 --> 00:07:34.108
know the CEO of Coca-Cola,
that doesn't happen.

112
00:07:34.108 --> 00:07:38.276
So what that means is that it's quite
limiting that you're not getting,

113
00:07:38.276 --> 00:07:41.773
if you wanna work with a different
sector or you weren't wanna

114
00:07:41.773 --> 00:07:45.961
work with bigger clients, then word
of mouth isn't gonna get you there.

115
00:07:45.961 --> 00:07:49.603
And then the third
problem is pretty risky.

116
00:07:49.603 --> 00:07:54.343
Word of mouth recommendation
can't work for you.

117
00:07:54.343 --> 00:07:57.516
However, it has this
interesting effect and

118
00:07:57.516 --> 00:08:01.284
it's something that I have
to deal with all the time.

119
00:08:01.284 --> 00:08:06.609
Because I get a lot of word of mouth and
I'm actually in it right now as we speak.

120
00:08:06.609 --> 00:08:11.393
So I won a piece of work
within an insurance company in

121
00:08:11.393 --> 00:08:15.431
the UK called LV, right, and it was great.

122
00:08:15.431 --> 00:08:19.796
And I had a really good project with them
and the guy that I worked with really

123
00:08:19.796 --> 00:08:24.448
liked my work, and he recommended me to
their sister company which is Petplan.

124
00:08:24.448 --> 00:08:28.026
And then I did a lot of work for
Petplan, this is going great.

125
00:08:28.026 --> 00:08:33.180
And then for Petplan, I think somebody,
whether it was LV or Petplan recommended

126
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:38.430
me to another subsidiary of this parent
company, and now I'm doing work for them.

127
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:43.629
And then the parent company took interest
and now I'm doing work for them.

128
00:08:43.629 --> 00:08:45.534
And before you know it,

129
00:08:45.534 --> 00:08:50.211
a lot of my business is all
coming from this single client.

130
00:08:50.211 --> 00:08:53.229
And then they turn around and say,

131
00:08:53.229 --> 00:08:58.533
we've got new contracts we need you
to sign, that require you to have

132
00:08:58.533 --> 00:09:03.939
certain liability insurance that is
way out of my ability to provide.

133
00:09:03.939 --> 00:09:07.255
So all that work might go away overnight.

134
00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:12.259
That's a dangerous position to
get into on a business, right?

135
00:09:12.259 --> 00:09:15.906
So, word of mouth can be risky.

136
00:09:15.906 --> 00:09:20.279
So yeah, what I guess I'm saying is
it's not the kind of answer that

137
00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:22.438
everybody thinks it is, right?

138
00:09:22.438 --> 00:09:25.906
Let's move on from that and
look at both really online ads and

139
00:09:25.906 --> 00:09:29.585
the marketplaces because they
face similar problems, right?

140
00:09:29.585 --> 00:09:33.413
Online ads and
marketplaces like Upwork, or Fiverr, or

141
00:09:33.413 --> 00:09:38.530
whatever it is that you want to mention,
they're great, as far as they go.

142
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:42.604
And online ads fall into
this category as well, but

143
00:09:42.604 --> 00:09:49.065
they they tend to attract smaller clients
that are primarily price orientated.

144
00:09:49.065 --> 00:09:54.440
So if you think about it,
if you're, I don't know,

145
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.859
the marketing manager for Target, right,

146
00:09:58.859 --> 00:10:05.084
you don't go on to fiverr.com
to find somebody to work with.

147
00:10:05.084 --> 00:10:10.550
Equally, you don't just Google web
design agencies, or data scientists,

148
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:14.765
or whatever else, look down the ads and
go that one will do.

149
00:10:14.765 --> 00:10:18.298
It doesn't happen like that, does it?

150
00:10:18.298 --> 00:10:23.044
So what happens is it's, again,
you're a local chippy that uses

151
00:10:23.044 --> 00:10:27.047
those kinds of places,
your local restaurants, etc.

152
00:10:27.047 --> 00:10:29.801
And to be honest, even the kind of big,

153
00:10:29.801 --> 00:10:34.143
the grown up version of that,
of Fiverr and things like that,

154
00:10:34.143 --> 00:10:40.095
our procurement platforms where the larger
companies post their larger projects.

155
00:10:40.095 --> 00:10:45.258
Even those actually are rarely
worth your time because there's

156
00:10:45.258 --> 00:10:51.964
a naughty thing that happens, the dark
secret that nobody actually says out loud.

157
00:10:51.964 --> 00:10:57.575
Which is that most of those jobs been
posted on these procurement platforms,

158
00:10:57.575 --> 00:11:01.978
the company already has
the supplier they want, right, but

159
00:11:01.978 --> 00:11:07.441
they're required by their procurement
department to get three tenders.

160
00:11:07.441 --> 00:11:10.547
So you go through all of
this process of pitching for

161
00:11:10.547 --> 00:11:15.112
this work only to discover you're not
the one they wanted anyway, right?

162
00:11:15.112 --> 00:11:18.534
So it's a big roll of
the dice when you do that.

163
00:11:18.534 --> 00:11:22.728
But with all of this, whether you're
talking about procurement platforms,

164
00:11:22.728 --> 00:11:25.395
places like Upwork, or
online ads, basically,

165
00:11:25.395 --> 00:11:28.590
what it boils down to is
there's no relationship, right?

166
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:33.770
You're just another supplier,
they haven't gone, I wanna work with you,

167
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:39.120
they've gone, I wanna work with a data
scientist, you'll do, [LAUGH] right?

168
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.117
That's a huge difference, you see.

169
00:11:43.117 --> 00:11:47.737
So, we want clients that
approach us because we want

170
00:11:47.737 --> 00:11:52.578
people that specifically
wanna work with us, right?

171
00:11:52.578 --> 00:11:55.887
People that come to me wanna work with me,

172
00:11:55.887 --> 00:12:00.429
to the point where I was talking
to somebody yesterday and

173
00:12:00.429 --> 00:12:04.119
it's like I almost have
another problem now,

174
00:12:04.119 --> 00:12:08.968
which is they get over enthusiastic
about working with you.

175
00:12:08.968 --> 00:12:12.589
And they start making all these promises,
yeah, we'll definitely do this, and

176
00:12:12.589 --> 00:12:14.639
we'll do that, and
whatever it takes, Paul.

177
00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:16.645
And then they have to come back and go,

178
00:12:16.645 --> 00:12:19.669
my manager says that we need
to talk about this properly.

179
00:12:19.669 --> 00:12:24.274
[LAUGH] And that they got carried away,
but I'd prefer it that way round,

180
00:12:24.274 --> 00:12:25.947
that's better problem.

181
00:12:25.947 --> 00:12:29.732
So yeah, that's wasting money
on online ads and marketplaces.

182
00:12:29.732 --> 00:12:31.111
Then there's content marketing.

183
00:12:31.111 --> 00:12:33.301
Now content marketing can work.

184
00:12:33.301 --> 00:12:37.962
And I wanna emphasize this because
my entire career has been built

185
00:12:37.962 --> 00:12:39.665
on content marketing.

186
00:12:39.665 --> 00:12:42.883
I was the first guy to ever
do a web design podcast,

187
00:12:42.883 --> 00:12:45.730
there was no web design
podcasts before me.

188
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:50.406
I started blogging in 2005
before blogging was trendy,

189
00:12:50.406 --> 00:12:53.626
before content marketing was the thing.

190
00:12:53.626 --> 00:12:57.295
I was one of the first people in
the first 1,000 people on Twitter.

191
00:12:57.295 --> 00:13:01.480
I've always done very
well out that cuts stuff,

192
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.369
more by luck than judgment,
I hasten to say.

193
00:13:05.369 --> 00:13:11.426
But content marketing, although it's great
for establishing your credibility and

194
00:13:11.426 --> 00:13:16.473
increasing your reach, it does come
with some significant challenges

195
00:13:16.473 --> 00:13:21.791
that everybody kinda skirts over when
they talk about content marketing.

196
00:13:21.791 --> 00:13:26.704
So, let's just be clear what they
are because that's gonna affect

197
00:13:26.704 --> 00:13:28.868
what I recommend we do later.

198
00:13:28.868 --> 00:13:34.529
So some of the biggest issues with content
marketing is too much noise now, right?

199
00:13:34.529 --> 00:13:39.863
When I started my web design podcast,
I was getting half

200
00:13:39.863 --> 00:13:46.683
a million people listening to every
episode, half a million, right?

201
00:13:46.683 --> 00:13:52.011
Now, when I stopped podcasting,
it was down to a few thousand,

202
00:13:52.011 --> 00:13:57.160
because when I started there was
no choice, I had a monopoly.

203
00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.326
[LAUGH] These days there's so
many podcasts and so

204
00:14:02.326 --> 00:14:10.014
many things asked after our attention
that it just you lost in the noise.

205
00:14:10.014 --> 00:14:13.337
The other big problem is because of
that level of noise, you're gone and

206
00:14:13.337 --> 00:14:14.163
then forgotten.

207
00:14:14.163 --> 00:14:15.393
So what do I mean by that?

208
00:14:15.393 --> 00:14:20.561
Let's say you wrote the best, or don't
worry, let's say you gave away something.

209
00:14:20.561 --> 00:14:26.081
Let's say you gave away
an amazing piece of technology,

210
00:14:26.081 --> 00:14:30.574
or advice, or an app,
or anything like that.

211
00:14:30.574 --> 00:14:34.606
Maybe you go viral even,
that's the dream isn't it to go viral.

212
00:14:34.606 --> 00:14:39.673
Everybody downloads your app or reads your
whatever, and then they look at it and

213
00:14:39.673 --> 00:14:44.905
they go, yeah, that's great, when I need
to hire someone, I'm gonna go to you.

214
00:14:44.905 --> 00:14:50.919
And then a week later,
they forgotten you, right?

215
00:14:50.919 --> 00:14:54.189
They're on to the next new shiny thing.

216
00:14:54.189 --> 00:15:00.476
So even if you succeed in content
marketing, you don't necessarily succeed.

217
00:15:00.476 --> 00:15:04.608
It doesn't actually translate
into sales a lot of the time and

218
00:15:04.608 --> 00:15:07.003
it's incredibly time consuming.

219
00:15:07.003 --> 00:15:10.703
Yes, you have to put out multiple
social media updates every day.

220
00:15:10.703 --> 00:15:15.094
You have to put a blog out once a week,
and don't forget to do your podcast,

221
00:15:15.094 --> 00:15:17.200
and we've got time for all of that.
