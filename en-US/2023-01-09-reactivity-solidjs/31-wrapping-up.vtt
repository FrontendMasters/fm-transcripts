00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.057
I'm just gonna honestly
congratulate you all for

2
00:00:03.057 --> 00:00:05.322
making it all the way through today.

3
00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:09.713
We covered a lot of stuff, we have
all the resources you need to kind of

4
00:00:09.713 --> 00:00:14.593
backtrack and look at all the examples
we did on the site and then the GitHub.

5
00:00:14.593 --> 00:00:17.516
But I wanted to put a few more out there,

6
00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:20.716
in case you want to
learn more about Solid.

7
00:00:20.716 --> 00:00:25.126
We have our website, which we were
using today for the tutorials,

8
00:00:25.126 --> 00:00:29.771
but we also have a beta doc site,
which is still working progress, but

9
00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:33.821
it has much better guides for
beginners, we go into detail.

10
00:00:33.821 --> 00:00:37.995
Let you configure like what framework
you're coming from, if you are TypeScript,

11
00:00:37.995 --> 00:00:41.405
JavaScript, and make a more
personalized feel for learning Solid,

12
00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:42.780
which is really powerful.

13
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.069
It's still a work in progress but

14
00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:48.925
it's gonna be the best way to
learn Solid in the future.

15
00:00:48.925 --> 00:00:51.457
SolidStart also has its own docs site,

16
00:00:51.457 --> 00:00:55.227
where you can learn all about
the features of SolidStart.

17
00:00:55.227 --> 00:01:00.290
If you've used React-use or View-use,
we have something called Solid primitives.

18
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.119
And Solid-primitives is community managed,

19
00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.806
it has a whole number of packages in here,
for different,

20
00:01:08.806 --> 00:01:14.643
what app development audio bounce
clipboard, all the kind of utility,

21
00:01:14.643 --> 00:01:20.119
local storage, kind of stuff that
you'd want to use in a solid app.

22
00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.276
The Solid website also has links
to more resources and articles.

23
00:01:26.276 --> 00:01:29.878
There's over 200 ecosystem libraries,

24
00:01:29.878 --> 00:01:34.898
everything from MUI to OPUI,
which is like our chakra UI port,

25
00:01:34.898 --> 00:01:39.845
all 10 are Lindsay's projects solid query,
solid table.

26
00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:44.440
And a link to whole bunch of resources,
articles and videos.

27
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.104
And finally,
I put a couple of my own links in here.

28
00:01:48.104 --> 00:01:53.924
I have about 80 to 100 articles on Dev2,
that I've written about various topics,

29
00:01:53.924 --> 00:01:58.053
about front-ends, and
a stream every Friday, pretty much.

30
00:01:58.053 --> 00:02:00.333
So hopefully you've
learned something today,

31
00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:01.952
I had a lot of fun teaching you all.

32
00:02:01.952 --> 00:02:03.178
Thank you for coming.

33
00:02:03.178 --> 00:02:09.297
