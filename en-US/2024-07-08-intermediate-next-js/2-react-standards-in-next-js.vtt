00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.158
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I wanted
to talk about react and

2
00:00:02.158 --> 00:00:05.400
how it plays into some of
the new things in next.js.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.977
I don't wanna go too deep because,
a lot of it is probably gonna be covered,

4
00:00:09.977 --> 00:00:14.769
and some of the newer react courses that
are gonna be taught by other instructors

5
00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.561
like Brian Holt, but there's a lot of
crossover between what react is doing and

6
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:22.967
how next.js takes that and
puts their own spin on it.

7
00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:25.697
I just want you all to know
what is actually react and

8
00:00:25.697 --> 00:00:27.257
what is actually next.js.

9
00:00:27.257 --> 00:00:30.710
So, this is something I'll be talking
about throughout the entire course, but

10
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.507
this is just the preamble.

11
00:00:32.507 --> 00:00:37.364
So things like server components, you've
probably heard of that first on next.js in

12
00:00:37.364 --> 00:00:41.753
the app directory, but server components
is not something that was created by

13
00:00:41.753 --> 00:00:44.165
next.js, it's actually part of react.

14
00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:51.295
It's a React thing, it is now included
in React 18 react 19 But it's there.

15
00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:54.544
Next.js just took a gamble and
decided to implement it early on,

16
00:00:54.544 --> 00:00:57.509
cuz they knew that they have
close ties with the React team.

17
00:00:57.509 --> 00:01:00.431
They knew that that was going to be
finalized, so they went ahead and

18
00:01:00.431 --> 00:01:01.365
adopted it early on.

19
00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:05.044
And incorporated into the framework, which
is where I think a lot of the heat that

20
00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:08.848
they got for the app directory when it
first came out, people were, what's this?

21
00:01:08.848 --> 00:01:12.698
This is kinda crazy, but it took until
React, the React team was like, no, yeah,

22
00:01:12.698 --> 00:01:15.358
we're doing server components,
that's a thing.

23
00:01:15.358 --> 00:01:18.094
Then now that's a standard, and then now
it's okay, next year has to make sense

24
00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:20.079
'cause it's such an easier
way to do server components.

25
00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.329
Components, just like when there was
static or server side rendering.

26
00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.235
Yeah, you can do service side
rendering and react, but

27
00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:29.169
like who wants to make that framework?

28
00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:31.449
I don't, so next day,
I subtract that away for you.

29
00:01:31.449 --> 00:01:34.949
So it's kinda the same concept, but
again, they didn't create server.

30
00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:38.655
They didn't create server side rendering,
they didn't create server components.

31
00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:43.248
They just give you a bunch
of opinions around it.

32
00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:46.342
And that the same thing is true for
client components.

33
00:01:46.342 --> 00:01:47.612
They didn't create that as well.

34
00:01:47.612 --> 00:01:51.396
That directive where it says use server,
use client,

35
00:01:51.396 --> 00:01:55.191
that is a React thing.,
that is not a next.js thing.

36
00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:56.823
I know they got a lot of heat for that,

37
00:01:56.823 --> 00:01:58.900
why do you got to put this
at the top of the file?

38
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.747
He didn't come up with that,
that's what with the reacting when.

39
00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:06.107
Streaming a suspense, this was actually
introduced in earlier react versions, but

40
00:02:06.107 --> 00:02:09.326
like, suspense, man,
that's been a dream since 2015.

41
00:02:09.326 --> 00:02:14.214
I remember they started talking about
that and like it's now fully realized,

42
00:02:14.214 --> 00:02:18.434
in my opinion, in such a way that
you don't have to think about it and

43
00:02:18.434 --> 00:02:20.675
you'll see how we incorporate it.

44
00:02:20.675 --> 00:02:25.058
But this basically is also
something created by React,

45
00:02:25.058 --> 00:02:30.372
being able to show some type of
component while your UI is waiting for

46
00:02:30.372 --> 00:02:34.611
some data to load and
then have a fallback there.

47
00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:38.464
That's something that the React team
created, next.js didn't create that.

48
00:02:38.464 --> 00:02:42.172
They just have a bunch of opinions around
it like everything else, and they make it,

49
00:02:42.172 --> 00:02:43.903
in my opinion, super simple.

50
00:02:43.903 --> 00:02:48.444
Streaming, also, that is something
not actually created by React, but

51
00:02:48.444 --> 00:02:50.213
was made possible by React.

52
00:02:50.213 --> 00:02:54.068
Just the nature of being able to
render components on the server, but

53
00:02:54.068 --> 00:02:57.658
basically just being able to stream
down chunks of a UI at a time,

54
00:02:57.658 --> 00:03:02.532
without having to block a whole page, it's
not something that is unique to Next.js.

55
00:03:02.532 --> 00:03:05.068
It's just React has made it possible, and

56
00:03:05.068 --> 00:03:07.890
then they built
an implementation on top of it.

57
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.986
So, but we will be talking
about some of that stuff.

58
00:03:10.986 --> 00:03:14.200
The cache function,
that's actually something new to React 18.

59
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.845
I think it was maybe in beta in React 18,
React 19 is definitely there,

60
00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:23.519
but this is like a per record quest
minimalization of server side actions.

61
00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.362
We're gonna dive into this a lot if you're
like, what is this guy talking about?

62
00:03:26.362 --> 00:03:30.132
But no reason I bring this up because I
was looking all right at the other day and

63
00:03:30.132 --> 00:03:33.417
there was so much hate for
this [LAUGH] On the next AS team.

64
00:03:33.417 --> 00:03:36.867
But again, React team made this,
this is not the next.js's function.

65
00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:41.641
It's just something the React team made,
which is actually quite useful.

66
00:03:41.641 --> 00:03:46.490
If you ever done GraphQL on a server, this
is very similar to a data loader where you

67
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.601
are caching,
things on a per-request level.

68
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:53.342
So you're not doing multiple
database queries for

69
00:03:53.342 --> 00:03:56.046
the same thing on 1 single request.

70
00:03:56.046 --> 00:03:58.531
So it's actually quite useful.

71
00:03:58.531 --> 00:04:04.038
Transitions, transitions are basically you
wanna change some state in a component,

72
00:04:04.038 --> 00:04:06.610
but you don't want the UI to be blocked.

73
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.761
So if you use a U State
hook that blocks the UI.

74
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:12.324
So what if you wanna change some state but
not block the UI?

75
00:04:12.324 --> 00:04:13.686
That's what a transition is.

76
00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:18.630
I think next day's got a lot of heat for
this because the React team didn't

77
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.963
really finalize it, or
they didn't have good use cases for it.

78
00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:27.370
And at the same time, server actions were
really not that useful in the Next.js docs

79
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.873
that we're talking about.

80
00:04:28.873 --> 00:04:32.463
You can use this transition thing and
then they try to explain how to use it.

81
00:04:32.463 --> 00:04:35.550
Well, now, because it's part of React
in the docs and the Next.js docs,

82
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.551
they kind of just link out to it, they're
here, we're not even gonna talk about it.

83
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:41.364
Click here and
go read it from the React docs,

84
00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:42.909
cuz this is just too crazy to explain.

85
00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:47.048
We will be using transitions, and
we'll talk about it and how I use it, and

86
00:04:47.048 --> 00:04:49.061
then server form actions.

87
00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:53.155
This is the one where I think for
most JavaScript developers,

88
00:04:53.155 --> 00:04:55.761
they were what, why are we doing this?

89
00:04:55.761 --> 00:05:01.286
Why did we go from doing a sync, a secret
is functions on form submit, you know,

90
00:05:01.286 --> 00:05:06.581
doing it on submit handler, to now
we're doing actions on the server side.

91
00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:10.918
This kinda feels like PHP or
Laravel or something like that.

92
00:05:10.918 --> 00:05:14.580
And if you ever use one of those
frameworks, if you look at Next.js 13 and

93
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.368
beyond, it feels just one of those
frameworks for better or for worse.

94
00:05:18.368 --> 00:05:22.377
So form actions, again, that's something
that is made possible by React,

95
00:05:22.377 --> 00:05:24.740
the framework, and not so much of Next.js.

96
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.006
So Next.js is just really building on
some of these foundations with their own

97
00:05:28.006 --> 00:05:28.507
opinions.

98
00:05:28.507 --> 00:05:33.427
There really isn't anything new that
they're introducing here other than their

99
00:05:33.427 --> 00:05:35.646
opinions on top of these standards.
