1
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.601
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
let's just make our default route.

2
00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:05.030
So like I said, for the default route,
I typically just do a null.

3
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.955
And again, we don't have a setup that
was gonna trigger an error in which

4
00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:12.636
the default route would be necessary.

5
00:00:12.636 --> 00:00:16.209
The reason you would need a default route
for the most use cases I've seen is

6
00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.170
because these slots can actually
have nested routes as well.

7
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.866
I could put it routes in the slots.

8
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:27.734
And if this events slot, let's say, had
a route that the rsvp slot did not have,

9
00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:32.178
when that URL gets triggered,
it's also going to,

10
00:00:32.178 --> 00:00:38.354
let's say I have a route called
/dashboard/, I don't know, stats.

11
00:00:38.354 --> 00:00:42.041
So inside of events,
I had a stats folder with a page in it.

12
00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:44.701
But in rsvp, I didn't have a stats folder.

13
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:49.075
So whenever I go to /stats,
nothing gets triggered for rsvp, so

14
00:00:49.075 --> 00:00:52.271
you get a 404 cuz it doesn't exist.

15
00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:55.219
So instead,
I'll put a default there for the rsvp,

16
00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.646
which in this case would show,
null, it'll show nothing.

17
00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:01.822
Maybe you would show something or maybe
you'll just remove it in your layout if

18
00:01:01.822 --> 00:01:05.776
you check the path name, but that's an
example of where you would wanna default.

19
00:01:05.776 --> 00:01:09.839
Again, also on the heart refresh,
but for us,

20
00:01:09.839 --> 00:01:15.031
because they're all on the same path,
it doesn't matter.

21
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:18.036
Even a heart refresh,
not really gonna do anything.

22
00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:21.914
I'm doing a Cmd + Shift + R to clear
the cache and refresh, which we will be

23
00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:25.625
using a lot today if you're using Chrome,
we'll be triggering that.

24
00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:30.477
So let's make our
defaults just to be safe.

25
00:01:30.477 --> 00:01:32.933
So that just means we need a default for
our three slots.

26
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:35.297
Our first slot is this page,
that's children.

27
00:01:35.297 --> 00:01:36.914
It's an unnamed slot, but it is a slot.

28
00:01:36.914 --> 00:01:38.477
So let's make a default file here.

29
00:01:38.477 --> 00:01:42.513
I'll say default.tsx, and

30
00:01:42.513 --> 00:01:46.876
I was gonna say, HomeDefault.

31
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:56.645
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
I'm just gonna return null,

32
00:01:59.968 --> 00:02:01.363
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And I'll copy that.

33
00:02:01.363 --> 00:02:04.330
So HomeDefault just returns null.

34
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.718
Same thing for rsvps,
default.tsx, paste that in there.

35
00:02:11.108 --> 00:02:13.675
Change Home to Rsvps.

36
00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:15.878
There we go.

37
00:02:15.878 --> 00:02:16.611
That's a null.

38
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:18.180
And then same thing for events.

39
00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:32.456
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, so
now we have our defaults, we're good.

40
00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.302
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Right now,
it's really not that interesting until

41
00:02:37.302 --> 00:02:38.244
we get some real data on here.

42
00:02:38.244 --> 00:02:42.875
So let's work through that because that's
when I think all the can of worms,

43
00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:45.164
this starts to come out.

44
00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:50.203
And for the most part, I've watched a lot
of people talk about this topic and

45
00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:55.163
teach, and this is the part where I
see there's most of the questions, but

46
00:02:55.163 --> 00:02:57.084
also most of the confusion.

47
00:02:57.084 --> 00:03:00.753
I think there's a lot of people,
and no discredit to them.

48
00:03:00.753 --> 00:03:04.884
There are a lot of people that if you just
follow the docs and you try to teach it,

49
00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:09.283
and the docs themselves don't have good
patterns or examples, neither will you.

50
00:03:09.283 --> 00:03:13.152
So I think that's why you see a lot of
people if you go Google how does caching

51
00:03:13.152 --> 00:03:15.593
index.js app directory work?

52
00:03:15.593 --> 00:03:19.413
You're not gonna get anything good,
in my opinion, or anything accurate or

53
00:03:19.413 --> 00:03:20.366
semi-accurate.

54
00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:24.487
So, cuz a lot of people who are building
with it are probably just busy

55
00:03:24.487 --> 00:03:26.772
building with it and not teaching it.

56
00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:30.411
So, but I build a lot with it, and
I have some pretty strong opinions and

57
00:03:30.411 --> 00:03:31.212
some gotchas.

58
00:03:31.212 --> 00:03:33.909
So happy to talk about it.

59
00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.974
But any questions on this?

60
00:03:36.974 --> 00:03:40.404
&gt;&gt; Student: Can you explain
the default aspect again?

61
00:03:40.404 --> 00:03:44.642
When does Next.js use the default?

62
00:03:44.642 --> 00:03:45.789
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: That's a great question.

63
00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:47.092
According to the docs,

64
00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:51.068
the default file is used to render
a fallback within parallel routes when

65
00:03:51.068 --> 00:03:55.352
Next.js cannot recover a slot's
active state after a full page load.

66
00:03:55.352 --> 00:03:59.314
So during soft navigation, which I said
is client side navigation when you use

67
00:03:59.314 --> 00:04:03.230
the link, when that happens, Next.js
does keep track of the active state.

68
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.965
You can think of that as the subpage or
the slot, or the route for each slot.

69
00:04:07.965 --> 00:04:11.867
In this case,
that would be like we only have one, so

70
00:04:11.867 --> 00:04:16.861
it'll be page, but some slots
have other routes in them, right?

71
00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:19.399
You can have something else
in here that has a page.

72
00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:25.016
So Next.js is keeping track
of which one of these

73
00:04:25.016 --> 00:04:30.914
routes is the active route for
this slot, right?

74
00:04:30.914 --> 00:04:33.618
We don't have any nested
routes on our slot, so

75
00:04:33.618 --> 00:04:35.927
we don't actually run into this issue.

76
00:04:35.927 --> 00:04:42.678
What the default file does is it will load
this default here when it cannot figure

77
00:04:42.678 --> 00:04:49.126
out what other route inside your slot
needs to be rendered on a full refresh,

78
00:04:49.126 --> 00:04:54.595
because the tracking mechanism
is client side, it's a cache.

79
00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:57.695
So when you refresh,
it goes away, so it forgot.

80
00:04:57.695 --> 00:05:00.104
So that's what a full
heart reload would do.

81
00:05:00.104 --> 00:05:04.674
So that's what the default will be for
in the case of that example.

82
00:05:04.674 --> 00:05:09.559
The other example is, yeah, this is
the other example I was talking about.

83
00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:14.510
So and this example would be,
you can see, let me bold this up.

84
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.549
You can see here that they
have a slot called team.

85
00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:21.496
It has a subroute called settings, right?

86
00:05:21.496 --> 00:05:25.670
There's a sibling slot called analytics,
it does not have settings.

87
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:32.417
So if I were to go to /settings, that
will load this slot and this slot's page.

88
00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:35.160
Because these are parallel,
they have to run the same.

89
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.096
They do the same thing,
that's why it's called parallel.

90
00:05:38.096 --> 00:05:42.136
It's going to attempt to do
a /settings on this slot.

91
00:05:42.136 --> 00:05:45.235
There isn't one, so
it'll 404, it'll break.

92
00:05:45.235 --> 00:05:50.746
So you set a default as in, if there
isn't one, this is the one that you load.

93
00:05:50.746 --> 00:05:52.352
So that's what this would be for.

94
00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:57.101
We don't have this example cuz we
don't have any nested folders in our

95
00:05:57.101 --> 00:05:58.319
parallel slots.

96
00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:03.767
I couldn't think of a use case,
it's kinda crazy, but yeah.

97
00:06:03.767 --> 00:06:08.202
&gt;&gt; Student: So that nested slot that
you had, that would be its own page.

98
00:06:08.202 --> 00:06:14.553
But I'm curious to, say,
you had another folder called settings,

99
00:06:14.553 --> 00:06:18.071
I guess that was outside of that slot.

100
00:06:18.071 --> 00:06:22.671
I mean, as you wanna do that in that case
or with that kind of interfere with this

101
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:26.518
kind of layout or kind of configuration
you have for the routing?

102
00:06:26.518 --> 00:06:31.933
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: If you had another folder
called settings outside of this example,

103
00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:33.756
that should be fine.

104
00:06:33.756 --> 00:06:37.868
In fact,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I think they probably

105
00:06:37.868 --> 00:06:38.709
meant to put that here.

106
00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:41.575
I don't even know how this is working
without a settings folder out here.

107
00:06:41.575 --> 00:06:43.427
Well, okay, there's a default here.

108
00:06:43.427 --> 00:06:46.574
Okay, yeah,
you would want that because- Okay.

109
00:06:46.574 --> 00:06:49.789
This is not part of the route segment.

110
00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:55.775
So in this case, if you went to settings,
there would be no page.

111
00:06:55.775 --> 00:06:59.631
It would only show this,
this root default for children.

112
00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:02.357
And then it would show this default for
analytics, and

113
00:07:02.357 --> 00:07:06.595
then it will show this page for
settings, all inside this layout.

114
00:07:06.595 --> 00:07:11.644
But if you had a settings folder here,
then instead of showing this default,

115
00:07:11.644 --> 00:07:15.617
it would show the settings page for
the children in a layout.

116
00:07:15.617 --> 00:07:20.198
And then it would show the settings page
for the team slot in the layout, and

117
00:07:20.198 --> 00:07:25.140
then it would show the default page for
the analytics slot in the layout.

118
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.414
&gt;&gt; Student: Got it, okay,
that makes more sense.

119
00:07:27.414 --> 00:07:28.500
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Student: Thank you.

120
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.029
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yep.

121
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:36.228
&gt;&gt; Student: So parallel routes basically
allow you to render multiple pages within

122
00:07:36.228 --> 00:07:37.010
your layout?

123
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.778
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yep, multiple pages within
your layout, that act exactly like pages,

124
00:07:40.778 --> 00:07:42.764
they follow the same rules as pages.

125
00:07:42.764 --> 00:07:44.749
They just don't have any route segments.
