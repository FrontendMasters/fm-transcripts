00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.019
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: How's it going, everybody?

2
00:00:01.019 --> 00:00:05.390
And welcome to Intermediate Next.js,
I'm your instructor Scott Moss.

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.446
I've been fortunate enough to kinda been
there in the early days when a lot of

4
00:00:08.446 --> 00:00:10.263
these frameworks were
coming to fruition and

5
00:00:10.263 --> 00:00:12.770
worked with some of the teams
that created these frameworks.

6
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.661
So I've just been involved on the low
level, early on and even now in my career,

7
00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:19.924
I'm still involved as much as I can.

8
00:00:19.924 --> 00:00:23.345
And then when it comes to Next.js,
I've been there since day one,

9
00:00:23.345 --> 00:00:24.667
I love the Vercel team.

10
00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:27.629
I've been using them since they
were called now, and then Zeit, and

11
00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:28.827
then now Vercel.

12
00:00:28.827 --> 00:00:32.674
And Next.js has pretty much been my go-to
framework before it was recommended on

13
00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:33.462
the React docs.

14
00:00:33.462 --> 00:00:35.807
So I'm kinda OG Next.js.

15
00:00:35.807 --> 00:00:39.443
And this course is just like a further
extension on the intro course of

16
00:00:39.443 --> 00:00:40.268
our time talk.

17
00:00:40.268 --> 00:00:43.602
If you haven't checked out that intro
course, and you're looking to get

18
00:00:43.602 --> 00:00:46.853
started the Next.js, highly recommend
checking that one out first.

19
00:00:46.853 --> 00:00:51.241
Because this one is expecting you
just know a little bit about Next.js.

20
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:53.496
We do get into the weeds
here a little bit.

21
00:00:53.496 --> 00:00:58.099
But if you haven't paying attention to
anything Next.js related, you know that

22
00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:02.184
they've had some major updates in
the last year and a half on their side.

23
00:01:02.184 --> 00:01:05.948
But also because there were a lot
of downstream changes from React.

24
00:01:05.948 --> 00:01:09.528
Even with the new React version 19
coming out, there's a bunch going on.

25
00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:12.872
So a combination of those things,
the Vercel team decided

26
00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:16.568
to create some somewhat
controversial features, I would say.

27
00:01:16.568 --> 00:01:18.678
I mean, because they were
just hugely breaking changes.

28
00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:23.187
But I think once you learn the patterns,
and you adopt them, you come to realize

29
00:01:23.187 --> 00:01:27.777
the beauty and why they made those changes
and how you can take advantage of them.

30
00:01:27.777 --> 00:01:29.681
So in this course,
I wanna talk about that, right?

31
00:01:29.681 --> 00:01:34.537
There are a lot of unsaid patterns
that I've learned from using Next.js

32
00:01:34.537 --> 00:01:38.751
in production for
some time now that aren't in any docs.

33
00:01:38.751 --> 00:01:40.422
Some of them are my opinions and

34
00:01:40.422 --> 00:01:43.765
things like that, but
a lot of them are just what the community

35
00:01:43.765 --> 00:01:48.143
have developed over time since some
of these new features have come out.

36
00:01:48.143 --> 00:01:51.391
Let's walk through some of
the resources of the course and

37
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:54.652
kinda just get our bearings,
and then we'll hop into it.

38
00:01:54.652 --> 00:02:00.103
So first things first is,
there's a repo here or my GitHub.

39
00:02:00.103 --> 00:02:01.711
My Github is this.

40
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:06.154
It's named after my son, Hendrixer,
and the course is intermediate-nextjs.

41
00:02:07.434 --> 00:02:09.814
So fork and clone down that repo.

42
00:02:11.514 --> 00:02:13.281
In the read me,
you'll find a link to the course notes.

43
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:15.772
So these are the notes
that we'll be following,

44
00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:20.004
I'm just gonna hop into the session 0,
talk about the intro here a little bit.

45
00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:24.761
Just to recap of what Next.js is, again,
I'm assuming you've at least built

46
00:02:24.761 --> 00:02:28.823
a hello world with Next.js,
hopefully, with the app directory.

47
00:02:28.823 --> 00:02:32.688
If you haven't built anything with the app
directory, that's fine if you have

48
00:02:32.688 --> 00:02:35.927
experience with the pages directory,
but I won't be going over.

49
00:02:35.927 --> 00:02:38.953
I won't be doing a tour of, here's every
single thing with the app directory,

50
00:02:38.953 --> 00:02:40.574
that's gonna be in the intro course.

51
00:02:40.574 --> 00:02:44.662
So I walk through that thoroughly, I hold
your hand and walk you through that.

52
00:02:44.662 --> 00:02:47.721
But this one is just assuming you've
at least built something with the app

53
00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:48.874
directory.

54
00:02:48.874 --> 00:02:52.448
But I think if you do have extensive
experience with the pages,

55
00:02:52.448 --> 00:02:56.234
you'll probably be fine here,
just ask questions along the way.

56
00:02:56.234 --> 00:03:01.447
So Next.js framework on top of
a framework built by Vercel.

57
00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:05.814
It's basically, I like to describe
it as the rails for React.

58
00:03:05.814 --> 00:03:09.154
It's just a bunch of
opinions baked into React.

59
00:03:09.154 --> 00:03:11.537
And if you go to the React Docs
as far as getting started,

60
00:03:11.537 --> 00:03:13.080
it's the recommended framework.

61
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.374
It's literally the number
one framework to use.

62
00:03:15.374 --> 00:03:17.879
I think it wasn't even that long ago,

63
00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.946
where they recommended
use create React app.

64
00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:23.097
And now, I don't think they
mentioned that anywhere.

65
00:03:23.097 --> 00:03:27.306
It's like at the bottom sermon,
we also have this thing called CRH.

66
00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:30.005
Maybe if you wanna check that out,
but for the most part,

67
00:03:30.005 --> 00:03:31.588
it's really gonna be Next.js.

68
00:03:31.588 --> 00:03:34.462
And just to see how far
along they've come,

69
00:03:34.462 --> 00:03:38.577
if you just go look on their website and
look at who's using it,

70
00:03:38.577 --> 00:03:43.795
you have copies of all sizes, and, I mean,
OpenAI uses them for so much stuff.

71
00:03:43.795 --> 00:03:47.936
It's just incredible what they've been
able to achieve with the framework and

72
00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:51.595
such a fragmented landscape when
it comes to front-end JavaScript.

73
00:03:51.595 --> 00:03:54.618
So I'm still just impressed that
they're able to do that, and

74
00:03:54.618 --> 00:03:55.825
I'm just a big fan of it.

75
00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:57.887
So here's some of the topics
we're gonna cover.

76
00:03:59.268 --> 00:04:02.292
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It's me just spitting out a
random list of all the things that I know

77
00:04:02.292 --> 00:04:03.758
we're gonna be talking about.

78
00:04:03.758 --> 00:04:07.226
So server actions and mutations,
so if you've tried to use those.

79
00:04:07.226 --> 00:04:10.370
I know in my intro course,
server actions and mutations,

80
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.138
you had to enable them because
they were not enabled by default.

81
00:04:14.138 --> 00:04:17.138
And I think in that course,
I said, I don't use these.

82
00:04:17.138 --> 00:04:19.568
And it wasn't because it was experimental.

83
00:04:19.568 --> 00:04:21.703
It was cuz I just couldn't
find a good use case for them.

84
00:04:21.703 --> 00:04:23.126
I was like, why would I do this?

85
00:04:23.126 --> 00:04:26.110
I could just use a route handler,
okay, that is not the case anymore.

86
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.926
I pretty much always use server actions
and mutations, now you'll see why.

87
00:04:29.926 --> 00:04:35.196
And rarely do I use the route handlers for
a lot of things.

88
00:04:35.196 --> 00:04:37.406
We'll talk about form actions,
which are really cool.

89
00:04:37.406 --> 00:04:39.758
Some special hooks that come with that,
transition hooks.

90
00:04:39.758 --> 00:04:45.474
Middleware, which is not really new to
Next.js 13 plus, but it's very useful when

91
00:04:45.474 --> 00:04:50.668
you think about different environments
like Edge and things like that.

92
00:04:50.668 --> 00:04:54.751
How to do things like protecting
your routes with authentication,

93
00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:56.119
it's way different.

94
00:04:56.119 --> 00:05:00.315
Server component data fetching,
caching server components data,

95
00:05:00.315 --> 00:05:04.946
memorizing server side data calls,
caching revalidation, streaming and

96
00:05:04.946 --> 00:05:09.741
suspense error handling, parallel routing,
route matching and a lot more.

97
00:05:09.741 --> 00:05:11.640
There really is just a lot in this course,

98
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.482
this might be one of the most
extensive courses I've taught.

99
00:05:14.482 --> 00:05:18.791
So it's gonna be a lot packed into
this one, so if you're looking in

100
00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:23.508
the looking for a wide net of
covering things, this is the course.

101
00:05:23.508 --> 00:05:26.994
We're talking about the prerequisites,
you know JavaScript, you know React,

102
00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:28.518
you build some things in Next.js.

103
00:05:29.758 --> 00:05:33.308
As far as the format, it's pretty much
similar to how I teach most of my courses.

104
00:05:33.308 --> 00:05:36.568
I'll introduce a concept, I'll talk about
it, most of it will be in the notes.

105
00:05:36.568 --> 00:05:41.118
I typically kinda wanna make sure I'm
saying the same thing that the creators

106
00:05:41.118 --> 00:05:43.083
are saying, but in my own words.

107
00:05:43.083 --> 00:05:46.971
So most of those lecture notes are just my
interpretation, what the docs are saying,

108
00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:48.325
and then from my experience.

109
00:05:48.325 --> 00:05:51.918
But for the most case, a lot of that
information is gonna be on the docs.

110
00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:54.962
And then I kinda walk through
that interpretation of, yeah,

111
00:05:54.962 --> 00:05:56.199
this is what this means.

112
00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.098
Here's some gotchas, stuff like that.

113
00:05:58.098 --> 00:06:00.709
And then we apply that to
something practical, and

114
00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:04.730
then we just do that on repeat, until we
finish the things we wanna talk about.

115
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.800
Yeah, before we get into the course, so
let me show you what you're gonna be

116
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.720
building so
[LAUGH] you know what's happening.

117
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.543
So we're gonna be building an event
app where you can make events and

118
00:06:15.543 --> 00:06:18.769
have attendees, RSVP and things like that.

119
00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:20.678
It's called party with a D.

120
00:06:20.678 --> 00:06:22.941
So that's what we're
[LAUGH] gonna be building.

121
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:25.069
Right now, here's the sign-in form,

122
00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:27.830
we need to figure out a couple
things to enable this.

123
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.195
So I'm just gonna sign in with an account
that I think I have already, let me see.

124
00:06:33.195 --> 00:06:34.211
Cool, yeah, here we go.

125
00:06:34.211 --> 00:06:36.930
So you get to this dashboard.

126
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.367
This dashboard is just like a combination
of a bunch of stuff that kinda shows you

127
00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:45.344
your current RSVS that you have,
the latest events that you created and

128
00:06:45.344 --> 00:06:47.000
what their statuses are, and

129
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.527
then total attendees across
all your events as a number.

130
00:06:50.527 --> 00:06:52.937
So this is quite interesting
how we're gonna make this.

131
00:06:52.937 --> 00:06:55.867
I'm very excited to explore all of this.
