1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.600
Connect the font strategies
to their definitions.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.446
So we have font-display block,
swap, fallback, optional, and auto.

3
00:00:07.446 --> 00:00:10.943
And then temporarily renders an invisible
font until the custom font has been

4
00:00:10.943 --> 00:00:12.140
downloaded.

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.020
Use a fallback font while
the custom font is downloading.

6
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.920
And switch to the custom
font when available.

7
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.240
Only use the custom font if it's available
and otherwise just use a fallback font.

8
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.798
Allows the browser to determine
the most appropriate behavior for

9
00:00:25.798 --> 00:00:28.973
font loading, or
use a custom font if it's available, and

10
00:00:28.973 --> 00:00:32.298
use a fallback font if the custom
font is not available [LAUGH].

11
00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.529
So first we have font-display block which
temporarily renders an invisible font

12
00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:42.935
until the custom font has been downloaded.

13
00:00:42.935 --> 00:00:45.743
Then we have swap which uses
the custom font if it's available or

14
00:00:45.743 --> 00:00:48.195
use a fallback font if the custom
font is not available.

15
00:00:48.195 --> 00:00:52.099
We have fallback to use a fallback font
while the custom font is still loading and

16
00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:55.300
switch to the custom
font when it's available.

17
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.510
We have optional to really only use
a custom font if it's available within

18
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.130
a short amount of time, otherwise just
keep on using that fallback font.

19
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.131
And auto is kind of just either of
the above, whatever the browser feels like

20
00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:09.649
to determine the most appropriate
behavior for the font loading.

21
00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.620
So to kind of visualize block, so
first it just renders that invisible font.

22
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.297
And if the custom font isn't available at
the point which is usually around three

23
00:01:18.297 --> 00:01:21.050
seconds, it will fall
back to a system font.

24
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.501
And then anytime as the fallback or

25
00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:29.260
only whenever the custom font loader has
loaded will it swap to that custom font.

26
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.588
But that swapping period is just infinite,
so

27
00:01:31.588 --> 00:01:35.296
it'll just render the fallback font
until the custom font is available.

28
00:01:35.296 --> 00:01:39.870
Now, with the invisible period you
will get that flash of invisible text,

29
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.790
that F-O-I-T that you can sometimes or
that, I don't know,

30
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.305
abbreviation you might see sometimes.

31
00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:50.320
&gt;&gt; FOIT.
&gt;&gt; FOIT, yeah, FOIT, [LAUGH] one of those.

32
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.540
So yeah, that's with block.

33
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.560
Next we have swap which doesn't
render the invisible font at all.

34
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.308
So in this case,
you don't have that invisible text but

35
00:01:59.308 --> 00:02:03.880
you have the unstyled text with this FOIT
stuff that we're just talking about.

36
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.536
So whenever the font is available,
then swap to the custom font.

37
00:02:09.536 --> 00:02:15.150
Next, we have fallback which only
has a very short invisible period.

38
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.651
And then it just uses or

39
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:21.230
it renders the fallback font if
it's not available at that moment.

40
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.025
And if the custom one still hasn't loaded
after I believe it's three seconds,

41
00:02:25.025 --> 00:02:27.420
then it will just keep on
using the fallback font.

42
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.630
There will be no swapping.

43
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.180
So it kind of says, all right, it's fine,
I'll render fallback font for now.

44
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.938
But at this point you
really need to be loaded or

45
00:02:34.938 --> 00:02:36.796
otherwise I'm not even
gonna swap you anymore.

46
00:02:36.796 --> 00:02:39.920
To kind of make sure that
the user experience is not or

47
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.980
that the page doesn't jerk around too
much if a custom font is loaded later.

48
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.720
But if it is loaded,
then it'll use the custom font.

49
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.830
That was a weird thing.

50
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.820
And then we have optional which it
also renders that invisible font for

51
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.940
a very short amount of time.

52
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.970
And even after that short amount of time,
if the font hasn't loaded, then it's like,

53
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.390
all right, I won't even try.

54
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.080
There'll be no swapping.

55
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.876
It might still download the web
font in the background so

56
00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:13.500
maybe the next that page that uses
it will still use the custom font.

57
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.327
But on the current page of use optional,

58
00:03:15.327 --> 00:03:19.720
it'll just keep on using the fallback
font if it's not instantly available.

59
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.434
Yeah, and then there's no auto cuz
the browser is just kind of checking

60
00:03:24.434 --> 00:03:28.520
which font method is best to
load with the current bandwidth,

61
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.289
network connections, stuff like that.

62
00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:35.481
&gt;&gt; Question, have you ever had to or

63
00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:43.375
which process would be the best
way to handle fall jank, kind of?

64
00:03:43.375 --> 00:03:47.122
&gt;&gt; It depends, for example, optional is
pretty good if the content that you're

65
00:03:47.122 --> 00:03:49.805
rendering is just super important for
the user to read.

66
00:03:49.805 --> 00:03:53.962
And you don't wanna create a negative
experience by cause suddenly swapping it,

67
00:03:53.962 --> 00:03:55.962
this shouldn't really be for a title.

68
00:03:55.962 --> 00:03:57.473
&gt;&gt; System to the custom.

69
00:03:57.473 --> 00:04:03.956
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so normally I use swap cuz there
you don't have the invisible fonts,

70
00:04:03.956 --> 00:04:08.023
you have the unstyled
font which isn't great.

71
00:04:08.023 --> 00:04:13.637
But you have custom fallback fonts so
you can also set which could be a font and

72
00:04:13.637 --> 00:04:16.456
you also have the adjust line height.

73
00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:20.671
You have glyph stuff that you can
also add to your font face to really,

74
00:04:20.671 --> 00:04:24.305
really get your fallback font
super close to your web font so

75
00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:26.790
that you don't have that layout shift.

76
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.650
Cuz sometimes what happens is that
a fallback font is way bigger or

77
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.054
smaller than a custom font, and

78
00:04:31.054 --> 00:04:34.550
then it suddenly renders on two lines
instead of one and that's just horrible.

79
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.478
You get a bad CLS.

80
00:04:35.478 --> 00:04:36.270
It's super bad.

81
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.528
For example, next and also others
have next fonts which automatically

82
00:04:41.528 --> 00:04:45.260
creates a fallback font based on
the web font that you're gonna use.

83
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.420
So it uses with the glyphs and everything.

84
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.615
I don't know too much about type
phases and stuff like that.

85
00:04:51.615 --> 00:04:54.345
But yeah,
it tries to closely match the web font so

86
00:04:54.345 --> 00:04:57.205
that your fallback font is
still instantly available.

87
00:04:57.205 --> 00:05:01.412
It's still just a system font but the
glyphs and everything kind of precisely

88
00:05:01.412 --> 00:05:05.305
match the web font that you're gonna,
which is pretty cool, I think.

89
00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:09.912
But yeah, just make sure that the fallback
font isn't like Times New Roman when your

90
00:05:09.912 --> 00:05:12.029
custom font is some sans serif stuff.

91
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.480
Yeah, but they all have their use cases.

92
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.300
It just depends on the type of content
that you're rendering, I guess.
