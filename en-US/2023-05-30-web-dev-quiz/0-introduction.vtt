Hi everyone, I'm Lydia Hallie.

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.196
I'm a staff developer at Good Ever Sell.

3
00:00:04.196 --> 00:00:09.435
And today, we're kind of doing a different
type of format for this workshop, because

4
00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:14.275
we'll be doing a quiz of 30 questions
with so many topics on web development.

5
00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:17.598
JavaScript browsers,
web performance, CSS security,

6
00:00:17.598 --> 00:00:21.478
basically all the concepts that you
have to know as a web developer.

7
00:00:21.478 --> 00:00:26.144
But it's not always easy to get exposed
to kind of more than nitty-gritty

8
00:00:26.144 --> 00:00:28.175
details of all these features,

9
00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:32.780
but they're still very important to
know and to be a good web developer.

10
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.200
So let's get into the very first question.
