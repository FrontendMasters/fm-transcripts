00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.872
This is my favorite tech demo of
why Tailwind can be really cool.

2
00:00:03.872 --> 00:00:07.145
Head to Results.jsx.

3
00:00:07.145 --> 00:00:12.059
Here, instead of search,

4
00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.474
put grid gap-4 grid-cols-2.

5
00:00:25.443 --> 00:00:29.051
Just like that, I have a grid layout.

6
00:00:29.051 --> 00:00:34.003
It took me ten seconds to do, very little
recollection of how grid works and

7
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:35.271
that kinda stuff.

8
00:00:37.012 --> 00:00:40.085
Let's take it one step further.

9
00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:45.343
Grid gap-4, and then you put grid-cols-1.

10
00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:53.024
And then at the small breakpoint,
so sm stands for

11
00:00:53.024 --> 00:00:57.843
small breakpoint, make it grid-cols-2.

12
00:00:57.843 --> 00:01:03.645
And then at the large breakpoint,
make it grid-cols-3

13
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.486
Now, it's in three.

14
00:01:10.486 --> 00:01:12.858
It's in two.

15
00:01:12.858 --> 00:01:13.358
It's in one.

16
00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:22.906
Pretty compelling, right?

17
00:01:22.906 --> 00:01:27.418
With 15 seconds,
I have a fully responsive grid layout.

18
00:01:29.494 --> 00:01:32.207
One, it's the magic of the CSS grid,
it's just amazing.

19
00:01:32.207 --> 00:01:35.067
If you don't know CSS flex and grid,

20
00:01:35.067 --> 00:01:39.597
definitely take Jen's course
on it on Frontend Masters.

21
00:01:39.597 --> 00:01:43.533
But this is really compelling to me, that
it's very productive to just throw stuff

22
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.232
out like this without having
to think about, all right,

23
00:01:46.232 --> 00:01:48.162
what do I need exactly to do that in grid?

24
00:01:48.162 --> 00:01:51.820
I mean, I could definitely do this in
a grid, it would take me five minutes

25
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.360
as opposed to 15 seconds, cuz I'd
have to go look it up and remember,

26
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.614
okay, this is where all these goes for
grid.

27
00:02:01.547 --> 00:02:03.437
You can define these breakpoints.

28
00:02:03.437 --> 00:02:07.664
So I'm not showing you how to do this,
but in Tailwind you can actually go and

29
00:02:07.664 --> 00:02:12.379
you can define what is small mean, what
is medium mean, what is orange500 mean?

30
00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.899
You can define all those various
variables within Tailwind.

31
00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:20.003
But the defaults are really good, so
I tend to not modify them very much.

32
00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:22.256
But that's totally on the table
if you wanna do that.

33
00:02:22.256 --> 00:02:27.251
I just remember having to do this
stuff by hand back in the Golden Days,

34
00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:29.716
just kidding, I'm not that old.

35
00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:35.706
But back in 2010 when I was
writing code like this.

36
00:02:35.706 --> 00:02:38.752
2010 Brian is screaming
at how easy this is.

37
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:46.822
I remember having to do responsive layouts
in Reddit, so that would have been 2013 or

38
00:02:46.822 --> 00:02:48.067
something like that.

39
00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:51.653
Having to code this stuff with floats and

40
00:02:51.653 --> 00:02:56.511
stuff like that was just an absolute mess,
terrible.

41
00:02:56.511 --> 00:03:00.151
I remember the first time I saw Pinterest,
and my wife was like, hey,

42
00:03:00.151 --> 00:03:03.194
check out this cool app that
you can pin stuff on like that.

43
00:03:03.194 --> 00:03:05.240
I was like,
how are they doing that layout?

44
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.284
I was so upset.

45
00:03:07.284 --> 00:03:10.612
I spent days pulling apart their CSS
to figure out how they're doing it.

46
00:03:10.612 --> 00:03:13.438
And then I found out they were doing
with JavaScript and I was mad.

47
00:03:13.438 --> 00:03:18.300
Anyway, I don't know why that's relevant
to what we're talking about right now,

48
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.050
but it felt like a relevant
confession to have.

49
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.039
This is so easy.

50
00:03:28.314 --> 00:03:35.740
Cool, let's go do some
positioning as well.

51
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.142
I just wanted to show you how to do that.

52
00:03:38.142 --> 00:03:39.933
Head to Pet.jsx.

53
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.819
Link, we'll do relative block here,
relative and block

54
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.161
And then this class name
here where info is,

55
00:03:56.161 --> 00:04:01.072
just put absolute bottom-0, left-0,

56
00:04:01.072 --> 00:04:07.550
bg-gradient, -to-tr,

57
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.188
From-white-to-transparent.

58
00:04:16.641 --> 00:04:23.679
And then pr-2, so
padding right-2, padding top-2.

59
00:04:29.705 --> 00:04:34.398
Okay, and then here, we get this nice
little gradient where it start to

60
00:04:34.398 --> 00:04:38.087
white and then kinda tapers
off here into the top right.

61
00:04:38.087 --> 00:04:42.016
It's positioned absolutely on
the bottom of the picture.

62
00:04:42.016 --> 00:04:45.502
It just kind of gives it
a nice kind of look to it, so

63
00:04:45.502 --> 00:04:47.839
that they're labelled nicely.

64
00:04:49.859 --> 00:04:52.597
So again, hopefully by going through this,

65
00:04:52.597 --> 00:04:55.912
even though you might still
be minorly disgusted of how

66
00:04:55.912 --> 00:05:00.181
long these classNames are,
can you see how fast I'm going with this?

67
00:05:00.181 --> 00:05:03.767
It's just wild,
how productive you can be with these.

68
00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:11.085
And I'm still relatively a Tailwind newbie
when it comes to these kinda things.

69
00:05:11.085 --> 00:05:15.805
People that have worked in Tailwind
a lot get really productive and

70
00:05:15.805 --> 00:05:20.997
get really fast with this kinda stuff,
so, Okay,

71
00:05:24.296 --> 00:05:28.030
We did not do Details,jsx, so
if you click on one of these,

72
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.063
it still looks weird and gross.

73
00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:35.486
So my invitation for you after this
section is to go do details on your own.

74
00:05:35.486 --> 00:05:41.114
You can either make it look like it did
before or you can make it your own, that's

75
00:05:41.114 --> 00:05:46.661
definitely a playground for you to go and
try and expand your Tailwind skills.

76
00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:51.393
I've now cut a checkpoint here,
so you can go to,

77
00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:55.690
let me just show you,
down here on Tailwind.

78
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.998
At the bottom, if you click here,

79
00:05:57.998 --> 00:06:01.748
this will take you to the complete
project up until now.

80
00:06:01.748 --> 00:06:05.688
It's basically everything
that we just did together.
