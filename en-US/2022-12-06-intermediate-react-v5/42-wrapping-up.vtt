1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:07.380
That is it,
that is all of the intermediate React v5.

2
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.340
Hopefully this felt like you expanded
your React toolbox a bit more into

3
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.577
the ecosystem, so you kind of understand
all the tools going around React.

4
00:00:15.577 --> 00:00:19.386
I feel like we've done a pretty
good job here covering most

5
00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:23.442
things that you're gonna find
applicable to writing React.

6
00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:27.049
Whether that's,
how do I work with TypeScript?

7
00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:32.055
Or how does testing work with React,
whether that's Mocha,

8
00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:35.631
or AVA, or Vtest, or something like that.

9
00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:38.370
If you like the course, please tweet
at me, I'm always happy to hear

10
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.078
stuff about that, please star the repo,
that's always awesome.

11
00:00:42.924 --> 00:00:48.104
Just to give you some next step projects,
try to get 100% coverage on all the tests,

12
00:00:48.104 --> 00:00:52.314
I try and write good tests, that would
be another good thing to do here.

13
00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:58.074
Go back and finish the migration
from CSS to totally on Tailwind.css,

14
00:00:58.074 --> 00:01:00.000
which should be great.

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.559
Try combining some of the sections,
like try TypeScript plus testing,

16
00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:11.086
or try testing plus Node JS,
anything like that.

17
00:01:11.086 --> 00:01:14.631
Or you can try putting them all together,
that would be cool as well.

18
00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:18.578
And then, as always,
I like seeing your final deployed project.

19
00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:24.116
So try throwing it up on Vercel and
see what happens.

20
00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:28.813
And then the other one I was gonna say is
try putting this project together with

21
00:01:28.813 --> 00:01:30.836
something like NextJS or Remix,

22
00:01:30.836 --> 00:01:34.534
or one of those full stack React
application kind of things.

23
00:01:34.534 --> 00:01:36.378
There's a Remix course on here from Kent.

24
00:01:36.378 --> 00:01:39.248
There's a Remix course on
Frontend Masters, yeah,

25
00:01:39.248 --> 00:01:43.649
Remix course from Frontend Masters,
there's a Next course from Scott and Moss,

26
00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.387
all sorts of really cool stuff.

27
00:01:45.387 --> 00:01:49.766
Okay, before we wrap up,
does anyone have any questions?

28
00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:51.208
Yeah, Mark.

29
00:01:51.208 --> 00:01:54.463
&gt;&gt; Have you used Storybook or components?

30
00:01:54.463 --> 00:01:57.040
Would you recommend it?

31
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.412
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
there's a project called Storybook.

32
00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:04.272
And what Storybook is basically like,
you can make individual components.

33
00:02:04.272 --> 00:02:09.602
And then you can make this living
documentation around your components of,

34
00:02:09.602 --> 00:02:12.358
here is my double dropdown component.

35
00:02:12.358 --> 00:02:16.855
Here's all of the props that it takes,
here's all the permutations of this thing.

36
00:02:16.855 --> 00:02:22.330
So it's kind of like a gallery of
all your components, super useful.

37
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.072
If you have a design system,

38
00:02:24.072 --> 00:02:27.636
it's basically required that
you use Storybook with it.

39
00:02:27.636 --> 00:02:30.606
There's actually a whole company
now that is behind Storybook,

40
00:02:30.606 --> 00:02:32.338
which I didn't know until recently.

41
00:02:34.803 --> 00:02:38.264
So I've only ever consumed Storybook,

42
00:02:38.264 --> 00:02:42.651
I've actually never set up Storybook for
myself.

43
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:44.905
Stripe uses Storybook, or at least did.

44
00:02:44.905 --> 00:02:49.127
I don't remember if we do anymore,
cuz we have our own design system.

45
00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:52.465
So there's a design systems team
that makes all these components.

46
00:02:52.465 --> 00:02:56.284
And then there's a storybook for us to be
able to go peruse how to use all of them.

47
00:02:56.284 --> 00:02:59.979
So it's basically generated
documentation from components.

48
00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.707
So I've consumed it, I liked it.

49
00:03:02.707 --> 00:03:07.354
If you have those sorts of problems,
I would suggest it, yeah.

50
00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:11.290
&gt;&gt; And also mentioned we do
have a Storybook course by.

51
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.494
&gt;&gt; There you go, check that out,
that must be great.

52
00:03:15.494 --> 00:03:18.394
&gt;&gt; And
then shout out to the React Learning Path.

53
00:03:18.394 --> 00:03:21.275
&gt;&gt; Shout out to the React Learning Path,

54
00:03:21.275 --> 00:03:24.796
there's lots of high
quality stuff on there.

55
00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:28.013
I'm on there twice, so
it has to be good, I'm just kidding.

56
00:03:28.013 --> 00:03:34.098
Learning Paths, it's down here, React.

57
00:03:34.098 --> 00:03:35.961
So, these ones will be on here,

58
00:03:35.961 --> 00:03:39.283
you got the one from
State Management from Steve Kinney.

59
00:03:39.283 --> 00:03:44.138
&gt;&gt; It'll be actually replaced
with React Performance.

60
00:03:44.138 --> 00:03:45.006
&gt;&gt; Cool.

61
00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:47.407
&gt;&gt; Which covers, of course.

62
00:03:47.407 --> 00:03:50.349
&gt;&gt; Further in-depth performance
stuff than I covered, yeah.

63
00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.513
Awesome, and then there's more.

64
00:03:52.513 --> 00:03:55.618
Yeah, Gatsby, if that's your speed.

65
00:03:55.618 --> 00:03:57.318
Working with Scott, he's great.

66
00:03:57.318 --> 00:03:58.795
I used to work with David at Microsoft.

67
00:03:58.795 --> 00:04:00.095
These are all people that I like.

68
00:04:02.817 --> 00:04:04.587
So yeah, definitely go check that out.

69
00:04:04.587 --> 00:04:07.567
There's gonna be lots of cool stuff for
you to check out.

70
00:04:07.567 --> 00:04:10.453
My favorite part about the learning paths
in Frontend Masters is they're constantly

71
00:04:10.453 --> 00:04:11.303
being updated, right?

72
00:04:11.303 --> 00:04:15.559
So, even if you've looked at it before,
be sure to go check it out again.

73
00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:16.839
All right, hope you enjoyed the course.

74
00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.457
Thanks for sticking with me, and
I will catch you back here probably for

75
00:04:20.457 --> 00:04:21.858
version 9 [LAUGH] someday.

76
00:04:21.858 --> 00:04:26.399
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
