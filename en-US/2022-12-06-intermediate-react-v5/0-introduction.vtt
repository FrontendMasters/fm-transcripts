1
00:00:00.027 --> 00:00:05.274
Welcome to Intermediate React
version five.

2
00:00:05.274 --> 00:00:08.860
This actually all used to be one course,
it was just the complete intro to React.

3
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.570
And I decided, I guess after v3,
I suppose I can math,

4
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.179
to split this into two different courses,

5
00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:22.410
into The Intro to React where
you just build one application.

6
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.638
And then Intermediate React where we
kind of just go off in various little

7
00:00:26.638 --> 00:00:27.479
submodules.

8
00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:32.054
This course intentionally builds
on Complete Intro to React.

9
00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:35.623
If you did not take
the Complete Intro to React,

10
00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:38.933
that's fine as long as
you know React okay.

11
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:42.510
But if you haven't,
I'd invite you to take that one first

12
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.899
because you're gonna learn a bunch
of stuff that will help you in this.

13
00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.669
Or say that differently,

14
00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:53.745
I assume that you know everything that
I taught in Complete Intro to React.

15
00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:58.734
So if you haven't, please go to React,
you can just go to react.holt.courses,

16
00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:03.313
and that'll take you to whatever the most
recent version of this course is.

17
00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:08.030
In our case, it is React v8, so
Complete Intro to React v8 and

18
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.996
Intermediate React v5.

19
00:01:09.996 --> 00:01:13.729
That's the same website for both courses.

20
00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.964
That's why you'll see
Complete Intro to React v8 up here,

21
00:01:16.964 --> 00:01:20.716
it actually is also the Intermediate React
v5 course as well, okay?

22
00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:23.534
Just to give you a little
hint on how this site works,

23
00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:27.462
if I click on something here like you
useReducer here on Hooks in Depths.

24
00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.955
Hooks in Depths is
the name of the section,

25
00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:32.529
useReducer would be
the name of the lesson.

26
00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:36.444
You'll look up here and you'll see
that I have that in the top right, so

27
00:01:36.444 --> 00:01:39.726
you can kind of always keep track
of where I am in the course.

28
00:01:39.726 --> 00:01:43.850
And by all means, please always click on
the Watch on Frontend Masters if you need

29
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.558
to get back to the videos as well.

30
00:01:45.558 --> 00:01:51.629
Okay, Sections two through
seven are all intro stuff,

31
00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:55.194
so feel free to review
those if you need those.

32
00:01:55.194 --> 00:02:00.635
And just to give you a little introduction
to who I am, my name is Brian Holt,

33
00:02:00.635 --> 00:02:04.985
I am a product manager at Stripe,
I manage all the dev tools.

34
00:02:04.985 --> 00:02:10.818
That's the server side, SD,
it's the Stripe CLI, the Stripe Shell.

35
00:02:10.818 --> 00:02:14.512
So if you like stripe.sh, it's like
an in browser shell that I worked on.

36
00:02:14.512 --> 00:02:16.493
That was pretty cool.

37
00:02:16.493 --> 00:02:19.942
I've been doing that for
about 18 months now.

38
00:02:19.942 --> 00:02:24.521
Before that, I worked at Microsoft for
four years, I worked on VS Code,

39
00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:25.732
I worked on Azure.

40
00:02:25.732 --> 00:02:29.055
And then before that, I was a JavaScript
developer and Node developer for

41
00:02:29.055 --> 00:02:29.758
like a decade.

42
00:02:29.758 --> 00:02:34.899
I launched my first React code in
like 2014 when I was at Reddit.

43
00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:38.341
I launched Reddit's first React code,
so that's one of my claims to fame.

44
00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:41.155
And I've been writing React ever since.

45
00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:45.820
So I have a decent amount of
experience and history with React.

46
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.531
And I've taught, at this point,

47
00:02:47.531 --> 00:02:50.426
thousands of people how to
write React all over the world.

48
00:02:50.426 --> 00:02:52.814
So all frameworks have their merits,
right?

49
00:02:52.814 --> 00:02:55.835
I'm not gonna be the kind of person who's
gonna sit and argue with you that React

50
00:02:55.835 --> 00:02:59.058
is better than any of the others, they're
all different tools for different jobs.

51
00:02:59.058 --> 00:03:03.422
It's like you come to me as like, I demand
that we only use hammers in this project

52
00:03:03.422 --> 00:03:07.419
when we're talking about screwing
something in or something like that.

53
00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:08.701
To me, it just doesn't make any sense.

54
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.824
So, who is this course for?

55
00:03:13.824 --> 00:03:14.822
Hopefully, it's for you.

56
00:03:14.822 --> 00:03:18.732
This course is going to assume that
you know JavaScript, so if you don't,

57
00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:21.788
there's plenty of awesome
courses on Frontend Masters.

58
00:03:21.788 --> 00:03:26.686
And I'm gonna assume that you have
basically taken through complete

59
00:03:26.686 --> 00:03:27.875
intro of React.

60
00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:32.461
So you're gonna know the basic
component life cycle, what hooks are,

61
00:03:32.461 --> 00:03:35.831
context portals, refs,
all those kind of things.

62
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:41.428
If you don't, please go take Complete
Intro to React first, come back to now.

63
00:03:41.428 --> 00:03:46.370
The setup for this, please make
sure you have Node JS installed.

64
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.255
I'm gonna say 14 is probably
the bare minimum here,

65
00:03:50.255 --> 00:03:55.496
you might be able to get away with 12,
but maybe just don't get to 16.

66
00:03:55.496 --> 00:04:02.486
I'll be on 16.18, I believe and probably
by the time that you're watching this,

67
00:04:02.486 --> 00:04:07.405
I imagine 18 will be the LTS of node,
18 would be perfect.

68
00:04:07.405 --> 00:04:11.935
You do not have to use Visual Studio Code,
however, I will suggest it.

69
00:04:11.935 --> 00:04:16.048
I do like VS Code, I used to work on it,
so I'm a bit biased, and

70
00:04:16.048 --> 00:04:20.178
I will show you some tips and
tricks about VS Code as we go along.

71
00:04:20.178 --> 00:04:25.090
I use Mono Lisa as my font, be sure to
enable font ligatures if you wanna see

72
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.229
all the combined glyphs just to
show you what that looks like.

73
00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.077
So if I have like a two, let's see.

74
00:04:39.232 --> 00:04:42.585
So this right here is a font ligature
where it's combining two lists together,

75
00:04:42.585 --> 00:04:44.400
it's an equal signs and an angle bracket.

76
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.474
A ligature is the thing that
combines that together.

77
00:04:47.474 --> 00:04:50.441
So, I have those enabled, so
you'll see arrows like this,

78
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:54.631
you'll see double equal signs like that,
you'll see triple equal signs like that,

79
00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:56.338
there's a bunch of them, right?

80
00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:59.088
So if you want that, go ahead and
follow the directions.

81
00:04:59.088 --> 00:05:05.103
I have that link here in the welcome
notes for you to do that.

82
00:05:05.103 --> 00:05:09.980
Mono Lisa is not free but Cascadia Code
is, so if you want a font that does it,

83
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.122
grab that,
Fira Code would be another free one.

84
00:05:13.122 --> 00:05:16.749
I use Dark+ as my code theme,
for my terminal,

85
00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:22.479
I either use VS Codes built-in terminal or
the macOS built-in terminal.

86
00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.928
And then I'm using VS Code icons,

87
00:05:24.928 --> 00:05:29.750
and then I did get a question about
what my prompt is for my terminal.

88
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.873
So if I look at this,
let's see if I go to personal/8react or

89
00:05:34.873 --> 00:05:38.728
something like that,
you can see that it has.

90
00:05:38.728 --> 00:05:42.957
I'm on the main branch, I'm on Node 18.

91
00:05:42.957 --> 00:05:47.049
It'll tell you what your Docker version
is and bunch of stuff like that,

92
00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:50.874
that is called spaceship prompt and
it's for ZSH, just google it,

93
00:05:50.874 --> 00:05:53.984
I'm positive it'll be
the first thing that comes up.

94
00:05:56.046 --> 00:06:00.951
Where to File Issues,
this is itself a open source website.

95
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:05.946
All the lessons are open source and so
if I have spelling mistakes or content

96
00:06:05.946 --> 00:06:11.592
mistakes, please just open a PR, I will
merge those ins, really appreciate that.

97
00:06:11.592 --> 00:06:14.803
This website is open and free forever, so

98
00:06:14.803 --> 00:06:19.847
if you wanna send it to your co-workers,
or if you wanna use it for

99
00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:24.835
your own materials or things like that,
please by all means do.

100
00:06:24.835 --> 00:06:28.537
All the code is licensed under Apache 2.0,
so you can literally copy and

101
00:06:28.537 --> 00:06:30.793
paste my code into your
commercial project.

102
00:06:30.793 --> 00:06:33.805
I encourage you to do that.

103
00:06:33.805 --> 00:06:38.171
Then all the content can be shared
as long as it's being shared freely.

104
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.534
Anything else?

105
00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:45.649
I'm from Seattle, I live in Seattle,
lived there for some years,

106
00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:48.321
I'm originally from Salt Lake City.

107
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:53.638
In my free time, I will travel a lot,
I love to travel.

108
00:06:53.638 --> 00:06:57.623
I hang out with my wife and
son, get on my Peloton and

109
00:06:57.623 --> 00:07:02.354
pretend that I like riding bikes,
played Dota very poorly or

110
00:07:02.354 --> 00:07:05.820
drink either Scotches and IPAs and coffee.

111
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.079
I put all my links down
here to my social medias,

112
00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:09.784
feel free to catch up with me there.

113
00:07:09.784 --> 00:07:14.615
I will tell you that I am
the worst at responding to DMs,

114
00:07:14.615 --> 00:07:16.937
so have patience with me.

115
00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:21.718
And then for my own personal vanity,
please star this repo,

116
00:07:21.718 --> 00:07:23.794
please give me dopamine.

117
00:07:23.794 --> 00:07:29.206
I'm kidding, you can do it if you want to,
but I find it helps if I ask nicely.

118
00:07:29.206 --> 00:07:31.041
There are two repos for this website.

119
00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:34.062
One of them here is the website
you're currently on, so

120
00:07:34.062 --> 00:07:36.711
that's this one,
the Complete Intro to React.

121
00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:39.437
The other one here is the example project.

122
00:07:39.437 --> 00:07:41.933
For this course,
I need you to clone this one,

123
00:07:41.933 --> 00:07:45.649
because everything is going to be
building off of a project, right?

124
00:07:45.649 --> 00:07:47.953
So we have this one here, 14 context.

125
00:07:47.953 --> 00:07:52.224
Basically, we're gonna be taking the last
finished project from the Complete Intro

126
00:07:52.224 --> 00:07:55.201
to React, and then we're gonna
be building on top of that.

127
00:07:55.201 --> 00:07:58.374
So you're gonna be finding yourself
copying and pasting that quite a bit.

128
00:07:58.374 --> 00:08:01.833
And then all of these down here
at the bottom, code splitting,

129
00:08:01.833 --> 00:08:04.966
redux, server side rendering,
all that kind of stuff,

130
00:08:04.966 --> 00:08:09.499
that's all the various different completed
projects if you wanna go see my code.

131
00:08:09.499 --> 00:08:14.262
So just to show you, I use this program
called Kaleidoscope that you can use

132
00:08:14.262 --> 00:08:18.966
anything that compares two directories
to each other, remind me later.

133
00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:24.399
So if I wanted to see what's
different about a particular project,

134
00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:26.792
I can come in here to project.

135
00:08:26.792 --> 00:08:32.027
And if I have steps here, so
if I drag context into here as one,

136
00:08:32.027 --> 00:08:38.498
and then I drag something like,
let's say, transitions in here, right?

137
00:08:38.498 --> 00:08:43.024
I can then see what's changed, right, so
I can see, if I look at SearchParams.jsx,

138
00:08:43.024 --> 00:08:47.302
I can see all the things that I've added,
and subtracted, and things like that.

139
00:08:47.302 --> 00:08:49.569
So that's useful for me,
at least me personally,

140
00:08:49.569 --> 00:08:52.539
to see what's changing between
the various different projects.

141
00:08:52.539 --> 00:08:54.029
So again, please go.

142
00:08:54.029 --> 00:08:56.984
The name of that repo is citr,

143
00:08:56.984 --> 00:09:02.054
which is a Complete Intro
to React v8 Project.

144
00:09:02.054 --> 00:09:04.009
Yeah, one last thing here.

145
00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:06.267
These modules do not build on each other.

146
00:09:06.267 --> 00:09:08.451
So if you are going through this and
you're like,

147
00:09:08.451 --> 00:09:10.951
I profoundly do not wanna
learn about tailwind, right?

148
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:14.034
That's just not something you're
interested in going into,

149
00:09:14.034 --> 00:09:16.021
feel free to totally skip that section.

150
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:19.303
Because every module here is more or
less self-contained, and

151
00:09:19.303 --> 00:09:20.955
they do not build on each other.

152
00:09:22.204 --> 00:09:25.095
So a good project for
you to go do at the end is like if you're

153
00:09:25.095 --> 00:09:27.809
really interested in Tailwind
as well as TypeScript,

154
00:09:27.809 --> 00:09:31.120
go combine those things together
because I don't do that for you.

155
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:37.199
So it might be a good way for you to kind
of understand how the pieces fit together.
