00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.654
So now we have it all set up
to track our adopted pet, but

2
00:00:03.654 --> 00:00:05.600
now we have to start using it.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.204
So let's go to details.jsx,
you can delete this import up here.

4
00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:25.134
From React, we can get rid of useContext,
we're not using context anymore.

5
00:00:25.134 --> 00:00:30.106
We are going to have to import dispatch.

6
00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:35.079
UseDispatch rather.

7
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:42.510
From react-redux.

8
00:00:45.383 --> 00:00:50.445
And then we're going to import

9
00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:57.656
adopt from adopted ./adoptedPetSlice.

10
00:01:02.887 --> 00:01:08.455
Okay, so now get rid of
the context we don't want this,

11
00:01:08.455 --> 00:01:13.329
line 16 and 17 here,
it can just be dropped.

12
00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:20.784
And we're gonna say const
dispatch = useDispatch.

13
00:01:20.784 --> 00:01:25.547
All this does, this useDispatch,
is it gives you back a function here

14
00:01:25.547 --> 00:01:30.086
called dispatch which allows us to
give actions to our core store.

15
00:01:32.918 --> 00:01:34.874
Okay, so this is just a function.

16
00:01:36.817 --> 00:01:40.690
Down here where we do setAdoptedPet.

17
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.638
All we're gonna do instead
is we're gonna say dispatch.

18
00:01:45.857 --> 00:01:49.423
And then we are going to wrap
this in a function called adopt.

19
00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:58.040
So if you remember that little
function I coded for you.

20
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.950
This is just going to make a action
object out of this pet payload,

21
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:11.480
and then it's going to give that to redux,
which is going to run our reducer for us.

22
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.472
So there's a couple steps there.

23
00:02:15.472 --> 00:02:18.629
And again, this used to be a lot more
explicit when you were writing raw Redux.

24
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.830
But this is a lot less code,
but it does the same thing.

25
00:02:28.103 --> 00:02:29.909
Good so far?

26
00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.900
All right, so now this is changing.

27
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.073
So now every time I
click that adopt button,

28
00:02:36.073 --> 00:02:38.210
it is going to get stored in redux.

29
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.313
But now I have to read it out of redux.

30
00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:48.847
So let's go do that,
hop over to SearchParams.jsx.

31
00:02:48.847 --> 00:02:51.902
Get rid of the AdoptedPetContext up here.

32
00:02:55.341 --> 00:03:00.307
Okay, you can drop useContext
as well from react up here.

33
00:03:00.307 --> 00:03:08.839
And we're going to import
useSelector from react-redux.

34
00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.362
This is a function that allows
us to get stuff out of redux.

35
00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:19.945
Okay, you can drop this
line right here on line 15.

36
00:03:19.945 --> 00:03:24.631
In fact, you can just replace it,

37
00:03:24.631 --> 00:03:29.488
const adoptedPet = useSelector.

38
00:03:29.488 --> 00:03:35.295
This you're gonna give a function
to pull data out of redux.

39
00:03:35.295 --> 00:03:39.500
So I'm gonna say give me all of
the state of my redux store.

40
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.090
But only give me back
state.adoptedPet.value.

41
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.734
And now this adoptedPet is going to be
whatever I had stored in the adoptedPet.

42
00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.146
So this function is actually
more important than just

43
00:04:03.146 --> 00:04:07.890
give me the information
that I'm looking for.

44
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.460
Obviously, it's important for that.

45
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.690
It's also a subscription to redux.

46
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.727
So when you hand this function to
Redux toolkit, it's gonna say,

47
00:04:16.727 --> 00:04:21.500
okay, I'm going to use this function now
to understand when I need to update.

48
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.850
So if this function changes.

49
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.352
So if I update my redux store and
then this adoptedPet.value changes,

50
00:04:31.352 --> 00:04:33.929
redux knows something changed.

51
00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:37.667
Therefore, I'm going to tell
searchParams it's time to re-render.

52
00:04:40.093 --> 00:04:41.080
Why is this important?

53
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.095
Why can't I just do adoptedPet or

54
00:04:47.095 --> 00:04:54.892
let's say store =
useSelector(state-state) and

55
00:04:54.892 --> 00:04:59.985
then say const adoptedPet = blah.

56
00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:13.760
This will technically work, right?

57
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.523
I'm doing the same thing,
it's gonna pull out the correct data, but

58
00:05:18.523 --> 00:05:22.240
it's gonna use this as the subscription.

59
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.715
Now if anything changes in redux ever,

60
00:05:24.715 --> 00:05:29.340
it's always going to force
searchParams to re-render.

61
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.720
That's bad because you're gonna force
a lot of unnecessary re-renders.

62
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.090
Does that make sense?

63
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.640
So this function's important is
what I'm trying to underline.

64
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.710
Please make sure that you're only pulling
out the bare minimum amount of data

65
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.270
that you absolutely need for
this particular component.

66
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.160
Do not pull out unnecessary data, okay?

67
00:05:55.901 --> 00:06:00.422
Okay, so I think now,
we should be able to go, look at our app.

68
00:06:02.652 --> 00:06:05.260
And everything should work
the same way that it did before.

69
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.246
So I'm on Luna here,
I come on here I click adopt Luna.

70
00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:15.446
And you can see here Luna
is showing up over here.

71
00:06:15.446 --> 00:06:18.827
But what's cool is this is all
coming from Redux now it's

72
00:06:18.827 --> 00:06:20.737
not coming from React context.

73
00:06:20.737 --> 00:06:25.454
It's more in direction but let's talk a
little about the testability of this now.

74
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:32.080
I can test this reducer,
I can test how this gets created.

75
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.750
I can test the action creators.

76
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.079
There's lots of steps here
now that I get to test.

77
00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:41.640
How would you test that with context?

78
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:48.340
It's possible but
it takes a lot of introspection on

79
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.570
your components to test context.

80
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.360
In other words, we don't typically test
context cuz it's such a pain to test.
