1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.770
We have our form here.

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:09.347
And these inputs are not exactly what
you would call inspiring, right?

3
00:00:09.347 --> 00:00:14.163
So it'd be great if we had some
sort of consistent styling amongst

4
00:00:14.163 --> 00:00:15.922
all of our inputs here.

5
00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:19.217
Now, we could go and
style them individually.

6
00:00:19.217 --> 00:00:24.058
You might imagine that that
would look kinda gross, right?

7
00:00:24.058 --> 00:00:25.624
So let's not do that.

8
00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:29.861
Let's lean into something
called a Tailwind plugin, so

9
00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:32.956
you can go get a consistent design style.

10
00:00:32.956 --> 00:00:37.297
So this is kinda getting more
into towards Bootstrap and and

11
00:00:37.297 --> 00:00:41.270
stuff like that that have more
of a design system feel to them.

12
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.119
You can get some of those things
with Tailwind as well via plugins.

13
00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:53.656
So go ahead and
open your terminal here and

14
00:00:53.656 --> 00:00:59.081
say npm install D, capital D that is,

15
00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:06.036
tailwindcss/forms, and we want 0.5.3,

16
00:01:06.036 --> 00:01:12.328
so @ttailwindcss/forms@0.5.3.

17
00:01:14.917 --> 00:01:19.748
Okay, then head back over
to your tailwind.config,

18
00:01:19.748 --> 00:01:24.375
and plugins here,
you're just gonna put require,

19
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:31.825
@tailwindcss/forms, like that.

20
00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:35.261
This will bring in all
the necessary stuff that we need.

21
00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:40.129
And this will allow us
to use tailwindcss/form.

22
00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:45.276
So it's actually kind of just
default styles for our form.

23
00:01:45.276 --> 00:01:50.383
So actually now if you go look and,
I need to start my server again,

24
00:01:50.383 --> 00:01:56.109
npm run dev, and refresh the page,
you can see here, getting closer, right?

25
00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:59.433
It looks bigger,
it's got a nice down arrow to it.

26
00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:01.817
We're getting closer to this looking nice.

27
00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:10.805
So head back over to your application,
go to searchParams,

28
00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:15.605
and then now we need to
do just a few things.

29
00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:19.893
So the first thing that we wanna do is
notice that our location here isn't

30
00:02:19.893 --> 00:02:21.804
getting any style whatsoever.

31
00:02:21.804 --> 00:02:26.102
That's because the way that
Tailwind CSS is doing its selectors,

32
00:02:26.102 --> 00:02:29.645
it's looking for a type and
not necessarily an input.

33
00:02:29.645 --> 00:02:32.685
So you can see here on my location,
I don't have a type on here.

34
00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:37.085
That's because if an input doesn't have
a type, it's implied a text input.

35
00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:43.579
We just need to be explicit about it,
so say type = "text".

36
00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.019
And you'll see right away,
this already gets some style.

37
00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.274
That's because I was looking for
the type = text.

38
00:02:51.978 --> 00:02:56.945
Okay, now on all of our selects and
inputs,, I want you to add this.

39
00:02:56.945 --> 00:03:01.727
I want you to add className = "width

40
00:03:01.727 --> 00:03:06.520
= 60 margin bottom-5 block".

41
00:03:09.383 --> 00:03:11.995
And you can see here,
this looks already a lot nicer.

42
00:03:11.995 --> 00:03:15.015
Go ahead and grab this className.

43
00:03:15.015 --> 00:03:20.631
Put it on the select here, and
put it on the select here.

44
00:03:24.167 --> 00:03:28.601
Already looking significantly better,
right?

45
00:03:33.428 --> 00:03:38.994
And this actually already has some nice,
grayed out styles as well.

46
00:03:41.223 --> 00:03:43.766
So actually, we don't really need
to be do much more than that.

47
00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:48.132
I'm gonna show you just so you know,
if you wanna have different styles for

48
00:03:48.132 --> 00:03:50.975
disabled, because if
you remember correctly,

49
00:03:50.975 --> 00:03:55.155
the select when you have nothing in it,
so right now, it's disabled.

50
00:03:55.155 --> 00:03:57.896
But you can kinda see, right,
it's a little grayed out.

51
00:03:57.896 --> 00:04:02.587
It's probably hard to see on that screen,
but let's just go ahead and

52
00:04:02.587 --> 00:04:05.780
make it even more obvious
that it's disabled.

53
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.072
So on the breed selector,

54
00:04:09.072 --> 00:04:14.168
you can put disabled: opacity-50.

55
00:04:14.168 --> 00:04:19.568
This will make it 50% see through,
so it look really grayed out.

56
00:04:19.568 --> 00:04:23.547
And you can see there, it looks really
grayed out now whenever it's disabled.

57
00:04:23.547 --> 00:04:27.783
If I do bird now,
you can see that now it's enabled again.

58
00:04:27.783 --> 00:04:34.318
So we saw that with hover, but that works
with disabled, it works with focus,

59
00:04:34.318 --> 00:04:41.397
it works with any one of those kinds
of modifiers that you would see in CSS.

60
00:04:41.397 --> 00:04:46.213
Okay, let's round it up by making
our button look useful here.

61
00:04:46.213 --> 00:04:50.453
So on our button, say,

62
00:04:50.453 --> 00:04:55.543
ClassName= width-60,

63
00:04:55.543 --> 00:04:59.147
sorry, wrong one,

64
00:04:59.147 --> 00:05:04.235
rounded px-6 py-2 color

65
00:05:04.235 --> 00:05:11.241
text-white hover: opacity-50,

66
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:19.214
Border-none And

67
00:05:19.214 --> 00:05:22.052
then background, orange-500.

68
00:05:28.444 --> 00:05:31.319
I need color,
trying to remember what that was for.

69
00:05:34.806 --> 00:05:35.541
I don't think so.

70
00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:38.107
All right, yeah,
you don't need that color,

71
00:05:38.107 --> 00:05:40.298
I don't know why I have that in my notes.

72
00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:47.734
Anyway, now you can see I have a nice
little orange Submit button there

73
00:05:51.318 --> 00:05:55.242
Cool, any questions about styling forms or

74
00:05:55.242 --> 00:06:00.026
disabled states or
anything like that, or plugins?

75
00:06:01.908 --> 00:06:03.872
You can make your own plugins, by the way.

76
00:06:03.872 --> 00:06:08.331
If you have your own style system and
you're sharing it amongst all various

77
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:12.519
different people, by all means,
plugins is the great way to do that.
