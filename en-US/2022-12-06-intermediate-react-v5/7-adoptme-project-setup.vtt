00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.697
We are gonna move on to Tailwind.

2
00:00:02.697 --> 00:00:05.991
Again, this is my fifth time
teaching intermediate React,

3
00:00:05.991 --> 00:00:08.583
eighth time teaching
complete intro to React.

4
00:00:08.583 --> 00:00:12.972
I have taught styled-components,
I have taught emotion,

5
00:00:12.972 --> 00:00:18.059
I've taught Tailwind, there's a bunch
of ways to do CSS with React.

6
00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:20.958
If you ask me, Brian,
how do you do CSS with React?

7
00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:25.072
It's mostly CSS modules
which is just plain CSS, but

8
00:00:25.072 --> 00:00:28.644
I'll import it into individual components.

9
00:00:28.644 --> 00:00:33.323
I quite liked that method of doing it.

10
00:00:33.323 --> 00:00:36.052
But I want you to see Tailwind
because a lot of the React

11
00:00:36.052 --> 00:00:38.490
community has kind of
moved towards Tailwind.

12
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.817
But styled components is great,
emotions is great, vanilla extract,

13
00:00:43.817 --> 00:00:48.022
there's a bunch of interesting
ways of doing CSS and JS.

14
00:00:48.022 --> 00:00:52.722
In fact, Tailwind doesn't really
have a ton to do with React itself,

15
00:00:52.722 --> 00:00:57.038
it's just very common for
the React community to use Tailwind.

16
00:00:57.038 --> 00:00:58.615
So we're gonna talk a little bit about it.

17
00:00:58.615 --> 00:01:03.558
So, Tailwind follows
this idea of Atomic CSS

18
00:01:03.558 --> 00:01:08.764
where rather than writing
CSS style-sheets,

19
00:01:08.764 --> 00:01:13.707
we're just gonna put
a lot of tiny classes and

20
00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:20.081
then the Tailwind compiler
will make this application for

21
00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:25.313
us with a very minimalistic
style sheet for us.

22
00:01:25.313 --> 00:01:29.980
So the Tailwind compiler will actually
reads all of your React code,

23
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.680
all the different ways that
you're using Tailwind and

24
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.633
then it'll generate the minimal
viable CSS style sheet.

25
00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:40.350
So your styles are always gonna be tiny.

26
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.471
The trade off here is that your CSS
classes are gonna look pretty ugly.

27
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:51.185
They even admit that in their docs,
so I'm not throwing any

28
00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:55.725
shade where they don't already
throw it at themselves.

29
00:01:55.725 --> 00:02:01.511
It's fun, I'm always torn on how much I
like Tailwind but I'll let you decide.

30
00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:05.567
Okay, so what I want you to do,

31
00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:10.559
hopefully you've cloned that Repo.

32
00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:16.679
I'm gonna grab this one here context and
I'm just gonna copy.

33
00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:22.088
I'm gonna put this just on my desktop,
paste

34
00:02:28.822 --> 00:02:34.306
And I'm gonna call this current or
something like that.

35
00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:38.603
And then I'm gonna open
this in my VS code.

36
00:02:38.603 --> 00:02:41.695
So first thing you should do on
here you should npm install just

37
00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:43.190
to get all the dependencies.

38
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.236
So npm i will get you
all your node modules.

39
00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:53.578
Looks like it had 277 packages installed.

40
00:02:53.578 --> 00:02:55.754
You might have vulnerabilities,

41
00:02:55.754 --> 00:02:59.661
I've actually locked down this
package.json pretty hard.

42
00:02:59.661 --> 00:03:03.411
So you can see here it's
all exact versions here.

43
00:03:03.411 --> 00:03:06.997
The reason being is I can only guarantee
you that all of these dependencies work

44
00:03:06.997 --> 00:03:07.551
together.

45
00:03:07.551 --> 00:03:10.720
And as these libraries update over time,
things will break.

46
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.086
They'll update things,
they'll make breaking changes,

47
00:03:14.086 --> 00:03:17.458
they'll make vulnerable changes,
things of that nature.

48
00:03:17.458 --> 00:03:21.661
So, I'm going to invite you to use
the exact same versions I'm using because

49
00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:25.425
I have tested all of these things to
make sure they all work together.

50
00:03:25.425 --> 00:03:27.757
Feel free to try and upgrade them later.

51
00:03:27.757 --> 00:03:31.282
But for now, please just stick with
me on the versions that I'm using.

52
00:03:31.282 --> 00:03:34.964
By virtue of that,
there are zero vulnerabilities today, but

53
00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:39.342
I guarantee you in my 275 packages
that are in this particular project,

54
00:03:39.342 --> 00:03:44.018
there are vulnerabilities in there
somewhere and they're going to find them.

55
00:03:44.018 --> 00:03:48.250
And if you take this class next year,
this is gonna be 100.

56
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.470
It's okay, no one's attacking your
computer right now, it's fine.

57
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.786
Just stick with me and then later you
can go upgrade it if you want to, okay.

58
00:03:58.786 --> 00:04:04.066
So if you have not taken the complete
intro to React just a bit of a tour,

59
00:04:04.066 --> 00:04:06.854
this is an Adopt Me Pet application.

60
00:04:06.854 --> 00:04:14.205
It looks just like this, it has two
routes, the homepage, the details page.

61
00:04:14.205 --> 00:04:17.996
This is all built using Vet.

62
00:04:17.996 --> 00:04:23.286
It's using React and
React query and React router,

63
00:04:23.286 --> 00:04:28.227
it has ESLint,
it has prettier that's mostly.

64
00:04:28.227 --> 00:04:31.744
If you go to the package dot-json
you can see we have a dev.

65
00:04:31.744 --> 00:04:35.126
So if I say npm run dev,

66
00:04:35.126 --> 00:04:39.933
I can go to localhost 5173.

67
00:04:39.933 --> 00:04:42.899
That's gonna open Firefox
which I did not wanna do

68
00:04:46.941 --> 00:04:50.528
I actually use Firefox most of time, but
for this class I'll use Chrome because I

69
00:04:50.528 --> 00:04:52.658
imagine most of you
are probably using Chrome.

70
00:04:55.246 --> 00:05:00.068
Okay, here we are, that's the app and

71
00:05:00.068 --> 00:05:03.440
here's our application.

72
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.803
It's a little API that is run by
the Frontend of Masters team, so

73
00:05:06.803 --> 00:05:09.247
that's where all these
pets are coming from.

74
00:05:09.247 --> 00:05:14.995
And Luna of course is my little jerk
of a dog that I love, she's very cute.
