1
00:00:00.155 --> 00:00:04.056
So the one that you might find annoying
here is we had to do our background

2
00:00:04.056 --> 00:00:05.560
directly in the style tag.

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.133
This is still CSS, right?

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:13.188
If I put a CSS class in here,
it still shows up, it's still CSS, right?

5
00:00:13.188 --> 00:00:17.553
So you can totally do that if
you find this offensive or

6
00:00:17.553 --> 00:00:22.015
I'll show you later how to use
apply to do that as well or

7
00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:25.707
you can just put it
directly in as a style tag.

8
00:00:25.707 --> 00:00:27.454
There's no problem in doing it this way.

9
00:00:27.454 --> 00:00:32.736
If you're in tailwind CSS land,
that's just kind of up to you.

10
00:00:32.736 --> 00:00:38.703
We did m-0, but
there's also as you might imagine m-1,

11
00:00:38.703 --> 00:00:43.383
right, you can see that's 4 pixels, m-2,

12
00:00:43.383 --> 00:00:47.598
8 pixels m-12, that's 48 pixels.

13
00:00:47.598 --> 00:00:50.124
This goes up to 96 looks like.

14
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:57.189
Which is 384 pixels.

15
00:00:57.189 --> 00:01:00.396
There's also -m.

16
00:01:03.956 --> 00:01:09.338
So you can go do it in a negative
direction if you need to.

17
00:01:09.338 --> 00:01:16.686
All right, so it's 1 through 12, then
it's 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40.

18
00:01:16.686 --> 00:01:21.175
So it kind of goes on like
this random sort of intervals,

19
00:01:21.175 --> 00:01:24.238
you kind of have to know what they are.

20
00:01:24.238 --> 00:01:31.511
We're also doing just margin all up,
you can also do margin right one, right?

21
00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:37.398
So this is b margin right one and
you can do margin left one, right?

22
00:01:37.398 --> 00:01:41.537
Margin bottom, margin top,
as you might imagine.

23
00:01:41.537 --> 00:01:46.352
Same thing with padding,
padding right, right?

24
00:01:46.352 --> 00:01:52.916
Padding left, padding top, padding bottom,
or just padding all together.

25
00:01:52.916 --> 00:01:57.686
Yeah, and those are intervals apply for
both margins, paddings,

26
00:01:57.686 --> 00:02:00.876
position relative, all that kind of stuff.

27
00:02:03.912 --> 00:02:05.066
Makes sense?

28
00:02:07.525 --> 00:02:08.691
All right, let's do our header here.

29
00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:10.402
So let's go to our header.

30
00:02:10.402 --> 00:02:14.024
I'm gonna give this a class name and

31
00:02:14.024 --> 00:02:18.851
this will be a bit more of a doozy depth,
width,

32
00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:23.215
and you can see all the autocomplete here.

33
00:02:23.215 --> 00:02:28.623
Okay, we're gonna do width- full

34
00:02:28.623 --> 00:02:34.933
which as you see is with 100% margin,

35
00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:41.263
bottom 10, text center, padding 7.

36
00:02:41.263 --> 00:02:47.049
Background gradient-to-b,

37
00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:54.984
so that's background gradient to bottom.

38
00:02:54.984 --> 00:03:03.612
from-yellow-400 via-orange-500,

39
00:03:03.612 --> 00:03:07.820
to-red-500, and

40
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.027
you can see that totally

41
00:03:12.027 --> 00:03:17.926
reorganized everything for me.

42
00:03:17.926 --> 00:03:21.986
So margin bottom 10, width 100%,

43
00:03:21.986 --> 00:03:26.279
background gradient, from top to bottom,

44
00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:33.600
start my gradients at yellow 400
which colors go from 100 to 900.

45
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.906
So, 400 is like a middle yellow, right?

46
00:03:37.906 --> 00:03:43.814
via-orange-500, so
that's means that there's a stop

47
00:03:43.814 --> 00:03:50.301
in the middle at orange 500 and
then it goes down to red-500.

48
00:03:50.301 --> 00:03:53.311
For the gradient, padding 7,

49
00:03:53.311 --> 00:03:59.230
sets a padding of 1.75 root ends and
then text is centered.

50
00:04:04.262 --> 00:04:07.264
So, now you're starting
to get a real taste

51
00:04:07.264 --> 00:04:10.033
of what tailwind CSS classes look like.

52
00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:14.244
So if you refresh this, what are we
gonna expect to see on Adopt Me?

53
00:04:15.866 --> 00:04:18.005
Nothing, cuz you have to run your server.

54
00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:19.458
npm run dev.

55
00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:25.147
Refresh the page.

56
00:04:34.851 --> 00:04:36.220
Content option.

57
00:04:43.162 --> 00:04:48.744
Yeah, I needed to fix that there.

58
00:04:48.744 --> 00:04:50.928
Yeah, okay?

59
00:04:50.928 --> 00:04:56.437
One crucial thing that we missed here, we
have to tell it where to look for our CSS.

60
00:04:59.585 --> 00:05:05.591
So you have to put just
here ./src /** /*.,

61
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:11.178
and then here you need to
tell it where to look for

62
00:05:11.178 --> 00:05:15.519
your files, for your source files.

63
00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:20.366
js, ts, jsx, tsx, html,
this kind of covers

64
00:05:20.366 --> 00:05:24.733
all of our bases of where
all of our files and

65
00:05:24.733 --> 00:05:28.997
what kind of file extensions to look for.

66
00:05:32.115 --> 00:05:36.740
If you don't anticipate doing TypeScript,
you can leave off the ts and the tsx but

67
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.167
you do need the js, and jsx, and the html.

68
00:05:40.315 --> 00:05:45.658
Okay, now you can see what we have here.

69
00:05:51.258 --> 00:05:55.033
So what I like about this is now
if I come back to my app.jsx,

70
00:05:55.033 --> 00:05:59.336
let's say I'm not super in orange
right now, it's really easy for

71
00:05:59.336 --> 00:06:03.436
me to just come in here and
say blue, it's gonna look terrible.

72
00:06:03.436 --> 00:06:06.972
But it's kind of easy to do, like start
messing around with stuff, it's very

73
00:06:06.972 --> 00:06:10.928
productive to just kind of toy around
with things and see where they end up.

74
00:06:10.928 --> 00:06:14.449
It's very fluent, I find that I'm able
to kind of think of CSS styles and

75
00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:18.283
expressiveness classes really quickly
without having to hop between files.

76
00:06:24.933 --> 00:06:27.098
Okay, so coming here to the link,

77
00:06:27.098 --> 00:06:30.689
we're gonna give the link some
class names here as well.

78
00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:32.900
Let's give this a text.

79
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.444
We want it to be really big,

80
00:06:36.444 --> 00:06:41.378
so I'm gonna do 6xl, text-white,

81
00:06:41.378 --> 00:06:45.551
hover:text-gray-200.

82
00:06:45.551 --> 00:06:49.055
So this is how you do different states.

83
00:06:49.055 --> 00:06:53.955
So we wanted to have like a hover state
that whenever you hover over the word,

84
00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:56.034
it's gonna turn a little gray.

85
00:06:58.605 --> 00:07:02.782
Ttext-6xl, it's gonna be 60 pixels big,
and

86
00:07:02.782 --> 00:07:07.358
then the color of the text is
gonna be straight up white.

87
00:07:07.358 --> 00:07:10.566
Okay, refresh the page, and there you go,

88
00:07:10.566 --> 00:07:14.315
you can see it has a nice
little hover state as well.

89
00:07:14.315 --> 00:07:15.162
There you go.

90
00:07:23.117 --> 00:07:28.216
Just a note here on link particularly
with regards to React Router Dom, it

91
00:07:28.216 --> 00:07:33.823
passes whatever you put here as class name
directly on to the a tag underneath it.

92
00:07:33.823 --> 00:07:37.998
So nothing too surprising there.

93
00:07:37.998 --> 00:07:41.783
Let's pop over to searchresults.jsx.

94
00:07:45.587 --> 00:07:47.747
Sorry, SearchParams.jsx, yeah.

95
00:07:53.095 --> 00:07:58.678
And here on this,
you can delete this search-params

96
00:07:58.678 --> 00:08:02.649
class here and we're gonna put my, so

97
00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:07.999
that's gonna be margin,
top and bottom, right?

98
00:08:07.999 --> 00:08:13.770
So my-0, so the margin-top 0,
margin-bottom as in like the y-axis,

99
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.851
right, that's where the y comes from.

100
00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:21.163
As you might imagine,
if you wanna do just left and right,

101
00:08:21.163 --> 00:08:25.925
you could do mx, that'd be left and
right, margin 0, right?

102
00:08:25.925 --> 00:08:31.856
So my-0zero, mx-auto, and then widths,

103
00:08:31.856 --> 00:08:37.330
we wanted to take 11/12 for the page,

104
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.446
so most of the page 11/12.

105
00:08:41.446 --> 00:08:43.174
So that's gonna be 91%.

106
00:08:43.174 --> 00:08:47.950
So I think for the most part, tailwind
divides the page into 12 columns, right,

107
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:51.171
and you're telling it to
take 11 of the 12 columns.

108
00:08:54.147 --> 00:08:57.496
Okay, here on the form,

109
00:08:57.496 --> 00:09:03.243
we're gonna say class name equals P10.

110
00:09:03.243 --> 00:09:08.659
So padding 10, margin bottom 10,
rounded large,

111
00:09:08.659 --> 00:09:15.114
like very rounded,
background-gray-200, shadow large,

112
00:09:15.114 --> 00:09:20.084
we want to like the large,
was that a drop shadows?

113
00:09:20.084 --> 00:09:27.538
I think it's just a normal box shadow
that's what I was looking for.

114
00:09:29.066 --> 00:09:30.364
Let's see.

115
00:09:30.364 --> 00:09:35.956
Display flex, flex-columns justify

116
00:09:35.956 --> 00:09:40.366
center, and items-center.

117
00:09:43.933 --> 00:09:48.329
So, this is doing display
flex like flexbox, right?

118
00:09:48.329 --> 00:09:52.169
We're doing it into columns,
we don't want the items to be centered,

119
00:09:52.169 --> 00:09:54.218
so this is a line item center, right?

120
00:09:54.218 --> 00:09:57.996
Yeah, this is justify-content-center.

121
00:09:57.996 --> 00:10:03.283
We want rounded border radius,
background color of gray,

122
00:10:03.283 --> 00:10:07.627
padding 10, and
then a good sized box shadow.

123
00:10:07.627 --> 00:10:08.228
There you go.

124
00:10:08.228 --> 00:10:10.211
That's what that turns into right there.

125
00:10:14.345 --> 00:10:19.154
So hopefully, you're seeing that I'm
being pretty productive pretty quickly

126
00:10:19.154 --> 00:10:20.435
here with tailwind.

127
00:10:20.435 --> 00:10:21.757
This is what tailwind buys you.

128
00:10:21.757 --> 00:10:25.676
If this is appealing to you, you're
starting to get why tailwind is useful.

129
00:10:25.676 --> 00:10:28.497
If you're sitting there thinking
like this still isn't worth it,

130
00:10:28.497 --> 00:10:31.379
then I'm probably not gonna sell you
on this too much more than that.

131
00:10:31.379 --> 00:10:34.460
But I want you to know that
this things out there,

132
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.854
undeniably, you can code
very quickly in Tailwind.

133
00:10:37.854 --> 00:10:39.435
Does anyone have any questions about this?

134
00:10:39.435 --> 00:10:44.472
I've kind of shown you for the most part
what it feels like writing Tailwind.

135
00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:51.871
That's more of this.

136
00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:56.605
And you might be sitting here thinking
how do I know all the names of this?

137
00:10:56.605 --> 00:10:59.988
Well, one but
that talent IntelliSense, right,

138
00:10:59.988 --> 00:11:03.063
you can just say like how
do I do like flex grow?

139
00:11:03.063 --> 00:11:06.712
I legitimately off the top my head
do not know how to do flex grow,

140
00:11:06.712 --> 00:11:08.613
I just start typing flex-grow.

141
00:11:08.613 --> 00:11:10.506
And it just shows up, right?

142
00:11:10.506 --> 00:11:14.362
So one, I'm usually pretty close
to guessing, and between that and

143
00:11:14.362 --> 00:11:18.296
the intel sense, I can usually guess
all the CSS things that I need to.

144
00:11:18.296 --> 00:11:21.608
Beyond that, their docs are great,
so just go check out the docs.

145
00:11:21.608 --> 00:11:25.191
But yeah, for the most part, most of
these things you either use them so

146
00:11:25.191 --> 00:11:28.715
much like margins, and paddings,
and text sizes, and text colors,

147
00:11:28.715 --> 00:11:32.263
and things like that, you just remember
them off the top of your head.

148
00:11:32.263 --> 00:11:37.138
And the ones that you don't, you can
either find quickly or find on the doc.
