00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.654
Just to kind of give you
some more examples here,

2
00:00:03.654 --> 00:00:08.460
let's go put location, animal,
and breed into Redux toolkit.

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.068
I probably wouldn't typically do this,
because this is only used here.

4
00:00:12.068 --> 00:00:17.084
But the nice thing about this is
it's going to allow us to keep track

5
00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:22.927
of all the stuff across page loads,
which is going to be minorly useful to us.

6
00:00:22.927 --> 00:00:28.240
So make a new file here,

7
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.952
call it SearchParamsSlice.js.

8
00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:40.984
And import {createSlice}

9
00:00:40.984 --> 00:00:47.066
again from @reduxjs/toolkit.

10
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:54.871
Export const searchParamsSlice,

11
00:00:56.981 --> 00:00:58.924
= createSlice

12
00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:09.235
Okay, so you don't really need to
export that part, so just leave that.

13
00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:15.506
searchParamsSlice, And
you're gonna say createSlice.

14
00:01:15.506 --> 00:01:18.720
Yeah, that's good.

15
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.960
Name: "searchParams",

16
00:01:25.404 --> 00:01:28.867
initialState.

17
00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:35.284
You leave a location of empty string,
a breed of empty string,

18
00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:46.036
And animal of empty string, cool.

19
00:01:46.036 --> 00:01:51.726
Reducers, All right, so I'm just gonna

20
00:01:51.726 --> 00:01:55.782
make one reducer at the moment called all,
which is just gonna replace everything.

21
00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:59.350
So I'm gonna say (state, action).

22
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.215
And all this does is,
is gonna say state.value = action.payload.

23
00:02:04.215 --> 00:02:08.593
Cuz for our particular application, we
don't have an occasion where we're setting

24
00:02:08.593 --> 00:02:10.861
anything other than all
of them all at once.

25
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:15.756
But hopefully, you can imagine,
I could have one set be updateLocation or

26
00:02:15.756 --> 00:02:20.495
something like that, and all that we
do is set just the location, one for

27
00:02:20.495 --> 00:02:24.869
setting just the breed, one for
setting just the animal, right?

28
00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:28.917
That's all stuff you could do here, but
for now, all we need is an all one.

29
00:02:30.893 --> 00:02:36.569
Okay, and then down here,
we're gonna say export

30
00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.122
const (all) = searchParamsSlice.actions.

31
00:02:42.122 --> 00:02:51.019
And then export default
searchParamsSlice.reducer.

32
00:02:54.841 --> 00:03:02.186
You are mad about, yeah, I don't need a,
I need an arrow function there rather.

33
00:03:04.743 --> 00:03:06.220
Okay, there we go.

34
00:03:08.567 --> 00:03:11.767
This basically looks almost identical
to our previous one other than we have

35
00:03:11.767 --> 00:03:14.517
a little bit more initialState,
otherwise, it looks identical

36
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:23.905
Okay, great, let's go to store.js.

37
00:03:23.905 --> 00:03:29.527
We're gonna import searchParams here,

38
00:03:29.527 --> 00:03:33.865
import searchParamsSlice from

39
00:03:33.865 --> 00:03:38.854
"./searchParamsSlice, okay?

40
00:03:38.854 --> 00:03:42.000
That's pretty easy, that's all set up now.

41
00:03:44.652 --> 00:03:48.681
Let's go to searchParams.jsx.

42
00:03:48.681 --> 00:03:52.537
Here, we're going to import at the top.

43
00:03:52.537 --> 00:03:54.531
There's a useSelector here.

44
00:03:54.531 --> 00:04:00.164
We're also gonna import
a useDispatch up here, useDispatch.

45
00:04:00.164 --> 00:04:04.694
And we're going to import(all) from

46
00:04:04.694 --> 00:04:09.228
"./searchParamsSlice' as well.

47
00:04:11.842 --> 00:04:16.852
Okay, up here with your hooks,
we're gonna have a dispatch.

48
00:04:16.852 --> 00:04:24.666
So const dispatch = useDispatch to
get that dispatch function back.

49
00:04:24.666 --> 00:04:29.650
Const adoptedPet, we did that already.

50
00:04:32.315 --> 00:04:33.824
So that's there.

51
00:04:33.824 --> 00:04:37.825
And then we are gonna also
have our requestParams.

52
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.055
So const requestParams
is going to be assigned,

53
00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:55.014
useSelector state,

54
00:04:56.776 --> 00:05:04.405
state.searchParams.value.

55
00:05:04.405 --> 00:05:07.165
And then I can drop all
of this stuff up here.

56
00:05:11.922 --> 00:05:13.916
So you don't need any of that.

57
00:05:13.916 --> 00:05:17.814
Cool, and then down here,
instead of saying setRequestParams,

58
00:05:17.814 --> 00:05:26.350
we're just gonna say, dispatch,
Wrap this in an auth.

59
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.573
There you go.

60
00:05:28.573 --> 00:05:32.786
So let's go back over here and
look at this.

61
00:05:32.786 --> 00:05:36.765
So under All XH, or just All,
let's see what happens here.

62
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.950
This is a fetch, so it's just not
requesting anything, interesting.

63
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.322
&gt;&gt; The requestParams is
different in the lesson plan.

64
00:05:50.322 --> 00:05:53.469
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean,
I think I called it searchParams, right?

65
00:05:56.396 --> 00:05:59.334
And that's fine, as long as you
change this to be the same thing.

66
00:06:09.258 --> 00:06:15.237
Cannot destructure query animal of query
1, that seems like it's a problem.

67
00:06:15.237 --> 00:06:19.288
If we go back to our fetch,
or our searchParams here,

68
00:06:19.288 --> 00:06:22.358
initialState, this has to be in value.

69
00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:31.899
Lo and behold, here we are.

70
00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:33.547
That was it.

71
00:06:33.547 --> 00:06:37.256
So here when I was setting
up searchParamsSlice,

72
00:06:37.256 --> 00:06:40.181
this has to be inside of value, right?

73
00:06:40.181 --> 00:06:42.971
Cuz I'm saying state.value
= action.payload.

74
00:06:42.971 --> 00:06:45.823
That makes sense it wasn't working
until I actually said state.value =

75
00:06:45.823 --> 00:06:46.608
action.payload.

76
00:06:46.608 --> 00:06:49.835
That makes sense of why that was only
working after I clicked on it, right?
