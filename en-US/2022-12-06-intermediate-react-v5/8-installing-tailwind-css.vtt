1
00:00:00.281 --> 00:00:02.752
So I'm going to need you to install.

2
00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:10.525
Npm install -D

3
00:00:10.525 --> 00:00:19.053
tailwind-css@ 3.1.8

4
00:00:19.053 --> 00:00:27.240
postcss@8.4.18 and

5
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:37.477
autoprefixer@10.4.12.

6
00:00:37.477 --> 00:00:40.435
You can also just copy this
directly from my notes, so

7
00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:42.689
you don't have to type it word for word.

8
00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:48.114
So, tailwind is exactly
what it's described to you.

9
00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:54.346
It's the compiler that will actually
make you that minimum viable stylesheet.

10
00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:59.917
Postcss is basically like Babel for CSS,
where it like takes one set of CSS and

11
00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:03.101
transforms it into
a different kind of CSS.

12
00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:06.806
It is just a transpiler for CSS.

13
00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:10.165
And then autoprefixer is
exactly what it sounds like,

14
00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:14.778
it basically trans-piles, modern CSS
to CSS that works in all browsers.

15
00:01:14.778 --> 00:01:16.635
That's what autoprefixer does.

16
00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:23.012
They make you version those independently
because that way postcss and autoprefixer

17
00:01:23.012 --> 00:01:27.588
can release new things, and you don't
have to update necessarily tailwind, and

18
00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:30.658
they don't have to track
that as a dependency either.

19
00:01:30.658 --> 00:01:34.922
It allows you to maintain
control of your app

20
00:01:34.922 --> 00:01:39.887
regardless of how often tailwind updates,
okay?

21
00:01:39.887 --> 00:01:41.348
So now, we have this.

22
00:01:41.348 --> 00:01:45.980
Now we need to start a tailwind project,
so

23
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.009
I'm going to say here
down in my terminal MPX.

24
00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:51.771
What is it?

25
00:01:51.771 --> 00:02:01.592
Tailwindcss, Init -p.

26
00:02:04.901 --> 00:02:12.201
Okay, you'll see that this generates
two files for us, postcss and tailwind.

27
00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:14.724
You can pretty well just ignore this.

28
00:02:14.724 --> 00:02:16.971
Like this is just saying
this is a Tailwind project.

29
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:19.257
This is an autoprefixer project.

30
00:02:19.257 --> 00:02:20.505
We will not touch this again.

31
00:02:20.505 --> 00:02:24.181
But if you have any additional
configurations that you want for postcss,

32
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:26.679
that would go here, and
that's what the -P did.

33
00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:30.517
The -P also made it so
that it generated the postcss for

34
00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:34.198
us in addition to the tailwind config for
us as well.

35
00:02:34.198 --> 00:02:39.891
&gt;&gt; How does Tailwind differ from
libraries like Bootstrap or Chakra UI?

36
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:41.987
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

37
00:02:41.987 --> 00:02:44.117
So I am less familiar with Chakra, but

38
00:02:44.117 --> 00:02:48.259
I can talk to at least speak to
bootstrap it's different than Bootstrap.

39
00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:49.862
Bootstrap is a full design system, right?

40
00:02:49.862 --> 00:02:53.395
If you build something with Bootstrap it
looks like a Bootstrap website which is

41
00:02:53.395 --> 00:02:54.510
totally valid, right?

42
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.607
Like if you're building like internal web
apps where you don't really care that how

43
00:02:58.607 --> 00:03:00.749
it looks as long as it looks usable and
nice.

44
00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:05.678
Something like bootstrap or
material would be another good one.

45
00:03:05.678 --> 00:03:09.867
Those like pre-made design
systems work amazingly for that.

46
00:03:09.867 --> 00:03:11.150
Tailwind is not that.

47
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.483
Tailwind, it's not a design system.

48
00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:14.845
It's a methodology for writing CSS.

49
00:03:14.845 --> 00:03:17.714
So Tailwind's not gonna define
how your website looks,

50
00:03:17.714 --> 00:03:19.874
it's gonna define how you write your CSS.

51
00:03:19.874 --> 00:03:23.619
So you can build design systems
on top of Tailwind CSS, but

52
00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:27.684
it has no opinions of how your
app is necessarily going to look.

53
00:03:29.177 --> 00:03:33.876
So instead of writing CSS,
you're writing Tailwind, whereas with like

54
00:03:33.876 --> 00:03:38.803
something like Bootstrap, you're just
putting CSS classes on things, and

55
00:03:38.803 --> 00:03:42.242
it comes with like a premade
CSS bundle for you to use.

56
00:03:42.242 --> 00:03:46.231
It's a CSS framework in that capacity.

57
00:03:46.231 --> 00:03:49.778
That make sense?

58
00:03:49.778 --> 00:03:52.132
Cool.

59
00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:55.695
I imagine chakras the same,
similar anyway, but I again.

60
00:03:55.695 --> 00:03:57.316
&gt;&gt; Component library?

61
00:03:57.316 --> 00:04:00.497
&gt;&gt; Like material or
something like that okay, so

62
00:04:00.497 --> 00:04:03.037
Chakra would be the same thing cool.

63
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:12.248
Okay, so we end up with this for
our tailwind config.

64
00:04:12.248 --> 00:04:17.005
This little comment here is nice, actually
gives us the type so that if we start

65
00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:21.708
typing something in here, it'll actually
give you like the autocomplete.

66
00:04:21.708 --> 00:04:25.546
That's what this special comment
up here is for, it's for

67
00:04:25.546 --> 00:04:28.708
VS Code to be able to
autocomplete things for us.

68
00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:38.903
Okay, so
go to your style.css here in source.

69
00:04:40.215 --> 00:04:45.616
Take all this very hard-earned
CSS that I wrote for you.

70
00:04:45.616 --> 00:04:47.122
350 lines of it.

71
00:04:47.122 --> 00:04:48.466
Wow, that's more than I thought.

72
00:04:50.067 --> 00:04:50.689
Delete it.

73
00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:52.270
Just delete all of it.

74
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.797
Fine, I'll be okay, just kidding,
it's not good CSS, that's fine.

75
00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:03.442
We're gonna write tailwind @tailwind

76
00:05:03.442 --> 00:05:09.259
components and add tailwind utilities.

77
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.456
This is all of the CSS that we're
going to have in our projects.

78
00:05:17.456 --> 00:05:20.358
Everything else is going to be
written directly into the DOM.

79
00:05:20.358 --> 00:05:27.187
Some of you might be annoyed that
VS Code is complaining about this.

80
00:05:27.187 --> 00:05:30.787
If you want to get rid of this,

81
00:05:30.787 --> 00:05:35.110
open your settings and let's see.

82
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.584
Actually do open user settings,

83
00:05:41.584 --> 00:05:45.041
this one here in JSON.

84
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:49.248
And then what you're looking for
is you just wanna put a rule in here for.

85
00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:54.581
What is it?

86
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:59.242
Css.lint.unknownAtRules, and

87
00:05:59.242 --> 00:06:03.441
you can just put that to ignore.

88
00:06:05.595 --> 00:06:10.416
So again, I'd Shift+Command+P or
Control+Shift+P Do preferences,

89
00:06:10.416 --> 00:06:15.233
open user, User Settings JSON,
this one here, that'll open this file and

90
00:06:15.233 --> 00:06:17.289
just put a line in here for this.

91
00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:21.650
And then, you will no longer have
this complaining at you about that.

92
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.649
I don't really care.

93
00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:28.815
So what, however you want to do,
this is just, like underlining a noisy.

94
00:06:32.072 --> 00:06:38.349
Okay, the other thing I'm going to invite
you to do if you're using VS Code,

95
00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:42.802
there is an extension for
Tailwind CSS IntelliSense.

96
00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:45.475
This, go ahead and install that.

97
00:06:45.475 --> 00:06:47.147
It's just very useful for

98
00:06:47.147 --> 00:06:52.482
when you are doing a tailwind because it
will start auto completing things for you.

99
00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:01.525
Okay, that should be, we should be
ready to go now any questions so

100
00:07:01.525 --> 00:07:04.374
far about setting up tailwind?

101
00:07:04.374 --> 00:07:05.787
If we run our project now,

102
00:07:05.787 --> 00:07:09.203
it's going to look very ugly
because there's gonna be no CSS.

103
00:07:13.608 --> 00:07:20.169
Yea, see it's just pictures of Luna and
text, but there's no style on anything.

104
00:07:24.056 --> 00:07:26.723
So let's start writing some talent.

105
00:07:31.531 --> 00:07:34.038
So let's go to App.jsx.

106
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:45.799
And, This first div right here.

107
00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:57.002
Yeah, this one right here give it a class

108
00:07:57.002 --> 00:08:01.284
name equal to P-0 and m-0.

109
00:08:07.744 --> 00:08:13.530
And then, we're gonna give it
a style of equal to background.

110
00:08:16.999 --> 00:08:22.110
And we'll give it a URL

111
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:31.371
of
http://pets-images.dev-apis.com/pets/wall-

112
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:37.988
paper.

113
00:08:37.988 --> 00:08:43.154
You can do A, B or
C all of those will work.

114
00:08:43.154 --> 00:08:48.718
So you should end up
with something like that,

115
00:08:48.718 --> 00:08:51.862
and okay, so far so good.

116
00:08:51.862 --> 00:08:54.165
So, a couple of things here.

117
00:08:54.165 --> 00:08:57.393
What are these class names?

118
00:08:57.393 --> 00:09:01.710
Well, again, Tailwind is atomic CSS.

119
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:06.403
We're putting just the bare minimum amount
of CSS, and we're going to be using just

120
00:09:06.403 --> 00:09:09.591
classes to represent the CSS
that we would want to write.

121
00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:13.077
So if you actually mouse
over this inner using

122
00:09:13.077 --> 00:09:18.029
that IntelliSense VS Code extension
that I told you to install,

123
00:09:18.029 --> 00:09:22.354
you'll see that p0 represents
padding p00 pixels.

124
00:09:22.354 --> 00:09:28.071
You can probably guess what m.0
is gonna be then margin 0, right?

125
00:09:28.071 --> 00:09:33.062
So this is saying I want on my
body of my application here

126
00:09:33.062 --> 00:09:36.000
I want no padding and no margin.

127
00:09:39.483 --> 00:09:42.442
This welcome to Tailwind CSS,
that's what this is,

128
00:09:42.442 --> 00:09:46.609
it's just putting in utility classes for
all the CSS that you wanna write.

129
00:09:48.256 --> 00:09:53.067
I'm sure right now you're either
thinking this is great or this is awful.

130
00:09:53.067 --> 00:09:57.037
There's really,
very rarely much in between.

131
00:09:57.037 --> 00:10:00.920
So let me just say that on one hand,
this is so fast to write,

132
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.743
I don't have to switch between CSS files.

133
00:10:03.743 --> 00:10:06.348
I can just put stuff on
the go as I'm going.

134
00:10:06.348 --> 00:10:09.593
It's very fast to like
prototype stuff really quickly.

135
00:10:09.593 --> 00:10:11.314
So I use tailwind all the time.

136
00:10:11.314 --> 00:10:15.097
When I just need to like get something
done and out the door as fast as I can,

137
00:10:15.097 --> 00:10:17.497
Tailwind is great for
just being really fast.

138
00:10:17.497 --> 00:10:21.974
You can imagine some of these class
names get long and gross, right?

139
00:10:21.974 --> 00:10:25.975
You'll start having like 30
class names on one component.

140
00:10:25.975 --> 00:10:28.741
It's a little weird, right?

141
00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:30.412
You're gonna have to decide
what you think about that.

142
00:10:30.412 --> 00:10:32.006
I'm gonna invite you to try it.

143
00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:34.693
I'm gonna say if you're
really grossed out right now,

144
00:10:34.693 --> 00:10:36.821
it's probably better than you think it is.

145
00:10:36.821 --> 00:10:39.513
So just stick with me.

146
00:10:39.513 --> 00:10:43.414
Questions so
far before we get more in depth on this?

147
00:10:43.414 --> 00:10:44.179
Yeah.

148
00:10:44.179 --> 00:10:49.722
&gt;&gt; Do you recommend the Tailwind
prettier plugin also?

149
00:10:49.722 --> 00:10:54.743
I've never used it, but
that sounds like a lovely thing,

150
00:10:54.743 --> 00:11:01.746
that seems like a great idea so like it'll
sort your classes for you automatically.

151
00:11:10.096 --> 00:11:13.962
Yeah, that's awesome, all right?

152
00:11:13.962 --> 00:11:18.327
Let's see what happens, I have no idea
what happens if we install this directly.

153
00:11:21.567 --> 00:11:24.781
So Tailwind or npm install -D.

154
00:11:24.781 --> 00:11:26.099
We already have prettier on this project.

155
00:11:26.099 --> 00:11:29.504
Let's do prettier plugin, tailwindcss.

156
00:11:31.022 --> 00:11:31.770
Okay.

157
00:11:34.754 --> 00:11:39.974
So rather than you'd have, it looks like
you have to replace your prettier RC with.

158
00:11:42.331 --> 00:11:47.855
JS file, I want you to call that

159
00:11:47.855 --> 00:11:52.957
JS file prettier config.js

160
00:11:58.184 --> 00:12:01.279
All right, try that now.

161
00:12:08.493 --> 00:12:10.265
That works.

162
00:12:10.265 --> 00:12:12.945
Okay.

163
00:12:12.945 --> 00:12:17.877
So to sum up,
do npm install dash capital D prettier

164
00:12:17.877 --> 00:12:21.675
dash plugin, tailwindcss like that?

165
00:12:21.675 --> 00:12:26.847
I am currently on version 1013.

166
00:12:26.847 --> 00:12:31.963
If that's something's not working for you,
try installing specifically that version.

00:12:31.963 --> 00:12:36.196
Have a dot prettier RC file, you'll have
to delete that dot prettier RC file and

168
00:12:36.196 --> 00:12:40.368
replace it with a prettier dot config.js
because it's going to require you to

169
00:12:40.368 --> 00:12:41.462
import something.

170
00:12:41.462 --> 00:12:43.992
And then just put this in there,

171
00:12:43.992 --> 00:12:50.096
module dot exports equals plugins
require prettier plugin, tailwindcss.

172
00:12:50.096 --> 00:12:52.473
Once you've done that.

173
00:12:52.473 --> 00:12:57.185
Now for example if I do m.0 here
P0 because it has a certain order

174
00:12:57.185 --> 00:12:59.510
that expects things to come in.

175
00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:04.415
Notice as soon as I click save it
reorganizes though into some sort

176
00:13:04.415 --> 00:13:09.061
of ascending or like some sort
of predictable order, right?

177
00:13:09.061 --> 00:13:14.831
So thank you to friendly user
online that told me to do that.
