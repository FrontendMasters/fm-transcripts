00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.231
I would say what we've done here is fine,
especially with this like,

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:05.960
margin bottom block w 60.

3
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.574
I know we've repeated
ourselves three times, but

4
00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:11.509
we're not repeating ourselves
anywhere else, right?

5
00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:17.007
But I know still some people are gonna
take offense to like I repeated myself too

6
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:17.624
many times.

7
00:00:17.624 --> 00:00:22.618
I would like some sort of reusable class,
maybe if I had some sort of

8
00:00:22.618 --> 00:00:27.449
cascading style sheet of some
variety that I could use, right?

9
00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.462
The temptation I know that you're gonna
wanna do here is to go write CSS and

10
00:00:30.462 --> 00:00:31.543
just put it here, right?

11
00:00:31.543 --> 00:00:36.792
You could absolutely just
head into your style.CSS,

12
00:00:36.792 --> 00:00:41.585
write my-input blah,
put that stuff in there and

13
00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:44.679
drop it in your code, it works.

14
00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.236
Tailwind is not gonna
prevent you from doing that.

15
00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:53.810
But at some point you're just writing
CSS again, why are you using Tailwind?

16
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.633
Just go back to using CSS if
that's really what you want.

17
00:00:57.633 --> 00:00:59.036
That being said,

18
00:00:59.036 --> 00:01:04.942
I'm gonna show you how to add layers
where sometimes this does make sense.

19
00:01:04.942 --> 00:01:07.482
And a good example of this would be like,

20
00:01:07.482 --> 00:01:12.429
let's say I have a huge website that has
many forms, and I have lots of inputs.

21
00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:15.982
It might make sense for you to have some
sort of layer that you can apply, right?

22
00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:18.331
Some layer class.

23
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:21.380
So let me show you how to do that.

24
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.753
Tailwind has these three
layers it worries about.

25
00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:30.286
The base layer, the base layer,
you can think of like your CSS reset.

26
00:01:30.286 --> 00:01:36.521
It's just basically like, the body has
this, the ordered list has by default,

27
00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:42.401
these kind of bullets, has this kind
of text and it's very like base level.

28
00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:46.184
Setting kind of like the base
layer of your application.

29
00:01:46.184 --> 00:01:50.927
The component layer is supposed to
be things like I have this kind of

30
00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:53.891
special form, I have this kind of title,

31
00:01:53.891 --> 00:01:58.992
it's very much oriented towards
the components in your application.

32
00:01:58.992 --> 00:02:04.198
I have this kind of dog component.

33
00:02:04.198 --> 00:02:08.374
Kind of match up with like your react
components to be honest with you.

34
00:02:08.374 --> 00:02:11.573
And then you have utilities,
like is this the active one,

35
00:02:11.573 --> 00:02:13.087
is this the not active one?

36
00:02:13.087 --> 00:02:17.689
And so you can kind of think of it that
utility ones will be the most specific

37
00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.673
ones, then components and
then base, right?

38
00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:26.910
So, utilities will override components and
components will override base.

39
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.636
So you can think of them
kind of like specificity.

40
00:02:30.636 --> 00:02:34.730
Utilities are more specific components or
less specific and

41
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.743
base are the least specific.

42
00:02:36.743 --> 00:02:40.268
So, in other words, if something is
conflicting between utilities and

43
00:02:40.268 --> 00:02:41.846
components, utilities wins.

44
00:02:41.846 --> 00:02:46.438
If something conflicts between
components and base, components wins.

45
00:02:47.854 --> 00:02:52.295
So, the first thing we wanna do is
we wanna make our own search input.

46
00:02:52.295 --> 00:03:00.061
So we're gonna say layer
components .search-input,

47
00:03:00.061 --> 00:03:04.590
and then we're gonna do add apply

48
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.780
width 60 margin-bottom 5 block.

49
00:03:13.294 --> 00:03:20.181
So this add apply allows us to do Tailwind
stuff directly in our style sheets.

50
00:03:20.181 --> 00:03:24.594
This makes sense to me if you're in
Tailwind, stay in Tailwind, right?

51
00:03:24.594 --> 00:03:28.716
Could you absolutely say width 60% or
whatever?

52
00:03:28.716 --> 00:03:32.985
Yes, absolutely,
that's gonna work but don't.

53
00:03:34.804 --> 00:03:41.635
Context switching will just destroy
your productivity in my opinion.

54
00:03:41.635 --> 00:03:48.226
So then we want like a grayed out Disable.

55
00:03:49.718 --> 00:03:50.806
There you go.

56
00:03:50.806 --> 00:03:56.361
Add apply Disabled opacity 50.

57
00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:02.829
Okay, now we have these two utility
classes that we can use directly in our

58
00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.055
search params here.

59
00:04:04.055 --> 00:04:08.149
So instead of having this class name here,
I can have,

60
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:10.822
as you might imagine search input.

61
00:04:12.546 --> 00:04:14.108
Here, I can get rid of this.

62
00:04:14.108 --> 00:04:21.139
This is gonna be search-input and
grayed-out-disable.

63
00:04:24.278 --> 00:04:27.579
And same thing up here,
I can have search input.

64
00:04:32.421 --> 00:04:37.209
And now everything still works
the same but I have these utility

65
00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:42.005
classes that are using Tailwind,
that is what layers are for.

66
00:04:46.455 --> 00:04:51.576
By the same token if you had base things

67
00:04:51.576 --> 00:04:57.017
that you wanna do let's say I have base,

68
00:04:57.017 --> 00:05:01.032
then I wanted my font family,

69
00:05:05.148 --> 00:05:10.698
Comic Sans Ms,
it's not gonna work I have no idea

70
00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:24.888
Anyway, that's where you do
all that kind of stuff there,

71
00:05:24.888 --> 00:05:27.444
would be in the base layer, right?

72
00:05:27.444 --> 00:05:35.036
Rather layer base, There we go.

73
00:05:36.823 --> 00:05:39.835
Now this is so much more adorable
that everything is in Comic Sans.

74
00:05:42.524 --> 00:05:45.296
But to prove my point here,

75
00:05:45.296 --> 00:05:50.477
if you wanted the font
family to be different here,

76
00:05:50.477 --> 00:05:56.518
you can put it here and
say this is, I don't know, impact.

77
00:05:59.441 --> 00:06:05.459
So now you can see inside of here,
There's a conflict between base and

78
00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:08.517
components, but components wins
because component is more specific.

79
00:06:13.024 --> 00:06:14.556
Okay, any questions?

80
00:06:20.416 --> 00:06:21.466
All right.

81
00:06:29.463 --> 00:06:32.649
So again, just to reiterate.

82
00:06:34.368 --> 00:06:39.280
We are using Tailwind, the point of using
Tailwind is very fast to prototype and

83
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.375
you can just go ahead and
put all those classes in.

84
00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:46.763
If I was using Tailwind in a project,
would not have abstract this into a search

85
00:06:46.763 --> 00:06:50.568
input, I would have just left those
classes like I had them before.

86
00:06:50.568 --> 00:06:55.007
I would only abstract this out until
it was truly like a reusable thing

87
00:06:55.007 --> 00:06:57.391
that I was doing over and over again.

88
00:06:57.391 --> 00:07:00.425
The point I'm trying to get at is
like if you're using Tailwind,

89
00:07:00.425 --> 00:07:04.029
don't just use Tailwind to rewrite CSS,
that doesn't make any sense to me.

90
00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:08.261
If you're gonna do that just write CSS,
right?

91
00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:13.442
Use Tailwind like it's supposed to
be used, that's what I'm getting at.
