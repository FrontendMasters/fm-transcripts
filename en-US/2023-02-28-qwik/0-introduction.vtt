00:00:00.082 --> 00:00:04.702
Today we're gonna talk about quick I am
Misko, I did this thing called Angular JS,

2
00:00:04.702 --> 00:00:07.945
and angular currently working
on this thing called Qwik.

3
00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:12.591
You might have heard of the the karma
that I've helped to co create and

4
00:00:12.591 --> 00:00:15.084
right now I'm a CTO at Builder.io.

5
00:00:15.084 --> 00:00:17.661
Builder.io does a headless visual CMS.

6
00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:22.019
Basically, if you wanna add a drag and
drop editor into your application,

7
00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.113
then you can do it with Builder.io and
we work across all tech stacks.

8
00:00:26.113 --> 00:00:30.759
So, today, I thought we could
build a Qwik contacts application.

9
00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.079
I have an example of what I
have in mind as a picture here.

10
00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.558
And we can go through a couple of things.

11
00:00:35.558 --> 00:00:39.792
We go through installing Qwik, we can talk
about Qwik-City, file layout overview,

12
00:00:39.792 --> 00:00:40.955
how that kind of works.

13
00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:44.603
We will talk about building
a basic contacts app.

14
00:00:44.603 --> 00:00:48.006
How do you display data,
which requires components, styling, and

15
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.247
adding behaviors to it?

16
00:00:49.247 --> 00:00:51.397
How do you delete data,
how do you edit data?

17
00:00:51.397 --> 00:00:53.395
And of course, how do you create data?

18
00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:56.117
And then of course, that requires
form validation, and finally,

19
00:00:56.117 --> 00:00:57.418
we're gonna talk about login.

20
00:00:57.418 --> 00:00:58.986
So, let's talk about Qwik.

21
00:00:58.986 --> 00:01:00.945
Why do we need Qwik?

22
00:01:00.945 --> 00:01:03.692
And so, I'm gonna try to
convince you of three things.

23
00:01:03.692 --> 00:01:06.210
One is that the JavaScript is the problem.

24
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.274
In other words,

25
00:01:07.274 --> 00:01:12.148
the amount of JavaScript we ship to
the client is really the problem at hand.

26
00:01:12.148 --> 00:01:17.752
It's the reason why we're having so
much problems in terms of performance.

27
00:01:17.752 --> 00:01:22.202
And the second point I wanna make is that
people love to blame the developer people

28
00:01:22.202 --> 00:01:25.744
love to basically say like you
just got crappy developers.

29
00:01:25.744 --> 00:01:28.325
If you only got better developers
you wouldn't have this problem.

30
00:01:28.325 --> 00:01:32.761
And to you know it's an easy way out and
easy way to do the only problem with that

31
00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:35.832
theory is that,
at least some developers are good and

32
00:01:35.832 --> 00:01:39.603
therefore at least some websites
should have good performance.

33
00:01:39.603 --> 00:01:41.148
But if you look around,

34
00:01:41.148 --> 00:01:45.860
you'll discover that most websites
do not have good performance, even

35
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.358
the websites that have obviously the best
developers such as Amazon and eBay, etc.

36
00:01:51.358 --> 00:01:54.470
They certainly have better
performance I'm not gonna say they

37
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.236
have bad performance but
it is not as good as it could be.

38
00:01:57.236 --> 00:02:01.436
So, I'm gonna point out basically
say like it is not your fault and

39
00:02:01.436 --> 00:02:06.011
what I mean by that is even if you try
to do everything best you will end up in

40
00:02:06.011 --> 00:02:08.116
this pit of too much JavaScript.

41
00:02:08.116 --> 00:02:10.409
And the reason for that is, in my opinion,

42
00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.291
is that the way the current
frameworks are designed.

43
00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:18.167
And so, the big thing with Qwik is
that it basically tries to solve that

44
00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:19.746
particular problem.

45
00:02:19.746 --> 00:02:24.286
Instead of starting with a relatively
little amount of JavaScript, and as you

46
00:02:24.286 --> 00:02:29.326
build more and more complicated websites,
your JavaScript just grows unboundedly.

47
00:02:29.326 --> 00:02:33.808
Qwik basically says, no, let's figure
out a way to only ship the amount of

48
00:02:33.808 --> 00:02:36.312
JavaScript that's actually required.

49
00:02:36.312 --> 00:02:38.452
And this is what I mean by that
it's not your fault, right?

50
00:02:38.452 --> 00:02:43.216
It is the frameworks basically guide
you down a path which ends up in too

51
00:02:43.216 --> 00:02:47.437
much JavaScript and
there's very little you can do about it.

52
00:02:47.437 --> 00:02:50.458
And so, that is a solution and
the solution I think is Qwik and so

53
00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:51.890
let's let's talk about it.
