00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.796
One of the things I wanted to do is to
create a new route for creating new items.

2
00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:07.685
But like you can imagine the creating
is pretty much the same thing as

3
00:00:07.685 --> 00:00:08.504
editing, right?

4
00:00:08.504 --> 00:00:10.527
It's a few differences, but
fundamentally the same thing.

5
00:00:10.527 --> 00:00:12.723
So I'm gonna skip that
in the interest of time.

6
00:00:12.723 --> 00:00:16.135
Instead, I wanna talk about,
we still have to talk about login.

7
00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:20.130
And but before we talk about login,
I wanna talk about this app for a second.

8
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.043
Let me reset the size on this.

9
00:00:23.043 --> 00:00:28.123
And the thing I wanna show you is that
this app is currently a multi-page app,

10
00:00:28.123 --> 00:00:28.680
right?

11
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.585
It's an MPA, so when I go in, I navigate,

12
00:00:32.585 --> 00:00:37.302
my server is not running,
cuz I was pushing into GitHub.

13
00:00:40.224 --> 00:00:43.756
When I navigate somewhere, I get details.

14
00:00:43.756 --> 00:00:49.828
And so navigation basically
causes a full page refresh.

15
00:00:49.828 --> 00:00:54.377
And if your framework is really
good at starting up like Qwik is,

16
00:00:54.377 --> 00:00:55.823
that might be fine.

17
00:00:55.823 --> 00:01:00.760
And the nice thing about this is is this
is literally What the SEO sees, right?

18
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.981
If I go here, and I disabled JavaScript.

19
00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:12.870
And I refresh,
the clock stops working, right?

20
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.660
BitStarz working,
the search box doesn't work anymore.

21
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.634
But I can still going, I can click
on stuff and I can go and do edit.

22
00:01:19.634 --> 00:01:23.901
And if I try to delete things, it will
still complain that it's not there,

23
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:26.360
because, it's a brown trip app, right?

24
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.980
And this is literally what Google sees.

25
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.915
So for SEO, this is amazing,
this is literally what we want.

26
00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:40.275
I can't imagine something better
from an SCS point of view.

27
00:01:42.505 --> 00:01:45.272
But it is an MPA, so
what if you wanna have an SPA, right,

28
00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:46.679
a single page application?

29
00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.031
So let's re-enable JavaScript again.

30
00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:53.715
Oops, that's not what I wanted.

31
00:01:56.045 --> 00:01:59.187
Okay, so JavaScript is re-enabled,
the clock is working again.

32
00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:08.009
So let's go to this link right here and

33
00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.570
we have our a href in here.

34
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.520
This is our contacts, right?

35
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.830
So I can click on a specific contact.

36
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.890
And instead of A,
I'm gonna turn this into capital Link.

37
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.493
So there's a special
component called link and

38
00:02:23.493 --> 00:02:26.950
I'm gonna aimport this, and
everything else stays the same.

39
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:36.570
So now, let's go back here, let's open up
Network tab and look at the JavaScript.

40
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.941
And if I go and
I click on a new, for example,

41
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:41.200
it should be a client-side navigation.

42
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.420
So whole bunch of code downloaded,
but nothing happened, what happened?

43
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.569
Looks like there is a bug and,

44
00:02:51.072 --> 00:02:54.274
The thing I wanted to point out,
let me refresh again.

45
00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:58.888
There's a little bit of JavaScript in
here, like the clock shows up, etc.

46
00:02:58.888 --> 00:03:00.664
And when I navigate to a page,

47
00:03:00.664 --> 00:03:05.085
notice that all of the code associated
with the new page gets downloaded.

48
00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:07.750
And it should execute and
it should update.

49
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.173
I don't know why that's not happening,
because the URL updates and

50
00:03:10.173 --> 00:03:11.270
everything else.

51
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.895
So sorry, a bug, my apologies.

52
00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:18.820
But the point I wanted
to make is that just

53
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.564
by changing the kind of
link you have in a system.

54
00:03:23.564 --> 00:03:28.089
You have turned a multi page
app into a single-page app.

55
00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:31.605
And by the way,
even if I still have links in here,

56
00:03:31.605 --> 00:03:35.131
let's keep the link here
which is broken for a second.

57
00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:39.927
I just wanted to disable JavaScript
here and show like, look, it's disabled.

58
00:03:39.927 --> 00:03:43.730
The JavaScript is disabled, and
then it just becomes a regular link.

59
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.110
And then it works as you would expect.

60
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.244
So it bridges the world of MPA and SPA and

61
00:03:51.244 --> 00:03:57.730
I don't know, this used to work,
so I'm sorry.

62
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.642
I need to figure out,

63
00:03:58.642 --> 00:04:01.550
to talk to the right people as to
what's going on in there, yes?

64
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.369
&gt;&gt; I guess my question is,
it looks like you're doing something

65
00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:07.039
similar to what next.Js does
with their link component.

66
00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:08.423
&gt;&gt; Yes.

67
00:04:08.423 --> 00:04:12.665
&gt;&gt; But I guess, my question is,
if you have an MPA and

68
00:04:12.665 --> 00:04:17.725
you get all these benefits in
performance and SEO and so on.

69
00:04:17.725 --> 00:04:20.919
What would be the advantage or

70
00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.783
reason to switch over
to SPA in this context?

71
00:04:25.783 --> 00:04:28.641
&gt;&gt; So there are a couple of reasons, one,

72
00:04:28.641 --> 00:04:32.620
is that MPA makes it
difficult to keep state.

73
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.690
So as navigate from page A to page B, what
if there is some state in the header and

74
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.605
header is the same in the first and
second page, right?

75
00:04:39.605 --> 00:04:42.593
It would be nice if you could keep
the state in the header, right?

76
00:04:42.593 --> 00:04:48.381
So that kind of information is why you
might want to have something like an SPA.

77
00:04:48.381 --> 00:04:52.440
The other one is it could be
under some circumstances faster.

78
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.767
As of right now, when you navigate from
page A to page B using the SPA model,

79
00:04:57.767 --> 00:05:01.700
we download the JavaScript and execute it.

80
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.066
But the thing that we would really
love to do, and we're not there yet.

81
00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:08.163
But we think we can get there, is to
just download just the inner HTML for

82
00:05:08.163 --> 00:05:09.060
that section.

83
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.761
And then the navigations
become amazingly fast.

84
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:16.037
Because you're saying, look,
the chrome around the page,

85
00:05:16.037 --> 00:05:18.060
the layout of the page stays the same.

86
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.000
Not only does this stay the same, in our
case, we have a state which is the clock.

87
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.099
That state persists between navigation,
that doesn't get destroyed.

88
00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.420
But the inner HTML updates, right?

89
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.970
So that's one of the things that
we would like to get solved,

90
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.425
keep in mind we're still in beta.

91
00:05:33.425 --> 00:05:37.660
But that's kind of the reasoning for it.

92
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.420
So many systems are either purely MPA or
purely SPA.

93
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.370
And we really would like to make it fuzzy,
I mean, you can have both.

94
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.597
You can start it as an MPA, and
then transition over to an SPA, it's fine.
