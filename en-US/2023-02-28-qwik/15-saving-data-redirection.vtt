00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.270
So this is slightly different how I think
you would normally do forms, right?

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.790
Well, we're taking advantage of basically,

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.630
the way browsers always work
the forms to post data to the server,

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.380
and then coming back with
the same exact data rendered.

5
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.639
Now in the future,

6
00:00:19.639 --> 00:00:24.285
there's gonna be something on top of
this to make it old Typesafe, and

7
00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:29.432
make the amount of hoops I have to jump
through kind of more straightforward.

8
00:00:29.432 --> 00:00:33.206
But the basic idea stays the same,
that you create a form,

9
00:00:33.206 --> 00:00:36.520
that form gets posted using
a normal browser post,

10
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.453
the server gets to validate it and
decide whether things are okay or not, and

11
00:00:41.453 --> 00:00:45.520
it essentially sends the same
form back to me to the update.

12
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.460
So, let's now implement the last bit.

13
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.310
So let's say there are no errors.

14
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.640
So where are we?

15
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.663
We're here onPost, and data shows up.

16
00:00:57.663 --> 00:01:01.790
And suppose we pass through all the checks
in here and there are no errors.

17
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:09.162
So isRequired, returns false, right?

18
00:01:09.162 --> 00:01:13.220
So, sorry, let's flip this over.

19
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.250
So const hasErrors is this one, right?

20
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.050
So now what happens if it has errors?

21
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.677
Well, if it has no errors.

22
00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:31.020
Then what we need to do,
we need to save it to the database, right?

23
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.570
So this is save contact to DB.

24
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.130
So that requires that we,
[COUGH] what do we do here?

25
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.945
We say CONTACTS find.

26
00:01:49.047 --> 00:01:52.633
Is it find returns the value?
The first element that, so

27
00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:57.139
find predicate, contact id, okay?

28
00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:59.420
So we have to make sure to
send back the contact id.

29
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.310
Well, the contact id, okay, it's used.

30
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.680
So the form we forgot to do that, when we
have a form, we have a special input here.

31
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.340
Type hidden.

32
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.030
Perfect, my gosh.

33
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.796
It's amazing.

34
00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:21.200
Is it c.id?

35
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.680
I think it's c.id, yes.

36
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.795
So now we use the Yep,

37
00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:34.947
that shouldn't use this too,
this is unnecessary, whatever that is.

38
00:02:52.181 --> 00:02:55.430
So now we copy our contact to
the existing contact, right?

39
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.035
We overwrite it.

40
00:02:58.035 --> 00:02:59.717
What is not liking it?

41
00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:04.954
Why is this not liking it?

42
00:03:08.847 --> 00:03:10.514
Because it could be undefined, I see.

43
00:03:15.187 --> 00:03:17.520
Okay, more error checking
to be written over here.

44
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.534
So we copy it into database or

45
00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:23.520
whatever the equivalent of
the database would be here.

46
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.550
And now we have to redirect.

47
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.218
So we say, throw response.

48
00:03:30.218 --> 00:03:36.269
Oops, so not only do we get a request,
we get a response.

49
00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.725
Response.redirect.

50
00:03:40.725 --> 00:03:47.157
And let's redirect ourselves
to contacts slash contact.id.

51
00:03:47.157 --> 00:03:47.687
Okay.

52
00:03:47.687 --> 00:03:51.045
Also, these routes will become
Typesafe in the future.

53
00:03:51.045 --> 00:03:54.060
So for now,
we just have to do this particular bit.

54
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.720
So, okay, I can't hit Enter,
if I hit Enter, it just complains.

55
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.935
So, let's call myself Mike Hevery.

56
00:04:06.935 --> 00:04:12.440
Oops, that's, yeah, because,
okay, I know what just happened.

57
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.956
Let's do this.

58
00:04:13.956 --> 00:04:17.635
Okay, so let's change my name to Mike.

59
00:04:17.635 --> 00:04:23.084
And just like the id didn't get copied,

60
00:04:23.084 --> 00:04:27.900
we forgot to copy the, where is it?

61
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.180
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; The avatar.

62
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.950
&gt;&gt; The avatar, yes, I've hidden id.

63
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.839
So the same thing avatar.

64
00:04:43.698 --> 00:04:48.700
&gt;&gt; It's also not displaying, so I suspect
it's not actually making it there.

65
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.988
&gt;&gt; I think I have to restart the database
because now we deleted everything.

66
00:04:50.988 --> 00:04:54.326
Bring it there.

67
00:04:54.326 --> 00:04:55.776
Okay, here we go, hit edit.

68
00:04:58.869 --> 00:05:00.740
And it's all there.

69
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.440
So now we have a full
edit cycle in our system.

70
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.558
&gt;&gt; Love to see what's going
on with the network traffic.

71
00:05:07.558 --> 00:05:08.920
&gt;&gt; Yes.

72
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.060
That's totally fair.

73
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.850
So let's look at the network traffic.

74
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.070
So [COUGH].

75
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.093
Again, no JavaScript, right?

76
00:05:14.093 --> 00:05:15.501
Because we don't need anything here.

77
00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:20.495
So, clicking on edit,
it gets us to a new route, I wanna do all,

78
00:05:20.495 --> 00:05:24.115
so let's go back again, I'll just refresh.

79
00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:28.611
So the route mhevery is full
HTML in this particular case,

80
00:05:28.611 --> 00:05:33.037
there is no behavior in here,
so no JavaScript shows up.

81
00:05:33.037 --> 00:05:37.006
Hitting edit sends you to edit.

82
00:05:37.006 --> 00:05:39.260
That URL is missing a slash on the end.

83
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.260
That's why there was a redirect.

84
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.200
Sorry, let's fix that.

85
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.707
Again, Typesafe routes would solve this.

86
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.645
See this edit is missing a slash here,
that's why there was a redirect.

87
00:05:52.645 --> 00:05:55.500
So we're here, hit edit, so
we go to the Edit URL here.

88
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.179
This is just sending normal HTML, right?

89
00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:03.588
Again this page happens to
have no behavior in here,

90
00:06:03.588 --> 00:06:05.839
we could put it behavior, right?

91
00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:10.740
If we wanted to, if I go and
change this to Misko, and I hit Enter.

92
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.150
I post back to ourselves.

93
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.694
And if you look at the header,
the header has, sorry,

94
00:06:16.694 --> 00:06:21.330
the payload had all the data,
including the name being Misko, right?

95
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.530
That caused the redirect, right?

96
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.467
This header came back with a redirect,
which was 302,

97
00:06:29.467 --> 00:06:36.300
that redirected me back into the slash
mhevery without the edit suffix.

98
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.110
And there you go, updated.

99
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.180
It also updated the database, and
now this particular thing is updated.

100
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.990
So if I go back to the list,
you can see that my name got edited.

101
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:53.569
I lost my Karen on a top, let's see.

102
00:06:56.055 --> 00:06:58.911
If I go back now to,
we need to back to hevery,

103
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:02.615
now it shows up as John over
here because I changed my name.

104
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.347
And again, we're very light on JavaScript
here, but if we needed to add behavior,

105
00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:14.220
like this particular case has
a search behavior, right?

106
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:20.440
I can search and searching causes
JavaScript to be fetched as necessary.

107
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:26.580
And so the world is very fluid in between,
like what's on a server?

108
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.279
What's on the client?

109
00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:30.128
What are the pages are, et cetera?

110
00:07:30.128 --> 00:07:31.780
It's very kind of easy to work with.
