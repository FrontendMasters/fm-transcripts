1
00:00:00.211 --> 00:00:04.523
Okay, so now,
let's get back to our quiz file.

2
00:00:04.523 --> 00:00:13.201
Okay, earlier we were working through
our quiz starter HTML document or

3
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:17.481
two JS quiz starter HTML document.

4
00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:20.740
And we had worked through a whole bunch
of to-dos in the comments here and

5
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.794
the code comments we've gone
through TODOs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

6
00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:27.086
We had written some functions, and
now we've got the homestretch.

7
00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:29.475
The rest of the TODOs
are right in front of us.

8
00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:35.364
So, what we're gonna do now is work
through these TODOs 6, 7, and 8.

9
00:00:35.364 --> 00:00:37.944
And in order to do that we're
gonna need a few things.

10
00:00:37.944 --> 00:00:41.309
We're gonna need our for loops.

11
00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.520
We're gonna need our
event handling skills.

12
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.754
We're gonna need conditional logic
to do things based on other things.

13
00:00:52.754 --> 00:00:56.644
So we're gonna break this down or take
it step by step because that is always

14
00:00:56.644 --> 00:01:00.183
the key to solving complex code
challenges is let's break it down.

15
00:01:00.183 --> 00:01:01.748
Let's go step by step.

16
00:01:01.748 --> 00:01:06.868
We're going to start with TODO 6 and
7 and use our for loops.

17
00:01:06.868 --> 00:01:10.253
And so, we're gonna do exactly what we
talked about theoretically being able to

18
00:01:10.253 --> 00:01:10.814
do earlier.

19
00:01:10.814 --> 00:01:17.562
We're gonna use a for of loop to loop over
the buttons, in this case, we have two.

20
00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:22.450
So we're gonna loop over our buttons and
attach an event listener to each button.

21
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.174
And within that event handler,
just to start out with,

22
00:01:27.174 --> 00:01:32.501
we're going to try to make sure
that we display the explanation

23
00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:38.247
text from our fact object in the div
called explanation on the page.

24
00:01:38.247 --> 00:01:43.020
So what we want, is just the part
what we're starting out with TODO 6.

25
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.960
We're going to use a for
loop to attach an event handler.

26
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.737
And in that event handler, we're going
to make sure we add the statement

27
00:01:51.737 --> 00:01:54.415
text to the appropriate div on the page.

28
00:01:57.558 --> 00:02:03.597
So what I want to do is add
a listener to each of my buttons.

29
00:02:03.597 --> 00:02:08.413
Conveniently, earlier,
we had captured all those

30
00:02:08.413 --> 00:02:12.248
buttons in our option buttons variable.

31
00:02:12.248 --> 00:02:16.616
So our option button variable,
and if we go back to,

32
00:02:22.254 --> 00:02:24.140
Let me reload this file.

33
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.024
I'm loading this locally
from my HTML file.

34
00:02:28.024 --> 00:02:31.265
If I look for my option buttons,

35
00:02:31.265 --> 00:02:36.195
I see that I have this
collection of two buttons.

36
00:02:36.195 --> 00:02:41.360
So this collection it's
not exactly an array, but

37
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.883
it is also something that is
iterable like I can do a four

38
00:02:46.883 --> 00:02:52.307
let button of option buttons,
I could do let's say.

39
00:02:54.149 --> 00:03:01.474
Console.log button, and it's going to
log out the button elements themselves.

40
00:03:01.474 --> 00:03:06.627
So our HTML collection that our
DOM API's here of query selector or

41
00:03:06.627 --> 00:03:09.663
whatever we had used get element by ID,

42
00:03:09.663 --> 00:03:14.370
that's going to give us
an iterable collection of buttons.

43
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.735
So we can use a for
of loop to iterate over it.

44
00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:22.669
So let us try to do this where
instead of logging the buttons,

45
00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:27.130
we're actually adding a click
handler to each of the buttons.

46
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.792
Can anybody walk me through how they would
start approaching this with a for of loop?

47
00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:37.058
Who'd like to take a stab at it, Paul?

48
00:03:37.058 --> 00:03:42.428
&gt;&gt; So for, then in parentheses
button of option buttons,

49
00:03:42.428 --> 00:03:43.857
&gt;&gt; Okay, like this.

50
00:03:46.607 --> 00:03:47.422
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

51
00:03:47.422 --> 00:03:53.997
&gt;&gt; Okay, is there anything else that
we need to do in a for of loop?

52
00:03:53.997 --> 00:03:54.877
&gt;&gt; Let, sorry.

53
00:03:54.877 --> 00:03:58.273
&gt;&gt; So
the let is actually doing some work here.

54
00:03:58.273 --> 00:04:02.403
Because what that's doing is essentially,
this button here,

55
00:04:02.403 --> 00:04:04.858
JavaScript doesn't know what it is.

56
00:04:04.858 --> 00:04:09.317
We are basically declaring it
like a little local variable.

57
00:04:09.317 --> 00:04:14.280
And remember how we said yesterday
about scope that variables have scope

58
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.814
when they're inside of a function.

59
00:04:16.814 --> 00:04:19.121
Let's say we get a new scope for
those variables.

60
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:23.217
For loops are another case
where with let and const,

61
00:04:23.217 --> 00:04:28.166
we get a new kind of scope for
our variables, just as a fun fact.

62
00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:31.001
Okay, and I'm just gonna add,

63
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:35.936
I'm gonna bring this curly
braces way down here because

64
00:04:35.936 --> 00:04:41.412
we're going to do a bunch of
stuff inside of this loop, okay?

65
00:04:41.412 --> 00:04:44.597
So we've got our for loop started,
so for lead options for

66
00:04:44.597 --> 00:04:46.814
like button of option buttons, great.

67
00:04:46.814 --> 00:04:47.701
And now, what do we want to do?

68
00:04:47.701 --> 00:04:50.701
We want to add a click event listener.

69
00:04:52.415 --> 00:04:53.749
So, how can we do that?

70
00:04:55.594 --> 00:04:56.737
Paul, do you want to keep going?

71
00:04:56.737 --> 00:05:01.242
&gt;&gt; Yes, so,
we have the button in hand that is now.

72
00:05:01.242 --> 00:05:02.312
&gt;&gt; We can now talk about button.

73
00:05:02.312 --> 00:05:05.156
&gt;&gt; This one, and then it will
be the second one for each loop.

74
00:05:05.156 --> 00:05:05.765
&gt;&gt; Exactly, right?

75
00:05:05.765 --> 00:05:09.271
So just like here when we had said for
left button of option buttons

76
00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:13.733
console log button, the first time it
runs, it's the first button which is true,

77
00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:16.685
and the second time it's the false button,
exactly.

78
00:05:16.685 --> 00:05:22.694
&gt;&gt; So
you can just do button.addEventListener.

79
00:05:22.694 --> 00:05:24.150
&gt;&gt; That's the method we need, okay?

80
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.431
And then how does
the addEventListener work again?

81
00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:31.031
And look at my IDE being so helpful as
to tell me some complicated things that

82
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:34.036
aren't really actually
making any sense to me.

83
00:05:34.036 --> 00:05:36.293
All right,
addEventListener takes two arguments.

84
00:05:36.293 --> 00:05:38.384
The first thing we need to give it is?

85
00:05:38.384 --> 00:05:39.104
&gt;&gt; Click.

86
00:05:39.104 --> 00:05:43.102
&gt;&gt; Click in this case, so
the name of the event, and it's a string,

87
00:05:43.102 --> 00:05:45.817
the name of the event,
and then use a comma.

88
00:05:45.817 --> 00:05:46.751
&gt;&gt; A callback function.

89
00:05:46.751 --> 00:05:49.430
&gt;&gt; A callback function.

90
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.348
&gt;&gt; So in parentheses E or error.

91
00:05:52.348 --> 00:05:53.456
&gt;&gt; Yes we could say, E or

92
00:05:53.456 --> 00:05:57.645
event I'll just spell it out because just
to make it even clearer for anybody, or

93
00:05:57.645 --> 00:06:01.793
maybe future me who's rereading this and
doesn't remember what it is, okay?

94
00:06:01.793 --> 00:06:03.391
&gt;&gt; And then the fat arrow.

95
00:06:03.391 --> 00:06:04.353
&gt;&gt; Arrow.

96
00:06:04.353 --> 00:06:05.883
&gt;&gt; And then the curly braces.

97
00:06:05.883 --> 00:06:06.648
&gt;&gt; Curly braces.

98
00:06:06.648 --> 00:06:09.432
Okay.
And now we're gonna do some stuff, and

99
00:06:09.432 --> 00:06:13.320
I'm gonna move the end of our
event handler function body down

100
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.988
here because we're gonna do a bunch
of stuff in the event handler, okay?

101
00:06:17.988 --> 00:06:19.357
So great, so now,

102
00:06:19.357 --> 00:06:24.074
we've got an event listener added
to each of the option buttons.

103
00:06:24.074 --> 00:06:27.958
And what I'm gonna do here before
we even do what we wanna do,

104
00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:36.426
I'm just gonna do a nice little developer
trick of saying like, Heard a click.

105
00:06:36.426 --> 00:06:40.916
[LAUGH] Just to make sure that
this is actually working.

106
00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:46.907
So I'm gonna save my file,
go back and reload it.

107
00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:50.356
And now, if my event handler is attached,
when I click a button,

108
00:06:50.356 --> 00:06:52.006
we should see heard of a click.

109
00:06:52.006 --> 00:06:55.218
And both of the buttons should say the
same thing, heard a click, heard a click.

110
00:06:55.218 --> 00:06:58.704
So my heard a click is happening
six times here, so far.

111
00:06:58.704 --> 00:06:59.350
Okay, great.

112
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.106
All right,
now let's actually do something useful.

113
00:07:01.106 --> 00:07:02.762
I'm gonna get rid of that.

114
00:07:02.762 --> 00:07:05.798
So who could walk me through
the second half of this ask here?

115
00:07:05.798 --> 00:07:12.427
Which is, one second, so
we can read this better.

116
00:07:12.427 --> 00:07:19.607
Within the event handler, we want to
set the text of the div in my HTML,

117
00:07:19.607 --> 00:07:24.479
which is intended to
contain the explanation,

118
00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:31.571
which luckily earlier we had captured
as the variable explanation.

119
00:07:31.571 --> 00:07:34.251
We're going to put text inside of that.

120
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:39.783
That is the actual explanation for
our fact that we had declared earlier.

121
00:07:39.783 --> 00:07:45.290
Okay, so this is what we wanna
do now inside of our function.

122
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.546
So who would like to walk me
through how we can do that?

123
00:07:49.546 --> 00:07:54.278
Setting the text of the explanation
element to the explanation within my fact

124
00:07:54.278 --> 00:07:54.872
object.

125
00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:02.817
Do you want to take a stab at it?

126
00:08:02.817 --> 00:08:12.411
&gt;&gt; Would it be explanation
=fact.explanation.textContent?

127
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:16.036
&gt;&gt; Okay, we're getting very close.

128
00:08:16.036 --> 00:08:18.885
Let's talk about, so we have two things,

129
00:08:18.885 --> 00:08:22.380
we have our explanation right now,
refers to what?

130
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.802
Let's scroll up in our code and
figure out what explanation is gonna be.

131
00:08:25.802 --> 00:08:27.276
&gt;&gt; So the element.

132
00:08:27.276 --> 00:08:29.330
&gt;&gt; That's going to be the element.

133
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:35.304
And so, the element is what's going
to have text content inside of it.

134
00:08:35.304 --> 00:08:37.332
Now what about fact.explanation?

135
00:08:37.332 --> 00:08:38.812
What is that going to refer to?

136
00:08:40.108 --> 00:08:42.529
To the value that's
stored in that premise.

137
00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:47.472
&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's going to be the value
of the property explanation on my fact

138
00:08:47.472 --> 00:08:52.900
object, which in this case is a string,
that is the explanation text that I want.

139
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.167
So we just need to hook
one up to the other.

140
00:08:57.167 --> 00:08:59.374
&gt;&gt; Explanation.textContent.

141
00:08:59.374 --> 00:09:00.100
&gt;&gt; Beautiful.

142
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.535
&gt;&gt; =fact.explanation.

143
00:09:03.535 --> 00:09:05.737
&gt;&gt; All right, let's give this a shot.

144
00:09:05.737 --> 00:09:08.320
Now, as always, in programming,

145
00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.121
the best way to figure out
if it's working is to try.

146
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:13.280
So let's see what happens.

147
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.967
So I'm gonna save my file, go back,
reload so that I get my changes.

148
00:09:18.967 --> 00:09:22.364
And now,
I expect that if I click on either button,

149
00:09:22.364 --> 00:09:25.221
basically the same thing is gonna happen.

150
00:09:25.221 --> 00:09:29.897
We're going to see the explanation
pop up if we've done our job.

151
00:09:29.897 --> 00:09:31.121
Moment of truth.

152
00:09:32.684 --> 00:09:33.881
Great!

153
00:09:33.881 --> 00:09:36.212
I clicked the true button and it worked.

154
00:09:36.212 --> 00:09:39.218
And if I click the false button,
I just reloaded,

155
00:09:39.218 --> 00:09:42.161
and if I click the false button,
it also worked.

156
00:09:42.161 --> 00:09:48.804
We did it, we've now attached to
an event handler that modifies the page.

157
00:09:48.804 --> 00:09:52.288
We're not totally done though because
right now, I can keep clicking these

158
00:09:52.288 --> 00:09:55.825
buttons and nothing happens because
it's setting the text content again and

159
00:09:55.825 --> 00:09:56.986
again to the same thing.

160
00:09:56.986 --> 00:10:00.635
So really, we want a couple of
other things to be happening here.

161
00:10:00.635 --> 00:10:02.613
So great, we've done our TODO number 6.

162
00:10:02.613 --> 00:10:03.891
