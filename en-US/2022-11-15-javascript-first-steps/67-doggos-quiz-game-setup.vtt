1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.235
So we are knocking these
projects back here.

2
00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:06.465
We have completed our Quiz.js project,

3
00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:11.911
where we had this interactive page
that responds to users and lets them

4
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:17.743
know whether they got that question
true or false, correct or incorrect.

5
00:00:17.743 --> 00:00:22.391
What we're gonna do now is
move on to our next project.

6
00:00:22.391 --> 00:00:30.330
So our next project is to kind of
make a new version of our quiz.

7
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.379
So our original quiz was for
a JavaScript question, and

8
00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.972
it had two options, true or false.

9
00:00:36.972 --> 00:00:39.452
And when we click one of the options,

10
00:00:39.452 --> 00:00:42.892
it shows whether you got
the question right or not.

11
00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:48.248
We're gonna keep some elements
of that the same, but

12
00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:53.485
we're basically going to
make over our project to do

13
00:00:53.485 --> 00:00:58.855
something even cuter, and
that cuteness is doggos.

14
00:00:58.855 --> 00:01:03.825
So what we're gonna do, so we're gonna
create a new quiz game similar in

15
00:01:03.825 --> 00:01:08.562
structure but with even more fancy
stuff going on behind the scenes.

16
00:01:08.562 --> 00:01:15.688
That is going to give us an image of
a dog and a few choices of dog breeds.

17
00:01:15.688 --> 00:01:19.066
And we have to guess the breed of the dog.

18
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:22.961
Does anybody have a guess
of which breed this is,

19
00:01:22.961 --> 00:01:28.156
fox terrier, Caucasian Ovcharka,
or Cairn Terrier?

20
00:01:28.156 --> 00:01:28.856
&gt;&gt; Terrier.

21
00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:30.143
&gt;&gt; It's some kind of terrier.

22
00:01:30.143 --> 00:01:33.003
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Terrier
&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go ahead and guess Cairn,

23
00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:33.961
I happen to like dogs.

24
00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:38.837
So if we get the breed right, we don't
have any texts to display or anything,

25
00:01:38.837 --> 00:01:43.879
it's just gonna tell us, yep, that was
the right answer by coloring it green.

26
00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:47.310
And the fun part is every
time we reload this page,

27
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.306
we're going to get a new picture,
with a new doggo and some new choices.

28
00:01:52.306 --> 00:01:55.714
And so here, I honestly have no idea,
but let's just pick something else.

29
00:01:55.714 --> 00:02:00.657
And this time, it's gonna tell us not
only that we got this answer wrong,

30
00:02:00.657 --> 00:02:05.760
but it's also going to use the green
button to show us which one was correct,

31
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.860
cuz we have three options now.

32
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.720
So what we're gonna do is we're going
to use a similar style of manipulating

33
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.029
the page, as what we've been doing before.

34
00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:19.063
But we're going to do it in a slightly
different way, both in terms of how we're

35
00:02:19.063 --> 00:02:24.192
populating the data on the page, and
in terms of how we're organizing our code.

36
00:02:24.192 --> 00:02:29.095
So we have a new project starter here,
it's pretty boring cuz nothing's

37
00:02:29.095 --> 00:02:34.487
happening yet, because it's the starter,
cuz we have to write the code for it.

38
00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:39.307
You can find it on
unjana.dev/javascript-first-steps.

39
00:02:39.307 --> 00:02:44.385
In Day 3, it's the Doggo Fetch Starter.

40
00:02:44.385 --> 00:02:49.305
So if you open that up, you'll get
this pretty boring looking page.

41
00:02:49.305 --> 00:02:54.683
But what you wanna do is right-click
Save Page As, or File Save Page As,

42
00:02:54.683 --> 00:02:58.926
or Save File As,
depending on how your browser names it.

43
00:02:58.926 --> 00:03:03.604
And similarly as before,
save it as a local HTML file, and

44
00:03:03.604 --> 00:03:07.433
then we're gonna open it
up in our code editor.

45
00:03:07.433 --> 00:03:13.097
So I'm gonna call this Doggo Fetch.html.

46
00:03:13.097 --> 00:03:15.771
I think it'll automatically
do that on my system.

47
00:03:15.771 --> 00:03:17.646
Go over to my code editor.

48
00:03:17.646 --> 00:03:20.441
I am going to, I can leave my quiz open.

49
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:22.865
Now, I'm gonna open a file and

50
00:03:22.865 --> 00:03:27.629
find the Doggo Fetch.html file
that I had just downloaded.

51
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.084
Cool, and
you can take a look at what's in here.

52
00:03:32.084 --> 00:03:35.516
We've got, like before,
we have some CSS, and

53
00:03:35.516 --> 00:03:40.643
we have a few elements in our HTML,
even less going on than we did before.

54
00:03:40.643 --> 00:03:45.345
Because what we're gonna do is we're
gonna dynamically add elements to the DOM

55
00:03:45.345 --> 00:03:46.055
this time.

56
00:03:46.055 --> 00:03:47.520
So like before, this time,

57
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.505
we're not writing everything from scratch
cuz that would take way too long.

58
00:03:51.505 --> 00:03:54.223
But we have some starter,
some comments, and

59
00:03:54.223 --> 00:03:57.789
some functions that we need to
fill in the functionality of.

60
00:03:57.789 --> 00:04:02.077
And so we're gonna work through the to-do
comments in this code as we go through

61
00:04:02.077 --> 00:04:06.495
the next concepts that we're gonna wrap
our heads around, similarly to before.

62
00:04:06.495 --> 00:04:07.192
This time,

63
00:04:07.192 --> 00:04:12.017
we're gonna do something that's even
fancier stuff going on behind the scenes.

64
00:04:12.017 --> 00:04:17.316
So that is our new mission.

65
00:04:17.316 --> 00:04:20.875
So yeah, once again,
we're going to the course site,

66
00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:26.181
anjana.dev/javascript-first-steps, going
to the Day 3 starter version,

67
00:04:26.181 --> 00:04:29.533
and downloading that,
opening in our text editor.

68
00:04:29.533 --> 00:04:32.146
And there is a finished version, so

69
00:04:32.146 --> 00:04:36.772
that we can compare to my solution,
yours might be different.

70
00:04:36.772 --> 00:04:40.013
So yay, project, as Cher says in Clueless.

71
00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:43.933
Okay, I hope y'all like dogs, cuz we're
gonna be looking at a lot of them.
