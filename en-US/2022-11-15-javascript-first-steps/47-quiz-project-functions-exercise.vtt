00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.850
So let us now go back
to our quiz document.

2
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.205
Yeah, and in the next TODOs,
TODOs four and

3
00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:18.170
five we have some comments asking us
to declare a couple of functions.

4
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:25.800
So these are gonna ask us to do something
that maybe we haven't tried doing before,

5
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.160
which is to disable or
enable a button element.

6
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.348
And button elements in HTML
have an attribute that can

7
00:00:35.348 --> 00:00:42.740
have an attribute called disabled,
which if it is set disables the button.

8
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.060
And then we're also going to declare
a function called isCorrect,

9
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.060
which is gonna take in a guess string.

10
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.624
And it's going to compare
that to the correct answer

11
00:00:55.624 --> 00:00:59.255
which you declared in your fact object and

12
00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:04.870
it's going to tell us whether
that guess is the correct answer.

13
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:05.579
Cool, so

14
00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:11.179
these are the functions that we're
gonna write in our quiz HTML document.

15
00:01:15.104 --> 00:01:18.571
This is kind of a tricky one
because I teed you up for

16
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:22.299
something new that we
haven't talked about before.

17
00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:29.067
But this is because I have such confidence
in your investigative powers of figuring

18
00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:35.070
out how to do new stuff with for example
the help of our friend MDN perhaps.
