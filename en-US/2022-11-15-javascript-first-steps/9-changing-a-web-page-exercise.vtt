00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.061
Okay, so now armed with these few spells
and our good friend MDN always, so

2
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:12.160
this time, it's less of a scavenger hunt
and more of a task list, a to do list.

3
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.487
We're gonna go through and we're gonna
actually manipulate this page and

4
00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:17.660
make it individualized.

5
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.921
So far we've been all
looking at the same page.

6
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:23.728
Now we're going to customize our page for
ourselves.

7
00:00:23.728 --> 00:00:28.391
So, if you're sitting here in the room,
you're going to first of all change

8
00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:31.333
the player names to player
one can be yourself and

9
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:34.521
player two can be your
closest neighbor next to you.

10
00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:36.542
And if you don't remember their name,
ask them.

11
00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:40.649
If you're following along at home,
you can make player one yourself and

12
00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.291
then player two whoever is closest to you
in the room you're in, or in your house,

13
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:48.961
or a friend you just talked to on
the phone, or whoever you want.

14
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:53.079
Then as another fun add on,
swap the symbols.

15
00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.942
So right now player one has an x and
player two has an o, swap them,

16
00:00:57.942 --> 00:00:59.806
so player one gets the o.

17
00:00:59.806 --> 00:01:04.421
And then change the subtitle of the page,
right now it says, a game you know,

18
00:01:04.421 --> 00:01:06.770
change it to, a game you know and love.

19
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.472
This is you mission should
you choose to accept it.

20
00:01:09.472 --> 00:01:12.573
So let's take five minutes and
try to do that.

21
00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:23.291
We're back, with a different webpage
than we had before, perhaps.

22
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:24.412
How did this go?

23
00:01:24.412 --> 00:01:28.123
How are we feeling?
Are we starting to feel the immense cosmic

24
00:01:28.123 --> 00:01:30.985
powers of our JavaScript spells?

25
00:01:30.985 --> 00:01:33.721
Little bit, at least for
this one web page?

26
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:38.227
Okay, so
how did you all decide to do this?

27
00:01:38.227 --> 00:01:41.692
For number one, changing the player names.

28
00:01:41.692 --> 00:01:45.775
We saw one example of
changing first player name.

29
00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:51.809
So in mine, now it says Sofia and friends,
can somebody else change it to their name?

30
00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:56.655
How about Jason,
you look ready to change something.

31
00:01:56.655 --> 00:01:58.104
&gt;&gt; I think I cheated.

32
00:01:58.104 --> 00:02:05.255
I went right into the document itself and
changed all of the values.

33
00:02:05.255 --> 00:02:08.360
&gt;&gt; All right, well,
this is a totally legit thing.

34
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.974
Since our dev tools let
us edit HTML directly,

35
00:02:12.974 --> 00:02:20.427
one way we can change what's on the page
is by going into our inspector tab,

36
00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:27.201
drilling into whatever we want and
editing it as we see fit, right?

37
00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:32.221
So that is perhaps cheating because
we're not using JavaScript,

38
00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:35.547
but it gets the job done, so that's great.

39
00:02:35.547 --> 00:02:39.846
And now I have deleted a space
the all important space.

40
00:02:39.846 --> 00:02:46.217
Okay, did anybody manage to use
JavaScript to do the same thing?

41
00:02:46.217 --> 00:02:51.750
&gt;&gt; I changed the game name using
query selector h two.text content but

42
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.116
then when I tried to do
the same thing with p1-name,

43
00:02:56.116 --> 00:02:59.916
it says,
do not set properties of no setting.

44
00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:04.410
&gt;&gt; Errors, errors, JavaScript always
is gonna complain when we're doing

45
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.466
something so
let's find out what happened here.

46
00:03:07.466 --> 00:03:10.124
So you typed document.?

47
00:03:10.124 --> 00:03:11.250
&gt;&gt; QuerySelector.

48
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.185
&gt;&gt; QuerySelector.

49
00:03:12.185 --> 00:03:14.462
&gt;&gt; Yep, p1-name.

50
00:03:14.462 --> 00:03:16.074
&gt;&gt; p1-name.

51
00:03:16.074 --> 00:03:17.865
&gt;&gt; Yep, dot-
&gt;&gt; And?

52
00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:18.546
&gt;&gt; Xcontent.

53
00:03:18.546 --> 00:03:24.215
&gt;&gt; Right now, we are noticing that
we are missing something because

54
00:03:24.215 --> 00:03:29.170
right now if we stop here and
we press enter, we see null.

55
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.408
And so now if I tried .textContent,
JavaScript is like, no,

56
00:03:33.408 --> 00:03:36.811
I don't know what happened but
something is wrong.

57
00:03:36.811 --> 00:03:41.474
So we're gonna talk about this later but
there is something wrong

58
00:03:41.474 --> 00:03:45.901
here because we wanted an HTML
element to come back from this.

59
00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:49.272
And instead we got something called null,
which we're gonna talk about later about,

60
00:03:49.272 --> 00:03:49.839
what is null?

61
00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:51.244
Is it related to undefined?

62
00:03:51.244 --> 00:03:53.901
What are they, do they do things for
us, who knows?

63
00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:58.956
So, There is some small
change we need to make.

64
00:03:58.956 --> 00:04:00.018
We figured out what it is OJ?

65
00:04:00.018 --> 00:04:00.940
&gt;&gt; It's a hashtag.

66
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.002
&gt;&gt; It's a hashtag.

67
00:04:02.002 --> 00:04:05.697
&gt;&gt; Why does it care?

68
00:04:05.697 --> 00:04:07.925
&gt;&gt; If we put the hash there,

69
00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:12.926
now we get back the span
element that we were expecting.

70
00:04:12.926 --> 00:04:16.031
Does anybody know why
do we need that hash?

71
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:17.267
Can anybody recap or

72
00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:22.560
does anybody have a guess as to why it
matters whether that hash is there?

73
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.000
Yes, Paul.

74
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.111
&gt;&gt; I think that without
the hash it's just looking for

75
00:04:28.111 --> 00:04:33.380
an element that named, and
that's not an element, it's an ID.

76
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.840
&gt;&gt; Right, so in our HTML,
we're looking for

77
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.540
this span right here with
the name inside of it.

78
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.041
This has the id p1-name.

79
00:04:49.041 --> 00:04:54.249
And so it is the id attribute, and
this is a kind of a special one,

80
00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.635
that we're looking for in this element.

81
00:04:57.635 --> 00:05:01.957
Now when we use querySelector,
we said we're using CSS selectors or

82
00:05:01.957 --> 00:05:07.420
the type of selectors we use in CSS,
to pull out elements from the page.

83
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.750
And the querySelector p1-name, JavaScript
didn't complain, it didn't give an error.

84
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.511
This is a valid thing I could pass in.

85
00:05:14.511 --> 00:05:20.023
But it's not going to return anything
because querySelector p1-name is,

86
00:05:20.023 --> 00:05:24.769
as Paul pointed out, looking for
an element that looks like this,

87
00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:27.417
has some kind of tag name p1-name.

88
00:05:27.417 --> 00:05:33.613
Which even that minus is unexpected,
that's not really what we're looking for.

89
00:05:33.613 --> 00:05:37.480
We could, for example,
try the name of this, sorry,

90
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.035
the type of this element, so
the tag name itself would be a span.

91
00:05:42.035 --> 00:05:46.754
But we said that querySelector
singular returned to the first

92
00:05:46.754 --> 00:05:48.577
element that matches.

93
00:05:48.577 --> 00:05:49.613
So in this case,

94
00:05:49.613 --> 00:05:55.022
that's gonna give us the p1-symbol span
because it occurs earlier in the document.

95
00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:58.293
And so that's gonna pick out that x
which is not exactly what we want.

96
00:05:58.293 --> 00:06:03.240
So instead what we can use in this case,
because there's

97
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.187
an id on the element that we
want on this particular span,

98
00:06:08.187 --> 00:06:13.959
we can kind of jump straight to
that element using the id selector,

99
00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:18.494
which happens to be in CSS,
it happens to be the # and

100
00:06:18.494 --> 00:06:22.549
then the text of the id or
the content of the id.

101
00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:25.084
So in this case #id_value and then in CSS,

102
00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:29.207
we would be using it kind of like at
the beginning of some styling rules.

103
00:06:29.207 --> 00:06:31.434
In JavaScript with querySelector,

104
00:06:31.434 --> 00:06:36.262
we can use it to pick out the same element
that CSS would pick out in a style sheet.

105
00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:40.935
So in this case,
that's why these have different values.

106
00:06:40.935 --> 00:06:46.377
So once we've got our querySelector
p1-name, then in order to change the text,

107
00:06:46.377 --> 00:06:50.513
OJ, you wanna walk me through
the rest of your solution there?

108
00:06:50.513 --> 00:06:56.816
&gt;&gt; QuerySelector
#p1-name.textcontent equals JSON.

109
00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:59.073
Text Content equals, well,

110
00:06:59.073 --> 00:07:04.869
I mean I guess in this case it would be
whatever you want, so we can make it OJ.

111
00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:09.330
And now the page has changed, cool?

112
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.415
Cool, cool, cool.

113
00:07:10.415 --> 00:07:11.180
Cool, cool, cool.

114
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.845
Awesome, all right.

115
00:07:13.845 --> 00:07:17.443
And we could do the same thing for
the other player.

116
00:07:17.443 --> 00:07:20.915
Just really quickly,
how would I change the player O?

117
00:07:20.915 --> 00:07:24.117
Yeah, Paul,
&gt;&gt; This is an excellent use of the up

118
00:07:24.117 --> 00:07:24.651
arrow.

119
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:25.936
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Indeed it is.

120
00:07:25.936 --> 00:07:28.821
So I'm gonna press up arrow and fun fact,

121
00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:34.150
even if I clear, I can still use
my up arrow to go back in history.

122
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.822
So in this case,
what should I change this to?

123
00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:39.426
&gt;&gt; Just change the p1 to p2.

124
00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:43.803
&gt;&gt; So we can press, make this p2-name and

125
00:07:43.803 --> 00:07:49.873
then the text content can be,
why don't we make it you?

126
00:07:49.873 --> 00:07:50.724
Like this?

127
00:07:50.724 --> 00:07:52.341
&gt;&gt; Yep.

128
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:57.223
&gt;&gt; Beautiful, so
now we have different players, excellent.

129
00:07:57.223 --> 00:08:01.801
Okay, now we already maybe got a little
bit of a preview about the symbols here.

130
00:08:01.801 --> 00:08:06.114
How did we approach number two swapping
the player symbols, the X and the O?

131
00:08:06.114 --> 00:08:10.494
So we know that the O will come first and
the X will come second.

132
00:08:10.494 --> 00:08:12.106
Can anybody walk me through this?

133
00:08:14.907 --> 00:08:19.854
So first we have to pick out
the element containing each symbol.

134
00:08:19.854 --> 00:08:22.278
So let's try to go for the x first, right?

135
00:08:22.278 --> 00:08:23.780
Which we picked out before.

136
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.764
If we remember, we saw that it is inside
of another span which has an id on it, so

137
00:08:29.764 --> 00:08:31.660
that's handy.

138
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.900
So we can pick this out
using the id p1 symbol.

139
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.044
So can anybody just for variety's sake,

140
00:08:39.044 --> 00:08:42.730
walk me through another option I
have other than using querySelector?

141
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:45.170
Anybody remember?

142
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.040
Yeah.

143
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.190
&gt;&gt; In chat they're using
document.getElementById.

144
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.920
&gt;&gt; Excellent, so getElementById.

145
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.206
And then the ID for the x,
let's say, is p1 symbol.

146
00:08:56.206 --> 00:08:59.078
And now I can already see my browser
is being so helpful in the dev tools.

147
00:08:59.078 --> 00:09:03.018
It's already showing me,
highlighting what element,

148
00:09:03.018 --> 00:09:08.116
it's showing span hash p1 symbol,
meaning the span with ID p1 symbol.

149
00:09:08.116 --> 00:09:12.665
So we wanna pick out the symbol x, and
we're gonna try to do it in a way that

150
00:09:12.665 --> 00:09:18.220
doesn't use querySelector just to stretch
our JavaScript muscles a little bit.

151
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:26.275
So one of the suggestions made from
the chat is to do document getElementById,

152
00:09:26.275 --> 00:09:31.410
and then the Id for
the x there would be p1 symbol.

153
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:37.193
And as you can see, the browser is already
helpfully highlighting what element

154
00:09:37.193 --> 00:09:38.608
I'm picking out here,

155
00:09:38.608 --> 00:09:43.589
it's showing me there is a span hash p1
symbol meaning the span with id p1 symbol.

156
00:09:43.589 --> 00:09:46.925
And so
how do I now change this now to an o?

157
00:09:46.925 --> 00:09:51.848
Maybe the chat had already
solved it in the messages there.

158
00:09:51.848 --> 00:09:57.069
So we do document.get element
by ID quotes P1 symbol and

159
00:09:57.069 --> 00:09:58.434
then-
&gt;&gt; Text content,

160
00:09:58.434 --> 00:09:59.731
&gt;&gt; Text content,

161
00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:03.532
I'm just tabbing to auto complete and
then,

162
00:10:05.349 --> 00:10:09.820
Space, we want to change this, right?

163
00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.842
So the spell that we used to
do that was the equal sign and

164
00:10:12.842 --> 00:10:15.093
then whatever we want the content to be.

165
00:10:15.093 --> 00:10:19.552
In this case, we want to swap it to the
other symbol, which is a letter O capital.

166
00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:21.590
So now we have two player O's.

167
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.740
Once I run [LAUGH] this we have player O,
player O, that's not helpful.

168
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.625
Let's swap the other one which, again,

169
00:10:27.625 --> 00:10:32.830
we can use our little shortcut up arrow
to find the last command we entered.

170
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:42.800
I'm just gonna go ahead and change this
to p2-symbol to pick out the second line.

171
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.618
And then this one similarly,
we'll replace the O with an X and

172
00:10:46.618 --> 00:10:48.680
now they're in the other order.

173
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.924
&gt;&gt; Is there any fancy reverse
functions that you could do,

174
00:10:52.924 --> 00:10:55.770
like dynamically reassign
them in an order or no?

175
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.400
&gt;&gt; Is there a fancy function we could do?

176
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.190
The answer is always yes,
there's always something we could do.

177
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.335
We could write our own function,
let's say,

178
00:11:04.335 --> 00:11:08.310
that has some kind of representation of
the two symbols and then reverses them.

179
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:13.770
Once we figure out JavaScript, we can
make it do pretty much anything we want.

180
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.890
Not always, there's an asterisk on that,
but pretty much anything we want.

181
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.890
But in this case, we're just trying
to get these spells, kind of

182
00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:25.401
these different ways of interacting
with the DOM really under our belts so

183
00:11:25.401 --> 00:11:30.220
that we feel confident working
with the page and messing with it.

184
00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:34.746
So that's why we're just kind of
focusing on these getElementById, and

185
00:11:34.746 --> 00:11:38.400
querySelector, and textContent,
and things like that.

186
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.690
The last thing we wanted to do was
change the subtitle of the page.

187
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:49.179
Right now the subtitle page says,
a game you know and

188
00:11:49.179 --> 00:11:52.865
we want it to say,
a game you know and love.

189
00:11:52.865 --> 00:11:57.405
So there's a couple of different ways I
could do this, what options do I have?

190
00:11:57.405 --> 00:12:04.809
And can anybody think of a way to do this
using a spell that we haven't used yet

191
00:12:04.809 --> 00:12:09.336
in this exercise that
we saw briefly earlier?

192
00:12:09.336 --> 00:12:14.376
Where we add on to
existing text content or

193
00:12:14.376 --> 00:12:21.342
in other words, append, To text content.

194
00:12:21.342 --> 00:12:25.320
Did anyone use append in their
solution to this exercise?

195
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.800
I'm seeing some nodding.

196
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.430
Sounds like maybe in the chats
there were some uses of append.

197
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:35.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's three different
ways that people are adding.

198
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.720
&gt;&gt; Great, so let's see,
what have we got here?

199
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.680
Some examples or some options.

200
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.840
And again, there's lots of options.

201
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:47.181
&gt;&gt; So one person's using querySelector,
header,

202
00:12:47.181 --> 00:12:53.800
space h2, and then append in quotes,
space and space love.

203
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.387
&gt;&gt; So we can use querySelector,
as we said,

204
00:12:58.387 --> 00:13:01.315
to pick out elements using CSS selectors.

205
00:13:01.315 --> 00:13:06.029
And so in this case,
if we want to pick out

206
00:13:06.029 --> 00:13:11.301
the h2 element that is
inside of the header,

207
00:13:11.301 --> 00:13:14.648
we can use header space h2.

208
00:13:14.648 --> 00:13:17.129
This basically is sort of like
getting more and more specific.

209
00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:20.842
It's saying in the header element,
something that's an h2 element.

210
00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:24.544
And again, I can read all about this
in MDN if I wanna read up on different

211
00:13:24.544 --> 00:13:28.589
selectors and how that syntax works, but
this is a totally valid way to do it.

212
00:13:28.589 --> 00:13:31.470
And I like it because we're discovering
a new way to derail into it.

213
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.616
And then what did we have Mark, sorry.

214
00:13:34.616 --> 00:13:38.448
&gt;&gt; .append, in quotes.

215
00:13:38.448 --> 00:13:43.987
&gt;&gt; .append, and then in quotes-
&gt;&gt; Space and space love.

216
00:13:43.987 --> 00:13:46.326
&gt;&gt; Space and space love.

217
00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:47.638
Look at that.

218
00:13:47.638 --> 00:13:48.789
We've done it.

219
00:13:50.677 --> 00:13:55.276
And now if we drill into our HTML,
we'll see if we go into this h2 element,

220
00:13:55.276 --> 00:13:57.399
we have, a game you know and love.

221
00:13:57.399 --> 00:14:02.580
So additional text has been appended
into the content of this element.

222
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.550
Question.

223
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:07.998
&gt;&gt; This is probably beyond the scope of
what you wanna talk about right now, but

224
00:14:07.998 --> 00:14:10.915
I did the append but
I misspelled what I appended,

225
00:14:10.915 --> 00:14:15.663
is there any way to immediately roll back
the previous command that you just did?

226
00:14:15.663 --> 00:14:18.693
&gt;&gt; Interesting,
is there a quick way to basically, no,

227
00:14:18.693 --> 00:14:22.871
I didn't wanna say a game you know and
love because I actually hate tic tac toe.

228
00:14:22.871 --> 00:14:24.799
I wanna say a game you know and hate.

229
00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:30.632
Is there a quick way to edit that?

230
00:14:30.632 --> 00:14:35.855
I'm not familiar with a undo here.

231
00:14:35.855 --> 00:14:37.742
Ctrl+Z isn't gonna work unfortunately.

232
00:14:37.742 --> 00:14:44.154
[LAUGH] But what we can do, we do know
how to completely replace the text.

233
00:14:44.154 --> 00:14:48.608
That may be a great question, how do I
completely replace this subtitle and

234
00:14:48.608 --> 00:14:50.516
change it to, a game you know and

235
00:14:50.516 --> 00:14:55.629
hate just to add a little negativity into
our classroom, why wouldn't we want that?

236
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:57.381
Any guesses?

237
00:14:57.381 --> 00:14:58.441
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I had to do that.

238
00:14:58.441 --> 00:15:04.219
So you just instead doing .append,
you use the same old text content equals.

239
00:15:04.219 --> 00:15:08.402
&gt;&gt; Right, so now we can just say,
I totally messed up,

240
00:15:08.402 --> 00:15:10.886
I wanna change this entirely.

241
00:15:10.886 --> 00:15:15.949
Or maybe I wanna put it back to what
it was before, a game you know?

242
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:18.594
And maybe I just wanna
temper it a little bit.

243
00:15:18.594 --> 00:15:21.229
I only like it, don't love it.

244
00:15:21.229 --> 00:15:25.870
[LAUGH] So yeah,
this is how we would have to do that.

245
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:31.150
There's not a kind of a quick
reverse operation kind of thing.

246
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:36.670
These changes that we've made to the page,
so now for example, the title is my page.

247
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.939
The player O comes first,
the subtitle is different.

248
00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.984
The names are different,
all of this stuff.

249
00:15:44.282 --> 00:15:48.979
These changes, They take place.

250
00:15:48.979 --> 00:15:53.807
They're things that I have carried
out inside of this browser tab

251
00:15:53.807 --> 00:15:55.922
in the JavaScript console.

252
00:15:55.922 --> 00:16:02.658
So what do you think is gonna happen when,
let's say, I refresh this page?

253
00:16:02.658 --> 00:16:07.667
Am I gonna get the new
content that we have here, or

254
00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:12.931
the old content that it had
originally if I refresh?

255
00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:14.165
Guesses?

256
00:16:14.165 --> 00:16:15.280
Sorry.
&gt;&gt; Old content.

257
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.883
&gt;&gt; Old content is the guess.

258
00:16:16.883 --> 00:16:17.460
Let us check.

259
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.982
Indeed, it has all gone away.

260
00:16:20.982 --> 00:16:22.830
All of my work lost.

261
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.315
[LAUGH] It's very sad.

262
00:16:25.315 --> 00:16:30.143
Because all of these changes,
these are happening inside of

263
00:16:30.143 --> 00:16:34.972
this particular document object
that I have here in my page,

264
00:16:34.972 --> 00:16:38.492
and that changes every
time I load the page.

265
00:16:38.492 --> 00:16:42.585
So, these changes are not what
we would call persistent,

266
00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:46.607
because if I reload the page,
it's gonna be different.

267
00:16:46.607 --> 00:16:49.976
If somebody else loads the same
page from the same URL,

268
00:16:49.976 --> 00:16:52.623
they're gonna see something different.

269
00:16:52.623 --> 00:17:00.548
If let's say I changed
the document title to New title,

270
00:17:00.548 --> 00:17:05.773
if I now even go into a separate tab and

271
00:17:05.773 --> 00:17:09.329
load the exact same URL,

272
00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:16.625
We'll notice it has the old title, even
in just a different tab, same browser.

273
00:17:16.625 --> 00:17:20.801
That's because each time
the browser loads the page,

274
00:17:20.801 --> 00:17:24.627
it creates a new model of
what is in this document.

275
00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:29.257
And that is going to be generated from
whatever the source code of that page

276
00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:32.553
is that it finds when it goes
to the URL for this page.

277
00:17:32.553 --> 00:17:35.524
We're gonna look at
editing a file itself so

278
00:17:35.524 --> 00:17:39.539
that we can make sure that
the changes that we're making and

279
00:17:39.539 --> 00:17:44.601
the things that we're doing are not
just happening in this ephemeral state

280
00:17:44.601 --> 00:17:49.286
of the one time that we loaded this
page in our browser in this one tab.

281
00:17:49.286 --> 00:17:52.874
So that we can actually create
a page that we can later, maybe,

282
00:17:52.874 --> 00:17:57.227
post on our website so everybody gets
to see our beautiful JavaScript work.

283
00:17:57.227 --> 00:18:00.703
Or something that we can
reload in our own browser and

284
00:18:00.703 --> 00:18:03.788
see the things that we
wanted to be different.

285
00:18:03.788 --> 00:18:08.741
So that is a great point that Paul
had made earlier in the break and

286
00:18:08.741 --> 00:18:11.421
just wanted to raise with you all.
