1
00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:03.255
Welcome, my name is Anjana Vakil.

2
00:00:03.255 --> 00:00:08.342
And hopefully you are in the right place,
if you're here to talk about JavaScript.

3
00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:11.397
So this course is JavaScript First Steps.

4
00:00:11.397 --> 00:00:16.844
We are here at the amazing
FrontendMasters HQ in Minneapolis.

5
00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:19.921
And some of us are dialing in
from all over the place, and

6
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:22.748
some of us are tuning in to
the video course at home.

7
00:00:22.748 --> 00:00:27.384
So welcome, everybody,
wherever you are joining us from.

8
00:00:27.384 --> 00:00:32.474
As I said, my name is Anjana, and
you can find the materials for

9
00:00:32.474 --> 00:00:37.965
this course online at
anjane.dev/javascript-first-steps.

10
00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:42.641
So that is where you will find all
of the examples and the slides,

11
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:44.988
if you'd like to follow along.

12
00:00:44.988 --> 00:00:48.705
One of the aims of this course is to
provide a really solid foundation,

13
00:00:48.705 --> 00:00:51.225
whether you're coming
from other languages or

14
00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:55.707
whether you're brand new to programming,
which I want this also be accessible to.

15
00:00:55.707 --> 00:00:59.881
This course should hopefully stand
you in good stead to go on and

16
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:04.608
keep digging deeper in other courses
on the rest of Frontend Masters and

17
00:01:04.608 --> 00:01:07.307
whatever other platforms you learn on.

18
00:01:07.307 --> 00:01:13.444
So this course, it's called JavaScript
First Steps, and that indicates that

19
00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:19.503
this is not going to teach you everything
that has ever existed in JavaScript.

20
00:01:19.503 --> 00:01:24.750
This is not going to be an experience
where after this time together,

21
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.379
we are done learning JavaScript.

22
00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:28.463
That's not the case.

23
00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:33.699
Learning JavaScript, as with learning
anything, is really an infinite process.

24
00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:36.265
This is a lifelong thing.

25
00:01:36.265 --> 00:01:39.708
And that is true of
JavaScript in particular,

26
00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:42.896
because JavaScript is a living language.

27
00:01:42.896 --> 00:01:47.978
JavaScript, just like English or whatever
other languages we speak in the human

28
00:01:47.978 --> 00:01:53.297
natural language world, JavaScript
evolves, JavaScript is always developing.

29
00:01:53.297 --> 00:01:57.891
Just like we have new slang dropping every
year, JavaScript also has new features

30
00:01:57.891 --> 00:02:00.834
coming out,
changes to the way the language works.

31
00:02:00.834 --> 00:02:05.251
So by the time you would be done learning
JavaScript, it would already be different.

32
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:09.676
So this is really intended to
be kind of a jumping off point.

33
00:02:09.676 --> 00:02:13.173
What we're gonna try to do
is lay some foundations,

34
00:02:13.173 --> 00:02:18.020
set some really solid principles and
kind of mental models in our minds,

35
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.523
that can help us then go on and continue
this infinite lifelong learning journey.

36
00:02:23.523 --> 00:02:28.084
The way that we're going to try
to focus our attention in this

37
00:02:28.084 --> 00:02:32.913
course is through a few projects,
because I think that is the way

38
00:02:32.913 --> 00:02:37.400
often we can really understand
how to apply our knowledge.

39
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.218
And that brings up a distinction
in learning that I just wanted to

40
00:02:40.218 --> 00:02:41.063
mention quickly.

41
00:02:41.063 --> 00:02:45.876
Which is that sometimes in classrooms,
we have to learn things, facts about

42
00:02:45.876 --> 00:02:50.632
the world that we just have to memorize,
just in case we ever need that fact.

43
00:02:50.632 --> 00:02:53.909
Like we're on Who Wants to be
a Millionaire, and somebody asks,

44
00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.616
what year France invaded England,
William the Conqueror or something.

45
00:02:57.616 --> 00:03:00.336
But I learned that in school, and
no one has ever asked me that.

46
00:03:00.336 --> 00:03:03.353
I've never actually needed
that piece of information.

47
00:03:03.353 --> 00:03:07.526
So instead, what we're probably going to
focus more time on in this course is what

48
00:03:07.526 --> 00:03:09.706
you could call just-in-time learning.

49
00:03:09.706 --> 00:03:12.290
So when we're trying to do something and

50
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.928
we wanna learn what we need at that
point in time in order to do that thing.

51
00:03:16.928 --> 00:03:21.414
There's gonna be a little bit of a mix
of both, but we're going to be trying to

52
00:03:21.414 --> 00:03:26.055
focus on the practical needs that we have,
and learning things as we need them.

53
00:03:26.055 --> 00:03:26.778
Yeah?

54
00:03:26.778 --> 00:03:31.749
&gt;&gt; Someone in chat wants to know how
Anjana discovered JavaScript and

55
00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:33.363
why you liked it.

56
00:03:33.363 --> 00:03:36.274
&gt;&gt; How did I discover JavaScript and
why do I like it?

57
00:03:36.274 --> 00:03:38.499
That is a great question,
thank you for asking.

58
00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:41.328
I discovered JavaScript,
so a little bit about me,

59
00:03:41.328 --> 00:03:44.491
I don't have a traditional
computer science education.

60
00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:46.661
I studied philosophy and linguistics and

61
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:49.079
things like that before
I got into computers.

62
00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.717
And I got into the software industry,

63
00:03:51.717 --> 00:03:55.846
now I work as a software developer and
developer advocate.

64
00:03:55.846 --> 00:04:01.010
I got into the industry through a really
great community called the Recurse Center,

65
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.820
in New York.

66
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.961
Recurse.com Is a website I love,
where you can read all about this place.

67
00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:09.789
It is a community and programming retreat,

68
00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:13.313
kind of like a writer's retreat but
for programmers.

69
00:04:13.313 --> 00:04:16.995
And so when I was there in 2015,
I decided,

70
00:04:16.995 --> 00:04:21.875
because I saw a bunch of my batchmates,
my co-participants,

71
00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:27.509
doing cool things with JavaScript,
I decided I really wanted to dig in.

72
00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.266
And so that is where I kind
of got exposed to JavaScript.

73
00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:34.218
And then I also found out about this
thing called functional programming,

74
00:04:34.218 --> 00:04:35.668
which you might have seen.

75
00:04:35.668 --> 00:04:40.258
I also have a course on Frontend Masters
called Functional Programming First Steps.

76
00:04:40.258 --> 00:04:44.656
And I found that JavaScript actually
worked really nicely with the functional

77
00:04:44.656 --> 00:04:49.252
programming paradigm, which I also learned
from some of my co-participants and

78
00:04:49.252 --> 00:04:51.401
facilitators at the Recurse Center.

79
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:54.412
And so that's how I kind of
fell in love with JavaScript,

80
00:04:54.412 --> 00:04:57.951
because I found it through kind
of a functional programming lens.

81
00:04:57.951 --> 00:05:02.306
So we're not gonna talk a ton about
functional programming, or much at all,

82
00:05:02.306 --> 00:05:04.919
really, in this course,
but it is, I think,

83
00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.610
a really great partner for JavaScript,
is the functional programming paradigm.

84
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.374
And so one of the hopes of this course is
that you also, by the end of this course,

85
00:05:14.374 --> 00:05:19.285
will have the tools you need to go on and
start learning functional programming and

86
00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:20.800
related technologies.

87
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.442
Things like frameworks like React,
which are very inspired by functional

88
00:05:25.442 --> 00:05:30.686
programming principles, and other
technologies like TypeScript, for example.

89
00:05:30.686 --> 00:05:35.174
So I think that that is sort of what
inspired me to get into JavaScript.

90
00:05:35.174 --> 00:05:40.422
And I hope that after this course, you
all might be interested in going on and

91
00:05:40.422 --> 00:05:43.789
learning more about that
side of things as well.
