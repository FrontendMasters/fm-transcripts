00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.729
Welcome, my name is Anjana Vakil and

2
00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:08.551
hopefully you are in the right place if
you're here to talk about JavaScript.

3
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:13.034
So this course is JavaScript First Steps,
we are here at the amazing

4
00:00:13.034 --> 00:00:17.676
FrontendMasters HQ in Minneapolis,
and some of us are dialing in from

5
00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:22.653
all over the place, and some of us
are tuning in to the video course at home.

6
00:00:22.653 --> 00:00:27.460
So welcome everybody,
wherever you're joining us from.

7
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.604
As I said, my name is Anjana, and
you can find the materials for

8
00:00:32.604 --> 00:00:38.157
this course online at
anjana.dev/javascript-first-steps.

9
00:00:38.157 --> 00:00:41.947
So that is where you will
find all of the examples and

10
00:00:41.947 --> 00:00:45.135
the slides if you'd like to follow along.

11
00:00:45.135 --> 00:00:49.151
One of the aims of this course is to
provide a really solid foundation whether

12
00:00:49.151 --> 00:00:53.546
you're coming from other languages or
whether you're brand new to programming,

13
00:00:53.546 --> 00:00:55.823
which I want this to
also be accessible to.

14
00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:59.958
This course should hopefully stand
you in good stead to go on and

15
00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:04.639
keep digging deeper in other courses
on the rest of frontendmasters and

16
00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:07.307
whatever other platforms you learn on.

17
00:01:07.307 --> 00:01:13.246
So this course it's called JavaScript
first steps and that indicates that

18
00:01:13.246 --> 00:01:19.480
this is not going to teach you everything
that has ever existed in JavaScript.

19
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.698
This is not going to be an experience
where after this time together

20
00:01:24.698 --> 00:01:29.180
we are done learning JavaScript,
that's not the case.

21
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.644
Learning JavaScript,
as with learning anything,

22
00:01:32.644 --> 00:01:36.509
is really an infinite process,
this is a lifelong thing.

23
00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.863
And that is true of
JavaScript in particular,

24
00:01:39.863 --> 00:01:42.965
because JavaScript is a living language.

25
00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:48.069
JavaScript, just like English or whatever
other languages we speak in the human

26
00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:53.410
natural language world, JavaScript
evolves, JavaScript is always developing.

27
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.949
Just like we have new slang dropping every
year, JavaScript also has new features

28
00:01:57.949 --> 00:02:00.862
coming out,
changes to the way the language works.

29
00:02:00.862 --> 00:02:05.272
So by the time you would be done learning
JavaScript, it would already be different.

30
00:02:05.272 --> 00:02:09.592
So this is really intended to
be kind of a jumping off point.

31
00:02:09.592 --> 00:02:14.614
What we're gonna try to do is lay some
foundations, set some really solid

32
00:02:14.614 --> 00:02:19.879
principles and kind of mental models in
our minds that can help us then go on and

33
00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.529
continue this infinite
lifelong learning journey.

34
00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:28.760
The way that we're going to try to focus
our attention in this course is through

35
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.071
a few projects, we will have accomplished
something in the real world because I

36
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:39.645
think that's the way often we could really
understand how to apply our knowledge.

37
00:02:39.645 --> 00:02:43.671
And that brings up a distinction in
learning that I just wanted to mention

38
00:02:43.671 --> 00:02:47.763
quickly which is that, sometimes in
classrooms we have to learn things,

39
00:02:47.763 --> 00:02:50.677
facts about the world that
we just have to memorize.

40
00:02:50.677 --> 00:02:55.109
Just in case we ever need that fact, like
we're on who wants to be a Millionaire and

41
00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.095
somebody asked what year France invaded
England William the Conqueror or

42
00:02:59.095 --> 00:02:59.819
something.

43
00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.912
But I learned that in school and
no one has ever asked me that,

44
00:03:02.912 --> 00:03:05.837
I've never actually needed
that piece of information.

45
00:03:05.837 --> 00:03:09.667
So instead what we're probably going to
focus more our time on in this course is

46
00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:12.002
what you could call just-in-time learning.

47
00:03:12.002 --> 00:03:14.625
So when we're trying to do something and

48
00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:19.345
we wanna learn what we need at that
point in time in order to do that thing.

49
00:03:19.345 --> 00:03:22.429
There's gonna be a little
bit of a mix of both, but

50
00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:26.689
we're gonna be trying to focus on
the practical needs that we have and

51
00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:31.214
learning things as we need them, yeah
&gt;&gt; Someone in chat wants to know

52
00:03:31.214 --> 00:03:35.460
how Anjana discovered JavaScript and
why you liked it?

53
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.519
&gt;&gt; How did I discover JavaScript and
why do I like it?

54
00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.631
That is a great question thank you for
asking, I discovered JavaScript so

55
00:03:42.631 --> 00:03:47.008
a little bit about me I don't have
a traditional computer science education,

56
00:03:47.008 --> 00:03:49.331
I studied philosophy and linguistics and

57
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:51.939
things like that before
I got into computers.

58
00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:56.785
And I got into the software industry
now I work as a software developer and

59
00:03:56.785 --> 00:03:58.305
developer advocate.

60
00:03:58.305 --> 00:04:02.375
I got into the industry through
a really great community called

61
00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:04.447
the Recurse Center in New York,

62
00:04:04.447 --> 00:04:09.154
recurse.com is a website I love where
you can read all about this place.

63
00:04:09.154 --> 00:04:12.266
It is a community and programming retreat,

64
00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:15.721
kinda a writer's retreat but
for programmers.

65
00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:22.496
And so when I was there in 2015, I decided
because I saw a bunch of my batchmates,

66
00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:26.984
my co participants doing
cool things with JavaScript,

67
00:04:26.984 --> 00:04:29.856
I decided I really wanted to dig in.

68
00:04:29.856 --> 00:04:34.039
And so that is where I kind of got exposed
to JavaScript, and then I also found out

69
00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:38.098
about this thing called functional
programming, which you might have seen I

70
00:04:38.098 --> 00:04:42.549
also have a course on front end masters
called functional programming first steps.

71
00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:47.153
And I found that JavaScript was actually
worked really nicely with the functional

72
00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:51.623
programming paradigm, which I also learned
from some of my co participants and

73
00:04:51.623 --> 00:04:53.776
facilitators at the Recurse Center.

74
00:04:53.776 --> 00:04:57.115
And so that is where that's how I
kinda fell in love with JavaScript,

75
00:04:57.115 --> 00:05:00.354
because I found it through kind
of a functional programming lens.

76
00:05:00.354 --> 00:05:04.087
So we're not gonna talk a ton
about functional programming or

77
00:05:04.087 --> 00:05:08.677
much at all really in this course, but
it is I think a really great partner for

78
00:05:08.677 --> 00:05:12.016
JavaScript is the functional
programming paradigm.

79
00:05:12.016 --> 00:05:16.602
And so one of the hopes of this course is
that, you also by the end of this course,

80
00:05:16.602 --> 00:05:21.462
we'll have the tools you need to go on and
start learning functional programming and

81
00:05:21.462 --> 00:05:22.908
related technologies.

82
00:05:22.908 --> 00:05:27.424
Things like frameworks like react
which are very inspired by functional

83
00:05:27.424 --> 00:05:32.543
programming principles and other
technologies like TypeScript, for example.

84
00:05:32.543 --> 00:05:36.324
So I think that is sort of what
inspired me to get into JavaScript and

85
00:05:36.324 --> 00:05:40.307
I hope that after this course you all
might be interested in going on and

86
00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:43.093
learning more about that
side of things as well.
