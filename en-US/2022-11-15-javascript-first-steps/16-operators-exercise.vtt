WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.062 --> 00:00:03.763
Okay, so what we're gonna
do right now is some math.

2
00:00:03.763 --> 00:00:07.160
Yeah, we love math, everybody loves math.

3
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.548
[LAUGH] What we're gonna do
is just try out some of these

4
00:00:11.548 --> 00:00:15.460
arithmetic operators to
compute a few things.

5
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.337
The total number of
siblings of your parents,

6
00:00:18.337 --> 00:00:23.220
however, many parents you may have,
how many siblings do they have in total?

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.539
This is a question that only you and
JavaScript can answer.

8
00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.083
How about the average number of
hours that you slept this week?

9
00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:37.849
So let's say, this week is the last
seven days, so you can guess to me.

10
00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:42.304
I'm not gonna like no [LAUGH], and
then another question is how would you

11
00:00:42.304 --> 00:00:46.924
calculate assuming the average number
of hours that you slept this week?

12
00:00:46.924 --> 00:00:51.615
How would you estimate the number
of dogs you'd pet in a week if you

13
00:00:51.615 --> 00:00:55.302
could pet 1 dog per hour
during your waking hours?

14
00:00:55.302 --> 00:00:59.877
So we're just gonna try out some of
our arithmetic operators in order to

15
00:00:59.877 --> 00:01:03.782
compute these very important
facts about our lives, okay?

16
00:01:03.782 --> 00:01:06.484
Let's take a moment, try it out, and
then we'll talk about it together.

17
00:01:15.613 --> 00:01:21.561
Okey-doke, we're back and we've done
some math, so let's talk about it.

18
00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:24.034
All right, the total number
of siblings of your parents.

19
00:01:24.034 --> 00:01:28.558
Now, obviously, we're all gonna
have different answers to this,

20
00:01:28.558 --> 00:01:32.775
but you probably used which
operator in computing this answer?

21
00:01:35.316 --> 00:01:36.247
&gt;&gt; Plus sign.

22
00:01:36.247 --> 00:01:43.216
&gt;&gt; Plus, yes, plus version, so here, for
example, for me, I have two parents.

23
00:01:43.216 --> 00:01:50.704
Well, my mom had one brother and
my dad had two siblings.

24
00:01:50.704 --> 00:01:56.494
So together, they have three siblings,
so I have three aunts and uncles.

25
00:01:56.494 --> 00:02:00.998
Let's say, and y'all probably had
different things, maybe you have, I don't

26
00:02:00.998 --> 00:02:05.447
know, other folks in your family, but
the plus operator is what we needed here.

27
00:02:05.447 --> 00:02:10.556
Okay, how about the average number
of hours you slept this week?

28
00:02:10.556 --> 00:02:14.042
Now, there could be a few different
operators we might need to use for this.

29
00:02:14.042 --> 00:02:20.456
But when we talk about averages,
we're usually gonna use at some point,

30
00:02:20.456 --> 00:02:26.778
a certain operator to find out the average
over a certain amount of time.

31
00:02:26.778 --> 00:02:30.998
So for example,
if there's 7 days per week,

32
00:02:30.998 --> 00:02:35.219
I'm gonna take whatever
total hours slept and

33
00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:40.757
probably use which operator to
get the average over 7 days.

34
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.989
&gt;&gt; Division.

35
00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.801
&gt;&gt; Division, exactly, so this slash.

36
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:49.783
Okay, now, this is not a thing, cuz I
don't have a total number of hours slept.

37
00:02:49.783 --> 00:02:55.135
But maybe I have that in parentheses,
the number of hours that I slept each day.

38
00:02:55.135 --> 00:02:56.739
Now, this is obviously not correct,

39
00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.804
because I never get eight
hours of sleep a night.

40
00:02:58.804 --> 00:03:03.515
But let's assume that I get
eight hours of sleep a night,

41
00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:08.630
I could do something like 8
+ 8 + 8 + etc., seven times.

42
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.115
Yeah, it's one way I could do it,

43
00:03:13.115 --> 00:03:16.525
or I could maybe do 8 x 7.

44
00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:19.149
Now, this isn't a very
exciting math problem, right,

45
00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:21.511
cuz I'm multiplying by 7 and
then dividing by 7.

46
00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:24.213
We know that this would come out to be 8,
which, again, is a fictional number.

47
00:03:24.213 --> 00:03:27.064
But it is not [LAUGH] the correct
answer for me anyway.

48
00:03:27.064 --> 00:03:30.137
But I hope it's true for
you all, cuz sleep is important.

49
00:03:30.137 --> 00:03:33.080
Point is we might be using addition,
we might be using multiplication.

50
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.108
And then eventually to get an average,

51
00:03:35.108 --> 00:03:38.557
we're usually gonna use some kind
of division, you get the idea.

52
00:03:38.557 --> 00:03:40.432
All right, so how about our dog hours?

53
00:03:40.432 --> 00:03:43.095
If y'all are dog people like me, if not,

54
00:03:43.095 --> 00:03:48.286
maybe you don't wanna pet one dog per hour
maybe you wanna pet zero dogs per hour.

55
00:03:48.286 --> 00:03:53.778
But in this case, let's talk through it,
let's sort of teamwork this.

56
00:03:53.778 --> 00:03:59.674
How can we compute the number of
dogs I'd pet in a week, seven days,

57
00:03:59.674 --> 00:04:05.273
if I pet 1 dog per hour assuming
that I sleep eight hours a night?

58
00:04:05.273 --> 00:04:07.683
So how can we compute this?

59
00:04:07.683 --> 00:04:13.004
So maybe we start by calculating the
number of hours per day that I'm awake.

60
00:04:13.004 --> 00:04:17.731
If I sleep 8 hours a night,
[LAUGH] what operator could I use to

61
00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:23.014
figure out the number of hours I'm
awake if I sleep 8 hours a night,

62
00:04:23.014 --> 00:04:25.626
and there's 24 hours in a day?

63
00:04:27.463 --> 00:04:29.202
Could be like-
&gt;&gt; Minus sign.

64
00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:29.809
&gt;&gt; Sorry?

65
00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:30.740
&gt;&gt; Minus sign.

66
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.568
&gt;&gt; 24-8 would give me, okay, so

67
00:04:34.568 --> 00:04:38.794
I have 16 dog petting hours per day.

68
00:04:38.794 --> 00:04:41.466
And then,
I'm gonna pet how many dogs per hour?

69
00:04:41.466 --> 00:04:43.461
So that's gonna need which operator?

70
00:04:43.461 --> 00:04:48.518
If I have a number of dogs per hour, Like-
&gt;&gt; 1?

71
00:04:48.518 --> 00:04:53.261
&gt;&gt; Times, right, so star for
multiply, times 1 dog per hour.

72
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:58.202
Maybe I can really up my dog petting
ratio and pet a dog every half an hour,

73
00:04:58.202 --> 00:05:02.258
or depends on the density of
dogs in my neighborhood, etc.

74
00:05:02.258 --> 00:05:05.211
But let's say, times 1, and so

75
00:05:05.211 --> 00:05:11.028
that is going to be then the number
of dogs that I could pet in a day.

76
00:05:11.028 --> 00:05:16.207
And then if I wanna get the number
of dogs I could pet in a week,

77
00:05:16.207 --> 00:05:21.808
I can add, well, sorry,
I can extend my math here with times 7.

78
00:05:21.808 --> 00:05:27.066
And when we say times,
we mean star 7, 112 dogs.

79
00:05:27.066 --> 00:05:31.424
Wow, I actually have no idea if
that's sounds like a lot of dogs.

80
00:05:31.424 --> 00:05:35.170
I would be really happy if I
could pet 112 dogs a week.

81
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.095
[LAUGH] Okay, but the point is,
what we have here is an example of

82
00:05:36.095 --> 00:05:36.608
we need to use those parentheses.

83
00:05:36.608 --> 00:05:42.108
Because otherwise, if I didn't

84
00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:47.216
have these parentheses here,

85
00:05:47.216 --> 00:05:50.562
what would happen?

86
00:05:50.562 --> 00:05:53.648
What would happen first
in JavaScript's brain?

87
00:05:53.648 --> 00:05:55.283
&gt;&gt; 8 times 1.

88
00:05:55.283 --> 00:05:58.563
&gt;&gt; 8 times 1 would happen first, so
I would get a totally different number.

89
00:05:58.563 --> 00:05:59.651
Negative 32 dogs?

90
00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:04.890
Unacceptable, unacceptable,
I'm not gonna give back dog pets, no.

91
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.083
So the point is parentheses,
we need them, they're our friends,

92
00:06:08.083 --> 00:06:09.995
they show up all the time in JavaScript.

93
00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:12.909
Okay, any questions about math?

94
00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.668
[LAUGH] Please don't make them hard.

95
00:06:15.668 --> 00:06:20.621
We had a great question actually in the
room which was about some other operators.

96
00:06:20.621 --> 00:06:23.552
So folks might have found out,
I don't know,

97
00:06:23.552 --> 00:06:27.471
maybe I want to exponentially
grow my dog petting abilities.

98
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:31.135
And I want to raise a number
to a certain exponent or

99
00:06:31.135 --> 00:06:35.162
to a certain power, and
what is the operator for that?

100
00:06:35.162 --> 00:06:40.848
Or maybe I find that there's some
other symbol in my keyboard and

101
00:06:40.848 --> 00:06:43.285
I don't know what it does.

102
00:06:43.285 --> 00:06:50.188
Let's say, for example,
the percent symbol, what does that do?

103
00:06:50.188 --> 00:06:51.708
I don't know, let's find out.

104
00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:52.996
How do we find out?

105
00:06:52.996 --> 00:07:00.371
We go to MDN, and if I type in operator,
I should get to this.

106
00:07:00.371 --> 00:07:03.675
For example, there's this page,
a reference of all the expressions and

107
00:07:03.675 --> 00:07:04.908
operators in JavaScript.

108
00:07:04.908 --> 00:07:07.788
This is a long page, long page, but

109
00:07:07.788 --> 00:07:13.068
if I'm curious about a particular
operation, I can do Ctrl+F or

110
00:07:13.068 --> 00:07:18.357
Cmd+F to find something in
the page like exponent, let's say.

111
00:07:18.357 --> 00:07:21.928
Maybe if I spell it right,
okay, it'll show me, okay,

112
00:07:21.928 --> 00:07:24.350
here's this exponentiation operator.

113
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.714
And that shows me that, it turns
out that if I wanna raise a number

114
00:07:27.714 --> 00:07:31.551
to another number to the power of another
number, I can use double asterisks.

115
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:37.800
That is a valid operator in JavaScript for
exponentiation.

116
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.798
And likewise, if I want to find out
what is that percentage sign do,

117
00:07:42.798 --> 00:07:48.169
I can control or Cmd+F, search in
the page, look for the percent sign.

118
00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:51.906
I find that it highlights
this remainder operator.

119
00:07:51.906 --> 00:07:57.369
And then this will tell me, okay,
this percent sign, which we sometimes also

120
00:07:57.369 --> 00:08:02.854
call modulo returns the remainder leftover
when you divide one number by another.

121
00:08:02.854 --> 00:08:07.638
So there's a whole bunch
more operators out there,

122
00:08:07.638 --> 00:08:10.799
you can always look them up in MDN.
