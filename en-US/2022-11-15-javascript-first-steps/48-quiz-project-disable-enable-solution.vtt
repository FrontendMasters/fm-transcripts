WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.157 --> 00:00:02.791
So how did this go, these functions?

2
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.445
What we've got here we've
got two to do [LAUGH].

3
00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:16.440
We can start with the disable and
enable functions.

4
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.131
Now, this is tricky because I asked
you to set a button element attribute.

5
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:27.154
And I haven't really told you
what the spell is to change

6
00:00:27.154 --> 00:00:30.850
the attribute on an HTML element yet.

7
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.923
So let's go back to our console and

8
00:00:34.923 --> 00:00:42.656
I'm gonna go into the console in
my in-progress quiz game here.

9
00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:47.808
Did anybody figure out how to
set an attribute to a certain

10
00:00:47.808 --> 00:00:54.695
value on a JavaScript, sorry,
on an element in the DOM with JavaScript?

11
00:00:57.461 --> 00:01:01.023
&gt;&gt; I tried documengetsElementsByName.

12
00:01:01.023 --> 00:01:04.075
&gt;&gt; Okay, so first we're gonna need
an element to do something to, right?

13
00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:11.465
So we could try,
let I'm just gonna grab a button here.

14
00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:15.054
I'm gonna say document.

15
00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:20.163
So you said getElementsByName?

16
00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:22.333
&gt;&gt; Yeah, true, yep.

17
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:26.050
ByName and quotes true.

18
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.927
&gt;&gt; Okay, so true.

19
00:01:26.927 --> 00:01:34.461
So this is gonna now,
this gives me a list of one button.

20
00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:39.083
So I could say,
let's say b is gonna be button 0.

21
00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:41.015
Maybe named that array, [INAUDIBLE].

22
00:01:41.015 --> 00:01:42.185
So now b is an element.

23
00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:46.147
Now the thing is,
in our function that we're gonna write,

24
00:01:46.147 --> 00:01:50.586
we're not gonna actually need to
pick out an element from the DOM,

25
00:01:50.586 --> 00:01:55.127
because we want our disabled function
to take in the button itself.

26
00:01:55.127 --> 00:01:58.673
So we're gonna pass in as
an argument to our function

27
00:01:58.673 --> 00:02:02.390
an element that we're then
gonna set an attribute in.

28
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.232
All right, but for now just so

29
00:02:04.232 --> 00:02:09.038
that we have something to work with I've
got my b element here in the console.

30
00:02:09.038 --> 00:02:15.955
So the question is, how can I set
an attribute on this element?

31
00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:17.668
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sorry.

32
00:02:17.668 --> 00:02:19.592
&gt;&gt; Chat there [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; So

33
00:02:19.592 --> 00:02:25.655
there is actually a method on these
elements called SetAttribute.

34
00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:27.391
And the way it works and

35
00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:31.877
maybe this is also in the chat
is something we can find out.

36
00:02:31.877 --> 00:02:34.928
If we were to, let's say I didn't
know that setAttribute existed,

37
00:02:34.928 --> 00:02:36.200
because I didn't, right?

38
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.484
Just a minute ago, we hadn't seen it yet.

39
00:02:39.484 --> 00:02:43.342
If I type setAttribute into MDN.

40
00:02:43.342 --> 00:02:45.414
Look at that, I have a few options here.

41
00:02:45.414 --> 00:02:48.000
Let's check out this first one,
setAttribute.

42
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Sets the value of an attribute
on the specified element, great.

43
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.148
If the attribute already exists,

44
00:02:55.148 --> 00:02:58.710
the value is updated otherwise
a new attribute is added.

45
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.837
And we see that its syntax is we
give it the name of the attribute

46
00:03:04.837 --> 00:03:10.206
that we wanna se to set, and
then the value that we wanna set it to.

47
00:03:10.206 --> 00:03:12.589
So let's say that I I'm.

48
00:03:15.806 --> 00:03:18.370
Let's look at my b element.

49
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.261
So, we see it has whoa, okay.

50
00:03:22.261 --> 00:03:23.830
That's too much, too much info.

51
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.425
Let's look at b, we see it has a name
attribute to the value of true and

52
00:03:28.425 --> 00:03:31.369
a value that also is set
to the value of true.

53
00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:34.171
So if I wanted to,
let's say rename this button,

54
00:03:34.171 --> 00:03:36.460
I could use the SetAttribute function.

55
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.207
This is not what I asked you to
write in your disable function.

56
00:03:39.207 --> 00:03:41.847
But just as an example,

57
00:03:41.847 --> 00:03:47.527
I could say set the attribute
name to anjana [LAUGH].

58
00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:53.655
So now if I look at b, I see that
I have changed the attribute name,

59
00:03:53.655 --> 00:03:57.785
I've changed its value from the original.

60
00:03:57.785 --> 00:04:04.092
Okay, but what I really wanna
do is disable this button.

61
00:04:04.092 --> 00:04:08.974
Now, in HTML I'm gonna
inspect this element.

62
00:04:08.974 --> 00:04:14.750
There is an attribute that we can use to
disable a button that is called disabled.

63
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.439
And if I set that button, do you see?

64
00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:21.962
It's a little bit hard to see here,
but this button is now grayed out and

65
00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:26.010
I can't click on it the way I can
click on the false button now.

66
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.738
So you've probably seen this
before on websites, right?

67
00:04:28.738 --> 00:04:33.048
Where the submit button is disabled until
you've filled out all of the required

68
00:04:33.048 --> 00:04:35.760
fields in the form or
something like that, yeah?

69
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.662
Now, we'll notice that
when I enter disabled,

70
00:04:39.662 --> 00:04:44.238
it put the value of disabled
as being equal to something.

71
00:04:44.238 --> 00:04:46.871
And the thing is that could be whatever,
so I could say,

72
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:49.710
disabled equals true and
the button is disabled.

73
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.630
But confusingly and this is a question
that came up so I want to address it.

74
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.796
If I let's say say disabled false you
might expect alright well if disabled

75
00:04:59.796 --> 00:05:04.962
is false then surely the button is
enabled but let's see what happens it's

76
00:05:04.962 --> 00:05:10.374
still disabled because the thing is the
browser is looking at does the disabled

77
00:05:10.374 --> 00:05:15.311
attribute exist on this button it does
not care about what its value is.

78
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:19.737
So what we do is if we
want to enable the button,

79
00:05:19.737 --> 00:05:23.824
we have to remove the attribute entirely.

80
00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:26.350
And once we've done that I
get my click ability back.

81
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.873
So this is just some tricky stuff I just
threw at you to keep you on your toes but

82
00:05:33.873 --> 00:05:39.320
we can set this disabled attribute
now with our new friend setAttribute.

83
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.160
So if I were to do this on my b
button we're not doing a function yet

84
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.480
we're just manipulating this
one button this one time.

85
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.266
I could call setAttribute disabled.

86
00:05:52.266 --> 00:05:57.550
And we said we don't care about
the value of the attribute but

87
00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:04.610
what happens if I try to do setAttribute
disabled with no other thing is an error.

88
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.498
Now, this is because unlike this
regular JavaScript this is a special

89
00:06:06.498 --> 00:06:08.804
method which has some extra guide rules in
place to make sure I'm using it correctly.

90
00:06:08.804 --> 00:06:13.580
Like we said before JavaScript
doesn't care if I pass in all

91
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.787
the arguments that I need.

92
00:06:15.787 --> 00:06:20.372
But whoever implemented this
function made sure to throw

93
00:06:20.372 --> 00:06:24.201
an error to let me know
that I'm doing it wrong.

94
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:27.290
So that's where we wanna
pass in some kind of value.

95
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.356
And that value doesn't really
matter it could be any string.

96
00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:35.277
But just to indicate that it doesn't
matter, we could use an empty string.

97
00:06:35.277 --> 00:06:40.022
And now once I run this b.setAttribute,
disabled comma empty string.

98
00:06:40.022 --> 00:06:45.223
There goes the button it's disabled
now I can't click it anymore,

99
00:06:45.223 --> 00:06:47.331
like I can this one, okay?

100
00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:52.117
So this is essentially this
.setAttribute disabled, empty string.

101
00:06:52.117 --> 00:06:55.898
This is gonna do some heavy lifting here.

102
00:06:55.898 --> 00:06:58.767
So now we just need to functionify it.

103
00:06:59.914 --> 00:07:05.031
So can anyone walk me through
their solution to implement

104
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:10.138
a function called disable
that takes in a button?

105
00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:14.470
Let's think through it together.

106
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.232
Should we take a stab at it?

107
00:07:16.232 --> 00:07:17.548
&gt;&gt; Sure, so

108
00:07:17.548 --> 00:07:23.301
I did mine as a fat arrow function,
&gt;&gt; okay.

109
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:25.210
&gt;&gt; Const enable.

110
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.471
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's start with disabled.

111
00:07:26.471 --> 00:07:28.618
&gt;&gt; Disable, sorry.

112
00:07:28.618 --> 00:07:32.791
Const disable right equals.

113
00:07:32.791 --> 00:07:37.914
And then I just generic button.

114
00:07:37.914 --> 00:07:43.202
&gt;&gt; In parentheses button so that's what
we're going to name, our parameter.

115
00:07:43.202 --> 00:07:46.223
And it's gonna be like a button
element similar to the b

116
00:07:46.223 --> 00:07:49.070
that we had pulled out of the console,
okay?

117
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.790
&gt;&gt; Then the fat arrow.

118
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.241
&gt;&gt; Arrow.

119
00:07:51.241 --> 00:07:54.535
&gt;&gt; And then curly braces.

120
00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:04.933
Then it was just button.disabled

121
00:08:04.933 --> 00:08:09.248
equals empty string.

122
00:08:09.248 --> 00:08:15.605
&gt;&gt; Okay,
let's make sure that that also works.

123
00:08:15.605 --> 00:08:19.395
I'm going to, let's try this on,

124
00:08:22.823 --> 00:08:26.900
Okay, so b disabled here.

125
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:33.551
If we do disabled equals empty string,

126
00:08:33.551 --> 00:08:41.971
now b disabled is False.

127
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:49.650
Which is confusing,
because now the button is enabled.

128
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:54.440
So maybe we should try using
the setAttribute approach cuz

129
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.936
I'm a little bit unsure what
exactly is happening here

130
00:08:58.936 --> 00:09:03.740
because I don't know everything
about web development.

131
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.630
Mark, do you want to chime in?

132
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.752
&gt;&gt; It should work but
we should use setAttribute.

133
00:09:10.752 --> 00:09:15.287
&gt;&gt; Let's stick with setAttribute because
we know more predictably what that's

134
00:09:15.287 --> 00:09:16.420
gonna do.

135
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.691
So let's try button.setAttribute,

136
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.849
And the attribute we
wanna set is disabled.

137
00:09:26.849 --> 00:09:32.322
And then we wanna set it to just anything
at all but we'll use the empty string.

138
00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:35.739
So this is essentially
the same thing that we called

139
00:09:35.739 --> 00:09:39.952
before b.seAttribute disabled
whatever we're essentially

140
00:09:39.952 --> 00:09:44.738
just parameterizing the b part here
as button and making it a function.

141
00:09:44.738 --> 00:09:46.889
Cool?

142
00:09:46.889 --> 00:09:52.080
Great, okay.

143
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:59.261
Now, we wanna function enable, which is
going to remove the attribute entirely.

144
00:09:59.261 --> 00:10:01.331
And so, if we were to figure out.

145
00:10:01.331 --> 00:10:04.828
All right, how do we remove an attribute?

146
00:10:04.828 --> 00:10:07.760
Well, before we typed in, sorry.

147
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.135
So yeah, if we were to type in like,
hey MDN, how do I remove an attribute?

148
00:10:14.135 --> 00:10:18.836
Well, turns out similar to setAttribute,
there is a method on elements called

149
00:10:18.836 --> 00:10:22.695
remove attribute, which we just
pass in the attribute name, and

150
00:10:22.695 --> 00:10:25.770
then that removes the attribute entirely.

151
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.225
So here if I do, let's say b, okay,

152
00:10:29.225 --> 00:10:34.918
just wanna make sure that okay,
so this button is disabled.

153
00:10:34.918 --> 00:10:39.557
Okay, so b remove attribute
disabled is now going to take

154
00:10:39.557 --> 00:10:42.175
away that attribute entirely.

155
00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:47.496
So we don't even see it anymore and
the button is reenabled.

156
00:10:47.496 --> 00:10:48.900
Yeah, great.

157
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.801
Okay, excellent detective work.

158
00:10:50.801 --> 00:10:54.068
So now, do you wanna walk me
through functioning this?

159
00:10:54.068 --> 00:10:59.542
&gt;&gt; Cons, enabled, equals, parentheses,

160
00:10:59.542 --> 00:11:04.561
buttoned that arrow, button.remove

161
00:11:04.561 --> 00:11:09.435
attribute parentheses, disabled.

162
00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:10.450
&gt;&gt; Okay, great.

163
00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:17.461
So now we have a small difference between
the structure of the previous function and

164
00:11:17.461 --> 00:11:21.179
this one which is the curly braces, right?

165
00:11:21.179 --> 00:11:21.996
And in this case,

166
00:11:21.996 --> 00:11:25.542
functionally we're not gonna have like
In terms of how these are operating.

167
00:11:25.542 --> 00:11:29.427
We are not gonna have much
of a difference because

168
00:11:29.427 --> 00:11:33.136
neither of these function
returns anything.

169
00:11:33.136 --> 00:11:36.727
Both of these functions are carrying
out some other operation.

170
00:11:36.727 --> 00:11:40.999
So that's okay in this case, but if you
had a function where you did care about

171
00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:44.440
the return value,
just be mindful of those curly braces.

172
00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.285
Cuz that would mean you'd have to add
a return statement as we saw before,

173
00:11:49.285 --> 00:11:50.154
okay great.

174
00:11:54.646 --> 00:11:58.406
So now, let me reload,

175
00:11:58.406 --> 00:12:04.047
my local file and see if it updated.

176
00:12:04.047 --> 00:12:07.750
If it did,
then I should have a disable function.

177
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.351
Okay, great we didn't have that before.

178
00:12:10.351 --> 00:12:16.968
Now, we also had the option buttons
variable which we had declared earlier.

179
00:12:16.968 --> 00:12:18.770
So let's test it out.

180
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:24.520
How can I get the first button out
of my option buttons, quick review?

181
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.045
&gt;&gt; Options button 0.

182
00:12:27.045 --> 00:12:31.225
&gt;&gt; Option buttons square brackets 0,
right?

183
00:12:31.225 --> 00:12:32.575
Great, that picks out a button.

184
00:12:32.575 --> 00:12:37.545
Now, what if I pass that in to my
disable function, let's test it out and

185
00:12:37.545 --> 00:12:38.695
see if it works.

186
00:12:40.089 --> 00:12:41.160
The button grayed out.

187
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.521
It's hard to see maybe on the screen but
if you're trying this along with me,

188
00:12:45.521 --> 00:12:46.740
you should see that.

189
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.622
Yes, indeed this did disable the button.

190
00:12:49.622 --> 00:12:54.340
Now, shall we try our enable,
and hopefully we still have this?

191
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.657
So enable, I want you do it again.

192
00:12:56.657 --> 00:13:00.529
And option buttons 0, it's back.

193
00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:02.484
It's clickable again.

194
00:13:02.484 --> 00:13:05.792
Cool [APPLAUSE] great work y'all.
