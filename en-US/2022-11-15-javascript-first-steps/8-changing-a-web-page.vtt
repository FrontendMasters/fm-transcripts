00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.056
So we've been talking so far about how
to read the DOM with JS, or how to

2
00:00:05.056 --> 00:00:11.170
basically parse the webpage that we have
and look at its contents using JavaScript.

3
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.265
JavaScript, however, can do much more.

4
00:00:13.265 --> 00:00:16.958
It can also edit the DOM,
it can also make changes to this document.

5
00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.740
And that's where things start
to get fun and chaotic.

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.993
So if you like fun and chaos,
then you're in for a treat.

7
00:00:22.993 --> 00:00:27.637
[LAUGH] So
any guesses what this spell does,

8
00:00:27.637 --> 00:00:31.381
document.title = "My Page"?

9
00:00:33.918 --> 00:00:36.214
&gt;&gt; Names of the variable read or
names of the document title.

10
00:00:36.214 --> 00:00:42.265
&gt;&gt; It is related to the document title,
definitely.

11
00:00:42.265 --> 00:00:46.125
And, I guess,
one way we can find out is we can try it.

12
00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:49.880
So let's pop over here,
I'm gonna make some room.

13
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.510
Okay, so
right now we had said document.title is.

14
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.566
This thing that shows up,
it's a little small in the screen here,

15
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:03.278
but you should see it in your page,
probably in the title bar.

16
00:01:03.278 --> 00:01:07.208
If I type in now this spell
where I do document.title,

17
00:01:07.208 --> 00:01:13.373
then an equal sign separated by spaces,
and then "My page", and press Enter.

18
00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:16.839
Don't know if you noticed,
but now, up here,

19
00:01:16.839 --> 00:01:20.059
it doesn't say JavaScripTacToe anymore.

20
00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:24.540
It says My Page,
because I am now the arbiter of what

21
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.304
happens in my web browser and
on this page.

22
00:01:28.304 --> 00:01:33.635
So this is a little spell I can use to
change the page title, for example.

23
00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:38.523
And we're gonna talk later about
what even this is syntactically and

24
00:01:38.523 --> 00:01:40.217
what's going on here.

25
00:01:40.217 --> 00:01:44.892
And again, note that as before, we're
using double quotes around a lot of these

26
00:01:44.892 --> 00:01:48.949
indicators that we're using,
like when we had h1 in double quotes,

27
00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:52.206
or when we had hash p1 name,
etc., in double quotes.

28
00:01:52.206 --> 00:01:55.588
We're gonna talk more about that later.

29
00:01:55.588 --> 00:01:58.155
Okay, what about this one?

30
00:01:58.155 --> 00:02:00.124
What do you think this is going to do?

31
00:02:03.085 --> 00:02:05.933
If we had to guess?

32
00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:10.521
So maybe if we ignore the = "Sofia" part,

33
00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:17.465
document.getElementById ("p1-name")
.textContent,

34
00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:22.177
right now,
is gonna give me what on our page?

35
00:02:22.177 --> 00:02:24.534
&gt;&gt; Rename your name.

36
00:02:24.534 --> 00:02:26.006
&gt;&gt; It's gonna give your name.

37
00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:31.236
&gt;&gt; It's gonna give,
in this case, Anjana, right?

38
00:02:31.236 --> 00:02:35.099
So this is what we saw earlier, we kind of
had this as part of our scavenger hunt,

39
00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.856
essentially.

40
00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:41.728
So right now, if I look at
the element with the Id p1-name,

41
00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:48.539
it's a little span inside of this
p1 paragraph that has Anjana in it.

42
00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:52.378
And if I now add an = "Sofia" to the end,
and

43
00:02:52.378 --> 00:02:56.625
this is all in one line,
but it might wrap around,

44
00:02:56.625 --> 00:03:01.199
depending on how you've got
your dev tools laid out.

45
00:03:04.187 --> 00:03:07.355
I see the word Sofia in my console here,
but

46
00:03:07.355 --> 00:03:10.875
I also now on the page
have replaced the player,

47
00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:16.432
although actually it's still Mica,
Sofia is my middle name, but [LAUGH].

48
00:03:16.432 --> 00:03:20.588
But what we've done is we've now
changed who's playing this game.

49
00:03:20.588 --> 00:03:23.453
We've changed it, I could even
literally change the name of the game,

50
00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:24.091
if I wanted to.

51
00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:28.968
So the point is that we can interact
with the page itself, even its title

52
00:03:28.968 --> 00:03:33.926
that the browser sees, that it displays
in the top in our title bar here,

53
00:03:33.926 --> 00:03:37.369
or anything within the page,
we can manipulate.

54
00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:39.775
This equals sign is very powerful.

55
00:03:39.775 --> 00:03:43.722
And again, we're gonna talk later about
what is happening here under the hood.

56
00:03:43.722 --> 00:03:48.496
But in this case, I can change
the text content by using this

57
00:03:48.496 --> 00:03:52.043
spell equals whatever text content I want.

58
00:03:52.043 --> 00:03:54.839
So this is going to replace, in this case,

59
00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:58.503
replace the text of that
element with the Id p1-name.

60
00:04:01.228 --> 00:04:04.059
Okay, how about this one?

61
00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:06.528
Any guesses what this is gonna do?

62
00:04:06.528 --> 00:04:09.555
So we're still working with this
getElementById(''p1- name'').

63
00:04:09.555 --> 00:04:13.891
So it's still related to the player
one name or the player x name.

64
00:04:13.891 --> 00:04:15.506
If I run this spell,

65
00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:20.837
any guess about what the player's
name is going to be afterwards?

66
00:04:23.354 --> 00:04:24.551
&gt;&gt; Sofia &amp; friends.

67
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:28.699
&gt;&gt; So this append here,
I wonder what that's gonna do?

68
00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:29.213
Guess?

69
00:04:29.213 --> 00:04:30.434
&gt;&gt; Sofia &amp; friends.

70
00:04:30.434 --> 00:04:31.290
&gt;&gt; it's going to say?

71
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.951
&gt;&gt; Sofia &amp; friends.

72
00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:33.194
&gt;&gt; Sofia &amp; friends.

73
00:04:33.194 --> 00:04:39.236
So in this case, it's not going
to replace the text entirely,

74
00:04:39.236 --> 00:04:41.863
it's going to add onto it.

75
00:04:41.863 --> 00:04:47.257
So now, we see that the old text,
well, slightly old, very fresh,

76
00:04:47.257 --> 00:04:52.190
Sofia is still there, but
now we also have the text &amp; friends.

77
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.165
And if I look inside the element, there
it is, there it is, Sofia &amp; friends now.

78
00:04:58.165 --> 00:05:00.593
So this is another way
we can manipulate text,

79
00:05:00.593 --> 00:05:04.842
is not just by replacing it entirely,
but like, let's say, adding things on.

80
00:05:04.842 --> 00:05:09.665
So append lets us add on extra text,
in this case, text,

81
00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:14.191
and maybe even other things,
but we'll stop there.

82
00:05:14.191 --> 00:05:19.227
So this is going to add to the end of
the current text content of the element.
