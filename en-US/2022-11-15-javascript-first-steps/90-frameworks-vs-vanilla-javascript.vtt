00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.823
What are you seeing as far as
companies using pure JavaScript or

2
00:00:05.823 --> 00:00:09.460
frameworks like React, Vue, Angular?

3
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.600
&gt;&gt; I think we would
like your take as well.

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.984
So what am I seeing in terms of, are
companies using just pure JavaScript or

5
00:00:15.984 --> 00:00:19.110
what's often called Vanilla JavaScript?

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.755
You'll hear that phrase a lot meaning
JavaScript without any kind of

7
00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:28.558
framework like React or Angular or
Vue, or are companies using React or

8
00:00:28.558 --> 00:00:32.690
Angular or Vue or other things,
Felt, what have you?

9
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.931
So personally, I do see a lot of companies
working with frameworks, especially

10
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:45.240
I would say React is kind of the most
common least seen one in my experience.

11
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.475
And with meta frameworks like Next,
which we mentioned briefly earlier,

12
00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:52.498
that are kind of the goal that
play nicely with React or

13
00:00:52.498 --> 00:00:54.933
that that you can kind
of use React within.

14
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:58.119
So I would say that React is
a very valuable framework.

15
00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:02.905
If you want to go ahead after you've
kind of got your Vanilla JavaScript

16
00:01:02.905 --> 00:01:06.510
bearings under you, go on and
learn a bit of React.

17
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.960
I think that that is going
to be a valuable skill.

18
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.878
That said, you do still see
plenty of places working with

19
00:01:14.878 --> 00:01:19.590
Vanilla JavaScript, and so
I might ask Mark to chime in

20
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.420
with his take on Vanilla
versus Framework JavaScript.

21
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.640
&gt;&gt; I think this is too
loaded of a question.

22
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.505
But [LAUGH] in general, I think that
learning fundamentals like this,

23
00:01:32.505 --> 00:01:36.132
the course that you just took,
is gonna set you up for

24
00:01:36.132 --> 00:01:38.782
success no matter what path you take.

25
00:01:38.782 --> 00:01:42.022
And it's always great to
learn browser APIs and

26
00:01:42.022 --> 00:01:44.615
how JavaScript works under the hood.

27
00:01:44.615 --> 00:01:49.284
The next course on the Learning Path will
probably be well sentences JavaScript.

28
00:01:49.284 --> 00:01:54.556
The hard part's anytime you're investing
in fundamentals, it makes frameworks and

29
00:01:54.556 --> 00:01:59.467
additional layers that you layer on top
of Vanilla JavaScript like TypeScript or

30
00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:04.303
like React or like Vue or whatever, it
just makes picking up those things easier

31
00:02:04.303 --> 00:02:09.280
because you can see, this part of the code
is React or this part of the code is, or

32
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.193
the syntax is TypeScript etc.

33
00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:16.178
And so, the more you invest in
fundamentals, the better that you're

34
00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:21.520
gonna be able to pick up whatever tools
are in the professional landscape.

35
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.996
So currently,
of course React is the most popular and

36
00:02:24.996 --> 00:02:27.787
TypeScript is being adapted everywhere.

37
00:02:27.787 --> 00:02:34.634
And so, these tools are important if you
want to look great with your resume and

38
00:02:34.634 --> 00:02:40.880
your projects in your portfolio to
get get hired and that kind of thing.

39
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.565
So, in a professional landscape,
I think that React knowledge

40
00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:50.076
is kind of a baseline because
it's just used so many places and

41
00:02:50.076 --> 00:02:55.715
those paradigms and are just used over and
over in new frameworks like Solid,

42
00:02:55.715 --> 00:03:00.693
you mentioned Svelte, and
they all kind of look somewhat similar.

43
00:03:00.693 --> 00:03:06.591
And so, invest in fundamentals and
then layer on these kind of approaches and

44
00:03:06.591 --> 00:03:09.587
then you'll be setting yourself up for

45
00:03:09.587 --> 00:03:13.870
success no matter what tool
you come across in your job.

46
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.465
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.

47
00:03:15.465 --> 00:03:19.820
I would agree with that and
I would also say Frameworks even more so

48
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.857
then, we said JavaScript evolves,
JavaScript changes and

49
00:03:23.857 --> 00:03:28.145
Frameworks change even more frequently and
more drastically.

50
00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:32.352
So, who knows what we're all
gonna be using in five years or

51
00:03:32.352 --> 00:03:34.887
ten years in the JavaScript world?

52
00:03:34.887 --> 00:03:39.766
But the fundamentals of JavaScript and
the underlying mental models that

53
00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:43.541
we have of how it works and
how it works with the browser and

54
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:47.161
other web technologies and
how it conceives of data and

55
00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:51.750
scope in these sort of time,
these sort of kind of high level things.

56
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.959
That is less likely to
change anytime soon.

57
00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.186
So, I totally agree,
learning a framework like React,

58
00:03:59.186 --> 00:04:03.238
super useful,
learning a language like TypeScript,

59
00:04:03.238 --> 00:04:07.569
which is sort of on top of JavaScript,
also super useful.

60
00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.332
But trying to learn those things before
we really have our sea legs as it were

61
00:04:12.332 --> 00:04:16.795
with JavaScript fundamentals,
Vanilla JavaScript is not gonna be as

62
00:04:16.795 --> 00:04:20.351
valuable as really learning
JavaScript thoroughly and

63
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:23.870
making sure we're
comfortable with Vanilla.

64
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.624
The frameworks will come and go,
they will change, they will evolve,

65
00:04:27.624 --> 00:04:32.068
they will drastically change the way they
look at things, even React has really kind

66
00:04:32.068 --> 00:04:36.090
of changed how we write React code pretty
drastically in the last few years.

67
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.978
So, those kind of things
are gonna evolve and

68
00:04:38.978 --> 00:04:43.082
the best way that we can stay
adaptable to any of those changes and

69
00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:47.490
remain able to work in whatever new
framework comes along tomorrow,

70
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.840
is to have a really solid
foundation in JavaScript.

71
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.908
So, just as we said, as Mark said.
