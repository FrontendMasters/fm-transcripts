00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.344
We're getting there but we noticed
something, can you say that again?

2
00:00:04.344 --> 00:00:06.756
&gt;&gt; Push is pushing nothing.

3
00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:08.631
&gt;&gt; Right now we're pushing nothing, so

4
00:00:08.631 --> 00:00:12.037
we have to push the actual thing we
care about, so we just need to add.

5
00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:12.571
&gt;&gt; Candidate.

6
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:15.139
&gt;&gt; Candidate, okay.

7
00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.540
So now what we've got hopefully,
is a function, and

8
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.713
I'm just gonna copy paste this so
that we can try it out in our console.

9
00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:34.990
Let's try it out.

10
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.284
We're gonna need getRandomElement and
shuffleArray too, so

11
00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:45.798
let me grab those, and I will explain
later why I'm not just reloading the page.

12
00:00:45.798 --> 00:00:48.752
Okay, so we've got our getRandomElement.

13
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.682
We've got our shuffleArray.

14
00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:55.007
Those are the, we could say,
dependencies of this function, or

15
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:58.280
the things that this function depends on,
that it needs to run.

16
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.346
And then we're going to declare our,

17
00:01:04.816 --> 00:01:07.732
getMultipleChoices function.

18
00:01:07.732 --> 00:01:10.633
Probably the most complex
function we've written so far.

19
00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:15.594
Okay, so now if I pass in,
let's say, getMultipleChoices, and

20
00:01:15.594 --> 00:01:17.285
I want three choices.

21
00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:21.931
And let's say we're doing JavaScript
types, and the correct answer is,

22
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:27.180
I don't know, boolean, and I'm passing
an array of some other JavaScript types.

23
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.287
So boolean is one of them,
what else we got?

24
00:01:31.287 --> 00:01:34.403
Help me out, types in JavaScript, string.

25
00:01:34.403 --> 00:01:35.642
&gt;&gt; Primitive.

26
00:01:35.642 --> 00:01:41.814
&gt;&gt; Yep, other primitive types, number,

27
00:01:41.814 --> 00:01:47.266
undefined, yeah, etc, object.

28
00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:52.235
Okay, so if we've done this right then
hopefully we should get some choices that

29
00:01:52.235 --> 00:01:56.564
include boolean and two other things and
in whatever, random order.

30
00:01:56.564 --> 00:01:57.551
Let's find out.

31
00:01:57.551 --> 00:02:00.984
All right, boolean, object, undefined.

32
00:02:00.984 --> 00:02:04.237
Try it again, string, boolean, number,.

33
00:02:04.237 --> 00:02:08.162
Let's try it again, object,
boolean, number, cool.

34
00:02:08.162 --> 00:02:11.006
Now let's just double check
our understanding and

35
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:13.395
make sure that this actually is flexible.

36
00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:15.658
What happens if we make it two choices?

37
00:02:15.658 --> 00:02:16.771
All right, that's good.

38
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:19.470
That feels good,
we're getting two things out now.

39
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.298
How about four choices?

40
00:02:21.298 --> 00:02:23.711
Okay, feeling confident?

41
00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:26.049
Now what if we change the correct answer?

42
00:02:30.542 --> 00:02:33.886
I mean, it's a little hard to
tell cuz there's booleans and

43
00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:39.533
strings everywhere but, There we go,
that one doesn't have boolean in it,

44
00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:42.848
so we know that it's using
the string as the correct answer.

45
00:02:42.848 --> 00:02:46.983
And are we seeing any multiple elements?

46
00:02:46.983 --> 00:02:51.985
No, y'all, we have a super weird, but

47
00:02:51.985 --> 00:02:56.996
correctly functioning function here.

48
00:02:56.996 --> 00:02:59.086
We have a functioning function
which is always a win.

49
00:02:59.086 --> 00:03:04.359
So right now what we just did,
we just used a lot

50
00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:10.592
of stuff that we have just learned so
far in the course.

51
00:03:10.592 --> 00:03:15.337
So we've got arrays, we've got mutating
arrays, we've got while loops,

52
00:03:15.337 --> 00:03:16.879
we've got conditions.

53
00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:22.520
We've got operators,
we've got the logical operator NOR,

54
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.218
we have an if loop, we have randomness.

55
00:03:26.218 --> 00:03:31.101
We have built in methods like includes,
we have a lot going on.

56
00:03:31.101 --> 00:03:35.159
Now we're starting to get a sense of
really what it feels like to be working

57
00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:36.211
with JavaScript.

58
00:03:36.211 --> 00:03:39.576
You have so
many tools in your toolbox, and

59
00:03:39.576 --> 00:03:45.662
it's our job as coders to decide which
tools are appropriate for which jobs.

60
00:03:45.662 --> 00:03:48.366
So do we need a screwdriver right now or
do we need a hammer?

61
00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:52.131
Do we need a chainsaw or
do we need a paintbrush?

62
00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:56.576
So as we get more and
more tools in our JavaScript toolbox,

63
00:03:56.576 --> 00:04:02.398
our work is gonna become less like going
to MDN and figuring out the new tool.

64
00:04:02.398 --> 00:04:06.147
And more going to MDN and figuring out
is this the tool that I really want for

65
00:04:06.147 --> 00:04:08.888
this job, and making choices and
making decisions?
