00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.990
So this is your scavenger hunt now for
these objects.

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:11.407
From the spiceGirls object, how can
we retrieve these different values?

3
00:00:11.407 --> 00:00:13.630
The string Girl Power,

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.412
the object that represents
Ginger Spice aka Geri Halliwell,

5
00:00:19.412 --> 00:00:23.985
the string Spiceworld and
the string Victoria.

6
00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:29.786
So let's take a moment,
I'm going to split screen things,

7
00:00:29.786 --> 00:00:34.950
so that we can see them
both at the same time.

8
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.050
And this is your mission,
should you choose to accept it.

9
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.310
So we have our spices array, and
we have our Spice Girls object.

10
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.548
And the question is, from the Spice Girls
objects, so starting with Spice Girls dot,

11
00:00:50.548 --> 00:00:53.940
what do we need to type to
retrieve each of those things?

12
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.495
Let's take a moment to try it out and
we'll come back and talk about it.

13
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.702
All righty, so let's talk about it.

14
00:01:03.702 --> 00:01:08.204
How can I get the string Girl Power?

15
00:01:08.204 --> 00:01:11.714
This one is maybe it's something
that we've done a couple of times,

16
00:01:11.714 --> 00:01:13.419
something similar we've done.

17
00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:18.330
So I'm gonna start with spiceGirls and
then what do I type?

18
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.102
Who can walk me through it, Paul?

19
00:01:20.102 --> 00:01:21.022
&gt;&gt; .motto.

20
00:01:21.022 --> 00:01:24.450
&gt;&gt; spiceGirls.motto, Girl Power, exactly.

21
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.020
Let me collapse this so
it's not so much in our way.

22
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.478
So because we had our
spiceGirls object and

23
00:01:30.478 --> 00:01:33.980
it had this motto property with
a string value Girl Power.

24
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.297
Great, okay, how about the object
representing Ginger Spice?

25
00:01:38.297 --> 00:01:43.117
So what I mean by this is
this object right here,

26
00:01:43.117 --> 00:01:47.102
the second object in the spices array.

27
00:01:47.102 --> 00:01:49.346
How can I access that one, OJ?

28
00:01:49.346 --> 00:01:52.141
&gt;&gt; Spices and then one and
square brackets.

29
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:54.870
Okay, so I could do spices [1], but

30
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.196
how can I access it from
the Spice Girls object?

31
00:01:58.196 --> 00:02:04.293
&gt;&gt; SpiceGirls.members dot, and then one.

32
00:02:04.293 --> 00:02:08.961
&gt;&gt; SpiceGirls.members [1], exactly.

33
00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:14.609
So importantly let's keep in mind
that this Spices variable and

34
00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:19.221
spiceGirls.members both
point to the same array.

35
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:21.434
So remember what we talked about earlier,

36
00:02:21.434 --> 00:02:24.021
if we were to change one
we would be changing both.

37
00:02:24.021 --> 00:02:26.720
All right,
what about the string Spiceworld?

38
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.210
So this is, it's their second album.

39
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.040
How do we get the name
of their second album?

40
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.856
Jason, you wanna walk us through this one?

41
00:02:39.856 --> 00:02:45.483
&gt;&gt; The spiceGirls.albums and

42
00:02:45.483 --> 00:02:50.645
that's at index [1].

43
00:02:50.645 --> 00:02:52.108
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so similar.

44
00:02:52.108 --> 00:02:55.443
In this case, we have two different arrays
stored in different properties on our

45
00:02:55.443 --> 00:02:56.335
Spice Girls object.

46
00:02:56.335 --> 00:03:00.580
We have one that's got objects and
one that's got strings.

47
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.021
Okay, now how about
the string Victoria which,

48
00:03:06.021 --> 00:03:11.993
perhaps the most famous spice
is the name of Posh Spice

49
00:03:11.993 --> 00:03:17.313
who is the last Spice in
our Spices array [LAUGH].

50
00:03:17.313 --> 00:03:22.328
So how can we get out Posh Spice's name?

51
00:03:22.328 --> 00:03:23.252
Yeah, Cheu.

52
00:03:23.252 --> 00:03:28.534
&gt;&gt; SpiceGirls.members index [4].

53
00:03:31.242 --> 00:03:34.495
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So yes, exactly, thank you.

54
00:03:34.495 --> 00:03:40.339
Because spiceGirls.members
[4] is an object,

55
00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:45.915
we can even use the dot
after those square brackets

56
00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:51.510
to pull out a particular
property of that object.

57
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.149
So the point here, excellent work finding
all of these things in the scavenger hunt,

58
00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:59.122
in the Spice scavenger hunt.

59
00:03:59.122 --> 00:04:04.679
The point here is that we can kind of mix
and match this syntax or these, symbols,

60
00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:10.239
these dots and brackets and things like
that, to dig into these nested objects or

61
00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.764
these complex objects that have arrays
within objects, within arrays, etc.

62
00:04:15.764 --> 00:04:21.358
So we can use our dots and our brackets
to access the things that we need.
