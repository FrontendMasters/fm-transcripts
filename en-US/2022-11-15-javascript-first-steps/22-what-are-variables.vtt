00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.599
Because I have a background in philosophy.

2
00:00:03.599 --> 00:00:08.817
I love asking these big questions but
what does it all mean man,

3
00:00:08.817 --> 00:00:14.048
what really are variables man [LAUGH] so,
let's talk about it.

4
00:00:14.048 --> 00:00:16.342
Let's talk about variables, what are they?

5
00:00:16.342 --> 00:00:21.360
Sometimes you might hear or
maybe you've seen if you've

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.968
encountered other books or
courses on JavaScript.

7
00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:30.957
You might hear people describe variables
as like boxes that contain values.

8
00:00:30.957 --> 00:00:35.532
Have folks, I'm seeing some nods maybe
this is ringing some bells for folks.

9
00:00:35.532 --> 00:00:39.122
That is one way that sometimes folks find
it helpful to think about variables.

10
00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:43.587
Personally, I think that and a few other
people in the JavaScript community,

11
00:00:43.587 --> 00:00:47.985
thinks that that's maybe a little bit
misleading to think about variables as

12
00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:51.843
containing values because sometimes
that can create a mental model

13
00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:56.000
in our minds that doesn't really line
up with what JavaScript is doing.

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.856
Which can trip us up sometimes and

15
00:00:57.856 --> 00:01:00.782
cause us to have unexpected
things in our programs.

16
00:01:00.782 --> 00:01:05.145
So I think it's more useful, and this is
why when we were whiteboarding earlier, we

17
00:01:05.145 --> 00:01:09.705
talked about variables pointing to values,
or you could also say referencing values.

18
00:01:09.705 --> 00:01:13.046
In JavaScript, when I name a variable and

19
00:01:13.046 --> 00:01:17.724
I assign a value to it,
JavaScript is seeing that variable

20
00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:22.407
name as a pointer to whatever
value I asked it to remember.

21
00:01:22.407 --> 00:01:27.098
Now because I'm sort of old I
kind of think about this like

22
00:01:27.098 --> 00:01:28.972
speed dial on a phone.

23
00:01:28.972 --> 00:01:33.764
Which is the thing that we don't really
have anymore because [LAUGH] you we don't

24
00:01:33.764 --> 00:01:38.197
need to anymore, but it used to be that
you could have a few different speed

25
00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:42.989
dial numbers on your landline and you
could press one of them like the Simpsons,

26
00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:43.799
I guess did.

27
00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.674
And get a certain number just dialed for
you.

28
00:01:46.674 --> 00:01:52.295
Nowadays maybe this is more like adding
a contact to your contact book or contact,

29
00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:57.679
I don't know app or whatever it is,
you're iCloud Drive I don't know [LAUGH].

30
00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.781
I think about variables as
sort of @!a new contact in our

31
00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:08.628
address book that is associated
with a particular phone number so

32
00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:11.604
like 555555, 5555,

33
00:02:11.604 --> 00:02:16.407
I can save that number as
a contact in my contact book.

34
00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:19.987
And I could maybe change
the name of that contact or

35
00:02:19.987 --> 00:02:24.689
maybe my contact changed their
phone number and got a new number.

36
00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.669
What they're not going to do is kind
of edit their number a little bit or

37
00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:29.960
something like that.

38
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.400
So what we really have here is an
association between the name that I have

39
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.062
this person saved as in my phone and
the phone number which is what my phone is

40
00:02:39.062 --> 00:02:44.028
actually gonna dial when I try to dial
this person using their name and my phone.

41
00:02:44.028 --> 00:02:46.555
When I say hey Siri I
don't have an iPhone.

42
00:02:46.555 --> 00:02:51.676
But let's say I did,
hey Siri, call Stephen.

43
00:02:51.676 --> 00:02:55.059
That's going to dial a certain number
that is associated with Stephen in my

44
00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.765
address book.

45
00:02:55.765 --> 00:03:01.923
So, this is kind of a mental picture that
I use as opposed to the container picture.

46
00:03:01.923 --> 00:03:05.336
Is more of a pointer or
an address book kind of picture.
