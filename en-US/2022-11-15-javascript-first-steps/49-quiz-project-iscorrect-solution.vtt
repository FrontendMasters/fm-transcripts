00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.539
The next thing we wanted to do was
declare a function called isCorrect,

2
00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:09.694
which more generally is gonna
take in a guess string and

3
00:00:09.694 --> 00:00:15.681
then it's going to compare that to the
answer that you had in your fact object.

4
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:18.960
So let us take a look at that one.

5
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.380
OJ, do you wanna walk me through
what you did for this one?

6
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:30.930
&gt;&gt; Sure, I have const isCorrect = A.

7
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.536
&gt;&gt; Equals, sorry.

8
00:00:32.536 --> 00:00:36.686
&gt;&gt; I just have an answer,
I just have a value.

9
00:00:36.686 --> 00:00:40.643
&gt;&gt; Okay so isCorrect and
then maybe like the correct answer,

10
00:00:40.643 --> 00:00:43.172
like maybe-
&gt;&gt; It probably it should be something

11
00:00:43.172 --> 00:00:47.705
you're feeding in from the-
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what we wanna be able to do is

12
00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:54.556
use this function to pass in a guess that
somebody made, which we'll get later.

13
00:00:54.556 --> 00:00:58.581
But what I wanna be able to do is call,
like this,

14
00:00:58.581 --> 00:01:03.492
I wanna be able to call
the function on a guess, let's say,

15
00:01:03.492 --> 00:01:06.954
so you had a fact where
the answer is true.

16
00:01:06.954 --> 00:01:12.003
I want it so
that if I say isCorrect(false),

17
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:16.793
then this whole thing should return false,

18
00:01:16.793 --> 00:01:21.460
because your answer in your fact was true.

19
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.680
So this is basically like we're comparing
a given guess to the correct answer.

20
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.770
So let's work it out together.

21
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.803
So let's make this instead of a literal
value, let's make it a function.

22
00:01:40.803 --> 00:01:42.423
And maybe just for sake of variety,

23
00:01:42.423 --> 00:01:45.770
let's use the function keyword
instead of our arrows.

24
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.060
So let's walk through
how we would do that.

25
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.150
We could start with the function keyword,
then I wanna name the function isCorrect.

26
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.920
So I'm gonna type isCorrect.

27
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.786
Now I want the parameters to be defined.

28
00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:04.110
How do I define what the parameters
of this function are gonna be?

29
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.130
I see hands going like this.

30
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.968
Params and we can give our guests a name.

31
00:02:08.968 --> 00:02:12.705
I might call it guess,
you could call it guessString.

32
00:02:12.705 --> 00:02:15.065
You could call it guessValue.

33
00:02:15.065 --> 00:02:19.372
You could call it maybeWrongThing,
whatever you want.

34
00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:22.662
[LAUGH] Why don't we call it
just guess for shortness.

35
00:02:22.662 --> 00:02:25.293
And then how do I do
the body of the function?

36
00:02:25.293 --> 00:02:26.110
&gt;&gt; Curly braces.

37
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.905
&gt;&gt; Curly braces, beautiful.

38
00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:32.945
And in this function,
I do wanna return a value.

39
00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:38.193
So, I want to return
the truth value of whether or

40
00:02:38.193 --> 00:02:42.935
not the guess matches
the answer in my fact.

41
00:02:44.288 --> 00:02:49.587
&gt;&gt; So it's a guess,
=== fact.answer.TextContent.

42
00:02:49.587 --> 00:02:53.421
&gt;&gt; Fact, so what is fact.answer here?

43
00:02:53.421 --> 00:02:56.018
&gt;&gt; That's the answer to
the question that I created above.

44
00:02:56.018 --> 00:03:01.128
&gt;&gt; So fact up here is this object, and
so fact.answer is what kind of thing?

45
00:03:01.128 --> 00:03:02.087
&gt;&gt; A boolean.

46
00:03:02.087 --> 00:03:08.877
&gt;&gt; Right, so text content is a property
that exists on elements in our DOM tree,

47
00:03:08.877 --> 00:03:13.220
booleans themselves,
that is the whole value.

48
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.760
So it's not gonna have text content.

49
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.374
So we want to just actually compare
it to the answer, the fact.answer.

50
00:03:20.374 --> 00:03:24.295
So we're actually almost done.

51
00:03:24.295 --> 00:03:25.793
There's one thing missing.

52
00:03:25.793 --> 00:03:26.752
&gt;&gt; Return.

53
00:03:26.752 --> 00:03:27.686
&gt;&gt; Return.

54
00:03:29.188 --> 00:03:32.186
Okay, so
now we're gonna take in the guess, and

55
00:03:32.186 --> 00:03:34.930
it's going to compare it to fact.answer.

56
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.890
We can test this out.

57
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.322
Let's go back, reload our page
to get our updated code, and

58
00:03:41.322 --> 00:03:44.830
I should now have an isCorrect function.

59
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.290
Great, I have a function called that and
it takes in a guess parameter.

60
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.402
And now if I say isCorrect, and
my guess is true, then that's right

61
00:03:53.402 --> 00:03:58.620
cuz the answer to this question,
Arrays are like objects, is true.

62
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.440
Yeah, but if I were to call it on false,
that's wrong.

63
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.040
Okay, so we're gonna use this to
judge the person's answer later once

64
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.947
we figure out how to capture their
answer once they click on a button.

65
00:04:14.947 --> 00:04:20.754
We're gonna use our isCorrect function to
decide whether they were correct or not.

66
00:04:20.754 --> 00:04:25.240
And then we're gonna do what we
did in our earlier pop quiz,

67
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.742
we're gonna color the button based
on whether they were correct or not.

68
00:04:30.742 --> 00:04:36.076
So if I were to say true to this,
that comes out with

69
00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:41.539
the red color to show that it's incorrect,
cool?

70
00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.584
So later we're gonna use this
function in our project.

71
00:04:46.688 --> 00:04:51.490
All right, any questions at
this point about functions?

72
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.570
We've done a lot.

73
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.744
We've covered a lot of ground.

74
00:04:53.744 --> 00:04:55.093
We've talked about functions.

75
00:04:55.093 --> 00:04:57.590
We've talked about how they have
parameters, they have arguments,

76
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.531
they have return values.

77
00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:01.054
We've talked about how to declare
them with the function keyword.

78
00:05:01.054 --> 00:05:03.232
We've talked about how to
declare them with fat arrows.
