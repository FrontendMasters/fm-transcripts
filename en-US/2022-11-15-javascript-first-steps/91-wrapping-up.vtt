1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.905
So those are the last JavaScript keywords
I just wanted to mention to you that

2
00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:05.420
exist.

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.206
But at this point,
we have taken our first steps into

4
00:00:12.206 --> 00:00:18.380
the infinite universe
of learning JavaScript.

5
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.084
So let's take a moment to recap what
we've seen and feel really good about

6
00:00:24.084 --> 00:00:30.700
ourselves because we have some badass new
magic powers to work with JavaScript.

7
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.536
We are the baddest witches in town now
that we have learned so many different

8
00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:40.318
tricks and we've got so many different
tools in our JavaScript toolbox.

9
00:00:40.318 --> 00:00:41.827
So let's take a moment and

10
00:00:41.827 --> 00:00:46.930
appreciate everything that we've just
crammed into our brains in this course.

11
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.130
So we started back.

12
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.116
It's been 80 full years since we were
talking about basic values in JavaScript,

13
00:00:53.116 --> 00:00:56.750
strings, and numbers, and
Booleans, and undefined, and

14
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.380
null, and more complex values too,
arrays and objects.

15
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.016
And over the course, we've learned
more and more intricate kind of fancy

16
00:01:05.016 --> 00:01:10.360
ways of interacting with these complex
values like arrays and objects.

17
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.987
So, we've really wrapped our heads
around what are the things in

18
00:01:12.987 --> 00:01:14.970
the JavaScript universe.

19
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.435
We've also wrapped our heads around how
to remember things with variables and

20
00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:25.746
how scope comes into play to help us
understand where variables are in play.

21
00:01:25.746 --> 00:01:30.311
For example in functions, so
we can use functions to do things and

22
00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:35.872
within functions, we can have our own
kind of limo with tinted windows, our own

23
00:01:35.872 --> 00:01:41.699
scope of, in the function, variables and
values that the function can work with.

24
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.655
And this is how we can kind of
understand what JavaScript is seeing

25
00:01:46.655 --> 00:01:50.385
in different chunks of our code
here based on how variables and

26
00:01:50.385 --> 00:01:55.530
scope work and functions are one of
the places where we get a new scope.

27
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.345
We also talked about doing things,
we figured out how to listen for

28
00:01:59.345 --> 00:02:03.775
events from the browser so that we know
when somebody has clicked on a button or

29
00:02:03.775 --> 00:02:05.590
hovered over an element.

30
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.788
And we can handle it, we can use our
event listeners and click Handler or

31
00:02:10.788 --> 00:02:15.034
mouse over handler functions
to do something to the page or

32
00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:18.710
to load more data or
to do whatever we want.

33
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.368
We also talked about how to decide
what to do with conditionals,

34
00:02:22.368 --> 00:02:26.940
with if else statements or with our
fancy conditional ternary operators.

35
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.740
We also figured out how to do
things more than once with loops.

36
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.790
We got for loops, we got while loops.

37
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.030
We have maps and filter over arrays.

38
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.562
So we learned a whole bunch of different
ways to do things, decide what to do,

39
00:02:40.562 --> 00:02:44.700
do things multiple times and
do whatever we want with our JavaScript.

40
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.040
And we looked at some actually
pretty advanced JavaScript concepts.

41
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.840
We talked about how asynchronous
code works in JavaScript.

42
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.679
We had our, Await friend that
helps us work with asynchronous

43
00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.480
code as if it was synchronous code.

44
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.146
We also have understand that
we have async functions

45
00:03:05.146 --> 00:03:08.240
as distinguished from regular functions.

46
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.320
So we learned that pretty tricky,
if you ask me, part of JavaScript,

47
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.830
how JavaScript thinks about time and
when things happen in JavaScript.

48
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.450
We started looking at it.

49
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.670
We also learnt some fancy syntax, right?

50
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.120
We learned, for example those conditional
ternary operators with a question mark.

51
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.759
We learned about destructuring,
we learned about the spread...

52
00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:32.700
That we can use to kind of spread
out elements from an array.

53
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.175
We learned all kinds of fancy syntax
error, arrow functions, fat arrows.

54
00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:41.960
And all of that stuff is really kind of
modern, relatively new in JavaScript.

55
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.686
It is getting more and more common, so
we're gonna run into that as we read

56
00:03:46.686 --> 00:03:50.480
JavaScript and
write JavaScript around the web.

57
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.430
And we looked even at some more
real world skills like debugging.

58
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.190
We talked about error handling just now.

59
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.523
We talked about how to kind
of work with our browser as

60
00:04:01.523 --> 00:04:06.448
a companion to help us develop
the websites that we want to,

61
00:04:06.448 --> 00:04:11.550
using the console for example,
and using our dev tools.

62
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.011
So we talked really about some real-world
professional context skills that we're

63
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:24.017
gonna need, using modules, for example,
when we go out into the real world,

64
00:04:24.017 --> 00:04:29.220
into the wide world of web development
in the wild, as we could say.

65
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.533
So really, really, really amazing job,

66
00:04:32.533 --> 00:04:36.660
you all,
this is a lot that we've worked through.

67
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.330
It's been a journey.

68
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.889
We have taken our first steps and
then some.

69
00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.867
And you all have just been
asking amazing questions,

70
00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:46.590
you've been doing great
job on these projects.

71
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.399
We've built some simple but
pretty dynamic websites to

72
00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:55.910
fetch dogos and quiz each other and
do other things.

73
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.390
So, from here, let's keep going.

74
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.685
Let's continue digging deeper,

75
00:05:01.685 --> 00:05:05.840
let's continue our infinite
to JavaScript journey.

76
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.195
There are so many other great courses on
Frontend masters that you can take to

77
00:05:10.195 --> 00:05:13.541
continue learning more about
more advanced JavaScript.

78
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:19.576
Some learning in more detail, some of
the async stuff, some of the module stuff,

79
00:05:19.576 --> 00:05:24.918
different techniques for working
with complex JavaScript code bases.

80
00:05:24.918 --> 00:05:28.973
And there are also some other great
courses on things like, TypeScript.

81
00:05:28.973 --> 00:05:33.114
If you don't like the loosey gooseyness
for example of JavaScript when it

82
00:05:33.114 --> 00:05:37.787
comes to working with types or the number
of arguments you can pass into a function,

83
00:05:37.787 --> 00:05:41.920
something like TypeScript might
be a nice alternative for you.

84
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.167
And we talked briefly a little bit about
working with frameworks like React or

85
00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:47.472
Angular or View, and so

86
00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:50.805
there are all kinds of amazing
courses on Frontend Masters,

87
00:05:50.805 --> 00:05:55.050
courses on dev tools in the browser and
how to be effective with those.

88
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.648
So keep on going, please,

89
00:05:56.648 --> 00:06:01.099
don't let this be the last JavaScript
course you take on Frontend Masters.

90
00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.995
On FrontendMasters.com, if you go to
/learn, you can actually find guided

91
00:06:05.995 --> 00:06:10.016
paths through all of these amazing
courses that are available.

92
00:06:10.016 --> 00:06:15.826
So, you can take different paths in for
example, looking at JavaScript in depth,

93
00:06:15.826 --> 00:06:19.976
so going through a whole bunch
of different topics or Node,

94
00:06:19.976 --> 00:06:24.712
we mentioned, is the back end
a server side version of JavaScript.

95
00:06:24.712 --> 00:06:30.303
Or those frameworks, react, view, angular,
we can talk about TypeScript learning,

96
00:06:30.303 --> 00:06:35.072
an alternative to JavaScript that's not so
loosey goosey with its types and

97
00:06:35.072 --> 00:06:38.962
the arguments you pass in
the functions and things like that.

98
00:06:38.962 --> 00:06:41.113
And functional JavaScript is another,

99
00:06:41.113 --> 00:06:44.160
I'm a big fan of functional
programming in JavaScript.

100
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.090
I think it makes working in
JavaScript much nicer and easier.

101
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.992
So you can continue with functional
programming, which we've talked about

102
00:06:50.992 --> 00:06:55.170
a tiny bit, and all kinds of other great
stuff on FrontendMasters.com/learn.

103
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.726
So please continue, go through the
Learning Paths, explore the other courses

104
00:06:59.726 --> 00:07:04.418
available, don't let this be the last
JavaScript or web development course that

105
00:07:04.418 --> 00:07:08.500
you take on Frontend Masters please
cuz there's so much more to learn.

106
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.226
And there are also other resources
out there that can help you really,

107
00:07:13.226 --> 00:07:19.100
really solidify some of the mental models
that we've been building in this course.

108
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:24.593
For example, there's a great email based
course called Just JavaScript that you

109
00:07:24.593 --> 00:07:30.166
can check out that will really get into
really what's happening with variables and

110
00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:32.332
pointers and things like that.

111
00:07:32.332 --> 00:07:36.958
And of course, there is the immense
reference material on MDN and

112
00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:42.256
other sites that are out there where you
can learn so much more about not only

113
00:07:42.256 --> 00:07:47.302
different methods and spells that you
can cast on arrays and strings and

114
00:07:47.302 --> 00:07:52.517
all kinds of other stuff in JavaScript,
but also some high level concepts

115
00:07:52.517 --> 00:07:58.420
around how the web works and how HTML and
CSS and JavaScript all work together.

116
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.310
So keep exploring,
keep investigating and keep playing.

117
00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.110
Keep tinkering, keep exploring in
the console stuff that's happening.

118
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:11.351
Keep writing your own JavaScript code and
trying out new things.

119
00:08:11.351 --> 00:08:16.128
And just keep going, keep exploring
continue stepping forward through

120
00:08:16.128 --> 00:08:19.024
your JavaScript journey because as I said,

121
00:08:19.024 --> 00:08:23.250
at the beginning of the course
this is a never ending process, so

122
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:28.759
we're all constantly learning, I'm
constantly learning JavaScript for sure.

123
00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:32.533
And we have just to keep going and sort
of sometimes it gets a little frustrating

124
00:08:32.533 --> 00:08:34.717
because JavaScript can be weird sometimes.

125
00:08:34.717 --> 00:08:39.346
Sometimes there's historical accidents,
but if we keep poking around,

126
00:08:39.346 --> 00:08:44.416
we will find the tools that we need to be
successful in our JavaScript adventures,

127
00:08:44.416 --> 00:08:48.830
and make our computers do what we want and
cast our magic spells on them.

128
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.320
So, thank you so much for
participating in the course.

129
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.343
Thank you so much for
working through these projects and

130
00:08:58.343 --> 00:09:02.633
these examples and
these 90s pop song references [LAUGH].

131
00:09:02.633 --> 00:09:03.281
And huge,

132
00:09:03.281 --> 00:09:08.540
huge thank you to the Frontend Masters
team that has been making this all happen.

133
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:13.364
So huge thank you to everyone that has
been a fundamental part of making this

134
00:09:13.364 --> 00:09:18.500
course happen and especially thanks to
Mark Grabonski and Daniel Higginbotham

135
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:23.710
who both helped a lot in developing
this course, so helped me out.

136
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.520
And thank you reveal.js for
making slides that we could all look at.

137
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.399
So most importantly, thank you all
to you for going through this really

138
00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:37.280
adventurous journey into our
first steps with JavaScript.

139
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.670
Thank you so much.

140
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.460
&gt;&gt; Go and build amazing software.

141
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:45.393
&gt;&gt; Yes, go on, go forth,
live long and JavaScript and

142
00:09:45.393 --> 00:09:50.216
thank you all one more time for
being such an amazing

143
00:09:50.216 --> 00:09:54.722
partner in going through
our first steps here.

144
00:09:54.722 --> 00:09:56.502
Thank you so much.

145
00:09:56.502 --> 00:09:57.529
Take care.

146
00:09:57.529 --> 00:10:01.781
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; All right that's a wrap.
