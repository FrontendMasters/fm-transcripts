1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.264
So we have just learned a bunch
of strings superpowers.

2
00:00:03.264 --> 00:00:05.909
And again,
do I expect you to remember all of them?

3
00:00:05.909 --> 00:00:09.751
No, MDN is there should
you want to use it.

4
00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:14.113
What we're gonna do is
use our superpowers that

5
00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:18.048
we've just discovered to do a few things.

6
00:00:18.048 --> 00:00:22.562
And they're gonna also require us
to go back to our manipulation

7
00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:26.666
superpowers that we learned
of how to manipulate the DOM.

8
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:30.724
So back on our
JavaScript Tic Tac Toe page, and

9
00:00:30.724 --> 00:00:36.568
you can refresh it if you want,
or if you haven't, that's fine.

10
00:00:36.568 --> 00:00:39.523
You're going to go through and
if you have refreshed like I did,

11
00:00:39.523 --> 00:00:41.287
you might have lost some of the stuff.

12
00:00:41.287 --> 00:00:46.627
For example, previously,
your name was in the player one listing,

13
00:00:46.627 --> 00:00:49.214
now you wanna add your last name.

14
00:00:49.214 --> 00:00:53.564
And to do that, you're gonna have to use
one of the string things that we just saw.

15
00:00:53.564 --> 00:00:58.459
We also want to pick out,
not the page title itself,

16
00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:01.256
but the first T in that title.

17
00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:05.500
Figure out whether or not the page
title as originally indicated,

18
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.621
which might be different now, so

19
00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:12.569
we might all have different answers to
this, contains the word JavaScript.

20
00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:16.681
And we also want to change
the heading of the page.

21
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:21.579
So that instead of saying Tic Tac Toe,
we're screaming Tic Tac Toe, okay?

22
00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.876
So this is your mission should
you choose to accept it.

23
00:01:23.876 --> 00:01:28.452
We will try this out on our own,
and then come back and

24
00:01:28.452 --> 00:01:32.196
review how we might do
all of these things.

25
00:01:35.825 --> 00:01:39.219
Okey-doke, so how is this going?

26
00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.169
We're trying to flex many different
spells at the same time here.

27
00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:50.688
So maybe we can help each other out and
figure out, and

28
00:01:50.688 --> 00:01:55.117
again, there's multiple
ways to change a string.

29
00:01:55.117 --> 00:01:59.929
[LAUGH] So let's see what we got.

30
00:02:04.923 --> 00:02:08.239
As I said, there's many different
ways that we can do each of these.

31
00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.161
So there are multiple correct
answers to of these things.

32
00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:18.209
Let's go back to our page, I got rid
of all of the changes that I made.

33
00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.613
So mine looks pretty squeaky
fresh out of the box.

34
00:02:23.613 --> 00:02:26.605
Yours might look a little different if you
still had some of the changes you made

35
00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:27.931
earlier, that's totally fine.

36
00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.947
All right, how can we add our last
name to the player's listing?

37
00:02:36.628 --> 00:02:38.552
Did anybody find a solution to this?

38
00:02:38.552 --> 00:02:39.125
And again,

39
00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:43.264
there's multiple ways, we're sort of
drawing from everything we've seen so far.

40
00:02:46.345 --> 00:02:49.126
How about over here?

41
00:02:49.126 --> 00:02:57.395
Stephen, did you find a way to
add a last name to the players?

42
00:02:57.395 --> 00:03:01.469
&gt;&gt; Did you mean creating a third player or
adding my last name to a first player?

43
00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.287
&gt;&gt; For example, for me,
since it says player X Anjana, and

44
00:03:04.287 --> 00:03:08.107
at this point depending on where folks
were in the manipulation, it might say

45
00:03:08.107 --> 00:03:12.428
player O, Stephen, or something like that,
how could we make it Anjana of our queue?

46
00:03:12.428 --> 00:03:13.964
&gt;&gt; Okay, append, let me stop there.

47
00:03:13.964 --> 00:03:17.988
&gt;&gt; So we have append, yeah, so
can you walk me through it?

48
00:03:17.988 --> 00:03:23.270
&gt;&gt; I use the document.query.getElementById

49
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.212
p1-name-
&gt;&gt; So document.getElementById-

50
00:03:28.212 --> 00:03:29.164
&gt;&gt; p1-name-

51
00:03:29.164 --> 00:03:31.774
&gt;&gt; p1- name, great-

52
00:03:31.774 --> 00:03:32.993
&gt;&gt; .Append-

53
00:03:32.993 --> 00:03:34.009
&gt;&gt; .Append-

54
00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:35.355
&gt;&gt; .Space-

55
00:03:35.355 --> 00:03:37.788
&gt;&gt; Space, important, the space, yea-

56
00:03:37.788 --> 00:03:38.606
&gt;&gt; Last name.

57
00:03:38.606 --> 00:03:42.670
&gt;&gt; The last name, right, so
in my case, I would put Vakeel.

58
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.383
And that space, again,
remember the space is a character too.

59
00:03:45.383 --> 00:03:50.496
So great, excellent,
did anybody do something else?

60
00:03:52.582 --> 00:03:54.336
So this is totally valid?

61
00:03:54.336 --> 00:03:55.443
Yea, Paul.

62
00:03:55.443 --> 00:04:00.666
&gt;&gt; So I re-assigned it with
my first name plus last name.

63
00:04:00.666 --> 00:04:02.149
&gt;&gt; Great, walk me through it.

64
00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:07.880
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
it's the document.querySelector,

65
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.781
and then I use in quotes pound p1# name.

66
00:04:12.781 --> 00:04:14.181
&gt;&gt; Great.

67
00:04:14.181 --> 00:04:18.080
&gt;&gt; And then the .text content-
&gt;&gt; Text content, uh-huh-

68
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.978
&gt;&gt; Equals-

69
00:04:18.978 --> 00:04:19.656
&gt;&gt; Equals-

70
00:04:19.656 --> 00:04:21.852
&gt;&gt; First name, mine is Paul-

71
00:04:21.852 --> 00:04:23.737
&gt;&gt; Okay, so Paul-

72
00:04:23.737 --> 00:04:24.904
&gt;&gt; And then a plus-

73
00:04:24.904 --> 00:04:25.559
&gt;&gt; Plus-

74
00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:27.142
&gt;&gt; And then the last name,

75
00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:30.474
which would be Quigley, Q-U-I-G-L-E-Y.

76
00:04:30.474 --> 00:04:33.068
&gt;&gt; Like this, G-L-
&gt;&gt; E-Y, yep.

77
00:04:33.068 --> 00:04:34.228
&gt;&gt; Okay, great.

78
00:04:37.927 --> 00:04:39.882
Let's do it.

79
00:04:39.882 --> 00:04:41.677
So now-
&gt;&gt; I forgot-

80
00:04:41.677 --> 00:04:43.940
&gt;&gt; You have kinda a nice little handle,

81
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.351
yeah, what if we wanted to add a space?

82
00:04:46.351 --> 00:04:51.616
We can do the same thing,
we can actually add another plus

83
00:04:51.616 --> 00:04:56.567
here maybe, and
use the space as just its own string.

84
00:04:56.567 --> 00:05:02.511
So we can actually use plus multiple times
to kind of keep adding together strings.

85
00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:08.263
And when I say adding together,
I mean concatenating them together, great.

86
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:13.984
Wonderful, thanks so much, excellent work.

87
00:05:13.984 --> 00:05:19.011
Okay, how about the T in the page title?

88
00:05:19.011 --> 00:05:23.799
Maybe you'll change the title, but let's
say that you had the original page title,

89
00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:26.009
how can we access the page title again?

90
00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.266
What's the thing I need to type?

91
00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:32.297
&gt;&gt; Document.title-
&gt;&gt; Document.title, exactly, okay, so

92
00:05:32.297 --> 00:05:33.891
this is the title right now.

93
00:05:33.891 --> 00:05:35.746
Maybe yours is different, that's okay.

94
00:05:35.746 --> 00:05:40.052
JavaScript Tac Toe,
I wanna find the first T.

95
00:05:40.052 --> 00:05:44.642
Did anyone figure out what they can
type in to retrieve the first T

96
00:05:44.642 --> 00:05:46.349
in JavaScriptTacToe?

97
00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:53.549
&gt;&gt; Document.title.indexOf("T").

98
00:05:53.549 --> 00:05:59.546
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
document.title.indexOfT gives me,

99
00:05:59.546 --> 00:06:02.837
what kind of thing is this?

100
00:06:02.837 --> 00:06:08.293
That 9 kind of value,
whta type of value is it?

101
00:06:08.293 --> 00:06:13.065
And as far as JavaScript is concerned,
all integers are two numbers.

102
00:06:13.065 --> 00:06:18.044
Exactly, so this is a number that
corresponds to the index of the first T.

103
00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:23.197
Great, okay, so now,
we know where that T is.

104
00:06:23.197 --> 00:06:27.228
Now, what if I wanted you
to get me the actual T?

105
00:06:27.228 --> 00:06:28.160
What's the T?

106
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.304
[LAUGH] So how could we use this
information that we found with indexOf

107
00:06:33.304 --> 00:06:38.282
to actually pull out the character,
capital T from that string?

108
00:06:39.837 --> 00:06:45.735
So we know now that the index
of the character we want is 9.

109
00:06:45.735 --> 00:06:52.258
We could use this information to pull
out the character at that index.

110
00:06:52.258 --> 00:06:54.796
Does anybody remember what we have

111
00:06:54.796 --> 00:06:58.742
to type in to get the character
at a particular index?

112
00:06:58.742 --> 00:07:00.419
&gt;&gt; Square brackets.

113
00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:04.504
&gt;&gt; I heard square brackets and you're
gonna say the same thing, square brackets,

114
00:07:04.504 --> 00:07:05.052
exactly.

115
00:07:05.052 --> 00:07:12.170
So this could look like document title,
square brackets, and

116
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:17.287
then the index that we want,
gives me that T.

117
00:07:17.287 --> 00:07:20.396
Okay, so it's sort of an arbitrary
distinction here in terms of the exercise.

118
00:07:20.396 --> 00:07:24.885
But the idea is that sometimes, we're
gonna need the number of the character or

119
00:07:24.885 --> 00:07:27.501
things, substring, whatever that we want.

120
00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:30.512
Sometimes, we're going to need to
use that number to actually get

121
00:07:30.512 --> 00:07:31.602
the thing that we want.

122
00:07:31.602 --> 00:07:34.474
So in this case,
if we want to pull out the T,

123
00:07:34.474 --> 00:07:37.526
we can use the square
brackets with the index.

124
00:07:37.526 --> 00:07:40.389
And if we don't know what index we need,
we can use indexOf to find out.

125
00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:43.820
So great, great teamwork, everybody.

126
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.580
Was there a question?

127
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.644
No, okay, sorry, I thought I saw.

128
00:07:48.644 --> 00:07:51.788
Okay, how about we wanna
answer the question,

129
00:07:51.788 --> 00:07:55.254
does the page title contain
the string JavaScript?

130
00:07:57.034 --> 00:07:59.534
How could we ask JavaScript whether or

131
00:07:59.534 --> 00:08:03.138
not the page title contains the string,
JavaScript.

132
00:08:03.138 --> 00:08:05.666
Just gonna clear to make some room.

133
00:08:05.666 --> 00:08:11.319
&gt;&gt; Document.title.Includes,
and then in quotes JavaScript.

134
00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:17.234
Beautiful, okay, document,title includes,
and notice as I'm typing,

135
00:08:17.234 --> 00:08:22.699
my browser console is giving me the value
that I would get if I hit Enter.

136
00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:26.789
So as we type this out, so
Java, yes, so far, it's true.

137
00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:33.120
Script, false, why?

138
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:39.269
Why does this say that JavaScript Tac Toe
does not include JavaScript?

139
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:42.898
Can anybody tell me why this is false?

140
00:08:42.898 --> 00:08:43.577
&gt;&gt; T.

141
00:08:43.577 --> 00:08:46.619
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the T, so
I heard something about the T.

142
00:08:46.619 --> 00:08:47.383
&gt;&gt; Case sensitive.

143
00:08:47.383 --> 00:08:48.758
&gt;&gt; Case sensitive, exactly.

144
00:08:48.758 --> 00:08:55.254
So if I were to ask it, does the title
include this string JavaScript?

145
00:08:55.254 --> 00:09:02.829
[LAUGH] We would get a different answer
if I was really emphasizing the T.

146
00:09:04.486 --> 00:09:09.812
Okay, how about how we can capitalize?

147
00:09:09.812 --> 00:09:11.432
Now, this is a sneaky one,

148
00:09:11.432 --> 00:09:15.034
because we didn't actually see
how to capitalize a string.

149
00:09:15.034 --> 00:09:19.967
How can we put the heading,
Tic Tac Toe in all caps?

150
00:09:19.967 --> 00:09:24.499
So there is a spell that I'm asking you to
use here that I didn't even talk about,

151
00:09:24.499 --> 00:09:26.108
cuz I'm treaksy like that.

152
00:09:26.108 --> 00:09:28.482
So did anybody figure it out?

153
00:09:28.482 --> 00:09:30.212
Yeah.

154
00:09:30.212 --> 00:09:35.324
&gt;&gt; I did document.querySelector
parenthases or

155
00:09:35.324 --> 00:09:39.164
codes header, and then header 1.

156
00:09:39.164 --> 00:09:41.206
&gt;&gt; Header h1 like that?

157
00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:42.749
&gt;&gt; h1, yeah.

158
00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:46.697
&gt;&gt; A dot style, .textTransform.

159
00:09:46.697 --> 00:09:52.208
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
we're using the CSS properties here, okay?

160
00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:56.897
Text-
&gt;&gt; Transform = uppercase.

161
00:09:56.897 --> 00:09:59.116
&gt;&gt; Like that?

162
00:09:59.116 --> 00:10:02.421
Wow, nice, excellent work.

163
00:10:02.421 --> 00:10:04.618
All right,
this is something we didn't talk about.

164
00:10:04.618 --> 00:10:08.135
But basically,
the same way that JavaScript can allow us

165
00:10:08.135 --> 00:10:11.211
to manipulate the contents
of the HTML document,

166
00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:15.766
you can also manipulate the CSS that's
being applied to those contents.

167
00:10:15.766 --> 00:10:20.573
So in this case,
if we now look at our inspector and

168
00:10:20.573 --> 00:10:24.923
we go into our h1,
what we've done is we've

169
00:10:24.923 --> 00:10:29.740
applied a style attribute
with a text transform.

170
00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.993
And this could really be
any CSS that we want.

171
00:10:32.993 --> 00:10:34.702
In this case, we used the text transform.

172
00:10:34.702 --> 00:10:39.696
So to figure out how to use the text
transform property on the style to

173
00:10:39.696 --> 00:10:41.716
do this, that is awesome.

174
00:10:41.716 --> 00:10:46.561
So this shows that JavaScript can
manipulate the CSS of a page just as

175
00:10:46.561 --> 00:10:51.581
well as it can manipulate the HTML
of a page, really great discovery.

176
00:10:51.581 --> 00:10:56.341
There is another way that
we can do this without

177
00:10:56.341 --> 00:11:01.109
manipulating the style or
sort of adding CSS.

178
00:11:01.109 --> 00:11:03.564
This is a totally valid way to do this,
and

179
00:11:03.564 --> 00:11:07.509
it actually gets out like a really
cool superpower of JavaScript.

180
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:09.332
To make this faster,
I'm gonna refresh the page.

181
00:11:09.332 --> 00:11:10.726
Okay, it's back.

182
00:11:10.726 --> 00:11:15.085
All right, so now, what I've done is I've
cleared the styling roles that we just

183
00:11:15.085 --> 00:11:17.185
applied so that we can try another way.

184
00:11:17.185 --> 00:11:21.739
Did anybody find maybe the chat,
has some suggestions

185
00:11:21.739 --> 00:11:26.298
another way to change
the capitalization of a string?

186
00:11:26.298 --> 00:11:28.881
Yeah, chat.

187
00:11:28.881 --> 00:11:32.329
&gt;&gt; So did a text content.touppercase.

188
00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:35.307
&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, so another way that
we can do it is, so it was document,

189
00:11:35.307 --> 00:11:38.829
what was it, querySelector, and there's a
few different ways that we could do this.

190
00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:43.663
But let's say, we had header h1,
I think before, textContent.

191
00:11:43.663 --> 00:11:48.047
And then similarly to how we had
tolowerCase that we saw before when I was

192
00:11:48.047 --> 00:11:49.301
shouting too much.

193
00:11:49.301 --> 00:11:53.292
We also have a method
toupperCase that will give

194
00:11:53.292 --> 00:11:56.695
me the uppercase version of the string.

195
00:11:56.695 --> 00:12:01.420
But we'll notice that although
I got the capitalized

196
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:06.361
string out in my console,
the page didn't change yet.

197
00:12:06.361 --> 00:12:12.728
So I could-
&gt;&gt; They just repeat it,

198
00:12:12.728 --> 00:12:18.839
so it's just the same thing twice
except for that text content equals.

199
00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:19.387
&gt;&gt; Yes.

200
00:12:19.387 --> 00:12:20.616
&gt;&gt; And that whole string.

201
00:12:20.616 --> 00:12:27.011
&gt;&gt; Exactly, yes sow what we can
do is we can select the element.

202
00:12:30.148 --> 00:12:35.833
Document querySelector header h1, oops,

203
00:12:35.833 --> 00:12:40.920
that's not, header h1.textContent

204
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.857
= whatever the text content was before

205
00:12:45.857 --> 00:12:50.802
toupperCase, and now it has changed.

206
00:12:50.802 --> 00:12:53.888
So these are two totally different and
totally valid.

207
00:12:53.888 --> 00:13:00.628
Both totally valid ways to change the
capitalization of this particular element.

208
00:13:00.628 --> 00:13:04.667
Now, what we've done is we've
just actually done something.

209
00:13:04.667 --> 00:13:09.329
We've gotten at something kinda cool about
JavaScript and we're gonna dig into later.

210
00:13:09.329 --> 00:13:13.357
The fact that we needed to kind
of repeat this a couple of times,

211
00:13:13.357 --> 00:13:18.451
it would be nice if we didn't have to
keep repeating ourselves so much, right?

212
00:13:18.451 --> 00:13:22.358
So we're gonna look later
at how we can do that.

213
00:13:22.358 --> 00:13:26.621
But for now, I wanna say,
good job everybody [APPLAUSE].

214
00:13:26.621 --> 00:13:30.591
We did this with some teamwork,
with some exploration,

215
00:13:30.591 --> 00:13:36.557
with some styling with some JavaScript,
with some indices, with some equal signs.

216
00:13:36.557 --> 00:13:39.405
We managed to do all kinds of
different things to this page.

217
00:13:39.405 --> 00:13:42.955
We're starting to really be able to
do whatever we want to the pages,

218
00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:46.152
which I don't know about you,
but I think it's pretty cool.

219
00:13:46.152 --> 00:13:51.056
I'm feeling pretty powerful,
hope you all are as well.

220
00:13:51.056 --> 00:13:56.291
And we are going to learn as our
JavaScript journey continues,

221
00:13:56.291 --> 00:14:00.856
there is a ton of more stuff
that we can do with strings.

222
00:14:00.856 --> 00:14:04.572
There are a ton more spells we
can cast on a string to ask

223
00:14:04.572 --> 00:14:08.793
JavaScript questions about it or
change it in certain ways.

224
00:14:08.793 --> 00:14:14.844
And there's a lot, there's too much to
cover in a day or a three-day course even.

225
00:14:14.844 --> 00:14:17.427
You could probably just have an entire
Frontend Masters course all about

226
00:14:17.427 --> 00:14:18.243
JavaScript strings.

227
00:14:18.243 --> 00:14:21.305
[LAUGH] But we're not gonna do that today.

228
00:14:21.305 --> 00:14:24.684
So instead,
we're going to remember our friend MDN,

229
00:14:24.684 --> 00:14:29.531
has all of the info that we could possibly
want about how to work with strings and

230
00:14:29.531 --> 00:14:33.072
all of the many,
many magical things we can do with them.

231
00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:37.491
So if you're navigating
through the MDN pages,

232
00:14:37.491 --> 00:14:42.449
you can find it kinda by
clicking through JavaScript,

233
00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:47.753
Built-in objects, and
then blah, blah, blah string.

234
00:14:47.753 --> 00:14:52.275
Or as always, you can in the search bar,
type in the thing you're trying to find.

235
00:14:52.275 --> 00:14:55.299
And in this case,
it's the first result and

236
00:14:55.299 --> 00:14:59.981
it's going to give you a whole
bunch of information about strings.

237
00:14:59.981 --> 00:15:04.491
And remember, we saw, for example,
single quotes, backticks, etc.

238
00:15:04.491 --> 00:15:08.687
How to access characters with the things,
with the brackets etc.

239
00:15:08.687 --> 00:15:11.572
So all kinds of stuff here,
there's a ton that we can do.
