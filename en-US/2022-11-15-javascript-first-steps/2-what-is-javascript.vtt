WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.530
What are we even doing here?

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.800
Why do we care about JavaScript and
how would we JavaScript if we wanted to?

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.311
That's what we're gonna talk about
first to kick things off today.

4
00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:12.830
So what is JavaScript?

5
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.330
Just a simple question, small question.

6
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.043
Would anyone like to describe
JavaScript in their words?

7
00:00:20.043 --> 00:00:23.740
Perhaps folks who've encountered it
before, or been working with it before.

8
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.663
&gt;&gt; I think it's a language
that helps languages, or

9
00:00:28.663 --> 00:00:33.690
that helps websites display and
talk to other websites, I guess.

10
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.573
&gt;&gt; Great, so
I heard a couple of things in there.

11
00:00:35.573 --> 00:00:39.203
One, language,
it's a programming language.

12
00:00:39.203 --> 00:00:40.381
Yes, totally.

13
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:43.665
Two, websites,
it is a language of the web, and

14
00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:48.567
it helps websites to do stuff,
yeah, to paraphrase what said.

15
00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:49.986
Great, thank you.

16
00:00:49.986 --> 00:00:53.908
Yes, indeed, it is a language
that helps website to do things.

17
00:00:53.908 --> 00:00:56.947
&gt;&gt; Language to modify and
interact with HTML.

18
00:00:56.947 --> 00:00:59.590
&gt;&gt; Language to modify and
interact with HTML.

19
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.529
That is great.

20
00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:03.321
Yes, JavaScript can modify and
interact with HTML, and

21
00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:06.476
that is exactly what we're gonna
be doing in a few minutes here.

22
00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:08.497
Excellent, thank you, Chat.

23
00:01:08.497 --> 00:01:09.524
Yeah.

24
00:01:09.524 --> 00:01:12.027
&gt;&gt; It's a programming language,
the language of the web.

25
00:01:12.027 --> 00:01:16.698
&gt;&gt; The language of the web,
the programming language of the web, yes.

26
00:01:16.698 --> 00:01:20.185
So we're gonna talk a little bit
about how that came to be as well.

27
00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:20.809
Yeah.

28
00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:23.385
&gt;&gt; A dynamic programming language.

29
00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:25.785
&gt;&gt; A dynamic programming language, yes.

30
00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:31.215
Okay, so we're gonna talk
a little bit about what that

31
00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:36.291
means about how we can
interact with JavaScript and

32
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:40.676
how we can run it kind
of live in the browser.

33
00:01:40.676 --> 00:01:45.717
&gt;&gt; It makes the web interactive,
handles the behavior of websites,

34
00:01:45.717 --> 00:01:49.506
and yeah,
modify the behavior of HTML elements.

35
00:01:49.506 --> 00:01:50.565
&gt;&gt; Excellent points, yes.

36
00:01:50.565 --> 00:01:54.868
So JavaScript lets us modify websites and
make them interactive, which is a huge,

37
00:01:54.868 --> 00:01:58.565
huge point of this, and that's what
we're gonna be working towards.

38
00:01:58.565 --> 00:02:02.054
So tomorrow, we're gonna be really
digging into the interactivity piece.

39
00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:05.912
But yes, today we're going to be using it
to modify a website is exactly what we're

40
00:02:05.912 --> 00:02:06.970
gonna be using it for.

41
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.953
So these are all great points,
just in the interest of moving along.

42
00:02:10.953 --> 00:02:12.186
This is some JavaScript.

43
00:02:12.186 --> 00:02:15.899
This is a tiny little simple
JavaScript code snippet.

44
00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:20.660
So we have an object here called JS, we're
gonna talk more about objects later today.

45
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.270
But it describes some
things about JavaScript.

46
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.462
So we often abbreviate it JS.

47
00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:29.845
It's a pretty awesome language, I think,
because it can do a lot of things.

48
00:02:29.845 --> 00:02:33.744
And it can teach us a lot about different
concepts in computer science as well.

49
00:02:33.744 --> 00:02:38.876
Because it covers a lot of ground and
has a lot of different styles of

50
00:02:38.876 --> 00:02:44.578
programming supported and kind of
included in the JavaScript universe.

51
00:02:44.578 --> 00:02:49.466
Fun fact is JavaScript
was created in 1995.

52
00:02:49.466 --> 00:02:53.909
So I hope you all like 90s memes cuz
there's gonna be a lot of 90s pop culture

53
00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.536
references in this course.

54
00:02:55.536 --> 00:02:57.013
Get ready.

55
00:02:57.013 --> 00:03:00.321
And it was created by a person named

56
00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:04.891
Brendan Eich while working
on the web browser.

57
00:03:04.891 --> 00:03:08.110
Do you remember Netscape Navigator?

58
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.580
Yeah, some of us.

59
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.842
Some of us might be too young
to remember those days.

60
00:03:12.842 --> 00:03:17.583
But so JavaScript was
created in a period of about

61
00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:22.437
ten days in 1995 in order
to allow folks a way to

62
00:03:22.437 --> 00:03:27.078
write scripts or
kind of manipulate webpages.

63
00:03:27.078 --> 00:03:32.500
And since then,
it has really grown far beyond its initial

64
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.923
goal of being kind of a language
embedded in your web page or

65
00:03:37.923 --> 00:03:43.587
in your web browser that can let
you manipulate the web page.

66
00:03:43.587 --> 00:03:45.990
And now we can do all kinds
of things with JavaScript.

67
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.558
We can run JavaScript in the browser,

68
00:03:47.558 --> 00:03:49.672
which is what we're gonna
be doing in this course.

69
00:03:49.672 --> 00:03:54.379
We can also run JavaScript on servers
using a project called Node.js

70
00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.392
that lets us run server-side JavaScript.

71
00:03:57.392 --> 00:04:01.756
You see JavaScript even popping up
on things like embedded devices.

72
00:04:01.756 --> 00:04:05.592
There are a few implementations for
running JavaScript on Internet of

73
00:04:05.592 --> 00:04:08.720
things devices, so
smart devices and things like that.

74
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.345
So, JavaScript has really kind of
escaped in the original confines

75
00:04:14.345 --> 00:04:19.190
of being a language dedicated
to manipulating web pages.

76
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.129
And we're not gonna talk too much about
the rest of the JavaScript world, but

77
00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:27.127
again, there are tons of great courses
on all of this stuff, Node.js, etc,

78
00:04:27.127 --> 00:04:28.290
on Frontend Masters.

79
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.303
So my hope is that once we've talked
a little bit about some JavaScript

80
00:04:32.303 --> 00:04:35.364
fundamentals here,
y'all will be able to dive in and

81
00:04:35.364 --> 00:04:39.328
continue running with the JavaScript
journey as far as you'd like.

82
00:04:39.328 --> 00:04:43.074
And the interesting thing is that
JavaScript is sort of like we could

83
00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:47.290
think of it as the the lingua franca or
the kind of common language of the web.

84
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.603
But it has also given rise to
other languages which even

85
00:04:50.603 --> 00:04:54.854
use JavaScript as a compilation target,
meaning some other language

86
00:04:54.854 --> 00:04:58.903
that then gets translated to
JavaScript to run in the web browser.

87
00:04:58.903 --> 00:05:04.535
So we have other languages like
TypeScript and things like ClojureScript,

88
00:05:04.535 --> 00:05:10.167
functional languages like Elm,
there's a course on Frontend Masters on,

89
00:05:10.167 --> 00:05:14.222
that use JavaScript as a way
to talk to the web browser.

90
00:05:14.222 --> 00:05:16.957
So it's a really,
really fascinating language, I think.

91
00:05:16.957 --> 00:05:18.362
And there's, like I said,

92
00:05:18.362 --> 00:05:21.300
kind of an infinity of things
we can learn with JavaScript.

93
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.180
You can do amazing stuff with JavaScript.

94
00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.960
You can connect it to
mind control devices.

95
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.890
You can use it to interact with the real
world through these IoT things.

96
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:31.992
You can, of course,

97
00:05:31.992 --> 00:05:35.492
do what pretty much whatever you
want to a website with JavaScript.

98
00:05:35.492 --> 00:05:38.379
And so
I think JavaScript is pretty awesome.

99
00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:42.889
So in that case, if you all agree
that JavaScript is awesome,

100
00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.140
which hopefully you do,
cuz you're here in this course,

101
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.285
[LAUGH] then we can all have a nice
moment of saying, hell yes JS, whew.
