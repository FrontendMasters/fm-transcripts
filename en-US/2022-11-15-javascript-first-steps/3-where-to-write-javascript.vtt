WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.794
This is just kind of a recap,
cuz folks as we mentioned in the chat,

2
00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:06.620
have pointed out that
JavaScript is part of the web.

3
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.593
So HTML, and CSS, and JavaScript, are all
kind of BFFs cuz we love acronyms here.

4
00:00:13.593 --> 00:00:18.350
[LAUGH] So [LAUGH] best friends forever,
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

5
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.130
Can anybody help me break down?

6
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.080
So HTML versus CSS versus JavaScript.

7
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.320
How do you all think about them?

8
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.024
How do you all think about how these
three web technologies relate?

9
00:00:32.024 --> 00:00:35.669
Anybody in the room here wanna share too?

10
00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:37.600
&gt;&gt; HTML is mostly for content structure.

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.608
&gt;&gt; HTML for content and structure, yes.

12
00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:45.392
So HTML is sort of how we
declare the stuff in the webpage

13
00:00:45.392 --> 00:00:49.657
would you say, the content,
excellent point.

14
00:00:49.657 --> 00:00:50.858
Yeah, Paul.

15
00:00:50.858 --> 00:00:55.549
&gt;&gt; I've had to describe
the HTML is like the noun,

16
00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:01.510
CSS is the adjective, and
JavaScript is the verb.

17
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.220
&gt;&gt; I like that a lot, that's great.

18
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.866
HTML is the noun, is the thing,
CSS is the adjective,

19
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:11.724
the description of the thing, and
JavaScript is the verb, the action.

20
00:01:11.724 --> 00:01:14.154
That happens with the thing,
I love that a lot.

21
00:01:14.154 --> 00:01:16.760
And that is sort of similar,
that's kind of how I think about it.

22
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.083
So I kind of think about this as sort
of like a musical theater production or

23
00:01:21.083 --> 00:01:25.426
a stage production, a play or
something, like Hamilton, for example.

24
00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:29.586
So I think of HTML as kind of
like the actors on stage or

25
00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:34.137
maybe the props, the things,
the nouns, the content.

26
00:01:34.137 --> 00:01:38.130
The CSS kind of like the costumes and
the set design and

27
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.657
how the lighting looks and
sort of how everything looks, and

28
00:01:42.657 --> 00:01:47.572
kind of feels, so sort of the style
put on top of all that content.

29
00:01:47.572 --> 00:01:51.808
And then, I think of JavaScript as sort
of like the choreography, the dancing,

30
00:01:51.808 --> 00:01:54.487
the moving across the stage,
giving things life,

31
00:01:54.487 --> 00:01:56.500
bringing things to life a little bit.

32
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.771
So if either of these analogies,
the noun, verb,

33
00:01:59.771 --> 00:02:04.730
adjective analogy or the the stage
production analogy work for you, great.

34
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.801
But this is essentially how these three
core web technologies play together.

35
00:02:08.801 --> 00:02:13.032
And JavaScript is the one that
adds the pop if you ask me,

36
00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:17.999
the zing, the activity, the action,
the movement, the life.

37
00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:21.968
So question is, how do we write it?

38
00:02:21.968 --> 00:02:24.444
[LAUGH] Well, that's I guess,
what we're here to talk about.

39
00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:26.493
So that's really my job to answer.

40
00:02:26.493 --> 00:02:30.288
[LAUGH] And at first, in this course,
if you've never seen JavaScript before,

41
00:02:30.288 --> 00:02:33.080
if you have,
you're gonna maybe feel more comfortable.

42
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.878
But if you've never seen
JavaScript before, there are times

43
00:02:36.878 --> 00:02:41.185
where it's just gonna feel like you
are just saying some weird spell or

44
00:02:41.185 --> 00:02:45.786
some kind of jargon invocation, like
light as a feather stiff as a board and

45
00:02:45.786 --> 00:02:50.052
anybody played this game as a kid,
just me, just 90s kids, okay?

46
00:02:50.052 --> 00:02:52.560
So this is like a game where
sometimes you feel like you're

47
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.520
just repeating spells that
you don't totally understand.

48
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.114
You're just saying, or writing in this
case, something that you don't totally

49
00:02:59.114 --> 00:03:03.230
know how it works, but you know that it
does something, like levitate your friend.

50
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.717
But hopefully, by the time we finish
this course and by the time we have

51
00:03:07.717 --> 00:03:12.128
the tools in our tool belt to go on and
continue learning JavaScript,

52
00:03:12.128 --> 00:03:16.590
we will feel totally in control
of this magic art of JavaScript.

53
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.770
And we will be able to wield its powers
for good or evil as we so choose.

54
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.534
And so this is the hope that we're gonna
start by writing some things that we were

55
00:03:25.534 --> 00:03:28.680
just gonna repeat the words and
we don't know what they mean.

56
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.793
But we're gonna dig into them and
we're gonna learn what they mean so

57
00:03:31.793 --> 00:03:34.490
that we can really have a strong
command over the language.

58
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.788
So maybe a more apt question
to get started is not so

59
00:03:36.788 --> 00:03:39.599
much how we write JavaScript but
where we write JavaScript.

60
00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:47.030
So where do you write
JavaScript to anybody?

61
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.157
Anybody wanna throw in, there are several
answers to this question, but

62
00:03:50.157 --> 00:03:52.943
anybody wanna throw in a place
where you could write JavaScript?

63
00:03:52.943 --> 00:03:55.074
&gt;&gt; Source script in the browser.

64
00:03:55.074 --> 00:03:55.775
&gt;&gt; In the browser?

65
00:03:55.775 --> 00:04:01.710
Yes, so one place that we can write
JavaScript is in the browser.

66
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.500
And there are a couple
of ways we can do that.

67
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.320
So one place and

68
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.620
where we're going to be working today
is in the browser's JavaScript console.

69
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.755
Console is kind of a live
dynamic sort of interpreter for

70
00:04:13.755 --> 00:04:16.388
JavaScript that we can use.

71
00:04:16.388 --> 00:04:20.819
I don't think it's at our fingertips,
it's already in your computer,

72
00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:23.030
it's been hiding there.

73
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.719
[LAUGH] So
it's already in our web browsers,

74
00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:26.600
that's what we're gonna be using today.

75
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.900
But there are also some
other options that we have.

76
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.190
So one thing is that we
could use a a txt file.

77
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.971
So the same as we would write HTML in a
.html file, we can also use a script tag,

78
00:04:37.971 --> 00:04:41.540
which I think someone also
mentioned in the chat.

79
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.168
We can use a script element to write
JavaScript within our HTML files in

80
00:04:46.168 --> 00:04:50.625
a local file, which we can edit
with whatever text editor we like.

81
00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:54.412
So we could use something built-in
to most systems like text editor or

82
00:04:54.412 --> 00:04:58.340
whatever editor your laptop maybe or
your operating system comes with.

83
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.214
Might not be a laptop, might be a,
I don't know, any other kind of device, or

84
00:05:04.214 --> 00:05:10.356
we can use a kind of fully featured IDE,
an integrated development environment.

85
00:05:10.356 --> 00:05:15.077
[LAUGH] Which, for example, VS code is
a hugely popular one among JavaScript

86
00:05:15.077 --> 00:05:20.094
developers, which gives us some nice
extra, things like auto completion, and

87
00:05:20.094 --> 00:05:26.220
maybe some nice features to integrate with
other tools in our developer workflow.

88
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.958
And we can also use because JavaScript
is such a hugely popular language,

89
00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.360
there are some amazing online playground.

90
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.542
So even if we're working,
let's say on a smartphone or

91
00:05:35.542 --> 00:05:39.959
on some other device where we don't
really have access to things like an IDE.

92
00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:43.469
Or maybe even the JavaScript
console in the browser,

93
00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:47.915
we can use some of these cool
playground sites like CodePen, .io,

94
00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:52.442
I think it is or code sandbox.io to
write JavaScript in our browser.

95
00:05:52.442 --> 00:05:55.052
And if you sign up for
a free account on some of these sites,

96
00:05:55.052 --> 00:05:57.685
you can also save little
snippets of JavaScript.

97
00:05:57.685 --> 00:05:59.555
So you have lots of options.

98
00:05:59.555 --> 00:06:03.551
We're gonna be working largely in
our browsers, JavaScript console and

99
00:06:03.551 --> 00:06:07.868
local text files, but if you are doing
something else, if you are in a CodePen or

100
00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:10.510
whatever else that is totally valid.

101
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.999
There are some minor differences between
and sometimes major differences between

102
00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:16.590
different environments
where we write JavaScript.

103
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.100
So if questions come up,
feel free to ask them.

104
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.330
Today, we're gonna be focusing on
the browser's JavaScript console.

105
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.650
Shall we write some JavaScript?

106
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.670
Let's open up our browser's console
by doing the following things.

107
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.674
So there is if we go into
the course site which again

108
00:06:36.674 --> 00:06:41.323
on Java.dev/havaScript-first-steps,

109
00:06:41.323 --> 00:06:46.580
you'll notice on day one
link to a Tic Tac Toe.

110
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:53.010
If you open that page, you'll see
a very exciting web page like this.

111
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.315
It's not much to look at, but
it's a basic webpage that's gonna give us

112
00:06:56.315 --> 00:07:00.050
the scaffolding for
some of the things we talked about today.

113
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.808
And we want to now on this page, just with
this page open in your browser, so it's

114
00:07:05.808 --> 00:07:11.830
anjana.dev/javaScript-first-steps/1-ticta-
ctoe.html.

115
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.424
We're going to now open our
browser's developer tools so

116
00:07:15.424 --> 00:07:18.074
that we can get to the JavaScript console.

117
00:07:18.074 --> 00:07:22.840
Can anybody who's maybe already done
this before walk me through how I

118
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.162
would get the developer
tools open in this page?

119
00:07:26.162 --> 00:07:27.330
There's a few different ways.

120
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:34.040
&gt;&gt; You right click and then at the bottom
of the drop down box is inspect.

121
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.742
&gt;&gt; Great, yes.
So probably the easiest way to get

122
00:07:36.742 --> 00:07:42.369
the developer tools open is to right
click anywhere on the page and inspect.

123
00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:45.471
Now, this is usually used for
inspecting HTML elements,

124
00:07:45.471 --> 00:07:48.970
and we're gonna talk about
that a little bit later.

125
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:53.014
What we'll see, yours might look a little
bit different depending what browser

126
00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:57.057
you're in, what you'll see is some kind
of HTML with whatever element you maybe

127
00:07:57.057 --> 00:07:58.739
clicked on, highlighted here.

128
00:07:58.739 --> 00:08:03.953
And as you move around, you'll see
the different HTML elements get selected.

129
00:08:03.953 --> 00:08:09.901
And so from here, so now what we've done,
again, we opened the file,

130
00:08:09.901 --> 00:08:16.460
if you'd like to download that file and
open it locally, you can also do that.

131
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.076
You can open a local file in your browser,

132
00:08:18.076 --> 00:08:20.120
which is what we'll be
working with more tomorrow.

133
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:25.120
But right now the live file online is
fine, we right clicked to click Inspect.

134
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.811
And now, we wanna open the JavaScript Enos
and so at the top or again,

135
00:08:28.811 --> 00:08:33.203
depending on your browser, you might be on
the bottom of the page or what have you,

136
00:08:33.203 --> 00:08:35.450
you should see an option called Console.

137
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:42.776
And that will open up a little, what we
call prompt so these two little lines and

138
00:08:42.776 --> 00:08:47.330
now, you are able to type stuff,
and stuff will happen.

139
00:08:50.148 --> 00:08:54.689
So for example, I can say I'm gonna type

140
00:08:54.689 --> 00:08:59.240
a weird invocation here, just a spell.

141
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:06.760
I can say "hell yes JS!", and
press Enter and JavaScript does something.

142
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.246
In this case,
I just told JavaScript to log or print or

143
00:09:11.246 --> 00:09:14.250
display something in the console.

144
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.490
In this case, what I asked it to
display was the string, hell yes JS.

145
00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.759
So we're gonna talk
about all this later but

146
00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:24.000
the idea is that now you can
enter JavaScript things.

147
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.990
You can do math for example.

148
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:31.995
And every time I press Enter after
entering some code, JavaScript will run

149
00:09:31.995 --> 00:09:37.160
and it will try to interpret or evaluate
or basically make sense of that code,

150
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.866
and so this is how we're gonna be
interacting with JavaScript today.
