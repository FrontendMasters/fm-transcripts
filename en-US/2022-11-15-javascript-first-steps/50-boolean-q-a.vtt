00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.240
Does anyone have any questions on
all of this functioning goodness.

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.372
&gt;&gt; How did the fact answer work, because
it's comparing Boolean with a string.

3
00:00:08.372 --> 00:00:11.570
&gt;&gt; So, yes.

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.982
So there is some small thing here
that we kind of glossed over.

5
00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:21.190
Which is that I said that, in this slide,
I said it should compare a guess string.

6
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.680
And then actually when we tried it out,
we were comparing.

7
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.050
We passed in, I'm on the wrong page.

8
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.766
We passed in Booleans to isCorrect.

9
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:37.994
So what happens if I pass
in a string that says true?

10
00:00:39.993 --> 00:00:40.949
False, why?

11
00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.255
&gt;&gt; Because they're not the same.

12
00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:48.982
&gt;&gt; They're not the same,
one's a Boolean, one is a string, right.

13
00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:54.422
So if we have true string, well,
if I spell it right, "true" === true.

14
00:00:54.422 --> 00:00:56.880
That's false.

15
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.810
And in fact, even our loosey-goosey
friend here would also agree.

16
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.390
Sometimes it cares.

17
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.030
&gt;&gt; Preposterous.

18
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.000
&gt;&gt; So, if I were to pass
in a string value of true.

19
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.630
&gt;&gt; My answer would have
to be a string as well.

20
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.620
&gt;&gt; The answer would have
to be a string as well.

21
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.283
How can we convert something to
a string that's not a string?

22
00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:27.419
So there's actually a hidden trick.

23
00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:33.177
A hidden spell in these wrapper
objects that JavaScript makes,

24
00:01:33.177 --> 00:01:38.293
that we can actually call
a method to string on pretty much

25
00:01:38.293 --> 00:01:43.550
any thing in JavaScript,
That converts it to string.

26
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.078
So what we could do and
I mentioned earlier.

27
00:01:48.078 --> 00:01:52.493
If folks had a real good ear, I mentioned
that if you made true a Boolean.

28
00:01:52.493 --> 00:01:56.150
Or this the answer a Boolean true or
false.

29
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.910
As you probably did.

30
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.540
Later, we might have to care
whether it's a Boolean or a string.

31
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.153
So what we can do,is if we're expecting,
and

32
00:02:05.153 --> 00:02:08.080
let's rename our variable
here to guessString.

33
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.855
It's another fun little thing IDEs can do,

34
00:02:10.855 --> 00:02:14.011
which is rename multiple
things at the same time.

35
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:18.191
If we're specifying that we're
expecting a string here.

36
00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:23.975
We can actually make sure that
we're comparing apples to apples,

37
00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:30.080
as it were, by converting fact.answer
to a string with .toString.

38
00:02:33.218 --> 00:02:35.492
So this is gonna come into play,

39
00:02:35.492 --> 00:02:41.650
because later when we pull out the thing
that they clicked on and it value in html.

40
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.900
We are dealing with strings all the time.

41
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.030
So we noticed if we look at our button,
I never defined it.

42
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.816
If we look at our,

43
00:02:54.816 --> 00:02:58.340
what was it?

44
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.110
Option buttons zero.

45
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.620
We noticed that its value
is the string true.

46
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.890
So later this is gonna come into play.

47
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:15.442
So now if I try refreshing here with
my new newly converted isCorrect,

48
00:03:15.442 --> 00:03:19.672
oops, is spelled incorrectly [LAUGH].

49
00:03:19.672 --> 00:03:22.442
Okay, so our isCorrect,
now we know it's the updated version.

50
00:03:22.442 --> 00:03:24.188
It's expecting a guest string.

51
00:03:24.188 --> 00:03:29.937
If I now guess the string true, it works.

52
00:03:29.937 --> 00:03:34.416
Because it has converted my
Boolean fact.answer to a string.

53
00:03:34.416 --> 00:03:38.365
And just to make sure
that we're not losing it,

54
00:03:38.365 --> 00:03:43.224
isCorrect false string does
say that it's false, cool?

55
00:03:43.224 --> 00:03:47.572
Okay, good question.
