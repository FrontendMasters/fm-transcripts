00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.834
Earlier we were looking at
this little tic-tac-toe page,

2
00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:05.799
this little tic-tac-toe game.

3
00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:10.414
Yeah, what we're gonna do is
just quickly walk through and

4
00:00:10.414 --> 00:00:14.477
play tic-tac-toe by using
our newfound object and

5
00:00:14.477 --> 00:00:19.094
array skills to manipulate
the built in object document and

6
00:00:19.094 --> 00:00:25.677
all of its many different properties that
we now know what we're dealing with here.

7
00:00:25.677 --> 00:00:31.844
So what we've got here is a page that
displays information about the players.

8
00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:36.624
Right now, earlier we had been working
through, just working with the strings

9
00:00:36.624 --> 00:00:40.992
themselves that are in these little
divs and spans and things like that.

10
00:00:40.992 --> 00:00:44.452
But right now I'm going to start
thinking in more javascripting terms.

11
00:00:44.452 --> 00:00:49.424
So I'm going to start representing
the data that we need in order to do

12
00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:51.750
stuff on our page with objects.

13
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.993
So let's create an object.

14
00:00:56.993 --> 00:01:01.909
In this case, I would suggest we use
an array to represent the two different

15
00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.181
players that we have in this game.

16
00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:09.485
So in this case, our game,
we're only gonna play one time and

17
00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:12.448
our players are not gonna change.

18
00:01:12.448 --> 00:01:17.257
So how should I declare
a new array called players

19
00:01:17.257 --> 00:01:22.077
that I don't think is ever
gonna need to change?

20
00:01:22.077 --> 00:01:26.192
How would I create a new
variable that points to players?

21
00:01:26.192 --> 00:01:27.483
That's not gonna change?

22
00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:28.044
&gt;&gt; Const.

23
00:01:28.044 --> 00:01:29.539
&gt;&gt; Const, beautiful.

24
00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.409
Okay, so
const players is gonna be an array.

25
00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.058
And within this array, I want two objects.

26
00:01:37.058 --> 00:01:40.041
I want each object to
represent one of the players.

27
00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:44.869
I'm gonna be the first player, so I'm
going to say that this object is going to

28
00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.833
have a name, property Anjana,
if I can spell my own name right.

29
00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:53.511
Then I'm gonna use a comma to
create a new property of my symbol.

30
00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:59.797
And I'm gonna claim the x symbol here.

31
00:01:59.797 --> 00:02:04.345
Now, I'm gonna play against
all of the rest of you.

32
00:02:04.345 --> 00:02:08.322
So let's create another object.

33
00:02:08.322 --> 00:02:11.591
So right now, players has one thing in it.

34
00:02:14.617 --> 00:02:17.057
Name Anjana symbol x.

35
00:02:17.057 --> 00:02:19.808
Now I want to add another
thing to my player's array.

36
00:02:19.808 --> 00:02:22.006
How do I do that?

37
00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:26.862
I wanna add a second thing to
my player's array at the end.

38
00:02:26.862 --> 00:02:30.320
What's the method that we use
to add stuff to an array?

39
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.851
&gt;&gt; Push.

40
00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:32.367
&gt;&gt; Push, great.

41
00:02:32.367 --> 00:02:34.530
Okay, so players push.

42
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.315
I'm gonna push on a new object that
represents the other player and

43
00:02:39.315 --> 00:02:41.374
that's gonna be all of you.

44
00:02:41.374 --> 00:02:42.910
Everyone else is your name.

45
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.744
[LAUGH] And I'm gonna add another
property to represent your symbol.

46
00:02:48.744 --> 00:02:53.641
So what do I type to represent
that everyone else is gonna

47
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:55.628
be playing with the O?

48
00:02:55.628 --> 00:02:56.314
&gt;&gt; Symbol.

49
00:02:56.314 --> 00:02:58.672
&gt;&gt; Symbol.

50
00:02:58.672 --> 00:03:02.329
And then I wanna put a value on it so
I need a colon, and

51
00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.505
then the symbol itself which
will be the string 0, great.

52
00:03:06.505 --> 00:03:11.180
Okay, so now players.length should be 2.

53
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.917
And if I want to get, let's say,
okay, we had, what was it?

54
00:03:17.917 --> 00:03:25.081
Document.getElementById, I
think it was called p1-name.

55
00:03:25.081 --> 00:03:28.495
TextContent, right now it's Anjana.

56
00:03:28.495 --> 00:03:30.273
Okay, so that one is fine,
that one didn't change.

57
00:03:30.273 --> 00:03:35.080
If I want to update the textContent
of the other player, in this case,

58
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.369
I think it was called p2-name.

59
00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:39.694
So this is review from yesterday.

60
00:03:39.694 --> 00:03:42.827
Right now it says it's Mack, but
it's not, it should be all of you.

61
00:03:42.827 --> 00:03:47.945
So how do I use my players
object to set the textContent

62
00:03:47.945 --> 00:03:52.399
of this element to
the second player's name?

63
00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.598
Let's walk through it together.

64
00:03:54.598 --> 00:03:58.507
So I want to assign, I want to
change the textContent here, right?

65
00:03:58.507 --> 00:04:05.953
So I'm going to getElementById
p2-name textContent.

66
00:04:05.953 --> 00:04:11.054
And then if I wanna change the value
of this, I can type in equals exactly.

67
00:04:11.054 --> 00:04:15.407
Now, I want the value of this to be
everyone else, how do I get that?

68
00:04:15.407 --> 00:04:16.893
&gt;&gt; Players.

69
00:04:16.893 --> 00:04:18.150
&gt;&gt; Players.

70
00:04:20.783 --> 00:04:24.689
So we had in our players, I mean, so

71
00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:29.265
our player's array has two things in it.

72
00:04:29.265 --> 00:04:31.677
The first one is an object
with name Anjana.

73
00:04:31.677 --> 00:04:33.914
And the second one is an object
with name of everyone else.

74
00:04:33.914 --> 00:04:36.342
So it's that second one that I want.

75
00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:42.676
So players index 1 with
the square brackets dot name.

76
00:04:42.676 --> 00:04:46.652
And if we've done this right,
then the page updated.

77
00:04:46.652 --> 00:04:49.641
So now y'all are everyone else.

78
00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:56.973
Okay, so now let us actually
play some tic-tac-toe, haha.

79
00:04:56.973 --> 00:05:01.587
So how can we get access to
the different squares in our board so

80
00:05:01.587 --> 00:05:07.820
that we can actually play some symbols in
there and play our game of tic-tac-toe.

81
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.096
So let's take a look at our HTML.

82
00:05:10.096 --> 00:05:12.982
We have this div with ID board,

83
00:05:12.982 --> 00:05:18.657
which represent the whole board here and
all of its squares.

84
00:05:18.657 --> 00:05:23.574
And within that div,
we have a bunch of these other divs,

85
00:05:23.574 --> 00:05:26.453
which have class equals square.

86
00:05:26.453 --> 00:05:30.817
So there's nine of them cuz we have
9 squares on a tic-tac-toe board.

87
00:05:30.817 --> 00:05:35.716
So how can we get access
to all of those squares so

88
00:05:35.716 --> 00:05:39.158
that then I can manipulate them.

89
00:05:39.158 --> 00:05:42.427
So as usual there's a couple of
different ways that we can do this.

90
00:05:42.427 --> 00:05:46.058
So one thing we can take
advantage of is the fact that,

91
00:05:46.058 --> 00:05:50.258
these square divs have this class
square applied to them, and

92
00:05:50.258 --> 00:05:54.236
nothing else in our document
has that class applied to it.

93
00:05:54.236 --> 00:05:58.945
So one thing we could do is we could use
the class of these elements to pick them

94
00:05:58.945 --> 00:05:59.911
out of the DOM.

95
00:05:59.911 --> 00:06:03.171
And there's a couple of
ways that we can do that.

96
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:07.812
So we could use our document spell,

97
00:06:07.812 --> 00:06:11.682
getElementsByClassName and

98
00:06:11.682 --> 00:06:17.260
pass in the name of
the class we care about.

99
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.614
That gives us this collection
of HTML elements, so

100
00:06:20.614 --> 00:06:23.502
nine of them that are all
these divs square.

101
00:06:23.502 --> 00:06:28.112
Or we could use a different way
of picking out elements by their

102
00:06:28.112 --> 00:06:31.492
class name which is
using our CSS selectors.

103
00:06:31.492 --> 00:06:34.711
So we could do document querySelector, and

104
00:06:34.711 --> 00:06:40.018
in this case we want querySelectorAll
because we want multiple things,

105
00:06:40.018 --> 00:06:43.846
we want all of the elements
matching class square and

106
00:06:43.846 --> 00:06:47.239
then we have to pass in
the CSS dial selector for

107
00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:52.820
an element with a certain class which
is gonna be .square, period square.

108
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.996
So that's gonna give us, it's a slightly
different type of collection but

109
00:06:56.996 --> 00:07:00.404
it's still giving us this
collection of these nine squares.

110
00:07:00.404 --> 00:07:02.164
So either of those will work.

111
00:07:02.164 --> 00:07:08.270
Or if we didn't have like class names to
go off of, we could also use the fact that

112
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:14.484
all of these divs these square divs are
contained within my div that has ID board.

113
00:07:14.484 --> 00:07:21.661
And so we already have access to
our board ID in our board variable.

114
00:07:21.661 --> 00:07:26.619
And we have a property built into elements
with children that is .children, so

115
00:07:26.619 --> 00:07:28.847
that's another thing we could do.

116
00:07:28.847 --> 00:07:31.012
Both would be valid here.

117
00:07:31.012 --> 00:07:36.717
Okay, so
now I want to play in the center square.

118
00:07:36.717 --> 00:07:40.984
I like to start there usually
when I play tic-tac-toe.

119
00:07:40.984 --> 00:07:46.145
So I'm going to try to pick out from
the squares array, the div that is so

120
00:07:46.145 --> 00:07:50.876
these divs go they go left to
right top to bottom, so 1, 2, 3,

121
00:07:50.876 --> 00:07:55.033
4, the fifth square in our
collection of nine squares.

122
00:07:55.033 --> 00:07:59.181
So that's gonna be squares, 4.

123
00:07:59.181 --> 00:08:05.043
And what I'm going to do is put some
textContent in here of my symbol.

124
00:08:06.737 --> 00:08:09.299
Okay, now it's your turn.

125
00:08:09.299 --> 00:08:11.942
Which square would you like to play in?

126
00:08:11.942 --> 00:08:14.015
Top left, bottom right.

127
00:08:14.015 --> 00:08:16.042
&gt;&gt; 0.
&gt;&gt; Left middle.

128
00:08:16.042 --> 00:08:16.892
&gt;&gt; Square 0.

129
00:08:16.892 --> 00:08:17.421
&gt;&gt; Top left.

130
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:18.185
&gt;&gt; Yes.

131
00:08:18.185 --> 00:08:19.483
&gt;&gt; Okay, so how do you do that?

132
00:08:19.483 --> 00:08:20.548
OJ, walk me through.

133
00:08:20.548 --> 00:08:24.899
&gt;&gt; Square 0.textContent = 0.

134
00:08:24.899 --> 00:08:27.885
&gt;&gt; Okay, well I'm not gonna
let you get off that easy.

135
00:08:27.885 --> 00:08:32.266
I don't want you to just type in
the letter the lazy way like I did.

136
00:08:32.266 --> 00:08:37.419
I want you to pull it out
of our players object

137
00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:43.560
which has the symbol that
each player is gonna play.

138
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.846
So for example the object with
name everyone else has symbol 0.

139
00:08:46.846 --> 00:08:48.521
So how could we do it that way?

140
00:08:48.521 --> 00:08:54.880
&gt;&gt; Players1.symbol.

141
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.331
&gt;&gt; Beautiful.

142
00:08:56.331 --> 00:08:59.070
Okay, so we get the idea,
we don't have to actually finish this

143
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.242
game cuz honestly every tic-tac-toe
game ends in a tie anyway, right?

144
00:09:02.242 --> 00:09:07.157
Like, is it just me, but you get the idea
and if you'd like to play with yourself or

145
00:09:07.157 --> 00:09:10.887
show maybe a friend at home,
how to do this and play with them.

146
00:09:10.887 --> 00:09:16.037
This is just to show that we
can interact with the document,

147
00:09:16.037 --> 00:09:20.981
using our array and
object superpowers that we now have to

148
00:09:20.981 --> 00:09:26.749
manipulate things even within collections,
which for example,

149
00:09:26.749 --> 00:09:32.115
when we looked at these squares,
it's not exactly an array.

150
00:09:32.115 --> 00:09:36.983
It's something called a node list,
which is kind of a built in representation

151
00:09:36.983 --> 00:09:41.132
that JavaScript has of nodes are kind
of elements in that DOM tree.

152
00:09:41.132 --> 00:09:45.911
But it operates similarly to an array,
meaning it has these indices so

153
00:09:45.911 --> 00:09:48.508
we can work with it just like an array.

154
00:09:48.508 --> 00:09:53.245
So this is all suffice it to say that we
can use our newfound powers to do all

155
00:09:53.245 --> 00:09:58.061
kinds of cool stuff to our websites to
make them do whatever we want because

156
00:09:58.061 --> 00:10:02.121
this whole game is about telling
computers to do what we want.

157
00:10:02.121 --> 00:10:06.706
So now we have some extra tools
in our tool belt to do that.

158
00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:09.558
Awesome Possum.

159
00:10:09.558 --> 00:10:10.922
Great work.

160
00:10:10.922 --> 00:10:13.532
Does anyone have questions so far?

161
00:10:15.467 --> 00:10:19.898
Who would win in a tic-tac-toe game
between me and the rest of everyone else?

162
00:10:19.898 --> 00:10:21.733
Hmm, probably all.

163
00:10:21.733 --> 00:10:23.511
[LAUGH]
