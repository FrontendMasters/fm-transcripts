1
00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:04.288
We have a hefty hefty course,
planned here.

2
00:00:04.288 --> 00:00:08.719
And I'm excited you all are along for
this wild roller coaster ride.

3
00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.417
We have three jam packed days
of JavaScript ahead of us, or

4
00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:16.421
three parts to the course if
you're watching the recordings.

5
00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:21.600
And in each part we're going to focus
on some kind of particular aspects or

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.196
topics or concepts in the language.

7
00:00:24.196 --> 00:00:27.235
And we're gonna do that by working
through a project, as I mentioned.

8
00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:31.769
So today in the morning we're gonna
spend most of our attention on

9
00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.252
the DOM the Document Object Model.

10
00:00:34.252 --> 00:00:38.513
So we're gonna start by talking
about where JavaScript fits into

11
00:00:38.513 --> 00:00:42.000
the overall website ecosystem,
with HTML and CSS and

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.346
we're gonna be talking
about data in JavaScript.

13
00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:49.148
And the different types of data that we
encounter and what even a type of data is.

14
00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:53.740
So we're gonna be looking at that in the
morning and then the afternoon we're going

15
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.936
to be talking about some ways that we
can group data together in JavaScript,

16
00:00:57.936 --> 00:01:02.413
namely constructs that we call arrays and
objects and how we can work with those.

17
00:01:02.413 --> 00:01:07.138
And throughout the day we're going to be
kind of messing with a little project

18
00:01:07.138 --> 00:01:11.430
where we will be using our JavaScript
knowledge to play tic-tac-toe

19
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.814
against our neighbors or
ourselves In the browser, so that's day 1.

20
00:01:15.814 --> 00:01:19.614
So day 1 we're gonna talk about
the values, the things in JavaScript,

21
00:01:19.614 --> 00:01:21.060
the entities in the world.

22
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.851
Day 2,
we're gonna talk about doing things.

23
00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:28.639
We're going to talk about functions which
are ways that we can carry out actions

24
00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:29.650
in JavaScript.

25
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.580
And we're gonna talk about events which
are things that we can react to when

26
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.995
the user does stiff.

27
00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:42.695
We can make JavaScript react to
the user behavior by means of events.

28
00:01:42.695 --> 00:01:45.523
And so,
we're gonna talk about how JavaScript and

29
00:01:45.523 --> 00:01:49.879
the browser handle events and what we
can do to make our websites interactive.

30
00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:51.444
And then in the afternoon,

31
00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:55.798
we're also gonna talk about how we can
control which code we're running and

32
00:01:55.798 --> 00:02:00.560
how we can decide what the program should
be doing at any given point in JavaScript,

33
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.534
by means of, for example,
branches with conditional statements.

34
00:02:04.534 --> 00:02:08.774
And then how we can also take chunks of
code that we need to run over and over and

35
00:02:08.774 --> 00:02:12.231
over again and make our lives
easier by running them in loops.

36
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:14.939
So we're gonna talk about branches and
loops tomorrow afternoon.

37
00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:20.244
And tomorrow's project, which we're
gonna work through throughout the day

38
00:02:20.244 --> 00:02:25.625
is going to be building a little quiz game
to quiz ourselves and our neighbors and

39
00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:30.631
our coursemates on how much JavaScript
we're remembering from day one.

40
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:32.195
By the time we get to day 3,

41
00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:36.361
we're going to be getting into some
of the trickier bits of JavaScript.

42
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:38.917
So we're gonna talk about fetching data,

43
00:02:38.917 --> 00:02:41.688
how we can grab data from
elsewhere on the web.

44
00:02:41.688 --> 00:02:46.293
And that means we're also gonna have
to talk about some a little bit more

45
00:02:46.293 --> 00:02:50.298
advanced concepts in JavaScript
such as a synchronous code.

46
00:02:50.298 --> 00:02:54.662
We're going to talk about what that means
and how JavaScript handles code that we

47
00:02:54.662 --> 00:02:58.782
don't know exactly how long it's gonna
take to run or when it's gonna run.

48
00:02:58.782 --> 00:03:02.053
So we're gonna talk about that because
that is a concept in JavaScript that's

49
00:03:02.053 --> 00:03:02.807
a little tricky.

50
00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:06.457
And we're also gonna spend the afternoon
talking about some of the kind of real

51
00:03:06.457 --> 00:03:10.231
life struggles that we're gonna have
if we're doing JavaScript development.

52
00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:13.949
So we're gonna talk about errors and
debugging, and

53
00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:18.988
how we can take the pieces of knowledge
that we've learned and then start

54
00:03:18.988 --> 00:03:24.205
kind of iteratively working through
our programs and working on our code.

55
00:03:24.205 --> 00:03:26.997
We're also gonna talk a little
bit about refactoring and

56
00:03:26.997 --> 00:03:30.789
things like that that we need to do in
order to make our code hopefully better.

57
00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:35.761
And we're gonna talk about dogs cuz
I'm a dog person, sorry cat people.

58
00:03:35.761 --> 00:03:40.623
So our day 3 project is going to
be a fun little dog related game,

59
00:03:40.623 --> 00:03:43.334
which yes is a pun on the word fetch.

60
00:03:43.334 --> 00:03:45.808
We'll get to that [LAUGH]
in a couple of days.

61
00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:48.511
So this is our grand plan.

62
00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:51.547
We're gonna be working
through it together.

63
00:03:51.547 --> 00:03:58.602
It's going to be an adventure, I'm excited
you all are along with me on this ride.

64
00:03:58.602 --> 00:04:05.869
And before we jump in just a couple
of expectations or ground rules.

65
00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:09.234
So first and foremost,
everyone belongs here in this course,

66
00:04:09.234 --> 00:04:11.455
whether you are in the room with me today,

67
00:04:11.455 --> 00:04:15.263
whether you are dialing in from all
around the world on the livestream,

68
00:04:15.263 --> 00:04:19.919
whether you're watching the recording at
home, after the course has been released.

69
00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.577
You belong here regardless of what your
experience level is, whether you've ever

70
00:04:24.577 --> 00:04:28.504
programmed before, whether you've
ever seen JavaScript or perhaps

71
00:04:28.504 --> 00:04:33.308
you've been working with JavaScript for
quite a long time, everyone belongs here.

72
00:04:33.308 --> 00:04:34.938
So let's please be mindful of that.

73
00:04:34.938 --> 00:04:39.370
And let's be really respectful of each
other's different perspectives and

74
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.878
different backgrounds.

75
00:04:40.878 --> 00:04:45.237
And keep in mind that anytime you have
a question, that is a good question,

76
00:04:45.237 --> 00:04:48.225
there is no such thing in
my mind as a dumb question.

77
00:04:48.225 --> 00:04:51.879
There is no such thing as a question
that doesn't deserve to be asked.

78
00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:56.168
First even if you think maybe you're
the only person in the world who has this

79
00:04:56.168 --> 00:04:57.722
question, you are wrong.

80
00:04:57.722 --> 00:05:01.174
If you have a question I guarantee
you somebody else has had or

81
00:05:01.174 --> 00:05:02.878
will have the same question.

82
00:05:02.878 --> 00:05:06.930
And the other thing I want us to focus
on is, yes we have a few projects to

83
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.742
complete, yes we have some topics we wanna
cover, but the goal for this course that

84
00:05:11.742 --> 00:05:16.259
I would like everybody to walk away with
is just to grow in our understanding.

85
00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.512
Maybe that's filling gaps in our
existing JavaScript knowledge.

86
00:05:19.512 --> 00:05:23.379
Maybe we've been working with JavaScript
for a while, or maybe it is encountering

87
00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:27.206
some of these concepts for the first time
and just getting a sense that they exist.

88
00:05:27.206 --> 00:05:30.810
Just so let's be focused
more on growing our skills,

89
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.892
on walking away with more knowledge and
more tools in our tool

90
00:05:34.892 --> 00:05:39.476
belt than we had before,
rather than hitting specific goalposts.

91
00:05:39.476 --> 00:05:42.696
So if you don't manage to
complete one of the exercises or

92
00:05:42.696 --> 00:05:47.460
if you don't manage to complete a project
the way that I've intended in the course,

93
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.069
that is not as important as,

94
00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:53.187
have you walked away with some new
insight that you didn't have before.

95
00:05:53.187 --> 00:05:56.280
So these are just kind
of the expectations.

96
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.282
And maybe before we move on,
does anyone have any comments or

97
00:06:00.282 --> 00:06:02.486
questions at the moment, yeah?

98
00:06:02.486 --> 00:06:07.398
&gt;&gt; Question about how much time
are we going to spend writing code.

99
00:06:07.398 --> 00:06:14.062
So maybe generally like lecture versus
type along versus like the projects.

100
00:06:14.062 --> 00:06:15.585
&gt;&gt; How much time are we
going to spend writing code?

101
00:06:15.585 --> 00:06:17.407
Well, basically as we go,

102
00:06:17.407 --> 00:06:21.865
we're going to be tinkering with
code pretty much continuously.

103
00:06:21.865 --> 00:06:24.762
So there will be a few parts where
we're kind of zooming out and

104
00:06:24.762 --> 00:06:28.440
talking a little bit more and thinking and
maybe even sketching to make sure our

105
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.136
mental models are kinda in
line with what's happening.

106
00:06:31.136 --> 00:06:36.061
But the most of the course you're gonna
be seeing little tiny snippets of code,

107
00:06:36.061 --> 00:06:39.222
where you can be tinkering along,
coding along and

108
00:06:39.222 --> 00:06:42.920
even just trying out other
things yourself in the browser.

109
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.674
And then we will also be having some
time to solve some dedicated exercises

110
00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:52.429
towards implementing our projects
that are probably be, I don't know,

111
00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:53.899
one for this section.

112
00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:59.399
We'll probably spend maybe 15 minutes
writing some code kind of on our own.

113
00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:05.468
So I would say expect to have your
laptop in front of you the whole time.

114
00:07:05.468 --> 00:07:09.874
We're gonna talk about where and
how we're gonna write JavaScript but

115
00:07:09.874 --> 00:07:12.308
with your JavaScript interface open.

116
00:07:12.308 --> 00:07:17.233
And as we go through we're gonna be
talking about the code that we're writing

117
00:07:17.233 --> 00:07:21.951
and especially on day one, it's gonna
be kind of short little snippets.

118
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:26.044
And as we go through later in the course
we'll be spending longer chunks of time

119
00:07:26.044 --> 00:07:26.859
writing code.
