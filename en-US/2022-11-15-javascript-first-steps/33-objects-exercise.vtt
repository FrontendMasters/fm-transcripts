1
00:00:00.183 --> 00:00:04.402
Let us try our hand at object summoning.

2
00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:11.839
So, we're gonna take a moment to
create an object that represents you.

3
00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.776
And you get to decide what
properties this object has and

4
00:00:15.776 --> 00:00:18.642
what values those properties point to.

5
00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:23.364
So for example, in my object, I'm going
to declare with const cuz I'm not gonna

6
00:00:23.364 --> 00:00:26.291
change, I'm gonna be Anjana
the rest of my life.

7
00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:27.847
So I'm gonna name it Anjana.

8
00:00:27.847 --> 00:00:32.990
And in this object, I'm going to declare
some properties that matter to me.

9
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.947
Like my home is in San Francisco.

10
00:00:35.947 --> 00:00:38.665
I speak a few different languages.

11
00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:42.366
So I'm gonna make an array value for
different languages.

12
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.438
I don't have a pet,
which makes me very sad.

13
00:00:44.438 --> 00:00:46.007
So pet is null.

14
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:48.753
I have a Vespa that I drive around.

15
00:00:48.753 --> 00:00:52.435
So that's my vehicle, and
I have an array of different hobbies.

16
00:00:52.435 --> 00:00:55.220
Now you get to decide
what is in your object.

17
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.072
Let's say put a name cuz your
name is how we refer to you.

18
00:00:59.072 --> 00:01:00.887
So let's have a name property, and

19
00:01:00.887 --> 00:01:04.228
then whatever other properties
you want of stuff you care about.

20
00:01:04.228 --> 00:01:07.475
Think about what you wanna
name the property and

21
00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:12.277
what type of value it makes sense for
that property to point to, okay?

22
00:01:12.277 --> 00:01:16.235
All right, let's take a break and
make our self objects.

23
00:01:19.916 --> 00:01:25.066
All right, so we got our objects,
we got ourselves in JavaScript form.

24
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.349
What properties did folks
put on their objects?

25
00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:31.057
Anything new that I didn't have up here?

26
00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:37.839
So we talked about one, for example,
maybe you have more than one vehicle.

27
00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:41.394
So OJ, you put what property?

28
00:01:41.394 --> 00:01:42.299
&gt;&gt; Vehicles.

29
00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.403
&gt;&gt; Vehicles.

30
00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:47.879
And what kind of value, what type of
value does vehicles point to in your-

31
00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:48.836
&gt;&gt; In another array.

32
00:01:48.836 --> 00:01:51.305
&gt;&gt; An array, right, for multiple things.

33
00:01:51.305 --> 00:01:56.045
Cool, did anybody else declare any
other properties on their object?

34
00:01:56.045 --> 00:01:57.497
&gt;&gt; I put my kids names.

35
00:01:57.497 --> 00:02:00.101
&gt;&gt; Kids, kids is a great one.

36
00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:03.073
Or kids names, yeah.

37
00:02:03.073 --> 00:02:05.137
Anything else?

38
00:02:05.137 --> 00:02:06.845
Maybe from the chat, yeah?

39
00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:08.122
&gt;&gt; Pet type.

40
00:02:08.122 --> 00:02:09.855
&gt;&gt; Pet type, yeah.

41
00:02:09.855 --> 00:02:13.129
Pet type, exactly, and
what value did you have for that?

42
00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:13.814
&gt;&gt; Dog.

43
00:02:13.814 --> 00:02:16.498
&gt;&gt; Dog, so string dog, gotcha.

44
00:02:16.498 --> 00:02:21.881
Nice, cool, so this is just suffice
it to say that objects are whatever

45
00:02:21.881 --> 00:02:26.293
we make them to be,
we can decide what the properties are.

46
00:02:26.293 --> 00:02:30.749
&gt;&gt; In chat, they put programming
languages, JavaScript and Python.

47
00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:32.057
&gt;&gt; Yes, programming languages.

48
00:02:32.057 --> 00:02:35.879
Everybody now at least has one new
programming language to add to their

49
00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.943
objects, which is JavaScript,
we're working on it.

50
00:02:38.943 --> 00:02:43.929
&gt;&gt; So if you want to do like pets and
you want it to have multiple values,

51
00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:48.737
can you create a sub object within
the pet kinda thing and it says,

52
00:02:48.737 --> 00:02:53.040
I don't know, dog one,
whatever, dog two, whatever?

53
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we have here, we already
have a couple of examples of using

54
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.787
an array as a value within
the object to store multiple things.

55
00:03:01.787 --> 00:03:05.235
In my example, it was languages and
hobbies are both kind of plurals.

56
00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:07.746
So we have multiple
things in an array there.

57
00:03:07.746 --> 00:03:11.974
But we'll actually a little bit later,
see that we can nest objects and

58
00:03:11.974 --> 00:03:15.583
arrays within each other,
as much as we want in JavaScript.

59
00:03:15.583 --> 00:03:18.641
So we can create kind of like
a Russian doll situation.

60
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:21.411
We'll look at a couple examples later,
great question.

61
00:03:21.411 --> 00:03:27.279
We had a question about array.join,
and I would say that in general,

62
00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:32.752
if you're wondering,
does this particular thing like .join,

63
00:03:32.752 --> 00:03:35.653
does it work with this time value?

64
00:03:35.653 --> 00:03:36.983
Or does it work with that kind of value?

65
00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:38.652
Or what happens in that case?

66
00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:42.041
So I would say as I have
been saying the whole time,

67
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:45.363
you can check out the full
documentation on MDN.

68
00:03:45.363 --> 00:03:50.436
To figure out what type of stuff you can
pass into it, what options you have,

69
00:03:50.436 --> 00:03:55.352
like for example with join, you don't
even have to pass in a separator and

70
00:03:55.352 --> 00:03:58.159
it will just join them with no separator.

71
00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:03.140
But if you're wondering kind of
like what happens if I pass in

72
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.589
some other separator there?

73
00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:08.877
Then you can check out the documentation,

74
00:04:08.877 --> 00:04:13.625
and usually that'll answer your questions,
as generally,

75
00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:19.471
usually that'll answer any questions
you have about a specific operator or

76
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:23.419
keyword or a spell on a string,
that sort of thing.

77
00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.380
We had another question about
another specific method,

78
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.215
which is called freeze, Object.freeze.

79
00:04:32.215 --> 00:04:37.764
This is a trick in JavaScript
that we can use to essentially

80
00:04:37.764 --> 00:04:42.758
freeze an object in place and
make it immutable ish.

81
00:04:42.758 --> 00:04:46.626
There's an asterisk on that,
make it immutable ish and

82
00:04:46.626 --> 00:04:50.756
never be able to change from how
it was when it was declared.

83
00:04:50.756 --> 00:04:55.400
So for example,
I could freeze my Anjana object if I

84
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.612
think I'm never gonna get a pet,
let's say.

85
00:04:59.612 --> 00:05:00.829
My pet is always gonna be a null.

86
00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:02.192
That would be a very sad life.

87
00:05:02.192 --> 00:05:04.119
I hope I get a pet someday.

88
00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:06.723
[LAUGH] But I could freeze it in place so

89
00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:10.936
that I cannot re-assign to
the properties I already have.

90
00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:15.803
And I cannot do what I did before
when I did dot snack equals and

91
00:05:15.803 --> 00:05:18.778
just insert a new property in there.

92
00:05:18.778 --> 00:05:22.864
So again, if you wanna know more
details about how freeze works,

93
00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:25.028
check out the MDN documentation.

94
00:05:25.028 --> 00:05:30.339
And then I think we had another
question about the spread operator or

95
00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:31.652
spread syntax.

96
00:05:31.652 --> 00:05:32.582
Is that right?

97
00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:33.287
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

98
00:05:33.287 --> 00:05:36.890
&gt;&gt; And that is something we are going
to come back and talk to later,

99
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.713
talk about later in the course.

100
00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:42.593
Talk to,
I guess we could talk to JavaScript.

101
00:05:42.593 --> 00:05:44.197
So let's put a pin in that.

102
00:05:44.197 --> 00:05:47.870
We're gonna come back to that later.

103
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.039
But if you wanna get a jump on things,
you can look up dot, dot,

104
00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:53.943
dot in the MDN documentation
