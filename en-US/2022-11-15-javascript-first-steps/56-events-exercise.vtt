1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.533
Okay, so let's try out our
newfound event handling powers.

2
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.310
What we're gonna do is,
just for right now,

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.912
we're not actually gonna put this code
in our text file, in our HTML file,

4
00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:16.591
we're just gonna try it out in
the console on our quiz page.

5
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:19.271
So I have this my in progress quiz page,

6
00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:23.355
we're gonna try out a couple
of different event handlers.

7
00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:27.244
So, see if you can try
doing any of these things.

8
00:00:27.244 --> 00:00:34.876
For example, we could capitalize
the text of a button when it's clicked,

9
00:00:34.876 --> 00:00:39.359
or we could change some
text to be hovering or

10
00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:45.556
to be some other thing when
the mouse moves over the element.

11
00:00:45.556 --> 00:00:49.133
So let's take a moment,
a couple of minutes to try this out, and

12
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:52.455
then we'll talk about some
handlers we could attach here.

13
00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:57.902
Let's try it out.

14
00:00:57.902 --> 00:01:03.433
So how about capitalizing the text of
the true button when it's clicked?

15
00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:10.030
So what element am I gonna need
to attach the event listener to?

16
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.668
&gt;&gt; Mine's B, cuz it's button is 0.

17
00:01:14.668 --> 00:01:21.954
&gt;&gt; Okay, so maybe I already have
a variable kind of capturing this.

18
00:01:21.954 --> 00:01:26.772
Do I have, I have optionButtons,
I could get optionButtons[0],

19
00:01:26.772 --> 00:01:29.340
for example, is the true button.

20
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.935
Yeah, cool.

21
00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:39.970
So let me, I'm just gonna capture that,
And a variable.

22
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.753
Okay, so how can I add a listener to
the click event on this true button?

23
00:01:45.753 --> 00:01:49.182
&gt;&gt; trueButton.addEventListener.

24
00:01:49.182 --> 00:01:52.360
&gt;&gt; .addEventListener, and
JavaScript's already helping me out.

25
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.960
And then what's the first
argument I need to pass in?

26
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.346
&gt;&gt; Mouseover.

27
00:01:57.346 --> 00:02:01.830
&gt;&gt; So in this case, we want to do
something when somebody clicks the button.

28
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.151
So the name of the event that we want is,
I think you were about to say it, Jay.

29
00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:05.672
&gt;&gt; Click.

30
00:02:05.672 --> 00:02:07.510
&gt;&gt; Click, exactly.

31
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.187
Now, we could attach a mouseover handler
to this button also, but in this case,

32
00:02:11.187 --> 00:02:15.120
we were saying, let's try to do
something when the button is clicked.

33
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.430
So we can have click.

34
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.610
And then what we wanted to do is
capitalize the text of the button.

35
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.899
So we're gonna need to give a handler
function that does just that.

36
00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:36.450
So how can I declare my handler function
using our good friend, the fat arrow?

37
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.307
What do I need to type here?

38
00:02:39.307 --> 00:02:40.210
&gt;&gt; Open parenthesis event.

39
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.476
&gt;&gt; Open parenthesis, and
we could capture the event, if we want to.

40
00:02:45.476 --> 00:02:48.526
Let's see if we're gonna need it.

41
00:02:48.526 --> 00:02:49.614
And then =&gt;.

42
00:02:49.614 --> 00:02:53.129
And now,
since I might want to put multiple

43
00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.730
lines of code in this arrow function,
how can I do that?

44
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.350
&gt;&gt; Curly braces.
&gt;&gt; Curly braces, exactly, nice.

45
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.928
Okay, so now I've got my body
of my function, and now,

46
00:03:07.928 --> 00:03:13.291
what I wanna do is capitalize
the text of this button.

47
00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:17.819
So does anybody remember
how we can do that, yeah?

48
00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:18.609
&gt;&gt; textContent.

49
00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.426
&gt;&gt; Okay, so trueButton-
&gt;&gt; .textContent.

50
00:03:21.426 --> 00:03:23.600
&gt;&gt; textContent.

51
00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:32.585
&gt;&gt; And then you would just =
trueButton.textContent.toUpper

52
00:03:32.585 --> 00:03:36.859
&gt;&gt; So trueButton.textContent, sorry,

53
00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.629
you said, toUpperCase.

54
00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:40.847
&gt;&gt; UpperCase.

55
00:03:40.847 --> 00:03:42.716
&gt;&gt; Like that?
Let's try it out.

56
00:03:42.716 --> 00:03:48.414
Okay, I'm missing something here.

57
00:03:48.414 --> 00:03:50.190
And my syntax,
I've tried to press Enter and

58
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.439
it wouldn't even let me cuz I'm missing
something, anybody noticed what it is?

59
00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:54.809
&gt;&gt; It's an ending.

60
00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:57.793
&gt;&gt; An ending parenthesis, yeah.

61
00:03:57.793 --> 00:04:02.863
So what we had here, and we'll see that
the console is somewhat helping me out.

62
00:04:02.863 --> 00:04:06.824
I had initially opened the parentheses,
but then when I added more parentheses

63
00:04:06.824 --> 00:04:10.209
around my events here, it closed them,
it auto closed them for me.

64
00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.924
So I needed to add that
extra closing parenthesis.

65
00:04:12.924 --> 00:04:15.710
And then yes,
I could put a semicolon also.

66
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.289
So now, let's see what happens.

67
00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.676
We did it, lovely.

68
00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:27.511
Okay, how about doing something when
I move my mouse into the h1 element?

69
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:34.565
So the h1 element here is this
Quiz.js at the top of the page.

70
00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:39.290
So what I want to happen is,
basically, when my mouse

71
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.333
goes in to the Quiz.js,
I want to change it to hovering.

72
00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:49.352
So what event did we just
see a minute ago that

73
00:04:49.352 --> 00:04:56.960
indicates when your mouse has
entered an element area on the page?

74
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.097
&gt;&gt; Mouseover.

75
00:04:58.097 --> 00:05:00.077
&gt;&gt; Mouseover.

76
00:05:00.077 --> 00:05:06.064
Okay, so let's grab my h1 element,
first of all, how can I do that?

77
00:05:07.338 --> 00:05:10.900
We have our good friend, document.

78
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:18.112
And let's check out our inspector,
what do we have to work with in this h1?

79
00:05:18.112 --> 00:05:22.450
Well, we don't really have any ID or
anything like that, so

80
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.540
I guess Iâ€™m gonna have to use the name h1,
the tag name here.

81
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.540
Couple of ways I can do that, but
does anybody remember one of them,

82
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.897
to grab that h1 element
out of the document?

83
00:05:35.897 --> 00:05:36.775
&gt;&gt; GetElementsById.

84
00:05:36.775 --> 00:05:40.078
&gt;&gt; ByName.
&gt;&gt; So we don't actually have an ID on this

85
00:05:40.078 --> 00:05:45.122
element, so unfortunately,
that's not gonna work here.

86
00:05:45.122 --> 00:05:47.189
The other suggestion was?

87
00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:50.488
&gt;&gt; ByName.
&gt;&gt; ByName, okay, so let's keep in mind,

88
00:05:50.488 --> 00:05:52.835
we have two very similar things.

89
00:05:52.835 --> 00:05:56.144
We have getElementsByName,
which is looking for

90
00:05:56.144 --> 00:06:01.360
the name attribute on the element,
which unfortunately we don't have here.

91
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.337
But we also have getElementsByTagName,
which is gonna look for

92
00:06:07.337 --> 00:06:11.217
the actual HTML tag that this element is.

93
00:06:11.217 --> 00:06:14.706
So we could use that one with h1.

94
00:06:14.706 --> 00:06:18.387
But now,
what happens if I run this code like this?

95
00:06:20.116 --> 00:06:21.987
What is the value of h1 gonna be?

96
00:06:23.804 --> 00:06:25.650
Is it gonna be a single element?

97
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.850
Let's find out.

98
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.032
Okay, let's take a look.

99
00:06:33.032 --> 00:06:37.281
So now h1 is, so
it's actually a collection of elements, or

100
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:40.402
essentially kind of
a grouping of elements.

101
00:06:40.402 --> 00:06:44.964
It sort of functions like an array
of elements because we had

102
00:06:44.964 --> 00:06:47.712
getElementsByTagName, plural.

103
00:06:47.712 --> 00:06:52.606
So if I want to change the value of my
h1 variable to be just the h1 element,

104
00:06:52.606 --> 00:06:57.990
which is essentially the only thing inside
of this collection, how can I do that?

105
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.905
Reassign the variable to, The first

106
00:07:04.905 --> 00:07:08.726
thing in an array or a list of things?

107
00:07:08.726 --> 00:07:09.565
&gt;&gt; Index 0.

108
00:07:09.565 --> 00:07:10.200
&gt;&gt; Index 0, yeah.

109
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.903
So I can do that by grabbing
my current value of h1, and

110
00:07:14.903 --> 00:07:20.645
then using square brackets to ask for
the item at index 0, right?

111
00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:23.487
So let's see now, h1 is this h1 element.

112
00:07:23.487 --> 00:07:25.676
Great, okay, cool.

113
00:07:25.676 --> 00:07:30.008
So now, how do I attach an event
listener that's gonna know

114
00:07:30.008 --> 00:07:33.140
when my mouse has moved over that element?

115
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.681
Let's make some space.

116
00:07:35.681 --> 00:07:38.617
So I'm gonna do h1.addEventListener.

117
00:07:38.617 --> 00:07:44.051
The first thing I need to pass in
is the name of the event, which is?

118
00:07:44.051 --> 00:07:44.960
&gt;&gt; Mouseover.

119
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.086
&gt;&gt; Mouseover, in this case.

120
00:07:48.086 --> 00:07:51.580
And then we're gonna have
another arrow function.

121
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:56.322
And in this case, we're not really gonna
even need the event object too much, so

122
00:07:56.322 --> 00:07:58.010
I'm just not including it.

123
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.302
And now, we wanna change the text of h1,

124
00:08:01.302 --> 00:08:06.780
which is pretty similar to what we
did before, we had textContent.

125
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:10.502
Yeah, we could use, for example.

126
00:08:10.502 --> 00:08:15.030
And then I think we said
we want to be hovering.

127
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.910
Okay, does this look right too, folks?

128
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.074
I'm seeing some nodding.

129
00:08:23.074 --> 00:08:24.040
Let's try it out.

130
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:31.751
Okay, so now if we did our jobs right,
now, up, there it went.

131
00:08:31.751 --> 00:08:32.400
Look at that.

132
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.069
Now, what happens?
Now, right now,

133
00:08:35.069 --> 00:08:38.170
I'm still hovering over this element,
what happens when I leave it?

134
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:42.854
What do you think is gonna happen when I
move the mouse away from this element?

135
00:08:42.854 --> 00:08:46.680
I heard nothing, and I saw shrugs.

136
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.896
Exactly, yes.
So right now,

137
00:08:47.896 --> 00:08:52.443
we've only listened to the mouseover
event, which just listens for,

138
00:08:52.443 --> 00:08:56.628
basically, the first time
the pointer moves over that element.

139
00:08:56.628 --> 00:09:00.690
So if we want to change our text back to,
I think it was Quiz.js,

140
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.814
we can listen for another event.

141
00:09:02.814 --> 00:09:04.543
Does anyone remember what it was?

142
00:09:06.926 --> 00:09:07.775
Karl?

143
00:09:07.775 --> 00:09:09.516
&gt;&gt; Mouseout.
&gt;&gt; Mouseout, yeah.

144
00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:12.470
These are just, eventually, you'll get
used to the names of these events,

145
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:13.790
it's pretty arbitrary.

146
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.422
But yes, there is another mouseout event.

147
00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:21.264
So by this point, we're getting pretty
used to it, so I can attach my listener,

148
00:09:21.264 --> 00:09:21.986
mouseout.

149
00:09:21.986 --> 00:09:29.272
And then I can do something
else to the textContent,

150
00:09:29.272 --> 00:09:36.404
like put it back to Quiz.js,
for example, okay?

151
00:09:36.404 --> 00:09:40.721
So now, up, Up, up, up, up, it's fun.

152
00:09:40.721 --> 00:09:44.919
[LAUGH] We've got something
happening on our page now.

153
00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:48.132
So now, this is a pretty simple one,
it's just changing the text.

154
00:09:48.132 --> 00:09:52.484
But you can imagine that this is the same
skill you would need to do those fancy

155
00:09:52.484 --> 00:09:57.176
effects that web pages you've seen do when
you hover over an element and it glows or

156
00:09:57.176 --> 00:09:57.861
whatever.

157
00:09:57.861 --> 00:10:02.205
We can do whatever we want, we can
apply CSS, we can change the content,

158
00:10:02.205 --> 00:10:03.780
we can do other things.

159
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.284
So look at our superpowers now, amazing.

160
00:10:07.284 --> 00:10:10.720
Now, what do you think is gonna
happen if I refresh the page?

161
00:10:13.156 --> 00:10:16.330
Are these events still
gonna to be listened to?

162
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.199
No, I'm seeing shaking heads.

163
00:10:19.199 --> 00:10:22.495
And indeed, no,
because I did this all in the console,

164
00:10:22.495 --> 00:10:27.040
the lifetime of that is only while
this particular document exists.

165
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:32.670
So if I want to make these kinds of
changes part of my webpage that's

166
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:37.914
always there, we're gonna have
to put them in our text file.

167
00:10:37.914 --> 00:10:42.358
Okay, so now, it's handled,
our events are handled.

168
00:10:42.358 --> 00:10:47.764
And we can take this and
we're gonna need a couple more things in

169
00:10:47.764 --> 00:10:53.583
order to make our quiz game actually
respond to the user's answer.
