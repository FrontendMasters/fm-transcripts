1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.368
In this course, we started with a T-Net
new brand new Web API project, and

2
00:00:04.368 --> 00:00:07.903
evolved it all the way down to using
end entity framework core with

3
00:00:07.903 --> 00:00:11.440
a real database,
complete with unit tests for everything.

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.960
We went over HTTP and
how it relates to ASP.NET Core,

5
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.608
how ASP.NET Core processes and uses that
HTTP request to create objects for itself.

6
00:00:20.608 --> 00:00:25.929
We went through, we created our minimal
APIs, we converted them to controllers.

7
00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:30.029
We've talked about the repository pattern,
which is very popular out in the field.

8
00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.100
And we talked about entity framework core
and how it really is a good substitute for

9
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.399
the repository pattern.

10
00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:41.329
We also talked about some of the more
advanced features of ASP.Net Core,

11
00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.487
like middleware and filters.

12
00:00:43.487 --> 00:00:47.839
We talked about adding logging, and we
talked about auditing entities as well to

13
00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.719
add specific properties to
entities at the very end,

14
00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.147
in case you wanna track who made
a change to an object, for instance.

15
00:00:55.147 --> 00:00:59.378
We talked a lot about EF Core, we went
really in depth on how EF Core works,

16
00:00:59.378 --> 00:01:01.428
how you construct your Db Context,

17
00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:06.006
how you set up your Db Sets how you run
migrations against real databases in order

18
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:10.817
to make sure that your database tables
are set up and ready to receive real data.

19
00:01:10.817 --> 00:01:15.137
Finally, we wrapped up by talking
about security and ASP Net Core.

20
00:01:15.137 --> 00:01:18.743
We touched on it at a very high level, but
we talked about a few of the components,

21
00:01:18.743 --> 00:01:22.367
like the authorize attribute that you use
to protect resources within your API.

22
00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:23.710
I wanna thank you all for being here,

23
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.666
you've been a great audience
with great questions.

24
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:28.783
I really appreciate your
engagement with the material, and

25
00:01:28.783 --> 00:01:32.279
it's been a pleasure to teach for
you today and thank you very much.

26
00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:35.310
