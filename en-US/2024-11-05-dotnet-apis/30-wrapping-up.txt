>> Spencer Schneidenbach: In this course, we started with a T-Net new brand new Web API project, and evolved it all the way down to using end entity framework core with a real database, complete with unit tests for everything. We went over HTTP and how it relates to ASP.NET Core, how ASP.NET Core processes and uses that HTTP request to create objects for itself.

[00:00:20]
We went through, we created our minimal APIs, we converted them to controllers. We've talked about the repository pattern, which is very popular out in the field. And we talked about entity framework core and how it really is a good substitute for the repository pattern. We also talked about some of the more advanced features of ASP.Net Core, like middleware and filters.

[00:00:43]
We talked about adding logging, and we talked about auditing entities as well to add specific properties to entities at the very end, in case you wanna track who made a change to an object, for instance. We talked a lot about EF Core, we went really in depth on how EF Core works, how you construct your Db Context, how you set up your Db Sets how you run migrations against real databases in order to make sure that your database tables are set up and ready to receive real data.

[00:01:10]
Finally, we wrapped up by talking about security and ASP Net Core. We touched on it at a very high level, but we talked about a few of the components, like the authorize attribute that you use to protect resources within your API. I wanna thank you all for being here, you've been a great audience with great questions.

[00:01:25]
I really appreciate your engagement with the material, and it's been a pleasure to teach for you today and thank you very much.
