00:00:00.085 --> 00:00:02.667
&gt;&gt; Spencer Schneidenbach: A brief
overview of everything we've done.

2
00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:06.364
We have run through the gauntlet, we have
made an application that I am frankly

3
00:00:06.364 --> 00:00:09.065
very proud of because it is
something that I would write.

4
00:00:09.065 --> 00:00:13.289
It is covered by tests, it is well
organized, it is well documented,

5
00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.524
it's all the things that I
personally love in an API.

6
00:00:16.524 --> 00:00:19.958
We removed the in-memory repository,
that stupid list, and

7
00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:23.019
we replaced it with a real,
actual database, SQLite.

8
00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.910
We seeded that database, we extended the
get all employees endpoint to add a way

9
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.345
to filter and paginate data,
which is very important.

10
00:00:31.345 --> 00:00:33.852
We changed the way we modeled and
handled benefits, and

11
00:00:33.852 --> 00:00:35.889
we did a lot of database
stuff under the hood.

12
00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:38.475
We took in what I would consider to be,
in this course,

13
00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:40.066
the most significant refactor.

14
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.426
So, it's pretty crazy.

15
00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:45.426
We made a decision early on
to use request objects and

16
00:00:45.426 --> 00:00:48.983
I thought this was a good
opportunity to kind of revisit that.

17
00:00:48.983 --> 00:00:54.520
When you get into something like EF Core
where you have a series of entities

18
00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.617
where they all are related in some way and
those relationships go down very deep.

19
00:01:00.617 --> 00:01:05.312
You will find that request objects really,
really do start to pay off,

20
00:01:05.312 --> 00:01:09.540
because the moment you try to
return stop returning entities and

21
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.798
start returning request objects is when
you stop getting into certain issues.

22
00:01:14.798 --> 00:01:18.337
I had a client that had
a very complex data set, and

23
00:01:18.337 --> 00:01:21.045
they did return entities right away.

24
00:01:21.045 --> 00:01:24.794
And they found that suddenly some
of their APIs were failing because

25
00:01:24.794 --> 00:01:28.619
JSON was finding circular dependencies,
or circular properties.

26
00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.295
Properties that refer back to one another
between two objects or the data model was

27
00:01:33.295 --> 00:01:38.192
returning megabytes of data when really it
only needed to return not even a kilobyte.

28
00:01:38.192 --> 00:01:41.353
So the impact of this
cannot be understated.

29
00:01:41.353 --> 00:01:45.364
We did this early on, it may seem
like a small thing that we did, but

30
00:01:45.364 --> 00:01:48.528
it actually down the road
as our application grows.

31
00:01:48.528 --> 00:01:50.690
It does have huge implications, and

32
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.978
it does respect the single
responsibility principle.

33
00:01:53.978 --> 00:01:57.452
Unittaskers in the kitchen, maybe not,

34
00:01:57.452 --> 00:02:01.729
unitaskers in real in programming,
definitely.

35
00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.722
So that the remainder of the course,
cuz we are at the end,

36
00:02:04.722 --> 00:02:08.514
I'm gonna show you just a couple of
other things that I think are useful for

37
00:02:08.514 --> 00:02:11.296
you to know,
things that common patterns that I see.

38
00:02:11.296 --> 00:02:13.129
I'm gonna talk a little
bit about security,

39
00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:14.921
because I do think it's worth mentioning.

40
00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:19.795
I'm gonna demonstrate a little bit
of security inside of a sample

41
00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:23.794
project that you can take and
write run from the code.

42
00:02:23.794 --> 00:02:26.381
And we're gonna talk about
using actual real databases,

43
00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:29.600
not just SQLite, because there
are problems with using SQLite, but for

44
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.212
the purposes of this application,
it works pretty well.

45
00:02:32.212 --> 00:02:36.077
However, the thing that I'm gonna give you
will allow you to use a real database,

46
00:02:36.077 --> 00:02:39.272
a real Postgres database, or
SQL Server database if you want, and

47
00:02:39.272 --> 00:02:40.239
very easy to learn.
