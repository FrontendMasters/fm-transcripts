00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.128
Welcome, I am so excited to be here today
to talk to you about ASP.NET Core and

2
00:00:04.128 --> 00:00:06.190
building API with ASP.NET Core.

3
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.340
My name is Spencer and I am gonna take
you on a little bit of a journey.

4
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.564
But first I'm gonna open up with just
a little bit of a bold statement that I

5
00:00:12.564 --> 00:00:16.820
believe that .NET is the best platform for
building web apps in the world.

6
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.550
Now, I believe this because I've been
writing software for about 15 years, and

7
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.806
I have used a huge ton of frameworks,
and the one that gives me the most joy,

8
00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:29.801
the one that I love writing every day,
is still ASP.NET Core.

9
00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:31.084
Those are... Building APIs

10
00:00:31.084 --> 00:00:35.251
in ASP.NET Core is still the thing
that I have the most fun doing.

11
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:39.187
A little bit about me, I am the President
and CTO of Aviron Software, so

12
00:00:39.187 --> 00:00:43.126
we are a software consultancy that
does primarily .NET development,

13
00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:46.123
so I was able to build this
just mostly by doing .NET.

14
00:00:46.123 --> 00:00:51.673
We also do some React and Microsoft Azure
and React Native mobile apps as well.

15
00:00:51.673 --> 00:00:56.051
I've been recognized for about ten years
as a Microsoft MVP with my award category

16
00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:59.479
being in the development space,
specifically ASP.NET Core,

17
00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:01.306
if you can believe that.

18
00:01:01.306 --> 00:01:06.095
And I have been a .NET consultant for
my company's been around for about four

19
00:01:06.095 --> 00:01:10.896
years, but I've been a .NET consultant for
probably almost all my career.

20
00:01:10.896 --> 00:01:13.406
I started out on a website
similar to indeed.com, and

21
00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:17.279
when I got paid 75 bucks to write a stored
procedure, I did it in like 15 minutes,

22
00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:19.316
and I was like, Okay, this is really cool.

23
00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:24.311
And I've never stopped being a .NET
consultant from there, I've also spoken

24
00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:29.413
around the world at many conferences
around about ASP.NET Core topics.

25
00:01:29.413 --> 00:01:33.451
And so the culmination of all of that
experience went into building this

26
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:34.993
workshop.

27
00:01:34.993 --> 00:01:40.806
So the goal here is to teach you how I
build web APIs using ASP.NET Core and

28
00:01:40.806 --> 00:01:41.510
.NET.

29
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.762
It's built from the ground up
to be pragmatic, practical,

30
00:01:44.762 --> 00:01:48.520
you can take 99% of this code and
apply it to your job, and the 1%,

31
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.150
I will call out and
tell you don't do this.

32
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.881
But what I plan to do is take us
on a little bit of a journey, so

33
00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:58.710
I'm going to take us to starting
out from .NET New Project.

34
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.086
I'm gonna build an API from scratch and

35
00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:05.989
what I'm gonna do from there is refactor
it and slowly make it more complicated.

36
00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:07.423
I'm gonna show you tools and

37
00:02:07.423 --> 00:02:11.739
things about ASP.NET Core along the way
that you'll use in your day to day.

38
00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.354
It's built from all of the experience
that I have building APIs,

39
00:02:15.354 --> 00:02:18.659
real APIs in real production environments.

40
00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.403
Now, I wanna make sure that, make sure to
let you know that there's no ivory towers,

41
00:02:22.403 --> 00:02:25.068
I'm not telling you that there's
one true way to do things.

42
00:02:25.068 --> 00:02:28.797
These are the things that I have done in
my career that have made helped make me

43
00:02:28.797 --> 00:02:31.498
successful and
build really good APIs for my clients.

44
00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:35.379
I also believe in minimizing
magic in code, and what I mean

45
00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.626
by that is that sometimes things just work
and you don't necessarily understand why,

46
00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:41.855
I want to pull back that
curtain a little bit.

47
00:02:41.855 --> 00:02:45.155
So as we go,
I will be digging into the source code for

48
00:02:45.155 --> 00:02:49.955
ASP.NET Core here and there, just to
kind of show you and get you used to it.

49
00:02:49.955 --> 00:02:53.052
I read source codes
surprisingly a lot when,

50
00:02:53.052 --> 00:02:56.485
especially when debugging
like nuanced issues.

51
00:02:57.985 --> 00:03:01.536
So the tooling that we use,
will allow you to dig right into that,

52
00:03:01.536 --> 00:03:05.829
I do want to talk a little bit about why
you should choose to use ASP.NET Core.

53
00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.341
First of all, there's a ton of jobs
in the market, I have a consultancy,

54
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:11.379
as I mentioned, I have about ten people.

55
00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.304
Four years ago I started myself by myself,
and

56
00:03:14.304 --> 00:03:19.624
then three years later I had about eight
people, and now I have 11 or 12 or so.

57
00:03:19.624 --> 00:03:22.558
So there's lots of jobs,
there's lots of work to be done,

58
00:03:22.558 --> 00:03:26.494
there's lots of interest in the
marketplace for ASP.NET Core specifically,

59
00:03:26.494 --> 00:03:30.244
I find that it's fun to use and write,
I have always connected with .NET.

60
00:03:30.244 --> 00:03:34.755
It was my first programing platform, but
after being exposed to all the other ones,

61
00:03:34.755 --> 00:03:36.914
I've connected with it the best I have,

62
00:03:36.914 --> 00:03:39.663
the most fun when I'm writing APIs for
.NET Core.

63
00:03:41.613 --> 00:03:43.179
It's open source and cross platform,

64
00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.943
and I think that's really important,
I get questions all the time.

65
00:03:45.943 --> 00:03:47.393
Isn't Microsoft closed source?

66
00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:48.953
Don't you have to have windows?

67
00:03:48.953 --> 00:03:51.893
I'm gonna be doing all of this development
that you're seeing on a Macintosh.

68
00:03:51.893 --> 00:03:57.313
I don't use windows if I can help it, and
I use .NET almost exclusively on a Mac.

69
00:03:58.693 --> 00:04:02.463
We have a strong developer, ecosystem as
well, and what I mean by that is that

70
00:04:02.463 --> 00:04:06.291
there's a lot of people using the
platform, so that means that, naturally,

71
00:04:06.291 --> 00:04:10.064
there's going to be a lot of people that
contribute to that platform.

72
00:04:10.064 --> 00:04:12.853
There's a lot of open source projects,
some of them that we will bring

73
00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:14.954
into our project to kind of
help us do certain tasks.

74
00:04:16.144 --> 00:04:20.207
It's highly performant and scalable,
it's modern and secure and backed by.

75
00:04:20.207 --> 00:04:24.309
One of my favorite tech companies in
the world, which is Microsoft, and

76
00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:26.067
plays nicely with others.

77
00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:29.647
My favorite pairing for
ASP.NET Core is React, actually.

78
00:04:29.647 --> 00:04:32.762
If I'm making a single page app,
if I'm starting one from scratch,

79
00:04:32.762 --> 00:04:35.677
it's almost certainly gonna be
React backed by ASP.NET Core.

80
00:04:37.327 --> 00:04:41.659
So as I mentioned, this course is designed
to give you kind of my summation of my

81
00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:45.463
real world experience,
this is how I build real APIs.

82
00:04:45.463 --> 00:04:48.103
We're gonna do source code deep dives,
at least here and there,

83
00:04:48.103 --> 00:04:50.169
I'm gonna show you
professional best practices,

84
00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.433
as well as show you a few things
that I think you should avoid.

85
00:04:53.433 --> 00:04:57.198
And all of the examples are practical,
so you'll be able to follow along, and

86
00:04:57.198 --> 00:04:59.263
we'll go into that here just in a little bit.

87
00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.219
Last thing I'll say is that I'm
pretty opinionated, if you watched

88
00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:09.109
my previous C sharp, course, none of this
should be any of any surprise to you.

89
00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:10.642
However, when it comes to ASP.NET Core,

90
00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:13.469
I'm extra extra opinionated because
this is where the rubber meets the road.

91
00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:15.153
This is where you're actually going in and

92
00:05:15.153 --> 00:05:18.629
building production level
applications is using this framework.

93
00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:22.558
So anything that you see That has
the three chili peppers on it,

94
00:05:22.558 --> 00:05:25.684
that's my spicy take, and
I have plenty of them.
