&gt;&gt; Mike North: The first thing to
understand is JavaScript uses prototypes

2
00:00:04.702 --> 00:00:06.030
for inheritance.

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.352
It is more flexible than
classical inheritance,

4
00:00:11.352 --> 00:00:16.936
right, prototypal inheritance
is more flexible.

5
00:00:16.936 --> 00:00:22.648
And you just need to know that there are
still prototypes involved under the hood.

6
00:00:22.648 --> 00:00:29.690
Now there are fewer sharp edges for
us to get snagged on, right.

7
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.870
Fewer things that we can do as
developers that will hurt us and

8
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:42.660
make us painfully aware of these
prototypes not being classes.

9
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.920
But just know that that's still
happening under the hood.

10
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.360
So if we did something like this,

11
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.390
we would be able to logout something
that looks like this on the right.

12
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.820
And this is a lot better than what we get
when we define types of objects you may

13
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.620
get like square bracket object object or
something like that.

14
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.430
So at least here we get to know
the type of this object and

15
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.280
all of the properties that are on it.

16
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.910
The constructor function is,

17
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.420
that is what is used to create
a new instance of that object.
