00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.509
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So we can define methods
in the similar way that we do on objects.

2
00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.301
Note that there are no commas in between
the different methods, you don't have

3
00:00:07.301 --> 00:00:11.222
commas when you're defining a class as you
do in your defining an object literal.

4
00:00:11.222 --> 00:00:16.662
And there is recently, recently was
added a static keyword if you're using

5
00:00:16.662 --> 00:00:22.442
like the latest babble transforms and
things, this should be available to you.

6
00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:26.760
Where you can create essentially
a function that is attached right to

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.886
the constructor,
right to the class itself, and

8
00:00:29.886 --> 00:00:32.725
does not require any
instance to be created.

9
00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:38.467
So note that we were creating a stranger,
and for some reason here,

10
00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:43.116
we've got a random number
that is gonna be generated.

11
00:00:43.116 --> 00:00:49.353
Let's see, person.createRandom, yep, so
the person's name is a random number.

12
00:00:49.353 --> 00:00:53.080
We pass that in, and
what we've done here is we've created,

13
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.243
think of it like an alternate constructor,
right.

14
00:00:56.243 --> 00:01:00.610
Just like we can, our first instance
has to be created by something that's

15
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.299
available on the class in order
to give us this first instance.

16
00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.239
We can create static functions to act as
sort of alternate constructors to use in

17
00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:14.182
various scenarios, particularly when
we have some type safety around these,

18
00:01:14.182 --> 00:01:16.560
it becomes even more useful, right?
