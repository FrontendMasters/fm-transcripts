&gt;&gt; Mike North: So finally, before we
begin the next exercise there's this

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.662
one last clue that's gonna help you out.

3
00:00:05.662 --> 00:00:08.674
We can create a type alias, particularly
when you're working with tuples.

4
00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:13.635
It's tough to look at a tuple and
kind of keep all of these straight, right.

5
00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:16.115
You might have three or four or

6
00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:20.880
five things that all look
like three numbers together.

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.530
Like this could be a color rgb or it could
be xyz coordinates or something like that.

8
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.490
We can give it a name using a type,
the type keyword.

9
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.078
So here we're saying,
I'm gonna use this word color and

10
00:00:34.078 --> 00:00:39.189
what I really mean is a tuple of size
three containing number, number, number.

11
00:00:41.737 --> 00:00:45.033
&gt;&gt; Mike North: You can export this and
import it from another class, or

12
00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:48.610
use it in another interface,
whatever you wanna do.

13
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.120
This color now, it is usable anywhere,
other types are usable.

14
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.670
Just like in interface, just like these
type literals we've been creating.

15
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.863
So, feel free to go about using that.
