00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.607
So now that we've practiced that,
what I want you to do now is go ahead and

2
00:00:03.607 --> 00:00:04.565
do the same thing.

3
00:00:04.565 --> 00:00:10.874
I want you to autofocus any field you want
on the NewDishForm that we have here.

4
00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:18.362
So what I'm doing right here is just,
I sort of went ahead and

5
00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:20.321
did a little bit of a migration
over to script setups.

6
00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:22.220
And you'll have seen me
do that a few times, so

7
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.622
I figured no need to walk you
all through that whole thing.

8
00:00:24.622 --> 00:00:27.633
So basically we have here the new-dish
form, did you all do okay as far

9
00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:30.051
as getting everything autofocus
the way you want it to?

10
00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:31.598
Great, this is good.

11
00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.744
So let's run through this then.

12
00:00:33.744 --> 00:00:35.913
So once again, just like we talked about,

13
00:00:35.913 --> 00:00:39.547
the first thing we wanna do is decide
which element will be referenced.

14
00:00:39.547 --> 00:00:42.815
So in this case I'll just pick this one,
so again,

15
00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:47.460
element, I'll call it DishNameInput,
just to be a bit more specific.

16
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.340
And then we define our ref,
so const elDishNameInput,

17
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.231
this is a ref that could be
an HTML input element or null.

18
00:00:59.231 --> 00:01:03.227
And it will start out as null because
when the page loads we don't know what

19
00:01:03.227 --> 00:01:03.875
it'll be.

20
00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:09.079
Then onMounted when the page has been
loaded, we will go ahead and say,

21
00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:14.114
hey look, if dishNameInput.value
exists with the question mark,

22
00:01:14.114 --> 00:01:16.832
then we'll go ahead and focus on it.

23
00:01:16.832 --> 00:01:19.794
So just to make sure that
all this works as expected.

24
00:01:19.794 --> 00:01:24.913
If we go over here to Dishes now and New,
there you go Name automatically shows up.
