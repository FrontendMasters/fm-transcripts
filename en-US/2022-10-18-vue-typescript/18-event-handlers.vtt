1
00:00:00.048 --> 00:00:01.519
So the next thing we're gonna do,

2
00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:04.786
is talk about something that is common
in a lot of apps, particularly view.

3
00:00:04.786 --> 00:00:07.496
And so
we're gonna talk about event handlers.

4
00:00:07.496 --> 00:00:12.433
And so, when we talk about event handlers
as a brief recap, if we take a look at,

5
00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:15.560
actually, let's go to
our new restaurant form.

6
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.716
This is probably the best
place to take a look at this.

7
00:00:18.716 --> 00:00:22.722
Is that we have this thing down
here when we're creating, and

8
00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:26.433
you'll notice that we're
inlining this emit, right?

9
00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:30.582
And it says, emit new restaurant,
add new restaurant, pass new restaurant.

10
00:00:30.582 --> 00:00:36.756
But again, one of the problems with this
is that it's buried inside of our code.

11
00:00:36.756 --> 00:00:38.975
And so, let's go on first
off by refactoring this, so

12
00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:41.164
we can talk more about what
we're gonna do with this.

13
00:00:41.164 --> 00:00:45.251
So personally, I tried to avoid
inlining the dollar sign emit inside of

14
00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:49.747
the template whenever possible, just
because oftentimes it's a bit of logic

15
00:00:49.747 --> 00:00:52.419
that you wanna be able
to call multiple times.

16
00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:56.421
So what I would typically do then,
is let's go ahead and

17
00:00:56.421 --> 00:00:58.216
swap this over to setup.

18
00:00:58.216 --> 00:01:04.638
We're gonna delete these two,
then we'll define our emits as such.

19
00:01:04.638 --> 00:01:09.950
And then let's just comment
that out real quick.

20
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.680
We'll cast it.

21
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.283
So the first one is an event
called add-new-restaurant,

22
00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:19.545
where we take a type of restaurant
which should be of type restaurant.

23
00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:23.170
Then basically we have the same thing for
the second one, but

24
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.520
this one it's canceled new restaurant, and
actually it doesn't have a payload at all.

25
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.362
And then we just need to
define what's being returned.

26
00:01:32.362 --> 00:01:35.619
Nothing, so we just add void and
there we go.

27
00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:36.725
Now we have that.

28
00:01:36.725 --> 00:01:41.695
And then before we finish up, let's do
this, const new restaurant is a ref,

29
00:01:41.695 --> 00:01:42.924
that is from view.

30
00:01:42.924 --> 00:01:47.599
Wrap all that, and then what's nice
now is that because restaurant

31
00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:52.697
status list has been imported,
I don't need to declare it a second time.

32
00:01:52.697 --> 00:01:57.284
So this is how this ends up shaking
out once we've migrated it.

33
00:01:57.284 --> 00:02:04.917
Okay, so let me go ahead and start by just
committing this to the exercise branch.

34
00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:08.661
So you can see the progression,

35
00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:13.660
factor move new rest form to script setup.

36
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.650
Great, all right.

37
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.579
So what we'll notice here now,
is we have this emit here happening,

38
00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.800
but I actually just probably wanna
just call an addRestaurant function.

39
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.439
I think inlining it this way is
the cleanest way to just be like, okay,

40
00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.107
there's gonna be a function
that's run on click.

41
00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.467
No one has to worry about like, wait,
what's the dollar sign, what's emit?

42
00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:34.230
No, there's a function
called addRestaurant.

43
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.120
Okay, then we'll how
are we gonna define that.

44
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.964
Well, let's go ahead and do that.

45
00:02:37.964 --> 00:02:39.131
So actually I'm gonna add this below.

46
00:02:39.131 --> 00:02:42.274
So const addRestaurant is a function, and

47
00:02:42.274 --> 00:02:46.911
that function when clicked upon will emit,
what will it emit?

48
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:50.616
Well, we don't have our emits defined, so

49
00:02:50.616 --> 00:02:55.835
we just need to declare it here,
and then we can say emit what?

50
00:02:55.835 --> 00:03:00.291
Let's see, emit, CTRL + Space,
add-new-restaurant, yes,

51
00:03:00.291 --> 00:03:01.708
that's what I want.

52
00:03:01.708 --> 00:03:05.868
I gotta love autocomplete cuz I just
reduced the number of typos I have, and

53
00:03:05.868 --> 00:03:07.596
then newRestaurant.value.

54
00:03:07.596 --> 00:03:10.261
I think that should do it.

55
00:03:10.261 --> 00:03:11.750
Except, whoa, interesting.

56
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.160
Look, it's yelling at us.

57
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.508
Why, because it's saying, wait,
what is this object you're passing me?

58
00:03:17.508 --> 00:03:19.205
It's not really a restaurant.

59
00:03:19.205 --> 00:03:21.123
Well, we can fix that.

60
00:03:21.123 --> 00:03:24.370
We just pass it here and define it there.

61
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.930
And voila,

62
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.738
now you have everything very consistently
typed as we've been learning so far.

63
00:03:28.738 --> 00:03:32.628
And so, now, if we go ahead and
go inside of our app.

64
00:03:32.628 --> 00:03:33.822
Let's go the other way.

65
00:03:33.822 --> 00:03:40.373
So inside of New, and then we'll be like
Benget and the Jets, test.com, Create.

66
00:03:40.373 --> 00:03:47.638
For some reasons the title disappeared,
but we'll figure that out in a second.

67
00:03:47.638 --> 00:03:50.041
I think I know why.

68
00:03:50.041 --> 00:03:51.899
I think I do know why.

69
00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:55.834
Okay, so clearly something is being added,
because, okay, so

70
00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:58.992
actually let me explain
this part because I forgot.

71
00:03:58.992 --> 00:04:03.529
When we emit the restaurant, what's
happening is that the parent component

72
00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:08.133
that it lives on, which is currently
parent page, you'll notice that when we

73
00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:13.063
scroll down, The new restaurant form here,

74
00:04:13.063 --> 00:04:17.734
this is where we're actually calling,
basically we're listening for the event.

75
00:04:17.734 --> 00:04:22.010
So, I'll just multi-line this just to
make this a little bit easier to read.

76
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.511
But it's basically when you
declare a custom event in view,

77
00:04:24.511 --> 00:04:25.590
like add new restaurant,

78
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.844
it's basically saying we can listen to
this thing called add new restaurant.

79
00:04:28.844 --> 00:04:31.123
When this event is triggered,

80
00:04:31.123 --> 00:04:35.515
run this function basically
within the parent component.

81
00:04:35.515 --> 00:04:40.024
So this addRestaurant here is
being triggered right here.

82
00:04:40.024 --> 00:04:43.572
And so, this is where again now
our work that we were doing before

83
00:04:43.572 --> 00:04:45.354
starts coming together, why?

84
00:04:45.354 --> 00:04:48.249
We know that the payload is
supposed to be restaurant, and

85
00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:50.446
that's what's being defined at the emit.

86
00:04:50.446 --> 00:04:51.752
So we have consistency here.

87
00:04:51.752 --> 00:04:55.028
And then we know that, okay,
restaurant.list.value.push, great,

88
00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:55.756
hideForm().

89
00:04:55.756 --> 00:04:59.216
This is starting to come
together really nicely.

90
00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:05.029
Okay, so that looks good, but
we have a slight problem.

91
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:06.912
So let me first start by,

92
00:05:06.912 --> 00:05:12.764
let's refactor this one real quick to
cancel restaurant, new restaurant.

93
00:05:12.764 --> 00:05:18.659
And then now that we have that,
we'll just copy this real quick and

94
00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:23.940
then we'll just say,
cancelNewRestaurant, emit what?

95
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.820
CTRL+ Space, wait, that's the wrong one.

96
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.124
&gt;&gt; Trying to be smart because you
have the second argument, maybe?

97
00:05:30.124 --> 00:05:32.570
&gt;&gt; I think you're actually right.

98
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.428
Yep, so what was mentioned in the class
here, is that currently it knows that

99
00:05:37.428 --> 00:05:42.760
cancel new restaurant does not have
a parameter, but add-new-restaurant does.

100
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.859
So if we strip this out,
we should see, there it is.

101
00:05:46.859 --> 00:05:50.739
Being a little bit too smart,
in [LAUGH] my opinion.

102
00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:53.200
But that was very nice.

103
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.500
Okay, so now we have this.

104
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.879
Now everything's refactored correctly.

105
00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.136
We're good,
I'm gonna do see a red squiggly line, but

106
00:05:59.136 --> 00:06:00.539
we'll deal with that in a second.

107
00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:01.992
Okay, so let's finish up that refactor.
