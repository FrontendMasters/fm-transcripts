1
00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.413
This is kind of a culmination of a lot
of things that we've been doing.

2
00:00:02.413 --> 00:00:05.993
So I know that it's been a long day, but I
figured a bit of a challenge might be fun

3
00:00:05.993 --> 00:00:09.488
to get people trying out something where
there's not a base waiting for you.

4
00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:12.389
So what I've gone ahead and
done is, I've gone ahead and

5
00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.661
duplicated the new dishForm and
just made it the editdishForm.

6
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:19.524
And so for the sake of demoing it,
we could do the routes and everything.

7
00:00:19.524 --> 00:00:22.293
But for the sake of time,
I just kind of wanna show how it works.

8
00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:26.023
So to make sure everything works, so let's
go ahead and make sure that, let's see.

9
00:00:26.023 --> 00:00:28.779
We're gonna go inside of the dish page.

10
00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.957
And so this time we're gonna
actually change show new form.

11
00:00:33.957 --> 00:00:37.347
Show new form actually is no longer
correct as far as what it is.

12
00:00:37.347 --> 00:00:41.599
Really what show new form should
be is a series of values.

13
00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:43.736
And so for now we're just gonna
leave it as a string though.

14
00:00:43.736 --> 00:00:46.598
But basically it should either be new,
or it should be empty, or

15
00:00:46.598 --> 00:00:47.555
it should be edited.

16
00:00:47.555 --> 00:00:48.541
That's kind of what I'm thinking.

17
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:51.130
So actually what we can do though,
we're here to type stuff out.

18
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.109
So let's go ahead and do a show.

19
00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.331
We'll call it a ShowState.

20
00:00:55.331 --> 00:00:57.182
ShowFormState.

21
00:00:57.182 --> 00:01:00.086
And this will be,
basically we'll have it empty.

22
00:01:00.086 --> 00:01:02.976
It can be new, or it can be edit.

23
00:01:02.976 --> 00:01:06.754
And so
then we'll type that to ShowFormState.

24
00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:09.520
And then by default,
it will be an empty string.

25
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.323
So this is good.

26
00:01:10.323 --> 00:01:14.040
We have some things to break though,
so let's go ahead and do some things.

27
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.053
So hideForm,
basically when we ever we hide the form,

28
00:01:17.053 --> 00:01:20.928
we want to go back to empty string,
we don't need it to show anything.

29
00:01:20.928 --> 00:01:22.576
So that's taken care of.

30
00:01:22.576 --> 00:01:26.871
And then here, now if the new query is
showing, we don't want it to be true,

31
00:01:26.871 --> 00:01:29.639
right, this is where
TideStrip's helping us.

32
00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:30.714
It's saying, what do we need it to be?

33
00:01:30.714 --> 00:01:32.485
We need it to be new.

34
00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:38.159
And then now that I actually know this,
I'm just gonna jump the gun too and say

35
00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.033
that if we get an edit query on it, then
showNewForm.value is going to be edit.

36
00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:45.617
And so now that I think about it,

37
00:01:45.617 --> 00:01:48.160
showNewForm as a whole is
actually the wrong name.

38
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.576
So we're gonna rename all
showNewForm to just showForm.

39
00:01:51.576 --> 00:01:53.792
And so
I just did that with the multiselect.

40
00:01:53.792 --> 00:01:55.514
And so now that we have that, let's see.

41
00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:59.283
So we'll go through showForm, okay.

42
00:01:59.283 --> 00:02:04.489
So when we click on this, we are going to,
showForm is going to be equal to new.

43
00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:09.077
That's what we're going to do that will
let us actually toggle the new form.

44
00:02:09.077 --> 00:02:10.713
And then we'll scroll down.

45
00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:13.259
Okay, so we have here, filter item.

46
00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.182
Okay, so now this is a little
bit tricky because after all,

47
00:02:17.182 --> 00:02:22.533
our editForm doesn't actually show up
in this, it actually lives in dishCard.

48
00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:26.093
So now we gotta dive into dishCard and
we gotta think, okay, well,

49
00:02:26.093 --> 00:02:29.287
what we need to do is,
we need to actually emit an edit event.

50
00:02:29.287 --> 00:02:30.703
That's what we really need to do.

51
00:02:30.703 --> 00:02:32.474
So let's go ahead and
define that, shall we?

52
00:02:32.474 --> 00:02:34.962
So we have another event
that we're gonna emit.

53
00:02:34.962 --> 00:02:38.315
And this will be a update or edit-dish.

54
00:02:38.315 --> 00:02:39.531
Let's just call it what it is.

55
00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:42.089
And it's not alphabetical, so
I'll swap that real quick.

56
00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:44.648
And then we'll patch up
the dish that we want to edit.

57
00:02:44.648 --> 00:02:46.371
That's basically what we'll do.

58
00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:49.778
So then with that, we know that happens.

59
00:02:49.778 --> 00:02:53.496
So now we can go ahead and say,
let's see, I'm gonna go ahead and

60
00:02:53.496 --> 00:02:55.192
similarly construct a dish.

61
00:02:55.192 --> 00:02:56.872
We'll create a new function.

62
00:02:56.872 --> 00:03:01.200
And then this will emit what
we'll see the C + Cmd + Space or

63
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.495
control space, edit-dish,
perfect props.dish, that looks good.

64
00:03:06.495 --> 00:03:10.278
And now we have our Edit button here,
so let's go ahead and add the click.

65
00:03:10.278 --> 00:03:12.991
And when we click it,
we're gonna run edit-dish, and

66
00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:14.852
that is actually everything we need.

67
00:03:14.852 --> 00:03:18.147
So once we have that,
we can jump back up to the page.

68
00:03:18.147 --> 00:03:20.703
And the page now will actually be
able to listen for this event.

69
00:03:20.703 --> 00:03:22.689
So we have the edit-dish.

70
00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:28.307
And so what we can do here is, we're gonna
do, let's just name edit-dish again,

71
00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:32.266
and maybe edit-dishForm,
that is a little bit cleaner.

72
00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:39.292
So then here now we can do [SOUND] beneath
here makes the most sense, edit-dishForm.

73
00:03:39.292 --> 00:03:41.923
And we have a payload,
which is of type Dish.

74
00:03:41.923 --> 00:03:47.197
And so now what we're gonna
do though is we're gonna say,

75
00:03:47.197 --> 00:03:50.653
showForm.value is going to be edit.

76
00:03:50.653 --> 00:03:55.139
And the reason this is valuable is
because we need now to actually toggle

77
00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.816
that component that we just
grabbed the edit-dishForm.

78
00:03:58.816 --> 00:04:02.357
So again,
there's gonna be some repetition in here.

79
00:04:02.357 --> 00:04:07.223
And I know that that's always a little
bit tricky to manage sometimes,

80
00:04:07.223 --> 00:04:12.423
especially if, see, we're used to the,
do not repeat yourself context.

81
00:04:12.423 --> 00:04:17.003
But it is helpful sometimes just
to focus on getting something

82
00:04:17.003 --> 00:04:21.239
out the door first rather than
sort of optimizing for it.

83
00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.566
So this is v-else-if.

84
00:04:23.566 --> 00:04:25.862
So you can see here now
I've updated the logic so

85
00:04:25.862 --> 00:04:28.743
that basically if showForm is new,
show the new dishForm.

86
00:04:28.743 --> 00:04:32.722
Otherwise if the showForm is edit,
show the EditDishForm, and

87
00:04:32.722 --> 00:04:35.161
then otherwise we will show the thing.

88
00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:38.115
And so the key thing here though is,

89
00:04:38.115 --> 00:04:43.250
we're gonna need to actually
pass this into this component.

90
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.846
So to make sure this works,
silly me, this is wrong.

91
00:04:47.846 --> 00:04:52.314
This need at least,
I'll just strict equal that.

92
00:04:52.314 --> 00:04:57.034
Okay, so to prove that this works,
I'm gonna go ahead and just say, edit Name

93
00:04:57.034 --> 00:05:01.841
right here, and then we'll go ahead and
check to make sure everything worked.

94
00:05:01.841 --> 00:05:04.821
So where's my app?

95
00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:05.892
I think it closed it.

96
00:05:05.892 --> 00:05:08.952
Okay, let me pump this up.

97
00:05:08.952 --> 00:05:10.590
Okay, we have our dishes.

98
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.123
Whoop, missing semicolon, dishes page.

99
00:05:14.123 --> 00:05:15.570
Let's find out.

100
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.957
Dishes page.

101
00:05:17.957 --> 00:05:20.218
I guess that was an error
that we saw earlier.

102
00:05:20.218 --> 00:05:24.838
Else, silly me, else if,
there we go, that's good now.

103
00:05:24.838 --> 00:05:26.403
All right, so now there we go.

104
00:05:26.403 --> 00:05:30.369
All right, so we have the restaurants,
we have the dishes, and

105
00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:31.845
now if we click on Edit.

106
00:05:31.845 --> 00:05:35.706
Okay, so Edit Name is appearing,
we have the right component coming in.

107
00:05:35.706 --> 00:05:38.731
So now what we need to do is,
we actually need to fetch the ID.

108
00:05:38.731 --> 00:05:39.624
So how are we gonna do that?

109
00:05:39.624 --> 00:05:43.354
Well, what we can do is, we can probably,
just for now, let's see,

110
00:05:43.354 --> 00:05:45.778
how are we checking this
inside of this page?

111
00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:49.560
Currently, we have a showForm dishList.

112
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.997
Okay, so we know for a fact that
editDish is gonna tell us the ID,

113
00:05:52.997 --> 00:05:55.238
that's really what we ultimately need.

114
00:05:55.238 --> 00:06:00.940
So what I'm gonna do is, we're just gonna
create a ref that we're gonna track for

115
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.997
now called edit Dishid, and this is
gonna be a ref that's just a string.

116
00:06:05.997 --> 00:06:11.076
And what we're gonna want to do then i,
s on the point of edit,

117
00:06:11.076 --> 00:06:15.000
we will do editDishid.value = payload.id.

118
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.697
And we know that it happens because we
know that dish itself has an ID property.

119
00:06:18.697 --> 00:06:21.219
So again, once again,
typing to the rest of you for this.

120
00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:25.133
Once we have this, what this tells us is,
inside of editDishForm,

121
00:06:25.133 --> 00:06:28.439
we can have a prop that takes
in that specific ID, right?

122
00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:31.325
So I can say, defineProps.

123
00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:34.505
And then the inside of defineProps,
we'll take a,

124
00:06:34.505 --> 00:06:38.348
I don't wanna call it ID cuz
it'll conflict with a HTML specs.

125
00:06:38.348 --> 00:06:41.038
That's usually a rule I tried to
establish whenever I write anything.

126
00:06:41.038 --> 00:06:45.866
So we'll just call it dishId, and
this will be basically a string.

127
00:06:45.866 --> 00:06:48.094
We don't need to be any
more complicated than that.

128
00:06:48.094 --> 00:06:53.225
So now that we've defined the props here,
we should be able to,

129
00:06:53.225 --> 00:06:57.133
inside of our editDish component,
there we go.

130
00:06:57.133 --> 00:07:03.513
We can then say, dishId is going to be
equal to editDishId, just like that.

131
00:07:03.513 --> 00:07:07.332
And then I've realized it's not always
gonna be true, we won't always have one.

132
00:07:07.332 --> 00:07:11.124
So inside of our editDish,
we're gonna just make it optional so

133
00:07:11.124 --> 00:07:12.819
that it doesn't yell at us.

134
00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:14.376
Okay, that should do the trick.

135
00:07:14.376 --> 00:07:17.544
And then to make sure this works,
we'll go ahead and

136
00:07:17.544 --> 00:07:21.297
render out the edit or dishId,
I think it's what I called it?

137
00:07:21.297 --> 00:07:23.073
Yeah, dishId is what I called it.

138
00:07:23.073 --> 00:07:24.854
Okay, let's see if this works at all.

139
00:07:24.854 --> 00:07:30.403
So if I click Edit,
Refresh, Edit, there we go.

140
00:07:30.403 --> 00:07:31.698
There's our ID.

141
00:07:31.698 --> 00:07:38.207
If we go back, I didn't turn away
to cancel it, that's totally fine.

142
00:07:38.207 --> 00:07:40.677
Okay, so now that we have our ID,
what do we need to do?

143
00:07:40.677 --> 00:07:43.734
Okay, we need to actually get
the thing from the store.

144
00:07:43.734 --> 00:07:48.228
And the way we're gonna do that is, inside
of stores, something you might not be

145
00:07:48.228 --> 00:07:51.678
aware of is that,
getters can actually receive an argument.

146
00:07:51.678 --> 00:07:56.638
So we can basically pass in an argument
to get to basically do a little bit of

147
00:07:56.638 --> 00:07:57.445
fetching.

148
00:07:57.445 --> 00:08:03.575
So in this case it will be, getDishById.

149
00:08:03.575 --> 00:08:08.382
And so we know that we get
the state by default, right,

150
00:08:08.382 --> 00:08:12.467
from our, woo, that's wrong, there we go.

151
00:08:12.467 --> 00:08:15.731
And then what we're gonna return
though is, we're gonna return a dish,

152
00:08:15.731 --> 00:08:17.532
that's something that's important.

153
00:08:17.532 --> 00:08:21.818
So what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna return

154
00:08:21.818 --> 00:08:27.189
the state.list.filter, and
we're gonna filter what?

155
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:29.689
We're gonna filter every
dish inside of here.

156
00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:33.964
And dish.id should be equal, sorry,

157
00:08:33.964 --> 00:08:38.708
we need a function first
of this new editDishId.

158
00:08:38.708 --> 00:08:41.524
So basically what we're doing is,
inside of the getter,

159
00:08:41.524 --> 00:08:45.551
it's a function returning a function, and
that's why we can pass in a parameter.

160
00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:50.892
So to editDishId,
we'll return this filter D ish, and

161
00:08:50.892 --> 00:08:58.166
this should be enter in like this, and
then that should clean up the errors,

162
00:08:58.166 --> 00:09:02.843
although it's slightly
off at a dish ID string.

163
00:09:02.843 --> 00:09:04.758
Why is it not happy with this?

164
00:09:04.758 --> 00:09:06.086
So this is where an example of,

165
00:09:06.086 --> 00:09:08.642
unfortunate sometimes the errors
aren't as helpful, but

166
00:09:08.642 --> 00:09:12.490
we kinda got ahead of ourselves thinking,
well, we'll get DishById, not quite.

167
00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.063
The thing that's getting the dish
is actually the function, and

168
00:09:15.063 --> 00:09:17.469
all we're actually returning
is the function in this case.

169
00:09:17.469 --> 00:09:19.714
Okay, let's now try this.

170
00:09:19.714 --> 00:09:25.427
So if we go inside of our editDishForm,
we should be able to then say,

171
00:09:25.427 --> 00:09:30.059
const_targetDish is equal to,
I have dish store yet,

172
00:09:30.059 --> 00:09:36.288
I don't have this dish store yet,
const dishStore equals useDishStore.

173
00:09:36.288 --> 00:09:40.671
And then we can say,
dishStore.getDishById, and

174
00:09:40.671 --> 00:09:43.066
then we need the props here.

175
00:09:43.066 --> 00:09:47.446
So we say, props.dishId, and

176
00:09:47.446 --> 00:09:51.345
then we can log targetDish.

177
00:09:51.345 --> 00:09:57.063
But I think it's yelling
at me because it's

178
00:09:57.063 --> 00:10:02.169
saying, hey, it might be undefined.

179
00:10:02.169 --> 00:10:04.179
So I'll just do this.

180
00:10:04.179 --> 00:10:08.056
If props.dishID is true,

181
00:10:08.056 --> 00:10:11.932
then do that, else, yes,

182
00:10:11.932 --> 00:10:16.999
this is gonna be a little bit weird.

183
00:10:16.999 --> 00:10:20.224
This is weird type wise already,
but I wanna see if this works.

184
00:10:20.224 --> 00:10:21.866
So here we go.

185
00:10:21.866 --> 00:10:25.471
So we have our Cancel here,
we have our ghost peppers.

186
00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:28.935
Okay, so we can see here now we've
actually fetched the actual object.

187
00:10:28.935 --> 00:10:33.736
So all we gotta do now here is,
inside of here,

188
00:10:33.736 --> 00:10:38.427
once again,
we have an error to do Fix types.

189
00:10:38.427 --> 00:10:43.065
But once again, we're trying to
get to the finish line here.

190
00:10:43.065 --> 00:10:44.880
So now that we actually have the dish,

191
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.278
what we want to be able to
do is actually update it.

192
00:10:47.278 --> 00:10:52.513
So in this particular case what I
would say is, how do we do this?

193
00:10:52.513 --> 00:10:57.094
So we have Edit Name,
dish name, v-model Dish.name.

194
00:10:57.094 --> 00:11:00.935
Okay, so
what I actually could do instead is,

195
00:11:00.935 --> 00:11:05.867
we can just say the value is newDish.name,
that's fine.

196
00:11:05.867 --> 00:11:10.062
But then on input we will then say,
or on keyup.enter,

197
00:11:10.062 --> 00:11:14.364
just like we did before,
then we'll say, updateDish.

198
00:11:14.364 --> 00:11:18.936
So the way we'll do that
is const updateDish is

199
00:11:18.936 --> 00:11:23.987
going to go ahead and
it's just a normal function.

200
00:11:23.987 --> 00:11:30.724
And then we're gonna say,
targetDish.name equals newDish.value.name.

201
00:11:30.724 --> 00:11:32.449
Can I do that?

202
00:11:32.449 --> 00:11:38.014
Yeah, that's fine, I'll fix the types in
a second, we just wanna see if this works.

203
00:11:38.014 --> 00:11:40.630
Okay, swap it on over.

204
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:44.958
So then we'll say,
Mystery Shrimp, create, wait,

205
00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.731
that one actually, that should trigger it.

206
00:11:48.731 --> 00:11:53.009
So now if I go back to dishes, it broke.

207
00:11:53.009 --> 00:11:58.461
Okay Edit Test, create dishes.

208
00:11:58.461 --> 00:12:01.534
Nope, does not like it.

209
00:12:01.534 --> 00:12:06.396
UpdateDish, I didn't hit enter, silly me.

210
00:12:06.396 --> 00:12:09.589
Okay, that should do it now.

211
00:12:09.589 --> 00:12:12.284
So then we'll refresh.

212
00:12:12.284 --> 00:12:13.781
Add it here, Mystery Shrimp, Enter.

213
00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:19.770
Enter did something, and
then if I go back to Dishes,

214
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:24.707
I wanna go back, I know why, silly me.

215
00:12:24.707 --> 00:12:30.731
So I thought I was in routing,
this requires an actual switch.

216
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:34.367
So similarly,
we need to cancel an editDish basically.

217
00:12:34.367 --> 00:12:37.913
And I realized on the editDishForm for
whatever reason, yeah.

218
00:12:37.913 --> 00:12:40.630
Okay, this is what I need to switch.

219
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:45.418
So going back to the Dishes page,
we'll go back to the dish card.

220
00:12:45.418 --> 00:12:52.402
And so when we cancel, wait, here we here.

221
00:12:52.402 --> 00:12:55.292
Listen to cancelDish, cancel-new-dish.

222
00:12:55.292 --> 00:13:00.800
Then we'll say cancelDish, or cancelEdit.

223
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:06.186
And so now we can do const
cancelEdit equals a function

224
00:13:06.186 --> 00:13:11.463
where we then say
the showForm.value equals that.

225
00:13:11.463 --> 00:13:14.533
So basically we're reverting
it back to the thing.

226
00:13:14.533 --> 00:13:18.455
So to show that it works, we'll go
ahead and edit, we'll click Cancel.

227
00:13:18.455 --> 00:13:23.220
And it did not like it, Cancel cannot

228
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:28.616
admit that I did not get declared, okay?

229
00:13:28.616 --> 00:13:31.445
So this is where view is
trying to help us because I

230
00:13:31.445 --> 00:13:34.285
made up an event without
actually declaring it.

231
00:13:34.285 --> 00:13:38.349
So cancel-edit-dish like this,
that should do it.

232
00:13:38.349 --> 00:13:42.106
Okay, so refresh again, ghost peppers.

233
00:13:42.106 --> 00:13:48.582
Mystery, or I should cancel first,
it does not like it.

234
00:13:48.582 --> 00:13:50.394
What is not picking up?

235
00:13:50.394 --> 00:13:55.875
&gt;&gt; I guess it's cancel-new-dish
on the template.

236
00:13:57.214 --> 00:13:58.939
&gt;&gt; Is that what it's
saying on the template?

237
00:13:58.939 --> 00:14:00.898
Yes, I think you're right.

238
00:14:00.898 --> 00:14:04.885
So just scroll down here,
yeah, wait, nope, wrong thing.

239
00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:09.353
Cancel-edit-dish, typing is fun.

240
00:14:09.353 --> 00:14:10.780
[LAUGH] Let's do this.

241
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.379
I refresh, Edit, Cancel, there we go.

242
00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:14.191
Now we're good.

243
00:14:14.191 --> 00:14:20.801
So now Mystery Shrimp, Enter,
that should update it.

244
00:14:20.801 --> 00:14:23.359
It just overwrite it.

245
00:14:23.359 --> 00:14:26.451
But, okay, but
that's the general gist of it, right?

246
00:14:26.451 --> 00:14:28.284
There's kind of a lot
of moving pieces here.

247
00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:32.127
And so what I will make sure to do is
that, I'll make sure that the end result

248
00:14:32.127 --> 00:14:35.007
is updated cuz there's clearly
a lot of moving pieces.

249
00:14:35.007 --> 00:14:38.486
But at a high level what we did see
is that, you basically need to,

250
00:14:38.486 --> 00:14:41.928
we had to hop into the store,
use getters to grab something out.

251
00:14:41.928 --> 00:14:45.721
And then what's tricky and most likely
what's happening at this point is that,

252
00:14:45.721 --> 00:14:49.532
you basically need to make a copy of the
reference before you go off and modify it.

253
00:14:49.532 --> 00:14:52.126
I was trying to take a shortcut
here to just edit it directly, but

254
00:14:52.126 --> 00:14:54.922
typically what you do want to do is,
you wanna actually mode it like.

255
00:14:54.922 --> 00:14:57.767
Basically when you load it in,
make a copy of it.

256
00:14:57.767 --> 00:15:00.246
That way you have a local state
change within your component of what

257
00:15:00.246 --> 00:15:01.049
you're modifying.

258
00:15:01.049 --> 00:15:04.786
And then when you submit the change, that
will trigger an update event to the store

259
00:15:04.786 --> 00:15:08.052
that will then update the set item,
that's the path you wanna follow.

260
00:15:08.052 --> 00:15:12.426
So once again, that solution will be
published to the 11 finished branch.

261
00:15:12.426 --> 00:15:16.076
But otherwise, this is also a chance for
you to just try and debug this out cuz

262
00:15:16.076 --> 00:15:19.558
this is honestly fairly common scenario
too as far as CRUD operations and

263
00:15:19.558 --> 00:15:21.290
updating forms and existing data.
