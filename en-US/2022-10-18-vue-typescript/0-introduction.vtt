00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.344
Welcome, everyone to Typescript and Vue.

2
00:00:02.344 --> 00:00:05.688
I'm excited to have you all
here today as we dive right in.

3
00:00:05.688 --> 00:00:09.771
So to kick things off,
a little bit about me.

4
00:00:09.771 --> 00:00:13.578
So little fun fact,
I really love going to amusement parks.

5
00:00:13.578 --> 00:00:16.870
And one of the things that's been great
since the things have started calming down

6
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.167
as far as pandemic and stuff is.

7
00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:20.329
We can go back so
I've been to Universal Studios.

8
00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.837
This is not a recent photo,
but if you're looking for

9
00:00:22.837 --> 00:00:24.297
me I'm the guy way in the back.

10
00:00:24.297 --> 00:00:26.505
This is on the Universal Studios Orlando,

11
00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:30.691
the Jurassic Park right where you just
dive 80 feet, it's an absolute blast.

12
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:33.036
So if you ever get a chance
to be sure to check that out.

13
00:00:33.036 --> 00:00:36.373
But the Universal Studio in LA they
redid it with the Jurassic world.

14
00:00:36.373 --> 00:00:40.982
So highly recommend it if you're
in the area, so check that out.

15
00:00:40.982 --> 00:00:43.634
But a fun facts aside,
a little bit about me, for

16
00:00:43.634 --> 00:00:45.910
those who aren't familiar with my work.

17
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.992
I'm a senior staff developer
experience engineer at Netlify,

18
00:00:48.992 --> 00:00:52.082
I'm on the Vue Core team which
where some of you may know me from.

19
00:00:52.082 --> 00:00:54.967
So we'll do a lot of stuff in open
source as well as the Nuxt Ambassador.

20
00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:57.653
So if you're not aware there's also
the Nuxt free workshop coming up in

21
00:00:57.653 --> 00:00:58.335
a couple of days.

22
00:00:58.335 --> 00:01:00.960
So if you wanna learn about that be
sure to join us for that as well.

23
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.100
I'll have to teach on Vue Mastery, and
I'm also a Google Developer expert.

24
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.690
It sounds like everyone they're excited
to learn about the thing that I designed

25
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.226
the workshop for, [LAUGH] which is getting
you up and running with Typescript and

26
00:01:14.226 --> 00:01:16.840
vue, because it's been kind
of a tricky journey for vue.

27
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.030
We'll talk a little bit about that.

28
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.610
But today we'll go through the ins and
outs and hopefully, yeah, get a lot done.

29
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.221
All right, so
as far as the workshop format for today.

30
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:29.919
So, basically, when I teach workshops,

31
00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:32.332
I follow these sort of three
principles as far as the recipe.

32
00:01:32.332 --> 00:01:35.730
Which is we start by learning the concept,
we question, basically,

33
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.073
figuring out what things really are so
you all can ask questions, and

34
00:01:39.073 --> 00:01:41.793
then we get to apply it, and
I think this is the key step.

35
00:01:41.793 --> 00:01:45.349
So just to kind of give some more
examples, when we're learning I'm gonna be

36
00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:48.358
giving some explanations examples
of how things actually work,

37
00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:50.200
as you can see that live.

38
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.059
Then of course if anyone has any
questions about what I just demoed or

39
00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:56.031
just needs to dive in a little bit deeper,
this is where we can do that.

40
00:01:56.031 --> 00:01:58.298
And then as always with the workshops,

41
00:01:58.298 --> 00:02:01.744
you get a chance to actually
get a hands on experience that.

42
00:02:01.744 --> 00:02:04.678
Cuz after all, how many of us have
read books, watch video courses and

43
00:02:04.678 --> 00:02:08.091
then when it comes to actually applying
it, it's an entirely separate matter?

44
00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:10.606
So this entire course as
we go through things,

45
00:02:10.606 --> 00:02:13.638
you'll get lots of chances to
be hands on with the code.

46
00:02:13.638 --> 00:02:15.379
So as much as humanly possible,

47
00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.348
please try to actually do
the exercises along with us.

48
00:02:18.348 --> 00:02:21.523
We will be doing solutions, so don't worry
if you're feeling a little bit lost, but

49
00:02:21.523 --> 00:02:23.166
yeah that'll be a key
part of the workshop.

50
00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:27.077
And finally as a reminder before we get
started is that, all code is compromised.

51
00:02:27.077 --> 00:02:29.893
So a lot of things I'll be telling you
about are basically just things that I've

52
00:02:29.893 --> 00:02:32.585
observed, they're not necessary best
practices in terms of this is how you

53
00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:33.527
should always do things.

54
00:02:33.527 --> 00:02:37.121
And so I encourage you to, whether it's
question or disagree with the things I'm

55
00:02:37.121 --> 00:02:40.054
saying, because after all your opinion and
experience matters.

56
00:02:40.054 --> 00:02:42.952
And at the end of the day, you and your
team are the one maintaining your code

57
00:02:42.952 --> 00:02:45.440
base, and it's important to respect
that at the end of the day.
