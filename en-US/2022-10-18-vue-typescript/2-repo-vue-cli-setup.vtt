WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.188
Okay, so if you got an access to the repo,
you should see here there are some basic

2
00:00:03.188 --> 00:00:05.525
prerequisites that I wanna make
sure you have in your environment.

3
00:00:05.525 --> 00:00:09.816
Basically, you should have Git,
the latest version of Node and

4
00:00:09.816 --> 00:00:12.360
most importantly, if using VS Code,

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.777
the two VS Code extensions you wanna use
are Volar and the TypeScript plugin Vue.

6
00:00:17.777 --> 00:00:20.582
So this is the Volar extension,
and then the other one here,

7
00:00:20.582 --> 00:00:24.268
technically could be optional, but I just
wanna make sure people install it and

8
00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:27.450
enable it just to make sure
everything's working correctly.

9
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.445
This is how you'll get a lot of your
autocomplete, error checking and

10
00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:31.480
all that stuff.

11
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.400
So these are really critical.

12
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.170
Without these it'll kind of be tricky.

13
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.463
In addition,
if you haven't downloaded already,

14
00:00:38.463 --> 00:00:41.412
the Vue dev tools that can be
a useful tool for you as well

15
00:00:41.412 --> 00:00:45.710
as when you're working with the
application that we'll be building today.

16
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.820
So you can find that basically
under the Chrome extension store.

17
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.847
As far as starting a new project with
Vue and TypeScript, most of us, for

18
00:00:52.847 --> 00:00:56.390
who have done view before
are familiar with the Vue CLI.

19
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.153
And basically the CLI tool to help us
discuss our projects together, but

20
00:01:00.153 --> 00:01:03.728
the important thing that I wanted to
highlight is that Vue CLI is now in

21
00:01:03.728 --> 00:01:05.230
maintenance mode.

22
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.539
Because it was using Webpack and for
those that don't know Vue js is kind of

23
00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:14.405
the new next generation build tool that
a lot of ecosystems are buying into.

24
00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:17.646
And so this is one of the reasons Vue CLI
is being deprecated is because we're

25
00:01:17.646 --> 00:01:20.786
moving basically, revamping
the architecture that powered Vue CLI with

26
00:01:20.786 --> 00:01:24.405
Vite so that you can get all
the latest and greatest with that.

27
00:01:24.405 --> 00:01:28.921
And so when you're starting a new project,
you'll see that inside of Vite there is

28
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:33.175
definitely a way for you to just use the
CLI here to just create a Vite project and

29
00:01:33.175 --> 00:01:37.910
then just scaffold it with Vue and
TypeScript and it does everything for you.

30
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.706
But in case you didn't know, we actually
have another CLI that's basically

31
00:01:42.706 --> 00:01:46.710
going to be the successor to the Vue CLI,
and that is Create Vue.

32
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.790
So Create Vue basically works as you would
expect, where you initialize a new Vue

33
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.150
project it'll go through,
ask you to start up a couple of things,

34
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.110
as you can see it'll ask you whether or
not you want TypeScript, JSX support,

35
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.880
whether you want Vue Router,
Pinia all those things.

36
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.632
And so the project we'll be working on
today is based on a scaffold that is built

37
00:02:05.632 --> 00:02:07.755
with the Create Vue CLI.

38
00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:09.047
So just know,
if you ever starting a new one,

39
00:02:09.047 --> 00:02:10.886
this is kind of where it's recommended for
you to keep an eye on.

40
00:02:13.658 --> 00:02:16.555
All right, so let's go ahead and
open up the project.

41
00:02:16.555 --> 00:02:18.461
So if you go ahead and clone the repo,

42
00:02:18.461 --> 00:02:22.055
this is basically what you
should be seeing inside of here.

43
00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:25.597
You'll see that there's the basic readme
in here where we'll go and update when we

44
00:02:25.597 --> 00:02:29.020
have bookmarks for the different
branches as we go to the workshop.

45
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.738
But then the main thing here is
what we have inside of the app and

46
00:02:31.738 --> 00:02:34.510
that's what we'll be working with today.

47
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.180
As you can see here, this is
basically your standard vue project.

48
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.514
And in fact, most of the client frameworks
look like this now where you have your

49
00:02:42.514 --> 00:02:46.071
source directory with comes with
all your assets, components,

50
00:02:46.071 --> 00:02:50.030
you'll see that I already have
Vue Router and Pinia installed already.

51
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.930
So that's why you see the router folder
and the source as well as the views which

52
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.075
represent the different pages
that we'll be moving towards.

53
00:02:57.075 --> 00:03:01.061
Otherwise a couple things that you might
notice that's a little bit different is

54
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:04.970
that you'll notice that all the files
in here already labeled TypeScript.

55
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.285
And so one of my recommendations when
starting a new project, even if you're not

56
00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:12.130
intending on using TypeScript, is to
just set it up with TypeScript anyways.

57
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.585
And the reason I recommend that is
because this is just one less thing you

58
00:03:15.585 --> 00:03:19.615
have to worry about later on, because
there's a magical configuration that I've

59
00:03:19.615 --> 00:03:23.069
already set up in here, which is that
inside of your compiler options,

60
00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.928
if you set it to allow JS true, it'll
basically allow you to write JavaScript as

61
00:03:26.928 --> 00:03:30.110
you would even inside of so
called TypeScript files.

62
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.716
So you'll see inside of here
if we look at the constants.

63
00:03:32.716 --> 00:03:35.802
This is the constants file,
it is technically a TypeScript file, but

64
00:03:35.802 --> 00:03:38.122
if you see everything in
here standard JavaScript.

65
00:03:38.122 --> 00:03:41.695
And that's what I recommend on most Vue
projects because after all at the end of

66
00:03:41.695 --> 00:03:45.377
the day we wanna teach people how to
progressively migrate towards TypeScript,

67
00:03:45.377 --> 00:03:47.454
and this is the best
balance between the two.

68
00:03:47.454 --> 00:03:50.760
Because anyone who's done tried to do
a migration before is a lot to get

69
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.744
the compiler working with all
the build tools and everything.

70
00:03:53.744 --> 00:03:57.557
So that's why I say getting started, just
go ahead and opt into it, you can opt out

71
00:03:57.557 --> 00:04:00.928
with the tsconfig and then you can slowly
kind of sprinkle it in as we go and

72
00:04:00.928 --> 00:04:03.886
that's exactly what we'll be
doing inside of this workshop.

73
00:04:03.886 --> 00:04:07.809
Let's run through the project as far
as what we'll be working with today.

74
00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:11.270
So let me go ahead and
open this up and then refresh.

75
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.053
All right.

76
00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:17.880
So the project we'll be working
on today is called ToEat.

77
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.947
And so it's kind of a play on the to
do MVC, where instead of tracking all

78
00:04:20.947 --> 00:04:24.920
the things you wanna do, this is the track
all the things that you want to eat.

79
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.470
And so there's, this is a standard
homepage here with a little bit of a hero.

80
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.420
And then you can go through, we see all
the restaurants that we wanna try and

81
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.243
then you'll see some basic
properties that we have,

82
00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:39.630
we'll be able to create
a new restaurant if we want.

83
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.052
And then we'll also be able to like so
we can filter here for example.

84
00:04:43.052 --> 00:04:46.550
And then there are dishes that we wanna
track as far as like maybe something we

85
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.846
wanna cook or maybe you wanna track
specific dishes with restaurants.

86
00:04:49.846 --> 00:04:52.781
We have a lot of opportunity for
playing creativity here.

87
00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:56.178
And so that's something I wanna really
encourage when it comes to working on

88
00:04:56.178 --> 00:04:59.679
exercises today, is that I'll give you
some basic guidance on the things rule

89
00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:01.960
like main objectives that
you wanna accomplish but

90
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.292
the key thing here is to make
sure that you go ahead and

91
00:05:04.292 --> 00:05:07.510
have fun with this because that's
where a lot of the learning happens.

92
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.013
And so if you find ways to like play
around, create custom types or whatnot,

93
00:05:11.013 --> 00:05:12.480
I encourage you to do that.

94
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.086
In the meantime before we move on,
let me go ahead and

95
00:05:15.086 --> 00:05:18.240
actually show you one more
extension that I highly recommend.

96
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.180
And that is Text Pastry.

97
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.479
So if you haven't heard of this
one before, or yep, Text Pastry.

98
00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:30.722
It's a really nifty plugin because one of
the things I found when I'm working with,

99
00:05:30.722 --> 00:05:33.194
playing around with data
is you want a custom ID.

100
00:05:33.194 --> 00:05:37.830
And so normally we just randomly generate
like, we just put 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

101
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.690
But here, for example, we say like const,
again, let's do a todo list real quick.

102
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.774
What we can do really easily is,
let's say, go ahead and

103
00:05:46.774 --> 00:05:49.421
just duplicate this a couple times.

104
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:51.218
[SOUND] Okay, here we go.

105
00:05:51.218 --> 00:05:52.630
We have three items, right?

106
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.008
So what I can do is if I put my cursor 1,
2, 3 and I type id,

107
00:05:58.008 --> 00:06:04.270
I can use Text Pastry to actually
where's it, insert a custom uuid.

108
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.004
And so that's like a nice little way for
you to basically create some scaffold data

109
00:06:09.004 --> 00:06:13.120
with an actual uuid rather than
accidentally creating a fake id that's

110
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.506
trapped in your Vue key later,
that screws up animation.

111
00:06:16.506 --> 00:06:20.385
Text Pastry is really cool, it does
some other cool things as well actually,

112
00:06:20.385 --> 00:06:24.382
just let me show you one other thing, is
that if you ever need to track anything so

113
00:06:24.382 --> 00:06:25.655
like a multiline thing.

114
00:06:25.655 --> 00:06:28.387
So all you got to do is you
can select multiple lines and

115
00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:31.561
then Text Pastry can actually
do counts from like zero to one.

116
00:06:31.561 --> 00:06:33.718
And so little things like that ABC.

117
00:06:33.718 --> 00:06:37.230
So little hidden nugget to
workflow efficiency, but

118
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.610
highly [LAUGH] recommended for
those of you don't have it already.
