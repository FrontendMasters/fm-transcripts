00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.370
We're gonna talk about the 50 reasons
why you should be using TypeScript.

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.120
Reason number one, I'm just kidding.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.553
So I know some of you when we're talking
about TypeScript, a lot of you probably

4
00:00:14.553 --> 00:00:21.020
heard a lot of, well, talks about the many
reasons why TypeScript should be used.

5
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.004
However, for me personally,
I've always found TypeScript to be, well,

6
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:27.033
a little bit, it always felt a little bit
scary to get into because when people

7
00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:30.640
talked about it, they were talking about
all in migrations, that kind of stuff.

8
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.848
So when I designed this workshop,
I really designed it for

9
00:00:32.848 --> 00:00:36.220
people who really have been curious to
use TypeScript with Vue for a long time.

10
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.818
And especially with v2, it was kind of
hard to do that because it felt like

11
00:00:39.818 --> 00:00:41.688
you're doing hacks a lot of the time.

12
00:00:41.688 --> 00:00:44.016
So then people were fighting
with TypeScript and

13
00:00:44.016 --> 00:00:46.125
it ultimately wasn't a great experience.

14
00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:49.192
On the other hand, on the other spectrum
when it comes to who this workshop is for,

15
00:00:49.192 --> 00:00:51.610
we have people who've been
itching to use TypeScript, right?

16
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.771
And so they want to learn the fundamentals
of how they work together.

17
00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:58.901
And everyone else in between this,
this is who the workshop is designed for.

18
00:00:58.901 --> 00:01:02.920
It's to give you all really a flavor
of what Vue with TypeScript is like.

19
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.208
But the key thing to understand though,
is that this is not a workshop that's

20
00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:08.420
designed to make you
an expert in TypeScript.

21
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.782
There are plenty of other wonderful
resources on the FrontEnd Masters workshop

22
00:01:11.782 --> 00:01:12.580
platform.

23
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.888
So if you want to get like a really
deep dive into TypeScript,

24
00:01:14.888 --> 00:01:16.210
be sure to check those out.

25
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.129
But we'll really be focusing
on integrations and

26
00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:19.230
getting people up to speed.

27
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.979
So even if you don't know any TypeScript,
that is totally fine,

28
00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.420
you'll be at home here.

29
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.172
Okay, so once again,
just kind of reiterate,

30
00:01:30.172 --> 00:01:34.060
TypeScript has taken the front
end ecosystem by storm.

31
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.993
But again, from my perspective, a lot of
times when we have these popular tools,

32
00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:39.076
people do that whole,

33
00:01:39.076 --> 00:01:42.370
like when you're holding a hammer,
everything looks like a nail.

34
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.620
So everyone wants to put
TypeScript with everything.

35
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.010
There are issues with that.

36
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.801
And so I remember just listening to
all these talks and thinking, well,

37
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:51.095
something's kind of not right.

38
00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:54.501
Is it really as wonderful as it is given
that people would talk about all these

39
00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:56.273
theoretical benefits they would get?

40
00:01:56.273 --> 00:02:00.304
And then at the end of the day,
they were fighting all these,

41
00:02:00.304 --> 00:02:04.580
whether it's type inferences,
all that fun stuff.

42
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.051
And so
the whole premise of the workshop for

43
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:11.120
me was what if we could just use
TypeScript without going all in on it?

44
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.272
How can we progressively move towards it,

45
00:02:13.272 --> 00:02:17.414
use what works well without feeling like
it's like the gospel for all code bases.

46
00:02:19.908 --> 00:02:23.409
And so the key thing to remember as we go
through the rest of this workshop is that

47
00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.180
your code is not inferior because
you don't use TypeScript.

48
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.680
I feel like sometimes a lot of
times it is spoken in that way.

49
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.350
That if you're not using TypeScript,
somehow you're like behind the curve.

50
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.900
And at the end of the day we have
to remember that TypeScript,

51
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.510
like a lot of other tools in text,
they come with trade offs.

52
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.640
And the key thing is whether or not it's
solving problems for you and your team.

53
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.195
If you and your team have perfect
tests and everything's working and

54
00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:47.192
there's no reason to move to TypeScript,
you shouldn't feel pressure to.

55
00:02:47.192 --> 00:02:49.800
So I think that's just a key thing
to remember as we talk about this.
