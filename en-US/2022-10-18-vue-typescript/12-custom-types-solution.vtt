00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.011
I'm hoping it was basically, couple liners
and then you might have realized that you

2
00:00:04.011 --> 00:00:07.255
had some other work to do but
we'll demo that all together right now.

3
00:00:07.255 --> 00:00:11.545
So, to recap, what I asked you to
do is to take this value in here,

4
00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:13.197
inside of the dietList.

5
00:00:13.197 --> 00:00:15.768
And to make that available
to us as a type.

6
00:00:15.768 --> 00:00:18.353
So, I'm just gonna copy and paste that
just to make my life a little bit easier.

7
00:00:18.353 --> 00:00:20.849
But so, I have a type Diet =, and so,

8
00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.080
we need to use this pipe operator as sort
of the, it's called a union operator.

9
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.091
So even, though I know that in JavaScript
we typically think of it as or,

10
00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:33.239
it's kind of, how I say this.

11
00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.172
It isn't or in this situation, but
when you use this operator with an object,

12
00:00:37.172 --> 00:00:39.688
I will tell you right now
it does not work that way.

13
00:00:39.688 --> 00:00:43.269
So I'm not gonna dive into the why,
there're plenty of types of resources for

14
00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.556
you to get into the nitty and
gritty of this stuff.

15
00:00:45.556 --> 00:00:49.234
But if you think of it as the or for
the basic strings and that kinda stuff,

16
00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:51.603
I think that's the easiest
way to think of it.

17
00:00:51.603 --> 00:00:55.330
Okay, so we the diet here and
I ask to augment both things, right?

18
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.701
So, if you go into diet here and
throw that in here.

19
00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:02.916
And with the diet Diet,
that's fairly straightforward.

20
00:01:02.916 --> 00:01:07.341
But the thing is, is if you happen to
go back to any of your other files,

21
00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:08.776
it is very, very mad.

22
00:01:08.776 --> 00:01:14.557
[LAUGH] And that is because, well,
we don't have a diet for any of these.

23
00:01:14.557 --> 00:01:17.075
And so, here's the thing.

24
00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:19.705
One of the things you could do is
we could certainly go in there and

25
00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:20.543
manually add diet.

26
00:01:20.543 --> 00:01:23.588
And say, okay, let's force
a diet attribute and everything.

27
00:01:23.588 --> 00:01:25.950
But that's not always the most
practical thing to do.

28
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.515
And what you wanna do sometimes
with your types is to say, well,

29
00:01:28.515 --> 00:01:31.568
maybe it doesn't have this property,
maybe this is an optional property.

30
00:01:31.568 --> 00:01:32.429
How would we do that?

31
00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.258
Well, one of the things you might think
of, right, with our new union operators,

32
00:01:36.258 --> 00:01:38.679
well, we can just say,
we could be undefined.

33
00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:41.489
Maybe this is a way to prevent it
from doing that and then we say,

34
00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:43.093
that does that really do anything?

35
00:01:43.093 --> 00:01:47.679
Not particularly, but this is a way that
typically people would do if people cuz

36
00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.629
Tyson was sometime yell at you for
a value, right?

37
00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:55.179
And so sometimes you'll see people try to
define things with the union operator for

38
00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.901
undefined.

39
00:01:55.901 --> 00:01:59.699
But the cleaner way to do this,
if you haven't seen this yet,

40
00:01:59.699 --> 00:02:01.095
is the question mark.

41
00:02:01.095 --> 00:02:04.359
This is gonna be introduced
more into JavaScript syntax of,

42
00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:05.643
does this thing exist?

43
00:02:05.643 --> 00:02:09.293
And so within the TypeScript realm, this
basically says, make this thing optional,

44
00:02:09.293 --> 00:02:10.399
doesn't have to appear.

45
00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.584
And more importantly, it takes care of
that like, if you don't have a diet and

46
00:02:13.584 --> 00:02:15.530
it's undefined,
it's not gonna yell at you.

47
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.888
So it kinda does two things at once.

48
00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:21.991
So once you add that,
now our Restaurant page is much happier.

49
00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:25.479
And if we go to our dish page,
totally fine, it's good.

50
00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.657
But if we decided, okay,
now, this one has a diet,

51
00:02:28.657 --> 00:02:31.351
and I'm gonna call this one Paleo, right?

52
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:35.508
Well, this time is gonna be, well, by the
way, Paleo doesn't exist on this thing.

53
00:02:35.508 --> 00:02:38.610
But you'll also notice
remember that optional thing,

54
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.118
this is also just the proof
is in the pudding.

55
00:02:41.118 --> 00:02:42.933
You'll see that says diet or undefined.

56
00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:45.969
So that question mark does automatically,
basically,

57
00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.380
piece that together for you automatically.

58
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.262
So yeah, if you're ever unsure
you're gonna get a value,

59
00:02:51.262 --> 00:02:53.174
be sure to use that optional operator.
