00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.865
The final exercise per say is really
about trying to put all of this together.

2
00:00:04.865 --> 00:00:07.562
And so
this time now we're gonna have base.

3
00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:10.615
What we're gonna do is,
we're gonna create an edit page,

4
00:00:10.615 --> 00:00:13.668
cuz right now you have the ability
to delete something, but

5
00:00:13.668 --> 00:00:16.555
you don't have the ability
to modify an existing type.

6
00:00:16.555 --> 00:00:20.289
And so
this will kinda stretch some people.

7
00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.571
In this regards, let me actually go
ahead and do some something real quick.

8
00:00:23.571 --> 00:00:27.553
In case anyone asked me about that,

9
00:00:27.553 --> 00:00:34.323
I have an alias inside of my
terminal because I decided that,

10
00:00:34.323 --> 00:00:39.926
git reset ---soft Head-1
was too much type.

11
00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:43.661
So git never mind,
is my way of just saying that,

12
00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:47.087
I don't want the last one,
so get rid of it for me.

13
00:00:47.087 --> 00:00:49.546
So, let me just drop that.

14
00:00:49.546 --> 00:00:54.975
And then check out git
push origin main --force.

15
00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:56.607
Okay, now that should be gone.

16
00:00:56.607 --> 00:00:57.598
All right.

17
00:00:57.598 --> 00:01:00.777
So, we're gonna check out 11-begin.

18
00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:03.983
And so, just to give you just
a little bit of a scaffold.

19
00:01:03.983 --> 00:01:08.002
What we're gonna do checkout 11-exercise,

20
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:11.731
is we're going to go
inside the dishes page.

21
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:13.983
This is where y'all have
been working anyways.

22
00:01:13.983 --> 00:01:16.661
And then actually it went away,
I need to dish card.

23
00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:22.647
And the dish card is going to get
another button called editDish.

24
00:01:22.647 --> 00:01:26.087
So, this will be broken, just so
you know when you get this.

25
00:01:26.087 --> 00:01:30.699
So let's make it a yellow button,
is warning, and then say edit.

26
00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:33.497
And in fact you know what I'll
leave you to hook it up yourself.

27
00:01:33.497 --> 00:01:34.210
And then edit.

28
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.373
There we go.

29
00:01:35.373 --> 00:01:39.013
And so, when you click on this,
what I want you to do is either up to you.

30
00:01:39.013 --> 00:01:41.913
You can create a brand new page,
where router will grab it,

31
00:01:41.913 --> 00:01:44.356
and then you can use your
store to fetch the thing.

32
00:01:44.356 --> 00:01:45.353
Type everything.

33
00:01:45.353 --> 00:01:48.510
Let's see where you can get
to in the next 15 minutes
