1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.536
Before we embark on the final exercise,
what I do wanna go ahead and

2
00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:06.391
show you is the fact that
we've built all this stuff.

3
00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:08.335
And then, so in case anyone
hasn't had the chance to use it,

4
00:00:08.335 --> 00:00:09.723
I'm gonna show you how to deploy your app.

5
00:00:09.723 --> 00:00:11.529
Because after all,
once you build something,

6
00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:13.841
it'd be nice to actually deploy it and
share it with people.

7
00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:16.157
So let's go ahead and
do that right now, and

8
00:00:16.157 --> 00:00:18.418
I'll show you how to do that with Netlify.

9
00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:19.802
So none of this has any code.

10
00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:23.390
So, basically, Netlify is a deployment
service similar to I think Vercel,

11
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.996
AWS, Cloud Flare,
there's a bunch of them out there.

12
00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:27.947
I just happen to be showing you Netlify.

13
00:00:27.947 --> 00:00:30.203
And so basically with a free account,

14
00:00:30.203 --> 00:00:33.175
all that we need to do here
is we just add a new site.

15
00:00:33.175 --> 00:00:36.694
So I can import it from any
project from GitHub directly, and

16
00:00:36.694 --> 00:00:39.599
we'll see why this is
important in just a moment.

17
00:00:41.228 --> 00:00:44.140
So basically authorizes it
with my GitHub credentials.

18
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.677
And then, we just did the TypeScript,
let's see,

19
00:00:48.677 --> 00:00:52.196
TypeScript search, search, search.

20
00:00:52.196 --> 00:00:53.363
Maybe I do the and.

21
00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:58.751
There you go, typescript-and-vue-workshop.

22
00:00:58.751 --> 00:01:02.098
And so what it'll do is it'll detect
a few things as far as the owner,

23
00:01:02.098 --> 00:01:03.040
branch to deploy.

24
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.421
And so currently for me, normally your app
is gonna be in your root directory, but

25
00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:07.793
for me, it's currently an app.

26
00:01:07.793 --> 00:01:11.358
And then the build command is
going to be npm run build.

27
00:01:11.358 --> 00:01:17.204
And then after that,
all I do is hit Deploy Site.

28
00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:23.035
Okay, and so what's really cool, I think,
about deployment these days, if anyone's

29
00:01:23.035 --> 00:01:27.133
done any old school deployment, is that a
lot of things have been automated for you.

30
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.857
So because we've hooked it up
directly to our GitHub repo,

31
00:01:29.857 --> 00:01:31.988
we get a lot of basically
benefits out of this.

32
00:01:31.988 --> 00:01:36.052
And so even just for the free project
stuff, it's pretty incredible.

33
00:01:36.052 --> 00:01:40.164
So you can see here that we have
an isolated container that's currently go

34
00:01:40.164 --> 00:01:43.565
ahead and building all the things,
and it's deploying it.

35
00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:47.693
And what's great is that once you're done
with this, you can see that, okay, well,

36
00:01:47.693 --> 00:01:50.823
I can still show you some things
[LAUGH] while this thing is broken.

37
00:01:50.823 --> 00:01:53.939
But because it's actually
hooked up to your GitHub repo,

38
00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.003
what it does it means that it
auto tracks in deployments.

39
00:01:57.003 --> 00:02:01.999
So in the instance, for example, let's
say that we wanted to update our tagline.

40
00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:06.355
So if I go to the navbar, for example.

41
00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:11.051
And inside the tagline we, see,
that's currently being imported on app.

42
00:02:11.051 --> 00:02:15.255
So I'm gonna say tagline, it looks
like it got deleted at some point,

43
00:02:15.255 --> 00:02:17.335
so track whatever you want to eat.

44
00:02:20.604 --> 00:02:28.218
And then if I just commit this,
I know why it's broken, okay, that's fine.

45
00:02:28.218 --> 00:02:32.781
Get commit, [SOUND] so

46
00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:37.094
feature a tagline.

47
00:02:37.094 --> 00:02:40.879
So let me check out, I forgot,
it's watching the main branch, so

48
00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.578
we're all the way up in 11.

49
00:02:42.578 --> 00:02:45.072
So just to show you that
this works real quick.

50
00:02:45.072 --> 00:02:50.798
Inside of my App.vue, we can go ahead and
just add an h1 to say hello.

51
00:02:50.798 --> 00:02:57.376
So I'm gonna delete this commit later,
so, Git commit,

52
00:02:57.376 --> 00:03:02.160
add title, delete me later, git push.

53
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.304
Okay, so one of the things it does for you
by default is that because it's watching

54
00:03:06.304 --> 00:03:10.390
your main branch, you'll notice that it
automatically picks up that change and

55
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.089
then automatically deploys it.

56
00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:14.997
And what's really nice about
the deployment services these days,

57
00:03:14.997 --> 00:03:18.007
especially for those getting started
with new projects, is that it,

58
00:03:18.007 --> 00:03:20.674
particularly with Netlify,
all of your deploys are atomic.

59
00:03:20.674 --> 00:03:23.681
In other words,
they live independently of one another.

60
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:25.980
So in the event you
ever need to roll back,

61
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.055
it really is as simple as basically
clicking on the deploy that you want and

62
00:03:30.055 --> 00:03:34.547
basically saying, hey, let's go ahead and
lock it to this particular branch.

63
00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:37.274
And this is huge when it comes to
deployment efforts because you can iterate

64
00:03:37.274 --> 00:03:37.803
a lot faster.

65
00:03:37.803 --> 00:03:41.169
And more importantly, you don't have to
worry that rollbacks are gonna be really

66
00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.745
expensive in case something breaks.

67
00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:46.472
But otherwise, just notice that if
you're building any apps, check

68
00:03:46.472 --> 00:03:50.592
out these kind of deployment services
cuz they can do a lot for your workflow.

69
00:03:50.592 --> 00:03:54.102
And when they deploy everything, they all
have their own CDN and all that caching

70
00:03:54.102 --> 00:03:57.712
and stuff is taken care of, which as those
of you who've done that in the past know,

71
00:03:57.712 --> 00:03:59.854
it's really painful to
manage that on your own.

72
00:03:59.854 --> 00:04:01.731
So, that's basically my little pitch,

73
00:04:01.731 --> 00:04:05.333
just something to keep in mind when you're
trying to deploy your next project.

74
00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:09.186
And so a lot of them have really generous
tiers, free tiers, and that kinda stuff.

75
00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:10.209
So be sure to check it out.

76
00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.139
And that's not even to talk
about serverless functions,

77
00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:17.104
which is the whole thing of itself, but
I did manage to get the deploy working.

78
00:04:17.104 --> 00:04:20.406
So I thought I might as well show
you kind of what happened and

79
00:04:20.406 --> 00:04:22.862
then that way you can
learn from my mistake.

80
00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:27.543
So we check out the build and
deploy configuration basically for

81
00:04:27.543 --> 00:04:29.198
how it is being built.

82
00:04:29.198 --> 00:04:30.901
Prior to this, actually,
this is what it looked like.

83
00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:34.864
So let me just delete this real quick and
save.

84
00:04:34.864 --> 00:04:38.498
So typically, when you're deploying
your app and it's on the root directory,

85
00:04:38.498 --> 00:04:42.027
it will automatically fetch some
configuration, automatically detect that

86
00:04:42.027 --> 00:04:44.550
you need to deploy the dist folder,
all that fun stuff.

87
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.653
Well, what you might have noticed is
if you're looking at my base right now,

88
00:04:47.653 --> 00:04:50.534
it knows that my base directory is app,
cuz that's what I configured.

89
00:04:50.534 --> 00:04:54.499
But I forgot to tell it that the published
directory is gonna be the dist folder

90
00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:55.353
within the app.

91
00:04:55.353 --> 00:04:58.758
And so basically, once I came in here and
then I dropped in the dist folder,

92
00:04:58.758 --> 00:05:02.706
that's what made everything work, which is
why here now, when I click on the deploy,

93
00:05:02.706 --> 00:05:04.949
you'll see, hey look,
everything works now.

94
00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.111
We have our restaurants,
we have our dishes, this is great.

95
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:11.579
And then now that we have that working,
something that's fun that you might want

96
00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:14.027
to know about is that this
randomly generated hash here,

97
00:05:14.027 --> 00:05:15.518
you can actually customize that.

98
00:05:15.518 --> 00:05:21.140
So for me, I'm just gonna go ahead and
this will be the toeat-mvc-app.

99
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.583
And so if I save that, you'll see
that within a matter of seconds,

100
00:05:24.583 --> 00:05:28.350
it's already been swapped out as
a subdomain, since it's available.

101
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.021
And you can see it actually does work.

102
00:05:30.021 --> 00:05:32.621
And now that can be shared as
the permanent link for the app,

103
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:35.897
which is actually pretty cool when you
think about the fact that we spend all

104
00:05:35.897 --> 00:05:37.731
this time building and creating things.

105
00:05:37.731 --> 00:05:40.850
I mean, we want an easy way to share it,
right, to share it with the world so

106
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.497
people can use it and do things with it.
