00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.080
Okay, so your turn is to take the dish
card and basically strip it down.

2
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.384
Go ahead and use your defined props and

3
00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:12.460
define emits to practice
defining that here.

4
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.084
So I will see you on the other side.

5
00:00:19.357 --> 00:00:23.411
So first thing first, let's go ahead and
throw on that setup attribute.

6
00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:27.249
So we can delete that import for
sure, and now I can delete this.

7
00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:29.819
And then once again let's
just comment this out for

8
00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:31.562
the sake of making things easier.

9
00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:37.250
And then we can canst,
statusColor equals computed.

10
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.153
And actually I need to import that, so

11
00:00:39.153 --> 00:00:42.650
let me use the autocomplete
to import that, great.

12
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.870
Then that comes down here,
that looks good.

13
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.550
And then the dish right now, it will be
broken but we know that, so that's fine.

14
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.242
And finally, we have const deleteDish.

15
00:00:53.242 --> 00:00:57.817
It's just a normal function, and once
again, we know that this is gonna break so

16
00:00:57.817 --> 00:01:00.193
we'll just comment that out real quick.

17
00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:03.360
Then we have that, that,
that, done, all right.

18
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.880
So now we complete what we wanna do,
so we have type propTypes.

19
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.200
And I'm just gonna say that there
is a dish, it will be of type Dish.

20
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.159
And therefore when we define the props,
we will pass it in

21
00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.270
via typecasting that we have propTypes and
then we run it as a function.

22
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.276
Don't forget this part, this part
is important cuz it needs to run.

23
00:01:26.276 --> 00:01:29.639
And then that takes care of all that
because the required property is taken

24
00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:31.930
care of by the fact that
it's a property on there.

25
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.010
And finally, we will define the emits.

26
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.610
And this time similarly, we'll also
pass it in the typecasting here.

27
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.559
We'll use the parentheses so
that the event, what is the event called?

28
00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:43.610
It's called delete-dish.

29
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.968
And then what are we
expecting as the payload?

30
00:01:45.968 --> 00:01:47.871
We're expecting a dish of type Dish.

31
00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:49.690
And finally, what will it return?

32
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.270
It's not gonna return anything,
so it's void.

33
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.593
So once we have that,
we're not quite done yet

34
00:01:54.593 --> 00:01:56.809
cuz we need to actually
refer to the things.

35
00:01:56.809 --> 00:02:03.560
So we'll have const props equals this,
and then we can say props.dish.status.

36
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.296
And then down here, we can just delete
this line entirely because when we, wait,

37
00:02:08.296 --> 00:02:12.160
I did not define my emit yet,
so const emit, there you go.

38
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.413
Once I have assigned that,
then we can emit.

39
00:02:14.413 --> 00:02:19.070
And then once again, control space is I
believe how most of us should be able to

40
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.230
get to it, that should be Mac or pc.

41
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.150
And then that'll give
you the auto complete.

42
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.839
Now if you're like me and you have
a bunch, don't forget that you always

43
00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.870
have to hit the up key first to get
down to the bottom, I don't know why.

44
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.470
But for now at least that's
how it's ordered on mine.

45
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.340
So if you can't find it,
it's probably cuz you need to hit up.

46
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.508
Then from here, what do we need?

47
00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:37.160
Well, we need a dish, so props.dish.

48
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.853
There we go.

49
00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:40.953
And so we can actually see even
the signature here, right,

50
00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:44.100
event delete dish takes type dish, done.

51
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.550
And I think that's everything.

52
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.143
No squiggly lines.

53
00:02:48.143 --> 00:02:53.006
Wait, we don't need this anymore,
unused, walla, magic.
