00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.440
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's cover animations.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.320
The thing with animations
is unlike transitions,

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.040
with transitions you could
just do a single animation,

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.600
with animations you can do single or
many or an infinite number.

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.401
It can be in one direction from 0 to
100% mark or go from 0 to a 100% and

6
00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:21.680
then 100% to 0.

7
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.942
You could have much more granual control.

8
00:00:23.942 --> 00:00:25.360
It could be initiated on page load.

9
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.220
It has more robust JavaScript hooks.

10
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.940
It can be paused.

11
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.330
And it's also the lowest
priority on the UI thread.

12
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.340
That means if you're loading
43 dependencies, and

13
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:45.250
you have animations that start when that
element is loaded and it has a delay.

14
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.470
The delay will expire while
you're loading, while your site.

15
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.750
It's basically going to give
everything else priority and

16
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.340
then it might start in
the middle of the animation.

17
00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.730
So you can either set the animations based
on a class that you add to the body.

18
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.730
Or you can get rid of all the stupid
frameworks that you're adding for

19
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.910
no apparent reason and
making your page slow.

20
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.710
Cuz you shouldn't be waiting four and
a half seconds for your page to load,

21
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.420
it should load and be completely
done in less than 19 seconds.

22
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.400
And so your animations that you did
on page load should not be expiring.

23
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.550
I don't have an opinion on it at all.

24
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.734
Okay, so the essentials for keyframe
animation is, one, to declare a keyframe.

25
00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:28.572
And a keyframe is something that
you can reuse over and over again.

26
00:01:28.572 --> 00:01:33.203
And then, that is separate,
that is is an app rule.

27
00:01:33.203 --> 00:01:36.340
And then on the element, you actually
add the animation-name, duration,

28
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.299
the timing-function, the iteration-count,
the direction, the play-state, the delay,

29
00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.183
and the fill-mode.

30
00:01:41.183 --> 00:01:42.959
Or at the end we're gonna
do the shorthand and

31
00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:45.953
you should definitely be using the
shorthand because those are a lot too many

32
00:01:45.953 --> 00:01:47.616
properties to be putting on one element.
