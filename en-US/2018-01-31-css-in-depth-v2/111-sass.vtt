00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:07.398
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so on the left hand
side right now I'm using Sublime, and

2
00:00:07.398 --> 00:00:10.850
on the left hand side it
lists all of my Sass files.

3
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.060
I have two files right here which
are basically my entire application.

4
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.353
And it says very simply, declares
the language, here's my presentation,

5
00:00:22.353 --> 00:00:25.655
here's the deck_functionality,
here's the buttons,

6
00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:28.850
here's a slide, here's a heading,
here's content.

7
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.736
When I have a definition list,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: In

8
00:00:33.736 --> 00:00:37.890
this deck I have a definition list, so
I want to include my definition list.

9
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.800
And I have also objects which
is I'm calling to some elements,

10
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.920
I'm calling the object element, and
I wanna style those a certain way.

11
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.000
And then on the slide call grid lines, and
I wanna import this for this deck only.

12
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.394
So each deck I basically am
using the all the same Sass

13
00:00:54.394 --> 00:01:00.280
files here, but
I'm using a different variables file.

14
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.850
So actually in here it should say,
import "variables".

15
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.150
So for each deck I have
a different variables file,

16
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.060
which is where I declare all my colors.

17
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.840
And then I very small Sass modules

18
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.350
where I just declare
the functionality on one thing.

19
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.889
So let's open buttons.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I have a next button and

20
00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:29.965
a previous button.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

21
00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:34.220
these are the only two buttons
that I have in the entire deck.

22
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.930
And all of my decks almost have them,
except for you saw that there

23
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.770
were ones that had buttons on left and
right and ones that had arrows.

24
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.490
S I changed it at some point to a triangle
rather, and this is the triangle one.

25
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.810
So when I decided that I really didn't
like those two buttons anymore and

26
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.740
I wanted triangles in the upper corner,
all I had to do was get rid of one _button

27
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.510
SCSS file and put another one in and
I didn't have to touch anything else.

28
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.860
And then I gave it the color of
color pop and inverted text.

29
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.697
So the background is color pop and
the color is inverted text.

30
00:02:12.697 --> 00:02:15.026
So when you saw that I
had different decks,

31
00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:19.030
they all look kind the same they
just have different color schemes.

32
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.235
All I did was change out
the variables file and

33
00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:27.391
have ten different colors declared and
the whole look of field changed.

34
00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:31.134
But in this one,
I have this thing called grid lines.

35
00:02:31.134 --> 00:02:36.086
And if you did the grid section,

36
00:02:36.086 --> 00:02:41.221
there was a page where it had a four

37
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:48.389
by four grid lines with
three blue grid cells.

38
00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.405
And so that thing is in CSS but

39
00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:56.571
it's only used by one of my talks,
one section.

40
00:02:56.571 --> 00:02:59.220
So there's no reason to pull
it into all the sections.

41
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.060
So the style CSS pulls it in, but
none of the other ones pull it in.

42
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.785
And if we take a look at
that grid lines right here,

43
00:03:08.785 --> 00:03:14.490
it's basically, grid lines is
the name of the class of the parent.

44
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.180
And then inside the div,
that's the direct child, is 460 pixels.

45
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.710
And I justify the content, and I actually
use display flex instead of grid because

46
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.520
I'm more comfortable with flex box than
I am with grid cuz I wrote a book on it.

47
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.330
And I'm using the colors of the page,
the alert and the color pop.

48
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.940
So if I actually were to
change the color scheme for

49
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.550
this grid section,
I wouldn't even have to update this.

50
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.708
So what you'll note that I'm
doing is I have very short,

51
00:03:46.708 --> 00:03:49.824
very, very short, Sass files and

52
00:03:49.824 --> 00:03:55.240
I have a lot of them.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Definition

53
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.350
list is how I did my definition list.

54
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.780
I didn't even use nesting on this
one because I pulled it from

55
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.480
code that was all ready produced,
but it's ten lines long.

56
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.091
If I don't have a definition list
I don't include this in my Sass

57
00:04:11.091 --> 00:04:14.626
file until I include a definition list.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

58
00:04:14.626 --> 00:04:18.780
it's not that I'm using Sass for
any of the functions.

59
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.560
The reason I'm showing you this
is how I'm ordering my code.

60
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.630
So if I have a group of people
working on a section of a website,

61
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.790
they all need the same header, and
they all need the same footer, and

62
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.200
they all need the page layout the same.

63
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.290
But only one group has the finance widget.

64
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.960
So they can include all the same shell and
then they can include the finance widget,

65
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.590
and all they have to do is
pull in the finance Sass file

66
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.500
which might have 12 sub Sass files.

67
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.750
And when they decide that they're
no longer gonna do five year,

68
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.600
it's a finance widget so look at the last
day, last five days, last month,

69
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.690
last two years, last five years.

70
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.090
We are not doing five years anymore and
we are not doing two years anymore.

71
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.040
They can just cut out the multi year
functionality and change that one thing.

72
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.120
And it will go all the way up the chain,
right.

73
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.530
You only have to change
it at one location.

74
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.150
So I'm not telling you what classes
names to use, though I think it's much

75
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.100
very important to use something that has
a functionality, like you saw color pop.

76
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.990
It didn't say the red in the corners,
it said color pop,

77
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.670
which is the popping color for that deck.

78
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.927
Inverted text,
I have the main colored text and

79
00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:30.300
then I have an inverted text when you
have dark on light versus light on dark.

80
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:41.070
By keeping it modular like this, when I
remove a slide I just remove the moldule.

81
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.327
All I do is go into my styles.css.

82
00:05:45.327 --> 00:05:48.460
If I were to remove guideline from
the deck, I would just do that.

83
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.150
And I've just lost 20 lines of CSS,
which isn't much, but

84
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.660
when you start having legacy
objects that are no longer there.

85
00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.530
And all the names are basically
the functionality of that Sass file,

86
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.990
it's exactly what it does.

87
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.040
The variables are just variables, the
presentation is the overall presentation.

88
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.756
The functionality is what
makes it go right to left.

89
00:06:09.756 --> 00:06:13.893
That stuff that goes with the JavaScript.

90
00:06:13.893 --> 00:06:16.040
The slide is the individual slide.

91
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.540
The heading is the heading for
the whole document.

92
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.028
The content is the content for
the whole document, definition list, or

93
00:06:22.028 --> 00:06:23.450
print style sheet.

94
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.110
And it's not really a print style sheet,
it's the at media print.

95
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.120
It gets rid of the stuff
that I don't want to print.

96
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.100
And then object and grid lines.

97
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.558
So just the simplicity of modulizing it,
and that's kind of what I wanted to cover.
