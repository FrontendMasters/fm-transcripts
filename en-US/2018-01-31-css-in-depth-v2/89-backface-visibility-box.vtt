00:00:03.183 --> 00:00:08.303
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: When
we did CSS mastery and

2
00:00:08.303 --> 00:00:15.292
we had the snowflakes coming down.

3
00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:17.547
The reason that they're going left and
right and

4
00:00:17.547 --> 00:00:21.244
floating is because the transform origin
is actually outside of their center.

5
00:00:21.244 --> 00:00:25.134
So they're being translated from top
to bottom, but they're spinning and

6
00:00:25.134 --> 00:00:28.185
they're spinning around a point
that is not in the center.

7
00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:32.465
So they're basically spinning around going
like this, but since they're going down,

8
00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.248
they're actually going like that.

9
00:00:34.248 --> 00:00:35.885
So all of them are doing this, but

10
00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:39.173
you can't really see that it's
doing that because it's so slow.

11
00:00:42.088 --> 00:00:44.072
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Kinda cool?

12
00:00:44.072 --> 00:00:46.174
So that was the magic of transform-origin.

13
00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:50.231
So the keyword positions are left,
right, bottom, top, and center.

14
00:00:50.231 --> 00:00:52.746
You can use any length value or
any percentage value.

15
00:00:52.746 --> 00:00:56.451
The default is the center, at 50 50%.

16
00:00:56.451 --> 00:01:00.300
And it's and I should get rid of Prefixed.

17
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.970
It's basically supported in any
browser that supports transforms,

18
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.260
supports transform-origin,

19
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.310
and you don't need to prefix it because
prefixing is no longer necessary.

20
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.237
Then, we have transform-style,
and that is for 3D features.

21
00:01:16.237 --> 00:01:21.031
If you have a 3D element on top of
another 3D element, it's basically,

22
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:24.682
do you wanna preserve 3D, or
do you wanna make it flat?

23
00:01:24.682 --> 00:01:30.105
It's how to handle nested elements
that also rendered in a 3D space.

24
00:01:30.105 --> 00:01:34.907
Oddly, there's a few properties
where it won't work if that you

25
00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:37.100
have it at the default value.

26
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.828
So if you've declared overflow,
clip, clip-path, filter,

27
00:01:40.828 --> 00:01:44.424
mask-border-source, mask-image or
mix-blend-mode,

28
00:01:44.424 --> 00:01:47.630
which are all properties
that we haven't covered yet.

29
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.490
See why this book is so big?

30
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.347
Then it doesn't actually do anything.

31
00:01:56.347 --> 00:02:04.007
It's set on the parent and I tried making
it appear like what it would look like.

32
00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:09.020
So basically the parent is
translated in the 3D space and

33
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.510
so is the child and
the child is kinda coming at you,

34
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.760
if it was actually flat it would not.

35
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.464
Okay, backface-visibility.

36
00:02:19.464 --> 00:02:24.364
I was talking about RSVP, when you flip
it, you don't wanna see it backwards,

37
00:02:24.364 --> 00:02:27.449
because you don't want to
see these upside down.

38
00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:33.856
So basically, here both of these
have translated 180 degrees and

39
00:02:33.856 --> 00:02:37.840
one you can see, and the other you can't.

40
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.616
So here there actually
is generated content.

41
00:02:41.616 --> 00:02:45.884
If I do 0 you can see both of them.

42
00:02:45.884 --> 00:02:48.992
If I do 90, you can see neither of them.

43
00:02:48.992 --> 00:02:52.801
If I do 85 degrees,
you can see both of them but barely.

44
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:54.304
But if I do a 105,

45
00:02:54.304 --> 00:03:01.010
one of them you can't see it all because
I did backface-visibility: hidden.

46
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.134
But the first one I did
backface-visibility: visible, and

47
00:03:05.134 --> 00:03:08.154
if you can see you can't
actually read RSVP.

48
00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.049
So let's actually do it
completely upside down.

49
00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:15.524
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Right?

50
00:03:15.524 --> 00:03:21.129
They're both translated in the exact same
way, or rotated in the exact same way.

51
00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.974
One is backwards, and
I'm saying you can't look at it now.

52
00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:30.233
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
let me just see if, okay I didn't show.

53
00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:35.081
So when you'll see like playing cards or
something like that online,

54
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:38.625
You'll have a plain card here and
this is the face.

55
00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:40.758
And this is the back of the card.

56
00:03:40.758 --> 00:03:47.048
And so you rotate both and you think it's
doing this, but really you can't do this.

57
00:03:47.048 --> 00:03:48.793
They're both doing that.

58
00:03:48.793 --> 00:03:50.268
They're both rotating.

59
00:03:50.268 --> 00:03:52.743
But when it hits this mark,
you want this one to be seen.

60
00:03:52.743 --> 00:03:54.392
And you don't want this
one to be seen anymore.

61
00:03:54.392 --> 00:04:00.957
You don't want the one in front just show
the backwards, like the back of the RSVP.

62
00:04:00.957 --> 00:04:05.400
You wanna show the back of the card,
you don't wanna show the ace.

63
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.318
They're all basically the same.

64
00:04:08.318 --> 00:04:13.453
Okay, the king, you don't want the K to
be backwards, like if you had a king and

65
00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:18.680
you rotated it Like this, and you saw
the cards still, the K would be backwards.

66
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.615
So you want to make it look like the face
of the card is going behind here, and

67
00:04:22.615 --> 00:04:25.310
you do that by saying,
you can do it one of two ways.

68
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.413
You can actually change the z index or you
can just say back face visibility hidden.

69
00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:39.533
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This isn't supported yet
or it's just starting to be,

70
00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:42.848
it's in Firefox,
it's in Chrome 64 and Upper 51.

71
00:04:42.848 --> 00:04:46.512
So it's something I haven't played with
yet but it's basically the viewbox, so

72
00:04:46.512 --> 00:04:49.220
the transform box properties,
so in the future this would be

73
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.992
a property
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: In

74
00:04:54.992 --> 00:04:58.681
the future transform-box property
will have a value of border-box,

75
00:04:58.681 --> 00:05:01.271
which means that the border
is the box reference.

76
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:06.073
It will have fill-box which will be
the bounding-box as a reference box, and

77
00:05:06.073 --> 00:05:08.706
then view-box which is currently in SVG.

78
00:05:08.706 --> 00:05:11.910
It's kinda like the view box on SVG but
it's not yet supported so

79
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.067
I can't really explain it yet
because I don't really know it.
