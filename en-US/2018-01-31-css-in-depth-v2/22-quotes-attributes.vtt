00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.885
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
let's go back to generated content.

2
00:00:04.885 --> 00:00:08.643
So we have quotes.

3
00:00:08.643 --> 00:00:12.724
That was one of the options,
which was beginning quote and end quote.

4
00:00:12.724 --> 00:00:17.311
And so here when you hit,
it's supposed to have a quote,

5
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:22.473
you can say the first quote at
the opening is this type of quote and

6
00:00:22.473 --> 00:00:25.070
at the end is that type of quote.

7
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.400
But if it's nested, give me option
number three and number four.

8
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.800
So the first one is typical US,

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.080
which is double quotes on either side and
then single quotes on a nested quote.

10
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.131
In France, when you quote something,
you would have angle brackets,

11
00:00:42.131 --> 00:00:45.450
a double angle bracket on
the outside of a quote.

12
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.418
And if there was a quote
nested on the inside,

13
00:00:48.418 --> 00:00:50.930
you would have an angled apostrophe.

14
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.510
And then you say basically
quote before and quote after.

15
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.070
So if you have a quote within a quote,
and here's an example of it via CodePen.

16
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.400
So as she lay on her pillow, she whispered
in my ear, did you feed the cats?

17
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.039
Cuz it's romantic.

18
00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:15.651
So here we have an inner quote and
then the outer quote.

19
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:20.218
And then if it's in

20
00:01:20.218 --> 00:01:25.075
French, [FOREIGN].

21
00:01:25.075 --> 00:01:31.112
So the outer quote is
a double angle bracket.

22
00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:33.650
You see here in the end and
at the beginning.

23
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.267
And then the inner quote,
which is did you feed the cats, [FOREIGN],

24
00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:39.563
is a single quote.

25
00:01:42.847 --> 00:01:45.931
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So you can actually go
to CodePen and play around with that and

26
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:47.209
switch your languages.

27
00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:50.950
Or actually, let's do change view and
do editor view.

28
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.614
And as you see here,
it just says qqqq, right?

29
00:01:57.614 --> 00:02:02.243
And here it says language en,
a quote that comes.

30
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.207
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I didn't know that that
would be necessary, the greater than.

31
00:02:12.207 --> 00:02:14.166
I'll just try this.

32
00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:15.229
I don't know why I have the.

33
00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:21.566
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's still
loading down below, and

34
00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:23.634
I won't be able to see live changes.

35
00:02:23.634 --> 00:02:26.230
So let's just move on from this, but
you can play with it yourself later.

36
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.185
So no-close-quote is basically saying,
don't give a close quote.

37
00:02:31.185 --> 00:02:35.898
And so all these quotes,
let's open in CodePen in a new window.

38
00:02:40.453 --> 00:02:47.950
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So here,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I'm

39
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.181
seeing on every paragraph right after it,
do not close the quote, right?

40
00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:54.720
No close quote.

41
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.550
Except for the last of type,
close the quote.

42
00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.069
So if I'm quoting a book, that would make
sense, cuz the whole thing's a quote and

43
00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.311
then there's lots of quotes
on the inside and we're good.

44
00:03:05.311 --> 00:03:10.118
So that's what no close quotes does,
is it basically says don't close a quote.

45
00:03:10.118 --> 00:03:16.980
And then you can also do no quote and
then before it doesn't have a quote, okay?

46
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.126
So let's go back to generating content.

47
00:03:19.126 --> 00:03:20.605
Basically, you're never gonna use this.

48
00:03:20.605 --> 00:03:23.150
This is one of those things where
you don't need to memorize it.

49
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.500
Just know if you ever hit the issue,
there's something about quotes, right?

50
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.720
Okay, so
let's go back to Attribute Values.

51
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.106
We talked about this earlier.

52
00:03:35.106 --> 00:03:42.592
So here it says, any href that starts
with http is usually an external link.

53
00:03:42.592 --> 00:03:43.695
Make the position relative.

54
00:03:43.695 --> 00:03:47.926
And then after it,
put content of the attribute,

55
00:03:47.926 --> 00:03:50.760
the value of the href attribute.

56
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.164
Position that absolutely,
put it 1em from the top, left 0,

57
00:03:54.164 --> 00:03:57.710
background color black,
color white, padding, line height.

58
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.796
This is a local example of
a quote because it's not

59
00:04:03.796 --> 00:04:08.210
doing anything and
this is an external quote.

60
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.616
So let me Google that for you.

61
00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:12.145
I saw someone with a let me
Google that for you sticker.

62
00:04:12.145 --> 00:04:15.878
Let me Google that for
you css generated content.

63
00:04:15.878 --> 00:04:18.257
Why did I position this relatively,
does anyone know?

64
00:04:20.923 --> 00:04:24.950
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Why did I position
it relatively only on hover?

65
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.118
So I positioned it relatively on hover, so

66
00:04:28.118 --> 00:04:32.166
first of all I positioned
it relatively because here,

67
00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:36.577
the href itself,
because this is positioned absolutely.

68
00:04:36.577 --> 00:04:41.274
And when you position something
absolutely, it's relative to its parent or

69
00:04:41.274 --> 00:04:45.609
ancestor, nearest parent or
ancestor that is either positioned fix or

70
00:04:45.609 --> 00:04:50.820
positioned absolute or relative but
not static and static is the default.

71
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.270
So I need to have it positioned
relative or something similar.

72
00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.370
Otherwise, it would be in the upper
left-hand corner of that whole slide.

73
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.030
So that's why we did that.

74
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.152
But why did I do it on hover?

75
00:05:07.152 --> 00:05:10.936
The reason I did it on hover only,
and not always,

76
00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:17.266
is because if something is positioned
relatively, it has a new stacking context.

77
00:05:17.266 --> 00:05:21.496
And so it'll appear like it
has a higher [INAUDIBLE], and

78
00:05:21.496 --> 00:05:24.467
stuff will not be able to go on top of it.

79
00:05:24.467 --> 00:05:30.678
So only when I hover it do I actually
give it a position of relative.

80
00:05:30.678 --> 00:05:34.425
Cuz if it had a position of relative
all the time, it would basically be

81
00:05:34.425 --> 00:05:38.610
sticking on top of other content,
if like I had a module over it.

82
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.807
So let's play with this one.

83
00:05:46.066 --> 00:05:46.850
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We're not gonna stop.

84
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.895
We'll just take 30 seconds and
play with it and see how you can style it.

85
00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:57.746
And just basically say,
like if we do this and

86
00:05:57.746 --> 00:06:01.328
get rid of this part, then.

87
00:06:01.328 --> 00:06:05.287
We have to get rid of this part there.

88
00:06:05.287 --> 00:06:06.060
You see?

89
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.541
You don't actually want to show that.

90
00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:10.937
But you do wanna show where this goes.

91
00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:13.330
So ten more seconds, and
then we'll continue on to the next one.
