00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.850
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Now that we've talked
about where we're going to place it,

2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.690
let's talk about its shape and its size.

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.250
So you have two options.

4
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.200
You have circle and ellipse.

5
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.790
If you didn't know this,
a circle is an ellipse.

6
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.840
But it's an ellipse that is
the same height as width.

7
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.160
So ellipse is the default.

8
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.040
And if you have a square, right?

9
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.320
A square size background image.

10
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.280
It's probably gonna be a circle,
if it's positioned in the middle.

11
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.880
The circle or
the ellipse can be declared explicitly or

12
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.376
implied via a declaration size.

13
00:00:38.376 --> 00:00:44.380
If you declare the size and you only
use one value, then that's the radius.

14
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.940
If you declare two values, it's
the width and the height in that order.

15
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.170
And the percentage size is only for
ellipses,

16
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.980
though you might end up with
a circle if it's, you know.

17
00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.741
So here we have an ellipse.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That is in the center

18
00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:06.178
because we didn't actually say at 50 50,
but we could have said ellipse at 50%.

19
00:01:06.178 --> 00:01:11.449
50% right?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We

20
00:01:11.449 --> 00:01:16.438
could've said circle at 50% 50%, and

21
00:01:16.438 --> 00:01:20.244
we could have said 20% 20%,

22
00:01:20.244 --> 00:01:25.548
okay.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Notice

23
00:01:25.548 --> 00:01:27.310
that it got bigger, right?

24
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.443
The circle got bigger.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Right

25
00:01:33.443 --> 00:01:40.120
now it fits in the page,
and when we did 10%.

26
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.050
It was way bigger that the height of the
page, we'll cover that in a minute, but

27
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.090
just notice that that happened.

28
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.440
So you can have circle,
you can have ellipse.

29
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.633
Ellipse by default, we'll have the same

30
00:01:55.633 --> 00:02:05.194
aspect ration as the image size.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: But

31
00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:06.880
it's usually not by default.

32
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.854
So you saw here when I had it at 10%,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That it was

33
00:02:11.854 --> 00:02:12.860
now taller than was wide.

34
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.780
That's because it goes to the furtherst
corner and we'll cover that in a minute.

35
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.345
But just want to point that out.

36
00:02:21.345 --> 00:02:31.050
Okay, so in this example I
just said ellipse or circle.

37
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.130
I didn't give it a size,
you can actually give it a size.

38
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.820
Here it's a 640 by 490,
which is actually the size of the slide.

39
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:47.720
And that's why, if I actually did this.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This and

40
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.580
this are the exact same because
I gave it the size of the slide.

41
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.714
But if I gave it 300 or 200, 100.

42
00:02:59.714 --> 00:03:01.800
200, right?

43
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.800
It's basically 200 pixels tall.

44
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.090
And 640 pixels wide.

45
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.200
It's 200 pixels from here to this
point here, the outside of the purple.

46
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.835
Rebecca purple.

47
00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:42.710
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so

48
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.030
you see it's going to be on
the bounds of the parent.

49
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.555
Because it's 640px from this point,
to the end of that gradient.

50
00:03:51.555 --> 00:03:52.705
So if I wanted it to fit.

51
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.760
I think I would have to do 320.

52
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.490
No, I don't know how big my thing is.

53
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.140
It's probably 500.

54
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.680
960 would be 480.

55
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.143
Yeah okay, it's closer to 480.

56
00:04:08.143 --> 00:04:12.650
And not, it's closer to 960.

57
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.240
I think the [INAUDIBLE] is 900, right?

58
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.790
450, yep.

59
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:17.298
It's 450 pixels.

60
00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:25.550
My screen, the slide area is
900 pixels by, I believe, 470.

61
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.170
So that would be 230, except for
it's not, so I don't know how tall it is.

62
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.360
So, that's sizing,
you can size it any way you like.

63
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.510
However, if you want a circle,
you just give one.

64
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.740
Since that's too big to really see,
let's do two hundred and fifty pixels.

65
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.965
We can make this five percent and
five percent.

66
00:04:53.965 --> 00:04:56.192
Actually lets make it 15%.

67
00:04:56.192 --> 00:04:57.540
[INAUDIBLE] 15%.

68
00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.640
We now have a 45.

69
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.370
Does anyone know here what a 45 is?

70
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.260
Some people are old enough.

71
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.374
Okay, it's like a little record.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,

72
00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:11.240
percentages only work wit ellipsis.

73
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.980
Because they're relative
to the Background size.

74
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:24.290
So it'll turn into a circle if you have
the same background image that's a square.

75
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:33.283
But by default, it will be in ellipse.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,

76
00:05:33.283 --> 00:05:39.430
so the thing to notice, however If
you're using percentages, right?

77
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.379
As a length, you need to.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

78
00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:47.580
now it's 50% of the width and
50% of the height.

79
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.870
When you only declare one, it fails.

80
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.104
Because the first value
is the horizontal and

81
00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:58.240
there is no vertical
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That could be one pixel.

82
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.168
And there you have a line at 200 pixels,
there.

83
00:06:03.168 --> 00:06:04.300
That's ugly.

84
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.980
Okay, that's better.

85
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:14.000
Okay next, you can also size,
right now we've done lengths.

86
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.300
Percentages, you can also use key terms.

87
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.620
And the default, when you don't use any
size whatsoever it's farthest corner.

88
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.580
So right now,
the center of my thing is right here.

89
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.380
And it goes all the way to here
cause that's the farthest corner.

90
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.060
You could say basically make
the edge the closest side.

91
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.400
But 100% mark the closest side,
the closest corner, the farthest side, or

92
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.820
the farthest corner.

93
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.060
We used to have contain and cover.

94
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.585
These are no longer supported.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

95
00:06:45.585 --> 00:06:49.890
you can barely see it but
there's a tiny bit of purple here.

96
00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:54.980
Because at the 98% mark it hits
It hits the farthest corner,

97
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.330
right here at the 100% mark.

98
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.933
So we just have a teeny bit of purple.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If I

99
00:07:01.933 --> 00:07:06.902
do closest corner
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: it's gonna

100
00:07:06.902 --> 00:07:09.250
be kind of small cuz the closest
corner is right down here.

101
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.660
And it's pale goldenrod all the way
till two pixels to the end, right?

102
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.960
So you can't see it cause
there's the scroll bar, but

103
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.160
you can see a dot of purple.

104
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.510
So let's just make this 96 and
then 96, and you can

105
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.870
kind of see a little bit more.

106
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.780
But look at all this Rebecca purple.

107
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.460
So the end of our gradient
is actually here.

108
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.910
But it continues on with the last
value and fills up the whole screen.

109
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.732
Let's move this from bottom
40 pixels to center.

110
00:07:47.732 --> 00:07:50.751
Actually no, 40%.

111
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.734
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Actually, let's do 30,

112
00:08:00.734 --> 00:08:04.249
30.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay so here,

113
00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:08.680
our circle got much bigger
because the closest corner.

114
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.660
It's still the closest
corner is down there, right?

115
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:17.045
But the size of the circle is whatever the
length is from that dot to that corner.

116
00:08:20.779 --> 00:08:22.271
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And so for 90%,

117
00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:27.230
6% which is of the 100%,
it's gonna be and run.

118
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:35.531
So let's try, close this side.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There,

119
00:08:35.531 --> 00:08:39.170
it's smaller because the closest side is
closer than the closest corner, right?

120
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:44.900
This From this dot to the end,
it's closer today from this dot to that.

121
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:51.100
You're always gonna have closest
side be shorter than closest corner.

122
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:57.454
And farthest corner is always gonna
be farther than farthest side.

123
00:09:02.779 --> 00:09:05.037
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Farthest-side is here.

124
00:09:05.037 --> 00:09:09.940
Farthest-corner is gonna be a point
in my screen that's [INAUDIBLE].

125
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.620
It's gonna be up here.

126
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.560
So those are the key terms.

127
00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:19.970
A closest corner, closest-side,
farthest-corner, and farthest-side.

128
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.500
And here are the explanations if you want

129
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.972
them.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

130
00:09:25.972 --> 00:09:28.876
here I'm using background size to actually

131
00:09:28.876 --> 00:09:32.960
make something slightly cute
that you would never ever want.

132
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.690
If we actually did five pixels

133
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.200
by five pixels, that might make
a decent background, right?

134
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.520
Because if I pick better
colors because it's subtle.

135
00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:53.380
Could be subtle if we do light gray.

136
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:04.498
That's a decent background, right?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 50 pixels by 50 pixels.

137
00:10:04.498 --> 00:10:08.881
Not really.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

138
00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:14.580
what I did here is it does background
image is a radial gradient.

139
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.480
I want it to be a circle.

140
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.740
And the I said the background
size should be 50, 50.

141
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.090
So the circle.

142
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:27.690
Is basically saying, from the 0% mark
to the 50% mark, make it purple.

143
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:32.910
And from the 50% to the 100% mark,
make it gray.

144
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:38.440
So we basically have a purple
area that is 25 pixels wide and

145
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.940
a but it looks more like 3020.

146
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.460
It's the radius.

147
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.939
So the radius is 50% of,
it's a radius, it's not the diameter.
