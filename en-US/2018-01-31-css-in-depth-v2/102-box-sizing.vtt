&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,
another property that we have in CSS, and

2
00:00:04.795 --> 00:00:09.035
I've used it several times over
the past two days, is box sizing.

3
00:00:09.035 --> 00:00:14.161
Originally, the box sizing for
all the browsers other

4
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:18.961
than IE was content box,
and that is the box model.

5
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:23.975
It basically says we need to clear
a width, that's gonna be the width

6
00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:29.500
of the content, and if you declare
padding it's gonna be bigger.

7
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.660
And so you would have things that were
more than 100% because you declare width

8
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.160
of 100%, you put padding on it and
all of a sudden it's 120%.

9
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.240
So border box, box sizing, border box,
basically replicates the old IE model.

10
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.510
And says include that padding in that
width so that you don't go over that 100%.

11
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.900
So you saw many times when
I want to fix something,

12
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.410
I just put box-sizing border-box.

13
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.600
I should put a little star, but
don't do that cuz then you don't

14
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.516
wanna do a global selector and
choose any feature, really.

15
00:01:02.516 --> 00:01:07.700
Because buttons and

16
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.990
inputs and replaced elements will
also get whatever you're doing.

17
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.609
And you want to make sure
that's not over kill.
