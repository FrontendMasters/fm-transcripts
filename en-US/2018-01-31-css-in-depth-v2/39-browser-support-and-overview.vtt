00:00:02.807 --> 00:00:08.634
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So browser support.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So

2
00:00:08.634 --> 00:00:13.507
the reason I have a load button for
browser support for

3
00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:18.075
can I use, but I have no internet access.

4
00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:19.675
All browsers can use it.

5
00:00:19.675 --> 00:00:23.431
The reason I have a load button is
because if your action page comes in,

6
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:26.695
kinda like Code Pen,
it shifts everything over to the left.

7
00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:28.325
So I create a little feature.

8
00:00:28.325 --> 00:00:33.570
Anyway, I don't know why I'm not
getting let me just try this here,

9
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.930
I do have internet access.

10
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.730
So look at all that green.

11
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.930
That's beautiful, isn't that beautiful?

12
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.840
And if I do show all, you're talking
a long time, but with prefixing,

13
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.060
and you're talking about starting
with IE10 but with prefix.

14
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.110
We are not going to cover
the prefix values because we're so

15
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.040
close to being done with them that I'm not
going to spend the time going over them.

16
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.720
Here is the specification.

17
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.390
It's called a CSS3 feature, but
as I mentioned earlier today,

18
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.920
it's actual level 1,
because it is the first level of flexbox.

19
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.900
It's the first time
that it's been defined.

20
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.960
It's been being defined for years.

21
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.120
So here I have an unordered
list of navigational items.

22
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.070
It says Home, About Us, Jobs, and Contact.

23
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.840
And because they're list items,
they take up the whole width, right?

24
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.740
So
&gt;&gt; Estelle: There's

25
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.490
a typo in here somewhere that I'm supposed
to remove so that it actually works.

26
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:43.369
Display flex.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Where's my typo?

27
00:01:44.627 --> 00:01:46.824
There.

28
00:01:46.824 --> 00:01:51.134
Sometimes I put typos in things so
that it doesn't activate and

29
00:01:51.134 --> 00:01:56.092
I couldn't see that I put it back so
let me just put the period back in front

30
00:01:56.092 --> 00:02:00.990
of this okay so one notice
the period is not removed from here.

31
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.510
If the parent is not flexed the flex
property does absolutely nothing.

32
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.810
Here, I'm going display a flex.

33
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.670
That's all I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna do two things, two new features.

34
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.530
I'm gonna display flex and
I'm gonna justify-content center.

35
00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:24.363
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And align, whatever.

36
00:02:26.736 --> 00:02:30.577
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So, by basically just setting.

37
00:02:42.586 --> 00:02:43.670
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay.

38
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.920
If all I had done was use
the two basic properties,

39
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.360
it's already looking really good.

40
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.630
I just displayed the parent as flex.

41
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.640
And then I said make all
the children the same size.

42
00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.610
If I got rid of this it would not grow.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: That still looks good, right?

43
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.140
Just display and flex.
&gt;&gt; Female: What does auto do?

44
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.835
&gt;&gt; Estelle: We're going to cover all of

45
00:03:05.835 --> 00:03:06.898
that.
&gt;&gt; Female: Okay.

46
00:03:06.898 --> 00:03:07.987
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay.

47
00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:13.220
So, holy grail layout, or magically
holy grail layout, I think it is.

48
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.160
So, we, you often create a page, right?

49
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.130
You have a header, an article,
the navigation, the aside and the footer.

50
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.390
Sometimes you might have
the article after the navigation,

51
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.510
but for mobile I would rather have
the article before the navigation.

52
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.010
Which one do you want?

53
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.940
Basically you wanna code it in the order
that you want to search engines and

54
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.300
the readers to use it,
your optimum reading order.

55
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.990
You can display it however
you want afterwards.

56
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.710
So here I have the header,
the article, the navigation,

57
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.950
the aside the footer because the aside and
the footer are not important and

58
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.690
the nav I want after the article,
but you can go the other way around.

59
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.550
So all I'm gonna do is I'm going
to display flex on the body.

60
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.626
I'm going to say I want to flow in columns
which is going to be a top A middle and

61
00:04:03.626 --> 00:04:05.020
a bottom.

62
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.660
And then the main, which surrounds
the article of the Nav on this side.

63
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.590
I'm going to also display that flex.

64
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.569
So the main is going to be both
a flex item and a flex container.

65
00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:19.810
We're going to understand this
better even if this makes no sense.

66
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.460
I'm going to explain everything and
then it's all going to make sense.

67
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.360
And then it's going to be flex of 1,
which means all the elements can grow or

68
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.040
that element mainly can grow.

69
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.745
And that article, which is a child of
main, is going to have a flex of 1.

70
00:04:34.745 --> 00:04:37.210
And Nav is going to have
an order of negative 1,

71
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.560
which means it's going
to change the placement.

72
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.452
So let's get rid of
the comment right here.

73
00:04:42.452 --> 00:04:43.980
And there we go.

74
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.660
So what that is, it's basically
said header, the main section, and

75
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.280
the footer are displayed flex.

76
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.840
The main section is also displayed flex,
and

77
00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.350
within that, within this group of article,
nav and aside.

78
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.900
I took the navigation, I change the order
of that navigation, I put it first.

79
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.170
And I'm gonna teach you all
how to do this later on, but

80
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.740
I just wanna give you an overview
of what we're gonna cover.

81
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.420
Then I had the article in the aside,
and basically the nav and

82
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.000
the aside were as small
as they needed to be, and

83
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.550
the article was allowed to grow
to take up everything else.

84
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.342
So I'm gonna show you how to make that
article grow, and I'm gonna show you how

85
00:05:24.342 --> 00:05:27.331
to both make things Laid out in rows and
in rows and in columns,

86
00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:31.259
which is the opposite of how it's declared
and it's going to be very confusing.
