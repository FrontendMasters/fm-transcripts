00:00:02.299 --> 00:00:07.360
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The thing is with
Flexbox, what was really complex became

2
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.917
super easy cuz these three
columns are all lined up.

3
00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:16.035
And that on the bottom, body div,

4
00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:20.011
display flex, div div flex one,

5
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:25.129
is all I needed to do and
then I could do div,

6
00:00:26.883 --> 00:00:30.860
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: div last of type.

7
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.405
This is not gonna work either
because I'm quoting live

8
00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:37.934
and,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: flex: 2 and

9
00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:41.870
then you can make it twice as big.

10
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:42.900
Like that, right?

11
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.784
Or you could just get rid
of flex: 1 altogether.

12
00:00:47.784 --> 00:00:51.150
And they can all be the exact same height.

13
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.840
So you either make them
all the same width.

14
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.070
Or all the same height.

15
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.150
Like all the content.

16
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.390
Each one is two to three lines, right?

17
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.630
That's how easy Flex Box is.

18
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.280
And if you're looking at this going
how did she just do that, don't worry,

19
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.030
we'll cover it.

20
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.570
So let me show you some
examples of some flex.

21
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.065
So this is what I call a power
grid which has nothing

22
00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:18.775
is lined up in terms of
the navigation of the bottom so

23
00:01:18.775 --> 00:01:22.326
grid is not the best solution for this.

24
00:01:22.326 --> 00:01:27.280
But so flex box is I think but
some people would disagree with me.

25
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.920
But we have both.

26
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.770
We'll cover grid next after flex box.

27
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.980
No, we cover tables and then grid.

28
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.650
So in these three examples,

29
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.390
you have unicorns cuz you need
to have kittens and unicorns.

30
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.380
We've done the kittens, now,
we've done the unicorns.

31
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.800
And these are actually unicorns.

32
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.160
These are animals with only one horn.

33
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.760
Very unique.

34
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.480
If you drink their blood,
you have a half life.

35
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.290
So if you notice that all
the images are the same height and

36
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.990
no matter what the size of the paragraph
is, the buttons are all in the bottom.

37
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.650
And we can learn how to do
that in just a few lines.

38
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.810
And then the navigational elements,
they're all the same size.

39
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.570
And the footer is on the bottom,
and the navigation is on top.

40
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.120
But if you switch to having
a way narrower screen,

41
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.530
without changing the HTML at all we
have a navigation on the bottom.

42
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.380
And without the lines.

43
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.530
So you see how we can change
a layout without changing our HTML.

44
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.590
I moved the navigation from
the top to the bottom.

45
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.000
And then I did this site which has cats or
kittens.

46
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.760
Cuz kittens are important.

47
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.660
And at the bottom,
this was a little hackish but

48
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.320
I'm gonna open this up in a new window.

49
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.198
And then I'm gonna resize this.

50
00:02:54.198 --> 00:03:00.180
And as you can see the cats
get down to about 200 pixels?

51
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.198
And then one pops up and
we then we go down and it pops up.

52
00:03:05.198 --> 00:03:08.600
And at the bottom, it's nicely lined up.

53
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.560
So the popping of,
it basically says, it's 300 pixels,

54
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.300
it's 200 pixels to 300 pixels and once
you get bigger than 300 pixels, pop down.

55
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.520
That's default flex box,
that's what makes flex box really easy.

56
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.440
This line, you see as much
shorter than the next line,

57
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.030
which is the default for flex box.

58
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.380
Which some people don't want, they
don't want everything the same height.

59
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.850
And for that we have grid.

60
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.730
And then this being empty, that is not
the default for flex, I used a hack.

61
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.420
And I'm gonna show you
the hack at the end.

62
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.040
But that's usually why people would want a
grid, but you can do all of these things.

63
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.850
So, let's go back into Flex Box and
show you a few more features.

64
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.110
Here we have a sticky header and
a sticky footer.

65
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.380
So if you see the part in the middle, and

66
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.980
we don't need to know
how tall our page is.

67
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.520
It will always have a sticky header and
a sticky footer.

68
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.170
For usability reasons, you actually never
want to have both the sticky header and

69
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.720
a sticky footer.

70
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.020
You can have a sticky header or
a sticky footer but

71
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.680
don't do both because if I was on
a mobile device in landscape mode,

72
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.380
I would have two centimeters
of legible text.

73
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.849
So bad idea but
I did wanna show you that it was possible.

74
00:04:25.881 --> 00:04:27.880
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
then you can have inline.

75
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.910
Don't ever do this because it's
one big button with the label and

76
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.750
a button input on the inside.

77
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.200
It's just to show you that you can do it.

78
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.180
But don't ever do value
stability like this.

79
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.069
But basically, if this were
a button that you could click on.

80
00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:46.302
Where would you click on the button if you
wanna submit the button without actually

81
00:04:46.302 --> 00:04:47.830
checking it?

82
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.048
Right, but this is the kind of trick
that bad user experience designers do.

83
00:04:51.048 --> 00:04:53.531
And there are actually good user
experience designers working for

84
00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:54.151
bad companies,

85
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:57.580
where they want you to select something
you don't actually want to select.

86
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.160
So here I have three elements
in less than 100% width.

87
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.490
It says display: inline-flex.

88
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.081
If I had said display flex it would
take up the whole page, right?

89
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.655
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And it's the width
of the small section on the right is

90
00:05:14.655 --> 00:05:18.900
140 pixels so
that was just to make it narrow.

91
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.713
If I didn't have that,
it would take up much more room.
