1
00:00:01.586 --> 00:00:03.551
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So colors.

2
00:00:03.551 --> 00:00:06.391
These all these color
have exact same value.

3
00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:07.706
They are all white.

4
00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:08.571
So you can declare it white,

5
00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:10.985
you can have a three digit hexadecimal
value, a six digit hexadecimal value and

6
00:00:10.985 --> 00:00:12.589
you can also have an eight
digit hexadecimal value.

7
00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.371
This might be new to some people, but

8
00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:22.107
the six characters are basically
the white from above,

9
00:00:22.107 --> 00:00:26.388
and the last two Fs mean 100% opaque.

10
00:00:28.147 --> 00:00:31.920
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So we now have
eight digit hexadecimal values for

11
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.067
the last two being so
its rgba is basically what it is.

12
00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:40.250
Then we have rgb which is red,
green, blue and

13
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.708
you can either use 0 to 255 or
you can use percents from 0 to 100.

14
00:00:46.708 --> 00:00:49.746
You cannot combine the two
that is incorrect.

15
00:00:49.746 --> 00:00:55.559
You can't put percent on some and
0 to 255 on the other.

16
00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.933
So then we rgba which is the same thing
but with the last value being the opacity.

17
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:05.769
In this case, we're trying to get to 1,
so it's 100% opaque, or 1.

18
00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:10.781
Then with hsl and hsla, which is hue,
saturation, and lightness, which if you

19
00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:15.659
use Photoshop, it's similar to hue,
saturation, and brightness I think?

20
00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.464
Yeah, HSB.

21
00:01:17.464 --> 00:01:23.265
And we have hsla, which is the same thing
but with enough transparency at the end.

22
00:01:23.265 --> 00:01:28.212
And then we have two other
things which is the key term

23
00:01:28.212 --> 00:01:32.945
of transparent and
the key term of current color.

24
00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:36.495
Current color is the current
color of the text.

25
00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:42.661
So let's go first to white
which is the named key terms.

26
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:49.317
We've got a bunch of them in CSS 2 and
CSS 3, and or in CSS 2.

27
00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:54.227
The only one that was added
since then is Rebecca Purple,

28
00:01:54.227 --> 00:01:58.113
so the co-author of this book, Eric Meyer,

29
00:01:58.113 --> 00:02:02.322
his daughter passed away
on her sixth birthday.

30
00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:06.493
And because he's the Oprah of CSS, and

31
00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:10.666
his daughter's name was Rebecca, and

32
00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:15.470
her favorite color was purple,
it was a color

33
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.274
that was not yet used, I believe its 639,

34
00:02:20.274 --> 00:02:24.850
it's one of my favorite colors actually.

35
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.311
So that's the only one that's
been added since the original.

36
00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:31.507
Then we have current color and
current color is a special color and

37
00:02:31.507 --> 00:02:36.174
no matter what color, and it's usually
the default for a lot of things.

38
00:02:36.174 --> 00:02:40.805
So like if you do border, and
you do three border solid, 3 pixels or

39
00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:42.200
just border solid.

40
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.085
When you do a border, we'll cover that
later, but borders you have to declare

41
00:02:47.085 --> 00:02:49.942
what type of border it is and
that's all you have to declare.

42
00:02:49.942 --> 00:02:52.416
The other two values are default.

43
00:02:52.416 --> 00:02:56.296
They default to medium which is
3 pixels wide in most browsers.

44
00:02:56.296 --> 00:02:59.350
And they default to
currentColor as the color.

45
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.689
Which is the color of the text.

46
00:03:03.945 --> 00:03:07.041
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There's other
named colors, such as currentColor,

47
00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:08.866
which have become deprecated.

48
00:03:08.866 --> 00:03:11.526
So these will work in a lot of browsers.

49
00:03:11.526 --> 00:03:14.670
And they're just here for
legacy reasons just to remind you,

50
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.460
if you actually hit this,
this was valid at one point.

51
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.458
Then, we have RGB and RGBA.

52
00:03:23.458 --> 00:03:26.334
So all colors, well, that's not true.

53
00:03:26.334 --> 00:03:31.748
All colors used to be RGB, whether it was
hexadecimal notation or RGB notation.

54
00:03:31.748 --> 00:03:34.322
Now, we have the HSL, which is different.

55
00:03:34.322 --> 00:03:39.613
And we also had CMKY, which is cayenne,
magenta, which is for print.

56
00:03:39.613 --> 00:03:43.011
I don't know if that still exists or not.

57
00:03:43.011 --> 00:03:49.007
So when we have hexadecimal notation,
the first two digits are the red,

58
00:03:49.007 --> 00:03:54.922
the second two digits are the green,
the third two digits are the blue.

59
00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:58.537
Similarly, when we have RGB,
it stands for red, green, blue.

60
00:03:58.537 --> 00:04:01.100
That's what the R, G, and the B stand for.

61
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.667
As I said earlier, you can have
it with numbers from 0 to 225,

62
00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:10.921
with 0 being black or
complete lack of color, and

63
00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:14.792
255 being complete saturation of color.

64
00:04:14.792 --> 00:04:18.091
Or you can do percent with zero
being complete lack of color and

65
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.191
100% being complete saturation.

66
00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:25.376
And then we can also add an alpha
transparency if we add the A at the end.

67
00:04:25.376 --> 00:04:31.200
So in this case,
I use percents on the latter one and

68
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.001
0 through 55 on the prior one.

69
00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:40.017
Again you can't mix this up and
what could I've done

70
00:04:40.017 --> 00:04:45.802
there as well is put 40 BF AC
like CC something like that.

71
00:04:45.802 --> 00:04:51.301
No 66 probably for
0.2 I don't know what 0.2 actually is but

72
00:04:51.301 --> 00:04:57.481
I could have put those eight digit codes,
but we'll cover that in a second.

73
00:04:57.481 --> 00:05:02.001
Then we have HSLA Colors,
which are hue, saturation,

74
00:05:02.001 --> 00:05:04.994
lightness and alpha transparency.

75
00:05:04.994 --> 00:05:10.542
So the hues go from zero,
which is red through

76
00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:16.250
to orange through to yellow, past yellow.

77
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.953
Yellow is in there somewhere.

78
00:05:19.633 --> 00:05:26.624
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah, through to green
and blue and purple and back to red.

79
00:05:26.624 --> 00:05:31.498
So this right here,
that thing right there is actually 360

80
00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:34.786
separate spans with each color in there.

81
00:05:34.786 --> 00:05:35.739
That's how I did that.

82
00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:38.237
I could've just used a gradient, but

83
00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:41.916
why make things easy when I
can put 360 divs in there.

84
00:05:41.916 --> 00:05:45.084
Saturation.

85
00:05:45.084 --> 00:05:50.206
100% saturation means full of color and
0% saturation is always

86
00:05:50.206 --> 00:05:55.602
going to be a gray because it means
the color is completely not saturated.

87
00:05:55.602 --> 00:05:57.982
Generally, you wanna go with 100 there.

88
00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:05.035
And lightness, 100% is always gonna
be white, 0 is always gonna be black,

89
00:06:05.035 --> 00:06:09.926
and 50% is kinda the midpoint
of super bright color.

90
00:06:13.361 --> 00:06:16.122
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
then alpha transparency,

91
00:06:16.122 --> 00:06:20.591
you have fully opaque and
somewhat transparent.

92
00:06:20.591 --> 00:06:23.862
And the reason that you can
still HSLA Colors right there,

93
00:06:23.862 --> 00:06:26.080
is because I have text shadow on there.

94
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.967
So I have a color that
is alpha transparent,

95
00:06:31.967 --> 00:06:35.632
but the text shadow is not.

96
00:06:35.632 --> 00:06:39.365
So box shadows are actually
just shadows on the outside or

97
00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:41.164
on the inside of a element.

98
00:06:41.164 --> 00:06:45.074
Where as text shadow is actually behind
the whole text, it's a copy of the text in

99
00:06:45.074 --> 00:06:48.942
a shadow form and you can move it, but
it's actually a shadow of the whole text.

100
00:06:53.432 --> 00:06:58.113
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, then I have this
little converter, I reprogrammed it for

101
00:06:58.113 --> 00:06:59.067
this task and

102
00:06:59.067 --> 00:07:04.372
I hope that it works because it worked
a month ago when I reprogrammed it.

103
00:07:04.372 --> 00:07:08.503
Take some long time to make 702 slides.

104
00:07:08.503 --> 00:07:13.813
So here,
if I change the alpha transparency,

105
00:07:13.813 --> 00:07:18.356
I can actually figure out what 0.2 is.

106
00:07:18.356 --> 00:07:21.074
0.2 is 33.

107
00:07:21.074 --> 00:07:22.511
Remember when I was
trying to figure it out.

108
00:07:22.511 --> 00:07:25.287
So here's my color converter.

109
00:07:25.287 --> 00:07:26.749
I have a GitHub repo, you can use it.

110
00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:28.284
It's open source.

111
00:07:28.284 --> 00:07:32.101
It basically allows you to
pick any color you want and

112
00:07:32.101 --> 00:07:36.018
any alpha transparency you want but
do you need this?

113
00:07:38.765 --> 00:07:44.010
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let me show you cool
feature go off of transparency there,

114
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:44.658
okay?

115
00:07:44.658 --> 00:07:48.040
I'm going to go and check my inspector.

116
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.695
I'm going to go look at this div here.

117
00:07:50.695 --> 00:07:56.282
And it says the background
color is RGB 245 148,

118
00:07:56.282 --> 00:07:59.446
that's what it says, right?

119
00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:00.050
Okay, cool.

120
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:04.981
We got it right but if I open this up,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It gives

121
00:08:04.981 --> 00:08:07.223
me the information here, and

122
00:08:07.223 --> 00:08:11.897
I can actually convert it to
HSOA in hexadecimal right there.

123
00:08:14.103 --> 00:08:18.403
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So you actually have
a full on color picker in your developer

124
00:08:18.403 --> 00:08:23.650
tools which is how I pick the hideous
color on the back of this slide deck.

125
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:28.552
So I'll pick a color, open it up and then
pick another color I thought clashes just

126
00:08:28.552 --> 00:08:32.405
enough to make it hideous and
then that's how I pick the colors.

127
00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:39.253
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So let's get out of here.

128
00:08:39.253 --> 00:08:43.963
Okay, another feature in here is,

129
00:08:43.963 --> 00:08:49.461
yeah, you see I use rebeccapurple a lot.

130
00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:54.195
This is the rebeccapurple and
royalblue deck,

131
00:08:54.195 --> 00:08:57.979
and if I click on this text right here,

132
00:08:57.979 --> 00:09:02.565
and
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I go down to color.

133
00:09:08.996 --> 00:09:10.266
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Anyone seeing color?

134
00:09:12.894 --> 00:09:17.916
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If I open this up here,
can you see that white line right there?

135
00:09:17.916 --> 00:09:20.028
That is an accessibility feature.

136
00:09:20.028 --> 00:09:23.130
If I wanna make sure that
I have enough contrast,

137
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.986
which currently, my contrast is at 11.9,
which is serious contrast.

138
00:09:27.986 --> 00:09:32.065
But if I pick this color here,
it'll say, low contrast.

139
00:09:32.065 --> 00:09:34.856
So there's actually, if you wanna make
sure that your site is accessible, there's

140
00:09:34.856 --> 00:09:37.705
accessibility features, but there's
actually separate accessibility features.

141
00:09:37.705 --> 00:09:42.342
But within this right here,
if you're gonna pick a color,

142
00:09:42.342 --> 00:09:44.939
pick one that's below the line so

143
00:09:44.939 --> 00:09:50.999
that you know that you have enough color
contrast for people with low vision.

144
00:09:50.999 --> 00:09:54.726
Okay, so then we have RGBA, so
you saw that we used RGBA here,

145
00:09:54.726 --> 00:09:56.239
let me just update this.

146
00:09:56.239 --> 00:09:58.942
So that we're actually on track, okay.

147
00:09:58.942 --> 00:10:03.083
RG is the red, the green, the blue and

148
00:10:03.083 --> 00:10:08.268
the alpha and
these were the different values.

149
00:10:08.268 --> 00:10:15.617
So 20% is 33, 75% is BF.

150
00:10:15.617 --> 00:10:21.325
And the we have Can I Use, oops, and
so far it does not work in rereg and

151
00:10:21.325 --> 00:10:26.052
it's coming soon I guess
the Samsung Internet browser,

152
00:10:26.052 --> 00:10:30.305
but it's working on Firefox,
Chrome and Safari.

153
00:10:36.872 --> 00:10:40.511
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Did I tell you we
are gonna make ugly stuff today?

154
00:10:40.511 --> 00:10:42.745
This qualifies.

155
00:10:42.745 --> 00:10:47.577
Okay, so change the colors above,

156
00:10:47.577 --> 00:10:51.610
what does coloring color do?

157
00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:57.323
So the background,
the color is this right?

158
00:10:57.323 --> 00:11:03.146
And the color rather is this form
of pink so let's just call it pink.

159
00:11:03.146 --> 00:11:06.195
Because I can't really read
HSL cuz I'm not a designer.

160
00:11:06.195 --> 00:11:09.171
So the thing is, the background,

161
00:11:09.171 --> 00:11:14.519
did you see how the background
changed to pink when I did that?

162
00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:15.756
So let's do royal blue.

163
00:11:17.489 --> 00:11:20.004
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
I'm changing the color, and

164
00:11:20.004 --> 00:11:22.991
then the current color change value.

165
00:11:22.991 --> 00:11:26.943
So the background change value because
the current color change value.

166
00:11:26.943 --> 00:11:33.017
So currentColor is whatever color
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The foreground color or

167
00:11:33.017 --> 00:11:34.641
the the text colors at this time.

168
00:11:34.641 --> 00:11:40.404
So,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If I

169
00:11:40.404 --> 00:11:45.347
did border solid.

170
00:11:45.347 --> 00:11:48.127
It's going to be that currentColor right?

171
00:11:48.127 --> 00:11:54.281
If I said border solid 3 pixels,
it stays the same because the default is.

172
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:58.428
And then if I do current color,
it stays the same.

173
00:11:58.428 --> 00:12:01.617
But if I change this to green.

174
00:12:01.617 --> 00:12:03.840
The border's going to change
because I used CurrentColor.

175
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.725
It's whatever the color is.

176
00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:08.020
Okay.

177
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.516
So a few tips.

178
00:12:09.516 --> 00:12:13.182
Transparent is rgba to transparent black.

179
00:12:13.182 --> 00:12:15.123
CurrentColor is the current text color.

180
00:12:15.123 --> 00:12:19.629
Accessibility, color should never be
the only visual means of providing

181
00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:21.960
information to your user.

182
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.790
So if your text is black, and
your links are dark green,

183
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.800
and they're not underline,
some people can't see it.

184
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.280
If your text is red, and your links
are green, you have no taste but

185
00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.540
also some people can't read
it cuz they're color blind.

186
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:42.780
It's either low vision, it needs
a high contrast or we have people,

187
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.780
10% of men have color blindness.

188
00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.660
And I used to ask sometimes in sessions,
is there anyone here colour blind and

189
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.860
apparently that is not
a good thing to ask.

190
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:51.920
So I don't ask that anymore.

191
00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:03.000
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then appearance, wow,
I have no clue why this is on the slide

192
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.466
but it's a good segway so
it's probably gonna come up next.

193
00:13:07.466 --> 00:13:12.357
Appearance is a property that allows you
to change the appearance of elements.

194
00:13:12.357 --> 00:13:16.176
So by default, the browser will say like
the appearance of a button looks like

195
00:13:16.176 --> 00:13:19.134
a button and you can actually
use Clearance to change that.
