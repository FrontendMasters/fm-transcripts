00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:08.530
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so we've gone over
a whole slew of attribute selectors.

2
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:15.743
So just to recap,
we have just the fact that it's present,

3
00:00:15.743 --> 00:00:20.085
the fact that it has an exact value.

4
00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:34.562
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Starts with a language,

5
00:00:34.562 --> 00:00:37.338
I mean, it starts with a language or

6
00:00:37.338 --> 00:00:41.149
it starts with any character
followed by a dash.

7
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.790
Okay, that's what the pipe means.

8
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.275
Starts with is the caret,
dollar sign is ends with,

9
00:00:52.275 --> 00:00:58.308
and the star is anywhere
within the element, and

10
00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:05.369
then the i means case-insensitive.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

11
00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.960
as I was talking about earlier,
print media.

12
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.740
Any time you have an abbreviation
that has a title,

13
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.330
you can add the long form of
that title when you print it.

14
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.340
Because they can't hover it over
an abbreviation to see what that title is.

15
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.060
Or each time you have something
that starts with HTTP in

16
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.870
your print style sheet, print the href.

17
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.930
In your generated content value, ATTR wrap

18
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.950
parenthesis means that you can
actually print that attribute value.

19
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.400
The attribute, whatever you put in there,
will not be processed.

20
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.360
Basically will be exactly as seen.

21
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.430
So if you have a URL,
it's not gonna print the image.

22
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.430
It's gonna print the URL as written,
the string.

23
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.180
So if you want to play
with a few of these,

24
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.670
then let's play with a few of these.

25
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.074
We can first start off
by saying font size.

26
00:02:05.074 --> 00:02:07.580
I'm gonna make it much smaller so
we can see the whole page.

27
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.820
Well, you can actually scroll down.

28
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.170
So here it says any Li that has a title,
make it purple and make it bold.

29
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.600
So we have
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: two that have titles.

30
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.090
Inside that title it says unicorn, right?

31
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.800
So, I can say anywhere
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: unicorn.

32
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.490
Here it matches unicorn.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Here

33
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.407
it matches unicorn as well, but

34
00:02:48.407 --> 00:02:52.770
if I put a tilde it means a full word.

35
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.110
I didn't cover that before so

36
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.880
that's why I'm covering it here
cuz it was below the fold.

37
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.700
So the tilde says full word.

38
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.960
And in the first one it says unicorns,
that's not a full word.

39
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.260
So it did not match,
that is the one I missed.

40
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.400
But if you go down to
the bottom of the page,

41
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.340
I'm just gonna make the font size much
smaller, so that I can stop scrolling.

42
00:03:19.922 --> 00:03:21.149
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Font size

43
00:03:29.825 --> 00:03:32.428
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's make it smaller

44
00:03:32.428 --> 00:03:35.170
even, six there we go.

45
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.590
And I put the wrong closing and
that's why it didn't work.

46
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.340
So as you'll see here it says li, title.

47
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.672
So has the title attribute,
that has a full word,

48
00:03:48.672 --> 00:03:53.840
space separated full word of
unicorn matches the last one.

49
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.620
If I add an s here,
it'll match the first one.

50
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.350
If I type it capital, it matches neither.

51
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.390
And here's a moment of truth.

52
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.570
If I add an i, will it match?

53
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.030
Yes it does.

54
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.500
So this browser supports case and

55
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.470
sensitivity.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If you wanna play with

56
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.360
that, you can do that during the break.

57
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.998
Let's move on.
