00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.346
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There are events.

2
00:00:03.346 --> 00:00:09.875
So every transition event, every
transitionend event, throws an event.

3
00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:14.458
So every property that is
transitioned will throw an event.

4
00:00:14.458 --> 00:00:17.902
And so I talked about this earlier today,
which is border-top-color,

5
00:00:17.902 --> 00:00:22.294
border-right-color, border-bottom-color,
border-left, border-top-width,

6
00:00:22.294 --> 00:00:24.962
border-right-width, border-bottom-width,
and

7
00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:27.476
border-left-width will
have a transition event.

8
00:00:27.476 --> 00:00:30.693
And I made a mistake earlier today
when I said there would be 12.

9
00:00:30.693 --> 00:00:35.690
There's a maximum of eight, because
there's no midpoint between solid, and

10
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.818
dotted, right?

11
00:00:36.818 --> 00:00:40.598
So that will not throw an animation event,
or transitionend event,

12
00:00:40.598 --> 00:00:42.954
because it didn't actually transition.

13
00:00:42.954 --> 00:00:45.819
It will go instantly from one to
the other, it will change, but

14
00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:52.337
it won't change over time.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So every single property,

15
00:00:52.337 --> 00:00:57.755
and in both directions.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

16
00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:04.855
let me show you two examples of,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: transitions.

17
00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:09.431
Here, when I go over this, it opens up.

18
00:01:09.431 --> 00:01:14.502
And there's no JavaScript to
make this navigation work,

19
00:01:14.502 --> 00:01:17.195
who uses JavaScript for this?

20
00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:19.211
Stop.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

21
00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:21.612
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: [LAUGH]

22
00:01:21.612 --> 00:01:22.945
Most people use JavaScript,

23
00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:25.995
you're not the only one,
cuz people don't realize how easy it is.

24
00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:28.277
So let's talk about how easy it is.

25
00:01:28.277 --> 00:01:32.654
So the navigation is actually there,

26
00:01:32.654 --> 00:01:36.891
but I scaled it to 0 pixels tall, and

27
00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:40.736
100% of the original width.

28
00:01:40.736 --> 00:01:42.772
So why did I do that?

29
00:01:42.772 --> 00:01:45.182
Because I want to drop down.

30
00:01:45.182 --> 00:01:49.147
If I scaled it to 0,
it would open up in both directions.

31
00:01:49.147 --> 00:01:54.275
But instead, I go like this,
basically, and then I pop it down.

32
00:01:54.275 --> 00:01:57.137
I could've actually
rotated it 180 degrees,

33
00:01:57.137 --> 00:02:01.714
and then brought it back down, but I put
the top transitional origin at the top.

34
00:02:01.714 --> 00:02:04.768
So it starts from the top, and goes down.

35
00:02:04.768 --> 00:02:08.624
So I scale it from 1 to 0.

36
00:02:08.624 --> 00:02:12.897
The transform-origin is top,
center, it transitions over,

37
00:02:12.897 --> 00:02:17.737
there should be a space right there,
oops, over 200 milliseconds.

38
00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:19.980
200 milliseconds is good.

39
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.217
200 milliseconds is enough for

40
00:02:22.217 --> 00:02:25.773
a user to get the line without
getting the frustrated.

41
00:02:25.773 --> 00:02:28.866
You don't want them to notice
that something is animating, but

42
00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:30.420
you want things to seem smooth.

43
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.957
So when it pops in instantly,
it's a little jarring,

44
00:02:32.957 --> 00:02:34.731
so just 200 milliseconds is good.

45
00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:41.472
But I did wait 50 milliseconds before it
starts, just in case someone does that.

46
00:02:41.472 --> 00:02:46.355
I don't want that stuff to pop
open when they don't intend to

47
00:02:46.355 --> 00:02:48.282
go over a link, right?

48
00:02:48.282 --> 00:02:50.133
So I put the position, absolute.

49
00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:55.383
So these drop-down menus are exactly
100% from the top of their parent,

50
00:02:55.383 --> 00:02:58.302
so they start right
here at the white line.

51
00:02:58.302 --> 00:03:01.586
So when I hover over the word topics,
right?

52
00:03:01.586 --> 00:03:05.105
These are also hovered
because they are nested.

53
00:03:05.105 --> 00:03:09.853
Right now,
I'm still hovering over the li of topics,

54
00:03:09.853 --> 00:03:13.581
because I'm in the nested ul inside of it.

55
00:03:13.581 --> 00:03:20.509
So when I hover over it,
the hover state is just scaled at 100%.

56
00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:23.846
I could've just done scale 1, right?

57
00:03:23.846 --> 00:03:25.248
That would have worked, too.

58
00:03:25.248 --> 00:03:26.897
And let's just see, yep.

59
00:03:26.897 --> 00:03:30.172
I don't actually know if this slide
is active or not, I think it is,

60
00:03:30.172 --> 00:03:31.215
anything down here?

61
00:03:31.215 --> 00:03:31.856
No.

62
00:03:31.856 --> 00:03:37.653
So my transition function
is basically all,

63
00:03:37.653 --> 00:03:44.429
or just transform.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: My duration

64
00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:49.911
is 0.2 seconds, and I think I'd rather
have an ease-in as a timing function.

65
00:03:49.911 --> 00:03:52.103
We'll cover timing
functions in a little bit.

66
00:03:52.103 --> 00:03:56.263
That looks a little bit smoother
than linear, I like that one better.

67
00:03:56.263 --> 00:04:01.283
And there's a 50 millisecond delay.

68
00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:03.915
I can't actually go off of these in
the middle because they are a little

69
00:04:03.915 --> 00:04:04.459
bit too fast.

70
00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.919
But I can't force it to finish,
you see that?

71
00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:13.063
But it still looks smooth.

72
00:04:13.063 --> 00:04:15.317
Okay, I'm not gonna cover that.

73
00:04:15.317 --> 00:04:18.321
So here, I'm going to pick a card.

74
00:04:18.321 --> 00:04:23.258
And here,
I basically have two divs in each one.

75
00:04:23.258 --> 00:04:24.841
There's a front, and the back of the card.

76
00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:28.277
So there's a parent div called card,
and there's a front, and a back, and

77
00:04:28.277 --> 00:04:29.202
I rotate them both.

78
00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:34.901
And then I do backface-visibility,
none, on the one that says A.

79
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:38.289
And since I'm cheating,
and I only have aces,

80
00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:43.636
it would've actually looked the same
if it was front-to-back, or not.

81
00:04:43.636 --> 00:04:51.739
Okay, the thing to note is I
can't keep them flipped over,

82
00:04:51.739 --> 00:04:55.804
and this is really annoying.

83
00:04:55.804 --> 00:05:03.784
That's a problem with transitions.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

84
00:05:03.784 --> 00:05:06.082
here, you see where my mouse is?

85
00:05:06.082 --> 00:05:10.057
And that it's not over any single card?

86
00:05:10.057 --> 00:05:12.661
It's because it was over it when it
started, and then it continued to move,

87
00:05:12.661 --> 00:05:13.691
and I didn't move the mouse.

88
00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:17.403
The second I move the mouse,
it's gonna go back, you see that?

89
00:05:17.403 --> 00:05:19.892
Okay, so
what did I do with the transition?

90
00:05:19.892 --> 00:05:23.613
The transform is rotateX(0deg),

91
00:05:23.613 --> 00:05:28.969
rotateY(0deg), and
that is the front of the card.

92
00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:32.126
Preserve-3D, backface-visibility
is hidden.

93
00:05:32.126 --> 00:05:37.185
And transition takes
four-tenths of a second.

94
00:05:37.185 --> 00:05:44.290
The front on hover rotates 180 degrees,
so it flips over.

95
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.027
But there's backface-visibility,
hidden, originally,

96
00:05:48.027 --> 00:05:52.280
oops.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay.

97
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.618
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The back of the card,

98
00:05:56.618 --> 00:05:58.468
I rotated it negative 180.

99
00:05:58.468 --> 00:06:04.993
And then when I hover over it,
I rotate it to 0, to default.

100
00:06:04.993 --> 00:06:07.148
And that's basically it.

101
00:06:07.148 --> 00:06:09.694
And I'm sick of this card, it's going
forward, so I'm just gonna stop there.

102
00:06:09.694 --> 00:06:11.998
You can look at the code.

103
00:06:11.998 --> 00:06:15.205
But as you've seen, a lot of
the features from the transitions, and

104
00:06:15.205 --> 00:06:16.266
from the transforms.

105
00:06:16.266 --> 00:06:21.911
So the idea with transforms is you declare
which property you want to transform,

106
00:06:21.911 --> 00:06:25.231
how long it should take,
the timing function,

107
00:06:25.231 --> 00:06:29.563
which we're gonna cover during animations,
and the delay.

108
00:06:29.563 --> 00:06:33.263
And then you have to remember
that it goes in one direction,

109
00:06:33.263 --> 00:06:37.044
one way, and then it reverses
the direction on the way back.

110
00:06:37.044 --> 00:06:40.522
If you have five steps,
it'll take five steps on the way back.

111
00:06:40.522 --> 00:06:43.606
If it's linear on the way in,
it will be linear on the way back.

112
00:06:43.606 --> 00:06:47.301
If it's ease-in, on the way in,
it'll be ease-out, on the way back.
