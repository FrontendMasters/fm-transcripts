00:00:03.108 --> 00:00:06.674
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so flex-direction
property, this is the first property.

2
00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:09.273
We know how to create a flex container.

3
00:00:09.273 --> 00:00:12.828
The first property on that flex
container that we're gonna

4
00:00:12.828 --> 00:00:15.326
cover is the flex-direction property.

5
00:00:15.326 --> 00:00:21.700
So you can say, row, row-reverse,
column, or column-reverse.

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.783
So because that makes no sense to you,
I'm going to actually show you.

7
00:00:25.783 --> 00:00:27.937
So we have display: flex.

8
00:00:27.937 --> 00:00:32.238
And then we have this
flex-direction: column-reverse.

9
00:00:32.238 --> 00:00:35.055
So we have box A, box B, and box C.

10
00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:41.987
And if you see, A is on the bottom,
B is in the middle, and C is on top.

11
00:00:41.987 --> 00:00:45.795
And as much as I can be snarky, I'm not
actually going to put things in reverse

12
00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:48.675
order in my code, it actually does go A,
B, C in the code.

13
00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:52.784
If I do just column, it goes A, B, C.

14
00:00:52.784 --> 00:00:57.763
If I leave it off, it's A,B,C.

15
00:00:57.763 --> 00:01:02.381
This is the same as row,
which is the default.

16
00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:03.905
Now this looks like columns to me, right?

17
00:01:03.905 --> 00:01:06.909
It's three columns.

18
00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.110
But it's all in one row.

19
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.050
And when it was columns, it looked like
three rows, but it was all in one column.

20
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.834
So that's a little thing that
took me a while to go like,

21
00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:20.446
why are they naming it this way?

22
00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:26.160
But now it makes sense.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

23
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.216
then we have row-reverse.

24
00:01:33.216 --> 00:01:35.760
And so that makes it C, B, A.

25
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.799
So the presentation is reversed.

26
00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.693
But if I were to use a screen reader,
or if it had links, and

27
00:01:41.693 --> 00:01:44.899
I was tabbing through,
it would actually not change the order.

28
00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.617
So the A would be hit first, then the B,
then the C, no matter what I do,

29
00:01:49.617 --> 00:01:56.837
in terms of laying this out.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So that's flex-direction.

30
00:01:56.837 --> 00:01:59.418
You have row, row-reverse, column, and

31
00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:05.455
column-reverse.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So in this layout,

32
00:02:05.455 --> 00:02:11.485
right here,
this navigation is displayed as row.

33
00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:17.682
And this thing right here is displayed
as column, it has one, two, three.

34
00:02:17.682 --> 00:02:24.234
And the whole page has one, two,
three, four elements, okay?

35
00:02:24.234 --> 00:02:29.818
So this is the hardest thing to explain,

36
00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:32.619
it's in this book.

37
00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:38.625
And it took me six weeks to write
ten pages explaining main axis,

38
00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:42.199
and cross axis, and main direction.

39
00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:46.492
So the main axis, when it's on row,

40
00:02:46.492 --> 00:02:53.011
in left-to-right languages,
is left-to-right.

41
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:57.582
The cross axis is perpendicular to that,
and is top-to-bottom.

42
00:02:57.582 --> 00:03:02.914
So who here does internationalization
in right-to-left languages?

43
00:03:02.914 --> 00:03:04.057
Or in top-to-bottom languages?

44
00:03:04.057 --> 00:03:05.839
Does anyone have to do that?

45
00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:10.798
Okay, so realize that the power
of flex is that if you

46
00:03:10.798 --> 00:03:14.870
just change the language, this changes.

47
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.035
So if I was actually writing in
a left-to-right language, or

48
00:03:19.035 --> 00:03:21.009
right-to-left language.

49
00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:25.740
And this said alpha, beta, and gamma,

50
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.087
or no, alph, bed, gammo.

51
00:03:29.087 --> 00:03:33.156
If it said alph, bed, gammo,
and it was in Hebrew,

52
00:03:33.156 --> 00:03:36.036
it would actually have it reversed.

53
00:03:36.036 --> 00:03:41.128
Row would have alpha in that
this would be the same as,

54
00:03:41.128 --> 00:03:44.195
basically, inverted for you.

55
00:03:44.195 --> 00:03:49.300
So you don't have to worry about your CSS
when you're doing internationalization.

56
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.307
If it was top-to-bottom language,
it would have the A,

57
00:03:55.307 --> 00:03:59.482
the B, and the C from top-to-bottom.

58
00:03:59.482 --> 00:04:05.502
Okay, so this right here is for
left-to-right, top-to-bottom language.

59
00:04:05.502 --> 00:04:09.346
So the main axis in
a left-to-right language,

60
00:04:09.346 --> 00:04:13.297
goes from left-to-right,
if it's set to row.

61
00:04:13.297 --> 00:04:17.332
And the cross axis is from top-to-bottom.

62
00:04:17.332 --> 00:04:21.338
We have certain properties that will
align things on the main axis, and

63
00:04:21.338 --> 00:04:24.830
certain properties that will
align things on the cross axis.

64
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.506
And then certain things that,
when we have more than one row,

65
00:04:28.506 --> 00:04:32.692
will widen things on the cross axis,
based on how many rows there are.

66
00:04:32.692 --> 00:04:35.516
So the first axis will, or the first row,

67
00:04:35.516 --> 00:04:39.488
will all be at the top, or
all be centered within its axis.

68
00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:42.071
So understanding the main-axis.

69
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:46.705
I'm gonna be using the main axis,
and cross axis, cross-start, and

70
00:04:46.705 --> 00:04:49.728
cross-end, main-start, and main-end.

71
00:04:49.728 --> 00:04:53.168
So I want you to understand that
this is what I'm talking about,

72
00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:55.410
it's basically the main axis is a cross.

73
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.729
The cross axis is down,
except for if I declared column.

74
00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.402
Then the main axis would have been up and

75
00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:06.534
down, and the cross axis would
have been left-to-right.

76
00:05:06.534 --> 00:05:11.497
Okay, and
next we have a flex-wrap property.

77
00:05:11.497 --> 00:05:17.608
So the default is nowrap.

78
00:05:17.608 --> 00:05:23.498
You can also say wrap, and wrap-reverse.

79
00:05:23.498 --> 00:05:26.971
So the purpose of the flex-wrap property
is, should it all be on one line?

80
00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:29.180
Or can it wrap if necessary?

81
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.016
So here you can barely see it.

82
00:05:31.016 --> 00:05:35.816
But off to the right,
there's whatever starts

83
00:05:35.816 --> 00:05:40.265
with the letter n because
I displayed flex.

84
00:05:40.265 --> 00:05:46.288
I did flex-direction of row,
and I did flex-wrap of nowrap.

85
00:05:46.288 --> 00:05:51.101
I could also have just removed
that cuz that's the default.

86
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:57.240
If I just say wrap, it wrapped, right?

87
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.129
What wrap-reverse actually does
is it changes the cross axis

88
00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:07.307
from top-to-bottom, and
switches it from bottom-to-top.

89
00:06:32.172 --> 00:06:34.701
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's just do column

90
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:43.097
first, with nowrap.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Nowrap, right?

91
00:06:43.097 --> 00:06:46.776
And then I can do it, so it wraps.

92
00:06:46.776 --> 00:06:52.660
Okay so it started with A, and went B,
C, D, E, F, G, H, in order, right?

93
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.284
In the correct order,
from left-to-right, top-to-bottom.

94
00:06:55.284 --> 00:06:58.666
So the main axis, right now,
is top-to-bottom.

95
00:06:58.666 --> 00:07:02.513
The cross axis is right-to-left.

96
00:07:02.513 --> 00:07:11.108
If I change this to wrap-reverse,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: the cross axis has

97
00:07:11.108 --> 00:07:17.482
changed directions, and
it's going from right-to-left,

98
00:07:17.482 --> 00:07:22.903
instead of left-to-right,
does that make sense?

99
00:07:22.903 --> 00:07:27.259
Okay, so it seems really easy, and it is,

100
00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:32.952
because 99% of the time,
you just do row, and wrap.

101
00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:34.607
And you're golden, right?

102
00:07:34.607 --> 00:07:36.845
Except for, it looks really ugly.

103
00:07:36.845 --> 00:07:43.583
All I have to do is say flex 10%,
and I have 10, right?

104
00:07:43.583 --> 00:07:48.495
So it's gonna be easy.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You don't need to

105
00:07:48.495 --> 00:07:49.960
memorize any of this.

106
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.176
I look it up every time I use it,
well, not every time,

107
00:07:52.176 --> 00:07:54.602
cuz I've now memorized it since
I've written a book on it.

108
00:07:54.602 --> 00:07:57.964
But I assume you're not
gonna write a book on it,

109
00:07:57.964 --> 00:08:01.748
don't.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Cuz there's a little

110
00:08:01.748 --> 00:08:06.320
book of like, 120 pages just on flex,
and half of that is in here.

111
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.287
Half of it did not make it in
there because the minutia, poof!

112
00:08:11.287 --> 00:08:15.647
Okay, so 90% of the time,
this is what you gonna need.

113
00:08:15.647 --> 00:08:19.394
And so I'm gonna show you everything
because you need to know it's possible.

114
00:08:19.394 --> 00:08:23.091
But just realize that this
is what you wanna do.

115
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:26.505
Okay, so in this case of the kitties,

116
00:08:26.505 --> 00:08:31.109
that's what I did,
it's just wrapping, right?

117
00:08:31.109 --> 00:08:33.710
I wrapped it over multiple lines.

118
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:40.796
And I used a flex that allowed
it to shrink, and grow.

119
00:08:40.796 --> 00:08:46.015
Okay, so we covered flex-direction,
and flex-wrap.

120
00:08:46.015 --> 00:08:51.130
You really do actually wanna use
the flex-flow property which is

121
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:56.712
a shorthand for the both,
the flex-direction, and the flex-wrap.

122
00:08:56.712 --> 00:09:02.070
So here I could've just
done row-reverse wrap,

123
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:09.607
let me give it a height of 2,
oops, height, 400 pixels, right?

124
00:09:09.607 --> 00:09:16.120
And then I could have done column,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: column-reverse wrap,

125
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.792
right?

126
00:09:16.792 --> 00:09:19.358
A column-reverse, wrap-reverse.

127
00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:24.391
So it's the exact same thing, that way
you remember to do both properties.

128
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:29.226
And the people who wrote the spec,
really, really,

129
00:09:29.226 --> 00:09:32.676
really want you to use the shorthand.

130
00:09:32.676 --> 00:09:40.735
Notice one of the features because I
allowed them to grow, I did flex 10%.

131
00:09:40.735 --> 00:09:44.838
If I did 0, 0, then it would not grow.

132
00:09:44.838 --> 00:09:50.888
Okay, flex-flow, here's another one
if you wanna play with it just for

133
00:09:50.888 --> 00:09:53.926
30 seconds while I drink some water.

134
00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:55.182
And then we'll get back to it.
