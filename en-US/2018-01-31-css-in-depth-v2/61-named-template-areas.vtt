00:00:02.792 --> 00:00:04.350
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We tried it out.

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.030
So the thing is right now we've been using
numbers and those are super complicated.

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.190
Not really, but it's okay.

4
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.466
So grid template areas,

5
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.670
you asked me earlier if we were
gonna cover grid template areas.

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.860
And I was like, maybe and
look we're gonna cover it.

7
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.080
So another way to describe the grid is
to basically give it named areas to say,

8
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.800
here I said header, header, header,
nav article aside, footer, footer, footer.

9
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.080
So instead of saying one through four,
I basically said footer, footer, footer,

10
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.270
hair cross.

11
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.500
I basically made asciart out
of the areas of my page.

12
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.777
So that's how I define the grid.

13
00:00:48.777 --> 00:00:54.152
I've defined the grid as I want
the header, we're gonna have the magic

14
00:00:54.152 --> 00:01:00.880
layout or whatever the golden ratio
layout or whatever they want to call it.

15
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.650
It's gonna have the header up top,
it's gonna have the nav on the left,

16
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.490
the article in the middle,
and the side on the right.

17
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.890
And it's gonna have
the footer across the bottom.

18
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.400
So, basically I described it that way.

19
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.720
I said header,
header header cuz I have three columns.

20
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.086
In the middle area I have nav article
asid, and footer, footer, footer.

21
00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:26.211
But the browser still
doesn't know what goes where,

22
00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:29.764
I have to tell it that I want my
header to be in the header area.

23
00:01:29.764 --> 00:01:33.589
I want my nav to be in the nav area,

24
00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:38.782
I want my article to be
in the area allotted for

25
00:01:38.782 --> 00:01:43.761
article.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's just get rid

26
00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:48.386
of this right here.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,

27
00:01:48.386 --> 00:01:49.762
this page is not editable.

28
00:01:49.762 --> 00:01:54.461
But I put basically aside,
grid-area: aside, and

29
00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:58.250
then footer grid-area: footer.

30
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.170
So we can this take code and

31
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.550
actually paste it right
here aand nothing happened.

32
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.420
Anyone know why nothing happened?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The display grid?

33
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.100
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Exactly.

34
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.721
Okay, so display grid, but

35
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:22.077
still I haven't given it the locations.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

36
00:02:22.077 --> 00:02:26.760
here I'm just gonna do this, and
because I can't reach the whole thing I'm

37
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.990
gonna have to actually do
stuff with it afterwards.

38
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.339
So the header is all the way across,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The side

39
00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:43.266
grid area
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Aside,

40
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.532
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Footer (grid-area:,

41
00:02:54.085 --> 00:02:57.970
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: footer, and there it is.

42
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.940
Doesn't have a nice way out cuz I
haven't given the grid template

43
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:02.960
columns and rows yet.

44
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.982
But I just want to show you,

45
00:03:08.982 --> 00:03:13.476
I could also have done h,

46
00:03:13.476 --> 00:03:16.690
h, h, n a aside.

47
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.090
Oops, f f f, right?

48
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.092
And then I could have said, h, n,

49
00:03:27.092 --> 00:03:34.170
a, as and f and
we're back to the same thing.

50
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.230
So I gave him the name,

51
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.800
I just wanted to show you that the names
don't have to be header or footer, nav.

52
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.610
They can be anything, they can be foobar.

53
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.597
I used header, footer, and

54
00:03:43.597 --> 00:03:48.820
nav because that's what I actually, now
that we can use semantic elements in HTML.

55
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.100
That's natural way of doing it, but
is doesn't have to be that way.

56
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.236
So to make it better

57
00:03:58.236 --> 00:04:03.693
looking, we can add

58
00:04:03.693 --> 00:04:13.323
grid-template-rows:3em 1fr

59
00:04:18.223 --> 00:04:23.173
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 1em and then grid-

60
00:04:23.173 --> 00:04:28.710
template-columns.

61
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.937
Now for 200 pixels 1fr, and

62
00:04:34.937 --> 00:04:39.302
then 100 pixels.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

63
00:04:39.302 --> 00:04:41.390
that looks like a nice layout.

64
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.794
And the problem is,
why is that style in there like that?

65
00:04:48.794 --> 00:04:51.070
Anyone know?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The column?

66
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.860
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's in the column,

67
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.610
it's in that first column.

68
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.090
It went down to the next,
it's part of the grid.

69
00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.009
So I would actually have to do,
if I can see it,

70
00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.636
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: S, S, S and

71
00:05:10.636 --> 00:05:18.190
then you can't see what I'm writing,
but I can do a style.

72
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:26.040
Grid-area-style, okay,

73
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.290
so I have an error somewhere in my code
which is why it messed up like this.

74
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.250
S, what did I do wrong?

75
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.010
I forgot the quote, so
you do have to quote each line.

76
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.655
And each line is separate, but

77
00:05:43.655 --> 00:05:49.165
I could also do this, right?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: But

78
00:05:49.165 --> 00:05:53.587
that's hard to read and so the usual
way of doing it is to actually put

79
00:05:53.587 --> 00:05:57.555
everything like a little table,
so you can see everything.
