1
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.940
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so next we
have the background-repeat property.

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.520
So the default for
background-repeat is actually repeat.

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.363
And unfortunately, the contrast
looks really good on my screen.

4
00:00:14.363 --> 00:00:16.100
It doesn't look quite as good up there so

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:24.292
let me see if I actually do this.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: No,

6
00:00:24.292 --> 00:00:26.957
just changes my screen,
doesn't change anyone else's, okay,

7
00:00:26.957 --> 00:00:32.930
oops.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Am I not in control?

8
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.830
Okay, okay.

9
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.480
So sorry about the contrast
not being that strong, but

10
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.100
we have repeat which repeats it.

11
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.790
And let's just show you, repeat.

12
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.410
Who would ever want to do
that to their website?

13
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.638
It depends on your image actually, right?

14
00:00:48.638 --> 00:00:52.900
No-repeat is what I'd originally
put there and it did not repeat so

15
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.310
the circle's in the upper
right hand corner.

16
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.484
Repeat-x repeats along the x axis,

17
00:00:59.484 --> 00:01:04.360
repeat-y repeats it along the y axis.

18
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.050
This is probably not new to anyone.

19
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.100
But these two values have been around,
which is space.

20
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.701
Now the difference between space and
repeat and

21
00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:22.008
I'll show you space again.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Notice

22
00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:24.230
space has no cut off background images.

23
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.990
It added space between all the images and
cut off the one that was halfway cut off.

24
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.470
So I'm just gonna show
that to you one more time.

25
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.910
Repeat, you see there's more here
than there were when I did space.

26
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.600
So here if I actually had a background
of black on the page and I repeated

27
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.240
this image, which if it had a white
background then the white would show.

28
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.250
And that's not really nice,
that might not be what you want.

29
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.260
So there's a solution for
that, which is around.

30
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.050
And here they actually changed
the size of the image so

31
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.978
that it takes up all the space.

32
00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:08.748
So it's also just like repeat,
just like space, there's none cut off but

33
00:02:08.748 --> 00:02:14.124
the first one, space, put space between
the background images and this one changes

34
00:02:14.124 --> 00:02:19.322
the size of the background image
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

35
00:02:19.322 --> 00:02:23.870
just so we can read the whole deck,
I'm gonna go back to no-repeat.

36
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.900
And here you can see what it says,
repeated as often as will fit

37
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.400
without being clipped then scaled so
no space is in between.

38
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.880
Where space is repeated as often
as will fit without being clipped,

39
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.820
spaced out evenly.

40
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.320
Next we have
the background-attachment property.

41
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.470
And I think this slide deck doesn't work.

42
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.349
We have fixed, local, and scroll.

43
00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.333
So usually when you have
a background image on

44
00:02:55.333 --> 00:03:00.438
an element,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If you saw here,

45
00:03:00.438 --> 00:03:06.566
with this, right, if I actually
scroll down the page, that image,

46
00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:12.390
it depends if the div was scrolling or
if I was scrolling the page.

47
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.460
If I was scrolling the page,
the background image would just go

48
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.020
off the page, but
if I was scrolling just within a section,

49
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.198
that background image
would stay where it was.

50
00:03:22.198 --> 00:03:26.052
So here,

51
00:03:26.052 --> 00:03:30.540
if I do fixed, it's actually

52
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.670
fixed in a location that happens to
not be behind this box right here.

53
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.799
So it's fixed, oops!

54
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.626
It's fixed, but not in a visible location.

55
00:03:44.626 --> 00:03:50.975
Here, if I do local,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's

56
00:03:50.975 --> 00:03:55.700
here and it moves with it.

57
00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.124
And then If I do scroll,

58
00:04:00.124 --> 00:04:05.664
it stays exactly where it is.

59
00:04:05.664 --> 00:04:06.590
So that's that property.

60
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.602
Now we have background-position.

61
00:04:10.602 --> 00:04:14.081
So everyone thinks they know
background-position, but there's something

62
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:17.410
quirky about background-position
that most people don't think about.

63
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.980
So the reason that there's
a four grid box there

64
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.800
is to show you where the image
is actually ending up.

65
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.900
Right now it says
background-position 75% 75%.

66
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.000
That means this mark right here,

67
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.660
which is a 75th percent of my square,
right, this is the background image?

68
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.370
And this is a 75th percent mark of that.

69
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.400
It's three quarters of
the way down from the top and

70
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.810
three quarters of the way from
the left and it is positioned exactly

71
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.270
three quarters of the way across and
three quarters of the way down.

72
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.651
So if you were to say 50 50,

73
00:05:08.334 --> 00:05:09.794
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This box is positioned,

74
00:05:09.794 --> 00:05:14.010
the middle of this box is
positioned at the 50% mark.

75
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:22.818
If you were to say 25%,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 25%,

76
00:05:22.818 --> 00:05:28.220
it is this spot in this image
that is positioned there.

77
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.717
And so if this doesn't make sense,

78
00:05:31.717 --> 00:05:37.000
let me just switch it over to 0 and
0 and 0 and 0.

79
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.500
So it is the 0% mark of that image
that is in the upper left hand corner.

80
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.203
Because if I change it to 100%,

81
00:05:44.203 --> 00:05:50.502
right?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It

82
00:05:50.502 --> 00:05:53.511
is the 100% mark of that background image.

83
00:05:53.511 --> 00:06:00.820
So usually, if it's 500 pixels wide,
let's say this div was 500 pixels wide.

84
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.374
If I said background-position 500 pixels,
it would be off the page.

85
00:06:05.374 --> 00:06:09.297
But in percentages,
what it does is it takes your image,

86
00:06:09.297 --> 00:06:14.228
finds the percentage marks in that image,
and places that at that dot.

87
00:06:14.228 --> 00:06:20.331
And that is why the 100% mark right
now of that image is in the 100% mark.

88
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:21.488
And if I do 90%,

89
00:06:31.427 --> 00:06:36.475
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So you see basically I'm
putting the green dot at the 90% part

90
00:06:36.475 --> 00:06:42.940
of the parent which also happens to
be 90% mark of the background image.

91
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.490
Is that making sense?

92
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.240
And is that actually something
that's new to people?

93
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.675
Kinda never thought of it before, maybe.

94
00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:51.819
Maybe some of you have, okay.

95
00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:56.006
So what we also have that's not that
commonly known is that you can position

96
00:06:56.006 --> 00:06:59.080
your background image
relative to any corner.

97
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.640
So most people think it can only position
relative from the top left corner.

98
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.550
But you can actually say make
this 50 pixels from the right and

99
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.400
50 pixels from the bottom.

100
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.400
And that's why it's here.

101
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.489
So if I do 150 pixels from the right.

102
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.770
This is not an interactive slide,
sorry, the next one is.

103
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:25.350
150 pixels from the right and
150 pixels from the bottom.

104
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.090
So you can use left and
right and top and bottom.

105
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.750
And let's just go back to that rectangle
because I've never done this before.

106
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:46.890
If I say background-position,

107
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.960
bottom, oops,

108
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:57.797
right,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

109
00:07:57.797 --> 00:08:02.331
it's the 90th percent mark from the bottom
right that's being positioned at

110
00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:07.614
the bottom right part.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's just see left.

111
00:08:15.419 --> 00:08:16.430
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yep, nope, well,

112
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.910
my little thing doesn't actually show.

113
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.584
That doesn't work right,
but we'll leave it.

114
00:08:20.584 --> 00:08:22.324
You get the idea.

115
00:08:22.324 --> 00:08:24.790
Okay, so
that's a 4-value background-position.
