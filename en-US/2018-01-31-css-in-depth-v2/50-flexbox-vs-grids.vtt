00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.650
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So with grids,

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.960
let's start talk come a little bit about
flex box before we go on with grids.

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:17.110
So grids, flex box is when you want to
do basically two dimensional lay-out.

4
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.786
Which is you just add an element
just go to cross the line.

5
00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:26.250
So here I have a bunch of cells, and
they're laid out really nicely, right?

6
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.300
This looks like a grid.

7
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.520
This is done in Flexbox.

8
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.510
As you can see it says display flex,
flex flow, row, and

9
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.470
wrap, so
that's why number four is wrapping.

10
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.960
I'm basically giving it
a flex basis of 250 pixels.

11
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.240
So it's 250 pixels but
it can grow if the page needs to grow.

12
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.120
So these are not actually
exactly 250 pixels wide.

13
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.380
They're probably 300 pixels wide.

14
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.580
I put a margin of 10 pixels because
it looks like a nice little gutter in

15
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.290
between all of them.

16
00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.760
But then if I change the last-of-type
number 12 to display none,

17
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.710
look what happens.

18
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.850
Because this is a very simple thing,
it actually doesn't look that bad but

19
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.870
generally, you want them
to lay out correctly.

20
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.890
If you remember from our flex box
examples with the kittens yesterday,

21
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.680
I used to hack to make
them all line up nicely.

22
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.300
So even if there wasn't the same
number of kittens on the bottom row,

23
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.460
it's still lined up
with the rows above it.

24
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.490
Generally people what this,
the gutters to line up really nicely.

25
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:41.298
It looks even worse if you
do nth last of type, and

26
00:01:41.298 --> 00:01:50.520
then li:nth-of-type(11).

27
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.405
And that might actually be nice in your
layout, but if that had just a little

28
00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:58.548
picture of a kitten on the side, and
it grew that big, it would be ugly, right?

29
00:02:00.683 --> 00:02:02.660
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Or
you'd have that huge kitten on the bottom.

30
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.850
So Grid allows us to actually
get rid of that last item.

31
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.710
If you look at number 12
down at the bottom, and

32
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.920
I display none,
the lines still match up nicely, right?

33
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.642
And if I do li:n,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Of

34
00:02:26.642 --> 00:02:31.807
type 11,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It

35
00:02:31.807 --> 00:02:33.310
also still lines up nicely.

36
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.100
There is a few other things a grid can do.

37
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.154
In this case I actually said I want
number four to span two columns.

38
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.812
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: In this example here,
I have a test grid,

39
00:02:52.812 --> 00:02:57.130
which you can see is number 4,
cuz it goes from 3 to 5.

40
00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.290
So I moved it, I brought it down here.

41
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.960
I said, I wanted to

42
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.970
the grid column to start in the second
column and go all the way to the eighth.

43
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.040
And I want the grid row to start from
the third and go all the way to the fifth.

44
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.030
So it would take up 2 rows and 6 columns.

45
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.962
I could have said 5 and 1.

46
00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:26.760
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That was
a lot of hard work for

47
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.710
me to re-code that layout now wasn't it?

48
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.210
That is one of the powers of grid.

49
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.530
Grid is actually much more
powerful than that but

50
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.750
what we're gonna do today is we're
gonna cover grid in short form.

51
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.990
Because there's another CSS mastery class
where they spend a full day talking

52
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.740
about grid and flex box.

53
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.960
So I am not going to go
into it as deep detail.

54
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.670
If you really want to learn the grid
super well, take that workshop.

55
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.620
But we are going to cover the basics so

56
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.719
that you're able to read up on it more and
you're able to play with it.

57
00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:59.196
And then when you're ready to deep dive
and really learn all of the features,

58
00:03:59.196 --> 00:04:01.724
you'll have a general
understanding of the features.
