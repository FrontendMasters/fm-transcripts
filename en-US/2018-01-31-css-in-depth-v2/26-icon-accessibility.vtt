00:00:01.754 --> 00:00:03.246
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The thing
with a lot of icons,

2
00:00:03.246 --> 00:00:05.347
this is kind of one of the other features.

3
00:00:05.347 --> 00:00:07.989
And I thought this was the best
place to talk about it,

4
00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:11.655
cuz using this to generate a content
is actually a really good way to do it.

5
00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:15.524
So there's a lot of icons that
are completely not accessible.

6
00:00:15.524 --> 00:00:19.426
So if I put this snowman,
remember that snowman 2603?

7
00:00:19.426 --> 00:00:23.460
It doesn't say snowman when you're
using assistive technology.

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.040
So Google came out with
these material icons.

9
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:32.807
And you can tell that Google does not hire
enough diversity because there's one,

10
00:00:32.807 --> 00:00:37.037
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

11
00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:44.470
Eight airplane seats in the material
icons and no pregnant women.

12
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.904
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I don't know.

13
00:00:49.205 --> 00:00:51.491
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, they need a little
bit more diversity at Google, but

14
00:00:51.491 --> 00:00:54.476
they're never gonna get it while they
still have the same hiring practices.

15
00:00:54.476 --> 00:00:56.428
That was another opinionated comment.

16
00:00:56.428 --> 00:00:57.895
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

17
00:00:57.895 --> 00:01:00.295
what is material icons?

18
00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:06.180
If I actually were to do
a View Source &gt; Inspect on this,

19
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.199
I would see a bunch of words.

20
00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:13.499
And so it would be airplane_seat_flat,
airplane_seat_angled,

21
00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:16.015
airplane_seat_individual_suite.

22
00:01:16.015 --> 00:01:20.610
Because who here has ever been able to
get an individual suite on a plane?

23
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.898
This is not a material icon
that I ever need to use.

24
00:01:23.898 --> 00:01:27.987
Extra leg room, I pay still for
that, legroom_normal,

25
00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:30.416
legroom_reduced, that's me.

26
00:01:30.416 --> 00:01:33.617
Seat recline, that's the person in
front of you that you want to punch.

27
00:01:33.617 --> 00:01:36.256
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay so, these are words,

28
00:01:36.256 --> 00:01:39.592
this the screen reader will read, right?

29
00:01:39.592 --> 00:01:41.294
So what they did is they used ligatures.

30
00:01:41.294 --> 00:01:46.981
Have you ever seen an F with an I, and the
outside of the F goes to the top of the I?

31
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:48.064
That's a ligature.

32
00:01:48.064 --> 00:01:52.805
So basically they use ligatures
to say basically when you have

33
00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:57.374
the word airplane suite,
which one's a suite, this one?

34
00:01:59.587 --> 00:02:04.143
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That is so
not worth $10,000 for one night.

35
00:02:04.143 --> 00:02:10.779
So basically what I did here is I
have a class of material-icons.

36
00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:15.626
And it starts with material-icons,
so I can just add a dash and

37
00:02:15.626 --> 00:02:17.919
something else afterwards.

38
00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:21.800
Margins, I'm using material,
icons, font, and

39
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.783
then I have antialiased and
future settings of liga.

40
00:02:25.783 --> 00:02:30.115
So I'm not gonna cover fonts in-depth.

41
00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:33.686
But just realize that these
are properties, like antialiased and

42
00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:37.013
there's font feature settings
that you can use, like liga.

43
00:02:37.013 --> 00:02:38.667
So this is something you wanna look up.

44
00:02:38.667 --> 00:02:43.861
And then, with the generated content,
actually here I'm not

45
00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:49.062
even using generated content,
I'm just using the word face.

46
00:02:49.062 --> 00:02:53.881
So saying, when I have this font,
the ligature of f, a, c,

47
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:56.179
and e combined produces this.

48
00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:03.268
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So here, it's generated
content, here I have the black one is

49
00:03:03.268 --> 00:03:07.167
material-icons, and
the word is accessibility.

50
00:03:07.167 --> 00:03:12.561
And I have accessibility Icon, so the
screen reader would read accessibility.

51
00:03:12.561 --> 00:03:19.083
The sighted user would
actually see the icon.

52
00:03:19.083 --> 00:03:21.232
And you generally don't
actually wanna do this,

53
00:03:21.232 --> 00:03:23.953
because a lot of people don't
understand what the icon means.

54
00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:30.712
So a sighted user might not know that
this means accessibility, right?

55
00:03:30.712 --> 00:03:33.400
But if I change this,
just to show you that it works, a face.

56
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.189
You see, I typed in face,
and we get a face.

57
00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:40.489
So there's a thousand of
these that you can use.

58
00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.082
You just have to call in
the material icons font.

59
00:03:47.434 --> 00:03:51.085
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So this is one thing
you can use with generated content.

60
00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:57.114
The other interesting thing is,
there's also UTF for

61
00:03:57.114 --> 00:04:02.227
browsers that don't support ligatures, and

62
00:04:02.227 --> 00:04:08.665
those font features,
you can actually use the /e84e.

63
00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:12.289
The only thing is, if I do this in
a browser that doesn't support it,

64
00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:13.109
what happens?

65
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.289
If this browser doesn't
support the ligature of face,

66
00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.725
what would be written on the bottom?

67
00:04:20.725 --> 00:04:28.247
The word face because
the cascade overwrote the /e84e,

68
00:04:28.247 --> 00:04:33.217
so it would actually say the word face.

69
00:04:33.217 --> 00:04:38.429
So later on we're going to discuss
how you can actually feature

70
00:04:38.429 --> 00:04:44.740
detect whether the browser supports
this feature, which is needed right?

71
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.668
And then you can, in that support

72
00:04:50.668 --> 00:04:56.127
query you can just put that feature.

73
00:04:56.127 --> 00:04:59.347
Okay, so accessibility.

74
00:05:01.054 --> 00:05:03.810
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, accessibility.

75
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.856
I've just been talking a lot
about accessibility but

76
00:05:06.856 --> 00:05:08.962
let's go over the actual features.

77
00:05:08.962 --> 00:05:14.168
Generated [COUGH] content is actually
read by most screen readers.

78
00:05:14.168 --> 00:05:17.809
But it should enhance the content,
it's progressive enhancement.

79
00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:21.266
It should not be the base of your,
it should not be relied upon.

80
00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:26.561
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Because basically
generated content is part of

81
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:30.291
the presentation layer,
and content is HTML, and

82
00:05:30.291 --> 00:05:33.343
you don't want to mix those concerns up.

83
00:05:33.343 --> 00:05:36.805
And I'm not just saying you don't wanna
mix it up, and that's a steadfast rule and

84
00:05:36.805 --> 00:05:37.410
that's why.

85
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.636
But this is just one of the examples of,

86
00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:43.419
you want the content to actually
be on the page if it's important.

87
00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:47.979
So you can use these features if you
want to improve user experience, but

88
00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.141
don't make it a requirement
of user experience.

89
00:05:53.425 --> 00:05:57.804
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If you're
really into accessibility,

90
00:05:57.804 --> 00:06:05.155
the generated content is part of
the accessible name computation.

91
00:06:05.155 --> 00:06:08.761
There's an accessibility object model, and

92
00:06:08.761 --> 00:06:13.111
it is actually going to be in
there if it's not already.

93
00:06:13.111 --> 00:06:18.090
And all browsers, except for Internet
Explorer, expose generated content,

94
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.818
expose it, and therefore,
can be read by the screen user.

95
00:06:23.812 --> 00:06:28.060
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So in the future,

96
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.986
right now,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Right now we

97
00:06:32.986 --> 00:06:33.967
just have content, right?

98
00:06:33.967 --> 00:06:39.761
We just say content: url(question.svg),
right?

99
00:06:39.761 --> 00:06:43.086
In the future,
we'll be able to put a slash, and

100
00:06:43.086 --> 00:06:45.614
basically a hint as to what it means.

101
00:06:45.614 --> 00:06:50.384
Because those icons that I was talking to
you about, that face, the sighted user,

102
00:06:50.384 --> 00:06:53.261
it's like,
I have no clue why that face is there.

103
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:59.981
And that bed line in, I had no clue
that that was an airplane suite,

104
00:06:59.981 --> 00:07:03.952
because it's not in my daily lexicon.

105
00:07:03.952 --> 00:07:07.366
If something is gonna be
purely decorative, like 25BA,

106
00:07:07.366 --> 00:07:08.947
I have no clue with 25BA.

107
00:07:08.947 --> 00:07:13.080
But like with the snowman, purely
decorative, does not add to the content or

108
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.659
context.

109
00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:15.911
You can just put slash and
then empty quotes, so

110
00:07:15.911 --> 00:07:18.004
that it won't be read
to the screen reader.

111
00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:20.745
So this is providing more information,

112
00:07:20.745 --> 00:07:25.674
because there is no way to put an ALT
attribute on the generated content.

113
00:07:25.674 --> 00:07:27.619
I've had that picture of myself.

114
00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:31.680
No screen reader user would know
that that was a picture of me.

115
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.937
But I could write GC SVG on the style, and

116
00:07:33.937 --> 00:07:37.404
then they would know what they
were supposed to be looking at.
