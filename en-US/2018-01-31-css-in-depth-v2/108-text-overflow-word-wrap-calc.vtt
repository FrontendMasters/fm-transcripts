00:00:01.977 --> 00:00:04.762
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Then we have
text overflow ellipsis.

2
00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:12.170
So,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: That's

3
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.820
weird the background color
totally disappeared.

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.809
So here I have three paragraphs.

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.755
And they have various
number of properties,

6
00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:25.980
there's text-overflow ellipsis,
white-space nowrap and overflow-hidden.

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.832
You need to have overflow-hidden and
white-space nowrap, and

8
00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:32.290
text-overflow ellipsis for it to work.

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.490
If you don't have ellipsis they won't work
obviously, but if it's allowed to wrap.

10
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.720
If this was actually working as the slide
was intended the first one actually wraps.

11
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.084
But between this morning when I checked
it and now it just disappeared.

12
00:00:50.084 --> 00:00:53.034
Because live coding.

13
00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:59.200
Okay, then we have wrap word wrap, which
basically says can you break words or not?

14
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.880
But we learned hyphenation,
hyphenation is much better than word wrap.

15
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.810
So I would actually go
with hyphenation instead.

16
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.210
Then we have calc() which is, we're able
to use for properties, for values rather.

17
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.930
You can use calculations and
use plus, minus, multiply,

18
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.040
divide, min and
max operators within the calculations,

19
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.700
so you can basically say 50%- 40 pixels.

20
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.540
So if you have basically,
you know you have padding on each side and

21
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.900
you want to be half than you
do 50%- 80 for the 80 pixels.

22
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.410
And it will actually calculate it for you.

23
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.775
And it's very well supported
now in most browsers.
