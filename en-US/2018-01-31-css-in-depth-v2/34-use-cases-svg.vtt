00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:06.491
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
another reason to use media queries, or

2
00:00:06.491 --> 00:00:09.545
interesting thing about
media queries is SVG.

3
00:00:09.545 --> 00:00:15.979
Generally, when you say width screen and
width, the width is the device width,

4
00:00:15.979 --> 00:00:20.898
if you're on a mobile device or
tablet and the browser width,

5
00:00:20.898 --> 00:00:26.591
if you're on a device where you can
just change the size of the browser.

6
00:00:26.591 --> 00:00:31.998
When it comes to an SVG,
the screen is actually

7
00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:36.443
the width of the container of the SVG.

8
00:00:36.443 --> 00:00:39.226
So if I hit play with this and

9
00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:44.074
right now the background,
I have a circle SVG.

10
00:00:44.074 --> 00:00:48.954
And,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If I say background

11
00:00:48.954 --> 00:00:50.633
is 50%, it changed colors.

12
00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:56.826
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And 20%,
it changed colors again.

13
00:00:56.826 --> 00:01:00.870
Because it's the size
of the SVG container.

14
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.240
And the SVG container is 20%
of the width of the parents.

15
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.547
And so it's basically saying if the parent
were a thousand pixels, which I

16
00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:11.490
know is more, but I'm just going to use
a thousand because then I can do math.

17
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.600
So if it was a thousand pixels wide that
would mean when it's 200 pixels wide,

18
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.680
it should be green.

19
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.301
When it's 300 pixels
wide it should be blue.

20
00:01:23.301 --> 00:01:29.442
When it's 400 pixels wide it
should be whatever color that is,

21
00:01:29.442 --> 00:01:35.264
whatever color that is,
whatever color that is, and orange.

22
00:01:35.264 --> 00:01:37.504
And 9 and 100, okay.

23
00:01:37.504 --> 00:01:43.607
So let's take a look

24
00:01:43.607 --> 00:01:48.992
at circle.svg.

25
00:02:00.293 --> 00:02:02.874
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,
and then do a View Source.

26
00:02:07.617 --> 00:02:12.137
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So here,
I basically said if it's under 100 pixels,

27
00:02:12.137 --> 00:02:14.216
make the color bada55.

28
00:02:14.216 --> 00:02:20.818
If it's under 300 pixels, I did 300 pixels
twice, this was supposed to be 200 pixels.

29
00:02:20.818 --> 00:02:24.970
500, sho he's had these
different breakpoints and

30
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.660
they're not breakpoints decided
on any tablet that I know of.

31
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:37.464
It's just breakpoints that I
picked because it made sense,

32
00:02:37.464 --> 00:02:42.702
and then a
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It basically

33
00:02:42.702 --> 00:02:48.470
says the width and the height of
this SVG is by default 400 pixels.

34
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.640
But that's not what my HTML is saying.

35
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.370
My HTML is saying make it 70%.

36
00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.020
So basically I'm saying the background
size is the container of that SVG.

37
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.575
And I'm making it 70% of the width.

38
00:03:01.575 --> 00:03:04.620
60% of the width, 100% of the width.

39
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.193
So it's not taking the size of the screen,

40
00:03:08.193 --> 00:03:14.345
which is what 99.9% of the time
happens when it's in SVG, the size,

41
00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:20.618
or the min width and the max width is
actually the size of the SVG container.
