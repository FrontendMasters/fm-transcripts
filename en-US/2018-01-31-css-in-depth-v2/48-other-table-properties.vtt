00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:03.980
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Other table properties.

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:12.526
You can actually hide empty cells.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

3
00:00:12.526 --> 00:00:19.680
you can say basically, empty-cell: show,
which is the default, or empty-cell: hide.

4
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.650
And empty-cell hide, do you remember when
we were doing the empty pseudo class?

5
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.529
Kind of the same thing.

6
00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:35.480
If you have absolutely nothing in there,
that would be the other way of doing it.

7
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.530
That's ignored if
border-collapse is separate.

8
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.776
So if you have space
between those border cells,

9
00:00:41.776 --> 00:00:47.111
it's still going to stay there.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

10
00:00:47.111 --> 00:00:50.315
it applies to other elements with
the display of table-cell even if it's

11
00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:54.859
not part of a table.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

12
00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.845
here we have,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We can put it on

13
00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:00.710
the table or on the cell itself.

14
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.441
So here,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The table,

15
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:11.620
there's no border.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If I defaulted

16
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.346
back to show, it's there,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Right?

17
00:01:17.896 --> 00:01:19.250
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then if I just do

18
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.510
instead on the td, so you see I could
put it on the td itself or on the table.

19
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.602
So that is empty-cell hide.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Then

20
00:01:33.602 --> 00:01:36.350
there's table-layout of auto or fixed.

21
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.320
And I'm not gonna show an example of
this one cuz the only thing it really

22
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.630
does is it paints faster.

23
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.023
Because if you say it's fixed,

24
00:01:44.023 --> 00:01:49.216
then it knows exactly what width it is.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That's

25
00:01:49.216 --> 00:01:53.920
if you declared the width and
you want a table to be fixed.

26
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.700
Generally, I like it to default or auto.

27
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.790
I've never used this, so
I can't tell you exactly what it does.

28
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.650
I just want to make
sure that I include it.

29
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.893
Then we can vertically align.

30
00:02:03.893 --> 00:02:06.596
Yes, you could always
vertically align in CSS, and

31
00:02:06.596 --> 00:02:10.170
that's why people used to display
table and table cell all the time.

32
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.617
So you can use baseline, sub,
super, text-top, text-bottom,

33
00:02:14.617 --> 00:02:17.835
middle, top, bottom, or
give it a percentage or

34
00:02:17.835 --> 00:02:26.514
length
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

35
00:02:26.514 --> 00:02:28.730
let's just do it here.

36
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.430
So vertical line top.

37
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.936
So I put extra spacing and extra text in
these, I increased the font size here so

38
00:02:36.936 --> 00:02:41.405
that we could just show.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: For

39
00:02:41.405 --> 00:02:45.360
vertical align bottom,
ooh, that's exciting.

40
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.229
You'll see here that Jade Boho,

41
00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:53.466
soccer player from Madrid.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

42
00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:57.760
then this bigger one here.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I've never tried

43
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.102
baseline, let's see if baseline works.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So here baseline,

44
00:03:04.102 --> 00:03:09.170
you see how it's not quite at the top in
this row because the 2G is really big.

45
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.880
So I'm actually able to align in
a table based on a larger font.

46
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.965
If one of them had had padding
in the top that was much bigger,

47
00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.640
then the baseline would've
been pushed down further.

48
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.830
Does that make sense?

49
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.775
Okay,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So, [COUGH] we talked

50
00:03:26.775 --> 00:03:31.669
about the display property yesterday
when we were talking about flexbox,

51
00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:36.060
and we introduced display flex and
display inline flex.

52
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.237
There's many other displays that I showed,
and the ones that are associated with

53
00:03:40.237 --> 00:03:45.820
tables but can be used on other elements
as well include table and table cell.

54
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.540
Table row group, table header group,
table footer group, table row, table cell,

55
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.300
table column group,
table column and table caption.
