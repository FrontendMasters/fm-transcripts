00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.157
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So let's create some
effects on slide number 3 again,

2
00:00:05.157 --> 00:00:07.256
which is actually slide number 21.

3
00:00:07.256 --> 00:00:11.213
&gt;&gt; Group: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So show me is

4
00:00:11.213 --> 00:00:16.808
the name of me, there I am.

5
00:00:19.554 --> 00:00:24.950
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This an SVG I created for
a conference that I'm organizing.

6
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.417
And so it says, showMe:hover::after,
position:absolute.

7
00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:34.535
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Does not work.

8
00:00:37.074 --> 00:00:38.567
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Does anyone
know why it doesn't work?

9
00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.993
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It is basically

10
00:00:43.993 --> 00:00:44.975
the attribute,

11
00:00:44.975 --> 00:00:49.265
the data URL, it's just presented
as text and it's not interpolated.

12
00:00:53.124 --> 00:00:56.030
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
it's basically saying url and

13
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.672
the URL is actually attr(data-url).

14
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.420
If I did this as well, it would not work.

15
00:01:06.884 --> 00:01:09.960
And let's just double check that
by going like this and hovering.

16
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.227
It just shows estelle.svg.

17
00:01:13.227 --> 00:01:18.625
All right, cuz it's showing this,
the data-url, not the actual URL.

18
00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:23.495
And if I do url,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It'd be

19
00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:24.449
really weird if it did work.

20
00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:27.730
It does absolutely nothing
because it has no clue,

21
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.750
it's just that image doesn't exist.

22
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.436
There's no image called attr bracket
because you notice URLs don't need to be

23
00:01:35.436 --> 00:01:36.155
in quotes.

24
00:01:37.532 --> 00:01:38.651
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
it's basically doing this.

25
00:01:38.651 --> 00:01:40.361
It's searching for this URL.

26
00:01:41.964 --> 00:01:43.869
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
there's no image with that URL.

27
00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.947
Does that make sense?

28
00:01:45.947 --> 00:01:51.281
So if I remove this content and
says url(estelle.svg),

29
00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:55.890
SVG is a completely valid image format so
it shows.

30
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.067
If this had been JPEG,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And I had, or

31
00:02:02.067 --> 00:02:09.046
JPG, and I had an image with the URL
of estelle.jpg, which I don't,

32
00:02:09.046 --> 00:02:14.390
it would work, but
it does not translate this stuff.

33
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.990
It's as if it was quoted.

34
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.960
Right, cuz it's basically saying URL and

35
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.840
whatever is in the URL is
supposed to be an image URL.

36
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.956
So that's what I wanted to show there and
then it's at terrible positioning.

37
00:02:25.956 --> 00:02:32.640
So I would actually do left of,
I'd say 15ms.

38
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.950
And then let's go back to SVG,
and then, there we are!

39
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.650
Okay, there I am.

40
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.160
Okay, yeah, so
I was organizing a conference, and

41
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.320
so I made SVG's of
the first five speakers.

42
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.480
And then the sixth speaker, so every time

43
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.370
you make an SVG of someone,
cuz this is the extent of my skills.

44
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.800
Which is you just find two
attributes that the person has that

45
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.310
can kind of make it
generally recognizable.

46
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.900
It's the fact that I
have a huge pony tail,

47
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.890
I just got my hair cut two weeks ago and
I hadn't gotten it cut in two years.

48
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.165
So it's like this big mop behind my head.

49
00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:21.742
And I have almost no forehead,
so I did that little drop and so

50
00:03:21.742 --> 00:03:23.504
that's why it looks like me.

51
00:03:23.504 --> 00:03:25.773
So everyone I did had
this characteristic so

52
00:03:25.773 --> 00:03:28.870
you can kind of say, I know who that is.

53
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.500
And I had one speaker and it was just,
a short white guy with a beard, and

54
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.660
I'm like he doesn't always
wear the same shirt.

55
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.520
I had one white guy and
he always wear blue checkered shirts, and

56
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.145
he has big blue eyes.

57
00:03:44.145 --> 00:03:48.277
So it's blue eyes and the checkered shirt,

58
00:03:48.277 --> 00:03:52.753
you knew it was him but
just you can't do short.

59
00:03:52.753 --> 00:03:55.814
So anyway, I couldn't invite
any more speakers until I

60
00:03:55.814 --> 00:03:56.602
figured out-

61
00:03:56.602 --> 00:03:58.934
&gt;&gt; Group: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: How to take

62
00:03:58.934 --> 00:03:59.586
care of the issue.

63
00:03:59.586 --> 00:04:05.298
So we have switched to images now, okay.
