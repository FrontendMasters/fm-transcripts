00:00:02.622 --> 00:00:05.840
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So display property,
we show it to you again.

2
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.120
So yesterday we discussed flex and
inline-flex.

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.670
Earlier today we did table row and
all the table ones, which accounts for

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.370
almost everything here.

5
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.149
And now we're going to cover grid and
inline-grid.

6
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.950
So, here I just have 12 spans,
told them to be pink.

7
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.900
And they're in line because they're spans.

8
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.290
If I say display grid, there we go.

9
00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:38.336
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Because I did not
define the width of any of those.

10
00:00:38.336 --> 00:00:41.756
So, each one of those,
1 through 12 became a grid item.

11
00:00:44.976 --> 00:00:49.847
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If I did inline-grid,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's

12
00:00:49.847 --> 00:00:52.130
just the width it needs to be.

13
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.580
But I didn't actually tell
it how wide to make it, so

14
00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.210
it made each one as narrow as it needed to
be, basically width auto of the content.

15
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.620
So let's make this look better.

16
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.610
Let's actually make it on one line or
two lines.

17
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.333
So here I have an unordered list.

18
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:16.305
And then if I display grid, it did
absolutely nothing because those are block

19
00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:18.760
level elements, so
it's gonna look the same.

20
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.690
I need the property of
grid template columns

21
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.590
to say how wide I want the columns.

22
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.940
And basically what I said right here is,
I want four columns and

23
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.110
then I want them each to be one fr unit.

24
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.340
An fr unit is a relative unit.

25
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.210
It's basically take the free space and

26
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.020
give this grid item one
unit of that free space.

27
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.060
And then it figures out how many units
total you have, takes the free space and

28
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.360
it divides it among all the units.

29
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.535
So let's take this line right here,
and move it back to this one, right?

30
00:02:09.736 --> 00:02:12.070
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
you can have a grid that way.

31
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.580
So before, because I did not
have grid template column,

32
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.460
it just assumed I wanted
one cell on each row.

33
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.480
I have to explicitly tell it
that I want more than one.

34
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.070
And I use this thing called repeat.

35
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.510
It basically says repeat
four times 1fr unit.

36
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:39.127
I could have also written 1fr,
1fr, 1fr, 1fr.

37
00:02:39.127 --> 00:02:41.357
And that's the exact same thing.

38
00:02:41.357 --> 00:02:45.997
Or I could have mixed the units and

39
00:02:45.997 --> 00:02:48.984
said 200 pixels.

40
00:02:48.984 --> 00:02:50.707
Let me make that 400 pixels.

41
00:02:50.707 --> 00:02:51.660
So, you can actually see a difference.

42
00:02:54.838 --> 00:03:00.668
Okay, and then the other thing I want
to do, on this one, is list style none.

43
00:03:00.668 --> 00:03:02.060
So that way it's not ugly.

44
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.770
So even though it's
displayed as a grid item,

45
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.164
it doesn't lose the fact
that it's a list item.

46
00:03:12.216 --> 00:03:15.060
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It just
doesn't display it as a block.

47
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.520
It gridify's it.

48
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.177
But it doesn't, you actually have to tell
it that it shouldn't have a list style.
