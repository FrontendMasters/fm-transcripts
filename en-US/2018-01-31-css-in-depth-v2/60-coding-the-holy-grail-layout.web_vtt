00:00:04.462 --> 00:00:05.494
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's try it out.

2
00:00:10.624 --> 00:00:16.385
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This one has three
articles, one, two, and three.

3
00:00:16.385 --> 00:00:19.885
So we are gonna open
it up in a new window.

4
00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:22.088
I opened it up in the same window.

5
00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:26.176
Well
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And let's play with it,

6
00:00:26.176 --> 00:00:29.755
so I want you to play with it,
and I will play with it as well.

7
00:00:29.755 --> 00:00:35.804
But I'm gonna go back here and then I'm
gonna hit, you can also hit try it out and

8
00:00:35.804 --> 00:00:41.877
hit control and then open link in a new
a window, so that you can actually cheat.

9
00:00:41.877 --> 00:00:44.065
Hold it here, and
go back here if you need to.

10
00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:53.195
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So what do we need to do?

11
00:00:56.514 --> 00:00:58.086
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Display grid.

12
00:00:58.086 --> 00:00:58.922
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Display grid.

13
00:00:58.922 --> 00:01:01.501
Cuz nothing happens unless
we display grid, right?

14
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:06.755
And then, we basically display
how many columns we have.

15
00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:10.682
Whats the correct way to display that?

16
00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:12.322
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Grid template.

17
00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:18.543
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Grid template column,
and what should our layout be?

18
00:01:18.543 --> 00:01:23.401
We have a header, a nav, and
aside, an article one, two, and

19
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:25.529
three, and then a footer.

20
00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:30.539
So what we could do, is have the header
with the nav right underneath it,

21
00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.495
and then we side to the side to the left,
and

22
00:01:33.495 --> 00:01:38.506
have article one be a big article on top,
and then two and three be smaller

23
00:01:38.506 --> 00:01:44.211
articles taking up the rest of the space
underneath it, and then have the footer.

24
00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:45.446
So let's do it that way.

25
00:01:45.446 --> 00:01:49.759
So that means we have a width of three.

26
00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.302
Because the most counts we're gonna have
is when the aside is next to two articles.

27
00:01:55.302 --> 00:02:01.671
So, we're gonna have the first one be 1,
8em.

28
00:02:04.062 --> 00:02:06.798
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then repeat.

29
00:02:06.798 --> 00:02:08.918
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I think you need an S,
columns.

30
00:02:08.918 --> 00:02:09.418
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Thank you.

31
00:02:12.543 --> 00:02:16.714
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We're gonna repeat,
and then do 1fr each, okay.

32
00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:25.245
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Then,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Now let's do the rows.

33
00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:26.723
How big do we want our header to be?

34
00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.309
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Rows, you know what?

35
00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:34.658
I'm gonna actually define
the locations now,

36
00:02:34.658 --> 00:02:36.837
because this looks really confusing to me.

37
00:02:36.837 --> 00:02:39.884
I'm gonna place them
before I do the heights.

38
00:02:39.884 --> 00:02:44.984
So, the header is,

39
00:02:44.984 --> 00:02:50.086
where's the grid?

40
00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:51.392
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Row and the column.

41
00:02:51.392 --> 00:02:53.839
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay?

42
00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:57.079
We can do grid row.

43
00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.254
And it goes from the first
line to the second line.

44
00:03:03.134 --> 00:03:04.863
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: All right.

45
00:03:08.092 --> 00:03:10.375
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And grid column.

46
00:03:13.734 --> 00:03:15.952
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Goes from the first line.

47
00:03:15.952 --> 00:03:18.080
How many lines do we have?

48
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.257
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Four.

49
00:03:20.257 --> 00:03:21.559
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Four, very good.

50
00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:25.487
We have four because we had
one on the left of header, and

51
00:03:25.487 --> 00:03:30.095
one of right of the side, and
then the two white lines in between.

52
00:03:30.095 --> 00:03:37.564
So, we'll put a grid row and
grid column on the first one,

53
00:03:37.564 --> 00:03:42.837
the nav,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Basically we want it to

54
00:03:42.837 --> 00:03:46.563
be next, so here I just put the nav on top
of the header, but I don't really wanna do

55
00:03:46.563 --> 00:03:51.699
that, so I'm going to put it underneath,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

56
00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:56.350
I now definitely know that I want

57
00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.485
my grid-template-rows,

58
00:04:00.485 --> 00:04:05.307
I want the first ones to be 3em and

59
00:04:05.307 --> 00:04:08.246
then 1em, right?

60
00:04:08.246 --> 00:04:11.830
And then the rest, actually,
let's make it 6 and 2.

61
00:04:15.026 --> 00:04:15.542
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Right, and

62
00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:18.285
then I'm gonna continue making
it a little bit prettier here.

63
00:04:18.285 --> 00:04:23.547
Here we have the aside, and
we have an article, article, article,

64
00:04:23.547 --> 00:04:28.293
but we want the article 1 to take
up most of the width, right?

65
00:04:28.293 --> 00:04:33.551
So let's go to article 1, and

66
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:40.420
we want it to go from,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We're

67
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.890
starting with row 3 and going to 4.

68
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.427
And we're starting with grid column 2 and
going to 4.

69
00:04:51.472 --> 00:04:55.320
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We want the aside
to be all the way down here,

70
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.137
we don't want it here, right?

71
00:04:58.137 --> 00:05:00.970
So let's make our aside
taller than the article.

72
00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:09.074
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So,
we start in grid row 3 to 5, rather.

73
00:05:17.595 --> 00:05:19.600
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And just 1 to 2.

74
00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:24.428
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That's looking good so
far, right?

75
00:05:24.428 --> 00:05:31.318
And then we want the footer to be,
I don't actually have to declare the row,

76
00:05:31.318 --> 00:05:35.532
we can just let it land where it lands,
right?

77
00:05:35.532 --> 00:05:39.993
If we add more articles it
will add more articles.

78
00:05:39.993 --> 00:05:44.858
So here's our layout, it looks terrible.

79
00:05:44.858 --> 00:05:49.441
So let's add a gap,

80
00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:55.107
grid-gap 20 pixels.

81
00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:04.607
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then grid width.

82
00:06:04.607 --> 00:06:06.429
You would not do this normally, but

83
00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:08.931
you would also have a much
better looking thing.

84
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:12.383
Okay, so how's that for
a layout of a page?

85
00:06:12.383 --> 00:06:17.291
I actually think the footer is too big.

86
00:06:17.291 --> 00:06:19.020
So let's go with.

87
00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.224
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Here we had ems for

88
00:06:23.224 --> 00:06:27.895
the header
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Or rather 6em for

89
00:06:27.895 --> 00:06:32.751
the header and 2em for the nav,
and then I wanna do auto and

90
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:39.318
auto because I don't care how I want them
to actually fill up the room, right?

91
00:06:39.318 --> 00:06:43.782
I want this one to fill up whatever my
article is going to be, and this one to

92
00:06:43.782 --> 00:06:48.761
be whatever my article is going to be, and
then I want the footer to be 2ems again.

93
00:06:48.761 --> 00:06:49.533
Did that work?

94
00:06:49.533 --> 00:06:51.117
It did.

95
00:06:51.117 --> 00:06:52.374
How's that for a layout?

96
00:07:04.887 --> 00:07:07.716
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This is
a nice typical webpage, right?

97
00:07:07.716 --> 00:07:08.780
How many lines of code?

98
00:07:10.765 --> 00:07:11.864
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Not much.

99
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:22.072
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Basically we set this up,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

100
00:07:22.072 --> 00:07:25.447
we told a few of the things
to go across the whole thing.

101
00:07:25.447 --> 00:07:30.375
So we told footer but we could have just

102
00:07:30.375 --> 00:07:34.233
done header and nav, right?

103
00:07:34.233 --> 00:07:37.124
And then we can get rid of header and
nav up here.

104
00:07:44.496 --> 00:07:46.474
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
article two and three,

105
00:07:46.474 --> 00:07:49.056
we just let them go where they went.

106
00:07:49.056 --> 00:07:53.735
So how many lines of markup is that?

107
00:07:53.735 --> 00:07:56.665
We basically had to tell it aside that
we actually wanted to span two articles.

108
00:07:56.665 --> 00:07:57.637
We did have to do that.

109
00:07:59.386 --> 00:08:07.069
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: But,
we didn't even have to do that.

110
00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:10.378
Whenever you have just one,
you don't even have to include it.

111
00:08:10.378 --> 00:08:16.101
So if four lines describing the body
which is basically display grid,

112
00:08:16.101 --> 00:08:18.624
all right, that's one line.

113
00:08:18.624 --> 00:08:22.531
Create grid template columns and rows and
there's a shorthand for both of those

114
00:08:22.531 --> 00:08:26.275
together, which I believe is a great
area but I haven't mastered that yet.

115
00:08:26.275 --> 00:08:31.525
Then we have grid-gap, then we have
the aside which we tell to span.

116
00:08:31.525 --> 00:08:35.028
And then we have the first article,
which is wider, so

117
00:08:35.028 --> 00:08:36.865
we have to tell it to do that.

118
00:08:36.865 --> 00:08:41.727
If I got rid of this,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We don't actually

119
00:08:41.727 --> 00:08:43.004
need that line.

120
00:08:43.004 --> 00:08:45.658
And then we have footer, header content
just go across the whole thing.

121
00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:49.769
So we have one, two, three, four, five,

122
00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:54.007
six, seven lines to do
the full page layout.

123
00:08:54.007 --> 00:08:56.900
I think grid is the kind of the way to go,
cuz it's gonna make our lives easier.
