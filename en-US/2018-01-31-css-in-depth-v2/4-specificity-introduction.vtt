00:00:03.887 --> 00:00:07.710
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: One thing,
I'm going to cover specificity twice.

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.180
I'm gonna cover it now briefly.

3
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.070
Because I'm gonna talk about
it throughout the talk, and

4
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.330
I'm gonna talk about it
more in depth later.

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.481
So, when I talk about specificity,
I'm going to say things

6
00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:25.335
like 0-0-1, 0-0-1 is basically the weight.

7
00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:30.370
So the lowest weight is the one
on the right-hand side.

8
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.900
The one in the middle is the medium.

9
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.303
And the biggest strength is on the left.

10
00:00:35.303 --> 00:00:41.053
So no matter what you have
in this position right here,

11
00:00:41.053 --> 00:00:43.936
if you have 0-0- 24.

12
00:00:43.936 --> 00:00:51.255
That will be less specific than 0- 1- 0.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's basically

13
00:00:51.255 --> 00:00:56.339
when you're comparing specificity you
compare the different columns and

14
00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.450
which ever one has the highest number.

15
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.850
In the most,
in the column with the most weight so

16
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.046
whichever one has the highest
number here wins.

17
00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:09.210
If they have the same number here,
then you go over to here and

18
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.540
whichever one has the highest number wins.

19
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.460
And if they have the same number
in this second value, ops!

20
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.400
Then you go over to the third number.

21
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.320
And you say,
which one has the highest value?

22
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.460
And that's the one that wins
in terms of specificity.

23
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.310
If you have two with the exact same value,
so let's say you have,

24
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.360
color equals green, and
color equals blue, on a paragraph.

25
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.160
It's both, it's hitting this
paragraph you want it to be, but

26
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.930
the paragraph has an ID and a class and
it's a paragraph, what is the way,

27
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.358
which one takes precedence,
the one that says my ID,

28
00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:54.070
my class paragraph, we'll have 1- 1-1,
and so it'll be heavier,

29
00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.590
it will have more specificity than just
0-0-1 which is just saying paragraph.

30
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.112
But if you have two things say
make all the paragraphs blue, and

31
00:02:04.112 --> 00:02:06.706
two things saying make
the paragraphs green,

32
00:02:06.706 --> 00:02:10.930
it is the one that comes latest in
the cascade that takes precedent.

33
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.790
So that's the cascading part.

34
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.850
There's specificity and
then there's the cascade.

35
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.260
And then there's inheritance.

36
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.684
So I am going to talk about the weight,
and so I want to cover this, but

37
00:02:21.684 --> 00:02:24.534
we're going to talk about
specificity a little later on.
