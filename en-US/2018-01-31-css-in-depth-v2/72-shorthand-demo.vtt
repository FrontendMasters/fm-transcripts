00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.174
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
background shorthand property.

2
00:00:06.174 --> 00:00:10.681
The background shorthand
property is image,

3
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:15.766
the background position,
slash background size,

4
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:20.388
repeat or no repeat,
background attachment,

5
00:00:20.388 --> 00:00:24.393
background origin, background clip.

6
00:00:24.393 --> 00:00:30.000
Comma, image number 2, the position,
slash size, repeat attachment.

7
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.170
Border origin and clip and
then you put the color.

8
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.560
The background color, so
the color is declared on the last one.

9
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.210
If you're using background shorthand.

10
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.160
This is why I suggest never using this.

11
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.660
Cuz who here has ever learned this syntax?

12
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.760
One person.

13
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.900
And that's one person cuz I
can't raise my hand, cuz I fail.

14
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.030
I get something wrong.

15
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.040
So my recommendation is do not
use background shorthand but

16
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.512
you can do whatever you want but
this is my suggestion.

17
00:01:08.512 --> 00:01:13.420
But mostly realise if you use background
and you just change the background colour

18
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.340
to blue and you use background blue,
you've overwritten all of this.

19
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.997
So if you are gonna name four of these
properties you need at least four, sure,

20
00:01:21.997 --> 00:01:22.800
use it.

21
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.445
But if you're just changing
the background image,

22
00:01:24.445 --> 00:01:26.230
just use the background image property.

23
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.189
If you're just using the background
origin, just switch that one property.

24
00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.555
If you're naming lots of them then go for
it.

25
00:01:34.974 --> 00:01:39.863
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so here we can play
with the shark because the shark actually

26
00:01:39.863 --> 00:01:43.984
has an aspect ratio and
this is saying I want this image.

27
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:48.699
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The position is at 0,0.

28
00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:55.288
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The size is 30
pixels by 30 pixels, repeating,

29
00:01:55.288 --> 00:01:58.581
scrolling, and then the clip in origin.

30
00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:02.940
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Nope,
it's origin and clip.

31
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.840
You see, I forgot already.

32
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.665
So play with this for 30 seconds.

33
00:02:07.665 --> 00:02:13.687
And just see if we actually do contain.

34
00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:19.465
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That doesn't work.

35
00:02:19.465 --> 00:02:23.348
But that is a background size,
no that was the origin.

36
00:02:23.348 --> 00:02:25.360
0, 0, if I do contain.

37
00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:36.092
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,
so apparently I lied.

38
00:02:36.092 --> 00:02:36.837
But I didn't lie.

39
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.544
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So remember how I
said that the shark will grow if you

40
00:02:45.544 --> 00:02:46.500
use contain?

41
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.800
It's actually repeating
in both directions.

42
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.936
And I think it might be
because I'm using a hokey.

43
00:02:59.984 --> 00:03:01.968
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's just
see if I do that on the HTML.

44
00:03:01.968 --> 00:03:03.344
No.

45
00:03:03.344 --> 00:03:05.072
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cuz you have repeat.

46
00:03:05.072 --> 00:03:06.041
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: No, but the thing is,

47
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:08.476
it should only repeat in one direction,
not both.

48
00:03:08.476 --> 00:03:09.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I see.

49
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.912
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Cuz I thought contain
actually made it grow in one direction.

50
00:03:11.912 --> 00:03:20.525
So let's just do,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: What's

51
00:03:20.525 --> 00:03:25.618
going on here is I'm,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I

52
00:03:25.618 --> 00:03:27.464
want to do border box and border box.

53
00:03:30.382 --> 00:03:33.799
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
then I'm gonna put style back in.

54
00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.645
Okay, so that looks like it went
from the top to the bottom.

55
00:03:37.645 --> 00:03:39.742
So you see it repeated in one direction,

56
00:03:39.742 --> 00:03:43.703
whereas before the shark had grown when
I said, both of them I said contain.

57
00:03:43.703 --> 00:03:46.242
How many people have put a background
image on a style block before?

58
00:03:50.088 --> 00:03:53.235
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This is my
first time too, kinda funny.

59
00:03:53.235 --> 00:03:53.971
Okay.

60
00:04:14.722 --> 00:04:16.665
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I don't know
why it's repeating, okay.

61
00:04:16.665 --> 00:04:22.297
So, let's do cover.

62
00:04:22.297 --> 00:04:25.823
Now with cover,
there is no point to put in repeat,

63
00:04:25.823 --> 00:04:31.416
because it's never gonna repeat cuz it's
always gonna take up the whole thing.

64
00:04:31.416 --> 00:04:36.418
And then I'm gonna put this on the style

65
00:04:36.418 --> 00:04:41.883
right here and so
it is covering the style.

66
00:04:41.883 --> 00:04:49.436
But the shark is the width
of my style block, right?

67
00:04:49.436 --> 00:04:52.850
And the reason it's cut off is
because to make it that wide,

68
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.571
it had to make it really tall.

69
00:04:58.102 --> 00:05:04.579
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If I do,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That's scary.

70
00:05:07.553 --> 00:05:10.786
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There,
my shark is eating everyone.

71
00:05:10.786 --> 00:05:11.910
That's cool.

72
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.360
So I basically put it
vertically at the 70% mark.

73
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.342
And now, since no one can read it,
I hope you're playing along.

74
00:05:23.342 --> 00:05:25.566
That's cover.

75
00:05:25.566 --> 00:05:30.265
What else would you like for

76
00:05:30.265 --> 00:05:34.560
me to do with this shark?

77
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.026
So, here I just declared 50 pixels.

78
00:05:39.026 --> 00:05:44.887
So that's gonna be,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The width of it,

79
00:05:44.887 --> 00:05:45.575
I believe.

80
00:05:45.575 --> 00:05:48.160
And then the height is gonna be automatic.

81
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.127
It's gonna be auto.

82
00:05:49.127 --> 00:05:51.489
It says if I did auto.

83
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.068
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I could also do auto here
and basically say I want it to be 100

84
00:05:59.068 --> 00:06:04.440
pixels tall and I don't care how wide it
has to be, just use the aspect ratio.

85
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:12.470
Or, I could do 400 and
just completely make an obese shark.

86
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.230
He looks much friendlier there,
doesn't he?

87
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.400
Let's make him look super friendly.

88
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.272
There, now he's just smiling.

89
00:06:23.272 --> 00:06:25.116
Okay, so that's the background properties.
