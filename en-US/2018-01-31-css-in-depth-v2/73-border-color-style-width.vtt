00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.166
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's talk
about border properties.

2
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:09.400
So, again, colors,

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.640
use any color type you want,
the default is current color.

4
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.810
So, the default for
background color was transparent.

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.550
The default for
border color is current color.

6
00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:28.487
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: None and hidden,

7
00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:34.611
I would have actually assumed
that hidden would take up space,

8
00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:37.280
and it doesn't seem to be.

9
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.063
Then, we have dotted and
dashed, solid, double, groove,

10
00:00:45.063 --> 00:00:50.632
ridge, inset and outset.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Those

11
00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:56.625
are your styles.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You need to declare,

12
00:00:56.625 --> 00:00:59.823
a style in your background, I mean,

13
00:00:59.823 --> 00:01:05.080
in your border shorthand or
else you won't have a border.

14
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.700
It can say three pixels and a color and
you still won't have a border,

15
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.120
because it needs to have the style.

16
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.140
That's the only thing that is required,
because the default is three pixels, or

17
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.430
medium, rather.

18
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.840
The default is medium width, and
the default color is current color.

19
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.790
So it has defaults for those, but

20
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.420
the default for
border on most properties is none.

21
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.540
It used to be that you'd have, by default,
border on images no, on linked images.

22
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.680
So border width, the default is medium.

23
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.840
You can say thin, medium, thick, inherit
or provide one to four length values.

24
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.500
And the length values are in the trouble
order which is top, right, bottom, left.

25
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.000
And I think everyone knows this already,
so we have border style, border width.

26
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.569
And then border color, and
then we have the border short hand.

27
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.290
Again, the style is required,
the width defaults to medium and

28
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.890
the color defaults to current color.

29
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.930
An interesting thing to note,
which will hit during animations and

30
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.510
transitions is when you have
a shorthand property such as border.

31
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.790
And you animate the border, which don't
animate the border cuz it looks hideous.

32
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.910
But if you're going to animate the border
and you're gonna use the border shorthand,

33
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.980
your animation and transition events
are actually there's gonna be 12 of them.

34
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.068
There's gonna be one for top-right, or
top border color, top border length,

35
00:02:38.068 --> 00:02:43.190
top border color if you're doing it,
right border,

36
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.640
so you can have up to 12 if
you're animating 12 of them.

37
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.032
So for every time there's a transition
of a property and it ends, it throws

38
00:02:52.032 --> 00:02:56.791
a transition end event and you can end
up having 12 transition end events.
