00:00:02.777 --> 00:00:06.910
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so another thing
we can do with CSS is art direction.

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.902
There is -webkit-filter and
it actually works, I believe,

3
00:00:11.902 --> 00:00:17.215
not just on Chrome, but
prefixed with -webkit on most browsers.

4
00:00:17.215 --> 00:00:21.167
So here, I can change the hue of this.

5
00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:22.480
I can change the blur.

6
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.577
I can change the grayscale.

7
00:00:25.577 --> 00:00:30.165
And so you see -webkit,
they're called shaders.

8
00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:34.080
It's a CSS filter effect,
but they're called shaders.

9
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.511
I said -webkit-filter:blur(5px)
grayscale(.06) hue-rotate and

10
00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:40.666
there's other properties down here.

11
00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:44.222
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I'm gonna reset it,
cuz I really don't like it.

12
00:00:44.222 --> 00:00:46.777
Let's go with sepia.

13
00:00:51.768 --> 00:00:54.379
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If you wanna
do an old-school photo,

14
00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.161
you can do it right there in the browser.

15
00:00:57.161 --> 00:01:01.895
You can do all of your images have sepia,
and when you hover over them,

16
00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.829
they get rid of their sepia.

17
00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.060
It's basically doing art without
adding extra images on the web.

18
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.882
So those are shaders.

19
00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:15.890
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The next one
is a background-blend-mode.

20
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.700
So here I have an animated
SVG heart as a background,

21
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.120
just to show you what
you shouldn't do online.

22
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.983
You should not have
an animated background,

23
00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.490
cuz this will get really tiresome really,
really quickly.

24
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.270
But you can do an SVG animation.

25
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.680
I did grab the idea from someone,
and it's credited in the SVG code.

26
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.418
And you can take a look
at the SVG code and

27
00:01:36.418 --> 00:01:38.590
actually learn how to do
this type of animation.

28
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.460
So what I did is I did color-dodge.

29
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.420
So if I get rid of this,
you'll see I have two backgrounds.

30
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.077
I have a gray gradient that
goes from black to white.

31
00:01:52.077 --> 00:01:55.234
Let's just make this visible.

32
00:01:55.234 --> 00:01:56.895
Shoot.

33
00:01:56.895 --> 00:02:01.672
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I can't actually
hit a return in this example, but

34
00:02:01.672 --> 00:02:04.792
maybe I can hit a backward space.

35
00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:10.300
Yep, okay, so
I'm going to make this color-dodge again.

36
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.300
And then I'm going to change this
from black to white, to red to white.

37
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.750
And so you saw the colors change,
and then I'm gonna do blue.

38
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.436
And then I'm gonna do transparent.

39
00:02:28.222 --> 00:02:32.010
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
here you saw that I did color-dodge.

40
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.940
What's nifty is, if I can go down, we have
all these other options of luminosity,

41
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.004
color, saturation, hue, exclusion,
difference, soft-light, hard-light,

42
00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:48.670
color-burn, color-dodge, lighten, darken,
overlay, screen, multiply, and normal.

43
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.795
So let's try some of these.

44
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.200
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So I don't like multiply
cuz it actually shows my background

45
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.888
image on top.

46
00:02:58.888 --> 00:02:59.788
Let's try color-burn.

47
00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:05.090
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That's cool.

48
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.179
So this is not like I'm gonna teach
you deep-dive how to do this.

49
00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:13.404
I just wanted to show you that
background-blend-mode exists.

50
00:03:13.404 --> 00:03:15.087
And it's actually pretty
decently supported.
