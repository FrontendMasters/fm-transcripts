00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:03.659
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Animation direction,
so far,

2
00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.343
the pencil has always gone from
the left to the right, right?

3
00:00:07.343 --> 00:00:11.559
We can actually say alternate, so the
first time it's gonna go across this way,

4
00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.890
and the second time,
it's gonna go backwards.

5
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.189
So it goes from the 0%
mark to the 100% mark and

6
00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.090
from the 100% mark back to the 0%
mark in terms of our key frame.

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.930
There's four values, it can be normal or
alternate, which is what we saw.

8
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.282
It can be only reverse, so it always
goes from the 100% mark to the 0% mark.

9
00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:36.516
If you're doing a seesaw animation, this
would be good for the second person to be,

10
00:00:36.516 --> 00:00:40.110
for the second person, you always
wanna start with alternate-reverse.

11
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.691
Starts in the backward mode,
and then goes forward.

12
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:46.423
So the first animation starts
at the 100% mark, goes to 0, and

13
00:00:46.423 --> 00:00:48.133
then it goes from 0 to 100.

14
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:54.460
So we've covered a lot
of longhand properties.

15
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.027
We might as well use the shorthand.

16
00:00:56.027 --> 00:01:00.246
So the shorthand would be animation name,
duration, delay,

17
00:01:00.246 --> 00:01:04.680
timing function,
iteration count, and direction.

18
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.760
We don't need to put the direction
in cuz it's actually normal,

19
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.100
that's the default value, right?

20
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.620
The thing is here,
I put the draw line first.

21
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.263
Had my animation name been running,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Or

22
00:01:19.263 --> 00:01:22.080
linear, I would have had
a really big problem.

23
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.250
Because the first time it hits a value,

24
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.960
the browser hits a value that
it can understand as a value for

25
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.370
one of the animation properties,
that's what it will use it for.

26
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.705
So if I had a guy who was jogging and
I called it running,

27
00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:40.541
the browser would think,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The value of

28
00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:43.520
the animation play state is running.

29
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.570
It should be five seconds.

30
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.510
It should be ease in, ease out.

31
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.180
It should last a delay of 100
milliseconds, it should go five times.

32
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.400
But where's the animation name?

33
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.200
Because it used running as the play state.

34
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.990
So the order does matter a little bit.

35
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.370
If you use a key term,
you're gonna get screwed.

36
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.000
So realize when you mess up and
your animation isn't working,

37
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.910
that you might have used some key word for
an animation.

38
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.060
So what's nice about this is
I can actually click these

39
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.210
now with an animation and stop it.

40
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.603
Cuz I've just changed the class.

41
00:02:24.603 --> 00:02:27.540
I basically changed the class and
then made the animation go.

42
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.320
And then when I click it,
it goes in the reverse direction.

43
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.657
I changed the class from flipped
to unflipped, and that's it.

44
00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:39.914
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so,
the most complex part for

45
00:02:39.914 --> 00:02:43.760
people to understand is
the animation-fill-mode.

46
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.350
Well, it's either
the animation-timing-function or

47
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.734
the animation-fill-mode.

48
00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:52.762
So the animation-fill-mode is what you
do during the time that the animation

49
00:02:52.762 --> 00:02:57.028
delay expires and what you do
after you've hit the 100% mark or

50
00:02:57.028 --> 00:03:00.280
the 0% mark, depending on the direction.

51
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.530
After your last animations happen, after
your animation ends, what just happens?

52
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.650
So none means just go back to the default
as if the animation wasn't attached.

53
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.860
Backwards means during the animation
delay, keep it at the 0% mark.

54
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.600
Wherever you're gonna start your
animation, bring it all the way there.

55
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.540
If you're doing reverse,
it would go to the 100% mark.

56
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.380
Forwards means wherever that
animation ended, stop there and

57
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.380
keep that good looking look, right?

58
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.088
And both means do both forwards and
backwards.

59
00:03:38.088 --> 00:03:42.819
So here, I have these four boxes.

60
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.200
And I have changed the colors
because I did a global search and

61
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.800
replace on my document cuz I'm an idiot.

62
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.573
And so it's gonna go from
blue to dark blue, I guess.

63
00:03:55.573 --> 00:03:58.718
And the animation-fill-mode,
the first one's gonna be none,

64
00:03:58.718 --> 00:04:02.383
the second one is forwards, the third
is backwards, and the fourth is both.

65
00:04:02.383 --> 00:04:06.927
So the reason that the third one and
the fourth one are both already

66
00:04:06.927 --> 00:04:11.883
100% of 200 pixels from the left
is because they're saying

67
00:04:11.883 --> 00:04:17.103
the 0% keyframe says 200 pixels from
the left, and it should be blue.

68
00:04:17.103 --> 00:04:20.210
So it's picking up the blue, right?

69
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:21.400
Does that make sense to people?

70
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.232
Whereas the one where it says
animation-fill-mode none and

71
00:04:24.232 --> 00:04:25.922
animation-fill-mode forwards,

72
00:04:25.922 --> 00:04:28.820
it's not doing anything before
the animation delay expires.

73
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.085
So I have to click somewhere.

74
00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:37.611
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
then the animation is supposed to start.

75
00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:39.499
And I don't know where the place
is that I'm supposed to click.

76
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.090
So we're just gonna go to
this test page right here.

77
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.460
And once the animation starts,
they all jump to the 200 pixels.

78
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.331
And then the one that says forwards and
both stays at the 100% mark.

79
00:04:53.331 --> 00:04:59.850
So the 100% mark says yellow,
less 600 pixels, scale to rotate.

80
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.380
So the both and the forwards
are stuck on the 100% mark, and

81
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.970
then when it says none or
backwards, stays at these.

82
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.550
So let's actually just do this again,
I'm gonna run it again.

83
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.777
To run it again, I just change this,
okay, there's no shocks me.

84
00:05:20.777 --> 00:05:25.510
Here, we have five seconds
while the delay expires.

85
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.765
And then, everything gonna
go to the 200 mark, be blue,

86
00:05:27.765 --> 00:05:30.040
everything's gonna rotate and be green.

87
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.285
Just the both and
the forwards are gonna stay as yellow.

88
00:05:37.332 --> 00:05:41.736
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: At the start,
the none and the backwards and

89
00:05:41.736 --> 00:05:46.862
the both,
both started at the 200 mark in blue.

90
00:05:46.862 --> 00:05:48.159
Does that make sense to people?

91
00:05:51.263 --> 00:05:54.702
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,
and that was that slide.
