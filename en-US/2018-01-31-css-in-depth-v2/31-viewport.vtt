00:00:02.195 --> 00:00:03.720
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
let's talk about viewport a little bit.

2
00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:08.182
So viewport,
you saw there was a ms-viewport, and

3
00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:10.735
I said,
I don't know why I put it in this slide.

4
00:00:10.735 --> 00:00:16.509
Well, basically this here,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Viewport really is a CSS

5
00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.970
feature, which is, what is the size of
this window, and how should I display it?

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.142
But viewport is so

7
00:00:22.142 --> 00:00:26.921
important, to necessary it should be
by default in all your HTML files.

8
00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:31.011
All of your HTML files should start
with the meta tag of viewport and

9
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:33.141
say width equals device-width.

10
00:00:33.141 --> 00:00:37.119
And that's all you need to say,
but always include it.

11
00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:44.248
Do not use user-scalable no.

12
00:00:44.248 --> 00:00:48.740
Do not use max-zoom one or min-zoom one,
or whatever that feature is.

13
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.247
Maximum scale one, and minimum scale one.

14
00:00:52.247 --> 00:00:54.323
What does that do?

15
00:00:54.323 --> 00:00:58.103
Anyone can take a guess or
hover over this?

16
00:00:58.103 --> 00:00:59.553
It makes it not scalable.

17
00:00:59.553 --> 00:01:03.297
What happens when
a website is not scalable?

18
00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:07.226
I can't read it, cuz I actually do
wear reading glasses, except for

19
00:01:07.226 --> 00:01:11.562
I don't wear reading glasses, I don't
bring them with me anywhere, and so

20
00:01:11.562 --> 00:01:13.357
I can't read if I can't zoom.

21
00:01:13.357 --> 00:01:17.205
The only time you should
ever use maximum and

22
00:01:17.205 --> 00:01:23.030
minimum scalable of one is if you
are doing a game on a touch device.

23
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.392
Because you don't want them
to accidentally zoom in or

24
00:01:26.392 --> 00:01:29.179
zoom out when they're touching something.

25
00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.723
Same reason that the only time to
use the tap highlights to get rid of

26
00:01:33.723 --> 00:01:36.010
the selection, is a video game.

27
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.470
Because you don't want someone
to accidentally zoom in and

28
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.139
have half the game off of the screen,
cuz then they can't play.

29
00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:43.974
But that is the only time ever.

30
00:01:43.974 --> 00:01:48.319
Google Gmail, in the browser,
has zoom disabled.

31
00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.090
I cannot read my e-mail on my mobile
device because they disabled, too.

32
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.221
And they also have eight or
nine different seat selection icons.

33
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:03.660
They really need more diverse
people on their staff.

34
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.924
So we have, in terms of this
viewport right here, in terms of

35
00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:11.788
the viewport tag meta tag, we have width,
height, initial-scale, maximum-scale,

36
00:02:11.788 --> 00:02:16.217
minimum-scale, and user-scalable,
which is basically all self-evident.

37
00:02:16.217 --> 00:02:20.541
In terms of the viewport, @viewport,
we have min-width, max-width,

38
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:25.199
width max, min-height, max-height,
height, zoom, min-zoom, max, and

39
00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:32.125
they're basically the exact same features.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Where was I?

40
00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:37.791
Here, so here, it says media screen,
max-width is 400 ms-viewport.

41
00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:42.147
The reason that we had put
viewport earlier in was that,

42
00:02:42.147 --> 00:02:44.193
it was in the wrong slide.

43
00:02:44.193 --> 00:02:47.343
But it's basically only Microsoft
supported the viewport.

44
00:02:47.343 --> 00:02:49.501
And I'm not sure if other
browsers are going to.

45
00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:50.276
It's been discussed.

46
00:02:50.276 --> 00:02:55.268
I don't know if it's been implemented.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

47
00:02:55.268 --> 00:03:00.020
here it says, if meta is set to disable
zoom, there is no delay on touch

48
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.870
devices on the onClick events,
which makes it sound awesome, right?

49
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.310
But if meta is set to disable zoom,
you're a jerk.

50
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.746
So which one is more important,
not being a jerk?

51
00:03:11.746 --> 00:03:16.084
So it makes sense on the video game that
the click device, the event handler,

52
00:03:16.084 --> 00:03:20.625
if you can't zoom then it clicks right
away because normally, it's waiting for

53
00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:23.326
the double tap to see if
you wanna zoom in or not.

54
00:03:23.326 --> 00:03:26.162
If it's a video game,
you don't want the double tap.

55
00:03:26.162 --> 00:03:27.402
You don't want the zoom.

56
00:03:27.402 --> 00:03:33.621
You can get rid of it, otherwise,

57
00:03:33.621 --> 00:03:38.347
make sure you include it.

58
00:03:38.347 --> 00:03:42.488
What I was saying in terms of touching,
the tap highlight color,

59
00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:46.038
the user selective none,
the touch-callout, none.

60
00:03:46.038 --> 00:03:51.734
These are the things I talked about
during the talk about selecting text.

61
00:03:51.734 --> 00:03:56.421
Here it is again because it's very
important, ms touch-action none.

62
00:03:56.421 --> 00:04:01.398
These are all to prevent accidental
OS things during a game,

63
00:04:01.398 --> 00:04:05.666
no reason to use it otherwise.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

64
00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:08.646
use cases of these media queries.

65
00:04:08.646 --> 00:04:13.896
So here I have media screen and

66
00:04:13.896 --> 00:04:18.307
min-width is 38ems.

67
00:04:18.307 --> 00:04:21.224
So anything that's 38ems or bigger,

68
00:04:21.224 --> 00:04:25.956
content put it as 21%.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Because

69
00:04:25.956 --> 00:04:30.023
there's a different way of doing this,
which is basically just saying

70
00:04:30.023 --> 00:04:34.310
make the paragraph a max-width of
whatever I want it to be a max-width of.

71
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.710
So here let's open this up and play.

72
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.655
Yes, I do wanna leave.

73
00:04:38.655 --> 00:04:46.253
Okay, so here I have 21%, right?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If I shrink it,

74
00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.132
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: At least I get like so,

75
00:04:53.132 --> 00:04:59.664
on a small device, I don't wanna have
huge padding on both sides, right?

76
00:04:59.664 --> 00:05:03.964
On a larger device,
I wanna lot of white space.

77
00:05:03.964 --> 00:05:08.579
So here, I still have five pixels
of padding on either side, but

78
00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:14.056
if it's a really big screen, I can have
a nice large column down the middle.

79
00:05:14.056 --> 00:05:20.634
This is much more legible
than if I did padding zero.

80
00:05:20.634 --> 00:05:23.537
Those lines are not legible, right?

81
00:05:23.537 --> 00:05:27.793
21% was nice, right, but

82
00:05:27.793 --> 00:05:35.016
I could also do,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Paragraph,

83
00:05:35.016 --> 00:05:40.379
max-width 54ems, and

84
00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:45.742
maybe make that smaller,

85
00:05:45.742 --> 00:05:51.750
44ems, margin, right?

86
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.130
That's a different way of doing
it without media queries.

87
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.190
So media queries are useful,

88
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.099
we can always think of ways to
do it without media queries.

89
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.874
So this is one scenario where
media query ways might be useful.
