00:00:00.983 --> 00:00:03.738
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
let's talk a little bit about fonts.

2
00:00:03.738 --> 00:00:09.525
We talked the other day about material
icons as generated content or

3
00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:13.594
actually no just as a font
which uses ligature.

4
00:00:13.594 --> 00:00:17.015
And we talked a little bit about
using generated content and

5
00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:18.390
making it accessible.

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.610
And that this is really cool in a way
of doing icons that are legible.

7
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.535
The only thing is what
does this little bug mean,

8
00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:33.050
probably an Android and
a count circle, or a count box.

9
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.718
I'm gonna check my code because I'm
wondering if I actually put titles on this

10
00:00:36.718 --> 00:00:37.951
if they actually show up.

11
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.990
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah, I put a title
on it, that's why it's showing up.

12
00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:49.837
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So,
you saw how I hovered over it, so

13
00:00:49.837 --> 00:00:53.332
I'm just gonna do a View Source,
View, Developer, View Source and

14
00:00:53.332 --> 00:00:55.705
just see if the JavaScript did it or
if I did it.

15
00:00:55.705 --> 00:00:57.203
Yeah, each one has a title.

16
00:00:57.203 --> 00:00:59.373
So, I actually made it accessible,

17
00:00:59.373 --> 00:01:03.862
that is the correct way to do it if you're
gonna use these, put a title on it.

18
00:01:03.862 --> 00:01:08.759
But this is much better than just
using icon fonts that don't actually

19
00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.750
have ligatures or text underneath it,
because it's not accessible.

20
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.610
The thing is this had several
thousand icons, and do I really wanna

21
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.007
download all of these icons as all I'm
gonna use is the trending up icon.

22
00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:32.427
Probably not, so let's just actually put,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Trending up.

23
00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:38.690
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: No, doesn't work, okay.

24
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.374
Let's put trending up right here.

25
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.959
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And there we have
that icon, so just show that it works.

26
00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:51.671
But sometimes when you
are including fonts,

27
00:01:51.671 --> 00:01:58.367
you only want to include
the characters that you're gonna use.

28
00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:02.760
So you can use sub-setting,
so you can take your font.

29
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.037
Put it through FONT SQUIRREL, and

30
00:02:07.037 --> 00:02:10.435
under here it says EXPERT.

31
00:02:10.435 --> 00:02:11.270
Can you guys read that?

32
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.084
Yes you can.

33
00:02:12.084 --> 00:02:13.538
So it says EXPERT.

34
00:02:13.538 --> 00:02:17.103
And then here it says Custom Subsetting.

35
00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:21.945
And you can use just the numbers,
and I'll say 0 through 9, and

36
00:02:21.945 --> 00:02:26.540
then single characters,
I'm just gonna put the ampersand.

37
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.727
And it will generate a font for you,
that only has those characters.

38
00:02:32.727 --> 00:02:36.885
So then you have a tiny little font,
and you can probably actually for

39
00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:40.695
something this small,
you could probably use it as a data URI.

40
00:02:40.695 --> 00:02:45.939
And then you just hit yes,
I'm allowed to create fonts with this and

41
00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:51.183
it will produce the font for you,
the font files, the woff files for

42
00:02:51.183 --> 00:02:55.249
you by default and
then it will give you some script.

43
00:02:55.249 --> 00:03:00.997
So to actually use CSS with it here,
I basically created a font,

44
00:03:00.997 --> 00:03:05.254
I said my font woff2 and
then I did a fallback for

45
00:03:05.254 --> 00:03:09.842
those that don't understand woff2 and
use woff.

46
00:03:09.842 --> 00:03:14.086
Font-weight normal, font-style normal,
and then I gave it a Unicode-range,

47
00:03:14.086 --> 00:03:15.723
U+26 is just the ampersand,

48
00:03:15.723 --> 00:03:19.257
a lot of times your designers just
want an ampersand that looks good.

49
00:03:21.393 --> 00:03:24.486
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This is a one way
of having a family that is just one

50
00:03:24.486 --> 00:03:25.323
character.

51
00:03:27.913 --> 00:03:31.941
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You can also,
if you're using Google font,

52
00:03:31.941 --> 00:03:36.923
you can call just a few characters and
this is what I did,

53
00:03:36.923 --> 00:03:42.011
I did here on this one if you see,
I'm using the Rye font or

54
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:46.463
sans-serif, but
let's just use, Helvetica or

55
00:03:46.463 --> 00:03:50.390
Georgia, I like Georgia as a font, right.

56
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.887
So you saw that I'm changing the font but
some of the letters,

57
00:03:53.887 --> 00:03:57.329
only vowels except from y,
cuz y is always sometimes vowel.

58
00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:03.507
Because I said, text =AEIOU,
both uppercase and lowercase.

59
00:04:03.507 --> 00:04:07.523
Now, when you call this right here.

60
00:04:07.523 --> 00:04:12.770
If you actually, I'm gonna open this up,
go to my inspector,

61
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.290
go to my network,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Or,

62
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.705
actually reload the page.

63
00:04:22.514 --> 00:04:25.950
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
it will have called this CSS file.

64
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.908
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Where is it?

65
00:04:38.397 --> 00:04:46.962
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I just, here's CSS
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,

66
00:04:46.962 --> 00:04:49.200
well, usually it does it.

67
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.088
Instead of doing a separate call,

68
00:04:53.088 --> 00:05:00.379
you'll actually find that,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: What's happening?

69
00:05:03.028 --> 00:05:04.188
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay here it is.

70
00:05:04.188 --> 00:05:08.879
It basically produces something like this.

71
00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:12.953
Instead of calling it a link and
doing all of this,

72
00:05:12.953 --> 00:05:16.639
just look at what that
CSS response gave you.

73
00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.310
And put that into your CSS file and then
you can do one for your HTTP requests.

74
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.590
You're still calling the external
font from Google, but

75
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.869
you're not doing an HTTP request for
cuz you do the link for

76
00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:32.816
rough style sheet and
you grab the five lines of code.

77
00:05:32.816 --> 00:05:37.497
One HTTP request for five lines of code,
and then that in turn goes and

78
00:05:37.497 --> 00:05:41.546
finds the font for you,
save that one, return and do that.

79
00:05:41.546 --> 00:05:46.179
Okay, so that's just a few
ways of improving your fonts.
