00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.320
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Next section we're
going to do is backgrounds and borders.

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:14.970
So, if you're following along, the url is
estelle.github.io/cssmasteries/borders.

3
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.480
If you lose your place, just remember
my first name is Estelle, and

4
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.150
just go to my github estelle.github.io.

5
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.460
Then select the CSS mastery class and
then it's got under borders with an s.

6
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.560
So we're gonna be talking be talking
about background and borders.

7
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.210
And these are the properties
we're gonna cover.

8
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.974
There's some background properties,
of background-color, background-image,

9
00:00:36.974 --> 00:00:40.334
background-repeat, background-attachment,
background-position,

10
00:00:40.334 --> 00:00:44.531
background-clip, background-origin,
background-size, and background-shorthand.

11
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.390
And then there's the border properties,
which you probably know,

12
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.420
of border-color, style, and
width, and the border shorthand.

13
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.660
And then there's also the border-radius.

14
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.310
But then there's also something
called border images,

15
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.210
which most people don't ever use,
so I just wanna introduce it.

16
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.560
And you don't need to memorize
the features of it, but

17
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.440
it's just to give you
a quick little overview, so

18
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.898
if you ever do find yourself thinking,
that might not be a bad idea.

19
00:01:08.898 --> 00:01:14.440
There's border-image-source,
border-image-slice, width, outset, repeat.

20
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.280
And then the shorthand.

21
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.862
So let's start with the background

22
00:01:17.862 --> 00:01:25.970
properties.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay.

23
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.320
The first background property we're
gonna cover is background-color.

24
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.710
And there's nothing new to learn here.

25
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.000
We already went through
the colors earlier yesterday, and

26
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.390
there was a color section, so
you can always look there.

27
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.310
But basically, for background color,
you can use any color type you want.

28
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.530
Name colors, hexadecimal with three,
six, or eight values.

29
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.130
RGB, RGBA, HSL, HSLA.

30
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.840
You can use a code transparent,
which is the default.

31
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.080
And then, there would be no
reason to actually use this, but

32
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.800
you could use current color.

33
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.990
Can anyone think of why current color
background color would be really bad idea?

34
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.020
Yeah.

35
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.470
But if you wanted to just April fools,
you can do things like,

36
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.170
star background color,
current color important.

37
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.310
And then no one could
read any of your sites.

38
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.020
Or maybe you could do that as your last
parting check-in after you get fired.

39
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.420
I don't know, I'm kidding.

40
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.600
Okay.

41
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.100
So there's nothing new here.

42
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.076
If any of this looks confusing to you,
just go and

43
00:02:30.076 --> 00:02:33.204
look at the deck on colors
that we did here earlier.
