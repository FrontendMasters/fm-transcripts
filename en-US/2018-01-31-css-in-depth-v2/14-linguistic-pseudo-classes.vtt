00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.258
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Next we have
linguistic or language pseudo classes.

2
00:00:06.258 --> 00:00:10.913
So CSS 2.1, we already saw that we,

3
00:00:10.913 --> 00:00:17.985
[INAUDIBLE] that came from CCS 1,
no it came from 2.0.

4
00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:22.821
Which is any element that has

5
00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:29.076
an attribute, in this case, lang.

6
00:00:29.076 --> 00:00:33.255
So it's basically F, or

7
00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:38.610
F attribute pipe equals val.

8
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.480
Right, remember this?

9
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.710
It's basically any element F that
has the attribute attribute,

10
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.280
with a value that starts with
the value with or without a dash.

11
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.480
So it would match en, it would
match en-us, it would match en-uk.

12
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.330
So we've already had that forever.

13
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.163
And the things is with this one, is this
just matches that HTML element right?

14
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.460
It doesn't match the entire document, well
in this case it does because it's HTML.

15
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.900
But if the language was
declared in English in

16
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.652
the HTML,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

17
00:01:24.652 --> 00:01:30.520
then we have the lang basically it
says is this language in english?

18
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.570
It doesn't have to be declared
on that element itself.

19
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.390
The first one is saying,
is that attribute present on this element?

20
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.190
The second one is saying is
the language of this document here

21
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.610
at this time right now?

22
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.280
Because you can change it for an element.

23
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.840
You can say the language of this
paragraph is gonna be French,

24
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.790
even though this whole document is in
English, this paragraph is in French.

25
00:01:51.790 --> 00:02:00.430
And then you can target it with
either p lang equals FR or p lang FR.

26
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.720
And so the p lang fr would be,
it is a whole document that is French, or

27
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.560
a section of the page that is in French or
it could be span lang fr.

28
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.950
Which would be a span
within that paragraph.

29
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.900
That paragraph has a declaration of it
be in French, but not the span itself.

30
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.230
The first one, the element actually
has to have that attribute physically

31
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.020
on that element for it to match.

32
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.318
The second one means, is this doing the
natural language at this point in time.

33
00:02:26.922 --> 00:02:30.352
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We also are going to get,
so some languages,

34
00:02:30.352 --> 00:02:36.133
like there is Mandarin Chinese and
there is some other language in Chinese,

35
00:02:36.133 --> 00:02:39.770
so it's like basically
any Chinese language.

36
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.010
Like here we have language en-es en-uk,

37
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.795
but it could be sp-us, en-us and

38
00:02:51.795 --> 00:02:56.100
Vietnamese-us or whatever.

39
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.450
The dialect that's spoken
in the United States or

40
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.590
like French Canadian, versus English
Canadian you could match the Canadian.

41
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.570
And then we also have direction,
is this left to right or right to left?

42
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.530
It doesn't have to be declared
on that exact element.

43
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.454
When you have an attribute selector it
actually has to be clear on that element.
