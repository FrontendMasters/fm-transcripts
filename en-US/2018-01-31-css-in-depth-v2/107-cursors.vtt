00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.440
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Cursors.

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.110
We all use these.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.820
And if you actually mouse
over all of these, so

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.720
feel free to mouse over all of these.

5
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.050
I actually changed
the cursor on all of these.

6
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.754
We have cursors that you might not have
ever thought to use, such as zoom-out and

7
00:00:17.754 --> 00:00:21.850
zoom-in, all-scroll, row-resize,
copy, no-drop, right?

8
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.851
Who used no-drop before?

9
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:25.690
It's kind of cool.

10
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:32.380
Alias, vertical text, cell,
context menu, and none.

11
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.900
And then progress, I think we had
before and we had some of these before.

12
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.980
These have actually all been around for

13
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.750
more than five years, it's just
they didn't make it into the books.

14
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.710
So people usually don't
think about cursors.

15
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.503
They usually just think about default.
