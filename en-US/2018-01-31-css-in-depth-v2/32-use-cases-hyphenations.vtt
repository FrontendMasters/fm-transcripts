00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.720
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So this is just
to introduce another feature which

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.810
is hyphens.

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.093
There's Hyphenation,
there's WBR, and there's Shy.

4
00:00:12.093 --> 00:00:18.070
WBR is element it is HTML.

5
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.510
It's not CSS and you can put it
anywhere where you want to save,

6
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.484
this would be a good place for
a word break.

7
00:00:24.484 --> 00:00:30.450
And then Shy is a dash that is optional,

8
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.560
if it's at the end of the word put
a dash here, if it's not don't.

9
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.440
So those are ways of doing it in the HTML.

10
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.220
In CSS you can just do hyphens auto.

11
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.760
And here I'm just going to get rid of it.

12
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.388
So here are some hyphens
right here because

13
00:00:47.388 --> 00:00:50.970
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, twice.

14
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.350
Breaks twice in the middle of the word.

15
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.450
Then I type in x.

16
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.930
My hyphens isn't working.

17
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.931
So, you might want to use hyphens
if you have a really small screen,

18
00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:09.719
and so it would actually be max
width would make more sense, right?

19
00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.307
So let's play with that one,
and let's do max width.

20
00:01:22.503 --> 00:01:23.560
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Because when you have

21
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.150
a really big screen,
you don't want hyphenation.

22
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.795
But, when you have a really small screen,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You

23
00:01:32.795 --> 00:01:34.280
want hyphenation, right?

24
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.560
Because this, without hyphenation,
would look terrible.

25
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.740
You'd have so many things that were
just three letters on one line.

26
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.070
So that's hyphenation.

27
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.970
you can use it with or
without media queries.

28
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.580
So that's hyphens auto,
that's an other feature.
