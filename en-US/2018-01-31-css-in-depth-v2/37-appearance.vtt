00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.790
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
I mentioned Appearance

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.430
because I was going to introduce it.

3
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.870
And Appearance right here,
we have none button, button-arrow-down,

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.241
button-arrow-next, button-arrow-previous,
button-arrow-up, button-bevel,

5
00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:17.270
button-focus caret, checkbox,
checkbox-container.

6
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.060
These are all values of
the -moz-appearance property.

7
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:25.038
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There's more.

8
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.210
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Then we
have -webkit-appearance.

9
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.990
So these are all things that instead
of defining like a color and

10
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.970
everything else, they'll just say,
basically, -webkit-appearance button and

11
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.340
then it will look like a button.

12
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.310
And so you can change that.

13
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.970
You can say -webkit-appearance none, and

14
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.840
that's something I use a lot,
probably too much.

15
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.360
Because you shouldn't be playing with
the natural appearance of things because

16
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.380
people are used to things
with appearing a certain way.

17
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.010
A radio button should
look like a radio button.

18
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.100
Like there's on off toggles which are like
a thing that is like this wide and

19
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.380
has a button here and
you move it to the side.

20
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.660
But I never know which one means on and
off, because is just a thing.

21
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.320
And is off to the right or to the left I
don't know, why they didn't use the check

22
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.580
box cause the check box is either on or
off and you can click it on and off.

23
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.180
Like a radio button,
you always have to click one on, so

24
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.730
if you have five radio buttons

25
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.230
all having the same name value which
means they're in the same name group.

26
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.530
If you click one, you can click another
one and then the first one will turn off.

27
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.810
There's no way to unclick all five of
them once you've clicked one of them.

28
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.360
Radio boxes you can do that.

29
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.350
So, it's best to actually
use the native features, but

30
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.076
sometimes your designer says I really
want my buttons to be like this.

31
00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:55.050
And so 99% of people use a div or
a span for

32
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.890
a button, when a button is much better,
and you can just change the appearance,

33
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.520
and make it look like it's
a different type of button.

34
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.278
So the reason you wanna use button and
link instead of div-class button or

35
00:02:09.278 --> 00:02:12.640
span-class button is the semantics.

36
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.770
So who cares about the semantics
other than screen readers.

37
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.930
Well if you have a paragraph or div
that is a button how do you tab to that?

38
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.160
You have to give it a tab index.

39
00:02:26.954 --> 00:02:28.772
How do you put it in
the right tab index order,

40
00:02:28.772 --> 00:02:33.860
how do you keyboard navigate to it,
all these different things.

41
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.833
If you actually use
the correct HTML element,

42
00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:43.305
then everything is taken care of for you.

43
00:02:43.305 --> 00:02:46.815
Like I've created a carousel that
works exactly like a carousel,

44
00:02:46.815 --> 00:02:48.517
it spins around it's awesome.

45
00:02:48.517 --> 00:02:50.337
And there's one line of JavaScript which
just says change the background position

46
00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:51.641
or translate the transforms
because I used radio buttons.

47
00:02:51.641 --> 00:02:57.382
So when they click on the next,
when they use their arrow,

48
00:02:57.382 --> 00:03:04.510
they just click onto the next radio
button and everything changes.

49
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.550
And I had to put no
JavaScript to maintain state.

50
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.510
If you use an element for its non-intended
purpose, if you use the wrong element,

51
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.000
you have to use JavaScript
to maintain state.

52
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.950
So I know most people here use Angular
cause I've heard people talking about it.

53
00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:19.902
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: No.

54
00:03:19.902 --> 00:03:23.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 90% of stuff that people

55
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.800
use frameworks for, they could do if they
fully understood what the element does.

56
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.430
And then they wouldn't have to
basically re-create the DOM.

57
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.820
And that's why we have virtual DOMs,

58
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.560
because people don't
understand the actual DOM.

59
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.560
If you understood the actual DOM,
you wouldn't need a virtual DOM.

60
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.140
Which isn't true, there are real cases
to need frameworks and they make sense.

61
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.560
But the only times I know that
Angular is being used is when I

62
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.720
hit an error on a page.

63
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.250
Like, it wants my phone number and my
phone number is ten digits long, but it's

64
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.460
only accepting five digits because they
put the wrong thing into their Angular.

65
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.480
So I go into my web inspector and I change
it and I wonder, no one must submit

66
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.510
this form because no one can submit this
form unless they go into the inspector but

67
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.950
maybe they only want web
developers to submit their form.

68
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.913
Anyhow so, how do I know what the webkit

69
00:04:20.913 --> 00:04:25.944
values are on a media control?

70
00:04:25.944 --> 00:04:29.800
So let's say we have a video and
it has all the controls,

71
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.350
you can actually find these
style sheets that show you.

72
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.920
So the webkit right here,
we have the webkit media controls and

73
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.590
then, let me see, one.

74
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.110
-webkit appearance is media mute button,

75
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.630
right, so if you wanna use the mute
button that comes with the iOS device

76
00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.760
just put in -webkit-appearance: media mute
button and you get a mute button, I think.

77
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.370
I don't know, I wouldn't do that,
I've never done it.

78
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.645
But reading source code, other people's
source code especially browser developers,

79
00:05:09.645 --> 00:05:10.730
you can learn so much.
