00:00:02.792 --> 00:00:06.810
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So CSS stands for
Cascading Style Sheets.

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.085
It does not stand for cascading shit show.

3
00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:10.232
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And

4
00:00:10.232 --> 00:00:15.275
by the end of this two-day session,
hopefully, you'll agree with me on that.

5
00:00:15.275 --> 00:00:17.611
And nor does it stand for
California style sheets.

6
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.130
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So the deck that I had,
I'm just gonna start the snowflakes again.

7
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.710
Basically all I did was put in the eyes
because they were a small character.

8
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.070
And then I had the div of class snowman,
and that made the whole thing work.

9
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.264
So during this talk we're not gonna
actually talk about this deck

10
00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:46.093
because this deck was retired in 2012.

11
00:00:46.093 --> 00:00:51.300
Cuz you can only look at snowflakes for so
long before you get sick of snowflakes.

12
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.115
And I've been in Minneapolis for
a few hours and I'm sick of snowflakes.

13
00:00:58.115 --> 00:01:03.540
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle: But

14
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.520
CSS, with selectors,
you can basically target anything, and

15
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.510
with CSS you can make
those snowflakes random.

16
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.070
They look random, right?

17
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.650
They're rotating, they're dropping,

18
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.900
they're spinning,
they're moving naturally down the page.

19
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.150
That's all done with CSS.

20
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.570
So CSS is the presentation
layer of the web.

21
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.180
There's a lot of people who
talk about putting JS, or

22
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.080
CSS in their JS, they're all wrong.

23
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.800
Not that I have an opinion on it,
they're just wrong, it's not an opinion,

24
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.200
it's just a fact.

25
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.350
Because JavaScript is supposed to be for
the behavior.

26
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.390
So is animation a behavior,
or is it a presentation?

27
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.020
It is actually a presentation
because there's no information being

28
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.040
garnered from it, and
there's nothing you can do with it.

29
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.440
And then content, as you see here,

30
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.770
I didn't even need to put the id
of flakes or the class of snowman.

31
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.370
I could have targeted this whole
thing without classes or ids.

32
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.250
You can use CSS no matter
what your HTML is like.

33
00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:16.420
&gt;&gt; Estelle: There's a few
ways to include your CSS.

34
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.960
You can do an external style sheet.

35
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.260
Generally this is considered
the best way to include your CSS.

36
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.020
If you wanna improve performance and
your CSS is minimal, and

37
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.690
hopefully I will teach you how to
make minimal CSS instead of long CSS.

38
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.050
You can improve performance by
putting some of you CSS in the style

39
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.498
block in a head of your page because
your CSS, your external CSS and

40
00:02:41.498 --> 00:02:46.750
your internal CSS is block view, it will
not present until your CSS is downloaded.

41
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.960
So if it's already downloaded, your CSS,
instead of having to make another HTTP

42
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.790
request, that could help
improve first load.

43
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.415
But if you have to download the CSS
every single time you change pages,

44
00:02:57.415 --> 00:03:01.470
that is bad for performance.

45
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.349
So you have to weigh it, you could put
a little bit of CSS on your home page for

46
00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.613
that first load, but
always have an external style sheet if you

47
00:03:08.613 --> 00:03:11.653
have a multi-page website
because you wanna cache that.

48
00:03:11.653 --> 00:03:17.520
And then you can do inline styles
like the one on the bottom.

49
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.533
You'd be wrong to do that.

50
00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:23.024
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Not that I

51
00:03:23.024 --> 00:03:23.654
have an opinion on it.

52
00:03:23.654 --> 00:03:26.174
A lot of times you'll see this, and

53
00:03:26.174 --> 00:03:29.628
it will be because it was
put in with JavaScript.

54
00:03:29.628 --> 00:03:33.988
You'll see it actually in my decks because
I was in the middle of something and

55
00:03:33.988 --> 00:03:38.590
I'm like, let me just add this and
test it and I forgot to pull it out.

56
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.250
But my deck is not a production-ready
website, it is a PowerPoint presentation.

57
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.260
And my decks are much smaller than any
PowerPoint presentation you will ever see

58
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.780
because it is done purely in CSS,
HTML, and JavaScript.

59
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.162
In fact, the only images that
you've seen so far in this whole

60
00:03:56.162 --> 00:04:00.406
deck are the pictures of my book covers,
everything else is just purely CSS.

61
00:04:02.683 --> 00:04:05.640
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So
why use external style sheets?

62
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.150
It allows for
reusability cuz you can cache it.

63
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.260
You can maintain your CSS if it's on one
spot, if it's in every different page,

64
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.530
you have to actually edit.

65
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.195
If it's in every individual p element,

66
00:04:19.195 --> 00:04:22.710
like we saw on that inline,
you'll have to maintain that.

67
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.500
If it's in your Java Script,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: How do you maintain?

68
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.990
I don't know how to maintain CSS in
JavaScript cuz you have to keep going back

69
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.510
to your JavaScript when you wanna
change a color or something.

70
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.736
With CSS the changes are instantaneous,
and

71
00:04:38.736 --> 00:04:42.311
we'll see that a lot during our deck
because we are gonna be editing a lot

72
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:45.783
of CSS right in the header of a document
and it will load immediately.

73
00:04:45.783 --> 00:04:49.928
And I've no clue what interchangeable
presentation layer is cuz I wrote this

74
00:04:49.928 --> 00:04:53.410
a few weeks ago and
I don't remember what that meant.

75
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.170
Okay, so here is the CSS thing
code that I had wanted to show.

76
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.528
And that was the exact same HTML, this
site has the exact same HTML as this site.

77
00:05:02.528 --> 00:05:07.060
Do those two look like the same pages?

78
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.250
The content is the exact same,
the markup is the exact same.

79
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.920
It's only the presentation
file that is different.

80
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.897
And that is why using
external CSS style sheets, or

81
00:05:16.897 --> 00:05:21.412
just using CSS in general allows you to
do the look and feel that you so choose.
