00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.010
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Radial gradients have
two things in common with the linear

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.374
gradients, which are color-stops and
color-hints.

3
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.090
&gt;&gt; Estelle: The thing to remember
in terms of the position is

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.669
you wanna use the at keyword.

5
00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:22.361
The position that you're declaring is
the center point of your radial gradient,

6
00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:24.684
the center of the circle or the ellipse.

7
00:00:28.443 --> 00:00:31.943
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And
if the size it specifies as a circle, or

8
00:00:31.943 --> 00:00:37.240
if it's omitted,
the length can be a length or percent.

9
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.310
So let's look here at this,
this is the default.

10
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.952
By default,
a background gradient that is radial,

11
00:00:44.952 --> 00:00:49.354
just like linear, will be at the center,
it'll be centered.

12
00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:53.428
Here we're going, we're saying an ellipse
at center, default is ellipse,

13
00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:54.610
default is at center.

14
00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:01.071
And then I say palegoldenrod at 0% and
rebeccapurple at 100%.

15
00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:08.127
&gt;&gt; Estelle: If I said at 25, 25, rather,

16
00:01:15.037 --> 00:01:16.184
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Or at 5.

17
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.671
&gt;&gt; Estelle: One of the other things is
that it basically has the same aspect

18
00:01:24.671 --> 00:01:26.780
ratio as the parent.

19
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.620
So the aspect ratio of my gradient,
it's basically in this corner right here.

20
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.882
And if I actually do 0,
0, the palegoldenrod,

21
00:01:35.882 --> 00:01:39.850
it will be right here, it's palegoldenrod.

22
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.204
Right here at the farthest
corner it's rebeccapurple, and

23
00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:48.388
the gradient line
basically goes like that.

24
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.278
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So in terms of position,
you can use the same values

25
00:01:55.278 --> 00:01:59.918
as the background-position property
that we used earlier today.

26
00:01:59.918 --> 00:02:02.527
You wanna include the at key
term in front of it, though.

27
00:02:02.527 --> 00:02:07.821
With background-position on background
images, we don't include the at, right?

28
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:11.179
But in the radial gradient,
when you're declaring the radial gradient,

29
00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:14.432
you can also add a background-position
to the radial gradient and say,

30
00:02:14.432 --> 00:02:17.009
I want this radial gradient
background image to be here.

31
00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:20.236
But within the syntax of the radial
gradient, you're using the at key term.

32
00:02:23.444 --> 00:02:26.410
&gt;&gt; Estelle: There are no angles
because it's a circle, right?

33
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.440
So it's going around, or
it's an ellipse that's going around.

34
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.860
So it's called a gradient ray,
not a gradient line.

35
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.000
So let's talk about the position.

36
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.440
This little black dot,
you see how it says black 1%, 1%.

37
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.017
So it's gonna go black from 0 to 1%.

38
00:02:45.017 --> 00:02:48.515
And the midpoint, there,
it's a solid black circle,

39
00:02:48.515 --> 00:02:53.297
wherever the midpoint is of my gradient,
and that's where it's gonna be.

40
00:02:53.297 --> 00:02:54.550
So play along with this.

41
00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.088
If I move it to the 25% mark, it's 25%
from the left and 95% from the top.

42
00:03:01.088 --> 00:03:04.522
And here we're gonna change it to 15%,
the top.

43
00:03:04.522 --> 00:03:08.468
And you can see that that
gradient changed, right?

44
00:03:08.468 --> 00:03:11.640
There's definitely more
purple here in the center.

45
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.294
So the position is within the background
image size that you have.

46
00:03:19.294 --> 00:03:26.302
So if we actually said background-size 300

47
00:03:26.302 --> 00:03:31.390
pixels by 400 pixels, right?

48
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.128
Background,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Actually,

49
00:03:39.128 --> 00:03:41.485
let's make it 400 by 300,
cuz this looks ugly.

50
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.309
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And
I know I wanna make things look ugly,

51
00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:50.632
but not that ugly, background-repeat.

52
00:03:54.498 --> 00:03:58.359
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay, so
I'm just gonna have a single one.

53
00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.113
And then I'm just gonna add
background-position and

54
00:04:03.113 --> 00:04:07.241
put it in the bottom right,
so we can look at it,

55
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:13.664
background-position: 100%,
100%, and I spelled it wrong.

56
00:04:13.664 --> 00:04:17.586
Okay, so
there's my gradient in the bottom corner,

57
00:04:17.586 --> 00:04:22.468
it's a background image that
is 400 by 300 pixels, right,

58
00:04:22.468 --> 00:04:26.062
it's 400 pixels wide, 300 pixels tall.

59
00:04:26.062 --> 00:04:29.645
If we remember from
the background-position property,

60
00:04:29.645 --> 00:04:33.959
the bottom right hand corner of
the background-image is in the bottom

61
00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:36.120
right hand corner of the parent.

62
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.320
That's just background-position.

63
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.570
But in terms of the ellipse itself,

64
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.695
the center of the ellipse
is 25% from the left and

65
00:04:44.695 --> 00:04:50.540
15% from the top of that background-image
size, whatever that size was, right?

66
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:57.067
We could make it 500 and 400.

67
00:04:57.067 --> 00:05:00.213
It's gonna move to be within that,
but I wanna put it down here so

68
00:05:00.213 --> 00:05:01.395
we can actually see it.

69
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.693
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I could do circle,
and you can barely see a change.

70
00:05:10.693 --> 00:05:15.260
But if I did a background-size 600,

71
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.760
now let's do 800, right?

72
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:25.280
Circle, ellipse,
do you see the difference?

73
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.006
This one's really long, and not that tall.

74
00:05:31.183 --> 00:05:36.856
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay, and let's do it
at the 50% mark from the top and

75
00:05:36.856 --> 00:05:39.550
then change it to circle.

76
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.250
So here you could see that that ellipse
is a really long ellipse, right?

77
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:50.040
If I do circle, see it's rounder, it's
not going all the way off to the right.

78
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.269
I mean, it is actually going
off all the way to the right,

79
00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:55.977
like this is where the 100% mark is, okay.

80
00:05:57.491 --> 00:06:01.683
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So
we kinda did position already.

81
00:06:01.683 --> 00:06:05.310
You can actually use the four-point
background-position.

82
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.691
Remember when we were
talking about the four,

83
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:14.769
when you could say 15 pixels bottom,
or right 10 pixels, bottom 10 pixels.

84
00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:21.025
So with gradients, you can actually use
that four-point background position.

85
00:06:21.025 --> 00:06:24.448
So yeah, it can be used not just
in background-position, but

86
00:06:24.448 --> 00:06:26.717
in actual the position of your gradient.
