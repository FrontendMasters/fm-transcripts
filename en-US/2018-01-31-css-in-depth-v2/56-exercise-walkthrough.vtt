00:00:02.453 --> 00:00:06.352
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So while we were taking
a break I created this beautiful or

2
00:00:06.352 --> 00:00:10.350
hideous grid, depending on your opinion.

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.677
So to do it, what I did was I displayed
grid and then I used the grid

4
00:00:15.677 --> 00:00:20.729
template columns to define
the width of my columns in order.

5
00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:24.520
So the first one is 10 pixels wide,
the second one is twice that at 20 pixels.

6
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.966
Then 40 pixels, then 80 pixels,
then 160, then 320, then 640.

7
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:33.890
That means that there
are seven columns across.

8
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.507
Had I added one more, or
let's just reduce one,

9
00:00:39.507 --> 00:00:43.902
then it would go longer at the bottom.

10
00:00:43.902 --> 00:00:48.751
Or if I had added one more,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It would go

11
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:51.961
shorter because there's now seven.

12
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:56.755
So however many widths or sizes rather,

13
00:00:56.755 --> 00:01:01.843
that I declare
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: In the grid

14
00:01:01.843 --> 00:01:07.505
template columns, that's how many columns
there's going to be as I go across.

15
00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:11.265
Unless I position another one
outside of that bounding box and

16
00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:15.325
then the gird will grow, and
we'll show you how to do that in a bit.

17
00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:20.082
In terms of the rows, I declared
similarly, 10 pixels high, 20 pixels,

18
00:01:20.082 --> 00:01:23.774
40 pixels, 80 pixels, 160, 320, and 640.

19
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.152
And as you see each grid down here, each
row is twice as high as the previous one.

20
00:01:32.152 --> 00:01:39.030
And I would need one extra list
item here to actually fill that in.

21
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.907
So I only have 35 list item, and
here I'm declaring 6 values.

22
00:01:44.907 --> 00:01:46.380
So I have room for 36.

23
00:01:48.765 --> 00:01:53.608
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I'll show you
how to position one of them into

24
00:01:53.608 --> 00:01:56.420
that spot in a little bit.

25
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.111
Then I said list style type nine because
I was actually using list items.

26
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:06.591
And I didn't want to have the numbers
there, because that's ugly.

27
00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:09.531
And then I've added a group
gap of 20 pixels so

28
00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:12.923
between each row and
each column there is 20 pixels.

29
00:02:12.923 --> 00:02:17.480
And just to show that live I can bring
it down to 10 I can bring it up to 30.

30
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.838
I happen to think that
it looks best at 20.

31
00:02:26.634 --> 00:02:30.392
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then I got rid
of the numbers because originally I

32
00:02:30.392 --> 00:02:35.090
had put numbers in each one and
it didn't look very good.

33
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.282
So I'd count it originally.

34
00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:42.980
So that's what I did,
lets check the grid steps trying it out.
