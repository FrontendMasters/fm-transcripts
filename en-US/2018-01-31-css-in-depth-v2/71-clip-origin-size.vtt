00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.921
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Then we
have background-clip and

2
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:06.420
background-origin property.

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.070
So the background-clip is where
do you start your background.

4
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.504
So here, the background color
on all of these is blue, but

5
00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:21.638
the first one has
a background-clip of content-box.

6
00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:25.526
And so that means the background
color is just starting in

7
00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:29.090
the content-box because
this has actual padding,

8
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.474
there's padding from the inside
of the border to the blue area.

9
00:00:33.474 --> 00:00:38.770
The padding boxes make the content and
the padding have the background.

10
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.960
And the border-box says, actually include
the background even underneath the border.

11
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.653
So right here, I have a dotted border,
so that you can see it.

12
00:00:47.653 --> 00:00:51.133
But normally,
you would have a solid border and

13
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:54.791
you might actually be
missing part of your image.

14
00:00:54.791 --> 00:00:57.470
So if your image is,
if you have a border on an element and

15
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.833
you have an image that supposed to
start in the upper left hand corner,

16
00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:04.836
you wanna use padding-box cuz otherwise
your background is gonna start up there.

17
00:01:10.982 --> 00:01:12.815
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The background
image is missing on this, so

18
00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:14.590
I can't actually show you.

19
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.366
But it's basically the background origin,

20
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:21.100
is when you have what is the origin
of your background image.

21
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.024
Here, the image would start right up here.

22
00:01:25.024 --> 00:01:30.441
In this one, in padding-box,
the image would start within the padding.

23
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:35.497
And in content-box, the image would
actually start in 10 pixels from the,

24
00:01:35.497 --> 00:01:38.724
or 20 pixels from
the upper left-hand corner.

25
00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:41.110
Unfortunately, this image failed.

26
00:01:43.215 --> 00:01:45.050
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And here we have it so
we can show it to you.

27
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.510
So let's play with it so you get a sense.

28
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.420
And you can actually change this to dashed
if that is easier for you to look at.

29
00:01:57.456 --> 00:01:59.290
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
let's add a background color.

30
00:02:04.908 --> 00:02:06.959
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, that is hideous.

31
00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.868
But we're basically saying
the background-origin started at

32
00:02:10.868 --> 00:02:12.031
the border-box.

33
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:15.404
Well, why don't we just
start it at padding-box?

34
00:02:20.185 --> 00:02:21.481
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There is no padding.

35
00:02:26.676 --> 00:02:28.103
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I just couldn't see it,
okay.

36
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.420
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So the background-clip
is basically the background color.

37
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.999
Here, I've clipped it at
the end of the padding-box.

38
00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:41.629
Here, I clipped it nowhere.

39
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.830
And here, I clipped it at the content-box.

40
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.995
Now, if I take the origin of that image
and I bring it up into the upper left-hand

41
00:02:51.995 --> 00:02:57.083
corner by changing it to border, part of
my image is cut off, because it's not

42
00:02:57.083 --> 00:03:02.353
actually drawing the background image
where it's not drawing the background.

43
00:03:02.353 --> 00:03:03.697
Does this make sense to people?

44
00:03:03.697 --> 00:03:08.687
So you have background-clip,
and background-origin.

45
00:03:08.687 --> 00:03:11.392
The origin,
think of it as an image origin.

46
00:03:11.392 --> 00:03:14.247
And the clip,
think of it as the background color.

47
00:03:17.451 --> 00:03:19.512
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,
then we have background size.

48
00:03:19.512 --> 00:03:23.589
And I don't know why I chose something so
hideous.

49
00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:25.975
Yeah, cuz we're making ugly stuff today.

50
00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:29.850
But my slide decks are prettier
today than they were yesterday.

51
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.857
So background size, we have a few values.

52
00:03:32.857 --> 00:03:34.436
We have auto, which is the default.

53
00:03:34.436 --> 00:03:39.236
It's just make the background size
the size that the image was naturally.

54
00:03:39.236 --> 00:03:46.573
In terms of performance, that is
the fastest because it doesn't have to,

55
00:03:46.573 --> 00:03:51.123
it doesn't have to,
I forgot the word for it.

56
00:03:51.123 --> 00:03:52.477
I'll figure it out later.

57
00:03:52.477 --> 00:03:54.258
Basically it doesn't have to parse it.

58
00:03:54.258 --> 00:03:56.145
It parses it once and this is the image.

59
00:03:56.145 --> 00:03:57.759
It doesn't have to parse and
recalculate it.

60
00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:00.585
And that is not the right term, but
I can't think of the right term right now.

61
00:04:00.585 --> 00:04:07.486
So basically, background-size
auto is the natural size of it.

62
00:04:07.486 --> 00:04:09.127
And then you can also say length.

63
00:04:09.127 --> 00:04:14.431
So if I say make
the background 150 pixels,

64
00:04:14.431 --> 00:04:21.200
well, I basically had
a gradient with a circle in it.

65
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.491
So it's repeating,
the circle stay in the same size.

66
00:04:30.678 --> 00:04:34.290
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And this is a bad example
because the circle is actually growing.

67
00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:38.490
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We'll do
a different one later on.

68
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.253
So basically you're saying,

69
00:04:40.253 --> 00:04:44.812
I want my background image to be 140
pixels by 140 pixels instead of auto.

70
00:04:44.812 --> 00:04:47.824
And so it'll take your 10
pixel by 10 pixel image and

71
00:04:47.824 --> 00:04:50.399
it'll make it 140 pixels by 140 pixels.

72
00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:53.553
If you say,
I wanna make it 10 pixels by 10 pixels,

73
00:04:53.553 --> 00:04:57.959
and it was actually 150 pixels by
150 pixels, it will shrink it down.

74
00:04:57.959 --> 00:05:01.483
Then we have two other values
called cover and contain.

75
00:05:04.674 --> 00:05:09.796
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So here is a shark,
this was the original

76
00:05:09.796 --> 00:05:16.737
shark from SpeciFISHity,
and right now, it is auto.

77
00:05:18.326 --> 00:05:20.047
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Here it is contained.

78
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:28.100
What that means is that I've taken the
image and I've made it fit into the box.

79
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.930
So it'll either shrink or grow.

80
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.330
If it was too small, it will actually
go from end to end, but it will fit

81
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.290
one dimension, whichever dimension,
but it will maintain its aspect ratio.

82
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.141
You can also say cover, which will make
it grow to take up at least 100% of it.

83
00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:50.690
But it will maintain in its aspect ratio,
right?

84
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.006
So here, the ends are cut off.

85
00:05:55.861 --> 00:05:59.748
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Here, it's shrunk.

86
00:05:59.748 --> 00:06:03.132
However, if it was too small,
it would have actually grown to be bigger.

87
00:06:03.132 --> 00:06:06.144
And then this one says 100
pixels by 200 pixels, and

88
00:06:06.144 --> 00:06:10.013
I've lost my aspect ratio,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Right?

89
00:06:10.013 --> 00:06:13.327
So you can say,
if I had just said 100 pixels wide,

90
00:06:13.327 --> 00:06:16.066
it would have maintained its aspect ratio.

91
00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:21.101
But since I declared two lengths, the
width, and the height, it just listened

92
00:06:21.101 --> 00:06:26.311
to what I had to say, and it didn't care
what the original image aspect ratio was.
