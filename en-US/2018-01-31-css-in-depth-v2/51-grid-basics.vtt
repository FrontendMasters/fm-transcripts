00:00:02.732 --> 00:00:05.580
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So to better
understand grids, we have terminology.

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.697
A grid line is a line
basically in the gutter.

3
00:00:11.697 --> 00:00:14.912
There's one on the left of the grid,
there's one on the right of the grid, and

4
00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:17.080
then there's one between each row and
each column.

5
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.568
There's one on top and
there's one on the bottom.

6
00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:21.912
So if you have a three-by-three grid,
you actually

7
00:00:21.912 --> 00:00:26.312
have four lines going vertically and
four lines going horizontally.

8
00:00:26.312 --> 00:00:29.741
A grid cell is any cell,
such as the number 10.

9
00:00:33.494 --> 00:00:36.590
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: A grid area,
is a space basically,

10
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.489
I have no clue what a grid area is.

11
00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.256
It's basically when you say this area here
because you can give certain things names,

12
00:00:45.256 --> 00:00:47.794
and we're gonna cover that later on.

13
00:00:47.794 --> 00:00:51.122
A grid track is either a grid row or
a grid column.

14
00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:57.200
It's any area between two grid lines,
vertically or horizontally.

15
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.040
So grid row is one that's horizontal.

16
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.084
And a grid column is one that's vertical.

17
00:01:03.084 --> 00:01:08.013
And then the gutter is the grid gap
that's in between here, that white space.

18
00:01:08.013 --> 00:01:12.600
I'm gonna just open this up
in the debugger right here.

19
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.216
So this is the grid gap here.

20
00:01:14.216 --> 00:01:15.973
This is a grid cell.

21
00:01:15.973 --> 00:01:19.467
7 through 12 is a grid row.

22
00:01:19.467 --> 00:01:24.693
2 through 20, or there might be
some below, is a grid column.

23
00:01:24.693 --> 00:01:28.720
And then the grid line is this line on
the left, the line in between here,

24
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.815
the line between here, the line between
3 and 4, the line between 4 and

25
00:01:32.815 --> 00:01:36.607
5, the line between 5 and 6, and
the line right after number 6.

26
00:01:36.607 --> 00:01:37.886
So that's a grid line.

27
00:01:41.732 --> 00:01:43.492
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
let's see, is it ready?

28
00:01:43.492 --> 00:01:50.566
Let's check can I use and
have it not work for us.

29
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:54.892
So can I use,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And if we go to grid,

30
00:01:54.892 --> 00:01:56.723
look at all that beautiful green.

31
00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:04.153
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It dropped into
production, I think, on October 17th in

32
00:02:04.153 --> 00:02:08.436
MS Edge, and since then it's basically
every single evergreen browser has it.

33
00:02:08.436 --> 00:02:15.890
Older versions of IE, so if I show all
of them, have an older syntax of grid.

34
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.007
So you can actually use grid
with all of the Edge and

35
00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:25.318
starting with IE10, but
it has a slightly different syntax.

36
00:02:25.318 --> 00:02:27.108
I'm not gonna cover that syntax today.

37
00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.551
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
the properties we've seen so

38
00:02:36.551 --> 00:02:40.925
far are the display element with grid,
or we can have in-line grid.

39
00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:44.960
We've shown grid-template-columns,
which you might not have noticed, but

40
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.352
that was basically determining
the size of the different columns.

41
00:02:48.352 --> 00:02:51.538
We created a grid-gap,
there was room between the gaps.

42
00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:56.768
On the child, we placed that pink
element using grid-columns and grid-row.

43
00:02:56.768 --> 00:03:00.679
And we also had two new values that
you may have never seen before.

44
00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:04.260
For the grid-template-columns,

45
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.041
we had use a unit called fr,
and we had repeated some stuff.

46
00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:12.094
So we are gonna cover
all of that right now.

47
00:03:12.094 --> 00:03:15.320
So first,
let's start by setting up the grid.

48
00:03:17.142 --> 00:03:23.092
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: To set up the grid,
we have properties that are on the parent.

49
00:03:23.092 --> 00:03:24.434
We have the display property.

50
00:03:24.434 --> 00:03:29.546
We have the display template-columns,
which says basically the width of

51
00:03:29.546 --> 00:03:34.833
all the columns, grid-template-rows
which is the height of all the rows.

52
00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:39.297
We have a shorthand for it,
which is grid-template.

53
00:03:39.297 --> 00:03:43.183
And then we can have a grid-column-gap,
a grid-row-gap.

54
00:03:43.183 --> 00:03:46.470
Which there's a shorthand and
you can just say grid-gap and

55
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.124
that does the vertical and
horizontal spacing.

56
00:03:49.124 --> 00:03:53.007
In Grid, all of your vertical gaps
are gonna be the same size and

57
00:03:53.007 --> 00:03:57.131
all of your horizontal gaps are gonna
be the same length, as well.

58
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:59.204
But those could be two different lengths.

59
00:03:59.204 --> 00:04:04.644
But you can't have and you probably don't
want different sized gaps between things.

60
00:04:06.228 --> 00:04:08.111
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
we're gonna cover those first,

61
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:10.433
and then we're gonna cover grid items, and

62
00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:14.275
then we're gonna cover the other
properties of how to align whole rows.
