00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:02.890
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay, so a color-stop.

2
00:00:05.894 --> 00:00:10.900
A color-stop is basically when you
give it a color and that's it, or

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.200
you give it a color and a unit as to
where that color should be located.

4
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.179
By default the first one will be at 0%,
and the second one will be at 100%.

5
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.740
You can provide it with any length unit or
any percent and

6
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.270
the percent is relative to the gradient
line which is relevant to the image size.

7
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.107
So when were talking about image sizes and
we can make an image 30 pixels

8
00:00:36.107 --> 00:00:40.960
by 30 pixels, that means that
100% would be 30 pixels, right?

9
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.422
It's not 100% of the parent, it's 100%
of the image in which it finds itself.

10
00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:51.710
If you omit the 0 in 100%, it will
be evenly distributed between them.

11
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.200
If you wanna make a hard stop,

12
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.750
like a hard line, you can actually put
two color stops on the exact same point.

13
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.643
And we'll basically say
the gradient will be there but

14
00:01:02.643 --> 00:01:06.370
over 0 pixels, and so
it will look like a hard stop.

15
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:14.515
And if you really do wanna keep your
color stops in order from 0 to 100% or

16
00:01:14.515 --> 00:01:21.005
from 0 pixels to 1,000 pixels or
whatever you're going to do.

17
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:23.088
There is a way it will not
fail if you don't do that,

18
00:01:23.088 --> 00:01:25.370
it will just not have the effect
that you're thinking.

19
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:34.060
So in this example, we're using vh units,
vh is the view-port height.

20
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.950
So the view-port is 100% of the window.

21
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.270
And in this case since I'm actually
in this little frame, it's the page.

22
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.730
It's from the top of that slide
to the bottom of this slide,

23
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.140
not from the top of the screen
to the bottom of the screen.

24
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.170
So here I'm saying linear gradient
at the 0% mark, make it red.

25
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.150
At the 20% mark,
which is 20 vh,make it orange.

26
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.120
And basically make it a gradient from
red to orange over the 20% of the page.

27
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.080
And then at the 40%, make it yellow.

28
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.440
So make it a gradient from orange
to yellow over 20% of the page.

29
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.680
So at the 0 pixel mark,
it's actually red, and

30
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.220
at the 100% mark, it's actually purple.

31
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.710
But you basically just have one pixel
line where it's actually blue and

32
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.340
one pixel line where it's actually green.

33
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.960
The rest is just a gradient going
from one color to the next.

34
00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:35.870
&gt;&gt; Estelle: That's the length unit.

35
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.569
Here, we're using percentages, and then,

36
00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.676
I change the background size
to 50% just to show and

37
00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:50.902
I could change it to 30% and I could
change it to 20, and make it really ugly.

38
00:02:50.902 --> 00:02:55.552
[SOUND] I think we should
put this on all websites and

39
00:02:55.552 --> 00:02:58.882
I think we should make it to-left.

40
00:03:01.363 --> 00:03:01.863
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Yeah.

41
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.530
This is why I'm not
allowed do art direction.

42
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.780
So here,
let's just put it back to top to bottom,

43
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.370
if I had done a 100% here, it is literally
you can see where the lines meet,

44
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.510
it is the exact same thing
as the previous one, right?

45
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.430
Cuz the VH unit's in 100% cuz
it's the entire document.

46
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.758
But when this was 50%, right?

47
00:03:34.758 --> 00:03:39.492
It was not the entire document,
it's only 50%.

48
00:03:39.492 --> 00:03:44.935
And here, oops,
if I go back to this one and

49
00:03:44.935 --> 00:03:52.240
I do background-size,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: 50%.

50
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.210
I don't actually get any purples,
because my purple is at the 100 vh mark.

51
00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.655
And at the 100 vh mark,

52
00:03:59.655 --> 00:04:03.549
I'm actually repeating a linear
gradient that was only 50 vh high.

53
00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:04.458
Does that make sense to people?

54
00:04:08.713 --> 00:04:13.242
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I'm gonna do just one more
thing here, I'm gonna change this to 100%.

55
00:04:13.242 --> 00:04:16.757
And you can see where that mid-point
is on that previous slide,

56
00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:21.028
its the same the top after the same but
I repeated it on the left-hand-side.

57
00:04:21.028 --> 00:04:26.963
So anyway,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Percentages

58
00:04:26.963 --> 00:04:34.169
is of whatever size the background image
is, that was the point of this slide.

59
00:04:36.494 --> 00:04:40.251
&gt;&gt; Estelle: If you have no 0% or 100%, so

60
00:04:40.251 --> 00:04:45.433
here I've just said I want
the orange to start at

61
00:04:45.433 --> 00:04:51.020
the 20 view port height point or
the 20% mark.

62
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.000
I could just change this to 20% as well,
same thing in this case.

63
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.410
So right here for the first 20%,
it's solid orange.

64
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.940
I don't have a 100% mark,
I say blue at 80 viewpoint heights.

65
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.630
So from this point here,

66
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.200
which is the 80 viewpoint height
mark to the end, it's blue.

67
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:20.330
It's as if I did blue 100% vh, right?

68
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.344
Because when there is no 0% and no 100%,

69
00:05:23.344 --> 00:05:26.976
if you don't have a percentage or
a length on the color,

70
00:05:26.976 --> 00:05:31.900
so the color-stop has just been cleared,
then it will be 0 and 100%.

71
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.040
But here I've declared it at 20% and
80 view port height, or

72
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.161
let's just change it to 80%.

73
00:05:39.745 --> 00:05:40.559
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Right?

74
00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:45.150
So from 80% to 100% mark, it will be
solid of whatever that last color was.

75
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.260
From the zero to the first color is gonna
be solid of whatever that color is.

76
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.078
So that's what happens when
you don't have endpoints.

77
00:05:52.762 --> 00:05:56.189
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Next,
I'm gonna show you duplicate of values for

78
00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:59.500
color-stop which means a hard stop.

79
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.200
So here, I go from zero to
the 20% mark and make it red.

80
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.159
And then at the 20% mark I say orange, so

81
00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:12.979
these two are at the exact
same point in time.

82
00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.864
So the red goes from 0 to 20%,
in red percent,

83
00:06:15.864 --> 00:06:18.214
it's 0 to 20 viewport height in red.

84
00:06:18.214 --> 00:06:22.130
And then the gradient is
over 0 pixels to orange.

85
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.250
And from orange it starts going
a gradient from yellow to green to blue.

86
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.770
And then blue ends at the 80vh mark,
and purple starts at the 80vh mark.

87
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.190
So we have a hard stop again.

88
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:41.806
I could also do,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Let's just change this to 60,

89
00:06:41.806 --> 00:06:45.274
and now you see at the yellow to
degree mark, I have a hard stop again.

90
00:06:49.111 --> 00:06:51.771
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Here,
I did all the ones in duplicate, so

91
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:56.570
that you could see at the 20% mark,
I changed from red to orange.

92
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.028
At the 40% mark,
it changed from orange to yellow.

93
00:06:59.028 --> 00:07:02.630
At the 60% mark, I changed from
yellow to green, and at the 80% mark,

94
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.720
I changed from green to blue.

95
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.150
So those are hard color stops.

96
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.890
And that's done by
duplicating the color-stop.

97
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.440
Now, it should be sequential, because
here you'll see that I went out of order.

98
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.480
So, I say red from 0% to 20%, and

99
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.654
then I have a gradient from
the 20% mark to the 50% mark

100
00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:30.646
where it goes from red to orange,
but then I have yellow.

101
00:07:34.728 --> 00:07:36.052
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So it basically says,

102
00:07:36.052 --> 00:07:39.480
put yellow at the 50% mark
because it wasn't in order.

103
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.670
If I changed this to 50%,
you see nothing changed.

104
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.161
So it basically says, you idiot,

105
00:07:47.161 --> 00:07:53.781
I can't do this correctly,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: We're

106
00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:58.530
just going to pretend that you said 50%.

107
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.570
It used to be in the old syntax,

108
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.790
you could actually have it out of order,
now you can't.

109
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.370
It's not gonna break, right?

110
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.910
Nothing broke, It didn't say,
my God, I'm not gonna work for you.

111
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.597
It just said this is how
I'm gonna handle it.

112
00:08:12.751 --> 00:08:14.297
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay, negative values.

113
00:08:14.297 --> 00:08:16.650
So I have two gradients right here.

114
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.886
There's one, the first one,
is only 5% wide, and

115
00:08:23.886 --> 00:08:27.200
the second one has a negative value.

116
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.730
And it was just to compare and
contrast the two.

117
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:36.389
So if I change this to zero,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And

118
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:41.220
I change this to a 100,
they'll be the exact same, right?

119
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:46.100
But I move the purple mark,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I move the purple

120
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.620
mark off the page so
it doesn't get to your backup purple.

121
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:55.097
I mean, it doesn't get to palegoldenrod,
rather,

122
00:08:55.097 --> 00:08:58.872
until you are halfway to the floor, right?

123
00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:03.198
And now,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: It is rebeccapurple, but

124
00:09:03.198 --> 00:09:05.890
it's rebeccapurple off the screen.

125
00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.350
So you can actually use negative values,
it's not gonna break,

126
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.030
it's just gonna extend the gradient.

127
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.780
It's just, you're not gonna
be able to see the gradient.

128
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:19.228
So, let's just do background-position.

129
00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:40.640
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Yeah,
let's get rid of this one,

130
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.300
cuz we already saw the comparison, right?

131
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.582
We don't need it anymore.

132
00:09:47.588 --> 00:09:49.552
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I was wondering if I moved it,

133
00:09:57.351 --> 00:10:01.356
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Background position

134
00:10:01.356 --> 00:10:06.700
250px 250px, okay.

135
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.350
So it actually cuts it off,

136
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.120
you don't actually ever get
to see that rebeccapurple.

137
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.317
I thought it would actually
extend beyond and it didn't.
