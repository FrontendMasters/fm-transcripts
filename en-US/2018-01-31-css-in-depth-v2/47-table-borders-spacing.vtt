00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:06.925
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Borders and spacing.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So

2
00:00:06.925 --> 00:00:12.213
let me just go back here in borders so
you can see what a border does.

3
00:00:12.213 --> 00:00:17.165
If I do a border.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: 1px solid that

4
00:00:17.165 --> 00:00:22.511
adds it to the table.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: If I

5
00:00:22.511 --> 00:00:26.490
do th I get it on the t headers and

6
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.322
if I do td it goes everywhere.

7
00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:35.667
You'll notice that there's a bit
of spacing between all of those,

8
00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:40.657
right, so if I wanna add a border
in my CSS I add it to all of them.

9
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.453
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay,

10
00:00:43.453 --> 00:00:46.391
I can control what happens.

11
00:00:46.391 --> 00:00:53.634
There was that border spacing between
the td's, I can either say separate it,

12
00:00:53.634 --> 00:00:58.499
which is the default value,
which is what happened or

13
00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:03.482
I can collapse it.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: That's border-collapse.

14
00:01:03.482 --> 00:01:08.172
Then I have border-spacing, which is if
you did not collapse the borders, right,

15
00:01:08.172 --> 00:01:12.151
if they're separate how much space
between each one of those borders.

16
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:17.121
You can have one to two lengths.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: If

17
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:22.091
you have only one length it will be
both vertical and horizontal spacing.

18
00:01:22.091 --> 00:01:25.876
If you have two lengths in the value,

19
00:01:25.876 --> 00:01:30.161
it will be horizontal and then vertical.

20
00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:34.132
Notice, with this it's not in
the typical order of top, right bottom,

21
00:01:34.132 --> 00:01:39.099
left.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: It's actually left, right and

22
00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.893
then top, bottom so
that's a little bit confusing.

23
00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:45.352
And border-spacing has absolutely no
impact if you've collapsed the borders.

24
00:01:45.352 --> 00:01:49.630
You won't have space between the borders
if you collapse the borders.

25
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.441
The empty space is part of the table
not the column, tbody, trow, or tcell.

26
00:01:56.441 --> 00:02:02.735
So it will actually show up as here,
if I go back here.

27
00:02:02.735 --> 00:02:05.321
Let me just go on to
the next slide instead.

28
00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:10.265
So if you color all the tr's
you'll have the color

29
00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:15.572
only in the table cells and
not in that empty spacing.

30
00:02:15.572 --> 00:02:21.251
So we've added the one
pixel of border already.

31
00:02:21.251 --> 00:02:25.793
And then we have border-spacing
of ten pixels left and

32
00:02:25.793 --> 00:02:29.652
right and five pixels top and
bottom, right.

33
00:02:29.652 --> 00:02:35.020
But note you don't see any spacing and
that's because we have border-collapse.

34
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.513
If we get rid of border-collapse or

35
00:02:37.513 --> 00:02:41.759
set it to it's default of
separate there we have it, right.

36
00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:46.962
Now if I do tr background color

37
00:02:46.962 --> 00:02:51.959
green notice that it's just

38
00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.163
the cells that are background

39
00:02:57.163 --> 00:03:02.171
color not the entire table.

40
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:04.719
So that's the interesting thing to note,

41
00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:08.825
that sometimes you want to use
padding instead of spacing because you

42
00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:13.798
don't want this to happen.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: If I

43
00:03:13.798 --> 00:03:17.519
actually put it on the table you'll
see that the whole thing is green.

44
00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.163
And when I told you we were
going to make ugly websites.

45
00:03:21.663 --> 00:03:23.720
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Congratulations, we succeeded.

46
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.642
Okay, so that is table spacing and

47
00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:31.709
border-collapse.

48
00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.333
Do you want to see the difference
let me get rid of the color green.

49
00:03:35.662 --> 00:03:36.716
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Let me make it pink so

50
00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:41.482
it's less hideous.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And go back to tr.

51
00:03:41.482 --> 00:03:43.793
Okay, and it's equally hideous.

52
00:03:43.793 --> 00:03:46.622
So here because we don't
have border-collapse,

53
00:03:46.622 --> 00:03:50.254
if I got rid of border-collapse,
the whole thing would be pink.

54
00:03:50.254 --> 00:03:56.483
Cuz there wouldn't be
that spacing anymore and

55
00:03:56.483 --> 00:04:03.442
what I would do instead is do th and td.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Padding.

56
00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:05.749
And then I would do five pixels,

57
00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:10.543
ten pixels to have the same effect.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Rght, except for

58
00:04:10.543 --> 00:04:13.770
now I don't have that
extra white in between.

59
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.095
Does that make sense to people?
