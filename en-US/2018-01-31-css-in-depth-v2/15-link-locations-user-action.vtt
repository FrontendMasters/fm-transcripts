00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.728
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, then we have
link location and user actions.

2
00:00:05.728 --> 00:00:08.085
You didn't realize we have so
many selectors did you?

3
00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:13.076
But these you know,
you know link and visited, right?

4
00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:15.490
We were going to have
in selectors level 4,

5
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.720
where we could have how deep is the link.

6
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.038
Which was gonna be local link,
with local link N but that was removed.

7
00:00:23.038 --> 00:00:27.719
But any link is the same
as link in visited,

8
00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:31.634
its basically just match any link.

9
00:00:31.634 --> 00:00:36.067
And you notice that active and

10
00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:40.331
hover is not there, right?

11
00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:42.390
Because those can be on any element,

12
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.053
they're don't have to do with links,
right.

13
00:00:45.053 --> 00:00:47.940
They're usually used on links,
but they're good for buttons, and

14
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.448
when it's comes to hover it
could be anything on your page.

15
00:00:50.448 --> 00:00:53.897
So those your action
uplink pseudo classes.

16
00:00:53.897 --> 00:01:00.070
And that has hover active focus, and
then focus ring, and focus within.

17
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.280
And then drop places, so
these two have always been supported.

18
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.314
Whenever you style active
always do focus and

19
00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:14.976
activate at the same time.

20
00:01:14.976 --> 00:01:18.298
Because some people get to
your page via mouse and

21
00:01:18.298 --> 00:01:21.387
other people get towards
it with a keyboard.

22
00:01:21.387 --> 00:01:22.799
And so if I'm gonna tab,

23
00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.375
I can't tab right now cuz it's
gonna go over to the next slide.

24
00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:31.104
But if I'm going to tab I
wanna know where my tab goes.

25
00:01:31.104 --> 00:01:36.928
Even as a sighted user, when I'm mousing
over something I wanna know where I am.

26
00:01:36.928 --> 00:01:41.934
If I'm tabbing along I wanna know
where I am, I wanna see the progress,

27
00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:46.219
okay.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Wow,

28
00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.635
how do I have two slides in a row
that say almost the same thing?

29
00:01:50.635 --> 00:01:52.581
So then you can bring them together.

30
00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:56.302
So a, visited hover, which is when you
hover over a visited link it can be

31
00:01:56.302 --> 00:01:59.596
a different style than when you
hover over a non-visited link.

32
00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:02.213
Note that visited has limited styles, so

33
00:02:02.213 --> 00:02:06.934
you can't add all the styles to visited
and that was for security reasons.

34
00:02:06.934 --> 00:02:10.205
It came out in Safari 4 or
something like that.

35
00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:14.616
I remember when it came out, but
it's been a long time and the reason was,

36
00:02:14.616 --> 00:02:19.115
you could actually basically ask
the browser what the color is this link.

37
00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:22.744
And then know that the user
had gone to Wells Fargo and

38
00:02:22.744 --> 00:02:25.146
might have a Wells Fargo account.

39
00:02:25.146 --> 00:02:30.222
So for security reasons,
this start in very limited support and

40
00:02:30.222 --> 00:02:34.646
I think 2010, so
that's been around for 7 years.

41
00:02:34.646 --> 00:02:40.624
Button, active and focus and
never do this, I already said why, right?

42
00:02:40.624 --> 00:02:45.857
But same reason, never remove all styling.

43
00:02:45.857 --> 00:02:50.845
You can do outline none if you add lots
of good styles to tell the user that

44
00:02:50.845 --> 00:02:52.019
this has focus.

45
00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.351
Cuz that blue ring is hideous, and
you'll see there's a deck I have

46
00:02:56.351 --> 00:03:00.237
where the next button is an error
in the corner, a triangle.

47
00:03:00.237 --> 00:03:04.364
And when you go over it,
it's square, and it's hideous.

48
00:03:04.364 --> 00:03:07.477
But I did not get rid of the focus ring,
or the outline,

49
00:03:07.477 --> 00:03:11.630
because I want people to know that
they've actually clicked the thing.

50
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.870
And here is an element,

51
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.163
a list of elements,
that can be active if you're interested.

52
00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:19.037
Let's click on that,
open link in new window.

53
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:25.131
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Button inputs, links, or

54
00:03:25.131 --> 00:03:31.814
A's rather, areas, and
links that have an href attribute.

55
00:03:31.814 --> 00:03:36.264
So in your header, that link if you're
gonna block, show it, you can do that.

56
00:03:36.264 --> 00:03:42.209
Okay, drag and drop pseudo classes,
we have drop, drop active, drop valid,

57
00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.447
there should be a parenthesis right after
the valid right here, and drop invalid.

58
00:03:48.447 --> 00:03:53.778
Other pseudo classes, target,
target's a really cool one.

59
00:03:53.778 --> 00:03:57.144
When you put a pound sign like right here,

60
00:03:57.144 --> 00:04:00.806
my current target of
this page is Slide 63.

61
00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:03.641
The browser knows that it's Slide 63.

62
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:09.065
If I had an ID on my slide that said Slide
63 I could actually use it, but I don't.

63
00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:14.112
But let's pretend I do, if I did,
I could actually target

64
00:04:14.112 --> 00:04:19.062
that slide because it had the ID of 63,
the slide 63.

65
00:04:19.062 --> 00:04:25.317
I could target that slide with special,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Look and feel.

66
00:04:25.317 --> 00:04:29.821
I have a deck, and so I told you I would
probably end up showing it to you, so I'm

67
00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:35.556
going to show it to you, estelle.github,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Actually

68
00:04:35.556 --> 00:04:41.516
it's just called wtf.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,

69
00:04:41.516 --> 00:04:46.248
so here's a deck that works, and

70
00:04:46.248 --> 00:04:53.860
there is not a single line
of JavaScript in this deck.

71
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.076
And this one I actually did this way, so

72
00:04:57.076 --> 00:05:02.051
there's a bunch of check marks
throughout the whole deck and

73
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:06.066
I can actually go directly to shapes,
alright.

74
00:05:06.066 --> 00:05:08.736
But I did this two different ways, and

75
00:05:08.736 --> 00:05:13.673
I'm just gonna go to tittle slide
right here, it says, with target.

76
00:05:13.673 --> 00:05:17.297
So this one, when I do next,

77
00:05:17.297 --> 00:05:22.136
it says check box, awesome, right.

78
00:05:22.136 --> 00:05:26.157
That's how I made this have focus,
it basically says,

79
00:05:26.157 --> 00:05:29.762
the current target of the page,
make it visible.

80
00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:33.888
Doesn't matter what that target is,
whatever the target of that page is,

81
00:05:33.888 --> 00:05:34.815
it's visible.

82
00:05:34.815 --> 00:05:38.507
So those are things you
can do with check boxes,

83
00:05:38.507 --> 00:05:41.839
with basically using selectors, right.

84
00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:45.214
I'm selecting things on this page, and

85
00:05:45.214 --> 00:05:50.288
there's not a single line of
JavaScript and the deck works.

86
00:05:50.288 --> 00:05:53.607
And the animation to make them come
in has changed but originally,

87
00:05:53.607 --> 00:05:55.629
it actually even looked better, okay.

88
00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:58.446
So target,
that's one thing you can do with target.

89
00:05:58.446 --> 00:06:05.084
So it's basically when you have an anchor
tag and an anchor matches the ID, right.

90
00:06:05.084 --> 00:06:09.096
So my ID and the problem summary ID and
you'll go to that page,

91
00:06:09.096 --> 00:06:12.043
part of that page so
that's what it matches.

92
00:06:12.043 --> 00:06:20.420
So you can say the first line of a div
element that is the current target,

93
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.757
make it bold, something like that.

94
00:06:24.757 --> 00:06:32.070
So Chris Coyier came up with this one,
which is here, nothing is selected.

95
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.666
But when I select Tab 1,
Tab 2, or Tab 3, Tab 2 or

96
00:06:37.666 --> 00:06:43.697
Tab 1.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I don't

97
00:06:43.697 --> 00:06:49.922
know what happened to the CSS on this but
I'm gonna open it in a new window here.

98
00:06:49.922 --> 00:06:52.084
Yeah, I somehow broke it,
I have no clue how I broke it.

99
00:06:52.084 --> 00:06:57.057
I probably did a global search and
replace for some CSS feature and

100
00:06:57.057 --> 00:06:59.324
broke everything, why not?

101
00:06:59.324 --> 00:07:04.507
Okay, so Tab 1, Tab 2 and
Tab 3, how did I select this?

102
00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:09.883
This is basically says any link that
is the direct child of a section

103
00:07:09.883 --> 00:07:14.588
that is not the target,
make it grey, background color.

104
00:07:14.588 --> 00:07:17.641
2 and 3 are currently not the target.

105
00:07:17.641 --> 00:07:21.629
So they were all white,
I made these two grey.

106
00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:26.557
Then it says the a, that is the target,
make sure the border bottom

107
00:07:26.557 --> 00:07:31.222
color is white because it actually
had a border bottom of grey.

108
00:07:31.222 --> 00:07:34.212
Because you see all of this
has a grey border around it,

109
00:07:34.212 --> 00:07:35.839
it was all four sides before.

110
00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:39.579
So these have all four sides, but
I don't want it to be on all 4 sides.

111
00:07:39.579 --> 00:07:40.673
So just the a,

112
00:07:40.673 --> 00:07:46.623
that is the direct child of the section
that is the current target of the page.

113
00:07:46.623 --> 00:07:53.216
So why did I say direct child?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Because

114
00:07:53.216 --> 00:07:57.925
there's a div here, and
I can have links in here, and

115
00:07:57.925 --> 00:08:01.283
I don't want them to change, right.

116
00:08:01.283 --> 00:08:07.682
So then it says that is the direct
child of the current section target,

117
00:08:07.682 --> 00:08:14.562
given a z-index of negative one.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then the div that is

118
00:08:14.562 --> 00:08:20.168
the child of the section that is not the
child given the z-index of negative two.

119
00:08:20.168 --> 00:08:23.287
So the negative one is in
front of the negative two.

120
00:08:23.287 --> 00:08:27.463
And why negative numbers, because there
might be stuff on the page that needs to

121
00:08:27.463 --> 00:08:30.534
be above it and
I definitely didn't wanna mess with that.

122
00:08:30.534 --> 00:08:34.672
I definitely want the Z index
negative two to be hidden,

123
00:08:34.672 --> 00:08:37.497
it will definitely always be hidden.

124
00:08:37.497 --> 00:08:39.537
So that's how that works,
that's basically target.

125
00:08:39.537 --> 00:08:45.394
So this is Chris Coyier's

126
00:08:45.394 --> 00:08:49.659
magic, not mine.

127
00:08:49.659 --> 00:08:55.421
And this is kind of a weird
one that you don't really,

128
00:08:55.421 --> 00:09:01.963
who knows if it has to do with,
we don't have scopes CSS yet.

129
00:09:01.963 --> 00:09:06.510
But it was basically, if we where going
to have scopes CSS, this would be useful.

130
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:12.052
So just, put it out there so that you know

131
00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:17.443
it's in existence if it ever shows up.

132
00:09:17.443 --> 00:09:21.295
And then we have grid structural
selectors that might be coming and

133
00:09:21.295 --> 00:09:23.374
we're gonna cover grids later on.

134
00:09:23.374 --> 00:09:27.778
But we should at some point be able
to match based on the columns that

135
00:09:27.778 --> 00:09:30.384
they're in because right now in grid.

136
00:09:30.384 --> 00:09:35.531
The things will change locations and
you want to stay in the first column but

137
00:09:35.531 --> 00:09:41.427
you don't know what's in the first column,
so once supported that's what will do.

138
00:09:41.427 --> 00:09:44.857
Then we have Time dimensional,
current, future and past.

139
00:09:44.857 --> 00:09:48.455
And I can't tell you anything about this
because I don't know anything about it

140
00:09:48.455 --> 00:09:50.723
because I don't really work with video or
audio.

141
00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:53.736
So I don't know if this works or not, but

142
00:09:53.736 --> 00:09:58.626
if you are working with video and
audio check to see if this works.

143
00:09:58.626 --> 00:10:02.692
Playing and paused, again,
I don't work with video so

144
00:10:02.692 --> 00:10:07.980
I never needed this but I wanted to put
it out there that it might be there.
