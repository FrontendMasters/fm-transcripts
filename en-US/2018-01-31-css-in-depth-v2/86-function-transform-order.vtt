00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.760
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay, so here, I'm
translating it 90 pixels to the left, and

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.940
200 pixels down.

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.793
Rotating it 15 degrees
from the middle around.

4
00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:16.270
Scaling it, the width 1.5 times as wide,
and twice as tall.

5
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.400
And then I'm skewing it along
the x-axis negative 8 degrees.

6
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.950
How come it doesn't, what would happen
if I actually translated it here?

7
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.640
Or transform and translated it, and
then I transform and rotated it?

8
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.950
This one,
would over write this one, right?

9
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.350
And then this would over this one, and
then this would over write that one.

10
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.050
So if you wanna put multiple in for
right now,

11
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.780
you actually put all of them on one line,
space separated.

12
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.180
Let's hope this works, 100, nope, okay.

13
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.582
I didn't activate this slide.

14
00:00:55.582 --> 00:00:58.610
So you can kinda see through it.

15
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.520
So it says transform,
translate, negative 80 pixels.

16
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.970
Comma 100 pixels, so
that's a translate function.

17
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.748
So it first translates it, and then it
rotates it, and then it scales it, and

18
00:01:09.748 --> 00:01:15.529
then it skews it, in that order.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I'm

19
00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:17.180
gonna cover the order
in a little bit again.

20
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.240
Except for the order is right, that little
slide that's being hidden, there it is,

21
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.420
okay, I'm gonna cover it first.

22
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.242
So transform order is really important.

23
00:01:30.242 --> 00:01:34.127
Because the original area
is that middle blocks,

24
00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:38.300
which is purple, but
kind of looks black for you all.

25
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.840
And there, that's where it was originally.

26
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.860
The green one was translated 200 pixels,
and then rotated 135 degrees.

27
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.600
The pink one was rotated 135 degrees.

28
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.950
So the access about when it was
translated it that went down.

29
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.789
So it's following that
line in terms of the axis.

30
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.550
Okay, so just to go back here.

31
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.651
Take advantage of transform origin,
which we haven't covered yet.

32
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:13.000
Multiple values are SPACE separated,
no commas.

33
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.290
The order of the values matter, we use 3D
transforms that are hardware accelerated,

34
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.900
which means they're put on
the GPU instead of the CPU.

35
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.420
Updates differently.

36
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.042
But it also means that it kind
of has the index of infinity and

37
00:02:30.042 --> 00:02:33.085
you have to basically
translate something else,

38
00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:37.753
hardware accelerated to put it on top
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And

39
00:02:37.753 --> 00:02:42.228
there's a few links for
information on more stuff.

40
00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:46.930
We talked about function order and
let's play with this for a second.

41
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.100
So here, it says,
transform on the rust one,

42
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.200
which is this one,
is translated 200 degrees.

43
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.754
And then, no, the rust one is this one.

44
00:02:56.754 --> 00:02:57.970
I'm sorry I don't know my colors.

45
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.460
It's translated along the x-axis 200
degrees, and then its rotated 135 degrees.

46
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.746
The second one is first rotated, and

47
00:03:07.746 --> 00:03:14.919
then translated.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So

48
00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:19.635
we're just going to change this degree
to whatever we change this degree.

49
00:03:19.635 --> 00:03:25.538
So here, I'm going to rotate it negative

50
00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:30.605
135 degrees, and then 135.

51
00:03:30.605 --> 00:03:34.330
So it was first translated,
it was first rotated and so,

52
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.220
it went along that line,
that line that I just added there.

53
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.288
So you can see where it goes.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And

54
00:03:44.288 --> 00:03:51.898
then, let's do a 95 degrees.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay so,

55
00:03:55.502 --> 00:03:58.647
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Negative 200, okay, so

56
00:03:58.647 --> 00:04:02.640
what I'm gonna do here is this.

57
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.370
So here, I'm going to rotate it
first negative 35 degrees, right?

58
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.017
One second, so now, when I move it,
when I translate it,

59
00:04:15.017 --> 00:04:20.060
it's gonna go along the line here, right?

60
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.930
Let's see if it does that.

61
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.940
It did, so you see how the order matters?

62
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.973
Okay, go ahead.
&gt;&gt; male: I actually think it's

63
00:04:26.973 --> 00:04:27.831
the opposite way.

64
00:04:27.831 --> 00:04:34.120
It's actually rotated in the [COUGH]
rust example, rotation happens first.

65
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.220
But it rotates around the origin.

66
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.165
And then the translation happens next,
so if you move the origin it

67
00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:43.865
would demonstrate-
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So

68
00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:46.050
the origin is something
completely different.

69
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.119
The origin is around where
you wanna rotate it, but

70
00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:50.480
by default it rotates around its center.

71
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.750
So both of these are rotated
in around the center.

72
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.701
So the center of that rust one
is still on that 0 line, right?

73
00:04:58.701 --> 00:05:04.909
The middle of that gold one is
along is on that black line.

74
00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:09.687
So it rotated so
that black line rotated with it,

75
00:05:09.687 --> 00:05:13.424
and then it went along the black line.

76
00:05:13.424 --> 00:05:17.853
So normally, you'll want to translate
first, and than rotate it that's usually

77
00:05:17.853 --> 00:05:21.966
the effect you want and that's why I'm
harping on the second one, because if

78
00:05:21.966 --> 00:05:26.296
you rotate first, and then translate,
it's gonna go in some weird direction.
