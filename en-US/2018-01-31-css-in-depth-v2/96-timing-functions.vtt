00:00:01.741 --> 00:00:04.470
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,
animation-timing-function.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.830
This is probably one of the two
most complex parts of animation,

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.960
and it's also valid for your transitions.

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.860
So I didn't cover this during transitions,
because it's

5
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.390
much easier to see when you're animating
than when you're transitioning.

6
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.640
But there's several different values.

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.076
There's ease, ease-in,
ease-out, step-start, step-end,

8
00:00:25.076 --> 00:00:29.870
linear, ease-out, and
cubic-bezier, and step functions.

9
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.670
So I'm gonna just do linear.

10
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.200
It's going to go across
the page in a linear fashion.

11
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.410
Doesn't change speed,
it's always the same speed.

12
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.938
But if you're doing someone who's
walking or a ball that's dropping,

13
00:00:42.938 --> 00:00:43.980
that doesn't look natural.

14
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.270
When you're dropping a ball,
it actually eases in.

15
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.140
It starts slow and
then it goes faster, right?

16
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.130
If you're a car you start slow and
you go faster.

17
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.609
If you're stopping a car, you stop,
you're going fast and then you slow down.

18
00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.547
So that's ease-out.

19
00:01:03.547 --> 00:01:06.534
ease-in-out would be you start walking and

20
00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:13.332
then you stop walking.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

21
00:01:13.332 --> 00:01:17.388
then there's just ease.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I can't remember

22
00:01:17.388 --> 00:01:18.650
what ease does.

23
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.980
But I did this nifty little thing
where you can just test it.

24
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:31.420
So let's just do ease.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It slows down at the end.

25
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.786
Ease slows down at the end, okay.

26
00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.792
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I have no clue
what that's supposed to do.

27
00:01:54.073 --> 00:01:55.344
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's go back to,

28
00:01:55.344 --> 00:01:57.578
it's cuz there was a delay, I'm sorry.

29
00:01:57.578 --> 00:01:59.550
It was a five second delay for
me to explain something.

30
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.330
So then we have cubic-bezier functions.

31
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.848
What I'm gonna do is go to is I'm
actually gonna go to cubic-bezier.com.

32
00:02:05.848 --> 00:02:09.570
And cubic-bezier.com is
a site done by Lea Verou.

33
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.470
And it's a really easy
way to visualize it.

34
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.046
So there's a default of ease, linear,
ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out,

35
00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:19.430
and you can compare them.

36
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.115
So here I'm going to
compare linear with ease.

37
00:02:31.856 --> 00:02:34.430
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then with ease-in,

38
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.322
and then with ease-out,
and then with ease-in-out.

39
00:02:40.322 --> 00:02:42.818
So you're basically your looking at
the green one to see how it goes.

40
00:02:42.818 --> 00:02:48.537
Then you can take these things and you can
create your own cubic bezier function.

41
00:02:48.537 --> 00:02:52.199
And then what you're gonna do is you're
gonna see that it's gonna go beyond its

42
00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:55.695
bounding box, so the green one's gonna
go a little crazy, or the pink one,

43
00:02:55.695 --> 00:03:00.356
rather.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

44
00:03:00.356 --> 00:03:05.221
if you want to see it a little bit slower,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You see how

45
00:03:05.221 --> 00:03:09.871
it goes beyond its bounding box,
because I gave a cubic-bezier function.

46
00:03:09.871 --> 00:03:13.040
A cubic-bezier function,
it takes four parameters.

47
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.630
The first and the third have
to be between zero and one or

48
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.190
zero and negative one I think, and
then the two others can be anything.

49
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.673
And the crazier you go with the numbers,
the more outside of the number one or

50
00:03:25.673 --> 00:03:27.809
negative one the are,
the crazier it will be.

51
00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:32.711
So here I did a,
all I have to do is break something,

52
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:36.290
and then I can add it back in.

53
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.499
And let's just get rid of,
okay, so this box,

54
00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:49.184
I'm telling it to go from 100
pixels height with a width of 500,

55
00:03:49.184 --> 00:03:54.025
to a height of 100 with a width of 100.

56
00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:58.414
But to restart a function, I just
break it and then I add it back in and

57
00:03:58.414 --> 00:03:59.650
then we go again.

58
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.850
So you see how it's
going way below the 100?

59
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.040
And actually way above the 500?

60
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.290
That's because my cubic
bezier is out of the range,

61
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.550
if I just change this to one and one.

62
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.050
And, I just add this back in.

63
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.860
It's gonna stay within that mark.

64
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.550
Its gonna be a boring animation, but
it's going to stay within that mark.

65
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.814
So, cubic bezier.

66
00:04:23.814 --> 00:04:28.936
We have ease-in, ease in-out,
linear, ease-out,

67
00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:33.312
a cubic bezier that you
can define yourself, and

68
00:04:33.312 --> 00:04:37.811
here's a decent way of playing with it,
linear.

69
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:39.765
Here you're gonna see
that it's just linear.
