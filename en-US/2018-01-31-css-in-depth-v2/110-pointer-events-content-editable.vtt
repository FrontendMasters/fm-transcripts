&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Remember when I
was talking about imput masking and

2
00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:07.298
when you saw the snowflakes falling or
when we were talking about transforms and

3
00:00:07.298 --> 00:00:09.563
there was the RSVP and
it was on the top of the tags and

4
00:00:09.563 --> 00:00:13.280
I was still going right through it and was
still working on stuff that was behind it?

5
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.231
And you were wondering,
how can she see anything behind there?

6
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:19.254
And I couldn't because
it was solid in front.

7
00:00:19.254 --> 00:00:23.176
But I used pointer-events: none,
and that basically said,

8
00:00:23.176 --> 00:00:27.840
on this element when you click, it has
no effect and it goes right through.

9
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.170
So pointer-events has a lot of
different values for SVG, but

10
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.730
for HTML elements,
it's really just none or the default.

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.492
And that's how I pointed to stuff.

12
00:00:41.492 --> 00:00:44.270
That's how I was able to click
through things to the stuff behind it.

13
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.420
Another thing I used a lot in this deck,
which I didn't use on that one of,

14
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.610
when I said I couldn't go backwards,
I forgot to put it on that element.

15
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.540
Anything that I put the content editable
attribute on, which is an HTML attribute.

16
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.962
So it's HTML,
it's been around since HTML5.

17
00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:04.330
I could put it on everything.

18
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.150
Every time I could go like this,
and it turned blue, and

19
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.330
I could remove things,
that meant it had contentEditable.

20
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.510
I put contentEditable on an element and
it made it editable.

21
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.920
So this is HTML,
there's contentEditable on just that.

22
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.100
The slide itself is not interactive.

23
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.600
But that text allows me to change it.

24
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.240
contentEditable makes it editable.

25
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.590
The thing is, when I copy and
paste stuff, what happens?

26
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.499
You can get really weird characters,
so I did read-write-plaintext-only.

27
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.890
And that made it so when we took
the characters that, just the text.

28
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.090
So when I was pasting, I didn't get
the font weight bold and everything else.

29
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.460
And so
I use that a lot on almost everything.

30
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.380
Basically allowing it to
be content editable and

31
00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.170
allowing me to copy and paste text.

32
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.070
This not standard.

33
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.891
moz, user_modify also works, but

34
00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:10.991
as far as I know it's not even gonna
be in the spec but I'm not sure.

35
00:02:10.991 --> 00:02:12.340
Here are some links.

36
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.900
If you wanna look up some of the things,
I'm gonna gonna put actually more links,

37
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.600
I'm gonna put a link for
every single topic we discussed.

38
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.998
I didn't get finished with this one slide.
