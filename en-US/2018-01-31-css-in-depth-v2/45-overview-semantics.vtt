00:00:02.992 --> 00:00:05.814
&gt;&gt; Estelle: We're gonna continue
on with HTML tables and

2
00:00:05.814 --> 00:00:08.560
the CSS associated with tables.

3
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.350
The URL for

4
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:16.223
this is still at my
estelle.github.io/cssmastery/tables

5
00:00:16.223 --> 00:00:18.440
if at any point you get lost.

6
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.040
You don't have to remember all of that,

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.530
just go to estelle.github.io,
that's the only part you need to remember.

8
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.119
And then hopefully you'll realize that we
are still talking about tables if we're

9
00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.155
in the tables section.

10
00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:33.297
So,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: We used to use tables for

11
00:00:33.297 --> 00:00:34.390
layout.

12
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.320
And I don't know if anyone here
has been doing the web for

13
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.630
that long, but about 14 years ago,
we slowly stopped.

14
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.500
And I think about ten years ago,
we fully stopped,

15
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.680
and people stopped
learning how to do that.

16
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.850
But tables are still important if you're
going to do the presentation of data.

17
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.750
Now, depends what type of data.

18
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.610
If you're gonna have someone's face
with a description next to it and then

19
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.210
someone else like your board of directors
on a web page, a table's not appropriate.

20
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.420
But if you are presenting
data comparing it and

21
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.250
something that you might be
able to sort or to calculate or

22
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.210
that you need to cross-reference, that
would be an appropriate use of a table.

23
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.230
So if you ever need to sort something,
a table might be the right thing,

24
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.000
even if you don't include
functionality to the sort.

25
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.600
Like you're never gonna sort
days on a calendar, but

26
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.350
a table might be a right layout for that.

27
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.570
Cuz it is kind of a table of weeks and
months and

28
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.220
years, but you could also use list items.

29
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.320
But if you're going to do all
the different types of ice cream with

30
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.520
the calories you should be shot,
cuz we don't want to know.

31
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.180
But basically, it's not for presentation,

32
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.180
if something's presentational,
don't use tables.

33
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.440
But if you do need tables,
you do need to know how to use them.

34
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.610
So one thing people don't know
is how to actually code a table.

35
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.080
So there is the markup for a table,
let's actually go on to this slide first.

36
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.240
So the first thing that comes
inside a table is the caption and

37
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.410
that is used to described a table.

38
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.170
And then you can have column groups, and
inside those column groups are empty

39
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.500
elements called col,
standing for each column.

40
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.080
And you could actually put
a span on that column.

41
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.490
Then you could have the thead,
tbody, and tfoot.

42
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.370
You can have multiple tbodys,
you can have multiple theads and

43
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.660
you can have multiple tfoot.

44
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.940
It used to be in HTML that tfoot,
it used to be thead, tfoot, tbody.

45
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.240
But they change it and made it logical and
now tfoot can come after.

46
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.780
So, if you actually to
code the whole thing out,

47
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.940
it will look something like this, which is
table, opening and closing caption tags,

48
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.400
a column group with the one col for
each column.

49
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.980
Or if you're gonna have call span = 2 on
one of them then it would be one less.

50
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.780
Then the thead, inside the thead, the only
child inside a thead would be a table row.

51
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.540
And inside a table row you can have
different types of table hjeads.

52
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.390
Either table headings or tds,

53
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.116
I guess which stands for table data,
I'm not sure what td stands for.

54
00:03:28.116 --> 00:03:31.980
And then so you close out the thead,
you can open up a tbody,

55
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.880
you can put in another thead and another
tbody and then you can put it in a tfoot.

56
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.180
You don't necessarily need a tfoot
if you're gonna total all the values

57
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.690
from above, or give the average of all
the calories of every single ice cream.

58
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.494
You should be shot, you can put
that in the tfoot at the bottom.
