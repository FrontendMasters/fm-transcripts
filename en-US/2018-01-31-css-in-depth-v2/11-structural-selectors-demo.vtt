00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.450
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay so, here I created
a flag with a structural selectors.

2
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.500
So basically the HTML looks
exactly like the previous page,

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.920
which is where you were doing the cells,
it's a table.

4
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.370
Now, this is a stupid pet trick,
do not try this,

5
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.320
do not put this into production, but
it was just to show that it's possible.

6
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.040
So the selectors I used were,
I took all the table

7
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.390
cells and I made the color white,
with a background color of white.

8
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.210
And then I said,
every TV table cell that comes,

9
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.910
what's does td mean?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Sibling?

10
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.500
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: General sibling, so

11
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.040
all the tds that come after,
the cell that is the 8th of its type.

12
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.149
So that would mean the 9th, 10th,

13
00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.810
11th and so on cells, but
not the 8th, just the 9th,

14
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.780
10th, and 11th, and 12th and
so on for every odd row.

15
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.870
So every odd row, the ones that
are this ninth cell afterwards.

16
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.654
And starting with the 9th row, 2n + 9, so

17
00:01:16.654 --> 00:01:20.194
starting with 9 and 11 and 13,

18
00:01:20.194 --> 00:01:25.750
every single td make the background
red and a color red.

19
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.820
Now I'm going to change this
to green just to show you,

20
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.750
I'm just gonna change the color to green,
green blue nine zero.

21
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.840
You see, it's say's cell,
see, I marked all those,

22
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.452
right?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

23
00:01:46.452 --> 00:01:51.617
let's go back to 9.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So I mean,

24
00:01:51.617 --> 00:01:56.267
every cell in the rows in 9, 11,

25
00:01:56.267 --> 00:02:01.227
and 13 and for the rows 1, 3, 5,

26
00:02:01.227 --> 00:02:08.513
7 only the cells starting with
the 9th make them red and

27
00:02:08.513 --> 00:02:13.221
that is the striping.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

28
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:18.369
then I said starting at the end,
so nth last of type,

29
00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:23.634
n plus nine, so
starting with the 9th and going in and

30
00:02:23.634 --> 00:02:28.790
starting at the seventh row going up,
make it blue.

31
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.490
And in those same ones,
add a star with generated content,

32
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.570
that's what this is right here.

33
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.160
And for the odd ones,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Right?

34
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.300
Make ' position them a little bit over so
that they're not centered.

35
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.470
Stupid pet trick, but I just wanted to
show that you could actually target,

36
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.270
start from the bottom,
go up to the 17th one from the end, or

37
00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.240
something like that and
only highlight the ones before it.

38
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.059
So if you want to highlight
number one through five.

39
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.002
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Of list items,

40
00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:13.095
one through five, how would you do it?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You

41
00:03:13.095 --> 00:03:17.529
would actually have to say one,
two, three, four and five,

42
00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:23.350
unless you knew how long your thing was
and you can say, 27 from the end, go up.

43
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.580
Or you could put the class on all of
them and then remove the properties and

44
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.570
values from the sixth on.

45
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:41.370
So if you wanted to say just the first
five are bold, you'd say LI bold, LI

46
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.974
nth of type.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: N plus 6,

47
00:03:47.974 --> 00:03:53.750
so starting with the sixth one, font
weight normal it would just override it.

48
00:03:55.074 --> 00:03:58.820
So here's the same exact
thing done with simpler HTML.

49
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.570
In this one,

50
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.380
I basically said make the whole thing
stripped, cuz that makes more sense.

51
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.040
Who would actually start off with, just
make the whole thing striped and than add

52
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.090
the blue, which is a simpler way of doing
it, but we're not gonna cover that one.
