00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.240
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay, so
I've been using lots of words and

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.400
I didn't tell you what the words meant.

3
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.765
So it's media, and
then it says screen and usually, right?

4
00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:16.190
You don't actually need to have screen and
but it's just the common way to do it,

5
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.580
it just says screen and.

6
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.770
There's a word called only.

7
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.920
And basically it just leaves out
older browsers that don't understand.

8
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.420
It's basically a way to just
say only modern browsers.

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.470
And by older browsers I mean like,
well, here it would be print,

10
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.175
it would be an old printer.

11
00:00:33.175 --> 00:00:37.080
You don't wanna reach an old printer, then
you put the word only in front of it and

12
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.910
then the browser wouldn't understand it.

13
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.470
So, in this case,
I was gonna say old IE, it's like,

14
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.750
no, this has nothing to do with IE,
it has to do with the printer.

15
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.280
So if you don't want to
hit an old printer, and

16
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.150
I don't know what the limit is of these
printers, but only is just a way of

17
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.320
leaving out old devices that
don't really fully understand.

18
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.699
They understand through CSS, the old
media queries, but not the newer stuff.

19
00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.820
So the word and
means both parts must be true.

20
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.300
So it has to be screen and
a portrait orientation.

21
00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:15.630
So then second one it's not,
both screen and color.

22
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.540
It might be screen, it might be color,
but it's not both screen and color.

23
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.450
So it only matches it if it's
either screen or color or neither.

24
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.377
And then in the last one,
there's a comma in there.

25
00:01:29.377 --> 00:01:31.898
So it says, if it's print, right?

26
00:01:31.898 --> 00:01:38.560
All printers, or if it's screen and
has a min-width of 480 pixels.

27
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.308
So that comma is basically saying,

28
00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:43.175
what comes between each comma
is its own separate entity.

29
00:01:43.175 --> 00:01:47.698
It could have an and and an only and
everything else, but then start over again

30
00:01:47.698 --> 00:01:52.070
with the next thing it's gonna target,
that's what the comma means.

31
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.555
In the future, we are going to
be able to use greater than and

32
00:01:57.555 --> 00:02:00.429
equals instead of min and max.

33
00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.461
So basically this right here
says media is greater than or

34
00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:09.090
equal to 600 pixels,
which means min-width 600 pixels.

35
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.790
Because when we had min-width, it means
a minimum width of 600, so it's inclusive

36
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.000
of 600, whereas the greater than sign
would be exclusive of 600 pixels.

37
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.680
And this one is something you would never
wanna use because it won't match anything.

38
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.234
So we don't have this yet but
we will have those new symbols.
