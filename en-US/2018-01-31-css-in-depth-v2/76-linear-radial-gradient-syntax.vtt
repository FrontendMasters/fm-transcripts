00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.790
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So the linear gradient
syntax, there were two previous syntaxes.

2
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.870
Syntaxses?

3
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.610
Syntaxum?

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.620
I don't know how you pluralize syntax but
there were two previous ones.

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.470
There was the old webkit and
the old, old webkit, both prefixed.

6
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.030
As I've said a few times, don't get the
prefix version because basically will just

7
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.820
make the device slow if it still
needs to run to the prefix.

8
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.480
So the syntax now is linear gradient and
you either provide it an angle or

9
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.160
you say to and
the direction that you want it to go.

10
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.050
So either to some side or a corner.

11
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.090
Like either to top or to top right.

12
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.300
And then you can provide
it with color stops.

13
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.410
And even add some color hints.

14
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.810
So the few things to remember
about linear gradients is

15
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.820
if you're using a key term
don't forget the word to.

16
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.200
And the top, when you're talking
about degrees, the top is zero and

17
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.680
the angles go clockwise.

18
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.200
And that is actually different
than the previous syntax.

19
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.230
So if you see a gradient that is broken,

20
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.830
before when we used to do dash webkit,
dash moz, dash everything else.

21
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.080
And then we would just put the default for
when it was supported,

22
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.240
we would omit the to keyword because
it wasn't necessary back then.

23
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.630
And then the angles actually
went counterclockwise.

24
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.430
So generally it doesn't make that
much of a difference because

25
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.090
gradients usually just go top to bottom.

26
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.070
So in this example it goes from
rebeccapurple to palegoldenrod.

27
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.540
So all it says is linear gradient and

28
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.920
it has two color stops rebeccapurple.

29
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.830
Comma, palegoldenrod.

30
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.980
It's the same as saying to bottom.

31
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.160
Right?
Nothing changed.

32
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.066
And then saying 0%.

33
00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:10.045
And then saying 100%.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There we go.

34
00:02:10.045 --> 00:02:10.657
So the default are two bottom.

35
00:02:10.657 --> 00:02:14.181
The direction is two bottom.

36
00:02:14.181 --> 00:02:17.780
And if you don't actually stay where your
color stop is, it puts it up to zero and

37
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.334
100%.

38
00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:20.040
We're gonna cover color
stops in just a moment.

39
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.590
Then we have the radial syntax and

40
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.810
I'm introducing the radial
syntax here just briefly.

41
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.440
We're going to deep dive into it after
we're done with linear gradients.

42
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.850
But I wanna show you just
the stuff that's involved so

43
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.280
that you know what things
are gonna be reused.

44
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.867
Radial gradients says shape or
size at a position and

45
00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:41.320
then you have color stops and color hints.

46
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.560
So when you learn the color stops and

47
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.900
the color hints, just realize they're
gonna be used for both of these.

48
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.618
But the angle for
the to is only used in linear gradients.
