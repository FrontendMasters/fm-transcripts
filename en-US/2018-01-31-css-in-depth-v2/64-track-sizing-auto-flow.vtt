00:00:03.196 --> 00:00:06.620
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
then we have implicit track sizing.

2
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.458
So so far, we've basically said,

3
00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:12.258
these are the tracks that I want,
this is the column-width that I want for

4
00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:15.716
the first column, the second column,
the third column, right?

5
00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:19.469
And this is the first row, I want this
size, the second row, I want this size and

6
00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:20.830
the third row.

7
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.820
But what if you have more rows?

8
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.350
Or what if you place something
in the tenth row and

9
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.960
tenth column, and then it's all the way
down here and you haven't declared that.

10
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.710
So that is what implicit track sizing is.

11
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.665
It's basically the grid-auto-columns and
grid-auto-rows,

12
00:00:36.665 --> 00:00:38.590
or grid-auto-flow which declares both.

13
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.650
So here, I have declared A,
B, C, and D, right?

14
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.380
I have said, but
I have only declared the first column,

15
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.160
and I have only declared the first row.

16
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.687
So,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This is gonna be 100px.

17
00:01:03.687 --> 00:01:08.548
This is gonna be 100px by 100px.

18
00:01:08.548 --> 00:01:12.130
And otherwise, I didn't declare anything.

19
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.364
So what I did is,

20
00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:17.969
I added grid-auto-columns,
so anything that gets added,

21
00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.280
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Is gonna be 200px wide.

22
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.640
Any columns that are added?

23
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.856
So right now B was added, so B is 200.

24
00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:36.013
But if I do,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: E and

25
00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:41.634
I do grid-column: 4: grid-row: 5.

26
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.640
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Case sensitive.

27
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.430
There's E down there, right?

28
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.410
So, we basically have 100px here,
100px here.

29
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.970
And so when I placed this,
it actually grabbed the height and

30
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.890
the width of the grid-auto-rows.

31
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.257
So if I got rid of this,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

32
00:02:09.257 --> 00:02:12.513
that, everything would be 100px.

33
00:02:12.513 --> 00:02:16.189
And I wouldn't even need to declare this,
but

34
00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:20.720
it would be in a different,
it would only be 2 wide.

35
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.700
Why is it 2 wide?

36
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.240
Cuz I only went 2 wide with here, right?

37
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.844
So I would have had to do 4 to make that

38
00:02:30.844 --> 00:02:35.234
bigger.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It basically,

39
00:02:35.234 --> 00:02:38.913
this is the HTML font, it's only
as wide as you tell it to be, and

40
00:02:38.913 --> 00:02:42.820
it's going to be as tall,
it's gonna continue growing in height.

41
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.030
But if you tell it to be wider, then it'll
just place everything in the empty area.

42
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.010
But sometimes,
you actually want empty areas, right?

43
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.630
We can create a checkerboard.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Here we have

44
00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.132
a checkerboard.

45
00:02:59.132 --> 00:03:06.718
And what I did is I did A at 1,1.

46
00:03:06.718 --> 00:03:07.864
B at 1,3.

47
00:03:07.864 --> 00:03:09.352
C at 1,5.

48
00:03:09.352 --> 00:03:11.144
D at 3,1.

49
00:03:11.144 --> 00:03:14.027
E at 3, 3.

50
00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:17.860
F at 3, 5.

51
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.890
So this is basically where I put them,
right?

52
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.350
So notice everything is odd.

53
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.640
And then with J, I did the evens,
which is this one right here.

54
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.750
So I did 2, 2, 2, 4, and then 4, 2, 4, 4.

55
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.506
So I used grid-column,
basically the shorthand,

56
00:03:35.506 --> 00:03:40.598
when you only have one value,
it only is 1 column wide.

57
00:03:40.598 --> 00:03:43.518
Because everything has got to be at
least one column and at least one row.
