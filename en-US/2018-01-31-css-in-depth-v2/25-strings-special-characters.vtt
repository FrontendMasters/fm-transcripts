00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.990
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
generating Content Strings.

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.362
So we talked about this
a little bit before,

3
00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:09.673
and if you remember we
did a Unicode example.

4
00:00:09.673 --> 00:00:13.864
So to have interactive content,
you need to have the content attribute and

5
00:00:13.864 --> 00:00:16.923
it has to have something in it,
or an empty string, but

6
00:00:16.923 --> 00:00:19.871
an empty string has to be quotes or
the keyword none.

7
00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:24.052
Or any of the other types, which we talked
about quote no quote, and stuff like that.

8
00:00:24.052 --> 00:00:26.845
So you can have the empty one,
which is just two quotes.

9
00:00:26.845 --> 00:00:29.251
You can have any type of text,

10
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:33.975
like we showed the example
earlier of parenthesis.pdf.

11
00:00:33.975 --> 00:00:37.755
And then, a Unicode character,
which starts with a slash, and

12
00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:40.353
then the number of that Unicode character.

13
00:00:40.353 --> 00:00:45.550
You can have attribute href or counter,
so we've already gone over all of those.

14
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.910
I just wanted to have one slide that.

15
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.682
So let's talk about special characters,
cuz we had this special character 2603.

16
00:00:52.682 --> 00:00:57.176
Let's find out what 2603 is.

17
00:00:57.176 --> 00:01:03.242
So 275D is this quote,

18
00:01:03.242 --> 00:01:08.770
275E is this quote.

19
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.520
This here is not a live slide, so I can't
change them on the fly on this one.

20
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.750
Here, the special character
2709 is the little email.

21
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.157
2706 is a telephone and

22
00:01:25.157 --> 00:01:28.995
231A is now a watch.

23
00:01:32.562 --> 00:01:35.836
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: No,
cuz that says add to calendar.

24
00:01:35.836 --> 00:01:40.260
They didn't have a calendar icon when I
did this, I couldn't find a calendar icon.

25
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.413
I don't use emoticons, barely,
I use 1, which is this, and that's it.

26
00:01:45.413 --> 00:01:49.720
So I'm not really good with the emoticon
things, but I do like the snowman.

27
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.940
So 2603 is a snowman and I created
this calendar many, many years ago.

28
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.090
And You could just put in a character
here, and then figure out what it was.

29
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.140
So if we did this, I can't grab it.

30
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.830
Why can't I grab it?

31
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.979
Anyone know why I can't grab this?

32
00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.359
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yep.

33
00:02:10.953 --> 00:02:13.760
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So I can't grab any
of these to actually stick in there.

34
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.734
So let's just do 2603

35
00:02:19.734 --> 00:02:24.510
invert, okay, so

36
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.410
the one you put in the top is if
it was ampersand number sign and

37
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.250
then it tells you what it is and then it
converts it to CSS and JavaScript for you.

38
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.363
The thing is with UTF-8,
you don't really have to do this.

39
00:02:39.363 --> 00:02:41.430
You could actually just grab this one.

40
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.460
I can grab, cuz it's actually text and

41
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.230
if I just put this up here,
if it was a live slide, it would work.

42
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.270
So let's put it down here and
convert, okay.

43
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.672
Let's put it on a slide
that is actually live.

44
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.425
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Here, and content,
I'm just gonna put that here.

45
00:03:04.477 --> 00:03:06.418
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And hover over it.

46
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:08.821
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Semicolon.

47
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.720
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Thank you.

48
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.488
There we go, so you see it there?

49
00:03:14.488 --> 00:03:19.360
Because it's UTF-8, I don't actually
need to put the slash u, but you can.

50
00:03:23.057 --> 00:03:31.230
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
here's a nice use of a generated content.

51
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.730
So so far we've been using strings, but
you can also use it for graphic design.

52
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.948
This is progressive enhancement.

53
00:03:37.948 --> 00:03:39.869
It informs someone that it's a quote.

54
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.021
This text is still there.

55
00:03:43.021 --> 00:03:47.265
How am I informing them
that it's a quote visually?

56
00:03:47.265 --> 00:03:50.900
Basically, put a little arrow
underneath it inside a bubble.

57
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.650
So the quote,
I put a border radius of 20 pixels, and

58
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.760
then after it, I put generated
content of an empty string.

59
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.330
And I basically, put a square
that has a 20 pixel border up it.

60
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.833
So that means it's actually
40 pixels by 40 pixels.

61
00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:18.690
And then, I made all four corners or four
sides of that square, you know the four.

62
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.117
So it has a height of 0 and a width of 0,

63
00:04:21.117 --> 00:04:24.871
which means it's just four
triangles coming in the middle,

64
00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:29.450
because when you have a border,
the boarders come in at an angle, right?

65
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.980
They come in towards the center point.

66
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.930
It's a, what is it, an isosceles triangle
when all three sides are the same?

67
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.386
Trigonometry-
&gt;&gt; Group: Equilateral.

68
00:04:38.386 --> 00:04:40.600
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Equilateral, thank you.

69
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.400
You all are closer to your
trigonometry class than I am.

70
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.000
I had foster kids, but

71
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.790
they weren't old enough to actually
learn equilateral triangles.

72
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.596
They don't teach that to six and
seven year olds.

73
00:04:52.596 --> 00:04:59.800
Okay, so all the borders are transparent
except for the top one which I made red.

74
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.200
So if you have a square, and
it has triangles on each side,

75
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.110
you decide which one you wanna show.

76
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.270
In this case, I only wanna show the top
one, cuz it's an angle pointing down.

77
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.490
This is not a live slide,
but the next slide is, so

78
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.200
I'm just gonna change it from red to blue,
from transparent to blue.

79
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.376
And let's get rid of this line here,
so it can pop up a little bit.

80
00:05:25.376 --> 00:05:30.313
And yellow, and green.

81
00:05:30.313 --> 00:05:33.697
Okay, so we have a Google
square down at the bottom, but

82
00:05:33.697 --> 00:05:36.270
I only want the red to show.

83
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.960
If I do border color of red, that won't
work, cuz all four will be red, so

84
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.480
that's why I did transparent, there we go.

85
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.188
So that means the one on top is red,
the left and

86
00:05:52.188 --> 00:05:55.401
right are transparent and
the bottom is transparent.

87
00:05:55.401 --> 00:06:00.048
If I want to put the quote on the side and

88
00:06:00.048 --> 00:06:04.695
that would have been on the left side so

89
00:06:04.695 --> 00:06:11.826
the position would have been
left would be negative 20.

90
00:06:19.564 --> 00:06:20.099
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: 120.

91
00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:20.842
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Negative 20.

92
00:06:20.842 --> 00:06:21.442
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Thank you.

93
00:06:21.442 --> 00:06:23.410
I was like, why is that not working?

94
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.774
Negative 20, negative 40.

95
00:06:25.774 --> 00:06:31.566
Yeah, there we go, and then bottom,

96
00:06:31.566 --> 00:06:36.819
it would have been top 20 there.

97
00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:42.699
So if it was coming out from the side,

98
00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:47.822
let me just do relative left 40

99
00:06:47.822 --> 00:06:52.920
pixels, so you can see it.

100
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.065
So if I want to put it on the side,

101
00:06:55.065 --> 00:06:59.689
I would just put that negative side
triangle, and put it on the side.
