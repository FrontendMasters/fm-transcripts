00:00:03.605 --> 00:00:06.785
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Showed you how to have
the four values of grid row start,

2
00:00:06.785 --> 00:00:09.842
grid column start,
grid row end and grid column end.

3
00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:14.152
Let's say you only have
three values there.

4
00:00:14.152 --> 00:00:20.711
If you omit grid column end, then the grid
column and value would either be,

5
00:00:20.711 --> 00:00:26.554
if you name the grid column start
that would be or else would be auto,

6
00:00:26.554 --> 00:00:32.421
which I think is just one,
not 100% sure, it would be one over.

7
00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:33.487
So let's try that.

8
00:00:40.146 --> 00:00:42.988
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's just one word.

9
00:00:42.988 --> 00:00:45.962
If however, I did

10
00:00:51.687 --> 00:00:58.294
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Start, all right?

11
00:00:58.294 --> 00:01:04.301
Repeat, 3,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Mid,

12
00:01:12.891 --> 00:01:19.209
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Repeat 9 and,

13
00:01:25.776 --> 00:01:26.780
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so

14
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.793
let me just put this in here.

15
00:01:29.793 --> 00:01:35.536
Okay, so,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Here,

16
00:01:35.536 --> 00:01:39.596
I actually now have named grid lines.

17
00:01:39.596 --> 00:01:43.933
So it's start or 1, I can use either one.

18
00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:46.820
So here I do start, I do 1.

19
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.458
Same thing, right?

20
00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:56.462
Start or 1 because the first
line is called start but

21
00:01:56.462 --> 00:01:59.745
still always going to be 1.

22
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.523
And the weird thing is you can actually
name many of them, use the same name.

23
00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:06.006
We can use the name over and over again.

24
00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:07.553
So I can do start start start start.

25
00:02:07.553 --> 00:02:14.107
So I was having a 12 column layout, I
could have every third one name start and

26
00:02:14.107 --> 00:02:18.390
that way will be whichever
closest one is to start.

27
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.531
So let's go with start here
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

28
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:29.215
then go with mid here.

29
00:02:32.194 --> 00:02:34.592
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And 1 fr

30
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:48.043
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There is a typo here
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there a space between 1

31
00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:48.800
and fr?.

32
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.829
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Thank you.

33
00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:50.748
Perfect, thank you.

34
00:02:52.816 --> 00:02:57.296
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So this goes back to what
I had originally with which it was to,

35
00:02:57.296 --> 00:02:57.906
right.

36
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:01.867
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So went to 2 and 5.

37
00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:05.516
And I need to make this 8,
so it is same as before.

38
00:03:05.516 --> 00:03:07.690
Okay, so that's the same as before, right?

39
00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:15.570
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We named the columns,
but we didn't name the rows.

40
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.306
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's just do
the exact same thing with rows, okay?

41
00:03:29.113 --> 00:03:31.058
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
now we can use start start,

42
00:03:34.148 --> 00:03:35.887
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And mid mid.

43
00:03:35.887 --> 00:03:39.876
So you see I actually reused the names of
grid-column, definitely no conflict there.

44
00:03:42.074 --> 00:03:50.257
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So if I get rid of
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's set it auto.

45
00:04:00.055 --> 00:04:01.229
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I've no
clue why it did that.

46
00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:10.041
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Cuz if it's
a b It should be grid-row.

47
00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:11.097
Let's just show you that.

48
00:04:11.097 --> 00:04:16.962
So grid-column, 2, 5,
5, 2, very good point.

49
00:04:16.962 --> 00:04:19.020
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That would be in

50
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.724
the deeper dive.

51
00:04:19.724 --> 00:04:22.266
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Does RTL kind of things?

52
00:04:22.266 --> 00:04:24.465
I mean, what are the impacts
of shifting the RTL inverse.

53
00:04:24.465 --> 00:04:26.484
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
it's kind of like Flexbox.

54
00:04:26.484 --> 00:04:29.750
If you remember yesterday
when I discussed Flexbox and

55
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.379
basically said main direction is this way.

56
00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:35.793
But in right to left languages,
it will actually reverse it for you, yeah.
