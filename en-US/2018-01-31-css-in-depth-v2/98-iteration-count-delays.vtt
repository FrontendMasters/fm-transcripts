00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:07.600
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So we've figured out the
steps, or the animation-timing-function.

2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.380
Now let's take a look at iteration-count.

3
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.750
How many times do you want
your animation to happen?

4
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.990
The default is 1.

5
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.066
By default it will happen just one time.

6
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.949
You can tell it to animate
as many times as you want,

7
00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.050
or you can use the key term infinite.

8
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.650
So infinite or
any number including a float.

9
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.210
A negative number is pointless.

10
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:33.435
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Partial iterations work fine.

11
00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:39.338
So here,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I

12
00:00:39.338 --> 00:00:47.873
go from 500px to 100px width,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And height.

13
00:00:47.873 --> 00:00:53.647
And then I go,
animation-iteration-count 0.5.

14
00:00:53.647 --> 00:00:55.104
And I just get rid of this.

15
00:00:56.858 --> 00:01:01.180
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And it doesn't work, so I open
this up and I say, why aren't you working?

16
00:01:03.904 --> 00:01:05.844
&gt;&gt; Estelle: There it goes,
because I have a stupid five-second delay.

17
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.431
So, did you see how it
didn't go all the way?

18
00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:17.515
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Well, that's interesting.

19
00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:20.331
I have no clue what's going on,
my computer is possessed.

20
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.462
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay.

21
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.290
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So I'm just going to do 0.1.

22
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.375
Okay, and
also it's just gonna stop and go away.

23
00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:34.077
Halfway mark.

24
00:01:34.077 --> 00:01:35.981
There we go.

25
00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:38.709
Okay, so
it only went through half an animation.

26
00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:39.957
It doesn't need to be a full number.

27
00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:44.370
&gt;&gt; Estelle: No iterations?

28
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.910
That's fine, it'll still work.

29
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.892
And you can see that it's actually
gonna be blue cuz I put the key term

30
00:01:49.892 --> 00:01:50.683
forwards there.

31
00:01:50.683 --> 00:01:56.707
So it's actually going to the 100%
mark even though there's no iteration.

32
00:01:59.892 --> 00:02:03.502
&gt;&gt; Estelle: animation-delay is kind
of interesting, because if you have

33
00:02:03.502 --> 00:02:08.830
a negative animation-delay, it'll start
part way through the first animation.

34
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.281
So I can, say,
make the animation-delay: -4.0 seconds.

35
00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:16.587
And instead of waiting
four seconds to start,

36
00:02:16.587 --> 00:02:19.379
it'll actually start four
seconds before it started.

37
00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.736
And it's gonna jump halfway across
the screen, and there it goes.

38
00:02:23.736 --> 00:02:26.170
But the second iteration
will be a full iteration.

39
00:02:27.832 --> 00:02:32.361
So animation-delay,
any time you want, default is 0 but

40
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:35.449
you can actually use a negative number.

41
00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:41.851
If I use -10.0 seconds, it's gonna start
part way through the second iteration.

42
00:02:43.682 --> 00:02:48.610
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So
it's only gonna be a six-second total.

43
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.110
There we go.
