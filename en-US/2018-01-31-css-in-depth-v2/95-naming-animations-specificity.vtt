00:00:02.186 --> 00:00:02.961
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so, so far,

2
00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:06.181
we've talked about the key frames, but
we haven't actually animated anything.

3
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:08.376
We've just created
the key frame animation.

4
00:00:08.376 --> 00:00:09.826
We gave it a name and

5
00:00:09.826 --> 00:00:14.736
that name is what you're going to
use to attach it to an element.

6
00:00:14.736 --> 00:00:19.028
So the only thing that is required to make
an animation work is the animation name

7
00:00:19.028 --> 00:00:21.542
cuz there are default values for
everything.

8
00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:25.513
So if you recall when we over wrote the
important we just give you the animation

9
00:00:25.513 --> 00:00:27.420
name and then the keyword forwards.

10
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.199
And I'll talk about forwards but
forwards makes stuff stand at 100% mark.

11
00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:32.709
It's all we did.

12
00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:34.502
We just said and it worked, right?

13
00:00:34.502 --> 00:00:38.567
There was only two properties to
clear the name and one other thing.

14
00:00:38.567 --> 00:00:42.182
So we have a Base CSS, which is our
pencil, the width is 100 pixels,

15
00:00:42.182 --> 00:00:46.161
the text align to the right, the border
bottom is 10 pixels cuz I wanna make it

16
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:49.084
look like it's drawing
the little border in the bottom.

17
00:00:49.084 --> 00:00:54.023
And then after I put the pencil in
position, I wanted the pencil to be lower

18
00:00:54.023 --> 00:00:57.626
than it would be, so
that's why I put it in the after.

19
00:00:57.626 --> 00:01:02.316
And then I have this key frame called
drawALine, and it goes from 0 to 100%.

20
00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:07.926
With a width of 0 and the width is 100%,
where it goes from green to blue.

21
00:01:07.926 --> 00:01:09.933
But I didn't attach it to the pencil yet,
right?

22
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:12.736
The pencil doesn't have an animation.

23
00:01:12.736 --> 00:01:14.791
So let's attach the animation.

24
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:18.645
I say animation draw and
a line and duration three seconds.

25
00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:22.000
If there's not duration, it's zero
seconds and it's kind of a moot point.

26
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.109
So here it's going from green
to blue over six seconds.

27
00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:29.884
Want to see that again?

28
00:01:29.884 --> 00:01:32.687
Let's make it faster so
we're not as annoyed.

29
00:01:32.687 --> 00:01:34.773
Over three seconds.

30
00:01:34.773 --> 00:01:39.350
So I gave it the animation name,
and a duration.

31
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.658
By default it only happens once.

32
00:01:43.658 --> 00:01:45.882
First it does the first one,
second and then third.

33
00:01:45.882 --> 00:01:47.400
So it's actually blue,

34
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.547
because the blue overwrote the background
color property for the green and the red.

35
00:01:52.547 --> 00:01:56.456
So if you have many key frame animations
with the same property going on at

36
00:01:56.456 --> 00:01:57.299
the same time.

37
00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.697
Cuz you can have multiple animations
on them at the same time.

38
00:02:00.697 --> 00:02:04.663
Which ever one is declared last,
that would be the property.

39
00:02:04.663 --> 00:02:09.503
Okay,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We already talked about

40
00:02:09.503 --> 00:02:14.100
specificity, but in case someone is coming
to this deck without doing the whole

41
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.372
deck,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The CSS can overwrite

42
00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:24.065
important, so just know that
animations will work even if

43
00:02:24.065 --> 00:02:29.446
there's a declaration of important
on the property originally.

44
00:02:29.446 --> 00:02:36.546
So here I did say that I want the boarder
to be black and solid and 5 pixels.

45
00:02:36.546 --> 00:02:40.422
But because I have a key frame animation
going on it's actually changing from red

46
00:02:40.422 --> 00:02:42.998
to orange because the animation
right now is active.

47
00:02:47.844 --> 00:02:52.152
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
I already covered this as well.

48
00:02:52.152 --> 00:02:55.755
Do not include important in your key
frame animations, that will not work.
