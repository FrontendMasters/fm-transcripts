00:00:02.115 --> 00:00:04.301
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So here's steps,
it's a different type of,

2
00:00:04.301 --> 00:00:06.150
it's not a cubic bezier function.

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.650
All of the other ones we looked
at were cubic bezier functions.

4
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.850
Steps says,

5
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.460
how many steps should this take to get
from this 0% mark to the 100% mark.

6
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.921
So if you have five steps, right?

7
00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:21.102
It's either gonna be from 0 to 100%.

8
00:00:21.102 --> 00:00:27.228
It's gonna be 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 or
it's gonna be 20, 40, 60, 80, 100.

9
00:00:27.228 --> 00:00:31.184
So you're either gonna drop the 0 or
you're gonna drop the 100% mark.

10
00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:34.690
And so that's where the key words start or
end comes in.

11
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.969
Basically it's the one you're gonna drop.

12
00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:44.038
So if we do end,
its going to go 0, then 20,

13
00:00:44.038 --> 00:00:48.855
then 40, then 60, then 80.

14
00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:55.057
No, its actually 10 steps its going to be,
so 10, 20, 30, 40, 0, 10, 20, 30, 40.

15
00:00:55.057 --> 00:01:00.328
And if you start, you see how
it's hanging out on the 10% mark?

16
00:01:00.328 --> 00:01:05.255
Cuz it's dropping the start position.

17
00:01:05.255 --> 00:01:06.777
So what's the point of cubic bezier?

18
00:01:06.777 --> 00:01:09.580
Why would you want steps?

19
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.710
Generally, you want something
to be smooth, right?

20
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.030
But sometimes you wanna
do character animation.

21
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.690
And so, where he might, where he go.

22
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.680
There he is, he is dancing over there.

23
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:31.382
Okay, so that is Psy and he is dancing
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Somewhere.

24
00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:36.363
He is off the page.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's give him a little

25
00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:38.410
bit more room to dance around.

26
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.890
So how did I animate this?

27
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.180
You are kind of like I have
no clue how this works.

28
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:53.250
I actually the sprite of a dancing Psy and
it has 23 frames in it 22 frames.

29
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.820
And I basically move
the background position.

30
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.330
And instead of doing a linear, right?

31
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.883
If I do linear this is
gonna hurt you eyes, so

32
00:02:02.883 --> 00:02:07.880
just be warned.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There he

33
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.330
is on the side there, right?

34
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.026
It's then I do steps and
I just show 23 steps.

35
00:02:16.026 --> 00:02:19.983
From the 0% mark to 120 thirds the way in,

36
00:02:19.983 --> 00:02:24.661
220 thirds the way in to
320 thirds of the way in.

37
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:29.740
Let's get rid of Psy.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There we go, okay.

38
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.440
So then I have a bicycle animation and

39
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.291
this is a little bit easier to show
abut less interesting as an animation,

40
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:39.680
so at the 0% mark,
I'm showing the first key frame.

41
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.200
At the 25% mark,
I'm showing the second key frame.

42
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.910
At the third, I'm showing the 50% mark and
the fourth I'm showing the 75.

43
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.530
I don't wanna show the 100% mark because
if the image is way off the page,

44
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.600
then you're not going to see it so

45
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.770
that's why I used steps end
because I'm dropping the end mark.

46
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.191
If I had done step start,
I would have dropped the first one and

47
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:11.728
kept the 100% and that doesn't look good.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

48
00:03:11.728 --> 00:03:16.027
I'm dropping the end mark.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That looks like a guy

49
00:03:16.027 --> 00:03:17.700
bicycling around right?

50
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.011
And you could add a second animation then,

51
00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:20.367
cuz you can have him
move across the screen.
