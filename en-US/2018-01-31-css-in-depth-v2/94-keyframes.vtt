1
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.544
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So keyframe starts

2
00:00:02.544 --> 00:00:06.793
with the word @keyframes.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

3
00:00:06.793 --> 00:00:09.208
then you give it a name.

4
00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:13.383
It used to have to be,
I need to remove this.

5
00:00:13.383 --> 00:00:14.586
It can be coded now.

6
00:00:14.586 --> 00:00:17.230
It used to be an ident,
but now can be a string.

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.460
If it's an ident, the characters that
are valid are a through z lowercase,

8
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.470
uppercase, zero through nine,
the dash, the underscore.

9
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.258
And any ISO 10646 character
of u plus 00A0 and

10
00:00:33.258 --> 00:00:40.462
higher, which means you can
basically use emoticons as animation

11
00:00:40.462 --> 00:00:47.208
names.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It

12
00:00:47.208 --> 00:00:52.184
can't start with zero through nine,
it can't start with a digit,

13
00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:54.904
two hyphens or a hyphen plus a digit.

14
00:00:54.904 --> 00:00:59.574
And you can actually give it
escape characters in the name.

15
00:00:59.574 --> 00:01:04.390
So Q n% bank can be written as Q

16
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.446
with a slash n% A slash.

17
00:01:08.446 --> 00:01:11.730
I don't know why you would wanna do
this but I just wanna be thorough.

18
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.306
Just don't use keyterms,
keyterms are completely legal to use.

19
00:01:18.306 --> 00:01:20.278
One of the properties for,

20
00:01:20.278 --> 00:01:24.581
whether animation play state
is either running or paused.

21
00:01:24.581 --> 00:01:28.175
You don't know how many people have tried
to use the animation name of running.

22
00:01:28.175 --> 00:01:31.549
And then been like,
why isn't my animation working?

23
00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.475
Because they only declared that it was
running in terms of the play state and

24
00:01:35.475 --> 00:01:37.610
the never declared the animation name.

25
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.463
So avoid them,
it's not that they are illegal,

26
00:01:40.463 --> 00:01:42.139
just avoid them because they
will give you a headache.

27
00:01:43.774 --> 00:01:44.950
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So what's in the name?

28
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.477
I actually called this,
the animation name for

29
00:01:48.477 --> 00:01:52.990
this is Pencil.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You can do that,

30
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.895
I don't know why you would want to,
but you can.

31
00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:56.040
I just wanted to show that you could.

32
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.449
And I also want to make it a little
bit more fun at this time of day,

33
00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:06.316
so-
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: KeyFrame at-rule, and

34
00:02:06.316 --> 00:02:08.878
then the name of the animation,
either with or

35
00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:11.811
without quotes.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

36
00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:15.370
I don't know why I called it slides,
and then opening and closing bracket.

37
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.220
And then all of your key frames
are gonna go in between those.

38
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.883
So here we have animation
of called writing.

39
00:02:22.883 --> 00:02:28.220
And where this goes from left at 0 to left
at 100%, and just goes across the page.

40
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.580
So this is a key frame, it starts
with the word from and it goes to to.

41
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.363
Each of these are times,
this is 0% and 100%.

42
00:02:34.363 --> 00:02:39.324
You could've written 0% and
you could've written 100%.

43
00:02:39.324 --> 00:02:43.656
You need to have at least 1 key frame.

44
00:02:43.656 --> 00:02:47.650
I'm going to change size because
this pencil's annoying me.

45
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.706
And I'm gonna go over here and
hope that it goes stops, thank you.

46
00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:58.348
[SOUND] Okay, so you can do 0 or 100%.

47
00:02:58.348 --> 00:03:03.433
Don't forget the percent right here,
it's required, zero's not valid.

48
00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:06.263
And you can't quote the animation name,
so after they got slide.

49
00:03:06.263 --> 00:03:11.868
So there is 0% and an 100%.

50
00:03:11.868 --> 00:03:15.491
If you leave them out,
it will still animate.

51
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:19.908
So right now I have a div in
the background code as red.

52
00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:24.200
In the background,
the border is 1 pixel wide.

53
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.090
Over ten seconds I do the animation,
the animation goes from 0 to 100%.

54
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.732
And at the 45% mark,
I want the background to be green.

55
00:03:35.732 --> 00:03:40.385
At the 55% mark,
I want the background color to be blue.

56
00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:45.398
And I want the border to go from 1
pixel to 10 pixels to 20 pixels.

57
00:03:45.398 --> 00:03:50.040
Because I did not declare the 0% mark or
the 100% mark,

58
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.046
they're interpolated from
the default values, or

59
00:03:54.046 --> 00:03:57.155
from the values that are on the element.

60
00:03:57.155 --> 00:04:00.889
So it's as if I wrote,

61
00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:05.814
0%, 100%, and I put-

62
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.082
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so

63
00:04:13.082 --> 00:04:15.959
that animation did not change.

64
00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.083
I could make it orange so
you can see that is

65
00:04:19.083 --> 00:04:25.931
active.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah,

66
00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:28.647
so you see that it's actually
the active slide, right?

67
00:04:28.647 --> 00:04:33.306
So it actually puts in the 0% and
the 100% mark for

68
00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:40.712
you using the values that it would've had
when the animation was not attached, okay.

69
00:04:40.712 --> 00:04:47.252
So then, that was using 0,
45, 55, and 100%.

70
00:04:47.252 --> 00:04:50.111
So that's basically more granular control.

71
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:55.929
So here I'm writingWhileTired,
so I'm going 0%,

72
00:04:55.929 --> 00:05:00.990
left is 0, at 10% is gone 45% way cross.

73
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.810
And then at the 90% mark, it's only
gone 10% of the way across the page.

74
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.870
So let's say it's a 1,000 pixels wide,
it's only moved 100

75
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.369
pixels over 80% of the animation,
and then it goes to the 100% mark.

76
00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:17.980
So the reason I call
this writing while tired,

77
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.853
have you ever written while
you were falling asleep.

78
00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:23.559
And then you look at your thing that you
wrote and you're like what did I write,

79
00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:25.310
that's what this reminded me of so.

80
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.883
Okay,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So-

81
00:05:31.547 --> 00:05:32.307
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We already talked

82
00:05:32.307 --> 00:05:35.657
about this yesterday during this lecture
and specificity where important and

83
00:05:35.657 --> 00:05:37.036
isn't really that important.

84
00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:42.347
You never want to put an important
inside an animation, it's ignored.

85
00:05:42.347 --> 00:05:47.917
So this 55% mark, it never turned blue
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Important doesn't work

86
00:05:47.917 --> 00:05:53.714
in your keyframe animation.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: But

87
00:05:53.714 --> 00:06:01.370
if I do red important, it's still
gonna turn green, remember that?

88
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.849
Okay, so important isn't important,
doesn't work at all,

89
00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:08.561
if it's in your animation keyframe.

90
00:06:08.561 --> 00:06:11.914
But it can be overwritten by an animation.

91
00:06:11.914 --> 00:06:15.326
You can animate multiple properties,
everything so

92
00:06:15.326 --> 00:06:20.492
far have been basically animating the
background color I think or the left here.

93
00:06:20.492 --> 00:06:26.575
I've set at 0% make the left and
top zero, so it starts off here.

94
00:06:26.575 --> 00:06:31.234
At the 25% mark and the 75% mark,
the pencil should be down

95
00:06:31.234 --> 00:06:36.256
400 pixels.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: At the 100% mark,

96
00:06:36.256 --> 00:06:41.197
up here, so it's going from right to
left the whole time, as going up and

97
00:06:41.197 --> 00:06:42.422
down in between.

98
00:06:42.422 --> 00:06:46.843
So, I don't have to declare
the left in every single key frame.

99
00:06:46.843 --> 00:06:50.408
I've already declared the left twice and
it's 0% mark and 100% mark.

100
00:06:50.408 --> 00:06:53.616
But it's have been much more
gradual control the top and bottom,

101
00:06:53.616 --> 00:06:58.583
right.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Then

102
00:06:58.583 --> 00:07:01.510
you can have duplicate keyframes.

103
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:06.412
So here, I said 45, 45, 55, 55,

104
00:07:06.412 --> 00:07:11.426
that's legal.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yep,

105
00:07:11.426 --> 00:07:14.947
it's changing to blue and
it's changing the opacity, we're good.

106
00:07:14.947 --> 00:07:17.336
Duplicates the keyframes, it's fine.

107
00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:24.152
And you can also do, if you have the exact
same value for something, you can do 55%.

108
00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:26.886
And we saw that when I did the 100% and

109
00:07:26.886 --> 00:07:31.777
the 0% originally.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

110
00:07:31.777 --> 00:07:34.835
you can animate transforms,
which is usually what you wanna do.

111
00:07:34.835 --> 00:07:40.706
Because when I animated the left,
you don't really wanna animate the left or

112
00:07:40.706 --> 00:07:45.144
the top properties because
you're repainting the page.

113
00:07:45.144 --> 00:07:50.506
You're transforming it,
when it's transformed it's on the GPU,

114
00:07:50.506 --> 00:07:54.580
it's in its own space and
it works much much better.

115
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.417
You don't wanna do anything
that causes a reflow.

116
00:07:57.417 --> 00:08:00.812
So if you're making something bigger,
you're repainting the whole page.
