00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.060
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
let's go on to the direction.

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.720
Basically, everything so
far has been talked about and except for

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.850
the ones that weren't addable,
which went from left to right.

4
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.440
So you can declare the direction.

5
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.250
So let's first start by
discussing when we say to and

6
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.570
we have to give a side or corner.

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.748
So the options are to top, to bottom,
and to bottom is the default,

8
00:00:25.748 --> 00:00:31.252
to left, to right, to top left,
to top right, to bottom right, or

9
00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:36.673
to bottom right.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: In this example here,

10
00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:43.100
this is the midpoint, and I'm gonna
say to bottom, which is the default.

11
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.230
And so that gradient line
goes from top to bottom.

12
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.913
If I say to left,
you'll see it's going from

13
00:00:52.913 --> 00:00:58.134
the first color declared
of purple to goldenrod.

14
00:00:58.134 --> 00:01:04.205
It's going from the right to the left.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Now

15
00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:08.780
it's gonna go from the left to the right.

16
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.094
It's basically going, to right.

17
00:01:12.094 --> 00:01:14.859
And then I can have it go, to top.

18
00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:17.319
Fairly simple, right?

19
00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:20.947
Now, I'm gonna say to top left.

20
00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:26.530
And if you see the midpoint
of that gradient, right,

21
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.622
is going from the bottom corner
to the top corner, right?

22
00:01:32.622 --> 00:01:37.370
And the gradient line,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That's along,

23
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.211
like if I'd given 15 different colors,
it would go along that line.

24
00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:42.591
So everything's going along that line.

25
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:50.650
It's perpendicular to the midpoint.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: To top right,

26
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.866
they're called magic corners
which is the 50% mark,

27
00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:57.819
goes from this corner right here,
if it didn't have a border radius,

28
00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.380
to this corner right here,
if it didn't have a border radius.

29
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.908
And it's a little off.

30
00:02:02.908 --> 00:02:04.929
No, it's not, actually,
it's perfectly fine.

31
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.245
So basically, that's what's going on,

32
00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:14.115
your gradient line is at a right angle
to the midpoint of a line that goes

33
00:02:14.115 --> 00:02:18.263
from one corner to the other corner.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

34
00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:23.840
it's going from the top, in this
case it's going to the bottom right.

35
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.210
So it's starting up here and
going down here.

36
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.240
So is going the general direction
of the bottom right, but

37
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.170
it's going in the general direction.

38
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.311
So that the perpendicular line
would go from corner to corner.

39
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.531
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So let's try this,

40
00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:48.192
just write all of them, to right, to left,

41
00:02:48.192 --> 00:02:53.630
to bottom right.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

42
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.861
let's just do 50%.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 50%, you

43
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:04.559
see at that green line, that yellow-green
change goes from corner to corner?

44
00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:08.780
But the gradient line, so the gradient
line is the line that's going from red,

45
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.750
to orange, to yellow,
to green, to blue, to purple.

46
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.287
So it's actually going from the top
left corner to the bottom right corner,

47
00:03:17.287 --> 00:03:20.762
but it's not actually
hitting either corner.

48
00:03:20.762 --> 00:03:24.935
It's going in such a way that it's
perpendicular to the line that goes from

49
00:03:24.935 --> 00:03:27.430
the bottom left or the top right.

50
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.230
Does that make sense?

51
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.090
So now let's discuss angles.

52
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.130
So we've been declaring
everything with key terms.

53
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.980
Now, we can learn how
to do it with angles.

54
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.150
The degrees go starting at 12 noon,
or at the top which, is 0%.

55
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.970
The right is 90%, the bottom is 180,
and the left is 270.

56
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.060
So 0 degrees is the same as top, but

57
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.060
45 degrees is not the same as top right.

58
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.140
Because 45 degrees will
always be 45 degrees, but

59
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.490
top right might be at a different
angle depending on the aspect ratio.

60
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.000
And the degree is required.

61
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.560
You don't have to use degrees,
you can use gradients or grads, but

62
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.850
no one uses gradients or grads.

63
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.100
So we're not really going to cover them,
but

64
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.200
you can actually play with it and
it's fine.

65
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.691
So here, I'm just right there,

66
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:32.932
I made it 216 degrees.

67
00:04:32.932 --> 00:04:38.986
And so the degrees is
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 0

68
00:04:38.986 --> 00:04:42.484
degrees is actually where
the black line goes, right?

69
00:04:42.484 --> 00:04:43.749
0 degrees, it's going up and down.

70
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.044
And then the gradient
follows that gradient

71
00:04:47.044 --> 00:04:52.645
line.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

72
00:04:52.645 --> 00:04:56.180
so let's just click on 45 degrees,
right, that's 45 degrees.

73
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.335
And let's do top right, so

74
00:04:58.335 --> 00:05:03.533
you see it's slightly different.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

75
00:05:03.533 --> 00:05:07.103
just to reiterate the point
between 45 degrees.

76
00:05:07.103 --> 00:05:11.406
The one that says 45 degrees, the angle,
that grading is never gonna change.

77
00:05:11.406 --> 00:05:16.935
The box is gonna get taller or shorter but
it's not gonna change the angle.

78
00:05:16.935 --> 00:05:20.462
Whereas the top right will
actually change its location.

79
00:05:20.462 --> 00:05:25.218
So you see the 45 degree is that angle
that's still exactly the way it was

80
00:05:25.218 --> 00:05:29.529
whereas the gradient line in the two
top right is almost vertical.

81
00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:35.061
And here, it's closer to horizontal,
whereas this one is still 45 degrees.

82
00:05:35.061 --> 00:05:37.889
So two top right and
45 degrees aren't actually different.

83
00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:42.225
So one of the questions that
I got was can you animate it.

84
00:05:42.225 --> 00:05:43.352
And I did it once.

85
00:05:43.352 --> 00:05:47.597
So I did this website called the School
For Machines Who Can't Learn Good and

86
00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:51.775
Want to Do Other Stuff Good Too.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

87
00:05:51.775 --> 00:05:54.188
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And there's two easter

88
00:05:54.188 --> 00:05:56.119
eggs on this page.

89
00:05:56.119 --> 00:06:02.639
One is the light switch, and then the
other one is an animated radial gradient.

90
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:09.278
And it doesn't animate very well.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

91
00:06:09.278 --> 00:06:16.250
it is possible to animate, but
it's kind of not the best thing to do.

92
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.050
So let's move on.

93
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.047
And continue on gradients, and
we'll actually talk about maybe animating

94
00:06:23.047 --> 00:06:25.018
the gradient when we talk
about animations later on.
