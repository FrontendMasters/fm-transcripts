00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.608
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
in this example, there is striping.

2
00:00:05.608 --> 00:00:09.236
And this is how we used to do striping
before we actually realized it's much

3
00:00:09.236 --> 00:00:11.550
easier to do with
repeating linear gradients.

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.634
So reason this one works is
because it's exactly 135 degrees,

5
00:00:16.634 --> 00:00:21.625
and because the first quarter of
the image, the top left corner is

6
00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:26.285
transparent, and
the bottom right corner is transparent.

7
00:00:26.285 --> 00:00:29.556
And so it's basically
the same color is repeating,

8
00:00:29.556 --> 00:00:31.722
so it's being placed on top of it.

9
00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:35.995
If I actually change the degrees,
and I don't think I can,

10
00:00:35.995 --> 00:00:40.626
cuz I don't think this is live,
130, no, yep, it is.

11
00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:45.580
You see how it breaks,
and you see how it breaks?

12
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.857
It's just basically cuz
it's perfectly measured to,

13
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:54.399
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 135 degrees.

14
00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:01.309
A much easier way to do it is to say
let's do a repeating linear gradient.

15
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.450
Now, it repeats, and
the last color is purple.

16
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.260
So right here,

17
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.130
you'll see that I'm using pixels,
length units, instead of percentages.

18
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:24.726
Now if I change the last one to 20%,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: They

19
00:01:24.726 --> 00:01:27.560
would repeat five times across the page.

20
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.180
Because the last color stop,
the length unit of the last color stop,

21
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.490
whatever that length is,
that is the width of your gradient.

22
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.530
That is your gradient size.

23
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:46.030
So here, before I had 120 pixels, so
each line of color was 20 pixels wide.

24
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.670
And when it reached the 120 pixel mark,
it started again with the color red.

25
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.976
So repeating linear gradients
take the exact same syntax,

26
00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:58.322
except for it says repeating in
front of the word linear gradient.

27
00:01:58.322 --> 00:02:02.863
So it's repeating-linear-gradient
instead of linear-gradient.

28
00:02:02.863 --> 00:02:07.216
You can do to top right,

29
00:02:07.216 --> 00:02:12.234
to top left, same angles.

30
00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.814
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 45 degrees would
be the same, degrees, right?

31
00:02:21.814 --> 00:02:28.144
And notice if I say 0, that's not valid.

32
00:02:28.144 --> 00:02:33.798
But okay, I guess it did work,
because that's a default.

33
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.852
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So let's go back to
an angle, 135 degrees, cuz I like that.

34
00:02:40.852 --> 00:02:44.844
So,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This gradient is going

35
00:02:44.844 --> 00:02:48.020
from red to orange to yellow
to green to blue to purple.

36
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.820
And the last purple, the last spot,
is the 120 pixel mark.

37
00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.472
That means my gradient is 120
pixels wide and then it repeats.

38
00:03:02.472 --> 00:03:07.335
So the other gradient is
basically from 0 to the 100% mark,

39
00:03:07.335 --> 00:03:09.868
unless you use background size.

40
00:03:09.868 --> 00:03:14.525
So if I did actually background size,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I

41
00:03:14.525 --> 00:03:15.405
can't do that on this one.

42
00:03:15.405 --> 00:03:20.720
Let's copy this over,
and go back two slides.

43
00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:28.078
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
put in background-image, right?

44
00:03:28.078 --> 00:03:36.449
If I did background-size,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 120 pixels.

45
00:03:40.694 --> 00:03:41.979
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Semi-colon.

46
00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:45.281
I would start getting really ugly stuff.

47
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.953
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If I did 240 pixels,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's perfect.

48
00:03:55.953 --> 00:03:57.573
2,400 pixels, that's why.

49
00:03:57.573 --> 00:03:59.384
240 pixels, it's still ugly.

50
00:03:59.384 --> 00:04:02.094
But it's repeating twice
within each gradient.

51
00:04:02.094 --> 00:04:04.397
You see how in this box right here,

52
00:04:04.397 --> 00:04:08.378
in this background-image,
the size is 240 by 240.

53
00:04:08.378 --> 00:04:11.994
Let's just do background-repeat,
no-repeat, so I can point it out.

54
00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:23.139
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so you see here,
there's more than two red lines.

55
00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.709
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And the reason there's
more than two red lines is because,

56
00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:37.870
it's basically there's two blue lines,
there's two purple lines.

57
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.950
But there's a little bit more room, it's
because of where the gradient line goes.

58
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.983
If I actually did zero degrees,
there would be two of each.

59
00:04:47.164 --> 00:04:48.396
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Actually no,
there's more than two of each.

60
00:04:48.396 --> 00:04:50.173
I don't know what I'm talking about.

61
00:04:50.173 --> 00:04:57.994
Let's do it 90 degrees.

62
00:05:00.757 --> 00:05:02.073
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,
there it's exactly two.

63
00:05:02.073 --> 00:05:04.769
There's two red lines,
there's two purple lines.

64
00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:08.055
But if I did percentage, right, and

65
00:05:08.055 --> 00:05:13.015
I did,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 50%,

66
00:05:15.038 --> 00:05:17.257
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's the exact same.

67
00:05:17.257 --> 00:05:23.419
But if I did 100%,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Basically,

68
00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:30.289
the purple goes from the 100 pixels to 240
because my background image is 240 pixels.

69
00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:34.905
And then if I did repeat,
it would actually repeat.

70
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.355
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so one other thing
in gradients before I move off this slide

71
00:05:53.355 --> 00:05:57.081
is, you don't want to mix
percentages with lengths,

72
00:05:57.081 --> 00:06:01.536
because if you mix percentages
with lengths, that percentage,

73
00:06:01.536 --> 00:06:07.000
when I said 50%, if it was 240 pixels,
that would have been great.

74
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.740
But what if I change my
background size to 60 pixels?

75
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.579
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So you can mix, but
it can have unintended consequences.
