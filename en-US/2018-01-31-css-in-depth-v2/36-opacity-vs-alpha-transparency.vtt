&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: AlphaTransparency is
what we've been talking about so far,

2
00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:08.030
which is changing the color, right?

3
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.630
Your color is not fully opaque.

4
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.410
And that is the color of
some foreground element.

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.823
So here we have, the color is black.

6
00:00:19.823 --> 00:00:26.602
And then the background color
is some form of orange?

7
00:00:26.602 --> 00:00:28.386
No, some form of blue.

8
00:00:28.386 --> 00:00:31.931
I have no clue, cuz background-color
all looks white to me and so

9
00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.130
I think I should have read border color.

10
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.609
And so I basically get more and
more transparent as I go by, but

11
00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.762
it's actually the color
that's getting transparent.

12
00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:45.585
The thing itself is still white, right?

13
00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:49.698
Because if it wasn't white,
if the background color wasn't white,

14
00:00:49.698 --> 00:00:52.430
fully opaque,
you'd see what was behind it.

15
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.851
When you have opacity,

16
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:57.773
it's actually the whole element
that is becoming transparent.

17
00:00:57.773 --> 00:01:00.890
So here, the top one is opacity 1.

18
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.554
The second one is opacity 75%,
opacity 50%, opacity 25% and

19
00:01:05.554 --> 00:01:10.699
the one that has opacity 0, you can't
see that there was a div there, at all.

20
00:01:10.699 --> 00:01:18.725
Because the whole thing became fully the
opposite of opaque, which is transparent.

21
00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:21.355
Here you still have the white,

22
00:01:21.355 --> 00:01:26.932
because only the color of the shadow,
it should be shadow color.

23
00:01:26.932 --> 00:01:29.881
And the color of the text
became transparent.

24
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:33.740
But you still have
the shadow on that text and

25
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.418
you still have the background
that is fully opaque.

26
00:01:38.418 --> 00:01:42.450
Here the text, the shadow, the background,

27
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.890
all of it became transparent, because
the opacity was set on the element.

28
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.880
And everything went to transparent.

29
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.700
So that's the difference between
AlphaTransparency and opacity.

30
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.590
Which really doesn't make it that
much of a difference in your life,

31
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.430
until you get stuck on explaining
to someone, basically.

32
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.250
So AlphaTransparency tips,
transparent shadows are awesome.

33
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.948
Instead of using a value like CCC for
a gray shadow, or 999 which is

34
00:02:12.948 --> 00:02:17.970
the one on the bottom, use something
like transparent RGBA with 0.3 or

35
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.020
0.2, because then you can
see stuff in the background.

36
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.257
Especially if it's over and image or
something with changing colors.

37
00:02:26.257 --> 00:02:29.769
This looks completely artificial and
this looks very natural on top of stuff.
