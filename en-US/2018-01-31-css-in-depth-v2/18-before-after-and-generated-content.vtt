00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.800
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Then we have generated
content with before and after.

2
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.620
So this is content that doesn't exist but
you can add content to it.

3
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.460
So before and after don't exist on the
page whereas first letter and selection

4
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.860
and first line, which we haven't covered
yet actually exists, they are on the page.

5
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.240
There is a first line of text,
there is a letter on the page,

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.070
there is something that you selected.

7
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.060
Generated content has no content in it.

8
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.900
You have to always add the content
property with a value or

9
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.100
there is nothing to style.

10
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.330
So within every element that
is not an empty element.

11
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.270
As in not an image and not an input,
you can create generated content.

12
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.033
It is actually supported in some
browsers in empty elements,

13
00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:54.256
but there's no before or
after in a replaced element.

14
00:00:54.256 --> 00:00:59.820
If you have a hard line, an HR or
horizontal rule, what's before and after?

15
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.420
I don't know.

16
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.230
So generally use it only on elements
that have an opening and closing tag.

17
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.030
So here we put content.

18
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.552
That says before content with is dash.

19
00:01:12.552 --> 00:01:13.879
And we made it bold.

20
00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:19.360
And then after we put content, that says
dash after content and we made it bold.

21
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.970
Our paragraph itself just
said the content, and

22
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.820
this is what it looks like after.

23
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.280
And if you see, I can only highlight,
I'm trying to highlight,

24
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.490
I can only highlight the actually
content of that paragraph.

25
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.510
Not the before and
after cuz it's not part of the DOM.

26
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.960
It's not on the page.

27
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.610
When I do this generated content
it is as if I put a P and

28
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.300
right after the opening,
before the contents of my paragraph,

29
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.140
whether that was another element,
would be the before.

30
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.040
These don't actually exist.

31
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.200
These are faux elements that I created.

32
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.190
But it's as if there was a before and
as if there was an after.

33
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.426
So here if you wanna play with it,
there's the word are.

34
00:02:04.426 --> 00:02:08.550
And it says p space
are space end paragraph.

35
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.875
And you can put anything here.

36
00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:16.330
Kittens are cute.

37
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.180
There, we had kittens in this talk and
now it's officially a tech talk.

38
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.970
But you can also do,
I think it's like U468.

39
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.360
Maybe it's this, yeah.

40
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.238
You can also put weird
characters in there.

41
00:02:32.238 --> 00:02:35.245
I don't know what that character is.

42
00:02:35.245 --> 00:02:38.460
I have no clue what that character is.

43
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.458
One, there.

44
00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:44.350
We're gonna talk about
that a little bit later.

45
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.240
As you saw earlier,
I generated content with the counter.

46
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.510
I'm going, there's a whole
section on generated content.

47
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.004
So I'm gonna go deep into
generated content right now.

48
00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:02.040
I'm gonna go deep into generated
content in, like, five minutes.

49
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.760
So I do wanna cover other pseudo-elements.

50
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.115
So there was a selection.

51
00:03:06.115 --> 00:03:09.457
There was inactive-selection,
spelling error, grammar error, and

52
00:03:09.457 --> 00:03:11.340
these are future ones.

53
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.974
And then there is also content
placeholder and marker,

54
00:03:13.974 --> 00:03:17.911
which are future pseudo-elements, which
I'm not sure are fully supported yet.
