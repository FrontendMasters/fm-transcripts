00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.063
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
this is a quick little section and

2
00:00:07.063 --> 00:00:10.160
we're gonna talk about media types and
screen sizes.

3
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.839
So we're not gonna talk
about screen resolution.

4
00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.538
We're not gonna talk about
device capability, but

5
00:00:14.538 --> 00:00:16.880
we are gonna talk about
browser capability.

6
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.678
So originally in CSS 2.1,
we were provided with media queries.

7
00:00:21.678 --> 00:00:26.508
And the media queries were basically what
type of device is going to be presented in

8
00:00:26.508 --> 00:00:27.703
this information.

9
00:00:27.703 --> 00:00:32.509
So we had oral which was spoken.

10
00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:39.510
Handheld which back then was
a phone without a real browser.

11
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.370
Braille embossed which print,
projection, screen, TTY, and TV.

12
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.450
Because we thought that televisions were
gonna have their own way to display in

13
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.230
the web, not using your browser.

14
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.190
Pretty much it's the browser
used everywhere.

15
00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.530
On a TV, it's a browser.

16
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.550
On your smart phone,
it's definitely a browser.

17
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.980
In your car, it's definitely a browser.

18
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.013
So we definitely,
still have print and screen,

19
00:01:12.013 --> 00:01:15.903
and there's also aural and braille.

20
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.940
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
we basically have tons of devices.

21
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.849
And we have everything from things that
are way larger than this screen here.

22
00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:33.342
What is showing on the screen here
it is a picture of my computer,

23
00:01:33.342 --> 00:01:39.590
we're not targeting the projector or we're
not targeting the whiteness of the screen,

24
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.433
we're targeting the browser that
is then being shown on the screen.

25
00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:47.579
So this is definitely a browser,
it's definitely a screen.

26
00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.782
All of these have our screen and
there's a fake ruler at the top.

27
00:01:52.782 --> 00:01:57.790
Which basically, it's how many inches and
you have centimeters or whatever.

28
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.736
You have the watch which is hopefully,
less than 10 centimeters,

29
00:02:01.736 --> 00:02:04.194
but I've seen some crazy looking things.

30
00:02:04.194 --> 00:02:08.060
You have cellphones which are a bit
bigger, the guy sitting next to me on

31
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.490
the plane had something like this big and
it said Verizon on it.

32
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.960
I'm like, that is not a phone,
please tell me that's not a phone.

33
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.400
It wasn't, it was a small tablet, but
I was scared, I was definitely scared.

34
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.150
Then we have tablets that,

35
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.950
there was someone on the plane with
a tablet that was bigger than my laptop.

36
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.674
So I have a laptop that's 15 inches,
most people have 13 inch.

37
00:02:28.674 --> 00:02:34.170
I don't use a separate screen so
I really need as much here.

38
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.090
And then, at home I have
a Google Chrome box on my 72 inch TV.

39
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.120
And it might not be a 72 inch TV.

40
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.069
To me it's huge, but it's smaller than
a bar TV, so I don't know what size it is.

41
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.241
You want to provide sometimes different
looks and feels to different devices.

42
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:58.446
You definitely don't
want to do a widescreen,

43
00:02:58.446 --> 00:03:03.080
you don't want to send this
deck as is to that watch.

44
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.460
They're not going to be able to read it,
it's 960 pixels wide.

45
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.560
And that is fixed,
because my deck is not responsive.

46
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.320
Sorry, you can't watch
this deck on your watch.

47
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.590
So to target that we have
media queries and so,

48
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.389
one of the things we can ask
is we can say in the CSS,

49
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.890
we can tell the CSS and say, hey,
if something is 600 pixels wide or

50
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.714
smaller then send them the CSS.

51
00:03:35.714 --> 00:03:39.770
If something has the orientation
of portrait which means it is

52
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.530
taller than it is wide send them this CSS.

53
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.840
If it's landscape, which means it's
wider than it is tall, add this feature.

54
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.080
I think this deck will change colors,
I'm not sure.

55
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.423
Let's try it.
Does this change colors?

56
00:04:00.423 --> 00:04:01.526
I think I removed it.

57
00:04:01.526 --> 00:04:02.478
Yeah, no, it does.

58
00:04:02.478 --> 00:04:06.985
When it turns from when it is smaller than

59
00:04:06.985 --> 00:04:12.260
600 pixels, it actually goes red.

60
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.600
And when it is taller than it is wide,
it turns yellow.

61
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.980
You can see that by the back
color right there on top.

62
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.105
So you see now it's yellow,
because it's portrait.

63
00:04:22.105 --> 00:04:26.553
A portrait, it might be,
portrait, it's yellow.

64
00:04:26.553 --> 00:04:30.319
Had it been above
the previous declaration,

65
00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:36.880
they have the exact same specificity,
then it would just stayed red.

66
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.165
But because I declared the red above
the yellow, that's how come it does that.

67
00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:46.170
So that is an example of using
a media query with width, or

68
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.683
max-width in this case, and
orientation to change the color.

69
00:04:53.314 --> 00:04:56.283
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You can put
these media queries in your CSS,

70
00:04:56.283 --> 00:04:58.295
as the previous example did.

71
00:04:58.295 --> 00:05:02.405
Or you can actually add it
directly to your link tag.

72
00:05:02.405 --> 00:05:05.795
It can be an attribute of your link.

73
00:05:05.795 --> 00:05:10.025
It can save media link real stylesheet,
media screen,

74
00:05:10.025 --> 00:05:13.899
blah-blah-blah-blah, called this CSS file.

75
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.478
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Basically,

76
00:05:21.478 --> 00:05:25.513
when you're doing design, you wanted
always use the same aspect ratio, but

77
00:05:25.513 --> 00:05:27.823
you don't want a targeted specific break.

78
00:05:27.823 --> 00:05:32.190
These are the breaks, the sizes of
various devices and I made some red and

79
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.280
some green just so
you can see that there were more.

80
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.460
When it was red,
it just looked like a big blob.

81
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.830
So this code means absolutely nothing.

82
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.033
It's just to show that
there's a lot a lot of dots,

83
00:05:44.033 --> 00:05:46.355
they're all basically on one line.

84
00:05:46.355 --> 00:05:47.170
You know?

85
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.470
They all have the same
pretty much aspect ratio.

86
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.540
But you don't want to
actually pick a break point.

87
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.000
Because it is the iPhone.

88
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.020
You don't want to say 320 and 460.

89
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.640
That is what we used to do.

90
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.534
You want to pick a break point that
makes sense with your design, right?

91
00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:10.020
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Nothing else,
don't think about devices.

92
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.233
Think about the breakpoints like
when my screen is this big,

93
00:06:13.233 --> 00:06:15.314
it starts looking really ridiculous.

94
00:06:15.314 --> 00:06:19.165
If I've one line of text this long,
change with text,

95
00:06:19.165 --> 00:06:23.290
you actually just always wanna
say max width and use M's.

96
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.221
You don't need to use, most times,
you don't need to use media queries.

97
00:06:26.221 --> 00:06:31.894
I very rarely use media queries,
I use widths in terms of Ms and

98
00:06:31.894 --> 00:06:37.692
I say basically, on a paragraph,
max width equals 60 M's.

99
00:06:37.692 --> 00:06:41.325
It means, it will never get
longer than 60 characters.

100
00:06:44.498 --> 00:06:48.848
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It doesn't matter then
what font size the person has that way

101
00:06:48.848 --> 00:06:50.600
the length is stable.

102
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.214
So in terms of media queries, there's
certain properties that we can look at.

103
00:06:54.214 --> 00:07:00.590
We can look at the width and the height
and both of those have max and min.

104
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.580
So if we were to say
width colon 600 pixels,

105
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.960
it would only match,
if it was exactly 600 pixels.

106
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.912
So generally, we wanna use min or
max width min or max height.

107
00:07:13.912 --> 00:07:17.362
And then the same with aspect ratio.

108
00:07:21.575 --> 00:07:23.592
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
then we also have portrait and landscape,

109
00:07:23.592 --> 00:07:24.837
which we've also covered.

110
00:07:24.837 --> 00:07:29.240
And then there's the ones below it which
are like, min/max-color, and color-index,

111
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.942
and monochrome, and
progressive versus interlaced.

112
00:07:31.942 --> 00:07:34.955
I think we are also considering
web development here, so

113
00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:39.060
the bottom stuff doesn't have much to
do with us, so we won't go into those.

114
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:39.619
And also,

115
00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:43.484
I could even if I tried I couldn't
teach you something that I don't know.

116
00:07:43.484 --> 00:07:48.371
So these are the things that
we can actually look at width,

117
00:07:48.371 --> 00:07:53.173
height, aspect-ratio,
orientation, resolution.

118
00:07:53.173 --> 00:07:56.945
Overflow-inline, color,
color-index, display-mode,

119
00:07:56.945 --> 00:08:01.150
inverted-colors, pointer, hover,
these are all media features.

120
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:07.178
Does the primary input mechanism allow
the user to hover over elements?

121
00:08:07.178 --> 00:08:10.498
And that's gonna be in Media Queries 4,
so there's gonna be more and

122
00:08:10.498 --> 00:08:14.230
I'm just presenting this to you so that
you know that these things will exist.

123
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.668
Generally, if you want responsive,
if you want squishy websites,

124
00:08:18.668 --> 00:08:23.350
cuz there's a big difference
between responsive and squishy.

125
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.460
Most of us are developing squishy websites
which means they grow, and they shrink,

126
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.120
and they squish nicely.

127
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.340
Responsive means that you're not
increasing the number of rather you're

128
00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:36.600
decreasing it, and you're not putting
in 45 different JavaScript frameworks.

129
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.485
And making it really slow,
because that's not responsive, and

130
00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:42.117
it's quick to the touch,
that's what responsive means.

131
00:08:42.117 --> 00:08:46.430
It actually responds to user interaction,
and it loads quickly.

132
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:49.220
What people are calling responsive web
design is actually squishy web design.

133
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.810
Not that I have an opinion on that either.

134
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.580
I'm not opinionated on anything.

135
00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:00.678
So resolution units,

136
00:09:00.678 --> 00:09:07.670
we have DPI, DPCM, and DPPX.

137
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.770
Mobile devices have, and even desktops,

138
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.260
have been coming up with
really high DPI features.

139
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.860
And sometimes you wanna serve
them higher resolution images,

140
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.140
cuz it just looks really crisper.

141
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.835
So before you do that you basically,

142
00:09:25.835 --> 00:09:31.806
wanna say like let me serve
this image if my DPCM or

143
00:09:31.806 --> 00:09:37.860
DPI is higher so,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: When

144
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:43.203
you use any of these, don't use number
zero without something afterwards.

145
00:09:43.203 --> 00:09:47.603
Zero, in a lot of lengths,
zero works, when it comes to degrees,

146
00:09:47.603 --> 00:09:49.030
zero doesn't work.

147
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:53.280
Zero, you have to put like degree
after zero for it to be zero degrees.

148
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.230
But if it's like the length is
zero pixels, or zero M's, or

149
00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:01.440
zero CHS, or zero points.

150
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:08.621
Zero works fine for lengths, but
for DPI, DPCM, and DPPX, no, okay.

151
00:10:08.621 --> 00:10:14.469
So in Safari,
we had device pixel ratio and

152
00:10:14.469 --> 00:10:18.043
if you noticed back here,

153
00:10:18.043 --> 00:10:24.056
device aspect ratio,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Is

154
00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:26.408
actually just aspect ratio now.

155
00:10:26.408 --> 00:10:32.376
So the correct way is resolution or
aspect ratio, but not device aspect ratio.

156
00:10:32.376 --> 00:10:34.965
That's why it was crossed out.

157
00:10:34.965 --> 00:10:39.691
You can say min-resolution
of either 2 DPPX or

158
00:10:39.691 --> 00:10:43.720
192 DPI, those are all equivalent.

159
00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.268
Okay, so I'm showing you again that for
Safari it

160
00:10:51.268 --> 00:10:56.011
is -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio,
everyone else min-resolution 192.

161
00:10:56.011 --> 00:11:02.385
And that would be what
your usual phone is.

162
00:11:02.385 --> 00:11:05.159
There are phones that
come up with four times.

163
00:11:05.159 --> 00:11:11.556
My eyesight is, I'm not wearing glasses,
I can see all of you.

164
00:11:11.556 --> 00:11:15.447
I can't tell the difference
between three and four.

165
00:11:15.447 --> 00:11:22.297
When the device pixel ratio is
four verses three verses two.

166
00:11:22.297 --> 00:11:23.724
Two I can see.

167
00:11:23.724 --> 00:11:27.802
I can see it's much crisper than one,
but then you get crisper than that and

168
00:11:27.802 --> 00:11:28.660
I have no clue.

169
00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:36.972
So generally, in images are 72
pixels per inch, maybe 96.

170
00:11:36.972 --> 00:11:39.581
But sometimes we'll see
them served up 300,

171
00:11:39.581 --> 00:11:42.450
which is really nice if
you want to print it.

172
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:47.230
There's no reason to send something
that's 300 pixels per inch to a browser,

173
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:50.292
because it doesn't have
300 pixels to display.

174
00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:54.972
It has usually 196 max and
some mobile devices will have higher, but

175
00:11:54.972 --> 00:11:56.387
you can't see that.

176
00:11:56.387 --> 00:12:01.605
So let's just open this up into

177
00:12:01.605 --> 00:12:07.231
a new window and exit out of this.

178
00:12:07.231 --> 00:12:10.029
So this one you can actually play with.

179
00:12:13.697 --> 00:12:17.714
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: At one point
it changes to a slight gray, and

180
00:12:17.714 --> 00:12:20.870
then light steel blue, see that?

181
00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.070
So the reason that I want,
I pulled it out,

182
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.000
and want you to do it is because
I want you to play with it.

183
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:35.532
So if i just did width of 600 pixels.

184
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.750
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There,
just at that one pixel,

185
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:51.150
we would actually be slate gray, right?

186
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:52.706
They go shorter or bigger.

187
00:12:52.706 --> 00:12:58.740
It isn't anymore, and
I wanna go down lower.

188
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.930
So that's why use min and max, because
what's the point of having one pixel or

189
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.910
something is the unique color.

190
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.890
You're never going to just have one pixel,
so always use min and max.
