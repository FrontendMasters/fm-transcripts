00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.590
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So, remember the counters?

2
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.381
Here's a counter again.

3
00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:10.160
Can anyone tell me what this does?

4
00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:14.580
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay, so-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: When you reload the page,

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.700
it resets the counter?

6
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.670
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Exactly, yeah.

7
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.390
Whenever it hits a body, and there's
only one body, it resets the counter.

8
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.990
Generally, I wouldn't even need that
because it basically also creates

9
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.520
the counter.

10
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.980
The next one, what does this do?

11
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.523
What does that match?

12
00:00:35.464 --> 00:00:37.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Invalid input.

13
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.367
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Exactly, anything that's
invalid, which is generally an input.

14
00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:47.229
And what does it do when
it hits that invalid input?

15
00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:48.721
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Increases the counter.

16
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:52.530
&gt;&gt; Estelle: It increases the counter
with the name invalidCount.

17
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.870
I could have any number
of counters on this page.

18
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.350
Just give each counter a unique name and
then you can go with it.

19
00:01:03.464 --> 00:01:07.205
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And
then here I printed to the page.

20
00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:12.711
So I print the invalidCount counter.

21
00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:20.638
And so whenever,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Whenever

22
00:01:20.638 --> 00:01:23.573
it counters something that's invalid,
it actually does that.

23
00:01:23.573 --> 00:01:26.945
So now I know you understand that.

24
00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:33.803
So here's another example, and this is
the one I was hoping you would play with.

25
00:01:33.803 --> 00:01:41.476
So,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: The reason I have,

26
00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:43.270
okay, so
let's just look at the syntax here.

27
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.530
So here, I have two quotes and
then the counter.

28
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.440
So the reason I have two quotes
is because I have a space there,

29
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.430
because I don't want it to look like that.

30
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.946
So you quote the strings.

31
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.341
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And so I could do paragraphs,

32
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:13.191
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And then I could do that.

33
00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:14.621
And then I could do are.

34
00:02:18.656 --> 00:02:21.296
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And
then I could continue, I can have,

35
00:02:21.296 --> 00:02:24.450
doesn't matter how many quoted strings.

36
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.939
The thing to note is,
it's not interpolated,

37
00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.692
it is just presented as a string.

38
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.618
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay, so,
if you see in the bottom left-hand corner,

39
00:02:36.618 --> 00:02:38.750
I somehow broke my counter.

40
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.770
Because I'm still on slider number three,
right there.

41
00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:50.192
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So there's something wrong
with my counter because it says number

42
00:02:50.192 --> 00:02:55.320
four, and then every time I move over
it just goes back to number three.

43
00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.300
So, what I'm doing,
the way I'm making my slide deck work

44
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.490
is each slide has the class of slide,
and then there's

45
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.430
far past, past, current,
future, and far future.

46
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.685
And I think what I'm doing is I'm
removing the slide class from the slide.

47
00:03:18.685 --> 00:03:22.524
Because I pulled it out of JavaScript, and
I think I pulled an old version of this

48
00:03:22.524 --> 00:03:25.064
JavaScript, which created
these a different way.

49
00:03:25.064 --> 00:03:30.822
So the way the slide is created,
it toggles the slide class on and

50
00:03:30.822 --> 00:03:35.830
off every time it gets a class
of either far past, past,

51
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:43.074
current, future, far future, those
are the only ones with the slide class.

52
00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:46.081
Actually no, it's not that, it's all
of the others have a display of none so

53
00:03:46.081 --> 00:03:48.273
they don't exist, and so
they're not being counted.

54
00:03:48.273 --> 00:03:53.123
It's one of those two things that are
happening, either I'm removing the slide

55
00:03:53.123 --> 00:03:57.274
class from those or it's display none,
so it's not being counted.

56
00:03:57.274 --> 00:04:01.073
And that's why there's just one
through five in this deck and

57
00:04:01.073 --> 00:04:03.493
that's all you're ever going to see.

58
00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:07.794
And I'm pretty sure it's the not counting
the display none, which is the reason,

59
00:04:07.794 --> 00:04:10.013
cuz I'm not sure which JavaScript I used.
