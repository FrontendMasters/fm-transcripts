00:00:02.617 --> 00:00:05.680
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So now let's move
on to transitions and animations.

2
00:00:07.856 --> 00:00:10.502
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If you
are following along,

3
00:00:10.502 --> 00:00:16.352
the URL is
estelle.github.io/cssmastery/animations.

4
00:00:16.352 --> 00:00:19.746
If you haven't heard me say this before,
all you have to do is remember my name,

5
00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:22.670
Estelle, go to my GitHub,
estelle.github.io.

6
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.420
And either look for the CSS mastery class
and click on the Animations link or

7
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.266
go to CSS mastery and
you'll find the link there.

8
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.960
So first lets talk about transitions.

9
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.170
Now I can ask the question.

10
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.686
Who here has ever done a transition?

11
00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:43.930
Everyone has, because everyone has
changed a link color on hover, right?

12
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.246
That's a transition.

13
00:00:45.246 --> 00:00:48.808
It is a transition over 0 seconds.

14
00:00:48.808 --> 00:00:53.954
You can say take a full second to do it
and you have really bad user experience.

15
00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:56.289
But you can do it.

16
00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.606
You can also say, basically, all
the lengths take two seconds before you

17
00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:07.456
transition as a nice little April Fool's
joke or a horrible April Fool's joke.

18
00:01:07.456 --> 00:01:09.867
Okay, so let's talk a little bit
about the transition properties.

19
00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:11.937
I just showed you how
simple a transition is.

20
00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:15.211
You just basically say,
do it over one second, we're good.

21
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:17.136
But we have several transition properties.

22
00:01:17.136 --> 00:01:19.352
We have the transition-property property,

23
00:01:19.352 --> 00:01:21.690
which is the properties
you want to transition.

24
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.120
The key term all, which is the default.

25
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.673
Your transition duration which is
how long should the transition take.

26
00:01:27.673 --> 00:01:31.963
You have transition timing function which
is a bezier curve of transition and

27
00:01:31.963 --> 00:01:35.004
we'll go to deep dive into
this during the animation.

28
00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:37.670
So if you don't understand that yet,
don't worry.

29
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.082
Transition delay is the seconds or
milliseconds and

30
00:01:41.082 --> 00:01:46.055
it is required that you include the s or
the ms before the transition starts.

31
00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:49.919
The ms and the s are both required for
transition duration and transition delay.

32
00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:54.898
And then there's the transition, which
is shorthand for all four properties.

33
00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:59.553
So, in this example, ooh, that is bad.

34
00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:01.635
But, yes, it is transitioning.

35
00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:04.323
On hover, when I hover over the code,

36
00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:08.190
the color goes from black to red maybe,
I don't know.

37
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.790
The font size goes from 85% to 120%.

38
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.900
The background color goes from white
opaque to white slightly less opaque.

39
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.468
And here we go.

40
00:02:22.468 --> 00:02:24.480
It actually is blue not red.

41
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.738
The color used to be red on this deck and
I changed it to blue.

42
00:02:27.738 --> 00:02:30.480
I did a global search and
replace and this is what happens.

43
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.755
So basically it's the same as writing.

44
00:02:37.755 --> 00:02:42.938
So what I wrote, my transition code is
code, transition, color, font-size,

45
00:02:42.938 --> 00:02:47.984
and background size over 2s, ease in,
but wait 50 more seconds for it to go.

46
00:02:47.984 --> 00:02:52.456
So if I go like this, it can start
transitioning coz I was off that slide for

47
00:02:52.456 --> 00:02:54.343
less than 50 milliseconds.

48
00:02:54.343 --> 00:02:58.942
If you gonna do a transition effect on
a link other than just changing the color,

49
00:02:58.942 --> 00:03:03.750
it's good to wait 50 milliseconds just in
case someone is dragging their mouth so

50
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.142
in part page the other.

51
00:03:05.142 --> 00:03:09.592
50 milliseconds is not long enough for
someone to notice the delay, but

52
00:03:09.592 --> 00:03:12.629
having something jump out
at them is noticeable.

53
00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.779
I could have also written all,
2 seconds ease in 50 milliseconds.

54
00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:21.835
What is transitioning is any property
that is from the previous state to

55
00:03:21.835 --> 00:03:22.993
the current state.

56
00:03:28.955 --> 00:03:32.570
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: A better effect because
you saw how choppy that was, right?

57
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.152
Would be to actually use transforms.

58
00:03:37.152 --> 00:03:41.120
So here, look how nice and smooth that is.

59
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.647
The problem is because I'm
transforming it I'm growing it, right?

60
00:03:45.647 --> 00:03:48.351
Before, I was pushing the bottom
code down and here I'm not,

61
00:03:48.351 --> 00:03:49.912
I'm actually going right over it.

62
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.489
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
when you're transitioning something,

63
00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.547
the stacking context comes up.

64
00:04:00.547 --> 00:04:04.732
So that's why,
cuz the index might be the exact same, but

65
00:04:04.732 --> 00:04:10.640
that code is gonna be on top of it because
the bottom one is not being transitioned.

66
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.612
So this is a better effect,
has better performance but

67
00:04:13.612 --> 00:04:15.427
it might not the effect you want.

68
00:04:15.427 --> 00:04:16.203
Yes.

69
00:04:16.203 --> 00:04:20.644
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Keep the same items, in the
flow of the page when you're transforming

70
00:04:20.644 --> 00:04:21.716
it like that and making it big.

71
00:04:21.716 --> 00:04:23.407
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah,
nothing else would have moved.

72
00:04:23.407 --> 00:04:27.089
It's only repainting that one element and
it's growing it bigger.
