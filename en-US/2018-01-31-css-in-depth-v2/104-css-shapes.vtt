00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.550
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Then we have clip-path and
shape-outside, so I'm taking this image,

2
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.440
and I'm gonna make a 30,
I'm gonna make it a 30-pixel circle.

3
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.670
The problem is my text is
still all the way over there.

4
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.090
So I was able to change the clip-path or
clip my image using clip-path, And

5
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.610
I use circle but
I could also use ellipse or polygon.

6
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.770
But to make it really cool,
I'm gonna shape the text around it.

7
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.665
So you see how that shape
goes around that circle?

8
00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:35.246
I'm gonna change the image
to an ellipse and

9
00:00:35.246 --> 00:00:39.270
I'm gonna change the text around
to follow that same side.

10
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.750
So what I did is I just
declared a clip-path, and

11
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.590
then I declared en ellipse with
the exact same properties.

12
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.460
I could have made it a slightly different
so that there was more space, or

13
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.770
I could have put padding,
or margin, rather.

14
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.890
Now I'm gonna do a polygon,
which is a triangle.

15
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.670
And again I made the text go outside it.

16
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.640
The thing is you can't actually
put the text over here yet.

17
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.390
So let's do a few more.

18
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.659
I have a cat and
the text is going around it.

19
00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.320
And now it's a more triangular shape and
the text is going around it.

20
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.970
If you wanted to do more complex shapes,
you can actually do a clip path and

21
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.130
give it the URL of an image.

22
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.820
So here I have a heart, and
I basically clip it to match the heart.

23
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:38.000
So the idea of this heart is here, and
so I made the cat in a shape of a heart.

24
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.920
Here I have my avatar which is the stem
plumber, he's fixing the pipeline,

25
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.830
and i did shape outside of a polygon and
I did clip path polygon.

26
00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.109
So I actually used a tool to do this, and

27
00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:05.004
I know better than to try to
make that tool work during

28
00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:11.029
a presentation cuz it always fails
when I try to present with it.

29
00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:17.389
So I said I know better but
I'm gonna do it anyway.

30
00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.735
So if I go to Elements,

31
00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:26.156
pick this,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: You can

32
00:02:26.156 --> 00:02:31.695
see that I have the shape outside here and
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I

33
00:02:31.695 --> 00:02:36.004
have this thing called shapes,
I put this extension here

34
00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:40.770
and
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I told you it wouldn't work.

35
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.582
So I have this extension
that allows me to do shapes.

36
00:02:46.582 --> 00:02:51.582
And you can see where the shape is,
right, where it's darker, but

37
00:02:51.582 --> 00:02:56.519
I can never actually get this to work for
me during a presentation.

38
00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.150
It does actually work, though.

39
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.673
So it's the shapes editor, and
it's just a Chrome extension.
