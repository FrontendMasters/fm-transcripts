00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.500
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So what properties,
with animated some properties,

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.050
with transition but really it's
an animation of those properties,

3
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.140
which properties are animatable?

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.900
Anything which has a midpoint
that you could define,

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.090
is transitionable or animatable.

6
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.947
So when you go from
opacity: 1 to opacity: 0,

7
00:00:19.947 --> 00:00:23.234
you can figure out that
the midpoint is opacity 0.5.

8
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.590
But when you go from display block to
display none, what is the midpoint?

9
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.930
There is none.

10
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.340
So display is not transitionable,
or animatable, but

11
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.244
opacity is.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You can go from font size

12
00:00:39.244 --> 00:00:44.639
100 to font size 120 and you know
that the midpoint is font size 110.

13
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.990
But you can't go from code height: auto
to height: 1000 pixels, cuz what is auto?

14
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.390
You actually can,
it will allow you to, but

15
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.750
you don't know what effect
it's going to have.

16
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.451
The best thing to do is to
actually use min-height.

17
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:04.670
So you say min-height: 0,
which is auto, right?

18
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.360
It's gonna view whatever
height it needs to be.

19
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.740
Min height 1000 that's going
to go to a thousand and

20
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.720
then you know that the midpoint is 500.

21
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.530
So it's a rule of thumb.

22
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.350
It's not exact, but, generally, if you
can think in your head where the midpoint

23
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.540
would be,
then you can assume that it's animateable.

24
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.040
This is a list of
transitionable properties.

25
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.390
It's probably grown,
because there are more properties now.

26
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.050
But all of these, you can kinda come up
with a midpoint, except for visibility.

27
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.800
Visibility is transitionable, at the 100%
mark it goes from hidden to visible, or

28
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.990
visible to hidden.

29
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.780
Depending which direction you're going in,
so

30
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.480
it is something you can put
in a transition property.

31
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.350
It won't break it, but
it's slightly different.

32
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.140
Okay, so a few tips and tricks.

33
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.910
Okay, so here I wanna talk a little
bit about the transition placement.

34
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:12.300
So I'm saying transition 3 seconds,
and it's going to steps.

35
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.292
And we haven't covered steps, but

36
00:02:13.292 --> 00:02:16.298
that's a timing function.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

37
00:02:16.298 --> 00:02:21.835
when it goes to invalid,
when it's invalid, it will transition but

38
00:02:21.835 --> 00:02:26.140
it won't transition when
you go from valid to focus.

39
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.550
So I'm gonna click in here and you saw,

40
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.250
it didn't transition because it's
going from green to yellow, but

41
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.790
when I put in a three, no, yes.

42
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.475
If I put in a three, it's not gonna
be valid and it's gonna transition to

43
00:02:42.475 --> 00:02:47.757
red.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Apparently it did not.

44
00:02:47.757 --> 00:02:49.012
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right.

45
00:02:49.012 --> 00:02:52.910
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah thank you.

46
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.418
So it did it in three steps so it's
a little bit weird let's just do linear.

47
00:03:04.673 --> 00:03:05.247
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay and

48
00:03:05.247 --> 00:03:08.700
now I'm gonna go up and
it's gonna become valid.

49
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.430
It went to focus first cuz focus is last.

50
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.791
Let's just put this X here.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

51
00:03:17.791 --> 00:03:20.964
I'm gonna go to three.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

52
00:03:20.964 --> 00:03:23.304
you see as linearly
moving from green to red.

53
00:03:23.304 --> 00:03:28.993
And then four

54
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.560
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Seven.

55
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.038
It's going back to red.

56
00:03:40.038 --> 00:03:43.853
And then if I put focus
right there when it

57
00:03:43.853 --> 00:03:48.567
goes from green to yellow
it will not animate, but

58
00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:52.720
only when it goes from
red to either yellow or

59
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.434
red to green and
I need to put this back on the bottom

60
00:03:57.434 --> 00:04:01.840
because when I go focus
it should turn yellow.

61
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.480
And there we go.

62
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.210
So the source order actually mattered.

63
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.330
Because otherwise, they all have
the exact same specificity, right?

64
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.325
They're all at 011.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So for

65
00:04:15.325 --> 00:04:20.661
it actually to change colors
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It

66
00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:27.613
had to be able to get to that color.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

67
00:04:27.613 --> 00:04:30.920
transition features,
there's a single iteration.

68
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.970
With animations,
you can do multiple iterations.

69
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.420
The reverse when you go from, so here we
went from red to yellow and yellow to red.

70
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.070
So one direction was from red to yellow
and then reverse, yellow to red,

71
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:51.220
it's the exact same transition unless you
declare it a transition in both places.

72
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.579
So I could do, let's do steps and

73
00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:06.213
then two seconds
transitions two seconds and

74
00:05:06.213 --> 00:05:12.052
then linear
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

75
00:05:12.052 --> 00:05:16.566
when I give it focus it's gonna
change to yellow then nearly and

76
00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:23.349
when I remove focus, it's still invalid.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That

77
00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:32.295
didn't work.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I

78
00:05:32.295 --> 00:05:33.310
didn't declare it correctly.

79
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.460
Okay, so here it goes to yellow slowly.

80
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.500
And when I remove focus,
it goes to red in a jerk fashion.

81
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.950
So as it goes to red,
it follows the steps.

82
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.075
As it goes to yellow,
it follows the linear,

83
00:05:52.075 --> 00:05:57.270
right?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

84
00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.790
one of the problems with the transition is
there's a limited method of initiation.

85
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.982
So here you saw that I did a focus.

86
00:06:05.982 --> 00:06:10.523
You can do it on the change of a class,
but you have to actually change the class.

87
00:06:10.523 --> 00:06:12.600
You can do it on hover.

88
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.300
There's limited ways to initiate it,
and you can't force them to finish.

89
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.740
If I go like this, and
then step out of it, it went back.

90
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.340
You see it didn't make it
all the way to yellow, and

91
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.800
in one direction it was linear, and in
the other direction it did the five steps.
