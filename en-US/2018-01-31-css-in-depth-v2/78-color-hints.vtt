00:00:02.867 --> 00:00:05.800
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
next we have color hints.

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.540
So so
far I've been giving you color stops and

3
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.400
each color stop has been
associated with a color.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.370
But you can actually say where do you
want that gradient midpoint to be?

5
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.670
So every gradient so far has been
a midpoint between two color stops, right?

6
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.072
Or everything has grown gradually,

7
00:00:27.072 --> 00:00:31.610
linearly, no switch in flow.

8
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.280
It's not like it's easing in.

9
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.320
You can actually change where
that midpoint is and define it.

10
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.760
You can use any length unit,
the percent is relative to the image size,

11
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.760
not to the area between the two points.

12
00:00:52.338 --> 00:00:54.040
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
let's just look at these.

13
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.357
So the first one is going
Rebecca purple at the 0% mark

14
00:00:59.357 --> 00:01:04.260
to pale golden
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

15
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.010
they all are going,
these are not editable.

16
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.668
These are all to the right, right?

17
00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:12.469
So it's good from rebeccapurple on
the left to palegoldenrod on the right.

18
00:01:14.078 --> 00:01:17.528
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: The second
one is going rebeccapurple,

19
00:01:17.528 --> 00:01:21.310
at the 50% mark is the midpoint.

20
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.020
And then it's going to pale golden run.

21
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.300
There's a slight difference between these
two images but you probably can't see it.

22
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.938
It eases in or
it eases around the 50% mark.

23
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.450
It's not obvious enough to see.

24
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.430
The next one says linear gradient
rebeccapurple, 20%, palegoldenrod.

25
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.960
The midpoint between these two colors,
between the purple and

26
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.680
the yellow, is here at the 20% mark.

27
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.200
So this color right here,
you're gonna find it right here.

28
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.550
And this one says,
make it at the 80% mark.

29
00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.120
So the midpoint is right there.

30
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.860
Hard to tell, I know.

31
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.287
So let's look at it slightly differently.

32
00:02:07.132 --> 00:02:10.660
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
here I have two linear gradients.

33
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.360
They both start with red, orange,
yellow, green, blue and then purple.

34
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.150
The red is at this zero mark, the orange
is at the 20vh mark, the yellow is at

35
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.620
the 40, the green is at the 60, the blue
is at the 80 and the purple is at 100.

36
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.430
Same thing here, red, orange 20,
yellow 40, green 60, blue 80,

37
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.670
and then purple 100.

38
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.250
The difference is I put
these gradient stops in.

39
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.200
Since I put zero, the zero is actually
this point here and so it breaks it.

40
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.900
Basically, it does that thing where
it's like, you didn't go in order?

41
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.982
But I could have done,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 20vh,

42
00:02:53.982 --> 00:03:00.516
40vh, 60vh, 80vh.

43
00:03:03.255 --> 00:03:06.720
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So that's the same
effect as giving hard color stops.

44
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.780
So instead of saying, repeating all those
color stops, you can just give a hint and

45
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.120
say I want the midpoint to be
the start of the next color.

46
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.257
So here I'm saying go from red to orange,
from the 0% to the 20% mark and

47
00:03:20.257 --> 00:03:24.590
I want the midpoint of the gradient
to be at the 20% mark,

48
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.080
which is exactly where
the orange is declared.

49
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.850
And it's going from orange at the 20
vh mark to yellow at the 40 vh mark.

50
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.550
But I want the gradient midpoint between
the orange and yellow to be at the 40 vh

51
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.600
mark which is the exact same
point as where the yellow starts.

52
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.119
If you wanna do a little bit of
a gradient between hard stops,

53
00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:52.555
you could just do 18,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 58

54
00:03:54.683 --> 00:03:55.964
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 78.

55
00:03:55.964 --> 00:03:59.425
And so you have a teeny bit of
a gradient in between these things, and

56
00:03:59.425 --> 00:04:05.826
I missed the one here which would be
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 98.

57
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.090
There, so I have a little bit
of a gradient between them.

58
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.730
This is so ugly,
I'm really good at making things ugly.

59
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.490
And this is supposed to be 18, okay.

60
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.810
So color stops make sense?

61
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.914
Do you wanna play with this for
like 30 seconds?

62
00:04:32.385 --> 00:04:34.240
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
next we'll go on to direction.

63
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.020
Let's play with it and
we'll give you 30 seconds and then-

64
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.842
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Like a comma between the red

65
00:04:40.842 --> 00:04:42.564
and the 18 vh.

66
00:04:42.564 --> 00:04:46.228
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So the red is 0vh.

67
00:04:46.228 --> 00:04:47.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, got you.

68
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.590
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
the purple is 100vh, so

69
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.290
you do see a tiny bit of purple
in the bottom way down here.

70
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.517
And here, this would be if I had
just done a gradient with no,

71
00:05:03.517 --> 00:05:10.768
if I remove all of these color stops,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I

72
00:05:10.768 --> 00:05:12.010
mean color enhance rather.

73
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.630
Those two look exactly the same, right?

74
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.350
And there I put them back in.

75
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.780
So it's basically saying,

76
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.210
before you would just have color stops and
then you had to mathematically figure out,

77
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.810
if you didn't want the midpoint to be
at the 50% mark between two colors.

78
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:36.903
Now you can basically say,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You

79
00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:39.770
can basically say where
between those two color stops?

80
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.560
One thing to note, though, is note that
I did not say 50% for all of these.

81
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.390
It's not the mark between the two
color points that you're,

82
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.830
it's not like which percentage
between those two color stops.

83
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.820
50% of the way, or 25% of the way,
it's from the zero mark.

84
00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.140
So every single one of
these color hints starts

85
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.200
from this point right here,
it starts at the zero mark.

86
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.103
So when I say 78 viewport heights or

87
00:06:09.103 --> 00:06:15.436
78% of viewport height, it is right there.
