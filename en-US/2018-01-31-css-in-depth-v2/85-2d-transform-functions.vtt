1
00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:05.622
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So we have some two
dimensional transform functions.

2
00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:07.194
We're gonna cover three
dimensional later on but

3
00:00:07.194 --> 00:00:08.922
we're gonna start off with
the two dimensional ones.

4
00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:13.550
So basically, flat surface, flat space.

5
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.769
So we can translate it and
we can do it one to two lengths.

6
00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:26.584
&gt;&gt; Estelle: If it's basically
along the x-axis and

7
00:00:26.584 --> 00:00:32.121
if you do provide the second value,
I'll cover it later on.

8
00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:35.065
So we can translate it, we can scale it,

9
00:00:35.065 --> 00:00:38.710
we can scale it just along the x or
just along the y.

10
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.495
We can translate it or we can
translate it just along the x-axis or

11
00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:42.569
just along the y-axis.

12
00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:47.170
We can rotate it, or we can rotate it
just along the x-axis, or just along

13
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.312
the y-axis, and we can skew it, either
along the x-axis, the y-axis or both.

14
00:00:52.312 --> 00:00:56.376
And then there's something called matrix,
and if you ever see matrix,

15
00:00:56.376 --> 00:01:01.770
99.999% of the time that means that it was
a machine that generated the transform.

16
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.492
There are some people that can read
matrices, I am not one of them.

17
00:01:07.146 --> 00:01:10.700
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay, so, let’s start
off with the translate function.

18
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.490
Here, we’re translating at 100 pixels from
the right and 100 pixels from the top.

19
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.541
Here, this is gonna be nice
when nothing works, yeah.

20
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.060
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay, here I put it totally
off the screen cuz i said 900 pixels

21
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.950
by accident, and meant to say 90,
let's bring it back, and there it is.

22
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.882
So here I translated it along the x-axis,
I moved it 90 pixels to the right,

23
00:01:36.882 --> 00:01:39.895
or I could've moved it
90 pixels to the left.

24
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:47.401
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Here, I can move it
90 pixels down or 90 pixels up or

25
00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:52.412
I can move it 100 pixels
in each direction or

26
00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:55.121
-100 and -100.

27
00:01:58.297 --> 00:02:01.924
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So to make these slides
work the way the slides work and

28
00:02:01.924 --> 00:02:08.065
by the way the URL for these slides is
estelle.github.ios/cssmastery/transforms.

29
00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:10.586
To make these work you
basically can edit these and

30
00:02:10.586 --> 00:02:13.479
then you just have to mouse off
of them and they will work.

31
00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:21.300
So if I do -190 and I mouse off of it,
it will go 190 pixels to the left.

32
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.180
So, that is the translate function,
you have transform translate,

33
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.665
transform translatex
an transform translatey.

34
00:02:29.665 --> 00:02:35.417
Then we have rotate, so
that is rotated 90 degrees,

35
00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:39.301
but we can rotate it 180 degrees.

36
00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:43.976
We can rotate it just along the x-axis,

37
00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:49.762
that flipped it upside down or
along the y-axis.

38
00:02:49.762 --> 00:02:51.983
Remember why I said I
was gonna use a plane,

39
00:02:51.983 --> 00:02:54.730
cuz you can tell that's it's backwards.

40
00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.808
So one was upside down, one was backwards,
or if I do rotate at 180 degrees,

41
00:03:00.808 --> 00:03:06.097
like this or actually at 90 degrees,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Rotate

42
00:03:06.097 --> 00:03:09.590
x at 90 degrees, you can't see it.

43
00:03:11.418 --> 00:03:17.160
&gt;&gt; Estelle: It's there but it can't be
seen, this book is really thick, right?

44
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.072
So if I start like this,
I'll show the cover,

45
00:03:22.072 --> 00:03:26.383
if I start like this, right,
this is not rotated at all.

46
00:03:26.383 --> 00:03:30.081
If I rotate it along the x-axis,
to 90 degrees,

47
00:03:30.081 --> 00:03:36.116
because it's really thick you can see
there's over a 1000 pages in this book.

48
00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:40.069
But an element like this it disappears
because it doesn't actually,

49
00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.360
it's only two dimensional
it's not three dimensional.

50
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.621
So if I do 91 degrees
you'll actually start

51
00:03:48.621 --> 00:03:53.612
seeing it again, 95, 120, right?

52
00:03:53.612 --> 00:03:55.742
So I flipped it, and
now you are seeing the back.

53
00:03:55.742 --> 00:03:59.436
Sometimes you don't want to see the back.

54
00:03:59.436 --> 00:04:01.805
We're gonna show you
how to get rid of it so

55
00:04:01.805 --> 00:04:04.389
you don't see the back
if it's upside down.

56
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.500
So that's rotatex,
which rotates it along the x-axis,

57
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.102
rotatey rotates it along the y-axis,
so let's just do 120 along the y-axis.

58
00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:20.341
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And let's just do 100, so

59
00:04:20.341 --> 00:04:25.750
here it is basically like this,
it's almost like that.

60
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.919
It's backward you see cuz
it's already gone beyond 90%.

61
00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.398
If I wanna do it in the other direction so
it's legible,

62
00:04:32.398 --> 00:04:36.700
I can do 80 degrees and
it's the same width, okay.

63
00:04:38.415 --> 00:04:42.845
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And here I have the scale, so
right now, I'm making it 25% of the width,

64
00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:47.159
which is the first value is the width,
and the second value is the height.

65
00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:52.571
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So,
here I'm making it only one value, so

66
00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:57.150
that's 75 percent of the width,
and 75 percent of the height.

67
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:03.471
Here, it's only the width, scale x is only
the width, and scale y is only the height.

68
00:05:03.471 --> 00:05:08.398
So when you only say scale y, it's gonna
be the same width as it was before,

69
00:05:08.398 --> 00:05:12.000
it's just gonna be a different height.

70
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.760
If you say scale x only,
it's gonna be the same height but

71
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.210
you're going to change the width.

72
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.080
If you scale with without
anything here just scale,

73
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.177
parentheses, no x, no y, and
you only use one value, its both.

74
00:05:29.177 --> 00:05:33.735
And then if use two values its
width that comes first and

75
00:05:33.735 --> 00:05:37.203
then the height so I could 95% here, or

76
00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:41.974
lets actually do 175% and
really skew it there we go.

77
00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:48.100
Its actually off the screen on
top I think a little bit, okay.

78
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.490
Does the scale makes sense to people?

79
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:56.050
Okay, now I've skewed it,
I've skewed it five degrees, or

80
00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.300
no not skewed five degrees, let's skewed
it 15 degrees cuz that's more noticeable.

81
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.193
Okay, so I skewed it along the x-axis, so

82
00:06:04.193 --> 00:06:09.709
when I skew it along the x-axis,
it means that the bottom and

83
00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:16.116
the top are still gonna be exactly
parallel to where they were before.

84
00:06:16.116 --> 00:06:20.079
But the sides are going
to be skewed either,

85
00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:24.290
oop,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay,

86
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.812
I want to put a negative in there.

87
00:06:28.906 --> 00:06:33.814
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I've never done

88
00:06:33.814 --> 00:06:38.010
negative 95 degrees,
I really don't know what that's doing.

89
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.061
Let's do something smaller so
we can see it.

90
00:06:39.061 --> 00:06:43.391
So here this right here
is a 45 degree angle,

91
00:06:43.391 --> 00:06:47.510
you see that, that's a 45 degree angle.

92
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.310
This right here, let's see if this works.

93
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:53.955
It's a 75 degree angle.

94
00:06:57.786 --> 00:07:02.240
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I guess,
I'm not 100% sure, is that 75 degrees?

95
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.800
Okay, so that's what skewing does,
and let's go back to 15 and

96
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.330
that's along the x.

97
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.272
When I start doing it along the y-axis,
the left and

98
00:07:13.272 --> 00:07:18.481
right are gonna be vertical, but
the top and bottom are gonna be off.

99
00:07:18.481 --> 00:07:22.650
And so you've probably seen this effect
a few times on like street signs and

100
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.582
stuff maybe about eight degrees.

101
00:07:28.003 --> 00:07:31.459
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Right, you've seen signs
like that, skews the whole thing,

102
00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:36.421
the letters themselves are skewed as well,
it takes the whole thing and skews it.

103
00:07:36.421 --> 00:07:41.940
You can skew both,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And you see now neither

104
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.751
the left, nothing is perpendicular and
nothing is horizontal, both are skewed.

105
00:07:46.751 --> 00:07:50.851
Or you can actually just
use a skew property, and

106
00:07:50.851 --> 00:07:56.958
the skew property is slightly different
than doing skewx versus skewy.

107
00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:00.818
Cuz first, in this one,
first it skews x and then it skews y, and

108
00:08:00.818 --> 00:08:03.476
this one it skews them
both at the same time.

109
00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:06.721
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So
you see that slight difference.

110
00:08:09.881 --> 00:08:12.934
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I'm just gonna do this and
change it here to five degrees and

111
00:08:12.934 --> 00:08:17.655
see if it's,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And

112
00:08:17.655 --> 00:08:22.717
then, 35, 35, and then 35, 35.

113
00:08:22.717 --> 00:08:25.370
I assume it's going to make
a bigger difference here, yeah.

114
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.570
That's a bigger difference,

115
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.470
I used to understand the difference
between the two of them.

116
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.080
What it really meant to skew it
one way and then the other way.

117
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.639
But basically here,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: It first skews,

118
00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:41.270
let's say 15% and 0, right?

119
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:47.650
So first it's skewing along the x-axis,
and then once it's skewed that way,

120
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:52.040
it takes that right there, and then skews
it again, so it's skewing it twice.

121
00:08:53.700 --> 00:09:00.211
And if I were to do this,
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I would go for

122
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:04.372
the screen and then lose my place, and
it would be slightly different again.
