00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:06.124
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay, so,
let's do 3D transforms.

2
00:00:06.124 --> 00:00:11.000
In this slide it's basically all of the
functions are highlighted that will put it

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.069
into a 3D space.

4
00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:16.220
So there's translate3d or translateZ.

5
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.278
So we had translateX,
translateY, and translateZ.

6
00:00:19.278 --> 00:00:23.400
Basically translate 3D is X, Y, and Z.

7
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.230
Scale 3D will scale it
in three dimensions.

8
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.178
Or you could just scale Z.

9
00:00:31.178 --> 00:00:36.780
Rotate 3D can take three
numbers in an angle.

10
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.460
I don't think I've ever used that.

11
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.700
I just basically use rotate.

12
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.980
RotateZ is just the angle.

13
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.906
Matrix 3D has 15 vales and
then there's also a prospective function.

14
00:00:52.906 --> 00:00:57.280
So the perspective function doesn't matter
unless you are rotating it into 3D space.

15
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.300
And perspective will basically allow you
to make it say where are you standing and,

16
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.380
if you're looking at the horizon, it looks
like the world is ending over there,

17
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.730
but it's actually my perspective.

18
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.179
And that building looks like it's
getting smaller, but it's not.

19
00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.337
For those watching this,
I can see out a window, which is weird.

20
00:01:19.337 --> 00:01:21.020
I usually can't when I'm programming.

21
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.110
Okay.

22
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.010
3D transforms lots of green.

23
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.710
So let's look at related properties.

24
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.939
We have perspective or perspective
both the perspective as a function of

25
00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.330
the transform element and then perspective
as a property in and of itself.

26
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.250
We have transform origin which is what
point are we starting the transform from.

27
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.890
We have transform style which is
whether we wanted to make it flat or

28
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.250
we wanna preserve the three dimensions.

29
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.947
Then we have perspective origin,

30
00:01:55.947 --> 00:02:00.290
which is position relative to the parent
where are we looking at it from.

31
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.660
And then back face visibility.

32
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.770
So we don't see that RSVP upside down.

33
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.155
As something is something's
back is towards us.
