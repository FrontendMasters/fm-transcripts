00:00:02.631 --> 00:00:08.429
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so here,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I basically said,

2
00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.174
I don't have any color hints but we could.

3
00:00:12.174 --> 00:00:15.260
We could say 20%.

4
00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:21.300
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And now the red
is circled we can add similarly

5
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.740
the color hints.

6
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.910
And it's a solid orange,
another color hint,

7
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.622
of yellow,
another color hint of green, and

8
00:00:33.622 --> 00:00:42.141
another color hint,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Of blue.

9
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:46.768
Now, the purple isn't showing up,

10
00:00:46.768 --> 00:00:55.351
I would have to do 99,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And 99.9.

11
00:01:01.723 --> 00:01:02.752
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's teasing me.

12
00:01:08.752 --> 00:01:10.262
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Is that purple?

13
00:01:14.093 --> 00:01:14.677
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Here it is, okay.

14
00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:21.077
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So for some reason, when
I was doing 99.9, it was like, yeah, no,

15
00:01:21.077 --> 00:01:21.926
you can't do that.

16
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.147
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I don't know where it
will allow me to do that, but, seven,

17
00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:31.240
six, six.

18
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.510
Okay, that's purple.

19
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.490
So I don't know why it's not
allowing me to do the 100.

20
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.580
That's probably a bug
that I should submit.

21
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.360
But you can use the exact
same color stock syntax, and

22
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.560
the exact same color hint syntax.

23
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.200
As you did with radial gradients.

24
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.240
But to finish up with gradients,
let's go over repeating radial gradients.

25
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.280
Repeating radial gradients are basically
similar to repeating linear gradients.

26
00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.450
You have to mark what the 100% mark is,
and it will repeat from there on out.

27
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.630
You wanna use all of the other
features as you did before.

28
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.736
So in this example here,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I'm

29
00:02:11.736 --> 00:02:14.290
saying closest-side at 100 pixels.

30
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.700
So from this center of the circle to
this outer side, it's 100 pixels.

31
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.220
So I said 100% here is the purple mark,
but

32
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.229
the purple mark is at this spot
right here, the closest side, and

33
00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:34.339
therefore, this radius is 100 pixels.

34
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.040
And so
our repeating is at every 100 pixels.

35
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.490
So it goes 100 pixels out, and then you
have the next circle has a diameter,

36
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.960
the first circle has a diameter of 200,
the next one of 400, 600,

37
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.230
800, and so it's very similar.

38
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.919
If I had put actually at 200 pixels, there
would be a big difference if I put a 300.

39
00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:00.290
It would be a big difference
if it was 400, right?

40
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.850
Because it's basically going,
the radius, and

41
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.400
determine the radius the closest side,
and the closest side is now the top.
