00:00:02.318 --> 00:00:04.595
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's move along and
talk about alignment.

2
00:00:04.595 --> 00:00:09.149
This is gonna be very similar to what we
talked about with flex-box yesterday.

3
00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:14.040
We have several properties that are on
the parent, including justify items,

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.413
align items, justify content,
align content, grid auto columns,

5
00:00:18.413 --> 00:00:21.022
grid auto rows, grid auto flow and grid.

6
00:00:21.022 --> 00:00:25.184
And then we have justify-self and
align-self,

7
00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:29.554
which are properties on
the grid items themselves.

8
00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:34.287
So justify-items has a few new

9
00:00:34.287 --> 00:00:39.024
values that we never heard of.

10
00:00:39.024 --> 00:00:43.536
One of them is legacy and
then two or safe and unsafe, and

11
00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:46.128
I'll go over those in a minute.

12
00:00:46.128 --> 00:00:49.027
The default is actually legacy,
which is left.

13
00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:54.576
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Justify,
that's what it comes out to, so

14
00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:59.519
I don't think that's actually what it
means, but that's what it ends up being.

15
00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.105
I guess it would be right
in left-to-right languages.

16
00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:08.661
So justify-items,
it aligns items in the inline

17
00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:13.301
direction, which for us is horizontal.

18
00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:15.046
Let's just go and do it by example.

19
00:01:24.502 --> 00:01:29.791
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: When

20
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:33.261
we were doing flex-box,
we sometimes aligned the whole row and

21
00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:35.265
we sometimes aligned just the item.

22
00:01:35.265 --> 00:01:40.218
So when it says, justify-items,
it's actually taking

23
00:01:40.218 --> 00:01:45.181
that grid item and
aligning just each item individually.

24
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:47.817
It's doing it globally to all of them but

25
00:01:47.817 --> 00:01:51.704
it's individual within each item,
putting it at the end.

26
00:01:51.704 --> 00:01:56.388
Here were can put it at the start.

27
00:01:56.388 --> 00:01:58.528
What are the other values we have?

28
00:01:58.528 --> 00:02:01.652
We have stretch, and we have center,
and we have self end.

29
00:02:01.652 --> 00:02:02.976
So let's do center.

30
00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:10.645
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Now the thing is, this
stuff is really ugly and I've never used

31
00:02:10.645 --> 00:02:16.448
this property because I've never needed to
do this cuz I don't find it attractive.

32
00:02:16.448 --> 00:02:18.878
But it is important to
understand that it's doable.

33
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:26.738
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So the new values or safe
which means if it overflows the container

34
00:02:26.738 --> 00:02:31.948
if it tends to over align the container
then you actually still show

35
00:02:31.948 --> 00:02:36.990
the content and unsafe is basically
says you're gonna crop it.

36
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.377
So legacy is basically you can
inherit legacy left center or

37
00:02:42.377 --> 00:02:44.971
right and that's about it.

38
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:50.018
Then we have a column alignment
which we do with align-items.

39
00:02:50.018 --> 00:02:57.008
We did justify items, which was kind of
left to right in left to right languages.

40
00:02:57.008 --> 00:03:02.559
Here if we do flex
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Start, which

41
00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:07.249
you'll notice that the flex property is
the same thing as it was in flex, right?

42
00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.525
We can do flex-end.

43
00:03:09.525 --> 00:03:16.339
So it's aligning each item
within its grid line,

44
00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:20.566
right, along the road track.

45
00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:23.893
The previous one did
along the column track.

46
00:03:27.682 --> 00:03:32.043
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Stretch
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Is nice.

47
00:03:32.043 --> 00:03:33.887
I think that's the default.

48
00:03:33.887 --> 00:03:38.669
I forgot to highlight which one is
the default but I'm pretty sure it's that.

49
00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:46.133
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There's
a property called place-items,

50
00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:50.813
which is basically align-items,
and then justify-items.

51
00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:53.010
It's just a shorthand.

52
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.475
Realize that the order does matter.

53
00:03:54.475 --> 00:03:59.527
You have to put align-items first,
and then justify-items.

54
00:03:59.527 --> 00:04:03.951
If you only put one property there,
if you just include the line items,

55
00:04:03.951 --> 00:04:07.661
it'll be that value will be
given to justify items as well.

56
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:12.176
So let's play with making this
hideous just for a minute.

57
00:04:12.176 --> 00:04:13.993
So we have align-items,

58
00:04:20.805 --> 00:04:23.512
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Which is aligning items,

59
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.786
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Within its column, right?

60
00:04:28.786 --> 00:04:35.779
That's what justify-items does left or
right or center.

61
00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:43.145
Horizontally, and
then line items is vertical.

62
00:04:43.145 --> 00:04:48.098
So here we put it at the top,
here we put it at the end.

63
00:04:48.098 --> 00:04:52.022
Here we stretch it.

64
00:04:52.022 --> 00:04:58.347
But notice, even though it's stretch in
the height It's still at the flex-end.

65
00:04:58.347 --> 00:05:03.880
And we can center,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And center.

66
00:05:06.385 --> 00:05:10.376
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Now, you might
wanna actually create this effect,

67
00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:12.107
I don't think you do.

68
00:05:12.107 --> 00:05:18.783
I don't use these but, it's important
to know that they exist, right?

69
00:05:18.783 --> 00:05:20.311
When would you use this?

70
00:05:20.311 --> 00:05:25.148
So remember that example
with the unicorns?

71
00:05:25.148 --> 00:05:28.141
And it was a unicorn, and
then a paragraph, and there was space,

72
00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:30.059
and then there was a button at the bottom?

73
00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:34.611
You would just put
the button at the flex end.

74
00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:39.205
But the way we did it before,
when we did it with the flex items,

75
00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:43.973
we put the image, and then we put
the button in the third item, and

76
00:05:43.973 --> 00:05:46.835
then we allowed the middle one to grow,

77
00:05:46.835 --> 00:05:51.134
and we didn't allow the first one or
the third one to grow.

78
00:05:52.677 --> 00:05:55.230
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay.

79
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.875
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Quick question.

80
00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:57.870
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If we're using legacy,

81
00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.141
how do we declare that it can hire it?

82
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:02.987
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You
don't even have to use.

83
00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:04.587
You can just omit it, it's legacy.

84
00:06:04.587 --> 00:06:07.502
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah.

85
00:06:07.502 --> 00:06:10.219
Basically you just have to overwrite
legacy, if you want something else.

86
00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:11.041
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: All right.

87
00:06:11.041 --> 00:06:12.317
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That's a default value.
