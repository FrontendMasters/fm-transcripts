00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:06.380
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's go on to the next,
which is Generated Content.

2
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.060
The URL for this is
estelle.gethub.iu/cssmastery/generated for

3
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.180
generated content.

4
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.843
So, let's revisit that generated content,

5
00:00:15.843 --> 00:00:20.130
we already saw this slide,
where it says before and after.

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.085
So it's basically like putting
that pseudo-element before and

7
00:00:25.085 --> 00:00:27.440
that pseudo-element after.

8
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.550
And right here is where
you could style them.

9
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.540
So you could do anything you wanted to,
realizing that right now it is part

10
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.630
of the text of the paragraph.

11
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.580
It says, if it was in the paragraph
you can't select it and

12
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.910
it's not part of the dom, but
if you style the paragraph the before and

13
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.330
after one will inherit all of it.

14
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.500
If you want to do things
like transform it,

15
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.340
let's see what we can do with transform.

16
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.507
Let's go on to the next one and

17
00:00:59.507 --> 00:01:03.187
let's do Dogs are cuter.

18
00:01:03.187 --> 00:01:06.093
Now you know where I stand.

19
00:01:06.093 --> 00:01:11.622
Let's try transform.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Rotate,

20
00:01:11.622 --> 00:01:16.634
45 degrees, so you saw that

21
00:01:16.634 --> 00:01:23.353
it did not rotate.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If I did

22
00:01:23.353 --> 00:01:29.028
position absolute, then it would rotate.

23
00:01:29.028 --> 00:01:30.874
We're gonna learn about that later on.

24
00:01:30.874 --> 00:01:39.496
But basically, you can't rotate
something that's statically positioned.

25
00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:42.723
In line element that's
statically positioned.

26
00:01:42.723 --> 00:01:45.200
Okay, so pseudo elements.

27
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.700
What most people think is when it says
before that it comes before the p and

28
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.510
when it says after it comes after the p or
whatever element it's in.

29
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.610
It's actually the p would be that
red thing in the background.

30
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.270
And that content would include
the before the content and

31
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.050
the after all together in the foreground.

32
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.690
It's as if it was all together.

33
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.200
But there's basically a faux
span around the beginning and

34
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.070
the end that you can style.

35
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.710
The only part, the only attribute that
is required is the content attribute.

36
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.780
You can have a value of an empty string,
and

37
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.030
that means it will create
content that you can then style,

38
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.970
even though it's empty, but
it is there, and you can style it.

39
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.560
There's also the word none, so if you have
content and you don't want it to show up,

40
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.910
right, you don't wanna have content,
you just put none.

41
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.968
Because putting the empty quotes
means it's still styleable.

42
00:02:43.968 --> 00:02:48.782
So the values you can put in there
are none, normal, a string, an image,

43
00:02:48.782 --> 00:02:54.007
a counter, open and closed quotes,
no open/no closed quotes and attribute.
