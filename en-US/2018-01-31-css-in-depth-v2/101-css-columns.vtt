00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.740
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So the best feature of being a
web developer is to marry a chiropractor.

2
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.120
I married a chiropractor it's wonderful.

3
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.255
So if you're gonna be all day at
a computer, totally marry a chiropractor.

4
00:00:13.255 --> 00:00:16.765
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle: If you're already married

5
00:00:16.765 --> 00:00:18.342
switch spouses.

6
00:00:18.342 --> 00:00:20.460
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I don't know okay but

7
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.140
there are a lot of other awesome
features of CSS so let's cover them.

8
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.360
We already covered columns but
I just wanted to cover it again a bit.

9
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.770
Because there are some features that
we didn't really focus on which is

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.810
why no one ever uses them.

11
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.954
So one of the things that
columns does is right

12
00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:41.250
now there's margin on
top of this paragraph.

13
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.480
So here's the top of a paragraph and

14
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.090
here on the other side is a paragraph
as well, and this doesn't look good.

15
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.270
So if you're going to use columns, you
actually wanna get rid of the top margin,

16
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.180
most likely, so
that you can use it cuz this is ugly.

17
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.090
Then we talked about column-count, and

18
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.820
here we have three columns,
and then here we have six.

19
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.630
Or five, rather, when I said six.

20
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.818
But here, we only have two columns,
even though I declared six.

21
00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:13.000
Because the column-count is
the max number of columns.

22
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.193
And the column-width is
the minimum width for each column.

23
00:01:18.193 --> 00:01:21.404
And then we have column-rule and
column-gap.

24
00:01:21.404 --> 00:01:27.265
The column-gap is how much room
between the two columns, total.

25
00:01:27.265 --> 00:01:32.870
So the properties are column-count and
column-width.

26
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.610
And we have a shorthand, which is columns,
which declares the width and

27
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.350
then the column-count.

28
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.280
And count is misspelled up here so
just ignore that.

29
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.790
Then we have column-fill which takes
two options either auto or balance.

30
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.200
Which means if you have an element
that is really, really tall and

31
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.900
you have just a little bit of text,
you can say, fill up the first column.

32
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.480
And maybe don't fill up the second
column at all, or maybe balance them so

33
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.750
that both of them are the same height.

34
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.680
Then you have column-gap which can just be
default as normal, which I believe is 1em,

35
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.180
or a length.

36
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.481
Then you can have column-span, you can
have an element go across many columns.

37
00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:20.740
Or rather all your columns, or
just stay in its one column.

38
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.200
Then you have column-rule
which is kinda like a border.

39
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.127
It takes a rule-color,
rule-style, and rule-width and

40
00:02:28.127 --> 00:02:30.770
there's a shorthand of column-rule.

41
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.960
Just realize, if you transition or
you animate it,

42
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.230
it will have two events when you do
the shorthand instead of just one.

43
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.013
And then there are other features
that are not column specific.

44
00:02:44.013 --> 00:02:49.540
Such as break-after, break-before,
break-inside, orphans, and widows.

45
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.661
Orphans and windows are basically how
many lines at the end you want to keep

46
00:02:53.661 --> 00:02:55.400
together before it can break.

47
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.149
And so these are really page properties,
not just column properties.

48
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.450
So let's take a look at that column-span
which we did not cover earlier.

49
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.490
First of all, I'd like to say that
here we're saying columns should be

50
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.060
a min-width of 8ems and
a max number of three columns.

51
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.120
We could have five columns and
that would fit.

52
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.190
We can have a maximum five at that width,
but we could go down to 4ems and

53
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.670
basically have as many columns.

54
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.200
You don't want this look,
but it is possible.

55
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.300
But notice that the first
paragraph has that margin-top.

56
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.281
So we should change that p to give

57
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:41.836
it {margin: 0 0 20px }.

58
00:03:41.836 --> 00:03:45.430
So now its margins on the bottom and
look how much better that looks.

59
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.650
So you still have a margin
on your paragraph but

60
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.430
it's on the bottom not both
on the bottom and top.

61
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.420
Then we have another thing which is
right here, h1 { column-span: all; }.

62
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.620
And so you'll notice that this
title goes all the way across, but

63
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.930
that second title right here,
which is an h2, stays in line.

64
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.930
That doesn't look good.

65
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.885
First of all,
let's make this actually go back to 8ems,

66
00:04:10.885 --> 00:04:14.286
cuz that looks so
much [NOISE], let's do 12ems.

67
00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:15.579
Okay, that looks better, right?

68
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.938
But you have this showing up right here.

69
00:04:18.938 --> 00:04:23.169
And this really should span
all of the columns, so

70
00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.920
you just do h2 {column-span: all;}.

71
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.094
And the text that came
after that h2 is down here.

72
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.750
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So { column-span: all } is

73
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.251
something that I wanted to show you.
