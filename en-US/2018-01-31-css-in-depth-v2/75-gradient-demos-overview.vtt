00:00:02.213 --> 00:00:05.390
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Now we're gonna
go on to CSS Gradients.

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.240
So here are some examples
of some gradients,

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.400
some of them are based on
my old house wallpaper.

4
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.120
But just to show that
they're gradients and

5
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.860
that they're live, we're going to
hideously change the background color.

6
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.800
And so
you see that this is actually a gradient,

7
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.090
cuz I was able to change the background
color, and it went through.

8
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.921
This is one I called Metal Grid.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: And

9
00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:35.994
&gt;&gt; Estelle: There we go.

10
00:00:41.128 --> 00:00:43.685
&gt;&gt; Estelle: This one actually as ugly as

11
00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:50.960
it is, if you chose the right color,
it actually kind of looks nice.

12
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.810
So this wouldn't be the most
hideous of background images if you

13
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.020
wanted to create a gradient and
have the page repeated.

14
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.464
This one I call disco ball,
cuz there's like a radio gradient in

15
00:01:03.464 --> 00:01:08.150
the background and then there's like
these hideous balls in the front.

16
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.860
I'm just moving the slider to
show that these are live and

17
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.670
it's not some image I put back there.

18
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.090
This one I call the star of David,

19
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.400
I guess the most appropriate would
be to make it white and blue.

20
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.340
And then this one is retro 1967,
cuz why not?

21
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.590
And this one reminds me of seat cousins,
if you've ever had a seat cushion with

22
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.760
a little pin in the middle, but you can
pick a seat cushion in any color you want.

23
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.080
There you go, let's blind ourselves.

24
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.250
And this one is actually based on
wallpaper that was in my house,

25
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:55.640
except for, the color of my
wallpaper was more, yeah, that's it.

26
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.938
That's nice, and when you would be in the
house for a really long period of time,

27
00:02:00.938 --> 00:02:05.473
it would feel like you was doing this.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Yeah, so

28
00:02:05.473 --> 00:02:09.528
these are all done with gradients,
and then background size,

29
00:02:09.528 --> 00:02:13.213
which we've learned background size,
right?

30
00:02:13.213 --> 00:02:17.156
So a gradient is actually an image, and

31
00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:22.424
it can be used anywhere where
you use an image in CSS.

32
00:02:22.424 --> 00:02:26.802
So it can be used in generated content, it
could be used as a background image, and

33
00:02:26.802 --> 00:02:29.160
it could be used as a list
item image as well.

34
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.510
So it's actually not
just background images,

35
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.840
but 99.999% of the time
that's what you do.

36
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.800
Generally there are considered
to be four types of gradients,

37
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.250
there's linear, repeating linear,
radial, and repeating radial gradient.

38
00:02:45.514 --> 00:02:47.710
I guess you can actually
put it as a cursor,

39
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.678
you could put a gradient as a cursor,
I forgot that there's an image cursor.

40
00:02:56.473 --> 00:02:58.681
&gt;&gt; Estelle: If you want to see this one,

41
00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:03.400
you have to go into Chrome,
Canary, which I will do here.

42
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.915
And here we have conical gradients.
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So coming soon,

43
00:03:16.915 --> 00:03:22.932
because it is actually from Canary which
is the build, or the beta version,

44
00:03:22.932 --> 00:03:28.570
with just a few lines of CSS I was
able to create this conical gradient.

45
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.280
We are not gonna cover conical gradient,

46
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.990
because it's gonna be a while
before the fully covered.

47
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.618
But just realize that this is something
that is coming and it'll be doable, and

48
00:03:36.618 --> 00:03:38.904
it makes it really easy to
do something like that.

49
00:03:44.404 --> 00:03:47.407
&gt;&gt; Estelle: CSS gradients, i's all green,

50
00:03:47.407 --> 00:03:50.310
Opera Mini will forever be red.

51
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.428
And it's not that Opera Mini
is a bad browser,

52
00:03:52.428 --> 00:03:55.170
Opera Mini is actually
a very good browser.

53
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.270
It's very good if you have very limited
bandwidth, or you're paying a lot for

54
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.760
your bandwidth, because what it does
is it basically on Opera's servers,

55
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.450
they create the page for you, and then
they send you just a few HTTP requests,

56
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.030
they send you the produced pages.

57
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.060
So it strips out a lot of stuff, and
provides you with content that's linkable.

58
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.810
But a lot of the features, aren't
supported, because someone who is paying

59
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.065
money to surf the web does not want
to be paying for extra junk, okay.

60
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.870
And it's also on older devices,
and more modern devices,

61
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.730
but It's basically a money saver.
