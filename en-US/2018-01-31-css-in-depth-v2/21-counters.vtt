00:00:02.273 --> 00:00:05.543
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So we've already
seen examples of the counter, and

2
00:00:05.543 --> 00:00:08.740
we've seen examples of the attribute.

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.650
We've also seen examples of strings, and

4
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.040
we did see examples of empty string,
which is still a string.

5
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.020
So the way the counter works is,
you give a counter a name.

6
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.200
So in this name I called it sections.

7
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.740
So every time it hits a section,
it's gonna recount.

8
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.460
So let's say you want to count, you're
writing a legal document and you can

9
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.880
either use ordered list and nested ordered
list or, if you wanna use headers and

10
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.392
paragraphs, you can actually count
how many headers you have like every

11
00:00:52.392 --> 00:00:58.320
time you hit an h5, right,
you reset the counter for h6.

12
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.140
Every time you hit a counter for h, you
hit at h4, you reset the counter for h5.

13
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.940
Every time you hit a counter, an h1,
you reset the counter for h2.

14
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.860
Because if you were writing a book,
you would want, right, the main header,

15
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.070
you would wanna restart every time
you hit another major header.

16
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.570
Does that make sense to people?

17
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.650
So that is where you would put your reset.

18
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.960
So here in this document, every time I hit
a section I reset the counter to zero.

19
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.026
Then if I add a header,
before any h1 that is called

20
00:01:37.026 --> 00:01:42.640
the section title, I would say part, and
whatever part of that section it is.

21
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.023
So every time I have, like if I'm writing
a play, and it's done in sections,

22
00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:48.920
like there would be act one and
act two, which might be an article.

23
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.494
And then within each article
there would be sections.

24
00:01:51.494 --> 00:01:54.780
And every time I hit a section
I restart counting at zero.

25
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.970
And then my first h1 is the first header.

26
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.611
And the second h1,a, yeah the second h1
where there's a section title would be

27
00:02:03.611 --> 00:02:05.580
number two and number three.

28
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.390
And that way, I wouldn't have
to have to put everything in

29
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.270
an ordered list to count it.

30
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.580
And then you have to
increment the counter.

31
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.359
So if you just said counter sections, it
would always be one, one, one, one, one.

32
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:28.795
You increment it every time you hit.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So it says sections.

33
00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:32.760
That's the name of the counter.

34
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.030
So it's incrementing
the counter called sections.

35
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.700
You can have any name number, and
I didn't look up the rules for naming but

36
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.950
generally I assume it's
definitely an ident.

37
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.380
The difference between an ident and
a string, is a string has quotes and

38
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.770
ident does not.

39
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.291
Generally an ident cannot start
with digits or two underscores.

40
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:55.414
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If

41
00:02:55.414 --> 00:02:58.304
you switch those two lines over there.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah.

42
00:02:58.304 --> 00:02:59.351
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Will the counter increment

43
00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:01.900
start before the content,
would it start with part two rather than

44
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.816
part one?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: No.

45
00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:03.410
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

46
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.085
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: All right,

47
00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:07.799
because it's actually on the header,
it would do all of that so,

48
00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.970
it increments every time it hits one.

49
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.340
It would, we saw with the generated
content, the before and after, remember

50
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.520
when we did the, we had the number of
errors and we put it before, and then we

51
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.840
put it after in the LI before it actually
hit the element where it incremented.

52
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.978
It incremented on every error.

53
00:03:27.978 --> 00:03:31.416
So when it was in the before statement,
before the error, it was at one.

54
00:03:31.416 --> 00:03:34.710
When it was after the input,
which was after the error, it was at two.

55
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.330
Okay, then we have attribute.

56
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.760
And so any, as we said earlier,
HTML can have any number of attributes.

57
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.650
And when you do attribute with
the attribute name, on an element,

58
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.450
it 'll print the value.

59
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.750
It will print the value as a string.

60
00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.520
It will not interpolate
the value of that string, right?

61
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:09.620
So, if I put in an image,
it will just give me the URL of the image.

62
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.580
It will not actually put an image.

63
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.270
We don't have this yet.

64
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.550
But we will at some point
hopefully have attribute, and

65
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.910
then you can put the attribute name.

66
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.370
And then a unit, and
you can actually do multiplication.

67
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.830
And then you could have a fallback,
so say it doesn't have an act,

68
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.320
that attribute doesn't exist,
you could actually put a back up.

69
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.860
So like If we did data count five, right?

70
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.980
I could do five pixels.

71
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.680
So here I could use it not just on
generated content but on something else.

72
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.410
Like width, attribute data count,
and then PX.

73
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.607
So you could actually,
this is not yet supported, but

74
00:04:52.607 --> 00:04:55.050
in the future hopefully this 'll exist.

75
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.578
And the units can be length or angles or

76
00:04:59.578 --> 00:05:06.168
whatever.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

77
00:05:06.168 --> 00:05:09.340
these are, I guess the fallbacks I'm not
sure what, I forget what I put there.

78
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.721
So here I have,
this is what the future holds,

79
00:05:14.721 --> 00:05:17.541
paragraph with a data count of five.

80
00:05:17.541 --> 00:05:21.510
And then I could say at the width
of that paragraph should be

81
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.398
it's attribute of data count,
five ms, right, ms.

82
00:05:25.398 --> 00:05:28.886
So it 'ld five ms, and if the data,
if this did not exist,

83
00:05:28.886 --> 00:05:33.110
this attribute did not exist,
there 'ld just have the width of auto.

84
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.121
That is not yet here,
that is in the future.
