00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.028
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Then we have @supports.

2
00:00:13.376 --> 00:00:16.995
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so whenever I have
CodePen it kinda messes with everything.

3
00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:21.383
So I'm just gonna stay on this slide and
then I'll move over to the next slide.

4
00:00:21.383 --> 00:00:27.674
So @supports, it basically says,
does this browser support display: flex?

5
00:00:27.674 --> 00:00:31.445
If yes, then we can use these features.

6
00:00:31.445 --> 00:00:35.981
And so a while ago, I was actually
talking about the @supports and

7
00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:39.875
how you could basically say,
does it support ligature?

8
00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:45.733
And if it supports ligature,
then use this font, right?

9
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:50.237
Don't use material icons
unless it supports ligature.

10
00:00:53.402 --> 00:00:57.178
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Before we used to
have this, which was @media screen and

11
00:00:57.178 --> 00:01:00.335
(transform-3d), or and (animation).

12
00:01:00.335 --> 00:01:03.060
That is the old way of doing it,
so don't use that anymore.

13
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.943
You might see it, so I'm printing it
out just in case you come across it.

14
00:01:05.943 --> 00:01:09.007
It used to be valid and
it still is, it still works.

15
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:14.019
But it only works for transform-3d and
animation, so what's the point.

16
00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:19.941
Whereas this works for, basically,
you put a property and a value.

17
00:01:19.941 --> 00:01:23.470
And it's not gonna render that,
it just says, can I support it?

18
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.666
So if you've heard of Modernizr,
who here has heard of Modernizr?

19
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:27.684
Pretty much everyone.

20
00:01:27.684 --> 00:01:32.189
It's basically Modernizr in the browser
without pulling in any JavaScript

21
00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:32.971
framework.

22
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:37.424
So a lot of people used to do JS and
then they used to basically decide which

23
00:01:37.424 --> 00:01:41.524
CSS features to use, based on what
Modernizr said was supported.

24
00:01:41.524 --> 00:01:44.705
You don't need to use Modernizr at all for
your CSS.

25
00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:47.346
You just say, hey do you support this?

26
00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:54.532
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Media screen.

27
00:01:54.532 --> 00:01:59.697
So here,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It says @media screen and

28
00:01:59.697 --> 00:02:02.100
(-webkit-transition).

29
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.556
So that was probably one
of the words that used.

30
00:02:04.556 --> 00:02:07.096
We have to open up this in a window,
right?

31
00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:12.218
Visit Site, here we go.

32
00:02:12.218 --> 00:02:13.356
I think it won't load.

33
00:02:13.356 --> 00:02:16.300
Okay, this browser supports @media and
@supports.

34
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.816
So what I did here is I said,
this browser supports @media or @supports.

35
00:02:22.816 --> 00:02:24.455
And, which ones does it support?

36
00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:27.754
And then I did a class of transitions,
a class of animations,

37
00:02:27.754 --> 00:02:30.810
a class of transforms, and
a class of supports, right?

38
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.570
And then here I did webkit-screen and
webkit-transition.

39
00:02:38.245 --> 00:02:42.340
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Save transitions, yes,
and it doesn't support that one anymore.

40
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.421
So it used to, but it doesn't anymore.

41
00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:48.154
And then moz-transition,
obviously this is not a Mozilla browser,

42
00:02:48.154 --> 00:02:49.997
it's not gonna support that one.

43
00:02:49.997 --> 00:02:53.618
ms-transition, it's not gonna support
that one, o-transition, not that one.

44
00:02:53.618 --> 00:02:57.952
Then it says, does it support transition?

45
00:02:57.952 --> 00:03:00.866
Well, that is an old way of writing it,
it doesn't support that anymore.

46
00:03:00.866 --> 00:03:05.637
But all the way down here
are the ones where it does support it

47
00:03:05.637 --> 00:03:09.754
which is @supports (display: table-cell).

48
00:03:09.754 --> 00:03:12.638
Which is what we really want to happen,
right?

49
00:03:12.638 --> 00:03:17.768
So I'm in Chrome right now and
let's name an advanced feature.

50
00:03:19.114 --> 00:03:21.018
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Anyone?

51
00:03:21.018 --> 00:03:22.851
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Grid?

52
00:03:22.851 --> 00:03:24.488
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So (display: grid).

53
00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:30.301
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You saw
that bottom one disappeared?

54
00:03:30.301 --> 00:03:35.714
If I type in grid, it popped up, okay?

55
00:03:35.714 --> 00:03:40.234
So we know it supports the property value,
and it happens to support grid as well.

56
00:03:42.093 --> 00:03:47.233
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You

57
00:03:47.233 --> 00:03:50.974
can put any property and
value, prefixed or not.

58
00:03:50.974 --> 00:03:54.014
And it's a way to basically
do browser detection,

59
00:03:54.014 --> 00:03:58.482
cuz I could just basically do browser
detection by doing moz-animation.

60
00:03:58.482 --> 00:04:00.519
Doesn't support moz-animation.

61
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:09.671
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And just give it a name,
moz-animation-name and

62
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:12.211
then colon red, right?

63
00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:13.318
Does it support that?

64
00:04:13.318 --> 00:04:17.405
Then I know I have the Mozilla browser,
just because I prefixed it with moz.

65
00:04:17.405 --> 00:04:24.308
So that's a hack, but
it is a way of doing user agent detection.
