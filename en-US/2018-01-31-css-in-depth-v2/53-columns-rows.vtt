00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.290
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So columns and
rows, there's two properties, right?

2
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.020
What you saw so

3
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.850
far was grid-template-columns,
we also have grid-template-rows.

4
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.700
Which is how tall each row is, it will be
as tall as it needs to be, or as tall,

5
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.000
basically it'll default to
whatever height it would have had.

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.180
Unless you tell it specifically
how tall to make it.

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.670
So according to the spec,

8
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.683
you can say none, give it a track-list or
an auto-track-list.

9
00:00:34.683 --> 00:00:42.280
And a track-list is what we did here,
and we said repeat 4, and then 1.

10
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.370
But I could actually take number 10 and
put it in the fifth row and fifth column.

11
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.380
And then the grid will grow to actually
encompass that placement, we're going to

12
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.890
talk about placement in a bit.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so

13
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.380
here are different ways to
declare template columns.

14
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.110
The first one says, I want to have
3 columns, each of them 150 pixels.

15
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.510
I could have written that exact same thing
by saying, repeat 3 times, 150 pixels.

16
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.820
The next one, I keep 2 of those 150
pixels, but I decided to make the first

17
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.800
one 275 pixels, so I said,
275 repeat twice 150 pixels.

18
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.610
And then in the fourth example, that's
the only one where I have 4 columns,

19
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.480
it says, make the first column 100 pixels.

20
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.010
Make the next 2 1fr, and
then the fourth column, make it 2fr.

21
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.930
So let's copy this and go back,

22
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.810
and just put it right here.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Oops,

23
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.510
forgot the property.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So there,

24
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.100
the first row 1, 5, and 9 are 100 pixels,

25
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.500
the next two are 1fr, and
the last column is 2fr.

26
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.860
So you'll notice that number 4, 8, and 12
are twice as wide as 2, 3, 6, 7, and 10,

27
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.940
and 11, can you see that?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Now,

28
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.970
let me just kind of do the same thing, and

29
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.994
hit it with rows.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And.

30
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.790
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So the first one is 50

31
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.830
pixels tall,
the second one is 1 unit of free space,

32
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.550
and the last one is 2 units of free space.

33
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.920
So that is why 12 is twice as wide as 8,

34
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.074
does that make sense?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,

35
00:02:52.074 --> 00:02:56.570
so grid-template-rows, in this case,
the first one, I said, 150, 150, 150,

36
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.490
that would have made 3
that are 150 feet tall.

37
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.710
The second one says 3 times 150,

38
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.760
same thing as the first line.

39
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.110
The third one is saying 275 pixels and
then repeat,

40
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.370
let's show how this one works.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

41
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.650
there's no reason-
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: To not mix units.

42
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.170
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so

43
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.648
here column 1 is 275 pixels tall,
and column 2 and 3 are both

44
00:03:41.648 --> 00:03:45.790
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 150 pixels tall, but

45
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.510
then we have

46
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.670
a column number 4.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

47
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.510
that is where auto columns comes in.

48
00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.810
You basically declare what
you want to declare and

49
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.719
then you can use one thing
to say everything else.

50
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.220
Or no matter how many rows I have, and

51
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.990
we're going to cover that in a second.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so

52
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.890
these are grid-template columns,
grid-template-rows.

53
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.380
The other thing you can do is
you can name the grid lines.

54
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.410
So if you want to name a grid line,
you just put these brackets here,

55
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.040
and I'm going to show you later
on why that's kind of useful.

56
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.720
But you just put brackets that says
grid line 1, it's called start.

57
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.230
Grid line 2, which happens right here,
it has no name.

58
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.280
Grid line 3, which happens right here,
has no name.

59
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.840
And at the end of our third column,
there is a fourth grid line,

60
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.720
which has the name of end.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Sometimes it's

61
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.830
easier to not remember how many grid lines
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: you have.

62
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.440
Especially if you have something
really complicated, and when you say,

63
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.630
where do I want to put this?

64
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.640
I want to put it from start
all the way to end, or

65
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.240
I want it to put from
start to the third column.

66
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.920
And I want to put this one from
the fifth column to the end.

67
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.940
So remember how we made that grid really,
that pink thing that kept moving?

68
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.910
We could have just said, put it to the end
instead of actually saying column 8,

69
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.360
if we didn't know we had 8 columns.
