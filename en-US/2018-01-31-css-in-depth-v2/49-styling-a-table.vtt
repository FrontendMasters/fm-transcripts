00:00:02.607 --> 00:00:05.590
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
let's talk a little bit about columns.

2
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.130
So we had that element called col and
what can you do with it?

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.840
Turns out not much, but
you can style a little bit.

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.974
So here we have column group and
I have four columns for

5
00:00:20.974 --> 00:00:26.290
my, I have the week,
the name of the player.

6
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.810
The name of the club that she
belongs to and the stat for

7
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.724
the week that she was the best player.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

8
00:00:33.724 --> 00:00:38.120
we can add styles here and
feel free to play along.

9
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.260
I can write background-color | pink.

10
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:49.948
And then, stat background color,

11
00:00:49.948 --> 00:00:54.300
pale goldenrod.

12
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.760
Cuz if you're gonna make something ugly,
the make it really ugly.

13
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.600
There's actually not much styling
that you can do with col.

14
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.195
Like here, if I say font-size,

15
00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:11.670
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 2ems, nothing happened.

16
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.020
There's very limited styling.

17
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.430
And what you'll note is if you

18
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.280
actually do tr background.

19
00:01:28.914 --> 00:01:29.909
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It just actually,

20
00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:30.846
hit Enter first.

21
00:01:30.846 --> 00:01:38.960
Right, tr background-color slate gray.

22
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.930
Look at that.

23
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.520
Because the tr is actually the td's,

24
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.930
which are being colored are inside a tr
and they're inheriting that color.

25
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.340
So, you can put a background
color on a column,

26
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.618
which is a nice quick way to do it,
but if you actually overwrite a tr and

27
00:01:57.618 --> 00:02:02.843
that's actually kinda nice because what
you can do is just highlight one of them.

28
00:02:02.843 --> 00:02:08.085
So tr nth-of-type 3.

29
00:02:08.085 --> 00:02:11.014
If you just want to highlight one,

30
00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:16.070
like when you're hovering over it or
something like that.

31
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.250
Or, tr hover, that's a nice effect.

32
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.390
So you can color the whole column and
then overwrite it that way.

33
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.690
So it's not fully useless.

34
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.220
It's a little bit useless,
but not totally.

35
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.650
So here, I have this little link.

36
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.120
To say try it out and let's take
a five minute break while we actually

37
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.660
open up this table and style it with

38
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.610
your new things.

39
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.710
Actually let me say a few things
before we take a break actually.

40
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.730
Which is, this is a really ugly table.

41
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.710
And there's ways of making
tables look much better,

42
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.490
mostly through spacing and removing stuff.

43
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.824
So what I might wanna do is
say thead ( border-bottom|

44
00:03:17.824 --> 00:03:23.068
1px solid}.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That doesn't work.

45
00:03:23.068 --> 00:03:31.330
Tr th, why didn't that work?

46
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.510
Okay, so I underlined it this way.

47
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.470
I'm going to put on all my td.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

48
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.520
th's, I'm gonna put
padding just to the right.

49
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:56.489
So I'm gonna do 0 0 0 10px).

50
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.990
And it gave it more space, but I actually
think I want top and bottom as well.

51
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.670
So I'm gonna do top 5px, 5px and

52
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.380
do you see that the table
already looks better, right?

53
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.340
Then I'm gonna do col,
what is the important column here?

54
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.140
Not the week,
because who cares about the week, right?

55
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.905
I think the name of the player
is the important part, so

56
00:04:24.905 --> 00:04:29.306
let's make that background color and
I hope you're playing along

57
00:04:29.306 --> 00:04:33.665
too.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Efefef,

58
00:04:33.665 --> 00:04:38.562
so I'm highlighting that, and
then I'm going to say, first of all,

59
00:04:38.562 --> 00:04:41.380
it's already looking much better.

60
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.880
That is no longer a hideous table.

61
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.240
But I'm gonna put it,
around the whole thing,

62
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.450
I wanna put a border of one pixel, solid.

63
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.546
And that's actually starting
to look like a good table, but

64
00:04:53.546 --> 00:04:56.050
I think that my caption is too close.

65
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.619
Remember, I am not a designer.

66
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.160
Padding 5 pixels.

67
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.510
Let me do padding 5px 0 10px.

68
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.940
That looks good.

69
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.789
Right, we're already getting it to
something where you could put it on

70
00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.460
a website and not be ashamed of yourself.

71
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.580
Font-weight,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Bold and

72
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.500
then let's actually make the t,

73
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:34.300
the tables across the column,
across the top or the header.

74
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.130
Let's do that,
give that a background color.

75
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.642
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And let's

76
00:05:47.642 --> 00:05:55.360
do #dedede.

77
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.520
I don't like the fact that we have
white between club and week stat line.

78
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.650
That doesn't look good.

79
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.330
So what, anyone remind me what
property will get rid of that spacing?

80
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Border colapse?

81
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.480
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Exactly.

82
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:18.489
And that it's put on the table.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

83
00:06:18.489 --> 00:06:23.580
there it looks much better except for,
I like more spacing than we have now.

84
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.174
So I'm gonna add to the padding.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I'm

85
00:06:28.174 --> 00:06:33.856
gonna do 10px, 5px,

86
00:06:33.856 --> 00:06:40.093
10px and 15px, okay.

87
00:06:40.093 --> 00:06:43.541
And I wanna stripe it,

88
00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:49.406
how would I stripe the table?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: T r the even or

89
00:06:49.406 --> 00:06:52.838
the even something.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: T r even, but

90
00:06:52.838 --> 00:06:58.129
what's the actual thing
between what holds the even?

91
00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:59.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: F of type.

92
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.360
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: F of type, very good.

93
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:08.143
So Tr, so
I'm going to do only the tr tbody.

94
00:07:08.143 --> 00:07:10.393
Right?

95
00:07:10.393 --> 00:07:16.024
T body, t-r,

96
00:07:16.024 --> 00:07:20.843
nth of type.

97
00:07:20.843 --> 00:07:26.850
Even and what I'm going to do is give it

98
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.340
color, rgba or

99
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:43.450
let me do this.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Black.

100
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:51.692
And how can I make it not black?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 10,

101
00:07:51.692 --> 00:07:59.135
there.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

102
00:07:59.135 --> 00:08:04.107
an interesting thing to note
is that I styled the tr and

103
00:08:04.107 --> 00:08:10.780
when it hits the column, right,
it's not overriding the column.

104
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.091
It's putting background
color on the Tr and

105
00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:15.974
the background color of
the column is coming through.

106
00:08:15.974 --> 00:08:20.435
See that?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

107
00:08:20.435 --> 00:08:26.071
now let's do Tr on hover,

108
00:08:26.071 --> 00:08:32.740
background color light blue.

109
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.720
I don't know if light
blue is actually a color.

110
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.570
It is!

111
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.220
There we go.

112
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.080
Why is jade not change in color.

113
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:56.875
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: What did we do?

114
00:08:56.875 --> 00:09:02.874
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]

115
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.150
We targeted it somehow.

116
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:09.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: If we put t body before Tr

117
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.526
hover, would that be more specific?

118
00:09:12.526 --> 00:09:13.389
Yeah.

119
00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:15.770
Good job.
