00:00:03.186 --> 00:00:04.567
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's go over transforms.

2
00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:10.401
Okay, so here, I'm gonna use this
little RSVP sign for everything.

3
00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:13.855
And the reason I said RSVP is because the
last time I did it, I did it with a plane,

4
00:00:13.855 --> 00:00:15.248
and when you'd flip the plane,

5
00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:18.263
you couldn't tell that it was
upside-down cuz it was symmetrical.

6
00:00:18.263 --> 00:00:20.999
But RSVP, when it's flipped
upside-down and you can't read it,

7
00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.913
you can really see it.

8
00:00:21.913 --> 00:00:26.993
So this little logo,
it's generated content on top of the RSVP.

9
00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:29.925
And it's the exact same size,
the exact same font.

10
00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:34.841
Everything's the exact same except for
it has the background color of pale

11
00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:38.677
golden rod and greenish blue
weird color as a drop shadow.

12
00:00:38.677 --> 00:00:39.924
So the original,

13
00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:44.505
what it would like without
the transform is always the white one.

14
00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:47.957
The way it looks with the transform
is the golden rod one.

15
00:00:47.957 --> 00:00:49.565
Well it's actually gold, I'm not sure.

16
00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:53.388
Anyway, so
here I've transformed the letters,

17
00:00:53.388 --> 00:00:57.946
I've translated it,
-90 pixels, and 300 pixels.

18
00:00:57.946 --> 00:01:03.814
Which means I've moved it 90 pixels
backwards and 300 pixels down.

19
00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:10.097
Then I've rotated it 50 degrees,
then I've scaled it so it's smaller.

20
00:01:10.097 --> 00:01:13.208
It's 70% of the width and

21
00:01:13.208 --> 00:01:18.526
90% of the height, and
then I've skewed it.

22
00:01:18.526 --> 00:01:20.645
We're gonna go all over those.

23
00:01:20.645 --> 00:01:27.194
Let's see if I can just not
move it down 300 pixels.

24
00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:30.432
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: No,
I can't edit this one.

25
00:01:30.432 --> 00:01:33.589
So this is how we transform something.

26
00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:37.071
We basically change it by translating it,
rotating it, and skewing it.

27
00:01:37.071 --> 00:01:41.212
You don't have to use all of them,
and the order actually matters.

28
00:01:41.212 --> 00:01:45.559
It's basically the syntax is we
can either say transform none or

29
00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:50.482
you can use up to all of these functions,
one or more of these functions.

30
00:01:50.482 --> 00:01:53.073
And there's actually a fifth
function which we'll cover later.

31
00:01:53.073 --> 00:01:55.109
So what does this support?

32
00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:57.717
That looks pretty green, doesn't it?

33
00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:00.249
Let's show all.

34
00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:02.590
And then go to IE cuz
that's what we always do.

35
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.234
It start with IE 9 and
with IE 9 it was supported with prefix.

36
00:02:07.234 --> 00:02:10.904
If you're not supporting IE 9 anymore,
don't use a prefix.

37
00:02:10.904 --> 00:02:16.098
I do not know about
the performance with Microsoft or

38
00:02:16.098 --> 00:02:21.420
IE 9 and transforms if it
actually causes a problem.

39
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.957
And the Blackberry 10, since no one
uses it it doesn't really matter.

40
00:02:25.957 --> 00:02:29.085
You don't need to add a WebKit prefix for
Blackberry.
