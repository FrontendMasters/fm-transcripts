00:00:03.323 --> 00:00:04.658
&gt;&gt; Estelle: Okay, then we have columns.

2
00:00:07.038 --> 00:00:10.940
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So the way columns work is
you have column-count, count-width,

3
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.000
column-rule, and column-gap.

4
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.529
So here I've 1 column and
the column-width is 10em's.

5
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.287
And the column-rule is grey,
and the column-gap is 2em's.

6
00:00:24.287 --> 00:00:27.227
So the reason that there's only a single

7
00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:32.260
column is because column-width
is a minimum column-width.

8
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.941
It won't break into 2
columns unless it's gonna be,

9
00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:42.380
it's basically a max column-count and
a min column-width.

10
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.943
So if I do 6 columns,
it's only gonna go up to 2 columns

11
00:00:46.943 --> 00:00:51.616
because I said each column
should be at least 10em's.

12
00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:56.660
So if I shrink this
down then I can have 6.

13
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.651
And my column-gap is 2 em's which is not
possible because some of these words

14
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:03.780
are just longer than they can be.

15
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.094
So let's just bring this up to this,
right?

16
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.096
So there's 1 between here and here, and

17
00:01:12.096 --> 00:01:15.770
generally 1 before it hyphenates
on the other side, right?

18
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.910
I think this is meat yeah?

19
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.770
And so the column-rule is
the gray line in the middle.

20
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.820
And the column-gap is how wide the gap is.

21
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.705
So it's actually 2 em's total,
it's 1 on each side,

22
00:01:34.705 --> 00:01:36.832
I think I said it was 2 em's on each side,
it's 1 on each side.

23
00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:42.510
&gt;&gt; Estelle: So columns might be
a nice place to use media queries.

24
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.230
Because you don't actually wanted to break
into columns unless it's a certain width.

25
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.900
Cuz what's the point?

26
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.630
But columns you don't
actually need media queries.

27
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.430
Because when you do columns, 8em 3, right?

28
00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.240
That says,
I want a maximum of 3 columns and or

29
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.240
each column should be a minimum of 8em's.

30
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.830
So if I did 18 em's,
it would change 2 columns.

31
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.546
Cuz what that line says is I want columns
that are at least 18 em's wide but

32
00:02:12.546 --> 00:02:14.554
not more than 3 columns.

33
00:02:14.554 --> 00:02:19.961
So here it's saying to make it 18 wide,
I can only have 2 columns.

34
00:02:22.628 --> 00:02:25.904
&gt;&gt; Estelle: If I get rid of this,
by the way this is also,

35
00:02:25.904 --> 00:02:28.950
I'm teaching you columns right now.

36
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.046
We've kind of broken out of media
queries and we're now into columns.

37
00:02:33.046 --> 00:02:36.240
So span, you can have column-span and

38
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.790
it will allow an element to
go across all the columns.

39
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.740
And then it will restart
the next set of columns.

40
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.311
So if you have an h1 in the middle,
it will basically break it,

41
00:02:49.311 --> 00:02:54.510
put an h1 across all of them, and
then restart the text underneath it.

42
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.430
So this is the column shorthand, here.

43
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.550
We have basically, the column-count,
column-width, column-rule and column-gap.

44
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.750
Here we just have columns, and it has
the column-width and the column-count.

45
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.250
It's a shorthand.
