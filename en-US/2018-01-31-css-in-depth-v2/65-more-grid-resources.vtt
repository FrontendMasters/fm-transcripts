&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Rachel Andrews, who's
awesome, has this website called Grid by

2
00:00:06.227 --> 00:00:09.702
Example, and there's a little
button that says Start Here, and

3
00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:13.190
that's where you should
start to learn the basics.

4
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.884
You basically know the basics, but

5
00:00:14.884 --> 00:00:18.611
you're gonna forget everything I just
told you today cuz you're gonna have so

6
00:00:18.611 --> 00:00:21.393
much by the end of the day that
your brain is gonna explode.

7
00:00:21.393 --> 00:00:24.489
So you wanna come here and

8
00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:29.066
then Jen Simmons has an intro to CSS.

9
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:33.861
And it's not just an intro to CSS,
but she has all of these labs.

10
00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:38.484
So when you go to her webpage, I'm just
gonna go to jensimmons.com, here it is,

11
00:00:38.484 --> 00:00:39.293
Jen Simmons.

12
00:00:39.293 --> 00:00:41.102
There's a little thing
right here called Labs.

13
00:00:41.102 --> 00:00:46.882
You click on Labs, and
she has l a monopoly done with CSS grid.

14
00:00:50.772 --> 00:00:53.447
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: She's a great graphic

15
00:00:53.447 --> 00:00:59.646
designer, so
she basically has this example here.

16
00:00:59.646 --> 00:01:04.425
Where that is a much
more beautiful website,

17
00:01:04.425 --> 00:01:08.587
she makes very good use of white space.

18
00:01:08.587 --> 00:01:13.444
So here, we have five images placed
in a grid where she basically said

19
00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:15.117
this is the row I want and

20
00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:20.375
this is the column I want
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: They're

21
00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:24.922
what you call explicitly placed and
then she has some artwork here,

22
00:01:24.922 --> 00:01:30.991
the Responsive Mondrian.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Nope,

23
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:32.749
there's one where it actually changes.

24
00:01:40.864 --> 00:01:42.153
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This one,

25
00:01:42.153 --> 00:01:47.320
you'll see that it changes as you grow it.

26
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.552
What you want to do with these things
is you want to take a look at them,

27
00:01:52.552 --> 00:01:56.449
go wow, that's amazing and
then do a view source.

28
00:01:56.449 --> 00:02:02.085
Look at how she created it and
take a look at the CSS and

29
00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:05.170
go, wow, that's so easy.

30
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.294
Grid, once you get used to it,
makes laying out pages super easy.
