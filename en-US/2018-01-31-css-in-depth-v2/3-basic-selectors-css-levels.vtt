00:00:03.291 --> 00:00:11.030
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So, the link for
this is estelle.github.io/cssmastery/.

2
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.148
And I'm just gonna click on this and
make sure that that link actually works.

3
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.900
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It goes
right to selectors, okay.

4
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.410
So when you go to CSS mastery,
it's slash selectors, but

5
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.100
if you go to that page
you'll be linked to this.

6
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.135
So throughout the deck,
if you get lost, always just go to

7
00:00:32.135 --> 00:00:37.630
estelle.github.io/cssmastery and
click on whatever topic we're discussing.

8
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.178
We might not be at the first
slide when you get there, but

9
00:00:41.178 --> 00:00:42.923
you can just go through it.

10
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:47.058
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
in terms of selectors,

11
00:00:47.058 --> 00:00:51.970
there are three basic selectors that
have been around since forever.

12
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.470
Which are the ID selectors, the class
selectors, and the element selectors.

13
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.310
Anytime you have an ID in your CSS,

14
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.130
you can target it with HTML and
with JavaScript.

15
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.665
I like to reserve the ID for
my JavaScript, and not add it in for CSS.

16
00:01:13.665 --> 00:01:16.377
And we're gonna cover so
many ways of targeting elements,

17
00:01:16.377 --> 00:01:18.341
that you won't actually need to put an ID.

18
00:01:18.341 --> 00:01:22.835
But it will also teach you how to
overwrite the specificity of an ID

19
00:01:22.835 --> 00:01:24.390
selector.

20
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.770
You want to always use
the lowest specificity possible

21
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.080
whenever you are targeting an element.

22
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.316
So preferably, you wanna use the last one,
which is an li.

23
00:01:33.316 --> 00:01:38.640
Target all your lis, or you actually wanna
target your entire your entire body.

24
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.470
And everything that's inherited
to have the exact same font and

25
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.020
the exact same color and
the exact same line height.

26
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.450
You wanna make it very broad and
then go more specific.

27
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.410
So always do as broad as possible because
your site will look way better than if you

28
00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.250
just do IDs, and then have to
style everything individually.

29
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.017
If you want to just target
something specific,

30
00:02:04.017 --> 00:02:06.994
there's a lot of different ways
to target it specifically.

31
00:02:06.994 --> 00:02:11.160
But if you have access to your HTML,
you can put a class in your HTML, and

32
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.137
then target it.

33
00:02:12.137 --> 00:02:17.900
So in this example here,
it says class myClass, and class myClass.

34
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.920
So when I put a period in
front of that class name,

35
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.570
I will target all the elements
that have that class.

36
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.170
So I will target these two.

37
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.620
And then, when I use my ID, I put a pound
sign in front of the case sensitive ID

38
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.830
that'll match this right there.

39
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.533
It is case sensitive as is class.

40
00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:43.910
So, through out the deck,
there will be play times.

41
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.220
If you're completely new to CSS, you
can take the time, and play right here.

42
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.845
I'm just gonna change this to

43
00:02:53.845 --> 00:02:58.703
font-size,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 4em,

44
00:02:58.703 --> 00:03:02.829
remember when I said that there would
be live examples throughout the deck.

45
00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.902
Whenever you see the CSS block in gray,

46
00:03:05.902 --> 00:03:10.663
it means it's editable and
it will edit the rest of the page.

47
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.690
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
in CSS selectors, in CSS level 1,

48
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.945
which was one large specification,

49
00:03:19.945 --> 00:03:25.330
they declared six different
ways of targeting elements.

50
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.990
There was the element selector,
which we already covered.

51
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.580
There was a descendant selector,
which is just a space.

52
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.330
And that space is actually considered to
be combinator, a space is a combinator.

53
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.080
Then there was a class ID, and then
they also did links, and active links.

54
00:03:43.204 --> 00:03:48.989
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: In level 2, we got,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Two more combinators,

55
00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.467
which was the greater than sign,
meaning a direct child and the plus sign,

56
00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:58.320
meaning adjacent sibling which is the
element that comes immediately after it.

57
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.890
And then we got a bunch
of attribute selectors,

58
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.690
we got some pseudo elements including
first line and first letter.

59
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.800
No these have pseudo classes,
no those are pseudo elements.

60
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.199
Before and after,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then we go on a few

61
00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:23.525
other selectors including language,
focus, hover, visited, and first child.

62
00:04:25.692 --> 00:04:29.217
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: In CSS3,
we were given a whole slew more and

63
00:04:29.217 --> 00:04:31.904
we're gonna cover all of these.

64
00:04:31.904 --> 00:04:38.384
In the UI specification,
user-interface specification,

65
00:04:38.384 --> 00:04:43.520
so not in CSS3 or
CSS selector level three.

66
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.200
But in the UI and
now in CSS selectors level four,

67
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.200
we got all of these UI features.

68
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.020
Such as a something is valid or invalid.

69
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.504
So, when you hear CSS three, there's
actually no one specification called CSS3.

70
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.980
Originally the first
specification was CSS level one,

71
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.270
then there was CSS level two and then 2.1.

72
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.856
And they came in quick succession,

73
00:05:11.856 --> 00:05:16.700
2.1 came very quickly after two and
it fixed them things in two.

74
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.120
And then CSS3 was actually
broken out into modules.

75
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.890
So when you saw the table of contents,

76
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:28.110
those were all different modules,
like selector is its own modules.

77
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.670
When now it's CSS selectors level 4,
the flex box and grid are at level one.

78
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.560
So it's called CSS3,

79
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.470
there is never going to be a CSS level
4 because everything is now module.

80
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.770
Some of them are at level 4,
some of them are at level 1.

81
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.230
There's more CSS selectors in level 4,
some of these are supported and

82
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.010
some of these are not yet.

83
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.740
And then we have some selectors
that I'm going to cover

84
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.700
some of or I'll just briefly mention,
and some that we removed.

85
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.693
So originally we were going to have a
parent selector of E bang greater than F,

86
00:06:07.693 --> 00:06:12.140
meaning hit that parent
that is a parent of F.

87
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.260
They came up with a different syntax,
so I'm gonna go over all of those.

88
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.660
If you ever want all the selectors on
one page I did create this resource.

89
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.436
All you have to do is click open and
this will open in another page.
