00:00:02.162 --> 00:00:03.931
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay,
so grid item properties,

2
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:08.418
we've talked about grid-column-start,
grid-column-end, grid-column,

3
00:00:08.418 --> 00:00:11.270
grid-row-start, grid-row-end, grid-row.

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.590
Did we talk about grid-area?

5
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.641
Yes, we did.
That's the shorthand.

6
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:14.560
Okay.

7
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.863
And then later on we're
gonna have justify-self and

8
00:00:18.863 --> 00:00:23.263
align-self, which are basically
just overrides for

9
00:00:23.263 --> 00:00:28.249
justify-content and
align-content but just for one cell.

10
00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.531
So let's actually play with the layout.

11
00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:33.473
So we have a Holy Grail Layout, right?

12
00:00:33.473 --> 00:00:37.239
Do you remember the Holy Grail Layout
when we did with the flexbox?

13
00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.989
Well, we can do it with grid as well and

14
00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.932
grid is sometimes a more
appropriate way to do it.

15
00:00:45.932 --> 00:00:52.620
So just one other thing before I
go onto that holy grail layout.

16
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.040
The difference basically
between flex box and

17
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.909
grid is, do you see that number 4,
how it spans two lines?

18
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.260
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There's no
way to do that in Flexbox.

19
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.660
In Flexbox, it basically loads
all the way across on one line.

20
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.720
Both of them,
you can change the order, right?

21
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.340
But when you change the order in Flexbox,

22
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.580
it just basically places it
between the two cells beforehand.

23
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.650
When you change the order in grid,

24
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.980
you're basically saying put this is
exactly here, this is where I want it.

25
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.070
And everything else is
just gonna flow around it.

26
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.250
If you actually place two items in the
exact same location, that's fine in grid.

27
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.758
You can actually place one
thing on top of the other.

28
00:01:38.758 --> 00:01:45.108
So let's go onto the holy grail,
which is basically we wanna display grid,

29
00:01:45.108 --> 00:01:49.193
columns, you're gonna
divide into six parts.

30
00:01:49.193 --> 00:01:53.014
One third is gonna be between the nav and
the aside.

31
00:01:53.014 --> 00:01:58.987
And then the main area or the main
article is gonna be in the middle,

32
00:01:58.987 --> 00:02:02.210
taking up two thirds of it.

33
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.665
And then the rows you want the header
to be 3 ems high, you want

34
00:02:07.665 --> 00:02:13.590
the content to be all the available
space that's left over,

35
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.680
and you want the footer just to
be half the size of the header.

36
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.100
So that's what we're going to do.

37
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:21.551
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: We're
gonna do a little bit more.

38
00:02:21.551 --> 00:02:26.646
We're gonna basically say the grid-row for
the header goes from the first.

39
00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.823
It basically takes up the whole first row.

40
00:02:28.823 --> 00:02:32.866
It goes from the first grid
line to the second grid line.

41
00:02:32.866 --> 00:02:35.291
And the grid-column takes
up all four columns.

42
00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:40.360
The footer is the third row and
goes to the fourth.

43
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.680
And this is what would have
happened anyway, okay?

44
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.030
But then what I had to do
is I had to add the style,

45
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.090
which you never have to do in real life.

46
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.960
Because right here I display
the style block, so it's on the page.

47
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.340
So I want the style to stay at the bottom.

48
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.494
So I basically give this style,
put it on the fourth row, and

49
00:02:58.494 --> 00:03:00.540
make it go all the way across.

50
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.286
So we're gonna actually play with
the style and change the style, why not?

51
00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:09.752
So let's get rid of this and there we go.

52
00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:10.593
So what happened?

53
00:03:10.593 --> 00:03:16.150
The header went from the first grid
line to the second grid line and

54
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.303
from the left-most grid line
to the right-most grid line,

55
00:03:21.303 --> 00:03:25.060
the navigation takes
up all the free space.

56
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.410
No, it doesn't,
it takes up two thirds of it and

57
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.790
each one of these takes up one sixth
because we have 1fr, 4fr, 1fr.

58
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.120
What's 1 + 4 + 1?

59
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.530
I can't do math this early in the morning.

60
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.360
So [INAUDIBLE] count it with their toes.

61
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.930
No, with their fingers, that's better.

62
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.440
Keep your shoes on.

63
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.180
We won't go above ten so
that we don't have to count with our toes.

64
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.783
And then grid-template-rows,
the first one is 3ems.

65
00:03:50.783 --> 00:03:55.150
We could change it to 4ems or
5ems if we want the header to be taller.

66
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.655
The middle part takes all
the available space after that because

67
00:03:59.655 --> 00:04:02.166
the bottom part is just 1.5ems.

68
00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:06.020
So it declared an absolute
length on the footer and

69
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.067
on the header and basically said
that middle area, the article,

70
00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:15.219
nav and aside,
distributed over rows in the middle.

71
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.370
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so header,
footer, style, let's change the style.

72
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.867
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Because why not?

73
00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:28.460
Let's just make it go from 1 to 3.

74
00:04:31.989 --> 00:04:34.010
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Why not?

75
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.960
Let's make it go from 4 to 7.

76
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.510
That doesn't make a difference, right?

77
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.280
Because now if we actually added items,
if you want here, one here and one here.

78
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.540
Because it's now going across three rows,
right?

79
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.670
So we're gonna take it from 4/5,
5/6, and 6/7.

80
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.690
But because we don't have any extra cells,
it doesn't matter.

81
00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.964
If I did just,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 2/3 and 1/3.

82
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.490
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
then I'm gonna take the nav and

83
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.881
I'm gonna put it in the same spot.

84
00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:21.890
So the nav and
the style are at the exact same location.

85
00:05:24.121 --> 00:05:26.670
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You can do that.

86
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.758
Don't, don't but you can.
