00:00:02.532 --> 00:00:05.911
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So,
let's talk about adding the gutters.

2
00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:09.303
So far I added gutters,
I believe, or no, did I not?

3
00:00:09.303 --> 00:00:12.775
I added gutters to make it look better but
I didn't tell you about it.

4
00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:15.397
Because this is what it
looks like without gutters.

5
00:00:15.397 --> 00:00:17.850
All right, that's ugly.

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.414
One of the nice things, that way you
don't have to worry about margins.

7
00:00:23.414 --> 00:00:25.871
You always have the same amount
of margins between cells.

8
00:00:25.871 --> 00:00:28.772
It's really nice to have a nice
layout with good white space.

9
00:00:28.772 --> 00:00:31.737
White space makes websites
much more readable.

10
00:00:31.737 --> 00:00:37.003
So instead of saying, here's a paragraph
of text, and I want padding here, and then

11
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:42.434
margins, and you can just say, well, it's
gonna be 20 pixels between any element.

12
00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:45.742
So it's going to be legible.

13
00:00:45.742 --> 00:00:51.502
Okay, so we have three properties.

14
00:00:51.502 --> 00:00:57.102
We have the grid-column-gap,
the grid-row-gap and

15
00:00:57.102 --> 00:01:01.891
then just a shorthand,
which is the grid-gap.

16
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:05.359
And margin does actually
still work on these, so

17
00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:07.990
let's go over here and play with it.

18
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.020
So when I say grid row,
it's between each row.

19
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.870
When I say grid gap, column gap,
it's between the columns.

20
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.390
When I undo this one right here,
it's going to be the exact same.

21
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.788
Because the order is row, and then column.

22
00:01:31.115 --> 00:01:33.663
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
top to bottom, left-right,

23
00:01:33.663 --> 00:01:38.870
which makes it less confusing than
when we were doing the tables.

24
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.810
Okay, so here,
let's just make it 40 pixels.

25
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.117
Okay, and then 10.

26
00:01:47.117 --> 00:01:52.234
And that might make you realize
why you probably just wanna do one

27
00:01:52.234 --> 00:01:59.072
number overall for column gap, cuz that
looks much better, right, having it even.

28
00:01:59.072 --> 00:02:04.588
You can use different units,
right, 1m instead.

29
00:02:04.588 --> 00:02:13.160
But let's actually put margin on
one of these li Nth of type 3.

30
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.520
Margin 20 pixels.

31
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.216
So margins still works.

32
00:02:20.216 --> 00:02:26.111
Box sizing, border box.

33
00:02:33.342 --> 00:02:35.489
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I just
wanted to see what that did.

34
00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:42.220
And then we can put padding, 30 pixels.

35
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.881
And it just change the whole
layout of the page.

36
00:02:49.113 --> 00:02:52.706
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Because the FR unit
is now a different length, right?

37
00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:54.470
Before, it maintained the same length, but

38
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.770
then now that I added padding,
that element is much bigger.

39
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.526
But between the margin and the padding,
the element got much bigger,

40
00:03:00.526 --> 00:03:02.080
which shrank the amount of free space.

41
00:03:06.861 --> 00:03:07.669
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so

42
00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:13.229
what I want you to do over the next
five minutes is to create a grid.

43
00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:15.945
So there's a little thing here,
so let's try it out.

44
00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:19.140
And I want you to create a grid
container with a display property, or

45
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.178
grid template area, but
we didn't go over grid template area.

46
00:03:22.178 --> 00:03:26.884
So just forget that there's an or
here, or either.

47
00:03:26.884 --> 00:03:31.502
And then optional added gutter with
grid-gap, or grid-column-gap and

48
00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:32.681
grip-row-gap.
