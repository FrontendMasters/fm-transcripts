00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:08.070
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so the next,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Pseudo

2
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:15.160
class I wanted to talk about is :root,
it matches the root element.

3
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.110
In HTML that is the HTML,

4
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.880
if you're going to declare a rem unit,
that is the correct thing to do.

5
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.490
You could use HTML and
declare it there, but

6
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.200
then it would only match
your HTML documents.

7
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.497
It would not match anything else.

8
00:00:38.558 --> 00:00:43.370
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Style :root only
if showing head, I've no clue what

9
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.270
I've meant by that, but
root basically doesn't show.

10
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.906
But I'm actually showing it, because
how do you think I did this slide so

11
00:00:52.906 --> 00:00:55.950
that you could edit everything,
anyone know?

12
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.530
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Right here in these,
I did head display block.

13
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.880
Hide everything in the head except for
the last CSS

14
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.740
style block that has the class or
the ID of editme.

15
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.010
And that is the only one
that is actually showing.

16
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.270
So you're actually editing the style
sheet at the top of the page.

17
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.510
And so
there's no JavaScript in all of these.

18
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.402
There is JavaScript to make
it go left to right, but

19
00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:29.050
I actually have a slide deck where
there's absolutely no JavaScript.

20
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.442
And if I come up with another reason
to show it to you, I'll show it to you.

21
00:01:34.442 --> 00:01:37.291
Okay, so empty and blank.

22
00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:44.572
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Empty has support,
and it's an empty element.

23
00:01:44.572 --> 00:01:49.227
So all the elements that
are self-closing like an image or

24
00:01:49.227 --> 00:01:53.971
an input,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Are empty elements.

25
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:57.280
They are empty elements by default.

26
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.000
But any element that has no content in it,
no spaces, is also empty.

27
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.010
If it only has a comment and

28
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.790
the comment goes from the beginning
to the end, it is empty.

29
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.060
If it has just a white space, it is blank.

30
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.850
But blank is not supported
in browsers yet.

31
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.920
It is supported as :-moz-whitespace-only,
so it is possible.

32
00:02:25.015 --> 00:02:27.368
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
I'm just gonna get rid of this.

33
00:02:27.368 --> 00:02:31.430
Okay, I just wanted to make sure there
was nothing at the bottom of the page.

34
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.550
So empty elements that
are just basically the HTML

35
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.780
elements that are defined as empty,
those are automatically matched by empty.

36
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.540
As well as empty elements that
are not normally empty, but

37
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.960
they have no content in
them other than a comment.

38
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.990
So that's empty, and
blank is not supported yet.

39
00:02:49.426 --> 00:02:51.950
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I very rarely,
if ever, use this one.

40
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.309
I would like to actually use
:-moz-whitespace-only or

41
00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:02.522
blank when I'm doing content
management systems, CSS.

42
00:03:02.522 --> 00:03:06.145
And people are doing it because they
it often adds just extra spaces at

43
00:03:06.145 --> 00:03:07.591
the bottom accidentally.

44
00:03:07.591 --> 00:03:12.007
And they don't know to remove all the
paragraphs with not breaking space inside.
