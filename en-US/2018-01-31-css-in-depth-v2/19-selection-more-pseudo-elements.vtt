00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.230
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So the selection,
which I didn't go deep into,

2
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.200
I'm going to go a little
bit deeper into that.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.440
We saw this slide, and background color,
that's actually not the class.

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.910
Cuz that's more like an orange and
that was more of a deep red.

5
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.221
The reason that I want to go into more
into selection is because some-some

6
00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:24.900
selection is something
you want very rarely, but

7
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.200
it's sometimes something
you want to disable.

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.850
The only times you want to disable it is
on a mobile device, when someone is doing

9
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.630
some type of action, and you don't want
the, take a picture of this to show up.

10
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.450
Sometimes when someone hovers over
something too long, it's to exit and you

11
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.460
would get a copy paste or you get a drop
this image here or something like that.

12
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.490
So you can disable selection.

13
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.540
That is the only case where you want
to disable it is on a mobile device

14
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.790
when you have an interactive thing that
someone might be touching your screen for

15
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.790
a long time.

16
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.370
And you don't want the native
feature of copying or

17
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.950
dropping an image or
anything like that showing up.

18
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.302
So this is something you
should almost never use,

19
00:01:05.302 --> 00:01:07.040
but just know that it's available.

20
00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:14.559
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If

21
00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:18.757
you do these things, so
you can do -webkit-tap-highlight-color,

22
00:01:18.757 --> 00:01:22.570
you can target it like that,
you can change the color.

23
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.600
You can say user select none and
you can touch call out none.

24
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.540
And it wasn't attached to this or

25
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.080
otherwise that wouldn't
been able to select it.

26
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.395
So I just want you to know that those are
available if you need them, but don't use

27
00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:39.600
them because, it's kind of, I think
the term is asshole-letic thing to do.

28
00:01:42.354 --> 00:01:45.350
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then there's
browser specific pseudo elements.

29
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.460
There's a lot of there's
basically a shadow dom, and

30
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.510
there's a lot of elements on
the page which you don't style.

31
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.010
You don't style the scroll bar,
generally but you can.

32
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.680
And so these are different values for
Microsoft,

33
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.100
I'm not saying these are valid anymore,
if they exist.

34
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.020
These are ones that have existed.

35
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.040
Webkit has ones like you can
target the progress bar,

36
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.690
the progress value, the inner spin
button on a number input type.

37
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.910
You can actually style them and
you would do so by targeting the,

38
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.020
these are non standards but there are tons
and tons of pseudo elements that exist.

39
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.610
There's just hidden in the shadow dom.

40
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.960
So here, if you see the scroll bar,
I made it orange when you hover over it.

41
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.180
And you can drag it, and
it's round and I did that, oops.

42
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:47.300
I did that by targeting it, so I have the
webkit scroll bar, which I've made orange.

43
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.970
I've made the track semi translucent black
over it, so it's a little bit darker.

44
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.030
I made this thumb
a different color orange,

45
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.180
when the window's inactive I
did some background of gray.

46
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.060
When I hover over it
here it turns royal blue.

47
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.950
That's this right here, scroll bar.

48
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.110
The part of the scroll bar thumb, right?

49
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.750
When it's hovered I make it blue.

50
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.400
So that's the kind of stuff
that the browser is actually

51
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.830
styling behind the scenes.

52
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.520
And how did I find out about
all of these different things?

53
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.250
The dev tools.

54
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.150
The dev tools will show you everything.

55
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.770
When you hit here, and

56
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.400
I'm not gonna actually take long
enough to go find it, what's going on.

57
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:49.120
But in my dev tools,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There is my style.

58
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.700
I told you I'll put a style block and,

59
00:03:59.931 --> 00:04:01.750
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
then I have a grammarly button.

60
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.265
And that is because I have grammarly.

61
00:04:03.265 --> 00:04:05.588
Do you question what grammarly is?

62
00:04:05.588 --> 00:04:08.695
It's an awesome extension and
that's why I don't have many typos.

63
00:04:08.695 --> 00:04:15.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

64
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.460
I can actually find it for you.

65
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:22.510
Now when you look over here,
I'm just gonna go back.

66
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.210
Select the style, go here, go down,

67
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.210
and sometimes it has all sorts of
information, and yes it does, right here.

68
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.260
The scroll bar element,
the pseudo scroll bar element,

69
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.290
scroll bar colon colon webkit
scroll bar and there it is.

70
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.940
So the dev tools provide you
with all sorts of information.

71
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.519
And not only that, but
if you do computed-style,

72
00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:57.520
and here,
it has just the ones that are declared.

73
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.310
But if I do Show All,
it adds all these other styles,

74
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.376
or properties that I'd never heard about.

75
00:05:05.376 --> 00:05:11.040
So like, max-zoom,
I don't know what that does.

76
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.560
I kind of do know what that does.

77
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.200
What does R do?

78
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.210
I think that's the radius for
an svg circle, but I don't know.

79
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.800
Since it's new I could look it up.

80
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.830
Except for I can't, because have you ever
tried doing a search for the letter R?

81
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.780
Except for below it says RX and RY, so

82
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.660
I'm pretty sure it's an SVG property.

83
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.960
Scroll snap type.

84
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.470
That's something cool to look up.

85
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.790
So use your developer
tools as a learning tool.

86
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.970
Back to the content of our slides.

87
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.407
We finished selectors.
