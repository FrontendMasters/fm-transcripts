00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:04.959
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
the next section is pseudo-elements.

2
00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:11.222
And you can find it on the GitHub page and
slide 79, which is where we're starting.

3
00:00:11.222 --> 00:00:13.147
So there are several pseudo-elements.

4
00:00:13.147 --> 00:00:17.895
And since CSS 2.1 they've had two colons
in front of them to differentiate

5
00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:21.048
between pseudo-elements and
pseudo-classes.

6
00:00:21.048 --> 00:00:26.644
If you actually put one colon they work
fine, but the correct syntax is two.

7
00:00:26.644 --> 00:00:31.844
So we have first-line, first-letter,
selection before and after.

8
00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:36.095
And interestingly,
selection is not in the specification,

9
00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:38.965
not even yet in CSS selectors level four.

10
00:00:38.965 --> 00:00:43.009
Pseudo-classes select
elements that actually exist.

11
00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:47.951
There is something before the element,
there is an opening and closing tag, or

12
00:00:47.951 --> 00:00:49.336
a faux tag.

13
00:00:49.336 --> 00:00:53.650
Pseudo-elements create these faux, or
fake, if you've ever heard of faux pearls,

14
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.450
it means they're not really pearls.

15
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.414
But it sounds French so it sounds fancy.

16
00:00:57.414 --> 00:01:01.280
So it's a faux element that
creates a fake before and

17
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.140
after, and then whatever content
is in there you can style.

18
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.960
So in this section,
the first-letter pseudo-element.

19
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.110
It's as if there was a first element tag,
and

20
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.700
then an end first element tag
right around that first letter.

21
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.080
So in this case,
I have targeted with the selector,

22
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.440
the first letter of the paragraph
that is the first of its type.

23
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.920
And the reason I have chosen to
do a paragraph first of its type,

24
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.257
is because if I didn't, the drop caps
would look absolutely horrendous, and

25
00:01:34.257 --> 00:01:36.049
it would be impossible to read.

26
00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.647
So this is an example of combining
a pseudo-element with a pseudo-class,

27
00:01:42.647 --> 00:01:49.050
or structural selector, to just hit
one thing that you really wanna hit.

28
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.557
So you can always use
combinations like this.

29
00:01:51.557 --> 00:01:57.059
So in this case, it's as if that letter
Y itself was in its own element,

30
00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:59.276
and we were able to style it.

31
00:01:59.276 --> 00:02:06.854
But because it is a letter, you kind
of have to position it to give it.

32
00:02:06.854 --> 00:02:10.774
It's like an inline span,
you can't do everything to it.

33
00:02:10.774 --> 00:02:13.185
But in this case,
by positioning it, we have.

34
00:02:13.185 --> 00:02:18.595
We've given it three times the size,
and floated it.

35
00:02:18.595 --> 00:02:21.702
And the reason that we floated it,

36
00:02:21.702 --> 00:02:27.608
because if we didn't float it,
it would just, it looks better.

37
00:02:27.608 --> 00:02:31.928
It floats it and you put the text
around it, so that's first-letter.

38
00:02:31.928 --> 00:02:37.376
It's just a way to style the first letter
which is usually used for drop caps.

39
00:02:37.376 --> 00:02:43.069
Next we have selection, and
here I am selecting this and it is red.

40
00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.615
Everywhere else that I selected something,
it wasn't red, it was blue,

41
00:02:47.615 --> 00:02:51.090
which was the default, but
here I change the selection.

42
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.470
And here it says, in this slide,

43
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.321
anything that I select make
the background red and the color white.
