00:00:02.575 --> 00:00:04.105
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
let's talk about border-radius.

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.192
In the upper right hand corner, we have
border-radius 0, which is the default.

3
00:00:10.192 --> 00:00:14.170
I put two different colors on it so
that you could see where the angles are.

4
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.998
And when we learned how to make triangles
or looked at making triangles yesterday

5
00:00:18.998 --> 00:00:24.122
with generated content, that was the power
of, we could actually use those angles.

6
00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:26.967
The thing is,
when you're doing border-radius,

7
00:00:26.967 --> 00:00:29.720
you start getting kind
of funky-looking stuff.

8
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.600
Like the border-radius at 20 pixels,

9
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.690
and the border-radius at 50 pixels,
it's just a little bit weird.

10
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.000
So do not prefix border radius.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.106
I see moz-border-radius in so
many different things, and

12
00:00:45.106 --> 00:00:48.659
I think it's been supported
since Firefox 3.6?

13
00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.916
Who's here's still supporting Firefox 3.6?

14
00:00:51.916 --> 00:00:57.665
Right, so why do I see
moz-border-radius all over the place?

15
00:00:57.665 --> 00:01:01.033
We also don't wanna use
webkit border-radius,

16
00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:06.015
cuz even though Android 2.3 still
needs it, it slows the device down.

17
00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:09.018
So a person's already on a crappy device,
and

18
00:01:09.018 --> 00:01:13.408
you're just making their life worse,
so don't ever prefix this.

19
00:01:13.408 --> 00:01:17.751
And I believe, last year on the SAS
homepage, where it was showing you how

20
00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:21.957
to use functions, it actually
expanded using moz-border-radius,

21
00:01:21.957 --> 00:01:24.006
and I'm kinda like, please get.

22
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:27.822
So when you're using pre-processors or
post-processors,

23
00:01:27.822 --> 00:01:31.425
make sure you're not adding
cruft when you don't need it.

24
00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:36.368
Okay, so to make a circle, you need to
have an element that has the same height

25
00:01:36.368 --> 00:01:39.884
and width, otherwise,
it's going to be an ellipse.

26
00:01:39.884 --> 00:01:43.295
But if you wanna make an ellipse or
a circle, and

27
00:01:43.295 --> 00:01:47.916
a circle is a type of ellipse,
just use border-radius 50%.

28
00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:54.059
If you put two values, it's different
than putting two values with a slash.

29
00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:58.681
So in the third example, we have
border-radius 10 pixels, 30 pixels.

30
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:01.250
Which means the upper left-hand corner and

31
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.359
the bottom right-hand corner have
a border-radius of 10 pixels.

32
00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:08.225
And the upper right-hand corner and

33
00:02:08.225 --> 00:02:12.765
the lower left-hand corner
have a radius of 30 pixels.

34
00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:20.299
Which is much prettier than the thing
we're doing next, which is 10px / 30px.

35
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.710
That's basically saying,
horizontally make the border

36
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.140
radius 30 pixels and vertically make
it 10 pixels, or the other way round.

37
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.522
And then we can do really ugly stuff,
cuz we can put all four values.

38
00:02:38.522 --> 00:02:43.515
The bottom one, that's ugly,
it's called uglification, and

39
00:02:43.515 --> 00:02:47.510
it's something we're
learning a lot about today,

40
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.889
that's how to make
an ugly thing on the web.

41
00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:54.264
So that's saying basically,

42
00:02:54.264 --> 00:02:59.974
the upper left-hand is
10 pixels by 30 pixels,

43
00:02:59.974 --> 00:03:03.492
the upper right is 35 by 35.

44
00:03:03.492 --> 00:03:08.872
The bottom right is 20 by 5,
and the bottom left is 15 by 5.

45
00:03:08.872 --> 00:03:11.049
That's just ugly, but you can do that,

46
00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.330
so just realize that that's
what border-radius is doing.

47
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.154
So let's just play with border-radius for
45 seconds,

48
00:03:17.154 --> 00:03:19.520
try to make this as ugly as possible.

49
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.300
Another thing to note on this,
as you're making this ugly is,

50
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.120
you see,
the original corner would have been here.

51
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.398
And that's where this is going,
it's going to that mark right there.

52
00:03:32.398 --> 00:03:37.038
So it's actually cutting off,
it's on the bottom edge.

53
00:03:39.335 --> 00:03:41.638
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Because your
border-radius will curve in, but

54
00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:43.105
your colors will stay angled.

55
00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:46.583
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
if you just get rid of the slash,

56
00:03:46.583 --> 00:03:48.491
that's actually not ugly anymore.

57
00:03:51.453 --> 00:03:55.342
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
realize that the slash is in the syntax.

58
00:03:55.342 --> 00:03:58.941
And now that you know it,
let's see if we even use it anywhere.

59
00:04:04.068 --> 00:04:06.726
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: No,
all the examples with slashes are ugly.

60
00:04:09.368 --> 00:04:14.587
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And the thing is,
if you're going to use the shorthand or

61
00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:21.837
the longhand of a border,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Or

62
00:04:21.837 --> 00:04:27.265
is it top-left-radius, top-right, yeah.

63
00:04:27.265 --> 00:04:34.246
So if I wanna make this ugly,
I actually just do 40%,

64
00:04:34.246 --> 00:04:38.714
or 20%, right, that's ugly.

65
00:04:38.714 --> 00:04:43.540
But when I have two different values,
so a different value for vertical and

66
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.366
horizontal, so the vertical is 20
pixels and the horizontal is 50%,

67
00:04:48.366 --> 00:04:49.900
there's no slash.

68
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.821
So there's only slash in the longhand,
not in the shorthand.

69
00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.651
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, let's go on to
border images, so what is a border image?

70
00:05:02.446 --> 00:05:03.918
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Or how is it supported?

71
00:05:07.548 --> 00:05:10.692
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Considering
it's been around,

72
00:05:10.692 --> 00:05:15.632
let's just show you how
long it's been around, and

73
00:05:15.632 --> 00:05:21.936
it's still prefixed,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's

74
00:05:21.936 --> 00:05:26.257
not even looking like it's gonna
lose its prefix anytime soon.

75
00:05:26.257 --> 00:05:31.412
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
let me just reload this page.

76
00:05:31.412 --> 00:05:39.530
Okay, so the border-image the underlying
properties are the border-image-source,

77
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.348
the slice, the width,
the outset, and the repeat.

78
00:05:44.348 --> 00:05:50.388
And that's for the,
border-image is actually the shorthand.

79
00:05:50.388 --> 00:05:54.817
Okay, so unlike background-image,
which is a longhand property,

80
00:05:54.817 --> 00:05:57.451
border-image is a shorthand property.

81
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:04.951
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: For it to work, you
actually have to have a border, cuz you

82
00:06:04.951 --> 00:06:10.396
have to have that width of that border to
say how wide you want your image to be.

83
00:06:12.815 --> 00:06:15.059
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Here I
have a really ugly image.

84
00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:27.671
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And I'm stretching it,
and I'm repeating it, and I'm rounding it.

85
00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:39.020
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And I think repeat or
stretch will look the best.

86
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.120
Okay, that looks good, so

87
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.200
I have a background image that
looks like a tiny version of this.

88
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.800
So why would I wanna use border-image?

89
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.789
Because I might want to use this
image 150,000 different sizes,

90
00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:57.402
but I always want those
corners to be the exact same.

91
00:06:57.402 --> 00:06:59.609
And then I like it to stretch in between.

92
00:06:59.609 --> 00:07:06.688
So that would be a use case of not making
150 different sizes of this image.

93
00:07:06.688 --> 00:07:11.486
I could also just put background-cover,
right, but if I take it and

94
00:07:11.486 --> 00:07:16.950
I make it background-cover and
I have something that's 500 pixels wide,

95
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.782
those corners on the edge are gonna
stretch, and I don't want that.

96
00:07:21.782 --> 00:07:26.380
So that would be a use case for
border-image.

97
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.531
So here I'm stretching it cuz it's
a gradient and I want it to look tall.

98
00:07:29.531 --> 00:07:33.775
If I repeated it in the middle,
I'm repeating that gradient,

99
00:07:33.775 --> 00:07:35.785
and that doesn't look good.

100
00:07:37.187 --> 00:07:40.782
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: If I was doing a stamp,
if I had a picture of a stamp,

101
00:07:40.782 --> 00:07:44.649
all I would have to do is do
one repetition of the stamp.

102
00:07:44.649 --> 00:07:47.652
And then I could actually make
that stamp repeat 100 times.

103
00:07:47.652 --> 00:07:51.633
Cuz you know how stamps go, they have
a straight edge, or they used to be,

104
00:07:51.633 --> 00:07:53.186
before they were stickers.

105
00:07:53.186 --> 00:07:56.148
Now I think they're just rectangular,
I'm not sure.

106
00:07:56.148 --> 00:08:01.137
Okay, so I have these properties,
basically the border-image-source

107
00:08:01.137 --> 00:08:05.661
is the first one I declare,
which is the gradient image that I used.

108
00:08:05.661 --> 00:08:09.160
The border-image-slice
is up to four values.

109
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.280
And I'm gonna show you in the next picture
a little bit better how it's explained.

110
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.828
And then I have a border-image-width,

111
00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:20.065
which is going to be basically the same
size as the width of my border.

112
00:08:23.197 --> 00:08:26.493
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then I repeat it,
round it, or stretch it, and

113
00:08:26.493 --> 00:08:28.960
I can't remember what the outset is.

114
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.344
Cuz I didn't use it,
I don't think I need it.

115
00:08:34.164 --> 00:08:35.437
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah, I didn't use it.

116
00:08:35.437 --> 00:08:37.956
Okay, so here we have a very long cat.

117
00:08:37.956 --> 00:08:45.786
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Right

118
00:08:45.786 --> 00:08:48.470
there is basically what the border is.

119
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:53.990
You see the border width
is 48 by 137 by 68 by 84.

120
00:08:53.990 --> 00:09:00.942
And in my border image, I repeat that as
48 137 68 84 without the pixel units.

121
00:09:00.942 --> 00:09:04.827
Then I can use the property
of fill to fill it or

122
00:09:04.827 --> 00:09:08.727
not fill it, and
my cat looks better filled.

123
00:09:15.323 --> 00:09:19.174
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
then I stretch it because if I repeat,

124
00:09:22.191 --> 00:09:23.624
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It looks really weird,

125
00:09:27.874 --> 00:09:29.768
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So I stretch it.

126
00:09:29.768 --> 00:09:34.528
So what I'd like you to do is just take
two minutes to change the border sizes to

127
00:09:34.528 --> 00:09:37.105
play with basically both these screens.

128
00:09:39.367 --> 00:09:41.559
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
you have a little bit of an understanding,

129
00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:43.994
this is actually the produced
syntax right here.

130
00:09:43.994 --> 00:09:50.766
So you can switch these,
and the URL is gradient.

131
00:09:50.766 --> 00:09:53.826
So let's see if I can find,
while you do that,

132
00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:56.349
I'm gonna find the URL of this image.

133
00:10:07.612 --> 00:10:10.149
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So you see,
I used the style here, right here, and

134
00:10:10.149 --> 00:10:12.040
I told you yesterday to not use style.

135
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.610
The reason I'm doing that is because
I'm actually doing sliders, and

136
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.576
I'm dynamically reloading the page, so
it's my JavaScript that's doing it.

137
00:10:20.576 --> 00:10:22.464
I would not do this in production,

138
00:10:22.464 --> 00:10:25.339
but this is an example just
to show you how to do this.

139
00:10:25.339 --> 00:10:28.017
There's so much bad and evil code,

140
00:10:28.017 --> 00:10:32.668
I'd say it's embarrassing,
but I don't get embarrassed.

141
00:10:32.668 --> 00:10:36.148
So this the original image
that we stretched, okay, so

142
00:10:36.148 --> 00:10:38.379
that's what you're stretching.

143
00:10:38.379 --> 00:10:42.951
What you wanna do is,
you wanna repeat this inner part, but

144
00:10:42.951 --> 00:10:47.354
you wanna maintain these
little corners on the outside.

145
00:10:47.354 --> 00:10:55.392
So how big does your gradient have to be?

146
00:10:55.392 --> 00:10:59.145
So let's actually go over here,

147
00:10:59.145 --> 00:11:03.710
whoops, and change this from longcat.

148
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.460
If you want to,
you don't have to, and do that.

149
00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:12.355
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
now I just have the four corners.

150
00:11:12.355 --> 00:11:17.190
Except for I really wanna have about

151
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:22.346
10px by 10px by 10px by 10px,

152
00:11:22.346 --> 00:11:25.580
is that enough, yeah.

153
00:11:27.522 --> 00:11:31.228
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then my old syntax,
cuz I have to look at things,

154
00:11:31.228 --> 00:11:37.326
cuz I don't know this by heart,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Is,

155
00:11:41.169 --> 00:11:43.214
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: No, stretch,

156
00:11:50.058 --> 00:11:52.324
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And okay, so

157
00:11:52.324 --> 00:11:58.093
let's just copy this over here.

158
00:12:03.402 --> 00:12:08.085
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I'm going to hit
Return over here cuz you can actually

159
00:12:08.085 --> 00:12:12.888
have things that are two lines long,
and just do this.

160
00:12:12.888 --> 00:12:15.983
So why does it not have
the stuff in the middle?

161
00:12:15.983 --> 00:12:17.548
Because I need to fill it.

162
00:12:20.443 --> 00:12:21.948
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
where do I put the fill?

163
00:12:23.995 --> 00:12:25.361
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Try to remember.

164
00:12:28.911 --> 00:12:30.982
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: After the image URL.

165
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:45.165
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There we go,
and let me do 30.

166
00:12:47.318 --> 00:12:51.218
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 30, I hope you're
playing along, cuz I don't have to come

167
00:12:51.218 --> 00:12:55.268
all the way to Minnesota to play
with this, I can do this at home.

168
00:12:55.268 --> 00:12:59.553
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, and

169
00:12:59.553 --> 00:13:04.936
width,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 60px.

170
00:13:06.404 --> 00:13:11.295
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Height,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 80px.

171
00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:18.224
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Box-sizing.

172
00:13:26.028 --> 00:13:31.548
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so
now it's 60 pixels by 80 pixels,

173
00:13:31.548 --> 00:13:35.827
why don't we make the width 160,

174
00:13:37.993 --> 00:13:42.623
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 40, and then just do 20,

175
00:13:42.623 --> 00:13:45.963
20, 20, 20.

176
00:13:45.963 --> 00:13:49.514
So you see how I can make that image,
and no matter what size I make it,

177
00:13:49.514 --> 00:13:50.629
it still looks ugly?

178
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:53.067
I mean, no matter what size I make it,

179
00:13:53.067 --> 00:13:56.898
it still looks like it was
the original image of the button.

180
00:13:56.898 --> 00:14:00.910
It doesn't look like I completely played
around with that and stretched it.

181
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:05.720
So that's border-image, one last thing
I want to cover on border-image,

182
00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:10.820
which I didn't cover before,
is how the border-image is placed.

183
00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.566
Basically, when you were defining
the widths of the borders,

184
00:14:14.566 --> 00:14:18.100
you were defining what was on the left,
what was on the top,

185
00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.079
what was on the right, and
what was on the bottom.

186
00:14:21.079 --> 00:14:25.826
And then you're replacing or
slicing the background,

187
00:14:25.826 --> 00:14:29.260
that border-image, into nine parts.

188
00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.964
The upper right-hand part was put
in the upper right-hand corner.

189
00:14:32.964 --> 00:14:35.826
The upper left-hand part was put
in the upper left-hand corner.

190
00:14:35.826 --> 00:14:38.443
The bottom right-hand part was put
in the bottom right-hand corner.

191
00:14:38.443 --> 00:14:40.728
And the bottom left-hand part was
put in the bottom left-hand corner.

192
00:14:40.728 --> 00:14:44.477
And then the rest of it was stretched or
repeated,

193
00:14:44.477 --> 00:14:49.041
so this is kind of like an image
to indicate what was going on.

194
00:14:49.041 --> 00:14:52.301
You're placing the four corners, so
when you have a background image,

195
00:14:52.301 --> 00:14:53.913
you kind of need to know what areas.

196
00:14:53.913 --> 00:14:57.538
You wanna maintain the exact
correct aspect ratio, and

197
00:14:57.538 --> 00:15:01.481
then what part you either wanna repeat or
you wanna stretch.
