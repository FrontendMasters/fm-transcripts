00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:07.351
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so we're going to
start off the day by looking at selectors.

2
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:10.641
I'm not gonna cover selectors yet.

3
00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:13.939
But I just want to show you that with CSS,

4
00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:18.514
you can target anything and
style it in any way you want.

5
00:00:18.514 --> 00:00:24.646
So here I've said every third list item,

6
00:00:24.646 --> 00:00:29.725
but we could also do font size 4m,

7
00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:34.454
and I could also change the color

8
00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:39.203
to red actually that is a green.

9
00:00:39.203 --> 00:00:44.829
So we're going to be looking
at changing it to plus one.

10
00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.571
So I just changed the item that was there.

11
00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:50.987
We're gonna be looking at the stuff
that's on the left hand side,

12
00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:55.562
which is the type first, and then we're
gonna spend the rest of the day looking at

13
00:00:55.562 --> 00:00:57.276
the stuff on the right hand side.

14
00:00:57.276 --> 00:01:01.538
So, basically,we are going
to be looking at first,

15
00:01:01.538 --> 00:01:05.054
at selectors and then the property values.

16
00:01:05.054 --> 00:01:08.418
Some of these, will be prefixed,

17
00:01:08.418 --> 00:01:13.646
generally you do not wanna
use prefixed properties.

18
00:01:13.646 --> 00:01:19.743
Mostly don't use prefixed properties,
but remove the moz-border radius and

19
00:01:19.743 --> 00:01:23.659
remove the webkit linear
gradient from your code.

20
00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.009
Old Android devices that don't, I mean
these are really old Android devices.

21
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.805
The reason a lot of CSS
properties stay prefixed,

22
00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:39.363
used to be because of the performance.

23
00:01:39.363 --> 00:01:43.971
And is still that is why a lot of the CSS
features don't come out that we really

24
00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:45.987
wanted because there is no way for

25
00:01:45.987 --> 00:01:49.025
the browser vendors to
make it perform it enough.

26
00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:53.489
If you use moz-border-radius,
well moz-border-radius is a bad example,

27
00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:58.288
if you use webkit-border-radius or
webkit radial-gradient, you're targeting

28
00:01:58.288 --> 00:02:02.165
the only device that needs that is
an old Android device, all right?

29
00:02:02.165 --> 00:02:06.328
And it's really slow to create
a gradient on an old Android device,

30
00:02:06.328 --> 00:02:10.505
it's really slow to create border
radiuses on old Android device.

31
00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:15.401
So just, if they need that prefixed,
that's probably on a slow device.

32
00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:20.192
So just for the most part cut out,
though there are some experimental

33
00:02:20.192 --> 00:02:24.585
features that basically they
haven't finished the spec yet.

34
00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:27.843
You shouldn't use those because then
you're not hitting every single browser.

35
00:02:27.843 --> 00:02:29.651
But there's sometimes
where they're just so

36
00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:32.164
awesome that you wanna use them
anyways before they're ready.

37
00:02:32.164 --> 00:02:37.828
So we'll cover some of those,
we'll cover some at rules,

38
00:02:37.828 --> 00:02:43.733
we'll cover some tools,
what are tools for generating CSS?

39
00:02:43.733 --> 00:02:50.341
I use a sublime for creating it.

40
00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:54.919
And then I also use SASS
as a pre-processor, but

41
00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:58.389
all you really need is a text editor.

42
00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.478
You don't need any fancy tools.

43
00:03:01.478 --> 00:03:03.038
There's some what you see is what you get.

44
00:03:03.038 --> 00:03:07.996
There's Dreamweaver, Aloha editor,
there's these I've never heard of

45
00:03:07.996 --> 00:03:12.423
these other than when I did a search so
I could put other examples up.

46
00:03:12.423 --> 00:03:16.410
Some people make fun of
people who use Dreamweaver,

47
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.399
I haven't used, or even looked at
it in about four or five years.

48
00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:26.147
But it actually was a really good tool,
and it created nice clean, and

49
00:03:26.147 --> 00:03:30.187
it might still create nice
clean HTML within external CSS.

50
00:03:30.187 --> 00:03:32.362
It's not the tools that are the problem,

51
00:03:32.362 --> 00:03:35.296
it's the way people use
the tools that are the problem.

52
00:03:35.296 --> 00:03:37.424
Other than Frontpage,
Frontpage was just a problem.

53
00:03:39.487 --> 00:03:44.303
When an editor puts all of the stuff in
for you, when you don't want it to and

54
00:03:44.303 --> 00:03:49.978
it's basically making all these decisions
and putting stuff in-line, that's bad.

55
00:03:49.978 --> 00:03:54.491
As long as you're controlling the tool and
not letting the tool control you.

56
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:58.422
Similarly with preprocessors and
postprocessors,

57
00:03:58.422 --> 00:04:02.972
They can be very powerful but
they can also be very dangerous.

58
00:04:02.972 --> 00:04:07.852
So, oops, so postprocessors,
I'm not gonna actually

59
00:04:07.852 --> 00:04:12.944
cover any postprocessors because,
I've never used any.

60
00:04:12.944 --> 00:04:16.604
Because hopefully I will provide you
with enough information today and

61
00:04:16.604 --> 00:04:19.959
tomorrow that you won't actually
need to postprocess your CSS,

62
00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.219
you'll actually know how to write the CSS.

63
00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:26.615
Anyway, I do use preprocessor because
I like it organize my CSS and

64
00:04:26.615 --> 00:04:28.274
I will cover that later.

65
00:04:28.274 --> 00:04:32.980
Will also cover debugging,
there is no separate section on debugging.

66
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.034
I'm going to be talking
about debugging and

67
00:04:36.034 --> 00:04:39.674
you'll see me debug
throughout the whole process.

68
00:04:39.674 --> 00:04:43.467
This are some of the different
ways of debugging,

69
00:04:43.467 --> 00:04:48.611
I am using Chrome at this moment,
so my debugging will be in Chrome,

70
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:52.973
we're going to go over to
Firefox a little bit tomorrow.

71
00:04:52.973 --> 00:04:56.023
There's tools in every browser and so,

72
00:04:56.023 --> 00:05:02.047
we're not gonna do a separate section on
it, but will be throughout the class.

73
00:05:02.047 --> 00:05:07.254
Some really cool tool is CSS,
well there's lots of really

74
00:05:07.254 --> 00:05:11.951
cool tools,
one of the ones I like is Font Squirrel.

75
00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:15.681
I use them, but remember that you
should be controlling your CSS and

76
00:05:15.681 --> 00:05:17.587
not letting your CSS control you.

77
00:05:17.587 --> 00:05:20.622
So when you use a tool
understand what it's doing.

78
00:05:20.622 --> 00:05:25.212
And so my goal today is to provide you
with enough information that when a tool

79
00:05:25.212 --> 00:05:30.162
creates some output, you can read that
output and know exactly what it's doing,

80
00:05:30.162 --> 00:05:35.063
and remove the 140,000 lines that it
added that you didn't really need.

81
00:05:35.063 --> 00:05:39.956
And you think I'm exaggerating,
but I've seen that.

82
00:05:39.956 --> 00:05:46.845
There's a lot of other
development tools like CodePen,

83
00:05:46.845 --> 00:05:54.307
I'm using a few CodePen throughout
the two days of workshop,

84
00:05:54.307 --> 00:05:58.769
but I'm mostly using in header CSS.

85
00:05:58.769 --> 00:06:02.981
But I think it's a great
tool to test stuff out when

86
00:06:02.981 --> 00:06:07.778
you don't have Estelle to 
prepare the page for you.
