00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:04.772
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So captions,

2
00:00:04.772 --> 00:00:10.800
a caption basically specifies
what the title is of the table.

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.040
It should be descriptive enough to
indicate to a user what's involved.

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.690
It is always the first child at the table,
you don't always need to include one, but

5
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.840
it improves accessibility and
there's certain things you can do with it.

6
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.920
You can position it either on the top or
on the bottom with caption side, and

7
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.090
in Firefox you can actually position
it on the left or on the right.

8
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.190
You can style it, and it does inherit
properties from the table element.

9
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.110
It is nested within the table and
will inherit.

10
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.810
So supported in all browsers is caption
slide top, and caption slide bottom.

11
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.170
And then experimental,
which is supported in Firefox,

12
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.660
is caption side left, right,
top outside, and bottom outside.

13
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.090
And basically the outside means
the caption will fit into the same width

14
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.510
as the table.

15
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.610
But if you would say outside it wont
wrap it it will actually continue.

16
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.170
And then in the specification
is inline start and inline end.

17
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.570
And deprecated is the actual attribute
on the table which would be a line,

18
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.300
left top right and bottom, which is
actually has nothing to do with caption

19
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.010
side, it has to do with the table itself.

20
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.162
Okay, so here is my caption right here on

21
00:01:26.162 --> 00:01:32.437
the bottom.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

22
00:01:32.437 --> 00:01:39.249
the default is top.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Or I can do bottom.

23
00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:41.780
That's exciting.

24
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.531
If you wanna open it up in a Firefox,
you can play with the other values.

25
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.560
So, here I declare the caption because
a caption is an element, right?

26
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.100
And you can style it.

27
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.818
You can style it like you
would any other element,

28
00:01:57.818 --> 00:02:01.960
font, weight.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Bold.

29
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.830
Padding, 40 pixels.

30
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.480
Right, you can just basically
style it like anything.

31
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.380
The thing to note basically is caption
side goes underneath the table.

32
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.215
And let's say I got rid of the color here
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: I had put it up here,

33
00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:24.800
it would make the whole thing red.

34
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.120
So it's inheriting properties
that are normally inherited.

35
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.730
So that's the caption and
you learned HTML.

36
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.500
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Student: If I wanted to

37
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.440
display the caption for
accessibility purposes.

38
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.960
But I didn't want it to actually display
visually, could I do display none or

39
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.432
would that take it out of both contexts?
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Display none would,

40
00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:49.010
screen readers do not read
anything that's display

41
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.690
none.
&gt;&gt; Student: Okay.

42
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.250
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: But you could clip it so

43
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.490
that it takes one pixel, you could
position it absolutely, I assume.

44
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.828
So let's try positioning it absolutely

45
00:03:05.213 --> 00:03:09.780
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's gone.

46
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.496
The screen reader will still read that.
