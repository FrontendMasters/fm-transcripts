00:00:03.214 --> 00:00:07.069
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So, here,
I have a more complicated grid.

2
00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.374
And it says,
grid-template-column: repeat twice,

3
00:00:13.374 --> 00:00:17.586
2 frs, then repeat 3 times, 1 fr.

4
00:00:17.586 --> 00:00:20.461
So, column three, four and five,
are half the width of one and two.

5
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:23.534
And column six is 3frs.

6
00:00:23.534 --> 00:00:29.980
And then grid template row,
the first one is 2frs,

7
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.238
and then the second one is 125.

8
00:00:34.238 --> 00:00:37.938
These are both 4 ems, and
these are not declared.

9
00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:44.259
So why is row number one, so tiny?

10
00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:45.311
Anyone have a guess?

11
00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:48.194
I had no free space.

12
00:00:48.194 --> 00:00:53.181
So it made it fr is basically zero.

13
00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:59.909
I could have made this, but
these list lines aren't actually declared.

14
00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.381
I could have actually said 6fr.

15
00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:14.980
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So you have 2fr,
125, 4em, 4em, and 6fr.

16
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.049
So my fr was basically tiny,
it was a few pixels.

17
00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.687
It's the free space, that's right there.

18
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:25.769
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So, like 2 pixels.

19
00:01:29.247 --> 00:01:29.747
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's make it 5.

20
00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:36.584
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 4,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 3,

21
00:01:36.584 --> 00:01:41.019
doesn't look very good when I do that so
I should make it, okay.

22
00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:46.128
Okay, so
fr is the term is actually fraction unit.

23
00:01:46.128 --> 00:01:49.315
And it just describes a fraction
of the available space.

24
00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:54.463
So that's that extra space within
the height in that case, or

25
00:01:54.463 --> 00:02:00.902
the width that can be divided equally,
based on how much space is available.

26
00:02:00.902 --> 00:02:05.731
And then the repeat, I think, you have a
good understanding of what the repeat is.

27
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:10.645
So let's go back here, and
I'm going to give you 2 minutes to

28
00:02:10.645 --> 00:02:15.099
just play with it and
write your own widths and heights.

29
00:02:26.154 --> 00:02:28.670
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
the thing is keep playing with it, but

30
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.630
grid template columns and
grid template rows,

31
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.662
that's one of those things that you're
never gonna remember how to write that,

32
00:02:36.662 --> 00:02:40.075
but at least now you know what it is so
you can look it up.

33
00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:42.561
I still look it up every single time.

34
00:02:46.953 --> 00:02:50.932
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That's why I kept copying
and pasting it, cuz I'm kinda like,

35
00:02:50.932 --> 00:02:52.119
it doesn't work.

36
00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:58.556
The other thing that's really important,
is the fact that you can mix the unit.

37
00:02:58.556 --> 00:03:02.685
So if you want your aside
to be 200 pixels, and

38
00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:06.915
your nav on the other side
to be 200 pixels, and

39
00:03:06.915 --> 00:03:11.748
the thing in the middle to be
whatever size it needs to be,

40
00:03:11.748 --> 00:03:15.098
you can say a min of something and 1 fr.

41
00:03:15.098 --> 00:03:19.284
So basically take up all the free
space but at least something wide.

42
00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:43.148
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So here, I actually
added, we're gonna cover this in a second.

43
00:03:43.148 --> 00:03:47.618
I added the min and
max for the last column.

44
00:04:40.101 --> 00:04:43.794
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And here, what I did
is I made it wider than the window.

45
00:04:43.794 --> 00:04:48.044
I basically said,
I want the first two to be 200 pixels,

46
00:04:48.044 --> 00:04:53.654
this next three to be 150 pixels,
then that just didn't fit on the screen.

47
00:04:53.654 --> 00:04:58.825
And then the last one either to be
a minimum or maximum of 10 pixels.

48
00:04:58.825 --> 00:05:00.375
So it's gonna be of minimum of 10 pixels.

49
00:05:00.375 --> 00:05:06.184
But I could say a minimum of 100 pixels,
and a maximum of 1fr.

50
00:05:06.184 --> 00:05:09.054
And if I don't have any fr units, right?

51
00:05:09.054 --> 00:05:13.006
Fr is 0, it's gonna make it a 100 pixels.

52
00:05:13.006 --> 00:05:14.559
Okay, so let's continue.

53
00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:20.841
So as you saw we've been using some
different units for those widths.

54
00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:24.745
Generally, we use the fr unit,
and the length of percentage.

55
00:05:24.745 --> 00:05:28.230
But you can say max-content,

56
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.131
which is in flex-box and
in grid, and everything.

57
00:05:34.131 --> 00:05:35.869
Your element has content in it.

58
00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:40.099
Right now, we just have the number 1,
so max-content and

59
00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.562
min-content, it's just tiny.

60
00:05:42.562 --> 00:05:47.867
But it could be relative to the content or
it can be minmax,

61
00:05:47.867 --> 00:05:55.145
which is the size between the min, if max
is less then min, then max is ignored.

62
00:05:55.145 --> 00:05:58.440
And minmax is treated as min.

63
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.882
Or it could be auto, and lets go and
add auto or it could be fit content.,

64
00:06:03.882 --> 00:06:10.154
which is basically a calculation of the
content, the length, or the percentage.

65
00:06:10.154 --> 00:06:15.307
So if we just do here,
auto, it basically says,

66
00:06:15.307 --> 00:06:18.867
I only need to be the size of the text.

67
00:06:18.867 --> 00:06:24.457
But if I do li:first-of-type,

68
00:06:24.457 --> 00:06:30.828
or I can just do first-child shorter.

69
00:06:30.828 --> 00:06:33.346
And I do before.

70
00:06:37.632 --> 00:06:38.132
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Content.

71
00:06:46.628 --> 00:06:49.429
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Auto became much bigger,
right?

72
00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:50.852
Because I have content in there.
