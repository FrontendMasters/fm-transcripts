00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.707
&gt;&gt; Estelle: I would like to just
add one feature to the grids

2
00:00:04.707 --> 00:00:07.853
that we talked about earlier.

3
00:00:07.853 --> 00:00:10.630
I did not show you the debugging tools.

4
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.250
So right now, I am in Firefox and

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.090
hopefully I can make the debugger bigger.

6
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.258
I cannot, usually you go in here and

7
00:00:22.258 --> 00:00:27.549
you just make it bigger and
that's making the page bigger.

8
00:00:27.549 --> 00:00:32.566
And in the Firefox developer tools,
if you actually pick

9
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:37.700
the element where the grid is,
which is our ordered list.

10
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.437
And you go down here to where you say,
display grid.

11
00:00:42.437 --> 00:00:47.201
There's this icon right here and
you can click it and

12
00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:50.132
it'll show you the grid lines.

13
00:00:50.132 --> 00:00:57.780
So Firefox actually has some pretty neat,
debugging tools.

14
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.170
And there's features like dragging and

15
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.920
stuff like that which I
didn't want to go in to.

16
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.592
But I just wanted to show you that in
the debugging tools there's actually

17
00:01:06.592 --> 00:01:12.829
ways of looking at your grid and playing
around with it, so that's it for grids.
