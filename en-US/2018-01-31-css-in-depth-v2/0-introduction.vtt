00:00:02.983 --> 00:00:07.995
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So for
everyone the slides are going

2
00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:14.351
to be at estell.github.io/cssmastery.

3
00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:17.278
So let me just go to the first deck, and

4
00:00:17.278 --> 00:00:22.124
here is the link right there.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

5
00:00:22.124 --> 00:00:29.310
this talk has a few names, CSS for
Novice to Ninja, CSS in Depth Version 2.

6
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.661
I've kind of changed the name to CSS
Mastery, I don't know what it says online.

7
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:38.060
I'd like to talk a little about
myself before I get started.

8
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.983
My name is Estelle Weyl,
I tweet at the handle

9
00:00:42.983 --> 00:00:48.200
estellevw, my blog is at standardista.com.

10
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.050
It says early release, but
the book has been released.

11
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.410
I co-authored this.

12
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.470
Erik Meyer is,
he's not the godfather of CSS

13
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.160
because godfather to me reminds me of
the movie, and he hasn't murdered anyone.

14
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.110
He's more of the Oprah, trying to
encourage and share knowledge, so

15
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.390
he's the Oprah of CSS.

16
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.270
So this is available if you wanna read it,
if you need

17
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.590
a seat for your kid to be able to reach
the table, if you need a door stop.

18
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.530
And it is not actually the definitive
guide, there is stuff we were not able to

19
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.770
reach but we had a book that
you could actually open.

20
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.967
Okay, so in this deck that you've seen
just now with the snowflakes, and

21
00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:41.120
the snowman, or snow person,
we have used lot of CSS properties.

22
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.720
There's selectors, I selected
the snow flakes to make the drop.

23
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.009
There's linear gradients,

24
00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.510
it goes from blue to white because
it always snows when it's sunny out.

25
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.680
There's opacity, some of the snowflakes
were darker than the others.

26
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.170
There's RGBA colors,
a as in alpa transparency.

27
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.860
I used border radius,
those snowflakes were round.

28
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:13.340
I used transforms, they spun.

29
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.710
And I used transitions and animations.

30
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:24.610
And I used a text shadow in the deck, this
has text shadow, a few of them actually.

31
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.343
And I actually removed the fonts, so I'm
not using any special fonts in this deck.

32
00:02:31.343 --> 00:02:35.894
And in fact that snowman
right there is one element,

33
00:02:35.894 --> 00:02:39.590
it's a div, and that is not an image.

34
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.831
It is done with, it is an image,

35
00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:46.068
it's done with CSS images,
I did not pull in anything else.

36
00:02:46.068 --> 00:02:47.740
And I'll cover that a little bit.
