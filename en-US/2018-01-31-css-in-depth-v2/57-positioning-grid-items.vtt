00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.238
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So let's go on to
the next feature which is placement,

2
00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:06.200
placing the grid item.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.120
So earlier, I talked about the grid
lines and the grid lines are in red and

4
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.940
the grid items are in blue.

5
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.830
So if you see, I have a three by three
grid but I have four grid lines.

6
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.450
One, two, three and four, across and down.

7
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.830
So when I place an item I say, basically,
at which grid line does it start and

8
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.990
it which grid line does it end, both in
the direction of the row and the column?

9
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.020
So I have four properties for that or
several even more than four properties.

10
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.225
I can say my item,
grid rows start at two, so

11
00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:47.089
it starts at the second line and
it ends at the fourth row grid line.

12
00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.705
And it starts at the column start
of the second grid line which is

13
00:00:51.705 --> 00:00:54.416
right in front of the second column.

14
00:00:54.416 --> 00:01:01.090
And it ends at the fifth column line
which is after the fourth column.

15
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.001
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: There's actually
shorthand for grid-row-start and

16
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:08.169
grid-row-end, which is just grid-row.

17
00:01:08.169 --> 00:01:11.888
So you put the number and
then you put a slash.

18
00:01:11.888 --> 00:01:16.649
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then, there's also
a shorthand for grid-column-start and

19
00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.904
grid-column-end, which is
just grid-column 2 / 5.

20
00:01:20.904 --> 00:01:28.410
So the grid-column start,
slash grid-column end.

21
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.050
And then I could do short hand,
and basically say, grid row start,

22
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.880
grid column start,
grid row end, grid column end.

23
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.220
And I hope you all memorized that.

24
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.485
It's a little bit complex, but
just remember, go start start, end end.

25
00:01:47.485 --> 00:01:51.552
So let's play with this right away.

26
00:01:51.552 --> 00:01:56.718
Here I have grid row start at two,
grid row end at four.

27
00:01:56.718 --> 00:02:01.020
So it's starting at the second line.

28
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.590
Third line, fourth line, so
it's good from 2 to 4, so

29
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.930
those are the rows that it goes through.

30
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.870
And then it says which
columns is it going through?

31
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.630
It's starting at the second column line,
and it goes to the fifth.

32
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.885
I could do,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

33
00:02:20.885 --> 00:02:26.226
that's the exact same thing, right?

34
00:02:26.226 --> 00:02:31.033
And I could do grid column to five, and

35
00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:34.194
that's the same thing.

36
00:02:34.194 --> 00:02:39.122
Now if I wanna do just grid

37
00:02:39.122 --> 00:02:46.470
area,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That's not what we want.

38
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.966
We actually want two and five and

39
00:02:49.966 --> 00:02:54.790
that brings it back to the same thing.

40
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.803
Because it was, it's grid,

41
00:02:59.803 --> 00:03:06.422
row, start, grid-column-start,

42
00:03:06.422 --> 00:03:13.449
grid-row-end, grid-column-end.
