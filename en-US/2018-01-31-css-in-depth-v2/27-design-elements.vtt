00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:03.860
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So, we talk
a little bit about design elements,

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.784
let's go back to it.

3
00:00:04.784 --> 00:00:06.591
So, here's another thought bubble.

4
00:00:06.591 --> 00:00:09.399
So the first thought bubble
was with the triangle,

5
00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:12.804
this thought bubble is using
border radius and positioning.

6
00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:20.490
So it's basically putting a 50%
border radius on the thought bubble.

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.470
And then it's creating
two circles before and

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.120
after, which just basically
have two different sizes.

9
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.766
One has a height and width of 40, the
other one has a height and width of 20, so

10
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.625
one is half the size of the other one,
border radius of 50%.

11
00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:35.520
And then I position them absolutely to
make it look like a thought bubble.

12
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.067
Is this okay to use?

13
00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:43.107
Yes, there is no significant
information to the screen

14
00:00:43.107 --> 00:00:50.306
reader that the screen reader would need
to know though the text is still there.

15
00:00:50.306 --> 00:00:55.363
If this was really important,
like in a comic, its roosters would

16
00:00:55.363 --> 00:01:00.440
say that the guys or the character
said it, not that he thought it.

17
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.212
But you could actually add accessibility
features to say that it was

18
00:01:05.212 --> 00:01:06.558
a thought and not.

19
00:01:06.558 --> 00:01:12.511
Then Chris Coyier put out this neat
little blog, and it is The Shapes of CSS.

20
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:17.705
And he used generated to content
to create all of these shapes.

21
00:01:17.705 --> 00:01:20.495
These are just one element
with generated content and

22
00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:22.110
you can do all sorts of things.

23
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.075
I'm going through it quickly because it's
just to show you that it's possible.

24
00:01:28.075 --> 00:01:33.995
How was yin yang done before and
after, that is really impressive.

25
00:01:33.995 --> 00:01:34.495
Isn't that pretty awesome?

26
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.887
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, and then some
more thoughts of what you could do.

27
00:01:42.887 --> 00:01:46.416
The shapes article was included,

28
00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:51.170
the printing of the URLs,
remember that one?

29
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.151
Clearing floats, that we don't need to do
anymore pretty soon because I'm gonna show

30
00:01:55.151 --> 00:01:56.199
you Flex box and Grid.

31
00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:00.975
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Samurai, I think it was,

32
00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:03.611
made all of these icons
out of generated content.

33
00:02:05.788 --> 00:02:08.271
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Remember
when we were talking about,

34
00:02:08.271 --> 00:02:10.608
let me see if I can make this bigger?

35
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.019
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so here is an idea
of adding based on attributes and

36
00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.897
the size of the screen, adding features.

37
00:02:21.897 --> 00:02:25.079
So on a large monitor
when you see an email you

38
00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.470
get the email printed afterwards and
the email icon before.

39
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.264
If it's a medium screen,
it's just the name and

40
00:02:32.264 --> 00:02:34.594
the email address printed afterwards.

41
00:02:34.594 --> 00:02:39.233
If it's a tablet, the word email comes
before, if it's smaller still, you get

42
00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:43.820
just the icon, and if it's even smaller,
you just get the link and that's it.

43
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.640
So it's basically saying,
what is the size of my screen?

44
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.264
Depending on the size of your screen,
add these features.

45
00:02:52.924 --> 00:02:57.133
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Let's see a few more,
ribbons.

46
00:03:00.336 --> 00:03:02.356
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Yeah, here's a ribbon.

47
00:03:02.356 --> 00:03:05.750
Okay, and here's the badass tooltip.

48
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.297
&gt;&gt; Group: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Which is

49
00:03:07.297 --> 00:03:09.545
kind of what we did earlier
with the Google thing.

50
00:03:11.727 --> 00:03:12.856
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay.

51
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:19.208
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So we're not gonna
do this, this is an example, but

52
00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:26.280
this is a very clear case of why you would
not wanna make this as position relative.

53
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.757
Because if this was position relative,
this word tool tip all the time,

54
00:03:29.757 --> 00:03:33.640
then I went over generated content, the
word tool tip would come right through.

55
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.320
We're going to take a five minute break,
now before we hit Media Queries.

56
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.445
So if you want to,
you can actually go hit this and

57
00:03:44.445 --> 00:03:47.827
try figuring out how to do this.
