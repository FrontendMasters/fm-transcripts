00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:05.573
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
let's take a look at perspective.

2
00:00:05.573 --> 00:00:10.402
There is two ways to declare perspective,
either you can declare it as the first

3
00:00:10.402 --> 00:00:13.803
value, the first function
of the transform property.

4
00:00:13.803 --> 00:00:16.483
If it is not the first,
it doesn't do anything.

5
00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:20.083
Okay, so you always want to start with
perspective if you are doing 3D transforms

6
00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:21.923
and you're going include perspective.

7
00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:30.275
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So perspective, you can
put the perspective property itself on

8
00:00:30.275 --> 00:00:32.942
an individual element or on the parent.

9
00:00:32.942 --> 00:00:36.649
And the difference between putting it
on an individual element versus on

10
00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.292
the parent is if you put it on the parent,
all of it's children will have

11
00:00:40.292 --> 00:00:43.590
the same perspective so
they'll all go out or whatever.

12
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.620
And if you put it on each individual one,
each will look the exact same.

13
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.830
I'll show you an example of that, I think.

14
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.900
So here, we have a perspective of 40.

15
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.790
We can also have a perspective of 400,
0r a 4.

16
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.187
And 4's gonna look crazy, whoops.

17
00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:08.274
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Right,
the smaller the number,

18
00:01:08.274 --> 00:01:12.788
it's basically this is 4
pixels from my eyeball.

19
00:01:12.788 --> 00:01:13.457
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Wow.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

20
00:01:13.457 --> 00:01:17.870
this is 40 pixels from my eyeball, and
this is 400 pixels from my eyeball.

21
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.351
And so if we rotate it 80 degrees,

22
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:31.621
and then we do 40,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's basically,

23
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:34.436
I have this piece of paper right
here that says RSVP on it.

24
00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.846
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So remember that the
prospective function must come first and

25
00:01:40.846 --> 00:01:44.972
that smaller numbers are basically closer
to you eye and will have a bigger impact.

26
00:01:47.677 --> 00:01:51.591
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So here,
I put the perspective on the parent.

27
00:01:53.837 --> 00:01:57.436
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And
it looks almost the same, right?

28
00:01:57.436 --> 00:02:00.497
Doesn't make much of a difference
when there's one, but

29
00:02:00.497 --> 00:02:03.378
you can really see it when
you have multiple elements.

30
00:02:03.378 --> 00:02:05.421
And here's that.

31
00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:10.531
You see, here, the perspective of
400 pixels is put on the child.

32
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:12.252
And these three look identical.

33
00:02:12.252 --> 00:02:16.898
Whereas here I put 400 pixels on
the parent's, and you're basically looking

34
00:02:16.898 --> 00:02:21.490
at it from here, and so it's all of them
are basically angling to the same point.

35
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.170
So you'll generally, if you have one
element, just put it on the child.

36
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.970
If you have multiple elements and
you're doing a city scene or

37
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.440
something like that,
put it on the parent of the whole thing.

38
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.070
Okay, next we're gonna
cover perspective origin.

39
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.899
So right now, we've been basically
staring at it dead center.

40
00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:43.636
Perspective-origin, you can
give it an x or a y and

41
00:02:43.636 --> 00:02:47.344
it's basically where the viewer
appears to be looking at the child.

42
00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.364
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
here I have two of them.

43
00:02:52.364 --> 00:02:56.251
I have a perspective from the top left and
perspective from the top right.

44
00:03:00.342 --> 00:03:02.681
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
each one of these has perspective of 100.

45
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:06.604
Let's make it 60,
to make it more obnoxious,

46
00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:10.730
let's make it 120, so
it's more reasonable.

47
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.817
So this is number one and
this is number two, I believe.

48
00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:20.040
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Top right?

49
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.795
Okay, yeah.

50
00:03:23.427 --> 00:03:30.082
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And this is center,
default is center, right, top right.

51
00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.768
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So
let's just look at this.

52
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.310
So one of them is top right and
the other one is just right.

53
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.048
Let's do center right.

54
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:48.690
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: It's not
that much of a difference.

55
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.650
You can play around with it until
you figure out what you like.

56
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.970
Just realize this is perspective-origin.

57
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.380
You can actually say,
I'm looking at it from here.

58
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.954
I'm looking at it from there.

59
00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:06.217
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Perspective origin
only works if the perspective is on

60
00:04:06.217 --> 00:04:07.139
the parents.

61
00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.214
Here it's on the child, and
it has no impact whatsoever.

62
00:04:09.214 --> 00:04:12.934
If you look at this in the previous one,
same thing.

63
00:04:12.934 --> 00:04:16.570
So here,
I'm looking at it from over to the right.

64
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.836
That's perspective-origin.

65
00:04:19.836 --> 00:04:24.571
Transform-origin is
something you're gonna use

66
00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:29.423
all the time and
it doesn't have to be a 3D element.

67
00:04:29.423 --> 00:04:32.639
So basically, it's where,
when you rotate something,

68
00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.840
rotating it right now by default
it's the center of that element.

69
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.930
But you can also make
it the upper corner or

70
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.988
you can make it somewhere completely else.

71
00:04:40.988 --> 00:04:46.220
Here the transform-origin property
is in the upper left hand corner,

72
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.545
it is rotating around
this mark right there.

73
00:04:49.545 --> 00:04:51.896
120, right?

74
00:04:51.896 --> 00:04:56.699
So no matter where I do it, that top
corner is always gonna be touching.

75
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.449
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Right,
you see how it's always touching?

76
00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.704
320, it's always touching.

77
00:05:10.704 --> 00:05:13.432
Now let's do bottom,

78
00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.593
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Whoop, bottom right.

79
00:05:20.593 --> 00:05:22.573
So this corner right
here is always touching.

80
00:05:22.573 --> 00:05:25.908
It looks like it's not touching cuz
these shadows are overlapping, but

81
00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:28.325
that little corner right there,
it's on top of it.

82
00:05:28.325 --> 00:05:33.023
So 120,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 220,

83
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.857
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: 320 and then 420,

84
00:05:36.857 --> 00:05:38.870
cuz 420 is a cool number.
