00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.419
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So we've had the,
let's go back to here.

2
00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:10.584
We tried the first child, the last child,
the first-of-type, the last-of-type,

3
00:00:10.584 --> 00:00:12.371
only-child, and only-of-type.

4
00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:15.758
But you can be more specific,

5
00:00:15.758 --> 00:00:21.176
you can say the third,
you can say every third,

6
00:00:21.176 --> 00:00:26.613
so 1, 4, 7, 10, or 2, 5, 8, 11.

7
00:00:26.613 --> 00:00:30.064
You can say there's two key terms,
there's odd and even.

8
00:00:30.064 --> 00:00:34.553
But otherwise,
it's an equation that is an+b.

9
00:00:34.553 --> 00:00:39.757
The b being the offset, and
the offset can be negative,

10
00:00:39.757 --> 00:00:44.180
and the an,
the n is actually the letter n.

11
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.580
The a is the variable, and it's basically
how many times do you, it is an interval.

12
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.138
It's an interval of 3 if we put 3n, but

13
00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:55.387
it's somewhat like the incrementer,
whatever.

14
00:00:55.387 --> 00:01:00.737
So the letter n is the thing that is, it's
not required, because if you leave out,

15
00:01:00.737 --> 00:01:04.574
here, we left it out, and so
it's just the fifth element.

16
00:01:04.574 --> 00:01:08.699
Right, but if you're going to iterate,
then it is the letter n,

17
00:01:08.699 --> 00:01:10.502
and there can't be a space.

18
00:01:10.502 --> 00:01:17.070
This is wrong, this will not work, that
works, okay, so the equation is, an+b.

19
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.916
Which b is the first value where you start
counting, so it could be negative 7.

20
00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:28.140
And if the incrementer was 3, so it was
3n- 7, well there's no negative 4 and

21
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.804
there's no negative 1, so
it'd really start with 2.

22
00:01:31.804 --> 00:01:36.113
But, if you had b being 12,
so it was 3n + 12,

23
00:01:36.113 --> 00:01:40.726
the first item to be targeted
would be number 12, and

24
00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:45.638
then it would be number 15,
number 18, number 21,

25
00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:50.856
so.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Left off

26
00:01:50.856 --> 00:01:55.876
the CSS for this one, okay, so let's,

27
00:02:03.943 --> 00:02:04.755
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so

28
00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:06.784
before we add Flexbox,

29
00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:10.246
let me see if I can,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Make

30
00:02:10.246 --> 00:02:15.003
the Flexbox,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Then

31
00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:19.009
we'll go like that.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Okay, so I'm just gonna

32
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:22.989
go to these two slides until we can catch
up, cuz there's a typo in the slides.

33
00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.315
Okay, so
here we have structural selectors,

34
00:02:26.315 --> 00:02:30.423
and the first-child and
the last-child are both bold.

35
00:02:30.423 --> 00:02:33.831
So what number, we have 10,
what number is the first and the last?

36
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:38.320
1 and 10, so 1 and 10 are both bold.

37
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.021
Then we have the first-of-type and
the last-of-type.

38
00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:46.777
Because we only have
the only thing that can be

39
00:02:46.777 --> 00:02:52.418
a descendant of an ordered or
unordered list is an li.

40
00:02:52.418 --> 00:02:54.660
So it matches the first-child and
the last-child.

41
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.184
But it could have been,
if we had done paragraphs in h1,

42
00:02:57.184 --> 00:02:58.561
it would have been different.

43
00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:03.482
Then we have nth-child(even),
background-color gray.

44
00:03:03.482 --> 00:03:08.958
And so you'll notice that 2, 4, 6, 8 and
10 have a background color of gray.

45
00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:15.066
And then it says nth-child(3),
so just the third one,

46
00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:19.978
make it gray
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: As in the color, and so

47
00:03:19.978 --> 00:03:25.815
you'll see all of them are black or
blue, except for number 3 is gray.

48
00:03:25.815 --> 00:03:30.395
And then, it says nth-of-type(odd),
made it white.

49
00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:33.670
Which just made it stripe,
I could have made it a different color.

50
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.275
And then nth-of-type(4n),
so that means every fourth.

51
00:03:37.275 --> 00:03:42.933
So it's number 4, number 8,
if we had continued, it'd been number 12,

52
00:03:42.933 --> 00:03:47.240
number 16, number 20,
number 24, so that's 4n.

53
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.141
And then the last equation says 3n-1, so

54
00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:55.894
we start with n being 0.

55
00:03:55.894 --> 00:03:58.460
And 3n- 1 is negative 1,
so that doesn't count.

56
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.403
Then we say, if n was 1,
it would be 3 times 1 is 3, minus 1 is 2.

57
00:04:04.403 --> 00:04:11.196
And then if n was 2, it would be 2
times 3, which is 6, minus 1 is 5.

58
00:04:11.196 --> 00:04:13.275
Who said you didn't need to know math,

59
00:04:13.275 --> 00:04:14.152
right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

60
00:04:14.152 --> 00:04:15.646
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So we have number 2,

61
00:04:15.646 --> 00:04:20.875
number 5, number 8, and it would
have also continued onto number 11,

62
00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:26.540
and would have continued ad infinitum,
of making those aligned right.

63
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.722
Do people understand
the equation of an + b,

64
00:04:29.722 --> 00:04:35.769
okay.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So before we had Flexbox,

65
00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:40.600
you could do stupid pet tricks like this.

66
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.416
Which is, you could say,
the element that is the only of its type,

67
00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:47.491
give it a width of 100%.

68
00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:52.479
If you have two elements, so
the first element would be

69
00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.029
the first of its type,
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And

70
00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:00.126
nth-last-of-type, starting from the end.

71
00:05:00.126 --> 00:05:05.846
So here I'm showing you last-of-type,
we have not started from the end before.

72
00:05:05.846 --> 00:05:11.251
So nth-last-of-type, so start at the end,
and then do the equation.

73
00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:15.175
So an element that is both
the first of its type and

74
00:05:15.175 --> 00:05:20.175
the second from the end means
there's exactly two elements.

75
00:05:20.175 --> 00:05:26.825
This next line says nth-of-type(2), which
means it's the second element, right, and

76
00:05:26.825 --> 00:05:32.756
it is also the last of its type, right.
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: That

77
00:05:32.756 --> 00:05:36.733
means there's exactly two, but it's
the second one, so bake those both 50%.

78
00:05:36.733 --> 00:05:39.706
And then going onto the fourth one,
it says

79
00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:46.058
nth-of-type(1):nth-last-of-type(4).
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So

80
00:05:46.058 --> 00:05:50.940
it's basically something that is
the first one and fourth from the end,

81
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.720
which means it's exactly 4,
right, make it 25%.

82
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.690
So this is what we could
do before we had Flexbox.

83
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.160
But later on today,
we're gonna cover Flexbox, so

84
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.360
we don't need to use
these stupid pet tricks.

85
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.358
But I just did wanna show you that
you can put two things together,

86
00:06:08.358 --> 00:06:12.301
you can string selectors along like that.

87
00:06:12.301 --> 00:06:19.507
Okay, so
I believe we are back to here, yes.

88
00:06:19.507 --> 00:06:25.180
So here, feel free to take two minutes or
three minutes,

89
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.681
let's do three minutes, to play with this.
