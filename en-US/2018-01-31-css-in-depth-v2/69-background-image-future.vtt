00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.110
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So here are kind of the
examples I showed on the previous page.

2
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.618
And then I just added this
little one thing right here.

3
00:00:10.618 --> 00:00:18.360
Which is, this was working in Firefox.

4
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.630
And it's basically saying url,
sprite, PNG, and

5
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.400
then just show this one
little area of that image.

6
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.890
But the thing is, browsers they would
who just don't understand that,

7
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.140
would just not use that hash at the end,
right, they would just show the whole,

8
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.610
which is not the best use case because
then you'd be showing the whole sprite.

9
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.570
But it might be a use case if you just
wanna shrink it just a little bit

10
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.550
then that might be good.

11
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.340
So because of this issue,

12
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.510
in this case that this media
fragment will not break anything.

13
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.020
It will just be ignored in
browser that don't support it.

14
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.220
But this would be nicer because you could,
as you say, background image, and

15
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.330
then do URL, and then the full image, and
then the next would say background image,

16
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.540
image, and then do just
the fragment that you wanna show.

17
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.690
And then that would be
more backward compatible.

18
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.533
Okay, so that's it for URL values.

19
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:19.970
And media fragments, yes?

20
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.010
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I was gonna say I turned off
the warnings about nonsecured content and

21
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.550
that started working on my browser.

22
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.890
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: Did I forget to HTTPS it?

23
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.050
Yeah, which one?

24
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right over there, yeah.

25
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.770
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This one?

26
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.770
Okay, thank you.

27
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.356
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No problem.

28
00:01:37.356 --> 00:01:39.033
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You're awesome, okay.

29
00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:41.619
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: So media fragments.

30
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.412
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: This is kind of
not really the best can I use,

31
00:01:47.412 --> 00:01:52.090
because this is media fragments for
the timing on video and audio clips.

32
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.350
You know how it can just show
starting at 22 seconds on a video?

33
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.410
That's pretty well supported.

34
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.540
Hopefully, we will get it on images soon.

35
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.210
Okay.

36
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.110
So a little bit of, remember when I
said it was supported in Firefox?

37
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.642
So it's actually supported
with -moz-element right now,

38
00:02:17.642 --> 00:02:19.730
it's now just supported outright.

39
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.000
Which was picking,

40
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.500
the element is basically giving
an element somewhere in the dom.

41
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.490
It doesn't have to be visible on the page.

42
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.770
And then referencing the idea of
that image, whether it's a canvas,

43
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.550
an SVG, or anything, and
say use that ID as a background.

44
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.730
And you can actually put a whole,
be really meta, put an ID

45
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.880
on your body, and then take the body and
put it as a background image, of its body.

46
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.750
It would be stupid, but you could do that.

47
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.707
But if you want to do it,
you'd have to do it with -moz-element.

48
00:02:57.707 --> 00:03:01.109
And then this thing right here,
when I was saying the image and

49
00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.330
you could actually just put a section
of it with the media fragment.

50
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.780
It is working in Mozilla
with -moz-image-rect.

51
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:17.237
So it's not just image,
it's image-rect [INAUDIBLE].

52
00:03:19.278 --> 00:03:23.415
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: And then, future,
hopefully this will come in some time,

53
00:03:23.415 --> 00:03:28.310
are these two features,
they're not at all supported yet.

54
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.410
Which is saying that first and
the second image and third image and

55
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.920
if none of those works make it blue.

56
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.130
Or background image saying use this
in a right to left language and

57
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.510
then this other image in
a left to right angle.

58
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.520
But what we can do instead
of doing this right now?

59
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.471
&gt;&gt; Estelle Weyl: You could
actually use the DR, DIR or

60
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:59.700
the lang attribute and
find out and put it based on that.

61
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.490
So those attribute selectors that
we learned yesterday, super useful.

62
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:06.430
Okay.

63
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.690
These are just more examples.

64
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.190
Nothing more to see here.
