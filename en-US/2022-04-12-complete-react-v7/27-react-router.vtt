1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.980
So, we're gonna talk about React Router.

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.368
So in various permutations of this class,
I've taught various versions of

3
00:00:07.368 --> 00:00:11.684
React Router as well as Reach Router
which was written by the same person but

4
00:00:11.684 --> 00:00:14.310
then they merged back into React Router.

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.140
If that sounds confusing,
it's because it's very confusing.

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.341
I do really like React router that's why
I continue to teach it the thing that I

7
00:00:21.341 --> 00:00:25.673
find frustrating about React router is
that it feels like every major version is

8
00:00:25.673 --> 00:00:28.480
a wild rewrite of the entire library.

9
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.900
So I'm just I'm forewarning you here that
if you choose to build React Router into

10
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.976
your website,
there's a decent chance that V7, V8,

11
00:00:35.976 --> 00:00:39.522
V9 of this will be while they're
different in the previous one.

12
00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:43.613
Most of the libraries maintain some
semblance and backwards compatibility, and

13
00:00:43.613 --> 00:00:46.160
that is not their strong
suit over React Router.

14
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.602
But it is the best one,
objectively, it's very fast,

15
00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:55.090
it's very nice to use and they're
re-writing it to make it much better.

16
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.302
So I'll let you decide on that.

17
00:00:59.302 --> 00:01:04.018
Now and React router is written
by the same people that do remix

18
00:01:04.018 --> 00:01:08.930
right remix.run so yeah they
are they are very good at routers.

19
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.836
I know Ryan I think Michael as
well the two authors I also did

20
00:01:12.836 --> 00:01:17.650
Ember Router way back in the day,
like before React was even out.

21
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.154
So they've been working on routers for
like a decade now.

22
00:01:21.796 --> 00:01:24.840
So, it is by far the most
popular one in the community.

23
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.850
It's the one I'm gonna
show you how to use today.

24
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.460
I think it's quite good.

25
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.579
This is not a React Router of course, I'm
gonna kind of, scratched the surface with

26
00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.131
it here, but there's a lot of depth
here that I'm not I'm gonna cover.

27
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:38.950
So why would you want
a client side router.

28
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.890
Well I'm sure many of you have heard of
a SPA, write a single page application,

29
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.090
and this allows you to basically
have a user land on a page.

30
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.747
And then when they navigate from page to
page on your website they're not actually

31
00:01:51.747 --> 00:01:54.768
making a full request to your server
they're actually just routing

32
00:01:54.768 --> 00:01:57.493
to a different page inside of
your JavaScript application.

33
00:01:57.493 --> 00:02:01.318
This is helpful because they don't have
to do like a full like latency kind

34
00:02:01.318 --> 00:02:04.463
of first handshake back to your server and
have a comeback and

35
00:02:04.463 --> 00:02:06.450
all that kind of stuff all over again.

36
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.189
It's just all done on
on this on your client.

37
00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:10.476
So that can be positive.

38
00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:13.255
It's good for if you have like an,
like a real application for

39
00:02:13.255 --> 00:02:15.560
something like Netflix is a good example,
right?

40
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.820
We use React Router when I was at Netflix,
because it's an app, right?

41
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.351
You're actually moving from page to page,
but

42
00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:21.740
it's actually different parts of an app.

43
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.005
If you're doing something
like a trying to think like

44
00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:28.765
well what a good example would be.

45
00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:32.894
I don't know like a like a Wiki page right
where it's it actually is just like a web

46
00:02:32.894 --> 00:02:36.660
page where every web page is separate
maybe a router is not the best idea and

47
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.665
you could just server side rendered and
sent down to static HTML files.

48
00:02:40.665 --> 00:02:41.505
That might make more sense.

49
00:02:41.505 --> 00:02:44.064
Anyway, I'm trying to just kind
of delineate, sometimes you might

50
00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:47.345
want a router or sometimes you might
just want like a normal web page.

51
00:02:47.345 --> 00:02:50.031
And both of those are valid solutions.

52
00:02:50.031 --> 00:02:54.663
So we're gonna make the single page
application because I imagine many of you

53
00:02:54.663 --> 00:02:55.952
will need to do that.

54
00:02:55.952 --> 00:03:00.707
So I want you to go over
to your application and

55
00:03:00.707 --> 00:03:05.471
I want you to make a page
called details.js.

56
00:03:09.734 --> 00:03:14.819
Then I want you to make the most
basic thing you can think of,

57
00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.510
const details equals arrow function and
just return,

58
00:03:24.147 --> 00:03:30.228
Whatever you want and
then export default details.

59
00:03:32.927 --> 00:03:35.735
So I used to put curse words in there,
[LAUGH] And

60
00:03:35.735 --> 00:03:39.563
then you can probably finish
the rest of the story in your head.

61
00:03:39.563 --> 00:03:44.845
[LAUGH] I shipped it to production
once at a company, let's go with very

62
00:03:44.845 --> 00:03:49.959
conservative religious values,
and they were very upset with me.

63
00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.523
It was objectively funny.

64
00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:56.850
[LAUGH] But
they didn't find it as funny as I did.

65
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.670
I'll put it that way.

66
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.270
So that's why I do this now.

67
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.870
I'm getting less trouble for that.

68
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.764
But anyway, let's keep going so

69
00:04:09.764 --> 00:04:18.184
let's install React Router
dash DOM got yeah,

70
00:04:18.184 --> 00:04:24.930
you can get rid of us to bug value here.

71
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.890
Okay, and I want you to go to your
terminal, you can stop your server for

72
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.130
just a second and
I want you to say npm install.

73
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.510
This one's not -D, because it's this
one's actually a production dependency.

74
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:49.101
So NPM I react-router-dom@6.2.1 If
you're getting a dependency error and

75
00:04:49.101 --> 00:04:55.677
it won't let you install it you
can actually just say --force.

76
00:04:55.677 --> 00:04:58.900
I don't imagine anyone should
be seeing that right now.

77
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.013
You'd be seeing that if you're
on React Router eight, or

78
00:05:01.013 --> 00:05:02.186
sorry if you're on React 18.

79
00:05:02.186 --> 00:05:05.574
If you're trying to do this course
on React 18 you'll see that error.

80
00:05:05.574 --> 00:05:09.344
React-router-dom has stripped pure
dependencies on React and it says like,

81
00:05:09.344 --> 00:05:11.931
I only support this version
to this version of React and

82
00:05:11.931 --> 00:05:13.520
18 would fall outside of that.

83
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.780
So it still works by the way,
you totally can.

84
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.956
It just won't work right now.

85
00:05:18.956 --> 00:05:24.089
Yeah, so you just do the same thing,
but --force and that'll make it do it.

86
00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:25.885
Okay, I'm gonna run my server again.

87
00:05:29.305 --> 00:05:31.709
Once you have the two app.js.

88
00:05:34.357 --> 00:05:39.465
And then up here, we're going

89
00:05:39.465 --> 00:05:45.752
to import BrowserRouter, Routes and

90
00:05:45.752 --> 00:05:52.660
Route from react-router-dash-dot.

91
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.922
So the first thing I'm going to point
out here, why is it react-router?

92
00:05:56.922 --> 00:06:01.476
Well, there's also
react-router-native as well.

93
00:06:01.476 --> 00:06:04.368
So they put out two different
versions of this library.

94
00:06:04.368 --> 00:06:07.882
Once for react router, or sorry,
react native ones for react.

95
00:06:07.882 --> 00:06:15.046
Because that work more or less the same
way but that's why the dash dom is there.

96
00:06:15.046 --> 00:06:17.262
They used to make you
install React router and

97
00:06:17.262 --> 00:06:20.776
react-router -dom kind of like
there's like react-dom and react.

98
00:06:20.776 --> 00:06:22.335
And they eventually just did away with it.

99
00:06:22.335 --> 00:06:26.200
No, you just have to install one library.

100
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:34.628
Okay, and then up here we're also going
to import Details from ./Details, okay?

101
00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:44.037
So, Inside of

102
00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:49.219
Strict Mode here we're
going to put BrowserRouter.

103
00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:51.701
And inside a BrowserRouter,

104
00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:56.371
we're gonna put like a nice
little h1 here of adopt me.

105
00:06:56.371 --> 00:07:00.387
So we're just gonna move that I guess.

106
00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:07.263
And then inside of that,
we're gonna put some routes

107
00:07:10.916 --> 00:07:16.652
And then we're gonna do a route

108
00:07:16.652 --> 00:07:23.941
here of path equals /details/:ID.

109
00:07:23.941 --> 00:07:28.541
And the elements that it's going to render

110
00:07:28.541 --> 00:07:33.025
is going to be Details, oops, Details.

111
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.939
Okay, we're gonna have another
route underneath that.

112
00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:40.473
Oops, I did that wrong.

113
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.298
Like that rather.

114
00:07:51.916 --> 00:07:56.813
Okay and then underneath that we'll
do another route this will just be

115
00:07:56.813 --> 00:08:02.136
the homepage so just be slash and
we'll start do Search Params on that page.

116
00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:09.377
Okay and then we can get rid
of this stuff down here.

117
00:08:09.377 --> 00:08:12.033
And I can get rid of that so
you can actually see more of this.

118
00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:21.640
So let's talk about what we did here.

119
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.555
What is browser router?

120
00:08:23.555 --> 00:08:27.073
It's basically saying that everything
inside of here is being handled by some

121
00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:27.827
sort of router.

122
00:08:27.827 --> 00:08:33.527
So for example, I could have I
don't know an h1 outside of here.

123
00:08:33.527 --> 00:08:37.560
And this will just like not be
available inside of the browser.

124
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.775
So I couldn't use any sort of
like links inside of here.

125
00:08:39.775 --> 00:08:42.656
I couldn't use any of those
browser router components.

126
00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:45.718
This is like a parent component that
kind of governs all the internal

127
00:08:45.718 --> 00:08:46.695
state of the router.

128
00:08:46.695 --> 00:08:48.884
The other thing is you can
have multiple routers.

129
00:08:48.884 --> 00:08:50.783
Now why would you want to
have multiple routers.

130
00:08:50.783 --> 00:08:53.981
So, you can actually have like
contextual side navs, right?

131
00:08:53.981 --> 00:08:56.992
So let's say I have like a page,
a blog post, and

132
00:08:56.992 --> 00:09:00.385
maybe like little helper
things on the side of my page.

133
00:09:00.385 --> 00:09:04.628
I can actually have a separate router that
goes over to that part of the page and

134
00:09:04.628 --> 00:09:08.110
routes differently than what
the core part of my page, right?

135
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.413
So you can actually have
a multiple different routers,

136
00:09:10.413 --> 00:09:12.235
that's I'd say that's pretty uncommon.

137
00:09:12.235 --> 00:09:16.529
And there's other ways of handling
that which we might talk about later.

138
00:09:16.529 --> 00:09:20.818
But we're getting into kind of
the advanced use cases of of routers

139
00:09:20.818 --> 00:09:21.820
at the moment.

140
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.186
Yeah.

141
00:09:24.186 --> 00:09:29.249
&gt;&gt; Can the path also be relative and
what would it be relative to?

142
00:09:29.249 --> 00:09:30.376
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.

143
00:09:30.376 --> 00:09:35.211
So let's talk about route components here.

144
00:09:35.211 --> 00:09:36.982
I'll get to it in a sec.

145
00:09:36.982 --> 00:09:44.465
So, the next thing you've seen
in here is the routes component.

146
00:09:44.465 --> 00:09:49.118
If you remember the old versions of
React Router, this is like the switch

147
00:09:49.118 --> 00:09:54.012
component that basically says one of
these is going to be rendered at a time.

148
00:09:54.012 --> 00:09:58.684
So for example if I go to
details/5 technically by

149
00:09:58.684 --> 00:10:03.461
regex match by path matching
this path will actually

150
00:10:03.461 --> 00:10:08.458
match it because it'll match
it everything to the left

151
00:10:08.458 --> 00:10:13.041
of it which is kind of
relative here matches this.

152
00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:20.972
Suffice to say, both of these would
match the path slash, so /detail/5.

153
00:10:20.972 --> 00:10:23.499
There used to be a problem with the old
versions of React Router that you'd

154
00:10:23.499 --> 00:10:25.276
have two routes that would
show up at the same time.

155
00:10:25.276 --> 00:10:29.367
So you'd have to have the switch component
that was a okay only render the first one

156
00:10:29.367 --> 00:10:30.880
that matches.

157
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.410
They kinda did away with all that stuff.

158
00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.792
So, if that all sounded
complicated one it was and

159
00:10:34.792 --> 00:10:39.390
two don't worry about it [LAUGH] Unless
you're on old versions of react router.

160
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.693
They now have adopted how Reach Router
works, which uses an internal scoring

161
00:10:43.693 --> 00:10:47.358
system of like what's the most
specific path that matches this?

162
00:10:47.358 --> 00:10:53.680
So now /details/5 matches that and
it matches it with a more specific score.

163
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.138
You can think of it like a CSS selector
basically, where it's more specific

164
00:10:58.138 --> 00:11:02.790
therefore it will use this one first,
no matter what order they came in.

165
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:07.256
Whereas before, with React Router 5,
it mattered what order they came in.

166
00:11:07.256 --> 00:11:10.959
So they took a very complicated thing and
they made it way simpler to use.

167
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.100
So, in other words, this works,
how you would expect it to.

168
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.110
And I just want you to be grateful for
that fact because I worked for

169
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.290
a long time when it didn't
work how you expect it to.

170
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:30.620
So there's a question about let's
talk about path for a second.

171
00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.597
There is a way to do relative paths and

172
00:11:33.597 --> 00:11:38.312
you can do that with like nested
routers or nested routes.

173
00:11:38.312 --> 00:11:42.735
So if I go inside of details, and let's
say I could put another routes inside

174
00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:46.560
of that it would be relative
to the parent routes, right?

175
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.275
So if I put a route inside of details, and

176
00:11:51.275 --> 00:11:56.546
I had the person had two
more routes in there,

177
00:11:56.546 --> 00:12:00.178
one for about one for contact.

178
00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:03.380
If the person clicked on one
of the links to take to go

179
00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:07.859
to the contact page in there,
the URL would be/details/the number.

180
00:12:07.859 --> 00:12:12.359
This is a variable by the way,
the colon means variable /contact, right?

181
00:12:12.359 --> 00:12:14.567
So it'd be relative to the parent routes.

182
00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:21.814
So that's as relativistic as
it gets relative to the parent

183
00:12:21.814 --> 00:12:25.219
route there's not anything more than that.

184
00:12:25.219 --> 00:12:29.519
I think you're gonna have
a base route as well, but

185
00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:34.324
it's gonna be the base of
wherever this is being hosted.

186
00:12:34.324 --> 00:12:38.482
Okay, then so
let's talk about this for a second.

187
00:12:38.482 --> 00:12:41.119
I want to have a variable here, right?

188
00:12:41.119 --> 00:12:43.850
So I want to be able to
have like a details page.

189
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.261
But I want to have a details page for

190
00:12:45.261 --> 00:12:47.653
all of my various different
pets that I can adopt, right?

191
00:12:47.653 --> 00:12:49.920
So that's why I have this colon ID here.

192
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:55.330
This will be the ID of the petthat's
being clicked on, right?

193
00:12:55.330 --> 00:13:00.666
So for example, if I go back over to
my page, Luna I know for example,

194
00:13:00.666 --> 00:13:07.114
her ID is one because she's number one but
there you go there's my beautiful page.

195
00:13:07.114 --> 00:13:10.751
You can see here the ID here is one.

196
00:13:10.751 --> 00:13:17.032
So that's how you do variable here
are like route params is with the colon.

197
00:13:17.032 --> 00:13:22.418
And anything after the colon is going
to be the name of whatever it was so

198
00:13:22.418 --> 00:13:24.700
I could put like pet ID here and

199
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:30.287
then it would be available as pet ID
inside of those wrapped components.

200
00:13:30.287 --> 00:13:34.975
Okay, then let's talk
a second about element.

201
00:13:34.975 --> 00:13:40.027
This is whatever you want to render
if the if this route is matched,

202
00:13:40.027 --> 00:13:43.922
so in this case,
I want to render the details page.

203
00:13:43.922 --> 00:13:48.200
Again, previous versions of React Router,
this was actually you would actually just

204
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.810
pass it the entire unrendered component
you pass it like details like this.

205
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.173
And then it would do the like,
basically you'd pass it the class and

206
00:13:56.173 --> 00:13:58.535
then it would take care
of the instance for you.

207
00:13:58.535 --> 00:14:03.596
Now they switched it so that you
actually give it an instance of it.

208
00:14:03.596 --> 00:14:05.199
Why?

209
00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:07.577
I'm sure they had some
good reason actually.

210
00:14:07.577 --> 00:14:13.320
I think I linked to the rationality,
if you wanna go read.

211
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.987
It made a lot of difference
to a lot of people.

212
00:14:15.987 --> 00:14:19.630
And there was a large argument about it,
and as well as things that are just like,

213
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:21.786
whatever, it's functionally
the same to me.

214
00:14:21.786 --> 00:14:25.109
I think I have, yeah, there you go,
advantages of route elements.

215
00:14:28.641 --> 00:14:33.920
People just get really up in arms about
APIs, especially when they don't Matter.

216
00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.773
I'm sure I'm offending someone by saying.

217
00:14:40.123 --> 00:14:41.855
That as you can see,
that really bothers me.

218
00:14:46.239 --> 00:14:50.099
One of the great things about
React Router is it's really accessible,

219
00:14:50.099 --> 00:14:53.846
they do a ton of work to make sure that,
the focus tracks really well.

220
00:14:53.846 --> 00:14:57.768
And that if you navigate from page to page
that they're focusing on the right things,

221
00:14:57.768 --> 00:14:59.946
and that they're firing
off the right events so

222
00:14:59.946 --> 00:15:01.598
that screen readers can pick it up.

223
00:15:01.598 --> 00:15:05.172
So I think that's probably one of
the biggest reasons I use React Router is

224
00:15:05.172 --> 00:15:10.530
accessibility, particularly around single
page applications is extremely difficult.

225
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:14.826
And if you don't know that means you
probably haven't worked with it enough.

226
00:15:14.826 --> 00:15:18.427
So in other words, use React Router for

227
00:15:18.427 --> 00:15:23.232
that reason that like that's
one of the best reasons

228
00:15:23.232 --> 00:15:27.723
to use it is taking care
of all that kind of stuff.

229
00:15:27.723 --> 00:15:31.334
Cool and I think that's everything that
I have to say about React Router so

230
00:15:31.334 --> 00:15:33.500
you have any questions about React Router.

231
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.733
&gt;&gt; Can you change that ID
veriable to something else?

232
00:15:39.733 --> 00:15:40.821
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

233
00:15:40.821 --> 00:15:45.730
&gt;&gt; Does that have to come from the API or?

234
00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.890
&gt;&gt; However you want, yeah, good question.

235
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.710
I called ID because I'm not very creative.

236
00:15:56.384 --> 00:15:57.901
Other questions?

237
00:15:57.901 --> 00:16:03.377
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've kind of a follow up question
to the question that was just asked.

238
00:16:03.377 --> 00:16:06.421
Can you contain multiple variables there?

239
00:16:06.421 --> 00:16:10.414
So like,
could you I guess maybe that's it.

240
00:16:10.414 --> 00:16:12.645
I'm convoluting it but yeah.

241
00:16:12.645 --> 00:16:14.153
&gt;&gt; Yep that works.

242
00:16:14.153 --> 00:16:15.511
&gt;&gt; Cool, okay.

243
00:16:19.172 --> 00:16:20.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the world is your oyster
