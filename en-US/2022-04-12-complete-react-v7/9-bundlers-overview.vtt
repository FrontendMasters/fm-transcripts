00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.566
Let's start with, what is a bundler?

2
00:00:07.796 --> 00:00:12.553
If you look at this page right now,
I'm just viewing source on

3
00:00:12.553 --> 00:00:16.680
the the page that you and
I just created here, right?

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.020
It's creating this file
here index.9e7b1db9.js.

5
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.103
As you and I both know, we didn't
write that, we wrote app.js, right?

6
00:00:30.312 --> 00:00:32.730
Well, how did we get from here to this,
right?

7
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.790
And if you look at this,
That's actually fairly simple, right?

8
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.620
It's actually not even really doing
very much transformation for us.

9
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.930
I guess the only thing that it is doing at
the moment is that it's doing render here,

10
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.098
down here, right?

11
00:00:48.098 --> 00:00:54.850
And it moved it down from there,
which is kind of funny.

12
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.680
So, how is that happening?

13
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.730
I guess I need to refresh the page here.

14
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.710
Yes, this is actually not running.

15
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.822
So if I do this again npm run dev,
this actually will be much bigger.

16
00:01:09.822 --> 00:01:17.182
Sorry, to interrupt my
site on what bundlers are,

17
00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:25.054
we do have to do one thing here
on line 14 this is new for

18
00:01:25.054 --> 00:01:30.547
Parcel too, put type equals module.

19
00:01:33.094 --> 00:01:35.572
Cuz we're using ES6 modules, right?

20
00:01:35.572 --> 00:01:40.130
And so you have to inform Parcel
to kick into module mode instead

21
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.914
of CommonJS which is like
const react equals require

22
00:01:43.914 --> 00:01:47.704
react that that style of
module is called CommonJS.

23
00:01:47.704 --> 00:01:52.905
So once you do that then Parcel will be
like okay I get it now, now if I refresh

24
00:01:52.905 --> 00:01:58.960
this page, and I open this, you'll
notice that this hash changed as well.

25
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.630
Now this got significantly longer look
how long this is, that's absurd, right?

26
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.854
Why?
Why is it so long?

27
00:02:04.854 --> 00:02:07.052
Okay, so going backwards now.

28
00:02:09.417 --> 00:02:12.462
Your browser doesn't understand,

29
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.760
A lot of the JavaScript that
modern JavaScript developers use.

30
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:28.587
So for example, Please don't be pedantic
back at me after I'm pedantic to you,

31
00:02:28.587 --> 00:02:32.285
your browser doesn't really understand
how to did this ES6 imports,

32
00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:36.189
it kind of does actually now but
we're not using it in that particular way.

33
00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.178
The way we have written it would
not understand, let's go with that.

34
00:02:39.178 --> 00:02:43.024
And so we need some tool to take all
of our JavaScript files, including all

35
00:02:43.024 --> 00:02:46.995
the stuff that we install from the node
modules directory, and put into a big

36
00:02:46.995 --> 00:02:51.178
glob of JavaScript and ship it down to
something that a browser can understand.

37
00:02:51.178 --> 00:02:53.750
Particularly if you are supporting
older browsers, right?

38
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.118
If you are still supporting, Internet
Explorer11, one, I am deeply sorry, and

39
00:02:58.118 --> 00:03:01.993
two, you need something that's going
to package it in such a way that those

40
00:03:01.993 --> 00:03:03.430
browsers can understand.

41
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.440
Another thing is, we're doing things
here like arrow functions, right?

42
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.940
Internet Explorer does not
understand arrow functions, right?

43
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.111
So something has to take that new style of
JavaScript and translate it into an old

44
00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:21.139
style of JavaScript This
is what your Parcel or

45
00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.956
Webpack or Vitet or
ES build or Snowpack or

46
00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:30.510
Browserify or rollup I can keep going.

47
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.020
So, no one wants me to keep going though.

48
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.050
Anyway, there's a lot of
JavaScript bundlers out there.

49
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.984
That's what these are doing for you,

50
00:03:35.984 --> 00:03:40.278
they're taking this input of code that you
want, and then it's repackaging in such

51
00:03:40.278 --> 00:03:44.350
a way that it's generally applicable
to the browsers that you're targeting.

52
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.374
Now I'm simplifying basically
something like Parcel is the tip of

53
00:03:50.374 --> 00:03:54.560
the spear in the sense of it's not
doing that all inside a Parcel itself.

54
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.686
It's using tools like Babel and
PostCSS and the TypeScript compiler,

55
00:03:59.686 --> 00:04:04.890
and a myriad of as you can see here,
we installed 186 packages.

56
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.649
It's using all 186 of those open
source tools to pull together into one

57
00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.960
cohesive package which is Parcel.

58
00:04:16.347 --> 00:04:19.297
And then we're gonna start using
non standard JavaScript syntax

59
00:04:19.297 --> 00:04:20.860
when we start using JSX.

60
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.900
Browsers definitely don't speak JSX.

61
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.557
So you need something to translate that
from code that I'm writing to code that

62
00:04:27.557 --> 00:04:29.190
browsers can understand.

63
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.630
I probably could have just said that and
ended it there, but here we are.

64
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.513
Why are we not using create-react-app?

65
00:04:37.513 --> 00:04:38.900
Or what is create-react-app?

66
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.380
Let's start with why we're
not using create-react-app.

67
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.316
Basically what I was telling you at the
beginning of the course, that I hated that

68
00:04:46.316 --> 00:04:52.240
most JavaScript tutorials start with, draw
the circle, then draw the rest of the owl.

69
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.987
That's what create-react-app does for you,
it drops you into the middle of a project.

70
00:04:56.987 --> 00:05:00.560
It's very disorienting if you don't
know where you are and just say cool,

71
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.963
you have now a fully functional
development environment, go forth and

72
00:05:03.963 --> 00:05:04.941
create React apps.

73
00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:06.219
And you're like, how?

74
00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.841
Where am I?

75
00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:07.981
How did I get here?

76
00:05:07.981 --> 00:05:09.660
Who took my keys, right?

77
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.783
You start asking questions like that.

78
00:05:11.783 --> 00:05:16.303
Create-react-app is great, if I have to
knock out something in ten minutes and

79
00:05:16.303 --> 00:05:18.440
I wanna just prototype really quick.

80
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.728
Actually these days they
probably still will use Parcel,

81
00:05:20.728 --> 00:05:22.600
cuz it's almost as fast, right?

82
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.792
But you can just say npm init React app,
and

83
00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:30.950
you'll just get like a brand new
React app ready to go, right?

84
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.321
It'll have TypeScript, it'll have testing,
it'll have a bunch of stuff like that,

85
00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:37.560
it's solid technology.

86
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.317
But that's why we're not using
create-react-app because I didn't want

87
00:05:41.317 --> 00:05:44.261
you to start with a functioning
development environment.

88
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:48.515
I wanted you to start writing code, start
to feel the pain of why we do something

89
00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:52.848
that way and then I want you to know the
tool to solve the pain that we experience.

90
00:05:52.848 --> 00:05:55.883
So that's what create-react-app is.

91
00:05:55.883 --> 00:05:57.828
That's why we're not using it, question.

92
00:05:57.828 --> 00:06:02.288
&gt;&gt; Not sure maybe I heard you wrong,
I think you said npm, it's npx right?

93
00:06:02.288 --> 00:06:04.190
Create-react-app.

94
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.360
&gt;&gt; So I guess it doesn't work anymore.

95
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.226
So there used to be a way to init,
projects called npm init and

96
00:06:10.226 --> 00:06:13.110
it looks like create-react-app
stopped supporting that.

97
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.560
So you have to do,
to your point, npx create,

98
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:26.090
you can see there I used it to create
next step, create-react-app test app.

99
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.097
So it will go through and
just set up everything for you.

100
00:06:30.097 --> 00:06:36.551
And to his point, most of it's optional,
but again, you kind of have to,

101
00:06:36.551 --> 00:06:42.709
you're starting at step 14 and
you're wondering how you got there.

102
00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:46.931
By the time that you're done with this
project you'll understand every single

103
00:06:46.931 --> 00:06:50.649
file and why it is there and more than
anything you don't have to follow

104
00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:53.567
my way of writing code don't for
that matter, right?

105
00:06:53.567 --> 00:06:56.645
And I want you to understand the tool,
understand what it does, and

106
00:06:56.645 --> 00:06:58.700
then I want you to make
a conscious decision.

107
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.066
This adds to my experience of this
does not add to my experience and

108
00:07:04.066 --> 00:07:07.570
then go forth and with your opinion on it.

109
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:14.150
So if we look here into test app You can
see here it's got a bunch of stuff in it.

110
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.345
It comes with tests and who writes tests?

111
00:07:18.345 --> 00:07:23.014
[LAUGH] It's got a robots.txt,
stuff like that,

112
00:07:23.014 --> 00:07:28.760
manifest.json, ain't nobody use that,
just kidding.

113
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.355
You should probably use it,
it's a good idea.

114
00:07:33.914 --> 00:07:39.390
Look at that, comments, now they're
joking with me, no one writes comments.

115
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.832
I remember I got in a very serious
discussion with Jim Young and

116
00:07:42.832 --> 00:07:46.209
other fantastic Frontend Masters
teacher about how much you

117
00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:50.590
should comment your code, and at the time
I was very wrong, Jim was right.

118
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.252
Jim was saying that you should comment,
well, Jim writes a lot of comments.

119
00:07:54.252 --> 00:07:55.980
I think he was some time on that.

120
00:07:57.629 --> 00:08:01.770
I feel like I've just started like four
fights with other Frontend Masters

121
00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.210
teachers during the course of this course.

122
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.050
It's fine, they're not here,
they can't argue back
