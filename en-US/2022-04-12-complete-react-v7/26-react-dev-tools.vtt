1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.081
Last thing here that I'm gonna show you,
which is probably the most useful and

2
00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:05.645
you might be a little upset at me
that I did not show you sooner, but

3
00:00:05.645 --> 00:00:08.138
now that you're gonna know about
it you can use it all the time.

4
00:00:08.138 --> 00:00:13.016
There is a extension for
browsers so search for

5
00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:17.777
React extension for whatever your browser.

6
00:00:17.777 --> 00:00:23.600
I'm obviously on Firefox,
so React extension Firefox.

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.208
It looks like this,
the React Developer Tools.

8
00:00:26.208 --> 00:00:28.454
It's on Firefox, it's on Chrome,

9
00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:32.444
you can obviously get it on Edge
through the Chrome store as well.

10
00:00:32.444 --> 00:00:33.678
They used to have it on Safari and

11
00:00:33.678 --> 00:00:36.350
they stopped supporting it cuz I
don't think it was super well used.

12
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.953
I think brave can use
the Chrome version as well.

13
00:00:40.953 --> 00:00:43.685
Anyway, install that.

14
00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:49.367
You'll end up with something that looks
like this up here in the top right.

15
00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:53.243
So you can see here,
it's lit up on this page cuz obviously,

16
00:00:53.243 --> 00:00:55.071
there is React on this page.

17
00:00:55.071 --> 00:01:00.173
This page is using the production
build of React for the course website.

18
00:01:00.173 --> 00:01:04.673
Or if we go into here,
this is using the development build.

19
00:01:04.673 --> 00:01:10.490
So this will also remind you of, hey,
you need to package this for production.

20
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.997
Okay, so once you have that installed,

21
00:01:12.997 --> 00:01:17.880
you should get additional two tabs on
here, the components and the profiler.

22
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.271
Let's look at the components one,

23
00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:24.106
it will actually show you like
a DOM Explorer of your app.

24
00:01:24.106 --> 00:01:28.178
So I can see app here if I click
on it I can see the props.

25
00:01:29.204 --> 00:01:32.423
You can see the search params.

26
00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:38.603
You can see this one doesn't
actually have any state.

27
00:01:40.293 --> 00:01:45.423
This one has props here, you can look
at what props are being passed down.

28
00:01:45.423 --> 00:01:51.251
This one should have some hooks though
that we should be able to check out,

29
00:01:51.251 --> 00:01:52.192
yeah we do.

30
00:01:52.192 --> 00:01:55.847
So if I change animal to be cat here.

31
00:01:55.847 --> 00:01:59.415
You can see it'll actually do that and
you can actually come in here and

32
00:01:59.415 --> 00:02:00.639
start messing with it.

33
00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:05.261
So I'm gonna make this dog now and
you can see it gets modified over there.

34
00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:07.425
So that's kind of fun,
you can mess with your state.

35
00:02:09.815 --> 00:02:13.991
You can see the breed list
here that's coming down.

36
00:02:13.991 --> 00:02:19.596
So it actually can even see into your
custom hook, which is kind of cool, right?

37
00:02:19.596 --> 00:02:22.073
There's a lot of cool
stuff you can do here.

38
00:02:22.073 --> 00:02:25.523
You can actually go in here and I get into
this Intermediate React a little bit.

39
00:02:25.523 --> 00:02:31.626
But let's go to search params,
there's a thing called use debug value.

40
00:02:31.626 --> 00:02:38.206
So you can actually render stuff
directly to the extension.

41
00:02:38.206 --> 00:02:43.085
So if I say use debug value,
hi from the code, and

42
00:02:43.085 --> 00:02:49.000
then if I come back over here and
look in search params.

43
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.790
So typically you wouldn't
use it directly in here.

44
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.090
You'd be using it for
something like a custom hook.

45
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.536
And actually,
that might even be my problem here.

46
00:02:56.536 --> 00:02:58.594
I'm gonna have to use it from breed list.

47
00:03:02.997 --> 00:03:05.530
&gt;&gt; Use debug value can be
used to display a label for

48
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.311
custom hooks in React Dev Tools.

49
00:03:10.788 --> 00:03:11.380
&gt;&gt; There you go.

50
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.690
So right there you can see hi
from the code, that's what it is.

51
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.740
So you have to do it from
within a custom hook.

52
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.786
So let's say we needed to show
some sort of internal state.

53
00:03:20.786 --> 00:03:25.999
Maybe something you could
do here that actually

54
00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:31.080
might be sort of useful
is you could say how much

55
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.784
object.keys from localcache.length.

56
00:03:37.431 --> 00:03:42.714
And we could just say
number of values in cache.

57
00:03:42.714 --> 00:03:46.770
Nope, don't need that.

58
00:03:50.753 --> 00:03:54.332
So as of right now, you can see down here,
it's probably kind of hard to see.

59
00:03:54.332 --> 00:03:57.648
But it says, number of values in cache 0.

60
00:03:57.648 --> 00:04:01.169
But if I go in here and say, rabbit, cat,

61
00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.890
you can see that number
kind of going up over time.

62
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.170
So that would be a good use for
this right,

63
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.481
is like showing some sort of internal
debugging value that's useful for you.

64
00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:15.368
That wouldn't make sense for
you to store in some sort of hook or

65
00:04:15.368 --> 00:04:16.409
something like that.

66
00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.527
I wasn't necessarily planning
on talking about that, but

67
00:04:18.527 --> 00:04:21.380
there's lots of cool stuff you can do with
the Dev Tools is kind of my point here.

68
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.210
There's also a profiler here,
which I have actually used far less.

69
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.790
But we can click this.

70
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.199
And then you can kind of see how
stuff is changing over time.

71
00:04:38.868 --> 00:04:45.640
So you can see here, what the priority
of it was, how long it took to render.

72
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.366
So I just recorded a little bit of
my app and then I clicked play and

73
00:04:49.366 --> 00:04:52.618
then it shows you a detailed
kind of flame graph of that.

74
00:04:52.618 --> 00:04:54.478
You can see here we're
not doing very much so

75
00:04:54.478 --> 00:04:56.750
there's not really any
performance concerns here.

76
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.856
But if you're going through something and

77
00:04:58.856 --> 00:05:02.666
your app was churning through tons of
data and was being super slow to render.

78
00:05:02.666 --> 00:05:06.389
This is how you would find out where
you're getting stuck in your renders.

79
00:05:12.248 --> 00:05:14.410
Pretty cool stuff, right?

80
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.690
There's some pretty
advanced stuff in here.

81
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.115
They're always making it better as well.

82
00:05:18.115 --> 00:05:20.422
It's a lot more advanced
than it used to be.

83
00:05:20.422 --> 00:05:24.127
One more thing I was gonna show you,
which I think is kind of a fun trick.

84
00:05:24.127 --> 00:05:27.400
So I can actually say
Inspect Element here.

85
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.538
Inspect.

86
00:05:30.752 --> 00:05:32.390
So I've now clicked on that.

87
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.849
If I just do that and then I immediately
go over to the Components tree,

88
00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:42.462
it'll actually highlight directly the one
that I was doing from the Explorer, right?

89
00:05:42.462 --> 00:05:45.978
So notice this is the lunar component and
that's what I inspected.

90
00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:50.279
Or if I wanna look at this button,
I can inspect that and then go over to

91
00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:55.116
the components again, and notice that
search params is highlighted right?

92
00:05:55.116 --> 00:05:57.033
So it'll make that connection for

93
00:05:57.033 --> 00:06:00.481
us you can actually just do
inspecting as you normally would.

94
00:06:00.481 --> 00:06:05.743
To take that one step further we
can go over to our console now and

95
00:06:05.743 --> 00:06:07.641
we have dollar sign r.

96
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:10.652
This actually will refer to
whatever you have selected in

97
00:06:10.652 --> 00:06:12.228
your component tree as well.

98
00:06:12.228 --> 00:06:15.067
So if you wanna
programmatically manipulate it.

99
00:06:15.067 --> 00:06:17.375
I don't know what's in here.

100
00:06:17.375 --> 00:06:23.889
You can see the hooks that it has, so
that's kind of interesting, right?

101
00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.740
So you can see all these hooks that
it's keeping track of at the moment.

102
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.873
You can see the props
that it's being passed,

103
00:06:29.873 --> 00:06:32.450
which at the moment's not anything.

104
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.222
Type, so that's search params type.

105
00:06:35.222 --> 00:06:38.663
So all pretty cool stuff right?

106
00:06:38.663 --> 00:06:41.603
All things you can use
to kind of like debug

107
00:06:41.603 --> 00:06:44.460
the various different things in React.
