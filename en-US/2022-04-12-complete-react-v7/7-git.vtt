00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.493
That is ESlint.

2
00:00:01.493 --> 00:00:04.784
The next thing that I want you to do is
we're gonna be using this little tiny

3
00:00:04.784 --> 00:00:07.772
project, you've probably never
heard of it, it's called Git.

4
00:00:07.772 --> 00:00:12.224
Everyone should be using Git.

5
00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:15.277
More than anything, what I just want you
to do is I just wanna say get a Git on

6
00:00:15.277 --> 00:00:18.479
your project, even if you don't check
in stuff to like GitHub or Bitbucket or

7
00:00:18.479 --> 00:00:21.880
whatever you choose to check it into, it's
just nice to track source control over

8
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.840
time and you can kinda get
a history of where your codes gone.

9
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.555
And therefore if you mess something up,
you can always roll back to a previous

10
00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:32.400
state, I just suggested, no matter if
you don't intend on checking it or not.

11
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.990
So I did that,
we're gonna make this a Git project.

12
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.731
You'll see now that if I say ls-lsa,

13
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:45.720
you can see here we now
have a dot Git directory.

14
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.893
That's where that dot Git directory
comes from, is that Git init,

15
00:00:48.893 --> 00:00:51.352
that's where all like you'd
get stuff is tracked.

16
00:00:51.352 --> 00:00:53.354
[INAUDIBLE] Get course right now,

17
00:00:53.354 --> 00:00:57.144
there's a great front of masters
course from my good friend and

18
00:00:57.144 --> 00:01:02.524
former co-worker from two companies, Nina,
that goes over what Git is, and Git does.

19
00:01:02.524 --> 00:01:04.214
If I had to suggest anything and

20
00:01:04.214 --> 00:01:07.930
I do to like new developers is
like learn Git fairly well.

21
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.298
You will save yourself a lot of time and

22
00:01:10.298 --> 00:01:14.680
agony if you know how to do cherry
picking and stuff like that.

23
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.623
Unfortunately it's not intuitive,
and as a developer tools person,

24
00:01:18.623 --> 00:01:22.117
it has the worst developer experience,
but it's important.

25
00:01:22.117 --> 00:01:24.791
Even if you know how to use
like the GitHub UI really well,

26
00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:26.610
I'm totally fine with that, yeah.

27
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.939
&gt;&gt; I haven't finished it,

28
00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.440
but I found even just her explanation of
how even Git works was super interesting.

29
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.515
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

30
00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:34.355
She's a great teacher.

31
00:01:34.355 --> 00:01:35.163
I really like Nina.

32
00:01:35.163 --> 00:01:36.471
Hi, Nina.

33
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.725
She's probably not watching,
but hi nonetheless.

34
00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:41.685
So more than anything,

35
00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:46.455
I want you to create a new file
here called dot Git ignore.

36
00:01:46.455 --> 00:01:49.032
And we're just gonna put
a bunch of stuff in here that

37
00:01:49.032 --> 00:01:51.267
we should definitely
ignore in our project.

38
00:01:51.267 --> 00:01:55.760
Node modules.parcel-cache,
or, yeah, cache, dist,

39
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.109
that's where our build is gonna go, .emv,

40
00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:04.570
I just put that in there probably out
of force of habit more than anything,

41
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.520
.DS_Store, if you're on a Mac,
you know exactly what that is.

42
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.960
Or actually you probably don't know
what it is, but you see it everywhere.

43
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.420
Do you wanna know what it is?

44
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.641
It's like, if you like move icons around
it saves the relative position of stuff,

45
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:24.386
and it's like configuration for
like MacOS stupid stuff.

46
00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:27.870
Coverage.

47
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.742
That's gonna come from Istanbul,
that'll come in intermediate react.

48
00:02:31.742 --> 00:02:33.164
And then dot VS code,

49
00:02:33.164 --> 00:02:37.526
we're not gonna check in our own
VS code settings to the project.

50
00:02:37.526 --> 00:02:38.840
So that means we can do that just fine
