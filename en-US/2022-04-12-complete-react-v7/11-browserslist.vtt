00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.417
So there's lots of alternatives to
Parcel we talked about most of them so

2
00:00:04.417 --> 00:00:07.210
if that's your thing feel
free to hop into those.

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:16.039
One last configuration before we can pop
into writing JSX is in your package.JSON.

4
00:00:17.587 --> 00:00:22.384
As a top level kind of, configuration
item here, I want you to create

5
00:00:22.384 --> 00:00:27.449
a one called browsers, again, with an s,
make sure you put the s there.

6
00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.004
I'm gonna say one more time,
browsers, plural, list.

7
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:36.099
Not browser list, browser's list.

8
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:39.498
Okay?

9
00:00:39.498 --> 00:00:44.480
And we're just gonna tell Parcel
what browsers we're targeting.

10
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.671
So in our case, we're just writing
dev code, this is for fun,

11
00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:51.400
we're not shipping it to anyone.

12
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.260
So we're just gonna say something
like last 2 Chrome versions.

13
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.228
Obviously, don't write this for
your production website,

14
00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:04.190
this would cover 15% of
the general population.

15
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.040
Generally, fairly small
demographic to target.

16
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.140
But this is not gonna transform
very much for your code.

17
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.721
It's gonna leave most as it is, because
modern Chrome understands most things.

18
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:21.470
I mean I put Chrome here but obviously I'm
using Firefox, you can put Firefox here

19
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.568
as well, you can put both of them,
you can put, whatever you want here.

20
00:01:26.568 --> 00:01:31.248
But this is what I put when I'm
just doing developer stuff is,

21
00:01:31.248 --> 00:01:33.499
don't transform most of it.

22
00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:36.794
Specifically the reason why I want you
to do this is we don't wanna include

23
00:01:36.794 --> 00:01:37.495
regenerator.

24
00:01:37.495 --> 00:01:42.695
Which if you're going for really old
browsers like IE8 or things like that,

25
00:01:42.695 --> 00:01:47.975
it'll includes things that will polyfill,
async/await and generators and

26
00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:53.410
things like that, which is a huge library
and it's problematic to deal with.

27
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.010
So just include this.

28
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.636
If you see something later in the course
it says regenerator runtime not found,

29
00:02:00.636 --> 00:02:03.604
it's this that's messed up,
delete your cache,

30
00:02:03.604 --> 00:02:07.489
delete your dist directory,
maybe reinstall your node modules.

31
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.680
And then run it again with browsers list
here, and that should fix that problem.

32
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.157
You can go to browserslist.dev, I'll just
show you that really quick so you can see.

33
00:02:24.112 --> 00:02:26.307
That's here in browsers list,

34
00:02:26.307 --> 00:02:30.860
this will actually help you kind of
select what version you want and

35
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.764
it'll show you how many of the general
populace that you are covering.

36
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.865
And you can put in select here we
put in last 2 Chrome versions and

37
00:02:44.865 --> 00:02:49.057
you can see here we're covering
16% of the population.

38
00:02:49.057 --> 00:02:55.234
There's some great,
it's last two versions not dead,

39
00:02:55.234 --> 00:02:59.616
greater than 0.25% market share.

40
00:02:59.616 --> 00:03:03.729
There's a fancy string that you can get
to include 99% of the population and

41
00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:06.010
still get fairly modern browsers.

42
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.349
I'll let you all look that up in your
spare time cuz I don't remember it off

43
00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.890
the top my head.

44
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.106
But this has passed into both Parcel and

45
00:03:13.106 --> 00:03:18.191
PostCSS to make sure that they're
compiling for the right targets.

46
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:21.940
My last spiel on that is that you should
not base that on something that's

47
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.118
on Stack Overflow, you should go figure
out who your users are on your website and

48
00:03:26.118 --> 00:03:27.116
then target them.

49
00:03:27.116 --> 00:03:32.510
And you should be targeting greater
than 98%, greater than 99% hopefully.

50
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.838
So we have reached in the site or
in the course

51
00:03:37.838 --> 00:03:44.370
here if we go back, 02 or 02-js-tools.

52
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.570
So, if you've fallen behind here or
you want the complete set of of all

53
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.890
the developer tools, just start from
this kind of, jumping off point.
