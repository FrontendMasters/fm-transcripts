WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.673
So the state of the project
now is 08-react-router.

2
00:00:04.673 --> 00:00:07.190
If you need to catch up or
want to see where we're at.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.640
We're kind of closing on react router for
the moment.

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.512
We'll do some other things with it, but

5
00:00:16.512 --> 00:00:19.890
that's as much as I'm gonna
get into the depth on it.

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.860
There are alternatives for the record
have more minimalistic routers out there,

7
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.532
the names are escaping me but
there are others just search for

8
00:00:28.532 --> 00:00:32.290
like react router alternatives
I'm sure you'll find a few.

9
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.796
At Netflix we ended up writing our
own I should say the web core team I

10
00:00:36.796 --> 00:00:41.788
didn't help you probably talked to
the president about it I think he was on

11
00:00:41.788 --> 00:00:46.563
that team when I was there just
something more minimalistic, right?

12
00:00:46.563 --> 00:00:48.607
We didn't want all the bells and

13
00:00:48.607 --> 00:00:52.933
whistles we just wanted it to
literally navigate from page to page.

14
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.068
And so if that's what you're looking for

15
00:00:55.068 --> 00:00:57.390
there are more minimalistic
ones out there.

16
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.400
Okay, we are gonna talk
about class components now.

17
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.515
Everything that you and I've been doing
up to this point have been function

18
00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:14.627
components which are kind of like
the direction in the future of react, and

19
00:01:14.627 --> 00:01:20.250
hooks and things like that, react was for
the longest time not written like that.

20
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.392
I remember when function components first
came out, and it was like a revelation as

21
00:01:24.392 --> 00:01:27.660
like, my gosh, I just read
a render function and I'm done.

22
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.670
I was almost offended at
the simplicity of it all.

23
00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:36.141
When I first start out there was a,
so there we showed you react,

24
00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:40.640
create element there used to be a react
create class and that's how we did it.

25
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.021
And actually, I still wax nostalgic
about the create class days because I,

26
00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:48.993
under the surface kinda pinning
things together that was really nice

27
00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:51.340
that React doesn't do for you anymore.

28
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.310
But partway through react switch to
ES6 classes like ES 2015 classes,

29
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.710
which are nice because it's kinda leaning
into the platform and using the constructs

30
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.680
of JavaScript, but it stopped doing
a lot of very nice things for you.

31
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.590
Anyway, we're going to show
you how to do that [LAUGH].

32
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.590
So I'm going to say that there's this API
that I'm about to show is not deprecated.

33
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.850
It's not going anywhere.

34
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.414
These will always be available, but

35
00:02:19.414 --> 00:02:23.140
you're probably going to write these
way less now than you ever did before.

36
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.641
But you need to know them because
there's still lots of them out there and

37
00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:27.580
sometimes you have to read them this way.

38
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.277
And sometimes you'll want
to write them this way

39
00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:34.802
we'll kind of go over
that as we're doing it.

40
00:02:34.802 --> 00:02:37.607
So I want you to go in here to details and

41
00:02:37.607 --> 00:02:43.071
we're going to make details instead
of this being a function component.

42
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:49.400
We're going to make it a class component
so we're going to import component.

43
00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:53.370
Component from react.

44
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:02.597
You just delete this and we're gonna say,
class, details this extends component.

45
00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.706
Okay?
We'll use params here in just a second so

46
00:03:07.706 --> 00:03:10.217
you can leave that import.

47
00:03:10.217 --> 00:03:14.491
So this is not a function
anymore this is a class right?

48
00:03:14.491 --> 00:03:18.970
This is something that's
built into JavaScript.

49
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.100
If you've never seen them
before it's totally fine.

50
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.112
You don't typically use
them on the day to day,

51
00:03:25.112 --> 00:03:30.020
most people don't write JavaScript in
a object oriented kinda way please don't.

52
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.138
Don't start I implore you as your future
coworker to not start writing JavaScript

53
00:03:36.138 --> 00:03:41.635
in an object oriented way go write Java or
something I don't know anyway so

54
00:03:41.635 --> 00:03:46.270
the first thing is I want to
create some state on this, right?

55
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.850
So typically I would have done
use state with hooks, right?

56
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.090
But you can't use hooks
with class components.

57
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.261
So you stay use a factor,
use params or anything that uses use,

58
00:03:57.261 --> 00:04:00.840
you cannot use with a class component.

59
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.510
Totally different way of
writing code here now.

60
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.539
So the first thing we're going to do
is we're going to write a constructor.

61
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.235
The constructor takes in props.

62
00:04:11.235 --> 00:04:16.060
And then the first thing that
you're gonna call is superprops.

63
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.120
Get very used to writing this.

64
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.568
Anytime that you have a constructor, and
a constructor is basically like run this

65
00:04:24.568 --> 00:04:26.760
function as soon as this
class gets created.

66
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.070
So as soon as someone creates an instance,
have details run the constructor.

67
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.720
This is like a reserved JavaScript word.

68
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.080
It's not that React is doing this.

69
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.250
It's that JavaScript in general does that.

70
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.203
So the props is taking in the props of
whatever the parent component is passing

71
00:04:43.203 --> 00:04:45.230
down to the child's component, right?

72
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.960
So this is gonna be whatever the route is.

73
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.790
Being passed from app, right?

74
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.409
Super props means give this to my parent
component so not parent component but

75
00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:58.313
parent class the parent class of details
is component which is a React component,

76
00:04:58.313 --> 00:04:58.828
right?

77
00:04:58.828 --> 00:05:03.612
Basically what you're saying is you
have to give the props to React or

78
00:05:03.612 --> 00:05:09.318
React doesn't know that you got the props
which just messes with a bunch of stuff.

79
00:05:09.318 --> 00:05:11.764
If you have no props it
doesn't really matter.

80
00:05:11.764 --> 00:05:17.177
But I just want you to get in the habit
of anytime that you add a constructor and

81
00:05:17.177 --> 00:05:20.909
react to the first thing
that you call a super props.

82
00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.882
Just like diagrammatically, just do it,
you'll save yourself a bunch of time and

83
00:05:26.882 --> 00:05:27.530
pain later.

84
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.820
Okay, then I wanna
create my initial state.

85
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:39.820
So this dot state equals loading true.

86
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.745
So what's nice about
function components and

87
00:05:42.745 --> 00:05:46.870
like cook based components is you
never have to worry about this.

88
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.505
And if, if anyone's ever taken
a JavaScript interview before here,

89
00:05:50.505 --> 00:05:52.430
we love to ask what is this?

90
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.305
Right, and it's annoying as hell and
that's the way it is but in react.

91
00:05:57.305 --> 00:06:02.029
So, with class components, this becomes
very component important because it's

92
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:05.480
contextually how you manage the state and
manage the props.

93
00:06:07.206 --> 00:06:10.980
So in this case,
will be the instance of detail.

94
00:06:13.788 --> 00:06:18.961
Okay, So

95
00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:23.220
let's write the render function next.

96
00:06:26.645 --> 00:06:29.900
So I don't know why I'm putting
spaces there, that's kind of weird.

97
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.218
Function components have like their
function body is the render function right

98
00:06:36.218 --> 00:06:37.600
with class components.

99
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:43.226
The only rule of a class component is it
must have a render function and the render

100
00:06:43.226 --> 00:06:47.930
function works just like the function
component bodies that it's gonna get run.

101
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.050
And it's going to return some markup.

102
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.120
So here we're just going to say
if this dot state dot loading,

103
00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:04.315
then return h2 loading
Typically you'd put something

104
00:07:04.315 --> 00:07:09.568
like a spinner here or something like
that, but nobody got time for that h2.

105
00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:17.346
Okay and then I'm just going
to show you the way that

106
00:07:17.346 --> 00:07:22.463
I would do this which is I
would destructure here and

107
00:07:22.463 --> 00:07:27.818
say const, animal breed,
city state description,

108
00:07:27.818 --> 00:07:34.370
name equals this start state
thing here and no, that's fine.

109
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.819
Yeah, that's fine, okay.
But you could totally go around and

110
00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:39.632
say this dot state dot animal,

111
00:07:39.632 --> 00:07:44.040
this dot state dot breed this dot state
dot city that just gets old, right?

112
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.730
So it's nice to do structure and then it
makes the render code look kind of nice.

113
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:53.473
And then here you're just
going to return your markup.

114
00:07:56.412 --> 00:08:00.760
Details and then nothing here
should seem too surprising to you.

115
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:06.220
Another div,
each one will put the name here.

116
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.781
So like I was saying before, instead of
saying this, you could have said this,

117
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:11.440
dot state dot name here, like this.

118
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.141
Whatever you find more appealing go for

119
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:23.233
it I just like making this
little as the least dense as

120
00:08:23.233 --> 00:08:28.810
possible it can be then h2 here and
we're just going to do

121
00:08:32.956 --> 00:08:39.461
Animal and then I'll put an M dash again
or minus or whatever you want breed.

122
00:08:43.716 --> 00:08:50.964
City, comma, state like is that.

123
00:08:54.321 --> 00:09:00.305
&gt;&gt; Is the best practice to only
deconstruct the elements you're gonna use?

124
00:09:00.305 --> 00:09:05.122
&gt;&gt; Yeah well, and as you can see here,
yes, Linda's yelling at us right now,

125
00:09:05.122 --> 00:09:10.015
yeah, in general, you just want to be
concerned with what you're concerned

126
00:09:10.015 --> 00:09:12.920
about and ignore everything else.

127
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.357
It's life advice too.

128
00:09:14.357 --> 00:09:19.395
[LAUGH] Okay,

129
00:09:19.395 --> 00:09:25.060
button here and
we're gonna say adopt name.

130
00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:35.050
And then Here we're gonna put
the description of the animal.

131
00:09:43.001 --> 00:09:46.300
Okay, so that's a render function.

132
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.246
You can see this looks really similar
to what you just put in a function

133
00:09:50.246 --> 00:09:51.770
component, right?

134
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:56.059
That's intentional,
I'm gonna just reiterate again right now,

135
00:09:56.059 --> 00:09:58.640
you cannot use hooks here.

136
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.211
So if I try to do use params here,
it'd be like, yeah, no, you can't do,

137
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:09.640
I think even, Yeah, use params cannot be
called in the class component, right?

138
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.310
So it's even smart enough to
tell you that you can't do that.

139
00:10:13.909 --> 00:10:16.490
I'll show you in a second how you can.

140
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:21.960
And it's Pretty obvious
if you think about it.
