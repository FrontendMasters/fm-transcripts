1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.766
So let's go fix ESLint.

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:07.378
Open your terminal, Ctrl+`,

3
00:00:07.378 --> 00:00:12.592
if you're not familiar with the shortcut.

4
00:00:12.592 --> 00:00:16.968
We're gonna say npm

5
00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:21.865
-D eslint-plugin.

6
00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:25.125
Now, well, looks like I don't
have to type it all again.

7
00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.450
plugin-import02.25.4, again,

8
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.579
you can just copy this directly out
of my notes, it might be easier.

9
00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.732
It's at the bottom of
Core React Concepts with JSX.

10
00:00:38.732 --> 00:00:42.843
eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, a11y,

11
00:00:42.843 --> 00:00:47.180
if you're not familiar, is accessibility.

12
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.585
There's 11 characters between the a and
the y, hence a11y.

13
00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:59.696
At 6.5.1, and
eslint-plugin-react at 7.28.0.

14
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:09.920
There's a decent chance that you're
gonna see some vulnerabilities.

15
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.780
That's because I'm having
you fix versions of this.

16
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.615
These are definitely gonna just go up,
so by the time that you watch this,

17
00:01:16.615 --> 00:01:18.840
there might be like 100 vulnerabilities.

18
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.315
It's fine,
you're not shipping it to production,

19
00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:22.914
it's okay to have these on there.

20
00:01:22.914 --> 00:01:26.331
If you update to the latest versions,
they'll probably go away.

21
00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:29.423
If you wanna see what they are,
you can say npm audit.

22
00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:32.925
It will show you everything
that's actually amiss.

23
00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:38.460
Sometimes you can just say npm audit fix,
and it might fix some of them.

24
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.540
Yeah, this one, it couldn't fix any
of them automatically, which is fine.

25
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.500
Anyway, suffice to say,
don't worry about it, it's okay.

26
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.790
Now, I would like you to
go into your eslint.json.

27
00:01:54.398 --> 00:01:57.765
And we're gonna add a couple
of more things in here.

28
00:01:57.765 --> 00:02:00.106
So let's put this on multiple lines here.

29
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.523
So again,
order is not incredibly important here,

30
00:02:07.523 --> 00:02:10.390
as long as prettier is the last one.

31
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:20.052
So we're gonna do plugin:import/errors.

32
00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:31.320
We're gonna do plugin:react/recommended.

33
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.914
And we're gonna do

34
00:02:38.914 --> 00:02:45.819
plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended.

35
00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:55.754
Okay, if underneath plugins
we're gonna have react,

36
00:02:55.754 --> 00:03:02.852
and we're gonna have import,
we're gonna have jsx-a11y.

37
00:03:07.112 --> 00:03:12.863
So, just to let you know what's
referencing what, let's split this for

38
00:03:12.863 --> 00:03:17.055
a second, and
we're gonna pull out package.json.

39
00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:20.211
We installed, I'm in test-app, that's why.

40
00:03:25.406 --> 00:03:30.450
So let me run that again.

41
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.253
Now 0 vulnerabilities,
that's nice, anyway,

42
00:03:33.253 --> 00:03:35.610
I'm sure you'll find some at some point.

43
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.107
So if you look at our package.json now,
I don't know why this is upsetting me.

44
00:03:43.618 --> 00:03:46.680
Don't save, there we go, package.json.

45
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.110
There we go, okay, sorry.

46
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.325
So we installed eslint-plugin-react,
JSX accessibility, and import.

47
00:03:54.325 --> 00:03:55.770
Here we're importing those plugins.

48
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.700
These are augmenting the ability of
ESLint to understand additional language

49
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.300
features.

50
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.960
So, for example, the React one allows
it to comprehend what React is doing.

51
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.228
Import allows it to do
some logic around imports.

52
00:04:10.228 --> 00:04:14.949
So for example, if I say import {

53
00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:19.334
notReal } from './Pet',

54
00:04:19.334 --> 00:04:23.898
./Pet is a real file, right?

55
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.943
Or PetThing or something like that.

56
00:04:29.943 --> 00:04:33.090
There's some logic here, and
I'm not finished with it yet,

57
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.330
that's why it's not
doing it correctly yet.

58
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.940
But that's what the import thing will do.

59
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.128
It'll run ESLint across files, right,

60
00:04:40.128 --> 00:04:42.765
which ESLint doesn't do
at the moment by itself.

61
00:04:42.765 --> 00:04:47.445
It only does one file at a time,
whereas the import one

62
00:04:47.445 --> 00:04:51.605
allows it to check other
files at the same time.

63
00:04:51.605 --> 00:04:57.228
Okay, and then JSX accessibility,
this will just check things like,

64
00:04:57.228 --> 00:05:00.235
are you putting a alt text on an image?

65
00:05:00.235 --> 00:05:05.479
Are you not making buttons that are links,
right?

66
00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.807
So it'll check things to make sure that
you're just doing basic accessibility.

67
00:05:09.807 --> 00:05:12.779
Which I add in this course just cuz I
think it's a good idea for everyone.

68
00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.873
And I'm not the best at JSX,
so I generally try and

69
00:05:15.873 --> 00:05:19.346
make that a machine problem
instead of a human problem.

70
00:05:19.346 --> 00:05:24.318
So that it's just telling me
the best practices as I go.

71
00:05:24.318 --> 00:05:25.604
Okay, so that's what these are.

72
00:05:25.604 --> 00:05:30.472
Then, Here we're doing the same thing,

73
00:05:30.472 --> 00:05:34.144
as eslint:recommended is, there's a set
of recommended rules that comes with

74
00:05:34.144 --> 00:05:37.655
the React plugin, and then recommended
rules that come from the import one.

75
00:05:37.655 --> 00:05:40.640
So we're importing all of those here.

76
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.792
They have additional rules if you
wanna do things, for example,

77
00:05:43.792 --> 00:05:47.170
like alphabetizing all of
your function names, right?

78
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.720
That exists in there for some not very
smart reason, but it's in there, right?

79
00:05:54.055 --> 00:05:59.205
So actually I'm gonna, to bless you, I'm
going to have you disable two rules that

80
00:05:59.205 --> 00:06:07.377
I just can't stand, Okay,
so here under rules,

81
00:06:07.377 --> 00:06:12.671
the first I'm going to
say is react/prop-types.

82
00:06:12.671 --> 00:06:16.277
I'm going to put that as 0,
0 just means turn it off.

83
00:06:16.277 --> 00:06:18.828
I think 1 makes it a warning and
2 makes it an error.

84
00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:24.604
I think you can also do half or
something like that.

85
00:06:24.604 --> 00:06:29.163
I don't remember what they are, I just
remember 0 is off, so that's what I do.

86
00:06:29.163 --> 00:06:35.250
And then I'm gonna do
react/react-in-jsx-scope is 0.

87
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.890
Remember that you always had to import
React in every JSX file before.

88
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.260
We no longer have to do that,
so we can turn that rule off.

89
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.621
So prop types, there is a package called
prop-types that can do some validation,

90
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:53.138
that if I'm importing this prop type,
it's supposed to be a string,

91
00:06:53.138 --> 00:06:55.810
it'll do that at runtime.

92
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.740
It used to be really useful before
Flow and TypeScript came out.

93
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.811
But now that Flow and TypeScript are out,

94
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:07.746
that's no longer useful,
either use TypeScript or use nothing.

95
00:07:07.746 --> 00:07:12.349
Prop types is a weird middle
ground of not very useful,

96
00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:15.860
so, that's why I have you turn that off.

97
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:22.265
Okay, and then the last thing down here.

98
00:07:22.265 --> 00:07:25.179
Because React has changed
a little bit over the year,

99
00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:29.020
you have to put some settings here for
specifically the React plugin.

100
00:07:31.186 --> 00:07:34.790
You have to tell what version
of React you're using.

101
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.194
And we're just gonna say, I don't know,
look at the package.json,

102
00:07:38.194 --> 00:07:40.690
I don't feel like telling you, right?

103
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.610
And then if you write this,
you don't have to worry about it anymore.

104
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.822
If you go look at our app.js,
notice all of the errors went away, right?

105
00:07:46.822 --> 00:07:48.871
Cuz now it understands React here,

106
00:07:48.871 --> 00:07:52.089
and we can actually get rid
of that React here on line 1.

107
00:07:52.089 --> 00:07:56.492
And it knows that Pet is here,
and app is being used, and

108
00:07:56.492 --> 00:08:00.344
Pet's being used, and
all that stuff is happy.

109
00:08:00.344 --> 00:08:02.001
I think, for example,

110
00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:15.830
Maybe, There you go.

111
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.809
So I just wanted to show you here,

112
00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:20.864
we'll talk about click
handlers here in a second.

113
00:08:20.864 --> 00:08:23.390
But this is what the accessibility
one does for you.

114
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:27.191
It says you put an onClick somewhere
where it's not very accessible for

115
00:08:27.191 --> 00:08:29.040
a screen reader reader to find it.

116
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.860
And so it'll throw accessibility errors
on there for you automatically so

117
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.840
you don't make those kinds of mistakes.

118
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:39.645
That's what that does for you.

119
00:08:43.468 --> 00:08:47.386
And I show it to you in hopes that it just
becomes part of your default workflow.

120
00:08:47.386 --> 00:08:52.205
One thing I was gonna throw out that's
changed since v6 of this course.

121
00:08:52.205 --> 00:08:55.263
We used to have to include prettier and
prettier/react.

122
00:08:55.263 --> 00:08:57.959
Those were two different rule
sets that you had to include.

123
00:08:57.959 --> 00:09:00.303
They just rolled it into one,
so now it's just prettier.

124
00:09:00.303 --> 00:09:02.618
So if you're expecting to see that,
that's why it's gone,

125
00:09:02.618 --> 00:09:04.410
it's the newest version
doesn't require it.
