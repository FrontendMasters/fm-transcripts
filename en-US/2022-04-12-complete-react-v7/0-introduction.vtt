00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.319
Hello, and
welcome to the complete intro to react V7.

2
00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:04.040
I'm Brian Holt.

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.815
I'm really excited to be here talking
to you a little bit about React.

4
00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:09.520
It's been a while since I've
been teaching about React.

5
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.638
So, this is my favorite course to teach.

6
00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:16.580
And today we're gonna be talking about
how the React ecosystem has changed and

7
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.140
moved over the past year or so.

8
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.015
So, what I'm looking at in front
of you is the course website,

9
00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:28.786
you can get to this course website
by going to bit.li/react V7.

10
00:00:28.786 --> 00:00:31.300
Make sure that it's all lowercase.

11
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.071
React v7.

12
00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:37.814
Now take it here you can also get there
through my GitHub on BT hold on GitHub.

13
00:00:37.814 --> 00:00:41.067
You can see here I literally
have two computers, right?

14
00:00:41.067 --> 00:00:43.207
This website is what I have
up on this computer so

15
00:00:43.207 --> 00:00:45.999
that's what I'm reading through
I'm teaching this all to.

16
00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:49.123
So, one you can read while I'm reading.

17
00:00:49.123 --> 00:00:52.209
If you fall behind and go back and kind
of reread my points and my statements and

18
00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:53.220
all that kind of things.

19
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.983
You can copy and paste some like
the longer pieces of code you don't

20
00:00:57.983 --> 00:01:02.079
feel like editing yourself I will,
I know I will anyway.

21
00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.573
Let me explain to you
a little bit how it works, so

22
00:01:05.573 --> 00:01:10.690
you can see down here this is
all my course websites stuff.

23
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.426
One thing I did want to address
immediately out of the gate before we get

24
00:01:14.426 --> 00:01:18.940
too much further into this, is this course
is teaching React version 17 not 18.

25
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.070
As of writing of this course,
version 18 is still in release candidate.

26
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.654
And so, it's not quite stable and

27
00:01:26.654 --> 00:01:29.830
I'm trying to teach you something
that you can use today at your job.

28
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.582
You don't wanna use alpha or beta software
particularly if you're going out to

29
00:01:33.582 --> 00:01:35.828
production for
your large scale application.

30
00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:39.740
So, this still uses the most stable
version of React which is version 17.

31
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.216
To be honest with you, there will be some
changes between version 17 and version 18.

32
00:01:43.216 --> 00:01:44.900
And we'll get into that in the course.

33
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.233
But all the concepts that you're learning
now are great for going forward.

34
00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:53.950
You do not have to take version 6 or
version 5 version for this course.

35
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.072
This is just the seventh
revision of this course.

36
00:01:57.072 --> 00:02:00.363
That's the most up to date
of all the different things.

37
00:02:00.363 --> 00:02:03.278
If you wanna learn legacy
versions of this software,

38
00:02:03.278 --> 00:02:08.215
you can go back and look at the complete
insure React version 6, 5, 4,,3, 2, 1.

39
00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:12.870
They all use different, build processes
and routers and things like that.

40
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.191
But, if you're just here to learn React,
start here, you're in the right place.

41
00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:17.874
And we can get started and get going.

42
00:02:17.874 --> 00:02:21.452
So, let's talk about, why I made this
course and the style that I made it?

43
00:02:21.452 --> 00:02:26.402
So, when I was learning
React 2014 I think is

44
00:02:26.402 --> 00:02:30.639
the first React I shipped to production.

45
00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.937
That's supposed to be eight years.

46
00:02:32.937 --> 00:02:36.885
That's a long time to be writing React and
that's eternity in the front and

47
00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:40.660
landscape where the shifting sands
are always moving around, right?

48
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.452
When I was learning React,

49
00:02:44.452 --> 00:02:48.436
I felt like all the tutorials
were started on step 14, right?

50
00:02:48.436 --> 00:02:51.868
It's like have you ever seen the the mean
drawn owl, is like the first line draw

51
00:02:51.868 --> 00:02:54.271
circle and step two is draw
the rest of the owl, right?

52
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:56.680
That's kinda what I felt like
the React tutorials were like.

53
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.223
And so, I wanted to know
what steps 1 through 13 are.

54
00:02:59.223 --> 00:03:02.312
One, I'm like an infrastructure
person kind of by trade, and so

55
00:03:02.312 --> 00:03:04.742
I'd like the build tools and
the build processes.

56
00:03:04.742 --> 00:03:07.583
And I guess I'm a glutton for

57
00:03:07.583 --> 00:03:12.567
punishment when it comes
to those kind of things.

58
00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.704
But, yeah, that's why I built this
tutorial in the way that I do.

59
00:03:14.704 --> 00:03:19.058
We start with a script tag and a browser
and that's it, with no build process.

60
00:03:19.058 --> 00:03:22.728
And then we kind of build up piece by
piece until eventually we arrive at

61
00:03:22.728 --> 00:03:26.476
something where you feel you understand
your stack from top to bottom.

62
00:03:26.476 --> 00:03:27.530
Yeah, and I just in general,

63
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.120
someone that's done infrastructure for
a long time.

64
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.797
If you are working with an abstraction
that you don't understand what it's doing,

65
00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:36.151
I think you learn to resent
the abstraction, right?

66
00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:40.700
So, for example,
who here has problems with Webpack?

67
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.221
Everyone has problems with Webpack.

68
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:44.670
Your hands not up cuz you haven't
worked with Webpack, right?

69
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.903
If you had to like manually and go and
do everything that Webpack does for you,

70
00:03:47.903 --> 00:03:51.062
then be like Webpack is the best thing
that has ever happened to me, right?

71
00:03:51.062 --> 00:03:54.466
And that's how I felt when Webpack came
out, because I was struggling with things

72
00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:57.430
with like Browserify and
stuff like that back in the day.

73
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.673
And so, when Webpack came along and
did all the things I needed to do.

74
00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:03.164
And that's kind of how I feel about React
and all these build tools that I'm about

75
00:04:03.164 --> 00:04:05.933
to show you is that,
if you understand what it's doing for you,

76
00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:08.735
then you be like gonna be like,
I love this thing, it's great.

77
00:04:08.735 --> 00:04:10.960
Even though it's annoys the hell of me and
I have to like fight it,

78
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.900
it's better than fighting
what's underneath it.

79
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.286
So, who is this course for?

80
00:04:15.286 --> 00:04:19.368
This course is for you, I hope [LAUGH].

81
00:04:19.368 --> 00:04:23.495
To be more specific there,
you need to know JavaScript.

82
00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:27.136
And HTML and Python CSS, you could
probably get away with like mental you

83
00:04:27.136 --> 00:04:29.175
should know CSS most of you shouldn't.

84
00:04:29.175 --> 00:04:31.830
But you don't have to know much CSS for
this class.

85
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.841
In other words, I wrote the CSS for you
and I am not saying that it is good, but

86
00:04:35.841 --> 00:04:36.554
it is there.

87
00:04:36.554 --> 00:04:39.585
It does work.

88
00:04:39.585 --> 00:04:43.808
If you're not comfortable with JavaScript,
this course is gonna be pretty difficult.

89
00:04:43.808 --> 00:04:47.843
Luckily front of masters has a couple
of really good intros to JavaScript.

90
00:04:47.843 --> 00:04:52.300
He wants the boo camp, which I helped to
teach with Jim Cramer, which is awesome.

91
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.741
And the other one is the intro to web dev,
v2, we're about to do v3,

92
00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:58.868
which did teach that one as well.

93
00:04:58.868 --> 00:05:01.930
So, I will take those first if
you're not comfortable with that.

94
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.104
This class does share much of
the structure with V5 and V6.

95
00:05:06.104 --> 00:05:08.680
It's the same kind of narrative,
it's working on the same app.

96
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.704
I was really happy with that one.

97
00:05:09.704 --> 00:05:12.851
So, I kept going with it and
just kind of refined it.

98
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:15.576
If you wanna work with like
previous versions of things,

99
00:05:15.576 --> 00:05:19.173
like maybe the old React router or
Reach router, the one previous to that.

100
00:05:19.173 --> 00:05:21.839
You can look at the V5 and V6 and
you can kind of compare and

101
00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:24.363
contrast how the React
ecosystem has grown over time.

102
00:05:28.008 --> 00:05:30.400
Talk about what you needed
to set up on your laptop.

103
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.045
So, I'm gonna be doing this obviously on
Mac OS, I have tested this on Windows so

104
00:05:36.045 --> 00:05:36.795
it does work.

105
00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:41.407
And I don't keep Linux at home
that's just for the office.

106
00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:44.842
I'm just going for
punishment at work not at home.

107
00:05:44.842 --> 00:05:45.534
But everything,

108
00:05:45.534 --> 00:05:48.682
you just follow the Mac OS instructions
everything should work perfectly well.

109
00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:51.040
It gigs a ram on your
computer would be ideal.

110
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.305
You can definitely get away with four.

111
00:05:54.305 --> 00:05:58.415
You can probably even get away with less,
you just have to wait a bit longer.

112
00:05:58.415 --> 00:06:00.650
Please make sure you have
Node js already installed.

113
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.060
I'm not gonna be covering
any Node.js stuff.

114
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.279
But we have to use NPM and
some of those tools.

115
00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:08.432
Parcell relies on it,
those kinds of things.

116
00:06:10.035 --> 00:06:15.114
I'm gonna say you need at least 12,
I don't think you get away with 10.

117
00:06:15.114 --> 00:06:20.894
I'll be using 16,
which is the LTS at the moment.

118
00:06:20.894 --> 00:06:22.884
But 17 I actually tried this was 17.

119
00:06:22.884 --> 00:06:24.686
I wrote most of course using node 17.

120
00:06:24.686 --> 00:06:26.089
So, all that stuff should work.

121
00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:29.190
Anyway, just be above 12,
probably be on 16.

122
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.079
That's my pitch for you.

123
00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:36.323
There's setup instructions here if
you need instructions for that.

124
00:06:36.323 --> 00:06:38.677
I will be using Visual Studio code.

125
00:06:38.677 --> 00:06:40.805
I used to be on
the Visual Studio Code team, so

126
00:06:40.805 --> 00:06:44.370
I'm very biased as to which editor
is far superior to the other ones.

127
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.039
Anyway, I will be showing you
some tips and tricks for VS code.

128
00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:50.697
I imagined much of it will work and
other editors but

129
00:06:50.697 --> 00:06:55.730
maybe try VS code cuz I will show you
some really cool things with that.

130
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.525
My font is Mona Lisa.

131
00:06:58.525 --> 00:07:03.049
It's not free, but
if you see me how using coligatures,

132
00:07:03.049 --> 00:07:07.304
which is combined symbols
that comes from Mona Lisa.

133
00:07:07.304 --> 00:07:10.468
You can also use Dank mono,
is another cool font.

134
00:07:10.468 --> 00:07:16.280
Or Microsoft's Cascadia code is free and
it has all these ligatures in it as well.

135
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.235
So, if you want to have a cool font,
I would suggest that one.

136
00:07:21.163 --> 00:07:24.648
By the way, the reason why I'm covering
all these things is cuz if I don't cover

137
00:07:24.648 --> 00:07:27.230
these things,
I get a billion questions about it later.

138
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:33.591
So, I'm just very upfront, this is
how I set up my coding environment.

139
00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:35.780
I just use start plus
the default VS code theme,

140
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.654
I haven't found one that I like better.

141
00:07:37.654 --> 00:07:39.382
So, I just keep using it.

142
00:07:39.382 --> 00:07:43.702
When I do switch I use
Sarah Dresdner's Night Owl.

143
00:07:43.702 --> 00:07:47.861
I just use the Mac OS built-in terminal,
but ITM2 is great.

144
00:07:47.861 --> 00:07:49.445
All Windows I use the Windows Terminal.

145
00:07:50.735 --> 00:07:53.592
And then I use
the vs.code-icons extension,

146
00:07:53.592 --> 00:07:57.101
which gives all the cool icons
inside of my VS code editor.

147
00:07:59.015 --> 00:08:02.020
I think that should cover everything
interesting about my coding In setup.

148
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.826
I usually keep it pretty vanilla
because I switch computers a lot and

149
00:08:05.826 --> 00:08:07.306
I hate setting things up.

150
00:08:07.306 --> 00:08:11.010
File issues, again,
everything on here is open source.

151
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:15.531
If you go to the complete intro to
react V7, this is the course website.

152
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:18.635
You can see all the lessons are in here.

153
00:08:18.635 --> 00:08:21.666
This is all built with Next.js
was actually built using React.

154
00:08:21.666 --> 00:08:24.305
Yeah, that's all in here
if you have issues or

155
00:08:24.305 --> 00:08:26.479
pull requests please make them here.

156
00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:29.526
I do get a lot of people that message
me on Twitter and LinkedIn and

157
00:08:29.526 --> 00:08:32.530
such I'm terrible at responding
to messages just so you know.

158
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.837
So, it's not that I'm ignoring you
it's that I'm ignoring everybody.

159
00:08:37.837 --> 00:08:39.074
Who am I?

160
00:08:39.074 --> 00:08:40.520
My name is Brian.

161
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.580
Probably got that by now.

162
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.730
Maybe didn't, if not here I am.

163
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.417
I work at stripe now.

164
00:08:45.417 --> 00:08:49.047
I am a product manager on developer
tools and developer experience.

165
00:08:49.047 --> 00:08:53.302
So, I work exclusively on tools
that developers will use,

166
00:08:53.302 --> 00:08:57.400
which means I end up writing
a lot of code on the day to day.

167
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.673
I own the stripe VS code extension, the
stripe CLI, the stripe server side SDK.

168
00:09:01.673 --> 00:09:06.313
So, if you're writing like no JS with
the stripe SDK is that's the stuff

169
00:09:06.313 --> 00:09:07.310
that I work on.

170
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.905
Just like other kinds of developer tools.

171
00:09:10.905 --> 00:09:14.281
Before that I worked on VS code and
Azure at Microsoft.

172
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:17.570
And before that I was a JavaScript
developer for a decade.

173
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:22.806
So, I did that for a long time before
switched into pm developer things.

174
00:09:22.806 --> 00:09:25.461
And I've worked at companies
like LinkedIn, Netflix, Reddit.

175
00:09:25.461 --> 00:09:27.600
I feel like if you go back from
my intro to React courses,

176
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.693
you can kind of see me like
wearing different hoodies or

177
00:09:29.693 --> 00:09:32.630
having different stickers on my laptop
from other companies that I worked.

178
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:33.993
It's like my resume.

179
00:09:33.993 --> 00:09:35.780
I should just send people
that instead of my resume.

180
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.234
It's a great idea.

181
00:09:38.234 --> 00:09:44.669
I wrote a lot of React at
basically all of these companies.

182
00:09:44.669 --> 00:09:48.123
But I launched red its first React,
that's one of my claims to fame.

183
00:09:48.123 --> 00:09:50.070
Actually, I think I
have the tweet up here.

184
00:09:52.713 --> 00:09:58.855
So, this is from July 28 2014, from Salt
Lake City, which is where I used to live.

185
00:09:58.855 --> 00:10:02.585
That we should read first
production code and React js.

186
00:10:02.585 --> 00:10:04.262
And there's like a bunch
of funny people in here.

187
00:10:04.262 --> 00:10:06.604
Like Matt said rescue this
guy runs React rally.

188
00:10:06.604 --> 00:10:10.333
There's a bunch of people that are now
big names in the React community.

189
00:10:10.333 --> 00:10:13.307
That's really cool I've
heard of this React thing.

190
00:10:13.307 --> 00:10:17.400
So, that's my claim to fame.

191
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.331
I loved it.

192
00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:19.283
Well, let me rephrase that.

193
00:10:19.283 --> 00:10:23.517
At first I hated it, which is how it's
really good because you don't like it

194
00:10:23.517 --> 00:10:27.110
at first and then you learn it's wait,
this is actually great.

195
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.110
And I'll show you why I
didn't like it at first.

196
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:32.042
And then when I kinda get over that
initial hump of this looks gross I was,

197
00:10:32.042 --> 00:10:33.448
okay, this is actually amazing.

198
00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:37.139
Cool.

199
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.974
So, I've been using it for yeah,
basically eight years now.

200
00:10:43.974 --> 00:10:46.820
And I'm gonna show you why I
like React still to this day.

201
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.223
And I've worked in a bunch of other
frameworks like, I had an Angular js app.

202
00:10:51.223 --> 00:10:58.502
Like Angular pre one app in
production until like two weeks ago.

203
00:10:58.502 --> 00:11:00.554
And I wrote that at Reddit as well.

204
00:11:00.554 --> 00:11:02.515
So, it was in production for
almost a decade.

205
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.997
So, I wrote a lot of angular as well
at LinkedIn I wrote a lot of Ember.

206
00:11:07.997 --> 00:11:09.779
So, I have worked with a lot
of these frameworks and

207
00:11:09.779 --> 00:11:11.404
this is still my go to
the other ones are great.

208
00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:13.126
And then they have great
reasons to choose them.

209
00:11:13.126 --> 00:11:15.826
And I'm definitely not
going to popoo them.

210
00:11:15.826 --> 00:11:19.792
I'll just tell you the ones that I chose.

211
00:11:19.792 --> 00:11:22.841
So, I live in Seattle now,
and quite like it.

212
00:11:22.841 --> 00:11:26.811
I've come in Minneapolis enough
now that I feel like I live here.

213
00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:30.589
When I'm not playing games or
working out, or any things like that,

214
00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:33.992
to hang out with my wife and
I just had a kid and he's very cute.

215
00:11:33.992 --> 00:11:38.929
And I have a cute dog and I like to
exercise and I play Over watch and

216
00:11:38.929 --> 00:11:40.588
Dota really poorly.

217
00:11:40.588 --> 00:11:43.343
And I drink a lot of scotch,
and IPAs, and coffee.

218
00:11:43.343 --> 00:11:48.710
As you can see here, I think this is
cup of coffee number three for me.

219
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.200
That's me.

220
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.347
If you didn't know from my face
that's also me on the website.

221
00:11:54.347 --> 00:11:57.823
Among the socials, please find me there.

222
00:11:57.823 --> 00:12:03.036
If you start this repo then that strokes
my ego I'd be very happy about that.

223
00:12:03.036 --> 00:12:05.236
But it also like makes it
like one of the rising ones,

224
00:12:05.236 --> 00:12:06.943
which I means more people can find them.

225
00:12:06.943 --> 00:12:07.695
Which I think is great.

226
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:14.064
So, let's talk about just one
kind of housekeeping item here.

227
00:12:14.064 --> 00:12:15.890
There are two Repos for this class.

228
00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:20.718
There's the website one, which one has one
already showed you if there's mistakes on

229
00:12:20.718 --> 00:12:23.578
the course website,
go here to fix those, right?

230
00:12:23.578 --> 00:12:26.988
And then I have here of
the example projects,

231
00:12:26.988 --> 00:12:31.310
which you can see is complete
intro to React V7 project.

232
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:32.906
And you can see here,

233
00:12:32.906 --> 00:12:37.717
it's folder by folder of step by
step of what we're about to do.

234
00:12:37.717 --> 00:12:42.530
This is for both the intro and
intermediate.

235
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.327
You can see it goes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

236
00:12:45.327 --> 00:12:49.912
And you'll see at the bottom of my course
notes, hey, we've hit this checkpoint and

237
00:12:49.912 --> 00:12:52.282
it'll have the Repo in that state, right?

238
00:12:52.282 --> 00:12:54.990
So, the first thing we're gonna do is,
we're gonna do this one, right?

239
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.503
And then, after that we'll do this one.

240
00:12:57.503 --> 00:13:01.862
But each one of us like the standalone
project of that particular step

241
00:13:01.862 --> 00:13:02.921
that we're in.

242
00:13:02.921 --> 00:13:04.173
So, a couple of things here.

243
00:13:04.173 --> 00:13:09.497
One, if you like fall behind just go
grab it off at the course website,

244
00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:11.859
crown it and start from there.

245
00:13:11.859 --> 00:13:14.010
There is no cheating in here, right?

246
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:15.200
This is all just about learning.

247
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.038
So, if you're succeeding in learning
then you're doing the right thing.

248
00:13:18.038 --> 00:13:19.632
And if you're not succeeding in learning,

249
00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.407
then you're not doing the right thing,
right?

250
00:13:21.407 --> 00:13:24.060
So, you just gotta have to optimize for
that.

251
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.858
You'll have to learn MPM and style
every time you switch folders, right?

252
00:13:26.858 --> 00:13:29.626
But I'll just say go crown
that Repo right now.

253
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.492
And then, if when you need it, it's there.

254
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.321
So, if there's mistake in the code here,
you'll have to come fix it here.

255
00:13:37.321 --> 00:13:40.297
Or just what's easy to probably
just to leave an issue and

256
00:13:40.297 --> 00:13:43.800
then I can go and
fix cuz I have to fix it multiple places.

257
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.018
&gt;&gt; Do you prefer Webpack or Parcel?

258
00:13:48.597 --> 00:13:52.630
&gt;&gt; That is a interesting question,
do I prefer Parcel or Webpack?

259
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.363
For teaching hands down,

260
00:13:54.363 --> 00:13:58.390
no question Parcel is like
God's gift to teachers, right?

261
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:02.258
Because we don't have to configure
anything and it just works.

262
00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:07.409
If I'm gonna make a super large scale
production app that I'm gonna maintain for

263
00:14:07.409 --> 00:14:08.096
five years

264
00:14:09.817 --> 00:14:14.755
I might start with parcel until I needed
more configuration than it offers.

265
00:14:14.755 --> 00:14:17.700
And at that point I'd probably
move to something like ES build.

266
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.727
Or Vito VT or
whatever you want to call it, or Webpack.

267
00:14:23.727 --> 00:14:27.022
I guess it just depends on the nice thing
about Webpack is it has such a mature

268
00:14:27.022 --> 00:14:27.819
ecosystem that.

269
00:14:27.819 --> 00:14:29.774
If there's something you
need to do with Webpack,

270
00:14:29.774 --> 00:14:32.010
I guarantee you there's
four plugins out there.

271
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:33.581
And hopefully at least two of them work.

272
00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:34.576
I have a lot of respect for

273
00:14:34.576 --> 00:14:37.590
all the build tools because it's
such a hard problem to solve.

274
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:39.516
And they all have their uses.

275
00:14:39.516 --> 00:14:42.428
So, down here and you can click
Next to go to the next section.

276
00:14:42.428 --> 00:14:47.399
Or you can also just click here and
go back to the beginning.

277
00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:50.830
So, the one thing I'll point out for
the course website here,

278
00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.464
I intentionally put up here.

279
00:14:52.464 --> 00:14:56.194
This is the lesson that we're on, and
this is the section that we're on.

280
00:14:56.194 --> 00:14:59.492
So, if you get lost and
you don't know where I am in the course,

281
00:14:59.492 --> 00:15:00.873
you can just look up here.

282
00:15:00.873 --> 00:15:05.213
And you can see I was on No Frills React,
Pure React.

283
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:08.951
So, that's up there.

284
00:15:08.951 --> 00:15:11.784
So, you can make sure you can always
orient yourself to where I am in

285
00:15:11.784 --> 00:15:12.350
the course.
