WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.707
So now, let's go make it,
we used a hook on purpose so

2
00:00:04.707 --> 00:00:07.383
that we can set it later, right?

3
00:00:07.383 --> 00:00:12.760
So let's go into SearchParams,
and we're gonna make it settable.

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.080
So in Details,

5
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.630
We are going to do grab
the setTheme out of here now,

6
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.088
not Details, we're in SearchParams.

7
00:00:29.088 --> 00:00:34.071
Up here at the top,
grab setTheme out of here as well.

8
00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:35.912
And then we're gonna
make an HTML dropdown.

9
00:00:35.912 --> 00:00:39.407
So put this one just
underneath breed here.

10
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:50.180
We put a label htmlFor="theme".

11
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.979
It's gonna be called Theme.

12
00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:56.267
It's gonna be a select.

13
00:00:59.974 --> 00:01:05.512
Value = theme, onChange = e,

14
00:01:05.512 --> 00:01:10.845
and we're gonna call setTheme

15
00:01:10.845 --> 00:01:15.365
with e.target.value.

16
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.511
And we're gonna do onBlur as well.

17
00:01:32.337 --> 00:01:37.296
And then you can put, I don't know,
four or five options in here.

18
00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:42.635
I had value="peru",
which is my favorite CSS color.

19
00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:54.562
Here, you can put darkblue cuz
that's what we had, darkblue.

20
00:01:54.562 --> 00:01:57.445
chartreuse, that's everyone's
favorite color, right?

21
00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:11.980
And mediumorchid,
it's another greatly named color.

22
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.486
There's some truly ridiculous CSS names

23
00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:22.712
Okay, so now,

24
00:02:22.712 --> 00:02:28.458
we should have an HTML dropdown of
various different colors that we can do.

25
00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:42.354
And I mean, the world's your oyster
here if you wanted to do #333 of a,

26
00:02:42.354 --> 00:02:46.944
you were saying before fog dog, right?

27
00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:53.857
Kind of, have fun with it.

28
00:02:53.857 --> 00:02:55.476
So now, we can go back to the homepage.

29
00:02:55.476 --> 00:02:58.084
We now have a theme drop down here, right?

30
00:03:00.771 --> 00:03:02.530
I was right, it is orange Fog Dog.

31
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.420
Medium Orchid, Chartreuse, Peru,
Dark Blue, all various CSS colors.

32
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.350
So notice that this one's changing.

33
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.717
But what would you expect if
I go over to the adopt page?

34
00:03:17.717 --> 00:03:23.239
Notice that this button stays
the same color, all right?

35
00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.028
So if I go back to the theme perotta here.

36
00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:35.122
Now, think about this for a second.

37
00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:45.169
Let's say I just kept track of this as
local state to the SearchParams page.

38
00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:50.687
If I navigate it to Details, so
it totally unmounts the SearchParams page,

39
00:03:50.687 --> 00:03:53.460
and totally mounts the Details page.

40
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.094
And then I went back to
the SearchParams page.

41
00:03:58.094 --> 00:04:00.382
It would blow away that state, right,
because it's totally unmounting.

42
00:04:00.382 --> 00:04:04.540
So all the state gets blown away when
it gets removed from the Dom, right?

43
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.530
But because we're keeping track
of this at the app level, right?

44
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.143
When does app.js ever get unmounted?

45
00:04:11.143 --> 00:04:14.884
Never, it's never unmounted,
it's always mounted, right?

46
00:04:14.884 --> 00:04:18.625
We never changed this,
which is where it gets rendered.

47
00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:22.687
So therefore, this state never goes away.

48
00:04:22.687 --> 00:04:24.210
This is always valid state,

49
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.383
whereas every time that I go
from Details to SearchParams,

50
00:04:27.383 --> 00:04:31.269
any state that I had in Details is gone,
and it's gone forever, right?

51
00:04:33.338 --> 00:04:37.398
So this is kind of a useful way
to have long lips state as well.

52
00:04:37.398 --> 00:04:43.792
That's another good reason to use context.

53
00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:52.408
And this is a very silly use case for
context.

54
00:04:52.408 --> 00:04:56.331
But it was fun,
cuz is it good to have multiple context or

55
00:04:56.331 --> 00:05:01.270
is it good to just jam everything
into a Redux-like store of context?

56
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.783
It depends,
having just an entire context for

57
00:05:06.783 --> 00:05:11.674
just the theme of your button,
probably a bit on the silly side in

58
00:05:11.674 --> 00:05:15.403
terms of you could probably
do a bit more with it.

59
00:05:15.403 --> 00:05:20.680
I would have one store for
all of my theme-related information.

60
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.139
So that could be,
I don't know, colors, names,

61
00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.200
maybe it's internationalization strings.

62
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.728
I don't know,

63
00:05:29.728 --> 00:05:32.970
everything that's kinda related to
that probably shove into one thing.

64
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.340
But I tried to have data stores for
like data.

65
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.250
That's maybe a good way of putting it.

66
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.177
There's a balance between way too
small and having 10 trillion contexts,

67
00:05:46.177 --> 00:05:50.288
or way too big that you've
basically recreated Redux, right?

68
00:05:53.911 --> 00:05:56.796
Kinda gotta balance it there, yeah.

69
00:05:56.796 --> 00:06:00.460
&gt;&gt; I might have just missed something, but

70
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.172
when we were establishing the hook for
theme context, sorry,

71
00:06:06.172 --> 00:06:11.475
excuse me, for Theme and
setTheme on SearchParams.js.

72
00:06:11.475 --> 00:06:15.470
I was thinking that you had said,
yeah, so setTheme there.

73
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.910
I was thinking that you had said,
we didn't need to include that.

74
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.270
And I missed why exactly
it is required after all.

75
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.681
I'm also curious, for example, why is
it highlighted blue instead of yellow?

76
00:06:25.681 --> 00:06:31.903
What's the difference there,
and how are you using this?

77
00:06:31.903 --> 00:06:34.340
&gt;&gt; Well,
let's start with why we included it.

78
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:40.062
So when we were just reading off of it,
and were not doing any sort of setting,

79
00:06:40.062 --> 00:06:45.537
so the first step that we did here,
that's when we only included a theme.

80
00:06:45.537 --> 00:06:49.737
But as soon as we started doing setTheme
down here, then we had to go include it.

81
00:06:52.045 --> 00:06:55.411
SetTheme, okay?

82
00:06:55.411 --> 00:07:00.379
Are you asking why this one is set to blue
instead of yellow like the rest of these?

83
00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:01.705
&gt;&gt; Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

84
00:07:06.804 --> 00:07:11.666
&gt;&gt; It's probably something to
do with the typing cuz this is

85
00:07:11.666 --> 00:07:15.119
a React.Dispatch, which you can get.

86
00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:19.804
This is what I was telling you that
this will include types now, right?

87
00:07:19.804 --> 00:07:22.539
So even though that we're
not using TypeScript,

88
00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:26.261
this actually is using TypeScript
to figure out what the types are.

89
00:07:26.261 --> 00:07:31.133
So if I went into, I'll not use
breed this, into ThemeContext, and

90
00:07:31.133 --> 00:07:32.561
I just delete this.

91
00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:39.218
If I go back to SearchParams here, now,

92
00:07:39.218 --> 00:07:45.775
it's gonna say this is any, and
I don't know what it is, right?

93
00:07:45.775 --> 00:07:52.139
So, I was answering a different question,
that's why we do that.

94
00:07:55.201 --> 00:07:56.686
The way that you would get
that to actually be correct

95
00:07:56.686 --> 00:07:58.327
is that we'd actually have
to be in TypeScript, right?

96
00:07:58.327 --> 00:08:01.914
And we would have to say that
this is a React.Dispatch.

97
00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:06.355
And my guess is the way that the language
server works is that if it has a specific

98
00:08:06.355 --> 00:08:09.852
type, it does that, and
it shows it as a different color, but

99
00:08:09.852 --> 00:08:11.970
it depends on the theme first of all.

100
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.435
And secondly, the language server and
how it gets tagged.

101
00:08:15.435 --> 00:08:18.809
That's probably way more in depth
than you wanted to know about it, but

102
00:08:18.809 --> 00:08:19.829
I think that's why.

103
00:08:19.829 --> 00:08:29.451
It's probably because it's a function,
Whereas this is a type thing.

104
00:08:29.451 --> 00:08:30.435
Anyway, I don't know.
