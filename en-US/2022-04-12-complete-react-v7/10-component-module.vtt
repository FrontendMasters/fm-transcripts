00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.511
All right, so head to app.js, and

2
00:00:05.511 --> 00:00:11.470
we're going to movePpet into its own file.

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.702
So you can just cut that
whole bit of code here.

4
00:00:15.702 --> 00:00:20.440
Create a new file here,
save it, call it pet.js.

5
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.050
Again, that'll be inside
your source directory.

6
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.880
You're going to import React from 'react'.

7
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.719
And then you're going to
export default pet like that.

8
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.490
So we have a nice little module now,
because we have Parcel now, right?

9
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.740
We can split our code up into
various different pieces.

10
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.120
You could not do that before, right?

11
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.820
Because nothing was
bundling it back together.

12
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.970
And now the Pet's gone, it's like, hey, I
don't know what this Pet thing is anymore.

13
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.848
And all you have to do is say,
import Pet from './Pet'.

14
00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:59.035
One thing I'll just kinda
throw out really quick.

15
00:00:59.035 --> 00:01:03.676
Notice that I do use capital letters
here to kind of correspond to this

16
00:01:03.676 --> 00:01:05.044
being a component.

17
00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:09.744
It's not required, and in fact,
most, well, I won't say most,

18
00:01:09.744 --> 00:01:12.925
some file systems, are case insensitive.

19
00:01:12.925 --> 00:01:17.189
So do not rely on case to be sensitive.

20
00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.859
I might have caused downtime at Netflix
one time by relying on it to be case

21
00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:22.711
sensitive.

22
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:25.379
That's true,
I got in trouble for that one.

23
00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:27.160
But just know that's why you do it.

24
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.220
But I see people make that lowercase.

25
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.550
That's totally up to you,
it's a stylistic decision.

26
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.502
So notice that I called App.js and
Pet.js with a capital letter,

27
00:01:35.502 --> 00:01:38.830
that's just to correspondent
to it being a component.

28
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.524
It's not required,
that's its stylistic decision.

29
00:01:43.527 --> 00:01:46.560
I believe Linux file systems
are case insensitive.

30
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.063
Or Windows,
I can never keep that straight.

31
00:01:49.063 --> 00:01:52.687
It doesn't matter,
one of them is case insensitive, and so

32
00:01:52.687 --> 00:01:56.180
just never rely on case to be
sensitive with file systems.

33
00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.888
But these ones I do call capital letter
just to signal to future Brian this is

34
00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:01.793
a component.

35
00:02:01.793 --> 00:02:04.680
If it is not a component,
then I will make it lowercase.

36
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.130
But some people will do that,
some people don't.

37
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.488
So one thing I do wanna call out here,

38
00:02:10.488 --> 00:02:14.836
for the rest of this class,
please be using localhost:1234.

39
00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:18.540
Do not be using the file
version that we have open here.

40
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.770
Go ahead and just close that one.
