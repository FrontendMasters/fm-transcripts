1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.560
Let's start writing some React.

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.169
I want you to create a new directory
wherever you feel like creating it.

3
00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:09.203
You can create it on your
desktop if you want to.

4
00:00:12.694 --> 00:00:15.751
We're gonna be writing a pet adoption app,

5
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:20.410
cuz I like animals as you
probably guessed that by now.

6
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.798
And if you're gonna be
looking at something all day,

7
00:00:22.798 --> 00:00:24.080
it might as well be puppies.

8
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.664
I think that's good solid science there.

9
00:00:26.664 --> 00:00:31.753
The name of it, it's gonna be adopt me,
cuz I'm creative.

10
00:00:31.753 --> 00:00:35.840
And then we're just gonna
open this in VS Code.

11
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.330
So I'm in VS Code here, and I am going to
create a new directory here called src.

12
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.851
That's not a React thing.

13
00:00:45.851 --> 00:00:50.076
That's just what I always call
where I keep all of my code,

14
00:00:50.076 --> 00:00:53.799
I think that's a habit
from probably high school.

15
00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:56.148
Anyway, there's no reason
you have to do it that way,

16
00:00:56.148 --> 00:00:57.537
it's just the way that I did it.

17
00:00:57.537 --> 00:01:01.606
Also you get a really cool icon with
it if you use the VS Code's icons, and

18
00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:02.890
I like the cool icons.

19
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.560
Icon driven development,
that's what [LAUGH] this is.

20
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.872
So in your src directory inside
of your base project here,

21
00:01:09.872 --> 00:01:15.780
we're gonna create another file and
we're gonna call it index.html, okay?

22
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.726
So inside the source directory,
we made a file, it's called index.html.

23
00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:24.611
Another fun little a trick for

24
00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:29.434
VS Code here, you can say html:5.

25
00:01:29.434 --> 00:01:30.837
And then you can hit that and

26
00:01:30.837 --> 00:01:33.840
it'll just scaffold out
an entire HTML document for you.

27
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.929
This is called Emmet.

28
00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.279
I'm not gonna be really using Emmet very
much in this course, but you can look it

29
00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:43.238
up if you want to, E-M-M-E-T,
and it's just built into VS Code.

30
00:01:45.813 --> 00:01:51.160
Okay, we're gonna call this Adopt Me,
you can leave all the meta stuff there.

31
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.080
It's always good stuff to have.

32
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.588
We're gonna make a link here.

33
00:01:55.588 --> 00:02:00.404
And it's gonna be rel equals stylesheet

34
00:02:00.404 --> 00:02:05.360
cuz we're gonna put some css in here, and

35
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:12.027
the href is going to be
equal to ./style.css, okay?

36
00:02:12.027 --> 00:02:16.112
Here in our body, we're gonna have a div.

37
00:02:16.112 --> 00:02:19.911
And I'm gonna change
this to be two spaces.

38
00:02:23.928 --> 00:02:28.752
Definitely, I know someone's gonna be
like, does Brian prefer tabs or spaces?

39
00:02:28.752 --> 00:02:32.088
I just use spaces,
I don't have an opinion on it, and

40
00:02:32.088 --> 00:02:35.292
I definitely don't wanna
argue with you about it.

41
00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:41.308
My only thing that's less favorite than
talking about is arguing about this stuff,

42
00:02:41.308 --> 00:02:43.607
so, anyway div id= "root".

43
00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:51.718
Okay, and we're gonna put not rendered
here, so that if we ever see not rendered,

44
00:02:51.718 --> 00:02:55.054
we'll know that our app didn't
successfully render, right?

45
00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.050
But eventually, our React app is going
to replace what's inside of this root.

46
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.902
Okay, and
then we're gonna put two URLs in here or

47
00:03:04.902 --> 00:03:10.234
two script tags in here that are going
to be loading React off the CDN.

48
00:03:10.234 --> 00:03:12.868
If you don't wanna copy this line for
line with me,

49
00:03:12.868 --> 00:03:14.969
you can just copy from the course notes.

50
00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.643
That's probably what I
would do if I were you.

51
00:03:17.643 --> 00:03:27.410
So I'm gonna script
src="https://unpkg.com/react@17.0.2/umd/r-

52
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:36.032
eact.development.js".

53
00:03:36.032 --> 00:03:40.733
Dev, and you have to spell it correctly,
you have to know how to spell it correctly

54
00:03:40.733 --> 00:03:43.405
and then you have to do it,
development.js.

55
00:03:43.405 --> 00:03:49.574
Okay, we're gonna put the same
thing underneath it but

56
00:03:49.574 --> 00:03:56.410
it's gonna be react-dom, and
then again here react-dom.

57
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.735
So you have to change dom here twice,
right, once there and once there.

58
00:04:02.735 --> 00:04:05.224
It does not matter what order they go in.

59
00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:13.090
So unpkg basically allows you to
load things in from NPM via a CDN.

60
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.929
That's all its entire purpose is.

61
00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:18.104
This is the package name,
that's the version number, and

62
00:04:18.104 --> 00:04:20.340
then this is just the file system, okay?

63
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.373
And then underneath that,
we're gonna put a script tag.

64
00:04:22.373 --> 00:04:26.808
We're gonna write code here directly in
our HTML document, because we're going to

65
00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:31.420
do the most bare bones HelloWorld React
application that you possibly can, okay?

66
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.670
So I saved that.

67
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.680
I'm gonna just go open
this file in my browser.

68
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.672
Here in Firefox, you can just say Cmd+O or
Ctrl+O depending on what operating

69
00:04:41.672 --> 00:04:45.560
system you're in, or
you can just say File &gt; Open File here.

70
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.035
And I'm going to go find it.

71
00:04:48.035 --> 00:04:52.540
I have it on my Desktop,
adopt me &gt; source &gt; index.html, and

72
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.262
I'm just gonna open it in my browser.

73
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.551
So you can see here I have not rendered
with a very beautiful background.

74
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:02.044
But as you can see here,

75
00:05:02.044 --> 00:05:07.060
if I open my dev tools,
You can see that React is now defined.

76
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.130
And ReactDOM is now defined.

77
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.409
And my favorite thing that's on
React is these secret things called

78
00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.813
SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_B-
E_FIRED.

79
00:05:21.901 --> 00:05:23.948
[LAUGH] That's been there for a while.

80
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:31.489
I've used it and I haven't gotten fired,
so, It's just like stuff that they allow

81
00:05:31.489 --> 00:05:35.460
you to do, performance checks and you
can check internals of how it's working.

82
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.520
I'm pretty sure that that's for
a Facebook thing anyway.

83
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.329
First question that I know is at
least on some people's mind is Brian,

84
00:05:42.329 --> 00:05:45.698
why are you not using React 18,
why are we using React 17?

85
00:05:45.698 --> 00:05:49.190
As of filming,
React 18 is not officially out yet.

86
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.070
It's still in release candidate.

87
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.380
And I have a big thing that I
do not teach Alpha software.

88
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.880
I did it once,
it hugely bit me in the butt.

89
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.599
I'm never doing it again.

90
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.753
So and the other thing and the point of
this course is that if you're learning

91
00:06:02.753 --> 00:06:05.940
React right now, you probably
wanna write React code right now.

92
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.742
And the React code that you wanna write
right now is the one that's out, right?

93
00:06:08.742 --> 00:06:10.133
So if you go work at a company or

94
00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:14.229
you already work at a company that's
deploying React, they're writing React 17.

95
00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.280
So this is gonna be useful for you today.

96
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.866
As soon as React 18 comes out, we'll come
back, we'll do React, intro React V8.

97
00:06:20.866 --> 00:06:24.638
React 18 does change a bit of stuff but

98
00:06:24.638 --> 00:06:30.594
the general paradigm of writing
components does not change.

99
00:06:30.594 --> 00:06:32.232
So you're good to learn this,

100
00:06:32.232 --> 00:06:35.193
React 18 will just be a little
sprinkle on top of that.

101
00:06:35.193 --> 00:06:39.161
Pretty standard HTML document, writing
a root div, we have two script tags.

102
00:06:39.161 --> 00:06:42.208
You might ask,
why is there react and react dom,

103
00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:44.521
why is that two separate libraries?

104
00:06:44.521 --> 00:06:47.579
I'm sure many of you are familiar
with React Native, right?

105
00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:52.384
So the reason why they do this is
this React package is shared between

106
00:06:52.384 --> 00:06:57.124
React Native, React DOM,
React ART, React 3D, React 360.

107
00:06:57.124 --> 00:07:02.285
There's a bunch of renderers or
underpinning layers for React.

108
00:07:02.285 --> 00:07:05.653
And so they build this one React
package that they all use.

109
00:07:05.653 --> 00:07:08.430
And then, this is actually
where most of the code is,

110
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.852
I think this is like 3 kilobytes and
this is like 40 kilobytes.

111
00:07:11.852 --> 00:07:15.367
This is actually what handles all
the rendering to the DOM, right,

112
00:07:15.367 --> 00:07:18.584
it actually handles document.write
kind of stuff, right?

113
00:07:18.584 --> 00:07:20.023
And if you swap that out for

114
00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:24.428
React Native it'll handle all of the
writing to web views and things like that.

115
00:07:24.428 --> 00:07:29.179
Or I guess it's an interface to the IOS,
but whatever.

116
00:07:29.179 --> 00:07:33.762
Not a React Native course, you should take
the Frontend Masters React Native course,

117
00:07:33.762 --> 00:07:34.590
which is cool.

118
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.749
So let's go grab our stylesheet.

119
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:42.453
So if we go back over
to my GitHub repo here,

120
00:07:42.453 --> 00:07:50.578
complete intro to React V7 project
one that we were showing you earlier.

121
00:07:50.578 --> 00:07:53.022
Or another way to get there is from here.

122
00:07:53.022 --> 00:07:57.055
If you go from here to pure
React which is where we are.

123
00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.468
And you scroll down,

124
00:08:00.952 --> 00:08:04.318
Here to this blue box that says
click here to get the style sheet.

125
00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:07.066
If you just click on that,
this will give you the raw output here.

126
00:08:07.066 --> 00:08:11.701
So if you just Cmd+A copy or
Ctrl+A all, right, and

127
00:08:11.701 --> 00:08:17.170
then we're just gonna make a new
file here called style.css.

128
00:08:19.644 --> 00:08:22.330
You just paste that business and
you just wrote all the CSS for the course,

129
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.075
congratulations.

130
00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:28.317
I call it the stack overflow
way of writing code.

131
00:08:28.317 --> 00:08:35.663
So again, this is not a CSS course, this
is meant to be easy, not necessarily good.

132
00:08:35.663 --> 00:08:38.486
[LAUGH] But
if you follow all of my class names,

133
00:08:38.486 --> 00:08:40.873
you'll get all the styling for free.

134
00:08:40.873 --> 00:08:45.548
So now if you refresh your page,
you should see it should

135
00:08:45.548 --> 00:08:50.535
change a little bit, right,
you see cute little animals.

136
00:08:50.535 --> 00:08:51.968
So, so far you should see some style but

137
00:08:51.968 --> 00:08:53.977
you should not see anything
rendered to your page yet.
