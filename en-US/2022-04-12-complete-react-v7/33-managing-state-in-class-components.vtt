1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
So the nice thing now by doing
it this way I can guarantee

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.244
that this dot props dot
images is always in array.

3
00:00:09.244 --> 00:00:11.469
100% of time is always going to be array.

4
00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.375
Which is nice because now I don't have
to have like defensive checks is this

5
00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:18.422
an array do it this way is it
not an array don't do it right.

6
00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:19.754
No one likes code like that.

7
00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:20.964
It's nice if you can just guarantee.

8
00:00:20.964 --> 00:00:23.574
Always gonna be an array,
I can always treat it like an array.

9
00:00:28.044 --> 00:00:32.104
Otherwise here in my render method,
I have to say if this dot state dot

10
00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:36.523
images otherwise make an array,
otherwise use the one that exists there.

11
00:00:36.523 --> 00:00:37.320
Got this now.

12
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.018
I just get to always assume cool
images always going to be an array.

13
00:00:43.398 --> 00:00:43.945
Okay?

14
00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:49.799
Const active equals this.state const

15
00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:55.482
images quals this dot props, right?

16
00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:59.990
Upon activate of our state and
images out of our props.

17
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.398
I kinda put these side by side so
you can kinda think about for a second,

18
00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:08.609
state belongs to carousel and
carousel can change state, right?

19
00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:11.069
It can modify its own state.

20
00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:15.856
Props comes from something
being passed in.

21
00:01:15.856 --> 00:01:21.105
So in this case, it's either gonna
come from the default props, right?

22
00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:24.908
Which is basically gonna be,
if I get no props give me this, or

23
00:01:24.908 --> 00:01:27.041
it's gonna come from the parent.

24
00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:30.945
Props are immutable, you cannot change
them because they come from the parent.

25
00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:32.676
This is our one way data flow, right?

26
00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:36.162
This should jive with what I've
already taught you so far, right?

27
00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:39.521
You don't change the props that
come in from the parameters, right?

28
00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:40.824
But for function components.

29
00:01:40.824 --> 00:01:45.794
Same thing here, you don't modify
the props that come in from the parent.

30
00:01:45.794 --> 00:01:50.954
It's one way data flow thing, okay.

31
00:01:50.954 --> 00:01:57.633
Return, And then here we're just
gonna write a bit of markup.

32
00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:01.822
Div class name equals carousel.

33
00:02:04.235 --> 00:02:08.337
And here we're gonna put an image,

34
00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:12.863
source equals images active, right?

35
00:02:12.863 --> 00:02:15.384
This is gonna be The Active
is what we get for

36
00:02:15.384 --> 00:02:19.529
the state's gonna be the index of
whatever thing they've selected.

37
00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:23.108
And the all you probably
have better all Texas but

38
00:02:23.108 --> 00:02:26.518
I'm just going to have animal for
the moment.

39
00:02:26.518 --> 00:02:31.403
Div, class name equals

40
00:02:31.403 --> 00:02:35.560
carousel smaller.

41
00:02:37.676 --> 00:02:41.680
And then here,
we're gonna have images.map.

42
00:02:44.207 --> 00:02:48.465
And then we're gonna have,
we're gonna take in photo and index.

43
00:02:55.288 --> 00:02:57.769
Okay, and
then we're gonna put an image here.

44
00:03:00.316 --> 00:03:04.379
Key={photo}.

45
00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:10.463
Src={photo} Class Name equals.

46
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.236
So if it's the actively selected photo,

47
00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:18.296
we wanna make it give it an active class,
right?

48
00:03:18.296 --> 00:03:23.334
So we're gonna say index
triple equals active.

49
00:03:23.334 --> 00:03:25.753
And if it's active,
give it an active class.

50
00:03:25.753 --> 00:03:27.919
If it's not active, don't give it a class.

51
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.859
And the alt is gonna be equal to
something like animal thumbnail.

52
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.412
Okay?

53
00:03:51.715 --> 00:03:52.474
So, so far,

54
00:03:52.474 --> 00:03:57.258
we haven't given any interactivity has
no ability to switch which one selected.

55
00:03:57.258 --> 00:04:00.741
But this probably should render
pretty okay at the moment.

56
00:04:06.321 --> 00:04:10.703
So let's go do that,
let's go make that work.

57
00:04:10.703 --> 00:04:12.925
I need you to pop over
to your details page.

58
00:04:17.985 --> 00:04:20.684
And in your details page,

59
00:04:20.684 --> 00:04:25.721
we're going to import
carousel from carousel.

60
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:32.267
Here in your de structuring
we got to pull out images.

61
00:04:32.267 --> 00:04:37.101
And the first component inside
of DEV div dot detail so

62
00:04:37.101 --> 00:04:41.194
right here we're going
to drop it Carousel.

63
00:04:42.697 --> 00:04:46.542
And we're gonna say images=(images).

64
00:04:51.442 --> 00:04:53.372
Okay, so I import the carousel at the top.

65
00:04:53.372 --> 00:04:58.129
I pulled images out here on line 22
in the structuring statement here.

66
00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:03.050
And then I just dropped
the carousel component

67
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.725
here above all the rest of the stuff,
okay?

68
00:05:07.725 --> 00:05:13.295
So now you might need to
start your server again.

69
00:05:19.011 --> 00:05:25.006
There we go and we put the nice
that little carousel there.

70
00:05:25.006 --> 00:05:32.368
Let's go, if you click on the one
with Luna, Luna has several pictures.

71
00:05:32.368 --> 00:05:36.226
So notice this one's a little bit
different this is because it has

72
00:05:36.226 --> 00:05:39.956
the active class right so
it has like an old, opacity set on it.

73
00:05:39.956 --> 00:05:42.039
But it doesn't have any interactivity yet,
right?

74
00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:43.733
I can't click on these and
I won't change it.

75
00:05:43.733 --> 00:05:45.139
We have to go add that part.

76
00:05:50.023 --> 00:05:54.918
Cool, if you're having weird issues
with parcel at the moment or

77
00:05:54.918 --> 00:06:00.978
just what you either start and stop your
server and that obviously worked for me.

78
00:06:00.978 --> 00:06:02.362
If that didn't work for

79
00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:06.246
me, then I would go delete parcel cache,
and I would delete dist.

80
00:06:06.246 --> 00:06:09.929
Cuz those are generated files from
parcel and then rerun it again.

81
00:06:11.567 --> 00:06:19.153
And just to show you how to do that dot
parcel cache, just sometimes node modules.

82
00:06:19.153 --> 00:06:20.103
You shouldn't have to do that.

83
00:06:20.103 --> 00:06:22.464
I haven't had to do that in a while.

84
00:06:22.464 --> 00:06:23.862
But I would do it that way.

85
00:06:23.862 --> 00:06:25.612
And then I would just
say npm run dev again.

86
00:06:25.612 --> 00:06:29.940
It'll take a bit longer to start up,
so start totally from scratch, right?

87
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.558
And then you should end up
with something working again.

88
00:06:33.558 --> 00:06:36.391
Particularly when you modify
Babel files like it's finicky.

89
00:06:36.391 --> 00:06:41.870
That's where that whenever you modify
Babel, or like any like those config

90
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:47.880
files for your build processes, it's a
good idea to just start over from scratch.
