00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.316
So just to give you I guess, that same
explanation kind of in a diagram form,

2
00:00:07.316 --> 00:00:11.439
there's scenes, scenes of game objects.

3
00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:15.380
And the game objects can have any
number of components attached.

4
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.220
They'll always have at least one though,

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.580
because every game object
has a transform component.

6
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.790
So we're finally getting
into actually using Unity.

7
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.794
I know that was like a lot of
expository information but

8
00:00:30.794 --> 00:00:34.110
there's a lot to know
without making games.

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.733
So we're going to just use
primitive shapes for our game,

10
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:45.256
and we just need a cube that's
going to be our game board.

11
00:00:45.256 --> 00:00:50.536
And then we're going to have spheres for
our player, the opponent and

12
00:00:50.536 --> 00:00:57.430
the collectible, which were the little
purple spheres that I showed earlier.

13
00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.165
And we're going to place
these in the game world.

14
00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:06.329
So I've written out the values here but
I'll go ahead and

15
00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:10.600
actually place these in unity and
show you how that works.

16
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.949
So let's switch over and

17
00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:19.530
I'm going to open up
the scene view here so

18
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.687
I can see what's in the scene.

19
00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:27.887
And right now I have this
Skybox here actually,

20
00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:33.930
which if I rotate around,
it looks like a studio environment.

21
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.363
And that's just what's going to
be reflected on to any kind of

22
00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:41.275
game objects or materials in the scene.

23
00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:45.479
So that's not actually something that's
going to be rendered in the game just

24
00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.970
wanted to point that out now.

25
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.903
But the first thing that we're gonna to
do is create some primitives by going to

26
00:01:52.903 --> 00:01:57.386
the hierarchy here you'll see a little
plus button and if I click that,

27
00:01:57.386 --> 00:02:00.620
that will bring up what's
called the Create menu.

28
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.356
There's a lot of things
that you can create.

29
00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:05.420
We can create empty game objects.

30
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.648
We can create empty children or

31
00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:13.229
parent game objects of the currently
selected game object in the hierarchy.

32
00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:20.477
But we wanna go to 3D objects,
and we want to create a cube.

33
00:02:20.477 --> 00:02:27.170
So I'll click that It's going to be called
cube by default, but I'll rename that.

34
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.410
And I'm going to call it board, because
this is going to be our game board.

35
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.753
And, like I said, if you hold down
Option on Mac or Alt on Windows,

36
00:02:36.753 --> 00:02:40.528
you'll see that you can orbit in
the scene view by clicking and

37
00:02:40.528 --> 00:02:42.970
dragging with that key held down.

38
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.670
And there's our cube there.

39
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.291
If I hit the F key for frame,
it will frame up the currently

40
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:54.850
selected game object so
I can actually see that that's there.

41
00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:02.266
And of course, you can zoom in, and
out with your scroll wheel your device.

42
00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:06.121
And so yeah, I've got our game board here.

43
00:03:06.121 --> 00:03:11.074
And you'll see that I've got some
transform controls here as well those

44
00:03:11.074 --> 00:03:12.840
are these arrows.

45
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.544
And if I click and drag on those,
I can move this up and down.

46
00:03:17.544 --> 00:03:20.676
I can actually select
a plane here to select two

47
00:03:20.676 --> 00:03:26.110
different arrows at the same time and
lock my transformations to a plane.

48
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.407
But for today's lessons, we're just going
to type in values into the inspector

49
00:03:32.407 --> 00:03:38.713
in the transform component, so like I
said, every game object has a transform.

50
00:03:38.713 --> 00:03:42.579
So a camera, a light,
this event system, and

51
00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.249
this cube we just created
Has a transform and

52
00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:51.430
that transform has position rotation and
scale values.

53
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.345
For this cube we're going
to set the x value to zero,

54
00:03:56.345 --> 00:04:00.276
we're going to set the y value to 0.5.

55
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.492
And then we're going to set Z to zero.
