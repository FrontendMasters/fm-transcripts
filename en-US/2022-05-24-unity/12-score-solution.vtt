00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.553
Hopefully you didn't find
that too challenging,

2
00:00:03.553 --> 00:00:05.880
it was meant to be pretty easy.

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.889
Here is the solution, there's just two
lines that we needed to add to that,

4
00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.570
so for score value to be reset to zero,
we just need to assign it to be zero.

5
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.626
And then to increment the score,
we just have to say

6
00:00:21.626 --> 00:00:27.271
ScoreValue++, you could also
set it to itself +1 but

7
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:33.210
of course ++ is a shorthand
common in many languages.

8
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.910
So I'm actually going to jump over
to unity and write up this script,

9
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.959
because it is a script
that we're going to need.

10
00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:48.255
So if you have not already written this,
go to the project Window,

11
00:00:48.255 --> 00:00:51.756
right-click, and open the Create menu and

12
00:00:51.756 --> 00:00:56.407
choose Create C sharp Script,
this will be called Score.

13
00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:01.539
And I'll open the script.

14
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:09.769
And we don't need these two namespaces
at the top, so I'll get rid of those.

15
00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:14.655
And we actually don't need
either of the methods

16
00:01:14.655 --> 00:01:19.898
that are here,
because we're gonna write our own,

17
00:01:19.898 --> 00:01:24.800
so I'll write a public
void ResetScore method.

18
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.257
And actually I needed to
create a variable first, so

19
00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:33.050
let me go back up to the top here.

20
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:41.220
We need a public integer and that's
the ScoreValue property that I mentioned.

21
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.408
I'll open curly braces there,
we need to get,

22
00:01:45.408 --> 00:01:49.071
that is public and then a private set, and

23
00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:55.120
the reason this get is public is
because the property is public.

24
00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.181
So, if I were to say, that this were
set without the accessor there,

25
00:02:01.181 --> 00:02:07.676
that would also be public but I am
explicitly saying that is a private set.

26
00:02:07.676 --> 00:02:10.956
So now in ResetScore,

27
00:02:10.956 --> 00:02:16.305
we want to set that property to be 0,

28
00:02:16.305 --> 00:02:24.765
and then we need another method
called IncrementScore and

29
00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:30.306
there we will say, ScoreValue++.

30
00:02:30.306 --> 00:02:34.386
So every time this method is called,
score will go up by one,

31
00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:37.921
when reset score is called
it will get reset to zero.
