1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.190
So, we hit the play button.

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.010
Nothing happened.

3
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:12.050
It's because we need to add some
additional components to our game objects.

4
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.201
So, now we're going to work on
adding these components and

5
00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:17.100
we're gonna work on player input.

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.041
So in order to add player input,

7
00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:26.800
we need to first add a couple of
components to the player game object.

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.260
And some of them are built into Unity,
some of them are gonna write ourselves.

9
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.570
So the first one is what's
called a rigid body.

10
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.728
So our spheres and the cube already
had those collider components

11
00:00:39.728 --> 00:00:46.705
that you saw that's so that physics,
collisions can actually be detected.

12
00:00:46.705 --> 00:00:49.575
But they don't actually
have a mass to them.

13
00:00:49.575 --> 00:00:54.341
They don't actually have anything
that's gonna interact with the gravity

14
00:00:54.341 --> 00:00:56.360
that is in a Unity scene.

15
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.443
So we need to add a Rigidbody component so
that Unity knows this

16
00:01:01.443 --> 00:01:08.290
is something that actually needs to
drop and, roll around and interact.

17
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.470
Then we'll add a player input component,
which is part of the input system package.

18
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.370
And that will allow us
to invoke input events.

19
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.745
Have callbacks for those and

20
00:01:20.745 --> 00:01:24.190
actually interact with some of
the scripts that we're going to write.

21
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.501
And then we're going to
write two custom scripts or

22
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:32.510
two custom components I should say,
that will add to the player game object.

23
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.590
One is going to be called
rolling movement, and

24
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.260
the other is going to be
called player movement.

25
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.534
And we'll see why When we get to those.

26
00:01:42.534 --> 00:01:49.520
So let's go back to Unity.

27
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.870
And let's just add
the built-in components first.

28
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.070
So in the hierarchy,
I have the player game object selected.

29
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.052
That's the sphere that we created that
in the game view is off scene, but

30
00:02:01.052 --> 00:02:03.920
in the same view,
if I hit F Is right here?

31
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.202
And down here at the bottom in
the inspector with the player game object

32
00:02:10.202 --> 00:02:13.250
selected I'm going to
choose Add Component.

33
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.040
And do we want to add a rigid body so
I could dig through

34
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.650
the menus here I could go to physics and
find rigid body here or

35
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.481
you can just type at the top and
it will find things much faster.

36
00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:36.074
That's usually how I add component
because there are lots of built in

37
00:02:36.074 --> 00:02:37.586
components in Unity.

38
00:02:37.586 --> 00:02:42.499
So lets add a Rigidbody,
don't add a Rigidbody 2D, that's for

39
00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:47.080
2D games, this is a 3D game so
we want a normal Rigidbody.

40
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.099
And then on Rigidbody,
we are gonna set a couple

41
00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:58.170
of its properties so
it has some mass of 1 by default.

42
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.490
We actually want a mass of 0.5.

43
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.292
And this is something interesting that
you can play with and in the game,

44
00:03:06.292 --> 00:03:11.253
after we've built everything if you
want to see what, different masses to

45
00:03:11.253 --> 00:03:16.057
the spheres might be like or what
different movement speeds might be like

46
00:03:16.057 --> 00:03:21.350
it's a way that you can tune the game
to behave differently than it does.

47
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.750
The way we're going to build it.

48
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.310
Next we're going to change
drag to a value of 2.

49
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.020
And that does kind of
what the name implies.

50
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.550
It simulates air resistance.

51
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.801
So that's going to kind of allow these
spheres to move a little bit more

52
00:03:39.801 --> 00:03:46.480
along kind of an S curve, as things speed
up and slow down, it'll look better.

53
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.180
And then the last thing we're gonna change
on this rigid body is the interpolation.

54
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.870
So this is a little bit more advanced.

55
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.508
It's something we do need to change here

56
00:03:58.508 --> 00:04:03.410
we're going to change the value of
interpolate from none to interpolate.

57
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.630
And that just kind of changes.

58
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.431
Basically the way that objects move
from one physics tick to the next or

59
00:04:14.431 --> 00:04:17.099
one physics update to the next.

60
00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:24.920
It changes how things well, yeah, are
interpolated from one update to another.

61
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.195
So we're just going to change
interpolate to interpolate.

62
00:04:28.195 --> 00:04:32.220
[LAUGH] And
that will kind of smooth things out.

63
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.860
It'll make the movement
look a lot smoother.

64
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.130
So next we need to add another
component called player input.

65
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.936
So if I go down here and
choose add component and

66
00:04:42.936 --> 00:04:47.630
type in player input,
you should see it's right there.

67
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.330
I'll choose that.

68
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.440
And we want to do two things here.

69
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.892
First, player input needs
a set of actions and

70
00:04:58.892 --> 00:05:03.280
I've actually already
created an actions asset.

71
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.680
So that's not something that
we're going to do ourselves.

72
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.829
Input is a very deep topic, but
I have an actions asset and

73
00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:15.960
you'll see that there's this field here.

74
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.418
There's a little kind of
circled target icon next to it.

75
00:05:20.418 --> 00:05:25.958
If I click that,
it will bring up a selection window and

76
00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:30.260
I can choose things that are in the scene.

77
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.400
There's no action assets in
the scene to choose from.

78
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.550
Or [COUGH] you can choose from assets.

79
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.223
So you can choose from the actual folder
that you see in the project window here,

80
00:05:42.223 --> 00:05:44.990
and I want to choose
the one called gameplay.

81
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.920
It's the only option.

82
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.954
If you double click that it
will add that actions asset and

83
00:05:49.954 --> 00:05:55.502
now if I actually double click on that
this isn't something you need to do, but

84
00:05:55.502 --> 00:06:00.882
if you're curious you can double click
the actions asset and it will show you

85
00:06:00.882 --> 00:06:07.090
this window, which is where I've already
set up all of the actions for the game.

86
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.430
So we have this move action.

87
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.236
I've tied that to WASD and
that is how we're going to

88
00:06:14.236 --> 00:06:19.263
get keyboard events flowing
into our callback methods

89
00:06:19.263 --> 00:06:23.539
that will actually drive
this sphere around.

90
00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:27.156
And then I also have a restart button so

91
00:06:27.156 --> 00:06:32.240
on the keyboard I've tied
that to the space bar.

92
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.892
But I've tested this out once,
but theoretically,

93
00:06:35.892 --> 00:06:39.880
if you plug in a gamepad you
can also play with the gamepad.

94
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.973
You can use the left stick to move
the sphere around and you can use

95
00:06:44.973 --> 00:06:50.631
the south button on the gamepad which
is like I wanna say like X on Xbox and

96
00:06:50.631 --> 00:06:57.266
I think it's also X on PlayStation I'm not
sure but it's the button at the bottom.

97
00:06:57.266 --> 00:07:02.451
So that's the asset that we're adding
to the player input component.

98
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:07.320
I said there were two things we
wanted to do here the other thing

99
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.830
is we want to change the behavior
to invoke Unity events.

100
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.160
And that will bring up this menu here.

101
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:27.246
And you saw some of the actions that
I had already set up like move and

102
00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:32.039
restart and when we're scripting,

103
00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:37.620
we will add some callback to these events.

104
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.070
So those are the two things we need to do.

105
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.065
To player input we need to
add that actions asset and

106
00:07:43.065 --> 00:07:46.420
we also need to change the behavior
to invoke Unity events
