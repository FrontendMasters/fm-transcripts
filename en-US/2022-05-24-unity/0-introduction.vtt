WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.676
Well, hey everybody, I'm Nick Pettit, and

2
00:00:03.676 --> 00:00:08.876
today's workshop is introduction
to Unity for web developers.

3
00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:13.211
In today's workshop,
we're going to be creating a video

4
00:00:13.211 --> 00:00:17.378
game that we're going to
deploy to the web using WebGL.

5
00:00:17.378 --> 00:00:22.302
And I'll get to the agenda for
today in just a second,

6
00:00:22.302 --> 00:00:27.554
but first I wanted to talk
a little bit about my journey and

7
00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:30.636
how I got into game development.

8
00:00:30.636 --> 00:00:34.391
I've been programming for
about 20 years now.

9
00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:38.059
And I first got into it
by just making websites,

10
00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.659
actually in front page,
if anyone remembers what that is.

11
00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.610
And so I was making websites,
learning about programming.

12
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.297
I got into PHP and Ruby on Rails.

13
00:00:51.297 --> 00:00:57.671
And I was building websites for my friends
and doing it on a contractual basis.

14
00:00:57.671 --> 00:01:02.579
And I started making web applications for
myself and for

15
00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.872
a couple of different
businesses I was running.

16
00:01:06.872 --> 00:01:12.146
And basically,
I got into the education side of it.

17
00:01:12.146 --> 00:01:16.740
I was very passionate about sharing
the knowledge that I had learned, and

18
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.257
I wanted to give back to the community
in the same way that I had received so

19
00:01:21.257 --> 00:01:22.906
much from the community.

20
00:01:22.906 --> 00:01:28.237
So I did get into teaching it
at an online school called

21
00:01:28.237 --> 00:01:32.860
Treehouse, so I did that for
about ten years.

22
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.715
And then during that time,
I started getting interested in VR and

23
00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:43.822
AR, and I kinda saw the trend
that was happening there and

24
00:01:43.822 --> 00:01:47.664
it was just a very
fascinating space to me.

25
00:01:47.664 --> 00:01:54.389
I wanted to just learn more about how to
get into that and how to approach it.

26
00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:59.716
And at the time,
it really was pretty difficult to do stuff

27
00:01:59.716 --> 00:02:05.586
with VR in a web environment, but
with a game engine like Unity,

28
00:02:05.586 --> 00:02:10.390
it was very accessible,
it was very democratized.

29
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.545
And so I started getting into
the Unity game engine and

30
00:02:14.545 --> 00:02:18.988
just teaching myself learning
through YouTube videos.

31
00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:23.288
And of course, Unity's website
has tons of great resources for

32
00:02:23.288 --> 00:02:26.561
learning how to create
games with their engine.

33
00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:31.802
And at this point, I've been making
games for about eight years,

34
00:02:31.802 --> 00:02:36.310
and now I make games for
a living at a company called Buck.

35
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.946
They're a global creative company
that brings brand stories and

36
00:02:39.946 --> 00:02:43.390
experiences to life through art,
design, and technology.

37
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.170
So they do lots of high key
advertisements, Super Bowl commercials,

38
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.552
that kind of thing.

39
00:02:49.552 --> 00:02:54.460
And they wanted to create games,
they wanted to get into original IP.

40
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.636
So unfortunately, I can't really share
a whole lot about what we've been up to,

41
00:02:59.636 --> 00:03:03.699
but I can show you some of the past
projects that I've worked on.

42
00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:08.438
One in particular that I'm very
proud of is called Neptune Flux,

43
00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.860
it's a deep sea adventure game.

44
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.808
And that came out in, well,
it came out in 2016 for

45
00:03:15.808 --> 00:03:19.800
Steam and
I released it on the Vive and Rift.

46
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.311
It was also playable without a VR headset.

47
00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:28.272
And then I also released it for
PlayStation VR.

48
00:03:28.272 --> 00:03:30.713
And that was very exciting.

49
00:03:30.713 --> 00:03:36.040
I'd never made a console game before,
I'd never worked on a triple A team or

50
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.630
anything like that, I was just
doing this all from my apartment.

51
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.768
[LAUGH] And it was kind of not
something I would recommend now.

52
00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:51.083
Looking back,
that was a very big undertaking and

53
00:03:51.083 --> 00:03:56.541
certainly not something I regret,
but I learned a lot from it.

54
00:03:56.541 --> 00:04:00.965
But I mean, yeah,
I've been making games for

55
00:04:00.965 --> 00:04:06.076
about eight years and
I have done all sorts of things.

56
00:04:06.076 --> 00:04:10.817
I executed on contracts for AR projects,

57
00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:14.885
I've made Sim and training demos.

58
00:04:14.885 --> 00:04:18.349
And we'll get into more of the
applications of Unity in a just sec, but

59
00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.070
let's talk about what we're
going to be doing today.

60
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.971
So we are going to make a game.

61
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:30.006
So at the end of this, we'll have
a game that we can deploy to WebGL.

62
00:04:30.006 --> 00:04:33.627
We'll get started just by
learning how to install Unity.

63
00:04:33.627 --> 00:04:36.535
You may have Unity installed already, but

64
00:04:36.535 --> 00:04:40.247
it's good to know just kind of the ins and
outs of that,

65
00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:45.208
because it is somewhat of an involved
installation process or it can be.

66
00:04:45.208 --> 00:04:50.098
And then we'll take a brief tour of
the Unity interface just to kinda get

67
00:04:50.098 --> 00:04:54.270
familiar with all of its
rearrangeable panels and windows.

68
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.858
And then we'll learn about scenes,
GameObjects, and

69
00:04:57.858 --> 00:05:01.230
components and
how those all relate to one another.

70
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.931
We'll use C# to make a physics sandbox,
and then we'll add player input to that,

71
00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:10.850
so that we can actually interact
with it and move around.

72
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.304
And then we'll create what's
called a game manager script.

73
00:05:16.304 --> 00:05:19.970
And so
that will kind of be like the game loop,

74
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.360
where all of the business logic happens.

75
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.661
Then we'll add some UI to the game, so
that all of those numbers that we're

76
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:33.473
tracking in the game manager can
actually be exposed to the player.

77
00:05:33.473 --> 00:05:37.358
And we'll add more complex
behavior on top of that.

78
00:05:37.358 --> 00:05:42.197
So we'll start kind of
layering more components

79
00:05:42.197 --> 00:05:46.807
that will drive some
more emergent behavior.

80
00:05:46.807 --> 00:05:49.121
And then we'll make the game look better,

81
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:53.048
because we're gonna start out with
just kind of gray spheres and cubes.

82
00:05:53.048 --> 00:05:55.634
And then we'll add materials and
lighting and

83
00:05:55.634 --> 00:05:59.020
post-processing on top of that
to make things look better.

84
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.667
And then we will deploy the game
to a web browser using WebGL,

85
00:06:04.667 --> 00:06:10.773
and I think you'll find that is
surprisingly easy to do in Unity.

86
00:06:10.773 --> 00:06:15.717
So first, I just wanna show you what
we're actually going to be creating.

87
00:06:15.717 --> 00:06:21.921
So I'll jump here, and
you can play this right now,

88
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:28.270
it's at bit.ly/fm for
frontendmasters-unity.

89
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.093
So here's the Unity splash screen.

90
00:06:31.093 --> 00:06:34.785
And it says,
collect more cubes than your opponent.

91
00:06:34.785 --> 00:06:36.380
Press SPACE to Start.

92
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.329
So if I hit the spacebar,
the game will start, and

93
00:06:40.329 --> 00:06:46.063
I can use the WASD keys or the arrow
keys to move this gold sphere around and

94
00:06:46.063 --> 00:06:49.370
try to collect these little purple orbs.

95
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.317
And you'll see that I
have an opponent there,

96
00:06:52.317 --> 00:06:55.198
the blue sphere that is
also rolling around.

97
00:06:55.198 --> 00:06:59.376
It's really using some very simple logic,
but

98
00:06:59.376 --> 00:07:05.645
it actually has the appearance of
having some amount of intelligence,

99
00:07:05.645 --> 00:07:10.466
where it's trying to collect
these faster than I can.

100
00:07:10.466 --> 00:07:15.445
You'll see that there's UI up at the top,
so it's keeping score of how many of these

101
00:07:15.445 --> 00:07:18.900
I've collected and
how many the opponent has collected.

102
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.965
And there's also a timer that
starts at 60 seconds and

103
00:07:23.965 --> 00:07:27.430
ticks down as the game moves forward.

104
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.130
And you'll see that there's
other nice little features,

105
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.835
like if I roll off the side here,
it will actually respawn.

106
00:07:32.835 --> 00:07:38.513
And when the timer runs out,
there'll be a game over screen.

107
00:07:38.513 --> 00:07:40.698
And I lost.

108
00:07:40.698 --> 00:07:44.557
if I had collected more, I would have won,
and of course, if it was a tie,

109
00:07:44.557 --> 00:07:45.883
it would say it's a tie.

110
00:07:45.883 --> 00:07:49.373
And then you can hit
the spacebar to start again, and

111
00:07:49.373 --> 00:07:52.717
then it'll reset the clock and
reset the scores.

112
00:07:52.717 --> 00:07:55.595
And there's other cool things
that we can do with this.

113
00:07:55.595 --> 00:08:00.872
We can adjust the speeds that
you see here to potentially

114
00:08:00.872 --> 00:08:05.369
make it a little easier or
even more difficult.

115
00:08:05.369 --> 00:08:08.510
But yeah, so this is what we're
going to be building today.
