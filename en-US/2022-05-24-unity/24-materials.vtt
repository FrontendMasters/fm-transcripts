1
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.884
Now we've got a little bit
of camera movement and

2
00:00:02.884 --> 00:00:05.950
that tends to make the game a lot
more dynamic and interesting.

3
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:14.293
And that will be really nice when
the lighting is responding to materials.

4
00:00:14.293 --> 00:00:19.168
So as the camera moves around, we'll get
kind of a different material response as

5
00:00:19.168 --> 00:00:23.350
the angle changes between the camera and
the lights.

6
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.096
So we're gonna assign some materials
to make this game look a lot better

7
00:00:28.096 --> 00:00:31.114
than just a couple of gray cubes and
spheres.

8
00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:35.010
But first, what is a material?

9
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.386
This isn't something that's
unique to Unity, this is true for

10
00:00:38.386 --> 00:00:40.018
really any 3D applications.

11
00:00:40.018 --> 00:00:44.404
But a material is in an asset
that combines both a shader and

12
00:00:44.404 --> 00:00:50.045
a set of textures or other values
like colors, floating-point numbers,

13
00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:54.451
to partially determine how
a 3D mesh should be rendered.

14
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:56.970
It could also be a 2D mesh, I suppose.

15
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.321
So a shader is a small program
that runs on the GPU, and

16
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:04.660
generally, it shades each pixel.

17
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.643
Although, a shader can also
modify the vertices of 3D meshes.

18
00:01:10.643 --> 00:01:14.613
And that's how you get vertex
shaders that create all sorts of

19
00:01:14.613 --> 00:01:19.194
cool interesting effects like
tessellation or adding more geometry or

20
00:01:19.194 --> 00:01:24.850
kinda ocean waves, something like that,
that you might see on a 3D mesh.

21
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.918
Textures are 2D images that get
applied to the 3D surface of a model.

22
00:01:31.918 --> 00:01:35.352
So you can kinda think about
it like wrapping a globe or

23
00:01:35.352 --> 00:01:37.192
something with wallpaper.

24
00:01:37.192 --> 00:01:41.912
And it's the shader that
helps determine how those

25
00:01:41.912 --> 00:01:47.230
textures are actually
applied to the 3D model.

26
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.373
So, a material just combines
all of these elements.

27
00:01:50.373 --> 00:01:55.384
It combines the shader, it combines the
textures, it combines all these certain

28
00:01:55.384 --> 00:02:00.175
values into a more easily understandable
asset, such as a gold material, for

29
00:02:00.175 --> 00:02:04.630
anything in the game that we want to
look like a gold, metallic surface.

30
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.264
So, we've got a little
bit more scene setup.

31
00:02:09.264 --> 00:02:13.992
Up to this point,
we've had just the black background, but

32
00:02:13.992 --> 00:02:18.450
it would be really nice to
have a plane on the ground.

33
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.187
So, let's do that.

34
00:02:20.187 --> 00:02:24.511
That's really pretty
easy to do in this case.

35
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:30.234
We just want to go to 3D
objects in the hierarchy,

36
00:02:30.234 --> 00:02:33.244
add a plane, that's it.

37
00:02:33.244 --> 00:02:36.481
We can call this Ground if we want to.

38
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:41.860
And actually that's not it, we want this
to be at the origin, so let me reset that.

39
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.910
So the transform should be 0, 0, 0 for
position rotation, and 1, 1, 1 for scale.

40
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.133
So if we look at this in the scene view,

41
00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:55.133
you can see that we've got our little game
board here, we've got the collectibles,

42
00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:59.030
we've got the players, and
then we've got this large plane now.

43
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.470
And it makes things pretty
difficult to see, but

44
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.760
once we assign materials,
that will be a lot better.

45
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.946
So I have just included some materials for
us to work with.

46
00:03:15.946 --> 00:03:17.904
And if I move this slider,

47
00:03:17.904 --> 00:03:23.370
we can actually get a preview of
what those are going to look like.

48
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.820
So I wanna put this wood floor material.

49
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.044
I can get a little preview of that.

50
00:03:30.044 --> 00:03:32.220
I wanna put this onto the ground plane.

51
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.730
So I can just drag that
from the project window,

52
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.657
drop it on to the ground
plane in the scene view.

53
00:03:41.657 --> 00:03:43.753
And there it is,
now it's in the game view.

54
00:03:43.753 --> 00:03:46.342
It's that easy to assign materials.

55
00:03:46.342 --> 00:03:48.907
Just a little bit more about materials.

56
00:03:48.907 --> 00:03:50.475
I have this one selected.

57
00:03:50.475 --> 00:03:55.172
You can see that up here, like I said,
it's a combination of a shader and

58
00:03:55.172 --> 00:03:57.520
textures or another values.

59
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.424
Here's the shader.

60
00:03:58.424 --> 00:04:02.647
It's using a shader from
the universal render pipeline,

61
00:04:02.647 --> 00:04:07.729
which is just a lit shader,
a lit shader meaning it is using lighting,

62
00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:11.970
as opposed to a shader that is unlit,
not using lighting.

63
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.618
There's a couple of surface options,
we want this surface to use the metallic

64
00:04:18.618 --> 00:04:24.530
physically based rendering workflow, which
basically gives us these options here.

65
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.829
It is an opaque surface as opposed to a,
say transparent or glass surface,

66
00:04:28.829 --> 00:04:30.139
something like that.

67
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.070
And we want it to receive shadows,

68
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.800
we want it to be able to get
shadows from our lights.

69
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.121
And then we have a couple
of surface inputs, so

70
00:04:42.121 --> 00:04:45.412
here are those textures
that I was describing.

71
00:04:45.412 --> 00:04:50.174
If I click that, you can see that
here is that just base color texture

72
00:04:50.174 --> 00:04:53.380
that looks a lot like that wood texture.

73
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.307
But there's other textures there too.

74
00:04:55.307 --> 00:04:57.961
There's also a metallic smoothness map,

75
00:04:57.961 --> 00:05:03.590
which maps out what parts of the surface
should be metallic, in this case, none.

76
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.076
And parts that should be a little
bit smoother or rougher, and

77
00:05:07.076 --> 00:05:09.650
that's kind of a black and white map.

78
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.712
There's also a normal map,

79
00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:18.326
a normal map creates
the appearance of kinda bumps or

80
00:05:18.326 --> 00:05:23.430
divots, and that's how in this,
let's see if

81
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.056
I can tear this off here,
we get, well, maybe not.

82
00:05:29.056 --> 00:05:33.112
But we get the appearance of there
being small little bumps and

83
00:05:33.112 --> 00:05:35.770
imperfections in the wood grain there.

84
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.256
And that's coming from the normal map.

85
00:05:38.256 --> 00:05:40.306
Normal maps look pretty weird.

86
00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:44.989
Let me see if I can find one that's
maybe a little bit better of an example.

87
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.942
Not really, but
normal maps look pretty weird,

88
00:05:54.942 --> 00:06:01.047
they do have basically each pixel value or
each RGB value representing

89
00:06:01.047 --> 00:06:06.341
a vector that it should be
pushing that particular pixel in.

90
00:06:06.341 --> 00:06:10.070
So it's pushing those
pixels in a direction or

91
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.331
an XYZ direction based on the RGB value.

92
00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:16.430
And that's how you get those
little nice bumps in the shader.

93
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:23.255
So we've applied the wood floor,
the play surface,

94
00:06:23.255 --> 00:06:29.094
we want to be this kinda like
black marble looking thing.

95
00:06:29.094 --> 00:06:32.530
And you don't have to drag
things into the scene view.

96
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.825
If you want to be more specific,
you can actually select the game

97
00:06:37.825 --> 00:06:44.704
object that you want to apply something
to and find it's mesh renderer component.

98
00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:47.593
Here it's using just
a normal lit material.

99
00:06:47.593 --> 00:06:49.184
This is the player.

100
00:06:49.184 --> 00:06:53.287
I want the player to have this
metallic gold material, so

101
00:06:53.287 --> 00:06:56.620
I can just drop that into this slot.

102
00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:02.545
I want the opponent to have kind of this
bluish marble material, so we'll do that.

103
00:07:02.545 --> 00:07:07.980
And then finally,
we want the collectible to have this kind

104
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:15.440
of special emissive quality to it, so
we'll drag that and put that here.

105
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.292
So right now, this will just appear pink,
it's not going to have

106
00:07:20.292 --> 00:07:25.411
kind of that glowing surface quality
that I was showing previously,

107
00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:30.530
but we'll get to how to add
that soon with post processing.

108
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.995
So if I hit the space bar and start,

109
00:07:32.995 --> 00:07:38.523
now you can see that we have nicer
materials, the games looking a lot better.

110
00:07:38.523 --> 00:07:43.218
There is more that we can do,
but adding materials to surfaces

111
00:07:43.218 --> 00:07:47.193
really gives them a very
physical looking quality,

112
00:07:47.193 --> 00:07:52.280
that we can push even further
with additional effects.

113
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.445
So that's kind of just a quick
introduction to materials.

114
00:07:55.445 --> 00:07:58.385
Altering materials is a very deep topic,

115
00:07:58.385 --> 00:08:03.170
altering shaders is perhaps
an even deeper topic than that.

116
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.454
But you can create shaders and
your own materials and

117
00:08:07.454 --> 00:08:12.770
bring them into Unity and
create lots of really cool stuff.

118
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:18.775
These were just downloaded from
the Internet, under CC0 license,

119
00:08:18.775 --> 00:08:23.122
and there's lots of great
resources out there for

120
00:08:23.122 --> 00:08:27.795
all sorts of materials that
you can use in your games.
