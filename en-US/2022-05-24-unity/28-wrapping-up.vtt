WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.147
And so now we made a video game.

2
00:00:04.147 --> 00:00:10.897
There's a couple of things that I want you
to keep in mind and take away from this.

3
00:00:10.897 --> 00:00:14.625
Unity, first of all,
is great for making games.

4
00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:19.603
But it can also be used for so many
other things in so many other verticals.

5
00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:23.486
Unity can be used for
simulations and product demos.

6
00:00:23.486 --> 00:00:28.038
It can be used in lots of AR and
VR applications.

7
00:00:28.038 --> 00:00:34.354
And Unity really is just finding its way
into more and more surprising places.

8
00:00:34.354 --> 00:00:37.870
The really cool thing about Unity is that
you can deploy your projects to a wide

9
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:38.963
variety of platforms.

10
00:00:38.963 --> 00:00:43.194
I mean, you saw how easily
it was to deploy to WebGL.

11
00:00:43.194 --> 00:00:46.262
Unity allows you to write your code once,
and

12
00:00:46.262 --> 00:00:49.752
then you can pretty easily
port it to other places.

13
00:00:49.752 --> 00:00:53.970
You do have to do platform
specific integrations, say for

14
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.060
achievements on different consoles or
steam or something like that.

15
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:06.100
But it's pretty easy to take the same game
and make it fit into different places.

16
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.590
I want you to remember to think in
terms of Unity's component based

17
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.199
architecture and
try to favor composition over other

18
00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:18.226
approaches to code diversification
such as inheritance.

19
00:01:18.226 --> 00:01:22.517
So you wanna put components together
to get that emergent behavior and

20
00:01:22.517 --> 00:01:24.853
have them interact with one another.

21
00:01:24.853 --> 00:01:29.133
That's kinda how you wanna
try to think about Unity

22
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.927
architecture as much as you can.

23
00:01:31.927 --> 00:01:37.189
Another really great thing about Unity
is that you can leverage the community,

24
00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.791
the asset store, the documentation.

25
00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:44.596
And in my opinion, this really is
the true advantage of Unity over other

26
00:01:44.596 --> 00:01:49.658
game engines, Unity is incredibly
robust and feature full and powerful.

27
00:01:49.658 --> 00:01:54.404
But really it's community and
the asset store and

28
00:01:54.404 --> 00:01:58.924
all of its great documentation
that I think in my

29
00:01:58.924 --> 00:02:03.453
own personal opinion,
gives it a slight edge.

30
00:02:03.453 --> 00:02:08.200
And then the last thing I want
you to remember is that game

31
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.150
development is a huge and
very interdisciplinary topic.

32
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.379
And just Unity on its own, even within
the context of game development,

33
00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.993
is still a huge application and
a huge ecosystem.

34
00:02:21.993 --> 00:02:27.127
So what we saw today was kind of a golden
path to creating a very simple game,

35
00:02:27.127 --> 00:02:31.788
but as you can imagine, there's so
much more to learn and explore.

36
00:02:31.788 --> 00:02:35.458
Like we didn't add any kind
of like particle effects.

37
00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:36.809
There was no multiplayer.

38
00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:39.280
We didn't add sound to the game.

39
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.661
I mean, there's so many other things
that you can do with Unity, and so

40
00:02:43.661 --> 00:02:46.154
many other systems that we we can touch.

41
00:02:46.154 --> 00:02:52.673
But yeah, I encourage you to learn and
explore as much as you can.

42
00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:57.537
So are there any questions
from anyone here or

43
00:02:57.537 --> 00:03:01.891
anyone in the chat who made a video game?

44
00:03:01.891 --> 00:03:04.810
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I had a question specifically in

45
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.190
the context of the web when
you have a project that grows,

46
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.206
that becomes very large.

47
00:03:11.206 --> 00:03:16.606
Does Unity have any tool sets to kind
of offload where the assets get stored?

48
00:03:16.606 --> 00:03:19.219
Are there some other location?

49
00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.929
&gt;&gt; Yeah, very much.

50
00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:22.375
So there's a number of different tools for
that.

51
00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:27.382
I mean, one is just called asset bundles.

52
00:03:27.382 --> 00:03:33.994
I mean asset bundles are used to kind of
like split up just the different stuff in

53
00:03:33.994 --> 00:03:40.726
the game so that it's not one giant file
attached to your exit executable file.

54
00:03:40.726 --> 00:03:44.626
So, I mean, that's one thing,
just to split it up on disk.

55
00:03:44.626 --> 00:03:50.970
But yeah, absolutely, you can stream
assets from any source that you want to,

56
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.192
and in fact, that's a really
powerful way to also design games.

57
00:03:56.192 --> 00:04:04.236
A lot of games will connect up their
stats to even just like a Google sheet.

58
00:04:04.236 --> 00:04:09.168
And you can import values for,
say different items in your game

59
00:04:09.168 --> 00:04:14.114
using just a spreadsheet and
kinda going through the numbers.

60
00:04:14.114 --> 00:04:18.805
So, there's lots of different ways that
other things can connect into Unity.

61
00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:25.370
And yeah, you can certainly
stream assets from a server.

62
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.540
It's more complicated, but
certainly something that happens often.

63
00:04:31.658 --> 00:04:32.682
Yeah.

64
00:04:32.682 --> 00:04:33.771
&gt;&gt; Regarding scenes,

65
00:04:33.771 --> 00:04:37.867
let's say if we wanted to add a home menu
before you load into the game, would

66
00:04:37.867 --> 00:04:42.050
that be something you would do with a
canvas that makes the camera look at a UI?

67
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.714
Or make an entire separate scene and
have the game menu unconnected?

68
00:04:47.714 --> 00:04:49.813
&gt;&gt; Both approaches are valid.

69
00:04:49.813 --> 00:04:54.562
In a game this simple,
I would just create a new full

70
00:04:54.562 --> 00:04:58.764
screen canvas that is shown and
gets hidden.

71
00:04:58.764 --> 00:05:03.575
But in more complicated games,
if you have a game with say,

72
00:05:03.575 --> 00:05:09.074
multiple levels, or you're streaming
in an open world in chunks.

73
00:05:09.074 --> 00:05:13.702
And you have a lot more code to
manage those scenes, then, yeah,

74
00:05:13.702 --> 00:05:17.675
absolutely, you could put
menus in different scenes.

75
00:05:17.675 --> 00:05:19.970
There's really no right or
wrong answer there.

76
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.735
It really just,
it's kind of project dependent.

77
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.424
&gt;&gt; Is it possible to access some of
these game objects with JavaScript?

78
00:05:36.443 --> 00:05:39.756
&gt;&gt; Possible probably.

79
00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:43.874
How you would do that?

80
00:05:43.874 --> 00:05:45.246
I don't know.

81
00:05:45.246 --> 00:05:50.181
But I mean, Unity is such [LAUGH]
a big ecosystem of stuff.

82
00:05:50.181 --> 00:05:54.467
I'm sure somebody has done
that somewhere at some point.

83
00:05:54.467 --> 00:05:57.980
[LAUGH] No, I've never tried that myself.

84
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.227
&gt;&gt; Should we prevent their game
from restarting during running?

85
00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:06.965
Like, if you hit Space during the game and
it restarts?

86
00:06:06.965 --> 00:06:10.878
&gt;&gt; Probably, I'm curious,
is that what's happening right now?

87
00:06:10.878 --> 00:06:15.138
Cuz I think that is prevented,
but let's see.

88
00:06:15.138 --> 00:06:19.830
So if I hit Space, yeah, that will
just reset the position of the player.

89
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.728
So, yeah, that would probably
be a good thing to improve.

90
00:06:24.728 --> 00:06:30.233
[LAUGH] I mean right now
it just resets the position

91
00:06:30.233 --> 00:06:34.403
of the player and resets the scores.

92
00:06:34.403 --> 00:06:37.032
But yeah, let's try that right now.

93
00:06:37.032 --> 00:06:40.878
Let's do a little bit of live coding,
which is always risky.

94
00:06:40.878 --> 00:06:43.346
So let's see.

95
00:06:45.591 --> 00:06:50.465
So, if the game's not playing,

96
00:06:50.465 --> 00:06:54.125
we just return, right?

97
00:06:54.125 --> 00:07:02.114
So what we would need to do is actually
make that like a static property.

98
00:07:02.114 --> 00:07:08.949
So we could have a public static Boolean,
we say GameIsPlaying.

99
00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:13.995
And we will set that to this value,

100
00:07:13.995 --> 00:07:20.618
which is also going to
need to become static.

101
00:07:20.618 --> 00:07:24.664
So let's just try that.

102
00:07:24.664 --> 00:07:28.633
So where are we resetting that?

103
00:07:28.633 --> 00:07:30.525
Let's see at the Collectible.

104
00:07:33.765 --> 00:07:40.271
So under reset position we'll
say GameManager.GameIsPlaying.

105
00:07:40.271 --> 00:07:47.856
And so if the game is not playing,
And this may or may not work.

106
00:07:47.856 --> 00:07:49.688
We are trying this out.

107
00:07:49.688 --> 00:07:54.663
So if the game is not playing, don't
reset the position of the collectible.

108
00:07:54.663 --> 00:07:57.689
Same thing here for the players.

109
00:07:57.689 --> 00:08:01.729
And then I think we need to
do that in score as well.

110
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.722
So let's try that out.

111
00:08:10.608 --> 00:08:16.422
Okay, and then yeah,
we don't wanna reset the score.

112
00:08:16.422 --> 00:08:21.046
So if GameManager.GameIsPlaying,

113
00:08:24.533 --> 00:08:27.513
It's not playing, right?

114
00:08:27.513 --> 00:08:29.903
Yeah, not playing.

115
00:08:29.903 --> 00:08:31.619
Let's see if that worked.

116
00:08:31.619 --> 00:08:32.485
I don't know if this will.

117
00:08:36.614 --> 00:08:41.929
So now if we play, Hit Space to start.

118
00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:46.729
If I hit the spacebar,
nothing is happening and

119
00:08:46.729 --> 00:08:52.134
we'll just run out the game
clock more quickly here.

120
00:08:52.134 --> 00:08:57.286
So if we set that to 5 seconds, I

121
00:08:57.286 --> 00:09:02.609
hit Space and the game stops.

122
00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:08.216
We should be able to,
now just continues, it doesn't reset it.

123
00:09:08.216 --> 00:09:14.134
So didn't quite work, but
yeah, that was a good catch

124
00:09:14.134 --> 00:09:19.548
cuz that is definitely
a bug in a production game.

125
00:09:19.548 --> 00:09:21.048
It should be addressed for sure.

126
00:09:24.108 --> 00:09:26.723
There are other questions?

127
00:09:26.723 --> 00:09:32.001
&gt;&gt; Just the titles,
when the screen sizes are changing,

128
00:09:32.001 --> 00:09:37.288
can you have them so
that proportionally you can stay?

129
00:09:37.288 --> 00:09:38.366
&gt;&gt; Are you talking about the UI?

130
00:09:38.366 --> 00:09:39.404
&gt;&gt; Yeah, just the UI stuff.

131
00:09:39.404 --> 00:09:43.414
Yeah, just because we have it changing
on different resolutions, right?

132
00:09:43.414 --> 00:09:45.482
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, if we change-
&gt;&gt; That means all these

133
00:09:45.482 --> 00:09:46.090
symbol are there, right?

134
00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.986
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean If you change the
resolution of the game, it should, yeah,

135
00:09:48.986 --> 00:09:49.565
reset the UI.

136
00:09:49.565 --> 00:09:53.542
I mean, that's part of the power of
the UI system is that we had those anchor

137
00:09:53.542 --> 00:09:57.221
points and we're kind of setting
where we want those to be on screen.

138
00:09:57.221 --> 00:10:01.803
And we're also auto sizing the text
between that min and max that we set.

139
00:10:01.803 --> 00:10:06.542
&gt;&gt; I just saw it when compiled, I think
there resolutions got pretty way off.

140
00:10:06.542 --> 00:10:11.824
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that has to do
with the capture resolution.

141
00:10:11.824 --> 00:10:17.420
Although, I'm not entirely
sure if that's the case.

142
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.877
Yeah, if I hit this 4K, yeah-
&gt;&gt; They're gonna get to resize that.

143
00:10:20.877 --> 00:10:24.154
&gt;&gt; They're gonna get to really tiny.

144
00:10:24.154 --> 00:10:29.422
There should be a way,
if we go to the canvas let's see,

145
00:10:29.422 --> 00:10:34.262
we can change the canvas
to Scale with Screen Size.

146
00:10:34.262 --> 00:10:40.062
So that's probably a little bit better.

147
00:10:40.062 --> 00:10:44.170
And if we resize that,
what would that look like?

148
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.429
Yeah, that'll keep it pretty large.

149
00:10:46.429 --> 00:10:51.226
So yeah, I mean, that could be
a potential way to mitigate that if

150
00:10:51.226 --> 00:10:55.429
you change the canvas scale or
to scale with screen size.

151
00:10:55.429 --> 00:11:02.220
So yeah, so also a good improvement there.

152
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.121
Well, that's it.

153
00:11:05.121 --> 00:11:06.910
That's all I got.

154
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:07.910
Thanks for listening.

155
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.494
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
