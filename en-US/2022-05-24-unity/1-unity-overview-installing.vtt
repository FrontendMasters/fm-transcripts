1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.260
We're going to start at the beginning,
what is Unity?

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.745
Right, well Unity is a couple of things,

3
00:00:06.745 --> 00:00:10.377
there's a couple of different
answers I could give to that.

4
00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:16.063
But really the primary answer I would
say is that Unity is a game engine.

5
00:00:16.063 --> 00:00:20.504
Now that's a little bit of a misnomer
because there's a lot of things that you

6
00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:21.607
can do with Unity.

7
00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:26.670
And really, any kind of software that
you want to create that needs 2D or

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.567
3D interactivity, where you're
actually building this world with

9
00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:36.640
things inside of it like 3D meshes,
you can use Unity for.

10
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.780
So, of course, like I said, the primary
application of Unity is creating games.

11
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.879
So games like Subnautica, Cuphead,
Fall Guys, Monument Valley,

12
00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.795
they were all created in Unity.

13
00:00:48.795 --> 00:00:53.137
And I think a lot of people
are surprised to learn how many of their

14
00:00:53.137 --> 00:00:55.480
favorite games are made in Unity.

15
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.590
It's absolutely used for

16
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.013
AAA games and all of my favorites.

17
00:01:05.013 --> 00:01:09.184
So, of course, Unity can be used for
creating games, but

18
00:01:09.184 --> 00:01:12.507
there's so
many additional applications and

19
00:01:12.507 --> 00:01:17.570
Unity is finding its way into
a lot of really surprising places.

20
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.280
It can be used for
AR and VR product demos.

21
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.110
So I've done a little bit of that.

22
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.681
So for example,
if you're maybe buying furniture online or

23
00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:32.514
you're customizing sneakers and you want
to use AR to actually see these things,

24
00:01:32.514 --> 00:01:35.050
that's a great application of Unity.

25
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.760
You can use Unity to preview
these things in real time.

26
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.940
It's being used in film and animation.

27
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.759
So, real time production
is making its way into

28
00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.542
a lot of Hollywood productions
because it's just faster.

29
00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:56.182
It's faster to render things in real
time than wait on a render farm to

30
00:01:56.182 --> 00:02:00.182
ray trace all of these things and
get a result the next day and

31
00:02:00.182 --> 00:02:02.670
then have to make notes and so forth.

32
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.010
It's kind of closing that loop and
just making things go way faster.

33
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.139
It's used in automotives,
so a car dashboard or

34
00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:14.940
something like that, all of that
stuff is getting digitized now.

35
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.850
And Unity is great at presenting UI and
it's a great spot for it.

36
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.545
And yeah, it's used in manufacturing,

37
00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:31.012
architectural visualization where you can
potentially preview a building in VR and

38
00:02:31.012 --> 00:02:34.840
see the scale of everything
before it's built.

39
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.660
And it's used in a lot of simulation and
training applications.

40
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.996
So if there's potentially
dangerous situation or

41
00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:48.860
something like that that you want
to train for in a safe environment.

42
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.324
Again VR and
Unity is a great way to do that.

43
00:02:53.324 --> 00:02:57.670
So Unity is used all over the place,
it's not just games.

44
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.572
And there's really a very broad market for
this and

45
00:03:01.572 --> 00:03:07.190
it's finding its way into all
sorts of different verticals.

46
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.800
So you may have Unity already installed.

47
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.090
I have Unity already installed as well.

48
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.472
But we are just going to step through the
installation process a little bit just so

49
00:03:17.472 --> 00:03:19.350
you can get more familiar with it.

50
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.238
Because I think you'll find
when you're working with Unity,

51
00:03:23.238 --> 00:03:27.065
the version that you're using
tends to be pretty important.

52
00:03:27.065 --> 00:03:29.438
So when you install Unity,

53
00:03:29.438 --> 00:03:35.319
it will actually install a piece of
software called the Unity Hub and

54
00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.393
the Unity Hub has several
different tabs on the left side.

55
00:03:40.393 --> 00:03:44.715
There's Projects, Installs,
Learn, and Community.

56
00:03:44.715 --> 00:03:51.270
I have the Installs tab selected in this
screenshot, and that just shows you all of

57
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:57.072
the different versions of Unity that
you can have installed at one time.

58
00:03:57.072 --> 00:04:01.250
And different versions of
Unity have different features,

59
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.266
they have different streams of releases.

60
00:04:04.266 --> 00:04:09.522
So there's the LTS stream,
which is long term support.

61
00:04:09.522 --> 00:04:12.733
That's best if you are trying
to build a project and

62
00:04:12.733 --> 00:04:14.908
you just need maximum stability.

63
00:04:14.908 --> 00:04:19.205
And that's a great place to
start if you're a beginner.

64
00:04:19.205 --> 00:04:24.479
There's also the Tech Stream releases
where they do release more cutting

65
00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:31.140
edge tech and have more regular updates,
but they don't promise the same stability.

66
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.319
So having multiple installs while you're
working with different features or

67
00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:39.680
working on different
projects is very helpful.

68
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.014
And when you are working on a project,
it's great to kind of lock the version and

69
00:04:45.014 --> 00:04:47.643
basically synchronize your watches or

70
00:04:47.643 --> 00:04:52.360
synchronize your versions with
other collaborators on the project.

71
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.776
There's also the Projects window, and

72
00:04:54.776 --> 00:04:59.333
that just lists out what projects you
have on your system and their version.

73
00:04:59.333 --> 00:05:04.620
There's the Learn tab where, as the name
implies, you can learn more about Unity.

74
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.036
Unity the company has a lot
of great resources for

75
00:05:09.036 --> 00:05:11.951
learning how to use the engine.

76
00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:16.259
And then there's the Community tab,
which is also great because

77
00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.951
you can interact with people on forums and
get answers.

78
00:05:19.951 --> 00:05:24.374
And that's really one of the great
things about Unity is their

79
00:05:24.374 --> 00:05:26.852
community that you can leverage.

80
00:05:26.852 --> 00:05:34.617
So we are going to kind of follow
these instructions a little bit.

81
00:05:34.617 --> 00:05:37.851
This is how you would install Unity if
you don't have it installed already.

82
00:05:37.851 --> 00:05:41.928
You can go to unity.com,
download the Unity Hub.

83
00:05:41.928 --> 00:05:45.800
There's several different editions, so
the Personal edition should be fine.

84
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.905
But if you are using this for
a business purpose,

85
00:05:48.905 --> 00:05:53.330
you should pay attention to
the licensing agreements.

86
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.295
And then you can follow the setup
instructions for the Hub,

87
00:05:57.295 --> 00:06:00.475
install the latest
Long Term Support version.

88
00:06:00.475 --> 00:06:05.788
And then when installing Unity from the
Hub, it will give the option to install

89
00:06:05.788 --> 00:06:11.715
different modules with it, and you want to
make sure that you include WebGL support.

90
00:06:11.715 --> 00:06:16.229
And if you've already installed Unity and
you didn't do that,

91
00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.670
it's really easy to go to your
installs and add WebGL support.

92
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.375
So let's pop out of slides here and

93
00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:28.235
just go to the Hub really quick and
I'll show you some of that.

94
00:06:28.235 --> 00:06:33.742
So I have two projects here
in my projects window.

95
00:06:33.742 --> 00:06:39.158
The one we're going to start with, which
I'll show you how to get in a little bit.

96
00:06:39.158 --> 00:06:42.044
And then the complete
version of the project,

97
00:06:42.044 --> 00:06:45.227
which is the finished build
that I just showed you.

98
00:06:45.227 --> 00:06:50.681
I have lots of installs of Unity, this
can fill up your hard drive very quickly.

99
00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:57.176
So be cognizant of kinda how
many versions you're installing.

100
00:06:57.176 --> 00:07:03.488
The version we're going
to use today is 2021.3.0

101
00:07:03.488 --> 00:07:09.817
F1 which at this time is
the current LTS version of Unity.

102
00:07:09.817 --> 00:07:15.016
And like I said,
if you didn't install WebGL support,

103
00:07:15.016 --> 00:07:21.764
you can go to the installs tab and
where you have that version installed,

104
00:07:21.764 --> 00:07:26.646
you can click this gear icon and
choose add modules.

105
00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:31.544
And then it will bring up all of the
different modules that you can add, and

106
00:07:31.544 --> 00:07:34.470
most of these are for
adding build support.

107
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:41.215
So if I were making a game for iOS or
tvOS, I could add support for those here.

108
00:07:41.215 --> 00:07:45.752
There are several different
ways to build for devices or

109
00:07:45.752 --> 00:07:48.271
platforms like Linux and Mac.

110
00:07:48.271 --> 00:07:50.882
And there's also language packs.

111
00:07:50.882 --> 00:07:55.846
You can install documentation
if you want that locally, and

112
00:07:55.846 --> 00:07:59.348
if you actually want to use Visual Studio,

113
00:07:59.348 --> 00:08:03.647
it's easy to install it
from those modules as well.

114
00:08:03.647 --> 00:08:08.260
So I already have WebGL
installed on this version.

115
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:13.135
If I were to go to maybe another version
of Unity, and choose Add modules,

116
00:08:13.135 --> 00:08:14.798
it should show up there.

117
00:08:14.798 --> 00:08:16.737
Yeah, WebGL build support.

118
00:08:16.737 --> 00:08:22.005
So you would check that and choose Install
if you didn't have it installed already.

119
00:08:22.005 --> 00:08:26.973
Like I said, the Learn tab,
lots of great starter projects and

120
00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:29.522
cool things to check out there.

121
00:08:29.522 --> 00:08:34.388
And then the Community tab has
things like the Unity Blog,

122
00:08:34.388 --> 00:08:38.756
Answers, Forums, and
all sorts of great stuff, so

123
00:08:38.756 --> 00:08:42.842
I highly recommend you
explore that on your own.

124
00:08:42.842 --> 00:08:47.560
So I'm gonna jump back
into my slides here.

125
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.156
And once you have Unity installed,
once you have the Hub and

126
00:08:53.156 --> 00:08:59.060
the version of Unity that you're going to
use, you have to create a new project.

127
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:04.370
So I have a project that I'm going
to have you grab from GitHub today.

128
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:07.570
And we're going to just open
that as our starter project.

129
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:13.690
But if you were creating a new project,
you would go to the Create Project or

130
00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:18.665
new sorry, New Project button
in the upper right of the Hub.

131
00:09:18.665 --> 00:09:21.458
This process does change
pretty frequently.

132
00:09:21.458 --> 00:09:24.046
So this is how it works right now, but

133
00:09:24.046 --> 00:09:27.981
these instructions may not
necessarily always apply.

134
00:09:27.981 --> 00:09:31.890
The Hub does get frequent updates.

135
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.499
And then after you choose New Project,
you would choose one of the templates.

136
00:09:35.499 --> 00:09:41.350
So I would say in this case for this
WebGL project, you would choose 3D Core.

137
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.954
And then you name your project and
choose a location.

138
00:09:45.954 --> 00:09:49.735
So let's just jump over to the Hub, and

139
00:09:49.735 --> 00:09:54.554
I can show you a little bit
of what that looks like.

140
00:09:54.554 --> 00:09:57.588
You could click New project
in the upper right and

141
00:09:57.588 --> 00:10:01.000
then there's several
different project templates.

142
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.266
So here's the 3D Core.

143
00:10:03.266 --> 00:10:10.503
And this is just an empty 3D project,
and it uses Unity's built in renderer.

144
00:10:10.503 --> 00:10:13.544
There are several different
renderers that you can use that you

145
00:10:13.544 --> 00:10:16.998
can install from Unity's Package Manager,
which we'll talk about.

146
00:10:16.998 --> 00:10:23.251
But this is a good one to just get started
with, especially if you're a beginner.

147
00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:27.155
And then you would name your project and
choose a location,

148
00:10:27.155 --> 00:10:31.071
you would Create project and
then it would open up in Unity.

149
00:10:31.071 --> 00:10:35.401
So we're not gonna to do that,
I'll hit cancel here.

150
00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:41.520
We're actually going to
use a starter project.

151
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.561
So this starter project is available at

152
00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:53.648
github.com/nickpettit/unity-for-web-devel-
opers, with dashes.

153
00:10:53.648 --> 00:10:59.053
And in the Unity Hub's Projects tab,
after you pull it,

154
00:10:59.053 --> 00:11:04.008
we'll hit Open and
then we'll navigate to the Start

155
00:11:04.008 --> 00:11:08.297
project directory and
open that up in Unity.

156
00:11:08.297 --> 00:11:12.202
In this repo we have a start project and

157
00:11:12.202 --> 00:11:19.658
this is what we'll actually be opening
up in Unity, the start project.

158
00:11:19.658 --> 00:11:23.444
There's the complete
version of the project,

159
00:11:23.444 --> 00:11:29.225
which has all of the scripts and
also potentially answers to exercises.

160
00:11:29.225 --> 00:11:32.749
So no cheating, don't look there.

161
00:11:32.749 --> 00:11:37.582
And then there's a Resources folder
which just has the slides that
