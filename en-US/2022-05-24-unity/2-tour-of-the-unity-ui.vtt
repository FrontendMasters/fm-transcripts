WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.322 --> 00:00:06.797
And once that project is pulled,
You'll go to the unity hub.

2
00:00:06.797 --> 00:00:09.327
And you can either click Open here, or

3
00:00:09.327 --> 00:00:13.847
you can choose this little arrow
here if you want a few more options.

4
00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:18.238
So I would say Add project from disk.

5
00:00:18.238 --> 00:00:22.924
And I'll go to my Development folder,

6
00:00:22.924 --> 00:00:27.184
go into the folder for the repo, and

7
00:00:27.184 --> 00:00:30.876
then go into the Start folder.

8
00:00:30.876 --> 00:00:34.724
And mine will look a little bit different,
because I've already opened it up and

9
00:00:34.724 --> 00:00:36.546
Unity has generated a few metafiles.

10
00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:42.557
So your start project will
have a few less folders there.

11
00:00:42.557 --> 00:00:45.223
And then you would hit Add Project.

12
00:00:45.223 --> 00:00:47.809
So I've already done that.

13
00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.718
And I already have it
listed in the hub here.

14
00:00:50.718 --> 00:00:54.961
And you'll see that when you have
projects listed in the Unity hub,

15
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:58.615
I'm actually going to click this,
so it starts opening.

16
00:00:58.615 --> 00:01:01.527
But when you have projects
listed in the Unity hub,

17
00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:04.720
you can choose the editor
version that it opens up with.

18
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.689
So if I click that, it will bring up
all of the different versions that I

19
00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.976
could potentially open the project with,
and

20
00:01:12.976 --> 00:01:16.618
also the platform that I
can open the project with.

21
00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:22.424
So I've opened that up and

22
00:01:22.424 --> 00:01:28.125
I'll go ahead and zoom in on this window.

23
00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:33.852
And when you first open it up,
it should look something like this,

24
00:01:33.852 --> 00:01:39.091
you should have the same folders
here in the project window.

25
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:45.119
You might not have this scene open,
I'll get get into how to open that up,

26
00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.024
but generally this is
what it should look like.

27
00:01:49.024 --> 00:01:56.321
So, Let's go back slides here.

28
00:01:56.321 --> 00:01:59.581
And before we get into the project,
I wanna give you a brief tour of

29
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:02.665
the Unity interface,
because there's a lot of stuff there,

30
00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:06.242
it's kinda like sitting down at
the cockpit of a spatial or something.

31
00:02:06.242 --> 00:02:11.439
There's just all these buttons and
menus and tabs and windows, and

32
00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:16.377
it can be really overwhelming
the first time that you look at it.

33
00:02:16.377 --> 00:02:21.576
But the key idea here is that
this interface is rearrangeable.

34
00:02:21.576 --> 00:02:26.387
So like many modern interfaces,
it's comprised of these windows and

35
00:02:26.387 --> 00:02:30.311
tabs, and you can move them
around however you'd like.

36
00:02:30.311 --> 00:02:33.152
And that's very useful
in game development.

37
00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:37.333
Just as an example, if you're
developing a game for phones, and

38
00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:40.992
it's a game that's meant to
be played in portrait mode.

39
00:02:40.992 --> 00:02:45.453
It might be useful to
have your scene view and

40
00:02:45.453 --> 00:02:53.666
game view kind of in that more elongated
portrait mode, I guess, aspect ratio.

41
00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:57.446
And so yeah, rearranging these
windows is really useful,

42
00:02:57.446 --> 00:02:59.644
it's something I do all the time.

43
00:02:59.644 --> 00:03:02.196
And you can actually save layouts for

44
00:03:02.196 --> 00:03:05.658
different projects that
you might be working on.

45
00:03:05.658 --> 00:03:12.951
So let's get into a brief interface tour.

46
00:03:12.951 --> 00:03:15.410
So I'll jump back to Unity.

47
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.233
And something that you may wanna do
right now, if you've opened this up and

48
00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:25.855
you're a little bit confused,
is go to the upper right here

49
00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:30.213
where it says Layout, and
you can just choose Default.

50
00:03:30.213 --> 00:03:34.998
So if you ever rearrange your windows and
you're trying to get back to

51
00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:39.714
how things were, so I'll just kinda
drag some things around here.

52
00:03:39.714 --> 00:03:43.786
And if you've accidentally dragged
stuff all over the place and so much so

53
00:03:43.786 --> 00:03:48.197
that even the console's spitting out
errors, you don't know how to get back.

54
00:03:48.197 --> 00:03:53.449
You can always just go back
up to the upper right here,

55
00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:59.927
choose the default layout, and
it will take you right back.

56
00:03:59.927 --> 00:04:04.681
So we've got a couple of windows
here that are open by default.

57
00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:09.591
And the first one that you'll probably
notice more than any other is this big

58
00:04:09.591 --> 00:04:11.672
scene view right in the middle.

59
00:04:11.672 --> 00:04:18.194
So the scene view, as the name implies,
is how you navigate scenes in Unity.

60
00:04:18.194 --> 00:04:23.479
Scenes are assets that hold all
of the stuff that's in your game.

61
00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.609
So all of the things that are in your 3D
game world are going to be present and

62
00:04:28.609 --> 00:04:30.493
visible in the scene view.

63
00:04:30.493 --> 00:04:35.202
And if you hold down on a Mac option or
on Windows Alt,

64
00:04:35.202 --> 00:04:38.733
and then drag around in the scene view,

65
00:04:38.733 --> 00:04:43.888
you can orbit the camera, and
kind of take a look around.

66
00:04:43.888 --> 00:04:48.492
And, If you use

67
00:04:48.492 --> 00:04:53.567
the gizmo in the upper right here,
you can also kind of orbit

68
00:04:53.567 --> 00:04:59.065
the camera just by clicking on the x,
y, and z or widgets there.

69
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:08.624
And if you don't have the main scene open,
you might have a default scene open.

70
00:05:08.624 --> 00:05:12.169
You can come down to
the project window here, and

71
00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.032
you should see a folder called Scenes.

72
00:05:15.032 --> 00:05:19.451
I'm actually going to drag this little
slider down at the bottom here, so

73
00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:20.536
I get a list view.

74
00:05:20.536 --> 00:05:22.921
So that's what I prefer.

75
00:05:22.921 --> 00:05:25.033
Go to the Scenes folder and

76
00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:30.223
you should see a file called main.unity,
that is a scene file.

77
00:05:30.223 --> 00:05:34.385
And if you double click that,
I already have it open, but

78
00:05:34.385 --> 00:05:40.212
it will open up the main scene, which is
where we're going to be working today.

79
00:05:40.212 --> 00:05:43.104
So we've talked about the scene view.

80
00:05:43.104 --> 00:05:48.572
The project view is basically
just a file browser.

81
00:05:48.572 --> 00:05:53.014
So it gives you a window into all of
the stuff that's in your project.

82
00:05:53.014 --> 00:05:55.933
And this project has a few starter assets.

83
00:05:55.933 --> 00:06:01.197
So I've got an input assets that
we'll use for driving player input.

84
00:06:01.197 --> 00:06:05.113
There's some materials here
that we can click on and

85
00:06:05.113 --> 00:06:10.903
get a look at over here in the inspector,
which we'll talk about in a second.

86
00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:13.883
There's the Scenes folder,
which has the main scene.

87
00:06:13.883 --> 00:06:18.564
There's a Scripts folder, it already has a
script in it, that we'll also get to, but

88
00:06:18.564 --> 00:06:22.751
that's where we're going to be putting
all of our C# scripts as we develop.

89
00:06:22.751 --> 00:06:24.973
There are a few default settings.

90
00:06:24.973 --> 00:06:30.250
We have what's called
the Universal Render Pipeline,

91
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.402
which is the pipeline
that is best used for,

92
00:06:34.402 --> 00:06:38.566
really, I would say anything, actually.

93
00:06:38.566 --> 00:06:43.230
There's a few other render pipelines
that are for more specific purposes, but

94
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.128
the Universal Render Pipeline,
as the name implies, is great for

95
00:06:47.128 --> 00:06:48.882
just about any application.

96
00:06:48.882 --> 00:06:50.933
And then we also have a few textures here.

97
00:06:50.933 --> 00:06:54.807
So there's some stuff in
our project window already.

98
00:06:54.807 --> 00:06:58.682
And it's just kind of a detail view there.

99
00:06:58.682 --> 00:07:03.541
You can click on the folders here and
you can see what's in your project.

100
00:07:03.541 --> 00:07:07.637
Now, you may have noticed,
when I was clicking on these things,

101
00:07:07.637 --> 00:07:12.332
that I'm getting more information about
each one of these in this window on

102
00:07:12.332 --> 00:07:14.732
the right here called the inspector.

103
00:07:14.732 --> 00:07:19.891
The inspector allows you to see
more details about assets and

104
00:07:19.891 --> 00:07:22.534
GameObjects in your project.

105
00:07:22.534 --> 00:07:26.453
So when I click through
these different materials,

106
00:07:26.453 --> 00:07:29.221
I can see their various properties.

107
00:07:29.221 --> 00:07:33.228
And then I can also see
a preview of this material.

108
00:07:33.228 --> 00:07:36.474
And I can actually orbit this 3D view and

109
00:07:36.474 --> 00:07:42.301
take a look at this material in more
detail in kind of a default lighting or

110
00:07:42.301 --> 00:07:46.043
default environment here, just kinda nice.

111
00:07:46.043 --> 00:07:50.932
On the left side,
we have what's called the hierarchy.

112
00:07:50.932 --> 00:07:56.246
The hierarchy lists all of the GameObjects
that are in any open scenes.

113
00:07:56.246 --> 00:08:00.279
And I do say scenes plural,
you can have multiple scenes open, and

114
00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:02.812
they will be listed out in the hierarchy.

115
00:08:02.812 --> 00:08:06.264
We're only going to be working
in one scene today, just for

116
00:08:06.264 --> 00:08:07.724
the sake of simplicity.

117
00:08:07.724 --> 00:08:12.943
But you could potentially have multiple
scenes here that are collapsible.

118
00:08:12.943 --> 00:08:17.741
And then the hierarchy, it is called
the hierarchy because GameObjects can be

119
00:08:17.741 --> 00:08:19.786
nested underneath one another.

120
00:08:19.786 --> 00:08:24.685
So we have basically a parent-child
relationship here, or a tree,

121
00:08:24.685 --> 00:08:29.414
which if you're a web developer
should be pretty familiar to you,

122
00:08:29.414 --> 00:08:31.959
it's almost like the DOM, right?

123
00:08:31.959 --> 00:08:36.685
And in the scene,
I have a few GameObjects, I have a camera,

124
00:08:36.685 --> 00:08:41.248
I have a light, and
I have what's called an event system.

125
00:08:41.248 --> 00:08:44.447
But really,
those names are almost misnomers,

126
00:08:44.447 --> 00:08:47.187
because these are just all GameObjects.

127
00:08:47.187 --> 00:08:51.905
They all inherit from the same class.

128
00:08:51.905 --> 00:08:55.996
But they have these things called
components attached to them,

129
00:08:55.996 --> 00:08:57.974
which drives their behavior.

130
00:08:57.974 --> 00:09:01.007
So we'll get more into
the GameObject scene,

131
00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:03.744
component relationship in a little bit.

132
00:09:03.744 --> 00:09:10.826
So if this is sounding a little confusing,
we'll expand on that soon.

133
00:09:10.826 --> 00:09:15.373
So a few other windows that
are important to be aware of.

134
00:09:15.373 --> 00:09:19.861
Just like the scene view, we also have
another 3D view called the game view.

135
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:23.645
Right now,
there's nothing in the game view,

136
00:09:23.645 --> 00:09:29.525
because we don't have anything in our
scene other than this Skybox here.

137
00:09:29.525 --> 00:09:34.178
But the main camera is actually set to
just have a solid colored background,

138
00:09:34.178 --> 00:09:35.205
which is black.

139
00:09:35.205 --> 00:09:38.927
But the game view renders
what this camera is seeing.

140
00:09:38.927 --> 00:09:43.141
So it's kind of a preview of what
your game is going to look like.

141
00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:47.926
And there's a few useful
additional buttons up here,

142
00:09:47.926 --> 00:09:51.157
such as the resolution drop-down.

143
00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:54.928
So right now,
it's just in three aspects, so

144
00:09:54.928 --> 00:10:00.455
it will conform the game to whatever
aspect ratio my game view is in.

145
00:10:00.455 --> 00:10:04.048
But if you were, say,
working on a console game and

146
00:10:04.048 --> 00:10:09.997
you knew it was going to be deployed to
televisions, you would want to use 16:9.

147
00:10:09.997 --> 00:10:12.877
Or even a specific resolution like 4K, so

148
00:10:12.877 --> 00:10:17.037
that you knew exactly what
everything was going to look like,

149
00:10:17.037 --> 00:10:22.168
how everything was gonna be framed,
how the UI would show up, and so forth.

150
00:10:22.168 --> 00:10:25.989
But I'm just gonna leave
this on free aspect for now.

151
00:10:25.989 --> 00:10:32.322
There is the console window down
here next to the project window.

152
00:10:32.322 --> 00:10:38.573
And this will show you various errors,
warnings, debug output.

153
00:10:38.573 --> 00:10:43.505
Hopefully we don't need the console window
today, we don't hit any errors, but

154
00:10:43.505 --> 00:10:47.021
if errors do come up,
that's where they'll be visible.

155
00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:53.229
And it's surprising how great Unity is
at having really good error messages.

156
00:10:53.229 --> 00:10:58.527
You can double-click these, dig into
the lines where you're having a problem,

157
00:10:58.527 --> 00:11:03.771
and usually get pretty good information
about what's going on in your scripts.

158
00:11:03.771 --> 00:11:05.866
And then right here at the top,

159
00:11:05.866 --> 00:11:10.225
maybe the most important part of
the interface is a Play button.

160
00:11:10.225 --> 00:11:15.173
So the really cool thing about developing
in Unity is that you don't need

161
00:11:15.173 --> 00:11:18.915
to compile your game every
time you want to test it out.

162
00:11:18.915 --> 00:11:20.986
You can just work on scripts.

163
00:11:20.986 --> 00:11:25.036
You can change things in the inspector,
you can add and remove GameObjects,

164
00:11:25.036 --> 00:11:27.349
whatever, and you can hit the Play button.

165
00:11:27.349 --> 00:11:30.842
And right now,
it's going to do nothing at all,

166
00:11:30.842 --> 00:11:35.972
the game is actually playing, but
we don't have anything in the game.

167
00:11:35.972 --> 00:11:39.593
But if we did, you would actually
be able to get a preview here, and

168
00:11:39.593 --> 00:11:42.841
it would look just like the WebGL
preview that I showed you.

169
00:11:42.841 --> 00:11:48.217
It looks exactly like what your game is
going to look like when it's built and

170
00:11:48.217 --> 00:11:49.063
deployed.

171
00:11:49.063 --> 00:11:55.046
So that is kind of a whirlwind
tour of the Unity interface.

172
00:11:55.046 --> 00:11:58.684
There's a lot more to learn here, but

173
00:11:58.684 --> 00:12:03.128
I'm going to let you
explore that on your own.

174
00:12:03.128 --> 00:12:08.210
You can come up to the Window menu here
and see some of the other windows,

175
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:12.460
the ones that I showed were just
under the General tab here.

176
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.345
So we covered the scene, game,
inspector, hierarchy, project,

177
00:12:17.345 --> 00:12:20.717
console window, but
there's also windows for

178
00:12:20.717 --> 00:12:26.301
exploring all of the lights in your game
and digging into animation and audio.

179
00:12:26.301 --> 00:12:30.862
There are all kinds of debugging and
profiling and analysis for

180
00:12:30.862 --> 00:12:35.345
digging into the performance
characteristics of your game.

181
00:12:35.345 --> 00:12:40.227
So there's a lot here, but these
are really just the main windows that

182
00:12:40.227 --> 00:12:44.884
even as a professional you're gonna
be working with all the time.

183
00:12:44.884 --> 00:12:49.553
So probably the most important
tip that I covered there,

184
00:12:49.553 --> 00:12:55.774
if you take one thing away from that,
is if you get lost, in the upper right,

185
00:12:55.774 --> 00:13:02.414
you can choose the default layout if you
wanna just get back to where you started.

186
00:13:02.414 --> 00:13:05.044
So just to recap all of that really quick.

187
00:13:05.044 --> 00:13:09.236
Again, we have the scene view,
which is the 3D view of all of

188
00:13:09.236 --> 00:13:13.197
the GameObjects in the currently
open scenes, plural.

189
00:13:13.197 --> 00:13:16.306
There's the game view,
which is a preview of the game camera.

190
00:13:16.306 --> 00:13:22.550
The hierarchy is a list of all of the
GameObjects that are in the current scene.

191
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:27.094
There's the inspector, which is
a detail-view of the currently selected

192
00:13:27.094 --> 00:13:29.869
GameObject or
the currently selected asset.

193
00:13:29.869 --> 00:13:34.348
The project window is a file browser for
the currently open Unity project.

194
00:13:34.348 --> 00:13:40.841
The console outputs from scripts and
shows you debug information and errors.

195
00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:45.520
And then the Play button at the very
top runs your game in the Unity Editor
