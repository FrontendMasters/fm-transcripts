00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.752
So next I have an exercise here,
and we need a way for

2
00:00:05.752 --> 00:00:10.974
both the player and
the opponent to get back to their

3
00:00:10.974 --> 00:00:16.440
original position if they
get knocked off the board,

4
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.271
right, so we wanna do this
inside of RollingMovement and

5
00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:25.700
we want to add a Y-height check.

6
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.866
So if the Y position of either
of the spheres is below

7
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:36.515
the respawn height that we
created in the GameManager,

8
00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:41.310
we should reset
the position of the sphere.

9
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.402
So if the spheres fall off the side of the
board, we should reset the position and

10
00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:51.344
remember again, in the GameManager we
created a globally accessible static

11
00:00:51.344 --> 00:00:54.688
variable to hold what
the respawn height should be,

12
00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:58.130
you should use that to
reset the position here.

13
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.928
And again, this is a snippet of code,
but inside a fixed

14
00:01:02.928 --> 00:01:08.252
update you want to do this on
the RollingMovement component.
