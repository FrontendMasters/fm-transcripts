1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.424
So there's one more important
window that you should know about.

2
00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:09.823
We shouldn't need it today, you should
have all of the packages that we're going

3
00:00:09.823 --> 00:00:15.391
to need already installed, because they're
installed with the starter project.

4
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:20.759
Unity has what's called a package manifest
file, so it already knows all the packages

5
00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.965
that you need to have installed and
it will put them in there for you.

6
00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:27.912
And they actually should
probably be in the repo.

7
00:00:27.912 --> 00:00:33.683
So you already have all the stuff, but the
Unity package manager is really amazing.

8
00:00:33.683 --> 00:00:37.553
It allows you to install
more functionality than just

9
00:00:37.553 --> 00:00:40.566
the default that is included with Unity.

10
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:45.877
So just to give you a couple of examples,
the non-default packages

11
00:00:45.877 --> 00:00:52.135
that are already installed in this project
are the universal render pipeline.

12
00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:57.442
So that again is just a basic 3D
rendering pipeline that's suitable for

13
00:00:57.442 --> 00:00:59.617
just about any application.

14
00:00:59.617 --> 00:01:01.796
We have the input system installed.

15
00:01:01.796 --> 00:01:06.585
So Unity is migrating to
a new way of doing input.

16
00:01:06.585 --> 00:01:09.044
And there is the default input system,

17
00:01:09.044 --> 00:01:12.258
which is already included
in every Unity project.

18
00:01:12.258 --> 00:01:17.032
But the new input system is
being handled as a package.

19
00:01:17.032 --> 00:01:21.228
And it's just a much more modern
approach to input handling.

20
00:01:21.228 --> 00:01:24.790
It's actually really cool,
you can create actions and

21
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.065
those actions can drive
multiple types of inputs.

22
00:01:28.065 --> 00:01:33.579
So you could have a button for,
say, firing a laser.

23
00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.482
And then you could tie that
to a button on a keyboard,

24
00:01:37.482 --> 00:01:41.409
a button on a gamepad,
a button on a VR device, etc.

25
00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:48.525
And then we also have another package
called TextMesh Pro, and that's for UI.

26
00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:55.159
It's just a much better alternative to
Unity's default rendering for UI text.

27
00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.345
So the big advantage of using Unity over

28
00:02:00.345 --> 00:02:07.115
other game engines in my
opinion is the ecosystem.

29
00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:11.066
Unity comes with just
this amazing community,

30
00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:18.287
an amazing set of documentation, there's
all of the packages that I just mentioned.

31
00:02:18.287 --> 00:02:23.187
There's the Asset Store,
there's Unity services, and

32
00:02:23.187 --> 00:02:26.087
we will dig into each one of these.

33
00:02:26.087 --> 00:02:32.638
So the first really great thing about
Unity is how well it's documented.

34
00:02:32.638 --> 00:02:37.236
There is excellent documentation for
Unity, and that comes in two forms.

35
00:02:37.236 --> 00:02:42.007
There is the Unity manual, and
there is the scripting API.

36
00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:48.458
So the manual is a much more human
readable set of documentation.

37
00:02:48.458 --> 00:02:50.404
So I'll click on that.

38
00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:53.662
And this is what it looks like.

39
00:02:53.662 --> 00:02:55.217
This is the Unity manual.

40
00:02:55.217 --> 00:03:00.566
And on the left side, there's lots
of different categories about all of

41
00:03:00.566 --> 00:03:06.630
the different areas and features of Unity,
such as input and graphics and audio.

42
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.668
And on the right side is the page
that you're currently viewing.

43
00:03:10.668 --> 00:03:16.139
And this can actually be read like a book,
you can just click on these arrows here.

44
00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.654
And you can read this like a manual for
using Unity.

45
00:03:20.654 --> 00:03:25.556
It is incredibly dense and there is so

46
00:03:25.556 --> 00:03:28.566
much to dig into here.

47
00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:32.747
But even after using Unity for
years and years,

48
00:03:32.747 --> 00:03:37.671
sometimes I will just go to
various pages for features.

49
00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:43.173
And let's say rendering pipelines and
using the Universal Render Pipeline.

50
00:03:43.173 --> 00:03:47.232
And I'll just kind of
leaf through this and

51
00:03:47.232 --> 00:03:52.432
read as much as I can,
because there's a lot to learn.

52
00:03:52.432 --> 00:04:00.058
So let's see if I can find
maybe a better example here.

53
00:04:00.058 --> 00:04:02.633
Let's see, this is materials.

54
00:04:02.633 --> 00:04:10.233
Yeah, so like using materials and applying
them to your game objects and meshes.

55
00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:15.167
This tells you everything that you need
to know about how to assign a material

56
00:04:15.167 --> 00:04:19.036
to a game object,
which is something that we'll do later.

57
00:04:19.036 --> 00:04:21.667
So the Unity manual is just great,

58
00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:25.850
there's lots of great
screenshots to help you along.

59
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.633
And something else that you'll
notice is that a lot of times,

60
00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:34.242
you'll come across a Unity manual page
that will say Switch to Scripting.

61
00:04:34.242 --> 00:04:39.258
So if I click that,
it will bring me over to the other set of

62
00:04:39.258 --> 00:04:45.332
Unity documentation that I mentioned,
which is the scripting API.

63
00:04:45.332 --> 00:04:50.216
And you'll see at the top here, with the
Unity documentation, it has both linked.

64
00:04:50.216 --> 00:04:52.064
So I was looking at materials.

65
00:04:52.064 --> 00:04:57.830
Now, in the scripting API,
we have a very similar interface here.

66
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.198
So I can scroll through all
of the different namespaces.

67
00:05:01.198 --> 00:05:04.558
There's the Unity engine,
the Unity editor,

68
00:05:04.558 --> 00:05:08.422
if you're actually writing
custom editor scripts and

69
00:05:08.422 --> 00:05:13.138
you wanna make custom windows,
the Unity namespace, and other.

70
00:05:13.138 --> 00:05:17.921
[LAUGH] So most of what you'll need
is in the Unity engine namespace and

71
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:22.138
then there's several additional
namespaces within that.

72
00:05:22.138 --> 00:05:26.617
But I was on the material
page to the manual,

73
00:05:26.617 --> 00:05:31.824
I clicked Switch to Scripting,
and it brought me to

74
00:05:31.824 --> 00:05:37.044
the material class in
the Unity engine namespace.

75
00:05:37.044 --> 00:05:40.454
And I can just scroll through here and

76
00:05:40.454 --> 00:05:46.064
look at all of the different
properties that a material has,

77
00:05:46.064 --> 00:05:50.800
and all of its public methods,
its constructors.

78
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.374
And if I click on any one of these,

79
00:05:54.374 --> 00:05:59.879
it will drill down and
tell me about that property.

80
00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:03.031
So every material has a color.

81
00:06:03.031 --> 00:06:07.462
And again, I'm just using
materials as an example, but

82
00:06:07.462 --> 00:06:13.852
every material has a color, and its color
is of type color, you can click on that.

83
00:06:13.852 --> 00:06:16.195
It's kinda like going down
a Wikipedia rabbit hole.

84
00:06:16.195 --> 00:06:18.859
I mean,
you can just kinda click on these and

85
00:06:18.859 --> 00:06:22.462
look at all of the different
classes that are within Unity.

86
00:06:22.462 --> 00:06:28.390
So the API surface is huge in Unity.

87
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.658
There is so
much stuff to dig into and learn, but

88
00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:40.264
that's why I stressed the documentation so
much, is that I'm in here all the time.

89
00:06:40.264 --> 00:06:45.964
I'm looking at the Unity documentation
every day and it's not something that

90
00:06:45.964 --> 00:06:52.107
you're really going to memorize a whole
lot of, unless you're using it every day.

91
00:06:52.107 --> 00:06:59.423
So this is a really valuable resource,
the Unity manual and the scripting API.

92
00:06:59.423 --> 00:07:05.036
Now, as you get further into Unity,
there's also the Asset Store.

93
00:07:05.036 --> 00:07:11.898
The Asset Store is really cool, and it
looks like they're having a very big sale,

94
00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:15.884
they're super excited
about [LAUGH] right now.

95
00:07:15.884 --> 00:07:20.236
But the Asset Store is a place where you

96
00:07:20.236 --> 00:07:25.007
can get additional assets for your game.

97
00:07:25.007 --> 00:07:29.083
A lot of them are paid,
a lot of them are free, but

98
00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:32.961
this is everything you can think of for
a game,

99
00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:37.735
such as scripts or materials,
meshes, sound effects,

100
00:07:37.735 --> 00:07:42.428
things for animation,
shaders, I mean, you name it.

101
00:07:42.428 --> 00:07:46.625
This is actually really a great one,
Easy Save.

102
00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:50.699
I've used Easy Save for
creating save game data.

103
00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:55.243
So that abstracts the whole
problem of saving data across all

104
00:07:55.243 --> 00:08:00.334
the different devices that you
could potentially deploy a game to.

105
00:08:00.334 --> 00:08:05.360
So if you're deploying to Playstation and
iOS and PC,

106
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:11.369
all of those save data in different
ways to different locations,

107
00:08:11.369 --> 00:08:14.445
and it just abstracts that away.

108
00:08:14.445 --> 00:08:19.144
So the Asset Store alone
is a great reason for

109
00:08:19.144 --> 00:08:25.113
using Unity, you can get a lot
of leverage out of this and

110
00:08:25.113 --> 00:08:29.946
get pieces of your game
in pretty big chunks.

111
00:08:29.946 --> 00:08:34.345
So there's also just the community.

112
00:08:34.345 --> 00:08:37.159
The Unity blog is really great.

113
00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:41.419
There's a question and
answer style forum there,

114
00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:46.481
which is kinda like your stack
overflow for Unity, I guess.

115
00:08:46.481 --> 00:08:50.731
And then there is also the forums.

116
00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:56.745
And that's, again, really great place
to just learn about what's going on,

117
00:08:56.745 --> 00:09:01.413
dig into some of the problems
that other people are having that

118
00:09:01.413 --> 00:09:05.310
maybe can help you solve
some of your own problems.

119
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:11.283
And I've been in some pretty
difficult situations in the past and

120
00:09:11.283 --> 00:09:14.766
the forums have gotten me out of them.

121
00:09:14.766 --> 00:09:19.722
And the great thing about the forums
is that they're also moderated by

122
00:09:19.722 --> 00:09:21.072
Unity employees.

123
00:09:21.072 --> 00:09:26.679
So Unity is actually in there answering
questions and digging into potential

124
00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:31.695
issues about the engine, or
they'll have you upload your project.

125
00:09:31.695 --> 00:09:35.038
It's really, really great.

126
00:09:35.038 --> 00:09:40.134
And then finally, there's Unity Services.

127
00:09:40.134 --> 00:09:47.799
So this is a thing that's
provided by Unity.

128
00:09:47.799 --> 00:09:51.704
So it is paid in a lot of cases.

129
00:09:51.704 --> 00:09:56.837
There's still a lot of value you
can get out of this for free, but

130
00:09:56.837 --> 00:10:03.705
this a whole other world of stuff, where
you can add, say, analytics to your games.

131
00:10:03.705 --> 00:10:08.293
So if you are creating a game
that is going on iOS and

132
00:10:08.293 --> 00:10:14.519
it's going to be free to play,
they have tools for monetization and

133
00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:20.551
analyzing player behavior and
adding multiplayer and netcode.

134
00:10:20.551 --> 00:10:23.653
I mean, it's really fantastic.

135
00:10:23.653 --> 00:10:26.980
I've used a lot of Unity
services in the past.

136
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.147
But again, we're building a simple game.

137
00:10:29.147 --> 00:10:34.897
It's kind of a whirlwind tour,
but that is all of the really

138
00:10:34.897 --> 00:10:40.540
great stuff that I think makes
Unity a great engine to use.
