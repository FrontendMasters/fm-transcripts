00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.149
So let's move on to post processing,
the game could still

2
00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:10.199
look a little bit better,
it kind of looks washed out to me,

3
00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:15.470
and kinda needs a little bit
more to make it look complete.

4
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.424
So post processing can improve
the look of a game by applying full

5
00:00:20.424 --> 00:00:24.780
screen effects after
a frame has been rendered.

6
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.318
So you can think of post processing
kind of like Photoshop effects or

7
00:00:29.318 --> 00:00:31.300
Instagram filters.

8
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.080
And many effects tend to simulate
the properties of a real world camera.

9
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.812
So for example,
post processing effects can include bloom,

10
00:00:42.812 --> 00:00:47.178
which applies a soft blur to
some brighter parts of the image

11
00:00:47.178 --> 00:00:51.830
particularly in an HDR rendering
pipeline which we are using.

12
00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:00.390
Tonemapping remaps HDR images into
linear dynamic range for your screen.

13
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.756
Chromatic aberration adds
subtle color shifting towards

14
00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:08.820
the edges of a camera lens.

15
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.150
And that kinda simulates the breakdown
of light into its component parts.

16
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.878
So as you get closer to the curvature
of that camera lens, you would expect

17
00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:23.280
white light to break down into a rainbow
so it kind of gives that effect.

18
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.470
You can add a vignette to darken the edges
of an image and help highlight the center.

19
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.550
And then there's another one I like called
Panini projection, which warps the view.

20
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.918
Again, similar to a camera lens,

21
00:01:36.918 --> 00:01:42.850
you expect a lens to apply some
amount of warping to an image.

22
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.129
So let's go back to Unity and
apply all of those things,

23
00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:49.870
I'll go ahead and save this scene.

24
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.660
And to do this,
we're going to use what's called a volume.

25
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.840
So I'll go up to the Create menu here.

26
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.650
And I'll go to the Volume menu, and
I'm going to create a new global volume.

27
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.937
And it's fine if it's just
called global volume.

28
00:02:13.102 --> 00:02:16.330
I'll reset that to the center.

29
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.898
And a lot of the times,
you can use volumes as local volumes.

30
00:02:22.898 --> 00:02:28.176
So if the player is, say,
moving through a space, like a dark cave,

31
00:02:28.176 --> 00:02:33.364
and then out into an more open area,
you might wanna apply different

32
00:02:33.364 --> 00:02:38.115
post processing effects,
depending on where the player is.

33
00:02:38.115 --> 00:02:41.515
And so these volumes kind of
act like trigger colliders.

34
00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:44.709
They will trigger different
post processing effects and

35
00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.890
potentially other things
if you want them to.

36
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.730
And they can be weighted against one
another and loop between one another.

37
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.830
It's a really cool system, but
we're going to use it for post processing.

38
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.930
Right now it doesn't have any kind
of post processing volume profile.

39
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.441
So I'll just hit the New
button to create a new one.

40
00:03:06.441 --> 00:03:09.549
And I'm gonna switch
over to the game view so

41
00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.920
that we can see what effect each one
of these is having as we apply it.

42
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.700
So I'm going to add bloom, and there's
some checkboxes we need to hit there.

43
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.589
So we need to enable the thresholds and
intensity,

44
00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:31.918
I'll set that to an intensity of, say, 1.

45
00:03:34.182 --> 00:03:38.837
And I'll enable high quality
filtering there, just so

46
00:03:38.837 --> 00:03:43.790
we get a few benefits of higher
quality filtering which will

47
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.469
allow it to not maybe flicker quite so
much.

48
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.120
And there's other things you can add here,

49
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.040
I encourage you to play with these
settings, but let's keep going.

50
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.838
We'll add tonemapping, and then we need
to check that we want to use that.

51
00:04:01.838 --> 00:04:09.092
We'll set the mode to ACES, which I
forget exactly what that stands for,

52
00:04:09.092 --> 00:04:15.420
but it is a standard set by the academy,
as in the Oscars.

53
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.490
And so
it's a pretty good tone mapping technique.

54
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.120
We'll apply chromatic aberration.

55
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.271
And for this one, there's just an
intensity slider, but as I slide that to

56
00:04:28.271 --> 00:04:33.730
a very extreme value, you can see what
it's doing at the edges of the image.

57
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.270
I don't want it to be quite that intense.

58
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.846
So I'll just set it to
maybe a value of 0.1,

59
00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:44.490
just to give us a little bit
of chromatic aberration.

60
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.402
And this is one of those things where
a lot of subtle effects add up to

61
00:04:49.402 --> 00:04:53.400
an image that is greater
than the sum of its parts.

62
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.010
So we'll have that subtle
chromatic aberration.

63
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.800
We're going to add a vignette and
increase the intensity.

64
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.820
Again, this is something that beginners
tend to get very carried away with, so

65
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.301
that's what an extreme value looks like,
we don't want to do that.

66
00:05:11.301 --> 00:05:16.466
So we'll just set this to maybe
a value of 0.2 or something like that.

67
00:05:16.466 --> 00:05:21.758
And I'll turn this on and
off so you can see how it's kind

68
00:05:21.758 --> 00:05:28.063
of darkening the edges of the image,
and that just has a tendency to

69
00:05:28.063 --> 00:05:33.378
kind of brighten up the center
of the image by contrast.

70
00:05:33.378 --> 00:05:38.090
So finally, I'll add Panini projection,

71
00:05:40.078 --> 00:05:44.201
And that's going to warp the image so

72
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:50.710
that we get some of the properties
of a physical camera.

73
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:58.170
And again, I wanna keep this subtle, so
maybe a value of 0.1 should look good.

74
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:04.928
And that's actually pretty intense,
let's do that a little less, maybe 0.05.

75
00:06:04.928 --> 00:06:06.906
I think that looks good.

76
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.189
And something you may have noticed
is that when we applied bloom,

77
00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:17.323
this collectible kinda got brighter.

78
00:06:17.323 --> 00:06:22.637
And it's because it's using
an emissive surface that's actually

79
00:06:22.637 --> 00:06:28.695
just setting a color as its default
color that it's displaying to the world,

80
00:06:28.695 --> 00:06:34.118
it's kind of overriding some of
the other properties of the shader.

81
00:06:34.118 --> 00:06:35.786
So we have this global volume.

82
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.247
I'll hit Play.

83
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:46.811
And now we got a much nicer looking image.

84
00:06:46.811 --> 00:06:51.533
It's kind of much closer to
the physical properties that you would

85
00:06:51.533 --> 00:06:53.902
expect from a real world camera.
