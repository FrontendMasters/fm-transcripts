00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.863
Now that we've learned a little
bit about coding in unity,

2
00:00:05.863 --> 00:00:08.303
I have an exercise for us.

3
00:00:08.303 --> 00:00:13.350
So, we need to make a new
component called score.

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.870
Score is going to be a simple component,

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.510
that will keep track of each
player's individual score.

6
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.553
So this will be applied to player
a game object, and then we also will

7
00:00:24.553 --> 00:00:29.959
create an opponent game object later
on that it will also get applied to.

8
00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:35.340
And later will actually update this
script, so that it can interact with UI.

9
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.649
So here's kinda the starting
script that you should create for

10
00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:50.242
this exercise and we'll use a C# property
to store the score as an integer type,

11
00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:55.621
so up here at the top we have,
what's called a property.

12
00:00:55.621 --> 00:01:01.594
And that way the value
can be accessed publicly,

13
00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:06.320
but only modified via this script.

14
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.828
So other components, other scripts will
be able to access this score value.

15
00:01:11.828 --> 00:01:16.789
But it can only be set within
the script because it's a property with

16
00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.690
a public getter, but a private setter.

17
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:28.089
So the exercise is to write
a method to reset that score value,

18
00:01:28.089 --> 00:01:34.800
and then another method
to increment the value.

19
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.289
So we want to increment
the value by one and

20
00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.890
when it gets reset we
wanna set it back to zero.

21
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.884
So I'll give everyone a little bit
of time to write out this script.

22
00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:59.270
And, I guess when we are done,
I can go over the solution.
