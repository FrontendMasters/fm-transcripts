00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.197
So our game doesn't really have any camera
movement right now, it's a static camera.

2
00:00:07.197 --> 00:00:11.318
It would be a lot more interesting and
dynamic if the camera was

3
00:00:11.318 --> 00:00:15.924
actually moving around and
attempting to follow some of the action.

4
00:00:15.924 --> 00:00:22.288
So using what we've learned so far, I want
you to try to stretch a little bit and

5
00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:27.498
create a script component called
CameraMovement that attaches

6
00:00:27.498 --> 00:00:33.489
to the camera GameObject and moves
the camera gently to frame the action.

7
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.926
So I've got a couple hints here,
and I'll give you one more.

8
00:00:38.926 --> 00:00:44.752
So the first hint is you should use
Vector3.Lerp() inside of Update(),

9
00:00:44.752 --> 00:00:49.990
not fixed update,
to move the camera's position every frame.

10
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.400
The reason you wanna use Update()
is because it's the camera,

11
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.570
it's was rendering things every frame.

12
00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.850
So you do actually want it to move at
the frame rate to capture the action.

13
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.522
The second hint is, you'll probably
want to calculate the camera's

14
00:01:07.522 --> 00:01:11.332
position by offsetting it by
some distance from the board.

15
00:01:11.332 --> 00:01:16.508
Because if you just have a target,

16
00:01:16.508 --> 00:01:24.016
it's not going to be offset correctly,
I guess.

17
00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:28.825
So yeah, so you need to set
the movement target to the target's

18
00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:31.378
position plus some X, Z offset.

19
00:01:31.378 --> 00:01:35.701
And then you need to linearly
interpolate the position from

20
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:38.388
the current position to the target.

21
00:01:38.388 --> 00:01:40.938
And I said I had one more hint for
you, and

22
00:01:40.938 --> 00:01:46.350
that is that you won't actually need to
access the camera component to do this.

23
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.188
You should just be able to do this
with the game object's transform.
