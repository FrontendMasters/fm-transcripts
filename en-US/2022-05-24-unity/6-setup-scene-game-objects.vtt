WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.500
So, next we need to actually
set up things in our Scene.

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.567
So we're going to use simple primitives,
just a cube and

3
00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:15.150
a couple of spheres to represent
all the things in our game world.

4
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.736
And I have some specific
values that we want to use

5
00:00:18.736 --> 00:00:22.334
to actually position those
things in the world.

6
00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:27.400
And I have them listed out here in
the slides just as reference but,

7
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.660
I'm going to switch over to Unity and
actually add these things now.

8
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.871
So, something I wanted to point out just
really quickly in the Scene view is that

9
00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:41.800
if your scene looks a little
bit different than mine,

10
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.250
I have this Skybox here that's
kind of a studio environment and

11
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.720
that will be reflected on to
game objects in the Scene.

12
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.987
If you don't have that,
that's totally okay.

13
00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:53.511
It's still there in the project but

14
00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:58.556
you can toggle the visibility of that,
you can toggle the Skybox fog and

15
00:00:58.556 --> 00:01:03.960
various other effects with this button
in the upper right of the Scene view.

16
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.380
So it looks like a little stack with a
little star on top of it, and if you click

17
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.751
that you'll get more of a grey default
environment that you might expect.

18
00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:18.696
And one other really important thing
that I want to point out is that,

19
00:01:18.696 --> 00:01:23.187
if your hierarchy looks completely
different and you don't have some of these

20
00:01:23.187 --> 00:01:27.670
gizmos in the Scene, it might be because
you have a different Scene opened.

21
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.050
It's very important to go to your
project window, assets, Scenes, and

22
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.019
make sure that you double
click this main Scene and

23
00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:39.627
that's what you have open because
that's where we're going to be working.

24
00:01:39.627 --> 00:01:44.042
So I'm going to create that cube for
our game board, and to do that,

25
00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:47.914
I'm going to come to the upper
left of the hierarchy here and

26
00:01:47.914 --> 00:01:53.380
click this plus button, and that will
open what's called the Create menu.

27
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.630
And there's a lot of things
in Unity that we can create.

28
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.572
We can create empty game objects,
empty child game objects,

29
00:02:01.572 --> 00:02:06.514
and we can also create 3D objects,
like cubes and spheres and

30
00:02:06.514 --> 00:02:09.570
other primitive 3D objects.

31
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.521
So, I'm going to choose cube here.

32
00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:15.840
And when you create a new game object,

33
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.900
it will give you
the opportunity to rename it.

34
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.755
So, I'm going to change this
to board because this cube is

35
00:02:24.755 --> 00:02:29.924
going to be kind of like a coffee
table game board in our world.

36
00:02:29.924 --> 00:02:35.341
And with the board selected,
you'll notice over in the inspector

37
00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:42.230
that there are several components that
are already added to this game object.

38
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.680
Every game object has a transform
component by default, so

39
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.475
if I select some of these other game
objects like the main camera or

40
00:02:49.475 --> 00:02:54.029
the directional light, you'll see that
they also have a transform component

41
00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:56.030
that places them in the 3D world.

42
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.147
And if I go back to the board,

43
00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:05.030
you'll see that it is at
the origin of the world.

44
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.582
So, it is at position 0,
rotation 0 and scale 0.

45
00:03:09.582 --> 00:03:11.930
There's a couple of different
ways we can move it around.

46
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.819
So again, if I hold down Option on Mac or
Alt on Windows,

47
00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:23.880
I can actually orbit the camera here and
take a look around this game object.

48
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.928
And if I want to frame it up, I can hit
the F button just to get closer in or

49
00:03:28.928 --> 00:03:32.879
I can use the mouse scroll
wheel to kind of go in and out.

50
00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.601
To manipulate this game object,

51
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:37.960
there's a couple of different
tools here in this panel.

52
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:44.531
So I can use the transform tool or sorry,
the move tool here, to move this around,

53
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:50.170
I can click and drag on these arrows and
I can move it up and down in the y.

54
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.373
And you'll see as I'm doing that, it
updates the inspector on the right side,

55
00:03:54.373 --> 00:03:57.490
so the y value is updating
as I'm doing that.

56
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.570
I can also click between the arrows in
the move tool to lock it to a plane.

57
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.417
So if I just want to move this cube
along the x, z plane, I can do that.

58
00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:12.629
And then of course,
there's also the Rotate tool,

59
00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.750
so that will adjust the rotation.

60
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.990
If I just kind of click and
drag in the middle of that,

61
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.914
I can rotate this cube freely.

62
00:04:19.914 --> 00:04:26.379
But I'm going to hit Command Z on Mac or
Ctrl Z on Windows to undo some of those,

63
00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:32.460
because we're actually just going to
type in values for this directly.

64
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.368
So, the position for the x and
z will remain at 0, but for

65
00:04:38.368 --> 00:04:41.827
y, we want to place this cube at 0.5.

66
00:04:41.827 --> 00:04:45.706
So it's a little bit off the ground, and

67
00:04:45.706 --> 00:04:51.756
if I rotate you'll actually see
that it is now planar to the grid

68
00:04:51.756 --> 00:04:58.450
because every cube in Unity by default,
has a size of 1 cubed.

69
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.164
And one is, well,

70
00:05:01.164 --> 00:05:06.423
the default unit in Unity is meters,

71
00:05:06.423 --> 00:05:11.003
and so this cube has a volume or,

72
00:05:11.003 --> 00:05:14.880
area of 1 meter cube.

73
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.611
So, this cube is at 0.5.

74
00:05:18.611 --> 00:05:22.640
So because it's one unit tall,
it's half off the ground and

75
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.569
that's why it's now planar to the ground.

76
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.178
We're gonna create a couple of
spheres now, to represent the player,

77
00:05:31.178 --> 00:05:34.060
the opponent and the collectible.

78
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.430
And to do that, again we'll go to
the create menu and the hierarchy here.

79
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.611
I'll select the 3D object and
choose sphere.

80
00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:48.350
And this one, I will call player.

81
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.711
And this sphere, if you look at it is way

82
00:05:55.711 --> 00:06:00.073
too large for our game board here.

83
00:06:00.073 --> 00:06:04.763
So you can also pan around
by holding down Option and

84
00:06:04.763 --> 00:06:09.370
Command on Mac to kind of just pan there.

85
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.373
But this is way too large for
our game board, so

86
00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:16.463
we need to adjust the scale of this.

87
00:06:16.463 --> 00:06:23.706
So the scale for
the player sphere will be 0.1.

88
00:06:23.706 --> 00:06:29.330
And we want to adjust that on the x,
y, and z.

89
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:35.457
So 0.1 for the scale,
and then the position,

90
00:06:35.457 --> 00:06:40.987
we're going to put this at an x of -0.3,

91
00:06:40.987 --> 00:06:46.190
y is 1.75, and then the z can be 0.

92
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.326
So, this is going to place this, so

93
00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:55.120
that it's going to actually
drop into the game board.

94
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.370
These gizmos are a little big,
these gizmo icons are a little bit large.

95
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.177
To adjust that, you can well either
toggle the visibility of them or

96
00:07:05.177 --> 00:07:09.420
you can select this menu and
I'm going to uncheck 3D icons.

97
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.858
So if those are a little bit
large in your Scene view,

98
00:07:12.858 --> 00:07:15.838
you can do that in this
upper right menu here.

99
00:07:15.838 --> 00:07:19.689
So yeah, I've got this sphere here and

100
00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:25.418
that's going to drop into
the world when the game starts.

101
00:07:25.418 --> 00:07:30.633
Now, we also need a collectible,
and that will be the little

102
00:07:30.633 --> 00:07:35.249
purple sphere that each
player is trying to collect.

103
00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:40.163
So I will create a new 3D object,
a new sphere here,

104
00:07:40.163 --> 00:07:43.530
and we'll call this collectible.

105
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:52.990
And we'll position this at an x of 0,

106
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:58.933
a y of 1.05, and as z of 0.

107
00:07:58.933 --> 00:08:01.917
And then again, this is way too large,

108
00:08:01.917 --> 00:08:06.090
we want it to actually be
even smaller than the player.

109
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:13.336
So we are going to see scale
this down to 0.025 for

110
00:08:13.336 --> 00:08:17.211
each one of the axis, okay?

111
00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:20.681
So 0.025 for all three.

112
00:08:20.681 --> 00:08:25.414
So now, it's pretty tiny in
the Scene view but if I hit F,

113
00:08:25.414 --> 00:08:30.644
it'll frame it up and
there's our tiny little sphere that will

114
00:08:30.644 --> 00:08:36.087
be the collectible in our game as
the players are rolling around.

115
00:08:36.087 --> 00:08:41.474
There's one more important thing we
need to adjust on this collectible, so

116
00:08:41.474 --> 00:08:47.283
with it's still selected in the inspector,
come down here to the sphere collider

117
00:08:47.283 --> 00:08:52.670
component and where it says is trigger,
you want to check that to be true.

118
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.212
Because we'll get into
physics in a little bit,

119
00:08:55.212 --> 00:08:57.387
but we want this to be a trigger collider.

120
00:08:57.387 --> 00:08:58.540
Yes, there's question.

121
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.430
&gt;&gt; Are meters the only
unit of measure in Unity?

122
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.372
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

123
00:09:05.372 --> 00:09:08.010
I'm not sure,
I don't know that you can change it.

124
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.960
I also don't think you would want to,
well I take that back,

125
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.841
I'm sure there's lots of scientific or
archivist applications where you

126
00:09:16.841 --> 00:09:21.113
probably wanna change that,
I don't know, I've never tried.

127
00:09:21.113 --> 00:09:21.772
Yeah.

128
00:09:21.772 --> 00:09:25.229
&gt;&gt; Is there a common naming convention for

129
00:09:25.229 --> 00:09:27.992
organizing these-
&gt;&gt; Game objects?

130
00:09:27.992 --> 00:09:29.855
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; No.

131
00:09:29.855 --> 00:09:34.041
[LAUGH] No there's not
a common naming convention.

132
00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:39.432
I would say the naming convention
comes from video games really,

133
00:09:39.432 --> 00:09:44.138
like a collectible in a game
as a collectible in Unity, so

134
00:09:44.138 --> 00:09:46.899
that's what we're calling it.

135
00:09:46.899 --> 00:09:51.923
&gt;&gt; But like you put spaces and things you
don't do CamelCase that kind of thing.

136
00:09:51.923 --> 00:09:56.124
&gt;&gt; Gotcha, yeah, I generally
put spaces like main camera and

137
00:09:56.124 --> 00:09:58.210
directional light here.

138
00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.850
But there really is no convention.

139
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.940
I've seen plenty of projects with things
all lowercase, underscores, I mean.

140
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.468
&gt;&gt; Nope, it's kinda wild.

141
00:10:07.468 --> 00:10:11.030
It's really up to the developer.

142
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:15.615
&gt;&gt; Are the game objects classes?

143
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:19.329
&gt;&gt; No, so well they,

144
00:10:19.329 --> 00:10:23.305
I mean, yes and no.

145
00:10:23.305 --> 00:10:27.480
[LAUGH] It's kinda complicated.

146
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.940
So, a game object is a class in Unity.

147
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.842
So I guess yes, is the answer,
but in this context,

148
00:10:35.842 --> 00:10:38.789
that's not really how I think of them.

149
00:10:38.789 --> 00:10:43.081
I mean,
they are instantiated in the Scene, and

150
00:10:43.081 --> 00:10:46.300
they do have a class you can access.

151
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:51.604
So yeah, I don't know how to answer that,
I guess.

152
00:10:51.604 --> 00:10:55.970
[LAUGH] But yeah,
game objects are a class and

153
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:59.983
they are instantiate in the Scene, so.

154
00:10:59.983 --> 00:11:03.243
Again I think the more important thing to
pay attention to is that every game object

155
00:11:03.243 --> 00:11:04.910
has a transform.

156
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:10.220
So, let's see there any other questions?

157
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.896
No, cool.

158
00:11:11.896 --> 00:11:20.069
Okay, so the last thing we were doing is
we made sure that this collectible and

159
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:25.490
its sphere collider is
set to be a trigger.

160
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:29.271
So, we'll talk more about
physics later on but

161
00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:34.091
we're setting this to be a trigger
collider rather than just

162
00:11:34.091 --> 00:11:38.816
a normal collider because we
don't want the collectible to

163
00:11:38.816 --> 00:11:43.370
actually bump into things and
intersect other objects.

164
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:49.608
We want the players to be able to roll
right through and when it intersects,

165
00:11:49.608 --> 00:11:55.860
actually just collect that and
execute some code that we'll write later.

166
00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:02.060
So it's not a physical thing
that's being knocked around.

167
00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.067
So, if that were unchecked, it would be,
and in the case of the player,

168
00:12:06.067 --> 00:12:07.075
it is unchecked.

169
00:12:07.075 --> 00:12:09.975
We want the player to actually
bump into the opponent,

170
00:12:09.975 --> 00:12:13.100
bump into the game board,
that kinda thing.

171
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.590
So, the collectible is a trigger.

172
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.620
Very important to check
that little checkbox or

173
00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.203
it's gonna be very confusing later on.

174
00:12:22.203 --> 00:12:28.783
[LAUGH] Okay, there's a few other
things in the Scene like I mentioned.

175
00:12:28.783 --> 00:12:33.825
We've got the main camera, we've got
the directional light, those I've already

176
00:12:33.825 --> 00:12:38.452
set to the positions and values that they
should be in in the startup project.

177
00:12:38.452 --> 00:12:43.222
But the cool thing about this is that now,
if you go to the game view,

178
00:12:43.222 --> 00:12:47.159
you'll actually see something,
the camera is set up so

179
00:12:47.159 --> 00:12:52.840
that it is framing this board that we
placed in a very specific position.

180
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.992
You can see the little collectible there,

181
00:12:54.992 --> 00:12:57.817
you can see the lighting being
cast onto these objects.
