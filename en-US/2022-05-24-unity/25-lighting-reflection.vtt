00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.645
So let's go back and talk a little
bit about lighting very briefly,

2
00:00:05.645 --> 00:00:10.480
the lighting is already set up
in our scene the way we want it.

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.320
But I just wanted to touch
on this really quick.

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.289
Lights are a little bit more intuitive
than materials, just like in the real

5
00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.770
world lights in Unity contribute
to how surfaces are rendered.

6
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.258
So the shaders on each
material are able to access

7
00:00:27.258 --> 00:00:32.074
lighting data and
make parts of a surface brighter or

8
00:00:32.074 --> 00:00:38.040
darker depending on the angle
of the light to that pixel.

9
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.750
And it also takes into account
the parameters of each light source.

10
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.208
So each light can have a shape,
It has a position,

11
00:00:47.208 --> 00:00:53.180
there's the intensity of the light,
the color and so forth.

12
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.057
So if we just switch over to unity,
there's nothing we actually need to do

13
00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:03.264
here, but if we look at this directional
light and look at it in the scene view,

14
00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:09.796
You can see that I've
got this light that's

15
00:01:09.796 --> 00:01:14.620
just Just kind of pointing in a direction.

16
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.084
In this case, a directional light is
just kind of a uniform light that

17
00:01:20.084 --> 00:01:26.500
gets applied to the same, It gets applied
the same way to every part of the scene.

18
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.585
So directional lights are really good for
things like the sun.

19
00:01:30.585 --> 00:01:35.670
Light sources that are very large and
very far away can

20
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.870
be represented as a more
simplistic directional light

21
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.729
rather than using something
like say a spotlight or

22
00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.430
another type of light that has
kind of more directionality to it.

23
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.342
There's also point lights,

24
00:01:54.342 --> 00:01:58.650
which are just a sphere of light
that emit in all directions.

25
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.560
So you can have some fun kind of
playing around with the lighting here.

26
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.115
One thing I will do I'll just
put the scene view side by side

27
00:02:06.115 --> 00:02:10.310
with the game view here, and
I'll use the rotate tool.

28
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.136
You can rotate the light and

29
00:02:12.136 --> 00:02:15.800
you can see how that changes
the lighting in the scene.

30
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.380
So again, this is a little bit
more intuitive the materials and

31
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.009
you can actually see
the shadows of the player and

32
00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:27.030
the opponent kind of moving
across the game board there.

33
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.970
So I'll hit command Z to undo that.

34
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.900
I'll stack my game view and
scene view again.

35
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.450
And let's get back to the slides.

36
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.060
So there's something else that we
need to do with our lighting here.

37
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.853
We want to create some
reflections on the material and

38
00:02:46.853 --> 00:02:52.669
right now that isn't really present, we
are kind of just reflecting the sky box,

39
00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:57.880
but there's more localized reflections,
that we could benefit from.

40
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.624
So in computer graphics,
reflections are actually pretty costly,

41
00:03:02.624 --> 00:03:06.520
because you have to kind
of render the scene twice.

42
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.564
And then apply it to the thing
that you want to be reflected.

43
00:03:12.564 --> 00:03:16.775
And then it gets even more complicated
if you want say a reflection within

44
00:03:16.775 --> 00:03:18.510
a reflection, and so forth.

45
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.664
That's why offline rendering and
ray tracing gets these things looking so

46
00:03:23.664 --> 00:03:27.426
nice, whereas in real time
environments like games,

47
00:03:27.426 --> 00:03:29.986
we have to rely on pre computed data.

48
00:03:29.986 --> 00:03:34.332
We can't calculate these reflections
every frame I mean we can

49
00:03:34.332 --> 00:03:37.202
hardware is getting faster and faster but

50
00:03:37.202 --> 00:03:41.884
generally reflections are sampled
beforehand and they are baked.

51
00:03:41.884 --> 00:03:45.731
So we wanna use what's called
a reflection probe, and

52
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:50.920
that captures a spherical view of its
surroundings, and then any shaders

53
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.880
in its area of influence can use the image
data to generate convincing reflections.

54
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.060
So this is pretty cool.

55
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.920
I got a little bit of scene set up here.

56
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.610
So we're going to add a reflection probe.

57
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.794
And we're going to position
it just a little bit

58
00:04:09.794 --> 00:04:12.770
above the game board at a y height of 1.5.

59
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.523
And we're going to set a few
other settings there mostly for

60
00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:19.310
performance reasons and quality reasons.

61
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.900
So let's get back to Unity and

62
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.352
in the hierarchy here we're going to

63
00:04:27.352 --> 00:04:32.530
create a light called a reflection probe.

64
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.180
It's not really a light but
it's under the light menu.

65
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.794
And we can leave the default name for

66
00:04:39.794 --> 00:04:43.614
that, we can just leave
it as reflection probe,

67
00:04:43.614 --> 00:04:48.572
and we're going to set that to
a position of 0, 1.5 and 0.

68
00:04:51.181 --> 00:04:53.980
And then got the preview here.

69
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.078
I don't need that just yet, but for

70
00:04:57.078 --> 00:05:01.960
the settings we want box projection,
excuse me.

71
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.030
We want box projection to be true.

72
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.740
And then we want to set
the resolution of a reflection

73
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.900
a little bit higher,
we'll set that to 512.

74
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.428
And then for the shadow distance because
this is a baked reflection probe,

75
00:05:18.428 --> 00:05:21.150
it's not being rendered
in real time every frame.

76
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.740
We can set the shadow
distance to be really far.

77
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.346
I'll just set it to a value of 1000.

78
00:05:27.346 --> 00:05:30.793
And now,
I'll switch over to the game view so

79
00:05:30.793 --> 00:05:35.120
we can kind of see how
this changes if at all.

80
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.870
Now we'll hit the bake button
on the reflection probe.

81
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:47.184
So that should take just a second and
it didn't really change a whole lot and

82
00:05:47.184 --> 00:05:52.230
the immediate view but
if I go ahead and start the game,

83
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.820
and allow these more
metallic objects to drop in.

84
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.464
You'll see that they do look
a little bit different,

85
00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:03.790
they're using the influence
of the reflection probe.

86
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:09.190
I do wonder if I actually turn that on and
off, if it will change much.

87
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.137
Not really.
But you can see some of the reflections

88
00:06:14.137 --> 00:06:18.050
being applied to there,
so that's pretty cool.

89
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:27.444
So reflection probes they allow you
to kind of capture a lot more of the,

90
00:06:27.444 --> 00:06:34.440
I guess, realistic qualities that so
many games are trying to chase.

91
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.838
You know what, there is one thing I forgot
I expected that to make a little bit of

92
00:06:38.838 --> 00:06:40.600
a bigger impact.

93
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.560
We need to include some of these
objects in the reflection.

94
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.092
So in order to do that,

95
00:06:47.092 --> 00:06:52.261
we need to tell the reflection probe
what objects aren't going to move, and

96
00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:58.330
what objects are not dynamic, so that
it can include them in the reflections.

97
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.110
So I didn't do that.

98
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.570
There is the game board here.

99
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.280
And then there's the ground here.

100
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.190
So I just held down Shift
to select both of those.

101
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.730
And we need to set those
game objects to be static.

102
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.430
So in the inspector in the upper right,
there's this static checkbox here.

103
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.570
We're just going to check that.

104
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.795
And now if we go back to
our reflection probe,

105
00:07:23.795 --> 00:07:28.692
kind of open the game view here and
hit bake to bake those

106
00:07:28.692 --> 00:07:33.810
static objects,
that should make a bigger difference.

107
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.110
Play, and there we go.

108
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.858
Now we can see the game board and

109
00:07:40.858 --> 00:07:45.630
the ground actually reflected
in that sphere there.

110
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:50.640
So if I turn that on and off, that's the
bigger difference that I was looking for.

111
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:56.226
You can see how with it on, you can see
the reflection of the world around it,

112
00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:58.944
looks a little bit more convincing.

113
00:08:01.723 --> 00:08:04.886
And again,
that's not perfectly accurate, but

114
00:08:04.886 --> 00:08:09.942
it's enough to kind of sell the visual
in a very computationally friendly way.
