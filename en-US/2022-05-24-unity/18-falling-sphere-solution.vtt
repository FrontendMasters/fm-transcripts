00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.300
Well, hopefully again,
you didn't find this one too difficult.

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.070
It's a little more
challenging than previously.

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.658
And we have one more that is
slightly more challenging, but

4
00:00:11.658 --> 00:00:15.160
here's the solution
that will then code up.

5
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.800
So it's pretty simple.

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.990
Just like the comment says, if the y
positions, how do we get the y position?

7
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.922
We got the transform.position.y of
the game object is less than or

8
00:00:32.922 --> 00:00:37.930
equal to the game manager respond height.

9
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.617
So that's the property that we
created in game manager that stores

10
00:00:42.617 --> 00:00:44.299
that value o 0.25.

11
00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:52.908
If that's true then we call reset position
that's in the rolling movement component.

12
00:00:52.908 --> 00:00:56.626
So let's jump back into Unity and do that.

13
00:00:56.626 --> 00:01:00.580
So first, I just wanna show
you what happens without that.

14
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.150
And it's probably what you'd expect.

15
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.200
So hit space to get started.

16
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.275
And if I roll off the side,
it's just going to keep falling

17
00:01:11.275 --> 00:01:15.950
into infinity and
hit terminal velocity of gravity.

18
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.242
And you can actually see in the transform,

19
00:01:19.242 --> 00:01:23.907
there's the y value just
increasing to negative infinity,

20
00:01:23.907 --> 00:01:27.890
we don't want that we want
it to actually reset.

21
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.075
So let's open rolling movement and

22
00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:39.229
in fixed update just below add

23
00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.001
force will say if the y position of

24
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:52.024
the sphere is below the respawn height.

25
00:01:54.972 --> 00:01:59.210
Reset its position, okay?

26
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.197
And we want to say if
transform.position.y is less than or

27
00:02:05.197 --> 00:02:09.509
equal to the game manager respond height,

28
00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.139
then reset the position,
there's a reset position and

29
00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:22.860
that will reset the velocity,
the angular velocity and the position.

30
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.961
So, we'll save that switch
back over to Unity.

31
00:02:30.348 --> 00:02:34.853
And now if I hit Play, And

32
00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:39.221
we hit the Spacebar to start the game,
and I roll off the side,

33
00:02:39.221 --> 00:02:44.270
it should keep responding me in the same
spot and it will drop me back in.

34
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.820
And that will also be true for
the opponent.

35
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.063
I've never actually tried
to do this before, but

36
00:02:54.063 --> 00:02:57.240
maybe I can knock the opponent
off the side here.

37
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.330
Nope, I'm so close, okay, there we go.

38
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.142
The opponent's dropped back into yeah
