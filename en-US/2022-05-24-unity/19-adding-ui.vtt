1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.047
So we're getting something that's
closer and closer to a game here.

2
00:00:04.047 --> 00:00:09.267
Now, we need to add some UI and
that seems like a really

3
00:00:09.267 --> 00:00:14.836
prudent idea because I got
confused by there being no UI.

4
00:00:14.836 --> 00:00:19.720
So in Unity,
UI exists as 2D sprite-based graphics with

5
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.915
what's called a Canvas component
as the parent game object.

6
00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:29.650
So everything that's UI exists
underneath a Canvas, and

7
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.102
a Canvas can have one of
three different render modes.

8
00:00:34.102 --> 00:00:38.524
So in games, you've probably seen
a couple of different examples of UI.

9
00:00:38.524 --> 00:00:44.092
You've seen maybe UI that appears on
the screen, and that's in what's called

10
00:00:44.092 --> 00:00:49.928
a screen space overlay that just renders
UI elements directly on top of the screen.

11
00:00:49.928 --> 00:00:55.974
There's also a screen space camera which
is very similar but subtly different.

12
00:00:55.974 --> 00:01:00.141
It renders UI elements at
a given distance in 3D

13
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:04.630
space rather than 2D space
in front of the camera.

14
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.103
So that can be really useful for
adding depth and perspective effects.

15
00:01:09.103 --> 00:01:13.411
So if you maybe want something to
always be in front of the camera, but

16
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:17.499
maybe you want a UI element that's
kind of tilted a certain way and

17
00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:22.063
has the 3D perspective of the camera,
you can use screen space camera.

18
00:01:22.063 --> 00:01:24.961
Finally, there is world space.

19
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:28.693
So you can put Canvases
anywhere in the scene,

20
00:01:28.693 --> 00:01:35.116
they don't necessarily have to be in
screen space right in front of the camera.

21
00:01:35.116 --> 00:01:39.800
And a world space Canvas will render
UI elements as if they were 2D

22
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.537
billboards in the scene in 3D space.

23
00:01:42.537 --> 00:01:46.537
So that's useful for
things like health bars or

24
00:01:46.537 --> 00:01:52.142
speech bubbles that maybe appear
above a 3D character in a scene.

25
00:01:52.142 --> 00:01:56.564
So for this game,
we're gonna use screen space overlay but

26
00:01:56.564 --> 00:02:02.763
it is possible to achieve a wide variety
of effects using those other render modes.

27
00:02:02.763 --> 00:02:07.154
So we've got a little bit of
scene setup here for the UI.

28
00:02:07.154 --> 00:02:10.237
We want the player score
on the upper left,

29
00:02:10.237 --> 00:02:15.374
the opponent score in the upper right,
a timer at the top of the screen,

30
00:02:15.374 --> 00:02:18.473
and then some game over
text in the middle.

31
00:02:18.473 --> 00:02:24.375
So I will switch over to Unity,
these values are just here for

32
00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:27.616
your own reference later on, but

33
00:02:27.616 --> 00:02:32.504
this is all stuff that
we're going to do in Unity.

34
00:02:32.504 --> 00:02:35.864
We're gonna go to the Hierarchy and

35
00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:40.869
create a new UI Canvas And

36
00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:44.716
we can just leave it as Canvas,
that's fine.

37
00:02:44.716 --> 00:02:49.283
And then underneath of that,
we're going to create the timer first.

38
00:02:49.283 --> 00:02:54.487
So we will go to the create menu again,

39
00:02:54.487 --> 00:02:59.529
UI and we wanna choose TextMeshPro,

40
00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:03.283
and I'll call this timer.

41
00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:07.866
And in the scene view,
this will actually be quite large.

42
00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:13.068
But if we go over to the game view,
you'll see that it appears

43
00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:20.019
normal size because this Canvas by default
is going to use screen space overlay.

44
00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:27.945
So for our timer, we want this
to be at the top of the screen.

45
00:03:27.945 --> 00:03:32.618
So we could position this using these X,

46
00:03:32.618 --> 00:03:36.200
Y, and Z transform controls.

47
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.898
This is actually what's
called a Rect Transform

48
00:03:39.898 --> 00:03:43.511
which is inheriting from
the transform class.

49
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:46.836
So this game object still
technically has a transform,

50
00:03:46.836 --> 00:03:51.434
it's not breaking those rules, but
the transform controls look a little bit

51
00:03:51.434 --> 00:03:55.483
different because it's inheriting,
it's slightly different.

52
00:03:55.483 --> 00:03:58.964
So here we could type in these values, but

53
00:03:58.964 --> 00:04:04.136
we have this little handy widget here,
we can click on this and

54
00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:08.319
we can set the anchor
position of this UI element.

55
00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.582
And I want it to be at the top.

56
00:04:11.582 --> 00:04:17.406
If we hold down Option on Mac or
if you hold down Alt on Windows,

57
00:04:17.406 --> 00:04:21.220
you'll notice that this menu changes.

58
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.187
And so we want to hold down Option or
Alt, and

59
00:04:25.187 --> 00:04:31.409
what that's going to do is not only
set the anchor of this UI element,

60
00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:35.943
it's also going to actually
position it as well.

61
00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:40.470
So if we click that top center one,

62
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.571
then it's going to place
it in the top center.

63
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:49.610
And that's not exactly where I wanted it,

64
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.166
I wanted it a little bit
further away from the top.

65
00:04:53.166 --> 00:05:00.261
So instead of -25 for the y position,
I'm going to say -50.

66
00:05:00.261 --> 00:05:05.349
The width of 200 is fine, but
I want the height to be 100,

67
00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:09.101
so we have a little bit more space for
the text.

68
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:12.169
Now down here on
the TextMeshPro component,

69
00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.813
there's a couple of things
we need to change as well.

70
00:05:15.813 --> 00:05:20.935
There's a font asset that I wanna change,
so let's switch that out.

71
00:05:20.935 --> 00:05:27.407
And I have a specific font in
here already, it's called Oswald,

72
00:05:27.407 --> 00:05:33.306
I'll select that, and
that's going to be our timer text.

73
00:05:35.227 --> 00:05:41.322
And then I'm going to check
Auto Size to be true,

74
00:05:41.322 --> 00:05:48.020
and then this text I want centered for
its alignment.

75
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.704
Now this text is going to
be a timer ultimately, so

76
00:05:52.704 --> 00:05:57.054
I'm going to just give
it something that looks

77
00:05:57.054 --> 00:06:00.857
a little bit more like a timer like that.

78
00:06:00.857 --> 00:06:03.396
And that will be its default text.

79
00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:08.580
And that's really just for our own
purposes, so that when the game starts or

80
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:14.337
when we're working in Unity rather we kind
of know that that's the timer visually.

81
00:06:14.337 --> 00:06:16.758
So I'm going to duplicate that.

82
00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:24.697
Because this has a lot
of the properties that

83
00:06:24.697 --> 00:06:29.470
we're gonna want for the player score.

84
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.093
But I'll change the name of
this to Player Score, and

85
00:06:32.093 --> 00:06:35.724
then again, I'm going to click this
little gizmo in the Rect Transform.

86
00:06:35.724 --> 00:06:40.538
I'm gonna hold down
the Option key on Mac or

87
00:06:40.538 --> 00:06:45.754
Alt on Windows, and
then we're going to click

88
00:06:45.754 --> 00:06:50.850
this upper left corner for
the player score.

89
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.809
I try not to change that to player score,
I think I need to type that and

90
00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:55.918
hit Enter, okay?

91
00:06:55.918 --> 00:07:01.278
So that's going to be the player score,
of course, we want that to

92
00:07:01.278 --> 00:07:07.331
be 0 to start out with, and then we
wanna change this to a different color.

93
00:07:07.331 --> 00:07:12.387
Now we haven't assigned materials yet
and the player is going to

94
00:07:12.387 --> 00:07:17.265
be a gold material, so
we wanna change this to a yellow color.

95
00:07:17.265 --> 00:07:22.023
You can choose whatever color you want, it
doesn't really affect anything, but I have

96
00:07:22.023 --> 00:07:26.472
a specific hexadecimal value I've picked
out if you wanna follow along exactly.

97
00:07:26.472 --> 00:07:29.742
That is FFCE00, so

98
00:07:29.742 --> 00:07:35.015
that'll be this nice gold color.

99
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:43.014
And I want this to be a little
bit more toward the left.

100
00:07:43.014 --> 00:07:47.441
Let me see how far off-screen I can get.

101
00:07:47.441 --> 00:07:52.531
That's too far,
maybe if I set this to a value of 50,

102
00:07:52.531 --> 00:07:57.859
something like that,
I think that should work for the x.

103
00:07:57.859 --> 00:08:01.738
And then we need the opponent score.

104
00:08:01.738 --> 00:08:06.626
So this is gonna be the same thing,
I'm gonna duplicate

105
00:08:06.626 --> 00:08:11.418
player score,
we'll rename this to Opponent Score.

106
00:08:11.418 --> 00:08:16.949
And then we want this on
the opposite side of the screen,

107
00:08:16.949 --> 00:08:24.019
so I'll click this gizmo,
hold down Option, and hit the upper right.

108
00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:29.354
And because this text is over in the upper
right, well, actually we can leave

109
00:08:29.354 --> 00:08:34.297
these centered, so never mind,
we'll leave both of those centered.

110
00:08:34.297 --> 00:08:40.789
But this is in the upper right,
let's say we put player score at 50,

111
00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:46.086
so we should put this at -50,
so it's evenly spaced.

112
00:08:46.086 --> 00:08:51.479
And then we wanna change the color,
so the opponent's

113
00:08:51.479 --> 00:08:57.691
color on its material is going to
be kind of this bluish color and

114
00:08:57.691 --> 00:09:02.866
the x value for
that I have picked out us 4583FF.

115
00:09:04.057 --> 00:09:08.565
And then finally,
we have the game over text.

116
00:09:08.565 --> 00:09:14.005
So I'm going to duplicate the timer
because that's closest to what

117
00:09:14.005 --> 00:09:20.025
the Game Over Text is going to be like,
and we'll call this Game Over Text.

118
00:09:20.025 --> 00:09:25.250
And then that's going to be
stretched across the entire screen.

119
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:31.487
So when we're placing this and
want to stretch this in both directions,

120
00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:36.806
the horizontal and vertical,
again I'm holding down Option

121
00:09:36.806 --> 00:09:41.940
to get this positioning, and
I'll put that in the center.

122
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:47.470
And by default, this text should

123
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:52.013
say Collect more cubes than

124
00:09:52.013 --> 00:09:57.159
your opponent!Press SPACE.

125
00:10:03.323 --> 00:10:06.445
To start.
Now these fonts are kind of huge,

126
00:10:06.445 --> 00:10:12.385
I set this to auto size, but
the auto sizing also has a max value.

127
00:10:12.385 --> 00:10:15.601
So I'm going to reduce that max value,

128
00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:19.897
right now it looks like
it's set to 72 by default.

129
00:10:19.897 --> 00:10:20.701
Let's just drop that down.

130
00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:27.889
And actually, I do want a line break
there, I want this to be on the next line.

131
00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:34.224
So let's maybe drop that down to
something like 32 for the game over text.

132
00:10:34.224 --> 00:10:40.002
And then for timer player score and
opponent score, I'm actually

133
00:10:40.002 --> 00:10:46.618
going to multi select these because
they all have a TextMeshPro component.

134
00:10:46.618 --> 00:10:51.699
I can modify the values of these that are
the same across all three game objects.

135
00:10:51.699 --> 00:10:55.172
So let's maybe set this
to something like 50 for

136
00:10:55.172 --> 00:10:59.730
the max auto size option, and
that will resize all three of them.
