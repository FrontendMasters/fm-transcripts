[MUSIC]

2
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.678
&gt;&gt; John Kuperman: Accessibility like
Marcus saying is like really interesting

3
00:00:41.678 --> 00:00:44.426
where I think it's in the back of
everybody's head whether you're

4
00:00:44.426 --> 00:00:46.225
a developer, designer, product person.

5
00:00:46.225 --> 00:00:50.364
And often when I talk to you about
accessibility I get that like guilty I'd

6
00:00:50.364 --> 00:00:52.315
look, were it's like, yeah.

7
00:00:52.315 --> 00:00:56.810
Like we don't do that, we don't enough
of that or whatever, so I think.

8
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.495
Like the real goals of this workshop are I
think accessibility is a moving target.

9
00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:07.231
So to try to help identify it and
simplify it a little bit and

10
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:11.691
then really simplify
the technical aspect behind it.

11
00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:15.332
Because unlike some of these other
classes, other workshops that are pretty

12
00:01:15.332 --> 00:01:18.313
technically challenging,
like computer science concepts.

13
00:01:18.313 --> 00:01:20.117
Or electron react things like that,

14
00:01:20.117 --> 00:01:23.091
accessibility is a lot easier
from a technical standpoint.

15
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:25.938
I think just the education is lacking.

16
00:01:25.938 --> 00:01:29.137
So this doc is called The Web is for
Everyone and

17
00:01:29.137 --> 00:01:34.180
that's kinda perspective that I'd
really like to be going from.

18
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.549
It's not as moving or

19
00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.121
this vague concept of accessibility
as much as it is making your sites.

20
00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:44.729
And your apps able to be used by
potential customers or potential users.

21
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.190
For those that missed it,
my name's Jon Kuperman.

22
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.170
I'm @jkup on all the things like
Twitter and GitHub and all that stuff.

23
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.520
And I really enjoy talking
about these things.

24
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.970
So if you wanna mention me
on any of those platforms,

25
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.213
I'm always happy to check out
an accessibility, commit on GitHub.

26
00:02:01.213 --> 00:02:05.040
Or just talk about it on Twitter or
anything like that.

27
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.499
For the last couple of years
I was working at Twitter,

28
00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:09.478
working on web stuff on the home timeline.

29
00:02:09.478 --> 00:02:13.470
And now met a small start
up called Brave browser.

30
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.250
We're trying to make,
hey one fan I love it.

31
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.630
Try to make secure and fast browser.

32
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.480
So yeah, so today we're gonna be
covering quite a bit of things.

33
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.950
We're gonna be talking about disabilities
and the types of disabilities.

34
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.090
And then the assistive technology
that people with disabilities can

35
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.560
use to browse the web.

36
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.260
And then we're gonna get into some
specifics and kinda highlighting the most

37
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.010
common, your biggest wins,
low hanging fruit, that kinda stuff.

38
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.750
So we're gonna talk about keyboard
navigation, focus control.

39
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.613
We're gonna talk a lot about
screen readers, semantic HTML.

40
00:02:47.613 --> 00:02:50.377
Then we're gonna get
into the WAI ARIA spec so

41
00:02:50.377 --> 00:02:54.530
really working on some
specifically accessibility stuff.

42
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.480
And then we'll end with some,
kind of higher level stuff about color and

43
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.992
design, and how those play a role as well.

44
00:03:01.992 --> 00:03:05.200
So again I like saying accessibility
is kind of a moving target.

45
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.543
I think one of the problems
is that the word itself kind

46
00:03:08.543 --> 00:03:12.871
of lends itself to a lot of different
subfields in computer science.

47
00:03:12.871 --> 00:03:16.073
So I kind of wanted to dispel
a little bit of that and

48
00:03:16.073 --> 00:03:20.290
really hone in on what
we're gonna be focusing on.

49
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.130
So webperformance is a really similar
field when you're talking about

50
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.710
potential users and you're talking
about making your website accessible.

51
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.810
There are really important things like
taking into account people in developing

52
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.347
nations, on slow connections,
on old devices.

53
00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:37.880
Making sure that your website or
app works great for them.

54
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.810
But that's not what web accessibility
is about, just a similar field.

55
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.950
And then also internationalization.

56
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.035
Again with this like making your
website usable for everyone,

57
00:03:47.035 --> 00:03:49.372
making sure that your
strings are translated.

58
00:03:49.372 --> 00:03:52.639
And can be read by people
speaking a variety of languages,

59
00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.580
also really important But
not what today's gonna be about.

60
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.350
And then lastly,
just kinda general design,

61
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.810
content hierarchy and UIUX stuff,
workflow, all that stuff.

62
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.440
Again it's really closely related,
cuz we're really coming from this

63
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.940
spot of empathy and of understanding our
users and their needs things like that.

64
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.210
But really what we're gonna be focusing
on is people with disabilities.

65
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.339
Web accessibility is that helping
people with disabilities use the web.

66
00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:23.915
And I think that depending on who you
ask you can get some slightly different

67
00:04:23.915 --> 00:04:27.568
definitions, like does web accessibility
encompass those other things.

68
00:04:27.568 --> 00:04:32.220
But for today's class we're really
going to focus in on disabilities and

69
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.410
helping people with them use the web.

70
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.428
So I really liked this
from part of the way.

71
00:04:37.428 --> 00:04:43.950
So it's like making it so that people with
disabilities can use the Web is great.

72
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.430
But I really liked these words.

73
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.800
I don't know, it's a little hard
to see the ones I've emboldened.

74
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.300
But people with disabilities should be
able to perceive, understand, navigate,

75
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.270
and interact with the Web, I love that.

76
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.100
But then I really like the one at the
bottom which is also that they should be

77
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.040
able to contribute to the Web.

78
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.730
So it's kind of like this beautiful thing
of people that work on the web that,

79
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.430
there's a really low barrier to entry.

80
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.500
You can really easily kinda
carve out your own space.

81
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.810
It's like a lot of freedom and
a lot of power there.

82
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.134
So I like the idea of not only
making a website usable for

83
00:05:13.134 --> 00:05:14.876
people with disabilities.

84
00:05:14.876 --> 00:05:18.058
But making it great and
making it welcoming enough so

85
00:05:18.058 --> 00:05:20.240
that they can contribute equally.

86
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.154
So if you had a site like Wikipedia, it's
not necessarily good enough that a user

87
00:05:25.154 --> 00:05:28.129
with visual problems be
able to read Wikipedia.

88
00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.117
They really should be able to join
the conversation and contribute,

89
00:05:31.117 --> 00:05:31.950
things like that.

90
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.980
I think that applies across the board.

91
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.950
So I wanna talk about numbers.

92
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.770
It's regarding disability but kinda before
I do that I was I was watching this talk

93
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.165
by this guy, Rob Dodson and
he's an accessibility lead at Google.

94
00:05:46.165 --> 00:05:49.158
He's giving an accessibility talk which
was really good, but he kind of started it

95
00:05:49.158 --> 00:05:51.568
with this anecdote which I thought
was really, really powerful.

96
00:05:51.568 --> 00:05:56.600
He's talking about doing his taxes
cuz it had just been tax season.

97
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.260
And he was talking about how you know,
you know what you have to do, right?

98
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.660
You have to like,
give them your income and

99
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.830
then you get either an amount of money or
a bill back.

100
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.520
That's like, that's the contract
that's happening here, right?

101
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.863
But instead of just being able to like,
hit your ass on a button or whatever,

102
00:06:10.863 --> 00:06:12.916
you get this form,
it's a really confusing.

103
00:06:12.916 --> 00:06:15.564
And there's no real clear
order to how it goes.

104
00:06:15.564 --> 00:06:17.594
Since all these addendums and
all the, you know,

105
00:06:17.594 --> 00:06:19.690
you never really sure what's going on.

106
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.920
And so you kinda ask the entire

107
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.420
audience to visualize that
frustration that you have.

108
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.007
You're trying to fill out a tax form and
you're not sure about a certain step.

109
00:06:30.007 --> 00:06:34.218
And there's no guide there to read and
see what's going on and you're just lost.

110
00:06:34.218 --> 00:06:35.147
And you're just lost come on,

111
00:06:35.147 --> 00:06:36.845
I just want to do this thing
like let me give you my money.

112
00:06:36.845 --> 00:06:41.679
And kinda hold onto that negative
frustration because when we neglect some

113
00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:46.600
of these things, we neglect some of
these users, that's the experience.

114
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.990
Like that's what's happening,
they're like, man I'm just.

115
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.677
You work in e-commerce and it's like,
I just wanna buy this thing for my kid.

116
00:06:53.677 --> 00:06:56.815
And yet there's a CAPTCHA that they
can't listen to and they can't see so

117
00:06:56.815 --> 00:06:57.990
they can't fill that out.

118
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.990
Yeah, something's going on like that.

119
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.100
So I think coming from the empathy side,

120
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.230
I really love that anecdote of visualizing
where you're like let me do this thing.

121
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.803
I just want to get done with it.

122
00:07:06.803 --> 00:07:11.198
And then trying really hard to make sure
that you don't cause that frustration with

123
00:07:11.198 --> 00:07:12.030
other people.

124
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.980
So I just really liked that.

125
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.640
So numbers wise, there's just a few
interesting statistics that kind of give

126
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.410
you a sense of the gravity.

127
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.390
And the how common these abilities
are in our country and in the world.

128
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.018
So with people 45 years of age or
older, one in six.

129
00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:36.220
So that's 16.5 million people have some
sort of vision impairment even while

130
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.850
wearing glasses or contact lenses.

131
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.880
So as we're thinking about making
designs and making websites for

132
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.800
users with visual impairments.

133
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.860
And just in America,
we're talking about over 15 million

134
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:52.740
people that might not be able to use
your site if things aren't up to spec.

135
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.810
7.9 million people 6 and

136
00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.080
older have difficulty seeing words and
letters in ordinary newspaper print.

137
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.928
So again, as we're designing sites,

138
00:08:01.928 --> 00:08:04.225
we gotta make sure that
our content is readable.

139
00:08:04.225 --> 00:08:09.016
Our content is legible and just kinda
giving insight into the specific issues

140
00:08:09.016 --> 00:08:12.760
people have so
that we can help work around them.

141
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.280
And then just kind of generally worldwide,

142
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.490
around one in five people
have some form of disability.

143
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:23.066
So whether that's physical, neurological,
visual, anything like that.

144
00:08:23.066 --> 00:08:28.680
We're still talking about a large,
large percentage of the population.

145
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.334
If the empathy angle doesn't get you,

146
00:08:30.334 --> 00:08:33.455
I'm hoping the grid angle gets you
with one in five potential customers.

147
00:08:33.455 --> 00:08:37.130
Potential users,
people that wanna give you their money.

148
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.010
[LAUGH] I hope the empathy angle gets you,
but.

149
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:45.402
And then a really important thing that I
always like to start off with as well is

150
00:08:45.402 --> 00:08:48.515
that the web,
by its very nature is already accessible.

151
00:08:48.515 --> 00:08:53.900
So us as developers we're kind
of the problem here, right?

152
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.159
So before you're like, I don't want to
put in extra work to make it accessible.

153
00:08:57.159 --> 00:09:00.633
I think it's good to realize that
you're the one that put in extra work.

154
00:09:00.633 --> 00:09:02.259
We're the ones that put in extra work,

155
00:09:02.259 --> 00:09:04.740
that made it inaccessible
in the first place.

156
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.770
So it's kinda my thought that
this is the first website,

157
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.050
it was on CERN's introduction
to the World Wide Web.

158
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.520
And it's just basically,

159
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.270
yeah, it's the Hypermedia Information
Retrieval Initiative, it's pretty awesome.

160
00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:22.600
But anyway, so this is one of the very
first websites, it's still online today.

161
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:27.880
And it is, it was built in 1991 and
it's fully accessible.

162
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.510
If you put on the a screen reader,

163
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.520
you get access to all of
the information all the links.

164
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.360
It's also fully responsive,

165
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.430
it's fully it can be used on any device,
all of those things.

166
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:44.315
And so I just kinda wanted to like go in
with the perspective of like why we should

167
00:09:44.315 --> 00:09:46.103
care about accessibility.

168
00:09:46.103 --> 00:09:49.016
And one of the big reasons is it's like,
it's our stuff.

169
00:09:49.016 --> 00:09:51.820
It's our JavaScript library,
it's our cool CSS transitions.

170
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:56.409
Or our desire to get things to look good
visually, where we sacrifice content

171
00:09:56.409 --> 00:10:01.590
hierarchy things like that, that kind of
bump it off track in the first place.

172
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.760
I also really do think it's
a huge human rights issue.

173
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.620
Just the idea that somebody would not be
able to use a cider application that I

174
00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:13.360
built really bums me out because
I think that's a really big deal.

175
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.640
And increasingly every year it's becoming
more and more of a legal issue as well.

176
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.790
The legal areas around accessibility
are still pretty gray.

177
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:26.320
Like there isn't a set-in-stone definition
of what an accessible website is?

178
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.050
But there are legal presidente for
inaccessible websites.

179
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.630
For websites people can't use and

180
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.820
there have been law suits
that have been succesful.

181
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.590
So again if I can't get you with one
angle, then go with the other one.

182
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.950
Then the big one too,
like reaching a bigger audience.

183
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:44.410
We are talking about a not
insignificant amount of people.

184
00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.520
That are consumers, that are you
know what I mean, that are users,

185
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.440
that are social, that are,
that we might be shutting out.

186
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.085
So with a lot of this stuff,
like you know,

187
00:10:55.085 --> 00:10:59.845
I'm not such how many people are familiar
with like the specs at the W3C.

188
00:10:59.845 --> 00:11:03.760
Like whether it's the accessibility spec,
or HTML spec, or CSF.

189
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.160
They're really worthy.

190
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.490
Like their huge books.

191
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:10.270
That people spend like, years and years
and years arguing over the Burbage and

192
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:11.820
just keeps longer and longer.

193
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.680
And so, I don't really wanna go through
the spec, cause there's so so much there.

194
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.790
But there's this organization.

195
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.820
zation called WebAIM, WebAIM.org.

196
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.450
And they do a lot of really great stuff,

197
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.060
provide a lot of great
resources on accessibility.

198
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.050
But perhaps one of their greatest
resources they provide is this WebAIM

199
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:31.210
checklist.

200
00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:35.690
And so, what this essentially is is that
they've gone through the entirety of

201
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:40.070
the spec and they've kind of pulled out
the really important action items for

202
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.950
us as developers or designers.

203
00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:46.590
And I think it's really conquerable to
go through the webAIM checklist and,

204
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.350
you talked about the different
things that could go wrong and just,

205
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:54.540
talk about what the site needs to
have to be passing this checklist.

206
00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.270
So, they break it into
this four categories, so,

207
00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:02.300
all website should be perceivable,
operable, understandable, and

208
00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:07.300
robust and I think the robustness
kind of leans towards that You know,

209
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:12.520
that contribution angle, where it's like,
what we kinda don't want is this really

210
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.450
incredible experience, and then we try to
read if they're using a screen reader and

211
00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.990
then we just provide like a simple
paragraph and a title, or

212
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.240
something like that, Like,
really The tools are there to make that

213
00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.030
really really great experience useful for
everyone.

214
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I just wanna give a comment,
Jack N in the chat

215
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:34.350
says today many developers
deliver code that lacks semantic

216
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:40.250
meanings which degrades the values
semantics provide to assistive technology.

217
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.310
Think div tags instead
of meaningful HTML tags.

218
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.710
&gt;&gt; John Kuperman: Absolutely, yeah, and
we've got, I think it's in the middle.

219
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.540
We've got a whole section
on semantic HTML.

220
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.710
It's really important, and

221
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:55.000
it's definitely one of the things
we're going to highlight through this.
