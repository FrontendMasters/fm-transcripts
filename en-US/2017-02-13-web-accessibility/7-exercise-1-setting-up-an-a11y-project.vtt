00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.130
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperan: We're gonna get started
with a little bit of interactivity.

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.530
I always like to do my workshops with like
a lot of interaction cuz I just feel like

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.400
it sticks a lot better.

4
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.952
So I have this project .bag
github.com/jkup/learn-a11y.

5
00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:16.267
A couple of things, so

6
00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:20.217
yeah one that I didn't cover is
since accessibility is a really long

7
00:00:20.217 --> 00:00:25.350
word it often gets abbreviated as a11y or
ally, it can be referred to.

8
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.570
That was a small thing.

9
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.090
The other one is that, so
this project doesn't require any server or

10
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.740
anything like that.

11
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.950
So if you're not a Git user, you can just
download it as a zip from that link, and

12
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.350
it's just some HTML files.

13
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.620
So you can just open
the index.html with your browser,

14
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.490
you don't need to have any terminal,
nothing running.

15
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.440
And also throughout these activities,
there's gonna be challenges,

16
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.790
but don't worry about an elegant, or

17
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.210
like, functional programming
solution to these challenges.

18
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.600
We're really trying to focus on the user
here, so jQuery's included on every page,

19
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.960
and I would just like as you're working on
it, just do whatever it to get working.

20
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.800
And then also I always to encourage
people to pair up and work together or

21
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.590
do chit chat about things.

22
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.876
If you go to the site, learn ally,
download the zip or git clone it,

23
00:01:12.876 --> 00:01:16.489
you'll see a main index .HTML and
you can open that up and

24
00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:20.421
it's got a page that looks like my slides,
which is awesome.

25
00:01:20.421 --> 00:01:24.575
Anyway, and it's got an exercise on
the very first one, keyboard navigation.

26
00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:27.800
And so these are the two things
that we're gonna work on is that,

27
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.830
we've got a form at the bottom which
can't be submitted with a keyboard.

28
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.750
So we're gonna try to
look into why that is.

29
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.731
And also there's no skip links so
we're gonna try to implement that skip

30
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.408
link concept that we talked about earlier.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Another

31
00:01:41.408 --> 00:01:42.206
question.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperan: Yeah.

32
00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:43.262
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Ben is asking,

33
00:01:43.262 --> 00:01:46.680
regarding focus event
listeners in JavaScript,

34
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.538
any opinions on which interactioned events
should trigger form input validation and

35
00:01:52.538 --> 00:01:54.070
user feedback.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperan: Yeah.

36
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.135
That's really good.

37
00:01:56.135 --> 00:01:57.717
So we have a form right?

38
00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:03.040
And we want to do some things like front
end validation or any kind of feedback.

39
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.230
There's a couple of approaches there.

40
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.280
I think that one thing that you could do,
it's interesting.

41
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.130
So as far as feedback, I think it depends
on what order you want it to come in.

42
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.220
So if you have feedback
that should be given before

43
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.620
the user starts filling it out, like if it
says name, but you really need first and

44
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.090
last name, or something like that.

45
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.060
I think doing an on focus would be good.

46
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.100
That input element when it's focused.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperan: Say something.

47
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.870
As far as validation goes,
yeah, it's a little bit tricky.

48
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.805
I mean you could do some form
of validation on key up or

49
00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:43.565
something like that.

50
00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:45.115
You could even put it in a set time out,
maybe.

51
00:02:45.115 --> 00:02:49.065
So as they're typing, you're validating or
as they stop typing, you're validating.

52
00:02:49.065 --> 00:02:52.802
I think a common approach that I see
is like a set time out that runs and

53
00:02:52.802 --> 00:02:56.592
is checking for when the user stops
typing and does some validation.

54
00:02:56.592 --> 00:02:59.632
You could also do an on leave event,
so when they leave that one,

55
00:02:59.632 --> 00:03:01.002
give them some validation.

56
00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:04.386
I think the thing I'd worry about with
leaving is that it might be a little

57
00:03:04.386 --> 00:03:07.006
bit annoying, so you type in your name and
then you go to the next one and

58
00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:09.646
it's like hey go back,
it's telling you to go back up, so

59
00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:13.326
maybe the time out would be nice for that.

60
00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:14.866
I think it really depends on the use case.

61
00:03:14.866 --> 00:03:19.176
Is it a good piece of information for
them to know before they go in?

62
00:03:19.176 --> 00:03:22.146
Another thing which we're gonna
talk about in depth is some

63
00:03:22.146 --> 00:03:25.366
of the cool stuff you can do with aria
labels which we'll get into later.

64
00:03:25.366 --> 00:03:29.470
But that might be a really good
place to put a good idea of

65
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.730
what's required of that form field, and
what the validation is going to be.

66
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.960
And a label that would get
read by screen readers.

67
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.540
So yeah.
We'll cover a little bit of that, but

68
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.170
I think, yeah.

69
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.840
I guess if it's,
if it's needed before you fill out ID,

70
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.380
to put it into a label or
in an unfocused event.

71
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.934
And then I would probably just
have a listener going for

72
00:03:47.934 --> 00:03:50.278
when they stop typing and
do validation that way.
