WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: In regards to
accessible colors, some of

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.480
the things we run into sometimes is where
the color is actually more visible on

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.540
white than it is on a darker background,
but it passes on a darker background.

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.470
An example of it,

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:22.703
if you go to accessible-colors.com,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And

6
00:00:22.703 --> 00:00:28.862
if you just did a text color of 009900,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And

7
00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:33.460
then background color of white,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: You could see it fails,

8
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.289
but obviously, the green is a little
more legible over the white than

9
00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:38.320
black.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah.

10
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.302
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Do you, I mean,

11
00:00:39.302 --> 00:00:40.020
have you-
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: No,

12
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.900
that's a really good point.

13
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.810
So I mean yeah, like so these are, yeah,
so when you're looking at color contrast,

14
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.180
it's specifically looking from
the perspective of being color blind or

15
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.980
having some kind of
condition with your eye.

16
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.130
But sometimes, in an attempt to pass
color contrast, you're actually making it

17
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.710
difficult to see for
people that have very good vision, right?

18
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.640
Cuz yeah, in this case, I would prefer the
green on white than the green on black,

19
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.210
even though the green on black passes.

20
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.436
I mean, I think,
as much as it kinda stinks,

21
00:01:12.436 --> 00:01:14.446
is to find one that satisfies both.

22
00:01:14.446 --> 00:01:20.100
Find something that passes, but
also is a little bit more legible.

23
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.920
Cuz yeah, that's a tricky situation.

24
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.530
I've also seen it,

25
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.190
like I've picked terrible color
schemes to put into that site earlier.

26
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.760
And it's been like sweet, that passes.

27
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.710
And I'm like what, no,
I mean, it's so ugly.

28
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.820
But those don't always go hand in hand.

29
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.080
So yeah,
I guess just trying to play around,

30
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.700
find something that
satisfies both parties.

31
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.790
Sorry, I don't have a better answer for
that one.

32
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: No,

33
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.290
I'm just curious cuz it seems
that the algorithm is based on

34
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.250
reflective light more than it
is backlit displays sometimes.

35
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.040
And so-
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah.

36
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.778
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: It kind of seems like it's

37
00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:54.051
a miss.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, I mean,

38
00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:58.341
it's another thing, yeah, that would
be interesting to do a little bit more

39
00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:00.915
research into how it's
calculating these and

40
00:02:00.915 --> 00:02:05.110
if it's actually a contrast problem.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: The green on black

41
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.670
wouldn't be so bad if it

42
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.570
wasn't surrounded by white background.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: White?

43
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.263
That's valid too, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.

44
00:02:18.445 --> 00:02:19.365
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Here?

45
00:02:19.365 --> 00:02:21.273
I don't know, trying to.

46
00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:23.906
[CROSSTALK] Yeah, no, I know.

47
00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:25.434
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: No, yeah,

48
00:02:25.434 --> 00:02:26.734
that's what I'll do, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah,

49
00:02:26.734 --> 00:02:29.632
it's really interesting.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Good point.

50
00:02:32.545 --> 00:02:33.620
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, sorry?

51
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.339
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: One thing we haven't talked

52
00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:40.981
about in much detail and
we kind of glossed over is

53
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:45.853
the distinctions between
the different single A,

54
00:02:45.853 --> 00:02:49.476
double A, triple A categories, in so

55
00:02:49.476 --> 00:02:54.232
far as they relate to legal areas and
legal risk for

56
00:02:54.232 --> 00:02:58.696
particular quality levels for
your web site.

57
00:02:58.696 --> 00:03:03.720
I noticed that a lot of our checklists
that we were going through,

58
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.510
most of our descriptions tended to
focus on just a single A level.

59
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.900
But most of these tools that we're looking
at are automatically set to be requiring

60
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.817
things up like the double A level.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah,

61
00:03:15.817 --> 00:03:18.410
no, that's a good point and
[LAUGH] unfortunately, it's

62
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.850
a little bit intentional that they've been
glossed over because they're pretty murky.

63
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.640
So yeah, the definitions of what makes A,
double A, triple A are not super murky,

64
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.560
they're pretty clear.

65
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.193
So if you go to the web aim checklist,
each category will have, if applicable,

66
00:03:34.193 --> 00:03:36.490
will have what makes it each category.

67
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.124
But when it comes to what is
our responsibility for it,

68
00:03:40.124 --> 00:03:44.469
that's where it gets a little bit
murky where there's not a ton of

69
00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.793
legal precedent on what
makes an accessible web.

70
00:03:47.793 --> 00:03:51.984
So we don't have something as simple like,
if it's an educational site,

71
00:03:51.984 --> 00:03:56.508
it must be at least, we don't really have
that as much as we have individual cases

72
00:03:56.508 --> 00:04:01.340
of users saying that this can't work and
that goes to court and whatever.

73
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.638
So I think, yeah, unfortunately,
that's missing from my slides on purpose

74
00:04:05.638 --> 00:04:08.307
cuz I don't really have
a ton of good Information

75
00:04:08.307 --> 00:04:12.325
on pretty much any of the legal
precedent stuff, you know what I mean?

76
00:04:12.325 --> 00:04:16.626
It's a little bit difficult to pin
down what you're responsible for

77
00:04:16.626 --> 00:04:21.607
as what type of organization and what
the legal risks are, you know what I mean?

78
00:04:21.607 --> 00:04:25.835
A lot of that is [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: As sort of a rule of thumb

79
00:04:25.835 --> 00:04:29.918
or a general principle from
your understanding then,

80
00:04:29.918 --> 00:04:34.621
is the general area that we should
be aiming for as good enough or

81
00:04:34.621 --> 00:04:38.171
a minimum bar of
acceptability mostly A level,

82
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:43.230
mostly double A level, making sure
that we don't have a majority of

83
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.698
things that don't even get to the A level?
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: The thing is, so

84
00:04:47.698 --> 00:04:49.648
those get really tricky.

85
00:04:49.648 --> 00:04:53.540
And I'm curious what Jack's opinion
on a lot of this stuff is too.

86
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.392
But as far as,
some of the differentiation between A and

87
00:04:58.392 --> 00:05:02.220
triple A or something like that,
seems to really be application specific.

88
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.931
Where it's just like, I'm curious, I know
you've worked more on anything to do with

89
00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:09.361
legal representation sides of it, too.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So

90
00:05:09.361 --> 00:05:12.840
what I can tell you is that
the standard is double A.

91
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.300
And what we've seen in
terms of legislation,

92
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.148
for example, in the EU in Canada,
is that they've actually adopted

93
00:05:22.148 --> 00:05:24.757
the double A standard as law.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Just taking it

94
00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:26.827
verbatim as, okay.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Basically yes, and

95
00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:31.532
the US Federal government is on the way
actually to be doing the same thing

96
00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:34.324
probably for final adoption in 2017.

97
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.034
Triple A is really considered
aspirational because even-

98
00:05:39.034 --> 00:05:40.197
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Cuz some of the stuff,

99
00:05:40.197 --> 00:05:44.791
right, is, there's certain functionality
you can't have and be triple A compliant,

100
00:05:44.791 --> 00:05:47.869
which is kind of a showstopper.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, so shooting for

101
00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:48.695
double A.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So

102
00:05:48.695 --> 00:05:53.278
what does it mean to say, I was just
gonna ask about the NUS and ADA and so

103
00:05:53.278 --> 00:05:57.969
on, but what does it mean to say it's
in law that you have to be double A?

104
00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:02.944
Does it mean like.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So Section 508 was the piece

105
00:06:02.944 --> 00:06:08.037
of legislation that began
to help define how,

106
00:06:08.037 --> 00:06:11.180
it specifically speaks to.

107
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.228
Shoot, like when the Federal government
goes out to purchase products,

108
00:06:18.228 --> 00:06:20.893
products have to meet certain standards.

109
00:06:20.893 --> 00:06:25.140
508 defines what those standards
are in terms of accessibility.

110
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.060
And what they're doing is that they're
actually going to take the WCAG

111
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.920
guidelines, and
they're gonna fold them into that law.

112
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.799
So any money that the Federal government
spends on any vendor, anything they buy

113
00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:38.180
from them needs to meet those standards.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: They need to be double A.

114
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.880
So is that the same than in Canada and
in Europe then?

115
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.283
That's what we were talking about,
there is that-

116
00:06:42.283 --> 00:06:42.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.

117
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:43.978
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Canadian government does

118
00:06:43.978 --> 00:06:45.137
with the European.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Essentially.

119
00:06:45.137 --> 00:06:46.422
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Okay.

120
00:06:46.422 --> 00:06:48.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, and again, I'm

121
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.780
speaking very broadly about that, but yes.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, so I think, I mean,

122
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.286
the big thing, like we mentioned,
like the triple A stuff,

123
00:06:54.286 --> 00:06:56.075
is that it really precludes certain apps.

124
00:06:56.075 --> 00:07:00.840
There's certain things that you just
can't have, yeah, which is a bit tricky.

125
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.871
And then where it gets really murky is if
you're not anywhere related to government

126
00:07:04.871 --> 00:07:07.531
contract, if you're a startup or
a firm or whatever.

127
00:07:07.531 --> 00:07:10.220
Where do you go from there?

128
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.384
Whereas that's where less legalese,
but more of the web aim checklist.

129
00:07:15.384 --> 00:07:19.190
I find a really great resource for
that kind of stuff, where you're not so

130
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.110
much concerned with legislation as
you are with user experience, right?

131
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.590
So you're just kind of reading over them,
like okay, these things should have alt

132
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.523
text, these things should have labels,
that kind of approach instead.

133
00:07:29.523 --> 00:07:31.920
But yeah, that's really good info.

134
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.032
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Another question from Ben,

135
00:07:35.032 --> 00:07:40.680
in the case of redundant ARIA roles and
HTML5 tags, [articlerole=article,

136
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:46.170
which browser screen readers are being
targeted with this redundancy?

137
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.846
Are there times when you should not use
ARIA roles and simply rely on HTML5?

138
00:07:49.846 --> 00:07:51.610
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Gotcha, so, yeah,

139
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.520
[LAUGH] again, a little bit
tricky with versions of things.

140
00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.880
So as far as how the element,

141
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.456
like an article element, is going to
be parsed depends on browser version.

142
00:08:05.456 --> 00:08:08.870
So example,
older versions of Internet Explorer,

143
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.110
those are just gonna fall
back to just being dibs.

144
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:16.476
So if you have a product that's
supporting older versions of IE or

145
00:08:16.476 --> 00:08:22.050
other browsers,
then having article with no

146
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.730
role would just get turned and
flattened out into a div.

147
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:28.890
Whereas the HTML roles have been
around for a lot longer, so

148
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:33.920
even having div role equals article,
it's still gonna fall back in a good way.

149
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.560
So I don't know if I talked
myself in a circle there.

150
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.610
But basically, so the HTML5 element
is gonna be good enough, but

151
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.510
if you're supporting old browsers,
you'll want the role as well,

152
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:47.075
is what I would say.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: It's never actually going to

153
00:08:47.075 --> 00:08:50.010
be detrimental to double up the ARIA.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Right, yeah, that's

154
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.410
not gonna be a problem, it's not gonna be-
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

155
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:54.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Is there something like,

156
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.398
can I use that list what browsers.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, I mean, so,

157
00:08:58.398 --> 00:09:02.581
yeah, I mean, assembly if you wanted,
you could go, I think can use a hybrid,

158
00:09:02.581 --> 00:09:04.267
but the HTML5 on MDM will have,

159
00:09:04.267 --> 00:09:07.280
like if you look up a header tag or
something like that.

160
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.110
And then those all came at the same time,
header aside.

161
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.400
So you could look at those
with your browser support.

162
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.570
If you were using something like React or
whatever,

163
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.140
where you're generating that code,
I would always, just to double up on it,

164
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.174
in that one time, and
then use it everywhere that way.

165
00:09:21.174 --> 00:09:25.360
But yeah, you can definitely check out the
browser support behind the HTML elements

166
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.750
to see if you support browsers
that don't support those.

167
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.377
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What about email?

168
00:09:32.377 --> 00:09:35.114
I know it's a little caggis,
specific to web, but

169
00:09:35.114 --> 00:09:39.800
what about translating some of these
guidelines into other digital assets?

170
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.870
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yes, that's interesting.

171
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.110
So a lot of it is gonna be the same,
right?

172
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:50.310
Cuz if you're looking at a web mail client
or something like that, although you're

173
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:55.370
not really held to the same, the structure
isn't really as important there, right?

174
00:09:55.370 --> 00:10:00.560
I mean, people are making
these entire HTML emails.

175
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.882
So I feel my first instinct on it is
that the same exact rules apply, right?

176
00:10:04.882 --> 00:10:09.556
That if you're gonna be sending just
a text email, there's not a lot to do.

177
00:10:09.556 --> 00:10:10.920
If you're gonna be structuring and

178
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:15.495
sending an HTML email, then the same web
accessibility rules will just apply there.

179
00:10:15.495 --> 00:10:19.115
Because I think even if you had a non
web mail client, it's still gonna

180
00:10:19.115 --> 00:10:22.965
have somewhat of a web rendering engine
for handling that kind of stuff.

181
00:10:22.965 --> 00:10:25.555
So, yeah, I think the same rules
would apply for making those.
