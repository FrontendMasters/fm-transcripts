WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So Ben asking, I assume
if I toy with the screen reader I'll only

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.790
get a mediocre understanding of the UX
of users with different ability levels.

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.860
Are there services like
usertesting.com that can give good,

4
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.530
qualitative views into UX, real users
with disabilities for our sites?

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.960
I'm really not sure on that one.

6
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.770
When I was at Twitter,
we were really fortunate.

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.648
We had a group of people
that we reached out to.

8
00:00:22.648 --> 00:00:28.550
But I am really not sure, as far as
real-life accessibility user testing.

9
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.870
I mean, I know it's a piece of product
that a lot of the firms offer, but

10
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.129
I'm not sure.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Like

11
00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:36.028
Deque-
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yup.

12
00:00:36.028 --> 00:00:37.308
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Or SSB BART Group do that

13
00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:40.381
kind of service as part of
their consultation services.

14
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:40.931
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Exactly,

15
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:43.360
yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And

16
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.160
they hire people with disabilities,
that sort of thing.

17
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.960
You can also work with companies
that do UX research and

18
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.640
put together-
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: And

19
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.302
see if they have, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Many of them will recruit

20
00:00:55.302 --> 00:01:00.970
people with whatever demographics
that you're looking for.

21
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.254
That includes people with disabilities.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah I would refer Ben,

22
00:01:04.254 --> 00:01:09.402
I would probably check out these two
places, SSB BART Group and then Deque.

23
00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.812
And they are probably two
of the front runners.

24
00:01:11.812 --> 00:01:14.356
If you go to an accessibility conference,

25
00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:17.049
they're the main sponsors
a lot of the time.

26
00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.439
And they do a lot of speaking too.

27
00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.130
So yeah, I would check them out and see.

28
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.434
Yeah, like I said,
I know they have contract services.

29
00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:25.910
But I'm not sure,
as far as more of a community website,

30
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.371
I'm not sure.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You didn't touch much,

31
00:01:30.371 --> 00:01:35.450
that I can recall at least,
on web accessibility on mobile.

32
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.860
Is there anything that you
might add about Narrator or

33
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.700
VoiceOver?
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah,

34
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.230
that's a really good topic.

35
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.560
I'm never sure where to go with that.

36
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.920
So mobile accessibility for
apps is really great.

37
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.150
If you have an iPhone,
Windows phone, Android phone,

38
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.800
they have accessibility features
built-in that are awesome,

39
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.310
including some really cool
gestures to do different things.

40
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.870
But as far as the mobile
Web accessibility,

41
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.740
not sure if I can think of all
that much specifically in there.

42
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.790
They'll have the same screen reader
technology and things like that.

43
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.050
One big one that I kind of
mentioned a little bit,

44
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.610
but thinking about stuff like characters
per line, your tap targets being big and

45
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.360
spaced enough, things like that,
which can help I'm not sure if I can,

46
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.000
off hand,
think of too many other specific things.

47
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.430
But yeah, I mean mobile accessibility for
native apps is its own similar field.

48
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.084
But then as far as for the mobile Web,
the ones I can just kind of think

49
00:02:35.084 --> 00:02:40.066
about are clean content structure,
and buttons being identifiable and

50
00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:43.098
clickable easily.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: That's where responsive

51
00:02:43.098 --> 00:02:45.829
design really becomes beneficial.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah,

52
00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:51.661
definitely.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: And

53
00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:54.290
yeah, depending on,
there's a lot of really cool apps there.

54
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.560
But also I've seen some cool stuff for
parsing sites by their headers.

55
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.540
So again, going back into
using appropriate headings can

56
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.060
have additional benefits.

57
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.058
But yeah,
I think a lot of the same Web best

58
00:03:05.058 --> 00:03:08.545
practices apply to mobile Web.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: There was one particular

59
00:03:08.545 --> 00:03:11.050
problem I ran across, and
it's kind of an edge case.

60
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.714
But it was that we had
an instance where we were trying

61
00:03:15.714 --> 00:03:20.378
to put a link inside the value,
that was the label for

62
00:03:20.378 --> 00:03:24.302
a check box, using VoiceOver on an iPhone.

63
00:03:24.302 --> 00:03:26.377
Only the whole thing could get focused,

64
00:03:26.377 --> 00:03:30.200
so you couldn't actually dive down
into the link inside of the label.

65
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.645
Because the check box was taking
precedence in terms of the focus.

66
00:03:33.645 --> 00:03:38.026
So just to say that there are some small
differences delivering the very same

67
00:03:38.026 --> 00:03:40.696
thing on mobile,
that you don't encounter in

68
00:03:40.696 --> 00:03:43.328
the desktop browser.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, I remember we had

69
00:03:43.328 --> 00:03:48.118
one on Twitter, kinda similar I mean, when
we started doing nested conversations.

70
00:03:48.118 --> 00:03:52.810
Where I think it was
only one of the phones,

71
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.600
the screen reader was reading
the original tweet every single time.

72
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.020
So you'd have a tweet
storm with eight tweets.

73
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.680
And it would be like foo,
foo bar, foo baz.

74
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.770
It would just keep doing it.

75
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.280
I was like, man,
what the heck is going on?

76
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.599
But it was kind of similar, where it
was overly simplified focus basically,

77
00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.931
where we really wanted focus just on the.

78
00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:13.740
Yeah, there's definitely some
unique challenges there.

79
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.530
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Another from Ben.

80
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.370
Are there any particular
experts on accessibility or

81
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.330
subtopics on accessibility that
you would recommend following for

82
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.327
more info?
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, so

83
00:04:25.327 --> 00:04:30.190
as far as Twitter people go,
I follow, yeah,

84
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.452
Rob Dodson and Marcy Sutton,
and then Jennison.

85
00:04:35.452 --> 00:04:38.222
I'll find their Twitter
handles real quick.

86
00:04:38.222 --> 00:04:43.122
So Jennison,
he's kind of the accessibility guy

87
00:04:43.122 --> 00:04:46.770
in the Bay Area, he's @Jennison.

88
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.810
So he runs a lot of the meetups,
and events, and things like that.

89
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.290
He works at LinkedIn, they do really
great work with accessibility.

90
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.390
And he's always announcing, I don't know.

91
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.370
He just runs, he's got unlimited energy.

92
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.910
He's always running cool events,
so I follow him.

93
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.990
And then as far as companies go,
yeah, I think Deque and

94
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.550
the SSB BART Group are really great.

95
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.780
And they like to tweet cool
projects when they see them come.

96
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.680
And there's,
Rob Dodson has a class on Udacity,

97
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.180
that's I believe free, on accessibility.

98
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.427
I think that one's cool.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Karl Groves,

99
00:05:21.427 --> 00:05:23.832
who's the main guy at Tenon.io.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Karl Groves is, yeah,

100
00:05:23.832 --> 00:05:24.820
yeah, yeah.

101
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.353
He's the guy that does Tenon,
he has a blog that's fantastic.

102
00:05:27.353 --> 00:05:28.830
He does a bunch of public speaking.

103
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.180
There's some really cool events.

104
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.270
I only really know the West Coast ones,
cuz that's where I live right now.

105
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.440
But I'm sure there's really
cool events over here.

106
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.860
And the community's pretty small,
so you get to kinda meet and

107
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.368
hang out with everybody.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I think there's a online

108
00:05:43.368 --> 00:05:45.792
Accessibility Summit.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah!

109
00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:52.536
So yeah, it's part of
the Global Accessibility Awareness Day.

110
00:05:52.536 --> 00:05:53.516
I think it's yearly.

111
00:05:53.516 --> 00:05:57.733
I think it's every year, I'm not sure.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Well, there is that one.

112
00:05:57.733 --> 00:06:00.421
But then there's also I think an online

113
00:06:00.421 --> 00:06:04.009
only conference called
the Accessibility Summit.

114
00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:05.409
I think, let me see.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah,

115
00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:08.890
I think that happened a month ago or
something like that.

116
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.598
So catch the next one
[LAUGH] coming around,

117
00:06:14.598 --> 00:06:16.280
yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah,

118
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.890
I guess there's something else
called the Accessibility Summit,

119
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.720
so.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Gotcha.

120
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: There's,

121
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.041
I don't know.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah,

122
00:06:21.041 --> 00:06:24.170
I mean, so if you can get to an event,
that's a really great way.

123
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.658
Most people go to most of the events,
and it's a cool place to network.

124
00:06:28.658 --> 00:06:31.654
And people are always
building really cool stuff.

125
00:06:31.654 --> 00:06:33.700
A lot of people from Google will be there.

126
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.120
And that's a great place to voice, hey,

127
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.860
I'm having this issue with
your accessibility dev tools.

128
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.400
People making accessible video players and
accessibility,

129
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.680
a lot of really cool stuff gets
talked about at those events.

130
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.340
So I like going to those,
if you ever get a chance to go to one.

131
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.383
Also the guy that, yeah,
as Jeremy's pointing out.

132
00:06:55.383 --> 00:07:00.700
So Ryan Florence, who was one of the
people that started the react-a11y thing.

133
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.295
I think it was him, it might have been
somebody else now that I think about it.

134
00:07:03.295 --> 00:07:06.799
Somebody started a slack for
accessibility, and

135
00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:09.140
it uses that cool slack in thing.

136
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.100
So you can get your, yeah,
that's right, Ryan Florence.

137
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.878
So you can go to,
let's see, a11y.herokuapp.

138
00:07:15.878 --> 00:07:19.010
Sorry, web-a11y.herokuapp.com.

139
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.112
Put in your e-mail, you get an invite,
you can join the slack.

140
00:07:21.112 --> 00:07:26.463
That's got a ton of people in it,
which is great too.

141
00:07:26.463 --> 00:07:28.454
I'm trying to think of other resources.

142
00:07:28.454 --> 00:07:31.680
I tweet about stuff,
whenever I see cool stuff that comes out.

143
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.082
But yeah, I think those are.

144
00:07:33.082 --> 00:07:34.630
That's a lot of cool follows,

145
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.440
a lot of people to follow to
get started with that stuff.
