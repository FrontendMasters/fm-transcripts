00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.892
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So, yeah,
Exercise 5 is Live Regions.

2
00:00:02.892 --> 00:00:06.453
This one's a little bit JavaScript-y, but
don't worry too much about, it doesn't

3
00:00:06.453 --> 00:00:09.890
need to be perfect, the JavaScript logic
cuz it has to do with numbers or whatever.

4
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.861
But basically,
we kinda wanna do two things here.

5
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:15.973
I'm gonna go over to my example.

6
00:00:15.973 --> 00:00:17.340
So we've got this ARIA example.

7
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.510
Okay, so what we wanna do is we have
this number 0 in the little box.

8
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.376
And we want, first of all, the buttons to
work, so like let's say as you increment

9
00:00:25.376 --> 00:00:28.981
and decrement them, they go up by one or
five, or ten, something like that.

10
00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:33.050
So from 0 it go like 10,
20, well, dictionary.

11
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.700
And then back down to ten or
something like that.

12
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.890
So first we wanna implement that working,
and

13
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.010
then what we really wanna do is then we
wanna add a ARIA live region to this, and

14
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.800
play around with your screen reader
between polite and assertive.

15
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.452
So not only is the number changing here,
but it's actually getting announced in.

16
00:00:49.452 --> 00:00:52.862
And you can play with things like labels
the new value, or just announcing

17
00:00:52.862 --> 00:00:57.380
the number, 10, 20, 30 and kinda seeing
those different experiences there.

18
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.186
So, we'll take like a ten
minute break to do these, and

19
00:01:00.186 --> 00:01:02.050
then I'll cover them all together.

20
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.020
And I think they're in the answers branch
too if you wanna move ahead on it.

21
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.540
But basically the idea of getting to
really play with the ARIA live regions,

22
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.400
and seeing how you're listening to
something, and how it comes in.
