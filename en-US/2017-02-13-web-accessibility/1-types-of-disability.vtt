00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.550
&gt;&gt; Jon: Kinda getting started,
like we said,

2
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.360
with the different types of disabilities.

3
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.300
And again, I think that this mostly helps
when, so you think about it accessibility

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.770
and your sites that you own,
or your apps that you own.

5
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.985
And then it's a little bit hard to
visualize without, but I think coming from

6
00:00:13.985 --> 00:00:17.413
this angle of the types of disabilities
and the types of assistive technologies.

7
00:00:17.413 --> 00:00:22.320
Really helps understand how people are
coming to your site, how they're using it,

8
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.370
and makes it easier to remember the things
that you should be looking out for, right?

9
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.160
I think, yeah.

10
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.560
So people have Attention-Deficit or
Hyperactivity Disorders.

11
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.831
And there's a lot of good research and
work that's been done here about things

12
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:42.312
like keeping your font size big enough,
a good amount of spacing between topics.

13
00:00:42.312 --> 00:00:45.940
Line length as far as characters go.

14
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.930
These things which, again, and
I'm hoping a constant thread that we

15
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.260
kinda can see here is that,
things that are good for

16
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.620
users with disabilities, more often
than not, are good for all users.

17
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.545
And I think that's another big win of
this, that as you go through and you make

18
00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:03.425
your site accessible for people with
disabilities, you end up getting a lot

19
00:01:03.425 --> 00:01:06.847
of positive feedback from everyone, which
is like, it's really easy to understand.

20
00:01:06.847 --> 00:01:11.250
Click around, use a keyboard,
all these different things.

21
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.595
Blindness or low vision.

22
00:01:12.595 --> 00:01:17.780
So again, when we talk about blindness,
we'll talk about screen readers.

23
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.820
When we talk about low vision,

24
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.940
we'll talk about some different
things like color contrast.

25
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.164
I have a real privilege of sharing
a stage with two different people

26
00:01:26.164 --> 00:01:31.710
that work at Google,
one with extremely low vision, one blind.

27
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.740
Doing inaccessibility conference two
years ago, and the lady with low vision,

28
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.302
she was talking about how a big pet peeve
of hers is when she goes to a website and

29
00:01:41.302 --> 00:01:44.560
the kinda contrast mode is just black and
white.

30
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.000
And she's like I'm an artist, I love
color, I love great visual designs and

31
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.200
experiences, it just needs to meet
these minimum, I just need to not be.

32
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.837
Unseeable for me, but other than that
like, really getting bummed out like when

33
00:01:58.837 --> 00:02:02.071
she clicks the button and the site
just become it's this boring at mess.

34
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:05.270
People with brain injuries,
deaf or hard of hearing,

35
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.370
this one plays big if you have a video
site from the masters offering and

36
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.377
close captioning,
it's just such a great thing.

37
00:02:12.377 --> 00:02:15.760
People with learning disabilities.

38
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.930
Again this plays in to specific
types of sites you might have.

39
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.410
But just doing a little bit of research,
and

40
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.550
a little bit of understanding on people
with learning or attention disabilities.

41
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.770
And how to make it easier for
them to take in information.

42
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.310
People with physical disabilities this can
be a lot of different things whether they

43
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.970
don't or can't use a mouse.

44
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.215
Are they keyboard only users whether
they're using a specialty device

45
00:02:38.215 --> 00:02:40.985
like a single switch,
which we'll cover in the next topic.

46
00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:45.153
And also things like if you're doing
mobile app experiences, making sure

47
00:02:45.153 --> 00:02:49.388
there's enough space in between your
click targets and things like that for

48
00:02:49.388 --> 00:02:54.040
people that don't have as much precision
to still be able to use your app.

49
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.890
And then people with speech and
language disabilities.

50
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.831
This can buy them a lot
of different ways again.

51
00:02:58.831 --> 00:03:03.745
Whether it's kind of in that
internationalization field or

52
00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:08.960
whether it's any kind of user
communication things like that.
