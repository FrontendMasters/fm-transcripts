00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.380
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So
that was the first exercise.

2
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.960
We had a couple of little
things that I messed up

3
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.270
on that I was gonna cover really quick.

4
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.750
So the first one, well the first
big one which was addressed and

5
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.560
we gonna cover this in a later section but
apparently someone ran

6
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.440
the navigation through a tool and
the color contrast isn't enough to meet.

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.440
Either double or
triple A compliance, so we're gonna,

8
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.140
we'll actually take a big look at colors,
I do apologize.

9
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.850
I picked a Bootstrap theme that
I thought would looked nice and

10
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.048
assumed it would be accessible, but
we'll go ahead and fix that later.

11
00:00:32.048 --> 00:00:40.220
Somebody had mentioned
the use of main tags.

12
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.440
Hoping people can see over here and
why they use a main tag.

13
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.970
I think that looking at it,
a main is not the correct tag to use here.

14
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.260
The basic idea is going for
a div is pretty much

15
00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.080
meaningless in HTML, and so wanting to
have something like article or section or

16
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.809
something to give more semantic
meaning to what each area represents.

17
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.270
Which can be used, but

18
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.570
different screen readers use them in nicer
ways to kind of announce what's going on.

19
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.060
But I think if I had all to do over again,

20
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.100
that a section tag would be more
appropriate for all of these.

21
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.822
And so yeah, I would go ahead I
hadn't changed those to sections,

22
00:01:19.822 --> 00:01:21.160
going forward in this.

23
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.530
I also, actually, after it was mentioned,

24
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.069
I think that main also only gets
to be used once in a document.

25
00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.612
As far as having context and those get
treated kind of as divs afterwards so

26
00:01:33.612 --> 00:01:35.970
I think it didn't do much good there.

27
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.455
But I would probably use sections,

28
00:01:37.455 --> 00:01:40.590
tThe big thing is like,
on a single paged website like this.

29
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.470
Denoting each area as something more than
just another div on the page, right?

30
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.630
Like this is something to be kind
of looked at as an article or

31
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.540
a section or something like that.

32
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.190
Also, this used to have a focus.js file,

33
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.260
so I think some people that
were kind of hopping ahead or

34
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.910
looking in the console saw
that focus js is failing.

35
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.410
We're not using that.

36
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.380
So sorry about that still being in there.

37
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.090
I think, in an attempt to make this easy,
it's just, there's no server.

38
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.236
So it's just duplicates
of [INAUDIBLE] HTML file.

39
00:02:14.236 --> 00:02:17.380
So yeah, I think that if you do a search
with your text editor, you'll see two

40
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.500
reference [INAUDIBLE] To that, which you
can just remove or you can just ignore.

41
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.940
The errors not gonna, you know,
not gonna cause a problem but there's no,

42
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.610
there's no need for a focus JS file.

43
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.850
All we're gonna cover focus
in the next exercise,

44
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.235
but if anybody saw that council error.

45
00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:33.000
That's not a big deal there.

46
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.620
I think that was everything.

47
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.180
I think I got everything
that was mentioned in chat.

48
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.530
If there's something I missed,
feel free to put it in there.

49
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.640
And then we can go ahead and
cover some of this Stuff,

50
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.380
so, this was the example that I
was talking about where I had it

51
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.670
where if you would click on something like
tabindex then, you would start tabbing.

52
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.500
It used to take you all the way back
to the top of the document but,

53
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.800
Chrome very cleverly has
made that not necessary but,

54
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.500
you can still kinda get used to things
like, you know, like starting at the top

55
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.420
of a document and then,
I've got this relatively link up here Boy.

56
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.620
Boom.

57
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.670
And then tabing through and
seeing what that is like.

58
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.810
And then tabing through a form and
shift tabing back up.

59
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.720
I think that is kind of like
the big takeaways here,

60
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.160
is that I just wanted people to
get some experience with it.

61
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.940
And then one thing you might notice with
the form is that You can fill out all of

62
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.870
these different things and you can
experiment with the arrow keys and stuff.

63
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.040
Hit remember me.

64
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.760
And then when you go to cancel or

65
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.140
submit it just kind of takes you
back up to the URL bar here.

66
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.630
And so this gets us into one of, if not
the biggest antipattern inaccessibility.

67
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.890
Which is if we pop over
here to the actual code...

68
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.000
We'll notice that these two things,

69
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.430
while they look like buttons, they
are not actually buttons, they're dibs.

70
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.600
And people do this quite often.

71
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.450
I think one of the biggest things is that
there's a lot of styles that come with

72
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.290
the button tag and people kind of
don't want to deal with that so

73
00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.500
they think An easier way would be to
take a div and then you have a nice,

74
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.830
clean slate as far as css goes.

75
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.510
The problem is, and this goes back to
Jack's comment at the beginning of that,

76
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.390
there's a ton of functionality and

77
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.430
meta information attributed to these
attributes, to these tags, I mean.

78
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.470
Different HTML elements, and so, you know,
buttons are tabable, div's are not.

79
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.345
And then buttons, you can hit space and
Enter on them, and divs you can't do that.

80
00:04:25.345 --> 00:04:30.220
So you can start kind of getting into all
these things where it's always a better

81
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.418
approach to use the right element.

82
00:04:32.418 --> 00:04:36.590
And then spend some extra time on
your CSS for it because it's so

83
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.538
easy to miss and
to give ...to give them the right class.

84
00:04:40.538 --> 00:04:42.812
And they look great and,
you know what I mean, but

85
00:04:42.812 --> 00:04:46.340
they just don't have any of that
functionality that comes with it.

86
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Would using
an anchor tag be a good thing?

87
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.279
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: It gets
you some of the way. Again,

88
00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:54.796
it's like kind of just, and we'll get
into some of the specifics, but, yeah,

89
00:04:54.796 --> 00:04:57.093
like so anchor tags have
some of that stuff, right.

90
00:04:57.093 --> 00:04:59.342
So you can tab to them,
which is really nice and

91
00:04:59.342 --> 00:05:02.310
you can hit enter on them
which is really nice as well.

92
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.639
But there are few things that they don't
like one thing is that anchors will

93
00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.663
read differently to screen
readers than buttons and

94
00:05:09.663 --> 00:05:14.079
anchors traditionally mean we are taking
you to another location, right?

95
00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:17.579
Whereas like an input type submit or
a button that's something that all

96
00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:20.217
the screen readers all know
kinda of how to work with.

97
00:05:20.217 --> 00:05:25.114
But also miss things like an anchor
has a onclick event built into it but

98
00:05:25.114 --> 00:05:30.850
it doesn't have the same onKeyDown
functionality that a button would have.

99
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.720
You know what I mean, so
you kinda get into these.

100
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.840
So it's like, and
we actually have an example where

101
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.750
we can turn a div into a fully
accessible button if you wanted to.

102
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.420
So there are always ways, like when we
get into ARIA, a lot of what ARIA is

103
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.000
is allowing you to kinda Give
functionality to different elements.

104
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.050
But yeah, I think I would always,

105
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.790
if it all possible, using the right
element is like the best place to start.

106
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.230
So yeah, so we could go ahead

107
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.440
as far as the buttons go like we could
just go ahead and turn these into buttons.

108
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.260
Okay, I don't wanna get
too lost on the code.

109
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.770
We could also turn this and
an input type submit so

110
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.550
people know that it's attached
to the form that we're in.

111
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.998
Another example of HTML giving you free.

112
00:06:11.998 --> 00:06:19.130
I can't think of the word but you know
stuff that works like that so if you have

113
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.010
it as a button tag that's not really right
because then you're gonna need an onclick.

114
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.660
Listener for
the button that submits the form right?

115
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.990
But really like an input type submit
gives you all that functionality,

116
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.140
you guys can like whatever.

117
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.950
Functionality so

118
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:38.660
like an input type submit all HTML know
that when that thing is interacted with.

119
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.400
Submit the form and
what form that they're attached to so

120
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.810
then the only difference there is it takes
a value instead of having this stuff.

121
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:54.180
So I could do something like that so we've
got this div was changed into a button and

122
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.900
this one was changed into input type
submit so if I go back over here and

123
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.940
I'm up in my form with
my visual indicators.

124
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.310
You're doing all that stuff and then I
hit remember me and now I can cancel.

125
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.090
It goes back to the top
also I can hit submit.

126
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.660
It's a little bit tough
to see cuz it's blue but

127
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.330
there is a visual indicator there going
back and forth those two buttons.

128
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.740
I'm so again like not to get
lost in the weeds of code but

129
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.650
just the kind of understand from a user's
perspective that we took this form

130
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.790
that could not be filled out before by
keyboard only or screen reader user.

131
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.720
And now have it up with minimal
HTML changes able to be filled out.

132
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.300
And yeah,
the only other thing was those skip links

133
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.960
which I had put in my slides but yeah, the
basic idea you could do something like.

134
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.530
You can stick it up at the very top here.

135
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:49.520
You can do like a, and then it goes to you
can kinda choose where you wanna to go to.

136
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:57.260
I guess main ID main, maybe main give it
a class or maybe an ID of skip link, and

137
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.380
then give it to some tasks
like skip to main navigation.

138
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:12.630
Give it a closing tag, so now when I
refresh, we'll see, actually we won't see.

139
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.020
There it is at the very top,
this link here and so

140
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.810
now all we wanna do is
just a little bit of CSS.

141
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.050
So it is the first thing like if we
refresh the page and then I hit Tab,

142
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.000
you can see the focus comes around.

143
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.090
So now we just wanna hide it
unless it's focused basically.

144
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:29.340
So we can go in our CSS and
we could do something like

145
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:35.200
grab ahold of that skip link and
position absolute at top

146
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.090
whatever I said like hide it by 50,
put it in the top left corner.

147
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.480
I don't know,
give it some padding or something,

148
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.340
we can see how this looks but, background:
red; color: white; or something like that.

149
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.720
So it's really obvious, so

150
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:56.030
now, I think my server is little caching,
hold on a second.

151
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.810
If anybody has, I don't know why
I'm running this on a server,

152
00:08:58.810 --> 00:08:59.810
I guess I could just open it up.

153
00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:00.930
But if anybody's running on a server,

154
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.050
you might wanna watch out for
[INAUDIBLE] caching.

155
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.720
So now, the skip link's hidden but
now we can see it all.

156
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.490
So, the first tab,
doesn't have it anything, So,

157
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:12.270
now the last stop we need to do is
just give it that focus selector.

158
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:16.150
So, we do skip-link:focus and

159
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:21.840
we give a top: 0; something like
that restart my silly server again.

160
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.880
I won't do anymore on the server, come on.

161
00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.520
What have I done?

162
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.410
Sorry about that.

163
00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:38.320
So go in here and we can just give it some
z index as many as we can, okay, cool.

164
00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.240
So now you have this page here and
you hit tab on it and

165
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.150
skip to main navigation, comes down and
if you ignore it, it goes back away.

166
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.360
And then, if you go ahead and hit it,

167
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.310
it brings you the welcome
to our first exercise.

168
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.900
So that's the basic idea, there.

169
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.710
Sorry the index thing was
a little bit bumpy, but again,

170
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.820
without getting caught in
the weeds of the code.

171
00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.830
Just some things that you're starting to
really communicate with users here and

172
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.210
just making things a lot easier, yeah?

173
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Dave P,
is saying the rule of thumb is for

174
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:10.340
the A anchor tag to
navigate to another page.

175
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:15.275
Or within the page, and the button element
tag is for doing something on the page.

176
00:10:15.275 --> 00:10:21.120
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, anchors, exactly,
you're moving you somewhere else.

177
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:27.030
And then again, also- cuz it
gets a little bit tricky with,

178
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.930
single page websites still make
sense to use an anchor cuz you

179
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.340
are moving the location
even though it's staying.

180
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.250
So cool.
So yeah, I think like Yeah, basically just

181
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.400
kinda wanted to get everybody
started with like tabbing around and

182
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.490
experiencing some frustrations
that might be there.

183
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.153
And then some pretty easy
solutions to them, cool.

184
00:10:48.553 --> 00:10:49.480
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: All right, so,

185
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.230
again more things that we can
kinda start checking off our list.

186
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.690
Page Functionality,

187
00:10:54.690 --> 00:11:00.005
all Page Functionality is available using
the keyboard unless it can't be done.

188
00:11:00.005 --> 00:11:03.761
So, you kind have, if you have like for
example here, it's like a free hand

189
00:11:03.761 --> 00:11:07.652
drawing section like, that's not gonna
be able to be done with the keyboard.

190
00:11:07.652 --> 00:11:11.873
But, anything as far as like
inputting on a form, clicking links,

191
00:11:11.873 --> 00:11:13.361
all that kind of stuff.

192
00:11:13.361 --> 00:11:17.473
Keyboard focus is never locked or trapped
at a particular page element We might

193
00:11:17.473 --> 00:11:20.727
cover that, we have like a whole
section on keyboard tracts.

194
00:11:20.727 --> 00:11:24.700
But basically you should always be able
to keep moving around on the page.

195
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.380
And again, kind of like this triple a all
page functionalities available using

196
00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:29.996
the keyboard.

197
00:11:29.996 --> 00:11:31.637
So I guess now might be a good time,

198
00:11:31.637 --> 00:11:35.219
there's a question right before we
started the excercise about triple A.

199
00:11:35.219 --> 00:11:38.301
So basically,
with all this accessibility stuff,

200
00:11:38.301 --> 00:11:40.900
there's three levels of compliance to it.

201
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:45.420
Which you can see on my slides, and
this is from the WebAIM.org, so

202
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.440
there's Level A, Level A, Level AAA.

203
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.130
Oftentimes, the second level of compliance
is double A, but these are two.

204
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.220
So it's basically like I
can't get the word but,

205
00:11:55.220 --> 00:12:00.170
triple A means that it has A compliance,
AA compliance and triple so, basically,

206
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.470
it's like a list of things that build.

207
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:06.240
So, like A compliance might be like,
you know, all page functionality

208
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.540
Values available is on the keyboard,
unless it can't be reproduced.

209
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:14.580
And as so, our site now is A compliant but
if we had a drawing thing, it wouldn't be

210
00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:19.000
AAA compliant because AAA compliant means
it's a harder one to achieve basically.

211
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.810
So there's these three levels, A, AA,

212
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.440
AAA each one includes all the requirements
of the platform plus the new ones.

213
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.350
And you can see all those
on the webAIM's site, so

214
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:32.750
then you can Depending on what you hit,
be our site's AA compliant.

215
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.640
It's not AAA compliant because we
have this free hand drawing tool,

216
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.700
which is important to our users, and
we can't do that with a keyboard.

217
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.360
Things like that does that make sense?

218
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.770
I think somebody had asked on chat.
