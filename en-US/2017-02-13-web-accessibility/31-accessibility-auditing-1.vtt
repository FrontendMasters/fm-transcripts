WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I think we should
do an accessibility audit of,

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.730
yeah, we could do Frontend Masters.

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.045
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: We'll warm people up.

4
00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:11.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I also did

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.650
a Chrome Dev Tools audit of
Frontend Masters last time I was here,

6
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.730
so Mark's used to the scrutiny.

7
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.432
All right, cool, so we're gonna run one
of these audits here on the home page and

8
00:00:19.432 --> 00:00:20.963
see where we're at with things.

9
00:00:22.267 --> 00:00:25.826
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I'm really starting to
get the feel like something is broken with

10
00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:28.360
this reload page and
audit function, right.

11
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: It's just the site is so
bad.

12
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.060
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: No, no,
the more I'm seeing is something is wrong.

13
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.010
Yeah, okay, cool, I'll do it right.

14
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.940
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: It just crashed.

15
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.720
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Okay cool so like so

16
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.640
here is playing into something
that we've talked about before.

17
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.190
I really wanted to lean on like what's
good for accessibility is good for

18
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.960
everybody.

19
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.430
So, one of the first things is
that we've got some duplicate ids

20
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.850
which are not allowed so
we've got playing in name and

21
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.040
auto bullet are both-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: That looks like

22
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.050
actually something with our player,
the video player.

23
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.200
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: That's
not from you I would say.

24
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah
that's the video player.

25
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.030
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I told you it's not
always within your control unfortunately.

26
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Although we
are creating a brand new player

27
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.360
you can see that next up from the dot com.

28
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: That's
the one you should audit.

29
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.058
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah alright, next.

30
00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:23.680
[INAUDIBLE] Yeah it's not
always in your control.

31
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.267
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: You didn't spell it.

32
00:01:25.267 --> 00:01:26.031
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You need a T.

33
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.500
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: All
right everybody [LAUGH]

34
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.900
So, one thing that's

35
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.040
just as I noticed like things that I
noticed a lot like anytime you have stuff

36
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.950
that you embed like if you have a bunch
of YouTube videos on your site.

37
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.560
You running to that kind of thing
a lot like duplicate IDs or

38
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.840
duplicate scripts different things
like that is pretty common.

39
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.770
All right cool go back to
edit action [INAUDIBLE]

40
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.500
This is sweet, I haven't seen this yet.

41
00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:02.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Are you logged in?

42
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.470
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: No.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I'll log into the main

43
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.073
so I can [INAUDIBLE].

44
00:02:04.073 --> 00:02:04.630
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: My god.
Some weird cookie stuff.

45
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: [LAUGH] This is beta stuff.

46
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.760
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: No, no.
You're right, you're right, you're right.

47
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.213
It's [INAUDIBLE] stuff.

48
00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:12.070
This is Might not be my password.

49
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.069
It was my password.

50
00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.401
Okay, all right.

51
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.820
Alright here we are.

52
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.710
Okay so
severe Mark severe we got work to do so

53
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.590
yeah the first one is controls in media
elements should have Some kind of label.

54
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.850
So, you got the main video here
in the center of the screen.

55
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.710
It doesn't have any label for it, so as
you're like tabbing through or something

56
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.400
like that, it should have some kind of
label, even if you visually hide it.

57
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.320
Let's see.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I'm sure there's

58
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.860
like a Video.js accessibility,
like a plugin or something?

59
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: You can use [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Add on?

60
00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:02.730
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, definitely.

61
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.250
I mean, yeah, again, it's just for

62
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.910
if you're tabbing through,
you want the screen reader to just say.

63
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.320
This is the video, maybe the video
title or something like that.

64
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.750
Okay, cool, so elements with ARIA
roles must be in the correct scope.

65
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.860
So, what is going on here?

66
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.869
First of all, great job on having so
many ARIA roles.

67
00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:30.780
I'm assuming-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah,

68
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.990
I mean we're pretty much
sticking to stock video, Jazz.

69
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.070
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah.
I'd have to look into this one.

70
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.250
But conveniently,
they always put a link to

71
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.020
an explanation in the Chrome dev tools for
why they're pegging you as something.

72
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.802
Okay so the required context role defines
the owning container where the role is

73
00:03:47.802 --> 00:03:48.315
allowed.

74
00:03:48.315 --> 00:03:53.240
Okay so bad, the listitem role must be
owned by an element with role list.

75
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.310
Okay so
you can't have listitems without a list.

76
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.890
So we've got something like that here,
menuitems without a menu.

77
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.990
Okay so all these different
controls here are great

78
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.800
because they have menuitem role,
but you can't have menu items

79
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.710
without a menu,
can't have list items without a list.

80
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.120
Doesn't seem severe, but it is [LAUGH].

81
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.707
Cool, elements of unsupported
ARIA attributes, ARIA, let's see.

82
00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:29.700
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Unsupported one.

83
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.160
I think that,
yeah has pop up is a real one.

84
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.910
I think there's something specific.

85
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.800
I'm not sure on that one either.

86
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.610
That one's a little bit tricky.

87
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.610
It's complaining that one
of those is unsupportive.

88
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.970
I think that's more.

89
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: How is that severe if
you have something that's unsupported.

90
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.680
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I don't know.

91
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: If it can't understand it,
wouldn't it just ignore it?

92
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.890
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I didn't make
the school Mark, I don't know.

93
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.650
Yeah, I think so, I think yeah,
I'm not sure why that's severe.

94
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.640
I'd have to look into that one more.

95
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.140
I'm assuming that,
it looks like what's going on.

96
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.720
Cuz I think those are all three,
they are supported attributes,

97
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.210
but I think maybe not on the element or
on the role type that it's being given.

98
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.230
It can get a little bit
finicky about that.

99
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.590
And then-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: No alt text.

100
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.350
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yep.

101
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.530
So we've got some images
that don't have alt text.

102
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What about that third one?

103
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.310
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: What about, one, two.

104
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.090
Elements with ARIA roles must
ensure required owned elements.

105
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.660
Yeah, so, this is like the opposite.

106
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.270
I'd have to look into what's going,

107
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.350
so these are complaining about
the exact opposite things.

108
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.280
This is saying
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: What if those are the items

109
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.580
that belong to that menu?

110
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.050
They're just not inside of it?

111
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.090
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I think what's going
on is that we just have a simple

112
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.940
nesting issue.

113
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.030
Because it's like, this is saying there's
a ton of role menu items that don't have

114
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.900
a parent with role menu.

115
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.480
And this is saying the exact opposite.

116
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.705
We've got two things with role menu that
don't have menu items inside of them

117
00:05:56.705 --> 00:05:59.770
[LAUGH] So, I'm assuming it's just like-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: a It's a bunch of orphans

118
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.610
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: A div nesting issue like

119
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.000
maybe you have an extra closing div or
something like that.

120
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Our lead developer Kai
on the new player he's not tuning in so

121
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.400
it's watching it live so.

122
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.140
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: All right I'm
gonna be even more polite.

123
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.380
Cool text elements without
contrast ratios so

124
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.050
it looks like a lot of
these settings ones.

125
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.550
I can pop this out.

126
00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:28.290
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Try to
find where they are.

127
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.340
Okay, so yeah so
a couple of these links here, come on,

128
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.970
I don't know why, anyway.

129
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.530
A couple of these links don't have
enough contrast ratio to them.

130
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.040
So you could either run this through,

131
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.070
like something like totally will point
out which ones are low contrast or

132
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.850
you could just pull the colors out
of it and run it through that site.

133
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.760
Cool, a couple of other little things.

134
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.680
A webpage should have human language, so
this one will have html class js which

135
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.590
will probably have lang en on the html
top too, just to be conformant.

136
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.560
Video elements should use Track
elements to provide captions.

137
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.870
So, if there's a caption in the video,
it should be inside a track tab.

138
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah,
we haven't implemented captions yet

139
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.360
in the new player, but we will.

140
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.940
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Cool.
I don't know.

141
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.440
I mean, yeah, I mean, it is what it is.

142
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.710
The severe seems a little bit severe,
to call it, for some of those.

143
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.330
I really think the biggest
fixes in here are that, and

144
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.820
I'd have to poke around a little bit more,
but it looks like something's off where

145
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.550
yeah, so this role of Menu has an,
I see what it is.

146
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.060
I think it's a nested ULs,
I think is what's going on.

147
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.340
But basically, so we've got all these Menu
items that don't have a Menu parent, and

148
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.570
then we've got these Menu parents
that don't have Menu items.

149
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.430
So just have to look at
the cord a little bit closer,

150
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.750
but I think they just need to
be moved under each other.

151
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.280
All right, we've embarrassed Mark and
he's brought us all here.

152
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.790
So, somebody's gotta volunteer a site and
we'll, yeah.

153
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Can you
look up the Kixer site?

154
00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.390
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: What is that?

155
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Kixer.

156
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.790
Yeah.

157
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:01.360
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Is it with an e?

158
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.654
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I don't know,
just Google it.

159
00:08:02.654 --> 00:08:03.203
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Whoa.

160
00:08:03.203 --> 00:08:06.209
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: kickserv.com?

161
00:08:06.209 --> 00:08:06.758
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah.

162
00:08:06.758 --> 00:08:07.264
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Sweet.

163
00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:11.300
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I'll reach local product,
cool.

164
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.710
All right, so can I go back again?

165
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.930
Whoa It made noise at me.

166
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.020
Cool I'll go ahead and run it on here.

167
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.560
Another thing to keep in mind with these
is they are auditing the specific page

168
00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.520
that we're on.

169
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.720
So if you have a app with a couple of
big pages you'd want to run on those.

170
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.880
Running Audit.

171
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.650
Okay, at the same time, man this
site is doing something really wild.

172
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:38.520
You see these like rebounds?

173
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah dude.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Ten thousand errors?

174
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.405
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Or sorry, a thousand.

175
00:08:41.405 --> 00:08:45.377
Okay, so let's take it over the
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

176
00:08:48.916 --> 00:08:50.022
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: There, I have a feeling

177
00:08:50.022 --> 00:08:53.410
there's something going on with this site,
a little bit more serious.

178
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.865
Like I think I'm just-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: You're just poking the bear.

179
00:08:56.865 --> 00:08:59.340
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What you doing?

180
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.417
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I'm happy.

181
00:09:00.417 --> 00:09:01.473
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I don't
know what it's doing.

182
00:09:01.473 --> 00:09:02.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Woah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Woah.

183
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.750
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: We got some issues.

184
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:11.049
So it's fine and then something happens
yeah, like there's some these are,

185
00:09:11.049 --> 00:09:16.324
wait I wonder if this is just,
hold on a second let's take it in.

186
00:09:16.324 --> 00:09:19.690
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Let's take it over here,

187
00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:20.960
with no extensions on.

188
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:26.530
It's still doing something really wild.

189
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.090
Okay, so then I'll go and

190
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:33.470
I'll just enable just the accessibility
dev tools extension for incognito.

191
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:39.010
And then we'll go back over here and
see if I can,

192
00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:44.428
I might have to I have to
make a new tab with that.

193
00:09:44.428 --> 00:09:46.970
Either way, just trying to get that
one extension on with the rest of

194
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.544
the extensions off, basically, cool.

195
00:09:48.544 --> 00:09:51.688
Now audit again, all right,
still going crazy.

196
00:09:51.688 --> 00:09:52.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Still going crazy.

197
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.289
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I want you to audit then.

198
00:09:55.289 --> 00:09:55.913
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, so

199
00:09:55.913 --> 00:09:57.710
there's a chance-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Big.

200
00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.291
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: There's a chance, there's
just something about the accessibility dev

201
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:03.150
tool that's freaking out with this.

202
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.899
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah.

203
00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:05.830
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Because it
wasn't freaking out before.

204
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.410
So let's then try a different approach.

205
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.840
Okay, so
this found issues without the redirects.

206
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:16.170
So we've got images missing alt
attributes, cool logo, white two X.

207
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:24.190
And all images missing all attributes,
links with no texts inside of them.

208
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.910
This one is tricky,
I don't love this rule.

209
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.410
Cuz this is very common to do, right?

210
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.560
So you have an anchor with
an image inside of that and

211
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.000
the image is the thing to
click on which will throw.

212
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.970
It'll throw an accessibility, I think it
throws an error with W3 validator, too.

213
00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.590
I think it does.

214
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.780
They always want some type
of text inside of a link.

215
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.230
There's a couple of different
things that you can do out of here.

216
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.450
But the big thing is that the link then
doesn't get a name to be announced.

217
00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:56.190
It's like, where is the link,
what does the link do, where is it going?

218
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:59.480
So you can work around it with,
you can ignore that error and

219
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.948
work around it with giving it a title or
a label or something like that.

220
00:11:03.948 --> 00:11:07.002
You can also put some text it in and
visually hide it so it still gets read but

221
00:11:07.002 --> 00:11:07.956
it doesn't get seen.

222
00:11:07.956 --> 00:11:12.668
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So
what about images being the sole element

223
00:11:12.668 --> 00:11:16.510
within an anchor and the all text of that.

224
00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.380
Would you want the all
text to be descriptive

225
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.820
of where the link should take you?

226
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.200
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Exactly, no that's,
no that's exactly the problem.

227
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.540
Like that's what it's complaining about.

228
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.700
Cuz it's like all text should
be like the image description,

229
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.510
not about where it's going, right?

230
00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:33.470
You wouldn't want an image of
an arrow with an alt text that said,

231
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:34.540
check out, right?

232
00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: There is no alt text there,
so if there was?

233
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.210
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So
there are two different issues going on.

234
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.140
One, the image should have alt text
that says, whatever Kickserve logo.

235
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.760
But then also,
there should be either a label for

236
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.650
the link or a syntax that's visually
hidden in the link that says what it does.

237
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.430
Like return home or
something like that, right?

238
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:56.080
And that's a really common one because
it's a pretty common pattern to

239
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.760
put an image in a link and call it.

240
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What's that one right above?

241
00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.190
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: This one?

242
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.460
Image alt.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, what is that?

243
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.150
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I think,
let me see real quick.

244
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:09.800
I think it might be too long.

245
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:16.310
I think you get like 255 characters or
something like that.

246
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Or
just a spec of it of keyword staffing.

247
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.590
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: It might be that too.

248
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:27.530
Alt text limit, I'm not sure if
they have a character limit on it.

249
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.700
Anyway, I could do more research on
that but yeah it looks like, so one

250
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:38.340
thing that I'm not sure if this ran out of
room or if there really isn't a closing

251
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:43.840
quote on this alt text which
might actually be the problem.

252
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.756
But I would wager that it's either,
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Here it is, sorry,

253
00:12:48.756 --> 00:12:51.770
it's very long, alt attributes
should be clear, concise, accurate.

254
00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:53.730
So, yeah,
I think it's just extended whatever,

255
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:58.670
it uses as a calculation for-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I have relatively

256
00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.310
good example when to look at.

257
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.350
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Cool.

258
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.119
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: IBM actually
does a pretty darn good job.

259
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.325
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Just their main site?

260
00:13:06.325 --> 00:13:07.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: IBM.com, sure.

261
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.322
Even just their home page.

262
00:13:15.723 --> 00:13:21.560
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: All right,
a blank heading element.

263
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.330
I wonder what they use that for.

264
00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.586
I'm gonna in a separate
tab go to IBM.com and

265
00:13:27.586 --> 00:13:34.050
then I just wanna kinda see what
this sucker's being used for.

266
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And if you looked at
that like well structured headings.

267
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.900
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I've got really for

268
00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.560
the most part they've only got one area
where they actually have any contrast

269
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.080
issues.

270
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:48.600
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah.

271
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.663
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I've been doing
some work with the IBM folks and

272
00:13:51.663 --> 00:13:55.429
they're [CROSSTALK] pretty
into accessibility.

273
00:13:55.429 --> 00:13:58.036
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah I'm not sure
what they're using this one for.

274
00:13:58.036 --> 00:14:00.097
[LAUGH] I can't seem to find it anywhere.

275
00:14:00.097 --> 00:14:01.760
It's somewhere inside here,
so you go, okay.

276
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.090
So they have an H3 window
with content in it.

277
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:07.610
Single iFrame without a title.

278
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.070
Same alt text on multiple images.

279
00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:16.620
This one's really tricky to avoid
sometimes, because it's, you'll have,

280
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.470
like if you have a CMS of any kind, you'll
have alt text associated with an image,

281
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.560
and maybe you need to use that image
twice, and then you get this error.

282
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.000
So I wouldn't, I don't know that I would
worry about it all that much, and so

283
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.260
this is the same alt text
being used on multiple images.

284
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.860
Although, I guess what it's saying here,
yeah, so

285
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:38.520
here's where it gets tricky is that
the images have different sources.

286
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.610
So are these two appear
to have the same source?

287
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.120
Yeah, support learning lab and
support developer works,

288
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.170
both just yeah developer
works probably not the best.

289
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:54.250
They can have better than that, yeah but
I do see somethings if you use Wordpress.

290
00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:58.350
With Wordpress you can put all
text at time of implementation or

291
00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.020
you can add all text to
the image in your media library.

292
00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:05.635
So if you're to do that and reuse an image
twice on a page it could be problematic

293
00:15:05.635 --> 00:15:07.955
but, ya, I think this one just
could be a a little bit better.

294
00:15:09.305 --> 00:15:12.295
This one, ya again,
people do this one a lot.

295
00:15:12.295 --> 00:15:15.875
Link text is uninformative and
it just says learn more.

296
00:15:15.875 --> 00:15:18.185
This is like I think a lot of U.I.

297
00:15:18.185 --> 00:15:20.905
best practices battling
accessibility best practices.

298
00:15:20.905 --> 00:15:26.430
You know, people like, learn more is
like a super common content hierarchy.

299
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.970
And you put your title,
your little paragraph, a learn more link.

300
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.900
But for accessibility purposes,

301
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.850
the link should be a little
bit clear about what it does.

302
00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:39.740
Like learn more about IBM's video CTA or
whatever, you know what I mean?

303
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.550
Learn more about something.

304
00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:43.230
So I think that's kind of
what it's complaining about-

305
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:46.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What's a recommended fix?

306
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.140
What are they recommending for the fix?

307
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.150
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Don't use generic text.

308
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:53.120
Use text that accurately and
concisely conveys where the link goes.

309
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: That's the problem.

310
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.440
What's for it to know,
that's not on the link?

311
00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.580
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I see, yeah, yeah.

312
00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:05.540
I don't think I have a tenant account,
but basically it's gonna suggest,

313
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.900
I doubt it'll be specific enough,
but it is gonna suggest just that.

314
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.840
That you use some kind of actually
specific, again you can get away,

315
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.100
you can kinda maybe please both,

316
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.260
by being like learn more about
whatever the specific thing is.

317
00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:25.590
Link gives us an invalid hypertext
reference what have we got here.

318
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.470
JavaScript colon semicolon.

319
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:28.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: That looks like,

320
00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.940
I think that might be a bug.

321
00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I've never seen that before.

322
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.380
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I've never
seen that before either.

323
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.909
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I don't think it's a, look,
it has something to do with a video.

324
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:44.630
Video blog link [CROSSTALK] If you want
that to do an action but not go anywhere?

325
00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:47.860
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: No, so that's fine,
so you can do like JavaScript void for

326
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:48.720
that, right?

327
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.210
But what about, is this like?

328
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.670
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I think it's the same.

329
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:52.690
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I don't know, yeah, so

330
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.310
we could look into those things,
yeah, might be.

331
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.800
I've just never seen that approach before.

332
00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:59.400
Yeah, so okay.

333
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.750
None of this is like, I don't want to be
like digging into people's dirty laundry

334
00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:03.780
or whatever but it's cool.

335
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.920
It's like interesting, you can go to
the sites and start getting some ideas and

336
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.661
a lot of this stuff should be like really,
really easily fixable.

337
00:17:10.661 --> 00:17:14.108
Which is like one of the point I want
to drive home like this isn't like

338
00:17:14.108 --> 00:17:17.512
men like I need a, you know like we
can figure my server to do blah blah.

339
00:17:17.512 --> 00:17:21.670
It gets really it is like go in and
like remove this three,

340
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:23.441
man keep opening dictionary.

341
00:17:23.441 --> 00:17:29.020
[LAUGH] Or
add a title attribute to this one iframe,

342
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:33.000
stuff like that, I mean, you could do
a lot of these probably in a single day.

343
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.910
Which is pretty powerful when
you think about how many users

344
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.150
everyday could be better,
if you were to do these thing.

345
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.880
Does anybody else have a site they want?

346
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.130
Otherwise, I'm gonna call it.

347
00:17:44.284 --> 00:17:47.060
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Healthcare.gov-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

348
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.324
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: secure Security,

349
00:17:49.324 --> 00:17:53.570
cool there's a bunch in here okay.

350
00:17:58.255 --> 00:18:03.020
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Now so this site got
reamed when they first came out, right?

351
00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.520
Like it was broken, it was like not
working at all I think when it first

352
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.560
launched Pretty sure there was like
a whole big thing about it, okay, cool.

353
00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:16.140
So, it looks pretty decent,
it's got one of these issue, so,

354
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.260
let's see we'll see roll equals tabs.

355
00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:22.920
So, we want a tabless around it,
in order to get the most of that and then,

356
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:28.054
other than that, we've got One image
in a background, sometimes this will

357
00:18:28.054 --> 00:18:32.616
complain even when it's not a meaningful
image, in this case it is whoops.

358
00:18:37.445 --> 00:18:38.523
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: View and elements panel.

359
00:18:41.026 --> 00:18:42.680
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I don't
even see an image.

360
00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.340
Okay, well I don't know what it is,
but Text elements.

361
00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.490
it does have some contrast
issues looks like these.

362
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.020
This is like my steam,
it's kind of same thing,

363
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:56.400
white on blue looks like not as great
of contrast as it might appear to be.

364
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:02.700
Again links, see this the kind of
area where I complained that I,

365
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.680
I'm not sure how I feel about it.

366
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.880
Okay so when you, okay as a sighted
user Links to change the language make

367
00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:14.440
a ton of sense, right, cuz it will just
say the language's name in that language.

368
00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:19.500
But as a non-cited user, especially now,
one thing they're doing really well

369
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.720
here is that they have a lang attribute so
the screen will know to translate,

370
00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.710
but It'll still seem a little bit maybe
weird where it's not actually saying any

371
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.480
like changing the language to Chinese or
something like that.

372
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.090
It's really just like the word Chinese.

373
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.330
I still think it's okay,
context clue wise.

374
00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.320
Like if you're scrolling through and
then it's like Chinese, Japanese,

375
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.150
English you know you're like
it's a language picker.

376
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.860
But it could be better.

377
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.800
Honestly even having a label would be
a lot better you know just to be like

378
00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.520
change the language to Chinese,
something like that.

379
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.230
Cool.

380
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:54.190
Again, a big one people miss is
just putting the language in here.

381
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.550
Webpages that has a title tag.

382
00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.664
Yeah, so
there's no title tag to healthcare.gov.

383
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: The link
that somebody posted for

384
00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.280
the sole security site looks like it's,
it's pretty clean.

385
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.350
It's like,
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah,

386
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:16.380
secure.ssa.gov/iClaim/dib.

387
00:20:20.476 --> 00:20:21.350
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Did I get it right?

388
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:25.973
Yeah, typos., I type very well when
50 people aren't looking at me,

389
00:20:25.973 --> 00:20:28.600
just so you all know, I'm a great typer.

390
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: It looks right.

391
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:34.260
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: One of the best.

392
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.010
Excellent.

393
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Tremendous.

394
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:36.530
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Https
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah.

395
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:39.430
Here we go.

396
00:20:40.608 --> 00:20:42.320
Direct fast sites.

397
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.740
Okay, do another audit here.

398
00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:48.656
So one thing that's kinda funny like
one thing that you'll notice is that

399
00:20:48.656 --> 00:20:52.838
accessibility though it's kinda becoming
a harder topic in mainstream web.

400
00:20:52.838 --> 00:20:56.493
It's been really important for
like educational, government and

401
00:20:56.493 --> 00:20:59.720
like banking institutions for
a really long time.

402
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.530
So, you'll see some of this sites like a
lot of times that maybe don't look super,

403
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:07.310
cutting edge, but the accessibility
experience will be like, amazing on this.

404
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:11.535
You know, you'll see like an or something
like that, and it's like, you know,

405
00:21:11.535 --> 00:21:13.497
It might look a little bit like old style.

406
00:21:13.497 --> 00:21:15.588
But then yeah you'll like
pop on the screen reader and

407
00:21:15.588 --> 00:21:17.650
it's like a delightful experience.

408
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:21.590
So it's pretty cool that you can like so

409
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:26.210
I guess like roll equal mains only
appear on significant elements

410
00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.170
which actually this feels significant so
I'm not sure what that's about.

411
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.140
What looks like one
collision with an iFrame and

412
00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.990
a link that are kinda touching each other
even though they're both focusable and

413
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:37.060
then other than that it's all good.

414
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:41.300
This is probably the best site I've ever
seen as far as asessability audits go.

415
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.360
So yeah, great job with social security,

416
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.952
that's awesome and I think,
do we have one more?

417
00:21:47.952 --> 00:21:52.520
Yeah, mybenefitscalwind.org.

418
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:57.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Am I allowed
to suggest donaldjtrump.com?

419
00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:02.770
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah,
they just have that not XSS XSS but

420
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.050
we can do accessibility audit too.

421
00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.464
Again this one's really great, this is
like I think we're gonna start seeing this

422
00:22:08.464 --> 00:22:11.173
like weird audit sites all day if
they're like dot edu or dot org.

423
00:22:11.173 --> 00:22:14.895
And they're institution sites
they're gonna be mostly green and

424
00:22:14.895 --> 00:22:19.880
if they're really slick looking like web
2.0 sites they're gonna be probably having

425
00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.950
some issues.

426
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.600
Yeah, this one looks good again.

427
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.990
Its got that AntiPattern that we talked
about at the very beginning of don't

428
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:27.390
put positive integers,

429
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:31.410
except what they're really doing
here it's a skiplink like we built.

430
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:35.400
It's kind of good where they're like,
push make that skip,

431
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:41.260
it blinks right up at the top, so I would
give this one a pass and say that's okay.

432
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.340
Meaningful images again,

433
00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.370
kinda starting to see the same
thing a few warnings about ratio.

434
00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:48.840
Other than that it looks really good.

435
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.710
Does this have its own domain?

436
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:54.971
Yeah, ysplash/officialshirt.

437
00:23:00.192 --> 00:23:01.710
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: It's not the page,
I don't know how to get to his page.

438
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.980
Continue to site, my bad.

439
00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:04.956
Stop, stop.

440
00:23:08.342 --> 00:23:09.166
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Clear.

441
00:23:13.575 --> 00:23:14.617
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Dang it.

442
00:23:19.214 --> 00:23:21.906
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: My goodness, I like,
there, it was like gone for a minute.

443
00:23:21.906 --> 00:23:25.140
Okay, cool, not it.

444
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.840
Some controls missing labels,

445
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:33.440
I think like the hope here is to like
We covered a whole lot of stuff.

446
00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.165
But now we can see that it's a smaller
world where it's like, okay,

447
00:23:36.165 --> 00:23:38.020
we're seeing a lot of the same stuff.

448
00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:40.980
Those controls need labels,
those images need alt texts.

449
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.390
If you're gonna do roles,
which you should,

450
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:47.050
just make sure you structure them like
children need to belong to parents.

451
00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.850
Check your colors to contrast ratio,
that kind of thing.

452
00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:52.750
Yeah, a few images missing all text.

453
00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:56.970
Meaningful images in the background.

454
00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:00.720
Contrast ratio, same stuff same stuff.

455
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.060
Missing a tittle, missing a language.

456
00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:07.370
And then here's a few that
are tabulable but they are hidden for

457
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.450
some reason like telephone number and
stuff like that.

458
00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:15.130
So they should be probably not
tabulable or not invisible and then,

459
00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:17.240
yeah, that same closed-captioning
thing for the video.

460
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.210
So, yeah, unless anybody has another site,
any questions, things like that,

461
00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:23.470
that's all I had.

462
00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:27.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I would say that that is
a common problem that I've run into

463
00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:32.040
in auditing other people's sites,
is where they'll elements like.

464
00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.860
Maybe it's a pop-up or
a menu on Hover or something like that

465
00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:41.570
they have not taking out of
the keyboard access while it's hidden.

466
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:46.380
And so someone's tabbing through the site,
and suddenly, it disappears.

467
00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.130
Yeah, I really don't
have an idea where it is.

468
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:52.850
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Okay, so if you have like
modal And it has form fields in it or

469
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:53.750
something like that right?

470
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:56.270
Then if it's hidden off,
it can still be part of the tab index,

471
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.080
there's a couple of ways
you can deal with that.

472
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:04.610
Yeah, cuz you can give it no tab index,
take it away and then give it back.

473
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.630
You can do ARIA hidden for it, and

474
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.950
I think that'll keep it out of,
I'm not sure on that one.

475
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:12.030
I think you can.

476
00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:13.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: You can hit it with CSS.

477
00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:14.430
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, right, so yeah,

478
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:15.970
there's a couple different approaches,
you can have that.

479
00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:18.690
I've definitely had that before where
I'm tabbing through the nav and

480
00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:21.680
then my cursor is gone,
and I'm like, where is it?

481
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.140
And then it shows back up on the page
again, I'm like, whoa, where were you?

482
00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.260
[LAUGH] And if you look on the dom,
yeah, you'll see some form elements.

483
00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.490
That's a really good one.

484
00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:33.840
Yeah, I've definitely seen that before,
cool.

485
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: You can't tell where you
are if you try tabbing through the site.

486
00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:42.470
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So that's one that it,
yeah, it doesn't really catch, so

487
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:43.880
this is a good example.

488
00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.830
This is one that it didn't catch but
you all could catch now that you know, so

489
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.060
I'm tabbing through here and

490
00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:52.150
I have absolutely no idea where I am,
even as the screen moves.

491
00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:57.120
So here I see these, this form actually
has not a focus but it has my cursor.

492
00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:01.460
But then if I tab back or forward,
I have no visual indicators like at all,

493
00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.568
until I get all the way up to the URL.

494
00:26:03.568 --> 00:26:07.658
.So again it's like, and this is gonna be
one for those of you who are developers,

495
00:26:07.658 --> 00:26:10.950
you gonna probably have to be like
going and forth with designers.

496
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:14.063
And it will be like, no, this is how I
want it to look and you're like I need

497
00:26:14.063 --> 00:26:16.807
some kind of focus indicator,
we need some kind of visual clue.

498
00:26:16.807 --> 00:26:20.900
That can be a tough battle sometimes but
it is yeah, it is tough if you're trying

499
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.090
to keyboard only and
you have no idea where you're at, cool.
