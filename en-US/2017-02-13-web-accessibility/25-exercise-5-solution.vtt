WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.930
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yes, we had some
really good discussion both on chat and

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:03.690
in person, so

3
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.590
I just wanted to tackle a couple of things
before we go into the code example.

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.400
I mistakenly used the wrong title,
I was copy pasting, so sorry.

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.130
It says keyboard navigation up here.

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.200
And then, so

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.830
people were talking back on that great
question about if you have a spinner,

8
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.554
and you're loading content in, with regard
to announcements and things like that.

9
00:00:24.554 --> 00:00:26.870
Se had mentioned a little bit before,

10
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.730
Jack was talking about this
concept of the accessibility tree.

11
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.520
And basically,
how if it's not in that tree, or

12
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.300
if you want content to be read aloud, it
has to be part of the accessibility tree.

13
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.260
But the accessibility tree is updated for
free when you append or remove domino.

14
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.070
So if you have a spinner
without ARIA live on it, and

15
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.000
that is just stops spinning or something
like that, that wouldn't get you very far.

16
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.200
But as long as dominoes are being
in pending in that side bar area,

17
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.370
they'll become part of
the accessibility tree.

18
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.620
So then, after it loads in, just for free,
you'll get the right functionality, for

19
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.200
then when you move over to it.

20
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.470
So that was really good, and then people
were talking about a little bit of like

21
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.000
ARIA live, and ARIA relevant, and can
you use ARIA Relevant without ARIA Live?

22
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.510
So we were talking a little bit about
ideas, and Jack was mentioning the concept

23
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.886
of using ARIA Relevant within
JavaScript to control,

24
00:01:24.886 --> 00:01:28.010
to silence, temporary silence
the screen reader without having to

25
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.950
redo all of the different areas that
are live regions, something like that.

26
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:31.865
So I'm assuming,

27
00:01:31.865 --> 00:01:35.140
I'm not sure, I definitely look into,
does it cascade in any way?

28
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.160
Could you have an ARIA Relevant on
the body tag that you'd set to off?

29
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.040
I'm not sure.

30
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.240
But it's interesting, there's definitely
some really interesting used cases for,

31
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.750
like advanced use cases for

32
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.000
the ARIA attributes to really
control what the screen reader says.

33
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.650
And I think that was it.

34
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.988
I wanted to go through in order
doing the JavaScript first,

35
00:01:55.988 --> 00:01:59.548
so we can experience what it's
like with no ARIA live regions.

36
00:01:59.548 --> 00:02:03.552
And then from there,
move into the ARIA stuff just so

37
00:02:03.552 --> 00:02:09.170
we can all be on the same page, so
just go through this pretty fast.

38
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.130
Again, cuz the JavaScript isn't
really the important part

39
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.540
as much as the accessibility.

40
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.780
So I put these three IDs.

41
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.900
So account and dec, and then I think
I have an empty ARIA, that JS file.

42
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.310
So I'll do var increment, man,
my spelling, increment, that seems good.

43
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.735
Next time, I'm gonna go up and down.

44
00:02:29.735 --> 00:02:33.850
[LAUGH] var counter.

45
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.800
Okay, so we'll set these things,
just document.querySelector,

46
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:50.506
and then we'll just do the ID of inc
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: [INAUDIBLE]

47
00:02:50.506 --> 00:02:52.106
#doc,

48
00:02:52.106 --> 00:02:58.995
and
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: The idea of count.

49
00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:00.925
Just to grab onto all
three of those things, and

50
00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:05.655
then I think the way that I did it
in my example, just to quickly do it

51
00:03:05.655 --> 00:03:10.745
is I just have a global variable of count,
which I start at zero.

52
00:03:10.745 --> 00:03:16.880
And then I think I have
a function that sets the counter,

53
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.670
which I think just does something like,
I take the counter,

54
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.960
and then I set its innerHTML to be
whatever the counter's currently at.

55
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.680
So I think we could call something
like set counter, and just call it.

56
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.980
So I think if we do this, and
I get rid of this value in here of zero.

57
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.010
But then I refresh it,
it should be zero anyway.

58
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.550
Now, it's getting set by that JavaScript.

59
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.652
Yep, and then from there just, again,
if you wanted to do this right,

60
00:03:44.652 --> 00:03:48.135
you'd have to be more careful,
the pricing integers out or whatever.

61
00:03:48.135 --> 00:03:49.841
But for now,
we're just gonna keep it pretty simple.

62
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:53.704
So we can just do function add, and

63
00:03:53.704 --> 00:03:58.909
functions subtract, and then function add.

64
00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:03.870
I'll just set the count equals,
count plus 10 or something like that.

65
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.830
And then function subtract, I'll set
the count equals count minus ten, and

66
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.800
then both of them we'll just call,
still getting used to this editor here,

67
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.440
what's going on?

68
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Command D.

69
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.730
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: setCounter, cool.

70
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.695
So I think that should not work,
and I was right.

71
00:04:32.345 --> 00:04:33.843
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: What do
I got going wrong here?

72
00:04:33.843 --> 00:04:36.599
count=0 setCounter.

73
00:04:38.173 --> 00:04:39.779
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Wait, yeah, yeah, yeah.

74
00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:40.540
I'm sorry, I don't have any selectors.

75
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.590
[LAUGH] Cool.

76
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.650
So we've got the count
initially set to here, and

77
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.090
then we just wanna do something
like increment.addEventListener,

78
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.090
and then just set, like when you click
the increment, it runs the add function.

79
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.382
And then decrement.addEventListener,
and when you click the decrement,

80
00:04:57.382 --> 00:04:59.230
it runs the subtract function.

81
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.960
Oops, Subtract function, cool.

82
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.420
Cool, so that goes up and down.

83
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.030
So, okay.
So but

84
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.280
what I wanted to talk about here is then,
so we've got this JavaScript,

85
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.670
and it's making these buttons
that change these values.

86
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.380
And so if we go ahead, and
we turn on the screen reader.

87
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.690
&gt;&gt; Digital Voice: Navigation
window reload this page.

88
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.660
Keyboard navigation visited, link, back,
increment, button, decrement, button.

89
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.500
You are current, increment button,
you are currently on a button.

90
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.939
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So
you can see I'm doing stuff, and

91
00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:34.385
it's literally giving me no clue.

92
00:05:34.385 --> 00:05:36.030
Like A, what the button does.

93
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.260
Which we could solve with labels and
describe by and things like that.

94
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.610
But B, I hit the button, and
I don't get any feedback.

95
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.901
So there's visual feedback.

96
00:05:44.901 --> 00:05:47.784
If you're a sighted user, you can
see that the button's being hit, and

97
00:05:47.784 --> 00:05:49.260
you can see that these are changing.

98
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.399
But there's just no feedback being
given to you about what's happening.

99
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.700
And so the basics that we could do
is we could take our account here,

100
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.290
and we could just add ARIA live
region on it, and we could do.

101
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.936
This is one thing I love about,
I'm not here to preach editors.

102
00:06:05.936 --> 00:06:09.341
But one thing I love about Visual Studio
Code is that they take accessibility

103
00:06:09.341 --> 00:06:10.665
really seriously.

104
00:06:10.665 --> 00:06:13.515
It's one of the only editors
that built-in, fills in

105
00:06:13.515 --> 00:06:16.865
all of your different ARIA standards and
attributes, things like that.

106
00:06:16.865 --> 00:06:20.495
It just comes that way, so it's nice, so
you don't have to be looking stuff up.

107
00:06:21.705 --> 00:06:23.560
So yeah, so ARIA live assertive.

108
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.340
So we can go back and
refresh it again with the counter on.

109
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.150
&gt;&gt; Digital Voice: Increment button,
E10, 20, 30.

110
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.123
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: And then.

111
00:06:32.123 --> 00:06:33.620
&gt;&gt; Digital Voice: Decrement of 20, 10.

112
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.635
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So at least,
that way we have some signal going in.

113
00:06:36.635 --> 00:06:39.035
We could go a lot further
with it if we wanted to,

114
00:06:39.035 --> 00:06:41.855
like we could add a label to this.

115
00:06:41.855 --> 00:06:44.175
We could make this focusable and
add a label to it.

116
00:06:44.175 --> 00:06:46.755
So try to get to read
the label as it updates,

117
00:06:46.755 --> 00:06:48.425
so it could be as the current value.

118
00:06:48.425 --> 00:06:51.437
I don't have context,
let's say this was points.

119
00:06:51.437 --> 00:06:55.587
You could say your current points are 10,
or whatever the context is.

120
00:06:55.587 --> 00:06:58.657
This isn't really anything, it's just
numbers, but you could start playing

121
00:06:58.657 --> 00:07:02.250
around with, again, turn the screen reader
on, you've got your ARIA live set up,

122
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.040
find an appropriate label,
so it rereads it every time.

123
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.140
Maybe some labels,

124
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.880
you could even visually hide them on
the buttons that say what they do.

125
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.870
Like increment your points by ten,
decrement your points by ten,

126
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.670
and before long, you've got a really
robust experience for screen reader users.

127
00:07:17.934 --> 00:07:20.970
There are two things, so
we're gonna get into color next.

128
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.200
But before we do, there were two
things that I wanted to point out that

129
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.760
are pretty neat as
you're going along here.

130
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.300
We have a whole section at
the end on tooling, but

131
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.720
there is some really great tools for
Chrome.

132
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.950
One of the cool things is a dev
tool experiment with accessibility.

133
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:42.831
So if you're interested, you can,
in Chrome, go to about://flags.

134
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:44.340
So these are like experiment.

135
00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.750
Don't even, just ignore that top.

136
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.870
That top network says I
might ruin everything.

137
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.716
But if you go to dev tools,
you should take caution.

138
00:07:52.716 --> 00:07:53.512
I was just kidding.

139
00:07:53.512 --> 00:07:55.352
I just like that it's
got like a nuclear sign.

140
00:07:55.352 --> 00:07:56.722
It's like careful, warning.

141
00:07:56.722 --> 00:08:00.607
But anyway, one of the things you can
do in here is you can turn on dev tools

142
00:08:00.607 --> 00:08:03.230
experiments, which is great.

143
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.180
It'll keep you kind of up to
date with all the latest and

144
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.880
greatest stuff they're working on.

145
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.890
So you turn that on, and
you restart your browser, and

146
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.080
then what you'll see different
is with dev tools open,

147
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.760
you can go here and go to settings,
and you'll see this experiments tab.

148
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.790
The the only reason I wanted to point that
out is because they recently added this

149
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.550
accessibility inspection experiment,
which is really cool.

150
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.350
And so basically, you turn experiments on,
refresh your browser, and

151
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:26.750
then you turn this experiment on.

152
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.510
And you'll start getting some really neat
stuff, so if you're over in the elements

153
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:38.300
tab, and we find our little ARIA
live region area, which is here.

154
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.820
And then we come over here,
you'll notice a new, two of new ones,

155
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.210
which is Accessibility and
Accessibility Properties.

156
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.070
So, Accessibility Properties will
show you these really nice things,

157
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:52.180
like what your ARIA live is currently
set to, contrast color ratio,

158
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.540
what the current value is,
things like that.

159
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:59.510
Similarly, this accessibility tab
will give you a lot more very basic

160
00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.800
stuff on what ARIA attributes
are on the item, if any, and

161
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.140
then what properties the item has.

162
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.050
So this is a way to visualize
this accessibility tree.

163
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.075
This is the information
the browser has to work with.

164
00:09:11.075 --> 00:09:12.226
So you can click on some of the-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Real

165
00:09:12.226 --> 00:09:12.914
quickly, what was the flag?

166
00:09:12.914 --> 00:09:17.140
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: It's about colon//flags,
then if you do Ctrl+F or Command F for

167
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:22.109
a file find, and you just search dev
tools, there's only one on that whole list

168
00:09:22.109 --> 00:09:26.430
for dev tools, and then enabling
it will require a browser restart.

169
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.854
But then after that, you'll be able
to go to experiments and turn it on.

170
00:09:30.854 --> 00:09:34.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I was gonna say I
enabled it, but I didn't see it.

171
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.888
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah,
you just got to refresh your browser,

172
00:09:35.888 --> 00:09:37.970
which you might not want
to do right at this second.

173
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:38.930
But it's cool.

174
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.910
So anyways, you can see this one doesn't
have any, but again, I love the dev

175
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.870
tools because they help you visualize
this stuff that we're learning about.

176
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.790
So as we learn about accessibility and
ARIA accessibility trees, it's cool to be

177
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:53.170
able to click on one and just see like
what information the browser has.

178
00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.170
Like okay, it's an ARIA live region.

179
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.999
None of these are necessarily suggestions,

180
00:09:57.999 --> 00:10:02.210
but it's letting you know
things it doesn't have.

181
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:05.810
It's a live region, but it doesn't have a
label, and it's not labelled by anything,

182
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:06.730
and it doesn't have a title.

183
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:11.170
So to me, I would be like, okay,
it probably wants those things, right?

184
00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:13.540
Live region, let me go give it
a label like we talked about.

185
00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.260
Let me go give it a title,
things like that.

186
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
And then this one is cool,
too, just in the property.

187
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.860
So you can start doing a little
bit of color contrast,

188
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.890
which is what we're
going to move into next.

189
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.460
But also, just seeing what
attributes are on an item.
