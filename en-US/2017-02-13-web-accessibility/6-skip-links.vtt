00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.130
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Cool.
Another really,

2
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.240
really great concept is
this idea of Skip Links.

3
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.300
For those that don't use
keyboard navigation,

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.890
this will probably start surprising
you as you start using it.

5
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.830
But if you go to
The New York Times website,

6
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.330
you will see only two link at the top,
sections and search.

7
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.950
But if you start tabbing through,
once you get past search,

8
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.070
this thing will appear and
it says skip to navigation.

9
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.640
And so you'll often see these on websites
where basically what's going on is they're

10
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.090
trying to help out and say, you're
starting to tab through our site, but

11
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.150
we have a lot of stuff before
the meat of the website.

12
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.130
Do you wanna just skip?

13
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.765
And sometimes it's skip to navigation,
sometimes it's skip to main content,

14
00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:40.070
things like that,
sometimes you'll see a skip to comments.

15
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.010
And so
these are called Skip Links and, yeah,

16
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.470
the basic idea is again,
recognizing a keyboard only user and

17
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.760
trying to help them out a little bit
by allowing them to just move past.

18
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.820
Cuz otherwise, if you tabbed through
you'd be on US International,

19
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.130
the different languages, the date, you're
tabbing through all those things, so it's

20
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.950
giving you an offer here of, do you just
wanna skip down to the main navigation?

21
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.480
And so,
these can be achieved really simply.

22
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.760
So the basic idea, is that you have,

23
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.470
let's say,
three different sections to your web site.

24
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.500
You have your navigation,
you have your main content.

25
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.720
And then up at the very top,
let's say you put this link, and

26
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.760
you give it a class of skip-link,
and you give it its reference.

27
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.410
It points to the main content, let's say.

28
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.540
So you have, it's just an anchor,
so skip to main content.

29
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.430
And it will move you down
to that main content div.

30
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.780
And so then all you do is you take it,
and you position absolute it, and

31
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.070
you push it up off the screen, like up
to the top you see top negative 40.

32
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.480
I gave it red and white so
it could be really starkly visible.

33
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.140
But you could give it
whatever colors you want.

34
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.840
And then on its focus state, and here
were kinda getting into these focus ball

35
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.070
elements, you set the top
back down to zero.

36
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.280
So just basically you take this link,

37
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.290
let's say it's the very
first thing in your website.

38
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.740
And it's an anchor, so
it'll be tabbable by default.

39
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.990
So this will be the first thing you tab.

40
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.330
You use CSS to hide it by
default in any number of ways.

41
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.350
And then on its focus state, you on
high def, that's simply how you do it,

42
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.610
there's no JavaScript
necessary nothing like that.

43
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.760
And so this will be ignored by users that
are using a mouse, they'll never be able

44
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.710
to cover on anything like that, but the
second somebody hits tab in the keyboard,

45
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.580
this thing will pop up and like, hey,
do you wanna just skip to my main content?

46
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:29.410
And so there's a whole Webaim article on
skip links webaim.org/techniques/skipnav.

47
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.030
Cool.

48
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.470
So we're hitting more of
these checklist items now.

49
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.330
So this is a recommendation and

50
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.430
the success criteria is that a link
should be provided to skip navigation and

51
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.070
other page elements that
are repeated across web pages.

52
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.950
So again if you have your header.php,
your whatever it is,

53
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.440
the whole template with your nav and
all that stuff.

54
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.970
You don't want users to have to tab
through it every single page they're on.

55
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.880
So give them some way out,
some way where they can tab through.

56
00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.620
And then yeah, there's some specific ones
on like, if I page is proper heading,

57
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.650
it may be considered as sufficient
to just skip to main content.

58
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.220
Sometimes navigations
what you want to skip to.

59
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.980
Again, think about the use case and
what would make more sense for your site.

60
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.660
Cool.
We also got another one which is

61
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.120
another thing we can check off and
on, which is when a web element or

62
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.600
a page element receives focus, it doesn't
have a substantial change to the page.

63
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.280
Again, so the two things that need to
happen on focus are some kind of visual

64
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.440
indicator, right?

65
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.270
And then also, and this is an anti
pattern to avoid here, is you don't wanna

66
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.480
listen for On Focus events and do a bunch
of wild JavaScript and things like that.

67
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.140
That's not cool.

68
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.090
Because you might think Focus only happens
when they kinda click on the thing,

69
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.410
but Focus really happens for

70
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.720
people that are just trying to
tab through your site as well.

71
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.080
So if you have like a modal
that needs to appear,

72
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.590
do an onclick or onkeyup or
something like that.

73
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.270
Don't do it onfocus.

74
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.200
And with those, we can take two check
marks off the WebAIM recommendation.

75
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.410
Does that one make sense,
the focus concept?

76
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.940
Okay, cool.

77
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.500
Yeah, feel free to stop me
if something is not clear.
