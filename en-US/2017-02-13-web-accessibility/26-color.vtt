00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.340
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Color is a tricky one.

2
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.370
So getting back to our checklist,
one big one is page content can't flash

3
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.230
more than three times per second, unless
it's a very small area that's flashing.

4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.020
So this is like it can invoke seizures,

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.780
it can also just be incredibly
hard to read for people.

6
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.810
And so that one is at both at
the bottom and the top level.

7
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.620
A and triple A.

8
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.980
A just allows you,
if you have sufficiently small areas,

9
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.756
it allows them to be A-compliant.

10
00:00:26.756 --> 00:00:30.050
If you wanna be triple A compliant,
you can't have anything flash that often.

11
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.870
There's this really great
Chrome plug-in called NoCoffee.

12
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.790
I think it's worth spending a minute on.

13
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.310
It's this really cool project,

14
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.830
where it simulates a lot of
different visual conditions.

15
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.360
And you can view your website
with these visual conditions and

16
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.770
get some really good insight into.

17
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.140
I think as you get started in
accessibility, you're often thinking,

18
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.475
or I often was thinking about, okay sites
need to work really well for visual and

19
00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:54.485
blind users.

20
00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:57.285
But there's a whole huge spectrum there.

21
00:00:57.285 --> 00:01:01.275
And it's really true, because most people
don't fall into the blind category.

22
00:01:01.275 --> 00:01:03.905
But most people don't fall into
that visual category either, right.

23
00:01:03.905 --> 00:01:06.956
Most people have some sort
of visual impairment.

24
00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:10.686
Even if it's really small and
you just maybe need glasses, or

25
00:01:10.686 --> 00:01:12.777
things are blurry far away.

26
00:01:12.777 --> 00:01:14.507
All the way to no vision.

27
00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:17.057
So this helps you simulate
a lot of different things.

28
00:01:17.057 --> 00:01:22.377
So we can go ahead and
grab this NoCoffee for Chrome.

29
00:01:22.377 --> 00:01:23.977
I might already have it installed.

30
00:01:23.977 --> 00:01:25.137
No, I don't.

31
00:01:25.137 --> 00:01:26.260
Okay, cool.

32
00:01:29.785 --> 00:01:32.009
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Download interrupted.

33
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.247
Give me my thing.

34
00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:38.590
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Okay, cool.

35
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.730
So this allows you to go to a site,
we can go to our site here.

36
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.880
And you click on this NoCoffee logo, and
you can see a lot of different things.

37
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.370
So you can fully customize it,
which is great.

38
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.800
You can also simulate some of
my blocked visual fields, so

39
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.464
people that have a blocked,
let me see here.

40
00:01:57.157 --> 00:01:58.238
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: What's going on?

41
00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:05.302
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I wonder, I think it
might be just that it's over file protocol

42
00:02:05.302 --> 00:02:06.450
that it's not working.

43
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.814
Let me try a different website.

44
00:02:10.128 --> 00:02:11.730
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: There we go, yeah.

45
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.320
I think it's Chrome extensions
can't hit over file.

46
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.120
Okay, so you can go to my Twitter site or
whatever and you can see.

47
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.800
So we can start with Normal and

48
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.570
then we can go onto things like
a blocked central visual field, so

49
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.180
people just kinda have problems focusing
on the thing right in the middle.

50
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.560
And you can go all the way to,
yeah different peripheral ones where

51
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.150
it's kinda hard to see things
on the outside focusing in.

52
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.570
Then you can do a whole lot of different
things with color stuff too, so

53
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.170
you can see all these
different color deficiencies.

54
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.219
Some affect certain sites and some don't.

55
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.050
Somewhere pretty minimum.

56
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.326
Anyway so you can do a lot of
really cool stuff on here.

57
00:02:50.326 --> 00:02:56.254
This isn't necessarily me, I'm not
saying hey you should go through each

58
00:02:56.254 --> 00:03:01.523
one of these things or whatever,
but I think it really can help with

59
00:03:01.523 --> 00:03:06.770
that empathy level of understanding
what different users have.

60
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.740
It goes a little slow when
you add a bunch of them.

61
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.770
But understanding how different
users might see your site, and

62
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.330
just the things that you can do to be,
okay don't put pertinent data

63
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.605
on the very far outskirts, or
make sure that your text is big enough and

64
00:03:19.605 --> 00:03:23.360
well-spaced enough that people
can get those visual indicators.

65
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.000
And it kind of goes back to what I was
talking about before, where it's like

66
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.320
people I've talked to a lot of low-vision
users that they don't want a plain,

67
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.940
no style accessible version of a website.

68
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.710
They just want a little
bit of consideration.

69
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.984
And another really interesting anecdote
from a user who's got low vision,

70
00:03:42.984 --> 00:03:47.605
she has to zoom in very far to see sites
and it's just something to kinda consider.

71
00:03:47.605 --> 00:03:51.669
So she was on Khan Academy doing a lot of
their lessons, like learning JavaScript,

72
00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.320
something like that.

73
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.540
And she's on an area where
you write in the code editor.

74
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.730
And she's writing in the code editor and
nothing is happening, it's not passing her

75
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.670
to the next level and she's trying
to figure out what's going on.

76
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.750
Eventually she zooms out and
she sees that on the far

77
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.640
right of the screen is where it tells
you if you have compilation errors.

78
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.460
So she zoomed in on the far left so

79
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.630
she can see it and
any warnings that are on the site.

80
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.935
Again it's not a silver bullet solution
in the sense of, you don't have to keep

81
00:04:17.935 --> 00:04:22.165
everything stacked on top of each other,
but just stuff to be considerate of.

82
00:04:22.165 --> 00:04:26.185
That if you offer something like a zoom
in function maybe, you should put it more

83
00:04:26.185 --> 00:04:31.080
of a straight aligned up and
down visual site from there on.

84
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.799
So I just think those are interesting.

85
00:04:32.799 --> 00:04:36.122
I love the NoCoffee simulator,
I think it's really great.

86
00:04:36.122 --> 00:04:41.262
And I use it a lot for just getting
a better idea of how sites look.
