&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So finishing up,

2
00:00:00.906 --> 00:00:04.510
the three things I would recommend
everybody do today, tomorrow, whatever,

3
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.107
to your site, is grab one of
those tools and run an audit.

4
00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:09.932
So whether it's the Chrome Dev Tools,
Firefox Dev Tools, or

5
00:00:09.932 --> 00:00:11.354
one of those third party ones.

6
00:00:11.354 --> 00:00:14.158
Check the color schemes that you use,
both on web and

7
00:00:14.158 --> 00:00:16.390
then also on your physical media.

8
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.500
And the community, I really just can't say
enough about the accessibility community.

9
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.347
I think there's just something in
the nature of doing good work that makes

10
00:00:24.347 --> 00:00:25.724
people really friendly.

11
00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:29.903
But I've been a part of a lot of different
CSS and JavaScript communities before, and

12
00:00:29.903 --> 00:00:33.825
nobody's been as friendly as
the accessibility community.

13
00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:37.025
There's a lot of cool meetups going on,
even if they're smaller in a lot of areas.

14
00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:38.533
I'm not sure about this area, but

15
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.835
I know in California we have a couple
of different accessibility meetups.

16
00:00:41.835 --> 00:00:44.840
There's some really good
conferences that happen every year.

17
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.278
And then there's just a ton
of really nice people online,

18
00:00:47.278 --> 00:00:52.330
people I mentioned Rob Dodson, he works
at Google doing a bunch of accessibility.

19
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.685
Marcy Sutton, she works at a private
company called Deque that does a bunch of

20
00:00:56.685 --> 00:00:58.031
accessibility stuff.

21
00:00:58.031 --> 00:01:01.053
Yeah, just like, a lot of really great
people, whether it's Twitter, Meetup,

22
00:01:01.053 --> 00:01:01.929
however you reach out.
