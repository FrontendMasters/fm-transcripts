00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.560
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: All right, so, we talked
about this a little bit already and

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.400
how important it is.

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.940
I think the easiest thing to get started
with and probably the biggest win

4
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.010
is just using Semantic HTML,
just using the correct stuff.

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.720
Cuz again, like you start seeing
all this amazing functionality.

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.415
Now that you're keyboard users and

7
00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:20.645
you're trying to learn how to use
a select with just your keyboard.

8
00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:22.592
And then you hit space,
and the arrows, and

9
00:00:22.592 --> 00:00:25.290
you're trying to figure out
all of those different things.

10
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.770
It's hard to remember, to implement all of
those pieces of functionality if you're

11
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.150
building your own check box, or
selectbox, or different things like that.

12
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.950
And those are not only best practices for

13
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.340
developers but users are used to,
like space should trigger a checkbox.

14
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.210
Like if you build your own checkbox and
you don't have a key up listener for

15
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.581
space, like people aren't gonna
know how to fill that out.

16
00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:51.410
So more checkboxes off
our WebAIM guide here.

17
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.195
Make sure that the language is always
defined in the HTML attribute,

18
00:00:56.195 --> 00:00:57.828
it's like a big one that I see.

19
00:00:57.828 --> 00:01:02.458
And then, same with if there are any
things in different languages which I

20
00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:06.491
do see sometimes like blockquotes or
I don't know, excerpts,

21
00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:10.820
things like that, make sure you
specify those languages as well.

22
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.250
I don't really have
the screen readers out.

23
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.659
And then, yeah,
this one is a little bit trickier.

24
00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.649
So words that may be ambiguous, unknown or
used in a specific way which is kinda like

25
00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.639
leading into what we were talking about,
can be defined through adjacent text, or

26
00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:27.550
a definition, or a glossary,
different things like that.

27
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.680
So, I think that one is a lot
harder to be kinda giving out.

28
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.997
But I think just a lot of, like with your
labels and your descriptions like context

29
00:01:35.997 --> 00:01:38.515
clues sort of where you're at and
what, you know what I mean?

30
00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:42.581
Kinda going back to like, if you're nested
inside something like a form or whatever,

31
00:01:42.581 --> 00:01:45.256
like repeating those
the descriptions of where you are,

32
00:01:45.256 --> 00:01:48.820
can give a lot of context clues to the
piece of information that you are asking

33
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.746
for.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: There's

34
00:01:51.746 --> 00:01:53.040
an element for that.

35
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.600
So yeah, these are probably
three things that I see a lot,

36
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.350
that are pretty easy fixes,
and pretty rough experiences.

37
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.316
So, we've kinda talked
about div class="button".

38
00:02:01.316 --> 00:02:05.088
It's always like a big no, no, like those
should always be actual button tags.

39
00:02:05.088 --> 00:02:07.337
Checkboxes are like even worse,

40
00:02:07.337 --> 00:02:12.317
the thing is that people really hate
the way browsers render checkboxes,

41
00:02:12.317 --> 00:02:18.355
designers really, really don't like them,
they all render them really differently.

42
00:02:18.355 --> 00:02:22.130
And people always want a consistent UI for
their checkboxes.

43
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.625
So they take spans, or
something like that, or list items, and

44
00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:28.950
they start making them look,
visually, like checkboxes.

45
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.597
But you're missing out on so
much contextual information about what's

46
00:02:32.597 --> 00:02:36.240
related to what, and descriptions,
and how to interact with them, and

47
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.428
all these different things,
they get really, really rough.

48
00:02:39.428 --> 00:02:43.546
I've done quite a few audits on some
popular libraries out there I'm like, you

49
00:02:43.546 --> 00:02:47.270
don't have any like of this functionality,
it's not just a visual thing.

50
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.030
You need to be able to
make the spacebar work,

51
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.440
you need to be able to
navigate it correctly.

52
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.508
And then the same with images, I always
think it's a cool pretty easy one if

53
00:02:55.508 --> 00:03:00.045
you're uploading it yourself to give good
names to the images, and then alt text.

54
00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:03.227
I mean, alt text definitely have some
alt attribute even if it's blank but

55
00:03:03.227 --> 00:03:04.894
I also think it's a nice little thing,

56
00:03:04.894 --> 00:03:07.390
naming your image appropriately
can go a long way as well.

57
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.435
This is not always possible with
user generated stuff, right?

58
00:03:11.435 --> 00:03:12.093
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I have a question.

59
00:03:12.093 --> 00:03:13.140
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah?

60
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Speaking of your own

61
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.990
components that comes with web components
that's were not coming some time

62
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:27.010
in the future, what are the things that
people are trying to accomplish like

63
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.652
W3 with web components and accessibility?
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yes, I think a couple of

64
00:03:30.652 --> 00:03:34.980
things like web components have some great
potential for being very accessible.

65
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.810
But I think the big thing is like web
components are built on top of the regular

66
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.190
HTML elements, right?

67
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.150
So, if you have a Google Maps' web
component, that's fine as long

68
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.330
as it makes the correct choice like
if there's buttons at the bottom.

69
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.300
You know what I mean, the lower down ones
are where you get into some trouble.

70
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.870
But I think web components
can be cool because

71
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.950
having many eyes on it like
an open source project.

72
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.282
You know what I mean, so if you fix the
one Google Maps' component that everybody

73
00:04:05.282 --> 00:04:08.866
uses or whatever, that can be great
as far as accessibility goes.

74
00:04:08.866 --> 00:04:12.201
It does have some potential downsides
where you don't have a lot of insight into

75
00:04:12.201 --> 00:04:15.780
what's going on right away, you're
just importing something and using it.

76
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.620
But I feel positively about them, I think
as long as they each are responsible

77
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.040
with the core elements that they use
that it'll be great in that sense.

78
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.928
But yeah, there's a lot of,
we'll see stuff coming from web

79
00:04:27.928 --> 00:04:32.197
components.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Cool, and

80
00:04:32.197 --> 00:04:33.576
then this is great.

81
00:04:33.576 --> 00:04:36.480
We've been kinda drilling
on this a lot but

82
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.880
a lot of different elements
have inherited functionality.

83
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.690
And that's always the big worry like both
that a screen reader has less clues cuz

84
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.740
it know where the button is, it doesn't
necessarily know what class button does.

85
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.060
But also, there's so
many keyboard shortcuts and there's so

86
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.080
many screen readers will get into it a
little bit, they have like different ways

87
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.290
of viewing all the contents, so you can
be like organize by the headings or

88
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.280
organize by tabbable elements,
things like that.

89
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.700
So even if you kind of go really far and
make the functionality work,

90
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.360
it still might not register on that
nice list of form elements if it's not

91
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.008
a button, if it's not an input,
things like that.

92
00:05:11.008 --> 00:05:15.772
So webAIM and the spec which are both at
the end, they have like a really great

93
00:05:15.772 --> 00:05:20.090
list of elements that have inherited
functionality and what it is.

94
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.262
So, if you have to go out of your way and
rebuild something,

95
00:05:23.262 --> 00:05:26.951
at least check that list to make
sure that you're on the right track.

96
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.288
So, yeah, this is cool,
if you're using voiceover,

97
00:05:29.288 --> 00:05:32.960
this is a cool view that it has
that has all the different headers.

98
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.794
So you can with voiceover on,
hit option + ctrl + u, and

99
00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:39.154
it's just a different way
of parsing a website.

100
00:05:39.154 --> 00:05:41.350
So like one thought exercise I guess is,

101
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.470
you've got this screen reader
that you've now used, and

102
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.220
when you hit a website it kind of just
starts reading you what's on the website.

103
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.708
But imagine something like wikipedia.com,
how terrible it would be to just hit it

104
00:05:51.708 --> 00:05:55.122
and have it read ten hours worth
of all the different articles.

105
00:05:55.122 --> 00:05:58.090
So a cool view is,
you can go into the headers view and

106
00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.570
you can just see what the top level,
secondary, tertiary elements are.

107
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.730
But it brings up another potential
pitfall for accessibility,

108
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.200
which is using the wrong heading for
the wrong place.

109
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.613
So the headings are very important for
accessibility,

110
00:06:12.613 --> 00:06:17.704
indicating the importance in your content
hierarchy like is it H1, 2, 3, 4.

111
00:06:17.704 --> 00:06:21.340
But oftentimes for
design purposes it's like, it's our H1 but

112
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.550
we need it a little smaller so we'll
just make it an H3, something like that.

113
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.340
And it happens a ton of the time.

114
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.127
But then you've really throw off people,
like on a screen reader, who are,

115
00:06:32.127 --> 00:06:34.880
they go for the H1 and
it has nothing to do with the page.

116
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.820
It's just the thing you wanted really big
like join our mailing list at the bottom

117
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.150
or whatever.

118
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.560
So again,
like use the appropriate element.

119
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.490
And totally resize it with CSS, that's
no problem to till give it a class and

120
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.340
make it tiny or big.

121
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.528
And I've seen some cool,

122
00:06:48.528 --> 00:06:54.403
some of the newer CSS frameworks
have a class of H1, H2, H3,H4.

123
00:06:54.403 --> 00:06:57.759
So then you can use the appropriate one
and then just give it an H3 class or

124
00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:00.370
something like that,
if you need it a little smaller.

125
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.570
But again, use CSS to make it smaller,
don't switch elements like,

126
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.970
use the semantic element.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Bootstrap ships with that

127
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.230
and SEO requests it all the time to

128
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.270
have like an H1 not look like an H1.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, totally good.

129
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.230
Give it a class, change it up in the CSS.

130
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.333
But, if you change the actual elements
around, you'll get these really confusing

131
00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:24.586
sites that are like, this site is
about joining our mailing list.

132
00:07:24.586 --> 00:07:28.065
And then the second thing
is welcome to the homepage.

133
00:07:28.065 --> 00:07:30.950
Or you're really trying to traverse it,
so yeah.

134
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:31.700
Another important one.
