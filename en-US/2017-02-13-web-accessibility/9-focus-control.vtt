&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Focus control, so

2
00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:06.280
there's this really cool attribute
called document.activeElement.

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.100
And you can run that at any time
in your console or whatever and

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.920
you can get what the currently
focused element is on the page.

5
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.708
So as users tabbing through or whatever,

6
00:00:14.708 --> 00:00:19.250
you can use document.activeElement and
see where you're at.

7
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.100
Okay, so before I go to the next slide,
what's really cool with this is like,

8
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.950
the probably most common use case
is when you're doing modals.

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.300
So I worked on some code at Twitter where
you're scrolling through the timeline of

10
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.760
tweets, and
say you're doing it with a keyboard.

11
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.270
And then, so

12
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.830
you're on the 30th tweet down, and
then you're like, I wanna see that one.

13
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.130
And you hit enter on it, and

14
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.830
it brings up this modal of a close-up
of that tweet or whatever.

15
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.986
And you're like,
that was really cool, and so

16
00:00:43.986 --> 00:00:46.099
then maybe you hit escape
to close that thing away.

17
00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:48.904
And then you hit your next tweet and
it starts you back at the top and

18
00:00:48.904 --> 00:00:50.137
you're like what the heck?

19
00:00:50.137 --> 00:00:52.640
Like I was,
I don't know I was like 30 tweets down.

20
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.672
So like getting in that mind set,
a really cool way you can use

21
00:00:55.672 --> 00:00:59.840
document.activeElement is when a user's
about to do something like pop up a modal

22
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.240
or pop down an accordion,
anything like that.

23
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.085
You can save where they currently are.

24
00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:08.904
And then when they're done with that, you
can just call .focus on currentElement and

25
00:01:08.904 --> 00:01:11.014
it will take them right
back to where they were.

26
00:01:11.014 --> 00:01:14.099
So another, it's like two lines a code,
one to store it and

27
00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:16.027
one to .focus on it when they close.

28
00:01:16.027 --> 00:01:19.169
That can make a huge difference for users.
