&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So yeah,
the next exercise is just a quick one.

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.740
And this I think would be,
I have an example for

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.930
it of there's the Semantic HTML page,
which is just not using Semantic HTML.

4
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.150
So, it's just looking at the website and
you can use your screen reader if you want

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.460
to listen to how it's interpreted and
change it that way, or

6
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.870
just look at the code and just try to
figure out, are the headings correct?

7
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.110
Are we using the right tags?

8
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.250
Different things like that.

9
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.792
But I also think this one works really
well to go out if you have a personal

10
00:00:27.792 --> 00:00:31.869
project or a company project or whatever
and serious kinda start thinking about,

11
00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.757
are you using divs all over the place,

12
00:00:33.757 --> 00:00:37.032
how are your headings,
how are your different things like that?

13
00:00:37.032 --> 00:00:39.187
So yeah,
it should be pretty straightforward.

14
00:00:39.187 --> 00:00:41.886
Just, yeah,
just going over looking at ARIA roles and

15
00:00:41.886 --> 00:00:45.650
looking at the elements and making
sure that they're the appropriate one.
