WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So
we implemented talking about menus,

2
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.980
and in particular, keyboard navigation.

3
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.715
So if you go to starbucks.com and
you begin to tab into the interface

4
00:00:12.715 --> 00:00:16.251
where you begin to highlight-
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Look at that skip link,

5
00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:17.599
everybody.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.

6
00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:18.922
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: There's two,

7
00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:20.999
skip to navigation,
skip to main content, that's awesome.

8
00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.039
Skip to footer.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: All right, if you head into

9
00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.910
highlight coffee or tea, and if you
hit the Enter key, it should open it.

10
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.800
And then as you hit Tab,
it will begin to navigate through.

11
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.000
But if you hit Escape,
it will pull you out of it,

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.409
so you can continue along.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah,

13
00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:38.729
this is a great example,
this is what I was trying to say.

14
00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:41.106
So yeah, by default,
it will hide all those children, so

15
00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:43.104
you can tab through like normal,
this is great.

16
00:00:43.104 --> 00:00:47.810
And then you hit Enter and it changes that
focus and now you're tabbing through here.

17
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.693
This is a really great example, and
then I can hit Escape and go back,

18
00:00:50.693 --> 00:00:57.820
that's awesome.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I like seeing these,

19
00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.760
it's always fun.

20
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.760
I never knew skip links were a thing until
I started doing accessibility work, and

21
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.610
now I see them all over.

22
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.186
I'm like, skip link, that's great.

23
00:01:04.186 --> 00:01:07.400
[LAUGH] They're cool.
