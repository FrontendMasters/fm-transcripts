00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.880
&gt;&gt; John: And
one of the most exciting things,

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.900
when I started getting into accessibility,

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.340
was getting to check out all
the different ways users browse the web.

4
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.790
And I think most of us have been,
since we got started with computers,

5
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.820
on this very standard,
maybe a mouse and a keyboard.

6
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.310
And you use the mouse for all your
precision stuff, and your keyboard for

7
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.880
data entry, and that's all we've
known as far as browsing the web.

8
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.830
But there's actually a lot of different
ways, and it's a real diversity of ways.

9
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.850
There's a lot of people using
a lot of different ways.

10
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.450
So here are some of the ones that I think
are most common and most interesting.

11
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.020
There's a lot of keyboard-only users.

12
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.050
One thing that we see very often is
people with any kind of motor disability

13
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.130
have a difficult time using a mouse and

14
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.501
just have a much easier time with the
keyboard, with hitting buttons at a time.

15
00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:50.865
So again,
trying to ingrain the takeaways here is,

16
00:00:50.865 --> 00:00:54.694
do you have a site that can be
used entirely with a keyboard?

17
00:00:54.694 --> 00:00:58.980
Do you have anywhere that you
absolutely requires a mouse or no?

18
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.170
And this includes signing up for

19
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.720
a new account, logging in, checking out
on a shopping cart, things like that.

20
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.260
People use head wands and mouth sticks.

21
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.501
These are pretty similar devices,
one goes in-between your mouth and

22
00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:11.804
one goes on top of your head.

23
00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:16.683
Again, its the same as a finger for
tapping, but again, less precision.

24
00:01:16.683 --> 00:01:19.931
So again, things like bigger click
targets spacing around them,

25
00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:22.710
things like that would help a lot here.

26
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.050
A single switch, this is, I think,
one of the coolest pieces of technology.

27
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.940
So a single switch,
it really is just one button.

28
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.020
There's no other way to hit it or
hold it, anything like that.

29
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.554
And so what you can do is if you imagine,
like on your computer with those virtual

30
00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:39.637
keyboards that you can come up,
and you can click on.

31
00:01:39.637 --> 00:01:42.770
So you would hit the single switch, and
the virtual keyboard would come up, and

32
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.180
it would start going through
rows of the keyboard.

33
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.630
So the F keys the number keys, the Q.

34
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.290
Anyway, when you get to the row that you
want, you hit the single switch again,

35
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.240
and it switches into column mode, and then
you can go through the column mode, and so

36
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.350
between row and column,
you can get the precision of a single key.

37
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.830
So the big one here is, let's say
we've all done some awesome work, and

38
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.050
we have keyboard-only great
workflow on our site.

39
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.610
Is there any way we can
make it a little faster?

40
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.400
f you have a sign-up form at the bottom
of your site, do users have to tab all

41
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.080
the way through your entire website
to get to the sign-up form?

42
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.370
Things like that, and we're gonna cover
some really good ways of doing that.

43
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.840
And then probably,
the biggest one are screen readers.

44
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.320
So screen readers are a completely
non-visual way of viewing websites.

45
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.020
So it's a piece of software
that sits on your computer,

46
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.110
your phone, in your browser.

47
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.890
And it basically parses all
of the content of the site,

48
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.860
and it starts reading it out to the user.

49
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.010
The user can typically use the keyboard
to them, cycle through options.

50
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.760
So there you keyboard in,
and then it's audio out.

51
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.030
So again, making sure, does your
site read nicely on a screen reader.

52
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.929
And we're gonna talk about
specifics as we go forward.
