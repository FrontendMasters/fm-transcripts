1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.990
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So,
how is the third exercise?

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.100
I heard some productive sounding chatter,
and

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.530
some Alex the screen reader voice
reading out over some people.

4
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.530
So that's awesome.

5
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.220
So yeah,
I guess we'll go over it real quick.

6
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.730
This one when you get into the screen
reader the stuff is kind of fun but

7
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.540
there's also like a lot
that could be done.

8
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.170
So I think we're just gonna take
the first pass over making it usable.

9
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.115
But there are a lot things, and we kinda
talked about some really good points

10
00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:31.531
before we broke for
break about described by.

11
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:36.000
And all the different ways you can use
labels to make forms really awesome.

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.100
But I think for
now we're just gonna make it usable.

13
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.487
&gt;&gt; Digital Voice: Reload this page,
screen reader's web content.

14
00:00:42.487 --> 00:00:44.050
You're currently on web content,

15
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.150
to enter the web area press
Ctrl+Option+Shift+down arrow.

16
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.162
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Cool so
this is a voice over.

17
00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:54.068
And so basically there's a couple
ways you can get started.

18
00:00:54.068 --> 00:00:58.379
One of the easy ways is just using
the website like you regularly would.

19
00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.400
So I can just hit Tab to see
what I can interact with.

20
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.420
&gt;&gt; Digital Voice: Visited
link back list one item.

21
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.533
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So
I see a back button and

22
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:10.882
then we get into the really
useless stuff right.

23
00:01:10.882 --> 00:01:14.233
Which is like, even though this form
looks great with these paragraph tags and

24
00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:15.320
things like that.

25
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.740
When you actually are using the screen
reader, it literally gives you no.

26
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.910
It just says edit text, blank.

27
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.850
&gt;&gt; Digital Voice: Edit text blank.

28
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.230
You are currently on edit text blank.

29
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.000
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: And so you can just kinda
tell right away, if you can't see then

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.810
this form is completely,
you can't figure this form out.

31
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.124
I mean the only real option you'd have
it you could send it into a mode where

32
00:01:36.124 --> 00:01:37.150
it reads everything.

33
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.740
And then you can try
to remember the order.

34
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.343
And be like okay, there were four inputs
that I heard and they were name, email.

35
00:01:42.343 --> 00:01:43.260
You know what I mean?
Things like that.

36
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.850
But you're really putting a lot of
pain on your user at that point.

37
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.580
And then similarly with the.

38
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.388
&gt;&gt; Digital Voice: Edit text.

39
00:01:49.388 --> 00:01:51.006
Daily menu item.

40
00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:52.095
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: WIth [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Digital Voice: Pop up button

41
00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:52.834
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: With the select,

42
00:01:52.834 --> 00:01:55.990
since it doesn't have a label it
doesn't really tell you what it is.

43
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.330
I mean, you have no context.

44
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.263
Daily what?

45
00:01:58.263 --> 00:02:00.827
I mean, it says it's on select and
you're on daily.

46
00:02:00.827 --> 00:02:03.369
I think you can just pretty easily
imagine the frustration of trying to

47
00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:03.935
fill this out.

48
00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:05.667
And especially like I mean, you know,

49
00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.302
I've just been doing
the accessibility stuff for a while.

50
00:02:08.302 --> 00:02:10.884
And I just like hear these stories about.

51
00:02:10.884 --> 00:02:14.816
You know what I mean stuff that people
are trying to like make a purchase or

52
00:02:14.816 --> 00:02:18.046
trying to like sign up for
a service or something like that.

53
00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:21.934
And like, you know not having
that stuff is like, it's hard for

54
00:02:21.934 --> 00:02:25.822
me to imagine going online to sign up for
Netflix or something and

55
00:02:25.822 --> 00:02:28.560
it being literally impossible for
me to get.

56
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.140
You know it's that frustration,
is like is a lot.

57
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.290
So we can fix a lot of
these pretty simply.

58
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.310
We go ahead and
turn voice over off for now.

59
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.396
So basically if we go into the code and we
go into the screen reader index dot html.

60
00:02:44.396 --> 00:02:45.668
I'm gonna go ahead and hide this.

61
00:02:45.668 --> 00:02:50.588
The first big thing that I would do on my
paths is I would just turn these paragraph

62
00:02:50.588 --> 00:02:53.980
tags into labels for
their appropriate form control.

63
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.428
So you can just give
each label like an ID.

64
00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:01.591
And then you can turn these
paragraphs into like label four,

65
00:03:01.591 --> 00:03:02.840
whatever that idea is.

66
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.230
And so even if we just do this one
example, label for email, email address.

67
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.323
And then if we went back over here and
turn the screen reader on again.

68
00:03:14.323 --> 00:03:17.273
&gt;&gt; Digital Voice: Content visited
email address, edit text.

69
00:03:17.273 --> 00:03:18.397
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: It's just so
much better, right?

70
00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:22.428
It's telling you that it's
an email address, edit some text.

71
00:03:22.428 --> 00:03:24.260
So we can go ahead and
we could do that for all of them.

72
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.808
So we can go ahead id = name.

73
00:03:29.808 --> 00:03:34.778
And this is a pretty quick pass
through all this stuff label for

74
00:03:34.778 --> 00:03:38.110
name, something like that, cool.

75
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.090
And then how often would
you like to receive email.

76
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.546
This is like probably one of the big
ones because it was just not,

77
00:03:43.546 --> 00:03:47.965
not telling you what it was frequency I
think I called it, or something like that.

78
00:03:47.965 --> 00:03:51.273
Label for frequency.

79
00:03:51.273 --> 00:03:52.060
Cool.

80
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.704
So we can do some stuff like this and

81
00:03:53.704 --> 00:03:56.276
then basically now if we go
back to it with it unmuted.

82
00:03:56.276 --> 00:03:57.580
&gt;&gt; Digital Voice: You
have reloaded this page.

83
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.189
Screen visited.

84
00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:59.460
Link, email address.

85
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.116
Edit first and last name, edit text,
daily, menu item, edit text daily.

86
00:04:03.116 --> 00:04:04.806
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Something's wrong here,
hold on.

87
00:04:04.806 --> 00:04:07.455
&gt;&gt; Digital Voice: You are currently
on a pop up button, inside muting.

88
00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:09.553
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: All right I might have
to, I'll look into that one offline.

89
00:04:09.553 --> 00:04:13.274
But basically we're just gonna do is
I'm not sure what's going on with it.

90
00:04:13.274 --> 00:04:17.830
But we'll add ID's to these form elements
and then we'll add labels for them.

91
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.403
I've got something going wrong here but
basically we'll do that.

92
00:04:23.403 --> 00:04:27.470
The other thing that you'll need,
this is pretty contrived.

93
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.719
But it says what is in the above pictures.

94
00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:32.320
So there's a couple different
things we could do here.

95
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.350
The first thing that we wanna
do is like we mentioned,

96
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.100
we'll go up to that image and
we'll just add some alt text to it.

97
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.660
That you could just say like cats,
or for cats, or something like that.

98
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.980
So at least when you're reading
the whole document you'll get there.

99
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.980
There's some other cools
stuff that you could do.

100
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.300
Again, getting kind of subjective
you could use some of that ARIA,

101
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.310
describe by or label by stuff.

102
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.030
To like kinda connect to that
security question with the image.

103
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.910
So you could say like
you get the image ID.

104
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.873
You can could say
the described by that thing.

105
00:05:01.873 --> 00:05:03.240
And you can start making these.

106
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.440
I mean, that really up to you like just
trying to visualize a workflow and

107
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.490
just kind of sticking labels and
descriptions on stuff.

108
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.820
But that might be a cool way to
go through it as like to be like,

109
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.850
what's the security image above image
of cats or something like that.

110
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.839
However you'd like to do it.

111
00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:20.060
You know, might be nice.

112
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.198
I wanted to do a little bit more on
security because one of the big.

113
00:05:24.198 --> 00:05:27.038
I'm trying to like keep like
a little bit of a running

114
00:05:27.038 --> 00:05:30.150
list of like the big accessibility
problems that we see.

115
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.330
So like one of the big ones is like,
we did the divs with the class of button,

116
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.800
that's a very common one that you see.

117
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.570
Another one is alt text for images,
another common one you see.

118
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.940
A third one which is really
important is CAPTCHA's are often

119
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.920
a big stopping point for
people with a number of disabilities.

120
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.320
The big thing behind CAPTCHA's they just
really don't do anything good for you.

121
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.040
They don't really prevent
all that much spam.

122
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.300
They're really easy to hack and
they often don't,

123
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.910
even if they offer some
kind of audio replacement.

124
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.710
It's often not accurate enough.

125
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.330
Often the numbers you
need to enter won't be.

126
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.270
Or oftentimes they'll put distortion
in the background of the audio as well.

127
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.720
There big blocking points.

128
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.100
So if you have a website and
it has some kind of CAPTCHA on it,

129
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.770
I think it would just be worth
considering, like can you remove it.

130
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.550
Can you find another way of preventing
spam without preventing legitimate users.

131
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.060
So this is like a very contrived,
this isn't a real CAPTCHA.

132
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.135
But I did want to make a point,
a special point for

133
00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:30.066
CAPTCHAs because I think a lot
of people struggle with them.

134
00:06:30.066 --> 00:06:31.098
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I have
a question before you move on.

135
00:06:31.098 --> 00:06:31.794
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah.

136
00:06:31.794 --> 00:06:33.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I just going
back to the screen reader,

137
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.024
because I tried to just turn
my screen down to use it.

138
00:06:36.024 --> 00:06:37.245
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah.

139
00:06:37.245 --> 00:06:41.223
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So when you go to the select
thing is there a way to get it to read you

140
00:06:41.223 --> 00:06:42.567
all the selections?

141
00:06:42.567 --> 00:06:43.898
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, so-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The only way,

142
00:06:43.898 --> 00:06:46.137
I figured it was like you
just hit down arrow and

143
00:06:46.137 --> 00:06:49.940
then when you select it tells you what it
was but it wasn't like it gave you the.

144
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It does tell you
how many options there are?

145
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.940
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah so I think by
default the select will tell you that its

146
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.360
a drop down and
how many options there are in it.

147
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.491
As far as reading all of them.

148
00:07:00.491 --> 00:07:04.270
I'm trying to think,
Jack do you have a suggestion on that?

149
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.940
So with selects they'll tell you how many
items are going to be inside the select.

150
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.157
Is there a way to get, I mean I can
think of a way with like labeling and

151
00:07:12.157 --> 00:07:14.262
putting all the options int he label for
it.

152
00:07:14.262 --> 00:07:17.530
Like this is a drop down with these
choices but that's like duplication.

153
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.155
Is there a way to read you all of
the options so you don't have to.

154
00:07:22.155 --> 00:07:25.152
&gt;&gt; Jack: Not that I can recall-
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So

155
00:07:25.152 --> 00:07:28.506
one thing I've seen down before
with any templating languages

156
00:07:28.506 --> 00:07:32.950
is you'll just use the same list of, the
list that you populate those select with.

157
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.430
You'll also populate the label with or
a described by.

158
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.090
So that will get you there even though
it is a little bit of duplication.

159
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.272
I think that would probably
be the best thing to do.

160
00:07:40.272 --> 00:07:41.955
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Well I mean
if you're using code to-

161
00:07:41.955 --> 00:07:43.403
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Well, right, yeah.

162
00:07:43.403 --> 00:07:44.247
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Discription.

163
00:07:44.247 --> 00:07:46.777
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: But if you're just using
HTML then it would just be like a direct

164
00:07:46.777 --> 00:07:49.090
copy and paste, but
that would be a nice thing for users.

165
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.570
So maybe an ARIA described by, and

166
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.990
then you'd have all of them
in there something like that.

167
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.130
Something like that.

168
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And the other thing is
when you type in like to fill itself.

169
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.190
It's trying to read it
to you as you type but

170
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.670
is there a way to get it to just like say,
I wanna read what I typed.

171
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:05.870
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, so

172
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.550
the next example that we're gonna do
is covering a little bit of that stuff.

173
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.280
So there's this concept of
like ARIA Live Regions.

174
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.000
And some different things which
is like how the screen reader

175
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.850
can react to things changing.

176
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.920
So there's some cool stuff
you can do in there,

177
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.530
and we have an example that's pretty
similar to that for our next one.

178
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:27.576
But yeah, it's like, this is where
I try to it's kind of endless.

179
00:08:27.576 --> 00:08:28.810
Just all the cool stuff you can do.

180
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.810
So yeah, that is definitely a big thing.

181
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.216
When should the screen, now that you have
a screen-reader communicating with a user,

182
00:08:36.216 --> 00:08:37.327
when should it update them?

183
00:08:37.327 --> 00:08:40.845
Every character that they type or
only when a time out has exceeded,

184
00:08:40.845 --> 00:08:42.399
different things like that.

185
00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:45.014
And it gets back into, somebody had
a great question about form validation.

186
00:08:45.014 --> 00:08:49.186
Which is another kind of big topic where
you cover like when does it validate.

187
00:08:49.186 --> 00:08:52.994
And how often does it announce to the user
if something's invalid or if it's,

188
00:08:52.994 --> 00:08:55.140
you know what I mean you
kinda get into this.

189
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.186
So yeah, when we do our live
regions in the next there's funny,

190
00:08:59.186 --> 00:09:01.670
their modes are like assertive and polite.

191
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:06.410
So you can control different things like,
should you wait

192
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.230
until the screen loader is done saying
its current thing and then let you know?

193
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.370
Or should it kind of take precedence and
interrupt that something's changed?

194
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.440
&gt;&gt; Jack: I think the best way you can
make decisions around that, to be honest,

195
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.600
is just implement something and
turn it on and try it.

196
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:26.390
Because you're gonna hear very quickly
if it's just a bunch of garbage or not.

197
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.160
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, and

198
00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.230
I think the more stuff you have
going on the worse it can get.

199
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:35.464
But yeah, I think the best thing
to do with all these nice,

200
00:09:35.464 --> 00:09:39.163
free screen readers is just have
someone in QA, or the developer.

201
00:09:39.163 --> 00:09:42.858
Or somebody just try filling out that
form or living on your app for a minute.

202
00:09:42.858 --> 00:09:45.195
And see if it's like everybody yelling or

203
00:09:45.195 --> 00:09:47.676
if it's just a pretty
easy to follow thing.

204
00:09:47.676 --> 00:09:53.688
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Beyond all caps or not, is
there a way to suggest pronunciations for

205
00:09:53.688 --> 00:09:56.575
like weird words or-
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I don't know,

206
00:09:56.575 --> 00:09:58.590
that's a really good question.

207
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Another thing I-
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Made up words, right?

208
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.967
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Right.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: How would you pronounce

209
00:10:01.967 --> 00:10:03.905
your company name or something if it was.

210
00:10:03.905 --> 00:10:08.684
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: I think something as
simple as times I've been working with

211
00:10:08.684 --> 00:10:13.210
a lot lately,
if you all caps the AM PM that helps.

212
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.680
But it seems of read out
individual digits sometimes,

213
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.950
which to me is not very user friendly.

214
00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.864
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So
some of that stuff you could do,

215
00:10:22.864 --> 00:10:25.706
since the labels
are essentially kind of strings.

216
00:10:25.706 --> 00:10:29.826
I mean you could do some of that with
a JavaScript library could format it.

217
00:10:29.826 --> 00:10:33.240
And then you could take that timestamp,
and you could pass it through moment.js or

218
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:33.741
whatever.

219
00:10:33.741 --> 00:10:37.600
And you can control how you read aloud,
so you can say like.

220
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.670
February 22nd 1 a you know right,
you can change it into words, basically.

221
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.070
As far as pronunciation,
it's a really good question.

222
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.200
I don't know of anything.

223
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: So
I mean there's kind of two camps.

224
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:53.890
Some folks have tried to for example,
if it's going to be something,

225
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:57.930
that would only specifically be read
by a screen reader provide a phonetic.

226
00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:58.690
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Right.

227
00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:03.653
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Spelling, but feedback that
we've also gotten from the disabilities

228
00:11:03.653 --> 00:11:07.870
community is most people that
have been using screen readers

229
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:12.513
are used to the mispronunciation so
they're like don't bother.

230
00:11:12.513 --> 00:11:15.289
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, I've seen the
phonetic thing I think before where you

231
00:11:15.289 --> 00:11:18.726
know you'd have a label that was like,
kind of reminds of back in the days.

232
00:11:18.726 --> 00:11:22.389
Where that Mac to speech program, but
you'd try to get it to say your words so

233
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:23.084
you'd like.

234
00:11:23.084 --> 00:11:27.215
But yeah, I do agree that I think for
company names and things like that,

235
00:11:27.215 --> 00:11:31.500
I think a lot of people are if it says
Twitter they know what it's going for.

236
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.500
But that's a really good question.

237
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.370
There's also, I wonder, so they tie into
the voices that your operating system has.

238
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.500
And I actually am now
wondering a little bit if,

239
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.400
cuz some of the voices are accented.

240
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.920
You can get British voices or

241
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.710
I'm wondering a little bit if there's
some cool stuff you can do in there.

242
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.930
But yeah,
I haven't really done anything like that.

243
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.510
But it's a really good question.

244
00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: I think the one thing
Like trying to do phonetic stuff,

245
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.640
is that,
becomes really hard to maintain over time.

246
00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.386
That's another reason to
just not go down that road.

247
00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:02.985
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Trust that
technology that will better.

248
00:12:02.985 --> 00:12:04.602
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, I mean,

249
00:12:04.602 --> 00:12:06.430
I think that's a really good call.

250
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.660
I think that I don't know,
I think that would be really cool.

251
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.589
I thing it would be
really cool to mess with.

252
00:12:11.589 --> 00:12:15.814
But I do think that for those that use
templating languages it's always nice if

253
00:12:15.814 --> 00:12:18.577
you can make your labels
out of the same variables.

254
00:12:18.577 --> 00:12:22.310
That your place holder or your,
you know what I mean those kind of things.

255
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:26.280
Which that would get a lot more complex
if you had a phonetic spelling as well.

256
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.480
That's a really good question.

257
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.990
Cool, so yeah, basic idea there is just.

258
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.240
And I really think,
I just can't say enough for

259
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.100
actually turning on a screen reader and
running through your site.

260
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:46.430
I mean, I heard a few people like my
goodness I can't hear what's going on.

261
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.400
And just thinking about you
make this really gorgeous,

262
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.460
nice thing that is a joy to use.

263
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:56.630
And then you take a significant chunk of
the population and you don't make it so

264
00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:57.630
it works for them.

265
00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.990
It's just kind of a weird
reality that we live in.

266
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.130
So I think that's really important,
really cool.

267
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.740
And there are really, if you get some
bandwidth to play with stuff you can

268
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.180
really make the experience great.

269
00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.440
Like I was talking about before with your
security question could like tie itself to

270
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.360
the actual picture, with the described
by so it reads it right after.

271
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.608
You can do some like
really nice things there.

272
00:13:16.608 --> 00:13:18.214
But yeah I can't just
really say enough for

273
00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:19.820
actually like get on the screen reader.

274
00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:24.320
Put your headphones on and
like try to use your website, cool.
