00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.310
&gt;&gt; Jon: So
the basics of keyboard navigation.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.640
We've talked about that we should
have keyboard navigation, but

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.470
we haven't really talked
about how that works.

4
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.750
And so it basically all comes down to
the Tab key, and tabbable elements.

5
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.980
So the basic concept is
that on any website,

6
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.640
hitting the Tab key will move you
forward one item, one tabbable item.

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.200
This works on all websites.

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.370
And then hitting shift and the tab
key will move you backward one item.

9
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.224
So you can kind of tab,
tab tab, shift tab, shift tab.

10
00:00:28.224 --> 00:00:31.860
And that's the way a lot of people
are going to be going through your site.

11
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.720
For those wondering what tabable
elements are, the most popular ones.

12
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.230
There's a longer list which we'll get
to in one of the exercises are anchors,

13
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.360
buttons, any type of input or select,
text areas, and then iframes.

14
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.070
And so what we're kinda talking about here
is if you have let's say a basic site and

15
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.480
you've got a a div, that's not gonna
be tabable, then you got a UL,

16
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.950
not tabable, and then inside those
list items maybe you have anchors,

17
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.440
those are going to be
your first tabable items.

18
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.970
And then maybe later on,
you've got a form or something like that.

19
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.490
And so I didn't mean to kind of start
thinking about the idea here is that,

20
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.670
especially like was mentioned earlier.

21
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.270
Websites have a ton of mark up.

22
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.655
So you wouldn't want every element to
be because then you'd be tabbing for

23
00:01:14.655 --> 00:01:20.015
hours, so the presentational items,
like div, span, things like that,

24
00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:23.445
they don't get to be tabbable by default,
cuz there's no real purpose there, but

25
00:01:23.445 --> 00:01:26.365
the stuff that you would interact with,
like a link that you would click, or

26
00:01:26.365 --> 00:01:29.585
an input where you would enter some data,
those come tabbable, so

27
00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:32.595
it's just kind of a way anything
that you would be interacting with

28
00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:34.035
comes tabbable by default.

29
00:01:34.035 --> 00:01:37.175
And this starts to play into what we were
talking about earlier with that comment

30
00:01:37.175 --> 00:01:41.110
about using the correct mark-up for
correct things.

31
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.150
So I was a little careful with my words,
saying things like divs and

32
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.680
spins aren't tabable by default,
which is true.

33
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.620
But any item can be either made tabable or
not tabable by the users.

34
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.480
Or by developers rather.

35
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.410
And so the idea here is that there's
this HMO property called Tabindex and

36
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.510
so you can take something like this
div which says I'm focusable but

37
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.170
by default would not be focusable right so
it's a div.

38
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.080
And you can add tabindex 0, and
you'll refresh the page, and

39
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.280
then as your tab aim through it'll
highlight that div as a focus for item.

40
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.600
So tabindex this is a lot of words, but

41
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.490
there's only three values
really that tabindex can take.

42
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.920
And like we see appear it's
just a HTML attribute.

43
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.720
Tabindex equals, so
it can take a negative value,

44
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.870
which means that it is focusable but
it can't be reached via tabbing around.

45
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.990
So this would be something that we
wanna call focused on with JavaScript.

46
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.570
So we want it focusable, we don't want
it part of the users tabbing through.

47
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.560
Give it a zero, and

48
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.980
it just turns into a focusable not
item wherever it falls on the HTML.

49
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.350
If you wanted a did kinda act like a link.

50
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.030
You can make it focusable with zero and

51
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.580
it'll get tabbed too
when it gets tabbed too.

52
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.670
Then a positive value, which I think is
kinda little bit often an anti-pattern.

53
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.910
It's kinda like z index.

54
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:05.430
Right?

55
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.550
It's making it tabable and

56
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.330
then you're kinda bumping it up,
like your bumping it up in order.

57
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.230
So the only places,
I've seen these used in cool ways for

58
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.070
advanced accessibility stuff.

59
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.190
So for example, on Twitter, when you go
to Twitter with a screen reader on and

60
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.840
you hit Tab for your first movement,

61
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.140
it starts reading you this thing
that's not visually there on the site.

62
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.120
It's like hey,

63
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.700
we have some keyboard shortcuts hit
question mark if you wanna check them out.

64
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.660
And so how that's achieved is that
there's this you know div or a span and

65
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.890
it's like stuck in the document somewhere
and it's given that really high tab index.

66
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.950
So, it's the first thing that gets tab to.

67
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.280
So, that's kind of like
an intentional use of it, where you

68
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.070
have a visually hidden div that's trying
to communicate with screen reader users.

69
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.290
But other than that, you should probably
let things fall in their tap border.

70
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.750
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So does it go the highest
value first and then on down?

71
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.640
&gt;&gt; Jon: Yeah, yep.

72
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.910
So yeah, it's kinda and then there's
a couple places it's an empty pattern one

73
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.870
of them is like trying to be pushy with
screen readers like screen readers

74
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.880
are good and often times you should
just kinda let them sort things out but

75
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.010
also you kinda get into
similar z index battles over.

76
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.260
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Another comment again

77
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.290
from Jack.

78
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.190
John spoke to items being focused of all

79
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.470
by default browsers
show focused indicator.

80
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.430
Think of a colored rectangle,
many CSS resets 0 out that styling so,

81
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.140
the developer, you may need to add back
to style the show the focus indicator.

82
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.630
&gt;&gt; Jon: Yep, definitely, yeah we've got a
couple slides devoted to focus for items.

83
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.810
But it's one of the WebAIM checklist items
that we're gonna check over is that making

84
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.490
sure users have a visual cue to where
they're at with focusable items.

85
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.290
So, if you think about a form and

86
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.880
a keyboard only user and there's 20 inputs
and they're tabbing through all of them.

87
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.210
They should be able to look,
you should be able to look at any time and

88
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.145
be able to see which one you're at.

89
00:05:00.145 --> 00:05:05.825
By default, Chrome has that blue
focus ring around index items.

90
00:05:05.825 --> 00:05:10.405
But, yes a lot of times frameworks or
resets remove that because they,

91
00:05:10.405 --> 00:05:15.907
the design wants that and that can be
a big, a big no no for accessibility.

92
00:05:15.907 --> 00:05:18.497
Does that make sense
though on tabindex though?

93
00:05:18.497 --> 00:05:22.597
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Question about
negative value, so it's focuable but

94
00:05:22.597 --> 00:05:24.887
not sequentially how do
you typically get to it?

95
00:05:24.887 --> 00:05:27.397
&gt;&gt; Jon: You would use
JavaScript to focus on it.

96
00:05:27.397 --> 00:05:28.647
So, like say for example.

97
00:05:30.068 --> 00:05:33.718
You have like kind of a single page so
I have this great example and

98
00:05:33.718 --> 00:05:38.838
then Chrome patched the problem for but my
great example is a single page website so

99
00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:42.034
you click on links at the top and
it scrolls you to a view port down.

100
00:05:42.034 --> 00:05:46.124
So but, until recently, so if you would
click on it and you would scroll and

101
00:05:46.124 --> 00:05:47.594
down then you'd hit tab,

102
00:05:47.594 --> 00:05:51.944
probably what you'd want is to start
tubbing from the item but what happen is

103
00:05:51.944 --> 00:05:55.034
you would start tubbing from the top
of the document really frustrating.

104
00:05:55.034 --> 00:05:59.704
So, the thing you could do is to take the
titles for those single page websites and

105
00:05:59.704 --> 00:06:02.884
you could put a negative tab index
on them so you would never hit, but

106
00:06:02.884 --> 00:06:05.690
what you can do is when you have
a list and they're on the link, So

107
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.670
when the link clicks it moves, and
then it calls that focus on that header.

108
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.400
Something like that.

109
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.910
So now, you're focuses there, so if you
hit tab the focus will start there, and

110
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.050
keep moving, and things like that.

111
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.958
So, you have the negative one is
like saying, I'm gonna control this,

112
00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.816
like I don't want users
to hit it with tab, but

113
00:06:19.816 --> 00:06:21.736
it do need to be able to
call that focus on there.

114
00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:26.990
&gt;&gt; Jon: I thought this was really funny.

115
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.570
So on MDN, the maximum value in tab index
should not exceed 32,767 per the W3C.

116
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.750
I think if you get anywhere near there,
there's problems.

117
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:41.860
I think more common is people hitting
9999, trying to get the top precedence.

118
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.439
I just thought that was a funny note.
