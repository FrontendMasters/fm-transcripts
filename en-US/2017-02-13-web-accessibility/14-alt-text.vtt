00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.805
&gt;&gt; Jon: So
let's talk about screen readers and

2
00:00:01.805 --> 00:00:05.120
let's talk about the accessibility stuff
that's important with screen readers.

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.090
I think probably if you ask people
what they know like technically on

4
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.120
accessibility, the number one thing is
Alt Text for images that gets said.

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.910
Despite that, it's still one of like,
it's just something that I see everywhere.

6
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.620
That images don't have alt text,
so for those that don't know,

7
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.450
it's a property of the image element and
you can specify any string.

8
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:34.170
Inside this alt attribute and so
just to give a little kind of demo.

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.370
So, if this is your website and you just
have an image with an image source in it.

10
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.240
And you go, and you're tabbing through
the website or you focus on the image or

11
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.650
you're just using a screen reader
to read the whole website.

12
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.040
Essentially one of two
things is gonna happen,

13
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.610
most of the time it's
gonna tell you an image.

14
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.020
And seeing that there's no alt text,
it's gonna read the file name to you.

15
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.200
So it'll be like image gwash.jpg or
something like that.

16
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.700
And so what your users here is
gwash.jpg image, and the cool thing

17
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.020
with the screen readers is that they
do read to you, which is really nice.

18
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.850
But for this like where we're all together
if you don't have headphones they also

19
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.820
print at the bottom of the screen
everything that they're reading.

20
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.640
So you can just use them visually.

21
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.860
So then if we go ahead and we add
something like George Washington Portrait

22
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.010
and then you go back and
you refresh the page.

23
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.923
Now you get this really great amount of
context, George Washington Portrait and

24
00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:30.750
image.

25
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.770
And so these are just some examples.

26
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.430
I was doing a conference talking
accessibility a while ago.

27
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.240
So these three sites that are very
popular don't have alt text.

28
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.590
This is not actually up to date cuz
Twitter just added alt text as an option.

29
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.420
They don't have all text,

30
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.700
which makes sense because
they're user generated content.

31
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.750
But they also, for the sake of collisions,
they really hash their, like,

32
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.930
they make unique file names.

33
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.962
So just imagine being a user on a screen
reader, and getting one of these,

34
00:01:58.962 --> 00:02:04.583
you know, like 172428, and Facebook,
they're not even really images.

35
00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:08.865
They're like p to p files, that either
they do some stuff, you know, and

36
00:02:08.865 --> 00:02:11.020
Twitters are hashed.

37
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.970
So again, like keeping in mind freeze,
some stuff are really challenging because

38
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.350
if you have users
uploading their own images.

39
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.604
The best you can do is
you can kind of suggest,

40
00:02:20.604 --> 00:02:23.055
give them option to add alt
text which Twitter now does.

41
00:02:23.055 --> 00:02:26.572
It's behind an option settings but,
every time you upload an image,

42
00:02:26.572 --> 00:02:28.598
you can give an alternate text as well but

43
00:02:28.598 --> 00:02:31.690
just keep it in mind what that
experience might be like.

44
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.060
So the four rules of
writing good alt text.

45
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.650
Be accurate, be succinct, don't be
redundant, and don't use image of or

46
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.480
graphic of because that's
going to be taken care of.

47
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.019
That's like one of the big boo boos that
I see is like image of George Washington,

48
00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.384
image or something like that.

49
00:02:45.384 --> 00:02:48.070
It just falls into don't be redundant.

50
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.232
But anyway, so
these are the techniques and

51
00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:53.754
there's a link at the bottom
webaim.org/techniques/alttext/.

52
00:02:53.754 --> 00:02:56.493
They have a bunch of great
example of what could alt

53
00:02:56.493 --> 00:02:59.090
text.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You're supposed to cram

54
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.620
everything in for sco.
&gt;&gt; Jon: These are good points so

55
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.859
one of the worst things to
happen to accessibility is that.

56
00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.568
The field of SEO is trying to find
flaws in Google's algorithm and

57
00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:10.930
exploit them, right?

58
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.729
That's what you do when you're
doing search engine stuff.

59
00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:16.280
So people in Google launched
their Image Search.

60
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.742
Like Google was like,
cool we're gonna scrape the image and

61
00:03:18.742 --> 00:03:21.650
look at the alternate text if it's there,
which describes the image.

62
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.830
And we'll use that and so
then people are like this is the best,

63
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.210
you upload a million images of whatever.

64
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.160
But every time you upload an image
you put in Britney Spears or

65
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.760
free student loan reduction or
something like that.

66
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.410
And so then,
it became a super huge mess where and

67
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.390
still actively encouraging people to cram.

68
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.250
So, if you're writing a blog post on
like make money working from home and

69
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.640
you upload a picture that's like a lady
at the computer you're still for

70
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.810
SEO supposed to put in like make money
working from home easy free.jpg and

71
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.010
then and as the name and
then also as the alt tag.

72
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.880
It's like so bad.

73
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.900
And honestly it doesn't even
help all that much anymore,

74
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.100
because Google's kind of like plugged
that hole, but people still do it.

75
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.630
So yeah, think about your users,

76
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.440
not your search engine rankings,
and yes, don't cram it full of.

77
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.550
It kind of reminds me of the days when
you would put white text with a white

78
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.800
background with all your keywords in it,
that was like SEO, imagine that for

79
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.760
a screen reader.

80
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.320
They're like reading your blog posts and
of a sudden there's like.

81
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.810
Just a list of keywords for
like a mile, that's too bad.

82
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.330
Some interesting things,
if you're not going to have alt text and

83
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.550
you want to be nice to your users and
let them skip the element, skip the image

84
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.800
because there's nothing there, you can't
leave it without and alt attribute.

85
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.680
You need to give it an empty string for
the alt attribute.

86
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.940
So, an image with an empty
string just gets skipped.

87
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.670
So, this is great for user generated
content if you can't put it in,

88
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.500
at least put an empty string in there so
it gets skipped.

89
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.510
And then be careful
slash know to use this,

90
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.790
UPPERCASE words are gonna
be read letter by letter.

91
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.520
Capitalized and lowercase words are fine,
they'll be read as words.

92
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.030
But you know sometimes you want that,
like MIT or something like that.

93
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.910
So yeah.
The big one is that first one.

94
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.300
Like if you can't have Alt text,
at least make it empty so

95
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.910
that users aren't listening
to file names be read aloud.

96
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.530
Cool.
More check marks off our list.

97
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.140
So basically, for both text, audio and

98
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.340
video there should be just
some ways of reading.

99
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.570
So, for your videos, you need close
captioning, your images need all text.

100
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.350
And a lot of great services like all text
is pretty easy to do yourself and then,

101
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.340
services like YouTube offer
close captioning for free.

102
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.230
Theres like a lot of really cool stuff and

103
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.280
I've even seen some really great
strides lately like at conferences,

104
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.410
they've started, there's free
program out there that are like,

105
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.490
you attach to one of your speakers,
and it will go ahead and it will like.

106
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.990
Produce pretty accurate close captioning
in real time of the conference talk or

107
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.920
things like that.

108
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.210
As so this like some really
cool stuff you can do there.

109
00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.360
Some more check box system.

110
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.720
And then another thing that you
wanted do sometimes if you want to

111
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.000
hide something from screen readers.

112
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.020
Screen readers don't read anything
that's display non visibility, hidden or

113
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.740
input hidden.

114
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.220
Again, if you want an image skipped over,
it's really nice, you can just go ahead

115
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.680
and give it an empty alt, but
then if you just want things hidden,

116
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.790
know that doing any of these things will
also hide them from the screen reader.

117
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.480
So, they're pretty good at keeping up with
what you would do to visually hide them.

118
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.970
But you will notice on
Frameworks Foundation or bootstrap.

119
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.950
They'll have some classes
that are very specific.

120
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.710
Like visually hidden means it's not going
to be hidden from a screen reader and

121
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.330
then hidden would be hidden both ways.

122
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.938
So then, you can kind of do the opposite,
hide it from a user but

123
00:06:44.938 --> 00:06:46.080
show it to a screen reader.

124
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.040
And then with everything with CSS,
there's a million approaches on this.

125
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.990
I think this is one of
the most common ones.

126
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.620
This is what we used at Twitter.

127
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.300
So, you get a position absolute, you knock
it way off the screen, but, you give

128
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.240
it one-by-one pixels so it has some size
to it so the screen reader will read it.

129
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.180
So, it won't render because it's way
off the screen a thousand pixels,

130
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.960
but it'll be read.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's essentially

131
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.020
the approach you were using in one way or
another for

132
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.080
the skip navigation.
&gt;&gt; Jon: Exactly.

133
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I don't know if this is

134
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:21.040
still an issue, but
going back to the outlines

135
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.350
in browser sometimes when you shoot
something off the screen you get a really

136
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.120
ugly dotted line.
&gt;&gt; Jon: Yeah, I think they've all,

137
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.090
because this is used so often, I think
all the main rendering engines are really

138
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.110
good at handling a one
pixel element off the line.

139
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.380
It did used to be big and it also would
like yeah, it caused them to like.

140
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.210
They'd be looking to render that whole.

141
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.940
Cuz you've just made the browser, or
the window, like 1000 pixels wider, right?

142
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.690
I'm pretty sure there's not a performance
hit, or not a significant one,

143
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.280
to doing that anymore.

144
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.058
And I looked at a couple of different
frameworks, and it seems to be a pretty

145
00:07:51.058 --> 00:07:54.070
agreed-on best practice.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I think bootstrapping's

146
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.740
clip.
&gt;&gt; Jon: Yeah, so

147
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.400
there you can use background clips.

148
00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.490
Yeah, you can use that too.

149
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.200
Again there's a gambling
in different approaches but

150
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.210
just knowing at if something has a little
bit of size and be read by screen reader,

151
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.590
you could visually hide it by
like either clipping it or

152
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.320
knocking it of the screen.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Jack in the chapter that

153
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.600
says, an example of why you
would want to skip an image

154
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.110
by setting the old
attribute to empty strings.

155
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.912
Is, if the image is purely decorative or

156
00:08:18.912 --> 00:08:21.379
otherwise does not add any meaning.
&gt;&gt; Jon: Absolutely,

157
00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:22.099
that's a really good point.

158
00:08:22.099 --> 00:08:27.002
So yeah, any presentational images that
are just, you have a wreath lining

159

your blog post Poster,
something that's like a design-only image.

160
00:08:31.615 --> 00:08:33.245
That would be a great opportunity to.

161
00:08:33.245 --> 00:08:36.175
So yeah, it's good to keep in mind,
user-generated makes some sense.

162
00:08:36.175 --> 00:08:39.515
But also, sometimes you'll intentionally
leave one blank because it's not helping

163
00:08:39.515 --> 00:08:40.705
the page any.

164
00:08:40.705 --> 00:08:41.465
So, good point.
