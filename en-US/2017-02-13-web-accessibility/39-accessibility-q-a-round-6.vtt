WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Cody points in the chat,
the can I use ha sa partial support for

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.240
Aria.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, okay.

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.650
Yeah.
[LAUGH] That's a good point.

4
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:10.310
Yeah.

5
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.390
Aria in general, it's a big speck
with a lot of different things in it,

6
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.510
and a lot of is,
I'm not exactly sure why this happens.

7
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.790
But a lot of it is left up to discretion
for the screen readers, for the device,

8
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.980
which is where I think the stuff that we
covered today is pretty safely universal.

9
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.870
But when you get in to some
more of the complex stuff,

10
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.960
the support is pretty all over the place.

11
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.370
A lot of the basic stuff with ARIA was
made to fill in gaps that didn't exist

12
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.050
in html, and a lot of that's supported but
Aria has a ton of different stuff.

13
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.220
Screen readers are private.

14
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.500
Company is not really held to much.

15
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.590
It's kind of like the old days of
the browsers where there wasn't really all

16
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.600
that much reason to follow the spec
as much as, just do your own thing.

17
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.650
But, in my experience, Doing the things
that we've covered here has really,

18
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.490
really wide support with
the different screen readers.

19
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.060
That being said, I have run into
a few weird bugs where it's been on

20
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.390
a specific version of JAWS that
doesn't handle something the same way.

21
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.310
I would definitely say all the things
that we covered today, skiplinks and

22
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.360
all the roles and everything like that,
that's going to be very well supported.

23
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.380
Q18 uses browser stack for
testing devices.

24
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is there something

25
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.360
equivalent for screen readers?
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I don't think there is.

26
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.380
Yeah, I really don't think there is.

27
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.960
I mean, you can get a lot from the static
analysis tools, a lot of good stuff,

28
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.620
this is a bad label, but
that's not really using a screen reader.

29
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.480
So, they have the two
things that there aren't.

30
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.650
There's no screen reader API at all and
then,

31
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.320
there's no automated actual screen
reader testing tools that I've seen.

32
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.120
But you can get pretty far
with hooking up and Ally.

33
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.780
One of those linters.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Again, from Ben Are there

34
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.790
any certain methods of authentication that
work better for people with disabilities?

35
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.370
For examples,
are passwords ever a problem.

36
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.620
Are there any methods that are strongly
preferred, and are there better ways to

37
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.510
implement to FA, to factor authentication.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Okay,

38
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.610
so, a big one that comes to mind right
away is, like the difficulty with some of

39
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.250
the anti-spam stuff,
like Captchas that i mentioned.

40
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.350
So if you have Captchas they can be really
problematic for users with disabilities.

41
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.140
As far as 2FA goes,
it's really interesting.

42
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.800
I haven't seen anything done
in that realm specifically.

43
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.990
I don't think there is much.

44
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.550
You have a screen reader on your phone
just as well as you have a screen reader

45
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.750
on your computer, so
if it's logging in from the computer and

46
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.550
sending a text message,
that's still very doable.

47
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.090
But I haven't seen any
accessibility specific to FA stuff.

48
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.380
And then as far as log-ins and
passwords go, I think really,

49
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.050
I mean following a few of the things
that we covered, like rolls, labels,

50
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.770
descriptions and
then just a good U I is definitely enough.

51
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.940
The two factor one interests me.

52
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.900
I would definitely like to do
a little bit more research, and

53
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.540
if there's any accessibility
preferences were two factor off.

54
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.214
But I haven't seen anything like that.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I

55
00:03:28.214 --> 00:03:31.110
don't know if you have.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I saw a presentation

56
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.300
given last year at the season conference
which is an international disabilities

57
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.680
conference by a couple of
accessibility professionals at AT&amp;T.

58
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.430
And it was generally about security.

59
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.250
And they touched on two factor auth And

60
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.270
there were two concerns that
they brought up in general.

61
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.290
One which was, because you may
have someone with the disability,

62
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.985
who's using assistive technology,
let's say on their desktop computer.

63
00:03:57.985 --> 00:03:58.640
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Uh-huh.

64
00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: But they're being required

65
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.870
to use two factor auth on their phone It
may actually be physically difficult for

66
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.530
them to move
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Sure.

67
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Between those two devices

68
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.140
and especially if there's a timer
between when the first action and

69
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.280
the second should have to be completed.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Right.

70
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: The other thing was,

71
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.660
that you have to ensure that
both of the devices that you're

72
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.300
putting them in the position to have
to use, that those experiences are both

73
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.320
fully accessible as well.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Right.

74
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.100
Yeah, so I think that the most
common approach being like,

75
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.630
you get a text message to your phone.

76
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.380
I mean the first one's
definitely an issue.

77
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.770
But in a similar sense,
it's the same issue for everyone, right?

78
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.820
Which is kind of the point of the two FAs,

79
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.650
that you have to stop what
you're doing and switch devices.

80
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.270
But a text message would be fully
accessible for people on the phone.

81
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.610
One thing I might look into
huluauthenticator and duosecurity.

82
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.160
Are those accessible apps?

83
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.080
So, if instead of a text message if you're
requiring the user to unlock their phone,

84
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.140
go to an authenticator and
generate a token, then go back.

85
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.810
So, that would be I guess
a concern around 2FAs

86
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.440
if you recommend an authenticator app,
making sure that it itself is accessible.

87
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.390
I do think it's something to be aware of,
that you're asking potentially

88
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.640
a lot from users, but on the other hand,
in a sense, that's kind of the whole point

89
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.260
of the extra authentication layer is that
You know, by its very nature it has to be

90
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.690
a second device, it has to be
a second Also, CSUN is awesome.

91
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.940
If you all get a chance to go,
it's quite good.

92
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.490
It's like, I think, the biggest
accessibility conference of the year.

93
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.830
There's always really great talks.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Can you say that name again,

94
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:39.745
please?
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: CSUN.

95
00:05:39.745 --> 00:05:42.720
C-S-U-N.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It's California State

96
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.889
University at Northridge.

97
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.900
And they have an international
accessibility conference every year, last

98
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.990
few years it's been down in San Diego.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So, is there an acronym for

99
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.420
the actual conference?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: CSUN.

100
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: That's the school.

101
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Well, yes,

102
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.280
if you google CSUN-
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I think at this point

103
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.580
the conference has outranked
the school as far as, but yeah, here.

104
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.220
I mean if you just.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I heard CSUN I'm like

105
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.865
I got the school that's all I got.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Gotcha.

106
00:06:10.865 --> 00:06:12.220
Yeah, it's quite good.

107
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.970
They always have people that
are doing really cutting age stuff,

108
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:15.880
really interesting stuff.
