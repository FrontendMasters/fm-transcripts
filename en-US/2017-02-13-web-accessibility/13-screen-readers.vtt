00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.940
&gt;&gt; Joe Kuperman: So there's a lot of
different screen readers, so for those of

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.160
you that are front end developers, get
used to another frustrating thing where

3
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.260
not everything works the same on
all these different platforms.

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.490
So there's a bunch of
different screen readers for

5
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.420
different operating systems and
they all work mostly the same.

6
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.040
But really often we get, like when I
worked at Twitter, we got like, okay it's

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.152
like Jaws but its like five versions ago
that has the problem and people are like.

8
00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:31.169
[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] It's the same with
browsers but they work mostly the same

9
00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.640
like everything we're talking about today
is universal but when you get into like

10
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.140
some really advanced stuff The screen
writers can work a little bit differently.

11
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.863
I can't think of a really
good example right now, but

12
00:00:43.863 --> 00:00:48.440
we will get into some,
similar to different browsers.

13
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.100
So Jaws, ZoomText, so

14
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.359
if you have Mac you can turn your
screen right around with command f5.

15
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.840
But keep your volume down right now.

16
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.860
And it'll turn on voice over for
mac which is which is really really great.

17
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.300
We're gonna be using ChromeVox.

18
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.130
Specifically because it's built by them
into the browser not the operating system.

19
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.900
So no matter what operating system you run
if you wanted to download Chrome you can

20
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.890
follow along perfectly, but yeah.

21
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.300
I really like voice over and
I really like jaws.

22
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.190
If I'm on Windows.

23
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.670
So those are my recommendations.

24
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.020
If you wanted to go out at
expense one at your work and

25
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.870
start screen readering everything.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

26
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.710
&gt;&gt; Joe Kuperman: VoiceOver's free.

27
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.020
It's Mac only.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: NVDA is also free,

28
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.630
whereas JAWS is pretty expensive, so.
&gt;&gt; Joe Kuperman: Right.

29
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.230
Yeah, I'd say it probably,
at least in my experience, I only get

30
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.140
Jaws when I get a report for Jaws if
somebody's like we're trying to use.

31
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.770
At Twitter we had a Jaws report, so we
expensed a copy of Jaws and NVDA is great.

32
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.590
Honestly, for all the stuff we're
doing today, it's universally shared.

33
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.320
It's very much like CSS with a browser.

34
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.920
Where you're pretty much all good and

35
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.819
then once in a while something is just
not gonna work on one of the browsers.

36
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.810
So yeah, anybody who wants to jump
ahead we're gonna be using ChromeVox.

37
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.650
It's in the Google Chrome Store.

38
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.280
Yeah, it's not my favorite
screen reader but

39
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.660
it's really nice that you can use
that in the operating system.
