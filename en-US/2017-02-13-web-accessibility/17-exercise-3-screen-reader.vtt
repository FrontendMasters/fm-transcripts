&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: The third
exercise is a screen reader one.

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.720
So basically what I would
maybe challenge you to do,

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.880
if you have headphones,
you could download ChromeVox and

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.520
actually do it listening to it with
your screen dimmed all the way.

5
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.010
That would be like the super challenge
mode, can you fill out the whole form?

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.030
If you don't have headphones, though,

7
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.900
feel free to just have ChromeVox
on with your laptop muted and

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.390
it'll read everything, it'll print
everything out in the bottom left.

9
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.130
And so the idea here,
let me go over to my project, is we've

10
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.920
got this screen reader example, so we've
got the sign up for our mailing list.

11
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.980
And so what we want, first I guess,
turn on the screen reader and

12
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.910
identify why this would be challenging
to fill out for non sighted users.

13
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.790
And then kind of going through,
covering just the stuff that we covered.

14
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.330
And make it so that it can be filled
out by an non sighted user with just

15
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.810
a screen reader.

16
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.190
Additionally if you're on a Mac, which
I see many of the people in person are,

17
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.720
you don't have to download ChromeVox
if you just wanna turn on VoiceOver and

18
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.950
try that instead,
which is built into your Macs.

19
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.790
But totally up to you,
ChromeVox is just nice cuz it's free and

20
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.640
everybody can use it.
