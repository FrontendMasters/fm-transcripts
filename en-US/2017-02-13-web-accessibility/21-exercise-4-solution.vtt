00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.707
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So during that break I
had probably the smallest little exercise

2
00:00:04.707 --> 00:00:09.316
which was just going over ARIA roles,
HTML5 elements, things like that.

3
00:00:09.316 --> 00:00:12.523
So I think the example that I included,

4
00:00:12.523 --> 00:00:17.977
yeah it's just this little page
that doesn't look like too much.

5
00:00:17.977 --> 00:00:21.225
But if we were to go into the code for

6
00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:26.650
it,
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Basically

7
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.881
we could just see a couple of things,
it's kind of up to you.

8
00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:30.881
I mean, I use the word article and

9
00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:35.256
class article to hint that this could
probably be an article tag in HTML.

10
00:00:35.256 --> 00:00:37.836
A lot of this stuff's subjective, but

11
00:00:37.836 --> 00:00:42.773
I think in general with how good HTML5
is and how gracefully it falls back.

12
00:00:42.773 --> 00:00:46.896
You just don't wanna have a million divs
basically all over the place when you

13
00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:49.506
could have something that
did a little bit more.

14
00:00:49.506 --> 00:00:52.629
So if you wanted to you could
change these to articles, and

15
00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.303
then you could even give them.

16
00:00:54.303 --> 00:00:59.752
Like we talked about for the old browsers
or old screen readers, role="article".

17
00:00:59.752 --> 00:01:04.707
Also like I mentioned before,
content structure, so

18
00:01:04.707 --> 00:01:11.939
seeing as this Semantic HTML is the top
of logical structure it should be in h1.

19
00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.916
And so we can choose that, turn h1 and

20
00:01:14.916 --> 00:01:18.278
even if we wanted we
could put a class on it.

21
00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:21.925
We could give it a class of smaller and
then we could go ahead and

22
00:01:21.925 --> 00:01:25.535
resize that with CSS to make
it smaller if we wanted.

23
00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:32.730
So yeah, similarly make those article,
role="article", something like that.

24
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.913
Okay we've got a third one here.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Which will just make it

25
00:01:36.913 --> 00:01:43.280
a little bit nicer when it's being read
to your users, if I spell it right, cool.

26
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.460
And then we could float those or
do whatever we want, as needed.

27
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.860
Another thing is just being wary
of your content instructor,

28
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.690
so if we go back over here and
I turn back on my screen reader.

29
00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:03.160
And then I hit Ctrl-Option-U, and
then I go over to the right, to headings.

30
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.641
It looks a little bit disjointed,
so it'll be like,

31
00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:08.188
we have Semantic HTML as
the top one now which is great.

32
00:02:08.188 --> 00:02:12.364
But then these are really all just
articles, some of them are in h3, and

33
00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:13.265
one's in h4.

34
00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:15.215
So again,
just like kinda cleaning through,

35
00:02:15.215 --> 00:02:17.019
how would you people to navigate the site?

36
00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.177
I would assume you'd want this to
be the h1 like we changed it and

37
00:02:20.177 --> 00:02:21.594
these probably are h2's.

38
00:02:21.594 --> 00:02:24.900
They should be top level things
that you wanna click on.

39
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.920
So again, if you wanted to go back,
let me turn the screen reader off.

40
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.260
If you wanted to go back in and
just change, let me find the first one,

41
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.597
probably all of these to h2's.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Something like that,

42
00:02:36.597 --> 00:02:37.800
give that a refresh.

43
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.301
We don't wanna use CSS to make them
float or make them a little smaller.

44
00:02:40.301 --> 00:02:42.788
Then I turn my screen reader back on and

45
00:02:42.788 --> 00:02:45.950
go to our,
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: To headings again.

46
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.210
And that looks pretty nice, so
if somebody's coming to this site.

47
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.956
It's contrived but assuming that you
had a lot of real content on here,

48
00:02:51.956 --> 00:02:54.274
like news articles or something like that.

49
00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:58.537
It would be really nice for them to hit
this and it would say New York Times.

50
00:02:58.537 --> 00:03:02.254
And then article titles would be
like "Trump did something silly" or

51
00:03:02.254 --> 00:03:03.141
whatever it is.

52
00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:08.265
Now this recording isn't gonna be
timeless cuz I made a political joke,

53
00:03:08.265 --> 00:03:09.530
that's too bad.

54
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.365
Okay so yeah, so basically having
a little bit of understanding for

55
00:03:12.365 --> 00:03:14.066
how people might be browsing your site.

56
00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:18.166
When we do all those CSS tricks they're
changing them to h2's to make them

57
00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:18.762
smaller.

58
00:03:18.762 --> 00:03:23.961
It's only having a good effect on sighted,
on visual users.

59
00:03:23.961 --> 00:03:27.799
Where it's actually having a really bad
effect on people that may be viewing it

60
00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:28.565
in other ways.

61
00:03:28.565 --> 00:03:30.480
So cleaning this up so
that it works well for

62
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.680
both groups is fantastic.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Go ahead and

63
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.944
turn the screen reader off again, or not.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Get

64
00:03:39.944 --> 00:03:43.596
me out of here.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Okay cool, so

65
00:03:43.596 --> 00:03:48.203
going back into it, and
this one's really good too.

66
00:03:48.203 --> 00:03:51.256
I think that we're gonna get into
tools later where you can kind of run

67
00:03:51.256 --> 00:03:52.110
an audit of sites.

68
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.673
But I do think in general those
important kinda checklists items,

69
00:03:55.673 --> 00:03:59.635
like using the right markup,
is applicable for buttons and form fields.

70
00:03:59.635 --> 00:04:02.670
But it's also applicable for
your headers and your HTML5 tags too.

71
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.954
Okay cool, so some more like
checklists that we can get off,

72
00:04:06.954 --> 00:04:10.739
semantic markup for
the headings and lists, great.

73
00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.100
And then the reading and
navigation order is logical and intuitive.

74
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.448
So again kinda going back you can use
voice over as heading section to kinda

75
00:04:18.448 --> 00:04:19.367
a quick spot check.

76
00:04:19.367 --> 00:04:24.955
But again, your h1 is down your h5's or
whatever you use.

77
00:04:24.955 --> 00:04:29.650
That should really outline the structure
of your content in a logical way.

78
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.501
Like title of your whole page,
each article title, and

79
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:34.100
then maybe article sub title.

80
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.740
Whatever you wanna have should
be logical and ordered that way.

81
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.430
And then going in the robust, these ones
are interesting to be Level A compliant.

82
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.426
Are they talking about HTML and
XHTML validation?

83
00:04:47.426 --> 00:04:51.701
So I think this is something that
used to be really common practice,

84
00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:54.782
really required if you
were gonna launch a site.

85
00:04:54.782 --> 00:04:58.388
And I feel like it's kind of gotten
less and less popular over the years for

86
00:04:58.388 --> 00:04:59.093
some reason.

87
00:04:59.093 --> 00:05:04.768
But the W3 has its own validator,
validator.w3.org.

88
00:05:04.768 --> 00:05:09.035
And you can put in any website into
that or even copy paste HTML and

89
00:05:09.035 --> 00:05:10.786
it'll catch spec areas.

90
00:05:10.786 --> 00:05:13.536
Like if you don't have a closing tag
when you need one or if you have

91
00:05:13.536 --> 00:05:16.941
an attribute that doesn't belong to
an element, all sorts of things like that.

92
00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:21.051
I feel like yeah, that used to be like
everybody did it and now day I feel like

93
00:05:21.051 --> 00:05:24.818
nobody does it, but it's important to do.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I thought the functionality

94
00:05:24.818 --> 00:05:26.821
is built into a lot of linters now days.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So

95
00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:28.780
you can get some cool stuff.

96
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.357
If you're using eslint you
can get some neat stuff about

97
00:05:32.357 --> 00:05:34.497
attributes that don't belong.

98
00:05:34.497 --> 00:05:36.950
But if you're using a big dynamic app,

99
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.021
like sometimes you can have elements
accidentally appearing outside of other.

100
00:05:42.021 --> 00:05:44.493
You can still run into
a decent amount of problems.

101
00:05:44.493 --> 00:05:50.638
Same thing with your like meta tags in
the head and some things like that which

102
00:05:50.638 --> 00:05:55.850
can get caught in validator but
might not get caught in a linter.

103
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.270
But they do go a really long way.
