&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So somebody had pointed
out accessibility problems on my site,

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.180
which is intentional.

3
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.453
But I just forgot about it.

4
00:00:06.453 --> 00:00:12.990
[LAUGH] But so, the demo site
has different color problems.

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.270
And just kind of generally, between with
no coffee, you can kinda start getting

6
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.410
what colors kind of tend to blur
together on different sites, and

7
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.220
which ones seem difficult to use.

8
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:30.364
And then there's another tool
that's really helpful for this,

9
00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:36.970
it's accessible color palette.

10
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.330
I'll stick it in the chat in one second.

11
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.540
Yeah, I think it's this tool.

12
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.560
Yeah, it's really cool as well.

13
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.261
So what this tool allows you to do,

14
00:00:45.261 --> 00:00:49.220
is you can stick in all of the different
hex codes that you use for any website.

15
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.110
And this stuff is good
beyond websites too,

16
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.090
if you're doing branding for
business cards, or anything like that.

17
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.060
So you can stick these in.

18
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.921
Like, for example, OOFFOO and

19
00:00:59.921 --> 00:01:03.784
FFFFFF, something like that.

20
00:01:03.784 --> 00:01:06.890
And then you can choose your conformance
level, like we've been talking about.

21
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.310
And then you can go ahead and submit, and

22
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.350
then it'll give you this really
nice layout of these two things.

23
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.700
And it will give you
a bunch of information.

24
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.800
So it'll be like, does it fail?

25
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.640
And not only does it fail or
pass, but at what level?

26
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.160
And so what you'll see if you play
around with these, is sometimes, and

27
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.796
by level I mean font size, is that
sometimes the color scheme will be okay as

28
00:01:30.796 --> 00:01:33.860
long as you're at 18 point or bigger font.

29
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.200
Whereas anything smaller than
that can kind of blur together.

30
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.640
So if we wanna take a quick,
another ten minute break.

31
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.830
The two challenges, I'll put this link in,
but between this and the no coffee,

32
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.400
to kinda grab the colors from my site,
the site that we're all working on.

33
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.960
And see if that passes, and if not,
maybe what size it would pass at.

34
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.720
And then also if you just get a few
minutes to look at any of your sites or

35
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.910
projects.

36
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.940
Just pop the colors in and
see if they're compliant or not.
