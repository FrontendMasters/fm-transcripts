00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.390
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So
I'm gonna push a branch with the answer,

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.410
while people are working on this one.

3
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.970
I also have a note in the modal.js file.

4
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.059
I have just a simple repo that has
a list of all tab-able elements, so

5
00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.377
you don't have to type all those out
manually, so you can just copy that.

6
00:00:13.377 --> 00:00:20.140
And then on the slides,
I've basically pseudo-coded it, right?

7
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.990
So you can refer to these slides.

8
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.520
I'm also gonna push the answers up.

9
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.134
But yeah, so we're gonna do
another quick ten minute one and

10
00:00:26.134 --> 00:00:27.681
then we'll go over it altogether.

11
00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:29.788
So the modal already exists on that page.

12
00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:36.427
Here I think I can go over to it.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Focus control,

13
00:00:36.427 --> 00:00:39.427
okay so we already have a modal and
it says sign up for free, and

14
00:00:39.427 --> 00:00:42.399
we already have, I think,
yeah if you hit cancel it closes.

15
00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.780
So we already have a lot of
the basic functionalities.

16
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.165
So the two things that
we'll need to do are,

17
00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:50.960
we'll need when you are in the modal and
you start hitting tab,

18
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.680
we'll need to be able to trap
the keyboard, instead of going up here and

19
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.110
then back to the back button, we need to
be able to trap it so it stays in here.

20
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.590
And then the other thing that
we'll wanna do is something like,

21
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.850
when you hit the Escape key or

22
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.670
when you click into the gray,
both of those should close the modal.

23
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.078
Those are just things that I think
are user-experience things that people

24
00:01:10.078 --> 00:01:10.680
are used to.

25
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.730
So we're gonna be working
on that kinda stuff.

26
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.242
Ten minutes and
I'll go over it altogether,

27
00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:18.490
and I'll push the answers in
an answers branch right now.
