00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.980
&gt;&gt; Jon: Okay, here we are.

2
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.545
So Visible Focus.
So

3
00:00:01.545 --> 00:00:04.277
this is another thing that we
were just kinda talking about.

4
00:00:04.277 --> 00:00:08.103
But one of these checklist items,and as we
keep going through the slides we're gonna

5
00:00:08.103 --> 00:00:09.600
tick off these checklist items.

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.550
But it needs to be be visually apparent
which page element has the current

7
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.535
keyboard focus, i.e as you tab through
the page, you can see where you are.

8
00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:20.032
So if you go to a lot of the big websites,
and you start tabbing through.

9
00:00:20.032 --> 00:00:23.084
You'll notice,
maybe even that you haven't noticed

10
00:00:23.084 --> 00:00:27.805
before that every single interactive item
has some kind of visual focus state to it.

11
00:00:27.805 --> 00:00:31.945
A Twitter or a Facebook status or
a profile picture things like that.

12
00:00:31.945 --> 00:00:35.860
And yeah, like we were mentioning it
is kind of this common anti pattern

13
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.430
to remove that focus state,
so don't do that.

14
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A request from
the chatroom Michael J says for newbies,

15
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.230
please explain the caveat on OS X

16
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.280
regarding enabling press tab highlight
each item on a website, webpage.

17
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.701
&gt;&gt; Jon: OS X regarding enabling press.

18
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:55.014
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Let me

19
00:00:55.014 --> 00:00:55.623
highlight that for you.

20
00:00:55.623 --> 00:00:56.664
&gt;&gt; Jon: I see it, I'm just not sure.

21
00:00:56.664 --> 00:00:57.944
I'm not sure what that means.

22
00:00:57.944 --> 00:01:00.378
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I believe what he's

23
00:01:00.378 --> 00:01:07.950
referring to is with, when you,
say you do a fresh install of OS X.

24
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.012
And I believe it's in preferences,
that you actually have

25
00:01:13.012 --> 00:01:18.185
to go back in and
specifically say that non focusable items.

26
00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:21.318
I can't remember the terminology,
but it's not on by default.

27
00:01:21.318 --> 00:01:29.240
You actually have to go in and modify some
preferences, I'll have to look it up here.

28
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.330
&gt;&gt; Jon: We'll follow up on that
during one of the exercise breaks.

29
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.980
We'll find a blog post or something
detailing that and put it in chat.

30
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.770
cool, thanks for that comment.

31
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.110
And so here is an example of visual focus
so you can look back at a website and

32
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.830
you can tell that you are on
the email field filling something.

33
00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:52.925
We mention a little bit before,
talking about CSS resets and frameworks,

34
00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:54.555
things like that.

35
00:01:54.555 --> 00:01:57.258
They can be a little bit dangerous doing
things like removing the focus state.

36
00:01:57.258 --> 00:02:01.462
But I also wanted to give a big
shout out to specifically bootstrap,

37
00:02:01.462 --> 00:02:05.075
which I think made accessibility
a lot more mainstream.

38
00:02:05.075 --> 00:02:08.060
Just by making it a priority,
kinda from the get go.

39
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.340
So if you use Bootstrap like these are in
some Bootstrap theme you get a ton of

40
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.940
really, really good stuff for free.

41
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.406
On the other hand they also,

42
00:02:17.406 --> 00:02:22.031
it's like kinda the battle with design is,
everybody wants to kinda change things.

43
00:02:22.031 --> 00:02:26.130
Like I think the focus date isn't often
removed because people don't want it.

44
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.750
It's because they want
it changed a little bit.

45
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.090
So they want it to be like a gray
glow it's opposed to blue glow,

46
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.990
things like that.

47
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.181
And we often see this
like accessibility trap,

48
00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:38.929
these are often like trying to reengineer
elements like make your own check box.

49
00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:42.650
Or make your own button or make your
own focus thing, things like that.

50
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.408
So I think, I guess the take away there
is that if you are gonna to embark

51
00:02:46.408 --> 00:02:47.696
on a journey like that.

52
00:02:47.696 --> 00:02:52.710
That's like one area where accessibility
really needs to be a shipping requirement,

53
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.300
you know things like that.

54
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.250
Because that's like one big area where
we can totally break websites just

55
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.700
by trying to make them
look a little different.
