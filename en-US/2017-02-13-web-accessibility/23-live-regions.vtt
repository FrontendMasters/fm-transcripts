00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.540
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: This one we kind of
hinted at earlier about live regions.

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.880
Basically, you have these sites
that are really interactive.

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.180
And let's say you're clicking buttons and
the buttons are changing a text field,

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.910
or it's some kind or game, or
it's some kind chat conversation.

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.820
And when they start chatting, you get
a little so-and-so is typing notification,

6
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.440
things like that.

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.820
So by default,
the screen reader reads the screen and

8
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.870
then you're kind of left up to your own
devices as you're interacting with it.

9
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.100
It reads everything that's going on,
like an empty chat box.

10
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.158
And then it tells you that you're
on a text field for typing, so

11
00:00:34.158 --> 00:00:38.690
you know what you're saying and
you hit Enter and you hope it's sent.

12
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.323
But Aria live regions are great,
cuz we can tell a screen reader that

13
00:00:42.323 --> 00:00:45.256
a certain area is going to
be updating frequently, and

14
00:00:45.256 --> 00:00:49.670
that it's important that what happens
in there gets spoken to the user.

15
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.970
So they're really good for,
I mean, chat would be big.

16
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.890
I have a contrived example that we're all
gonna do together, but the basic idea is

17
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.890
any region of your site that demands
special interest, special focus, and

18
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.790
it's going to be updating.

19
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.841
Can you just get marked with aria-live?

20
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:09.843
So aria-live, there's aria-live and
aria-relevant.

21
00:01:09.843 --> 00:01:13.070
So aria-live is just the mode,
like I was talking about before.

22
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.858
So by default it's off.

23
00:01:15.858 --> 00:01:18.503
But you can have polite or assertive mode.

24
00:01:18.503 --> 00:01:21.503
And so this is basically like
the screen reader's kind of API,

25
00:01:21.503 --> 00:01:25.636
where if you're in polite mode, the screen
reader will wait until any other pertinent

26
00:01:25.636 --> 00:01:29.520
information that it's already saying
is done, and then give you an update.

27
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.320
But if it's in assertive mode, as soon
as that live region updates it's going

28
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.890
to be telling you, somebody chatted
hello or that kind of thing.

29
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.540
And then aria-relevant is getting
you a little bit more fine grain.

30
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.210
This one's not always necessary.

31
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.730
But it's just a little bit
more finding control into what

32
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.520
types of changes should we be
letting the user know about.

33
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.400
So you could do additions, like DOM Node
additions,, removals, a text change, or

34
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.110
all sorts of changes.

35
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.453
Again, so for
chat you'd probably just want maybe,

36
00:01:57.453 --> 00:01:59.470
I guess you could go either way.

37
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.180
You wouldn't want deletions, but
you'd probably want a text change, yeah?

38
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Question from Drew,

39
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.000
hitting space when a button
has focus will click it.

40
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.850
If you assign another element,
a rollover button,

41
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.826
will it inherit this behavior?
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Right,

42
00:02:12.826 --> 00:02:13.540
that's a great question.

43
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.730
Okay so yeah, roll will not mess with
function, won't give it any functionality.

44
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.470
Roll is just changing how
the screen reader will identify it.

45
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.730
So then if you have a span role of button,
like a span you're trying to turn into

46
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.090
button, you'd need to add
an on key down listener.

47
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.050
And then, in that listener, see if space
was the key that was hit down, and

48
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.250
then do something.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, Victor,

49
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.086
another question.

50
00:02:37.086 --> 00:02:41.360
In a single-page app where you show
a loader while data is fetching,

51
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.430
then show the app once it's ready,

52
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.720
how would you use aria roles there?
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So I don't think that,

53
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.230
well, yeah, so it's not so
much about roles as much as that plays

54
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.430
really nicely into maybe some of the live
regions stuff that you could do.

55
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.950
So you could have the area where like say,

56
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.590
you have a little side
bar widget that loads.

57
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.640
You could have additions and
removals marked as aria-live over there.

58
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.790
And so then the screen reader,
I mean okay, so

59
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.000
let's actually take a second to
think about it because, it's like,

60
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.430
how important is it that when that content
loads in, that it gets announced, right?

61
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.470
So if it's the main content of your app,
then it's very important.

62
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.130
So you'd want to put
an aria-live region on it.

63
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.360
So that as soon as content loads in,
the screen reader starts reading.

64
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.790
If it's like a sidebar element, it might
not be as important to put live on it,

65
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.470
because you probably don't need that

66
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.770
sidebar information interrupting
the flow of your content.

67
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.760
So I think it's again, just a little
bit subjective in the sense of

68
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.320
thinking about what work
flows could possibly happen.

69
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.150
If it's like your whole app is in a
loading spinner, then I say yeah you just

70
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.520
wanna mark it as a live region so
it gets announced when it comes in.

71
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.210
If it's something kind of tangential,
and you don't do anything,

72
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.980
I guess there's the danger of, I mean,
I would give it some kind of label,

73
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.860
so if someone tabbed over to it, it would
be like, current stock prices loading,

74
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.990
or something like that.

75
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.990
But you might not wanna
have an aria-live on it,

76
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.055
cuz you might not want a sidebar
widget to announce in.

77
00:04:12.055 --> 00:04:14.786
You could again,
maybe split the difference and

78
00:04:14.786 --> 00:04:17.485
go with polite as an aria-live region.

79
00:04:17.485 --> 00:04:20.005
So that way, if it's doing something else,
that's fine.

80
00:04:20.005 --> 00:04:23.485
But when it gets loaded, it at least gets
added into the queue to be announced.

81
00:04:23.485 --> 00:04:24.951
I'm not sure, Jack,

82
00:04:24.951 --> 00:04:28.084
if you have any other suggestions on that.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah,

83
00:04:28.084 --> 00:04:32.062
I mean certainly all of the things that
you've said are good things to consider.

84
00:04:32.062 --> 00:04:33.710
And to your point,

85
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.799
sometimes the answer is it depends
on how you've structured your UI.

86
00:04:39.799 --> 00:04:46.740
I think that, I'm just trying to think if.

87
00:04:47.976 --> 00:04:52.520
The aria-live, well I think either way,
when the content updates,

88
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.000
you just wanna make sure that
the accessibility tree is getting updated.

89
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.194
So that the contents that has now loaded
later is actually getting pushed into that

90
00:05:00.194 --> 00:05:04.048
tree, so that a screen reader or
other assistive technology would see it.

91
00:05:04.048 --> 00:05:05.056
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, yeah, so

92
00:05:05.056 --> 00:05:08.010
I think, yeah,
I think it definitely depends.

93
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.640
And I think it's just like knowing
what tools you have available, right?

94
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.190
So you can do nothing with a good
label that says stock information,

95
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.030
it's still loading, wait a minute,
or something like that.

96
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.270
You can have it interrupt and announce,
or you can have it announce later, and

97
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.530
kind of choosing what's right at the time.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Victor has

98
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.810
a follow-up question.

99
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.866
So do screen readers pick
up changes to the value of

100
00:05:29.866 --> 00:05:33.431
the aria-live attribute?
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Screen readers announce

101
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:36.230
the value of the aria-live
attribute as it changes.

102
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.739
So if you have aria-live hello,
and it's aria-relevant all, and

103
00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:45.920
then use JavaScript to change hello
to goodbye, aria-live will announce.

104
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.790
That's specifically what it does.

105
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.380
Hope that answers it.

106
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.740
Victor, let me know if that
didn't answer the question.

107
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.480
And then, and so it is announcing, and
it's specifically what it does, and

108
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.620
then polite or assertive is kind
of like when it announces it
