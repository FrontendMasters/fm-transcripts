00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I have one other question,
which is, for a lot of the people that

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.010
are in the room here,
many of them are new to accessibility.

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.556
Beyond today's class,

4
00:00:07.556 --> 00:00:11.678
do you have any recommendations
about how to kind of attack going,

5
00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.750
where to start next, or what to do next?
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah.

6
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.053
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Do you focus on an area,

7
00:00:16.053 --> 00:00:18.882
or do you focus on semantics,
or do you focus on?.

8
00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:19.664
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, sure,

9
00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:23.010
I mean, I think one of the ways
that's been most helpful for

10
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.720
me is to take an audit first approach.

11
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.840
So audit your projects, which will give
you exposure to a lot of different things.

12
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.370
So as opposed to buying a book,
or going to the SPEC, and

13
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.680
trying to consume the whole thing, hit all
the things that are applicable to you.

14
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.780
So I think that's been great,

15
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.359
because it really has exposed me
to a breadth of different things.

16
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.092
Other than that though,
I think that there's a couple of things,

17
00:00:48.092 --> 00:00:51.341
like using a screen reader
has also been great.

18
00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:54.892
Get on the screen reader, and
again, that'll expose you to so

19
00:00:54.892 --> 00:00:57.241
many, cuz you'll have to figure it out.

20
00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:01.801
You'll be like, why can't I hear this
item, or whatever, and that'll help you,

21
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:02.636
I don't know,

22
00:01:02.636 --> 00:01:06.960
I guess take a more deliberate approach
without trying to accomplish all of it.

23
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.300
And then other than that, I love WebAIM.

24
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.910
I feel like they've really, if you just
read the WebAIM checklist a couple times

25
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.030
over, cuz it's short,
I think that gets you pretty far.

26
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.008
Not maybe enough to be accessibility
lead at a company that could be facing

27
00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:24.151
lawsuits, but
definitely enough to get your company, or

28
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:27.828
get your product working really
great with assistive technology.

29
00:01:27.828 --> 00:01:31.405
So I guess one of those, either audit
first or screen reader first would be

30
00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:35.020
my recommendations, yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay, Ben, another one is

31
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.232
accessibility seems to almost always
include, improve general usability.

32
00:01:41.232 --> 00:01:44.473
But if I'm trying to
something broadly usable and

33
00:01:44.473 --> 00:01:47.484
accessible, are there
specific conflicts or

34
00:01:47.484 --> 00:01:52.265
trade offs I should expect to encounter?
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I'm kinda trying to think

35
00:01:52.265 --> 00:01:57.516
of any use case where an accessibility
fix makes usability worse,

36
00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:59.593
and I can't think of any.

37
00:01:59.593 --> 00:02:03.337
I mean, what it really boils down to,
using the best HTML, and

38
00:02:03.337 --> 00:02:06.953
the best approaches, and the best,
do you know what I mean?

39
00:02:06.953 --> 00:02:10.737
Providing, if anything, an abundance
of information about your items.

40
00:02:10.737 --> 00:02:13.130
I feel like I don't think
there's a trade-off.

41
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.454
I really think the more you do for
accessibility,

42
00:02:16.454 --> 00:02:20.346
the only effect it can have on
usability is a positive one.

43
00:02:20.346 --> 00:02:23.868
Yeah, I'm struggling to think
of any time where I've had to.

44
00:02:23.868 --> 00:02:26.839
I guess there's a few
things with designers,

45
00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:31.040
like we talked about the links
can't be only separated by color.

46
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.130
But most designers really like that.

47
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.730
And the same with focus controls.

48
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.980
A lot of designers don't like
the focus to change the visual state.

49
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.830
So I guess that's a tradeoff, if you're
really trying to do accessibility stuff,

50
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.680
and the design team feels very strongly
about a UI fix that's not accessible,

51
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.170
that can be a little bit tough.

52
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.100
There's usually a pretty
happy middle grounds though.
