WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.500
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: A lot of this stuff is just
really technical and I think what I spend

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.030
half the time with, with accessibility,
is going upstream to other designers,

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.250
as well as content strategists.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah.

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.822
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: So that we can bake in just

5
00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:17.749
proper content structure and order.

6
00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.994
And with these things in mind, are there
any resources that specifically address it

7
00:00:21.994 --> 00:00:25.770
from those disciplines versus technical.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah I think that would,

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.240
haven't seen a ton.

9
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.030
So I guess some of the stuff is if
you look at some of the material

10
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.200
design principles or something like
the bootstrap high level stuff,

11
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.948
they do a pretty good job at including,

12
00:00:38.948 --> 00:00:44.580
to be like you should order your headings
in this way, those kind of things.

13
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.250
One of the things I've found like
a big win is just helping make some

14
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.480
pretty easy-to-follow rules that
I can pass to design end product.

15
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.560
So for design, sometimes you'll be like
okay, well I need to know if things

16
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.230
can be interacted with and
if so what they do, right?

17
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.040
But that might be a good
time to reach out too and

18
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.730
be like here are just some
general things to think about.

19
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.130
I haven't seen a ton of resources from
that angle, which I think we could really

20
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.990
benefit from some more product level or
design level.

21
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.570
Another big thing that helps with
the product level stuff is if you can

22
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.240
incorporate any of the tools into your CI.

23
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.442
You know its like once something causes
a test to fail as an engineer it's easy to

24
00:01:25.442 --> 00:01:28.281
get some bandwidth to be
like we have to fix or test.

25
00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:32.569
But if there's nothing in CI and
it's just you complaining about it being

26
00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:35.417
inaccessible, I think it
often can fall apart.

27
00:01:35.417 --> 00:01:38.841
So I think that one thing that's great
is if you can get all excited and

28
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:42.698
add it to CI and then all of a sudden
it's like look at all these failures.

29
00:01:42.698 --> 00:01:44.330
I guess we gotta go fix this.

30
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.970
Even though it's a little bit backhanded,
I've had a lot of luck

31
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.050
with that in the past where I rig
something up and then I'm like man.

32
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.866
Who knew?

33
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:55.216
Well, I gotta go fix this stuff now.
&gt;&gt; Multiple: [LAUGH]

34
00:01:55.216 --> 00:01:56.759
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: But, yeah.

35
00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:57.573
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: [COUGH] For

36
00:01:57.573 --> 00:02:02.559
going back to contrast on colors,
it's kind of an ongoing

37
00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:07.443
joke where designers love to
have gray text on white and,

38
00:02:07.443 --> 00:02:13.188
well actually there's an example there,
the placeholder text.

39
00:02:13.188 --> 00:02:17.386
They want it to be light enough
that it's just a suggestion but

40
00:02:17.386 --> 00:02:19.657
dark enough that you can read it.

41
00:02:19.657 --> 00:02:22.500
And then you also need to be able to
tell the difference between that and

42
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.680
what you actually typed.

43
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.237
So how do you find that balance?
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, it's tricky for

44
00:02:28.237 --> 00:02:29.100
sure.

45
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.480
One of the big things is if you have, for

46
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.160
a form, so
again there's multiple demographics.

47
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.370
As far as screen readers go,
if the form field has a label,

48
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.470
the placeholder matters less, right?

49
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.320
But yeah,
as far as partially sighted users go or

50
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.790
users with color contrast difficulties,
that stuff can get really tough.

51
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.990
I think just trying to pick a level
of conformance and just run.

52
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.650
Just be like we can
definitely use grays and

53
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.610
whites but it has to be at least
this gray if it's on white.

54
00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.170
You know what I mean.

55
00:02:59.196 --> 00:03:02.470
Because you can still have
the text type dim be a lot darker

56
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.410
than the--
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: So if that had a label with

57
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.150
it, would it be okay to have
really light placeholder text?

58
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.165
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So if it had a label,

59
00:03:12.165 --> 00:03:14.770
then the screen readers,
our users are fine, right?

60
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.770
Cuz it won't even recognize a placeholder.

61
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:17.660
It'll just say the label.

62
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.090
But if it has a label
that's visually hidden and

63
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.040
then a placeholder that's hard to see and
you have a partially sighted user,

64
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.252
then you might be in some trouble, right?

65
00:03:26.252 --> 00:03:29.613
So if you were,
I don't know a lot of these but

66
00:03:29.613 --> 00:03:34.392
I'm sure we could find a few of
these colors where you can't read

67
00:03:34.392 --> 00:03:39.447
the placeholder at all.
&gt;&gt; Audience 2: The difficulty

68
00:03:39.447 --> 00:03:42.100
actually with the placeholder styling,

69
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.670
that content is controlled and the color
is actually controlled by the browser.

70
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.385
At the moment at least,
as far as I know, that you@yourdomain,

71
00:03:52.385 --> 00:03:56.176
that gray, is not controllable by CSS.
&gt;&gt; Audience 3: Some browsers let you

72
00:03:56.176 --> 00:03:58.506
handle it.
&gt;&gt; Audience 4: I think you can hack your

73
00:03:58.506 --> 00:04:00.620
way into it.
&gt;&gt; Audience 2: Yeah I mean, there are ways

74
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.420
you can hack around it, absolutely.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: But I do agree, I mean

75
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.770
the challenge, too, being hey, you want to
differentiate type text from placeholder

76
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.964
text by making the type text darker?
&gt;&gt; Audience 4: Ironically,

77
00:04:10.964 --> 00:04:13.637
some of the browser
defaults are not contrast

78
00:04:13.637 --> 00:04:14.349
enough so.

79
00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:15.022
&gt;&gt; Audience 2: Yeah, right.

80
00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:15.776
&gt;&gt; Multiple: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Audience 2: Exactly.

81
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.960
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, I mean, yeah.

82
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.570
I think somebody asked a good
question before which was like

83
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.050
trying to do UI/UX stuff and accessibility
stuff usually go hand in hand.

84
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.840
But yeah, this is I think a case
where it might be a little bit of a,

85
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.650
have to be a discussion around keeping
it working for people that are color

86
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.630
blind while making it look similar
to the spec or things like that.

87
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.630
As far as, yeah I mean again, the screen
reader is pretty easy to take care of

88
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.960
because the placeholder's
not gonna get read anyway.

89
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.780
So you can just go ahead and
put a label on it and you're golden.

90
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.380
But yeah, if you have too much gray
on white, it might be difficult.

91
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.470
Are there any major issues dealing
with both internationalization, for

92
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.170
example right-to-left languages,
and accessibility?

93
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.040
Both are very important and
can be challenging.

94
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.819
I'm trying to think of,

95
00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.240
I think the first thing that comes to
mind is just that language attribute.

96
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.060
So specifying it on your whole document
and then if you have sections,

97
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.610
like if you're Twitter and
the whole document's in English but

98
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.190
this tweet is in Chinese, you know,
specifying that lang on there too so

99
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.820
the screen readers will know what to
do with it, know to translate it.

100
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.970
I can't really think of major,

101
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.920
internationalization can be really hard
to work with from a design standpoint.

102
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.590
If you're used to strings that
are ten characters long, and

103
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.480
then you switch to a language where
they're super long and they break things.

104
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.620
But I can't think of an exact area
where they would bump into each other

105
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.220
necessarily.

106
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.644
They just both present unique challenges.
