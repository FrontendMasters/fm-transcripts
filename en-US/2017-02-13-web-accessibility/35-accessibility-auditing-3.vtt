00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Drew is asking for
another audit on a site.

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.740
If you could just pop into
the chat room for a sec.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.650
Sweet, good typing.

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.613
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Thank you.

5
00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:14.190
Cool.
So, I'll start with a regular one.

6
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.620
Looks pretty good so far.

7
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.170
We've got two media controls.

8
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.380
These are buttons that don't have labels.

9
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.170
I'm not even sure where they are.

10
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.160
They're way up here somewhere.

11
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
Cool, so you have this close button,
and this search button,

12
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.930
could just have a label, even if you just
visually hide it to say search and close.

13
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.690
You could also get fancier,
I guess it doesn't need to.

14
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.390
You could put a description
on it if you want.

15
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.930
Text elements without a contrast ratio.

16
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.186
Yeah, so this grey on white looks
to be a little bit problematic.

17
00:00:43.186 --> 00:00:44.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I was gonna
ask you about that one.

18
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.259
Cuz I coded that.

19
00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:49.666
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: [LAUGH] That's my signer
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH] But so

20
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.816
that one always gets flagged.

21
00:00:51.816 --> 00:00:58.058
What it is, if you actual do
the values it's 70 70 70 over white.

22
00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:02.270
So what's happening is it's absolute
positioned over a white border.

23
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.980
So technically, it's accessible
from a contrast ratio standpoint.

24
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.880
But, because of how it's read in the DOM,
it's reading that background color.

25
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.210
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I see.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Which is the, I don't know,

26
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.779
fours.

27
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.644
And so
it's reading the sevens over the fours

28
00:01:19.644 --> 00:01:22.887
instead of the sevens
over the actual border.

29
00:01:22.887 --> 00:01:23.636
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Gotcha.

30
00:01:23.636 --> 00:01:27.849
&gt;&gt; Jack: Yeah,
I've definitely found that you've really,

31
00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:32.890
you have to take these accessibility
checkers with a certain

32
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.700
grain of salt because they only just kind
of take what they can see on the page.

33
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.920
Which just doesn't always
tell the whole story.

34
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.100
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah,
they're programmatically figured out.

35
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.810
Like, these aren't users so
yeah, I think you're fine, yeah.

36
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So, how would you.

37
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.540
So like, legally we have an obligation
to meet certain standards and

38
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.890
we've got those cataloged.

39
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.970
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yep.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: But, if something like that

40
00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.460
were to come up in flagged,
how would you go through

41
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.930
the legalities of actually demonstrating
that you are actually passing what you-

42
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.853
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, I mean,

43
00:02:06.853 --> 00:02:10.765
Jack if you have insight on more
of the kinda legal side of things.

44
00:02:10.765 --> 00:02:12.690
I don't have a ton there.

45
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.150
&gt;&gt; Jack: Well, I'll just speak to,
for example, when I used to work for

46
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.680
Starbucks and
we would occasionally have concerns or

47
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.810
even suits brought by customers
about the accessibility of the site.

48
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.520
And there were times where I would
basically have to like Report as

49
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.810
portions of the side, and where there
were issues for example on the case

50
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.660
that you are talking like with
the search icon or the car contrast.

51
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.934
The person that was reported and
probably was using one of this poles

52
00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:43.736
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Right.

53
00:02:43.736 --> 00:02:48.283
&gt;&gt; Jack: Was erroneously recording the
error, and so it was basically documenting

54
00:02:48.283 --> 00:02:53.060
like this is actually what is the case
even though this checker says one thing.

55
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.230
This is the reality and
you just have to be able to provide that.

56
00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.980
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So theoretically,

57
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.390
he would be fine because the contrast is
fine even if the tool reports otherwise.

58
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.620
Also the tools are open source
it might be worth popping

59
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.180
in something under the chrome project
on get hub and being like hey,

60
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.260
my son always gets dinged with this, but
it's not here's what's really happening.

61
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.892
Cuz they might be able to work around it,
but I do agree.

62
00:03:15.892 --> 00:03:18.304
And when I teach the web
performance classes the same thing.

63
00:03:18.304 --> 00:03:22.470
You gotta take it with a grain of salt,
cuz it's just analyzing some code and

64
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.370
trying to figure things out.

65
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.910
So yeah, it sounds like you would be
fine on that cuz you're able to prove.

66
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Can I have you
tab down through the page.

67
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.875
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: On this one?

68
00:03:31.875 --> 00:03:36.659
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: You'll see
shown to today's classes.

69
00:03:40.217 --> 00:03:44.468
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So notice how it
scrolled to the beginning of the day,

70
00:03:44.468 --> 00:03:47.980
which isn't necessarily what we want.

71
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.160
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah.

72
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.289
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So
would the best thing to do is to re-hidden

73
00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:54.919
all the things that aren't in view?

74
00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.610
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Well,
I mean a couple of different things.

75
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.486
One thing, I mean so you might just
wanna be more specific with on the tab,

76
00:04:02.486 --> 00:04:04.925
you can do a key download scenario and

77
00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:09.959
if on tab in the act development is
the one that's about to go into that area,

78
00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.917
you could then have full control
over what focuses on next.

79
00:04:13.917 --> 00:04:15.236
Like you could focus on little.

80
00:04:15.236 --> 00:04:16.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Is that a good idea though?

81
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.760
To only, to mirror what is visually there?

82
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.200
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: It might be, so
that's like the tricky thing.

83
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.730
So think of,
because you're appealing to both.

84
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.360
Non-sighted users, for
which that won't be so

85
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.140
much of a problem, cuz they'll be like
today's schedule, 6 AM, 7 AM, right?

86
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.900
But what about sighted users who
are using keyboard only, then it

87
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.490
does look like a problem because it
scrolls really really fast out of the way.

88
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.950
Again, it's a little bit subjective.

89
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: And if you keep tabbing
it'll actually break the nav.

90
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.777
Like there it just went away?

91
00:04:48.777 --> 00:04:51.677
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: [LAUGH] Cuz Chrome is trying

92
00:04:51.677 --> 00:04:55.890
to be helpful by keeping it in view,
but yeah.

93
00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.720
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, definitely I
would look into the tab disappearing.

94
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.780
But it's a little bit subjective on
which one it should focus on first.

95
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.580
Because yeah, I don't know.

96
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.920
Like it's I would probably put
a tab listener in there and

97
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.440
replicate the visual experience.

98
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.520
Because you already kind of know,

99
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.720
it looks like you're looking at what time
it is to get the next class or whatever.

100
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.760
I would probably have like a listener and
if you're on that thing,

101
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.420
if that's the active element, you hit tab,
focus on the first one in view,

102
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.140
not the first one in the list.

103
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.530
That might be the approach I'd take.

104
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.727
Yeah?

105
00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:30.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: I was just checking
out that Starbucks site, and

106
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.820
I tried it in Firefox and it didn't,

107
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.620
the tab, the skipped navigation stuff,
in fact it just didn't work well.

108
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.350
I tried it in Safari.

109
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.940
It didn't work well either.

110
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.680
So, it makes you wonder.

111
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.864
Is that, I mean, their implementations or
what is going on there?

112
00:05:45.864 --> 00:05:46.643
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: I don't know,
it might be-

113
00:05:46.643 --> 00:05:47.721
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: It could be, and

114
00:05:47.721 --> 00:05:48.630
same with New York Times.

115
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.321
New York Times-
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: The skip link issue?

116
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:52.511
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: The skip link stuff.

117
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:53.580
I mean, Chrome is nice.

118
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.559
You get the nice highlight
of the elements.

119
00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:59.658
&gt;&gt; Jack: There are definitely
cross-browser issues,

120
00:05:59.658 --> 00:06:03.225
depending upon whether you're implementing
something like that through CSS or

121
00:06:03.225 --> 00:06:05.700
JavaScript, for example,
like his example earlier.

122
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.420
So that's an, what I would say that,
that is an opportunity to

123
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.236
try different solutions and see which
one's gonna be the most compatible.

124
00:06:14.236 --> 00:06:17.187
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, it definitely is
some kind of implementation thing though.

125
00:06:17.187 --> 00:06:20.922
Yeah I'd be interested to see what's
the current approach of doing, and

126
00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.860
maybe figuring out, there's a bug.

127
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.491
There's some cross browser thing
that you can, I'm sure find here.

128
00:06:27.491 --> 00:06:28.110
But I'm not sure.

129
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.488
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: But the question is
whether it's a bug on the site or

130
00:06:30.488 --> 00:06:31.714
is it a bug in the browser.

131
00:06:31.714 --> 00:06:33.150
&gt;&gt; Jack: Right, exactly.

132
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.171
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: That is the question.

133
00:06:34.171 --> 00:06:34.801
&gt;&gt; Group: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: But

134
00:06:34.801 --> 00:06:38.409
the answer is always you're gonna
have to do more work as a developer.

135
00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:40.750
[LAUGH] But yeah,
I'm not sure with this specific one.

136
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.139
But it would be something
good to look into.

137
00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:51.520
I'm a little bit wondering if If my cheap
little CSS skip link works in here or not.

138
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.770
This is the wrong branch.

139
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.020
Yeah it's interesting, and it gets even
more interesting when you're dealing with

140
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.086
discrepancies between screen readers,

141
00:07:03.086 --> 00:07:06.885
sometimes where it's like
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Nope,

142
00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:08.400
yeah mine doesn't work on here either.

143
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.770
Looks like Safari is really particular.

144
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.610
If you notice, Safari isn't even
letting me tab through my navigation.

145
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.794
Safari's only giving me my,
the URL bar and then my form.

146
00:07:17.794 --> 00:07:19.368
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Did you turn on that option?

147
00:07:19.368 --> 00:07:20.665
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: That's
what I was just wondering.

148
00:07:20.665 --> 00:07:25.119
I wonder if this was tied to the,
like, preferences keyboard, you know,

149
00:07:25.119 --> 00:07:26.515
something in there.

150
00:07:26.515 --> 00:07:31.232
I don't remember exactly,
it was like at the beginning of our.

151
00:07:31.232 --> 00:07:32.631
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Shortcuts.

152
00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:34.045
&gt;&gt; Jack: It's the third option.

153
00:07:34.045 --> 00:07:35.205
Is that-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: All controls.

154
00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:36.820
The bottom.

155
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:37.451
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Oops.

156
00:07:37.451 --> 00:07:38.718
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Very bottom.

157
00:07:38.718 --> 00:07:40.483
&gt;&gt; Jack: There you go.
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Nice.

158
00:07:40.483 --> 00:07:44.175
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: And then there's
a setting in Safari itself too.

159
00:07:44.175 --> 00:07:46.256
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Here we go, okay, cool.

160
00:07:46.256 --> 00:07:47.618
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Now you can
get to your buttons, yeah.

161
00:07:47.618 --> 00:07:48.874
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: But,
I still don't have my skip line.

162
00:07:49.875 --> 00:07:51.019
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Either.

163
00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:53.304
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: And still not the nav.

164
00:07:53.304 --> 00:07:55.216
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: And not your check,
I think check box is there for a second.

165
00:07:55.216 --> 00:07:57.430
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Check box is,
yeah, this is, yeah.

166
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:58.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I'm sorry,

167
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:02.840
go to the Safari preferences because there
is an additional Safari preferences.

168
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.430
I think, it's under advanced, I think.

169
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.649
Press tab key to highlight
each item on a webpage.

170
00:08:12.649 --> 00:08:15.656
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Boom, okay,
that's the Starbucks now.

171
00:08:15.656 --> 00:08:19.955
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So, that's the problem
with Safari, in particular,

172
00:08:19.955 --> 00:08:23.622
is that they have a second
layer of preference.

173
00:08:23.622 --> 00:08:26.241
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So, in order to get
Safari working, you gotta turn on your

174
00:08:26.241 --> 00:08:29.941
system preferences, then your Safari
preferences, both for tabbing through.

175
00:08:29.941 --> 00:08:33.496
But they do work now and I'd have to
look into Firefox about something,

176
00:08:33.496 --> 00:08:36.532
although I wonder if the system
setting would be enough too.

177
00:08:36.532 --> 00:08:39.012
I don't think I have
Firefox installed on here.

178
00:08:39.012 --> 00:08:42.050
But yeah, it's interesting,
really interesting, bummer, kind of.
