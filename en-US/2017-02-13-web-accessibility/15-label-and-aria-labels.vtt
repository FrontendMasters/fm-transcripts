WEBVTT

00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.580
&gt;&gt; Jon: So another thing as we're
getting into screen readers.

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.720
Labels for forms.

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.180
This is another, one of the things that's
a bummer, is that accessibility almost

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.950
never gets taught alongside HTML when
you're learning it in the first place.

5
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.280
And so
it leaves you with some weird stuff.

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.840
I remember learning about form labels.

7
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.070
And being like,
well why would I want that?

8
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.840
Especially if you learn now,
where there's cool placeholders,

9
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.230
where it's like you get a placeholder and
it disappears as you're typing.

10
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.245
But labels are really important for
screen readers, even if you

11
00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:33.705
visually hide them because you like
your placeholder, something like that.

12
00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:36.855
It's really important to have
a label that describes the field, so

13
00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:41.335
that as a user is tabbing through, they
know what they're supposed to do there.

14
00:00:41.335 --> 00:00:42.465
So this is a simple example.

15
00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:46.335
You can do label for and then you put
the idea of the thing it's labeling and

16
00:00:46.335 --> 00:00:47.845
then any string of text in there.

17
00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:50.155
So as the user tabs into it, it'll say.

18
00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:52.995
&gt;&gt; Jon: That's a terrible label.

19
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.990
It'll say click me.

20
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.910
It should say something like
enter your username, right?

21
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.100
And then you could have an input type
text for them to enter their username.

22
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.850
So whatever you want the screen
reader to announce to the user,

23
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.890
that's what goes on the label and
if you don't like the UI of the label,

24
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.190
it's fine to visually hide it but
they still should be there.

25
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Ben is asking are there ways
to do automated testing of what a screen

26
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.560
reader could read or
how it would navigate?

27
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.420
&gt;&gt; Jon: So at the end we'll cover
some automated testing stuff,

28
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.880
there's not an API to
detect screen reader usage.

29
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.910
There's no way to do that kind of stuff,
but there are,

30
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.460
just using code analysis, there are some
really great tools that will cover for

31
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.630
automated testing that'll spot these
things for you and help you avoid them.

32
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.064
And a lot of them can be plugged
into your CI job or whatever.

33
00:01:41.064 --> 00:01:44.165
So, yeah, we'll definitely
cover a bunch of that stuff,

34
00:01:44.165 --> 00:01:46.530
there's some really great stuff out there.

35
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.454
Cool, so another option is this
concept of aria-labelledby.

36
00:01:50.454 --> 00:01:53.730
So aria-labelledby, I say labeled by,

37
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.330
you can think of it as just kinda
the opposite of label, so label is for

38
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.180
an element and then an element could
be labeled by another element, right?

39
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.700
So here in this example
we've got a regular div and

40
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.450
then we have aria-labelledby name and so,

41
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.758
there's a couple of cool things
that I wanted to point out here.

42
00:02:14.758 --> 00:02:19.050
One, with aria-labelledby, you can pass in
multiple elements, which is really cool.

43
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.170
So you can see that the input type text,

44
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.500
this first one here,
it is the name field, which is important.

45
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.090
But it also belongs to a section of
the form called your billing address.

46
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.130
So, if you have, this is a good example,
if you have a different billing and

47
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.070
shipping address it's nice to communicate
to the user which name they're entering,

48
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.400
is it the buyer's name or
where it's going?

49
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.970
So, you can pass in multiple elements,

50
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.200
which can give you some really great
context, like billing address name,

51
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.360
billing address, address, something
like that, as opposed to name, address.

52
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.770
Another thing that's worth mentioning
here, is using aria-labelledby can

53
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.435
kind of get you away from having to
necessarily use that label element,

54
00:03:01.435 --> 00:03:06.680
cuz now you can have your paragraph, or
your div, or whatever you want, visually.

55
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.550
And still define that relationship.

56
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.670
Mostly I think I use aria-labelledby for
the multiple elements.

57
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.460
I just find that really helpful when you
have forms that are broken into sections.

58
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.110
Okay so
again more things off our nice check list.

59
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.890
Form elements.

60
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.440
Lets see, required form elements or form
elements that require a specific format

61
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.230
need to provide that within the label.

62
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.480
So again, if you have to fill it out or if
you have to fill it out in a certain way,

63
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.870
like a date that has to be month
month / year year / whatever.

64
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.280
However we do it in America, that both
of those things need to be in the label.

65
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.860
That is a required field
in how you fill it out.

66
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.170
That's Level 8 compliance.

67
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.500
And also, yeah,
just generally labels, queues, and

68
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.180
instructions for
any required interactive element.

69
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.920
So this, we kinda talked about this
a little bit before, but just the ideas,

70
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.660
instead of jus having this endless
list of input type text or

71
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.010
whatever, you give it labels.

72
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.720
So they know what's
supposed to go in there,

73
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.110
you can do labelledby stuff to give more
instruction, like how to fill it out or

74
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.450
specifically is it for billing or
shipping, things like that.

75
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.610
So pretty easy, just adding some
more HTML turns it into a really

76
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.400
robust application where,
as you're listening to a screen reader,

77
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.169
it's telling you everything you
need to fill out these forms.

78
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.320
Cool, so just.

79
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Comment?
&gt;&gt; Jon: Yeah, comment.

80
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Comment from Drew,
one nice bonus of

81
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.240
using actual labels is that clicking
the label focuses the corresponding field.

82
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.110
&gt;&gt; Jon: Yes,
is that not true with regular labels?

83
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.480
I thought that was true with both.

84
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.581
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: If you just
use a div it wouldn't.

85
00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:42.180
&gt;&gt; Jon: No, no, but
a div won't actually label.

86
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.350
Okay, yeah, so
I guess there's three approaches.

87
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.040
So one, which is a bad approach,
would be div, enter your name.

88
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.320
And then input type text.

89
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.330
That would be a bad approach,

90
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.740
because it's not very clear that
they're related to each other.

91
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.610
A good approach would either be div,
or I'm sorry, scratch that.

92
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.000
Label for name, enter your name, and
then div ID name or input ID name.

93
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.930
So that would work.

94
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.910
And then conversely,
you could do the opposite.

95
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.720
Or you could do a div,
with enter your name.

96
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.600
And then you could do input
ARIA labeled by a div.

97
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.170
But with a label,

98
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.140
clicking on the label should send you
into the form, into the input element.

99
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.830
But I think the trap is only when
you have them next to each other,

100
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.570
but they don't have
a defined relationship.

101
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.420
That's where you can
get into some trouble,

102
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.820
where they are one after another but
they're not connected.

103
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Another question from Ben.

104
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.470
&gt;&gt; Jon: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: For things like some help

105
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.560
text on a field, would it make
sense to include it in the label?

106
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.690
&gt;&gt; Jon: Yeah,
that can get kind of interesting.

107
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.750
So yeah, I think,
there's a few different things.

108
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.170
Because sometimes you have a ton of stuff,

109
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.470
a ton of information
about a certain thing.

110
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.350
So I think that whether or
not it's required and

111
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:58.500
also a format issue, how to fill something
in, would be really good additions there.

112
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.860
I think you might get into a little bit
more of a different approach if you have,

113
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.974
sometimes there's this like help text
that are like, why is this required?

114
00:06:06.974 --> 00:06:09.477
And it's, all businesses in this
state need to, you know what I mean,

115
00:06:09.477 --> 00:06:11.130
something like that.

116
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.940
In which since I think a label
wouldn't be the thing, but

117
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.240
you probably want something tabbable
there that you could interact with.

118
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.439
So I think it a little bit draws the line,
labels are really specific for that input.

119
00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:26.430
If it's general help text about, why fill
out this form or something like that.

120
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.020
I'd probably keep that
as a separate element.

121
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: This is from me.

122
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.360
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jon: [LAUGH]

123
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there something

124
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.610
you could do, for example,
when that area gets focused,

125
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.930
and then display that sort of thing?

126
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.905
&gt;&gt; Jon: Yeah, so yeah, you could do
all sorts of cool stuff like that.

127
00:06:38.905 --> 00:06:42.047
So you could have an on-focus
event on your thing

128
00:06:42.047 --> 00:06:46.417
that could maybe even let users,
for more information, hit this,

129
00:06:46.417 --> 00:06:50.700
you could also just have a tabable
element before or after it.

130
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.576
Probably before it, that was like you're
about to have to fill out this thing.

131
00:06:54.576 --> 00:06:58.850
Yeah, and
again the user should be able to access,

132
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.210
the same amount of stuff,
whether they're sided or not.

133
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.868
But it's a little bit up to you,
cuz I think the only thing you'd wanna

134
00:07:04.868 --> 00:07:09.085
worry about, is you don't want a user to
have to listen to three paragraphs of not

135
00:07:09.085 --> 00:07:11.595
necessary talking,
just to enter their name.

136
00:07:11.595 --> 00:07:12.435
You know what I mean,

137
00:07:12.435 --> 00:07:14.965
so that's where it might get a little
bit tricky if it's not required text.

138
00:07:15.985 --> 00:07:19.913
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I would also recommend the
using potentially the ARIA described by

139
00:07:19.913 --> 00:07:20.764
attributes.

140
00:07:20.764 --> 00:07:22.175
&gt;&gt; Jon: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So where you talked

141
00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:25.605
about maybe a piece of text
to follow the form element.

142
00:07:25.605 --> 00:07:28.237
You could use that to associate
it with the form element,

143
00:07:28.237 --> 00:07:32.670
such that the screen reader
will read the label first,

144
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.720
and there'll be a pause, and then
they'll hear the described by content.

145
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.910
&gt;&gt; Jon: Yeah, that's great,
yeah, so again, and yeah,

146
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.450
I think we'll be covering
that in a few slides.

147
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.500
But yeah, you can also use
the described by for after, so

148
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.080
yeah, that might be a really
good approach to it as well.
