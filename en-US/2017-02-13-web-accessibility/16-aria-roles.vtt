00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.920
&gt;&gt; Jon: Cool.
So there's also ARIA Roles, and so

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.080
basically what's going on,

3
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.670
I think these are actually part of HTML
more than they're part of the ARIA spec.

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.370
But roles are kinda back to what we
very first started on with a clue into

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.240
some of the functionality or interactivity
of a thing, what this thing does.

6
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.950
So a common thread with accessibility

7
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.960
which I think Jack
mentioned in the beginning.

8
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.369
People call it div soup, but Ilike
the idea of a lot of us learn HTML and

9
00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.705
divs make a really nice display block
generic element so we use it for

10
00:00:32.705 --> 00:00:34.397
absolutely everything.

11
00:00:34.397 --> 00:00:38.650
But even if you're gonna continue using
it, you can use a lot of these roles to

12
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.924
describe like,
this thing is like a navigation item, or

13
00:00:41.924 --> 00:00:45.810
this thing is a section, or
this thing is, so there's a list of them.

14
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.836
List items, list document groupings,
all these different things you can do.

15
00:00:50.836 --> 00:00:53.590
And they're kinda nice to experiment with
has you're listening to the screen or

16
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.450
either read your page, and
then you add some functionality to it.

17
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.780
And it'll sound a lot nicer.

18
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.084
Again, so a lot of times now what used to
be done with roles can now be done with

19
00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:05.650
native HTML5 elements.

20
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.018
But the roles still exist, and even
though it seems a little bit redundant,

21
00:01:10.018 --> 00:01:14.063
sometimes it's nice to do both to
have a fall back for older browsers.

22
00:01:14.063 --> 00:01:19.459
So, the cool thing with HTML5 elements
is that they degrade really nicely.

23
00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:23.287
So if you have a browser that
knows what an article is, great.

24
00:01:23.287 --> 00:01:24.633
Otherwise it'll just degrade into a div.

25
00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:26.308
So even though it seems redundant for

26
00:01:26.308 --> 00:01:28.424
a newer browser to have
article role article.

27
00:01:28.424 --> 00:01:32.714
It's nice because an older browser will
just turn it into div role article, so

28
00:01:32.714 --> 00:01:36.420
you still have all that context for
screen readers.

29
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.970
And that becomes less and
less of a problem as the browsers evolve,

30
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.350
because HTML5 is pretty well supported
now but just something to keep in mind.

31
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The other concern
is not just the browsers but

32
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.140
there are different types of assistive
technology that many of those users

33
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.720
are slow to upgrade,
either because it's costly or

34
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.540
even the manufacturers are slow to
upgrade that hardware or software.

35
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.606
And so that's another instance where
it becomes important to add that role.

36
00:02:01.606 --> 00:02:05.560
&gt;&gt; Jon: Yeah, so like even if Jaws maybe
supports all these nice HTML5 things,

37
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.990
there are a lot of people on
very older versions of it.

38
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.770
Which this would still be
a nice edition to have.

39
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.280
Yeah, I always recommend doing it Yeah.

40
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.310
I do find a lot for whatever the reason,
it's lot of people using s system

41
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.810
technology, are slower to update then,
than people not using a sys technology.

42
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.145
I have to imagine a lot of this,
it's difficulty updating as well,

43
00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:31.599
like getting a brand-new version
of everything when you do't have,

44
00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.800
we only makes every single
task that much more difficult.

45
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.430
But I do think probably
cost is a big part of it,

46
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.300
especially with some of
the more expensive pieces.

47
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.950
So yeah, I would always recommend doing
both the HTML5 element and the role.
