00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.230
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Some people were
reporting that the site was down,

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.760
the color picker,
that's like a real bummer.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.915
Some people put in some nice
other links in there, but

4
00:00:08.915 --> 00:00:12.800
[LAUGH]
Drew says, we took down both sites.

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.160
I think that might be accurate.

6
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.330
But anyway, so we can kind of
work through some of it together.

7
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.180
And then I just kind of wanted
to get people a feel for

8
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.250
checking out some color schemes and
things like that.

9
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.580
So if I, let's see,
think I had to close this.

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.598
If I open my file backup,
and go to Colors, cool.

11
00:00:34.598 --> 00:00:39.414
So you could do a couple of things, like
I might go and take, just to start off

12
00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:44.780
with that nav bar, or whatever, and
go find the hex codes that are being used.

13
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.628
Let's see if I can do anything with this,
nobody use the site.

14
00:00:49.628 --> 00:00:51.462
Look at that, they're get parameters,
I can work with that.

15
00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:54.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cheater.

16
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.603
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Yeah, okay,
cool, let's see if that loads.

17
00:00:57.603 --> 00:01:07.097
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: Come on, okay, cool.

18
00:01:07.097 --> 00:01:12.009
So yeah, I can see on these, so
basically, according to this analysis,

19
00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.513
small non-bold text,
it fails white on that blue.

20
00:01:15.513 --> 00:01:19.770
So if we were looking at my site here,
this contrast is not enough,

21
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.280
even in it's hovered state of white on
blue, considering the size that it's at.

22
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.400
So it is okay for
larger text like 1.5, or I'm sorry,

23
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.520
here it is, so 18 point or greater it's
fine, and bold it looks to be fine.

24
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.350
But then small non-bold text,
it does fail.

25
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.821
And I think these are really interesting,
because sometimes you look at some that

26
00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:43.650
are a little bit more contrived,
like if I go to my colors example.

27
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.480
Those are hard for visual,
for non-color impaired users,

28
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.690
but some of them look really good.

29
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.229
I mean this blue and white is one of
the most popular bootstrap themes, so

30
00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.290
its a little bit of a bummer to
find that its not accessible.

31
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.280
That people might have a hard
time differentiating the colors.

32
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.700
But again, these tools are really cool,
and can help with stuff like that.

33
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.560
And then, so kind of without
further ado then, let's see,

34
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.340
we've got more of our checklist items.

35
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.040
Yeah, this is big.

36
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.620
So color is not used as the sole
method of conveying content or

37
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.680
distinguishing visual elements.

38
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.590
A couple of big takeaways here, one
thing might be, it's not good enough to

39
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.810
change the label text from black to
red maybe, or something like that.

40
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.020
If it's invalid, you would need
just some other clue, like an X or

41
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.945
a underline or some way of indicating
some action on the user's behalf,

42
00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:44.995
if the user can't
differentiate between colors.

43
00:02:46.445 --> 00:02:50.215
And then the same with color can't be
the only thing that distinguishes links.

44
00:02:50.215 --> 00:02:53.675
So this gets back into design,
where by default links are underlined and

45
00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:55.160
paragraph text is not.

46
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.420
A lot of designers are like,
I don't want it.

47
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.438
I don't want that underline there just
make them blue, or something like that.

48
00:03:00.438 --> 00:03:03.300
But again, you're running into this issue,

49
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.730
if they're the same color depth,
then someone that is color blind won't

50
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.550
be able to necessarily distinguish
what's a link and what's not.

51
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.870
So you can make them bold.

52
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.980
You can make them, I don't know,
slightly bigger, slightly smaller.

53
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.150
You can go with the underline,
make your own underline.

54
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.240
You could even do things that are very,
very safe,

55
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.830
like completely different shades,
like a really lighter color.

56
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.590
But you can't just have the actual color
being the only distinguishing thing

57
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.100
to be compliant.

58
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.690
And it's just something to be aware of.
