00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.110
&gt;&gt; Jon Kuperman: So let's start off
back at the beginning of that list,

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.560
just talking about keyboards.

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.750
So one of the best things that you can do,
we mentioned two things, we mentioned

4
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.830
being able to use all the features
of your site with just a keyboard.

5
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.860
And then kind of on top of that
are the main workflow items,

6
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.190
can those be done relatively quickly?

7
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.500
So how many kind of keystrokes does
it take to get to a certain area?

8
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.550
So one of the biggest things that you
can do to make your site a lot easier

9
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.000
is add some sort of keyboard shortcuts.

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.090
So the common tasks that you do and
giving those a keyboard shortcut.

11
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.110
So for some examples, if you go to
Twitter and you hit question mark.

12
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.955
So, shift, question mark,
up pops this modal of keyboard shortcuts.

13
00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:45.865
And now these are single keys that you can
enter at any time on Twitter that will do

14
00:00:45.865 --> 00:00:46.534
actions.

15
00:00:46.534 --> 00:00:50.694
And you can kind of see here that almost
all, if not all of the main actions that

16
00:00:50.694 --> 00:00:54.180
can be taken can be done with at most,
two key strokes.

17
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.960
So again, keyboard only is great, you
should be able to tab down, do a Tweet,

18
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.410
and then favorite it or whatever, like it.

19
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.110
But then even better than that, is there
a short key to get to those Tweets or

20
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.170
do you have to tab through the whole
nav bar, things like that.

21
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.460
So all the big social networks have these.

22
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.070
Here's Facebook's, right,
it has their own as well.

23
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.870
And if you'll notice there, any vim users
out there will take comfort in the fact

24
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.110
that keyboard shortcuts almost
always follow the vim hjkl?,

25
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.580
and all those different things.

26
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.450
So that's kind of nice.

27
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.540
But either way, these are great, they're
always there and they can really help.

28
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.340
Make things easier, they also, and
a lot of this stuff, like I said,

29
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.390
applies to all users, these keyboard
shortcuts are also great for power users.

30
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.180
So, again, just offering a nice easy way
while you're already at your keyboard to

31
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.380
check your notifications,
or update a status, or

32
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.360
something like that are really nice.

33
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.380
If anybody's interested in
implementing them I have this library.

34
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.510
It's really minimal,
it's called shortcut, it's on my GitHub.

35
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.786
And basically it's just a zero
dependency keyboard shortcut generator.

36
00:02:03.786 --> 00:02:07.920
So it fires generic events like next item,
previous item, things like that.

37
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.850
And it's up to you to put your
application logic in those call backs.

38
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.270
What does next item mean,
things like that.

39
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.700
But, anyway, this library's free
to use and it's open source.
