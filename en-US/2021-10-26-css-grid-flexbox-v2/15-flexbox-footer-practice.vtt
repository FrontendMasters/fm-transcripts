00:00:00.136 --> 00:00:03.925
For your final challenge, I'd like you
to lay out the footer of this web page.

2
00:00:03.925 --> 00:00:06.071
So we have the mission and
the collection and

3
00:00:06.071 --> 00:00:09.268
then the footer is going to go down
here at the very, very bottom.

4
00:00:09.268 --> 00:00:13.324
And the footer is going to
include several elements here,

5
00:00:13.324 --> 00:00:18.633
we have some social media icons and
we have an address that's here in place.

6
00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:23.027
And so this is the way it should look,
at the very bottom of the webpage,

7
00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:27.881
stretched that yellow all the way across
the full width of the browser window.

8
00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:29.374
But line up the text and so

9
00:00:29.374 --> 00:00:33.087
forth in line with everything
else that's there on the page.

10
00:00:34.907 --> 00:00:37.904
Then when we go to a tablet,
this is the way it's going to look,

11
00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:39.956
we only have two columns
to work with here.

12
00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:44.241
So the Stay Connected will stay under
the first column, the Wall of Wonder.

13
00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:47.942
The address will go under the second
column and then finally, when we get to

14
00:00:47.942 --> 00:00:51.604
a mobile version of the site, just
stack everything on top of each other.

15
00:00:58.961 --> 00:01:03.343
So how'd you deal with the footer
challenge, hopefully you did all right,

16
00:01:03.343 --> 00:01:06.709
let's go through the answers
that I came up with for this.

17
00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:11.133
So we'll start here on line 63 and
you'll notice that I have sort

18
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:14.927
of an odd looking setup I have
a div with a class of footer.

19
00:01:14.927 --> 00:01:18.621
And then I have a footer element
by itself, why did I do this,

20
00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:21.744
well eventually that div
with the class of footer.

21
00:01:21.744 --> 00:01:26.214
Is the element that will stretch all the
way across the web page giving me yellow

22
00:01:26.214 --> 00:01:29.071
for one corner of the browser
window to the other.

23
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:32.819
And then the footer part of it is
going to contain my content and

24
00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:35.643
will have a max width
of 1200 pixels on it.

25
00:01:35.643 --> 00:01:37.970
You'll see that in just a moment and so

26
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.479
that'll keep everything in
line with what came before.

27
00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.401
So I've given us a div
with a class of social and

28
00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:49.033
the reason for that, why is this div here?

29
00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:52.274
Well, we have a div and
we have an address,

30
00:01:52.274 --> 00:01:56.611
remember we have to manage our parents and
our children.

31
00:01:56.611 --> 00:02:03.420
And so, if we set our footer element
to have our Flexbox Declaration on it,

32
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.189
any children after that will
be part of that layout.

33
00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:12.976
So what I really wanted to have happen
was I wanted to have the social there

34
00:02:12.976 --> 00:02:16.602
on the left hand side and
the address over on the right.

35
00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:21.747
So that is the reason why I needed
the div to wrap around the social

36
00:02:21.747 --> 00:02:26.528
information to make it one unit for
positioning purposes.

37
00:02:26.528 --> 00:02:32.555
So inside of that, this is an H4,
this is very far down on the webpage, we

38
00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:39.001
have an unordered list once again because
this is a list of social media icons.

39
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:42.151
And it's marked up as
such there they are and

40
00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:46.675
then we make use of the address
element down here at the bottom.

41
00:02:46.675 --> 00:02:49.206
This is of course a postal address and

42
00:02:49.206 --> 00:02:54.198
the address element is a wonderful
thing to be associated with address.

43
00:02:54.198 --> 00:02:58.414
Address can also be used though for
lots of other things, it can be used for

44
00:02:58.414 --> 00:03:00.184
any method of communication.

45
00:03:00.184 --> 00:03:04.410
Whether that happens to be phone numbers,
emails, social media,

46
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.577
it could be potentially used with
the social media, and so forth.

47
00:03:08.577 --> 00:03:11.686
Geographical coordinates are one of
the things that address can use,

48
00:03:11.686 --> 00:03:14.385
the other thing that's really
interesting about address.

49
00:03:14.385 --> 00:03:18.676
Is where you place it on the page
is an indication of whether this is

50
00:03:18.676 --> 00:03:23.293
the address for the website or
an address for the author of an article.

51
00:03:23.293 --> 00:03:27.294
So if the address is located
towards the bottom of the Web page,

52
00:03:27.294 --> 00:03:29.114
usually as part of a footer.

53
00:03:29.114 --> 00:03:33.926
That is an indicator that it's an address
for the organization or for the website.

54
00:03:33.926 --> 00:03:38.180
If you use the address element
in an article, for example,

55
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.648
then that address is generally associated
with the author of that article.

56
00:03:43.648 --> 00:03:47.772
All right, so then for
our styling portion of this,

57
00:03:47.772 --> 00:03:53.598
here we are around 159 in that ending CSS,
we have our class of footer.

58
00:03:53.598 --> 00:03:58.016
It has a background color of yellow,
it stretches all the way across the page

59
00:03:58.016 --> 00:04:00.995
because we're not putting
any constraints on it.

60
00:04:00.995 --> 00:04:06.541
And then inside of that, we have
the footer element itself with a max width

61
00:04:06.541 --> 00:04:11.737
of 1200 pixels, we've also declared
this as a display of flex.

62
00:04:11.737 --> 00:04:16.566
Then we add to this,
some additional styling notice that to

63
00:04:16.566 --> 00:04:20.827
get those two social media
icons next to each other.

64
00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:25.129
We needed yet
another round of Flexbox declaration, so

65
00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:31.088
here on the footer ul, I've displayed
flex again and a flex flow of row wrap.

66
00:04:31.088 --> 00:04:36.668
That's to put the two social media
icons next to each other and

67
00:04:36.668 --> 00:04:43.439
then down here's the little bit of
styling here for the rest of the footer.

68
00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:47.274
Their basic stuff,
we have our footer address, by default,

69
00:04:47.274 --> 00:04:52.305
the address displays italic, so we needed
to turn that off that style of normal.

70
00:04:52.305 --> 00:04:56.605
With a margin top and then I threw
on a font weight of bold, okay,

71
00:04:56.605 --> 00:04:58.848
as we get into the media queries.

72
00:04:58.848 --> 00:05:01.494
I don't think a whole lot changes in here,

73
00:05:01.494 --> 00:05:04.589
it's pretty straightforward
with the address.

74
00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:09.110
I did turn off a little bit of margin that
was on the on the top of the address.

75
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.223
We needed that on mobile when they
were stacked on top of each other and

76
00:05:12.223 --> 00:05:13.843
we needed that little bit of space.

77
00:05:13.843 --> 00:05:15.307
But when we go to the tablet,

78
00:05:15.307 --> 00:05:18.299
that little bit of space makes
these things look crooked.

79
00:05:18.299 --> 00:05:21.991
So we need to get rid of that
to bring the Mac together and

80
00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:23.928
make them on the same level.

81
00:05:23.928 --> 00:05:28.606
We've also changed some Flexspaces
values over here as part of

82
00:05:28.606 --> 00:05:31.440
the final desktop based media query.
