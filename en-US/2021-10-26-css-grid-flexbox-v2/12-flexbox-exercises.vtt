00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.235
So what I'd like for you to work on
next is this four part or sorry,

2
00:00:04.235 --> 00:00:06.050
three part series of items.

3
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.075
There's a collections piece,
a mission piece, and a footer,

4
00:00:11.075 --> 00:00:16.945
and so the goal here is to do a whole
bunch of layouts with Flexbox.

5
00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:19.389
And I've thrown in a couple
of other little tidbits for

6
00:00:19.389 --> 00:00:21.844
some of you who may be a little
bit more advanced in CSS.

7
00:00:21.844 --> 00:00:27.020
Or who wanna go and
read up on some additional CSS properties.

8
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.319
So, let's take a look at
what these look like and

9
00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.140
we're gonna switch to VS code to do this.

10
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.784
So inside these are files
that are from GitHub,

11
00:00:37.784 --> 00:00:40.870
you can download them
put them into VS code.

12
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.070
And so I'm in folder 4a, so

13
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.028
under folder 4 Flexbox dot
exercises folder 4a collections,

14
00:00:48.028 --> 00:00:52.790
you'll see here I've given
you a bunch of screenshots.

15
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.530
We'll start with the first screenshot,
this is the collections piece.

16
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.123
So all of these assets are here and

17
00:00:59.123 --> 00:01:02.649
available to you inside
of the begin folder.

18
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.532
So if you look inside of begin,
I've given you a starting style sheet,

19
00:01:07.532 --> 00:01:11.220
I've given you all of the images
in the dimensions that you need.

20
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.480
And I've given you a starting HTML web
page here, it's all marked up for you.

21
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.385
And what I'd like for
you to do is to build this out so

22
00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:23.640
that your collections page looks
like this set a desktop dimension.

23
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.755
And I think I've put in the media
queries for you too, so

24
00:01:25.755 --> 00:01:27.160
you don't have to worry about that.

25
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.470
At a tablet dimension, we're going to go
to two images across instead of three.

26
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.922
Then in a mobile dimension,

27
00:01:34.922 --> 00:01:38.330
we're going to go to one image
stacked all the way down the page.

28
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.242
So that'll be challenge number
one is to go through and

29
00:01:41.242 --> 00:01:43.026
lay out this collections piece.

30
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.201
Then in challenge number two 4b,
this is the mission,

31
00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:56.244
we're gonna,
I have sort of two alternatives.

32
00:01:56.244 --> 00:02:01.573
So if you are more of a Flexbox beginner,
this is one way of approaching this.

33
00:02:01.573 --> 00:02:06.380
So this is the mission section of the page
that should go on top of the collections

34
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.787
piece that you're gonna build and,
whoops, sorry, looks like this.

35
00:02:10.787 --> 00:02:14.323
This is how it should look if you
are more of a Flexbox beginner so

36
00:02:14.323 --> 00:02:16.943
you have a logo and
you have the text next to it.

37
00:02:16.943 --> 00:02:21.046
Notice how it all lines up really
nicely here on the desktop, right so

38
00:02:21.046 --> 00:02:24.060
that logo is as big as
the column underneath of it.

39
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.938
The text here lines up with what the other
images that are over here, underneath.

40
00:02:29.938 --> 00:02:35.830
Then we're going to go to our tablet
dimension, continues to look like that.

41
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.927
And then we can go to our mobile dimension
where we have the text on top and

42
00:02:39.927 --> 00:02:41.470
the logo underneath.

43
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.642
Now if you are a more advanced CSS coder,

44
00:02:44.642 --> 00:02:48.947
then you might wanna read up
a little bit on CSS shapes.

45
00:02:48.947 --> 00:02:51.593
And you could code this
a little bit differently,

46
00:02:51.593 --> 00:02:55.060
these are just the one here
called desktop that PNG.

47
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.650
Notice here how I've made the text
go down the slant of that logo,

48
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.650
is that a cool effect?

49
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.760
So, this is something that you can take
a look at and how do we approach here?

50
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.118
So that would be the desktop
version of that and

51
00:03:09.118 --> 00:03:14.451
then the tablet version looks like that
and then finally the mobile version.

52
00:03:17.824 --> 00:03:20.880
Put the logo on the top and
put the text underneath.

53
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.852
So a hint here,
if you decide to take this route,

54
00:03:23.852 --> 00:03:26.402
this would not be a Flexbox based layout.

55
00:03:26.402 --> 00:03:31.230
We're gonna be doing something with a
float, so you need to float the image and

56
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.200
you CSS shapes to make that cool
slant along the edge of the logo.

57
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.770
And then the last one is a footer layout.

58
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.088
So underneath the collections
down here at the bottom,

59
00:03:45.088 --> 00:03:48.978
we're gonna set up a layout where
we've got the stay connected.

60
00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:52.786
We've got links to Facebook and
Instagram, and we have our address for

61
00:03:52.786 --> 00:03:53.873
the wall of wonder.

62
00:03:53.873 --> 00:03:58.103
And then we're gonna go
to our tablet layout,

63
00:03:58.103 --> 00:04:03.320
which looks like this and
then our mobile layout, okay.

64
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.545
So if you're feeling a little
overwhelmed by all of those things,

65
00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:10.340
here's what I would recommend for
those of you who are beginners.

66
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.824
The collections is probably
the best one to spend your time on,

67
00:04:13.824 --> 00:04:17.720
if you're limited in the amount of
time you have time to spend on this.

68
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.721
That will get you a lot of learning
going from three images across,

69
00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:24.441
the two images across
to one image on mobile.

70
00:04:24.441 --> 00:04:26.910
That would be the first
thing that I would work on.

71
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.576
If you're a beginner,

72
00:04:28.576 --> 00:04:33.506
and you just wanna code up the mission
element really, really quick.

73
00:04:33.506 --> 00:04:36.966
You can probably get that done really
fast based on the code that you write for

74
00:04:36.966 --> 00:04:37.980
collections.

75
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.590
The mission should go together really
fast and then work on the footer last.

76
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.020
If you are not sure about
that whole CSS shapes thing,

77
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.320
you might just go from the collections
down to the footer and

78
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.840
then come back to the shapes
there at the end.
