00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.305
So, if you hop into the website for
the course,

2
00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:09.362
which is at front of masters
dot GitHub that IO slash grid

3
00:00:09.362 --> 00:00:16.160
hyphen Flexbox hyphen V2, take a look
at the Flexbox introduction item.

4
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.060
That's the first one on the list there.

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.630
I just went through
the slides that are there.

6
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.860
So you have a copy of the slides
we're gonna come back and

7
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.380
revisit those momentarily when
we talk about Flexbox Grid.

8
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.027
And then what we're going to look
at next is the starting code pen.

9
00:00:32.027 --> 00:00:36.595
So, let's go ahead and code and we're
going to start with this particular code

10
00:00:36.595 --> 00:00:39.132
pen the link is there
inside of the website.

11
00:00:39.132 --> 00:00:43.831
So, what I have here is some very
simple HTML and some starting CSS.

12
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:47.002
So, let's see what we've got
here to get us started and

13
00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:50.926
then we can look at each of these
Flexbox properties independently.

14
00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:55.823
Part of the problem is that we all wanna
rush into making beautiful web pages

15
00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:59.010
without understanding all
of the properties and

16
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.200
values that are available to us.

17
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.979
So, if you build a little system
like this, it isn't supposed to

18
00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.379
be pretty that's supposed to simply
demonstrate those properties to you,

19
00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:13.043
you'll get a much better sense
of how all of these things work.

20
00:01:13.043 --> 00:01:17.923
So, here in my HTML I have a bulleted
list a UL followed by a bunch of LIs and

21
00:01:17.923 --> 00:01:22.323
I have only two classes in here on
the second and the fifth bullet,

22
00:01:22.323 --> 00:01:26.500
I have a class of flex to,
some of these bullets have numbers.

23
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.860
Some of them have a little bit of text.

24
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.000
Okay.

25
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.120
So, very, very simple HTML to work with.

26
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.000
In our CSS, we have the setup
a little bit differently.

27
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.770
First of all,
we start with the border box model.

28
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.624
If you're not familiar with the border
box, the way that CSS is configured,

29
00:01:44.624 --> 00:01:47.386
it starts off with a so
called Content box and

30
00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:52.720
it has to do with how we determine
the value of the CSS property width.

31
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.571
Are we going to include the width of
the border and the width of the padding,

32
00:01:57.571 --> 00:02:02.965
plus the width of the content to determine
the value of that property called width.

33
00:02:02.965 --> 00:02:07.820
Or are we just gonna say it's
the width of the content itself.

34
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.962
So, content box says the width
of the content itself,

35
00:02:10.962 --> 00:02:14.104
is the value of the width property,
the border box says

36
00:02:14.104 --> 00:02:19.740
let's include the border and the padding
as well, to determine the value of width.

37
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.090
And it is much easier for
math if you use the border box.

38
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.449
And so,
this is the declaration that you use,

39
00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.280
you simply say the box
sizing is border box.

40
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.840
It doesn't inherit by default.

41
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.778
So, the next declaration and you say
universally, the entire universe and

42
00:02:36.778 --> 00:02:40.483
everything that comes before
the universe and after it,

43
00:02:40.483 --> 00:02:44.960
inherent the box sizing and
then you don't have to worry about it.

44
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.133
After that we just have
a body declaration,

45
00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:52.060
we declared a font we remove
the margin and padding.

46
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.850
Some browsers have margin,
some browsers have padding.

47
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.615
It's responsible for the tiny little box
you see around the edges of web pages if

48
00:02:59.615 --> 00:03:02.956
they don't go all the way out
to the edges of the screen,

49
00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:07.060
this is the reason why edge or
margin and padding zero those out.

50
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.000
And we set font size.

51
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.133
And then here UL,
we've turned off our padding,

52
00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:16.400
we put in a little bit of margin
to make look pretty in a border.

53
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.590
We gave it a width and a height.

54
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.345
And then finally down here in our LI,

55
00:03:21.345 --> 00:03:26.147
we've set up a border a background
color a min width and a height,

56
00:03:26.147 --> 00:03:30.450
so, pretty standard stuff
nothing exciting here so far.
