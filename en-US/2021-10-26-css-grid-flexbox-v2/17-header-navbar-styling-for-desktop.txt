>> Okay, so let's get this styling here. I'm gonna set this up just after section UL here around line 52, let's go ahead and put on our header and nav styles here, header and navs styles. Okay,and we'll give ourselves a little bit more room. There we go. Okay, so, we'll start with that header.

[00:00:34]
The title class, and let's assign its background- color, that's gonna be var colored number five, the light yellow. So, that'll give us a nice light yellow bar across, outside of the web page. And if we refresh, you should now see yellow there at the top. You'll also see a little bit of green above that and some other things, one step at a time.

[00:01:00]
That strip of green on the top is coming from the URL, which has a bit of margin associated with it, at least on my Firefox browser here, is sometimes it's got padding associated with it instead. So, we'll turn that off here in just a moment. So, we'll start here with the header itself.

[00:01:26]
And inside of the header HTML element, then we can set up some padding like one rem just so we don't run into the edges of our web page, we can set our max width of 1200 pixels, which we've been doing with all of the sections to this point.

[00:01:41]
Now we're doing it with the header as well, we also did it with the footer. And then we can center this with margin, 0 auto. So, that'll push this to the center of the page and it will line up with all of our other sections in the footer, very, very nicely.

[00:01:58]
So, to show you that that's true, I don't think we're gonna see a huge change here. So, things sort of push over a little bit, so, that's how it looks now. All right, then we're on our way to our navigation And we're gonna do the universal stuff Across the breakpoints.

[00:02:35]
And so, here we're going to do is a nav URL, turn off the bullets list style. Type. Non-margin 0 padding 0. They really ought to just make a single property for all of this cuz you do this all the time. Anytime you're working with a list that you don't wanna look like a bulleted list, these are the three things you gotta do.

[00:03:06]
Then, let's continue on here. nav, url, dsplay, flex, flex flow, row wrap, justify content, space around Space around, there we go. All right, lets check in and see how that's going so far. So, if we just refresh this, immediately what you'll have is you'll have this, start over navigation bar.

[00:03:52]
Just by putting in that tiny little bit of flexbox, we removed the bullets so those are gone by putting in a little bit of flexbox. We made the navbar go horizontal across the page. And by using the space around, or we could have used space between, that pushes everything, all these navigation items.

[00:04:13]
And remember the logo was the navigation item pushes these all out evenly here on the page. So, not bad so far. If you wanted at this point in time, you could do things like the following. So, we could say something like nav ul first child. Remember that logo is the first child there in the navigation.

[00:04:40]
We could say margin, right, auto. So, put the free space over there on that side. And if we changed our justify content to something, I don't know flex end, okay? What do you think that will do? If you have your logo the first child, and we have a margin on the right of auto, and we're going to justify our content to the flex end.

[00:05:10]
That should put the logo on the left and the navigation on the right, correct? So, let's take a look at that. Little bit of work to do on those navigation items, but the shape is there, right, we have the logo on the left, we have the navigation on the right.

[00:05:29]
So, it's one of the cool things that we can do with Flexbox. If that is something you were looking to, that would be very easy to do that way. Okay, but that's not what we're doing here. Okay, let me just write a couple more styles here for some generic styling for these links.

[00:05:45]
And then I'm gonna go to the desktop and we'll continue on with the desktop particular layout. So, but we have to style up our links first here outside of the media queries. So, for the links themselves, text decoration, text decoration of none, always turn off your underlines and the navigation.

[00:06:09]
Font size 1.2rem, it looks a little small, make it a little bigger, color of. Bar. Let's do color 1, so, we'll make them black by default. And then display block, always display your links as block when you were inside of a navigation bar. And again, this has to do with taking your link and pushing its edges all the way out to whatever clickable area you're going to wind up having inside of your navigation bar.

[00:06:51]
This will help with again fingers on mobile, it will help people with issues and disabilities surrounding their mouse being able to get to those particular items. There's no downside to this. So, set your navigation to display block there for the links. We'll give it some padding. So, now I'm gonna go all the way down here.

[00:07:13]
Actually, first, let me save this and show you what it looks like so far. Okay, so this is what it looks like so far. We've kinda got it in the center of the page is a little bit weird. There's some issues and things going on, we'll address all of that here just a moment.

[00:07:34]
Down here at the bottom, at the desktop media query, so 800 pixels and higher. Let's add some more stuff here. So, we wanna put the logo in the center, navigation logo in the center. So to do that, we're gonna say our nav ul, I'm gonna say this again, justify, content, flex and I think I just set it up on the mobile side of it, but we'll eventually change that on the mobile.

[00:08:04]
So, I'm gonna restate it down here on the desktop. Then I'm gonna say nav li, first child. Yes, you could do this with a class instead, but this is a very efficient selector. We don't have to make any classes, it's the first child is the logo, so we're fine.

[00:08:24]
We're gonna say our flexbasis is auto we will wind up setting the flex basis later on when we're at the tablet or the mobile dimensions. So, we wanna turn off that flex basis for just the logo. And we'll set our margin to 0 auto. So, that'll center it, and then we'll set our order to 2, so then we have our nav, Li:nth-child, 2 And our nav li nth child 3.

[00:09:09]
These two elements, which again you can do this with a class if you'd like. We're gonna say their order, is 1, then nav, we're just gonna copy that whole style again. So, this will be number four and number five, we'll set the order to be three. So by doing this, we've called out our first two text navigation items, we've said that they're gonna be order one.

[00:09:43]
We've called out our last two navigation items and said they're gonna be order three. And we set everything to do flex end, but yet we told the logo we wanted in the middle, and we set our margin to auto. So, what will wind up happening is that our navigation will get pushed all the way out to the very edges of the navigation bar, and the logo will show up there very nicely in the middle.

[00:10:06]
So, let's see what that looks like. Just like that. All right, so there's collections and about then we have our world of wonder and then we have contact and donations.
