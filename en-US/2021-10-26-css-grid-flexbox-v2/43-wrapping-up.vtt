00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.790
So I hope that you have
enjoyed the course today.

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.755
And we have looked at all kinds
of interesting ways of working

3
00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:09.155
with both Flexbox and

4
00:00:09.155 --> 00:00:14.470
Grid, they can be combined, they can
be nested one inside of each other.

5
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.182
And I hope that some of the work that
you've looked at here have inspired you to

6
00:00:19.182 --> 00:00:23.822
think more and more deeply about the types
of layouts that you can make on your

7
00:00:23.822 --> 00:00:27.930
webpages and how those might
change across media queries.

8
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.783
And if you like this course,
the next one that might make sense for

9
00:00:31.783 --> 00:00:34.620
you to watch would be our
CSS advanced layouts.

10
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.454
Which is here at Front End Masters and
goes through layouts that

11
00:00:39.454 --> 00:00:45.380
are leveraging things like Calc and
CSS custom properties or variables.

12
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.981
It also looks at things like hamburger
buttons built only with CSS, and

13
00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:51.502
it does some work with
responsive tables as well,

14
00:00:51.502 --> 00:00:55.600
all of that would be a great next step for
you once you've watched this course.

15
00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.095
Thanks again
&gt;&gt; This person's asking about making

16
00:01:00.095 --> 00:01:06.660
the resume or like,
allowing it to be downloaded and shared.

17
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.160
&gt;&gt; Okay?

18
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.413
So for your resume if you want it to be
downloaded, like somebody wants to save it

19
00:01:13.413 --> 00:01:18.100
to their computer, unfortunately a PDF
is probably the best way to do that.

20
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.750
That's gonna preserve all
your formatting and stuff.

21
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.922
Another way that you could do that
that might be helpful would be to look

22
00:01:25.922 --> 00:01:32.600
at print styles, CSS print styles,
which are I mean, they're similar at CSS.

23
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.950
But it's designed to set up your webpage
such that it's supposed to be printed.

24
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.478
And so when you put it into the print
format inside of your browser,

25
00:01:42.478 --> 00:01:44.500
it could look completely different.

26
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.850
You can take the color out of it.

27
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.310
You could set things up to display in
columns, you can put in page breaks.

28
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.010
There's all kinds of interesting
things that you can do.

29
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.700
With a printed layout, so
that might be another possibility for you.

30
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.605
But Grid is not necessarily gonna address
the ability to download a resume.

31
00:02:00.605 --> 00:02:04.301
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've seen people like
make a print style sheet and

32
00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:08.844
then you click print, you're on it and
then you can just like print and

33
00:02:08.844 --> 00:02:12.070
then save that as a PDF and
make that available.

34
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.850
&gt;&gt; Yep, absolutely that's true so yeah,
when you go to at least for the Mac,

35
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.150
when you go and you say print,
one of the options is print to a PDF.

36
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.089
And if you have some good print CSS
print styles in place, then that will,

37
00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:29.520
in theory put together a document that
will look great for somebody to download.
