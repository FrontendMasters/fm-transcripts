00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.730
So I hope that you have
enjoyed the course today.

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.447
And as we have looked at all kinds
of interesting ways of working with

3
00:00:07.447 --> 00:00:10.695
both Flexbox and grid,
they can be combined.

4
00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:14.536
They can be nested one
inside of each other.

5
00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:19.321
And I hope that some of the work that
you've looked at here have inspired

6
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:24.265
you to think more deeply about the types
of layouts that you can make on your

7
00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:28.295
web pages and how those might
change across media queries.

8
00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:32.623
And if you liked this course the next
one that might make sense for

9
00:00:32.623 --> 00:00:37.353
you to watch would be our CSS advanced
layouts which is here at frontend

10
00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:42.327
masters and goes through layouts that
are leveraging things like Calc and

11
00:00:42.327 --> 00:00:44.922
CSS custom properties or variables.

12
00:00:44.922 --> 00:00:48.866
It also looks at things like hamburger
buttons built only with CSS and

13
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.724
it does some work with
responsive tables as well.

14
00:00:51.724 --> 00:00:55.231
All of that would be a great next step for
you once you've watched this course.

15
00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:56.769
Thanks again.

16
00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.614
&gt;&gt; This person's asking
about making the resume or

17
00:01:01.614 --> 00:01:06.234
like allowing it to be downloaded and
shared.

18
00:01:06.234 --> 00:01:10.770
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah so, for your resume,
if you want it to be downloaded,

19
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.180
like somebody wants to
save it to their computer.

20
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.784
Unfortunately a PDF is probably
the best way to do that that's gonna

21
00:01:18.784 --> 00:01:21.631
preserve all your formatting and stuff.

22
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:26.650
Another way that you can do that that
might be helpful would be to look at

23
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.012
print styles, CSS print styles which
are I mean they're similar at CSS but

24
00:01:32.012 --> 00:01:37.568
it's designed to set up your web page
such that it's supposed to be printed.

25
00:01:37.568 --> 00:01:41.950
And so when you put it into the print
format inside of your browser,

26
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.464
it could look completely different.

27
00:01:44.464 --> 00:01:45.184
You could take the color out of it.

28
00:01:45.184 --> 00:01:47.274
You could set things up
to display in columns.

29
00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:48.893
You can put in page breaks.

30
00:01:48.893 --> 00:01:54.053
There's all kinds of interesting things
that you can do with a printed layout,

31
00:01:54.053 --> 00:01:57.066
so that might be another possibility for
you.

32
00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:01.763
But grid is not necessarily gonna address
the ability to download a resume.

33
00:02:01.763 --> 00:02:06.264
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've seen people like make a
print stylesheet and then you click print,

34
00:02:06.264 --> 00:02:10.359
you're on it and then you can just like
print and then save that as a PDF and

35
00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:11.650
make that available.

36
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.212
&gt;&gt; Yep, absolutely.

37
00:02:13.212 --> 00:02:14.896
That's true.
So yeah, when you go to,

38
00:02:14.896 --> 00:02:16.800
at least on the Mac, when you go and

39
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.521
you say print one of
the options is print to a PDF.

40
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:24.746
And if you have some good print CSS print
styles in place then that will in theory

41
00:02:24.746 --> 00:02:29.510
put together a document that will
look great for somebody to download.
