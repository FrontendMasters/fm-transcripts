00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.780
So I hope you had fun with that particular
exercise building your own inside page

2
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.420
based on some of the materials
that I gave you.

3
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.789
I'm gonna talk through my particular
answer using the mosaic style layout and

4
00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.096
then we had that one grid cell
that had the text inside of it So

5
00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:19.050
let's take a quick peek into
how I put that page together.

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.380
In the HTML what I've done is recycled
the headers that I had from the previous

7
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.063
layout, of the website and
all of the CSS that went along with that.

8
00:00:29.063 --> 00:00:33.754
So that is the header and I kept down here
the footer of the webpage as well which we

9
00:00:33.754 --> 00:00:36.760
coded in the flexbox
portion of the course.

10
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.023
These two particular layouts,
the header and

11
00:00:39.023 --> 00:00:41.002
the footer work really well in flexbox.

12
00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:44.397
I didn't really feel the need to
recode those inside of grids, so

13
00:00:44.397 --> 00:00:46.290
I just left them alone.

14
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.051
The concept of a series of rows
stacked on top of each other,

15
00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:53.376
worked with this particular
design of the website.

16
00:00:53.376 --> 00:00:56.170
So I kept that concept as well.

17
00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.292
And so that meant that here inside of
the content portion of this web page,

18
00:01:02.292 --> 00:01:05.371
I've set it up in the following way.

19
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:08.990
So I have a section,
I give it an ID of donut.

20
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.867
Here is the title of that section
Sharon McCutchin, donut love.

21
00:01:12.867 --> 00:01:19.850
And then we have a series of images inside
of an unordered list as you would expect.

22
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.598
So here's my unordered list.

23
00:01:21.598 --> 00:01:25.895
I have a list item,
I've given them a class of d1 to d5,

24
00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:28.688
as in donut one to donut number five.

25
00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:32.707
And we have images here with
the images themselves and

26
00:01:32.707 --> 00:01:36.012
then the description
that goes with them and

27
00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:41.662
the descriptions are all the same,
they're just donuts with sprinkles.

28
00:01:41.662 --> 00:01:46.609
Inside of number three,
I added a div with a class of author,

29
00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:52.723
it's an h3 for that particular heading
along with that particular text.

30
00:01:52.723 --> 00:01:55.410
And the links and so
forth are all inside of it.

31
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.802
That div with a class
of author once again as

32
00:01:59.802 --> 00:02:05.475
always managing our parents and
children here.

33
00:02:05.475 --> 00:02:10.485
We have that div and
we have then after it the image.

34
00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:15.542
So that means that within this li we
can use grid to orient the text and

35
00:02:15.542 --> 00:02:18.310
the image on top of each other.

36
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.880
And then they can separate
at smaller screen sizes.

37
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.432
So that's the technique that I use
here with the overlapping grid cells.

38
00:02:26.432 --> 00:02:29.713
All the rest of them are pretty
much the same the li

39
00:02:29.713 --> 00:02:32.285
with the the donut image inside of it.

40
00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:35.417
Now let's look at the CSS.

41
00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:44.025
And so here in the CSS, outside all
the media queries, we have the following.

42
00:02:44.025 --> 00:02:49.609
So, I have a donut image, I set that
to it's hack, a width of a 100%.

43
00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:54.728
The ul winds up being my grid parent or
the grid container.

44
00:02:54.728 --> 00:02:57.844
And the li's wind up being my grid items.

45
00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:03.578
So here outside of the media queries
all I've said is display as grid with

46
00:03:03.578 --> 00:03:09.879
a one REM gap and one single column of
one fraction wide, that's all I did here.

47
00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.176
And specifically for d3,
I set it on its own row.

48
00:03:14.176 --> 00:03:20.105
So make sure it displays on the first
row of that particular cell.

49
00:03:20.105 --> 00:03:22.224
Then as we go into the media queries

50
00:03:23.685 --> 00:03:28.694
Down around line 476 in the CSS,
this is where all of that starts.

51
00:03:28.694 --> 00:03:33.083
So here, for the donut ul,
I've set up my two columns with

52
00:03:33.083 --> 00:03:37.395
a minimum of 100 pixels and
a maximum of one fraction.

53
00:03:37.395 --> 00:03:40.314
Because I want my donuts
to be big enough and

54
00:03:40.314 --> 00:03:45.760
then I've spelled out exactly where I
want each one of those images to display.

55
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.760
So I'm not anticipating
an unknown number of images.

56
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.902
This is an art site, I have five images,

57
00:03:51.902 --> 00:03:54.359
those are the five that
we're gonna display.

58
00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.099
And I've set them up to display
in a lovely sort of way.

59
00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.987
So the interesting part of all
of this winds up being d3,

60
00:04:01.987 --> 00:04:07.417
which is as I told you is possible before,
both a grid item and a grid container.

61
00:04:07.417 --> 00:04:13.692
So, the first two, the grid column and
the grid row, make it a grid item.

62
00:04:13.692 --> 00:04:17.900
And that's indicating where it's
gonna display in the grid pattern.

63
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.950
And then inside of d3,
we also have its own grid where we

64
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.906
have one column and
one row as I have showed you before.

65
00:04:27.906 --> 00:04:32.003
So the d3 image and
the author will both occupy that

66
00:04:32.003 --> 00:04:36.820
same single row in the single
column that I had set up.

67
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.775
Then I give my image and opacity of 0.2
such that my text becomes readable and

68
00:04:41.775 --> 00:04:46.226
the image just sort of whites out
a little bit there in the background.

69
00:04:46.226 --> 00:04:49.880
And then make sure that
the author text shows up on top.

70
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.894
Give it a little bit of padding,
give it a z-index so

71
00:04:52.894 --> 00:04:55.645
it shows up on top of the image and
not behind it.

72
00:04:55.645 --> 00:04:57.410
That's really important.

73
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.776
When you take a look at this because
of the opacity, without the z-index,

74
00:05:01.776 --> 00:05:03.520
let me show you what happens.

75
00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:11.280
If we just did that much there, let me
show you this in the default browser.

76
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.576
So this is coded up
with a couple of links.

77
00:05:13.576 --> 00:05:17.145
But notice that because of
the opacity of the image,

78
00:05:17.145 --> 00:05:21.940
it looks like you can read this
text just fine, it's no big deal.

79
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.149
But the links are unclickable unless

80
00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:31.356
you add that bit of CSS there.

81
00:05:31.356 --> 00:05:37.337
So if we put in that z-index and
then refresh our webpage,

82
00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:41.070
now those become clickable links.

83
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.992
So, even if it looks right,
make sure you test it,

84
00:05:44.992 --> 00:05:48.202
make sure you can mouse over those links.

85
00:05:48.202 --> 00:05:51.878
Make sure that they
are actually clickable.

86
00:05:51.878 --> 00:05:54.370
Otherwise you need to adjust your z-index
