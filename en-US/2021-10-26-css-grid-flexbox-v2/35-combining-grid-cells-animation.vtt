00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.224
Because grid allows cells to overlap
each other, there's more that you

2
00:00:05.224 --> 00:00:09.339
can do here besides just what I
just showed you with figure and

3
00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:14.769
figure caption overlapping cells and
putting in a little bit of transparency.

4
00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.440
And the 11 bonus code pen which
is available from the website.

5
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.524
Here I have an actual animation
that's going on here and

6
00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:31.229
we have in this case two images of cats
that are fading one into the other and

7
00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:35.786
I have coded this with CSS Grid and
CSS animation.

8
00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:40.642
So I'll just talk you through a little bit
about how this is set up so you can see

9
00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:45.821
how this is done I'm not saying it's a
perfect solution or a beautiful solution.

10
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:50.061
Clearly there, we could add some UI here
with something like JavaScript to give

11
00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:53.070
user more control over what's going on.

12
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.322
But this is just to generate some interest
in overlapping grid cells and to get you

13
00:00:57.322 --> 00:01:01.720
thinking about other ways that you might
be able to use them in your own work.

14
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.792
So here we have, in our HTML,
we have two figures and

15
00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:08.950
I've given one of them a class of cat1.

16
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.758
And they're basically set up the way that
you've seen figures set up throughout

17
00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:14.400
this course.

18
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.830
We have an image and we have a figure
caption just as you've seen before.

19
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.014
So what we're doing here
In our HTML is here

20
00:01:25.014 --> 00:01:30.198
at cat one that is going
to be our wrapper for

21
00:01:30.198 --> 00:01:37.970
this particular animation so
this is the figure itself.

22
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.649
We're adding the animation so on the
wrapper we have a layout that's going on.

23
00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.163
That's right here display
grid with a gap of 1% and

24
00:01:49.163 --> 00:01:55.230
then I have said for
my figures I overlap them I both figures.

25
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.430
Take the same style here,
where I've said the grid row and

26
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.531
the grid column are exactly the same.

27
00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:05.105
It's a one cell grid, one column one row,
and these are going to

28
00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:10.530
overlap each other and I set a width
on it because this is an image.

29
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.010
Notice too I've added a property
here called justifyself center.

30
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.423
And that is a grid property that
allows this fixed width piece

31
00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:25.280
of content to center itself in
the middle of that particular self.

32
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.370
Then on cat one, I can just fill in
the kind of animation that I want.

33
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.677
So what I'm really doing
here Is I'm fading in and

34
00:02:34.677 --> 00:02:38.312
out the cat that's on top cat
one that fades in and out.

35
00:02:38.312 --> 00:02:42.140
And the other cat is up there
on the screen the whole time.

36
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.856
But because the first cat is fading in and
out,

37
00:02:44.856 --> 00:02:48.484
it looks like they are alternating
even though they're not.

38
00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:50.650
If you're not familiar with CSS animation.

39
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.774
This isn't a CSS animation course, but

40
00:02:52.774 --> 00:02:57.770
I'll just briefly sort of tell you what
these properties are and what they do.

41
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.682
First of all for we don't want to give
this an animation a name I've called

42
00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:05.782
it fade and the reason you give it a name
is because you're going to attach it to

43
00:03:05.782 --> 00:03:08.332
what's down here this
keyframes part of this.

44
00:03:08.332 --> 00:03:10.054
And this is the instructions for

45
00:03:10.054 --> 00:03:13.769
what it should be doing at each point
along the path in the animation.

46
00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.460
Now explain that in just a moment.

47
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.040
So I've given it a one
second delay to start.

48
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.039
The reason I do that is because we want
to give these images a chance to load in

49
00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:26.120
before the animation starts.

50
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.920
We can say how long we want
the animation to last.

51
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.160
In this case, I've said five seconds.

52
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.039
And then we have some things
about the animation Phil mode,

53
00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:37.920
said both Is the iteration count infinite.

54
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.194
In other words never stop you could put
in some number of iterations here if you

55
00:03:42.194 --> 00:03:45.130
want, and
the animation direction is alternate.

56
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.620
So we're going to run the animation this
way and then we're gonna run it back.

57
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.950
We're gonna run it this way and
we're going to run it back.

58
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.831
If you put it all in one direction so it
runs start to finish start to finish start

59
00:03:57.831 --> 00:04:03.728
to finish that can get a little bit choppy
so here it's running back and forth.

60
00:04:03.728 --> 00:04:08.373
So that's sort of the broad
characteristics of the CSS animation up

61
00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:13.180
front and then here in the keyframes
we say exactly what we want to do and

62
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.380
I've set up 0% 25% 75% and 100%.

63
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.165
That is of the time, that's what those
percents are referring to 100% of the time

64
00:04:21.165 --> 00:04:25.698
would be, in this case, five seconds,
the animation duration that I set here.

65
00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:30.344
So 25% of that of five seconds
would be at 1.25 seconds

66
00:04:30.344 --> 00:04:34.545
in this specific case,
we're going to do this thing.

67
00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:38.065
So here the keyframes
are set up such that and

68
00:04:38.065 --> 00:04:43.393
the first sort of 25% of
the animation the first 1.5 second,

69
00:04:43.393 --> 00:04:46.725
1.25 seconds will have it displaying

70
00:04:46.725 --> 00:04:51.409
at the same opacity basically
no animation is occurring.

71
00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:56.873
Then between 25 and 75% of the time so
1.25 to 3.75 seconds

72
00:04:56.873 --> 00:05:02.987
we'll transition from an opacity of one
to an opacity of zero that's the fade.

73
00:05:02.987 --> 00:05:09.220
That's where the fade completely happens
and then we'll keep that to 100%.

74
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.316
So that's what's happening here,
just two grid cells we've placed them

75
00:05:13.316 --> 00:05:17.010
on top of each other than we
animate one to fade in and out.

76
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.859
So that's one idea that
you might take away, and

77
00:05:19.859 --> 00:05:24.810
thinking about overlapping grid cells and
what you can do with them in your designs.
