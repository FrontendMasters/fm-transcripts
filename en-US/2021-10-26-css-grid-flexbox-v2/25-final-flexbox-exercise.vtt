00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.810
Okay, so let's go through
them these last exercises.

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.500
So we're your last exercise the big
wrap up the big finish here for Flexbox.

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.954
I'd like you to finish up
this particular web page,

4
00:00:14.954 --> 00:00:20.030
and I'd like you to add one final
section to this particular website.

5
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.360
So I am inside of the GitHub files,
I'm inside of VS code.

6
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.410
We're looking at chapter number seven.

7
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.521
And I am going to go through the
screenshots of what it is you're going to

8
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:33.720
be doing here.

9
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.010
Starting with the desktop.

10
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.119
This is what your web page is
going to wind up looking like so

11
00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:44.326
right now you've got the hero image
we put that in place we have our

12
00:00:44.326 --> 00:00:46.946
featured print that we added is as well.

13
00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:50.954
What you are going to add is
the popular print section of this and

14
00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:55.189
that is right there in between
the mission and the featured print so

15
00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:58.685
that is the part of the webpage
that you're gonna add.

16
00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:03.232
And as you see here on desktop that is
three images next to each other and

17
00:01:03.232 --> 00:01:08.089
the colour needs to stretch all the way
to the edges of the page we've talked

18
00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:12.895
about how to do that earlier today then
we're gonna go to the tablet here.

19
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.930
And let me just zoom in on
the popular prints part of this.

20
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.320
I want you to do this crazy thing right
here in the middle under popular prints.

21
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.718
So when we go to popular prints and we go
to a tablet dimension, that last image,

22
00:01:28.718 --> 00:01:33.150
normally would wrap on to the next
line you'd have to on the top and

23
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.440
one underneath and then a big gaping hole.

24
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.807
So instead I'd like you to use Flexbox
to make that final image here on tablet

25
00:01:40.807 --> 00:01:44.570
dimensions stretch all the way
across the width of the screen.

26
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.500
So you get two on top and
a big one on the bottom.

27
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.981
And then finally, of course,
when we go to mobile,

28
00:01:50.981 --> 00:01:55.110
these will just stretch set right
on top of each other, okay?

29
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.773
A lot of the code is
already there inside of so

30
00:01:58.773 --> 00:02:04.020
you're inside of the webpage
that we've been coding all day.

31
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.450
So a lot of the stuff like the the figures
and the styling, the borders and so forth.

32
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.800
A lot of that's already there.

33
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.815
But you're gonna have to write some
additional code to make these pictures do

34
00:02:15.815 --> 00:02:18.050
the crazy things that
I want you to do here.
