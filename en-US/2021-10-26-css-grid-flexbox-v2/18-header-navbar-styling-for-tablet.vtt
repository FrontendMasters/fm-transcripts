1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:07.440
And that will hold really nicely for
a while until we get down to 800 pixels.

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.720
And in here, well,
we're outside of our media query and so

3
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.567
all the styling gets turned off.

4
00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:16.090
But also it starts to look
a little bit crowded, doesn't it?

5
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.769
So this is the point when we can rewrite
our CSS to make this look a little bit

6
00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.049
different for a tablet dimension.

7
00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:26.990
And so that would start,
in our case it starts around 800 pixels.

8
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.440
So let's go ahead and
write that part of it up.

9
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.334
Here's our media query of 550 pixels,
the min width, and

10
00:00:39.334 --> 00:00:41.870
I'm just gonna scroll on down here.

11
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.791
And we'll add in our navigation here.

12
00:00:48.283 --> 00:00:50.010
So I'm gonna say nav uL.

13
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.070
I'm gonna change this to
justify content center.

14
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.512
And I'm gonna make use of
my gap property 1.2 ems.

15
00:01:03.512 --> 00:01:08.087
Here I'm using ems instead of rems
because I wanted to take advantage of

16
00:01:08.087 --> 00:01:11.810
the text size so
the gap will scale with the text size.

17
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.950
That is true when you use.

18
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.070
If you use rem that's
our route relative and

19
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.479
your gap will never scale because
it's relative to the HTML tag.

20
00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.978
It'll be 16 pixels, it is one rem,

21
00:01:23.978 --> 00:01:27.819
all the time regardless of
where you are in your document.

22
00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:33.086
But one that size can vary depending
on what HTML element you're looking at.

23
00:01:33.086 --> 00:01:39.043
One and an h1 is much larger
than one in a paragraph.

24
00:01:41.292 --> 00:01:45.645
Okay, then we'll have nav Li and

25
00:01:45.645 --> 00:01:51.552
here we're gonna have
a flex basis of auto and

26
00:01:51.552 --> 00:01:57.930
a margin bottom Of zero.

27
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.327
So basically I wanna have my Lis be as
wide as they are rather than having,

28
00:02:03.327 --> 00:02:07.941
being pushed off to the sides
the way I just did on the desktop.

29
00:02:10.528 --> 00:02:13.166
And then here for my nav a,

30
00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:20.322
Color, var, color one.

31
00:02:20.322 --> 00:02:22.130
I know I did that outside for
the mobile but

32
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.980
we're gonna change the color on
the mobile here in just a minute.

33
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.839
So I'm gonna redeclare that black
color down here inside of my tablet

34
00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:34.379
media query which will then carry
into the desktop media query.

35
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.470
The color or
the background color will be transparent.

36
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.982
Why?
Because when we finally finish writing our

37
00:02:44.982 --> 00:02:48.206
mobile styles, we're gonna have
buttons that are gonna be red,

38
00:02:48.206 --> 00:02:50.350
backgrounds with white text.

39
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.170
And so here inside of this media query,
we need to turn that off.

40
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.130
So we've set our background color to
transparent and our text color to black.

41
00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.837
Yeah, Mark.

42
00:02:59.837 --> 00:03:04.609
&gt;&gt; Is it possible to set orders like this
to guarantee an item would always be in

43
00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:09.078
the middle for the case of like dynamic
CMS where things can be added and

44
00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:11.682
removed from a header navigation menu?

45
00:03:11.682 --> 00:03:16.566
&gt;&gt; Sure, so the trick here with getting
things to look really pretty in the center

46
00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:21.770
with this type of technique is having
an even number of navigation items.

47
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.307
So that the logo can wind
up being in the center and

48
00:03:25.307 --> 00:03:30.591
then you have however many additional
navigation items on either side.

49
00:03:30.591 --> 00:03:32.874
If you have three on one side and
two on the other,

50
00:03:32.874 --> 00:03:36.411
it's always going to look less balanced
with this particular technique.

51
00:03:36.411 --> 00:03:38.588
But by using margin zero auto,

52
00:03:38.588 --> 00:03:42.791
maybe some of that will get
mitigated a little bit at least.

53
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:45.850
But I would think that that
would work okay with a CMS.

54
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.486
I mean, the only issue is, as always,

55
00:03:49.486 --> 00:03:54.392
what happens when your users put in
a dozen or two dozen navigation items.

56
00:03:54.392 --> 00:03:57.070
And how is that gonna get handled.

57
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.090
Is it gonna wrap on to another
line of navigation and so forth.

58
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:07.130
So there are edges definitely
into that for a CMS.

59
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:14.158
Okay, so
we've got a hover state nav a:hover,

60
00:04:17.363 --> 00:04:24.336
Color's gonna be var color2 so
nice teal green.

61
00:04:24.336 --> 00:04:27.057
And our background color once again,

62
00:04:27.057 --> 00:04:30.550
transparent because it
won't be on the mobile.

63
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.381
I found the error, okay.

64
00:04:33.381 --> 00:04:38.177
So I skipped over a very important
setting that I had at the mobile that

65
00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:42.800
needed to be there to carry into
the tablet and I did not put it in.

66
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.405
So let's put that in now.

67
00:04:45.405 --> 00:04:48.150
I am in the mobile portion of my styling.

68
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.804
I am looking at roughly line 80 or so.

69
00:04:51.804 --> 00:04:57.854
And the important piece of my
styling is this that I need to add,

70
00:04:57.854 --> 00:05:00.492
it is nav Li first-child.

71
00:05:00.492 --> 00:05:06.632
And what I said here was
the flex basis is 100%.

72
00:05:06.632 --> 00:05:08.522
Hopefully one of you guessed that.

73
00:05:08.522 --> 00:05:12.521
The problem we were having remember was
that the logo was on the same line with

74
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:14.100
the other navigation items.

75
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.600
And what we wanted the logo
to be on its own line.

76
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.630
So by setting the flex basis to 100%,
that indeed puts the logo on its own line.

77
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.707
And then we can also throw
in a text align center,

78
00:05:26.707 --> 00:05:32.385
which will center that logo very
nicely in the middle of the page.

79
00:05:32.385 --> 00:05:35.072
So once we have that in place,

80
00:05:35.072 --> 00:05:40.695
then when we go back to our
Firefox here and refresh.

81
00:05:40.695 --> 00:05:46.565
Now we have our logo in the center and
we have our navigation there after it.

82
00:05:46.565 --> 00:05:48.165
So that was the piece that I'm missing.

83
00:05:48.165 --> 00:05:48.995
I apologize for that.
