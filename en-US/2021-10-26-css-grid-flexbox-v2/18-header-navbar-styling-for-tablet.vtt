1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.666
And that will hold really nicely for
a while,

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:07.430
until we get down to sort of 800 pixels.

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.493
And in here, well,
we're outside of our media query and so

4
00:00:10.493 --> 00:00:12.590
all the styling gets turned off.

5
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.080
But also it starts to look
a little bit crowded, doesn't it?

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.201
So this is the point when we can rewrite
our CSS to make this look a little bit

7
00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:22.210
different for a tablet dimension.

8
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.401
And so, that would start,
in our case it starts around 800 pixels.

9
00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:30.646
So let's go ahead and
write that part of it up.

10
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.786
Here's our media query,
550 pixels, the min width,

11
00:00:39.786 --> 00:00:43.208
and I'm just gonna scroll on down here.

12
00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:45.591
And we'll add in our navigation here.

13
00:00:48.124 --> 00:00:49.961
So, I'm gonna say now view well.

14
00:00:52.044 --> 00:00:56.734
I'm gonna change this to
justify content center.

15
00:00:56.734 --> 00:01:00.478
And and
I'm gonna make use of my gap property,

16
00:01:00.478 --> 00:01:05.662
1.2 Here I'm using instead
of rams because I wanted to

17
00:01:05.662 --> 00:01:11.621
take advantage of the text size, so
the gap will scale with the text size.

18
00:01:11.621 --> 00:01:13.940
That is true when you use.

19
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.408
If you use rem,
that's our route relative and

20
00:01:17.408 --> 00:01:22.813
your gap will never scale because it's
relative to the HTML tag, it'll be 16

21
00:01:22.813 --> 00:01:27.832
pixels is one REM all the time regardless
of where you are in the document.

22
00:01:27.832 --> 00:01:33.023
But one That size can vary depending
on what HTML element you're looking at.

23
00:01:33.023 --> 00:01:38.800
One em an h1 is much larger
than one em a paragraph

24
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.940
Okay, then we'll have nav li, and

25
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.045
here we're gonna have
a flex basis of auto and

26
00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:57.777
a margin bottom, Of zero.

27
00:01:57.777 --> 00:02:02.680
So basically I wanna have my
li's be as wide as they are.

28
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:10.250
Rather than having being pushed off to the
sides, the way I just did on the desktop.

29
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.385
And then here for my nav a,

30
00:02:15.728 --> 00:02:20.286
Color var, color 1.

31
00:02:20.286 --> 00:02:22.160
I know I did that outside for
the mobile, but

32
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.960
we're gonna change the color on
the mobile here in just a minute.

33
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.821
So I'm gonna read Eclair, that black color
down here inside of my tablet media query,

34
00:02:30.821 --> 00:02:34.369
which will then carry on
to the desktop media query.

35
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.850
The color or the background
color will be transparent, why?

36
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.850
Because when we finally finished
writing our mobile styles,

37
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.340
we're gonna have buttons that are gonna
be red, backgrounds with white text.

38
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.156
And so here inside of this media query,
we need to turn that off.

39
00:02:54.156 --> 00:02:58.917
So we've set our background color to
transparent, and our text color to black.

40
00:02:58.917 --> 00:03:03.094
Yeah Mark
&gt;&gt; Is it possible to set orders like this

41
00:03:03.094 --> 00:03:08.341
to guarantee an item would always be in
the middle for in the case of like dynamic

42
00:03:08.341 --> 00:03:13.210
CMS where things can be added and
removed from a header navigation menu?

43
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.945
&gt;&gt; Sure, so the trick here with getting
things to look really pretty in the center

44
00:03:17.945 --> 00:03:22.536
with this type of technique is having
an even number of navigation items, so

45
00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:25.280
that the logo can wind
up being in the center.

46
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.548
And then you have however many additional
navigation items on either side,

47
00:03:29.548 --> 00:03:32.280
if you have three on one side and
two on the other,

48
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.366
it's always gonna look less balanced
with this particular technique.

49
00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:38.563
But by using margin zero auto,

50
00:03:38.563 --> 00:03:43.053
maybe some of that will get
mitigated a lot little bit at least.

51
00:03:43.053 --> 00:03:46.891
But I would think that that
would work okay with a CMS,

52
00:03:46.891 --> 00:03:52.518
I mean the only issue is as always, what
happens when your users put in a dozen or

53
00:03:52.518 --> 00:03:56.976
two dozen navigation items and
how is that gonna get handled.

54
00:03:56.976 --> 00:04:00.108
Is it gonna wrap on to another
line of navigation and so forth.

55
00:04:00.108 --> 00:04:06.875
So there are there are edges
definitely to that for a CMS.

56
00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:14.185
Okay so we've got hover state,
nav a hover.

57
00:04:17.283 --> 00:04:22.719
Color is gonna be var color 2,
so nice to green and

58
00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:27.639
our background color
once again transparent

59
00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.534
because it won't be on the mobile.

60
00:04:31.534 --> 00:04:33.328
I found the error, okay,

61
00:04:33.328 --> 00:04:37.897
so I skipped over a very important
setting that I had in the mobile,

62
00:04:37.897 --> 00:04:42.780
that needed to be there to carry into
the tablet and I did not put it in.

63
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.357
So let's put that in now.

64
00:04:45.357 --> 00:04:47.914
I am in the mobile portion of my styling.

65
00:04:47.914 --> 00:04:51.909
I am looking at roughly line 80 or so.

66
00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:56.801
And the important piece of
my styling is this that I

67
00:04:56.801 --> 00:05:00.770
need to add it is nav li:first-child.

68
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.435
And what I said here was
the flex basis is 100%.

69
00:05:06.435 --> 00:05:08.410
Hopefully one of you guessed that.

70
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.904
The problem we were having,

71
00:05:09.904 --> 00:05:14.090
remember was that the logo was on the same
line with the other navigation items.

72
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.580
And what we wanted,
the logo to be on its own line.

73
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.620
So by setting the flex basis to 100%,
that indeed puts the logo on its own line.

74
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.720
And then we can also throw
in text align center,

75
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.372
which will center that logo very
nicely in the middle of the page.

76
00:05:32.372 --> 00:05:38.598
So once we have that in place,
then when we go back to our Firefox here,

77
00:05:38.598 --> 00:05:42.822
and refresh now we have
our logo in the center and

78
00:05:42.822 --> 00:05:46.324
we have our navigation there after it.

79
00:05:46.324 --> 00:05:49.020
So that was the piece that I'm
missing apologize for that.
