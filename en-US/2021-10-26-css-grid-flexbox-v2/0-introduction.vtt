00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.092
Hello, everyone, my name is Jen Kramer.

2
00:00:02.092 --> 00:00:07.790
I am a instructor, I've been teaching
HTML and CSS for over 20 years.

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.704
Most recently at Harvard University, but I
have taught in all kinds of environments,

4
00:00:12.704 --> 00:00:16.880
academic and commercial environments,
workshops and online courses,

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.444
all kinds of other things.

6
00:00:18.444 --> 00:00:23.934
And I am so excited to present
to you the second version

7
00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:28.694
of my course on CSS Grids and
Flexbox layouts.

8
00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:32.290
Let's take a look at all of the cool
things that you're gonna learn inside

9
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.102
of this course.

10
00:00:33.102 --> 00:00:35.391
First we're gonna start with Flexbox.

11
00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:40.705
And we're gonna take a look at all types
of different Flexbox properties and

12
00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:46.017
how you can set up Grid based layout
systems using Flexbox across of course,

13
00:00:46.017 --> 00:00:48.444
all of the various media queries.

14
00:00:48.444 --> 00:00:52.797
We'll move on to a cool trick
that we can use with figures and

15
00:00:52.797 --> 00:00:56.557
figure captions among other
types of HTML markup.

16
00:00:56.557 --> 00:01:01.458
This is going to allow us to
layer our figure captions on

17
00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:06.582
top of figures here for
a really lovely looking web page.

18
00:01:06.582 --> 00:01:11.361
And then we're going to put together
those two pieces of learning that

19
00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:16.059
Grid system and this concept of
wearing our captions with the figures

20
00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:19.556
into a webpage project here,
the first part of it.

21
00:01:19.556 --> 00:01:24.201
Where we will lay out a series of
images here with lovely overlays

22
00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:27.824
describing all of these
various types of images.

23
00:01:27.824 --> 00:01:30.833
We'll take a quick peek at CSS shapes, and

24
00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:35.442
look at the lovely way we can make
our texts go on a slant like this.

25
00:01:35.442 --> 00:01:38.611
And of course we'll work
on our footer layout and

26
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:41.789
that will work across
our various breakpoints.

27
00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.086
So of course, we're gonna go to different
layouts as we hit our different

28
00:01:46.086 --> 00:01:48.875
breakpoints here in that
particular web page.

29
00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:53.500
Then we'll move on to adding a header and
a footer for our web page we'll look at

30
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.231
Flexbox and how we can make very
interesting looking navbars.

31
00:01:57.231 --> 00:02:01.580
Here is an example where we have our
logo in the middle of the navbar.

32
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.558
And then as we squash
the screen down here,

33
00:02:04.558 --> 00:02:08.709
we wind up with the navbar underneath,
the logo on the top.

34
00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.387
And then, finally,

35
00:02:10.387 --> 00:02:15.805
we'll turn our navigation into
a series of buttons, all using CSS.

36
00:02:15.805 --> 00:02:19.408
Then we'll move on to adding
responsive images to the website.

37
00:02:19.408 --> 00:02:23.930
We'll talk about the various approaches
to these responsive images including

38
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.220
the picture element.

39
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.470
We'll look at source set and sizes as
ways of loading responsive images.

40
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.316
And we'll include this hero element on
the page as well as a featured print.

41
00:02:36.316 --> 00:02:41.243
And then using those responsive images
depending on what break point we have to

42
00:02:41.243 --> 00:02:46.261
be looking at we'll look at different
versions of that picture on the web page.

43
00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:50.758
Finally to wrap up the flexbox
portion of this course,

44
00:02:50.758 --> 00:02:56.624
we will move on to adding the popular
prints section of this homepage for

45
00:02:56.624 --> 00:03:02.318
a fully completed homepage by the end
of the Flexbox unit of a course.

46
00:03:02.318 --> 00:03:05.301
Then we'll move on to CSS Grid.

47
00:03:05.301 --> 00:03:09.915
As always, we'll start with looking
at the various individual properties.

48
00:03:09.915 --> 00:03:14.701
And we'll do that by looking at
a painting by Piet Mondrian and

49
00:03:14.701 --> 00:03:17.193
we'll code it up with CSS Grid.

50
00:03:17.193 --> 00:03:22.645
Then we're going to look at the same
kind of figure and figure caption

51
00:03:22.645 --> 00:03:28.584
tricks that we did with Flexbox using
absolute and relative positioning.

52
00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:33.169
Now we're going to make that
happen instead using CSS Grid and

53
00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.620
Grids, fantastic ability to overlap cells.

54
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.053
And so we don't need to use
absolute relative positioning,

55
00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.557
we can just use Grid to
overlap those cells.

56
00:03:42.557 --> 00:03:48.437
That also means we can do other kinds
of cool things with Grid like this by

57
00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:53.534
overlapping two figures and
using CSS animation to fade in and

58
00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:56.879
out different pictures on the web page.

59
00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.535
We'll move on to adding a different
section of the homepage.

60
00:04:00.535 --> 00:04:03.309
In this case it will be
a mosaic based layout,

61
00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:07.908
where we'll have all different types
of pictures of different heights and

62
00:04:07.908 --> 00:04:11.857
widths and spanning over rows and
columns inside of our layout.

63
00:04:11.857 --> 00:04:16.403
And of course, we'll wind up
making that responsive as well.

64
00:04:16.403 --> 00:04:19.593
We'll then take a look at
some magazine style Lance.

65
00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:24.060
So here we've got a series of cats
on our page, and they have different

66
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.315
placements in different sizes and
different images and so forth.

67
00:04:28.315 --> 00:04:33.218
We'll look at how easily we can make that
kind of magic happen without any math.

68
00:04:33.218 --> 00:04:37.903
And just simply assigning a few classes
and changing a few properties so

69
00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:40.567
you can achieve these types of layouts.

70
00:04:40.567 --> 00:04:44.069
And finally, we'll do a very
cool trick here with cards.

71
00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:48.997
So we'll create cards that have one
particular layout here on desktop,

72
00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:52.567
they'll move on to a very
different kind of layout.

73
00:04:52.567 --> 00:04:55.807
Notice how we had the image in
the middle of the text here.

74
00:04:55.807 --> 00:04:59.519
Now we've got the image on the left
the text on the right, with Grid.

75
00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:05.412
And then finally back to a different type
of layout here on mobile devices and

76
00:05:05.412 --> 00:05:10.384
we'll walk through how we can do that,
making use of Flexbox and

77
00:05:10.384 --> 00:05:13.072
Grid and more Grid inside of Grid.

78
00:05:13.072 --> 00:05:18.433
And then finally, we'll build our final
website where you have lots of choices for

79
00:05:18.433 --> 00:05:22.888
how that might look, this happens to
be the way that I came up with it.

80
00:05:22.888 --> 00:05:27.495
Another mosaic style layout of a bunch
of beautiful donut pictures, and

81
00:05:27.495 --> 00:05:32.566
a cool overlay of the text here on top of
one of the images inside of the Grid cell.

82
00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:37.090
When we get to smaller dimensions
that text shows up first,

83
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.537
with the images stacked nicely underneath.

84
00:05:40.537 --> 00:05:45.821
As always with this course, it comes with
a website which will give you all of

85
00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:50.873
the background information,
all of the links to the various code pens.

86
00:05:50.873 --> 00:05:52.557
Some additional pointers and

87
00:05:52.557 --> 00:05:55.935
guidance along the way as we
work through the information.

88
00:05:55.935 --> 00:06:00.364
It's broken up into a chunk of
material pertaining to Flexbox and

89
00:06:00.364 --> 00:06:03.191
a chunk of material pertaining to Grids.

90
00:06:03.191 --> 00:06:07.528
So you can refer to this as you work
through the materials on the course.

91
00:06:07.528 --> 00:06:11.026
And finally, all of the files
are available on GitHub so

92
00:06:11.026 --> 00:06:13.258
you can download all of the files and

93
00:06:13.258 --> 00:06:17.365
follow along with everything that
I'm doing here in the course.

94
00:06:17.365 --> 00:06:22.717
I am really excited to be recording
an update to the Flexbox in Grid course.

95
00:06:22.717 --> 00:06:28.041
I've reworked, almost all of the material
from the original version of this course.

96
00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:31.686
And I'm including all kinds
of new techniques and

97
00:06:31.686 --> 00:06:36.371
new inspirations for you that I
hope will inspire you to make more

98
00:06:36.371 --> 00:06:39.778
interesting layouts using Flexbox and
Grid.

99
00:06:39.778 --> 00:06:42.051
So let's get started.
