00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.239
Hello everyone my name is Jen Kramer I am
a instructor I've been teaching HTML and

2
00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:09.322
CSS for over 20 years most
recently at Harvard University but

3
00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:13.020
I've taught in all kinds of environments,
academic and

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.650
commercial environments workshops and
online courses, all kinds of other things.

5
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.854
And I am so excited to present
to you the second version

6
00:00:23.854 --> 00:00:28.870
of my course on CSS grids and
Flexbox layouts.

7
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.990
Let's take a look at all of the cool
things that you're gonna learn inside of

8
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.200
this course.

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.570
First, we're gonna start with Flexbox.

10
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.310
And we're gonna take a look at all
types of different Flexbox properties.

11
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.114
And how you can set up Grid based
layout systems using Flexbox across,

12
00:00:45.114 --> 00:00:48.650
of course,
all of the various media queries.

13
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.822
We'll move on to a cool trick
that we can use with figures and

14
00:00:52.822 --> 00:00:56.790
figure captions among other
types of HTML markup.

15
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.550
This is going to allow us to layer our
figure captions on top of figures here.

16
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.939
For a really lovely looking web page and
then we're gonna put together

17
00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.784
those two pieces of learning that Grid
system and this concept of wearing our

18
00:01:13.784 --> 00:01:19.747
captions with the figures Into a webpage
project here, the first part of it.

19
00:01:19.747 --> 00:01:24.245
Where we will lay out a series of
images here with lovely overlays

20
00:01:24.245 --> 00:01:28.030
describing all of these
various types of images.

21
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.897
We'll take a quick peek at CSS shapes, and

22
00:01:30.897 --> 00:01:35.630
look at the lovely way we can make
our texts go on a slant like this.

23
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.724
And of course we'll work
on our footer layout and

24
00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:41.900
that will work across
our various breakpoints.

25
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.060
So of course, we're going to go to
different layouts as we hit our different

26
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.070
breakpoints here in that
particular web page.

27
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.290
Then we'll move on to adding a header and
a footer for our webpage.

28
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.480
We'll look at Flexbox and how we can
make very interesting looking navbars.

29
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.464
Here is an example where we have our
logo in the middle of the navbar, and

30
00:02:02.464 --> 00:02:05.205
then as we squash the screen down here,

31
00:02:05.205 --> 00:02:09.275
we wind up with the navbar
underneath the logo on the top and

32
00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:14.870
then finally we'll turn our navigation
into a series of buttons all using CSS.

33
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.562
Then we'll move on to adding responsive
images to the website we'll talk about

34
00:02:20.562 --> 00:02:25.410
the various approaches to as responsive
images, including the picture elements.

35
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.680
We'll look at source set and sizes as
ways of loading responsive images.

36
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.590
And we'll include this hero element on
the page as well as a featured print.

37
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.128
And then using those responsive images
depending on what break point we have to

38
00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:46.430
be looking at We'll look at different
versions of that picture on the webpage.

39
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.882
Finally, to wrap up the Flexbox
portion of this course,

40
00:02:50.882 --> 00:02:56.447
we will move on to adding the popular
prints section of this homepage for

41
00:02:56.447 --> 00:03:02.530
a fully completed homepage by the end
of the Flexbox unit of the course.

42
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.570
Then we'll move on to CSS Grid.

43
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.150
As always, we'll start with looking
at the various individual properties.

44
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.270
And we'll do that by looking at
a painting by Piet Mondrian and

45
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.260
will code it up with CSS Grid.

46
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.137
Then we're going to look
at the same kind of figure

47
00:03:21.137 --> 00:03:25.410
in figure caption tricks that
we did with Flexbox using.

48
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.267
Absolute and relative positioning
now we're going to make that happen

49
00:03:31.267 --> 00:03:36.139
instead using CSS Grid and Grid's
fantastic ability to overlap cells and so

50
00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.640
we don't need to use absolute
relative positioning,

51
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.770
we can just use Grid to
overlap those cells.

52
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.439
That also means we can do other
kinds of cool things with Grid like

53
00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:52.367
this by overlapping to figures and
using CSS animation to fade in and

54
00:03:52.367 --> 00:03:55.320
out different pictures on the webpage.

55
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.750
We'll move on to adding a different
section of the homepage.

56
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.830
In this case it will be
a mosaic based layout.

57
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.535
We will have all different types
of pictures of different heights,

58
00:04:07.535 --> 00:04:10.395
and widths, and
spanning over rows, and columns,

59
00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:14.820
inside of our lay out and of course we'll
wind up making that responsive as well.

60
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.952
We'll then take a look at some
magazine styled layouts, so here we've

61
00:04:20.952 --> 00:04:25.282
got a series of cats on our page, and
they have different placements and

62
00:04:25.282 --> 00:04:28.482
different sizes and
different images and so forth.

63
00:04:28.482 --> 00:04:33.512
We'll look at how easily we can make that
kind of magic happen without any math,

64
00:04:33.512 --> 00:04:38.019
and just simply assigning a few
classes and changing a few properties,

65
00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:40.595
you can achieve these types of layouts.

66
00:04:40.595 --> 00:04:44.250
And finally, we'll do a very
cool trick here with cards.

67
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.149
So we'll create cards that have one
particular layout here on desktop,

68
00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:52.770
they'll move on to a very
different kind of layout.

69
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.980
Notice how we had the image in
the middle of the text here.

70
00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.995
Now we've got the image on the left
the text on the right, with Grid and

71
00:05:00.995 --> 00:05:06.180
then finally back to a different type
of layout here on mobile devices and

72
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.600
we'll walk through how we can do
that making use of Flexbox and

73
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.161
Grid and more Grid inside of grids.

74
00:05:13.161 --> 00:05:18.852
And then finally, we'll build our final
website where you have lots of choices for

75
00:05:18.852 --> 00:05:20.555
how that might look.

76
00:05:20.555 --> 00:05:23.125
This happens to be the way
that I came up with it.

77
00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:27.503
Another mosaic style layout of a bunch
of beautiful donut pictures, and

78
00:05:27.503 --> 00:05:32.730
a cool overlay of the text here on top of
one of the images inside of the Grid cell.

79
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.013
When we get to smaller dimensions
that tech shows up first,

80
00:05:36.013 --> 00:05:38.520
with the images stacked nicely underneath.

81
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.605
As always with this course, it comes with
a website which will give you all of

82
00:05:45.605 --> 00:05:50.486
the background information, all of
the links to the various code pens, some

83
00:05:50.486 --> 00:05:55.840
additional pointers and guidance along the
way as we work through the information.

84
00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.542
And it's broken up into a chunk of
material pertaining to Flexbox and

85
00:06:00.542 --> 00:06:03.310
a chunk of material pertaining to Grid.

86
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.780
So you can refer to this as you work
through the materials on the course.

87
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.093
And finally, all of the files
are available on GitHub, so

88
00:06:11.093 --> 00:06:13.122
you can download all of the files and

89
00:06:13.122 --> 00:06:17.680
follow along with everything that
I'm doing here in the course.

90
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.060
I am really excited to be recording
an update to the Flexbox and Grid course.

91
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.500
I've reworked almost all of the material
from the original version of this course.

92
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.578
And I'm including all kinds of new
techniques and new inspirations for

93
00:06:33.578 --> 00:06:39.413
you that I hope will inspire you to make
more interesting layouts using Flexbox and

94
00:06:39.413 --> 00:06:39.931
Grid.

95
00:06:39.931 --> 00:06:41.091
So let's get started.
