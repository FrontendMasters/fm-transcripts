WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.622
Now that we have all of the HTML in place,
let's turn to our CSS and

2
00:00:04.622 --> 00:00:10.340
we're gonna start with laying this out
with our mobile dimension of the website.

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.316
So one of the things that I'm struck by
here as I started to work on this system

4
00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:19.520
immediately is the following.

5
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.680
I have this mixed media and
Anni Roenkae listed right after that.

6
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.492
And if you notice, there's a big gap in
between them and they kinda look similar,

7
00:00:28.492 --> 00:00:30.790
their font is slightly smaller.

8
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.911
But if we map this to a trend that we
see right now in the design industry,

9
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:38.967
often that the little text on the top
that mixed media will be displayed

10
00:00:38.967 --> 00:00:41.988
at a smaller font and
it will be all in uppercase, and

11
00:00:41.988 --> 00:00:46.280
then after that we'll have Anni Roenkae
which will be in larger letters.

12
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.038
So let's fix our styling here so
it looks closer to that.

13
00:00:52.038 --> 00:00:56.933
So we're gonna start
here with artists h4 and

14
00:00:56.933 --> 00:01:01.450
the way we can style
this is pretty simple,

15
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.863
we'll just say, text,
transform, uppercase.

16
00:01:06.863 --> 00:01:12.761
And then we'll say our
font weight is normal and

17
00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:18.660
then finally our font
size will be 0.8 rem and

18
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:26.053
that will get us to a tiny
uppercase font that is not bolded.

19
00:01:26.053 --> 00:01:28.834
Remember, of course, it's bold by default,

20
00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:32.317
all the headings are coming
from your browser stylesheet.

21
00:01:32.317 --> 00:01:37.343
The gap in between mixed media in
Anni Roenkae is caused by margin,

22
00:01:37.343 --> 00:01:41.135
that margin happens both on the h4 and
on the h3.

23
00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:44.280
All of the headings have some
default margin associated with it.

24
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.720
Be aware that when two margins
intersect inside of your style-sheet,

25
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.690
they don't add together, they actually
collapse into a single margin.

26
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.667
This is a really important feature if
you think about paragraphs, a series of

27
00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:04.768
paragraphs, we don't wanna have a giant
double space in between paragraphs,

28
00:02:04.768 --> 00:02:07.604
we wanna have the same type
of spacing in between them.

29
00:02:07.604 --> 00:02:11.219
So as to margins meet they do collapse.

30
00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:14.504
So here on my h4,
if I set the margin to zero,

31
00:02:14.504 --> 00:02:20.124
we won't see anything collapse here at
all, it will look exactly the same but

32
00:02:20.124 --> 00:02:24.633
stuff has happened,
we've actually turned off the margin.

33
00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:30.028
The top margin here is coming now from
the bottom of the h2, the margin that's

34
00:02:30.028 --> 00:02:34.953
underneath of the text for mixed media
is coming from the top of the h3.

35
00:02:34.953 --> 00:02:41.707
So let's set that up as follows,
artists age three,

36
00:02:41.707 --> 00:02:47.130
we're gonna say margin top of 0.3 Ems.

37
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.910
We could set that to zero if you wanted,

38
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.160
if you just set it to a straight zero,
it looks a little bit tight.

39
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.652
So I've set it to 0.3 Ems,

40
00:02:56.652 --> 00:02:59.710
which gives us a little bit of
breathing room between those.

41
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.890
That's an art decision and
you can change that however you like.

42
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.851
Now that we've got that in place, let's
focus on styling the cards themselves and

43
00:03:10.851 --> 00:03:13.850
the content inside of those cards.

44
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.683
So we make the visual side of
this a little bit smaller.

45
00:03:18.683 --> 00:03:22.793
Just for fun, we could start with flexbox.

46
00:03:22.793 --> 00:03:28.900
So, we'll work with the article
wrap portion of our HTML.

47
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.410
Remember that is the div that wraps
around all of the articles that

48
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.924
we're working with here, so
we'll set that up, article wrap.

49
00:03:41.674 --> 00:03:43.250
And we'll say Display.

50
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.018
Flex, we'll say flex flow because,
of course, by default Flexbox

51
00:03:50.018 --> 00:03:55.370
will very helpfully set that all up as
a series of columns inside of a row.

52
00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.590
That's not what we wanted
a mobile dimension.

53
00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.150
So we'll say our flex flow
is a column wrap, and

54
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.320
then the gap will be one rim in
between each one of those columns.

55
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.853
So that's just sets everything up
going here horizontally down the page.

56
00:04:11.853 --> 00:04:13.842
[SOUND] so far, so good.

57
00:04:13.842 --> 00:04:17.800
But wouldn't it be more interesting
if we made this a little bit better?

58
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.804
Part of the problem with having these
giant images is that it makes the page

59
00:04:21.804 --> 00:04:24.400
very long for scrolling here on mobile.

60
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.450
So wouldn't it be more fun if we had
a smaller image with the text next to it?

61
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.930
That would be kind of cool looking and

62
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.340
it wouldn't be all that hard
to do when we leverage grid.

63
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.900
So we have a basic layout here for
our mobile layout.

64
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.100
We have exactly what you would
expect at a mobile dimension.

65
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.224
We have our HTML and

66
00:04:45.224 --> 00:04:48.672
our images all stacked on top
of each other really nicely.

67
00:04:48.672 --> 00:04:52.668
The images look great, they're nice and
big, they're easy to see but

68
00:04:52.668 --> 00:04:55.075
it does make for
a long scrolling web page.

69
00:04:55.075 --> 00:04:59.498
Wouldn't it be nice if instead we had
a two column layout on mobile and

70
00:04:59.498 --> 00:05:03.004
we could have an image taking
up one of those columns and

71
00:05:03.004 --> 00:05:05.536
next to it we could have all of the text.

72
00:05:05.536 --> 00:05:08.222
That may not look possible
with what we have here but

73
00:05:08.222 --> 00:05:12.291
thanks to grid this becomes a really
easy layout to do, so let's set that up.

74
00:05:16.206 --> 00:05:21.079
So now the articles will wind
up being our containers for

75
00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:23.989
all of the elements inside of it.

76
00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:28.255
So if we just take a quick peek
inside of one of our articles here,

77
00:05:28.255 --> 00:05:32.840
you see that we have an h4, an h5,
an image, and two paragraphs.

78
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.410
That winds up being five elements
that are children of the article.

79
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.165
So, in our layout here, as we plan it,

80
00:05:42.165 --> 00:05:48.220
we'll set this up as our article wrap,
article,

81
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:54.437
and then we're going to
tell it to display as grid.

82
00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:59.458
And we're going to give it two columns,

83
00:05:59.458 --> 00:06:04.185
grid template columns of 1fr 1fr and

84
00:06:04.185 --> 00:06:08.912
then five rows, grid template rows,

85
00:06:08.912 --> 00:06:13.653
repeat parentheses five comma auto.

86
00:06:13.653 --> 00:06:18.539
So what will happen here is that
by default grid is going to assign

87
00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.180
each element inside of
the card its own row.

88
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.097
So there we go, we have one element here
each inside of this card, and we've called

89
00:06:27.097 --> 00:06:31.804
for two columns, so what grid has done is
it put the the heading in one, the image

90
00:06:31.804 --> 00:06:36.260
in the other, the text in the other and
the visit the website and the other.

91
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.750
So we're just sort of alternating
as we go on down the page here.

92
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.890
We need to clean that up
a little bit as well.

93
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.592
So let's add to this more styles,

94
00:06:48.592 --> 00:06:53.260
article rap, article star.

95
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.721
Remember, star is the universal selector,
so we're saying that for

96
00:06:57.721 --> 00:07:02.712
all of the elements inside of an article,
inside of our class of article wrap,

97
00:07:02.712 --> 00:07:04.340
do the following.

98
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:11.020
We're going to say, we wanna put
everything in grid, column 2/3.

99
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.915
So we're gonna put everything over in
the second column, see how the page jumps,

100
00:07:14.915 --> 00:07:18.680
everything goes over to the second column,
which is great.

101
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.088
And I'm also gonna turn off the margin
on the top, margin top of zero,

102
00:07:23.088 --> 00:07:28.172
that way things will tighten up in their
spacing a little bit which you'll see why

103
00:07:28.172 --> 00:07:33.297
here in just a moment, then we'll make
an exception to this rule for our images.

104
00:07:33.297 --> 00:07:38.450
So for article wrap, image,

105
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:42.161
that article image,

106
00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:46.696
then we're going to say,

107
00:07:46.696 --> 00:07:52.275
we want a grid column of 1/2.

108
00:07:52.275 --> 00:07:57.271
So we want the images over on the left
hand side, so there it is, and

109
00:07:57.271 --> 00:08:02.004
it's going to put it in the row
that most closely matches to just

110
00:08:02.004 --> 00:08:04.260
the regular flow of the HTML.

111
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.227
So it sort of looks like it's in
the middle and the spacing is all wonky.

112
00:08:08.227 --> 00:08:13.315
The way we fix that is by saying,

113
00:08:13.315 --> 00:08:19.575
then our grid row will be 1/6.

114
00:08:19.575 --> 00:08:24.253
And what that will do,
is have her image span over all six or

115
00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:29.885
all five of our rows and the content here,
now will snap up together and

116
00:08:29.885 --> 00:08:34.565
compact itself very,
very nicely on the right hand side,

117
00:08:34.565 --> 00:08:37.740
which is totally awesome and amazing.

118
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.467
We probably need a little bit more gap
here in between our article wraps and

119
00:08:43.467 --> 00:08:48.690
our columns, so let's add that, it's
looking a little bit crowded over there.

120
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:55.330
So I'm gonna say a gap here in my article
wrap article of zero and then one rim.

121
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.880
And that'll put some space there
in between our image and the text.

122
00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.980
So that's pretty cool.

123
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.533
That gives us the image next to the text.

124
00:09:05.533 --> 00:09:12.318
The HTML order is what it is and we have a
lovely layout here for mobile dimensions.

125
00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:15.691
It starts to get a little
bit big as we get larger, so

126
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:19.554
let's deal with that by writing
some more media queries.

127
00:09:19.554 --> 00:09:27.404
So here at media with
a min width of 650 pixels.

128
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:38.242
And our article wrap,
We're gonna say once again display grid.

129
00:09:40.665 --> 00:09:45.678
This overrides the earlier
declaration we had for

130
00:09:45.678 --> 00:09:52.597
flexes and flexbox, now we're going
to tell it to display as grid and

131
00:09:52.597 --> 00:09:58.921
then we can say our grid template
columns are repeat 2 comma and

132
00:09:58.921 --> 00:10:04.793
then of course we can use
our friend min-max, min-max.

133
00:10:04.793 --> 00:10:07.858
10 pixels comma 1fr.

134
00:10:07.858 --> 00:10:10.691
So if you're not familiar with min-max,

135
00:10:10.691 --> 00:10:14.245
this is something you can
include inside of CSS grid.

136
00:10:14.245 --> 00:10:19.632
This is designed to make sure
that your grid cell are good and

137
00:10:19.632 --> 00:10:22.990
they don't get too entirely small.

138
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.411
It is possible that your
grid cells shrink down so

139
00:10:25.411 --> 00:10:27.489
small that that they just look terrible.

140
00:10:27.489 --> 00:10:31.764
So this is a technique that Chris has
described it on his CSS [INAUDIBLE]

141
00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:36.236
website, so this is something that you
can incorporate anywhere along the way,

142
00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:39.062
I haven't done so
in the grid course to this point,

143
00:10:39.062 --> 00:10:42.383
mostly because I wanted to get
familiar with the notation.

144
00:10:42.383 --> 00:10:46.974
This is something else you can add on as
a layer of security to make sure your

145
00:10:46.974 --> 00:10:48.766
cells don't get too small.

146
00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:54.838
So if we widen this page, now we're
gonna wind up with two columns and

147
00:10:54.838 --> 00:11:01.940
you'll see here that we have a very
lovely layout here at tablet dimensions.

148
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.438
But we can now do one additional level of
craziness here when we get to desktop and

149
00:11:06.438 --> 00:11:09.140
completely change the look
of this site again.

150
00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:15.103
So here, so
we'll say @ media and min width,

151
00:11:15.103 --> 00:11:21.480
you probably wanna say something
like 1000 pixels on your end.

152
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:26.124
I'm gonna say something like 800 pixels
here because I have a smaller screen and

153
00:11:26.124 --> 00:11:28.260
limited size that I'm working with.

154
00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:37.792
And so here, let's change up our
display again with article wrap and

155
00:11:37.792 --> 00:11:43.118
am going to say my grid
template column are gonna

156
00:11:43.118 --> 00:11:47.820
be repeat four comma and then mini-max.

157
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.363
Inside of these ten pixels comma 1fr, so

158
00:11:51.363 --> 00:11:56.730
now I'm telling grid to set us
up with four columns instead.

159
00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.100
So that's the way it looks right now.

160
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.900
Those pictures are a little bit small.

161
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:06.298
So let's clean that up a little bit.

162
00:12:06.298 --> 00:12:13.693
When we go to our article wrap article,
Now

163
00:12:13.693 --> 00:12:19.840
we'll say our grid template columns, so
remember, this is inside of the article.

164
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.060
Previously, we've had two columns one
with the image one with everything else.

165
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.820
Now I'm gonna change that to simply
one column, 1fr, that's all I want.

166
00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:34.762
You can do a min-max on that
too if you want, min-max.

167
00:12:34.762 --> 00:12:39.820
Maybe it's a minimum of 100 pixels
comma 1fr, something like that.

168
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.997
It doesn't always have to be 10 pixels, it
could also be Ems or Rems or percents or

169
00:12:43.997 --> 00:12:46.780
viewport widths or whatever makes sense.

170
00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.331
I just happen to be using pixels here.

171
00:12:51.929 --> 00:12:57.520
Okay, then we need to
specify our rows again.

172
00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:03.479
So our grid template rows,

173
00:13:03.479 --> 00:13:08.039
repeat: 5, auto, whoops.

174
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:13.937
Comma auto.

175
00:13:19.684 --> 00:13:22.165
So that's how that's looking.

176
00:13:22.165 --> 00:13:24.139
And we can set up our gap with that.

177
00:13:29.415 --> 00:13:33.976
01 m And then,

178
00:13:33.976 --> 00:13:39.577
now the last part of this is to
rearrange what we have here and

179
00:13:39.577 --> 00:13:45.230
get the image back into
the same location as our text.

180
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.580
So we can set that up as follows.

181
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:53.552
We'll say our article wrap Article star,

182
00:13:53.552 --> 00:13:57.732
in other words, for all of the elements,

183
00:13:57.732 --> 00:14:02.640
we want them to occupy
our grid column of 1/2.

184
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.540
Okay, make sure that they
all occupy the same column.

185
00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.010
That's a good start.

186
00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:13.458
And then for the image itself, if you like
it this way with the image at the top,

187
00:14:13.458 --> 00:14:18.758
you can absolutely do that or
you could rearrange this, article

188
00:14:22.016 --> 00:14:24.990
Article image.

189
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:32.550
Here we might say something like,
our grid column is definitely still 1/2.

190
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:37.696
Our grid row though, if you want it
to go back to its original location

191
00:14:37.696 --> 00:14:42.221
in the source code, so
after the headings we would just say,

192
00:14:42.221 --> 00:14:47.191
auto, and that will move the image
to where it would normally occur

193
00:14:47.191 --> 00:14:52.040
in the source order right after
the headings as we had it before.

194
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:57.315
And we could also be give that a bit
of margin on the bottom of one rem.

195
00:14:59.375 --> 00:15:02.144
So we give it a little bit
of spacing here on the page.

196
00:15:02.144 --> 00:15:03.672
So now we have a wild and

197
00:15:03.672 --> 00:15:08.744
crazy layout here where we've got four
columns with headings on the top and

198
00:15:08.744 --> 00:15:13.976
images in the middle here at the desktop,
when we go to our tablet dimension,

199
00:15:13.976 --> 00:15:19.371
we wind up with two main columns each of
which with two sort of separate columns,

200
00:15:19.371 --> 00:15:22.466
the image on the side,
the text next to that.

201
00:15:22.466 --> 00:15:27.037
And then when you narrow this up even
further, we have two nice columns with

202
00:15:27.037 --> 00:15:32.350
the text on one side and the image on the
other, so image is always big and visible.

203
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.550
Very important when you're
talking about artists.

204
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:39.396
If he wanted to take this to the next
level, you could do something interesting

205
00:15:39.396 --> 00:15:43.730
like giving background colors here on
some of the cells, maybe not all of them.

206
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:47.470
You could do some styling with
the link to the visit the websites,

207
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.500
maybe those turn into some kind of button.

208
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.060
You could definitely do fun
things here with the fonts.

209
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:58.046
We worked with a single Arial font here,
it's pretty vanilla looking.

210
00:15:58.046 --> 00:16:01.099
So if you added some more
interesting contrasting fonts,

211
00:16:01.099 --> 00:16:04.790
you could wind up making this
look more interesting as well.

212
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.139
You could add some border radius or

213
00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:11.170
a border on the image itself
to jazz that up a bit.

214
00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:16.808
There's all kinds of things you can do
with cards to take the layout that I've

215
00:16:16.808 --> 00:16:22.720
just given you here to the next level and
make a really exciting looking web page.
