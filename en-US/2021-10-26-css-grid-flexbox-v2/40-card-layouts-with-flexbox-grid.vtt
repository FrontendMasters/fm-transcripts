WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.733
Now that we have all of the HTML in place,
let's turn to our CSS, and

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:10.484
we're gonna start with laying this out
with our mobile dimension of the website.

3
00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:17.289
So one of the things that I'm struck by
here as I start to work on this system

4
00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.247
immediately is the following.

5
00:00:19.247 --> 00:00:24.435
I have this mixed media and
Annie Roenkae listed right after that.

6
00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:27.393
And if you notice there's
a big gap in between them and

7
00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:30.637
they kind of look similar or
the font is slightly smaller.

8
00:00:30.637 --> 00:00:34.957
But if we map this to a trend that we
see right now in the design industry,

9
00:00:34.957 --> 00:00:39.925
often that the little text on the top that
mixed media will be displayed at a smaller

10
00:00:39.925 --> 00:00:42.166
font and it will be all in uppercase.

11
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:46.119
And then after that we'll have Annie
Roenkae which will be in larger letters.

12
00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:51.888
So let's fix our styling here so
it looks closer to that.

13
00:00:51.888 --> 00:00:56.886
So we're gonna start here with artists H4.

14
00:00:56.886 --> 00:00:59.687
And the way we can style
this is pretty simple.

15
00:00:59.687 --> 00:01:07.096
We'll just say text, transform, uppercase.

16
00:01:07.096 --> 00:01:12.288
And then we'll say our
font weight is normal.

17
00:01:12.288 --> 00:01:18.855
And then finally our font
size will be 0.8 rem.

18
00:01:18.855 --> 00:01:25.781
And that will get us to a tiny
uppercase font that is not bolded.

19
00:01:25.781 --> 00:01:28.581
Remember, of course, it's bold by default,

20
00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:32.225
all of the headings are coming
from your browser style sheet.

21
00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:37.097
The gap in between mixed media in
Annie Roenkae is caused by margin,

22
00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:40.954
and that margin happens both on the H4 and
on the H3.

23
00:01:40.954 --> 00:01:44.514
All of the headings have some
default margin associated with it.

24
00:01:44.514 --> 00:01:50.328
Be aware that when two margins
intersect inside of your style sheet,

25
00:01:50.328 --> 00:01:56.554
they don't add together, they actually
collapse into a single margin.

26
00:01:56.554 --> 00:02:00.662
This is a really important feature,
if you think about paragraphs, a series of

27
00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:04.788
paragraphs, we don't wanna have a giant
double spacing between paragraphs.

28
00:02:04.788 --> 00:02:07.646
We wanna have the same type
of spacing in between them.

29
00:02:07.646 --> 00:02:10.253
So as two margins meet, they do collapse.

30
00:02:10.253 --> 00:02:14.249
So here on my H4,
if I set the margin to 0,

31
00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:21.358
we won't see anything collapse here at
all, it will look exactly the same.

32
00:02:21.358 --> 00:02:24.408
But stuff has happened we've
actually turned off the margin.

33
00:02:24.408 --> 00:02:28.228
The top margin here is coming
now from the bottom of the H2.

34
00:02:28.228 --> 00:02:31.382
The margin that's
underneath of the text for

35
00:02:31.382 --> 00:02:34.540
mixed media is coming
from the top of the H3.

36
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.005
So let's set that up as follows,
artists, H3.

37
00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:44.383
We're gonna say margin top 0.3 ems,

38
00:02:44.383 --> 00:02:48.372
we could set that to 0 if you wanted,

39
00:02:48.372 --> 00:02:54.964
if you just set it to a straight
0 it looks a little bit tight.

40
00:02:54.964 --> 00:02:56.545
So I've set it to 0.3 ems,

41
00:02:56.545 --> 00:02:59.788
which gives us a little bit of
breathing room between those.

42
00:02:59.788 --> 00:03:02.631
That's an hard decision, and
you can change that however you like.

43
00:03:02.631 --> 00:03:08.162
Now, that we've got that in place,
let's focus on styling

44
00:03:08.162 --> 00:03:13.702
the cards themselves and
the content inside of those cards.

45
00:03:13.702 --> 00:03:18.786
So we will make the visual side
of this a little bit smaller.

46
00:03:18.786 --> 00:03:22.282
Just for fun, we could start with Flexbox.

47
00:03:22.282 --> 00:03:26.733
And so, we'll work with the article wrap,
a portion of our HTML,

48
00:03:26.733 --> 00:03:31.424
remember that is the divs that wraps
around all of the articles that and

49
00:03:31.424 --> 00:03:34.550
we'll say display we're working with here.

50
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.380
And so we'll set that up, article wrap.

51
00:03:44.417 --> 00:03:49.520
Flex, we'll save flex flow because
of course, by default Flexbox

52
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.991
will very helpfully set that all up as
a series of columns inside of a row.

53
00:03:54.991 --> 00:03:57.100
That's not what we wanted
a mobile dimension.

54
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.208
So we'll say our flex flow
is a column wrap, and

55
00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:04.348
then the gap will be 1 rem in
between each one of those columns.

56
00:04:04.348 --> 00:04:09.713
So that's just sets everything up
going here horizontally down the page.

57
00:04:09.713 --> 00:04:13.296
Met, so far so good.

58
00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:15.970
But wouldn't it be more interesting
if we made this a little bit better?

59
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.724
Part of the problem with
having these giant images,

60
00:04:19.724 --> 00:04:24.347
is that it makes the page very long for
scrolling here on mobile.

61
00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:30.033
So wouldn't it be more fun if we had
a smaller image with a text next to it?

62
00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:32.836
That would be kinda cool looking, and

63
00:04:32.836 --> 00:04:37.051
it wouldn't be all that hard
to do when we leverage grid.

64
00:04:37.051 --> 00:04:40.225
So we have a basic layout here for
our mobile layout,

65
00:04:40.225 --> 00:04:43.918
we have exactly what you would
expect in a mobile dimension.

66
00:04:43.918 --> 00:04:45.088
We have our HTML and

67
00:04:45.088 --> 00:04:48.680
our images all stacked on top
of each other really nicely.

68
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.477
The images look great, they're nice and
big, they're easy to see.

69
00:04:52.477 --> 00:04:54.893
But it does make for
a long scrolling web page.

70
00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:59.208
Wouldn't it be nice if instead we
had a two column layout on mobile,

71
00:04:59.208 --> 00:05:02.856
and we could have an image
taking up one of those columns.

72
00:05:02.856 --> 00:05:05.045
And next to it,
we could have all of the text.

73
00:05:05.045 --> 00:05:08.658
That may not look possible with what
we have here, but thanks to grid,

74
00:05:08.658 --> 00:05:10.750
this becomes a really easy layout to do.

75
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.920
So let's set that up.

76
00:05:16.406 --> 00:05:21.147
So now, the articles will wind
up being our containers for

77
00:05:21.147 --> 00:05:23.874
all of the elements inside of it.

78
00:05:23.874 --> 00:05:28.207
So if we just take a quick peek
inside of one of our articles here,

79
00:05:28.207 --> 00:05:31.337
you see that we have an H4 and
H5, an image and

80
00:05:31.337 --> 00:05:36.992
two paragraphs that winds up being five
elements that are children of the article.

81
00:05:36.992 --> 00:05:41.285
So in our layout here as we plan it,

82
00:05:41.285 --> 00:05:46.181
we'll set this up as our article wrap,

83
00:05:47.517 --> 00:05:54.061
Article, And then we're going
to tell it to display as grid.

84
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:59.035
And we're going to give it two columns,

85
00:05:59.035 --> 00:06:03.875
grid template columns of 1fr, 1fr.

86
00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:08.922
And then five rows, grid template rows,

87
00:06:08.922 --> 00:06:13.399
repeat, parentheses, 5,auto.

88
00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:17.643
So what will happen here is
that by default grid is going

89
00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:21.995
to assign each element inside of the card,
its own row.

90
00:06:21.995 --> 00:06:26.527
So there we go, we have one element here,
each inside of this card,

91
00:06:26.527 --> 00:06:28.924
and we've called for two columns.

92
00:06:28.924 --> 00:06:32.251
So what grid has done is it put
the heading in one, the image,

93
00:06:32.251 --> 00:06:36.186
the other the text and the other and
the visit the website and the other.

94
00:06:36.186 --> 00:06:39.632
So we're just sort of alternating
as we go on down the page here.

95
00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:43.372
We need to clean that up
a little bit as well.

96
00:06:43.372 --> 00:06:48.025
So let's add to this more styles.

97
00:06:48.025 --> 00:06:52.973
ArticleWrap, article *.

98
00:06:52.973 --> 00:06:58.806
Remember * is the universal selector, so
we're saying that for all of the elements

99
00:06:58.806 --> 00:07:04.079
inside of an article, inside of our
class of articlewrap do the following.

100
00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:10.844
We're going to say we wanna put
everything in grid column 2/3.

101
00:07:10.844 --> 00:07:12.926
So we're gonna put everything
over in the second column.

102
00:07:12.926 --> 00:07:18.493
See how the page jumps, everything goes
over to the second column, which is great.

103
00:07:18.493 --> 00:07:24.054
And I'm also gonna turn off the margin
on the top, margin top of 0.

104
00:07:24.054 --> 00:07:27.292
That way things will tighten up
in their spacing a little bit,

105
00:07:27.292 --> 00:07:29.610
which you'll see why
here in just a moment.

106
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.339
Then we'll make an exception
to this rule for our images.

107
00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:38.442
So for articlewrap, Image,

108
00:07:38.442 --> 00:07:41.560
article image.

109
00:07:43.785 --> 00:07:48.544
Then we're going to say
we want a grid column,

110
00:07:50.384 --> 00:07:56.485
Of 1/2, so we want the images over on
the left hand side, so there it is.

111
00:07:56.485 --> 00:08:01.106
And it's good to put it in
the row that most closely matches

112
00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:04.230
to the just the regular flow of the HTM.

113
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.065
So it sort of looks like it's in
the middle and the spacing is all wonky.

114
00:08:08.065 --> 00:08:13.876
The way we fix that is by
saying then our grid row,

115
00:08:15.726 --> 00:08:19.132
Will be 1/6.

116
00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:26.879
And what that will do is have our
image span over all five of our rows.

117
00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:32.759
And the content here now will snap
up together and compact itself very,

118
00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:38.937
very nicely on the right hand side,
which is totally awesome and amazing.

119
00:08:38.937 --> 00:08:43.959
We probably need a little bit more gap
here in between our article wraps and

120
00:08:43.959 --> 00:08:44.936
our columns.

121
00:08:44.936 --> 00:08:48.404
So let's add that it's looking
a little bit crowded over there.

122
00:08:48.404 --> 00:08:53.538
So I'm gonna say a gap here in
my article wrap article of 0 and

123
00:08:53.538 --> 00:09:00.602
then 1 rem,.And that'll put some space
there in between our image and the text.

124
00:09:00.602 --> 00:09:05.482
So that's pretty cool,
that gives us the image next to the text.

125
00:09:05.482 --> 00:09:07.557
The HTML order is what it is.

126
00:09:07.557 --> 00:09:12.355
And we have a lovely layout here for
mobile dimensions.

127
00:09:12.355 --> 00:09:15.526
It starts to get a little
bit big as we get larger.

128
00:09:15.526 --> 00:09:19.428
So let's deal with that by
writing some more media queries.

129
00:09:19.428 --> 00:09:23.227
So here at media with a min width,

130
00:09:24.795 --> 00:09:32.280
Of 650 pixels, In our article wrap.

131
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.575
We're gonna say once again, display grid.

132
00:09:39.575 --> 00:09:45.212
This overrides the earlier declaration
we had for flexes and Flexbox.

133
00:09:45.212 --> 00:09:48.014
Now, we're gonna tell it
to display as grid, and

134
00:09:48.014 --> 00:09:53.086
then we can say our grid template,
Columns,

135
00:09:55.069 --> 00:10:01.765
Are repeat to comma, and then of course,
we can use our friend min max,

136
00:10:02.947 --> 00:10:07.852
Min max, 10px,1fr.

137
00:10:07.852 --> 00:10:10.642
So if you're not familiar with min max,

138
00:10:10.642 --> 00:10:14.343
this is something you can
include inside of CSS Grid.

139
00:10:14.343 --> 00:10:20.124
This is designed to make sure that your
grid cells are going to look good and

140
00:10:20.124 --> 00:10:22.935
they don't get to entirely small.

141
00:10:22.935 --> 00:10:25.262
It is possible that your
grid cells shrink down so

142
00:10:25.262 --> 00:10:27.264
small that that they just look terrible.

143
00:10:27.264 --> 00:10:32.113
So this is a technique that Chris Croyer
has described on his CSS tricks website.

144
00:10:32.113 --> 00:10:36.079
And so this is something that you can
incorporate anywhere along the way.

145
00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:38.788
I haven't done so
in the grid course to this point,

146
00:10:38.788 --> 00:10:42.131
mostly because I wanted you to
get familiar with the notation.

147
00:10:42.131 --> 00:10:46.348
This is something else you can add on as
a layer of security to make sure your

148
00:10:46.348 --> 00:10:47.989
cells don't get too small.

149
00:10:49.504 --> 00:10:55.087
So if we widen this page,
now we're gonna wind up with two columns.

150
00:10:55.087 --> 00:11:01.758
And you'll see here that we have a very
lovely layout here at tablet dimensions.

151
00:11:01.758 --> 00:11:07.324
But we can now do one additional level of
craziness here when we get to desktop and

152
00:11:07.324 --> 00:11:10.579
completely change the look
of the site again.

153
00:11:10.579 --> 00:11:14.908
So here, so we'll say @media and minwidth,

154
00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:21.239
you probably wanna say something
like 1000 pixels on your end.

155
00:11:21.239 --> 00:11:24.742
I'm gonna say something
like 800 pixels here,

156
00:11:24.742 --> 00:11:29.801
because I have a smaller screen and
a limited size that I'm working with.

157
00:11:29.801 --> 00:11:36.195
And so here let's change up our
display again with article wrap.

158
00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:40.433
And I'm going to save my grid,

159
00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:46.627
template columns are gonna be repeat 4,
and

160
00:11:46.627 --> 00:11:52.503
then minmax inside of this 10px,1fr.

161
00:11:52.503 --> 00:11:56.449
So now I'm telling, grids has set
us up with four columns instead.

162
00:11:56.449 --> 00:12:01.847
So that's the way it looks right now,
those pictures are a little bit small.

163
00:12:01.847 --> 00:12:03.784
So let's clean that up a little bit.

164
00:12:06.232 --> 00:12:09.114
When we go to our articlewrap article.

165
00:12:13.377 --> 00:12:17.395
Now, we'll say our grid template columns.

166
00:12:17.395 --> 00:12:21.419
So remember this is inside of the article,
previously we've had two columns,

167
00:12:21.419 --> 00:12:23.831
one with the image,
one with everything else.

168
00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:28.520
Now, I'm gonna change that to simply
one column, 1fr, that's all I want.

169
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.466
You can do a minmax on that too,
if you want.

170
00:12:31.466 --> 00:12:32.983
Minmax.

171
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:39.340
Maybe it's a minimum of 100px,1fr,
something like that.

172
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.462
It doesn't always have to be 10 pixels.

173
00:12:41.462 --> 00:12:45.119
It could also be ems or rems, or
percents or viewpoint widths or

174
00:12:45.119 --> 00:12:46.502
whatever makes sense.

175
00:12:46.502 --> 00:12:48.151
I just happen to be using pixels here.

176
00:12:52.368 --> 00:12:57.477
Okay, then we need to
specify our rows again.

177
00:12:59.181 --> 00:13:02.688
So our grid template rows,

178
00:13:02.688 --> 00:13:06.978
repeat, 5,auto, whoops.

179
00:13:13.044 --> 00:13:13.663
,auto.

180
00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.473
So that's how that's looking.

181
00:13:21.473 --> 00:13:24.051
And we can set up our gap with that.

182
00:13:29.456 --> 00:13:31.155
01.

183
00:13:31.155 --> 00:13:39.090
And then now the last part of this is
to you rearrange what we have here and

184
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:45.052
get the image back into
the same location as our text.

185
00:13:45.052 --> 00:13:47.348
So we can set that up as follows.

186
00:13:47.348 --> 00:13:55.701
We'll say our articlewrap,
Article *, in other words for

187
00:13:55.701 --> 00:14:00.528
all of the elements we want them
to occupy our grid column of 1/2.

188
00:14:00.528 --> 00:14:06.881
Okay, make sure that they all occupy
the same column, that's a good start.

189
00:14:06.881 --> 00:14:11.501
And then for the image itself,
if you like it this way with

190
00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:15.556
the image at the top,
you can absolutely do that.

191
00:14:15.556 --> 00:14:23.354
Or you could rearrange this,
article, Article image.

192
00:14:23.354 --> 00:14:27.816
Here, we might say something like our

193
00:14:27.816 --> 00:14:32.701
grid column is definitely still 1/2.

194
00:14:32.701 --> 00:14:36.749
Our grid row though, if you want it to
go back to its original location in

195
00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:40.475
the source code, so after the headings,
we would just say auto.

196
00:14:40.475 --> 00:14:45.625
And that will move the image to
where it would normally occur

197
00:14:45.625 --> 00:14:51.198
in the source order right after
the headings as we had it before.

198
00:14:51.198 --> 00:14:57.261
And we could also give that a bit
of margin on the bottom of 1 rem.

199
00:14:59.098 --> 00:15:02.005
So we give it a little bit
of spacing here on the page.

200
00:15:02.005 --> 00:15:06.658
So now, we have a wild and crazy layout
here where we've got four columns with

201
00:15:06.658 --> 00:15:10.543
headings on the top and
images in the middle here at the desktop.

202
00:15:10.543 --> 00:15:15.570
When we go to our tablet dimension,
we wind up with two main columns,

203
00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:19.052
each of which with two
sorta separate columns.

204
00:15:19.052 --> 00:15:21.630
The image on the side,
the text next to that.

205
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.612
And then when you narrow
this up even further,

206
00:15:24.612 --> 00:15:29.434
we have two nice columns with the text
on one side and the image on the other.

207
00:15:29.434 --> 00:15:31.940
So you have a just always big invisible,

208
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.271
very important when you're
talking about artists.

209
00:15:35.271 --> 00:15:39.321
If you wanted to take this to the next
level, you could do something interesting

210
00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:43.499
like giving background colors here on on
some of the cells, maybe not all of them.

211
00:15:43.499 --> 00:15:47.411
You could do some styling with
the link to visit the websites,

212
00:15:47.411 --> 00:15:50.280
maybe those turned into
some kind of button.

213
00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.525
You could definitely do fun
things here with the fonts,

214
00:15:53.525 --> 00:15:57.750
we worked with a single Arial font here,
it's pretty vanilla looking.

215
00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:01.013
So if you added some more
interesting contrasting fonts,

216
00:16:01.013 --> 00:16:04.421
you could wind up making this
look more interesting as well.

217
00:16:04.421 --> 00:16:10.944
You could add some border radius or border
on the image itself to jazz that up a bit.

218
00:16:10.944 --> 00:16:16.878
There's all kinds of things that you can
do with cards to take the layout that I've

219
00:16:16.878 --> 00:16:22.730
just given you here to the next level and
make a really exciting looking web page.
