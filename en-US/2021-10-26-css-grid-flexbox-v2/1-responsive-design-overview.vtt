00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.176
So we're gonna introduce Flexbox with this
little PowerPoint show here I want to

2
00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:09.784
give you a little bit of background about
responsive design and what it is and

3
00:00:09.784 --> 00:00:14.752
then we're going to talk a little bit more
about Flexbox including its history and

4
00:00:14.752 --> 00:00:15.616
its syntax and

5
00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:20.607
things to think about when you work with
Flexbox then we'll get into some coding.

6
00:00:20.607 --> 00:00:21.630
So to start here,

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.480
responsive design was defined by Ethan
Marcotte back in May of 2010 now, so 11

8
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.660
years it's been since Ethan Marcotte came
up with the idea of responsive design.

9
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.530
And he defined it as images that resize
and media queries and a grid based layout.

10
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.824
Now, when he came up with this concept,

11
00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:44.550
the only way to do layouts on a web
page were pretty much two ways.

12
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.661
One was a table based layout,
which everybody knew was bad news and

13
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:54.679
float based layouts which were a lot
more difficult to work with at

14
00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.880
that point in time and so
fortunately Flexbox has since gone through

15
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.717
several iterations and
become well supported by browsers, so

16
00:01:04.717 --> 00:01:09.360
the grid based layout is much
easier than it used to be.

17
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.079
The images that resize have come a long
way we're gonna talk a lot about those and

18
00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.390
of course we're gonna work with media
queries all through this course.

19
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.618
So a grid based layout you might be
familiar with from Responsive Design

20
00:01:22.618 --> 00:01:27.058
frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation UI
kit there's many many of these

21
00:01:27.058 --> 00:01:31.778
frameworks the concept being that you have
some number of columns on the page and

22
00:01:31.778 --> 00:01:35.652
then you're going to group together
those columns into a unit and

23
00:01:35.652 --> 00:01:40.170
that will become a where you actually
display something on your webpage.

24
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.542
The concept here comes from print design,
where printers have thought about

25
00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:48.750
columns in terms of laying things out for
a very long period of time.

26
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.350
It helps keep layouts neat and clean and,
and flexible in a lot of ways.

27
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.699
These days we tend to be breaking away
from this format a little bit, but

28
00:01:59.699 --> 00:02:03.106
we will look at it a little bit
both in terms of Flexbox and

29
00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:07.890
in terms of CSS grid over this course,
so that you can understand this model.

30
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.561
We'll also look at some ways people are
looking at these types of layouts using

31
00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:14.700
different types of technologies.

32
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.770
The images that resize have
come along way as well.

33
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.620
So last time I recorded
this course in 2017.

34
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.650
We talked about the picture element.

35
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.632
And that was all it turns out that
there are two other ways that are now

36
00:02:29.632 --> 00:02:32.560
in HTML 5 sizes and source set.

37
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.032
Those happen to come out the same month
and get supported by edge at the same

38
00:02:36.032 --> 00:02:38.888
month that I was recording this
course the last time around,

39
00:02:38.888 --> 00:02:41.420
which is why I didn't talk about that.

40
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.150
So pictures, sizes and
source set are all very well supported.

41
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.611
Now, we will be talking about those later
on today in terms of responsive images and

42
00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:50.640
how that can work.

43
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.920
And then of course,
finally, CSS media queries.

44
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.210
So this comes straight from the CSS,
there's not any JavaScript involved.

45
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.613
And for the most part, people have used
media queries in terms of screen widths,

46
00:03:03.613 --> 00:03:06.820
minimum width,
maximum widths and so forth.

47
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.750
But media queries are much more than that.

48
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.420
Especially today we have a lot more types
of media queries that are supported.

49
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.310
You can do portrait or landscape.

50
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.630
You can do aspect ratios.

51
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.426
And you could do a print media
query because after all,

52
00:03:21.426 --> 00:03:25.110
media query is actually
all about the media.

53
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.001
So you can ask if you're just trying to
print out something as opposed to putting

54
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.050
it on the screen.

55
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.570
So keep that in mind as you
work with media queries.

56
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.620
They don't all have to be screen widths.

57
00:03:39.355 --> 00:03:43.300
So how does Ethan Marcotte
ideas hold up today?

58
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.516
Well, those grid base lands tend to
be associated a lot with frameworks,

59
00:03:47.516 --> 00:03:51.528
people tend to think of them as very
heavy and difficult to work with and

60
00:03:51.528 --> 00:03:55.608
I'm here to tell you it doesn't have
to be, not if you know what you're

61
00:03:55.608 --> 00:03:59.490
doing that in the images that
resize are often forgotten.

62
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.300
A lot of people just put up the same
picture across all of their devices.

63
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.247
Or they go after complicated solutions
may be something that's JavaScript base

64
00:04:09.247 --> 00:04:14.193
I'm here to tell you that's all baked
into HTML and it's well supported nothing

65
00:04:14.193 --> 00:04:18.702
could actually be easier than responsive
images a lot of developers today

66
00:04:18.702 --> 00:04:23.310
are trying to avoid media queries and
there may be some reasons for that.

67
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.451
I'm not sure if it's complicated CSS or
if it's performance that people

68
00:04:27.451 --> 00:04:32.020
are concerned about, but media queries
are not that difficult to understand.

69
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.515
I hope that after two days of working on
this stuff you have a better idea of how

70
00:04:36.515 --> 00:04:40.238
media queries work in CSS, and
how to read the code correctly,

71
00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:43.300
to understand where your
styles are coming from.

72
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.780
I suspect that's part of the reason
people don't like media queries.

73
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.804
And then of course everybody
comes along and says, well,

74
00:04:49.804 --> 00:04:52.620
container queries are gonna
solve all my problems.

75
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.620
Sub grid is gonna solve
all of my problems.

76
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.415
This is something that I've heard now for
twenty years.

77
00:04:58.415 --> 00:05:03.362
There`s always some latest hottest new
technology that's just out of reach that

78
00:05:03.362 --> 00:05:08.379
is going to solve all of our problems and
I'm here to tell you that's not true, they

79
00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:13.130
have very good technology right now that
you can work with even before you get.

80
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.766
Your queries and subgrid which are coming
I haven't covered them in this

81
00:05:17.766 --> 00:05:22.478
course because they're still under
development at this point in time but

82
00:05:22.478 --> 00:05:26.984
they will be here hopefully sometime soon
&gt;&gt; How do you decide on the media

83
00:05:26.984 --> 00:05:29.680
queries for your project?

84
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.440
&gt;&gt; How do I decide on the media
queries for my projects?

85
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.570
What looks good.

86
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.366
So in other words you don't tie your media
queries to devices because devices change

87
00:05:39.366 --> 00:05:41.800
every single day of the week.

88
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.016
So it's not going to be like the old days
where you can say definitively where

89
00:05:45.016 --> 00:05:46.990
exactly certain media
queries should be set.

90
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.733
Furthermore, you can have media
queries for one part of the page,

91
00:05:51.733 --> 00:05:55.510
because that part of the page needs
a certain set of media queries.

92
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.683
Then another part of the page maybe have a
different set of media queries associated

93
00:05:59.683 --> 00:06:02.450
with it to make it look
good across breakpoints.

94
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.662
So this is part of what I'm talking
about in terms of fragmenting

95
00:06:06.662 --> 00:06:09.640
the approach to responsive design now.

96
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.599
So that you can focus on smaller
parts of your page instead of

97
00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:17.718
media queries to control that part
of the page to make each each

98
00:06:17.718 --> 00:06:21.110
element on the page look
optimal in its layout.

99
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.904
So as you move forward working on
responsive design, keep in mind these

100
00:06:24.904 --> 00:06:28.764
guiding principles of the grid based
layout, the images that resize and

101
00:06:28.764 --> 00:06:33.390
their media queries as something that are
going to define what responsive design is.

102
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.270
Define what responsive layouts are?

103
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.813
But you don't have to strictly adhere to
them the way Ethan Marcotte described them

104
00:06:39.813 --> 00:06:41.490
11 years ago, at this point in time.
