1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.664
All right, so I'm gonna start here,
the next part is we're gonna talk

2
00:00:04.664 --> 00:00:08.406
about the header and
we're gonna talk about the navbar.

3
00:00:08.406 --> 00:00:12.481
And how we're gonna repurpose that over
a whole bunch of different breakpoints.

4
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:17.443
And we're gonna use Flexbox to lay this
all out because Flexbox is very cool

5
00:00:17.443 --> 00:00:19.190
when it comes to navbars.

6
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.050
It does amazing things, and again,

7
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.361
this is one of the big differentiators
between Flexbox and Grid.

8
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:28.726
Flexbox can do some things with the navbar
that are really just not possible

9
00:00:28.726 --> 00:00:29.425
with Grid.

10
00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:33.212
So let's take a look at our
screenshots for what we're going for.

11
00:00:33.212 --> 00:00:36.014
So here is the desktop
version of the navbar,

12
00:00:36.014 --> 00:00:38.831
notice here I've got
the logo in the middle.

13
00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:41.137
This tends to be a really
popular trend right now.

14
00:00:41.137 --> 00:00:44.207
How do we get a logo in
the middle of the navbar?

15
00:00:44.207 --> 00:00:46.121
When we go to a tablet, and

16
00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:50.299
we can put the logo on the top
with the navbar underneath.

17
00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:52.888
So how are we gonna
make that magic happen?

18
00:00:52.888 --> 00:00:59.911
And then finally on mobile, I've just set
these navigation buttons up as buttons.

19
00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:03.096
And in my advanced CSS layouts course,

20
00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:08.803
I do walk through how to do a hamburger
button solution using CSS only.

21
00:01:08.803 --> 00:01:13.763
So since I did that there, I thought
we'd do some different styling here

22
00:01:13.763 --> 00:01:18.738
to show you how to make buttons here
instead for your mobile navigation.

23
00:01:18.738 --> 00:01:23.881
There's only a few of these,
so the layout works.

24
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:31.088
Okay, so let's start then
with our HTML and our CSS.

25
00:01:31.088 --> 00:01:36.062
So the first thing we want to
do is we're going to have to put

26
00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:38.506
the HTML into this web page.

27
00:01:38.506 --> 00:01:42.519
So it's the header of the document, so
we want it to go probably at the top,

28
00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:44.198
probably before the mission.

29
00:01:44.198 --> 00:01:47.117
And so, in basic format,

30
00:01:47.117 --> 00:01:53.238
we're going to have a header,
all right, /header.

31
00:01:56.236 --> 00:01:59.881
Then inside of that we're gonna have what,
we're gonna have some navigation.

32
00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:09.101
One of the nice things about navigation is
that there's really only one correct way

33
00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:12.817
to code navigation on your website and
that is with an unordered list.

34
00:02:12.817 --> 00:02:17.181
That is all navigation is,
it is an unordered list of links.

35
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:20.119
You can visit them in
any particular order.

36
00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.514
I know the marketing department wants
them to go in a very specific order on

37
00:02:23.514 --> 00:02:24.188
the web page.

38
00:02:24.188 --> 00:02:29.176
And that's fine but it is not an ordered
list, it is an unordered list, so

39
00:02:29.176 --> 00:02:30.470
we can set that up.

40
00:02:37.364 --> 00:02:42.699
And then we can set up our four
navigation items that we have here.

41
00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:44.964
So we have an li, we have an a.

42
00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:49.706
We'll set these not to really go anywhere
in particular because we're not going to

43
00:02:49.706 --> 00:02:51.951
build a whole bunch of pages for these.

44
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:55.982
This is collections /a, /li and

45
00:02:55.982 --> 00:03:00.153
then we can just copy-paste that.

46
00:03:04.293 --> 00:03:10.285
So we have four of those and
we're going to have About,

47
00:03:10.285 --> 00:03:13.294
Contact, and Donations.

48
00:03:17.106 --> 00:03:20.920
Okay, straightforward enough,
that's a navbar.

49
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.324
And if we just take a look
at what we've got so

50
00:03:24.324 --> 00:03:28.625
far, Open it up in our default browser,

51
00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:33.586
that's what it should look like,
a tiny little navbar up there in the upper

52
00:03:33.586 --> 00:03:37.706
left hand corner with all ugly
blue underlined links, okay?

53
00:03:37.706 --> 00:03:40.903
So now what do we do in order
to get a logo on a page?

54
00:03:40.903 --> 00:03:43.942
Well, we're gonna make this
logo part of this navbar.

55
00:03:46.175 --> 00:03:50.286
So we can say /li /href
to make it a clickable,

56
00:03:53.813 --> 00:03:59.453
Clickable logo, it's gonna go somewhere,
probably back to the homepage.

57
00:03:59.453 --> 00:04:05.708
And then here for our image,
we're just simply going to say,

58
00:04:05.708 --> 00:04:10.410
img src,
the image source is going to be what?

59
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.525
Here it is, header logo.svg,
I put it outside of these folders.

60
00:04:15.525 --> 00:04:19.050
This is a new element that
you're going to want to grab,

61
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.058
so it is directly inside
of folder number five.

62
00:04:22.058 --> 00:04:25.864
Here's the file here
called headerlogo.svg,

63
00:04:25.864 --> 00:04:29.775
you can just drag that
into the images directory.

64
00:04:29.775 --> 00:04:31.464
Yes, go ahead and move it,

65
00:04:31.464 --> 00:04:35.734
you'll want to copy it to the end
folder if you're going to use that.

66
00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:39.549
And then we can get back to typing here,
so

67
00:04:39.549 --> 00:04:43.589
image source, image/headerlogo.svg.

68
00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:46.087
That's going to be our image here for
the logo.

69
00:04:46.087 --> 00:04:50.850
And then we of course
always need our alt text,

70
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.281
Wall of Wonder, Click for home.

71
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:56.028
I always like to add the Click for

72
00:04:56.028 --> 00:04:59.345
home at the end of my alt text
because it's a clickable logo.

73
00:04:59.345 --> 00:05:02.543
If we just say Wall of Wonder,
no one has any idea what it's there for.

74
00:05:02.543 --> 00:05:06.884
So, I always like to say Click for
home to indicate its purpose.

75
00:05:06.884 --> 00:05:11.770
And then we can close that,
close the link,

76
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.904
close the li, Save that.

77
00:05:19.938 --> 00:05:22.460
And once again when we refresh the page,

78
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.327
now you should see the logo up
there with its own bullet point.

79
00:05:26.327 --> 00:05:30.156
So the last thing that we probably
are going to wind up needing here,

80
00:05:30.156 --> 00:05:32.575
because once again we want to have yellow,

81
00:05:32.575 --> 00:05:35.478
we want it to stretch the full
width of the web page.

82
00:05:35.478 --> 00:05:39.516
We can add to this,
I'm gonna do the exactly same thing here,

83
00:05:39.516 --> 00:05:49.177
div with the class of header, And we can
close that div down here at the bottom.

84
00:05:50.863 --> 00:05:52.798
So that will style it up so

85
00:05:52.798 --> 00:05:57.605
that that header class gives us
the yellow all the way across.

86
00:05:57.605 --> 00:06:02.330
Then the header which is the more
meaningful, more semantic tag is a one

87
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.471
level in, that is gonna contain our
navigation bar and our logo and so forth.

88
00:06:07.471 --> 00:06:11.984
&gt;&gt; Sometimes when I make a web page and
the footer displays kind of in

89
00:06:11.984 --> 00:06:16.263
the center of the screen,
it's not sticking to the bottom.

90
00:06:16.263 --> 00:06:18.602
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; What's the solution for that?

91
00:06:18.602 --> 00:06:22.176
&gt;&gt; Well if your footer is displaying in
the middle of the page and it's on top of

92
00:06:22.176 --> 00:06:25.948
some stuff, then you were probably using
some kind of positioning with that.

93
00:06:25.948 --> 00:06:29.747
Often it's sticky positioning or
it's fixed positioning that

94
00:06:29.747 --> 00:06:33.622
you're using with your footer and
that can do some weird things.

95
00:06:33.622 --> 00:06:38.821
If you are using regular old position
static styling, that's the default for

96
00:06:38.821 --> 00:06:44.112
all HTML elements unless you change
the position property to some other value.

97
00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:47.768
Your footer should always be at
the bottom of the web page or

98
00:06:47.768 --> 00:06:51.808
in the source order, exactly in
the order in which it should go.

99
00:06:51.808 --> 00:06:55.412
Unless you're talking about the footer
shows up in the middle of a web page

100
00:06:55.412 --> 00:06:56.761
because the page is short.

101
00:06:56.761 --> 00:06:58.043
Is that the other problem?

102
00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:00.374
And that would be the other issue.

103
00:07:00.374 --> 00:07:03.778
Remember, what I told you
earlier is that the height of

104
00:07:03.778 --> 00:07:06.970
the content determines
the height of the web page.

105
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.549
So the content by default, if you only
have a tiny little bit of content,

106
00:07:11.549 --> 00:07:15.752
then that footer is definitely
gonna come up and show up wherever,

107
00:07:15.752 --> 00:07:18.548
in the middle of the page or
someplace else.

108
00:07:18.548 --> 00:07:22.602
Wherever that content ends and
the footer is coming up right after it.

109
00:07:22.602 --> 00:07:27.142
So if you don't want that type of effect
you could always set some kind of

110
00:07:27.142 --> 00:07:29.423
height somewhere on your web page.

111
00:07:29.423 --> 00:07:31.800
Or tell Flexbox to stretch.

112
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.941
Or some combination of those types of
things to try to push the footer down to

113
00:07:35.941 --> 00:07:36.674
the bottom.

114
00:07:36.674 --> 00:07:39.862
So that would be something that
I would think about there too.
