1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.817
All right, so I'm gonna start here,

2
00:00:02.817 --> 00:00:05.926
the next part is we're gonna
talk about the header.

3
00:00:05.926 --> 00:00:07.943
And we're gonna talk about the nav bar,

4
00:00:07.943 --> 00:00:12.550
and how we're going to repurpose that over
a whole bunch of different breakpoints.

5
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.370
And we're going to use Flexbox to lay this
all out, because Flexbox is very cool.

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.546
When it comes to NAV bars,
it does amazing thing and again,

7
00:00:20.546 --> 00:00:24.450
this is one of the big differentiators
between Flexbox and grid.

8
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.411
Flexbox can do some things with
the navbar that are really

9
00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:28.959
just not possible with grid.

10
00:00:28.959 --> 00:00:33.795
So, let's take a look at our screenshots
for what we're going for so,

11
00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:36.800
here is the desktop version of the navbar.

12
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.537
Notice here I've got the logo in the
middle, this tends to be a really popular

13
00:00:40.537 --> 00:00:43.660
trend right now, how do we get
a logo in the middle of the navbar?

14
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.440
When we go to a tablet, and we can put the
logo on the top with a nav bar underneath,

15
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.090
so how are we going to
make that magic happen?

16
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.110
And then finally on mobile,

17
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.666
I've just set these up these
navigation buttons up as buttons.

18
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:02.867
And in my advanced CSS layouts course,

19
00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:08.591
I do walk through how to do a hamburger
button solution using CSS only.

20
00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:14.000
So since I did that there I thought
we do some different styling

21
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.774
here to show you how to make buttons
here instead for your mobile navigation.

22
00:01:20.774 --> 00:01:21.915
There's only a few of these so
it the layout works okay so

23
00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:22.829
let's start then with our HTML and
our CSS.

24
00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:28.348
So the first thing we want to do is we're

25
00:01:28.348 --> 00:01:35.038
going to have to put
the HTML into this web page,

26
00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:40.244
so it's the header of the document.

27
00:01:40.244 --> 00:01:46.492
So we want it to go probably at the top
probably before the mission and

28
00:01:46.492 --> 00:01:53.412
so, in basic format, we're going to
have a header right, slash header.

29
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.830
Then inside of that, we're gonna have
what we're gonna have some navigation.

30
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.724
One of the nice things about navigation is
that there's really only one correct way

31
00:02:08.724 --> 00:02:12.950
to code navigation on your website,
and that is with an unordered list.

32
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.349
That is all navigation is it is
an unordered list of links they can,

33
00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.606
you can visit them in
any particular order.

34
00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:23.164
I know the marketing department wants
them to go in a very specific order on

35
00:02:23.164 --> 00:02:24.053
the web page.

36
00:02:24.053 --> 00:02:28.496
And that's fine but it is there's not
an ordered list and is an unordered list.

37
00:02:28.496 --> 00:02:35.408
So we can set that up, and
then we can set up our for

38
00:02:35.408 --> 00:02:40.633
navigation items that we have here,

39
00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:44.859
so we have an LI, we have an A.

40
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.730
We'll set these not to really go
anywhere in particular because

41
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.300
we're not going to build
a whole bunch of pages for

42
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.575
these collections slash a slash li,
and then we can just copy paste that.

43
00:03:04.345 --> 00:03:07.332
So we have four of those, and

44
00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:13.232
we're going to have about contact and
donations.

45
00:03:13.232 --> 00:03:19.708
Okay, straightforward enough,
that's an app bar and

46
00:03:19.708 --> 00:03:25.095
if we just take a look at
what we've got so far.

47
00:03:25.095 --> 00:03:31.075
Open it up in our default browser, that's
what it should look l tiny little nav bar

48
00:03:31.075 --> 00:03:37.250
up there in the upper left hand corner,
with all ugly blue underlined links, okay?

49
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.116
So now what do we do in order
to get a logo on the page well,

50
00:03:42.116 --> 00:03:46.569
we're gonna make this logo
part of this navbar, so

51
00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.210
we can say to make it a clickable.

52
00:03:52.726 --> 00:03:59.580
Clickable logo it's gonna go somewhere,
probably back to the homepage.

53
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.302
And then here for our image,
we're just simply going to

54
00:04:05.302 --> 00:04:10.435
say img src,
the image source is going to be what?

55
00:04:10.435 --> 00:04:14.573
Here it is header logo dot SVG I
put it outside of these folders,

56
00:04:14.573 --> 00:04:18.570
this is a new a new element that
you're going to want to grab.

57
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.329
So it is directly inside
a folder number five,

58
00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.320
here's the file here called
header logo dot SVG.

59
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.610
You can just drag that into the images
directory, yes going ahead and move it.

60
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.858
You'll want to copy it to the end
folder if you're going to use that and

61
00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:38.170
then we can, get back to typing here.

62
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.014
So Image Source Image
slash header logo dot SVG,

63
00:04:42.014 --> 00:04:46.350
that's going to be our image here for
the logo.

64
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.758
And then we need of course,

65
00:04:48.758 --> 00:04:53.900
always need our alt text while of wonder,
click for home.

66
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.782
I always like to add a click for
home at the end of my all text,

67
00:04:57.782 --> 00:04:59.958
because it's a clickable logo,

68
00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:04.484
If we just say while of wonder no one
has any idea what it's there for.

69
00:05:04.484 --> 00:05:09.008
So I always like to say click for
home to indicate its purpose,

70
00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:12.840
then we can close that close the link,
close the Li.

71
00:05:16.048 --> 00:05:16.902
Save that.

72
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.388
And once again when we refresh the page,

73
00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:25.880
now you should see the logo up
there with its own bullet point.

74
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.855
So the last thing that we probably
are going to wind up meeting here,

75
00:05:29.855 --> 00:05:32.382
because once again we want to have yellow.

76
00:05:32.382 --> 00:05:36.513
We want it to stretch the full width
of the web page, we can add to this,

77
00:05:36.513 --> 00:05:40.870
and I'm going to do exactly the same
thing here Div with a class of header.

78
00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:52.588
And we can close that div down here are at
the bottom, so that will style it up so

79
00:05:52.588 --> 00:05:57.500
that header class gives us
the yellow all the way across.

80
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.322
Then the header which is the more
meaningful more semantic tag is one level

81
00:06:02.322 --> 00:06:07.010
in that is going to contain our
navigation bar and our logo and so forth.

82
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.704
&gt;&gt; Sometimes when I make a web page and
the footer displays

83
00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:15.990
kind of in the center of the screen,
It's not sticking to the bottom.

84
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.960
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Whats the solution for that?

85
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.620
&gt;&gt; Well, your footer is displaying
in the middle of the page and

86
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.570
on top of some stuff.

87
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.717
Then you were probably using some kind of
positioning with that often it's sticky

88
00:06:26.717 --> 00:06:31.330
positioning or it's fixed positioning
that you're using with your footer.

89
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.411
And that can do some weird things if you
are using regular old position static

90
00:06:35.411 --> 00:06:36.001
styling.

91
00:06:36.001 --> 00:06:37.495
That's the default for

92
00:06:37.495 --> 00:06:42.505
all HTML elements unless you change
the position property in some other value.

93
00:06:42.505 --> 00:06:45.735
Your footer show always be at
the bottom of the web page or

94
00:06:45.735 --> 00:06:49.733
in the source order exactly in
the order in which it should go unless.

95
00:06:49.733 --> 00:06:54.248
You're talking about the footer shows
up in the middle of the web page,

96
00:06:54.248 --> 00:06:58.020
because the page is short is
that is that the other problem.

97
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.951
And that would be the other issue
remember, what I told you earlier is that

98
00:07:02.951 --> 00:07:06.330
the height of the content determines
the height of the web page.

99
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:11.088
So the content by default, if you only
have a tiny little bit of content,

100
00:07:11.088 --> 00:07:14.133
then that footer is
definitely gonna come up.

101
00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:18.053
And show up wherever in the middle
of the page or someplace else,

102
00:07:18.053 --> 00:07:22.350
wherever that content ends and
the footer is coming up right after it.

103
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.966
So if you don't want that type of effect
you you could always set some kind of

104
00:07:26.966 --> 00:07:29.185
height somewhere on your webpage.

105
00:07:29.185 --> 00:07:33.577
Or tell Flexbox to stretch or some
combination of those types of things to

106
00:07:33.577 --> 00:07:36.241
try to push the footer down to the bottom,
so

107
00:07:36.241 --> 00:07:39.850
that would be something that I
would think about there too.
