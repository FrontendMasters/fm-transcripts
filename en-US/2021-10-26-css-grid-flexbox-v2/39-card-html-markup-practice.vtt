00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.216
This last example that I'd like to
go through is card-based layouts,

2
00:00:04.216 --> 00:00:06.867
but we're really going
to shake things up and

3
00:00:06.867 --> 00:00:10.723
push cards probably farther than
you have looked at them before.

4
00:00:10.723 --> 00:00:15.543
So what I'm going to do first is I'm
going to talk through some of the HTML

5
00:00:15.543 --> 00:00:18.561
that might be used to
put this card together.

6
00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:22.511
Just so to show you how you can think
through the most semantic markup that

7
00:00:22.511 --> 00:00:24.011
you might be using on that.

8
00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:27.939
And then we're going to mix
up both Flexbox and grid,

9
00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.844
then dealing with these cards and
this layout on our next code pep.

10
00:00:32.844 --> 00:00:36.186
So as always the starting
code pen is available,

11
00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:40.111
inside of the chapter 14 on
the website for the course.

12
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:45.223
So let's start here and
we have a series of four items here for

13
00:00:45.223 --> 00:00:47.539
this particular webpage.

14
00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.465
And they all have the same type of content
so I'm just going to focus on this

15
00:00:52.465 --> 00:00:57.165
first one and then I'll give you a few
minutes to code the other three.

16
00:00:57.165 --> 00:01:01.197
So let's look at what we have here
what we have given been given here in

17
00:01:01.197 --> 00:01:02.178
our notations.

18
00:01:02.178 --> 00:01:04.698
So we have a section
with an ID of artists,

19
00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:08.160
this might eventually be
something you wanna plug into.

20
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.983
Either the page that you
are looking at here,

21
00:01:10.983 --> 00:01:13.733
the homepage that we've
been working on and

22
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:18.432
might become part of the inside page or
an additional page in this website.

23
00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:22.682
So let's set it up from the start with
that section with an ID of artists.

24
00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:28.139
And I'd given that section a heading
because sections require headings and

25
00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:33.691
we're given an h2 because there's
likely an h1 elsewhere on the website.

26
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:37.914
After that, then we have basically
these units of content that

27
00:01:37.914 --> 00:01:39.994
have almost no markup in them.

28
00:01:39.994 --> 00:01:45.939
So I have here,
the words mixed media Anni Roenkae.

29
00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.499
I'm sorry if I pronounced your name
wrong Anni Roenkae the image and

30
00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:54.821
then a little bit of a description
with a link to any ranky.com.

31
00:01:54.821 --> 00:01:59.280
So how are we going to go
about marking this up?

32
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.380
This is reflective of a trend that we
have seen quite a bit in cards where

33
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.929
often those words mixed media or teensy
tiny they're at the top of the card.

34
00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.800
And then Anni Roenkae who is the focus of

35
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.332
this card would be in larger type
because this is our artists.

36
00:02:17.332 --> 00:02:21.981
That's the main Identifier of
the section of the website.

37
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:24.184
Anni Roenkae is an artist.

38
00:02:24.184 --> 00:02:27.401
So she's the next most important thing.

39
00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:32.673
And the fact that she works in mixed
media is the third most important thing.

40
00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:37.298
So that would indicate in
terms of our headings that

41
00:02:37.298 --> 00:02:42.134
our artists is the H2 Anni Roenkae
would be the H3 and

42
00:02:42.134 --> 00:02:45.481
mixed media whines of being the H4.

43
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:48.761
But it does mean it looks like
those headings are out of order.

44
00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:49.851
And that's okay.

45
00:02:49.851 --> 00:02:54.547
You can in fact put your headings out of
order if you're trying to tell the story

46
00:02:54.547 --> 00:02:58.762
in the way that I just told you,
our artists Anni Roenkae Mixed Media.

47
00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:03.412
So let's start by putting
in that particular markup.

48
00:03:03.412 --> 00:03:06.674
This will be mixed media is the H4 here.

49
00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:16.601
And then Anni Roenkae will be the H3,
okay,

50
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:23.760
then we're going to have
our image here in place.

51
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.254
I've given you the image
because here in code pen,

52
00:03:26.254 --> 00:03:29.391
you have to have a pro version of
code pen in order to host images.

53
00:03:29.391 --> 00:03:31.722
And you would know what the URL was for
the image.

54
00:03:31.722 --> 00:03:34.673
So I've given you that
along with the alt text.

55
00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:39.146
After that we have a bit of text
here that is the description of

56
00:03:39.146 --> 00:03:40.911
what's going on here.

57
00:03:40.911 --> 00:03:45.764
This description of the artist that
is of course is just a paragraph so

58
00:03:45.764 --> 00:03:47.781
we'll mark that up as such.

59
00:03:47.781 --> 00:03:50.520
And then I just put in the words
down here on the bottom.

60
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.172
Be sure to link to this
website that's her website,

61
00:03:56.172 --> 00:03:59.384
so we'll just mark that up and

62
00:03:59.384 --> 00:04:04.521
we can say something like
make it a paragraph and

63
00:04:04.521 --> 00:04:11.086
then an A h ref = ''
https://www.anniroenkae.com.

64
00:04:13.517 --> 00:04:18.554
We'll make it open in a new window,
target = "_blank.

65
00:04:23.364 --> 00:04:27.494
_blank, and then we can say visit.

66
00:04:27.494 --> 00:04:32.924
website / a/ P.

67
00:04:32.924 --> 00:04:38.732
Okay, so that's sort of the general markup
of the text that we've been given here.

68
00:04:38.732 --> 00:04:42.933
Now we need to think a little bit
more about how we would mark up or

69
00:04:42.933 --> 00:04:47.873
indicate that this is one unit of text,
whatever that unit happens to be.

70
00:04:47.873 --> 00:04:51.884
So many of you are probably thinking
well we should take all of this and

71
00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:55.983
we should probably just wrap div
around it that would be one approach.

72
00:04:55.983 --> 00:04:59.732
But I think we could argue that
we're a little bit more specific

73
00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:04.558
here this chunk of information could
potentially show up on a syndication feed.

74
00:05:04.558 --> 00:05:05.802
And it stands alone and

75
00:05:05.802 --> 00:05:09.220
tells its own story we can see
that this is a mixed media thing.

76
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.111
It's Anni Roenkae's work.

77
00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:11.222
Here's an example of her work.

78
00:05:11.222 --> 00:05:13.001
Here's a little bit of
information about her.

79
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:15.798
There's a whole little mini
story in this chunk of content.

80
00:05:15.798 --> 00:05:19.190
And if that's the case,
then you can make use of the article tag.

81
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.153
So we'll start this with article and
we'll end it with slash article.

82
00:05:29.732 --> 00:05:34.722
Okay, so that is my thoughts on how
we would go about marking this up.

83
00:05:34.722 --> 00:05:39.071
And as always, good markup is the best
way to start this type of thing.

84
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:41.995
You can go through and
mark up all the rest of these,

85
00:05:41.995 --> 00:05:44.515
then we'll go on to
the styling after that.

86
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.262
Now we're gonna take
a quick peek at my markup.

87
00:05:55.262 --> 00:05:58.920
It looks pretty much
exactly like the first one.

88
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.011
It's just a series of articles
that I have here on this webpage.

89
00:06:03.011 --> 00:06:06.229
So the next thing that I
need to think about is,

90
00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:10.116
as I keep telling you the whole
way through this course.

91
00:06:10.116 --> 00:06:13.967
The whole secret of managing layout,
whether you're working with Flexbox or

92
00:06:13.967 --> 00:06:18.130
you're working with get grid is
managing parents and children.

93
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.073
One of the things that we're going to need
to do in this website is treat each of

94
00:06:23.073 --> 00:06:25.442
these particular units of content.

95
00:06:25.442 --> 00:06:27.934
In this case they happen
to be the articles.

96
00:06:27.934 --> 00:06:31.203
We want to make sure that we can
grab on to those articles and

97
00:06:31.203 --> 00:06:35.130
manipulate them in whatever way
we want in terms of layout.

98
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:40.381
Then we might also manipulate what goes
on inside of the article for its layout.

99
00:06:40.381 --> 00:06:45.117
So we've got two types of layouts
that we might be working on here with

100
00:06:45.117 --> 00:06:46.921
these particular cards.

101
00:06:46.921 --> 00:06:49.881
So let's take a quick peek
at how our parents and

102
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:52.767
children are configured
inside of our HTML and

103
00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:57.282
see if we need to add anything before
we move on to the layout side of this.

104
00:06:57.282 --> 00:07:02.328
So here in code pen if you go to
the little down arrow next to the HTML and

105
00:07:02.328 --> 00:07:03.635
you say fold all.

106
00:07:03.635 --> 00:07:08.193
I had problems getting this
working in Firefox myself.

107
00:07:08.193 --> 00:07:11.767
That seems to be working in Chrome
which is what I'm using now it seems to

108
00:07:11.767 --> 00:07:13.086
be working there better.

109
00:07:13.086 --> 00:07:17.918
You fold it all up it folds all into
the single section element which contains

110
00:07:17.918 --> 00:07:21.932
everything we're working with
if you hit the down arrow once.

111
00:07:21.932 --> 00:07:26.749
It'll show you that we now have
the following children of the section,

112
00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:29.973
we have the H2, and
we have our four articles.

113
00:07:29.973 --> 00:07:35.114
So that means that if
I was to do something

114
00:07:35.114 --> 00:07:40.710
here in my CSS and say, let's say artists,

115
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:46.623
the artists ID here, and
I said display grid.

116
00:07:46.623 --> 00:07:52.881
What would happen is and
let's say grid template columns.

117
00:07:52.881 --> 00:07:58.719
And let's say I wanted to do something

118
00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:03.466
like repeat four comma one fr.

119
00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:08.692
The H2 becomes part of this particular
issue here on the webpage see

120
00:08:08.692 --> 00:08:14.110
that because the H2 is a child of
artists as are all of these articles.

121
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.282
So even though I just
said make four columns,

122
00:08:17.282 --> 00:08:21.455
grid will do its best it says,
Okay, I made four columns and

123
00:08:21.455 --> 00:08:25.967
I put in the H2 and the first
three articles into those columns.

124
00:08:25.967 --> 00:08:27.826
Oops, I have an extra item.

125
00:08:27.826 --> 00:08:31.457
I'll add another row and I'll start
populating my columns from there.

126
00:08:31.457 --> 00:08:35.440
So that is exactly what just
happened with this particular lab.

127
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.562
Deanna around that problem.

128
00:08:36.562 --> 00:08:39.692
We're going to have to group
together our articles in some way.

129
00:08:39.692 --> 00:08:43.095
So you actually don't
need that CSS at all.

130
00:08:43.095 --> 00:08:44.701
We're not gonna use it.

131
00:08:44.701 --> 00:08:48.992
What we'll add to this then is a dif.

132
00:08:48.992 --> 00:08:53.014
With a class of,
I've just called it "articlewrap",

133
00:08:55.691 --> 00:08:59.880
And because that's the whole purpose
is to wrap around this article,

134
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.720
it serves no purpose whatsoever in
communicating anything about this webpage.

135
00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.750
The whole purpose of this
div Is to hold a class and

136
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:15.155
to give us a an environment for laying
out our cards in some method or another.

137
00:09:15.155 --> 00:09:19.826
So that is the last thing that we need to
add to our HTML before we're ready to move

138
00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:22.080
on and do some styling to what we have.
