1
00:00:00.187 --> 00:00:01.886
Now where did I get those numbers from?

2
00:00:01.886 --> 00:00:05.137
I'm sure you were wondering,
where did I get 22% from?

3
00:00:05.137 --> 00:00:09.308
For my next row here,
with my next two set of boxes,

4
00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:13.965
how are we going to specify
the flex spaces for those, and

5
00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:16.989
how do we know how the math works out?

6
00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:18.842
So let me show you how that works.

7
00:00:18.842 --> 00:00:23.018
So let's draw out, for example,

8
00:00:23.018 --> 00:00:31.783
our four boxes, There they are,
one, two, three, four.

9
00:00:31.783 --> 00:00:35.546
And we've already set
our gap to be 4% each.

10
00:00:35.546 --> 00:00:41.663
So here's 4%, 4%, 4%,
because this is space between,

11
00:00:41.663 --> 00:00:46.326
so there's no gap on
the outside of these boxes.

12
00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:48.670
There's only a gap in between.

13
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.529
So that is our layout for
our 4 box layout.

14
00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:54.965
So that's 12%, right?

15
00:00:54.965 --> 00:00:59.559
12%, 4 plus 4 plus 4, 12%.

16
00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.965
Subtract that from 100%,
and we wind up with 88%.

17
00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:07.360
That's what we have leftover.

18
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.727
So now we'll have to divide that by 4.

19
00:01:11.727 --> 00:01:14.061
And we wind up with 22%.

20
00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:16.933
That's gonna be the width
of each of our boxes.

21
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:20.618
In order to make this,
add up to 100% on our row,

22
00:01:20.618 --> 00:01:22.013
&gt;&gt; The gap is only for

23
00:01:22.013 --> 00:01:27.323
horizontal spacing or is it also
associated with access concepts?

24
00:01:27.323 --> 00:01:31.311
&gt;&gt; Well, because we have all of
these contained inside of a row,

25
00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:35.040
this gap is only going to
be in between our boxes.

26
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.594
If we had our flex boxes all wrapping
on to another, just wrapping in space

27
00:01:39.594 --> 00:01:44.001
all the way down the page as opposed
to putting them in artificial rows,

28
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:47.764
I think you get a little bit of
gap in between the rows as well.

29
00:01:47.764 --> 00:01:53.147
But that is not a thing with
the markup that we have here.

30
00:01:53.147 --> 00:01:58.863
All right, so now,
if I were to make a double box, right,

31
00:01:58.863 --> 00:02:04.680
I want this to span across two
of these columns on the page.

32
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.955
So I have 22%, right, and

33
00:02:08.955 --> 00:02:12.375
22% in my two boxes.

34
00:02:14.085 --> 00:02:20.812
So this larger box is
gonna have to be 22+22+4,

35
00:02:20.812 --> 00:02:24.479
right, that gap in between.

36
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:33.182
So that total comes to 48%, right?

37
00:02:33.182 --> 00:02:34.039
So let's set that up.

38
00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:43.495
Let's set up a class here.

39
00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:45.484
We'll call it span2.

40
00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:55.080
And we'll set the flex-basis to 48%, okay?

41
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.406
Set the flex-basis to 48%.

42
00:02:57.406 --> 00:03:02.852
Then all we need to do is apply
that class here in our HTML.

43
00:03:02.852 --> 00:03:06.576
So here on row 2,
we have these two figures,

44
00:03:06.576 --> 00:03:11.182
and I am going to say the figure
has a class of span2, and

45
00:03:11.182 --> 00:03:18.693
the next figure has a class of, span2.

46
00:03:21.778 --> 00:03:22.732
So there we go.

47
00:03:22.732 --> 00:03:27.900
All of our boxes are all lining up very,
very nicely, okay?

48
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.261
If you do wind up wanting a little
bit of space in between these rows,

49
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:36.775
you could certainly add here to your
row class, you could do something

50
00:03:36.775 --> 00:03:41.392
like margin-bottom, for example,
of whatever 1rem or something.

51
00:03:41.392 --> 00:03:46.121
That would give you a little bit
of space in between the rows,

52
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:49.384
if that was important to you, all right?

53
00:03:49.384 --> 00:03:52.183
Or you could just leave that out.

54
00:03:52.183 --> 00:03:54.919
It just sort of depends on
what your design is, and

55
00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:59.165
what it is you're trying to build as to
whether you would include that or not.

56
00:04:02.394 --> 00:04:07.361
Okay, so I wanna give you like 30 seconds,

57
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:15.742
see if you can figure out what the values
then would be for span3 and span4.

58
00:04:15.742 --> 00:04:20.455
These are going to be
the classes that we're going to

59
00:04:20.455 --> 00:04:25.176
apply here on row number 2,
sorry, row number 3.

60
00:04:25.176 --> 00:04:28.262
So we have one box that's
gonna take up three columns,

61
00:04:28.262 --> 00:04:30.149
one box that takes up one column.

62
00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:34.735
And then on row 4, we have one giant
box going all the way across the row.

63
00:04:34.735 --> 00:04:40.299
So do some quick math, and see if you can
figure out what those happened to be.

64
00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:43.252
Okay, so let's just check in on that then.

65
00:04:43.252 --> 00:04:47.899
So here on row number 3, we're gonna have

66
00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:52.555
our figure with a class of span3, right?

67
00:04:52.555 --> 00:04:58.041
And here on row 4, we're gonna have
a figure with a class of span4.

68
00:04:58.041 --> 00:05:02.275
So that's pretty simple on the HTML.

69
00:05:02.275 --> 00:05:06.858
And then here in our CSS,
what are these values wind up being?

70
00:05:06.858 --> 00:05:11.411
So our flex-basis is going to be what?

71
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.699
Anybody?

72
00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:13.541
Does anybody know,
can you put it in the chat?

73
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:16.344
&gt;&gt; I'm seeing several different answers.

74
00:05:16.344 --> 00:05:18.948
&gt;&gt; Several different answers, okay.

75
00:05:18.948 --> 00:05:24.159
&gt;&gt; 74%, 72, 76, 74.

76
00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:28.311
&gt;&gt; 72, 74 or 76%, which one is it?

77
00:05:28.311 --> 00:05:33.206
Okay, so let's see.

78
00:05:33.206 --> 00:05:37.731
We've got now four boxes or

79
00:05:37.731 --> 00:05:41.478
three boxes, right?

80
00:05:41.478 --> 00:05:46.285
So 1, 2, 3, 22, 22, 22,
right, so far, so good?

81
00:05:46.285 --> 00:05:49.768
That's 66.
And then we've got 4 and 4.

82
00:05:49.768 --> 00:05:51.600
So another eight in between.

83
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.658
You don't have to worry about the space
that's on the outside of the box cuz

84
00:05:55.658 --> 00:05:56.335
there isn't any.

85
00:05:56.335 --> 00:05:59.399
We're using space between,
so there's no outside space,

86
00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:02.052
it's only in between the boxes
that we have the gap.

87
00:06:02.052 --> 00:06:05.950
So if you said 74%, you are a winner.

88
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:08.510
Nicely done.

89
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.667
Okay, so when we go back here,
it'll be 74%.

90
00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:23.286
And then for span4,
what is its flex-basis?

91
00:06:23.286 --> 00:06:23.948
&gt;&gt; 100.

92
00:06:23.948 --> 00:06:25.363
&gt;&gt; 100%.

93
00:06:25.363 --> 00:06:28.406
Hopefully you said 100%.

94
00:06:28.406 --> 00:06:33.760
4 boxes of 22% each, that's 88%.

95
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.706
3 gaps of 4 each, that's another 12.

96
00:06:36.706 --> 00:06:38.665
So it went into being 100%.

97
00:06:38.665 --> 00:06:42.689
So we've got our row 1, that looks good.

98
00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:44.574
Row 2, that looks good.

99
00:06:44.574 --> 00:06:47.174
Row 3, that looks good.

100
00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:49.227
Row 4 is stretching all the way across.

101
00:06:49.227 --> 00:06:52.820
The only last thing we have to do
now here is with row number 5.

102
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.588
And if we take a look at
our HTML in row number 5,

103
00:06:58.588 --> 00:07:01.920
I set a 1-2-1 distribution.

104
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.807
But I'm actually going to put here for
figure,

105
00:07:07.807 --> 00:07:12.502
the first figure I'm gonna say span or
class=span2.

106
00:07:12.502 --> 00:07:16.250
Because we may actually
want this particular box,

107
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:21.770
presumably the bigger box has got
the important information in it.

108
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.140
So in terms of the order on the page,

109
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.221
we will want that to be
listed first in the row.

110
00:07:27.221 --> 00:07:32.778
And then the supporting elements
which are presumably in

111
00:07:32.778 --> 00:07:38.231
the smaller boxes are going
to be here later in this row.

112
00:07:38.231 --> 00:07:41.490
Sorry, we actually don't even need
to put any classes in here for this.

113
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:47.367
So we should have then one fat box, right?

114
00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:53.670
There it is, our our span of 2,
and then there's 2 individuals.

115
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:59.013
So now how are we going to make this go to
that 1-2-1 configuration that I mentioned,

116
00:07:59.013 --> 00:07:59.879
what do we do?

117
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.260
Anybody have any suggestions for
what we could do to fix that problem?

118
00:08:09.599 --> 00:08:12.499
Anyone have any suggestions in the chat?

119
00:08:12.499 --> 00:08:13.492
&gt;&gt; Order.

120
00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:17.345
&gt;&gt; Order, yep, so
we're gonna set up some order properties.

121
00:08:17.345 --> 00:08:23.586
And so I'm just gonna call mine order-1,

122
00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:28.477
which will have order: 1 [LAUGH],

123
00:08:28.477 --> 00:08:33.368
order-2 will be order: 2, and

124
00:08:33.368 --> 00:08:39.454
order-3 will be order number 3, okay?

125
00:08:39.454 --> 00:08:46.745
So we can just set those
up as individual classes.

126
00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:53.635
And then once you have those in place,
you can just apply them to your HTML.

127
00:08:53.635 --> 00:09:00.814
So we now have a class of span2,
and the class of order-2, okay?

128
00:09:00.814 --> 00:09:04.078
So both.
Remember classes you can stack up more

129
00:09:04.078 --> 00:09:07.803
than one in your individual declarations.

130
00:09:07.803 --> 00:09:13.917
And then maybe this one here, the second
figure will have a class of order-1.

131
00:09:17.025 --> 00:09:25.049
And maybe this last one will
have a class of In order-3.

132
00:09:26.742 --> 00:09:31.703
And if you scroll on down there,
it should all work out for you.

133
00:09:31.703 --> 00:09:36.272
&gt;&gt; Just in terms of if any of
the elements had focusable

134
00:09:36.272 --> 00:09:41.479
elements inside of them when we
want to change the order for

135
00:09:41.479 --> 00:09:44.576
accessibility reasons, right?

136
00:09:44.576 --> 00:09:48.975
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you definitely have to factor
that into your choice of ordering and so

137
00:09:48.975 --> 00:09:50.910
forth here, yes, absolutely.
