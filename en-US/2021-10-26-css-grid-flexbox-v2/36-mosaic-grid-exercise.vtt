00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.589
So now that you've had some time
to work with grid a little bit,

2
00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:06.041
see a couple of things demonstrated here.

3
00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:10.536
Now it's time to apply this to
the web page that we were working on,

4
00:00:10.536 --> 00:00:12.864
sort of as an isolation first, and

5
00:00:12.864 --> 00:00:17.713
then you're going to incorporate it
into the homepage of the website.

6
00:00:17.713 --> 00:00:22.165
So let's start with 12A,
we're in chapter 12 now,

7
00:00:22.165 --> 00:00:26.262
that's all of the files
are available up on GitHub.

8
00:00:26.262 --> 00:00:28.906
And if you take a look
inside of the website for

9
00:00:28.906 --> 00:00:31.900
the course,
you'll see the instructions here for

10
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.323
this part of the course and
what you need to do and so forth.

11
00:00:35.323 --> 00:00:38.781
So what we've got here
first is the mosaic grid.

12
00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:43.543
So one of the popular things that people
are doing these days is taking a bunch of

13
00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:48.452
images or perhaps portrait and orientation
and landscape and orientation, and

14
00:00:48.452 --> 00:00:52.664
they're putting them together in
some kind of cool looking layout.

15
00:00:52.664 --> 00:00:57.522
And so we've done that here with
the pop art collection of images,

16
00:00:57.522 --> 00:01:01.338
and this is what it should
look like here on desktop,

17
00:01:01.338 --> 00:01:04.744
you see the layout of all
of these images here.

18
00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:07.938
This is something that we wouldn't
be able to achieve with Flexbox.

19
00:01:07.938 --> 00:01:11.301
Before we were just put
a series of images rows,

20
00:01:11.301 --> 00:01:14.840
now we need to think about
this in two dimensions.

21
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.809
So this is how I'd like it
to look here on desktop,

22
00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:20.796
it will actually work just
fine as well on tablet.

23
00:01:20.796 --> 00:01:24.920
And then when we go to a mobile layout,
this is the way that it's going to look,

24
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.310
we're gonna pile these
on top of each other.

25
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.459
So in this first exercise, what I'm gonna
need for you to do is to first of all,

26
00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:37.456
of course, repeat what I just showed you,
take your figures and your figure

27
00:01:37.456 --> 00:01:42.162
captions and get them to overlap each
other, write the code to do that.

28
00:01:42.162 --> 00:01:47.174
And then what I'd like for you to do is to
write the grid layout here for desktop.

29
00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:49.204
Get all of the images here,

30
00:01:49.204 --> 00:01:54.955
looking great in this one document in
isolation and get it working on mobile.

31
00:01:54.955 --> 00:01:57.714
So that will be step number one.

32
00:01:57.714 --> 00:02:02.244
Once you have that in place, if you
still have a little bit of extra time,

33
00:02:02.244 --> 00:02:05.883
then I'd like you to go to
the homepage of the website, and

34
00:02:05.883 --> 00:02:07.915
I'd like you to drop in pop art.

35
00:02:07.915 --> 00:02:11.255
So we're gonna take out
the collections layout that we did,

36
00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:13.481
then just had everything row by row, and

37
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:17.034
we're gonna drop in this pop art
layout in the web page instead.

38
00:02:17.034 --> 00:02:21.187
If you wanna keep the collections
part of the homepage and

39
00:02:21.187 --> 00:02:25.872
just add on the pop art piece of this,
that's totally okay too.

40
00:02:25.872 --> 00:02:30.030
So when you put together your code for
the first part of this challenge,

41
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.039
the 12A mosaic grid by itself, think about
the code that you used in this homepage.

42
00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:37.980
So you probably wanna set
this up as a section.

43
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.670
You probably wanna set up the HTML
accordingly to match kind of what we did,

44
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.359
what we're gonna now apply grid for
the layout instead of using Flexbox for

45
00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:48.937
our particular layout.

46
00:02:48.937 --> 00:02:53.337
Then you're gonna need to bring those
styles that you write in isolation for

47
00:02:53.337 --> 00:02:56.293
the mosaic portion 12A
part of this challenge and

48
00:02:56.293 --> 00:02:58.505
incorporate that into the home page.

49
00:02:58.505 --> 00:03:02.511
That to sort of raise the level
of look here in the homepage

50
00:03:02.511 --> 00:03:06.190
that we've been working
on throughout the course.
