00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.811
So now that you've had some time
to work with grid a little bit,

2
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:06.320
see a couple of things demonstrated here.

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.924
Now it's time to apply this to
the webpage that we were working on at

4
00:00:10.924 --> 00:00:13.154
a sort of as an isolation first.

5
00:00:13.154 --> 00:00:17.881
And then you're going to incorporate
it into the homepage of the website.

6
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:19.669
So let's start with 12 A,

7
00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.599
we're in chapter 12 now that's all of
the files are available up on GitHub.

8
00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.737
And if you take a look inside
of the website for the course,

9
00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:31.441
you'll see the instructions here for

10
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:35.520
this part of the course in what
you need to do and so forth.

11
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.766
So what we've got here first
is the mosaic grid, so

12
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:43.749
one of the popular things that people
are doing these days, is taking a bunch of

13
00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:49.058
images that are perhaps portrait and
orientation and landscape and orientation.

14
00:00:49.058 --> 00:00:53.787
And they're putting them together in
some kind of cool looking layout.

15
00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:58.520
And so we've done that here with
the pop art collection of images.

16
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.210
And this is what it should
look like here on desktop.

17
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.940
You see the layout of all
of these images here.

18
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.150
This is something that we wouldn't
be able to achieve with flexbox.

19
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.650
Before we were just put
a series of images on our rows.

20
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.910
Now we need to think about
this in two dimensions.

21
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.540
So this is how I'd like it
to look here on desktop.

22
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.010
It will actually work just
fine as well on tablet.

23
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.110
And then, when we go to a mobile layout,
this is the way then it's going to look.

24
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.500
We're gonna pile these
on top of each other.

25
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.532
So in this first exercise, what I'm gonna
need for you to do is to, first of all,

26
00:01:32.532 --> 00:01:37.268
of course, repeat what I just showed you,
take your fingers and your finger

27
00:01:37.268 --> 00:01:42.420
captions and get them to overlap each
other, write the code to do that.

28
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.410
And then what I'd like for you to do is to
write the grid layout here for desktop.

29
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.760
Get all of the images here looking great
in this one document in isolation.

30
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.160
And get it working on mobile.

31
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.860
So that will be step number one.

32
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.476
Once you have that in place, if you
still have a little bit of extra time,

33
00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:05.867
then I'd like you to go to
the homepage of the website,

34
00:02:05.867 --> 00:02:08.108
and I'd like you to drop in pop art.

35
00:02:08.108 --> 00:02:12.897
So we're gonna take out the collections
layout that we just had, everything

36
00:02:12.897 --> 00:02:17.847
row by row, and we're gonna drop in this
pop art layout in the web page instead.

37
00:02:17.847 --> 00:02:21.770
If you wanna keep the collections
part of the homepage and

38
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.194
just add on the pop art piece of this,
that's totally okay too.

39
00:02:26.194 --> 00:02:30.750
So when you put together your code for
the first part of this challenge the 12A

40
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.183
mosaic grid by itself, think about
the code that you used in this homepage.

41
00:02:35.183 --> 00:02:39.836
So you probably want to set this up as
a section, you probably want to set up

42
00:02:39.836 --> 00:02:44.639
the HTML accordingly to match kind of
what we did but we're going to now apply

43
00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:49.244
grid for the layout instead of using
flexbox for our particular layout.

44
00:02:49.244 --> 00:02:53.852
Then you're gonna need to bring those
styles that you write in isolation for

45
00:02:53.852 --> 00:02:57.020
the mosaic portion of 12A
part of this challenge,

46
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.772
and incorporate that into the homepage,
that to sort of raise the level of look

47
00:03:01.772 --> 00:03:06.175
here in the homepage that we've been
working on throughout the course.
