00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.790
What I'd like to do now is go through
the solution to the exercise that I

2
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.750
just gave you so I'm looking at the code
pen that's called to 2c-end and

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.950
I've talked through my solution here so
let me just scrunch up this window and

4
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.900
show you what I have
here in terms of code.

5
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.775
So I just wrapped a row around these five
figures you actually didn't need to add

6
00:00:22.775 --> 00:00:26.848
any additional classes to this or
anything but you do need to have of

7
00:00:26.848 --> 00:00:30.923
course the parents and
the children that containers in the items,

8
00:00:30.923 --> 00:00:36.135
you've got to have both of those things
together in order for Flexbox to work.

9
00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:39.935
So having five figures there
on the page is lovely.

10
00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:42.175
But that doesn't help you.

11
00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:43.005
With Flexbox.

12
00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:44.435
You've got to wrap something around it.

13
00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:46.435
So that's what we did with the HTML.

14
00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:53.880
And then here in the CSS well,
I'll start, start at the top.

15
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.550
So we're in our class
of row display of Flex,

16
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.000
flex flow row wrap,
justify content of space evenly.

17
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.320
That's so
that these boxes are spaced evenly.

18
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.370
Very nicely here across
the bottom just like that.

19
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.720
And I align the content in the center.

20
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.242
Okay, with a gap of 2%, and I put in the
minimum height of 100 VH viewport units,

21
00:01:19.242 --> 00:01:23.590
and that is so that when we
went to the desktop dimension,

22
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.970
we had that ability for
all those things to go down to the bottom.

23
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.990
And we had the room to work to stack
things on top of each other here.

24
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.290
At that tablet dimensions.

25
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.120
Okay, so then here at tablet dimensions
I just set my flex-basis to 32%.

26
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.859
About a third of the screen here for
everything and the gap of 2% and

27
00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:51.450
again, you can do the math
to figure that part out.

28
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.280
So then when you go into your media
queries you to ask yourself what changes.

29
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.008
So what changes as I move across from
small screen to big screen generally

30
00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:07.194
speaking, it could also be from
big screen to small screen, but

31
00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:10.992
what is changing and
those are the things we need to reset so

32
00:02:10.992 --> 00:02:16.470
we don't have to completely reset our
declarations over and over and over again.

33
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.049
So in other words I don't have to say
display flex again inside of my desktop

34
00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.330
media query.

35
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.387
I can just say this, I wanna change
my justify content from space

36
00:02:27.387 --> 00:02:32.817
evenly at my tablet media query,
I wanna change it to justify content

37
00:02:32.817 --> 00:02:39.184
of center when I get to the larger screen,
my align content which is center here,

38
00:02:39.184 --> 00:02:43.430
okay, that gives us this
cool center sort of effect.

39
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.810
I'm going to change that instead to
flex end at those larger dimensions.

40
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.440
So everything is stacking up
here at the bottom of my screen.

41
00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.120
In this particular case, everything packs
down here at the bottom and then the gap.

42
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.410
I read declared the gap.

43
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.610
I didn't actually have to do that,
but I read declared the gap of 2%.

44
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.030
And then I set up my figure width
here to be a flexspaces of 18.4%.

45
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.389
If you have a gap of 2% and you're working
with centered content here in order

46
00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:22.663
to space things all out do the math that
was the number that I came up with okay so

47
00:03:22.663 --> 00:03:26.337
you just type it in whatever
the number happens to be.

48
00:03:26.337 --> 00:03:31.035
So that's how you could get a crazy
thing like this to happen now one of

49
00:03:31.035 --> 00:03:35.814
the cool things about this particular
layout is this is a kind of layout

50
00:03:35.814 --> 00:03:38.733
that was just not possible inside of grid.

51
00:03:38.733 --> 00:03:43.581
So, the fact that we have these five
boxes and that they're centered here

52
00:03:43.581 --> 00:03:48.270
very nicely on the webpage especially
at tablet dimensions that's not

53
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.870
something that you can do with grid it
is something that is unique to Flexbox.

54
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.410
&gt;&gt; Could you use the calc
function within flex basis?

55
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.920
&gt;&gt; Sure, yes, absolutely.

56
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.120
You can use the calc function.

57
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.070
So I have a course here front end
masters called advanced CSS layouts.

58
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.030
And in that course I walk through a whole
lot of Calc and CSS variable stuff,

59
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.500
to to do all kinds of different,
wild and crazy things with page layouts.

60
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.248
You could absolutely use Calc and

61
00:04:17.248 --> 00:04:20.080
variables in anything that
I'm doing here today.

62
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.710
I've chosen not to use them in this
particular course because this is more

63
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.473
oriented towards beginning or beginners or

64
00:04:27.473 --> 00:04:31.870
people who are focusing maybe on HTML and
CSS for the first time.

65
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.377
I know a lot of you
are learning JavaScript first,

66
00:04:34.377 --> 00:04:37.970
and you're coming back and, and
learning HTML and CSS after the fact.

67
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.296
So to try to keep my examples as
straightforward and easy to read

68
00:04:41.296 --> 00:04:45.439
as possible I've kept Calc and variables
out of it but if you're interested in

69
00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:49.516
learning more about how you can do that
if you if you're not sure about how to do

70
00:04:49.516 --> 00:04:53.460
that you can watch my advanced CSS
layouts course here at Frontend Masters
