00:00:00.292 --> 00:00:03.976
Let's take a look at this Mondrian
painting example one more time.

2
00:00:03.976 --> 00:00:09.615
This time, what I'd like to do is
work on a different type of syntax,

3
00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:11.969
and show you how that works.

4
00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.583
So rather than going
through all of the details,

5
00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:18.424
cuz this is the same example that we
just coded in detail using numbers.

6
00:00:18.424 --> 00:00:23.101
I'd like to just sort of slide by all of
the niceties of background colors and

7
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:25.236
grid gaps and all the rest of that.

8
00:00:25.236 --> 00:00:29.301
Let's just slide right on into
looking at the new syntax for

9
00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:32.970
each one of the positions
of these particular cells.

10
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.211
I'd also like to talk about how
grid is going to anticipate

11
00:00:37.211 --> 00:00:40.079
the layout of this web page in advance.

12
00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.463
So you don't actually have to spell out
the position of each one of these cells

13
00:00:44.463 --> 00:00:48.584
individually with each one of these
declarations, the way we just did.

14
00:00:48.584 --> 00:00:50.897
So let's just take this one step further.

15
00:00:50.897 --> 00:00:54.385
Slightly different syntax,
specifying less code,

16
00:00:54.385 --> 00:00:59.041
which we always love less code, and
achieving the same type of layout.

17
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:03.616
So to get started with that
right here on the wrapper,

18
00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:09.017
let's start with display:: grid,
just like we had before.

19
00:01:09.017 --> 00:01:13.200
And we're going to have, of course,

20
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.301
our grid-template-rows of 170 pixels,

21
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:22.093
210 pixels, 61 pixels, and

22
00:01:22.093 --> 00:01:26.425
61 pixels, just like we had before.

23
00:01:26.425 --> 00:01:34.333
We're also gonna have our
grid-template-columns of 124 pixels,

24
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:40.826
376 pixels, and 42 pixels,
just like we had before.

25
00:01:40.826 --> 00:01:42.970
So by specifying these in advance,

26
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.550
you see already that grid is starting
to try to arrange things here in space.

27
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.989
So it knows that we have four rows, and
it knows that we have three columns.

28
00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:59.082
So what I'll do right out of the box is,
it'll just say, well, I've got seven

29
00:01:59.082 --> 00:02:04.043
different HTML elements that are my
children, all right, here in the HTML.

30
00:02:04.043 --> 00:02:09.164
If you take a look at all of those divs,
those are all of the children.

31
00:02:09.164 --> 00:02:13.850
So we can simply just start
putting one box per cell inside

32
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.059
of our grid-based layout,
which is really nice.

33
00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:22.097
And then of course to this,
we can add our gap.

34
00:02:22.097 --> 00:02:25.356
And that'll be 30 pixels, 20 pixels, and

35
00:02:25.356 --> 00:02:29.277
that'll give us the little
bit of space here in between.

36
00:02:29.277 --> 00:02:33.146
So as you see here, we start off with
this type of arrangement already.

37
00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:34.549
So as you can see right now,

38
00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.608
we don't even have to specify
where letter a is going to be.

39
00:02:37.608 --> 00:02:41.633
It's already in the right spot.

40
00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:45.520
So we could actually
start here with letter c.

41
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.655
And this new syntax is
going to look like this.

42
00:02:48.655 --> 00:02:57.203
This is going to be
grid-row of 1 / span 2.

43
00:02:57.203 --> 00:02:59.083
So that's the way this syntax works.

44
00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:03.778
So rather than before, when we said
start at 1 and go to number 3, and

45
00:03:03.778 --> 00:03:07.600
we've specified very
specifically which one of those,

46
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.638
we're gonna say start at 1 and
go across 2.

47
00:03:10.638 --> 00:03:14.290
So it's sort of more of a relative
type of layout type of thing.

48
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.487
And so c will do that for us.

49
00:03:17.487 --> 00:03:26.041
And of course, we need to add
to this grid-column of 2 / 2.

50
00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:29.595
So start at 2 and go across two columns.

51
00:03:29.595 --> 00:03:34.075
And so that just will just show up
there on the page exactly like that.

52
00:03:34.075 --> 00:03:37.188
So a and
b now are already in the right places.

53
00:03:37.188 --> 00:03:40.403
We don't need to go through and

54
00:03:40.403 --> 00:03:44.986
spell them out exactly, their locations.

55
00:03:44.986 --> 00:03:50.936
Likewise, when we get on down
here to something like letter d,

56
00:03:50.936 --> 00:03:57.582
okay, we've got d kind of in the right
place, it's not tall enough.

57
00:03:57.582 --> 00:04:01.161
e's not tall enough, and
g needs to come over here to the side.

58
00:04:01.161 --> 00:04:07.145
So here for letter d,
if we say our grid-row,

59
00:04:07.145 --> 00:04:13.290
we could simply say this,
span 2, all right?

60
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.392
So this is a second type of syntax,
and let's just compare and contrast.

61
00:04:17.392 --> 00:04:21.744
So here with letter c,
we said start at line number 1 and span 2.

62
00:04:21.744 --> 00:04:26.777
So just figure out what the next two
lines are and end at the second one.

63
00:04:26.777 --> 00:04:32.553
Here, for letter d, I've said,
go across two lines.

64
00:04:32.553 --> 00:04:35.958
So there's no exact starting point,
just span across two lines.

65
00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.787
Just figure out what they are and
make it happen.

66
00:04:38.787 --> 00:04:41.711
And so that's what it's done here.

67
00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:45.138
So that's a second way of
writing this type of syntax.

68
00:04:45.138 --> 00:04:49.855
It's more relative, and
we're gonna see that that becomes really

69
00:04:49.855 --> 00:04:54.831
helpful when we start working on
a grid system, an actual grid system.

70
00:04:54.831 --> 00:04:58.432
And then, so for letter e,

71
00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:02.974
we can do something similar here,

72
00:05:02.974 --> 00:05:06.742
a grid-row span 2, okay?

73
00:05:06.742 --> 00:05:09.947
So that sort of puts
things in the right place.

74
00:05:09.947 --> 00:05:14.850
And now, all we need to do in order
to achieve the rest of our layout is

75
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.907
to put in our background colors,
take out the opacity.

76
00:05:18.907 --> 00:05:23.503
And we pretty much got our painting
done here in a lot less code,

77
00:05:23.503 --> 00:05:28.120
just by specifying a few of these
particular items on the page.
