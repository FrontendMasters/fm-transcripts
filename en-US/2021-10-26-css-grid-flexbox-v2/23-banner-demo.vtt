WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.227
We're gonna write two additional pieces
of code for that homepage that we've

2
00:00:05.227 --> 00:00:10.030
been building where we've the now
the header with the navigation bar in it.

3
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.370
We have the mission we have
the collections, we have the footer.

4
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.630
Now we're going to add to
that two more elements.

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.834
We're gonna add a hero banner
across the top of the page, and

6
00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:25.276
we're going to add a featured poster or
something that is a very large image and

7
00:00:25.276 --> 00:00:29.172
so let's walk through how we
might go about doing that.

8
00:00:29.172 --> 00:00:33.876
Given that we've seen the performance
of this banner across our

9
00:00:33.876 --> 00:00:36.920
various browser's and so forth.

10
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.794
I'm going to write some code to
set this up as a picture for

11
00:00:40.794 --> 00:00:44.340
this hero banner at
the top of the webpage.

12
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.520
And then for that featured image,
we're gonna use source set and sizes.

13
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.587
And we'll get started with that
using the responsive image

14
00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:58.395
breakpoints generator which is
that responsive breakpoints.com.

15
00:00:58.395 --> 00:01:04.098
So free resource, and as you'll see here
on the screen, you can upload a file,

16
00:01:04.098 --> 00:01:09.650
and then you can set what resolution you
want for that particular file image?

17
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.760
And how many sizes?

18
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.720
And how many final images
you want generated?

19
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.320
Because you can get into the ridiculous
very easily with this as we've seen,

20
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.231
so where I'm going to do first is
I'm going to set my resolution from

21
00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:29.592
let's say 300 is probably good when
you actually type the numbers in.

22
00:01:29.592 --> 00:01:33.721
300 to let's say 1200,
resolution because we

23
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:38.578
have a max with a resolution on
there of 1200 on our webpage.

24
00:01:38.578 --> 00:01:42.430
300 is probably about as small
as a mobile device will need.

25
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.366
We can do a sidestep here
let's just say 25 or so

26
00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:51.070
k per image you can make that
smaller if you want and then for

27
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.616
the maximum number of images let's just
do three we don't need to go crazy here.

28
00:01:57.616 --> 00:02:02.786
So just give me three final images
then we can choose our image and

29
00:02:02.786 --> 00:02:06.970
which is gonna select
bind from my desktop.

30
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.100
It's in folder number six,
chapter six, the responsive images.

31
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.131
And if you take a look right
there in that chapter six folder,

32
00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:19.140
you'll see an image here
called too-cool.jpg.

33
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.049
And that's the one we wanna go ahead and
say open it will upload and

34
00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.437
then it will spit out here
here's the image that I gave it.

35
00:02:28.437 --> 00:02:31.937
And here is the bit of
code that it wrote for

36
00:02:31.937 --> 00:02:36.437
me it generated three images
have different sizes and

37
00:02:36.437 --> 00:02:42.251
it has also given me down here
the responsive design code that I need.

38
00:02:42.251 --> 00:02:47.246
So remember that of course those
file names we could change and

39
00:02:47.246 --> 00:02:51.100
you need to be aware of
the path to those images.

40
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.693
Because that may not be the path for
your particular webpage, but

41
00:02:54.693 --> 00:02:57.860
it has very nicely written
out exactly the sizes piece.

42
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.860
It wrote out the source set piece for
you, and so forth.

43
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.688
It also writes out the way this
might look with a picture tag,

44
00:03:05.688 --> 00:03:08.610
leveraging sizes and source set.

45
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.560
I'm less impressed with that
particular a little bit of code.

46
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.413
So I'm gonna write my own picture
code in just a moment for

47
00:03:16.413 --> 00:03:18.810
the other image that we're going to do.

48
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.690
So this little bit of HTML here,
you can copy that.

49
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.350
You can also download
the images right here.

50
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.470
Here's the button, download images.

51
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.647
And when you click that,

52
00:03:30.647 --> 00:03:34.120
it'll just download a zip file
with all the images in it.

53
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.849
And I already of course have
already put that in the folder for

54
00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.200
you in the distribution of the files.

55
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.037
So let's just take a look back then here
we are in folder number six the responsive

56
00:03:48.037 --> 00:03:54.450
images, we can look in the begin folder
and look in the image folder here.

57
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.670
Make sure nope I don't have those images.

58
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.416
I have them in the end folder.

59
00:04:00.416 --> 00:04:05.046
Yeah okay, I'm just gonna copy
these images from my end folder,

60
00:04:05.046 --> 00:04:08.505
drop them into my beginning
images folder here.

61
00:04:14.484 --> 00:04:19.080
There's three hero images
in addition to cool images.

62
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:28.487
Okay, and
now I'm going to open up index.html.

63
00:04:28.487 --> 00:04:29.980
And then I'm going to scroll down here.

64
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.594
So just after the opening header for
this web page,

65
00:04:33.594 --> 00:04:40.260
just before the start of mission, so we're
around line 27 to 28 inside of the HTML.

66
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.943
This is where we're gonna
to put our hero image.

67
00:04:45.943 --> 00:04:49.280
Hero image goes here.

68
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.777
And then if you keep on
scrolling past the collection,

69
00:04:52.777 --> 00:04:56.654
actually before the collections
just after the mission, so

70
00:04:56.654 --> 00:05:01.686
around line 37, 38 that's where we're
going to put the two cool images.

71
00:05:05.117 --> 00:05:08.310
So here let's just go ahead and
put in the code.

72
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.270
We're going to start with another section.

73
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.613
And this one will have an idea featured.

74
00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.893
And inside of this of course, we're going
to put in our h2 with a featured print.

75
00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:34.251
Okay, and then after that,
where I am decided I'm gonna keep using my

76
00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:38.510
figure notation here,
even though there's just one picture.

77
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.540
Let's just keep using
setting this up as a figure.

78
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:49.100
So you can actually just sort of copy
existing figure bit of HTML here.

79
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.012
It's all the same.

80
00:05:53.618 --> 00:05:56.331
But here oops,

81
00:06:01.455 --> 00:06:05.000
Here we're gonna make a few
modifications to that HTML.

82
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.915
So here for image source.

83
00:06:17.814 --> 00:06:19.330
Let's just change all of this.

84
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.570
So you can copy and paste in the code
that you had from that website.

85
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.330
My code is slightly different here,
so I'm just gonna type this in.

86
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.290
So this is image sizes.

87
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.508
Equals and a min width

88
00:06:36.508 --> 00:06:40.876
of 300 pixels.

89
00:06:40.876 --> 00:06:46.048
Display it at 33.3
viewport widths otherwise

90
00:06:46.048 --> 00:06:51.844
display it on 100,
viewport widths and then SORSA.

91
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.950
Equals, and
then there is a whole bunch of these.

92
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.921
So, image, actually a four
here in my example, too cool.

93
00:07:06.863 --> 00:07:08.030
Where is that now I'm not finding it.

94
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:27.871
300 wide image to cool yep.

95
00:07:30.058 --> 00:07:33.231
&gt;&gt; Is there a platform agnostic API for

96
00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:38.742
auto generating these image
sizes that you could recommend?

97
00:07:38.742 --> 00:07:44.148
&gt;&gt; Not off the top of my head, but that
wouldn't surprise me if there was one.

98
00:07:44.148 --> 00:07:47.632
&gt;&gt; I believe I've heard a lot
of people use Cloudinary.

99
00:07:47.632 --> 00:07:49.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Okay, Cloudinary.

100
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.423
Yeah, and in fact, they sponsor responsive
breakpoints, so that would be a good one.

101
00:08:11.575 --> 00:08:16.982
1058 and finally image,

102
00:08:16.982 --> 00:08:22.174
too-cool 1200.jpg,

103
00:08:22.174 --> 00:08:25.208
1200 wide.

104
00:08:28.246 --> 00:08:34.630
And then the source will
be img/too-cool-1200.

105
00:08:37.565 --> 00:08:40.170
And then we can put in an alt tag.

106
00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:45.071
Remember that your alt tags should
be descriptive of what people

107
00:08:45.071 --> 00:08:49.720
would not get from that image
if they were unable to see it.

108
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.046
So in other words,
if we just said featured print,

109
00:08:52.046 --> 00:08:55.630
we're not telling a screen reader
anything that they wouldn't already see.

110
00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:00.369
So a better description
here would be something

111
00:09:00.369 --> 00:09:04.160
like close up of woman in sunglasses,

112
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.670
showing eyes, nose and fingers over mouth.

113
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:14.296
So that is something that you would not
get from that image if you were not able

114
00:09:14.296 --> 00:09:16.790
to see it so
that is a better alt description.

115
00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.057
And then they did the name of
this is too cool for school

116
00:09:27.729 --> 00:09:32.248
So, that's what our figure might
wind up looking like I'm gonna

117
00:09:32.248 --> 00:09:36.531
switch this from color seven to
color six up here on line 40.

118
00:09:36.531 --> 00:09:40.010
So that we have a different color banner
around it that looks really nice.

119
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:45.810
And if you save that in theory when we
put it in the browser there we go so

120
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:52.715
there's our featured print and it's too
cool for school these are not numbered.

121
00:09:52.715 --> 00:09:56.937
So as you shrink the window down you
will not know if it's switched to

122
00:09:56.937 --> 00:10:00.806
different pictures, but
you'll notice that along the way.

123
00:10:00.806 --> 00:10:05.934
We have some other issues that pop
up here that are coming from other

124
00:10:05.934 --> 00:10:11.350
styles that we've set up here in
the style sheet that earlier we said.

125
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:16.304
When you got down to a smaller dimension
like this, we had that object position

126
00:10:16.304 --> 00:10:21.240
property and we set it to -150 to
show more of the bottom of the image.

127
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.510
We don't need that here for
this peach featured print.

128
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.460
So that's a little piece of
CSS that we need to adjust.

129
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.820
Probably for mobile devices, but
otherwise it looks pretty good.

130
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:36.832
Okay, we may want to fiddle around
with Too Cool for School here as well,

131
00:10:36.832 --> 00:10:40.480
maybe we want a little taller or
something.

132
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.083
It's part of the process.

133
00:10:42.083 --> 00:10:44.830
How much of that picture we're going
to wind up showing here on the page.
