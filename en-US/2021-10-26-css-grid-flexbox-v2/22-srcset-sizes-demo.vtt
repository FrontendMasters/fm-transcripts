00:00:00.086 --> 00:00:04.479
We are going to use a website called
responsive breakpoints that is

2
00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:08.882
gonna help us make a whole bunch of
images for source set and sizes.

3
00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:11.607
And it will write us some
code to go with that.

4
00:00:11.607 --> 00:00:16.116
And I want to demonstrate what I
mean by the browser's going to

5
00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.295
make the choice of the image.

6
00:00:18.295 --> 00:00:22.035
And so inside of your chapter 6,
GitHub files,

7
00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:24.965
there is a folder called Banner demo.

8
00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:28.458
When, if you take a look inside of it,
you'll find banners dot HTML.

9
00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:31.696
And you'll also see that I have
a folder here called banners.

10
00:00:31.696 --> 00:00:33.230
So inside of banners,

11
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.899
there are six different versions of the
same Banner at different dimensions here.

12
00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.815
And then there's an HTML file.

13
00:00:40.815 --> 00:00:44.851
The HTML file is super simple and
there is no CSS at all.

14
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:50.454
All the HTML does is,
it has the single image element in it.

15
00:00:50.454 --> 00:00:55.557
And inside of that you see here
we have sizes here on line 12.

16
00:00:55.557 --> 00:01:00.926
It says for a max width of 1200 pixels
display at 100 viewport widths,

17
00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:03.907
otherwise display it at 1200 pixels.

18
00:01:03.907 --> 00:01:06.927
In other words,
just display it full width all the time.

19
00:01:06.927 --> 00:01:11.842
And then source set here has given
you the conditions under which we

20
00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:15.462
have different images
that are available here.

21
00:01:15.462 --> 00:01:19.275
And then of course we have
the default version of this banner.

22
00:01:19.275 --> 00:01:24.375
And so this particular code came from
the responsive breakpoints website.

23
00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:27.207
Which I'm gonna go through
with you in just a moment.

24
00:01:27.207 --> 00:01:31.732
But then what I did was once I got
my banners back I opened up an image

25
00:01:31.732 --> 00:01:33.062
editing program.

26
00:01:33.062 --> 00:01:37.289
And I wrote the dimension of the banner
on each one of these images so

27
00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.263
we could see how they changed.

28
00:01:39.263 --> 00:01:43.848
So when to display this inside of Chrome.

29
00:01:43.848 --> 00:01:49.915
This is Chrome and as you see here I've
got the browser window maximized and

30
00:01:49.915 --> 00:01:55.706
this is at 1200 is the banner exactly
probably as you would expect.

31
00:01:55.706 --> 00:01:58.756
And so
as I start to make the screen smaller,

32
00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:02.225
you'd expect that somewhere
along the way here.

33
00:02:02.225 --> 00:02:06.177
We're gonna swap out the banner,
right at least once if not more than that.

34
00:02:06.177 --> 00:02:07.389
But look at this.

35
00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:11.100
It's just staying at 1200 the entire time.

36
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.172
No matter how small we get down,
it's still trying to load 1200.

37
00:02:15.172 --> 00:02:17.998
And when I first saw this,
I thought, no, what did I do wrong?

38
00:02:17.998 --> 00:02:21.012
I broke my code and everything else.

39
00:02:21.012 --> 00:02:26.467
But then I took a look at
this inside of Firefox.

40
00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:29.705
Same exact web page now
just displayed in Firefox.

41
00:02:29.705 --> 00:02:34.708
And you'll notice here that as I
reduce the size of this web browser,

42
00:02:34.708 --> 00:02:37.742
we do switch to a different size picture.

43
00:02:37.742 --> 00:02:44.326
So here, we're at 533 pixels wide,
we're switching to the 1084 image.

44
00:02:44.326 --> 00:02:47.720
And then when I think about it,
that may actually make sense.

45
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.167
I am working on a Mac-book Pro
that has retina on it.

46
00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:56.278
So it looks like just judging
from the numbers here.

47
00:02:56.278 --> 00:03:00.961
It's choosing the images based on
the fact that this is 2x pixel density.

48
00:03:00.961 --> 00:03:04.172
Something I didn't even account for
inside of my code.

49
00:03:04.172 --> 00:03:06.704
But remember the browser's
making the choice here and

50
00:03:06.704 --> 00:03:08.913
this is one of the things
it's thinking about.

51
00:03:08.913 --> 00:03:13.763
So then as I get smaller then I go to
958 at about roughly half that value.

52
00:03:13.763 --> 00:03:19.253
And I can't go any smaller here inside
of just looking at Firefox this way.

53
00:03:19.253 --> 00:03:22.655
If you put it in browser tools you can
continue to make the window smaller.

54
00:03:22.655 --> 00:03:27.246
And you can find it will continue to
load different versions of the picture.

55
00:03:27.246 --> 00:03:30.902
So this is the point I'm
trying to make to you.

56
00:03:30.902 --> 00:03:35.627
It depends it really depends you write
this code and you have no control

57
00:03:35.627 --> 00:03:40.610
over which image is going to get
displayed inside of your browser window.

58
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.600
And you're going to trust the browser
to make the right choice I even

59
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.705
tried putting the stuff up online.

60
00:03:46.705 --> 00:03:50.890
Thinking maybe if it was on a server it
would behave a little bit differently like

61
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.211
on a real actual server.

62
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:58.710
And that nothing dead did not change the
performance of either Firefox or Chrome.

63
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.574
Feel free to test with Safari or

64
00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:03.878
edge my results was Safari
were the same as Chrome's.

65
00:04:03.878 --> 00:04:05.524
Probably because they're both WebKit.

66
00:04:05.524 --> 00:04:08.686
But maybe edge would do something
different I just don't have edge here on

67
00:04:08.686 --> 00:04:09.299
my computer.
