1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.110
So this is the first challenge for
the collections.

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.150
This is what the screen should look like
on a desktop by the time you're done.

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.988
Notice that we have a series of
images here there are two rows with

4
00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:16.770
three columns each have different
color borders associated with them.

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.117
Notice that we have
the figure caption here,

6
00:00:19.117 --> 00:00:23.010
overlapping the image just like
we did in the previous code pen.

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.420
So, that is what should
look like there at desktop.

8
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.060
When we go to tablet it's going to be two
images across and when we go to mobile

9
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.901
it's going to be a series of images in
a column, so go ahead and give that a try.

10
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:47.150
Hope you did okay on the collections?

11
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.560
Let's go through exactly how these
are going to work how I coded them.

12
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.630
As always, there's lots of different
ways to approach these problems.

13
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.145
So you may have come up with
something slightly different, but

14
00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:01.580
I'll tell you about how I
addressed this particular problem.

15
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.930
So if we take a look at our HTML here,
what I've done is the following.

16
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.960
I've set this up first of all inside
of a section rather than using a div.

17
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.490
I've set this up as a section.

18
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.504
The reason why is because this is a
section of the webpage that happens to be

19
00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:18.720
talking about collections.

20
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.010
You could have used a div tag here
if you wanted, it's less meaningful.

21
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.184
I understand that the accessibility
of section is kind of hit or

22
00:01:27.184 --> 00:01:32.070
miss in terms of whether a screen
readers actually understand the section

23
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.460
element but I decided to use it anyway.

24
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.654
Anytime you have a section
you need a heading so

25
00:01:37.654 --> 00:01:41.309
there it is h2 my assumption is of course
that somewhere on the page there will

26
00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:43.800
eventually be an h1 which
is why I started with h2.

27
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.820
And then this is a list of pictures so
this is marked up as a list.

28
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.620
Inside of each list item is our Figure,
and these are more or

29
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.116
less marked up the way you've seen
in several examples prior to this.

30
00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:59.706
So there's a figure tag
there's an image and

31
00:01:59.706 --> 00:02:04.560
then there's a figure caption inside of
each of these, I wound up assigning class.

32
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.114
So as to each one of these figures, and
that class is numbered color seven,

33
00:02:10.114 --> 00:02:15.336
color two and so forth that's actually
going to match back to our CSS.

34
00:02:15.336 --> 00:02:20.304
So that is the HTML
markup that I used here.

35
00:02:20.304 --> 00:02:22.700
On the CSS side, let's go through that.

36
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.673
So I started off giving you the series
of colors that are here inside of

37
00:02:27.673 --> 00:02:31.276
this example for
the page that we're building and

38
00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:34.480
the designer gave me ten different colors.

39
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.548
So I just set them all up numbered one to
ten and in there are all of the values.

40
00:02:40.548 --> 00:02:45.777
You could if you know how to use CSS
custom properties or variables as they're

41
00:02:45.777 --> 00:02:50.774
often called you can absolutely call
on these colors inside of your code.

42
00:02:50.774 --> 00:02:54.887
If you're not familiar with that
code just take the hex codes and

43
00:02:54.887 --> 00:02:58.554
drop them into your CSS and
that will work just fine also.

44
00:02:58.554 --> 00:03:02.837
As I mentioned earlier I have not made
extensive use of variables inside of

45
00:03:02.837 --> 00:03:07.397
this course again because this is more
targeted towards beginners who are just

46
00:03:07.397 --> 00:03:08.314
starting out.

47
00:03:08.314 --> 00:03:11.685
And I'm trying to keep this as
straightforward as possible but

48
00:03:11.685 --> 00:03:15.636
clearly you could do more with variables
in the work that I've done here.

49
00:03:15.636 --> 00:03:19.980
All right, so
then we have our basic border box styling,

50
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.954
we have some basic styling here for our
body setting up our background color and

51
00:03:25.954 --> 00:03:29.683
our font and
turning off the padding and margin.

52
00:03:29.683 --> 00:03:34.041
And I set a max width are sections
such that we won't go wider than

53
00:03:34.041 --> 00:03:38.887
1200 pixels just so the screen
doesn't get ridiculously large and

54
00:03:38.887 --> 00:03:44.400
set up some margin and some padding
on that as well as the font size.

55
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.940
Now we're going into our new styles.

56
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.147
So, all as always the first step
anytime you're using markup like this

57
00:03:52.147 --> 00:03:54.540
is to turn off the bullets.

58
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.632
It is set up as a list because that is
semantically what this is just a list of

59
00:03:58.632 --> 00:03:59.160
images.

60
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.780
And of course those come with bullets.

61
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.063
So we turn those off.

62
00:04:05.795 --> 00:04:10.400
Then as I say here to keep the mobile
screens from being stupid long

63
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.438
consider setting a max height on
the images and then hide the overflow.

64
00:04:15.438 --> 00:04:19.998
Cuz otherwise you might wind up with
images that may take up even more than

65
00:04:19.998 --> 00:04:21.433
one screen on a phone.

66
00:04:21.433 --> 00:04:24.934
So you might really Indeed
want to set a max width and

67
00:04:24.934 --> 00:04:29.183
then just hide that overflow,
which is what I've done here.

68
00:04:29.183 --> 00:04:34.059
We've got a bit of margin on these
to put a bit of separation on them.

69
00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:38.899
And I set up a tiny little bit of
a border radius and then notice that I

70
00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:43.890
spelled out individually my
border width and my border style.

71
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.887
Normally we see this as like border one
pixel solid red here I've spelled it out

72
00:04:48.887 --> 00:04:53.885
in two separate declarations because
that border color I have associated with

73
00:04:53.885 --> 00:04:55.491
those classes later on.

74
00:04:55.491 --> 00:05:00.961
So by default my finger will come with a
border with it has a width and a style but

75
00:05:00.961 --> 00:05:05.920
it does not have a color and
the color will be added on later, okay.

76
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.658
In between the figure and

77
00:05:07.658 --> 00:05:12.510
the caption I think there's this
tiny little space that shows up.

78
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.066
We saw it in a previous example here I've
just used a margin bottom of a negative

79
00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:18.939
four pixels to tighten that up.

80
00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:22.577
And I've set this up to have
the object fit property

81
00:05:22.577 --> 00:05:25.040
in the object position property.

82
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.652
This has to do with how the images
are displaying inside of the webpage here.

83
00:05:30.652 --> 00:05:33.960
When you set your max
height on those pictures,

84
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.310
they'll just take the top
400 pixels of the picture.

85
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.750
Sometimes the interesting parts of
the picture are down towards the bottom.

86
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.298
So what this is doing is it's pushing up
the visible portion of the picture so

87
00:05:46.298 --> 00:05:48.582
that we can see it a little bit better.

88
00:05:48.582 --> 00:05:52.130
And we're cropping off parts that
are less interesting by default.

89
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.201
We also have styling here for our figure
caption I talked to you previously about

90
00:05:57.201 --> 00:05:59.110
relative and absolute positioning.

91
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.410
And so we've done something
very similar here with that and

92
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.740
we've set a background color with a bit of
transparency to it yes we have a question.

93
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.010
&gt;&gt; Why do we need position relative here?

94
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.930
&gt;&gt; Why do we need position relative here?

95
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.434
Here we have not used flexbox to lay out
the inside of this particular figure,

96
00:06:16.434 --> 00:06:21.080
we've just using absolute and relative
positioning in this particular case,

97
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.909
so that's why we need it here.

98
00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:25.451
Then we have our figure caption a,

99
00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:29.520
we wanna have a big clickable
area with display block.

100
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:35.800
Okay, remember that by default your links
are an inline type of configuration.

101
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.480
They're only as wide as their content,
they're really as wide as their text.

102
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.307
And so people can easily
miss that clickable area,

103
00:06:43.307 --> 00:06:47.943
make it really big,
set it to display block, give it a color.

104
00:06:47.943 --> 00:06:52.413
And that will give us a great big huge
target area very helpful on phones in

105
00:06:52.413 --> 00:06:55.140
particular can't hurt on desktop, okay.

106
00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.635
Then I set up a whole bunch of
these styles which have a really,

107
00:07:00.635 --> 00:07:04.515
weird combination of both border color and
text color.

108
00:07:04.515 --> 00:07:09.675
These are two set up the colors inside
of our borders on the figure as well

109
00:07:09.675 --> 00:07:14.663
as some of the colors inside of the text
that inside of that document so

110
00:07:14.663 --> 00:07:16.645
that is what all of this is.

111
00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:21.696
We're just calling on the colors as
configured earlier in the document so

112
00:07:21.696 --> 00:07:26.103
there's a whole bunch of those
then we get to our media queries.

113
00:07:26.103 --> 00:07:31.028
Here is the first place that we turn
on our media query at 550 pixels and

114
00:07:31.028 --> 00:07:35.012
have talked you through this
several times display flex.

115
00:07:35.012 --> 00:07:40.763
Flex flows row wrap justify content is
space between so my favorite configuration

116
00:07:40.763 --> 00:07:45.945
right there and then we'll set each
li to have a flex basis of 49.5%.

117
00:07:45.945 --> 00:07:50.444
I didn't make use of the gap property here
you absolutely could have used the gap

118
00:07:50.444 --> 00:07:51.864
property if you wanted.

119
00:07:51.864 --> 00:07:56.342
But by virtue of having two
elements next to each other,

120
00:07:56.342 --> 00:08:01.404
they just 49.5% add them together,
you get like 99%.

121
00:08:01.404 --> 00:08:06.400
So you'll get a 1% gap by default
in between those two items.

122
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.840
And then I turn off the Object Positioning
once we get to the larger screens.

123
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.580
Otherwise, what you'll see is half of
the image, and half of it will be cut off,

124
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.070
you'll just have blank space.

125
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:20.550
So we have to turn that off here to pull
everything down a little bit further.

126
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.036
And then finally here,
for my last media queries,

127
00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:27.441
I'm just turning on a little
bit of an indent, and

128
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:32.167
setting up a one-third size for
our flex basis property for that li.

129
00:08:32.167 --> 00:08:36.472
So let's take a quick look at
the webpage and see how it looks.

130
00:08:36.472 --> 00:08:42.097
So here's our web page hopefully
yours looks pretty much like this and

131
00:08:42.097 --> 00:08:46.303
we'll scrunch it down so
you can see how it changes.

132
00:08:46.303 --> 00:08:51.302
One of the things you wanna be mindful of
when you're working with images like this

133
00:08:51.302 --> 00:08:53.547
is how much of the image is showing and

134
00:08:53.547 --> 00:08:57.110
so that's where that object
position property comes in.

135
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.390
These still look pretty good.

136
00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.420
Then we go to our tablet dimension.

137
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.917
So you can see here for example,
this landscape image it may be

138
00:09:07.917 --> 00:09:11.429
worthwhile to tweak that a little
bit more maybe with a class.

139
00:09:11.429 --> 00:09:16.928
Because you the interesting part is the
mountains interacting with the moon here.

140
00:09:16.928 --> 00:09:21.271
And that is not really coming across
here at this particular dimension.

141
00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:25.967
So that might be something you wanted
to develop a little bit further and

142
00:09:25.967 --> 00:09:29.019
then we'll go to mobile and
you'll see here so

143
00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:33.971
that max with the 400 pixels which
obviously could be a smaller number.

144
00:09:33.971 --> 00:09:38.465
Now you see we get a sense of these
pictures that's not the full picture and

145
00:09:38.465 --> 00:09:43.560
because we push these up a little bit, we
get the interesting parts of the picture.

146
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.980
So this one here called vivid you'd see a
lot of sky without pushing the picture up

147
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:52.530
a little bit further or you'd see just the
neck of the guitar without seeing the main

148
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:53.653
body of the guitar.

149
00:09:54.882 --> 00:09:58.120
So, that's how that one
ends up turning out.

150
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.237
&gt;&gt; Jen, could you differentiate
between the min, width and

151
00:10:02.237 --> 00:10:04.320
max width in the case of media queries?

152
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.299
&gt;&gt; Yes.
So, when you are writing mobile first,

153
00:10:08.299 --> 00:10:12.940
what you want to do is use all min width
media queries the whole way through.

154
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.545
So, you start with your declarations
outside of the media queries,

155
00:10:16.545 --> 00:10:18.740
that's your mobile styles.

156
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:23.889
And then you're going to change whatever
needs changing through the media queries

157
00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:28.758
and you use min width because that pulls
in the styles outside the media query.

158
00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:33.802
Pulls those styles they're still valid
when you get into the next media query and

159
00:10:33.802 --> 00:10:37.212
they are still valid all
the way through the document,

160
00:10:37.212 --> 00:10:40.490
until you reset a value
somewhere along the way.

161
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.430
So that is min width.

162
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:47.030
Max width are what you would use
if you wanted to go desktop first.

163
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:51.707
In other words, all the styles
outside of it are desktop styles, and

164
00:10:51.707 --> 00:10:56.063
then we're going to cut off whatever
those styles are at various

165
00:10:56.063 --> 00:11:00.170
breakpoints by using max
width media queries.

166
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.664
Generally speaking today people write
mobile first for the most part, but

167
00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:09.658
sometimes desktop first may make sense you
may be starting from miss there's still

168
00:11:09.658 --> 00:11:12.529
a few websites around
that are not responsive.

169
00:11:12.529 --> 00:11:15.477
And so you might be rewriting
styles that already exist and

170
00:11:15.477 --> 00:11:17.583
you're tacking on the mobile part of it,

171
00:11:17.583 --> 00:11:20.613
that would be a situation where
you might go desktop first.

172
00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:24.989
Or maybe you just have
a complicated desktop,

173
00:11:24.989 --> 00:11:29.730
website and
it made more sense to go that way.

174
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.020
Or maybe that's where most of your
traffic is it's on your desktop site.

175
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.520
The mobile site is less important.

176
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.816
And so it makes sense to use
desktop first for that reason,.

177
00:11:38.816 --> 00:11:40.840
&gt;&gt; That was object position or object fit.

178
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:46.065
&gt;&gt; Object fit will determine how
the image is going to display

179
00:11:46.065 --> 00:11:50.654
within the space like cover or
contain or there's a scale down one.

180
00:11:50.654 --> 00:11:54.471
You can kind of play around with those
properties to see their impact but

181
00:11:54.471 --> 00:11:58.747
the object position moves things actually
up and down and side to side in space.

182
00:11:58.747 --> 00:12:01.714
So you may need to play around with
a combination of both of those to get

183
00:12:01.714 --> 00:12:02.750
the images to look right
