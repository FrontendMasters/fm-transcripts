1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.145
So this is the first challenge for
the collections.

2
00:00:04.145 --> 00:00:08.472
This is what the screen should look like
on a desktop by the time you're done

3
00:00:08.472 --> 00:00:11.024
notice that we have
a series of images here.

4
00:00:11.024 --> 00:00:15.994
There are two rows with three columns each
have different color borders associated

5
00:00:15.994 --> 00:00:16.706
with them.

6
00:00:16.706 --> 00:00:21.054
Notice that we have the figure caption
here overlapping the image just like

7
00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:22.928
we did in the previous code pen.

8
00:00:22.928 --> 00:00:26.405
So, that is what it should
look like there at desktop.

9
00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:30.273
When we go to tablet,
it's going to be two images across.

10
00:00:30.273 --> 00:00:35.387
And when we go to a mobile, it's going
to be a series of images in a column.

11
00:00:35.387 --> 00:00:37.923
So go ahead and give that a try.

12
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.106
Hope you did okay on the collections.

13
00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:52.536
Let's go through exactly how these
are going to work how I coded them.

14
00:00:52.536 --> 00:00:55.549
As always, there's lots of different
ways to approach these problems.

15
00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:58.573
So you may have come up with
something slightly different, but

16
00:00:58.573 --> 00:01:01.490
I'll tell you about how I
address this particular problem.

17
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.460
So if we take a look at our HTML here,
what I've done is the following I've

18
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.964
set this up first of all inside of
a section rather than using a div.

19
00:01:10.964 --> 00:01:12.487
I've set this up as a section.

20
00:01:12.487 --> 00:01:15.093
The reason why is because
this is a section of

21
00:01:15.093 --> 00:01:18.625
the webpage that happens to
be talking about collections.

22
00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:22.950
You could have used a div tag here
if you wanted, it's less meaningful.

23
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.276
I understand that the accessibility
of section is kind of hit or

24
00:01:27.276 --> 00:01:32.502
miss in terms of whether screen readers
actually understand the section for

25
00:01:32.502 --> 00:01:35.372
an element but I decided to use it anyway.

26
00:01:35.372 --> 00:01:37.764
Anytime you have a section
you need a heading so

27
00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:41.747
there it is h2 my assumption is of course
that somewhere on the page there will

28
00:01:41.747 --> 00:01:44.465
eventually be an h1 which
is why I started with h2.

29
00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:47.359
And then,
this is a list of pictures and so

30
00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:51.847
this is marked up as a list inside
of each list item is our figure.

31
00:01:51.847 --> 00:01:53.100
And these are more or

32
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.459
less marked up the way you've seen
in several examples prior to this.

33
00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.991
So there's a figure tag,
there's an image, and

34
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:02.838
then there's a figure caption
inside of each of these.

35
00:02:02.838 --> 00:02:07.011
I wound up assigning classes
to each one of these figures.

36
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:11.295
And that class is numbered color seven,
color two and so

37
00:02:11.295 --> 00:02:15.500
forth that's actually going
to match back to our CSS.

38
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.838
So that is the HTML markup that
I used here on the CSS side.

39
00:02:21.838 --> 00:02:22.706
Let's go through that.

40
00:02:22.706 --> 00:02:27.636
So I started off giving you The series
of colors that are here inside of

41
00:02:27.636 --> 00:02:31.129
this example for
the page that we're building.

42
00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:36.684
And the designer gave me ten different
colors, so I just set them all up,

43
00:02:36.684 --> 00:02:40.799
numbered one to ten, and
there are all of the values.

44
00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.201
You could, if you know how to use CSS,
custom properties or variables, as they're

45
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:51.088
often called, you can absolutely call
on these colors inside of your code.

46
00:02:51.088 --> 00:02:55.252
If you're not familiar with that code,
just take that codes and

47
00:02:55.252 --> 00:02:58.541
drop them into your CSS and
that will work just fine also.

48
00:02:58.541 --> 00:03:02.940
As I mentioned earlier, I have not made
extensive use of variables inside of this

49
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.081
course again, because this is more
targeted towards beginners who are just

50
00:03:07.081 --> 00:03:11.174
starting out and I'm trying to keep
this as straightforward as possible.

51
00:03:11.174 --> 00:03:15.785
But clearly you can do more with
variables in the work that I'm done here.

52
00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:20.030
All right, so then we have our,

53
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.807
basic quarter box styling,

54
00:03:23.807 --> 00:03:29.955
we have some basic body
sitting up our margin.

55
00:03:29.955 --> 00:03:35.985
And I said on our sections such that We
won't go wider than 1200 pixels just so

56
00:03:35.985 --> 00:03:39.533
the screen doesn't get
ridiculously large and

57
00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:44.337
set up some margin and some padding
on that as well as a font size.

58
00:03:44.337 --> 00:03:47.131
Now we're going into our new styles.

59
00:03:47.131 --> 00:03:52.030
So well as always the first step
anytime you're using markup like

60
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.443
this is to turn off the bullets.

61
00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:59.376
It is set up as a list because that is
semantically what this is just a list

62
00:03:59.376 --> 00:04:00.207
of images.

63
00:04:00.207 --> 00:04:03.162
And of course those come with bullets so
we turn those off.

64
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.877
Then as I say here, to keep the mobile
screens from being stupid long keep,

65
00:04:10.877 --> 00:04:15.566
consider setting a max height on
the images and then hide the overflow.

66
00:04:15.566 --> 00:04:18.950
Because otherwise you might
wind up with images that may

67
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.619
take up even more than
one screen on a phone.

68
00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:25.165
So you might really indeed
want to set a max width and

69
00:04:25.165 --> 00:04:29.302
then just hide that overflow
which is what I've done here.

70
00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:34.564
We've got a bit of margin on these to
put a bit of separation on them and,

71
00:04:34.564 --> 00:04:39.212
I set up a tiny little bit of a border
radius and then notice that I

72
00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:43.908
spelled out individually my
border width and my border style.

73
00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:47.435
Normally we see this is like
border one pixel solid red.

74
00:04:47.435 --> 00:04:52.027
Here I've spelled it out in two separate
declarations because that border color

75
00:04:52.027 --> 00:04:54.737
I've associated with
those classes later on.

76
00:04:54.737 --> 00:04:59.096
So by default my finger will come
with a border with a has a width and

77
00:04:59.096 --> 00:05:03.790
a style but it does not have a color and
the color will be added on later.

78
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.666
Okay in between the figure and
the caption,

79
00:05:07.666 --> 00:05:12.498
I think there's this tiny
little space that shows up.

80
00:05:12.498 --> 00:05:14.643
We saw it in a previous example here,

81
00:05:14.643 --> 00:05:19.017
I've just used margin bottom of a negative
four pixels to tighten that up.

82
00:05:19.017 --> 00:05:22.775
And I've set this up to have
the object fit property and

83
00:05:22.775 --> 00:05:24.989
the object position property.

84
00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:32.549
This has to do with how the images
are displaying inside of the webpage here.

85
00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:35.150
When you set your max
height on those pictures,

86
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.281
they'll just take the top
400 pixels of the picture.

87
00:05:38.281 --> 00:05:41.667
Sometimes the interesting parts of
the picture are down towards the bottom.

88
00:05:41.667 --> 00:05:46.353
So what this is doing is it's pushing up
the visible portion of the picture so

89
00:05:46.353 --> 00:05:48.713
that we can see it a little bit better.

90
00:05:48.713 --> 00:05:53.147
And we're cropping off parts that
are less interesting by default.

91
00:05:53.147 --> 00:05:55.406
We also have styling here for
our finger caption.

92
00:05:55.406 --> 00:05:59.096
I talked to you previously about
relative and absolute positioning.

93
00:05:59.096 --> 00:06:02.528
And so we've done something very
similar here with that, and

94
00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:06.034
we've set a background color with
a bit of transparency to it.

95
00:06:06.034 --> 00:06:07.197
Yes, we have a question.

96
00:06:07.197 --> 00:06:10.058
&gt;&gt; Why do we need position relative here?

97
00:06:10.058 --> 00:06:11.858
&gt;&gt; Why do we need position relative here.

98
00:06:11.858 --> 00:06:18.178
Here we have not used Flexbox to lay out
the inside of this particular figure.

99
00:06:18.178 --> 00:06:21.717
We've just using absolute and relative
positioning in this particular case, so

100
00:06:21.717 --> 00:06:22.957
that's why we need it here.

101
00:06:22.957 --> 00:06:25.430
Then we have our figure caption a,

102
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.881
we wanna have a big clickable
area with display block, okay?

103
00:06:29.881 --> 00:06:35.809
Remember that by default your links
are an inline type of configuration.

104
00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:39.438
They're only as wide as their content
their lives, why does their text.

105
00:06:39.438 --> 00:06:43.443
And so, people can easily
miss that clickable area,

106
00:06:43.443 --> 00:06:48.079
make it really big,
set it to display block, give it a color.

107
00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:52.577
And that will give us a great big huge
target area very helpful on phones in

108
00:06:52.577 --> 00:06:55.034
particular, can't hurt on desktop.

109
00:06:55.034 --> 00:06:58.906
Okay, then I set up a whole
bunch of these styles,

110
00:06:58.906 --> 00:07:04.734
which have a really Weird combination
of both border color and text color.

111
00:07:04.734 --> 00:07:09.305
These are to set up the colors
inside of our borders on the figure,

112
00:07:09.305 --> 00:07:14.649
as well as some of the colors inside of
the text that inside of that document.

113
00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:16.963
So that is what all of this is, and

114
00:07:16.963 --> 00:07:22.100
we're just calling on the colors as
configured earlier in the document.

115
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.767
So there's a whole bunch of those
Then we get to our media queries.

116
00:07:25.767 --> 00:07:30.851
Here is the first place that we turn
on our media query at 550 pixels.

117
00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:35.987
And I've talked you through this several
times display flex flex flows row wrap,

118
00:07:35.987 --> 00:07:40.842
justify content is space between so
my favorite configuration right there.

119
00:07:40.842 --> 00:07:45.995
And then we'll set each Li to
have a flex basis of 49.5%.

120
00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:48.809
I didn't make use of
the gap property here.

121
00:07:48.809 --> 00:07:53.609
You absolutely could have used
the gap property if you wanted, but

122
00:07:53.609 --> 00:07:56.779
by virtue of having two
elements next to each

123
00:07:56.779 --> 00:08:01.422
other Just 49.5% add them together,
you get like 99%.

124
00:08:01.422 --> 00:08:06.326
So you'll get a 1% gap by default
in between those two items.

125
00:08:06.326 --> 00:08:10.622
And then I turn off the object positioning
once we get to the larger screens.

126
00:08:10.622 --> 00:08:13.233
Otherwise what you'll see
is half of the image and

127
00:08:13.233 --> 00:08:16.169
half of it will be cut off
you'll just have blank space.

128
00:08:16.169 --> 00:08:20.474
So we have to turn that off here to pull
everything down a little bit further.

129
00:08:20.474 --> 00:08:24.634
And then finally here,
for my last media queries,

130
00:08:24.634 --> 00:08:28.503
I'm just turning on a little
bit of an indent and

131
00:08:28.503 --> 00:08:33.755
setting up a 1/3 size for
our flex basis property for that Li.

132
00:08:33.755 --> 00:08:37.354
So let's take a quick look at
the web page and see how it looks.

133
00:08:37.354 --> 00:08:39.419
So here's our web page.

134
00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.215
Hopefully yours looks
pretty much like this.

135
00:08:42.215 --> 00:08:46.794
And we'll scrunch it down so
you can see how it changes.

136
00:08:46.794 --> 00:08:51.269
One of the things you want to be
mindful of when you're working

137
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:55.656
with images like this Is how much
of the image is showing and so

138
00:08:55.656 --> 00:08:59.716
that's where that object
position property comes in.

139
00:08:59.716 --> 00:09:01.402
These still look pretty good.

140
00:09:01.402 --> 00:09:06.589
Then we go to our tablet dimension So you
can see here for example, this landscape

141
00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:11.644
image, it may be worthwhile to tweak that
a little bit more maybe with a class.

142
00:09:11.644 --> 00:09:16.288
Because you know the interesting part is
the is the mountains interacting with

143
00:09:16.288 --> 00:09:17.212
the moon here.

144
00:09:17.212 --> 00:09:21.526
And that is not really coming across
here at this particular dimension.

145
00:09:21.526 --> 00:09:25.930
So that might be something you wanted
to develop a little bit further.

146
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:27.963
And then we'll go to mobile.

147
00:09:27.963 --> 00:09:31.376
And you'll see here so
that max width of 400 pixels,

148
00:09:31.376 --> 00:09:34.073
which obviously could be a smaller number.

149
00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.889
Now you see we get a sense
of these pictures.

150
00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:43.748
Now you see we get a sense
of these pictures.

151
00:09:43.748 --> 00:09:45.810
So like this one here called vivid,

152
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:50.154
you'd see a lot of sky without pushing
the picture up a little bit further.

153
00:09:50.154 --> 00:09:53.405
Or you'd see just the neck
of the guitar without seeing

154
00:09:53.405 --> 00:09:55.107
the main body of the guitar.

155
00:09:55.107 --> 00:09:58.702
So that's how that one's up turning out.

156
00:09:58.702 --> 00:10:02.416
&gt;&gt; Jen, could you differentiate
between the min width and

157
00:10:02.416 --> 00:10:05.033
max width in the case of media queries?

158
00:10:05.033 --> 00:10:07.967
&gt;&gt; Yes, so
when you are writing mobile first,

159
00:10:07.967 --> 00:10:12.978
what you want to do is use all min width
media queries the whole way through.

160
00:10:12.978 --> 00:10:16.928
So you start with your declarations
outside of the media queries,

161
00:10:16.928 --> 00:10:18.701
that's your mobile styles.

162
00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:23.260
And then you're going to change whatever
needs changing through the media

163
00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.141
queries and you use min width,

164
00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:30.002
because that pulls in the Styles outside
the media query, holes those styles.

165
00:10:30.002 --> 00:10:33.645
They're still valid when you
get into the next media query.

166
00:10:33.645 --> 00:10:38.282
And they are still valid all the way
through the document until you reset

167
00:10:38.282 --> 00:10:40.455
a value somewhere along the way.

168
00:10:40.455 --> 00:10:43.137
So that is min width.

169
00:10:43.137 --> 00:10:47.160
Max width are what you would use
if you wanted to go desktop first.

170
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:52.012
In other words, all the styles
outside of it are desktop styles and

171
00:10:52.012 --> 00:10:56.085
then we're going to cut off
whatever those styles are at

172
00:10:56.085 --> 00:11:00.176
various break points by using
max width media queries.

173
00:11:00.176 --> 00:11:04.998
Generally speaking, today, people
write mobile first, for the most part,

174
00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:09.543
but sometimes, desktop first may make
sense, you may be starting from.

175
00:11:09.543 --> 00:11:12.870
Maybe there's still a few websites
around that are not responsive.

176
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:15.671
And so you might be rewriting
styles that already exist and

177
00:11:15.671 --> 00:11:17.683
you're tacking on the mobile part of it.

178
00:11:17.683 --> 00:11:20.806
That would be a situation where
you might go desktop first.

179
00:11:20.806 --> 00:11:26.482
Or maybe you just have
a complicated desktop website and

180
00:11:26.482 --> 00:11:29.871
it made more sense to go that way.

181
00:11:29.871 --> 00:11:33.653
Maybe that's where most of your
traffic is, it's on your desktop site,

182
00:11:33.653 --> 00:11:35.484
the mobile site is less important.

183
00:11:35.484 --> 00:11:38.864
And so it makes sense to use
desktop first for that reason,

184
00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:42.141
&gt;&gt; That was object position or object fit.

185
00:11:42.141 --> 00:11:46.584
&gt;&gt; Object fit will determine how
the image is going to display within

186
00:11:46.584 --> 00:11:50.722
the space like cover or contain or
there's a scale down one.

187
00:11:50.722 --> 00:11:54.382
You can kind of play around with those
properties to see their impact but

188
00:11:54.382 --> 00:11:58.662
the object position moves things actually
up and down, and side to side and space.

189
00:11:58.662 --> 00:12:02.760
Now you see we get a sense
of these pictures.
