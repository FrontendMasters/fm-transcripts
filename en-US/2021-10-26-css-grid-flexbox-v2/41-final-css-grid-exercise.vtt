00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.100
For the very last part of this course,

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.365
I have given you some raw materials and
some ideas for what you might do for

3
00:00:08.365 --> 00:00:13.475
laying out an inside page for
our website that we've been working on.

4
00:00:13.475 --> 00:00:16.670
And I'm leaving this very open-ended for
you.

5
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.296
So if you look back over the grid portion
of this unit, we've talked about cards,

6
00:00:21.296 --> 00:00:25.054
we've talked about magazine style layouts,
we've talked about

7
00:00:25.054 --> 00:00:29.080
interesting effects that we can
do with overlapping grid cells.

8
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.162
And we've talked about basic sorts
of layouts in terms of mosaics or,

9
00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:37.150
just a general grid based layout.

10
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.368
So any of those types of
techniques are on the table for

11
00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:44.197
laying out these inside web pages.

12
00:00:44.197 --> 00:00:48.299
What I've done here, is I've given
you a folder called raw materials,

13
00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:52.480
Inside of raw materials,
you're going to find a series of images.

14
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.770
So these are pictures of doughnuts and
they are very lovely.

15
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.256
They're all different portrait and
landscape,

16
00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:05.328
all kinds of mixed sort of images here and
some basic text.

17
00:01:05.328 --> 00:01:12.417
So there is a woman on pexels, she is a
professional photographer with pexels and

18
00:01:12.417 --> 00:01:19.250
some other various image agencies and
so I have gotten her, here she is.

19
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.591
Here's her profile,

20
00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:24.480
these are links to the photos that
I have pulled here from pexels.

21
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.760
You're welcome to go on pexels and go pull
some different images, if you prefer.

22
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.226
And I've given you,
let me wrap the text here,

23
00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:37.960
I've given you a little bit of
information about her as an artist.

24
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.705
And so you should think about how you
could go about laying this out as

25
00:01:42.705 --> 00:01:44.127
an inside webpage.

26
00:01:44.127 --> 00:01:50.022
Some things that I would suggest
that you think about along the way,

27
00:01:50.022 --> 00:01:55.401
so first of all I've given you
here is your beginning folder,

28
00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:59.229
this is listed of
the default browser here,

29
00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.180
this is your web page
as it currently exists.

30
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.380
This is the homepage of the website.

31
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.210
And I give this to you because maybe there
are elements from here that you want to

32
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.950
reuse on the inside page of the website.

33
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.334
So you can think about which some of these
elements you'd like to carry over to

34
00:02:17.334 --> 00:02:20.302
the inside page, hint,
hint, maybe the header and

35
00:02:20.302 --> 00:02:22.980
the footer might be a good idea.

36
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.180
But that's really up to you.

37
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.037
And so you can pull whatever
you think makes sense and

38
00:02:29.037 --> 00:02:31.810
set up some kind of inside pitch.

39
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.637
So, if you don't have any
ideas about what you want do,

40
00:02:36.637 --> 00:02:41.170
I have given you a goal if
that is helpful to you?

41
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.910
So I said, here's one idea for
the way this donut love page.

42
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.470
I call it Sharon Mccutcheon Donut Love.

43
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.620
And I set this up the following
way as a mosaic grid based layout.

44
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.962
Notice that the top square of this
layout has got some text on top of it,

45
00:02:59.962 --> 00:03:02.810
that little bit of text that I gave you.

46
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.000
This is one idea, you are more than
welcome to try out some other ideas.

47
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.470
So something with cards would
be a wonderful way to do this.

48
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.662
Something with a magazine type of layout
would be an interesting way to do this,

49
00:03:16.662 --> 00:03:20.612
or anything else that you can think of for
an inside page, and

50
00:03:20.612 --> 00:03:24.840
then on tablet mobile,
I have it set up to work this way.

51
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.240
Notice here I've got all the images
stacked on top of each other.

52
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.460
And I've got the text hanging out all by
itself here at the top of the screen.

53
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.848
So you might want to give some thought
about how I managed to do that magic if

54
00:03:36.848 --> 00:03:38.880
that's the route you want to take.

55
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.170
Or maybe you want to code
something else up on your own.

56
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.570
So give that a try and I'll give
you the my answer here very shortly
