00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.070
For the very last part of this course,

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.256
I have given you some raw materials and
some ideas for what you might do for

3
00:00:08.256 --> 00:00:13.940
laying out an inside page for
our website that we've been working on.

4
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.680
And I'm leaving this very open ended for
you.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.018
So if you look back over
the grid portion of this unit,

6
00:00:20.018 --> 00:00:24.706
we've talked about cards,
we've talked about magazine style layouts.

7
00:00:24.706 --> 00:00:29.626
We've talked about interesting effects
that we can do with overlapping grid

8
00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:34.466
cells, and we've talked about basic
sorts of layouts in terms of mosaics or

9
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:37.160
just a general grid based layout.

10
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.062
So, any of those types of
techniques are on the table for

11
00:00:41.062 --> 00:00:43.562
laying out these inside web pages.

12
00:00:43.562 --> 00:00:48.261
What I've done here is I've given
you a folder called raw materials,

13
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:52.816
inside of raw materials,
you're going to find a series of images.

14
00:00:52.816 --> 00:00:56.809
So these are pictures of doughnuts,
and they are very lovely.

15
00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.387
They're all different,
portrait and landscape,

16
00:01:00.387 --> 00:01:04.380
all kinds of mixed sort of images here and
some basic text.

17
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.090
So there is a woman on Pexels.

18
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.369
She is a professional
photographer with Pexels and

19
00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.850
some other various image agencies.

20
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.746
And so I have gotten her, here she is,
here's her profile, she's got some photos,

21
00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:24.490
these are links to the photos that
I have pulled here from Pexels.

22
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.780
You're welcome to go on Pexels and go
pull some different images if you prefer.

23
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.030
And I've given you,
let me wrap the text here.

24
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.970
I've given you a little bit of
information about her as an artist.

25
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.638
And do you should think
about how you could go

26
00:01:40.638 --> 00:01:43.308
about laying this out
as an inside Webpage,

27
00:01:43.308 --> 00:01:48.240
some things that I would suggest
that you think about along the way.

28
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.000
So first of all, I've given you
here in your beginning folder.

29
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.240
This is Listen to
the default browser here.

30
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.336
This is your web page
as it currently exists.

31
00:02:01.336 --> 00:02:03.830
This is the homepage of the website.

32
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.628
And I give this to you because maybe
there are elements from here that

33
00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:12.258
you want to reuse on the inside
page of the website.

34
00:02:12.258 --> 00:02:14.273
So you can think about which,

35
00:02:14.273 --> 00:02:18.866
some of these elements you'd like
to carry over to the inside page,

36
00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:23.394
hint, hint, maybe the header and
the footer might be a good idea.

37
00:02:23.394 --> 00:02:25.397
But that's really up to you.

38
00:02:25.397 --> 00:02:29.237
And so, you can pull whatever
you think makes sense, and

39
00:02:29.237 --> 00:02:31.405
set up some kind of inside page.

40
00:02:31.405 --> 00:02:36.457
So if you don't have any ideas
about what you want to do,

41
00:02:36.457 --> 00:02:41.180
I have given you a goal if
that is helpful to you?

42
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.994
So I said here's one idea for
the way this donut love page I

43
00:02:45.994 --> 00:02:50.490
call it Sharon,
Sharon Mccutchin donut love.

44
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.630
And I set this up the following
way as a mosaic grid based layout.

45
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.972
Notice that the top square of this
layout Has got some text on top of it,

46
00:02:59.972 --> 00:03:02.820
that little bit of text that I gave you.

47
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.010
This is one idea, you are more than
welcome to try out some other ideas.

48
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.480
So something with cards would
be a wonderful way to do this.

49
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.090
Something with a magazine type of layout
would be an interesting way to do this.

50
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.036
Or anything else that you can think of for
an inside page, and then on tablet mobile.

51
00:03:21.036 --> 00:03:23.252
I have it set up to work this way.

52
00:03:23.252 --> 00:03:27.900
Notice here I've got all the images
stacked on top of each other and

53
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.490
I've got the text hanging out all by
itself here at the top of the screen.

54
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.088
So you might want to give some thought
about how I managed to do that magic if

55
00:03:37.088 --> 00:03:38.945
that's the route you want to take, or

56
00:03:38.945 --> 00:03:42.210
maybe you want to code
something else up on your own.

57
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.580
So, give that a try, and I'll give
you the my answer here very shortly.
