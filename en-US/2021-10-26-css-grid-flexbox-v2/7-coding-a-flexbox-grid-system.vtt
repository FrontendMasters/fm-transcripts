00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.228
And so this is gonna start
with a display of flex and

2
00:00:06.228 --> 00:00:12.768
a flex flow of row wrap,
just like I told you before.

3
00:00:12.768 --> 00:00:17.755
By default, it'll do a row but
by default it'll also do no wrap,

4
00:00:17.755 --> 00:00:21.398
we do actually want it to
wrap onto other lines.

5
00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:26.481
Then I'm gonna say justify

6
00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:31.122
content space between.

7
00:00:31.122 --> 00:00:34.949
Okay, it looks a little
odd at the moment but

8
00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.888
just putting the space
in between the boxes.

9
00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:43.861
And then we can add to this a gap of 4%.

10
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:45.636
So in some of my previous courses,

11
00:00:45.636 --> 00:00:49.081
we've actually had to calculate
what this gap is and work with it.

12
00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:52.271
Now we can actually just declare it
like this with this new gap property,

13
00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:53.279
which is really nice.

14
00:00:57.444 --> 00:01:01.881
Obviously that's not quite
the look we were looking for, so

15
00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:04.845
let's continue writing some CSS here.

16
00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:09.678
So if I just say my figure has a flex

17
00:01:09.678 --> 00:01:14.519
basis of something like 22%.

18
00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:19.897
That will go ahead and
put my boxes here all on the first row.

19
00:01:19.897 --> 00:01:21.620
Now, where did I get those numbers from?

20
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.029
I'm sure you were wondering,
where did I get 22% from?

21
00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:29.244
Where do I get, for
my next row here with my next two set

22
00:01:29.244 --> 00:01:34.050
of boxes how are we going to
specify the flex basis for those.

23
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.524
And how do we know how the math works out,
so let me show you how that works.

24
00:01:38.524 --> 00:01:44.845
So let's draw out for
example our four boxes.

25
00:01:49.017 --> 00:01:52.689
There they are one, two, three, four and

26
00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.891
we've already set our gap to be 4% each,
so here's 4%,

27
00:01:57.891 --> 00:02:02.175
4%, 4% because there's a space between, so

28
00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:06.153
there's no gap on
the outside of these boxes.

29
00:02:06.153 --> 00:02:11.948
There's only a gap in between, so
that is our layout for a four box layout.

30
00:02:11.948 --> 00:02:15.433
So that's 12%, right?

31
00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:19.798
12%, four plus four plus four 12%,

32
00:02:19.798 --> 00:02:25.509
subtract that from 100% and
we wind up with 88%.

33
00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.885
That's what we have left over.

34
00:02:27.885 --> 00:02:34.060
So now we'll have to divide that by four
and we wind up with 22% that gonna be

35
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.339
the width of each of our boxes in order
to make this add up to 100% on our row.

36
00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:43.458
&gt;&gt; The gap is only for
horizontal spacing or

37
00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:46.954
is it also associated
with access concepts?

38
00:02:46.954 --> 00:02:51.114
&gt;&gt; Well, because we have all of
these contained inside of a row,

39
00:02:51.114 --> 00:02:54.404
this gap is only going to
be in between our boxes.

40
00:02:54.404 --> 00:02:59.246
If we had our flex boxes all wrapping
onto another, just wrapping in space all

41
00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:03.493
the way down the page as opposed to
putting them in artificial rows,

42
00:03:03.493 --> 00:03:07.310
I think you get a little bit of
gap in between the rows as well.

43
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.599
But that is not a thing with
the markup that we have here.

44
00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:18.787
All right, so now,
if I were to make a double box, right?

45
00:03:18.787 --> 00:03:24.108
I want this to span across two
of these columns on the page.

46
00:03:24.108 --> 00:03:29.098
So I have 22%, right?

47
00:03:29.098 --> 00:03:33.502
And 22% in my two boxes.

48
00:03:33.502 --> 00:03:38.415
So this larger box is gonna have to

49
00:03:38.415 --> 00:03:42.807
be 22 + 22 + 4, right?

50
00:03:42.807 --> 00:03:45.083
That gap in between.

51
00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:52.229
So that total comes to 48%, right?

52
00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:54.932
So, let's set that up.

53
00:04:01.107 --> 00:04:07.720
Let's set up a class here,
we'll call it span two.

54
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.533
And we'll set the flex basis to 48%, okay?

55
00:04:14.533 --> 00:04:16.786
Set the flex basis to 48%.

56
00:04:16.786 --> 00:04:21.842
Then all we need to do is apply
that class here in our HTML.

57
00:04:21.842 --> 00:04:26.860
So here on row two,
we have these two figures and

58
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.889
I am going to say a figure
has a class of span two.

59
00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:38.042
And the next figure has
a class of span two.

60
00:04:41.418 --> 00:04:42.308
So there we go.

61
00:04:42.308 --> 00:04:47.317
All of our boxes are all lining up very,
very nicely, okay?

62
00:04:47.317 --> 00:04:51.231
If you do wind up wanting a little
bit of space in between these rows.

63
00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:55.460
You could certainly add
here to your row class,

64
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.690
you could do something like margin bottom,
for

65
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.722
example, of whatever one REM or something.

66
00:05:03.722 --> 00:05:07.602
That would give you a little bit
of space in between the rows if

67
00:05:07.602 --> 00:05:10.126
that was important to you, all right?

68
00:05:10.126 --> 00:05:14.548
Or you could just leave that out it just
sort of depends on what your design is and

69
00:05:14.548 --> 00:05:18.913
what it is you're trying to build as to
whether you would include that or not.

70
00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:26.065
Okay, so
I'm gonna give you like 30 seconds.

71
00:05:26.065 --> 00:05:30.786
See if you can figure out what the values

72
00:05:30.786 --> 00:05:35.948
then would be for
span three and span four.

73
00:05:35.948 --> 00:05:40.693
These are going to be
the classes that we're

74
00:05:40.693 --> 00:05:45.063
going to apply here on row number three.

75
00:05:45.063 --> 00:05:48.129
So we have one box that's
gonna take up three columns,

76
00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:50.006
one box that takes up one column.

77
00:05:50.006 --> 00:05:54.499
And then on row four we have one giant
box going all the way across the row.

78
00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:59.735
So, do some quick math, and see if you
can figure out what those happen to be.

79
00:05:59.735 --> 00:06:03.093
Okay, so let's just check in on that then.

80
00:06:03.093 --> 00:06:08.032
So here on row number three,
we're gonna have our

81
00:06:08.032 --> 00:06:12.271
figure with a class of span three, right?

82
00:06:12.271 --> 00:06:19.035
And here on row four, we're gonna have
a figure with a class of span four.

83
00:06:19.035 --> 00:06:22.009
So that's pretty simple on the HTML.

84
00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:27.229
And then here in our CSS,
what are these values wind up being?

85
00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:31.017
So our flex basis is going to be what?

86
00:06:31.017 --> 00:06:31.713
Anybody?

87
00:06:31.713 --> 00:06:32.495
Does anybody know?

88
00:06:32.495 --> 00:06:34.141
Can you put it in the chat?

89
00:06:34.141 --> 00:06:37.621
&gt;&gt; Seeing several different answers
&gt;&gt; Several different answers.

90
00:06:37.621 --> 00:06:38.508
Okay.

91
00:06:38.508 --> 00:06:43.593
&gt;&gt; 74%, 72%, 76%, 74%.

92
00:06:43.593 --> 00:06:47.390
&gt;&gt; 72%, 74%, 76%, which one is it?

93
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.813
Okay, so let's see.

94
00:06:50.813 --> 00:06:53.892
We've got now four boxes or
three boxes, right?

95
00:06:53.892 --> 00:06:57.616
So one, two, three,

96
00:06:57.616 --> 00:07:02.523
22, 22, 22, right?

97
00:07:02.523 --> 00:07:09.346
So far so good at 66 and
then we've got 4 and 4.

98
00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:13.540
So another 8 in between, you don't have
to worry about the space that's on

99
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.962
the outside of the box
cuz there isn't any,

100
00:07:15.962 --> 00:07:18.795
using space between so
there's no outside space.

101
00:07:18.795 --> 00:07:21.671
It's only in between the boxes
that we have the gap.

102
00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:28.308
So if you said 74% you are a winner,
nicely done.

103
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.159
Okay, so
when we go back here it'll be 74%.

104
00:07:39.308 --> 00:07:42.933
And then for span 4,
what is its flex basis?

105
00:07:42.933 --> 00:07:43.804
&gt;&gt; 100.

106
00:07:43.804 --> 00:07:44.949
&gt;&gt; A 100%.

107
00:07:46.572 --> 00:07:52.566
Hopefully you said 100%,
four boxes of 22% each that's 88%,

108
00:07:52.566 --> 00:07:56.538
three gaps of four each,
that's another 12.

109
00:07:56.538 --> 00:07:58.852
So it winds up being 100%.

110
00:07:58.852 --> 00:08:02.394
So we've got our row one, that looks good.

111
00:08:02.394 --> 00:08:03.943
Row two, that looks good.

112
00:08:03.943 --> 00:08:06.633
Row three, that looks good.

113
00:08:06.633 --> 00:08:08.830
Row four is stretching all the way across.

114
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:13.473
The only last thing we have to do
now here is with row number five.

115
00:08:13.473 --> 00:08:18.645
And if we take a look at
our HTML in row number

116
00:08:18.645 --> 00:08:23.117
five I set a one to one distribution.

117
00:08:23.117 --> 00:08:26.789
But I'm actually going to put here for

118
00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:32.773
the first figure I'm gonna say span or
class equals span two.

119
00:08:32.773 --> 00:08:37.117
Because we may actually want
this particular box presumably

120
00:08:37.117 --> 00:08:41.128
the bigger box has got
the important information in it.

121
00:08:41.128 --> 00:08:46.595
So in terms of the order on the page
we will want that to be listed

122
00:08:46.595 --> 00:08:52.799
first in the row and then the supporting
elements which are presumably

123
00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:57.969
in the smaller boxes are going
to be here later in this row.

124
00:08:57.969 --> 00:09:02.330
Sorry we actually don't even need to
put any classes in here for this.

125
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:07.878
So we should have then one fat box, right?

126
00:09:07.878 --> 00:09:12.997
There it is, our span of two and
then there's two individuals.

127
00:09:12.997 --> 00:09:17.935
So now how are we going to make this go
to that one to one configuration that I

128
00:09:17.935 --> 00:09:19.617
mentioned what do we do?

129
00:09:23.118 --> 00:09:26.825
Anybody have any suggestions for
what we could do to fix that problem?

130
00:09:29.214 --> 00:09:31.835
Anyone have any suggestions in the chat?

131
00:09:31.835 --> 00:09:33.485
&gt;&gt; Order?
&gt;&gt; Order, yep, so

132
00:09:33.485 --> 00:09:36.963
we're gonna set up some order properties.

133
00:09:36.963 --> 00:09:42.133
And so I'm just gonna call

134
00:09:42.133 --> 00:09:47.304
mine order-1 which will

135
00:09:47.304 --> 00:09:51.776
have order one [LAUGH].

136
00:09:51.776 --> 00:09:56.904
Order-2 we'll be order two and

137
00:09:56.904 --> 00:10:04.056
order-3 will be order number three, okay?

138
00:10:04.056 --> 00:10:08.435
So we can just set those
up as individual classes.

139
00:10:08.435 --> 00:10:13.002
And then once you have those in place
you can just apply them to your HTML.

140
00:10:13.002 --> 00:10:17.203
So we now have a class of span two,

141
00:10:17.203 --> 00:10:20.814
and the class of order-2.

142
00:10:20.814 --> 00:10:25.353
So both remember classes you can
stack up more than one in your

143
00:10:25.353 --> 00:10:27.498
individual declarations.

144
00:10:27.498 --> 00:10:30.916
And then maybe this one here,

145
00:10:30.916 --> 00:10:36.675
the second figure will
have a class of order-1.

146
00:10:36.675 --> 00:10:41.712
And maybe this last one will

147
00:10:41.712 --> 00:10:46.756
have a class of order-3.

148
00:10:46.756 --> 00:10:51.238
If you scroll on down there,
it should all work out for you.

149
00:10:51.238 --> 00:10:56.782
&gt;&gt; Just in terms of, if any of
the elements had focusable elements

150
00:10:56.782 --> 00:11:01.594
inside of them we wouldn't
want to change the order for

151
00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:04.641
accessibility reasons, right?

152
00:11:04.641 --> 00:11:08.867
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you definitely have to factor
that into your choice of ordering and so

153
00:11:08.867 --> 00:11:10.460
forth here, yes absolutely
