00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.779
So we've got the right shape now we
definitely don't have it lining up

2
00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.506
here exactly right with
the other boxes that's okay.

3
00:00:08.506 --> 00:00:12.880
We'll get there in a moment, we just have
to get all the rest of the boxes in place.

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.821
So now, that you get a sense of what's
going on here and how this goes,

5
00:00:18.821 --> 00:00:23.683
don't worry again about
exactly lining these boxes up.

6
00:00:23.683 --> 00:00:27.364
With the painting we will
get there momentarily.

7
00:00:27.364 --> 00:00:32.800
But right now what I'd like for you to
do is to take let's say five minutes.

8
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.008
And I'd like you to go grid-row and

9
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:42.695
grid-column for the rest of D,

10
00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:47.470
E, F and G, all four of those.

11
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.383
See if you can spell out the grid-row and
the grid-column values and

12
00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:55.045
get it's not going to line up perfectly,
but we'll get there.

13
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.584
So specifically, I'm gonna tell you
whether I want the row or the column and

14
00:01:05.584 --> 00:01:06.516
for what letter.

15
00:01:06.516 --> 00:01:10.301
That we wouldn't have any confusion
mixing up columns and rows on such.

16
00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:12.743
So let's start with letter D.

17
00:01:12.743 --> 00:01:15.579
What was your answer for grid-row?

18
00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:16.930
&gt;&gt; 3/5.

19
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.423
&gt;&gt; 3/5, absolutely right.

20
00:01:21.423 --> 00:01:26.194
So remember that we have little f and
little g over here on the end.

21
00:01:26.194 --> 00:01:29.240
And so we're going to have
to span across some rows.

22
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.630
How about grid column for letter d?

23
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.456
&gt;&gt; 1/2.

24
00:01:32.456 --> 00:01:34.763
&gt;&gt; 1/2, exactly right.

25
00:01:34.763 --> 00:01:37.822
That's gonna line up
right underneath a and b.

26
00:01:37.822 --> 00:01:39.972
So there we go, perfect.

27
00:01:39.972 --> 00:01:43.875
All right how about letter E the row for
letter E?

28
00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:44.647
&gt;&gt; 3/5.

29
00:01:44.647 --> 00:01:49.428
&gt;&gt; 3/5 absolutely right again because
it's going to look exactly the same as

30
00:01:49.428 --> 00:01:50.096
letter d.

31
00:01:50.096 --> 00:01:54.407
And check that out f and g have already
all lined up exactly as we want.

32
00:01:54.407 --> 00:01:57.448
But we'll fill out the rest
of our numbers anyway.

33
00:01:57.448 --> 00:02:04.906
So the grid column for letter e is
going to be something like 2/3.

34
00:02:04.906 --> 00:02:09.985
And then when we get to f and
g the four letter f,

35
00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:17.033
we're gonna have 3/4 for
a row our column is gonna be 3/4.

36
00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:21.958
And for letter g,
our row is gonna be 4/5 and

37
00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:25.253
our column is gonna be 3/4.

38
00:02:25.253 --> 00:02:28.147
So you won't see the actual layout change.

39
00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:29.853
This is another aspect of grid.

40
00:02:29.853 --> 00:02:35.302
So grid tries to guess what it is that
you want to do with this particular page.

41
00:02:35.302 --> 00:02:39.810
And so we have been very deliberate
about spelling out all of the values for

42
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.201
our rows and columns.

43
00:02:41.201 --> 00:02:44.014
But we don't necessarily need to do that.

44
00:02:44.014 --> 00:02:47.293
And as you'll see going forward,
we'll start to drop out some of these

45
00:02:47.293 --> 00:02:50.750
properties, these extra properties
that aren't strictly needed here.

46
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.920
But this is good practice to think about
those lines and do all of the counting.

47
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.783
And come up with the answers
that you're looking for here for

48
00:02:57.783 --> 00:02:58.970
these complex layouts.
