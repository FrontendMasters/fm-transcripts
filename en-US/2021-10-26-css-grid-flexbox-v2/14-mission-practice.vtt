1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.360
Our next challenge is to include
a mission statement on the website.

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.171
This is gonna be placed just above the
collections portion of the webpage that

3
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:11.600
you just wrote.

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.600
And there I have two alternatives here for
you.

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.691
If you are new to Flexbox, Layout,
CSS, that type of thing, I have this

6
00:00:19.691 --> 00:00:25.910
alternative version here, which I'll lead
with that I'd like you to give this a try.

7
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.453
So notice here in the desktop screenshot
that we have a logo over here on

8
00:00:30.453 --> 00:00:35.970
the left hand side, it lines up very
nicely with the pictures underneath.

9
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.816
And then over here on the other side,

10
00:00:37.816 --> 00:00:42.220
we have some text which lines up with
these two images here underneath.

11
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:49.390
As we go to the tablet version, you see
some of that continues to hold true.

12
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.114
And then finally, in the mobile version,
we'll have the text on top and

13
00:00:54.114 --> 00:00:56.730
we'll have the logo underneath.

14
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.021
So that is the kind of thing that I'm
looking for if you are New to CSS.

15
00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:07.102
If you're not new to CSS, or you wanna
try a little bit more of a challenge,

16
00:01:07.102 --> 00:01:10.910
what I'd like for
you to do is to try this type of layout.

17
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.957
And this is there's the text
is sloping very nicely right

18
00:01:16.957 --> 00:01:19.850
alongside of the logo here.

19
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.337
This is something called CSS shapes and

20
00:01:23.337 --> 00:01:28.409
it allows you to float your logo and
then your CSS shapes to

21
00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.127
dictate how that text is going to
swoop down the side of the logo.

22
00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:39.058
So rather than you probably using Flexbox
where you're putting the logo in one

23
00:01:39.058 --> 00:01:43.690
box and the text in the other, here
you're gonna have to have the text with

24
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.644
a logo floated and then you CSS shapes to
drive that a little bit of a curve here.

25
00:01:48.644 --> 00:01:51.259
Then we're going to go to our tablet,

26
00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.010
which will maintain that type of layout
and then finally our mobile layout.

27
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.086
You can just stick the the logo up on top.

28
00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.830
So how did you do on the mission?

29
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.960
It was a little bit challenging.

30
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.605
Let me go through the version
of this with the CSS shapes.

31
00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:24.555
I've given you the final state of both
of these Inside of the GitHub files,

32
00:02:24.555 --> 00:02:28.756
this is chapter 4, this is 4B the mission.

33
00:02:28.756 --> 00:02:33.690
And you'll find an end state folder and
an end alt folder.

34
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.817
The end alt folder is got
the Flexbox answer in it and

35
00:02:36.817 --> 00:02:39.958
then I'm showing you here
the one with the shapes.

36
00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:44.795
Okay, so the HTML for
this is pretty straightforward.

37
00:02:44.795 --> 00:02:48.896
Once again, I'm using the section tag,
I'm using an ID,

38
00:02:48.896 --> 00:02:51.849
could easily have used a class as well,
but

39
00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.040
I used the ID cuz this is kinda
of the ID for my whole section.

40
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.207
That's the name of the section.

41
00:02:57.207 --> 00:02:59.210
It's the mission section.

42
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.090
And then I have my h2, our mission.

43
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.808
And then after that,
I have a with a class of mission text.

44
00:03:06.808 --> 00:03:09.603
Inside of that I have a paragraph and

45
00:03:09.603 --> 00:03:15.579
I have an image here with a class of
mission image and the text all after that.

46
00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.816
So that image is inside of the paragraph
with the rest of the text.

47
00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:25.004
And that's pretty much all there is to
know about this particular HTML and

48
00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:28.527
the more interesting part
is over here in the CSS.

49
00:03:28.527 --> 00:03:29.955
So let's scroll on down.

50
00:03:33.937 --> 00:03:36.246
So here are the mission styles.

51
00:03:40.672 --> 00:03:45.280
And we start here inside
of our mobile layout.

52
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.713
We have the, right, given the section
a little bit of margin on the bottom,

53
00:03:49.713 --> 00:03:54.285
we have the mission text itself set to
display block with a line height of 1.7

54
00:03:54.285 --> 00:03:57.985
just to give a little bit of
breathing room in between the text.

55
00:03:57.985 --> 00:04:02.588
And then the image I set a max
height on it of 100 pixels and

56
00:04:02.588 --> 00:04:04.622
I set it to display block.

57
00:04:04.622 --> 00:04:07.005
By setting the mission
image to display block and

58
00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:10.955
setting the mission text to display block,
that ensures they will stack on top of

59
00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:14.170
each other at mobile dimensions,
that's exactly what we want.

60
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.689
So then we get to our
tablet dimension here,

61
00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:26.520
we have my current favorite tip ever.

62
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.380
So clearing floats has
always been a problem.

63
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.950
Anytime you float something on the page,
you pull it out of the normal flow and

64
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.309
you tell it to go somewhere else on
the page and the remaining elements text

65
00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:44.680
whatever there is flows around the float,
that's the way it's supposed to work.

66
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.396
The problem is you probably seen before
in your own code sometimes weird layout

67
00:04:49.396 --> 00:04:53.040
things happen and
you don't understand what's going on and

68
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.900
the whole thing blew up and
all you did was say float left.

69
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.440
It's very annoying.

70
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.700
Anytime that happens it's because
you haven't cleared your float.

71
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.356
So that's the clear property or

72
00:05:03.356 --> 00:05:07.270
there's a lot of other techniques
that will also clear afloat.

73
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.060
But this is the coolest thing ever.

74
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.740
It's a brand new thing.

75
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.240
You can use this property,
display, flow, hyphen, route.

76
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.779
That will automatically
clear all of the floats that

77
00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:21.240
are contained within that
particular part of your web page.

78
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.050
So that's all I did.

79
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.257
I set up a display a flow
route to clear that and and

80
00:05:28.257 --> 00:05:35.880
the max width of 900 pixels just to
keep the text shorter on the page.

81
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.520
This next part I'm gonna
have to demonstrate for you.

82
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.820
This is the actual shape
outside portion of this.

83
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.407
And I'll walk you through exactly how to
put this in place because this is a very

84
00:05:46.407 --> 00:05:47.878
cool little bit of code.

85
00:05:47.878 --> 00:05:51.650
And we can do this through browser
tools inside of Firefox to set this up.

86
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.710
So I'll show you that in just a second.

87
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.945
I also gave my mission image
a max height of 211 pixels.

88
00:05:57.945 --> 00:06:00.962
All right, so let's go through that then.

89
00:06:05.535 --> 00:06:09.083
So when I open this up in
my browser window here and

90
00:06:09.083 --> 00:06:12.027
I'm going to put on my developer tools,

91
00:06:12.027 --> 00:06:17.240
now the important part here is that
you do this in Firefox not in Chrome.

92
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.832
Because Firefox has got the developer
tools for working with shape outside and

93
00:06:20.832 --> 00:06:21.660
Chrome does not.

94
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.950
So in your developer tools here,
we can go into our mission.

95
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.850
And we can go into the mission text,
see it how that's marked as flow route.

96
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:40.350
And then over here under our paragraph,
we click on the image here.

97
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:46.113
And then inside of your CSS rules,
see here where it says shape outside.

98
00:06:46.113 --> 00:06:50.035
And it's got a funny little
diagram right next to it.

99
00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:54.970
When you click that, it will show it
right here in your browser window.

100
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.340
So you can grab these points and
you can pull them around on the page.

101
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.913
So if you wanted to do something weird and

102
00:07:02.913 --> 00:07:08.150
crazy like that,
you could absolutely do that.

103
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.780
You could change the surround
however you want.

104
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.950
And notice that Firefox is very helpfully
updating all of that code for you.

105
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.407
So as I said in the notes for
this particular exercise,

106
00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:24.620
what I recommend that you do
is start with a line of code.

107
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.709
You can just go to MDN and copy the
existing line of code that they give you

108
00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:31.726
by default so
you have something to start with here.

109
00:07:31.726 --> 00:07:37.069
Drop it into CSS so just paste it in
your missing images of shape outside and

110
00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:42.490
then you can just drag these
little points around and so forth.

111
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:47.226
The interesting part about working
with shape outside is that it is

112
00:07:47.226 --> 00:07:51.390
very much based on the size
of the image itself.

113
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.230
So you noticed I gave you two logos.

114
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:58.081
One logo went with the alt version of it,
it was very tightly cropped.

115
00:07:58.081 --> 00:08:02.963
This version I had a lot of space
to the right of this and that is so

116
00:08:02.963 --> 00:08:09.490
that I have some room to play around with
these shape outside properties here.

117
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.659
If I didn't have all of this extra room,
I couldn't be pulling this point out so

118
00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:16.020
far, there we go right there.

119
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.140
So see how that clipped off right
there as I pulled that point way

120
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.980
across the page and then the text
sort of looks a little bit odd now.

121
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.435
That's because I exceeded
the width of that image and

122
00:08:28.435 --> 00:08:32.290
text is now wrapping around
that particular point.

123
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:37.286
So you might need to play around with
your images to give you whatever width

124
00:08:37.286 --> 00:08:41.620
you're going to need to make
shape outside work for you.

125
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.585
Once you've generated that,
then you just come to your browser tools,

126
00:08:45.585 --> 00:08:49.498
copy whatever it is that Firefox tells
you and paste that into your CSS.

127
00:08:49.498 --> 00:08:51.090
So that's the best way to set this up.
