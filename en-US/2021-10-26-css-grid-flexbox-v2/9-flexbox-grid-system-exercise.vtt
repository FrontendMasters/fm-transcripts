00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.948
Now based a little bit on the Flexbox that
we've been talking about all morning and

2
00:00:05.948 --> 00:00:09.720
the challenges that you
faced to this point in time,

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.810
here inside of your notes
Part 2C you try it.

4
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.803
So, we have a different pattern this time,
okay?

5
00:00:16.803 --> 00:00:21.292
Here's these five boxes, and I've
spelled out the challenge down here in

6
00:00:21.292 --> 00:00:24.080
the JavaScript section
cuz I'm not using it.

7
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.820
I put it in as a big comment.

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.708
And it says here, so you wanna put
all five figures on the same row with

9
00:00:30.708 --> 00:00:34.130
a 2% gap in between each box, okay?

10
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.620
And then if the window is less than 850
you have three boxes on one row and

11
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.530
two on the second.

12
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.210
So let me show you what the end
state of this is gonna look like.

13
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.144
So what I want you to do is build this,
here's five boxes on one row,

14
00:00:46.144 --> 00:00:47.536
there they are, okay?

15
00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:49.874
And when we go to a smaller dimension,

16
00:00:49.874 --> 00:00:52.510
I want you to try to get
it to look like this.

17
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.750
Whoa, so three boxes across the top,
these two underneath.

18
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.250
Look how they line up in between
the grids here in this particular layout.
