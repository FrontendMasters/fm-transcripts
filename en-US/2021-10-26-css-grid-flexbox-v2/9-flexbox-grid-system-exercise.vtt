00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.633
Now based a little bit on the Flexbox that
we've been talking about all morning and

2
00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:11.540
the the challenges that you faced at this
point in time here inside of your notes.

3
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.800
Part 2C, you try it.

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.410
So, we have a different pattern this time.

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.380
Okay, here's these five boxes.

6
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.387
And I've spelled out the challenge down
here in the JavaScript section because I'm

7
00:00:23.387 --> 00:00:24.070
not using it.

8
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.777
I put it in as a big comment.

9
00:00:25.777 --> 00:00:28.737
And it says here, so
you wanna put all five

10
00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:34.120
figures on the same row with a 2%
gap in between each box, okay?

11
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.640
And then if the window is less than 850,
you have three boxes on one row and

12
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.520
two on the second.

13
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.190
So let me show you what the end
state of this is gonna look like.

14
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.040
So what I want you to do is build this.

15
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.940
Here's five boxes on one row,
there they are.

16
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.790
Okay, and
when we go to a smaller dimension,

17
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.490
I want you to try to get
it to look like this.

18
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.802
Wow, so three boxes across the top,
these two underneath,

19
00:00:58.802 --> 00:01:04.240
look how they line up in between
the grids here in this particular layout
