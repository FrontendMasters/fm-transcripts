00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.680
Next up, let's take a look at some
possible sort of magazine style layout.

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.170
So I use the word magazine loosely here.

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.621
Typically on a website, maybe a content
management system based website or

4
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:17.793
a blog-based website where you have
a whole bunch of units of content,

5
00:00:17.793 --> 00:00:22.780
maybe there's an image, a little bit
of title, a little bit of starter text.

6
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.890
That type of thing, you may want to
play around with the look of that page.

7
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.970
So you have a lot of different units
that are coming in from a database or

8
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.024
from an API,
wherever it happens to be coming from.

9
00:00:35.024 --> 00:00:38.869
And you wanna lay out a bunch of
different boxes here on the web page.

10
00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:42.993
In flexbox you would just read those
in and they would wrap on two lines, so

11
00:00:42.993 --> 00:00:45.850
it actually kinda look just like this.

12
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.126
Here's all of the kittens of place kitten,

13
00:00:48.126 --> 00:00:50.590
and they're all just
lined up here in a row.

14
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.590
And that looks great.

15
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.724
But maybe you want to emphasize some
of these, maybe there are particularly

16
00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:04.520
important articles that happened
here inside of your system.

17
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.444
Maybe you want to make
some of these bigger,

18
00:01:07.444 --> 00:01:10.770
some of them different types of layouts.

19
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.794
It may even be something
you wanna program into,

20
00:01:13.794 --> 00:01:17.390
say an admin side on
a content management system.

21
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.200
Where your user could check off that
something is a featured article or

22
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.491
it's a main article and

23
00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:26.580
it would consequently display
differently inside of your web page.

24
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.010
So those are the kinds of problems
that I'm thinking of here next.

25
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.520
I'm once again sticking with figures here.

26
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.550
But you could very easily do
these as little units of content.

27
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.796
Maybe they're inside of div tags or
article tags and

28
00:01:40.796 --> 00:01:43.317
they have the same kind of information.

29
00:01:43.317 --> 00:01:47.480
Images and headings and maybe a little
bit of text, a link, that kind of thing.

30
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.292
So what I've got here to start
with is just all of these figures,

31
00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:57.000
they're coded up the same way you've seen
me code up figures throughout this course.

32
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.719
And then down here in RCSS we
have our images are set to 100%.

33
00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.592
Remember again, that's our hack for
responsive images so

34
00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:09.530
that they flex with the size of
the web page, just like that.

35
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.230
And I've also eliminated the figure
caption, I set a margin top of -4px.

36
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.268
You may have noticed in the default
styling inside of the figure that there is

37
00:02:21.268 --> 00:02:24.430
a small gap between the image and
the figure caption.

38
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.888
This is eliminating most of it,

39
00:02:25.888 --> 00:02:28.495
it looks like maybe there's
still a little bit there.

40
00:02:28.495 --> 00:02:31.755
Maybe it needs negative 5px.

41
00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:33.875
And then inside of my media query,

42
00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:37.005
I have laid these out just
in a simple grid system.

43
00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:38.877
So I said display: grid.

44
00:02:38.877 --> 00:02:41.189
I created four evenly sized columns,

45
00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.595
however many rows we needed,
and I set my gap to be 1%.

46
00:02:44.595 --> 00:02:49.557
So now the question is,
how do I set up exceptions to these rules?

47
00:02:49.557 --> 00:02:52.140
So not all of these are equally important.

48
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.880
Which is what this type
of display indicates.

49
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.340
How would I indicate that something is
more important here on the grid system, or

50
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.580
less important here on the grid system.

51
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.050
So let's go through how we might
set up something like that.

52
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.503
Let's say that I want to
set up a featured item.

53
00:03:13.712 --> 00:03:18.499
And you can define featured however
you want but let's just say in this

54
00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:23.858
particular situation that I want the
featured item to be particularly large,

55
00:03:23.858 --> 00:03:28.420
maybe I want it to go across a couple
of rows and a couple of columns.

56
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.999
So that one is particularly big and

57
00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:32.750
then everything else can
kind of wrap around it.

58
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.818
So I could just simply set
this up to say the class

59
00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:45.038
of featured would have
a grid row of say span 2 and

60
00:03:45.038 --> 00:03:50.369
a grid column of span 2, just like that.

61
00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:54.450
From wherever it is, make it span
across two columns and two rows.

62
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.627
So then when I go and drop that in,
I could just pick any of

63
00:03:59.627 --> 00:04:05.750
these particular articles and
say that it's a featured item.

64
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.672
So this one's gonna be featured and
that one's gonna be featured.

65
00:04:14.543 --> 00:04:19.489
So just by picking two things and
putting them here inside of the layout,

66
00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.373
you'll see here that grid will very
nicely take that particular item.

67
00:04:24.373 --> 00:04:27.710
It blows it up over two rows and
two columns, and

68
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.476
it will just wrap the other kittens
around it just like that, okay?

69
00:04:32.476 --> 00:04:36.833
So you could continue to tweak these
a little bit more if you wanted,

70
00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:42.042
to make sure that your larger image, maybe
you wanna pull that down a little bit.

71
00:04:42.042 --> 00:04:46.836
Or you maybe there's more text that goes
here with a featured image that shows,

72
00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:49.570
that type of thing would
be one possibility.

73
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.093
But as you can see here,

74
00:04:52.093 --> 00:04:57.540
it's very easy just to apply this type
of thing wherever you want it to occur.

75
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.915
If you wanted to be very specific about
where that specific featured item

76
00:05:01.915 --> 00:05:06.300
occurred, so it's kinda weird to have
it here in the middle of the page.

77
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.410
Maybe you really want it
towards the top of the page.

78
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.572
Then as always,

79
00:05:10.572 --> 00:05:15.650
you could be more specific about your
grid rows and your grid columns.

80
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.130
So let's just say, for example,
our grid row is gonna be 1/ span 2.

81
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.920
In our grid column is gonna be 1/ span 2.

82
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.791
So now here's my featured
image up here at the top and

83
00:05:29.791 --> 00:05:33.370
all of the others wrap around.

84
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.731
But be very careful when you use this
type of notation because we have

85
00:05:38.731 --> 00:05:43.808
said that the class of featured
always starts at a grid row of 1,

86
00:05:43.808 --> 00:05:46.739
always starts at a grid column of 1.

87
00:05:46.739 --> 00:05:51.160
I had originally applied this
to two different cats, hadn't I?

88
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:57.570
So if we double check here, we've got 1,
2, 3, and then 5, so 4 is missing.

89
00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.760
4 has the class of
featured on it right here.

90
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.960
And then we go through 6,
7, 8, and then 10.

91
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.420
So cat number 9 has
the class of featured on it.

92
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:17.930
But if you'll notice, we see cat number 9,
but we do not see cat number 4.

93
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.650
Why is that?

94
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.590
&gt;&gt; Override.

95
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.320
&gt;&gt; Not quite an override.

96
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.453
What's going on here is
we've started at row 1,

97
00:06:29.453 --> 00:06:34.650
line number 1 and
the column line number 1.

98
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.200
So these two cats are on
top of each other.

99
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.540
Cat number 4 is here, but
it's underneath cat number 9.

100
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.962
&gt;&gt; Yeah, underneath, overlap.

101
00:06:43.962 --> 00:06:47.439
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yep, underneath overlap, exactly.

102
00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:52.325
Exactly, you can use the z-index
property to change the order of these.

103
00:06:52.325 --> 00:06:57.068
So if you wanted to,
let's say, cat number 4,

104
00:06:57.068 --> 00:07:01.021
we'll say featured and we'll say top.

105
00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:05.786
We could set up a class of top just for
fun.

106
00:07:05.786 --> 00:07:10.482
And then we could say
a z-index of whatever,

107
00:07:10.482 --> 00:07:14.320
will be extreme and say 1,000.

108
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.550
And now cat number 4 is on top,
the cat number 8 is underneath, okay?

109
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:23.355
So remember that won't happen if you're
not specifying where these are supposed

110
00:07:23.355 --> 00:07:24.090
to start.

111
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.314
If we Instead specify these
as just a generic span 2,

112
00:07:27.314 --> 00:07:31.970
they show up wherever they are,
and you'll see both of them.

113
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.336
So you'll need to give that a little bit
of thought as you work through an example

114
00:07:35.336 --> 00:07:35.850
like this.

115
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.230
That is one type of syntax that you
can use for a problem like this.

116
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.830
So you can use that span notation with the
lines that we've talked about quite a bit

117
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.438
to this point in the course.

118
00:07:46.438 --> 00:07:51.240
There is a another kind of syntax,
this is called the grid template areas.

119
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.950
So let's go through exactly how
we would go about doing that.

120
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.820
And a couple of other pointers
along the way here as well.

121
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.610
So first of all, we've specified how
many columns and how many rows we have.

122
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:10.299
Now I can actually name certain
combinations of columns and

123
00:08:10.299 --> 00:08:13.600
rows into a very specific area.

124
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:19.131
And the way that I would
go about doing that is

125
00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:24.673
using the grid-template-areas syntax.

126
00:08:24.673 --> 00:08:28.869
And the way that that one works,
it's a little bit weird in CSS,

127
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:32.223
a very odd looking syntax,
but this is how it goes.

128
00:08:32.223 --> 00:08:36.737
We are going to say grid-template-areas,
that's our property colon,

129
00:08:36.737 --> 00:08:38.751
just like you normally do in CSS.

130
00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:43.280
And then inside of the quotes,
this is going to be my first row.

131
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.950
Here, I'm going to say,
featured featured featured featured.

132
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:56.031
That looks very, very repetitive,
but basically I'm saying that in my

133
00:08:56.031 --> 00:09:01.390
first row all four of those cells
are assigned a area name of featured.

134
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:09.930
And then if I wanted to add to
this a second row of information,

135
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:16.415
I could say something like
this ......main main.

136
00:09:16.415 --> 00:09:19.670
So here I'm saying we're gonna have,
on the next row,

137
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.430
we're gonna have two items here
they're gonna be called main.

138
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.230
And then we'll put in the semi colon.

139
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.016
You could continue on like this for
as long as you wanted.

140
00:09:29.016 --> 00:09:34.398
You could make things span over the rows
in addition to spanning over the columns,

141
00:09:34.398 --> 00:09:36.198
whatever you want it to do.

142
00:09:36.198 --> 00:09:40.661
But basically you're taking each cell
going across in that row and you're giving

143
00:09:40.661 --> 00:09:44.799
it a name and if there are two cells that
have the same name next to each other,

144
00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:47.250
they fuse into a single area.

145
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.155
If you have two cells in different rows,
they have the same name,

146
00:09:51.155 --> 00:09:53.150
they fuse into different areas.

147
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.480
That's how that all works.

148
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.780
So once you have these names established,

149
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:04.880
then you can go through and
change around your styling here.

150
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.960
So rather than saying featured
with using the span notation.

151
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:14.500
Here what we're going to do instead is
we're gonna say grid-area: featured.

152
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:22.390
So whatever has the class of featured
is now assigned to the featured area.

153
00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:27.403
So here's that cat that is going to occupy
that full first row, and in fact we have

154
00:10:27.403 --> 00:10:32.148
two cats occupying that because we have
two cats with the class of featured.

155
00:10:32.148 --> 00:10:36.361
And this time cat number 4 also
has the class of top on it with

156
00:10:36.361 --> 00:10:38.483
the z-index of 1,000.

157
00:10:38.483 --> 00:10:42.150
So that one winds up on top and
the other cat is underneath.

158
00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.389
Likewise, we could say,
set up a class of main,

159
00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:55.300
And we could say it has
a grid area of main.

160
00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:02.525
And that will be our other location for
some kind of cat here,

161
00:11:02.525 --> 00:11:08.240
and we can just go ahead and
assign that here in our HTML.

162
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.730
So, cat number,
whatever this was, cat number 8,

163
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:18.400
let's just say we wanted to
put that in the main location.

164
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.840
So we'll give it a class of main.

165
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:27.040
And now you'll see,
There's the cat with the class of main.

166
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.960
And we have the other cats filling in
all the way around it just like that.

167
00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.814
Kind of a nice sort of setup.

168
00:11:34.814 --> 00:11:38.525
And so once again,
if you're on a content management system,

169
00:11:38.525 --> 00:11:43.427
this might be a better approach to getting
those images, or units of information,

170
00:11:43.427 --> 00:11:48.510
whatever they happen to be, off the server
and then arranging them here on the page.

171
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:54.326
You could set some UI that will allow your
content creators to assign specific areas,

172
00:11:54.326 --> 00:11:59.390
like feature domain, or
you can call them whatever you want.

173
00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:04.730
And that would allow them to set up
a web page configuration like this,

174
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.277
that type of thing.

175
00:12:06.277 --> 00:12:10.777
Doesn't have to be in the top edges,
the way that I've drawn it here, but

176
00:12:10.777 --> 00:12:14.165
that's generally a good way of doing that.

177
00:12:14.165 --> 00:12:18.015
You're also not prevented from
combining these techniques.

178
00:12:18.015 --> 00:12:20.615
So just because we started
here with grid area,

179
00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:24.505
does not mean that we can't
use the span syntax anymore.

180
00:12:24.505 --> 00:12:28.590
So we could start setting up
some span syntax as well.

181
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:34.134
So if I had another one here,
let's call it middle.

182
00:12:37.014 --> 00:12:41.380
I could say a grid row of span 2.

183
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:46.452
Oops, span space 2 and a grid column of

184
00:12:46.452 --> 00:12:51.985
span space 2, and
we can then take that and

185
00:12:51.985 --> 00:12:57.435
assign it to any of these class as well.

186
00:12:57.435 --> 00:13:01.295
So let's say cat number 1,
we actually want it to go to the middle.

187
00:13:03.925 --> 00:13:05.025
Actually not cat 1.

188
00:13:05.025 --> 00:13:08.436
Let's do cat here in the middle.

189
00:13:08.436 --> 00:13:16.976
Class, Class=middle.

190
00:13:16.976 --> 00:13:20.360
There we go.

191
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:24.170
And then if you take a quick peek,
there it is.

192
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:29.280
So here is the main cat here, and
then here is the middle cat over here.

193
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:33.648
It looks like I just happened to pick
such a space that it wound up showing up

194
00:13:33.648 --> 00:13:34.850
over here.

195
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.854
If I took that class of middle and
moved elsewhere,

196
00:13:46.292 --> 00:13:49.360
Now it's over here on
the left-hand side instead.

197
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.700
Okay, just sort of depends.

198
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.604
Yeah, Mark
&gt;&gt; With grid-template-areas,

199
00:13:54.604 --> 00:13:59.077
what's the difference between
the dot dot dot and just dot again?

200
00:13:59.077 --> 00:14:00.720
&gt;&gt; I don't think there is a difference.

201
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.794
You can have just plain one dot or
you can have the three dots and

202
00:14:03.794 --> 00:14:05.460
I think it will do the same thing.

203
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.090
It's kind of an offset type of situation.

204
00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:10.030
That's what that is doing.

205
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:11.830
&gt;&gt; There's people saying it so cool magic.

206
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.082
&gt;&gt; So cool magic.

207
00:14:13.082 --> 00:14:14.460
I know, no math.

208
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.669
Isn't it great?

209
00:14:15.669 --> 00:14:17.780
Super fun stuff.

210
00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:22.332
So this is just a concept type of page
here to give you, hopefully, again,

211
00:14:22.332 --> 00:14:26.650
generate ideas about how grid could
be used in your page layouts.

212
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.820
You can think of these
figures as cards potentially.

213
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.560
That's actually our next
topic to talk about.

214
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.488
This is one type of treatment
that you could use for

215
00:14:35.488 --> 00:14:38.890
laying out different kinds
of cards on the web page.

216
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:42.440
We've kept this layout really,
really simple so far.

217
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:48.560
Notice that I have a media query,
it's at a minimum width of 600px.

218
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.417
So I've just kept this as
simple as simple can be, but

219
00:14:51.417 --> 00:14:54.540
you can actually take this
to a whole 'nother level.

220
00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.851
And that's what we're gonna look at and
then next section here,

221
00:14:57.851 --> 00:15:00.090
as we start to look at card-based layouts.
