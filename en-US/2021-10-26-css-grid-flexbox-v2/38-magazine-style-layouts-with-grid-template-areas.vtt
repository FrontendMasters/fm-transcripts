00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.697
Next up let's take a look at some
possible sort of magazine style layouts

2
00:00:05.697 --> 00:00:10.554
I use the word magazine loosely here
that typically on a website maybe

3
00:00:10.554 --> 00:00:15.349
a content management system based
website or a blog based website.

4
00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.308
Where you have a whole bunch of units of
content maybe there's an image a little

5
00:00:20.308 --> 00:00:24.737
bit of a title a little bit of starter
text that type of thing you may want

6
00:00:24.737 --> 00:00:27.363
to play around with
the look of that page so

7
00:00:27.363 --> 00:00:31.678
you have a lot of different units
that are coming in from a database.

8
00:00:31.678 --> 00:00:34.928
Or from an API wherever it
happens to be coming from and

9
00:00:34.928 --> 00:00:39.695
you want to lay out a bunch of different
boxes here on the webpage, in flex box,

10
00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:43.378
you would just read those in and
they would wrap on two lines so

11
00:00:43.378 --> 00:00:45.861
it actually kind of look just like this.

12
00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:49.401
Here's all of the kittens
of place kitten and

13
00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:54.245
they're all just lined up here in
a row and that looks great but

14
00:00:54.245 --> 00:01:00.696
maybe you want to emphasize some of these
maybe they are particularly important.

15
00:01:00.696 --> 00:01:05.758
Articles that happen here inside of
your system maybe you want to make

16
00:01:05.758 --> 00:01:11.079
some of these bigger some of them
different types of layouts it may even be

17
00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:17.300
something you want to program into say an
admin side on a content management system.

18
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.492
Where your user could check off that
something is a featured article or

19
00:01:21.492 --> 00:01:25.971
it's a main article and it would
consequently display differently inside

20
00:01:25.971 --> 00:01:30.162
of your web page so those are the kinds
of problems that I'm thinking of

21
00:01:30.162 --> 00:01:33.455
here next I'm once again
sticking with figures here.

22
00:01:33.455 --> 00:01:38.510
But you could very easily do these as
little units of content maybe they're

23
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.726
inside of div tags or article tags and
they have the same kind of information,

24
00:01:43.726 --> 00:01:49.125
images and headings and maybe a little
bit of text, a link, that kind of thing.

25
00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:54.141
So what I've got here to start with is
just all of these figures they're coded

26
00:01:54.141 --> 00:01:59.232
up the The same way you've seen me encode
up figures throughout this course and

27
00:01:59.232 --> 00:02:03.343
then down here in our CSS we
have our images are set to 100%.

28
00:02:03.343 --> 00:02:07.029
Remember again that's our hack for
responsive images so

29
00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:10.866
that they flex with the size of
the webpage just like that and

30
00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:15.702
I've also eliminated the finger caption
I set a margin top of negative four

31
00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:20.413
pixels you may have noticed in
the default styling inside of the figure.

32
00:02:20.413 --> 00:02:23.252
That there is a small gap
between the image and

33
00:02:23.252 --> 00:02:27.512
the figure caption this is eliminating
most of it it looks like maybe

34
00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:32.072
there's still a little bit there maybe
it needs negative five pixels and

35
00:02:32.072 --> 00:02:37.026
then inside of my media query I have laid
these out just in a simple grid system.

36
00:02:37.026 --> 00:02:41.314
So I said display grid I created
four evenly sized columns,

37
00:02:41.314 --> 00:02:45.356
however many rows we needed,
and I set my gap to be 1%.

38
00:02:45.356 --> 00:02:49.532
So now the question is, how do I set
up exceptions to these rules, So

39
00:02:49.532 --> 00:02:52.044
not all of these are equally important?

40
00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:56.527
Which is what this type of display
indicates how would I indicate that

41
00:02:56.527 --> 00:03:00.004
something is more important
here on the grid system or

42
00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:02.649
less important here on the grid system.

43
00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:07.037
So let's go through how we
might set up something like

44
00:03:07.037 --> 00:03:11.423
that let's say that I want to
set up a featured item and

45
00:03:11.423 --> 00:03:16.492
you can define featured however
you want but let's just say in

46
00:03:16.492 --> 00:03:23.350
this particular situation that I want the
featured item to be particularly large.

47
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.119
Maybe I want it to go across a couple of
rows and a couple of columns so that one

48
00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:32.765
is particularly big and then everything
else can kind of wrap around it.

49
00:03:32.765 --> 00:03:38.805
So I could just simply set
this up to say the class

50
00:03:38.805 --> 00:03:44.996
of featured would have
a grid row of say span 2 and

51
00:03:44.996 --> 00:03:49.991
a grid column of span 2 just like that.

52
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:54.044
From wherever it is make it
span across two columns and

53
00:03:54.044 --> 00:03:58.725
two rows so, then when I go and
drop that in I could just pick any

54
00:03:58.725 --> 00:04:03.681
of these particular articles and
say that it's a featured item so

55
00:04:03.681 --> 00:04:09.477
this one's gonna be featured, third,
and that one's gonna be featured.

56
00:04:13.476 --> 00:04:18.788
So just by picking two things and
putting them here inside of the layout,

57
00:04:18.788 --> 00:04:24.012
you'll see here that grid will very
nicely take that particular item,

58
00:04:24.012 --> 00:04:27.320
it blows it up over two rows into columns,
and

59
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.796
it will just wrap the other
kittens around it just like that.

60
00:04:31.796 --> 00:04:36.931
Okay, so you could continue to tweak
these a little bit more if you wanted to

61
00:04:36.931 --> 00:04:42.228
make sure that your larger image maybe you
want to pull that down a little bit or

62
00:04:42.228 --> 00:04:46.957
you maybe there's more text that
goes here with a featured image that

63
00:04:46.957 --> 00:04:50.493
shows that type of thing
would be one possibility.

64
00:04:50.493 --> 00:04:55.412
But as you can see here it's very easy
just to apply this type of thing wherever

65
00:04:55.412 --> 00:05:00.330
you want it to occur If you want it to be
very specific about where that specific

66
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.248
featured item occurred, so it's kind of
weird to have it here in the middle of

67
00:05:05.248 --> 00:05:09.287
the page, maybe you really want
it towards the top of the page.

68
00:05:09.287 --> 00:05:14.424
Then as always, you could be more
specific about your grid rows and

69
00:05:14.424 --> 00:05:19.561
your grid columns so, let's just say for
example, our grid row is

70
00:05:19.561 --> 00:05:25.455
going to be one slash spam to in our grid
column is gonna be one slash span two.

71
00:05:25.455 --> 00:05:29.679
So now here's my featured
image up here at the top and

72
00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:34.863
all of the others wrap around but
be very careful when you use this

73
00:05:34.863 --> 00:05:40.335
type of notation, because we have
said that the class of featured,

74
00:05:40.335 --> 00:05:46.405
always starts at a grid, row of one,
always starts at a grid column of one.

75
00:05:46.405 --> 00:05:52.923
I had originally applied this to
two different cats have mine so,

76
00:05:52.923 --> 00:05:58.729
if we double check here we've got 1,
2, 3 and then 5,

77
00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:04.789
so 4 is missing 4 has the class
of featured on it right here.

78
00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:08.852
And then we go through 6,
7, 8 and then 10 so

79
00:06:08.852 --> 00:06:14.402
cat number 9 has the class of
featured on it but if you'll notice,

80
00:06:14.402 --> 00:06:19.877
we see cat number 9, but
we do not see cat number 4, why is that?

81
00:06:19.877 --> 00:06:23.110
&gt;&gt; Override?

82
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:29.464
&gt;&gt; Not quite an override what's going on
here is we have, we've said started at

83
00:06:29.464 --> 00:06:34.571
row 1 line number one and
a column the column line number one.

84
00:06:34.571 --> 00:06:39.516
So these two cats are on top of
each other cat number four is here,

85
00:06:39.516 --> 00:06:42.549
but it's underneath cat number nine.

86
00:06:42.549 --> 00:06:43.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, underneath.

87
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.734
&gt;&gt; Yeah yep underneath overlap exactly,

88
00:06:47.734 --> 00:06:53.752
you can use the Z index property
to change the order of these so

89
00:06:53.752 --> 00:07:00.242
if you wanted to let's say cat
number four we'll say featured and

90
00:07:00.242 --> 00:07:04.621
we'll say top we could
set up a class of top.

91
00:07:04.621 --> 00:07:09.472
Just for fun, and
then we could say Z index of

92
00:07:09.472 --> 00:07:14.336
whatever will be extreme and say 1000.

93
00:07:14.336 --> 00:07:18.470
And now cat number four is on top,
the cat number eight is underneath, okay?

94
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.964
So remember that won't happen if
you're not specifying where these

95
00:07:22.964 --> 00:07:27.846
are supposed to start if we Instead
specify these as just a generic span to,

96
00:07:27.846 --> 00:07:31.891
they show up wherever they are,
and you'll see both of them.

97
00:07:31.891 --> 00:07:36.157
So you'll need to give that a little bit
of thought as you work through an example

98
00:07:36.157 --> 00:07:40.185
like this that is one type of syntax that
you can use for a problem like this.

99
00:07:40.185 --> 00:07:45.135
So you can use that span notation With the
lines that we've talked about quite a bit

100
00:07:45.135 --> 00:07:48.794
to this point in the course
there's another kind of syntax,

101
00:07:48.794 --> 00:07:51.251
this is called the grid template areas.

102
00:07:51.251 --> 00:07:55.690
So let's go through exactly how
we would go about doing that and

103
00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:00.629
a couple of other pointers along the way
here as well, so first of all we

104
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:05.442
can see we've specified how many
columns and how many rows we have.

105
00:08:05.442 --> 00:08:10.514
Now I can actually name
certain combinations

106
00:08:10.514 --> 00:08:15.853
of columns and
rows into a very specific area and

107
00:08:15.853 --> 00:08:20.389
the way that I would
go about doing that is

108
00:08:20.389 --> 00:08:24.810
using the grid template areas syntax.

109
00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:29.457
And the way that that one works it's
a little bit weird and CSS is very odd

110
00:08:29.457 --> 00:08:34.494
looking syntax but this is how it goes
we are going to say grid template areas,

111
00:08:34.494 --> 00:08:38.704
that's our property,
column just like you normally do in CSS.

112
00:08:38.704 --> 00:08:41.368
And then inside of the quotes,

113
00:08:41.368 --> 00:08:46.183
this is going to be my first row here,
I'm going to say,

114
00:08:46.183 --> 00:08:52.644
featured featured featured featured
that looks very, very repetitive.

115
00:08:52.644 --> 00:08:58.271
But basically I'm saying that
in my first row all four of

116
00:08:58.271 --> 00:09:03.419
those cells are assigned
a area name of featured and

117
00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:09.284
then if I wanted to add to this
a second row of information,

118
00:09:09.284 --> 00:09:16.736
I could say something like this,
dot dot, dot, dot, dot dot main main.

119
00:09:16.736 --> 00:09:21.397
So here I'm saying on the next row,
we're gonna have two items here,

120
00:09:21.397 --> 00:09:26.068
they're going to be called main and
then we'll put in the semicolon.

121
00:09:26.068 --> 00:09:28.198
You could continue on like this for

122
00:09:28.198 --> 00:09:32.018
as long as you wanted you could
make things span over the rows in

123
00:09:32.018 --> 00:09:36.218
addition to spanning over the columns,
whatever you wanted to do.

124
00:09:36.218 --> 00:09:40.163
But basically you're taking each
cell going across in that row and

125
00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:44.671
you're giving it a name and if there
are two cells that have the same name next

126
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:47.223
to each other they fuse
into a single area.

127
00:09:47.223 --> 00:09:52.003
If you have two cells in different
rows they have the same name

128
00:09:52.003 --> 00:09:56.878
they fuse into different areas
that's how that all works, so

129
00:09:56.878 --> 00:10:01.941
once you have these names established
then you can go through and

130
00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:04.874
change around, your styling here.

131
00:10:04.874 --> 00:10:09.819
So rather than saying featured
with using the span notation,

132
00:10:09.819 --> 00:10:16.110
here what we're going to do instead is
we're going to say grid area featured.

133
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:22.409
So whatever has the class of featured
is now assigned to the featured area.

134
00:10:22.409 --> 00:10:27.593
So here's that cat that is going
to occupy that full first row.

135
00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:28.392
And in fact,

136
00:10:28.392 --> 00:10:33.335
we have two cats occupying that because we
have two cats with the class of featured

137
00:10:33.335 --> 00:10:38.436
in this time cat number four also has the
class of top on it with a Z index of 1000.

138
00:10:38.436 --> 00:10:44.193
So that one winds up on top and
the other cat is underneath.

139
00:10:44.193 --> 00:10:50.821
Likewise we could say to
set up I class of main and

140
00:10:50.821 --> 00:10:56.144
we could say it has a grid area of main.

141
00:10:56.144 --> 00:11:00.072
And that will be our other location for

142
00:11:00.072 --> 00:11:04.367
some time and
have some kind of cat here and

143
00:11:04.367 --> 00:11:09.796
we can just go ahead and
assign that here in our HTML.

144
00:11:09.796 --> 00:11:14.846
So cat number whatever this
was cat number eight let's

145
00:11:14.846 --> 00:11:20.003
just say we wanted to make put
that in the main location so

146
00:11:20.003 --> 00:11:22.965
we'll give it a class of mean and

147
00:11:22.965 --> 00:11:27.944
now you'll see there's
the cat with a class of mean.

148
00:11:27.944 --> 00:11:32.297
And we have the other cats filling
in all the way around it just like

149
00:11:32.297 --> 00:11:34.449
that kind of a nice sorta setup.

150
00:11:34.449 --> 00:11:38.318
And so once again,
if you're on a content management system,

151
00:11:38.318 --> 00:11:43.282
this might be a better approach to getting
those images or units of information,

152
00:11:43.282 --> 00:11:48.475
whatever they happen to be off the server,
and then arranging them here on the page.

153
00:11:48.475 --> 00:11:54.115
You could set some UI that will allow,
your content creators, to assign,

154
00:11:54.115 --> 00:11:59.934
specific areas like featured or main or
you can call them whatever you want and

155
00:11:59.934 --> 00:12:04.972
that would allow them to set up
a web page configuration like this.

156
00:12:04.972 --> 00:12:09.411
That type of thing, doesn't have to
be in the top edges the way that

157
00:12:09.411 --> 00:12:13.693
I've drawn it here but
that's generally a good way of doing that

158
00:12:13.693 --> 00:12:17.916
you're also not prevented from
combining these techniques.

159
00:12:17.916 --> 00:12:22.936
So just because we started here
with grid area does not mean that

160
00:12:22.936 --> 00:12:28.426
we can't use the span syntax anymore so
we could start setting up some

161
00:12:28.426 --> 00:12:33.933
span syntax as well so if I had
another one here let's call it middle.

162
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:45.090
I could say a grid row have
span 2 loops span space 2 and

163
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:49.950
a grid column of span space 2 and

164
00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:55.219
we could then take that And

165
00:12:55.219 --> 00:13:00.554
assign it to any of these class as well so
let's say cat number one,

166
00:13:00.554 --> 00:13:05.317
we actually want it to go to
the middle actually not cat one,

167
00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:08.007
let's do cat here in the middle.

168
00:13:15.376 --> 00:13:21.169
Class equals middle go and then if
you take a quick peek there it is so

169
00:13:21.169 --> 00:13:24.377
here's here's the main cat here and

170
00:13:24.377 --> 00:13:30.068
then here's the middle cat over
here it looks like I just happened

171
00:13:30.068 --> 00:13:35.057
to pick such a space that it
wound up showing up over here.

172
00:13:35.057 --> 00:13:37.589
If I took that class in middle and
moved it elsewhere.

173
00:13:46.482 --> 00:13:52.362
Now, it's over here on the left hand side
instead just sort of depends yeah, Mark.

174
00:13:52.362 --> 00:13:57.566
&gt;&gt; With grid template areas, what's
the difference between the dot dot dot and

175
00:13:57.566 --> 00:14:00.969
just dot again
&gt;&gt; I don't think there is a difference you

176
00:14:00.969 --> 00:14:05.174
can have just plain old dots or you can
have the three dots and I think it will do

177
00:14:05.174 --> 00:14:09.948
the same thing it's kind of an offset type
of situation, that's what that is doing.

178
00:14:09.948 --> 00:14:11.708
&gt;&gt; What's people saying so cool magic?

179
00:14:11.708 --> 00:14:17.700
&gt;&gt; So cool magic I know no math
isn't it great, super fun stuff.

180
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:22.343
So this is just a concept type of
page here to give you hopefully again

181
00:14:22.343 --> 00:14:26.831
generate ideas about how grid could
be used in your page layouts.

182
00:14:26.831 --> 00:14:31.551
You can think of these figures as cards
potentially that's actually our next topic

183
00:14:31.551 --> 00:14:32.436
to talk about.

184
00:14:32.436 --> 00:14:37.360
This is one type of treatment that you
could, use for laying out different kinds

185
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.226
of cards on the webpage we've kept this
layout really, really simple so far.

186
00:14:42.226 --> 00:14:47.318
Notice that I have a media query,
it's at a minimum width of 600 pixels so

187
00:14:47.318 --> 00:14:52.014
I've just kept this as simple as
simple can be, but you can actually,

188
00:14:52.014 --> 00:14:54.415
take this to a whole another level.

189
00:14:54.415 --> 00:14:58.782
And that's what we're going to look at in
the next section here as we start to look

190
00:14:58.782 --> 00:15:00.080
at card based layouts.
