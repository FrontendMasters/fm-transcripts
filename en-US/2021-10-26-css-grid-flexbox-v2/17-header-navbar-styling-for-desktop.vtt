1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.454
Okay, so let's get this styling here,

2
00:00:03.454 --> 00:00:09.360
I'm going to set this up just after
section UL here around line 52.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.612
Let's go ahead and put on our nav,
header and nav styles here,

4
00:00:14.612 --> 00:00:21.073
header and nav styles, okay, we'll
give ourselves a little bit more room.

5
00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:32.403
Okay, so we'll start with that header,

6
00:00:32.403 --> 00:00:36.823
the header class and let's assign its

7
00:00:36.823 --> 00:00:41.812
background color, that's gonna be var.

8
00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:44.475
Color number five, the light yellow so

9
00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:49.569
that'll give us a nice light yellow
bar across the outside of the webpage.

10
00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:54.677
And if we refresh you should now see
yellow there at the top, you'll also

11
00:00:54.677 --> 00:01:00.139
see a little bit of green above that and
some other things, one step at a time.

12
00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:03.714
That stripe of green on
the top is coming from the UL,

13
00:01:03.714 --> 00:01:09.347
which has a bit of margin associated with
it, at least on my Firefox browser here.

14
00:01:09.347 --> 00:01:12.908
It's sometimes it's got padding
associated with it instead, so

15
00:01:12.908 --> 00:01:15.206
we'll turn that off here in just a moment.

16
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:22.924
So we'll start here with header itself

17
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.910
And inside of the header HTML element,
then we can set up some padding like

18
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.033
one rim, just so we don't run
into the edges of our webpage.

19
00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:37.713
We can set our max width of 1200 pixels,

20
00:01:37.713 --> 00:01:41.565
which we've been doing with all
of the sections to this point.

21
00:01:41.565 --> 00:01:46.949
Now we're doing it with the header as
well, we also did it with the footer and

22
00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:50.413
then we can center this with margin,
zero auto.

23
00:01:50.413 --> 00:01:53.510
So that'll push this to
the center of the page, and

24
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.275
it will line up with all of our other
sections in the footer very, very nicely.

25
00:01:58.275 --> 00:02:03.955
So to show you that that's true, I don't
think we're gonna see a huge change here,

26
00:02:03.955 --> 00:02:08.610
so things sort of push over a little bit,
so that's how it looks now.

27
00:02:11.382 --> 00:02:14.081
All right,
then we're on our way to our navigation.

28
00:02:19.332 --> 00:02:21.616
And we're gonna do the universal stuff.

29
00:02:27.768 --> 00:02:29.340
Across the break points.

30
00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.044
And so
here what we're going to do is a Nav UL,

31
00:02:40.044 --> 00:02:43.328
turn off the bullets list style

32
00:02:47.053 --> 00:02:51.557
Type none, margin zero, padding zero,

33
00:02:51.557 --> 00:02:57.605
they really ought to just like
make a single property for

34
00:02:57.605 --> 00:03:01.861
all of this cuz you do this all the time.

35
00:03:01.861 --> 00:03:05.182
Anytime you're working with a list that
you don't wanna look like a bulleted list,

36
00:03:05.182 --> 00:03:06.979
these are the three
things you've got to do.

37
00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:15.617
Then let's continue on here, Nav UL.

38
00:03:19.705 --> 00:03:25.364
Display flex, flex flow,

39
00:03:25.364 --> 00:03:31.516
row wrap, justify content,

40
00:03:31.516 --> 00:03:34.715
space around,

41
00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:40.631
space around, there we go.

42
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:43.953
Space around, there we go,
all right, let's check in and

43
00:03:43.953 --> 00:03:45.623
see how that's going so far.

44
00:03:45.623 --> 00:03:51.041
So, if we just refresh this, immediately
what you'll have is you have the start

45
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:55.992
over navigation bar, just by putting
in that tiny little bit of Flexbox.

46
00:03:55.992 --> 00:03:59.927
We remove the bullets, so those are gone
by putting in a little bit of Flexbox,

47
00:03:59.927 --> 00:04:02.025
we made the navbar go horizontal across.

48
00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:06.195
Cross the page and
by using the space around or

49
00:04:06.195 --> 00:04:11.594
we could have used space
between that pushes everything.

50
00:04:11.594 --> 00:04:16.844
All these navigation items and
remember the logo is the navigation

51
00:04:16.844 --> 00:04:22.197
item pushes these all out evenly
here on the page, so not bad so far.

52
00:04:22.197 --> 00:04:28.157
If you wanted at this point in time you
could do things like the following.

53
00:04:28.157 --> 00:04:33.564
So we could say something
like Nav li first child,

54
00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:40.919
remember that that logo is the first
child there in the navigation.

55
00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.971
We could say margin, right, auto,

56
00:04:44.971 --> 00:04:49.948
so put the free space
over there on that side.

57
00:04:49.948 --> 00:04:54.979
And if we changed our
justify content to something

58
00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:01.698
like I don't know Flex end, okay,
what do you think that will do?

59
00:05:01.698 --> 00:05:06.871
If you have your logo, the first child,
and we have a margin on the right of auto.

60
00:05:06.871 --> 00:05:12.258
And we're going to justify our content to
the flex end, that should put the logo on

61
00:05:12.258 --> 00:05:17.667
the left and the navigation on the right,
correct, so let's take a look at that.

62
00:05:21.298 --> 00:05:24.082
Little bit of work to do on
those navigation items, but

63
00:05:24.082 --> 00:05:25.540
the shape is there, right?

64
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.826
We have the logo on the left,
we have the navigation on the right, so

65
00:05:28.826 --> 00:05:31.546
it's one of the cool things
that we can do with Flexbox.

66
00:05:31.546 --> 00:05:33.454
If that is something
you were looking to do,

67
00:05:33.454 --> 00:05:35.113
that would be very easy to do that way.

68
00:05:37.218 --> 00:05:42.018
Okay, but that is not what we're doing
here, okay let me just write a couple

69
00:05:42.018 --> 00:05:45.786
more styles here for
some generic styling for these links.

70
00:05:45.786 --> 00:05:48.395
And then I'm gonna go to the desktop and

71
00:05:48.395 --> 00:05:52.518
we'll continue on with the desktop
particular layout, so.

72
00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:59.411
But we have to style up our links first
here outside of the media queries So

73
00:05:59.411 --> 00:06:04.282
for the links themselves
text decoration of none.

74
00:06:06.515 --> 00:06:11.224
Always turn off your underlines and
the navigation,

75
00:06:11.224 --> 00:06:17.513
font size 1.2 rem looks a little small
make it a little bigger color of

76
00:06:24.488 --> 00:06:28.463
Bar, let's do color one, so

77
00:06:28.463 --> 00:06:33.392
we'll make them black by default and

78
00:06:33.392 --> 00:06:36.261
then display block.

79
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:41.133
Always display your links as block,
when you were inside of a navigation bar.

80
00:06:41.133 --> 00:06:44.355
And again,
this has to do with taking your link and

81
00:06:44.355 --> 00:06:48.519
pushing its edges all the way out,
to whatever clickable area.

82
00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:51.765
You're going to wind up having
inside of your navigation bar,

83
00:06:51.765 --> 00:06:54.103
this will help with
again fingers on mobile.

84
00:06:54.103 --> 00:06:56.264
It will help with people with issues and

85
00:06:56.264 --> 00:07:00.920
disabilities surrounding their mouse being
able to get to those particular items.

86
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.804
There's no downside to this, so

87
00:07:03.804 --> 00:07:08.851
set your navigation to display
block there for the links.

88
00:07:08.851 --> 00:07:13.891
We'll give it some padding, so
now I'm gonna go all the way down here,

89
00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:18.848
actually first, let me say this and
show you what it looks like so far.

90
00:07:18.848 --> 00:07:21.492
Okay, so we're gonna It looks like so far,

91
00:07:21.492 --> 00:07:25.856
we've kind of got it in the center of
the page, it's a little bit weird.

92
00:07:25.856 --> 00:07:27.005
There's some issues and

93
00:07:27.005 --> 00:07:29.965
things going on, we'll address
all of that here just a moment.

94
00:07:33.914 --> 00:07:39.098
Down here at the bottom at the desktop
media query, so 800 pixels and higher.

95
00:07:39.098 --> 00:07:44.458
Let's add some more stuff here, so
we wanna put the logo in the center.

96
00:07:44.458 --> 00:07:48.405
Navigation logo in the center so

97
00:07:48.405 --> 00:07:53.080
to do that we're gonna say our Nav UL,

98
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:59.968
I'm gonna say this again,
Justify, content, flex.

99
00:07:59.968 --> 00:08:03.752
And I think I just set it up on the mobile
side of it, but we'll eventually change

100
00:08:03.752 --> 00:08:07.104
that on the mobile, so I'm gonna
restate it down here on the desktop.

101
00:08:09.209 --> 00:08:12.351
Then I'm gonna say Nav li first child.

102
00:08:14.585 --> 00:08:17.164
Yes, you could do this
with a class instead but

103
00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:21.212
this is a very efficient selector and
we don't have to make any classes.

104
00:08:21.212 --> 00:08:24.633
It's the first child is the logo so
we're fine,

105
00:08:24.633 --> 00:08:27.645
we're going to say our flex basis is auto.

106
00:08:27.645 --> 00:08:32.298
We will wind up setting the flex basis
later on when we're at the tablet or

107
00:08:32.298 --> 00:08:33.913
the mobile dimensions.

108
00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:38.713
So we want to turn off that flex basis for
that for

109
00:08:38.713 --> 00:08:44.001
just the logo and
we'll set our margin to zero auto.

110
00:08:44.001 --> 00:08:49.090
So that'll center it and then we'll set

111
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:54.328
our order to two, so
then we have our Nav li

112
00:08:54.328 --> 00:08:59.789
nth-child, Two.

113
00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:08.445
And our Nav li nth child three,
these two elements,

114
00:09:08.445 --> 00:09:13.495
which again, you could do this
with a class if you'd like.

115
00:09:13.495 --> 00:09:18.912
We're going to say their order is one and

116
00:09:18.912 --> 00:09:27.045
then nav, we're just going to
copy that whole style again.

117
00:09:27.045 --> 00:09:34.030
So this will be number four and number
five, we'll set the order to be three,

118
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:40.494
so by doing this we've called out
our first two text navigation items.

119
00:09:40.494 --> 00:09:44.487
We've said that they're going to be
order one, we've called out our last two

120
00:09:44.487 --> 00:09:47.591
navigation items and
said they're going to be order three.

121
00:09:47.591 --> 00:09:50.940
And we set everything to do flex end but
yet

122
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:56.413
we told the logo we wanted in the middle
and we set our margin to auto.

123
00:09:56.413 --> 00:10:00.809
So what will wind up happening is that
our navigation will get pushed all

124
00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:03.972
the way out to the very
edges of the navigation bar.

125
00:10:03.972 --> 00:10:06.550
And the logo will show up there
very nicely, in the middle, so

126
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.949
let's see what that looks like.

127
00:10:14.057 --> 00:10:17.555
Just like that, right, so
there's collections and

128
00:10:17.555 --> 00:10:22.700
about then we have our world of wonder,
and then we have contact and donation.
