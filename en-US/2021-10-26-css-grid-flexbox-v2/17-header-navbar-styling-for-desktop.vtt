1
00:00:00.138 --> 00:00:02.712
Okay, so let's get this styling here.

2
00:00:02.712 --> 00:00:08.831
I'm gonna set this up just after
section UL here around line 52,

3
00:00:08.831 --> 00:00:16.389
let's go ahead and put on our header and
nav styles here, header and navs styles.

4
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.353
Okay,and we'll give ourselves
a little bit more room.

5
00:00:26.185 --> 00:00:27.754
There we go.

6
00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:34.289
Okay, so, we'll start with that header.

7
00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:39.334
The title class, and
let's assign its background- color,

8
00:00:39.334 --> 00:00:44.390
that's gonna be var colored number five,
the light yellow.

9
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.609
So, that'll give us a nice light yellow
bar across, outside of the web page.

10
00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.889
And if we refresh, you should
now see yellow there at the top.

11
00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:58.869
You'll also see a little bit of green
above that and some other things,

12
00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:00.200
one step at a time.

13
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.431
That strip of green on the top
is coming from the URL,

14
00:01:03.431 --> 00:01:08.501
which has a bit of margin associated with
it, at least on my Firefox browser here,

15
00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:12.269
is sometimes it's got padding
associated with it instead.

16
00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:14.682
So, we'll turn that off
here in just a moment.

17
00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:23.058
So, we'll start here
with the header itself.

18
00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.092
And inside of the header HTML element,
then we can set up some padding like one

19
00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:36.103
rem just so we don't run into the edges
of our web page, we can set our max width

20
00:01:36.103 --> 00:01:41.609
of 1200 pixels, which we've been doing
with all of the sections to this point.

21
00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.598
Now we're doing it with the header as
well, we also did it with the footer.

22
00:01:45.598 --> 00:01:50.439
And then we can center this with margin,
0 auto.

23
00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.455
So, that'll push this to
the center of the page and

24
00:01:53.455 --> 00:01:58.239
it will line up with all of our other
sections in the footer, very, very nicely.

25
00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:04.573
So, to show you that that's true, I don't
think we're gonna see a huge change here.

26
00:02:04.573 --> 00:02:08.750
So, things sort of push over a little bit,
so, that's how it looks now.

27
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:19.524
All right, then we're on our
way to our navigation And

28
00:02:19.524 --> 00:02:29.499
we're gonna do the universal
stuff Across the breakpoints.

29
00:02:35.313 --> 00:02:39.829
And so,
here we're going to do is a nav URL,

30
00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.259
turn off the bullets list style.

31
00:02:47.212 --> 00:02:48.141
Type.

32
00:02:49.284 --> 00:02:55.749
Non-margin 0 padding 0.

33
00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:59.245
They really ought to just
make a single property for

34
00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:01.940
all of this cuz you do this all the time.

35
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.319
Anytime you're working with a list that
you don't wanna look like a bulleted list,

36
00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.950
these are the three things you gotta do.

37
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.605
Then, let's continue on here.

38
00:03:13.605 --> 00:03:18.703
nav, url, dsplay,

39
00:03:18.703 --> 00:03:23.234
flex, flex flow,

40
00:03:23.234 --> 00:03:27.767
row wrap, justify

41
00:03:27.767 --> 00:03:33.445
content, space around

42
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.882
Space around, there we go.

43
00:03:42.882 --> 00:03:45.559
All right, lets check in and
see how that's going so far.

44
00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.464
So, if we just refresh this,

45
00:03:47.464 --> 00:03:52.745
immediately what you'll have is you'll
have this, start over navigation bar.

46
00:03:52.745 --> 00:03:57.297
Just by putting in that tiny little bit
of flexbox, we removed the bullets so

47
00:03:57.297 --> 00:04:00.440
those are gone by putting
in a little bit of flexbox.

48
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.222
We made the navbar go
horizontal across the page.

49
00:04:03.222 --> 00:04:08.736
And by using the space around, or
we could have used space between,

50
00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:13.306
that pushes everything,
all these navigation items.

51
00:04:13.306 --> 00:04:17.436
And remember the logo was the navigation
item pushes these all out

52
00:04:17.436 --> 00:04:19.023
evenly here on the page.

53
00:04:19.023 --> 00:04:22.255
So, not bad so far.

54
00:04:22.255 --> 00:04:28.300
If you wanted at this point in time,
you could do things like the following.

55
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:36.609
So, we could say something
like nav ul first child.

56
00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:40.830
Remember that logo is the first
child there in the navigation.

57
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.282
We could say margin, right, auto.

58
00:04:46.282 --> 00:04:49.769
So, put the free space
over there on that side.

59
00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:54.796
And if we changed our
justify content to something,

60
00:04:54.796 --> 00:04:57.776
I don't know flex end, okay?

61
00:04:57.776 --> 00:05:01.629
What do you think that will do?

62
00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:07.012
If you have your logo the first child, and
we have a margin on the right of auto,

63
00:05:07.012 --> 00:05:10.865
and we're going to justify
our content to the flex end.

64
00:05:10.865 --> 00:05:15.813
That should put the logo on the left and
the navigation on the right, correct?

65
00:05:15.813 --> 00:05:17.612
So, let's take a look at that.

66
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.309
Little bit of work to do on those
navigation items, but the shape is there,

67
00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:29.160
right, we have the logo on the left,
we have the navigation on the right.

68
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.619
So, it's one of the cool things
that we can do with Flexbox.

69
00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:37.271
If that is something you were looking to,
that would be very easy to do that way.

70
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:40.720
Okay, but
that's not what we're doing here.

71
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.994
Okay, let me just write a couple more
styles here for some generic styling for

72
00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:45.796
these links.

73
00:05:45.796 --> 00:05:48.261
And then I'm gonna go to the desktop and

74
00:05:48.261 --> 00:05:51.859
we'll continue on with
the desktop particular layout.

75
00:05:51.859 --> 00:05:56.999
So, but we have to style up our links
first here outside of the media queries.

76
00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:02.018
So, for the links themselves,
text decoration,

77
00:06:02.018 --> 00:06:09.853
text decoration of none, always turn
off your underlines and the navigation.

78
00:06:09.853 --> 00:06:14.214
Font size 1.2rem, it looks a little small,

79
00:06:14.214 --> 00:06:17.492
make it a little bigger, color of.

80
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.359
Bar.

81
00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:33.065
Let's do color 1, so,
we'll make them black by default.

82
00:06:33.065 --> 00:06:35.044
And then display block,

83
00:06:35.044 --> 00:06:41.085
always display your links as block when
you were inside of a navigation bar.

84
00:06:41.085 --> 00:06:44.109
And again,
this has to do with taking your link and

85
00:06:44.109 --> 00:06:48.721
pushing its edges all the way out to
whatever clickable area you're going to

86
00:06:48.721 --> 00:06:51.549
wind up having inside
of your navigation bar.

87
00:06:51.549 --> 00:06:54.103
This will help with
again fingers on mobile,

88
00:06:54.103 --> 00:06:56.051
it will help people with issues and

89
00:06:56.051 --> 00:07:00.840
disabilities surrounding their mouse being
able to get to those particular items.

90
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.459
There's no downside to this.

91
00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:08.879
So, set your navigation to display
block there for the links.

92
00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:10.801
We'll give it some padding.

93
00:07:10.801 --> 00:07:13.560
So, now I'm gonna go
all the way down here.

94
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.990
Actually, first, let me save this and
show you what it looks like so far.

95
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.130
Okay, so
this is what it looks like so far.

96
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.989
We've kinda got it in the center
of the page is a little bit weird.

97
00:07:25.989 --> 00:07:29.850
There's some issues and things going on,

98
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.040
we'll address all of
that here just a moment.

99
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:39.150
Down here at the bottom, at the desktop
media query, so 800 pixels and higher.

100
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.549
Let's add some more stuff here.

101
00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:46.331
So, we wanna put the logo in the center,

102
00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:50.139
navigation logo in the center.

103
00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:55.220
So to do that, we're gonna say our nav ul,
I'm gonna say this again,

104
00:07:55.220 --> 00:08:00.733
justify, content, flex and I think I
just set it up on the mobile side of it,

105
00:08:00.733 --> 00:08:04.379
but we'll eventually
change that on the mobile.

106
00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:09.349
So, I'm gonna restate it
down here on the desktop.

107
00:08:09.349 --> 00:08:14.680
Then I'm gonna say nav li, first child.

108
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.723
Yes, you could do this
with a class instead, but

109
00:08:17.723 --> 00:08:19.959
this is a very efficient selector.

110
00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:23.563
We don't have to make any classes,
it's the first child is the logo, so

111
00:08:23.563 --> 00:08:24.281
we're fine.

112
00:08:24.281 --> 00:08:29.213
We're gonna say our flexbasis is auto
we will wind up setting the flex

113
00:08:29.213 --> 00:08:33.989
basis later on when we're at the tablet or
the mobile dimensions.

114
00:08:33.989 --> 00:08:38.799
So, we wanna turn off that flex basis for
just the logo.

115
00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:43.920
And we'll set our margin to 0 auto.

116
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:50.992
So, that'll center it, and
then we'll set our order to 2,

117
00:08:50.992 --> 00:08:55.893
so then we have our nav, Li:nth-child,

118
00:08:59.218 --> 00:09:04.589
2 And

119
00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:09.636
our nav li nth child 3.

120
00:09:09.636 --> 00:09:13.595
These two elements, which again you can
do this with a class if you'd like.

121
00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:18.866
We're gonna say their order, is 1,

122
00:09:18.866 --> 00:09:26.959
then nav, we're just gonna
copy that whole style again.

123
00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:32.269
So, this will be number four and
number five,

124
00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:36.089
we'll set the order to be three.

125
00:09:36.089 --> 00:09:40.510
So by doing this, we've called out
our first two text navigation items,

126
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.309
we've said that they're
gonna be order one.

127
00:09:43.309 --> 00:09:45.945
We've called out our last
two navigation items and

128
00:09:45.945 --> 00:09:47.850
said they're gonna be order three.

129
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.181
And we set everything to do flex end,
but yet

130
00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:56.500
we told the logo we wanted in the middle,
and we set our margin to auto.

131
00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.610
So, what will wind up happening is that
our navigation will get pushed all

132
00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.660
the way out to the very edges
of the navigation bar, and

133
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.669
the logo will show up there
very nicely in the middle.

134
00:10:06.669 --> 00:10:08.268
So, let's see what that looks like.

135
00:10:14.057 --> 00:10:15.991
Just like that.

136
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:20.615
All right, so there's collections and
about then we have our world of wonder and

137
00:10:20.615 --> 00:10:22.730
then we have contact and donations.
