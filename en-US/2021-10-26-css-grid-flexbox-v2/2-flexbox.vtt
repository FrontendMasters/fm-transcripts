1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.930
So let's move on then to Flexbox and

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.910
talk a little bit more specifically about
what's going on in the world of Flexbox.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.799
Flexbox stands for
flexible boxes and the specification

4
00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.979
was defined actually around 2008, 2009.

5
00:00:18.979 --> 00:00:22.330
And they were never envisioned
of laying out whole web pages.

6
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.966
This is a theme that we have in CSS,
we have hacked our way through layouts for

7
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.440
so long.

8
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.522
The idea here with Flexbox was that
it would lay out parts of webpages

9
00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:38.080
that Flexbox was for UI,
as opposed to entire page layouts.

10
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.258
Flexbox is really good at vertical
centering and an equal heights, and

11
00:00:44.258 --> 00:00:48.420
it's really easy to reorder boxes,
which is a wonderful thing.

12
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.597
But the big disadvantage with Flexbox is
that it was never designed to be locked

13
00:00:52.597 --> 00:00:54.040
down for the layouts.

14
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.830
It's really a one
dimensional type of layout.

15
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.417
And it's very hard to understand exactly
what I'm talking about when I say one

16
00:01:01.417 --> 00:01:04.840
dimensional layout, but
I want you to think about rose.

17
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.616
And if you look at web pages today,
you can very much see that people

18
00:01:08.616 --> 00:01:12.879
are thinking about a row on the page,
maybe it has some things inside of it.

19
00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:15.741
Then we have another row on
the page with some other things,

20
00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:17.640
another row on the page, more things.

21
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.848
That is because Flexbox thinks
about itself in terms of rows,

22
00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:27.610
as opposed to thinking of itself in
two dimensions more like CSS grid.

23
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.842
A couple of pieces of terminology that
will be helpful to you the concept of

24
00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:36.227
the main axis, and the cross axis,
the flex item, and the flex container.

25
00:01:36.227 --> 00:01:40.988
I'm really not talking a lot about
flex containers and flex items, flex

26
00:01:40.988 --> 00:01:46.390
containers are parents, flex items are
children and this has to do with the HTML.

27
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.101
And the way the HTML is put together
we're gonna talk a lot, a lot,

28
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:52.298
a lot about it when we start doing code.

29
00:01:52.298 --> 00:01:57.575
Because whether an item is a parent or
whether it's a child would determine

30
00:01:57.575 --> 00:02:02.865
what CSS properties are available to
leverage in laying out your webpage.

31
00:02:02.865 --> 00:02:07.405
Flexbox of course can go in two
directions, so if you happen to have

32
00:02:07.405 --> 00:02:11.471
the setup for columns,
the main axis is the vertical axis.

33
00:02:11.471 --> 00:02:16.801
But if you set your Flexbox to rows
instead your main axis becomes

34
00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:22.338
the horizontal axis and
the cross axis becomes the vertical axis.

35
00:02:22.338 --> 00:02:25.496
I don't hear a lot of people
talking about main axis and

36
00:02:25.496 --> 00:02:30.176
cross axis when they talk about Flexbox
they mostly talk about rows and columns.

37
00:02:30.176 --> 00:02:34.646
Probably because main axis and cross axis
are terms that are a little bit confusing

38
00:02:34.646 --> 00:02:37.253
and change with the dimensions
of the webpage.

39
00:02:37.253 --> 00:02:41.617
So you'll hear me talk a lot about
horizontal or vertical, you'll hear

40
00:02:41.617 --> 00:02:46.424
me talk a lot about flex containers,
flex items, and parents, and children.

41
00:02:48.704 --> 00:02:53.678
So the three versions of Flexbox, they
started way back like I said in 2009, and

42
00:02:53.678 --> 00:02:56.970
we had a display property
the value of which was box, and

43
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.165
that would allow us to use
some Flexbox properties.

44
00:03:00.165 --> 00:03:04.785
As you know browsers rolled out much
more slowly back in those days and so

45
00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:08.414
we had older browsers that
were supporting the syntax.

46
00:03:08.414 --> 00:03:10.728
The W3C had something happen and

47
00:03:10.728 --> 00:03:15.608
everybody decided to redefine
everything having to do with Flexbox.

48
00:03:15.608 --> 00:03:20.158
So we came up with a new syntax
that rolled out in 2011 the only

49
00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:24.637
browser that ever supported
this so-called tweener syntax.

50
00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:27.306
The syntax that comes in between
the old and the new version,

51
00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:29.730
the current version that we use now.

52
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.601
The only browser that supported
that was IE 10 good times,

53
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:38.434
and so
in 2016 we finally had display flex.

54
00:03:38.434 --> 00:03:42.605
We had all the browsers that
are supporting it the browser's have been

55
00:03:42.605 --> 00:03:48.050
supporting it now for quite a while it's
a very safe type of technology to use.

56
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.373
Now as always, the only time you need to
be concerned about this is with IE support

57
00:03:53.373 --> 00:03:58.630
at this moment in time, because of
course IE is no longer being updated.

58
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.387
I hope you don't have to
support IE anymore, but

59
00:04:01.387 --> 00:04:06.161
I am aware that there are people mostly
working at universities, or in government,

60
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:09.300
who may still have to
support that browser.

61
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.749
All of the other modern ones that
roll out on a regular basis Safari,

62
00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:18.370
Firefox, Chrome, and Edge,
all of them support Flexbox just fine.

63
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.000
They're some games you might be aware
of that have been out for some time.

64
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.496
Feel free to play these,
on your own Flexbox froggy and

65
00:04:28.496 --> 00:04:30.858
Flexbox defense, we'll focus on.

66
00:04:30.858 --> 00:04:34.544
Really the syntax of how
to get Flexbox to work, but

67
00:04:34.544 --> 00:04:39.010
it doesn't really teach you
the thought behind Flexbox.

68
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.234
And so I'm gonna spend more time on how to
think about a Flexbox problem rather than

69
00:04:44.234 --> 00:04:49.171
on all of the various syntax, so these
are games that you can play on your own.

70
00:04:49.171 --> 00:04:52.531
There's a ton of properties
that are available,

71
00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:57.500
you may want to print out some information
like this I have here on slide.

72
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.767
I think I have a separate text file
that you can refer to for that or

73
00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:04.200
just take a look at CSS tricks.

74
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.510
They have a great page that describes all
of the properties and values for Flexbox.
