WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.056
All right, so we're on to then
the mobile portion of the navigation and

2
00:00:04.056 --> 00:00:07.512
remember I said we were just
going to set these up as buttons.

3
00:00:07.512 --> 00:00:12.069
I know the default these days is really to
always set your navigation as a hamburger

4
00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:12.606
button.

5
00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:16.399
There's nothing wrong with that you can
definitely do a hamburger button and

6
00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:19.156
I have covered that in
the advanced CSS layouts course.

7
00:00:19.156 --> 00:00:20.950
If you want to check that out and

8
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.864
how you can make a hamburger button with
just CSS without involving any JavaScript.

9
00:00:25.864 --> 00:00:29.788
But for today, let's make it with buttons
because this is a layouts course.

10
00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:33.634
And we can lay out some buttons here,
we don't have that many navigation items.

11
00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:38.139
And they're kind of fun, they add a little
bit of extra color to the mobile display.

12
00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:43.123
Just scrolling up a little bit here
I have I have two nav UL declarations

13
00:00:43.123 --> 00:00:47.196
here I think I did this because
this nav UL this part of it.

14
00:00:47.196 --> 00:00:53.773
Is kind of something that we always do and
then this is the Flexbox portion of it.

15
00:00:53.773 --> 00:00:57.973
Absolutely you can combine these into a
single style there's no particular reason

16
00:00:57.973 --> 00:00:59.662
to declare the same thing twice.

17
00:00:59.662 --> 00:01:06.764
So there we go we haven't have one style
with all of these elements in place.

18
00:01:06.764 --> 00:01:10.539
And then we'll go on to our our nav LI, so

19
00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:15.773
nav LI these are just sort of
in general for all of our LI.

20
00:01:15.773 --> 00:01:20.218
I'm going to have two buttons per line so

21
00:01:20.218 --> 00:01:24.402
we'll set our flex basis to 48% and

22
00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:29.254
we'll set our margin bottom to 0.5 rem.

23
00:01:29.254 --> 00:01:33.885
That'll give us a little bit of space in
between our buttons, there at the bottom.

24
00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:40.457
Okay, so
let's check what we've got here so far.

25
00:01:40.457 --> 00:01:44.152
And I'm gonna scrunch up the screen
a little bit more to get us to the mobile

26
00:01:44.152 --> 00:01:44.995
kind of layout.

27
00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:48.649
So there we are, you can see that
we have our logo on its own line,

28
00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.693
which we definitely want here too.

29
00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:56.675
And we have all of our various
hamburger button navigation items here.

30
00:01:56.675 --> 00:02:01.785
Okay, so
let's start to turn things red with

31
00:02:01.785 --> 00:02:06.895
white text, so to do that, we'll add here,

32
00:02:06.895 --> 00:02:11.979
on our nav a So

33
00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:16.297
I initially set this to be color one,

34
00:02:16.297 --> 00:02:20.893
I'm gonna change that now to white, so

35
00:02:20.893 --> 00:02:27.322
we have white text and
I'll set our background color.

36
00:02:27.322 --> 00:02:32.747
To think it's color ten, nice red so

37
00:02:32.747 --> 00:02:40.633
a nice red button with a white
text on top of it, okay.

38
00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:46.022
So then to this will also add
some padding of 0.5 rem and

39
00:02:46.022 --> 00:02:48.730
we'll add a border radius.

40
00:02:51.432 --> 00:02:56.345
Of five pixels, this will match the other
in the collections portion of the webpage

41
00:02:56.345 --> 00:02:57.691
where we had borders.

42
00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:00.457
We had a five pixel radius there and so

43
00:03:00.457 --> 00:03:04.751
we're going to add it here as
well to keep it consistent.

44
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:08.467
One of the signs of an amateur designer
is to have slightly different curves all

45
00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:09.379
over the webpage.

46
00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.413
So try to keep them consistent if
you're gonna make use of them.

47
00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:21.050
And then finally text,
align, center, okay.

48
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.637
Let's see what that looks like.

49
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.152
So great, we have red backgrounds for
all of our buttons, right?

50
00:03:32.152 --> 00:03:33.894
Exactly what we wanted but

51
00:03:33.894 --> 00:03:39.209
it's also given us a red background on
our SVG which is transparent by default.

52
00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.782
So now it's time to override that And

53
00:03:45.782 --> 00:03:52.798
so here We can say our
nav li first child a,

54
00:03:52.798 --> 00:04:00.628
will have a background
color of transparent.

55
00:04:00.628 --> 00:04:07.520
And that'll fix that problem
very very nicely much better.

56
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.404
Okay, then we want a hover state for
these.

57
00:04:15.778 --> 00:04:20.243
And so nav a:hover,

58
00:04:20.243 --> 00:04:25.208
background color of var

59
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.492
Color one So

60
00:04:32.492 --> 00:04:39.310
they'll give us our black and
a color var color five,

61
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.471
so yellow text on our black background.

62
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:45.972
So let's test that.

63
00:04:50.805 --> 00:04:53.982
So now when I mouse over with buttons,
those all look.

64
00:04:53.982 --> 00:04:59.843
Nice big contrast the changes and so forth
when I mouse over the wall of wonder here,

65
00:04:59.843 --> 00:05:03.375
we do not get that same hover effect,
why is that?

66
00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:08.544
Well, it has to do with specificity,
believe it or not right here on

67
00:05:08.544 --> 00:05:14.641
line 100 notice it says nav li first child
a and that is a more specific style.

68
00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:17.385
It contains a pseudo class in it,

69
00:05:17.385 --> 00:05:22.488
the first child plus the a then
the nav a:hover declaration.

70
00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:25.229
And since we are talking
about the a stage,

71
00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.119
this is actually overwriting the a state
for all of the states have the link.

72
00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:33.554
Link visited focus hover active and so

73
00:05:33.554 --> 00:05:38.607
when we try the more generic
nav a:hover over our logo.

74
00:05:38.607 --> 00:05:42.691
It's actually overridden by this
transparent declaration that comes

75
00:05:42.691 --> 00:05:44.740
slightly earlier, which is fine.

76
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.366
We really don't want to have a black cover
on our logo anyway so it's kinda magic.

77
00:05:49.366 --> 00:05:55.013
But that is the cascade and
effect there cascade and specificity.

78
00:05:55.013 --> 00:05:59.978
All right, so I think we've got our whole
nav bar together at that point then, so

79
00:05:59.978 --> 00:06:03.569
we have a nav bar that changes
radically over the website.

80
00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:08.357
Here we are a desktop logo in
the middle navigation spaced

81
00:06:08.357 --> 00:06:12.458
evenly on either side as
we start to pull this in.

82
00:06:12.458 --> 00:06:15.553
At some point here,
we want to do the break and

83
00:06:15.553 --> 00:06:17.920
our text wraps on to the next line.

84
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.327
And then, when we push this
closer a little bit more,

85
00:06:21.327 --> 00:06:23.839
we wind up with buttons here on mobile.

86
00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:26.550
And those are fully
clickable mobile areas and

87
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.825
notice that when you hover
over the edges of the button.

88
00:06:29.825 --> 00:06:34.865
It not only changes the hover state but
we also still have a clickable area,

89
00:06:34.865 --> 00:06:38.147
that's because we put
that display block on ra.

90
00:06:38.147 --> 00:06:42.581
Really important for
making good usable links on mobile,

91
00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:46.116
okay.Any questions on headers and
nav bars?

92
00:06:46.116 --> 00:06:49.943
&gt;&gt; On hover on mobile those
states wouldn't be seen or

93
00:06:49.943 --> 00:06:53.508
seen quickly before moving
to the linked page.

94
00:06:53.508 --> 00:06:57.227
Is there a way for
the hover to be seen utilized on mobile?

95
00:06:57.227 --> 00:07:00.262
With touch interaction you're not
really going gonna see hover?

96
00:07:00.262 --> 00:07:05.004
&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, absolutely true
on with a touch device of course

97
00:07:05.004 --> 00:07:07.605
there is no hover state on mobile.

98
00:07:07.605 --> 00:07:10.488
And so that's just the way it is and but

99
00:07:10.488 --> 00:07:13.925
you can put in the hover
state here on mobile.

100
00:07:13.925 --> 00:07:18.301
People may have, for example,
I was using an apple pencil earlier.

101
00:07:18.301 --> 00:07:22.587
Maybe you have that kind of device
a stylus device with a small screen,

102
00:07:22.587 --> 00:07:25.431
which might allow you to
do some kind of hover.

103
00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:28.343
It's still on those devices but
if you can't see it,

104
00:07:28.343 --> 00:07:32.044
it's one of those wonderful graceful
degradation kind of things.

105
00:07:32.044 --> 00:07:36.120
You don't have to see the hover state
in order for those buttons to work but

106
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.752
I'm sorry, there's no way that
you can hover with your finger.

107
00:07:39.752 --> 00:07:43.002
You are absolutely right and
we don't have a CSS state for

108
00:07:43.002 --> 00:07:45.380
an equivalent type of effects for touch.
