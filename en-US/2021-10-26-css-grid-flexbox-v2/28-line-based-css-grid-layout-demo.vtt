1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.770
So let's take a look at our first example.

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.789
We're gonna look at a painting
by Piet Mondrian and

3
00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:09.690
we are going to code it with CSS Grid.

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.390
So Piet Mondrian was
a painter in the 1930s.

5
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.960
You are probably familiar with his work.

6
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.870
It's very popular.

7
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.351
Here's Yves St Laurent, who turned
it into dresses in the 1960s but

8
00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:22.790
it was originally a painting.

9
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.650
So let's take a look at that now.

10
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.100
Now, obviously laying out a painting
is a pretty limited type of exercise.

11
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.698
We're just gonna work with
big squares of color and

12
00:00:33.698 --> 00:00:37.052
lay them out here on this
web page accordingly.

13
00:00:37.052 --> 00:00:41.171
And we're going to wind up using
some absolute measurement.

14
00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:44.910
We're gonna work with a lot of
pixels in this particular design.

15
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.375
I find that students like this exercise as
an introduction to Grid because everything

16
00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:51.678
is very clear, and concise, and compact.

17
00:00:51.678 --> 00:00:55.030
And we know exactly what
it is that we're building.

18
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.230
And so this is a great way to
start getting familiar with

19
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.165
the thinking that goes into CSS Grid.

20
00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:06.342
Our HTML is very simple, we just have
a series of divs here because we have

21
00:01:06.342 --> 00:01:09.432
absolutely no meaning in
this document whatsoever.

22
00:01:09.432 --> 00:01:12.910
There's no need to use any
type of more interesting HTML.

23
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.190
So we have a div with a class of wrapper.

24
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.300
Inside of that we have seven divs.

25
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.042
And they have letters that
are associated with them.

26
00:01:22.042 --> 00:01:24.754
And that's pretty easy HTML to remember.

27
00:01:24.754 --> 00:01:29.354
So I'm just going to make my CSS window
here a little bit bigger inside of

28
00:01:29.354 --> 00:01:30.284
our code pin.

29
00:01:30.284 --> 00:01:34.550
Once again, those are available
from the course website.

30
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.199
If you take a look at
the Mondrian painting exercises,

31
00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:39.740
there's a link to the code
pen right from that page.

32
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.008
Inside of this you'll see that I've
given you a little bit of starting code.

33
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:49.026
Here's our wrapper, I set a width and
a height on it because, again,

34
00:01:49.026 --> 00:01:52.928
this is a painting, we want it to
look in a very specific kind of way.

35
00:01:52.928 --> 00:01:56.443
In the real world,
I would not recommend setting a width and

36
00:01:56.443 --> 00:02:00.110
a height necessarily on your grid,
definitely not a height.

37
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.431
Width, maybe, maybe not.

38
00:02:01.431 --> 00:02:03.822
And I've given this
background image to use.

39
00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:07.480
So this is the painting that
we are going to be coding.

40
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.163
And I've put in letters for all of the
cells that we're going to be working with.

41
00:02:12.163 --> 00:02:17.012
So you can see exactly where we want all
of these boxes to wind up happening.

42
00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:22.121
So the little letters that you see on
the top here in the rows, that's our code.

43
00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:26.273
And then the bigger boxes that
are behind this, that is the painting.

44
00:02:26.273 --> 00:02:31.112
As you see here I've given you a little
bit of starting code in the divs.

45
00:02:31.112 --> 00:02:35.103
Every div has got a border on it,
color of white and

46
00:02:35.103 --> 00:02:39.191
50% opacity so
that we can see both ourselves and

47
00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:43.389
the painting behind along
with sort of a basic font.

48
00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.562
So let's go ahead and
get started with this.

49
00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:51.535
And as I told you, the syntax we wanna
think about is grid-row and grid-column.

50
00:02:51.535 --> 00:02:53.243
We're gonna specify this for

51
00:02:53.243 --> 00:02:56.734
each one of these cells inside
of this particular exercise.

52
00:02:56.734 --> 00:02:59.044
So let's start with letter a.

53
00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:05.738
What is going to be our grid-row and
our grid-column values here for letter a?

54
00:03:08.408 --> 00:03:11.842
Well, probably the best place to start
is to think about how many rows and

55
00:03:11.842 --> 00:03:15.220
how many columns we're gonna
work with in the first place.

56
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.650
So if we look at the painting here.

57
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.001
You'll see that we have one
row here with letter a,

58
00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:25.867
one row here with letter b.

59
00:03:25.867 --> 00:03:29.387
And then down here at the bottom,
we've actually got two more rows, one for

60
00:03:29.387 --> 00:03:30.880
letter f and one for letter g.

61
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.220
So we have four rows, and
then how many columns do we have?

62
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.830
It looks like three columns going across.

63
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.650
So three columns, four rows.

64
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.422
So for letter a then, how many columns and
how many rows is it going to take up?

65
00:03:47.422 --> 00:03:54.552
It's gonna occupy probably one column and
it's gonna occupy one row.

66
00:03:54.552 --> 00:03:55.435
Which one?

67
00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:56.467
Now we have to count.

68
00:03:56.467 --> 00:04:00.805
So from here we start, remember
that our first line is just outside

69
00:04:00.805 --> 00:04:04.143
of the drawing here, so
there's line number one.

70
00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:07.090
Line number two is going to be
this one here between a and c.

71
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.474
Line number three is gonna be
way over here between e and f.

72
00:04:12.474 --> 00:04:15.816
And line number four is all
the way on the outside.

73
00:04:15.816 --> 00:04:20.639
Likewise in the rows we have our first
line up here before the painting starts,

74
00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.510
that's line one.

75
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:29.574
Line two is between a and b, and
line three is going to be between b and d.

76
00:04:29.574 --> 00:04:33.024
Line four is outside of the painting.

77
00:04:33.024 --> 00:04:35.771
So for letter a,
what is our position here for this?

78
00:04:39.403 --> 00:04:43.820
We're gonna have a grid-row of 1/2, right?

79
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.102
We're gonna have it go from 1 to 2 and

80
00:04:47.102 --> 00:04:52.551
we're gonna have our grid-column
going from 1 to 2 as well.

81
00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:57.440
And I forgot to do something.

82
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.451
Did anyone catch?

83
00:05:00.603 --> 00:05:03.804
I've started to declare what the children
are going to do without declaring what

84
00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:05.880
the parent needs to do, haven't eye?

85
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.013
All right, so let's go back and
put that in place.

86
00:05:09.013 --> 00:05:14.473
Here on this outside div on the wrapper
itself, let's go ahead and add to this,

87
00:05:14.473 --> 00:05:19.066
display, grid.

88
00:05:21.053 --> 00:05:22.050
There we go.

89
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.040
And we're just gonna leave it at that for
the moment.

90
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.745
We can specify a grid-gap if you want.

91
00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.595
Grid-gap, oops, sorry, gap.

92
00:05:30.595 --> 00:05:34.780
I have to remember that the new
syntax is just plain gap so

93
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.800
hopefully I won't make that
mistake too many times.

94
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.720
It's just plain gap, no longer grid-gap.

95
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.655
And the values here can be 30 pixels,
20 pixels.

96
00:05:46.655 --> 00:05:49.291
And so that'll give us some
space both horizontally and

97
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:52.616
vertically once we start to specify
all of the rest of our values here.

98
00:05:56.217 --> 00:05:58.589
Now, we haven't told
Grid how many columns and

99
00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:00.973
how many rows we're
ultimately going to have.

100
00:06:00.973 --> 00:06:04.578
So Grid's doing the best it can
with the information it has.

101
00:06:04.578 --> 00:06:09.353
Which is it's just going to drop one cell
at basically all in a column just like

102
00:06:09.353 --> 00:06:14.840
this by default, until we start specifying
where all of our individual cells go.

103
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.790
So it's totally right here with a.

104
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.830
It's going from row one to two,
exactly as we'd expect,

105
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.190
and Grid doesn't know that we
have more columns in mind.

106
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.580
So it stretched this all
the way across the painting.

107
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.068
Let's go to letter b here then.

108
00:06:32.068 --> 00:06:36.397
What are gonna be our values here for
grid-row and grid-column?

109
00:06:36.397 --> 00:06:37.744
&gt;&gt; 1/2.
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

110
00:06:37.744 --> 00:06:38.797
&gt;&gt; 1/3.

111
00:06:38.797 --> 00:06:45.467
&gt;&gt; 1/2 and 1/3, okay?

112
00:06:45.467 --> 00:06:47.832
So 1/2 for which one?

113
00:06:47.832 --> 00:06:49.500
The row or the column?

114
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.555
&gt;&gt; Row.

115
00:06:50.555 --> 00:06:52.029
&gt;&gt; Row 1/2.

116
00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:54.850
And the column would be 1/3?

117
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.210
&gt;&gt; There's a few people saying 2/3.

118
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.734
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
take a look at what's happening here.

119
00:07:04.734 --> 00:07:09.781
We set our grid-row, look at a and
b, grid-row is exactly the same and

120
00:07:09.781 --> 00:07:13.331
check out what's happening
here in our display.

121
00:07:13.331 --> 00:07:18.218
So this is one of the really
important grid properties that is not

122
00:07:18.218 --> 00:07:22.482
true of Flexbox,
grid cells can occupy the same space.

123
00:07:22.482 --> 00:07:25.932
So here, based on what we've
said in the chat, we have a and

124
00:07:25.932 --> 00:07:27.934
b occupying exactly the same row.

125
00:07:27.934 --> 00:07:34.130
And they are in fact occupying the same
row, they are on top of each other.

126
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.532
This is a very cool effect, we're gonna
talk a lot more about it later, but

127
00:07:37.532 --> 00:07:38.833
it's not what we want here.

128
00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:42.767
So what would be a better value than for
grid-row, okay?

129
00:07:42.767 --> 00:07:43.797
&gt;&gt; 2/3.

130
00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:46.273
&gt;&gt; 2/3, all right.

131
00:07:46.273 --> 00:07:48.965
2/3, there we go.

132
00:07:48.965 --> 00:07:53.847
So yeah, now that's going to move
this down a little bit more, okay?

133
00:07:53.847 --> 00:07:55.339
And then how about the column?

134
00:07:55.339 --> 00:07:58.960
So here we said 1/3,
it's doing exactly what you'd expect.

135
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.632
It's in our second row.

136
00:08:02.632 --> 00:08:08.230
But now it's pushing across two columns
and c moved up here to the top.

137
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.662
And that's actually what you would expect,

138
00:08:10.662 --> 00:08:14.770
c is going to try to occupy the space
that b might have otherwise left behind.

139
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.530
That is the way grid is going to work.

140
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.979
So c pops on up here, but that's not
exactly the layout that we're looking for.

141
00:08:21.979 --> 00:08:27.555
So what would be a better value for
grid-column for letter b?

142
00:08:27.555 --> 00:08:28.419
&gt;&gt; 2/3.

143
00:08:28.419 --> 00:08:30.542
&gt;&gt; 2/3, Okay?

144
00:08:30.542 --> 00:08:32.444
So we said to 2/3, okay.

145
00:08:32.444 --> 00:08:37.830
So when a is now here
in the upper left but

146
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:42.399
b is down here in the lower right,

147
00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:47.500
remember this is two and three.

148
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.675
We actually want b to show up over
here starting at line number one,

149
00:08:51.675 --> 00:08:53.440
going to line number two.

150
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.500
So let's change that to 1/2.

151
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.490
All right, so we are back now to what grid
thinks is a single column and that's okay.

152
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.120
Because when we put in letter c,

153
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.712
grid will know that we actually have
more than one column working here.

154
00:09:08.712 --> 00:09:12.914
We have a and b in the same column but
they are in different rows.

155
00:09:12.914 --> 00:09:18.989
All right, so here for letter c then, And

156
00:09:18.989 --> 00:09:22.170
a grid-column, okay?

157
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.370
So now we have letter
c as you can see here,

158
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.480
it is spanning across
some particular area.

159
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:35.770
So it's definitely going from line
one to line two to line three.

160
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.530
That's our rows.

161
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:42.074
Okay, so
our grid-row here is going to be 1/3.

162
00:09:46.237 --> 00:09:51.866
Nice, and then it automatically
fills in the space that's over here.

163
00:09:51.866 --> 00:09:54.825
So now grid knows that we
have two columns, kind of.

164
00:09:54.825 --> 00:09:59.485
So it's going ahead and drawing
that in this particular space here.

165
00:09:59.485 --> 00:10:01.180
Our grid-column though,

166
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:06.201
anybody wanna take a suggestion as to
what our numbers are for our grid-column?

167
00:10:06.201 --> 00:10:07.741
&gt;&gt; 1/2.

168
00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:11.774
&gt;&gt; 1/2 for the column.

169
00:10:11.774 --> 00:10:15.032
Remember, we start here,
here's line one for our column.

170
00:10:15.032 --> 00:10:17.529
Here's line two.

171
00:10:17.529 --> 00:10:19.536
We actually want it over here, don't we?

172
00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:20.898
Any other suggestions?

173
00:10:27.318 --> 00:10:28.107
So.

174
00:10:28.107 --> 00:10:32.566
&gt;&gt; 2/4.
&gt;&gt; 2/4, that's correct because we're gonna

175
00:10:32.566 --> 00:10:37.535
go from two,
remember we're gonna have a line here.

176
00:10:37.535 --> 00:10:42.639
It's this part down here between e and
f, that's line three,

177
00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:46.410
and then line four is
outside of the painting.
