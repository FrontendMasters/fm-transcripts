1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.760
So, let's take a look
at our first example.

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.802
We're gonna look at a painting
by Piet Mondrian and

3
00:00:06.802 --> 00:00:09.532
we are gonna code it with CSS grid.

4
00:00:09.532 --> 00:00:11.923
So Piet Mondrian was
a painter in the 1930s,

5
00:00:11.923 --> 00:00:15.038
you are probably familiar with his work,
it's very popular.

6
00:00:15.038 --> 00:00:19.865
Here's you've St. Laurent,
who turned it into dresses in the 1960s,

7
00:00:19.865 --> 00:00:22.026
but it was originally a painting.

8
00:00:22.026 --> 00:00:24.578
So let's take a look at that now.

9
00:00:24.578 --> 00:00:29.498
Now obviously laying out a painting
is a pretty limited type of exercise

10
00:00:29.498 --> 00:00:33.024
we're just gonna work with
big squares of color and

11
00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:37.080
lay them out here on this
web page accordingly.

12
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.201
And we're going to wind up using some
absolute measures of measurement,

13
00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:44.861
we're gonna work with a lot of
pixels in this particular design.

14
00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:49.492
I find that students like this exercise is
an introduction to grid because everything

15
00:00:49.492 --> 00:00:51.680
is very clear and concise and compact and

16
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.020
we know exactly what it
is that we're building.

17
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.598
And, so this is a great way to start
getting familiar with the thinking that

18
00:00:59.598 --> 00:01:00.843
goes into CSS grid.

19
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.310
Or HTML is very simple, we just have
a series of divs here because we have

20
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.190
absolutely no meaning in
this document whatsoever,

21
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.900
there's no need to use any
type of more interesting HTML.

22
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.488
So we have a div with a class of wrapper,
inside of that we have seven divs and

23
00:01:18.488 --> 00:01:22.238
they have letters that
are associated with them.

24
00:01:22.238 --> 00:01:25.171
And that's pretty easy HTML to remember,
so

25
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:29.029
I'm just gonna make my CSS
window here a little bit bigger,

26
00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:34.299
inside of our code pin, once again those
are available from the course website.

27
00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.932
If you take a look at the Mondrian
painting exercises there's a link to

28
00:01:37.932 --> 00:01:39.730
the code pen right from that page.

29
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.780
Inside of this you'll see that I've
given you a little bit of starting code,

30
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.438
here's our wrapper I set a width and
a height on it because again this is

31
00:01:48.438 --> 00:01:51.416
a painting we wanna to look in
a very specific kind of way.

32
00:01:51.416 --> 00:01:55.764
In the real world I would not
recommend setting a width and

33
00:01:55.764 --> 00:02:01.580
a height necessarily on your grid
definitely not a height, with maybe not.

34
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.222
And I've given this
background image to use, so

35
00:02:04.222 --> 00:02:07.470
this is the painting that
we are gonna be coding.

36
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.354
And I've put in letters for all of the
cells that we're gonna be working with,

37
00:02:12.354 --> 00:02:17.026
so you can see exactly where we want all
of these boxes to wind up happening.

38
00:02:17.026 --> 00:02:21.515
So, the little letters that you
see on the top here in the rows,

39
00:02:21.515 --> 00:02:27.381
that's our code and then the bigger boxes
that are behind us that is the painting.

40
00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:31.919
You see here I've given you a little
bit of starting code in the divs,

41
00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:36.468
every div has got a border on it,
a color of white and 50% opacity.

42
00:02:36.468 --> 00:02:40.832
So that we can see both ourselves and
the painting behind,

43
00:02:40.832 --> 00:02:43.247
along with sort of a basic font.

44
00:02:43.247 --> 00:02:46.351
So let's go ahead and
get started with this.

45
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:51.442
And as I told you, the syntax we wanna
think about is grid row and grid column.

46
00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:55.138
We're gonna specify this for
each one of these cells inside of this

47
00:02:55.138 --> 00:02:58.182
particular exercise, so
let's start with letter a.

48
00:02:59.853 --> 00:03:05.900
What is gonna be our grid row and
our grid column values here for letter a?

49
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.931
Well, probably the best place to start
is to think about how many rows and

50
00:03:11.931 --> 00:03:15.230
how many columns we're gonna
work with in the first place.

51
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.410
So we look at the painting here,
you'll see that,

52
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.480
we have one row here with letter a,
one row here with letter b.

53
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.865
And then down here at the bottom,
we've actually got two more rows, one for

54
00:03:29.865 --> 00:03:33.410
letter f and one for letter g,
so we have four rows.

55
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.820
And then how many columns do we have,
it looks like three columns going across.

56
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.630
So three columns, four rows.

57
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.860
So for letter a then, how many columns and
how many rows is it gonna take up?

58
00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:54.268
It's gonna occupy probably one column and
it's gonna occupy one row.

59
00:03:54.268 --> 00:03:56.971
Which one, now we have to count.

60
00:03:56.971 --> 00:04:01.470
So from here, we start remember that our
first line is just outside of the drawing

61
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.532
here, so there's line number one.

62
00:04:03.532 --> 00:04:07.822
Line number two is gonna be
this one here between a and c,

63
00:04:07.822 --> 00:04:12.313
line number three is gonna be
way over here between e and f.

64
00:04:12.313 --> 00:04:17.283
And line number four is all the way on
the outside, likewise in the rows we

65
00:04:17.283 --> 00:04:22.276
have our first line up here before
the painting starts that's line one.

66
00:04:22.276 --> 00:04:28.090
Line two is between a and b And
line three is gonna be between b and

67
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.066
d, line four is outside of the painting So

68
00:04:33.066 --> 00:04:36.577
for letter a what is our position here for
this?

69
00:04:39.097 --> 00:04:43.810
We're gonna have a grid row,
of one slash two, right.

70
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.728
We're gonna have it go from one to two.

71
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.685
And we're gonna have our grid column
going from one to two as well.

72
00:04:55.904 --> 00:04:58.420
And I forgot to do something,
did anyone catch?

73
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:03.767
I've started to declare what the children
are gonna do without declaring

74
00:05:03.767 --> 00:05:05.767
what the parent is needs to do,
have an eye.

75
00:05:05.767 --> 00:05:07.730
Alright, so let's go back and

76
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.290
put that in place here on this
outside div on the wrapper itself.

77
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:18.034
Let's go ahead and
add to this display, Grid.

78
00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:22.568
Here we go.

79
00:05:22.568 --> 00:05:26.157
And we're just gonna leave it at that for
the moment.

80
00:05:26.157 --> 00:05:29.728
We can specify a grid gap if you want,
grid gap.

81
00:05:29.728 --> 00:05:35.040
Oops sorry, gap I have to remember that
the new syntax is just playing gaps so

82
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.780
hopefully I won't make that
mistake too many times.

83
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.641
It's just playing gap,
no longer grid gap and

84
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:46.605
the values here can be
30 pixels 20 pixels.

85
00:05:46.605 --> 00:05:49.547
And so that'll give us some
space both horizontally and

86
00:05:49.547 --> 00:05:53.248
vertically once we start to specify
all of the rest of our values here.

87
00:05:55.952 --> 00:05:58.183
Now we haven't told grid
how many columns and

88
00:05:58.183 --> 00:06:00.890
how many rows we're ultimately gonna have.

89
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.886
So grids doing the best it can with
the information it has, which it's just

90
00:06:05.886 --> 00:06:10.657
gonna drop one cell basically all in
a column just like this by default.

91
00:06:10.657 --> 00:06:15.404
Until we start specifying where
all of our individual cells go, so

92
00:06:15.404 --> 00:06:20.336
it's totally right here with a it's
going from row to row one to two.

93
00:06:20.336 --> 00:06:24.816
Exactly as we'd expect and grid doesn't
know that we have more columns in mind, so

94
00:06:24.816 --> 00:06:27.570
it stretched this all
the way across the painting.

95
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.018
Let's go to letter b here then,

96
00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:37.506
what are gonna be our values here for

97
00:06:37.506 --> 00:06:40.806
grid row and grid column?

98
00:06:40.806 --> 00:06:42.201
&gt;&gt; 1/2,1/3.

99
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:45.312
&gt;&gt; 1/2 and 1/3, okay?

100
00:06:45.312 --> 00:06:49.233
So, 1/2 for which one,
the row or the column?

101
00:06:49.233 --> 00:06:50.119
&gt;&gt; Row.

102
00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:56.513
&gt;&gt; Row, 1/2 and the column would be 1/3.

103
00:06:56.513 --> 00:07:00.807
&gt;&gt; There's a few people saying 2/3.

104
00:07:00.807 --> 00:07:06.091
&gt;&gt; Okay, so look at take a look at what's
happening here we set our grid row,

105
00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:09.245
look at a and
b grid row is exactly the same and

106
00:07:09.245 --> 00:07:12.850
check out what's happening
here in our display.

107
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.849
So, this is one of the really
important grid properties that is not

108
00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:22.280
true of Flexbox,
grid cells can occupy the same space.

109
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.840
So here,
based on what we've said in the chat,

110
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.321
we have a and
b occupying exactly the same row.

111
00:07:29.321 --> 00:07:33.010
And they are in fact occupying the same
row, they are on top of each other.

112
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.554
This is a very cool effect we're gonna
talk a lot more about it later, but

113
00:07:37.554 --> 00:07:38.990
it's not what we want here.

114
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.610
So, what would be a better value than for
grid row, okay,

115
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:43.644
&gt;&gt; 2/3.

116
00:07:43.644 --> 00:07:46.070
&gt;&gt; 2/3 all right.

117
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.722
2/3, there we go.

118
00:07:48.722 --> 00:07:53.148
So yeah now that's gonna move this
down a little bit more, okay and

119
00:07:53.148 --> 00:07:54.977
then how about the column.

120
00:07:54.977 --> 00:08:02.325
So here we said 1/2 it's doing exactly
what you'd expect, it's in our second row,

121
00:08:02.325 --> 00:08:08.203
but now it's pushing across two columns
and c moved up here to the top.

122
00:08:08.203 --> 00:08:13.110
And that's actually what you would expect
c is gonna try to occupy the space that b

123
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:17.387
might have otherwise left behind,
that is the way grid is gonna work.

124
00:08:17.387 --> 00:08:23.941
So c pops on up here But that's not
exactly the layout that we're looking for,

125
00:08:23.941 --> 00:08:28.922
so what would be a better value for
grid column for letter b?

126
00:08:28.922 --> 00:08:34.054
&gt;&gt; 2/3
&gt;&gt; 2/3 okay.

127
00:08:34.054 --> 00:08:40.100
So if we said 2/3 okay, so
a is now here in the upper left but

128
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.433
b is down here in the lower right.

129
00:08:43.433 --> 00:08:48.281
That's the remember this is two and
two three, we actually want b to

130
00:08:48.281 --> 00:08:53.430
show up over here, starting at line
number one gonna line number two.

131
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.915
So let's change that to 1/2.

132
00:08:57.316 --> 00:09:02.211
&gt;&gt; All right, so we are back now to
what grid thinks is a single column, and

133
00:09:02.211 --> 00:09:03.279
that's okay.

134
00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:04.825
Because when we put in literacy,

135
00:09:04.825 --> 00:09:08.690
grid will know that we actually have
more than one column working here.

136
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:13.110
We have a and b in the same column but
they are in different rows.

137
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:19.067
All right, so here for letter c then, And

138
00:09:19.067 --> 00:09:22.160
a grid column, okay?

139
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.360
So now we have letter
c as you can see here,

140
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.470
it is spanning across
some particular area.

141
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:34.600
So it's definitely going
from line one to line two,

142
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:42.078
to line three that's our rows, .okay so
our grid row here is gonna be 1/3

143
00:09:46.045 --> 00:09:51.717
Nice, and then it automatically
fills in the space that's over here,

144
00:09:51.717 --> 00:09:55.696
so now grid knows that we
have two columns kind of.

145
00:09:55.696 --> 00:10:00.584
So it's going ahead and drawing that
in in this particular space here,

146
00:10:00.584 --> 00:10:06.123
our grid column though maybe wanna take a
suggestion as to what our numbers are for

147
00:10:06.123 --> 00:10:09.251
our grid column
&gt;&gt; 1 slash 2

148
00:10:09.251 --> 00:10:10.298
&gt;&gt; 1 slash 2 for

149
00:10:10.298 --> 00:10:15.187
the column remember we start here
here's line one for our column,

150
00:10:15.187 --> 00:10:21.053
here's line two we actually want it over
here don't we any other suggestions?

151
00:10:28.155 --> 00:10:29.326
&gt;&gt; 2/4.

152
00:10:29.326 --> 00:10:34.211
&gt;&gt; 2/4, that's correct,
because we're gonna from two,

153
00:10:34.211 --> 00:10:40.340
remember we're gonna have a line here
it's this part down here between e and

154
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:46.393
f, let's line to line three and
then line four is outside of the painting.
