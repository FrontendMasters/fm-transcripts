1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.670
So the next thing I would like to
talk about are responsive images.

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.910
And specifically, we're gonna talk about
the picture element, source set and sizes.

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.570
And we're gonna talk about
when to use each one.

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.745
The actual code for
these things is just an HTML and

5
00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:17.170
it is not all that difficult to write.

6
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.853
And it's not that difficult to understand,
but

7
00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:23.600
choosing the right HTML element
at the right moment in time.

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.036
Is not necessarily all that
straightforward or easy so

9
00:00:27.036 --> 00:00:31.215
I wanna talk a little bit about
these types of responsive images and

10
00:00:31.215 --> 00:00:36.110
give you some background so that you
can make more intelligent choices.

11
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.934
When it comes to responsive images
inside of your web pages, so

12
00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:42.110
that's what this little
PowerPoint deck is all about.

13
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.290
So in the beginning, it was really easy.

14
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.264
We just had an image tag and
we would just put in one image and

15
00:00:47.264 --> 00:00:50.690
it would display on all the websites and
everything was just fine.

16
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.610
It was a beautiful world to live in and
we had rainbows and unicorns and ponies.

17
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.570
But then within market had to ruin it.

18
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.092
And we came up with this
concept of responsive images,

19
00:01:03.092 --> 00:01:07.611
which makes us ask a whole bunch of
different questions when it comes to

20
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:11.590
what kind of image should be
displaying on which device.

21
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.300
So first of all,
you have many content choices.

22
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.820
One of those might be the so
called art direction.

23
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.338
Lot of people when they write about
responsive images they talk about art

24
00:01:21.338 --> 00:01:25.640
direction, but we never really have
any idea what they're talking about.

25
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.450
I'm gonna demonstrate for
you what printer in just a moment.

26
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.450
You might be thinking about the format
of your image because there are so

27
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.866
many, where's GIF JPG and
PNG which we've had for years SVG is

28
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:44.490
a relatively recent addition of course for
illustration types of things.

29
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.070
But now we're just about to come up
with a whole new suite of image formats,

30
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.220
AVIF, WebP.

31
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.910
And there's several others
that are coming down the pipe.

32
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.806
You may need to think about pixel density.

33
00:01:54.806 --> 00:01:59.095
So you have retina images, for
example, on Apple devices or

34
00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:04.237
you have some other different type
of pixel densities on other devices.

35
00:02:04.237 --> 00:02:07.491
So are you serving up the right image
with the right pixel density to

36
00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:08.900
the right device?

37
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.630
What dimensions is the image
going to display at?

38
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.490
Sometimes we have images that are quite
large that we display in a small space.

39
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.950
Hopefully we don't go the other way
around to the images look terrible.

40
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.758
So we need to know what size will that
image display on the webpage it'll

41
00:02:24.758 --> 00:02:27.750
actually affect your performance and
how things load.

42
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.086
And then finally,

43
00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:34.620
who is going to choose what image you
use at any particular point in time?

44
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.170
Do you wanna make those
choices as the webpage author?

45
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.831
Or are you okay with letting
the browser decide and

46
00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:46.552
we're gonna take a look at that in
a little bit of detail as well.

47
00:02:46.552 --> 00:02:51.584
So, a lot of these things are outlined
in Avios manies fabulous book image

48
00:02:51.584 --> 00:02:57.020
optimization which came out in April
of 2021 from Smashing Magazine.

49
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.050
It's a great book, it's 528 pages.

50
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.400
So if you thought there wasn't that
much to know about images, you're wrong.

51
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.080
There's a ton to know about images.

52
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.049
It does have information about HTML,
CSS, and all kinds of JavaScript and

53
00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.230
performance implications.

54
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.900
So, what I'm gonna talk
about here is a tiny,

55
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.440
tiny subset of everything
you need to know.

56
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.520
I would encourage you to check out
his book for more information.

57
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.940
So the brief history of
responsive images of this.

58
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.770
In May 2010, Ethan Marcotte defines
whatever responsive images.

59
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.370
And then from 2010 to 2014,
it was just a disaster.

60
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.620
We had a big disaster where
responsive images were concerned.

61
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.335
There were server side solutions for

62
00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:40.000
serving up different images
under certain conditions.

63
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.280
There were clients sign
images driven by JavaScript.

64
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.560
There were paid solutions.

65
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.840
There were free solutions.

66
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.280
There was all kinds of different things.

67
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.010
But that was the time when
everybody was talking about it and

68
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.708
seeing what a responsive image was.

69
00:03:52.708 --> 00:03:57.268
We ended to find some standards and
then finally in 2016 the picture

70
00:03:57.268 --> 00:04:01.828
element was the first one that was
supported by the big four web browsers

71
00:04:01.828 --> 00:04:06.709
Firefox Chrome edge and Safari all
supported picture at that point in time.

72
00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.764
And then at as I mentioned
a little bit earlier in 2017,

73
00:04:10.764 --> 00:04:14.250
source set and
sizes were released as part of edge,

74
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.235
meaning that all of the major browsers
supported those attributes as well.

75
00:04:20.235 --> 00:04:23.675
And so now here we are in 2021.

76
00:04:23.675 --> 00:04:27.038
We have different solutions
available to us for

77
00:04:27.038 --> 00:04:31.750
responsive images that are all free,
that are HTML driven.

78
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.064
That are very good and so

79
00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:37.740
it's a great place to be finally 11 years
after the beginning of responsive design
