00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.340
Well I hope you did well
with the popular print.

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.418
Let's go through how this is gonna wind up
working out here the way that I coded it.

3
00:00:07.418 --> 00:00:11.422
So starting with the HTML,
I'm around line 44 in the HTML,

4
00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:15.118
and I start with a div with
a class of stripe, and that will

5
00:00:15.118 --> 00:00:20.050
wind up being the green stripe that goes
all the way across from edge to edge.

6
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.595
We've done this now this is the third
time we've done that we did it earlier

7
00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:27.320
with the footer and then we did it
with the header and in the navigation.

8
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.155
Now we're gonna do it this time with the
big green stripe going across the page.

9
00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:35.929
Then we have our section with an ID of
popular because it's popular prints and

10
00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:40.785
we have our series of figures nd figure
captions inside of an unordered list.

11
00:00:40.785 --> 00:00:45.385
So basically the HTML is nothing you
haven't seen before to this point in time.

12
00:00:46.965 --> 00:00:49.315
Now we'll take a look at the CSS.

13
00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:53.781
Starting here I'm around line 188
in the ending CSS, as it says,

14
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:57.365
here's the green stripe for
the popular images.

15
00:00:57.365 --> 00:01:01.153
As we've done before, we have our stripe,
it has a background color,

16
00:01:01.153 --> 00:01:03.430
this case it's color too.

17
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.667
Text was the white color and
we put a little bit of padding on it so

18
00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:09.183
it's not running into
the edges of the web page.

19
00:01:09.183 --> 00:01:15.862
And then, Because we don't
set our Flexbox in the mobile

20
00:01:15.862 --> 00:01:20.450
portion of the web page, that's all
it's there outside of the media queries.

21
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.510
Let's go down inside the meaning of
queries and see what we did here.

22
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.080
So here's the big trick,
we're gonna start with a tablet.

23
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.150
This is around line 327 inside of the CSS.

24
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:38.800
And so what you see here is I have my
inside of the popular ID of popular.

25
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.280
The Li last child we're gonna
set its flex spaces to 100%.

26
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.350
Stretch it all the way across the screen.

27
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.971
Otherwise, the the style right before
it here where it says section Li,

28
00:01:51.971 --> 00:01:54.839
its flex basis is set to 49.5%.

29
00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:58.812
And that will take effect because we've
written really nice efficient HTML and

30
00:01:58.812 --> 00:02:02.590
been consistent in how we read
our HTML through this document.

31
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.830
Our HTML will pick up
that particular style and

32
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.500
set those first two images on
top at roughly half the screen.

33
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.057
And then we'll say the last child
we want it to stretch to be 100%.

34
00:02:14.057 --> 00:02:18.057
So that's how we get the two on the top
and the one big one underneath.

35
00:02:18.057 --> 00:02:21.933
The problem is with that
particular image of the scooter,

36
00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:26.755
when you go to that wide format,
you'll see the top part of the picture,

37
00:02:26.755 --> 00:02:29.150
which is not the interesting part.

38
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.953
We're really interested in scooter, right.

39
00:02:30.953 --> 00:02:34.983
So you'll see the wallpaper and
you'll see things hanging on the wall and

40
00:02:34.983 --> 00:02:39.025
stuff which is lovely but it's better
if we see the bottom of the picture.

41
00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:42.915
So we'll take advantage of
that object position feature,

42
00:02:42.915 --> 00:02:48.540
object position property again, and just
playing around with numbers and so forth.

43
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.164
I found that zero negative 350 pixels,
moved up that image enough so

44
00:02:53.164 --> 00:02:55.706
that we could see some of the scooter and

45
00:02:55.706 --> 00:02:59.810
have more of a sense of why
it was called let's scoot.

46
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.030
So that's why I did that.

47
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.982
And then finally, let's go down to the
bottom here inside of our media query for

48
00:03:07.982 --> 00:03:11.798
the desktop and so
as I have mentioned to you before,

49
00:03:11.798 --> 00:03:15.710
you have to think about
what you need to turn off.

50
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.299
So right now we have two of those Li's
that are have a width of about half,

51
00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.420
we have one that has
a width of about a 100%.

52
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.090
We need to change all of that.

53
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.753
So here, on line 380, the section Li and

54
00:03:30.753 --> 00:03:36.000
popular Li last child,
you need all of that in order to override

55
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.360
what comes before we said that
flex space is too about a.

56
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.685
And then finally down at the bottom
that last figure if we reset

57
00:03:45.685 --> 00:03:49.179
the object position property
back to zero again so

58
00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:54.418
that the image doesn't completely scroll
off the screen and we have a great

59
00:03:54.418 --> 00:04:00.350
big huge gaping hole we've put the picture
back down into the frame appropriately.
