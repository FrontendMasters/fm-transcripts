00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.398
Well, I hope you did well
with the popular prints.

2
00:00:02.398 --> 00:00:07.451
Let's go through how this is gonna wind up
working out here the way that I coded it.

3
00:00:07.451 --> 00:00:11.455
So starting with the HTML,
I'm around line 44 in the HTML,

4
00:00:11.455 --> 00:00:15.151
and I start with a div with
a class of stripe, and that will

5
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:20.086
wind up being the green stripe that goes
all the way across from edge to edge.

6
00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:24.219
We've done this now this is the third time
we've done that we did it earlier with

7
00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:28.104
the footer and then we did it with
the header and in the navigation now we're

8
00:00:28.104 --> 00:00:31.696
gonna do it this time with the big
green stripe going across the page.

9
00:00:31.696 --> 00:00:36.500
Then we have our section with an ID of
popular cuz it's popular prints and

10
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.699
we have our series of figures and figure
captions inside of an unordered list so

11
00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.851
basically the HTML is nothing you haven't
seen before to this point in time.

12
00:00:46.851 --> 00:00:49.275
Now we'll take a look at the CSS.

13
00:00:49.275 --> 00:00:54.799
Starting here I'm around line 188
in the ending CSS, as it says here.

14
00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:57.216
Here's the green stripe for
the popular images.

15
00:00:57.216 --> 00:00:58.676
As we've done before,

16
00:00:58.676 --> 00:01:03.287
we have our stripe, it has a background
colour this case it's colour two.

17
00:01:03.287 --> 00:01:07.082
Text was a white color and
we put a little bit of padding on it, so

18
00:01:07.082 --> 00:01:10.036
it's not running into
the edges of the webpage.

19
00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:15.970
And then, Because we don't
set our Flexbox in the mobile

20
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.308
portion of the webpage, that's all it's
there outside of the media queries.

21
00:01:20.308 --> 00:01:24.362
Let's go down inside the media queries and
see what we did here.

22
00:01:24.362 --> 00:01:25.528
So here's the big trick.

23
00:01:25.528 --> 00:01:30.979
We're gonna start with a tablet,
this is around line 327 inside of the CSS.

24
00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.519
And so what you see here is I have,

25
00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:40.216
inside of the popular ID of
popular the li last child.

26
00:01:40.216 --> 00:01:44.913
We're gonna set its flex basis to
a hundred percent stretch it all the way

27
00:01:44.913 --> 00:01:46.226
across the screen.

28
00:01:46.226 --> 00:01:50.660
Otherwise the style right before
it here where it says section li,

29
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.193
its flex basis is set to 49.5% and

30
00:01:53.193 --> 00:01:58.263
that will take effect because we've
written really nice efficient HTML and

31
00:01:58.263 --> 00:02:02.564
been consistent in how we wrote
our HTML through this document.

32
00:02:02.564 --> 00:02:05.453
Our HTML will pick up
that particular style and

33
00:02:05.453 --> 00:02:09.824
set those first two images on top at
you know roughly half the screen and

34
00:02:09.824 --> 00:02:13.972
then we'll say the last child we
want it to stretch to be 100% so

35
00:02:13.972 --> 00:02:18.156
that's how we get the two on the top and
the one big one underneath.

36
00:02:18.156 --> 00:02:23.059
The problem is with that particular
image of the scooter when you go to that

37
00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.696
wide format,
you'll see the top part of the picture,

38
00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:29.088
which is not the interesting part.

39
00:02:29.088 --> 00:02:31.085
We're really interested
in the scooter right.

40
00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:35.101
So you'll see the wallpaper and
you'll see things hanging on the wall and

41
00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:39.132
stuff which is lovely but It's better
if we see the bottom of the picture.

42
00:02:39.132 --> 00:02:44.159
So we'll take advantage of that
object position property again and

43
00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.068
just playing around with numbers and so

44
00:02:47.068 --> 00:02:50.684
forth I found that zero
negative 350 pixels,

45
00:02:50.684 --> 00:02:55.708
moved up that image enough so
that we could see some of the scooter and

46
00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:59.696
have more of a sense of why
it was called let's scoot.

47
00:02:59.696 --> 00:03:01.999
So that's why I did that.

48
00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:06.967
And then finally, let's go down to the
bottom here inside of our media query for

49
00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:10.013
the desktop And so

50
00:03:10.013 --> 00:03:15.731
as I have mentioned to you before you have
to think about what you need to turn off.

51
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:22.095
So right now we have two of those LI's
that are have a width of about half.

52
00:03:22.095 --> 00:03:25.335
We have one that has
a width of about 100%.

53
00:03:25.335 --> 00:03:26.971
We need to change all of that.

54
00:03:26.971 --> 00:03:31.946
So here on line 380, the section LI and

55
00:03:31.946 --> 00:03:34.798
popular LI last child.

56
00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:38.661
You need all of that in order
to override what comes before.

57
00:03:38.661 --> 00:03:42.450
We said that flexspaces to about a third.

58
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.061
And then finally down at the bottom
that last figure we reset the object

59
00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:51.988
position property back to zero again so
that the image doesn't completely

60
00:03:51.988 --> 00:03:56.190
scroll off the screen and
we have a great big huge gaping hole.

61
00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.330
We put the picture back down
into the frame appropriately.
