00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.125
So what I'd like for you to work on
next is this four part or sorry,

2
00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:05.931
three part series of items.

3
00:00:05.931 --> 00:00:11.369
There's a collections piece,
a mission piece, and a footer.

4
00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:16.512
And so the goal here is to do a whole
bunch of layouts with Flexbox.

5
00:00:16.512 --> 00:00:19.255
And I've thrown in a couple
of other little tidbits for

6
00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:22.008
some of you who may be a little
bit more advanced in CSS.

7
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:27.102
Or who wanna and
read up on some additional CSS properties.

8
00:00:27.102 --> 00:00:29.951
So let's take a look at
what these look like.

9
00:00:29.951 --> 00:00:34.706
And we're gonna switch
to VS code to do this.

10
00:00:34.706 --> 00:00:39.265
So inside these are files that are from
GitHub, you can download them and

11
00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:40.694
put them into VS code.

12
00:00:40.694 --> 00:00:43.685
And so I'm in folder 4A.

13
00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:49.656
So under folder four Flexbox
exercises folder 4A collections.

14
00:00:49.656 --> 00:00:52.668
You'll see here I've given
you a bunch of screenshots.

15
00:00:52.668 --> 00:00:54.191
We'll start with the first screenshot.

16
00:00:54.191 --> 00:00:56.328
This is the collections piece.

17
00:00:56.328 --> 00:00:59.484
So all of these assets are here and

18
00:00:59.484 --> 00:01:03.775
available to you inside
of the begin folder.

19
00:01:03.775 --> 00:01:07.306
So if you look inside of begin,
I've given you a starting stylesheet.

20
00:01:07.306 --> 00:01:11.337
I've given you all of the images
in the dimensions that you need.

21
00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:14.504
And I've given you a starting
HTML webpage here.

22
00:01:14.504 --> 00:01:18.968
It's all marked up for you and what I'd
like for you to do is, to build this

23
00:01:18.968 --> 00:01:23.443
out so that your collections page looks
like this at a desktop dimension.

24
00:01:23.443 --> 00:01:25.626
And I think I've put in
the media queries for you too.

25
00:01:25.626 --> 00:01:28.572
So you don't have to worry about that.

26
00:01:28.572 --> 00:01:33.223
At a tablet dimension we're going to go
to two images across instead of three.

27
00:01:33.223 --> 00:01:34.909
And then in a mobile dimension,

28
00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.164
we're gonna go to one image
stacked all the way down the page.

29
00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:42.612
So that we'll be challenge
number one is to go through and

30
00:01:42.612 --> 00:01:45.217
lay out this collections piece.

31
00:01:45.217 --> 00:01:49.951
Then in challenge number two 4b,
this is the mission.

32
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.991
I have sort of two alternatives.

33
00:01:55.991 --> 00:02:01.308
So if you are more of a Flexbox beginner,
this is one way of approaching this.

34
00:02:01.308 --> 00:02:04.430
So this is the mission section of
the page that you go on top of

35
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.060
the collections piece
that you're gonna build.

36
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.436
And, ops, sorry looks like this.

37
00:02:10.436 --> 00:02:14.350
This is how it should look if you
are more of a Flexbox beginner.

38
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.072
So you have the logo and
you have the text next to it.

39
00:02:17.072 --> 00:02:21.181
Notice how it all lines up really
nicely here on the desktop, right.

40
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:23.858
So that logo is as big as
the column underneath of it.

41
00:02:23.858 --> 00:02:30.074
The text here lines up with what the other
images that are over here underneath.

42
00:02:30.074 --> 00:02:35.681
Then we're going to go to our tablet
dimension continues to look like that.

43
00:02:35.681 --> 00:02:39.917
And then we can go to our mobile dimension
where we have the text on top and

44
00:02:39.917 --> 00:02:41.266
the logo underneath.

45
00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:44.462
Now if you are a more advanced CSS coder,

46
00:02:44.462 --> 00:02:48.791
then you might wanna read up
a little bit on CSS shapes.

47
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:51.188
And you can code this
a little bit differently.

48
00:02:51.188 --> 00:02:54.859
These are just the the one
here called desktop that PNG.

49
00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.865
Notice here how I've made the text
go down the slant of that logo.

50
00:02:58.865 --> 00:03:00.523
Isn't that not a cool effect?

51
00:03:00.523 --> 00:03:05.706
So, this is something that you can take
a look at and how to approach here.

52
00:03:05.706 --> 00:03:09.257
So that would be the desktop
version of that and

53
00:03:09.257 --> 00:03:12.452
then the Tablet version looks like that.

54
00:03:12.452 --> 00:03:17.168
And then finally the mobile version.

55
00:03:17.168 --> 00:03:20.680
Put the logo on the top and
put the text underneath.

56
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.166
So a hint here.

57
00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:26.106
If you decide to take this route,
this would not be a Flexbox based layout.

58
00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:28.478
We're going to be doing
something with a float.

59
00:03:28.478 --> 00:03:30.156
So you need to float the image.

60
00:03:30.156 --> 00:03:36.983
And use CSS shapes to make that cool
slant along the edge of the logo.

61
00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:41.661
And then the last one is a footer layout.

62
00:03:41.661 --> 00:03:47.254
So underneath the collections down here at
the bottom we are gonna set up a layout.

63
00:03:47.254 --> 00:03:48.884
Where we've got the stay connected.

64
00:03:48.884 --> 00:03:51.219
We've got links to Facebook and Instagram.

65
00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:53.725
And we have our address for
the wall of wonder.

66
00:03:53.725 --> 00:03:59.037
And then we're going to go to our
tablet layout, which looks like this.

67
00:03:59.037 --> 00:04:03.087
And then our mobile layout.

68
00:04:03.087 --> 00:04:06.876
So if you're feeling a little
overwhelmed by all of those things.

69
00:04:06.876 --> 00:04:10.179
Here's what I would recommend for
those of you who are beginners.

70
00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:13.649
The collections is probably
the best one to spend your time on,

71
00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:17.525
if you're limited in the amount of
time you have time to spend on this.

72
00:04:17.525 --> 00:04:22.361
That'll get you a lot of learning going
from three images across the two images

73
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:24.275
across to one image on mobile.

74
00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:26.706
That would be the first
thing that I would work on.

75
00:04:26.706 --> 00:04:32.348
If you're a beginner and you just wanna
code up the mission element really quick,

76
00:04:32.348 --> 00:04:35.385
you can probably get
that done really fast.

77
00:04:35.385 --> 00:04:37.863
Based on the code that you write for
collections,

78
00:04:37.863 --> 00:04:40.107
the mission should go
together really fast.

79
00:04:40.107 --> 00:04:42.871
And then work on the footer last.

80
00:04:42.871 --> 00:04:46.054
If you are not sure about
that whole CSS shapes thing,

81
00:04:46.054 --> 00:04:49.539
you might just go from
the collections down to the footer.

82
00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.830
And then come back to
the shapes there at the end.
