00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.530
So while we're here, let's go ahead and
write the picture tag up here at the top.

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.590
So, where it says hero image goes
here around line 28 in your HTML.

3
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.500
Let's put in our picture element.

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.221
So here I am making the choices to which
picture will display at which point

5
00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:20.838
in time.

6
00:00:20.838 --> 00:00:24.674
So here we're gonna say section id=hero

7
00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:36.428
And then inside of this,
we'll say picture.

8
00:00:41.464 --> 00:00:44.383
And inside of that,
then we can put all the good stuff.

9
00:00:44.383 --> 00:00:45.881
So we start with source set.

10
00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:56.542
Image/hero-1200.png,

11
00:00:56.542 --> 00:00:59.207
and then

12
00:00:59.207 --> 00:01:07.965
media="(min-width:

13
00:01:07.965 --> 00:01:12.536
839px".

14
00:01:12.536 --> 00:01:13.536
How did I come up with all this?

15
00:01:13.536 --> 00:01:16.856
Mostly, I wrote this webpage and
I played around and

16
00:01:16.856 --> 00:01:19.884
decided what looked good where,
and so forth.

17
00:01:19.884 --> 00:01:26.266
So there's no magic bullet as
to how this stuff is gonna go.

18
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:31.202
You just kind of have to play around and
make some decisions.

19
00:01:31.202 --> 00:01:35.178
Here's another one source set,

20
00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:39.439
this was gonna be 838.png, and

21
00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.270
this will have a minimum
width of 301 pixels.

22
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.244
And then we'll have our default image,
Down here at the bottom.

23
00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:56.056
Src="img/" hero.300,

24
00:01:56.056 --> 00:02:00.521
will be our default image, and

25
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:06.890
then alt will be rainbow
hero image banner.

26
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.427
Probably come up with a better
description for that.

27
00:02:11.427 --> 00:02:15.323
Okay, and if we save that,
We refresh our page,

28
00:02:15.323 --> 00:02:22.230
there's the hero image up there at the top
of the page for the wall a wonder, and

29
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.790
we can squash that down and
you actually will see it jump there.

30
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.000
So see how I'm squashing it and

31
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.950
then when I get to my breakpoint
wherever it was, there it is.

32
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.791
Now it just loaded in another image,
that's the smaller version of the image.

33
00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:43.580
Okay, we have other things going
on our navigation is changing and

34
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.672
all the rest of it.

35
00:02:44.672 --> 00:02:48.897
But one of the things you'll notice
as I make that window smaller there,

36
00:02:48.897 --> 00:02:52.360
with that picture element,
notice that the image itself,

37
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.376
like all the other images on the page
have that width of 100% set,

38
00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:59.168
so that it scales down
without those big jumps.

39
00:02:59.168 --> 00:03:02.045
And this picture element
does not have that,

40
00:03:02.045 --> 00:03:05.986
because it has different
different code associated with it.

41
00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:10.700
Then does the image tag, which is used for
displaying everything else.

42
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.560
So we can make some more
modifications to this in our CSS,

43
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.219
to get rid of those big
jumps along the way.

44
00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:24.317
So if we do that we'll jump into our CSS,
I'm just gonna go

45
00:03:24.317 --> 00:03:29.328
into the finished style sheet here,
and I will show you.

46
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.885
Here we go.

47
00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:42.534
Some of the hero styles

48
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.251
So let's put this in,
after the navigation,

49
00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:52.107
just to sort of keep our CSS in the order
of the things that appear on the page, so

50
00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:57.840
I'm around line 124, and my CSS, and
I'm gonna add two additional styles here.

51
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.428
So to the hero section itself,
I'll set a background color,

52
00:04:03.428 --> 00:04:07.523
with color 7,
which I think is a gold color.

53
00:04:07.523 --> 00:04:12.396
Text align of center, max width of 100%,
turn off the padding and

54
00:04:12.396 --> 00:04:17.530
the margin, and then for the hero image,
see how I'm handling this one.

55
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.816
So I have a max width of 100%, and
I have a max height of 454 pixels,

56
00:04:21.816 --> 00:04:23.418
how did I come up with that?

57
00:04:23.418 --> 00:04:27.496
Well when we get to the 1200
pixel wide picture,

58
00:04:27.496 --> 00:04:32.416
that's 1200 pixels wide,
and it's 454 pixels tall.

59
00:04:32.416 --> 00:04:36.440
So I've taken that tallest dimension and
set that as my max height.

60
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.530
We don't really want it
to get bigger than that.

61
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.338
And then just set the max width
accordingly to 100%, so that can scale.

62
00:04:43.338 --> 00:04:48.291
So when I save this, and
I drop it into a web page, and refresh,

63
00:04:48.291 --> 00:04:50.829
there's my background color.

64
00:04:53.442 --> 00:04:58.152
And now when I scratch
the screen down here,

65
00:04:58.152 --> 00:05:03.361
see how much nicer and
smoother that is, So much better.

66
00:05:03.361 --> 00:05:09.089
Okay, so the key takeaway here is, yes,

67
00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:16.301
we're using the responsive images,
absolutely.

68
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:20.799
Which are loading in at
different points in time, so

69
00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:26.219
that we can get smaller file sizes
at the appropriate points and

70
00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:29.185
potentially with art direction,

71
00:05:29.185 --> 00:05:33.699
not in this specific example,
but it could happen.

72
00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:34.654
And we're combining it with sort of that
little hacky thing, that I told you about,

73
00:05:34.654 --> 00:05:35.176
to make that transition very, very smooth.

74
00:05:35.176 --> 00:05:35.801
Just in case somebody
winds up close to the edge

75
00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:36.307
or maybe they resize their browser.

76
00:05:36.307 --> 00:05:41.125
It won't be a jarring experience as
they're looking at that particular hero

77
00:05:41.125 --> 00:05:41.650
image.
