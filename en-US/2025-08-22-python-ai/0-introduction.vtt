&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Hello everyone,
my name is Steve, and

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.666
we're gonna talk about AI today.

3
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:11.617
But we're gonna talk about AI a little bit
differently than I think a lot of people,

4
00:00:11.617 --> 00:00:15.613
including myself a few days ago,
are talking about AI,

5
00:00:15.613 --> 00:00:20.631
where a lot of the zeitgeist around
artificial intelligence right now

6
00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:25.501
involves going into one's favorite
chatbot and being impressed.

7
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:29.529
Or maybe pointing said chatbot
at their own code base or

8
00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.994
maybe going in there and saying,
draw me a picture of a very,

9
00:00:33.994 --> 00:00:38.043
very angry hamburger or
something along those lines.

10
00:00:38.043 --> 00:00:42.720
And that is all very good, and
I do it and you do it, we all do it.

11
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.151
What we're going to do today is actually
kind of go down to the fundamentals and

12
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:53.090
start figuring out how all this stuff
works kind of at the lower levels,

13
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.465
we won't say the lowest,
but lower levels where

14
00:00:56.465 --> 00:01:01.190
we'll do stuff like some very kind
of basic text transformations.

15
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.950
We'll fine tune GPT2 to make
it do something that we want.

16
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.739
We will go look at how to generate our own
images and then we'll look at how can we

17
00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:18.550
fine tune that to have it specifically
generate images of, I mean, your dog.

18
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.270
My dog.

19
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.950
I'm going to generate pictures of my dog.

20
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.093
What you choose to generate is up to you
and kind of actually figure out all this

21
00:01:25.093 --> 00:01:29.304
stuff works because there are a lot of
very powerful practical applications,

22
00:01:29.304 --> 00:01:32.015
applications of just some
of the smaller pieces.

23
00:01:32.015 --> 00:01:36.552
And I think what's really cool about some
of this stuff is the fact that you can,

24
00:01:36.552 --> 00:01:38.121
there are given features.

25
00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:41.099
You want to pull down
an open source model and

26
00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:45.929
work with it to do that feature that
you want as just part of your code base

27
00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.050
without all of the extra API key dancing,
so on and so forth.

28
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.525
We're going to do it today predominantly,

29
00:01:54.525 --> 00:01:59.270
almost exclusively in the Python
programming language.

30
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.611
That said, for all of the text parts,

31
00:02:03.611 --> 00:02:08.470
we use this SDK service, Hugging Face.

32
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.510
They have both a typescript and
a Python SDK for all of the text stuff.

33
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.426
When we get to the part of the show
that is working with graphics cards and

34
00:02:21.426 --> 00:02:27.460
generated images,
Python is the predominant game in town.

35
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.940
So we're gonna do it all today in Python.

36
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.940
That said, if you're like,
I don't know Python, you're gonna be okay.

37
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.540
If you know JavaScript and
you squint at Python, it's not that bad.

38
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.617
So yeah, lots of really,

39
00:02:41.617 --> 00:02:44.500
really cool things that I'm
really excited about today.

40
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.306
And like I said along the way, it's not
just about necessarily how do I use yet

41
00:02:50.306 --> 00:02:53.165
another SDK to do yet another thing but

42
00:02:53.165 --> 00:02:57.805
we will also kind of use these
tools to find out, like, okay,

43
00:02:57.805 --> 00:03:03.471
I hear about Transformers more than
meets the eye, but how does that work?

44
00:03:03.471 --> 00:03:07.270
I know these words tokens and embeddings,
I've heard these words before.

45
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.870
I don't really know what that means.

46
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.150
So we will by the end of this,
and it'll be pretty cool.

47
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.859
General flow of what we're gonna do
today is, some of this stuff, obviously,

48
00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:24.330
if you're new to all of this, there
are terms and words and stuff like that.

49
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.716
So the kind of rhythm and
flow that we're gonna do is I'm gonna

50
00:03:29.716 --> 00:03:35.117
kind of explain a bunch of
concepts conceptually with words.

51
00:03:35.117 --> 00:03:39.850
And then we'll do a second pass
through them with actual code.

52
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.531
That way you can kind of, like,
put all the mental roadmap in place of

53
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:48.839
what we're going to talk about,
and then we will see the code.

54
00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:51.321
Because sometimes both reading code and

55
00:03:51.321 --> 00:03:54.684
understanding concepts at
the same time is dreadful.

56
00:03:54.684 --> 00:03:57.110
So we'll do it kind of two passes.
