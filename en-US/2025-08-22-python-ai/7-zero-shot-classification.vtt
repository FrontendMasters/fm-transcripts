00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.040
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There's a whole bunch
of little things that we can tweak and

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.160
we'll play around with at various points.

3
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.195
But yeah, I would say like play around
with some of the different ones, go up

4
00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:14.960
to 1.2 or 1.5 as well and get a sense of
what you want to come out of it, right?

5
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.000
And with all things, right?

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.883
Because again,

7
00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:21.800
this is simply a statistical model
that goes based on the previous words.

8
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.224
All previous words right in the prompt,
go ahead and generate the next few clearly

9
00:00:27.224 --> 00:00:33.220
like the words that you feed, it also play
a role beyond the knobs that you can turn.

10
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.492
And so if you start speaking in
a formal style, you are likely,

11
00:00:37.492 --> 00:00:41.845
because if it's trained on,
read a bunch of academic papers and

12
00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:47.326
a sentence starts out in that kind of
academic speak, statistically speaking,

13
00:00:47.326 --> 00:00:51.300
the next most likely word will be that so
on and so forth.

14
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.462
So why don't you take a few minutes and
go,

15
00:00:53.462 --> 00:00:57.009
I think play with a bunch of those
numbers or any of these parameters and

16
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:01.455
let me know in, I don't know, five minutes
if there's anything that was particularly

17
00:01:01.455 --> 00:01:04.470
interesting or fun or
anything along those lines.

18
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.026
So the other one that I said was pretty
cool, came to that when we talked about

19
00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:10.990
sentiment analysis is this idea
of zero shot classification.

20
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.658
Zero shot means if you think about when
you have a conversation with ChatGPT,

21
00:01:16.658 --> 00:01:21.990
that first prompt, if you got what
you want, is effectively zero shot.

22
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.006
You said one thing, you got result
beyond that, then you're doing

23
00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:32.550
a lot of other techniques but
sending one thing and getting the results.

24
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.159
What's cool about this is,
like I said before, you send one thing,

25
00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.470
it does not necessarily even
need to particularly be trained.

26
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.230
You say, hey, I've got this string of
text, hey, I've got these categories.

27
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.830
Why don't you figure out
what label it should have?

28
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.350
There's no fine tuning at this point.

29
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.190
There's no special tweaking of the model.

30
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.540
It's just using some of the stuff
that I haven't explained to you yet

31
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.066
because I felt like lecturing to you for
three hours about philosophical

32
00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:03.150
conceptual concepts before
showing you any code was rude.

33
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.510
I'm just trying to get you excited.

34
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.670
We'll see how it works.

35
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.550
You can kinda give it both and it will
figure out those things effectively.

36
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.246
Saying this text is about a given
category and then it will see how well

37
00:02:15.246 --> 00:02:18.510
the hypothesis fits and
it will give you a score in this case.

38
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.030
So here we'll scroll
back up to the second.

39
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.030
Let's actually just look at it.

40
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.361
So here we've got yet another pipeline
Again, the tasting note is for

41
00:02:28.361 --> 00:02:34.340
all of these especially particularly
simple small kind of model things.

42
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.479
I mean, text generation, one would argue,

43
00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:39.700
is the big thing that we all use every
day in the rest of these models.

44
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.180
So they can be small, tiny models.

45
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.500
They can also the big things are just
the little things at scale, right?

46
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.338
If you took one of these small models and

47
00:02:49.338 --> 00:02:54.498
fed it all of the world's Internet and
gave it like a giant server farm,

48
00:02:54.498 --> 00:02:58.870
you too could turn these small
models into that as well.

49
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.670
But considering we are running on
commodity hardware at this point, not bad.

50
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.110
So yeah, we just pull in a pipeline for
this zero shot classification.

51
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.951
The default model in this
case is from Facebook and

52
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:17.840
I just arbitrarily came up with
a bunch of candidate labels.

53
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.480
Again, it is not trained on these.

54
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.811
You could theoretically
take data from your logs,

55
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:28.001
data from something else that you have,
grab one of those data sets, like I said

56
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:33.760
on hugging face that look interesting and
theoretically begin to classify it.

57
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.040
There's all sorts of data sets.

58
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.400
You can go look around, it's fun.

59
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.677
But here I was not feeling
particularly creative that day,

60
00:03:42.677 --> 00:03:48.450
so I think I was angry about
the Lakers at that moment, who knows?

61
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.331
And you know, you can come up
with a bunch of categories and

62
00:03:53.331 --> 00:03:56.530
not being trained on either
the categories or the strings.

63
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.650
Again, it comes up with a hypothesis.

64
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.193
It then uses the attention stuff,
which I have not talked about yet again,

65
00:04:03.193 --> 00:04:07.447
building up anticipation to figure
out how well those things fit in and

66
00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:12.085
then kind of figures out what label is
most likely for each of these, right?

67
00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:15.501
And again, part of the game
here was choosing strings and

68
00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:18.610
categories that were at
least obvious to you.

69
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.856
So like, cool, he put in random
stuff from his logs or whatever or

70
00:04:21.856 --> 00:04:25.570
some data set I've never seen and
some labels that I don't know about.

71
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.570
Yep, definitely.

72
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.964
But like, ideally you should be
able to squint at each of these and

73
00:04:31.964 --> 00:04:36.771
probably figure out what one
they apply to specifically,

74
00:04:36.771 --> 00:04:40.220
because I'm clearly not that creative.

75
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.140
And I'm pretty sure the strings are in
the same order as the candidate labels.

76
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.376
If you don't believe me that this works,
you can shuffle them as well and

77
00:04:48.376 --> 00:04:50.540
get a sense of that one too.

78
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.629
So here we again will just
iterate over the text and

79
00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:56.540
we'll just pass them into that
classifier pipeline that we created.

80
00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.780
What we want to do is then see for
any given one what.

81
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.990
What label should it have, right?

82
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.899
And again, where things might
become the very practical thing and

83
00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:16.012
I worked at an email company for
a little bit and

84
00:05:16.012 --> 00:05:19.830
both in terms of accounts and also emails.

85
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.470
Is this spam or not?

86
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.017
Is this account, you know,
like, you know, information,

87
00:05:26.017 --> 00:05:30.260
like in terms of like payment information,
probably fraudulent or not.

88
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.900
So there's a lot of like this one's got
a lot of practical use cases, right?

89
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.900
And you can see that I'm not gonna
make you do this math, right?

90
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.660
But if you're willing to believe me,
guess what?

91
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.500
All of those decimals add up
to the number one, right?

92
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.913
And so it will theoretically kinda
show you the different weighting of

93
00:05:56.913 --> 00:05:58.720
what it believes that it is.

94
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.080
And again, the reason I chose,
kind of silly.

95
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.760
Silly, but whatever.

96
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.784
Strings, which is like Apple
reported record quarterly

97
00:06:08.784 --> 00:06:11.840
earnings driven by strong iPhone sales.

98
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.999
It's like that seems to be.

99
00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:16.640
We're two-thirds pretty
sure it's about technology.

100
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.160
One third sure it's about business.

101
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.320
Yeah, I can agree with that.

102
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.800
I can sign on to that newsletter.

103
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.619
The artificial intelligence model shows
significant improvements in natural

104
00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:31.800
language understanding that is
most likely about technology.

105
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.039
Yeah, me about the other ones, which
again, having chosen strings that were

106
00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:41.720
supposed to get certain classifications,
I feel good about it.

107
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.725
Okay, this is predominantly about sports,
a little bit maybe about entertainment,

108
00:06:47.725 --> 00:06:50.040
but as you can see, barely.

109
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.010
So again, not knowing about any
of those categories beforehand or

110
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.460
any of the strings and
in particular, while I'm talking.

111
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.822
Go ahead.
You can edit any of the code in here and

112
00:07:01.822 --> 00:07:05.236
run it, try out some different strings,
add a few more strings,

113
00:07:05.236 --> 00:07:09.100
add a new category, get rid of some
categories and see what happens.

114
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.192
The cool thing about this is you can
experiment with all the code that I have

115
00:07:13.192 --> 00:07:16.300
on screen as we go through and
try out different things.

116
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.300
If you have some data you want
to put in there, go paste it in.

117
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.740
These are all totally interactive.

118
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.580
You can just hit the play button at any
given point and rerun that cell then and

119
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.090
get the data as well, right?

120
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.930
So like I said, it will.

121
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.810
Without any kind of magic.

122
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.130
None of this is magic.

123
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.410
But without any kind of work.

124
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.647
How about that?
Without any kind of work on our end to get

125
00:07:37.647 --> 00:07:41.354
the results, it does do a pretty good job
of taking arbitrary strings it's never

126
00:07:41.354 --> 00:07:42.062
seen before and

127
00:07:42.062 --> 00:07:45.850
arbitrary categories it's never seen
before and try to figure out the relation.

128
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.450
And again, for these tiny models, right?

129
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:52.903
Did you need to pull in and
start paying the cost per token for

130
00:07:52.903 --> 00:07:58.430
a giant world class foundational model
to do some of these simple things or

131
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.550
can you grab things that you
can fit very easily in a vm?

132
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:07.404
Some of these you probably get done
serverless if one put their mind to it,

133
00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:08.187
right, and

134
00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:13.310
build some features out that would
have taken you a long time otherwise.

135
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.950
Or even worse, write your own algorithm.

136
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.550
There are some pitfalls, though.

137
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:26.761
If you give it 100 categories and
all those answers add up to one,

138
00:08:26.761 --> 00:08:30.980
it's gonna end the way you
think it's going to end.

139
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.060
Everyone's nodding cuz yeah,
that's what's going to happen.

140
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:35.900
So you gotta keep that in mind.

141
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.747
And then having categories
that are too similar,

142
00:08:38.747 --> 00:08:42.900
there are things that you need to tweak
and consider, so on and so forth.

143
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.800
And also, and this becomes interesting,
if you have wider amounts of data,

144
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.700
what do you do which is like, do you need
to go grab a different model if you're

145
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.900
processing Spanish, so on and so
forth, do you need a layer beforehand?

146
00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:01.120
Either one of the translation models or
something along those lines?

147
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.867
Do you want to run through
a translation model and

148
00:09:03.867 --> 00:09:06.080
then pass it to an English classifier?

149
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.524
Maybe do you want to at least
detect what language it is and

150
00:09:10.524 --> 00:09:14.520
then have different models
that you slot in there?

151
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.440
Because you could theoretically,
the model is just an argument.

152
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.809
You could theoretically have many
a classifier, like, you know, a key value

153
00:09:22.809 --> 00:09:26.900
store for the different languages and
then grab the right classifier, right?

154
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.852
These are all where the engineering
part come in of like, for

155
00:09:30.852 --> 00:09:33.740
the unique specifics of your problem.

156
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.420
What do you do, right?

157
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.700
Welcome to the fact that none
of this solves anything for you.

158
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.900
Pitfalls are just.

159
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:39.760
Yeah, again,

160
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.700
doing any of the things that you think
would be probably somewhat bad, right?

161
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.340
But yeah, routing tickets to departments,
content moderation, so on and so forth.

162
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.140
The one that was near and dear to my
heart that my buddy Steven worked on.

163
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.270
And again to the question that you asked
earlier about various emotions beyond

164
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.300
positive, negative.

165
00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.850
This would probably be a better
solution than a model that,

166
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.481
cuz then you could figure out
which emotions you care about.

167
00:10:05.481 --> 00:10:07.300
[LAUGH] Right.

168
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.700
Are we going to go the full.

169
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.540
What's the Pixar movie where
they're all different emotions?

170
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.140
&gt;&gt; Student: Inside Out.

171
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.220
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Inside Out, yeah.

172
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.580
Right, you just pick the inside
out characters, right.

173
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.485
Or like, honestly, considering
that you can just run this cell,

174
00:10:20.485 --> 00:10:23.790
I don't know what
Power Ranger it aligns to.

175
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.430
What are the creative use cases here?

176
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.550
Which Ninja Turtle does
this most identify with?

177
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.430
That's brand new content.

178
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.510
I haven't thought about it.

179
00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.230
I might try that out later.

180
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.430
You can also try it out.

181
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.910
Any of these you should
play around with as well.

182
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.830
You can use multiple labels too.

183
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:41.190
I think I'm using.

184
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.230
Am I using a slightly
bigger model this time?

185
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.230
What did past me decide?

186
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.190
Nope, same model.

187
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.510
So in this case,
if we wanted to even have a version

188
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:54.370
of sentiment analysis that was positive,
negative, neutral.

189
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:56.610
We can do that as well.

190
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.210
Let's go take a look at
what this looks like.

191
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.850
Cool, so did we get something good?

192
00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.108
&gt;&gt; Student: I changed all the categories
to happy, sad, indifferent,

193
00:11:11.108 --> 00:11:12.540
angry and mean.

194
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.820
Just looking at how it came out.

195
00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.940
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: What did
the new iPhone come out?

196
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.300
&gt;&gt; Student: That was the reported quality.

197
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.620
The iPhone says that was happy, was 0.7.

198
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.140
Yeah, right.

199
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.300
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Apparently Facebook's
model is happy about the new iPhone.

200
00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:39.202
One of the interesting tasting notes
about the multi label classification

201
00:11:39.202 --> 00:11:43.930
is you can see in this case it
is that point on a 0 to 1 scale.

202
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.410
At that point you're sorting
by the highest number.

203
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:50.170
These do not add up to one,
as you can see very quickly.

204
00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:54.570
And so it's very confident
that it's about technology,

205
00:11:54.570 --> 00:12:00.330
pretty confident about business, and
half confident that it's a review.

206
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:06.170
And so those don't add up to 1, but
they are at least between 0 and 1.

207
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:10.850
And you could theoretically sort of and
pick the other one.

208
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.494
Let's comment that one out so

209
00:12:13.494 --> 00:12:18.690
I can do find out what this
model's feelings on Python is.

210
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.890
It's like pretty sure I love
programming Python as positive.

211
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:24.810
It's not entirely sure.

212
00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.730
It could be neutral, but
it's definitely probably not negative.

213
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:31.300
So you can kinda play around with these
and try out different categories and

214
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.643
that's the kind of the fun piece of
what other data do you have you could

215
00:12:34.643 --> 00:12:35.680
figure out?

216
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.334
Could you take a bunch of strings from
books and figure out is this fantasy,

217
00:12:39.334 --> 00:12:43.104
science fiction, fiction, nonfiction,
historical fiction, so on and so

218
00:12:43.104 --> 00:12:43.920
forth, right?

219
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.000
Like obviously there are a ton of
interesting things that you can do.

220
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.792
And like I said before,
some of this becomes, well,

221
00:12:50.792 --> 00:12:54.800
grab a data set that I grabbed, but
I'll show you where to grab other ones.

222
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.282
You can grab tons of data sets,
all sorts of different things and

223
00:12:59.282 --> 00:13:01.440
play around with them as well.

224
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:08.606
Yeah, like I said, as we saw before,
you can pull in categories like happy,

225
00:13:08.606 --> 00:13:13.727
sad, angry, surprised, even try
out some longer labels as well and

226
00:13:13.727 --> 00:13:17.110
kind of get a sense for
how these things work.

227
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.921
And again, I chose the default small
model so that as we were talking,

228
00:13:20.921 --> 00:13:24.790
we didn't have to wait for
one to download for 10 minutes.

229
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.649
But obviously if you're like building
something or even whether it's a hobby

230
00:13:28.649 --> 00:13:32.110
project or a real deal project,
10 minutes is not going to kill you.

231
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.430
It's only going to kill you when
you're watching me stand at a podium.

232
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.070
So some of the larger models I think
become interesting in that sense as well.

233
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.030
But yeah,
definitely try out different things.

234
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.790
Changing the strings,
play around with stuff.

235
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:49.470
I think that's where the interesting
pieces lie in this case.
