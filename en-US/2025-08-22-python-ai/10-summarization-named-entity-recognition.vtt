00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.800
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Not totally
related to hugging face.

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.798
I think one thing that's kind of
cool that is coming out is out

3
00:00:07.798 --> 00:00:12.800
depending on what version of
Chrome you're on is in Chrome.

4
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.723
Google has three kind of Gemini Nano
models that are available

5
00:00:18.723 --> 00:00:23.543
accessible from JavaScript in the browser,
a summarizer API,

6
00:00:23.543 --> 00:00:30.250
a language detection API and a language
model like an LLM for text generation.

7
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.519
So not only do you have hugging face for
a lot of this stuff, both in JavaScript

8
00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.465
as well as Python, but for stuff like
summary and even text generation,

9
00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:46.650
they are multi gigabyte downloads that
the user has to download of your website.

10
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.450
So you can only really use them for
progressive enhancement.

11
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.010
And they're only available in the browser.

12
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.790
But some of these are also things that you
will be able to do in, in the browser.

13
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.470
It's like tiers of rollout.

14
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.389
Some of them are just available,
some of them are only available in Chrome

15
00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:02.791
extensions, some of them only
available in a feature flag,

16
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:05.270
some only available in Chrome 137 and
higher.

17
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.710
So you can't totally rely on
them just yet, but you will.

18
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.982
So yeah, we have this idea of
summary where it will come and

19
00:01:13.982 --> 00:01:16.870
summarize it down a little bit as well.

20
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.790
Nothing particularly fancy.

21
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.885
And you gotta kinda play around with
where the stop token is cuz you can see

22
00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:22.970
it kinda stops here.

23
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.696
And so you can figure out either a,
how you wanna massage at or

24
00:01:26.696 --> 00:01:30.170
where you wanna cut sentences,
so on and so forth.

25
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.890
So summarization there it exists.

26
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.090
Nothing super exciting about that one.

27
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.010
It does what you think it's gonna
do as you kinda go along, right?

28
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.730
And again, everything.

29
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.810
Quality versus length,
trade off, so on and so forth.

30
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.025
The one that is somewhat
interesting though is this name and

31
00:01:47.025 --> 00:01:49.650
named entity recognition, right?

32
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.560
Where this will look
at a piece of text and

33
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.010
it'll try to pull out
the nouns effectively, right?

34
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.776
Like the places and it will categorize and
labels like, New York City,

35
00:02:01.776 --> 00:02:03.570
that is a location, right?

36
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.090
John Smith is a person,
Apple Incorporated is a company, right?

37
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.140
It will like pull out like multiple things
and kind of show it to you and label it.

38
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.097
So let's run that cuz I think it'll
take a second or two to download, but

39
00:02:18.097 --> 00:02:20.100
then we'll look at the text
while that happens.

40
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.238
So here we have a bunch of strings of text
like we've had the whole way through and

41
00:02:27.238 --> 00:02:32.060
we have run through them all and
basically pass them to this pipeline.

42
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.827
And then we're just going to try to get
a sense of where are the various different

43
00:02:36.827 --> 00:02:41.540
pieces that it knows about that it
will pull out so you can make some.

44
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.340
These are written in a way where.

45
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.060
Where they should all be somewhat rich
with a few things in them, right?

46
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.984
Most of them have some kind of location,

47
00:02:48.984 --> 00:02:52.940
some kind of either company or
person in them, right?

48
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.660
And you'll see that,
like just based on strings of text.

49
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.940
I should just go down and
see how big the model is.

50
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.060
This one's a little bit bigger.

51
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.940
Hence the talking.

52
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.220
Because it needs to have effectively
a dictionary of these terms.

53
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.797
And it's not like that far off from the
idea of this question answering that we

54
00:03:10.797 --> 00:03:12.580
saw earlier, except that it has kind of.

55
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.300
It's like a few of these kind of mixed.

56
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.100
If you think about it.

57
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.505
Where it.
Will pull out the word,

58
00:03:18.505 --> 00:03:20.380
the label it gave it from that set of.

59
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.380
I have a table down here
that'll show them to you.

60
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.460
For most models, whether it's per.

61
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:34.465
Or person, depends on the model, per se,
org location or geopolitical entities,

62
00:03:34.465 --> 00:03:39.495
dates, times, you can start to
pull out these core things,

63
00:03:39.495 --> 00:03:44.870
which is also, again,
super kind of an interesting thing.

64
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.062
I was saying the other day that
one of the interesting things that

65
00:03:50.062 --> 00:03:55.350
we can build with AI are a lot of
things that people want to build.

66
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.870
The hard part is not the code.

67
00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.190
The hard part is taking unstructured
data and making it structured.

68
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.694
If you wanted to make a list of
every lunch special in Minneapolis,

69
00:04:04.694 --> 00:04:08.573
writing the code to have a website of
every lunch special in Minneapolis is

70
00:04:08.573 --> 00:04:09.590
not the hard part.

71
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.407
It is pulling out the locations and
the times and the places and so

72
00:04:15.407 --> 00:04:16.730
on and so forth.

73
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.010
That's the hard part.

74
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.651
So tools that let you then take
arbitrary unstructured data and

75
00:04:21.651 --> 00:04:26.113
pull it out in a structured way and then
turn it into an array, a database row or

76
00:04:26.113 --> 00:04:30.641
what have you, I think is the thing where
we see a whole bunch of stuff that would

77
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:34.828
have been hard and needed a lot of human
power to do becomes a lot easier and

78
00:04:34.828 --> 00:04:36.850
opens up a whole new set of things.

79
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.660
So you can kind of see in these output.

80
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.900
See, talked long enough.

81
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.860
Now the answers are here.

82
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.860
So, yeah, 1.3 gigs, not bad.

83
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.020
Also did not take that long
on servers that are not mine.

84
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.260
So you can see like Microsoft,
that's an organization.

85
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.020
It's pretty confident about that.

86
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.929
It will also kind of
give you the start and

87
00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:57.660
end point of where that showed
up in the string, right?

88
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.930
So you could do stuff where you can
even grab something and highlight it,

89
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:01.959
like if you wanted to.

90
00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:04.070
Bill Gates, That sounds like a person.

91
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.350
It's pretty confident about that.

92
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.590
Albuquerque in New Mexico
pulled those out as places.

93
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.910
So it Kind of just takes
arbitrary text and

94
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.510
can categorize through
a known set of things.

95
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.206
The earlier zero shot
classification that we saw before,

96
00:05:16.206 --> 00:05:18.470
you get to define any category you want,
right?

97
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.790
And it could pull out or label a given
string of text the whole way through.

98
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.414
The question answering that we saw
earlier could answer a question and

99
00:05:28.414 --> 00:05:29.670
give you the start and end point.

100
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.212
This kind of does a little bit of both,
where you can both have a known set of

101
00:05:34.212 --> 00:05:38.903
categories and then also give an arbitrary
string of text and we'll pull out

102
00:05:38.903 --> 00:05:43.480
those things exactly where they were
found in there, so on and so forth.

103
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.026
John Smith Apple Cupertino, California so
on and so forth begins to pull out

104
00:05:48.026 --> 00:05:51.800
all of these kind of core and
important things in there as well.

105
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.190
So the named entity recognition,
depending on the model,

106
00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.411
it has a set of things that it recognizes,
and that's all you notice that one was

107
00:06:01.411 --> 00:06:04.130
like several times bigger
than the previous ones.

108
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.341
So if you wanted one that could like find
dates, phone numbers, email addresses,

109
00:06:11.341 --> 00:06:13.490
maybe it'd be a different model.

110
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.170
Yeah, yeah.

111
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.186
And with some of these,
I think these are the common ones, but

112
00:06:19.186 --> 00:06:22.450
you can see some of them
vary based on the model.

113
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.325
Right.
I would wonder if there are like specialty

114
00:06:25.325 --> 00:06:30.670
ones that could theoretically have
a few more categories as well, right?

115
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.007
Phone numbers are interesting too,

116
00:06:32.007 --> 00:06:33.910
because at what point is
that actually just a regex?

117
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:34.510
Unclear.

118
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.591
But as I joked about myself earlier,

119
00:06:38.591 --> 00:06:43.150
then revert back to my younger self,
I know how to regex that one.

120
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.342
&gt;&gt; Male: What's the smart way to store
entities after you harvest them or

121
00:06:46.342 --> 00:06:47.710
retrieve them out of text?

122
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.070
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
I guess what are you trying to do, right?

123
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.769
&gt;&gt; Male: Let's say you have
more of an interactive app and

124
00:06:50.769 --> 00:06:53.910
you wanna make sure you're not doing all
of the same work over and over again.

125
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.670
Like, is that something you'd handle
at the app level or is there.

126
00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.308
Are there constructs that work with LLMs
where it's like, hey, this is in context,

127
00:07:00.308 --> 00:07:02.950
the entities we're
talking about previously.

128
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.870
Is it kinda flagging the data?

129
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:05.587
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, I mean,

130
00:07:05.587 --> 00:07:08.190
I think that becomes like
a data storage caching thing.

131
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.710
Right?

132
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.870
Like, that's where my mind
immediately jumps to.

133
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.630
Right?
I would probably, don't hold me to this.

134
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.830
My immediate answer is like,
I would like hash the initial input.

135
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.030
Have I processed this before?

136
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.340
If so, pull what I have already,
so on and so forth.

137
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.054
That is the initial place my mind
jumps to, which is hash it, cache it,

138
00:07:31.054 --> 00:07:33.820
and then pull it out again if I needed it.

139
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.580
And then what do you do with that data?

140
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.864
Are you trying to count how many
times the United nations is

141
00:07:39.864 --> 00:07:43.020
mentioned across the thing?

142
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.125
I think then it depends on what
application you're trying to build or

143
00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:48.380
what are you processing data,
so on and so forth.

144
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.210
But yeah, as you can see, like, even stuff
like half counts as a percent, right?

145
00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.536
And likely when we look at how attention
works, it will be half in that context,

146
00:08:00.536 --> 00:08:03.970
and we'll see how that works
in a little bit as well.
