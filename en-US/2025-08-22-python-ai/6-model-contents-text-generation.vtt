00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.320
&gt;&gt; Male: I had one other question.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.160
Just what is the model format?

3
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.225
Or when you're downloading
it from Hugging Face,

4
00:00:05.225 --> 00:00:07.200
what does that actually look like on disk?

5
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.720
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I mean, you could see.

6
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.480
Can we actually.

7
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.400
I don't know where it hides it.

8
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.560
Here it is in a lot of ways, a bunch of
tensors and weights and stuff like that.

9
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.040
It's not a file that you want to go
digging through yourself, per se.

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.200
And you probably saw if I scroll up,
I don't see it anymore.

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.460
But you'll see when it's downloading
stuff, because I cleared the console,

12
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.785
it'll download these things called safe
tensors, which are ones that they've

13
00:00:30.785 --> 00:00:35.370
scrubbed for arbitrary code execution and
stuff along those lines.

14
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.652
But as we get into how
some of these models work,

15
00:00:38.652 --> 00:00:43.577
there were also just a series of numbers
because all this text is getting

16
00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:47.210
turned into numbers and
then back out to text again.

17
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.130
So yeah, you can go in depending on
where it puts it on your machine.

18
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.970
You could also Literjit if you
go to the Hugging Face website.

19
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.390
We go into Models, I'm pretty sure.

20
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.550
Let's just grab a random one,
Go into files and versions.

21
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.990
You can go poke around and
see some of these are probably huge, but

22
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.910
you can actually not even on your machine.

23
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.436
You can go in for a given model and see
all of the files that would have gotten

24
00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:19.150
downloaded onto your machine,
so on and so forth.

25
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.476
Obviously, Quinn 30 billion parameters
are that sweet spot where they're

26
00:01:24.476 --> 00:01:29.802
obviously not as big as something like
whatever OpenAI or Anthropic is using,

27
00:01:29.802 --> 00:01:34.643
but that sweet spot where if you
are a developer with the laptop that most

28
00:01:34.643 --> 00:01:40.288
developers might have with a decent amount
of RAM and a decent amount of disk space,

29
00:01:40.288 --> 00:01:46.460
this is the size of an open source model
that you could 100% run on your machine.

30
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.780
&gt;&gt; Male: And it looks like it's four gigs.

31
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.580
Is this like a packed format
where it'll unzip or like.

32
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.620
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: No, a lot of times,
like that one maybe is probably four gigs.

33
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.820
Some of them are like quantized.

34
00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.842
And so quantize is like effectively,
you know, there's both how many

35
00:02:00.842 --> 00:02:07.100
parameters you have and then like
effectively how big are the floats, right?

36
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.620
So like they'll change in size, but
like a lot of times they might.

37
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.020
They take a lot more RAM than that.

38
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.180
Like, disk space is usually not going to
be the thing that you're crying about.

39
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.310
It is going to be ram.

40
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.870
Especially if you have a Mac where
you don't have a GPU per se.

41
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.230
You have that integrated CPU and
GPU and they share the memory.

42
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.430
You just think about it in terms of ram,
that will be where your pain is felt.

43
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.790
And you can change different settings and
do stuff to tweak that as well.

44
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.332
So moving down to text generation,
which is the second one we talked about,

45
00:02:38.332 --> 00:02:42.150
again, they are all
effectively that same method.

46
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.647
I actually did not necessarily have
to import it a second time, but

47
00:02:45.647 --> 00:02:48.457
I think in the beginning ones
it made sense to do that,

48
00:02:48.457 --> 00:02:51.768
where if we just give it the first
argument as text generation,

49
00:02:51.768 --> 00:02:54.840
again, we don't necessarily
need to give it that model.

50
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.983
It will choose a default, but

51
00:02:55.983 --> 00:02:59.240
I would kinda want it to also
expose what the defaults were.

52
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.126
So if we wanna,
instead of sentiment analysis,

53
00:03:01.126 --> 00:03:03.480
actually I wanna do text generation.

54
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.381
We can do that same function,
just a different first argument,

55
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:11.760
and you will get a text
generator function.

56
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.140
At this point,
there's all sorts of little knobs.

57
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.660
You can tweak that.

58
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.940
We'll tweak some of them later.

59
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.540
But showing you every knob
in the beginning felt rude.

60
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.060
So here we've got kind of like
partial sentences, right?

61
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.285
And you will see that we will have to do
some stuff over our time together to make

62
00:03:29.285 --> 00:03:33.120
this kind of do the thing that we want
because it gives you a little bit of

63
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.100
appreciating how some of
these other tools work.

64
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.340
So here are a bunch of sentences.

65
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.931
And again, text generation is the one
that we think about when we think about

66
00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:46.665
Gemini and Claude and chatgpt, but all
it does is based on the previous words,

67
00:03:46.665 --> 00:03:51.370
guess what the next word should be or
punctuation or should I stop talking?

68
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.930
Or something along those lines, right?

69
00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:01.000
And again, the wild thing is, it's like
using GPT2 gives you a deep appreciation,

70
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.650
I think, for
how far some of these things have come.

71
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.526
So we kind of create that pipeline,
this text generator function, and

72
00:04:10.526 --> 00:04:13.340
then when we call it,
we have some options that we can pass in.

73
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.871
And again, when you see that equal sign is
very much like having the last argument in

74
00:04:17.871 --> 00:04:21.821
JavaScript be an object, where you
just define the other properties and

75
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:26.286
the first one being the first argument, so
on and so forth, where we will then take

76
00:04:26.286 --> 00:04:30.169
our array of prompts, we'll go
through each prompt, I'll print it,

77
00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.130
console log it, print it first we're going
to say like, give me about 100 new tokens.

78
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.690
And you're like, what is a token?

79
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.690
It's kind of like a piece of a word.

80
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.730
We will talk about
tokenization at length later.

81
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.690
But the good enough for right now
version is that it is a piece of a word.

82
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.890
And then we talked a little bit
before about that temperature, right?

83
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.410
Temperature can go.

84
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.282
It starts at zero and it's basically
if you give it a temperature of zero,

85
00:04:58.282 --> 00:05:03.170
it will always pick the most likely
next word, no matter what, right?

86
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.317
The higher you bump up that number, and
we can bump it up, we can play around

87
00:05:08.317 --> 00:05:13.250
with it a little bit, the more creative
it will get about this, right?

88
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.890
And there are some other
ways to tweak that as well.

89
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.850
Do you want it to pick from
the 50 most likely words?

90
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.770
Do you want to.

91
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.130
How exactly you wanted to choose?

92
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.941
Some of that are also other parameters
that we will definitely see and

93
00:05:25.941 --> 00:05:26.770
talk about as well.

94
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.982
But let's go.
Let's play around with it and

95
00:05:29.982 --> 00:05:32.440
let's tweak some stuff in here and
let's see how it goes for us.

96
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.520
So we'll go ahead, we'll hit play.

97
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.040
It is gonna pull down the model.

98
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.120
So arguably, one could argue that
I should have hit that button.

99
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.160
But it's a tiny little model.

100
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.320
It'll take about a second or two.

101
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.120
Cool, cool, cool.

102
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.040
I mean, even this model is,
GPT2 is 548 megabytes.

103
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.120
So that's interesting.

104
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.050
And you can see that they
are like not super good, right?

105
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.668
And we will learn how to make them better
and we'll learn about fine tuning if you

106
00:06:01.668 --> 00:06:03.890
want it in a certain format and
all of that stuff.

107
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.148
But for our first flight into this,
you can see one,

108
00:06:07.148 --> 00:06:11.090
that the sentence will just end
when it hits that 100 words.

109
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.890
That one happened to work, but
it will just kind of generate.

110
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:21.160
Yeah, there kind of stops
magically as it goes through.

111
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.440
So, yeah, future of artificial is at hand.

112
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.640
And if it makes a breakthrough, it will
have a huge impact on everyday life.

113
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.800
The world will be far more connected and
more connected.

114
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.595
It is not good, particularly one, because
of GPT 2 and 2, because we have not done

115
00:06:35.595 --> 00:06:38.120
any of the important work that
we'll do in a little bit.

116
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.680
But it is kind of interesting.

117
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.040
You can see probably what some of
the source material was there as well.

118
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.194
Or the clickbait blog posts
that were definitely fed into

119
00:06:55.194 --> 00:07:01.220
this thing are all very apparent,
particularly with the early.

120
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:06.260
It's like a lot of fun, honestly, just to
kind of see sometimes how bad it will be.

121
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.340
But we'll learn how to make it better too.

122
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.160
Cool.
So the text generation,

123
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.540
we can tweak some of these.

124
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.770
What happens, for instance, if we turn
the temperature down to like zero?

125
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.130
So I can just do that.

126
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.250
I can hit play.

127
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.290
It's angry with me.

128
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.770
Zero might have been too much.

129
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:29.730
It needs to be a float.

130
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.293
Can you tell that he's usually
a JavaScript engineer and

131
00:07:34.293 --> 00:07:36.370
just treats all numbers as the same.

132
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.250
Get a 0.1.

133
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.260
And now you can see that no matter what,
it'll hit the hundred tokens.

134
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.820
But it is going to give me effectively
the same thing over and over again.

135
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.260
It will show no creativity whatsoever.

136
00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:02.620
Each time it, [LAUGH] that's gonna be
my new motto from now on, by the way.

137
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.860
The future of artificial intelligence
is uncertain, but it is a possibility.

138
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:13.990
That is going to be my official stance
when my in laws ask me about AI.

139
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.670
So as you can see though,
other than when it hits the max token,

140
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.150
it shows no creativity whatsoever.

141
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.350
It's not picking a different
word every time.

142
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:30.611
Given the same initial sentence,
it will, it will go ahead and

143
00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:35.774
just say the same thing over and
over and over again versus if,

144
00:08:35.774 --> 00:08:42.949
let's say we turn this up to a 1.0,
you're like, well, I want creativity.

145
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:46.509
With creativity comes hallucinations,
right?

146
00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:49.664
The more creative liberty you get
on a wider range of what the next

147
00:08:49.664 --> 00:08:50.429
word could be.

148
00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:54.342
Because if you think about it, it's
guessing what the next word is going to be

149
00:08:54.342 --> 00:08:57.715
and then for the word after that,
it's using the previous words,

150
00:08:57.715 --> 00:09:01.189
including that word it just guessed,
to come up with the next one.

151
00:09:01.189 --> 00:09:04.246
So the more creative license
you give it for the one word,

152
00:09:04.246 --> 00:09:07.190
you can see as this gets
exponentially out of control.

153
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.565
Let's see, the fun part about this is you
never actually know what's going to happen

154
00:09:11.565 --> 00:09:12.550
when you hit the button.

155
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:22.070
So very quickly it starts to turn into
a motivational graduation speech.

156
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.612
In this case,

157
00:09:22.612 --> 00:09:25.590
the future of artificial intelligence
is only a small part of the future.

158
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.590
The rest is to come and it moves on
to I am honored to be part of the new

159
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.590
generation of entrepreneurs
that I know and love.

160
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.094
So at this point, I guess there
were enough words that it generated

161
00:09:35.094 --> 00:09:37.785
randomly that it started to
go off the road rails and

162
00:09:37.785 --> 00:09:41.890
believe that it was giving some
kind of graduation speech.

163
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:46.690
Here it's in the middle of a list article,
so on and so forth.

164
00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:51.605
So as you can see, you can tweak a lot
of these and there are implications for

165
00:09:51.605 --> 00:09:53.490
both as you kind of go along.

166
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.530
And that's true when we get to images too,
right?

167
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.386
You can see how much do you want
to deviate from a given image or

168
00:09:58.386 --> 00:10:00.130
a prompt to get to different things.

169
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.810
And what's the answer?

170
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.700
It's the answer is always in these cases.

171
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.500
It depends.

172
00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.784
Unfortunately, when you have a thing
where it is effectively randomness,

173
00:10:09.784 --> 00:10:11.996
which is the knob that you're turning,

174
00:10:11.996 --> 00:10:15.460
experimentation is effectively
the only way as we go through.

175
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.780
So yeah, one is that they do
continue going versus going.

176
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.060
It is positive or negative.

177
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.660
It can handle most things
depending on what it's trained on.

178
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.599
And like I said, you can like we think
a lot about when we talk about using AI,

179
00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:36.140
like, I'm gonna grab Claude,
I'm gonna grab Gemini.

180
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.174
But sometimes the right answer might
be taking a very small model and

181
00:10:40.174 --> 00:10:41.980
fine tuning it.

182
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.580
And we'll see how to do
that in a little bit.

183
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.620
Fine tuning it to just give
you the things that you want.

184
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:51.100
It's got some base knowledge and then you
can add in the rest of the stuff that

185
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:56.000
you want for exactly how long the strings
should be, what format they should be in,

186
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.130
so on and so forth.

187
00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:02.370
The nice part is like you can do that
all with these tools incredibly easily.

188
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:07.198
And even on, like again we are going to
constrain ourselves until I get impatient

189
00:11:07.198 --> 00:11:09.330
towards the end of this.

190
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.610
But everything we can do,
we can do on the free tier of this.

191
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.530
Everything we're gonna
do is on effectively.

192
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.597
Either things you could run on your
laptop, if you had patience for

193
00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:25.314
the image stuff, you could run it on
your laptop, just like, I don't know,

194
00:11:25.314 --> 00:11:27.440
like go out for the day or go to bed.

195
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.607
But like generally speaking, all of this
is stuff that is relatively low resource,

196
00:11:32.607 --> 00:11:35.000
not very resource intensive.

197
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.393
So some of the parameters that
we had in there, the max length,

198
00:11:38.393 --> 00:11:41.800
how many tokens,
that includes the original prompt, right?

199
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.680
In all of these cases.

200
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.545
Because otherwise if you do not give it
one, it will just keep going so on and

201
00:11:49.545 --> 00:11:50.790
so forth, right?

202
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:55.190
Like how many sequences
we want to respond with.

203
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:59.131
So like we didn't set that one,
we did say what we wanted to end and

204
00:11:59.131 --> 00:12:01.150
we'll see what these are later.

205
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:05.382
Which is like there are special magical
tokens in there that are not just words

206
00:12:05.382 --> 00:12:08.390
that are like end of sentence
stuff along those lines.

207
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.270
So yeah,
we have got some of those put in place.

208
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.990
But yeah,
you can say how many tokens that you want.

209
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:20.237
The number of possibilities you
want to generate at a given time,

210
00:12:20.237 --> 00:12:23.557
the temperature,
which is that kind of creativity,

211
00:12:23.557 --> 00:12:27.860
low values are gonna give you the words
that you think are gonna come.

212
00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.020
Like mediums will give you some
amount of creativity in there.

213
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.067
And after you go past the 1.0 mark,
now you're just having fun right now,

214
00:12:36.067 --> 00:12:40.500
you're not being responsible and you just
wanna see the world burn, that's fine.
