00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.100
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: With that let's actually
play with them now that we've got

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.000
like the Tor locked into our heads.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.616
So a few tasting notes which is
I will kind of guide you towards

4
00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:15.680
where to get your Hugging Face token.

5
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.960
But before that let's do
the housekeeping of the day.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.676
Is everything that we're gonna talk
about is in one of these Google Colab

7
00:00:23.676 --> 00:00:27.850
notebooks which is, yeah,
if you ever use a Jupyter notebook or

8
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.900
Python notebook,
you have seen something like this before.

9
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.308
So we'll kind of work through some
of those so we can see some code and

10
00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:42.276
tweak some code and mess around with some
code and you can make your own copies of

11
00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:46.860
these, do whatever you want with them,
so on and so forth.

12
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.340
But you will probably not immediately but
it makes sense to do it now.

13
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.240
Probably need some kind of hugging
face token at some point or another.

14
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.600
So let's talk about that.

15
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.348
So with that we can just
go to huggingface.co, and

16
00:01:02.348 --> 00:01:06.320
it gives a whole bunch of
really interesting stuff here.

17
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.640
There are data sets of
all sorts of wild stuff.

18
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.337
I was bored looking at it last night and
there's just a bunch of really fun

19
00:01:14.337 --> 00:01:18.270
things in here and we will see
when we get to fine tuning that.

20
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.143
You could probably find some
interesting data sets and

21
00:01:21.143 --> 00:01:23.830
make some curious things along the way.

22
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.816
They also have models which we will
be using the kind of the small,

23
00:01:28.816 --> 00:01:33.532
easy to download, definitely run
the free tier Colab ones but

24
00:01:33.532 --> 00:01:37.794
you can pull in open source
models that are ginormous and

25
00:01:37.794 --> 00:01:42.963
be able to pull down and effectively
if you've got the video card and

26
00:01:42.963 --> 00:01:47.859
the RAM for it and the space on
your computer, pull in models that

27
00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:53.027
are not going to make Claude Opus
blush but are kind of impressive for

28
00:01:53.027 --> 00:01:59.100
something that you just downloaded and
are running on your machine as well.

29
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.068
But the thing that we care about
today is going into our account and

30
00:02:04.068 --> 00:02:08.780
going down to access tokens and
creating a new token, right?

31
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.470
We're not gonna push anything up today.

32
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.310
So really you could get away
with just a read token.

33
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.688
If you think that you, you know, like the
responsible thing to tell you is you know,

34
00:02:19.688 --> 00:02:23.819
least access principle, get the smallest
token you can get away with, so on and

35
00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:24.390
so forth.

36
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.350
I'm not gonna tell you do
whatever you want, right?

37
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.590
If you think you're gonna wanna
push up some of your models.

38
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.141
Cause one thing you can do is
when we fine tune a model,

39
00:02:32.141 --> 00:02:35.774
you could theoretically it's like
the whole idea of like git and forking and

40
00:02:35.774 --> 00:02:39.980
stuff like that, you can pull down a model
you can fine tune it based on a data set.

41
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.828
Whether it's a data set you pulled out
from Hugging Face or one that you maybe

42
00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:49.020
have some corpus of your own logs or
something along those lines.

43
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.380
And then you can push up
your own model as well.

44
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.620
You do need the write access
to push up to hugging face.

45
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.940
So you decide what you wanna do there.

46
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.900
You can get away with solely a read token.

47
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.096
And then once you have that token, which
I already have, and I don't feel like

48
00:03:08.096 --> 00:03:12.950
broadcasting a brand new token to all y',
all, you can go into this first notebook.

49
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.957
So if you go here pipeline basics and
you can go this little key,

50
00:03:16.957 --> 00:03:18.870
that key means secrets.

51
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.830
If you hover over it,
it says the word secrets.

52
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.030
You can go in there and
you can add your secret.

53
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.550
You don't actually need
to even do any of this.

54
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.910
Like if the library needs it,
like a lot of the hugging face SDKs for

55
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.510
various things will seek to go looking for
this environment variable.

56
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.690
So it does need to be named HF_TOKEN,
right?

57
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.319
And you can pop it in there and then you
can basically decide if a notebook does or

58
00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.890
does not have access to it, right?

59
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.050
In this case I do.

60
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.068
But you pop that in there and that should
be basically if I've done my job well,

61
00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:55.090
which unclear.

62
00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.370
It's like one of those things of all
plans are good until you face the enemy.

63
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.410
Or as Mike Tyson put it, everyone has
a plan until they get punched in the face.

64
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.810
So ideally that should be all
of the setup that you need.

65
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.650
But we'll find out together if that's
not true and we'll deal with it.

66
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.634
The other piece that I alluded to earlier
mostly again that was in the slide, so

67
00:04:17.634 --> 00:04:22.692
I didn't forget to mention it now, is if
you do need to change the runtime type,

68
00:04:22.692 --> 00:04:25.210
you don't have as many options as I do.

69
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.868
Unless you want to open your wallet,

70
00:04:26.868 --> 00:04:29.010
which then you will have
as many options as I do.

71
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.620
Because the only reason I got
those options is cause I paid.

72
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.580
You should have the CPU and this T4 GPU.

73
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.969
TPU for those keeping track at
home is a Tensor processing unit,

74
00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.740
which is I think something Google makes.

75
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.860
But we don't need those today.

76
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.860
We need for some cases a GPU,
for some a CPU.

77
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.508
I'm gonna stick with the GPUs today,

78
00:04:51.508 --> 00:04:55.580
mostly because no one wants to
see my entire thing be slow.

79
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.065
So if at any given point, and
if you wanted to write R or Julia instead,

80
00:05:01.065 --> 00:05:02.290
those are options.

81
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.130
I'm not going to do those options.

82
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.490
And if you've never used
a Jupyter notebook before.

83
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.859
That's okay, too, because as I begin to
kind of show you some of these, I will,

84
00:05:13.859 --> 00:05:16.690
like, take you on a little tour, right?

85
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.090
They are really, they're really cool.

86
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.970
Now, let's do the immature
part of the show first.

87
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.804
I'll show this to you now and
I guarantee you will all do it,

88
00:05:24.804 --> 00:05:27.770
because I only turned
this off this morning.

89
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:28.810
Go into settings.

90
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.730
You got a bunch of settings in here.

91
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.781
Whether or not you want Gemini
to help you with things,

92
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:37.690
you can actually hook it up to GitHub.

93
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.210
So you can either pull in notebooks or
push them out to GitHub.

94
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.850
Miscellaneous is where the magic is.

95
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.637
In Miscellaneous,

96
00:05:46.637 --> 00:05:51.260
you have really two important settings
I actually don't know how to see.

97
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.362
If you check multiple of these boxes,
you have your power level,

98
00:05:55.362 --> 00:05:59.100
where you can choose no power,
some power, or many power.

99
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.140
This one I would recommend caution with.

100
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.659
Let's pick that for a moment, and
then you can engage in either Corgi mode,

101
00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:09.420
kitty mode, or Crab mode.

102
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.401
Despite how much time I've been spending
in Google Collab later, it didn't

103
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:17.460
occur lately, it did not occur to me that
I could turn more than one of these on.

104
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.450
I thought it was a binary choice.

105
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.330
I have been rocking kitty mode again up
until 10 minutes before I left today.

106
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.250
But I will show you what both of these do.

107
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.410
And you hit Save.

108
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.373
And now you go down into your notebook and

109
00:06:32.373 --> 00:06:34.810
let's say we wanna find a given section,
right?

110
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.010
So you got some markdown in here.

111
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.821
And I can say, as you can see,
it is both shaking and

112
00:06:39.821 --> 00:06:42.490
shooting out various explosions.

113
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.184
And that is the power mode.

114
00:06:46.184 --> 00:06:50.222
You see, I got a combo down there
from the typing, at some point,

115
00:06:50.222 --> 00:06:53.496
I expected some cats to be
walking around the top.

116
00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:54.120
There they are.

117
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.960
So I'm gonna turn that off because
it's incredibly distracting.

118
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.200
But be very clear.

119
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.280
I keep power mode off.

120
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.400
I keep the kitties on, right?

121
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:12.200
And there are some important downsides
that I should make you aware of.

122
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.867
If you are working and your,
you know, friends, family, partner,

123
00:07:16.867 --> 00:07:21.854
spouse, whoever walks in and
you're trying to convince them that you're

124
00:07:21.854 --> 00:07:26.070
doing real serious work,
it will undermine that, all right?

125
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:31.145
At one point, preparing for this,
I was rendering images of Mu Dang

126
00:07:31.145 --> 00:07:36.576
the Pygmy Hippo whilst having cats
walking across the top on a Saturday,

127
00:07:36.576 --> 00:07:39.710
convincing my wife that I was doing work.

128
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.240
I think she believed me, but I think there
was some hesitation in there as well.

129
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.680
You can turn those settings on,
you cannot turn those settings on.

130
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.266
Some other tasting notes as you can see,
effectively,

131
00:07:53.266 --> 00:07:58.301
all jupyter notebook is is pieces of
code intermixed with pieces of markdown,

132
00:07:58.301 --> 00:08:02.560
which is basically my love
language to begin with.

133
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.710
They do run in sequential order.

134
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.228
Now you can hit something like Run all,

135
00:08:08.228 --> 00:08:10.950
which will run the first code block
followed by the second code block.

136
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:14.310
You can also choose to just
run a given code block.

137
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.895
The one thing that I will warn you,

138
00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:23.250
because it will bite you at some point
today, is if you get really into it and

139
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.840
you forget to run the code block
where the variable is declared,

140
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.835
it will not be in memory, but
you can run the first one and

141
00:08:31.835 --> 00:08:37.210
then it's loaded into memory in the
runtime and then you can run one later.

142
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.210
And if you don't change anything in
the first one, you can change stuff.

143
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:41.610
It's actually a really great way to work.

144
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.250
You can also, if you use VS code or
cursor, something like that,

145
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.690
Python notebooks will
open in there as well.

146
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.810
You can literally use
this in VS code as well.

147
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:55.290
The only reason we're not
doing that is again, GPUs.

148
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.010
You need to auth separately to do that.

149
00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.210
Or can you just open it?

150
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.710
You can just open it.

151
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:08.070
You can go over to file Download,
download, download it.

152
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.392
The only thing is, occasionally I use,

153
00:09:11.392 --> 00:09:15.510
there's a library in Colab
called Google Colab.

154
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:20.243
The only feature I use is Output clear and
that won't work,

155
00:09:20.243 --> 00:09:24.790
but there's a different
Python version as well.

156
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.804
As you can see, this library is exclusive
to the Google Colab notebooks, but

157
00:09:28.804 --> 00:09:33.230
there is literally one in the IPython
library that will also clear the output.

158
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.027
But if there's a big PIP install
that's a version of npm,

159
00:09:36.027 --> 00:09:39.220
I don't want to see that in the notebook
and have to scroll past it,

160
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.630
especially as I'm zoomed
in a little bit as well.

161
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.323
For instance,
if you want to run a given code block,

162
00:09:47.323 --> 00:09:51.630
you just hit that little plus sign and
it will begin to run.

163
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.670
There's a little tax you pay at
the very beginning as you go and

164
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.470
get what we call a runtime.

165
00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:01.198
Remember we hit change runtime and you can
switch between a cpu, a gpu, so on and

166
00:10:01.198 --> 00:10:01.710
so forth.

167
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:08.804
It will kind of give you a virtual
machine somewhere in the cloud and

168
00:10:08.804 --> 00:10:10.730
then begin to run it.

169
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.560
And you can kind of see, for instance,
like what your resources are, so on and

170
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.090
so forth.

171
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:19.525
So like I am on the T4,
which is available on the free plan, and

172
00:10:19.525 --> 00:10:25.650
I think I don't have the high RAM version
right, so you get like 15 gigs of RAM or.

173
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.071
Yeah, 12 gigs of system RAM,
15 gigs of GPU and

174
00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:33.460
like a quarter terabyte of disk space,
which is pretty nice.

175
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.940
Dustin, are you able to
connect a local gpu?

176
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.140
Yes.

177
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.340
Good questions already.

178
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.820
Where is it?

179
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:45.245
Yes, connect to a local runtime or
if you have like some Google Compute

180
00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:49.300
engine VM that you want to connect to,
you can use that as well.

181
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.420
But you can, yeah,
hit connect to a local runtime.

182
00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.070
You have to do some other like fun
stuff to like spin that server up.

183
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.390
But you can 100%.

184
00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.989
So if you have fancy GPUs on your
computer, you're sitting there with

185
00:11:01.989 --> 00:11:06.259
like a rig when you just finished mining a
bunch of crypto and you're ready to like,

186
00:11:06.259 --> 00:11:08.470
you know, switch to the new hotness.

187
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:12.710
You can also do that as well and
harness all of that power too.

188
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.250
Cool.

189
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.681
The other one or two other just tasting
notes as we're in here is you can,

190
00:11:19.681 --> 00:11:23.260
I think I have turned this
on almost all the time.

191
00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.860
Is automatically run the first cell or
section.

192
00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.700
Any execution.

193
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:32.460
That's as you see, the first cell for me
is importing any libraries that we need.

194
00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.300
So it will run that first one as well.

195
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.580
Then it will save your outputs.

196
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.489
The one thing I'm going to do for

197
00:11:39.489 --> 00:11:43.180
future viewers is I'm going to
open mine in playground mode.

198
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:47.115
You do not need to that way I'm not
doing the thing that I have done at

199
00:11:47.115 --> 00:11:50.280
workshops in the past where
I edit everything live and

200
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.890
then have to go clean up
my mess after the workshop.

201
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:59.730
At one point I will forget to do that and
I will have to clean up my mess.

202
00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:04.450
But it's the beginning of the day and
I still remember my good habits.

203
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.490
Cool, cool, cool.

204
00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.085
All right, so like I said before,

205
00:12:07.085 --> 00:12:10.930
you can also hit Run all if you just
wanna run everything, so on and so forth.

206
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.886
But that is the kind of high level
of these Google Colab/Jupyter

207
00:12:15.886 --> 00:12:18.930
notebooks that we're gonna be using.

208
00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:24.004
Other things that come up in my
head are at some point or another,

209
00:12:24.004 --> 00:12:28.495
particularly on the free plan, you will
get yelled at where it's like, hey,

210
00:12:28.495 --> 00:12:32.810
person who's not paying us,
you want to spin up another runtime?

211
00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.330
And you already have one running, right?

212
00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:40.429
As we jump from the first notebook to
the second notebook, you can hit this fun

213
00:12:40.429 --> 00:12:45.850
little thing up here, hit manage sessions
and you can close out another session.

214
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.055
Yeah, so if you get yelled on
the free plan and you're like,

215
00:12:51.055 --> 00:12:52.660
now I don't know what to do?

216
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.180
That's what you do.

217
00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.620
How do you find out which version of
Python's running in the jupyter notebook.

218
00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.660
I mean, you've got a terminal and
you've got the ability to just ask Python.

219
00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.020
I know that it's 3.11.

220
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.860
So yeah, there's that as well.

221
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.990
There might even be an interesting
place to go see it, but

222
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.220
I don't remember off the top of my head.

223
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.670
Right, cool, cool, cool.

224
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:17.990
Yeah, you got a terminal down here.

225
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.278
The other cool thing,
we don't have any yet, but

226
00:13:21.278 --> 00:13:25.990
as variables are declared in memory,
you can see them all here as well.

227
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:31.270
So you can kind of see the entire
what's going on so on and so forth.

228
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:35.664
And if you ever break something, this
little guy down here is Toggle Gemini,

229
00:13:35.664 --> 00:13:38.990
where you can be like,
there's two really great things.

230
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.440
There's obviously like,
explain this error.

231
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.920
There's like transform my code, but
there's also explain this code to me.

232
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.080
So I definitely encourage you.

233
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:53.080
It lives both up here, down there,
lots of other places as well.

234
00:13:54.680 --> 00:14:01.560
Cool, so with that kind of tour,
we probably wanna get into it.
