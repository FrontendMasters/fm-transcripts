00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.300
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We think a lot about.

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.157
With text,
we think a lot about I ask question or

3
00:00:05.157 --> 00:00:09.200
do prompt ChatGPT give response, right?

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.480
And that is a very popular paradigm.

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.760
Right, but it is not the only one and it
is one that we will work with a lot today.

6
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.206
But I did want to introduce a few other
ones because they have practical purposes,

7
00:00:23.206 --> 00:00:27.910
and when we see the code, you'll see that,
like, I could just, like, there might be

8
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.854
a use case for this in my application
that I could just use like tomorrow.

9
00:00:31.854 --> 00:00:34.118
And it is not a heavy lift.

10
00:00:34.118 --> 00:00:35.820
So I think it is the responsible and

11
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.357
practical choice to kind
of go through all of them.

12
00:00:38.357 --> 00:00:42.317
I will say one more time that
especially for all the tech stuff,

13
00:00:42.317 --> 00:00:44.419
there's also a TypeScript SDK.

14
00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:49.041
And I understand that you are tuned
into frontendmasters.com and so

15
00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:53.024
the likelihood that you are at
one point touch JavaScript or

16
00:00:53.024 --> 00:00:56.222
TypeScript during your
day to day life is high.

17
00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:58.800
All of these concepts apply there as well.

18
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.883
And honestly, the syntax isn't
all that much different and

19
00:01:01.883 --> 00:01:05.153
the APIs are all the same from
the libraries, so on and so forth.

20
00:01:05.153 --> 00:01:09.789
Even if you're like, that's cool,
but I don't have Python in my app,

21
00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:14.352
it's okay, you can just do the same
basic thing in TypeScript as well.

22
00:01:14.352 --> 00:01:16.960
So one of the things we can
do is sentiment analysis.

23
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.188
This is like the hello world of any kind,
machine learning kind of stuff,

24
00:01:23.188 --> 00:01:27.117
which is you take words and
you give it a score.

25
00:01:27.117 --> 00:01:30.736
Are these happy words or sad words?

26
00:01:30.736 --> 00:01:34.207
And there's like nuance there, right?

27
00:01:34.207 --> 00:01:38.841
In simple, like sentiment analysis,
simple, easy,

28
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:43.178
great, not good with nuance
insofar like sarcasm,

29
00:01:43.178 --> 00:01:47.236
which I have employed one or
two times in my life.

30
00:01:47.236 --> 00:01:49.522
It's not great with that.

31
00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:54.726
And we'll see how stuff like
Transformers handle that and why

32
00:01:54.726 --> 00:02:01.542
ChatGPT is better with my sass than the
basic sentiment analysis that we look at.

33
00:02:01.542 --> 00:02:05.108
But it is kind of the first and
foremost easiest kind of

34
00:02:05.108 --> 00:02:10.360
way to wrap our heads around to
making sure any of our setup works.

35
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.806
So we'll take a look at
sentiment analysis, but

36
00:02:13.806 --> 00:02:19.110
then we get to kind of the popular kid
in school, which is text generation.

37
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.711
And I call this one out
specifically because for

38
00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:29.240
a lot of us it is the one we
think about first and foremost.

39
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.233
But some of these other ones that
we'll look at after this one, we'll be

40
00:02:33.233 --> 00:02:37.631
like that must be how ChatGPT or Gemini or
Claude or what have you deepseek work.

41
00:02:37.631 --> 00:02:39.704
No, text generation is
predominantly the one.

42
00:02:39.704 --> 00:02:42.786
I use some interesting
techniques in order to do that.

43
00:02:42.786 --> 00:02:47.675
And some of the other tools we're
gonna see are just not dissimilar, but

44
00:02:47.675 --> 00:02:50.417
approaching it from a different angle.

45
00:02:50.417 --> 00:02:53.003
Right, and
I will say this again in a little bit,

46
00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:55.728
I'll say this a whole bunch
of times today in fact.

47
00:02:55.728 --> 00:02:58.510
So why not set expectations
where they belong?

48
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.327
When we think about AI in terms
of ChatGPT and Gemini and Claude,

49
00:03:04.327 --> 00:03:08.999
it is a very sophisticated mathematical
model that is just guessing what

50
00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:10.780
the next word probably is.

51
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.787
So if you've ever lied to your parents,
you, you know exactly how this works.

52
00:03:15.787 --> 00:03:18.960
And so that is effectively how
most of these models work.

53
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.480
And it's incredibly sophisticated
in how they do that.

54
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.796
But like at the end of the day,
that's how it goes down.

55
00:03:25.796 --> 00:03:29.798
We'll see lots of different parameters
in there, but there's a few interesting

56
00:03:29.798 --> 00:03:33.747
things, like how many new tokens, like
how much new text do we want to generate.

57
00:03:33.747 --> 00:03:39.283
The really interesting one
is this idea of temperature,

58
00:03:39.283 --> 00:03:43.665
which we'll play with both numerous times,

59
00:03:43.665 --> 00:03:47.026
which is if the idea is that an LLM.

60
00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:51.835
Or what have you guesses
what the next most likely

61
00:03:51.835 --> 00:03:56.879
word is it always picking
the exact next most likely

62
00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.870
word would get you the same
output every time.

63
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.344
And occasionally maybe
that's what you want.

64
00:04:05.344 --> 00:04:11.460
A lot of times you need a little bit of
creativity or spiciness in there as well.

65
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.982
And then if you ever from hugging
face you can pull down legit models,

66
00:04:17.982 --> 00:04:23.493
ones that are coming in at depending on
how much room you have on your computer,

67
00:04:23.493 --> 00:04:25.853
how much ram, so on and so forth.

68
00:04:25.853 --> 00:04:30.731
Ones that are thousands of parameters,
up to 105 billion parameters, so

69
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:31.787
on and so forth.

70
00:04:31.787 --> 00:04:36.109
And so with those open source models that
you can pull down from hugging face,

71
00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:40.364
a lot of these concepts and tools that
we see when you're running a full on LLM

72
00:04:40.364 --> 00:04:42.313
are like knobs that you can tweak.

73
00:04:42.313 --> 00:04:46.188
So I think it's kind of fun to learn
exactly what those knobs mean,

74
00:04:46.188 --> 00:04:50.428
see them in small cases and realize
that they apply to the bigger models.

75
00:04:50.428 --> 00:04:54.931
The only difference with stuff like
the hosted ones, like ChatGPT, Gemini, and

76
00:04:54.931 --> 00:04:57.816
Claude, is that they have the knobs and
you don't.

77
00:04:57.816 --> 00:05:01.830
But those knobs exist in all
of the other models as well.

78
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.190
It's just that they're abstracted
away from you on the hosted services.

79
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.850
And then, yeah, how many, you can generate
multiple different ones, multiple

80
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.790
different responses and text generation
and then pick which one you want.

81
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.321
And so you could start to do interesting
things here as you build up the building

82
00:05:18.321 --> 00:05:22.527
blocks, which is we've only talked
about two of the modalities so far.

83
00:05:22.527 --> 00:05:27.061
But you could see like, hey, I want to
maybe generate five different strings

84
00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:31.732
of text, and then I'm going to send them
an analysis to see which one is the least

85
00:05:31.732 --> 00:05:35.170
sassy or the most positive
is a better way to put it.

86
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.557
So you begin to stack these
things in interesting ways, and

87
00:05:38.557 --> 00:05:43.094
I would love your brain to start churning
on some of these things now as we begin to

88
00:05:43.094 --> 00:05:44.330
see some of the rest.

89
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.650
Because any given one, cool.

90
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.293
Starting to mix and match them is where
I think the creative parts come and

91
00:05:51.293 --> 00:05:53.810
the ability to build new and
interesting things.
