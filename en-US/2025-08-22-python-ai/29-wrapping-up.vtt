00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.745
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And so the ability to
kind of create and fine tune with these,

2
00:00:03.745 --> 00:00:05.840
I think is absolutely fascinating.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.120
And it takes again almost everything
we saw altogether in there as well.

4
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.320
And I think you can do
kind of creative things.

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.026
I think with all these
things there's obviously,

6
00:00:19.026 --> 00:00:24.279
we can opine on the kind of practical and
day to day things, which again,

7
00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.050
I think the ability to then pull out
data from specific documents, right?

8
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.335
Or the ability to kind of like arbitrarily
classify stuff or pull out the nouns and

9
00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:40.090
stuff with that named entity recognition
are all practical and useful.

10
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.970
But I also think the areas
where things become fun again.

11
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.214
Cause there's only so many turns of the
kind of eras of our industry where it's

12
00:00:49.214 --> 00:00:54.376
like a whole bunch of crazy new fun things
that we never thought about doing and

13
00:00:54.376 --> 00:00:58.600
then those things are less magical
again and all those things.

14
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.400
So I think there's a lot of
opportunity for creative coding.

15
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.915
Like I said earlier, we looked at a lot
of interesting stuff with text and

16
00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:08.080
we did a few things with images.

17
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.760
There's a lot more that
you can do with images.

18
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.800
But there's again, audio, there's video.

19
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.084
And I think for a lot of these things,

20
00:01:14.084 --> 00:01:18.640
the interesting part is
the intersection of how does the audio.

21
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.240
Could you mix and
match these things together?

22
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.590
Right, right.

23
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.078
I think the fact that you can pull
them all into whether, you know,

24
00:01:26.078 --> 00:01:30.378
hugging space also has this idea of spaces
where you can like, they're not unlike

25
00:01:30.378 --> 00:01:34.180
what we saw in those Google Colab
notebooks where you can like run code and

26
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.870
host it incredibly easily.

27
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.754
But I even think the ability
to kind of like, you know,

28
00:01:38.754 --> 00:01:43.333
tell a story with markdown, have access to
GPUs, run stuff, you know, in storage and

29
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:47.070
kind of share that kind of stuff
makes things incredibly easy as well.

30
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.399
But the important part is, I think for
me, whether you do it in Python or

31
00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.783
like I said, you can do a lot of the tech
stuff in Typescript, whether you

32
00:01:53.783 --> 00:01:57.360
use hugging face or grab the models
yourself doesn't necessarily matter.

33
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.480
I think the important parts are.

34
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.378
One is the immediate neural pathway
unintended of when we think about AI,

35
00:02:04.378 --> 00:02:08.659
that we think about these
big foundational models and

36
00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:13.510
we think about ChatGPT and
just that one generative modality

37
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.834
where we think about the fact that
just grab one of those API keys and

38
00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:24.064
put a wrapper on top of it,
versus when we looked at the thing where

39
00:02:24.064 --> 00:02:29.230
we could fine tune the style of
the quotes on a very small model.

40
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.280
And fine tuning process I think ran in
what under a few minutes on the free

41
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.584
tier hardware with a Data set of 2,500
records on top of a small model,

42
00:02:39.584 --> 00:02:44.465
and we were able to drastically change
as much as one can on a tiny model

43
00:02:44.465 --> 00:02:49.012
with a small data set, but
effectively from rambling garbage to

44
00:02:49.012 --> 00:02:53.980
a structure that was consistent that
ended in the right part with a very

45
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.400
small data set on a very small
model with very cheap hardware.

46
00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.567
There are a lot of things that we
can do with a lot of these tools

47
00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:08.720
outside of the grab a OpenAI API key and
wrap it.

48
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.876
To be clear,
there's a lot you can do with that too,

49
00:03:10.876 --> 00:03:13.200
which I think is also
incredibly important as well.

50
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.900
But there are all these smaller,
more practical things.

51
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.221
I think the big thing about a lot of
this AI stuff is that you can take this

52
00:03:19.221 --> 00:03:22.340
unstructured data and
bring structure to it incredibly easily.

53
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.140
And then those are a lot of times the hard
part of most applications, right?

54
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.260
So being able to pull that in,
I think becomes incredibly useful.

55
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.500
All right, means it killed it.
