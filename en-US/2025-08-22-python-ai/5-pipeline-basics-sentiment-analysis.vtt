00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.264
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We got our little
hugging face token set up for

2
00:00:02.264 --> 00:00:03.600
those keeping track at home.

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.120
It lives right in secrets.

4
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.480
That's where the switch is.

5
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.520
If you jump to another one,
they're like, you don't have a token.

6
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.480
You just flip that switch on.

7
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.840
They'll actually say,
do you want it granted access?

8
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.480
And everything will be easy and great.

9
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.600
But if you're curious where it is,
that's where it is.

10
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.920
And so the first thing that we had here,
where we pulled in two libraries.

11
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.560
One honestly, so
I can just clear the console.

12
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.160
That's what this one is.

13
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.258
But the kind of more interesting one that
we're going to play around with is from

14
00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:30.000
the Transformers, which is a library
from our friends at Hugging Face.

15
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.550
We're going to pull in
the pipeline function.

16
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.625
If you are normally somebody who
writes JavaScript TypeScript,

17
00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:42.230
it's just backwards from
what you're used to.

18
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.229
You would probably do import,
react from React or whatever.

19
00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:47.350
This case is the other way.

20
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.430
It's the second part of ES module import,
but this time it's written this way.

21
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.590
Cool.

22
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.936
With these pipelines,

23
00:00:56.936 --> 00:01:00.390
we can do all the things that
we saw in those slides earlier.

24
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.580
We can do our text generation,
we can do our sentiment analysis.

25
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.740
We can do all those fun things.

26
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.724
What a pipeline basically is,

27
00:01:09.724 --> 00:01:14.700
it's an abstraction where it will grab
all the various pieces that you need.

28
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.300
It will take the text,
it will tokenize it.

29
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.620
You're like, what is tokenization?

30
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.059
That's why we're starting
with the pipeline,

31
00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:21.740
because I will show you
tokenization a little bit.

32
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.980
It will then turn it into the embeddings.

33
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.460
It will then feed it to the model.

34
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.620
It will then take out the results.

35
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.590
It will turn it back into text.

36
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.653
So a pipeline is effectively a bunch
of other smaller pieces that we'll take

37
00:01:32.653 --> 00:01:34.110
a look at later.

38
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.710
All made easy for you.

39
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.674
What the hugging face library will do
is effectively just pull down that open

40
00:01:41.674 --> 00:01:44.910
source model for you, download it.

41
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.144
If you're doing it locally on your
machine into some dot directory,

42
00:01:49.144 --> 00:01:54.108
I forget exactly what it is, but various
different tools will put it somewhere in

43
00:01:54.108 --> 00:01:59.310
your home directory somewhere and just get
everything set up for you super easily.

44
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.074
Right?
Could you do all of this without

45
00:02:01.074 --> 00:02:01.830
hugging a face?

46
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.510
Absolutely.

47
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.670
You could do it and
you'd go and you'd download.

48
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.630
It's the same way as you could
use git without GitHub as well.

49
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.430
Right?

50
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.870
That doesn't mean you want to,
it just means that you can.

51
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.466
And there's nothing necessarily special or

52
00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:15.550
hugging space specific about
anything we're talking about today.

53
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.877
Just as when we pull down Git repos or
use NPM or what have you,

54
00:02:18.877 --> 00:02:22.550
there's nothing necessarily
specific about any of those tools.

55
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.002
They just make our life
a little bit easier so

56
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:27.330
that we can focus on the important parts.

57
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.203
So all the things we talked about earlier
are the things we're going to play around

58
00:02:33.203 --> 00:02:33.850
with today.

59
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.226
So we'll play around with some sentiment
analysis through text generation,

60
00:02:38.226 --> 00:02:42.934
some question answering, and we'll talk
about how that's different than what you

61
00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:47.330
might think with something like ChatGPT,
and we'll see all of those as well.

62
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.045
And then we'll kind of jump into
stuff like tokenization and

63
00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:55.170
other fun stuff like that
at some point as well.

64
00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.194
So like I said, the hello world of
all of this machine learning stuff,

65
00:03:00.194 --> 00:03:04.210
the easiest thing to do is
sentiment analysis, right?

66
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.738
And like I said, it has all the downsides
of it doesn't really do all the stuff that

67
00:03:09.738 --> 00:03:11.999
Transformers do that we're now taking for

68
00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.610
granted with a lot of
the tools that we use.

69
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.210
But that's like the next example.

70
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.730
So we'll start to kind of
see how that stuff works.

71
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.558
But it's a great way to at least wrap our
head around how this little abstraction

72
00:03:23.558 --> 00:03:27.521
that we'll pull down the model,
take care of the tokenization,

73
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:31.290
take care of the embeddings,
convert it all back into stuff.

74
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.290
We can read how that library works,
which is this first part right here.

75
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.743
So we have this pipeline function and
the argument we're going to give this one

76
00:03:41.743 --> 00:03:45.210
is like, hey,
we're going to do sentiment analysis.

77
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.535
This kind of piece that you see over here,
which is again,

78
00:03:49.535 --> 00:03:52.964
if you know TypeScript or JavaScript
a little bit better than Python,

79
00:03:52.964 --> 00:03:56.215
this is like if you had like a argument
that was an object with a bunch

80
00:03:56.215 --> 00:03:59.730
of properties that you're deconstructing
into the named arguments.

81
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.459
So like one could squint and

82
00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.050
probably turn that into JavaScript
in their brains fairly easily.

83
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.530
And that is effectively a theme.

84
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.450
Like these are called lists in Python.

85
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.300
They look like arrays, so on and so forth.

86
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.300
You do not need to know a lot of
Python to play along today, okay?

87
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.747
In fact, you can omit the model if
you want for any given basic thing

88
00:04:23.747 --> 00:04:28.436
that we're going to do like
the sentiment analysis text generation,

89
00:04:28.436 --> 00:04:32.740
there is a very small,
lightweight default model that exists.

90
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.680
You will get a warning of.

91
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.280
You didn't specify a model.

92
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.080
We are going to then
default to this model.

93
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.920
So you can omit this.

94
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.880
You could literally say
pipeline sentiment analysis.

95
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.160
And all of a sudden.

96
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.725
And again, this works in the TypeScript
SDK just as well as it does in

97
00:04:49.725 --> 00:04:50.600
the Python one.

98
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.962
You could just say pipeline, sentiment
analysis and all of a sudden you have

99
00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:58.520
a function that will take strings and
do sentiment analysis.

100
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.488
That is effectively again
what the abstraction,

101
00:05:02.488 --> 00:05:03.760
the hugging face is giving us.

102
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.956
It's not necessarily doing anything
you couldn't do yourself, but

103
00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:09.825
it is making it way easier than
spending the first half of our day

104
00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:13.310
downloading things off the Internet and
putting them in the right folders.

105
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.230
Once we do that, we got this pipeline.

106
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.150
We can do sentiment analysis.

107
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:25.390
I have various strings of text
that I wrote that should.

108
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.152
Theoretically you could probably do
the sentiment analysis in your head of how

109
00:05:29.152 --> 00:05:30.070
they should rate.

110
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.970
And that's the idea is like
we should be able to see.

111
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.870
And then all we're going to do is again,
we had that.

112
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.070
We have that sentiment analyzer, which
is effectively a function at this point.

113
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.310
We feed it the text and the first
thing in the responses is the result.

114
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.310
Which point we're going to look
at the label and the score.

115
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.030
Let's go ahead.

116
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.738
We'll hit this little play sign and
one, it's going to go ahead and

117
00:05:56.738 --> 00:06:00.110
it's going to download that model.

118
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.424
Part of the reason that we chose small
lightweight models is because I'm

119
00:06:04.424 --> 00:06:08.230
impatient and
could you download a 22 gigabyte model?

120
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.217
In fact, you could download it to
Colab because you have a quarter

121
00:06:11.217 --> 00:06:12.150
terabyte of space.

122
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.830
Do I want to wait for that?

123
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.030
No.

124
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.512
So I wouldn't even say it's about our WI
fi because it's actually all happening on

125
00:06:20.512 --> 00:06:21.510
Google servers.

126
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.969
So what happens is it goes ahead,
it pulls down this distilbert

127
00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:32.480
based on case fine tune
sentiment analysis for English.

128
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.963
And then we will take our very
small array of strings and

129
00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:43.395
we'll run each one through and then you
can see that it will take each string and

130
00:06:43.395 --> 00:06:47.800
we have that label and
the result and it will give it a.

131
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.025
Not only does it think it's positive or
negative,

132
00:06:51.025 --> 00:06:53.280
it will go ahead and give it a score.

133
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.130
Now obviously there
are some downsides here.

134
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.890
It's not super good at sarcasm,
as we mentioned earlier.

135
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.130
So we could do something
like we can add one more.

136
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.210
It's the best thing since.

137
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.966
Awesome.
What's your least favorite programming

138
00:07:14.966 --> 00:07:16.210
language and why?

139
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.370
Is it Perl?

140
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.610
&gt;&gt; Austin: Yeah, Perl's up there.

141
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.578
I'll say C.

142
00:07:20.578 --> 00:07:23.042
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: C.
It's the best thing since C.

143
00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:28.420
What I gathered from the tone of
Austin's voice is he didn't mean that.

144
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.440
Right?

145
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.584
And yet it got a confidence of 1.0,

146
00:07:36.584 --> 00:07:41.620
100% confidence that that
was a positive statement.

147
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.981
Right?
Because sentiment analysis is not doing

148
00:07:43.981 --> 00:07:47.140
the stuff that we will talk about
later to try to figure out.

149
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.567
Figure out.
I mean, this is one string of text, like,

150
00:07:49.567 --> 00:07:50.782
I don't know, you know,

151
00:07:50.782 --> 00:07:54.660
you need a little more context to
figure out that that was salty.

152
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.820
But you know, you get the basic
idea that like it's not a.

153
00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.140
It's not a perfect tool.

154
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.900
Right.
&gt;&gt; Austin: Could just be wrong.

155
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.260
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Could just be wrong.

156
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.860
To be clear, there's somebody who truly
believes that, you know what I mean?

157
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.660
I just hope they're not watching,
otherwise I'll get an email.

158
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.420
But yeah, so that is the.

159
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.180
Again, send it now is a good hello world.

160
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.420
Because it is also does my thing work?

161
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:23.172
So if you ran that and you see the output,
we're in good shape for

162
00:08:23.172 --> 00:08:28.100
probably a good portion of the day
until we switch over to images and

163
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.380
then we play with GPUs and everything
becomes new and different again.

164
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.740
So some models have a neutral category.

165
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.580
This kind of base one does not.

166
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.489
This model, like the default model,
works best with English.

167
00:08:45.489 --> 00:08:48.323
So obviously if you hand
it a bunch of German,

168
00:08:48.323 --> 00:08:51.169
you will not get probably
accurate results.

169
00:08:51.169 --> 00:08:54.729
So there are things that you need
to consider, so on and so forth.

170
00:08:54.729 --> 00:08:57.489
Right?
So here's like the ones I had ready to go.

171
00:08:59.889 --> 00:09:03.649
Like it thinks this is negative.

172
00:09:03.649 --> 00:09:04.369
It's not.

173
00:09:04.369 --> 00:09:08.076
Now there are other models, there are
bigger models that maybe have a little bit

174
00:09:08.076 --> 00:09:10.969
more like dimensionality to them
where you can do that stuff.

175
00:09:10.969 --> 00:09:15.524
So model selection in a lot of cases and
what model you choose of

176
00:09:15.524 --> 00:09:20.254
the like many thousands insofar
that people can just fork one and

177
00:09:20.254 --> 00:09:23.770
push one up,
probably millions at this point.

178
00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.570
I don't know,
we'll have some of those things.

179
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:31.465
But you always play a game which is do
some of the more sophisticated models that

180
00:09:31.465 --> 00:09:34.490
maybe can do like neutral sentiment.

181
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:35.890
Yeah, but at what cost, right?

182
00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:40.180
Like are they bigger, so on and
so forth, are they slower?

183
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.594
You play the game of what you're looking
for at this point, for right now, for

184
00:09:43.594 --> 00:09:44.526
the simplest thing,

185
00:09:44.526 --> 00:09:48.260
where we're just trying to see if our
setup works, I went for fast and easy.

186
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:48.760
Right?

187
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.060
What you're looking for
might be different.

188
00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.990
Okay, so with that, if no one's
complaining my thing doesn't work,

189
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.500
then we know.

190
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I had a question
just about sentiment analysis.

191
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.847
Is it always on a scale from
positive to negative or

192
00:10:04.847 --> 00:10:09.190
can you use other describing
words like angry versus sad.

193
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.430
Or something like that?

194
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.328
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I think most of the
sentiment analysis ones that I played with

195
00:10:14.328 --> 00:10:16.430
have positive, negative and
some have neutral.

196
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.986
But there is also when we get to
stuff like the classification,

197
00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:22.750
when you want to have labels and
stuff like that.

198
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.990
That is usually what I have
traditionally used that for.

199
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.849
So there might be some models that can
do that, but I have always reached for

200
00:10:29.849 --> 00:10:32.030
a slightly different tool
when it comes to that.
