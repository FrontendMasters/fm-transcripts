00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.040
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we have a few
tools that we're going to be using.

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.600
Really the two that you
need is a Google account.

3
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.781
So you can use these
Google Colab notebooks, but

4
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.880
they are effectively
just Jupyter notebooks.

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.840
So worst case scenario, if you needed to
download said Jupyter notebook, you could.

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.500
That said, there's a few things in there
where for just clearing out logs and

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.480
stuff like that that are Colab specific.

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.792
The good news is as long as
you have a Google account,

9
00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:35.330
using Colab is effectively free, right?

10
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.930
There is a kinda limited version.

11
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.990
We get either CPU bound stuff or

12
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.970
a lightweight graphics
card that you can use.

13
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.210
And like to be clear, could you run
all of this code on your computer?

14
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.010
Absolutely.

15
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.490
I just don't trust all
of your graphics cards.

16
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.478
And so knowing that we could have a stable
set of graphic cards at our disposal

17
00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:57.050
seemed like the mature and
responsible choice.

18
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.790
So that's what we're doing because I did
run some of these even on my M1 max.

19
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.270
You have time to make a sandwich if
you run it probably on your laptop.

20
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.550
So I think using Google's free
GPUs is probably a good choice.

21
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.350
The other one is Hugging Face which is.

22
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.550
We'll talk about this in a second.

23
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.750
Literally the next slide.

24
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.733
It's not wrong to think about GitHub but
for open source models,

25
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:33.590
getting those two accounts now, why I buy
you some time is probably, probably good.

26
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.013
And yeah, so like I said,
Hugging face, it's like GitHub but

27
00:01:40.013 --> 00:01:44.390
for models and data sets and
all sorts of other fun stuff.

28
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.015
And like GitHub is just more
than just code repositories now

29
00:01:49.015 --> 00:01:53.650
where there's stuff like
GitHub Actions and code spaces.

30
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.480
There is obviously more to
Hugging Face the overall platform

31
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.650
than we will touch today.

32
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.930
We are predominantly going to use it.

33
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.324
One for SDK that makes working with some
of these models very easy and two for

34
00:02:07.324 --> 00:02:11.810
the fact that like doing a Git clone,
it makes getting the models very easy.

35
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.319
But there is a ton of cool stuff that
I encourage you to go poke around with

36
00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.090
as well.

37
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.330
And there are lots of different models and
data sets to play around with.

38
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.092
We are going to be somewhat
conservative today with some of these

39
00:02:25.092 --> 00:02:30.471
smaller ones that I know will work in
time frames conducive to our chats,

40
00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:35.090
hardware conducive to our chats,
so on and so forth.

41
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.160
Also, if you ever thought too hard about
a company name, just naming it after

42
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.160
an emoji that inspires joy is probably
not the worst thing that you could do.

43
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.360
So yeah,
if you do not have a hugging face account.

44
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.200
Now's the time to go do that.

45
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.933
But as you can see,
lots of really fun stuff and

46
00:02:54.933 --> 00:02:59.480
one could lose many a weekend exploring
all of the data sets and models.

47
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.840
Ask me how I know the one
thing that you will do and

48
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.560
for some of this I will
not do it with you.

49
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.858
As I project my screen to hundreds of
people is we will go into our settings and

50
00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:16.560
I'll get you halfway there, but you'll do
the rest and getting yourself an access

51
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.550
token that we will go put in our
Google Colab notebooks in a little bit.

52
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.229
And once we get that token, after that we
will head over to Google Colab, where we

53
00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:31.670
will go ahead and put it in the sidebar
and have it as an environment variable.

54
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.370
Google Colab will keep the knowledge
of these environment variables and

55
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.760
secrets, but you'll have to flip it on for
each notebook.

56
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.491
I also say that in case I forget at
some point that now I have said it and

57
00:03:46.491 --> 00:03:50.751
someone can remind me, because sometimes
when you're talking encoding and

58
00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:54.840
moving your mouse around, you forget
some very simple, simple things.

59
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.040
But we will take a tour
of all of these things.

60
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.291
The other thing I will put in
your head now before we jump in,

61
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:07.137
is by default, most of the time you
will start out on a cpu, which for

62
00:04:07.137 --> 00:04:10.050
a lot of things is totally fine and good.

63
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.110
You can get a little bit more of a boost,

64
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.730
particularly when it comes to image stuff,
by switching over to a gpu.

65
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.690
And so again, little seeds
that I plant in your mind now.

66
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.196
So if you're following along and
you missed that,

67
00:04:25.196 --> 00:04:27.890
I have now at least put at
least one stake in the ground.

68
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.930
You're like, why is mine going so
much slower than his?

69
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.965
At one point I will switch
to the fancy GPUs for the,

70
00:04:33.965 --> 00:04:38.740
the fancy stuff mostly because who wants
to wait for my computer to do stuff?

71
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.502
But these are the kind of little
pillars that we're gonna jump,

72
00:04:42.502 --> 00:04:46.542
you know, kind of like put in place
right now in our brains so that when

73
00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:51.300
they come up later today, I can reference
them as if I had a plan this entire time.

74
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.100
A few other things to kind of look at.

75
00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.260
Like there are other libraries
that make an appearance.

76
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.300
None of them are things that you need
to have an in depth knowledge of.

77
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.160
So you're like, I don't know what that is.

78
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.960
That's fine.

79
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
We will kind of explain
most of it as we go along.

80
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.120
We're kinda just using
them somewhat lightly.

81
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.550
The one that we will see
the most is Pytorch,

82
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.833
which is built by our friends at Meta,
and it is just a set of tools for

83
00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:26.520
working with things like tensors and
other neural networks and models.

84
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.128
Along those lines,
that is Other things like Numpy and

85
00:05:30.128 --> 00:05:34.991
I will use matplotlib just to visualize
stuff at one point or another, but

86
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:38.460
those mostly just make guest appearances,
right?

87
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.022
The main thing that we'll be using is
the Hugging Face Transformers library and

88
00:05:44.022 --> 00:05:48.100
the Diffusers library and
some other fun Pythoney stuff.
