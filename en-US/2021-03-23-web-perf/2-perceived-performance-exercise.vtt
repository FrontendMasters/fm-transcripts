00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.990
But what does fast mean?

2
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.400
And so this is gonna bring
us to our first exercise.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.627
Now in the materials that I posted in
chat, and as available on the website,

4
00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:14.270
there is a performance
comparison worksheet.

5
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.850
Now this is a Google Sheets.

6
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.052
You're gonna wanna take a copy of this so
you can edit it,

7
00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:20.870
and it shows you four websites.

8
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.560
Let's have a look at that.

9
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.370
It shows you four websites, NPR, CNN, New
York Times and The Wall Street Journal.

10
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.730
These are all new sites of with
varying levels of how they make money.

11
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.436
NPR being a publicly funded organization,

12
00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:43.239
CNN being almost purely advertising
funded New York Times and

13
00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.930
Wall Street Journal being various
mixes of subscription and advertising.

14
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.719
And each of them has taken
a slightly different approach

15
00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.380
in how their website is designed.

16
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.890
Before we dig into metrics, I want to
know what you think these websites are.

17
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.803
And so I'd like you to open up
a incognito window in Chrome and

18
00:01:03.803 --> 00:01:05.860
visit each of these sites.

19
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.568
Kind of scroll through it,
see what you think and rank these sites,

20
00:01:10.568 --> 00:01:15.800
one to four, one being the fastest and
four being the slowest.

21
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.240
Take a minute or two or five to do that.

22
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.007
And then we're going to come back and

23
00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:22.460
we're going to talk about
what those scores mean.

24
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.298
If you're unable to edit, remember that
you need to make a copy of the worksheet

25
00:01:28.298 --> 00:01:32.970
into your own Google Drive or whatever
before you're gonna be able to edit it.
