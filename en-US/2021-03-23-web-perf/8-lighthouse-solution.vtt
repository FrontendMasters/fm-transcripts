00:00:00.238 --> 00:00:03.563
We're going to take a look at
some of that data and compare it

2
00:00:03.563 --> 00:00:07.770
with what our subjective opinions were and
see how those things measured.

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.289
So when I did this exercise,
these were the scores that I got.

4
00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.927
Now your scores are likely
different than these,

5
00:00:15.927 --> 00:00:19.398
I would not expect us all
to have the exact same.

6
00:00:19.398 --> 00:00:23.730
And the reason that we would not
have the exact same is that these

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.650
are called lab metrics.

8
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.622
As in we got these metrics from
running in our own private laboratory.

9
00:00:31.622 --> 00:00:34.921
Which is our own machine.

10
00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:39.800
Your score is reflected what your
instance of Chrome running on

11
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.690
your screen size for
your computer currently experienced it.

12
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.273
And so it's going to change slightly based
on what kind of computer you're using,

13
00:00:49.273 --> 00:00:52.151
how big your screen was,
where in the world you are,

14
00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:55.445
how well the site was serving
you content at the time, etc.

15
00:00:55.445 --> 00:00:57.860
But when I did this,
these are the scores that I got.

16
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.061
And I've color coded
them here on the left,

17
00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:06.962
which they should have popped in as
you enter the numbers, roughly how

18
00:01:06.962 --> 00:01:12.131
Chrome would have treated those numbers,
whether they were good or bad.

19
00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:16.650
And on the right, I calculated
the ranking of each and compared it.

20
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.652
So the perceived speed rank was
whatever you ranked the sites from your

21
00:01:21.652 --> 00:01:26.508
subjective which site is fastest,
our first exercise that we did.

22
00:01:26.508 --> 00:01:31.851
And then how well they ranked for
each of these three important metrics.

23
00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:35.145
We didn't include first input
delay because likely you're not

24
00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:37.160
inputting anything into these sites.

25
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.357
So how well did they correlate?

26
00:01:41.357 --> 00:01:48.180
For me my metrics seemed to correlate
pretty well with my subjective opinion.

27
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.242
I thought NPR was the fastest,
I felt it was the fastest.

28
00:01:53.242 --> 00:01:57.699
And it had the fastest LCP,
the best caminos of layout score, and

29
00:01:57.699 --> 00:02:01.490
the second fastest first contentful paint.

30
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.735
Overall, the metrics say,
this is a good site.

31
00:02:04.735 --> 00:02:06.803
It was fast.

32
00:02:06.803 --> 00:02:10.160
The second fastest site for
me was the New York Times.

33
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.405
That's what I felt it was.

34
00:02:12.405 --> 00:02:15.450
And the metrics agree
with it across the board.

35
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.897
It was the second rank in everything.

36
00:02:18.897 --> 00:02:21.816
It was the second fastest FCP,

37
00:02:21.816 --> 00:02:26.763
the second fastest LCP,
the second best CLS, etc.

38
00:02:26.763 --> 00:02:29.873
So this was, at least in this instance,

39
00:02:29.873 --> 00:02:34.270
a pretty good representation
of my subjective opinion.
