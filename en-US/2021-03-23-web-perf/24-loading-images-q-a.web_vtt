A fantastic question in the chat,
that I want to address.

2
00:00:04.314 --> 00:00:08.297
Victor asked about,
loading low quality pictures first,

3
00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:12.214
and then replacing them,
with higher quality pictures.

4
00:00:12.214 --> 00:00:15.195
A lot of big websites do this,
you might notice that on medium,

5
00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:19.075
I think is the one that, comes to mind
immediately, but I've seen this pattern,

6
00:00:19.075 --> 00:00:20.276
lots and lots of places.

7
00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:25.255
That's really interesting because this
is gaming the psychology of waiting

8
00:00:25.255 --> 00:00:30.079
that we talked about, because you're
actually needing to send more bytes

9
00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.827
over the wire and making it slower in
total, because you have to send first

10
00:00:34.827 --> 00:00:39.903
the low resolution image, and then later
you send the full resolution image.

11
00:00:39.903 --> 00:00:43.715
However, because you've shown
something to the user sooner,

12
00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:48.584
you've indicated to them that this page
is done, you can go about your business,

13
00:00:48.584 --> 00:00:51.211
don't worry about it it'll fill in later.

14
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:53.481
You know what to expect.

15
00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:58.941
And so even though you might have
deferred the total wait time to be slower

16
00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:04.330
than what it would have been,
the user is gonna feel like it's faster.

17
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.521
This isn't a one size fits all technique.

18
00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:13.003
You shouldn't always do this because
you are slowing down the absolute time.

19
00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:15.362
And it's gonna require
a bunch of pre-process,

20
00:01:15.362 --> 00:01:18.349
it's gonna require some work to
do all this to all your images.

21
00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:23.331
It's not a matter of running a magic
script and it's all just done.

22
00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:28.286
But in certain circumstances where you
have big images that really add value to

23
00:01:28.286 --> 00:01:33.465
your content, and the user is waiting for
it, this gaming this technique by using

24
00:01:33.465 --> 00:01:38.590
that psychology can add a lot of value to
the perceived performance of your page.
