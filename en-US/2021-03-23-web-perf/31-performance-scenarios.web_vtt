1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.990
So we're gonna talk about
a couple of scenarios.

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.570
Here is a super common
performance scenario.

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.338
I think I hear this every time I've
talked about performance with any

4
00:00:11.338 --> 00:00:12.060
group of people.

5
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.185
What do I do when
marketing comes to me and

6
00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:18.640
says I'm they're gonna put another
third party pixel on the page.

7
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.895
They have Google Tag Manager, maybe they
didn't even ask you and they just like,

8
00:00:22.895 --> 00:00:25.140
started slapping a bunch
of stuff onto the page.

9
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.970
And now it's slow and
I can't get them to take it off.

10
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.140
Well, how do you convince them?

11
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.128
If you care, you're an IT or
you're an engineering and

12
00:00:35.128 --> 00:00:39.515
you you wanna make the site fast, you're
rewarded for keeping the site fast, but

13
00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:43.600
you gave control over to marketing and
they keep dumping crap onto the page.

14
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.470
Well, they don't know necessarily.

15
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.572
They're being rewarded by how much data
they can harvest from their users or

16
00:00:51.572 --> 00:00:53.380
how well they're advertising.

17
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.840
And they don't necessarily know
that slowing down the page is bad.

18
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.940
They don't know that it's
actually costing them anything.

19
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.842
So how do you convince them of that?

20
00:01:05.088 --> 00:01:10.049
Will you need data, you need to have
a data based conversation about what's

21
00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.840
wrong and how you're gonna make it better.

22
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.510
And when I say you need
data It's not this.

23
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.350
You can't take this data
to Fred in marketing and

24
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.310
have him give a crap about it.

25
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.390
He doesn't know what FCP is or
why it's important.

26
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.630
This is meaningless to them.

27
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.170
Seeing that this thing got bad,
he doesn't care.

28
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.930
Maybe he cares about this.

29
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.440
Maybe Fred cares about bounce rates and
session times.

30
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.210
If they're in digital marketing and
they're aware of analytics,

31
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.980
maybe they care a lot about these numbers.

32
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.990
But not all organizations do, not all
organizations are tech savvy like that.

33
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.540
But they definitely care
about numbers like this.

34
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.290
They care about revenue per day,
number of checkouts.

35
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.690
They care about the things
that drive their business.

36
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.500
And so how do you tie the data together?

37
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.574
Well, you look at the historical,
you look at your performance data,

38
00:02:13.574 --> 00:02:17.610
you have to have that performance data,
but you look at your performance data.

39
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.560
You look at their business data and
you lay them on top of each other.

40
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.711
And over a timeframe you see
how does that correlate?

41
00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:27.795
Do the performance get worse and
worse and worse and

42
00:02:27.795 --> 00:02:30.240
the revenue goes down and down and down.

43
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.050
You have a justification
you can talk about that.

44
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.970
You can say these things
are correlated together.

45
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.690
But maybe they're not.

46
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.496
Maybe the page has gotten slower and
slower and slower and the business

47
00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:47.630
has made more and more and more money,
which sometimes happens, right?

48
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.850
Sometimes, being slower makes something
weirdly more desirable in people's minds.

49
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.030
But without data you don't know.

50
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.130
And you could be wrong.

51
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.088
On the opposite side of the spectrum,
there are a lot of developers who becomes

52
00:03:02.088 --> 00:03:06.307
zealots about performance or
whatever their preferred niches, and

53
00:03:06.307 --> 00:03:11.710
we'll make a site fast to all ends, even
when it doesn't need to be any faster.

54
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.600
Your blog does not need to be
the fastest website that has ever been.

55
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.590
Because it just at some
point just doesn't matter.

56
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.980
And you need the data to prove it.

57
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.950
You need to be able to say revenue is
negatively impacted by performance.

58
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.313
And if you can say that business people
just throw money at you and say,

59
00:03:28.313 --> 00:03:29.940
all right, we got to fix this.

60
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.342
We got him we got to make that happen.

61
00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:36.440
Let's talk about another common scenario.

62
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.902
This is something that I imagine a bunch
of people who are watching now and

63
00:03:39.902 --> 00:03:42.913
watching online later,
are thinking about because it's when

64
00:03:42.913 --> 00:03:46.700
a lot of people go looking for training
is they're starting something new.

65
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.968
They're gonna roll on to a new project or
build a new Greenfield application and

66
00:03:49.968 --> 00:03:52.670
they are trying to
figure out how to do it.

67
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.050
And so you're reaching out and you're
gonna design the next great web app.

68
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.510
You're gonna build a software service and
it's gonna be incredible.

69
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.310
And you're trying to
figure out how to do it.

70
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.661
You're putting your plans down and

71
00:04:05.661 --> 00:04:08.880
performance obviously
needs to be part of that.

72
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.770
But how do you need to think about that?

73
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.200
How do you judge how much work
you should put into this?

74
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.265
When you start, you need to think about
the business objectives of your app,

75
00:04:23.265 --> 00:04:25.552
even as a technical person, like,

76
00:04:25.552 --> 00:04:31.300
you should understand why are we building
this thing and what is it going to do?

77
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.820
Is it going to generate
revenue from sales?

78
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.180
Like are we selling something?

79
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.302
Are we just harvesting data
like devilish spiders of

80
00:04:41.302 --> 00:04:45.200
the internet to sell to third parties?

81
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.647
Are we providing a service to users who
are gonna be able to do something like

82
00:04:49.647 --> 00:04:52.409
what is the actual
objective of this product?

83
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.700
Because that's the part that
the business is gonna care about.

84
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.490
So let's take the example that
we're gonna provide a service.

85
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.227
We're gonna build a software as a service
product that people will log into and

86
00:05:07.227 --> 00:05:08.675
pay a subscription to.

87
00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:12.859
What are the important metrics that
will correlate to that objective?

88
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.252
Does LCP correlated?

89
00:05:16.252 --> 00:05:21.067
Does the time between the time it takes
for something to draw on the page matter

90
00:05:21.067 --> 00:05:25.150
to these people will depend
on what your services right?

91
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.370
If it's a very simple service that
is kind of a, $10 a month thing.

92
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.910
Well, they won't really wait for LCP.

93
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.835
It won't be a thing,
like it has to load fast and

94
00:05:37.835 --> 00:05:42.330
you cannot really adjust that out.

95
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.071
If it's something super valuable like
you're interpreting X-ray images or

96
00:05:47.071 --> 00:05:50.732
somebody will probably wait 30 seconds,
a minute even for

97
00:05:50.732 --> 00:05:52.600
all of the stuff to come down.

98
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.180
If you're sending a lot
of stuff down the wire,

99
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.600
maybe the first input delay is important.

100
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.047
You wanna make sure that your
app feels fluid and responsive.

101
00:06:01.047 --> 00:06:06.950
That's okay to throw loading screens up
in order to make sure it feels that way.

102
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.690
Or maybe you have some custom thing.

103
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.986
Some custom metric that you wanna define,

104
00:06:12.986 --> 00:06:17.590
like how long between the loading screen
and the user performs this action.

105
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.000
They've sent their first email,
they've tweeted for the first time.

106
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.576
Twitter famously tracks a mention of
timed tweet, from the time you land on

107
00:06:24.576 --> 00:06:28.360
the page to the time your first
tweet is sent, how long is that?

108
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.000
And they measure it and
track it over time.

109
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.030
And that's not a weird idea.

110
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.200
It's not something that you
should be unique to them.

111
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.414
Any sufficiently complex
software service should have

112
00:06:38.414 --> 00:06:43.790
this kind of metrics that correlate for
the engagement and success of their users.

113
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.200
What are those metrics for your app?

114
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.184
You should know those kind of,
think about those going into it and

115
00:06:50.184 --> 00:06:52.805
how you're gonna measure that overtime.

116
00:06:52.805 --> 00:06:54.860
So let's play with this.

117
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.760
Let's think about it.

118
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.640
Let's use some examples.

119
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.624
I'm gonna go back out here to performance
budget.io which would be a good place to

120
00:07:03.624 --> 00:07:04.140
start.

121
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.360
So let's think about
what our site's gonna do.

122
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.094
Hypothetically, let's say we're gonna
build a big data collection and

123
00:07:13.094 --> 00:07:18.060
reporting service, something like
request metrics that shows performance

124
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.260
data across a big data set to people.

125
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.285
Well, I want the site to load
pretty quick, especially,

126
00:07:24.285 --> 00:07:26.710
if you're a performance site, right?

127
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.556
If I'm talking about performance,
and the site's not performance,

128
00:07:29.556 --> 00:07:30.960
it's kind of a bad luck.

129
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.480
So there's a little bit
of a hidden agenda there.

130
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.285
But overall,

131
00:07:36.285 --> 00:07:40.180
is probably not the most important
thing the user is gonna do in a day.

132
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.350
They probably have a lot
of things they care about.

133
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.920
They're not gonna wait super
long to see this data.

134
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:52.373
But maybe they'll wait four seconds,
I think, okay, they'll wait four seconds,

135
00:07:52.373 --> 00:07:57.470
kind of at the worst case, but
most of my users are business users.

136
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.060
They're on a fast connection.

137
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:05.420
They're working out of their office or
out of a good coffee shop kind of thing.

138
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.480
So let's say let's say
mobile 3G at the worst.

139
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.673
Well what can I do?

140
00:08:13.673 --> 00:08:18.458
If I'm doing something really complex,
like I'm doing a lot of charting,

141
00:08:18.458 --> 00:08:23.939
I'm gonna need some JavaScript, like those
visualization libraries are not small.

142
00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:26.517
And I probably need a couple of them.

143
00:08:26.517 --> 00:08:28.917
And I probably need to like,
gather the data and

144
00:08:28.917 --> 00:08:31.180
do a little bit of crunching on it.

145
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.440
So maybe I need like 250k a JavaScript.

146
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.920
I probably don't need a lot of fonts so
I'll pick a nice fonts and it'll be fine.

147
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:41.970
I don't need video.

148
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.014
I don't really need images, maybe a few.

149
00:08:47.014 --> 00:08:51.302
Just to spice it up picture
a slot here and there.

150
00:08:51.302 --> 00:08:55.208
CSS is probably gonna be a lot of
styling data tables and buttons and

151
00:08:55.208 --> 00:08:58.209
controls and filters and
there's all kinds of like

152
00:08:58.209 --> 00:09:02.280
niggly bits that need to responsive
down into smaller screen sizes.

153
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.250
Lots of complexity there.

154
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:08.790
So I mean, we might have 100k of CSS.

155
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.734
And then the HTML is probably not
big in terms of the raw HTML, but

156
00:09:12.734 --> 00:09:15.805
something we should think
about including this is

157
00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:18.820
what are all the AJAX
requests that are going in.

158
00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.460
How much data needs to come
into the site over time.

159
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.350
I can kind of bake that
in a little bit here.

160
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:30.170
How much data do I need to pull
in to render my page initially.

161
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:37.390
So if I set all of these budgets,
here become my performance windows.

162
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.999
And so
at that mobile 3G I'm at three seconds,

163
00:09:39.999 --> 00:09:44.060
which is a little faster than I was
even shooting for which is pretty cool.

164
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.160
But so at this level here is my budget.

165
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.259
And so
you can set this going into your project,

166
00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:55.810
you know that you have 250k
of JavaScript to work with.

167
00:09:55.810 --> 00:10:00.908
So when that new hot charting library
comes out, and you really wanna use it,

168
00:10:00.908 --> 00:10:05.080
but it's 300k, well,
now you have a conversation point.

169
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.750
Now you're like, well, we're gonna blow
our performance budget if we pull this in.

170
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.960
We're gonna double it.

171
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.360
We'll have to go to 500 with
all of our other stuff.

172
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.560
And that's a conversation that
should be intentional from you.
