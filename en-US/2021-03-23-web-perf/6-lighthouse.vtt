1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.610
Here I have Google Chrome open to a
website and I've opened up the Dev tools.

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.190
Now when you're gonna run lighthouse it's
generally best to detached your dev tools.

3
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.996
And that's because we're gonna be taking a
metric about how well things are rendered

4
00:00:17.996 --> 00:00:19.940
into the window.

5
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.706
If you have dev tools occupying
the bottom third of your screen or

6
00:00:23.706 --> 00:00:29.350
the right half of your screen or whatever,
you've changed the size of the window.

7
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.050
And now you're measuring something
that isn't really realistic.

8
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.660
Not many real users run their
browsers in a window this big.

9
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.340
They render it in a normal screen size.

10
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.590
So my actual chrome window is
a normal size for a laptop user.

11
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.180
And I've detached the dev
tools somewhere else.

12
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.750
Now lighthouse is just a top level tab.

13
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.046
Usually it's last but

14
00:00:58.046 --> 00:01:03.060
you can kind of drag these around to be
in whatever order you want them to be.

15
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.930
I tend to use lighthouse,
more so than many others.

16
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.670
There's some configuration
options available to us.

17
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.513
What lighthouse is going to do is
it's gonna generate a performance

18
00:01:14.513 --> 00:01:15.510
report for us.

19
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.522
It's gonna tell us how well does this
page perform by all of the various

20
00:01:19.522 --> 00:01:23.126
metrics that google cares about
in order to do that effectively

21
00:01:23.126 --> 00:01:26.390
should really clear out
the storage of the browser.

22
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.860
It shouldn't like pull stuff from cache,
and so on.

23
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.780
It shouldn't rely on
cookies it should say it.

24
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.110
What would a first time
user experience be?

25
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.770
And so we want to leave clear
storage on simulated throttling.

26
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.480
We probably want to leave that on as well.

27
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.442
Chances are the devices that we use as
developers are probably a little bit

28
00:01:46.442 --> 00:01:47.380
better.

29
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.580
A little bit faster than our average user.

30
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.400
And so we can simulate some
of what that user would see,

31
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.386
by turning this on, and it will
basically throttle your device in about

32
00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:03.650
half it's gonna do a 1x turndown
of your current hardware.

33
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.810
Now lighthouse can do
a bunch of other things.

34
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.340
For the purpose of this course route.

35
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.532
We're only talking about performance, but

36
00:02:11.532 --> 00:02:13.790
it can do a whole bunch
of other useful things.

37
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.031
If you'd like to see more of that,
there is a whole course here on

38
00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:24.425
front end masters about those
chrome developer tools and

39
00:02:24.425 --> 00:02:28.360
all the different things you can use for
it.

40
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.550
I encourage you to check that out.

41
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.640
The final option that we care about
here is what device we're gonna run on.

42
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.458
Now, the desktop we're going to run
it on the chrome web browser that we

43
00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.130
have open right now.

44
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.330
If we want to run this on mobile,
it's gonna do the simulation, right?

45
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.589
It's going to create a screen size that's
only the size of a mobile device, and

46
00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:49.920
it's going to run the report then.

47
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.500
So I'm gonna go ahead and run this report.

48
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.406
And it takes, 30 seconds or so to run,
it's gonna like reload chrome in

49
00:02:56.406 --> 00:02:59.619
the background, and
it's gonna wipe out all the cookies and

50
00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:03.660
it's gonna clear out the storage and
then it's gonna produce a report.

51
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.008
That looks like this, it gives you a top
level score, which they calculate out but

52
00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:14.380
it also gives you all of these core web
vitals metrics that we talked about.

53
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.823
So in this case, it took 1.3 seconds to
show the first bit of data on this page,

54
00:03:19.823 --> 00:03:21.640
which isn't so good.

55
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.310
And so it's red.

56
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.125
The largest contentful paint was after
that the largest contentful paint

57
00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:32.750
will always be after the first and
it took 1.6 seconds.

58
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.290
And the community layout shift,
which isn't a time it's like a score.

59
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.569
It's like how much of a percentage
of the page has been shifted around.

60
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.811
The score's actually much more
complicated than that and

61
00:03:45.811 --> 00:03:49.790
they show the calculations of how
they get to that on their website.

62
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.832
You can turn on these other option for
more details with links out to how they

63
00:03:53.832 --> 00:03:58.086
calculate each of these scores, if
you're interested in the nuts and bolts.

64
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:03.405
There's a whole bunch of other things
interesting on here that we'll talk about

65
00:04:03.405 --> 00:04:04.900
more in a minute.

66
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.380
But for now, you know enough
to run a performance report.

67
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.097
If you wanna run multiple performance
reports, this little plus up here in

68
00:04:13.097 --> 00:04:15.870
the corner we'll just create
a new one that you can run.

69
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.936
You can visit any of the previous reports
that you've run within this instance

70
00:04:19.936 --> 00:04:20.880
of chrome.

71
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.830
So you can try multiple things and
see how you got better.

72
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.000
There's some quirks that
we should know about.

73
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.270
The chrome lighthouse report
is relative to your machine.

74
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.793
So you're measuring performance
from your machine or

75
00:04:35.793 --> 00:04:38.950
a throttled version of your machine.

76
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.800
So it's not necessarily gonna
reflect what the end user sees.

77
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.240
But something that the user that is
kind of similar to you would see

78
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.270
interacting with the pitch.

79
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.510
It's also showing the performance relative
to the current size of the chrome window.

80
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.724
So if the window is really small,
and in the background and

81
00:04:59.724 --> 00:05:04.540
not at all relevant, well,
those scores aren't gonna be right.

82
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.937
They're gonna be like, hey,

83
00:05:05.937 --> 00:05:08.640
how much does the layout shift
if my window is only this big?

84
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.540
Who cares nobody would
ever look at it like that.

85
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.688
A third kind of,

86
00:05:14.688 --> 00:05:19.540
Interesting gotcha is that make sure
chrome stays in the foreground.

87
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.297
If you put chrome into a background
if you like, go off and

88
00:05:23.297 --> 00:05:26.210
do other things while your
lighthouse is running.

89
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.755
Well, everything just kind
of gets throttle down and

90
00:05:28.755 --> 00:05:33.240
sometimes crumble like stop executing
JavaScript because it's in the background.

91
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.720
And your lighthouse report will
be all weird and different.

92
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.720
So keep it in the foreground
while you're running it.

93
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.430
We already mentioned this sort, of course,
it's really good, I took a look at it.

94
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.037
You should totally check it out for a lot
more details into the Chrome Dev Tools and

95
00:05:49.037 --> 00:05:51.360
all of the other tabs and how to use them.
