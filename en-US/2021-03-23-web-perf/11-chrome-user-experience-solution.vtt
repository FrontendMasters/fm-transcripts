00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.551
There were some questions in
chat actually that pointed,

2
00:00:03.551 --> 00:00:07.690
I dropped some links to this
resource here on my screen, web.dev.

3
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.326
And some of you weren't aware of it so
I wanted to point it out,

4
00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:12.540
because it's a fantastic resource.

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.620
This is a Google sponsored or
built website that kind of

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.110
codifies a lot of Google's perceived
best practices on the web.

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.993
A lot of the authoritative information
about the core web vitals and

8
00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:30.220
how they're measured and
how they might change over time are here.

9
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.190
So if you haven't been out to
web.dev to take a look at this,

10
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.975
after this course is done, if you wanna
dive deeper into any of these things,

11
00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:38.920
this would be a great resource for you.

12
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.570
Let's get back to our exercise.

13
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.570
So we pulled in some real data.

14
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.570
Now the CrUX data isn't perfect, right?

15
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.050
It is representing the data
that Chrome has pulled in, but

16
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.317
it's aggregated up across
the whole bunch of users and

17
00:00:56.317 --> 00:01:00.050
it's really only showing
you one point per month.

18
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.990
So it's saying for all of the users
in the last month every single day,

19
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:06.517
here is the average.

20
00:01:06.517 --> 00:01:10.321
Here is the piece or
the P75 not the average.

21
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:15.130
So, 75% of the users had this experience,
or better.

22
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.570
And this data does not
necessarily match up perfectly.

23
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.520
So we should probably have
data that's pretty close.

24
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.090
I captured this data a week ago or so.

25
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.392
So the roll ups might be a little
different than the data you captured.

26
00:01:30.392 --> 00:01:36.525
But here was the web vital
scores that I pulled in.

27
00:01:36.525 --> 00:01:42.490
And how I'm comparing them to
what I perceive them to be.

28
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.240
It's not exactly what
I would have expected.

29
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.074
So for example, MPR, which I thought
was the fastest site subjectively.

30
00:01:52.074 --> 00:01:55.928
Well, according to CrUX,
it only had the third fastest FCP.

31
00:01:55.928 --> 00:02:00.364
It was 30% worse than what
I measured in Chrome.

32
00:02:00.364 --> 00:02:02.295
There was third in LCP.

33
00:02:02.295 --> 00:02:04.183
42% worse.

34
00:02:04.183 --> 00:02:06.390
But it was first in CLS.

35
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.597
But it was still almost 100% worse
than what I measured locally.

36
00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:15.280
And so in almost every case,

37
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.119
the field data was worse than my lab data.

38
00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:25.010
And in some cases, it flipped the order.

39
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.560
So for example, the New York times
had a much better set of field data,

40
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.680
than I would have thought,
than the lab data suggests.

41
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.910
Now what could that mean?

42
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.350
Why might that happen?

43
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.030
Well, the field data is
coming from the real users.

44
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.916
Some of them on fast machines, some of
them on slow machines, some of them on

45
00:02:48.916 --> 00:02:52.520
good networks, some of them on
crappy mobile networks in elevators.

46
00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.390
How well that site tailors itself to that
user is reflected in the field data.

47
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.076
So for example, this would suggest
that the New York Times is better

48
00:03:07.076 --> 00:03:13.984
able to downscale its content and deliver
a fast experience even on slow devices.

49
00:03:13.984 --> 00:03:16.721
And it's better at that than NPR is.

50
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:20.910
That might deliver a really fast
experience for me on my best connection.

51
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.320
But maybe for
a slow device it's not so good.

52
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:32.210
So field data, shows a much different
story sometimes than lab data.

53
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.520
That's why it's really
important to capture.
