00:00:00.145 --> 00:00:05.142
So when we think about these three kinds
of data, it's important to think about

2
00:00:05.142 --> 00:00:10.378
the signal and the noise as in what is the
value that you're getting from this data?

3
00:00:10.378 --> 00:00:12.477
And then how noisy is it?

4
00:00:12.477 --> 00:00:16.323
So lab data, is obviously very low signal.

5
00:00:16.323 --> 00:00:20.714
It's a general idea of how well
your computer would perform or

6
00:00:20.714 --> 00:00:25.372
how well your site performs in
the best possible circumstances.

7
00:00:25.372 --> 00:00:30.370
There's no noise I mean, it's here's
the data, right what you think it is,

8
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.958
but the data is not as valuable
as it would be otherwise.

9
00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:38.322
Synthetic data is a little bit more,
it's also measuring a real network.

10
00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:39.856
How a server really happens.

11
00:00:39.856 --> 00:00:42.409
And it's measuring it
continuously over time.

12
00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.331
Every minute it's trying to do it again.

13
00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:47.118
And so
it's much more valuable than live data.

14
00:00:47.118 --> 00:00:51.411
There's a little bit more noise,
because their machine might not work quite

15
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:56.248
perfectly every time, it might go offline,
their network might go down or whatever.

16
00:00:56.248 --> 00:01:01.514
Field data has considerably more signal,
because it is what real users

17
00:01:01.514 --> 00:01:06.532
the real people that you care
about,that data can come back to you.

18
00:01:06.532 --> 00:01:10.147
But as I said,
there's a lot of noise in it as well.

19
00:01:10.147 --> 00:01:12.132
There's a lot of people
who will visit your site.

20
00:01:12.132 --> 00:01:14.756
There's a lot of bots that
will visit your site,

21
00:01:14.756 --> 00:01:18.852
that will send you data that does not
matter and that you don't care about and

22
00:01:18.852 --> 00:01:22.248
that you wish wasn't in your data
that you have sieve through.

23
00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:27.560
And so there's a trade off here between
how much noise you want to deal with,

24
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.141
how much confidence you
want you need in your data.

25
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:33.337
Now we can get some of this data.

26
00:01:33.337 --> 00:01:39.132
Some of this data is published through
some means that you might be surprised by.

27
00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:44.157
So we're gonna do another exercise here,
and this one should be faster.

28
00:01:44.157 --> 00:01:49.127
There is a data source called
the chrome user experience report.

29
00:01:49.127 --> 00:01:54.319
Now, unbeknownst to many of us,
Chrome has been capturing these real

30
00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.159
user experience reports from you and
pulling it back to Google for

31
00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.527
years, the browser itself has been
gathering it for all the websites and

32
00:02:04.527 --> 00:02:09.025
pulling it back and
publishing this data publicly monthly.

33
00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:14.091
You can see how well every site on the,
well, the top million sites

34
00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:20.174
on the internet performed for the real
users that hit them according to Chrome.

35
00:02:20.174 --> 00:02:25.148
Now, this data is sometimes kind of hard
to work with, there's a bunch of advanced

36
00:02:25.148 --> 00:02:29.716
tools, but fortunately, there is
a website that has made this super easy.

37
00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:34.553
So in this exercise,
we're going to page three,

38
00:02:34.553 --> 00:02:37.558
or example three on our sheet.

39
00:02:37.558 --> 00:02:44.424
And there is a link on the bottom
cruxcompare.netlif.app.

40
00:02:44.424 --> 00:02:48.639
This is a site that exposes
that Chrome user data and

41
00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.687
allows us to see what it actually is.

42
00:02:51.687 --> 00:02:55.222
So what I want you to do is I
want you to to go into each

43
00:02:55.222 --> 00:02:59.037
of these of those four websites and
enter the URLs in.

44
00:02:59.037 --> 00:03:02.992
Which we can probably just just do
together here for the first one, but

45
00:03:02.992 --> 00:03:05.350
I want you to have experience using this.

46
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.109
And it's going to produce from the last
month of data, which is what this

47
00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.666
particular website is publishing, what the
scores are for all of the core metrics.

48
00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:19.305
What I want you to do is I want you
to capture this number up here,

49
00:03:19.305 --> 00:03:22.536
which is the piece, or
the 75th percentile number and

50
00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:26.060
we'll talk about what that
means specifically in a minute.
