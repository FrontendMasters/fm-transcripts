00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.677
Now, I have an earlier version of our
website that doesn't perform quite

2
00:00:04.677 --> 00:00:05.810
as well.

3
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.920
And we're gonna use that for
some of our demos and exercises today.

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.310
This is the repository that I sent
out as part of the prerequisites.

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.212
So toddhgardner/perf-training-website
It is a Node JS

6
00:00:22.212 --> 00:00:26.500
powered backend that just
simulates our servers.

7
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.700
It drives a single index dot HTML file,
there is not a whole lot of magic in this.

8
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.278
In order to get it up and running,
you need to download it or you know,

9
00:00:37.278 --> 00:00:38.850
clone it locally.

10
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.039
Run npm install and then NPM start So

11
00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:48.280
here is what the structure of
this app generally looks like.

12
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.281
This website, as I said,
is just a single HTML file,

13
00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:54.865
all the files that are served
as part of our web application.

14
00:00:54.865 --> 00:00:59.277
Are here in the public folder,
we serve an index.html file and

15
00:00:59.277 --> 00:01:02.533
then a hand full of CSS images and
Java script.

16
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.595
That we'll be playing with over
the course of this section.

17
00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:10.900
The server, you don't really need
to worry about as part of this,

18
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.777
this is just simulating our web
server in various different states.

19
00:01:14.777 --> 00:01:17.969
You can obviously look at it if
you'd like and see how it works, but

20
00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.877
don't worry about getting mired
in it if you don't want to.

21
00:01:22.047 --> 00:01:27.471
The server itself is listening on
port 3000, so if you open it up.

22
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:30.325
And load it once you get it running,

23
00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:35.000
it looks like this,
which obviously, is not ideal.

24
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.245
There's all kinds of stuff that
might not be great for our brand or

25
00:01:38.245 --> 00:01:42.380
our performance on this site right
now that we're going to look at.

26
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.470
There's some nasty privacy banners and
chat apps getting in the way.

27
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.339
And the website itself is, it's just
kind of just kind of slow to load.

28
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.559
We're going to play with this,
and take a look at what,

29
00:01:56.559 --> 00:02:01.410
how does this version of the app perform
and what can we do to make it better?
