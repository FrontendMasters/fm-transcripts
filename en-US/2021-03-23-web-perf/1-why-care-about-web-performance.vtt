00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.610
Let's dive in and
start on part one, understanding.

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.640
We're gonna look at three
things as part of part one.

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.350
First, we're gonna talk about
psychology a little bit.

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.002
We're gonna do a psycho 101 course,

5
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:17.180
specifically about how people
think about performance.

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.090
And I'm gonna give you some homework, some
exercises that we're gonna do together.

7
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.922
So that you can understand
what those performance mean,

8
00:00:24.922 --> 00:00:29.160
and how does that tie into the metrics
that we're going to attach.

9
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.730
Then we're gonna talk about those metrics.

10
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.922
We're gonna talk about
measuring that performance, and

11
00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:37.270
the different aspects of
how fast the site is.

12
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.140
And then we're gonna talk
a little bit about statistics.

13
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.924
And we're gonna look at how you think
about the data that you collect from those

14
00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:44.450
metrics.

15
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.290
All right, why is performance important?

16
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.887
Clearly, a whole bunch of
you think it's important

17
00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:58.640
because you're here today with me,
but objectively why do we care?

18
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.907
And it would be remiss of me not to
point out the plethora of studies out

19
00:01:04.907 --> 00:01:09.136
there from lots of different
organizations to talk about.

20
00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:15.280
Hey, we improved load time of our site by
one second and we got 2% more revenue.

21
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.530
Yep, that's great.

22
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.358
Or another site that says, hey,

23
00:01:20.358 --> 00:01:26.318
we rose our conversion rate by 18%
by dropping our load times cool or

24
00:01:26.318 --> 00:01:31.620
CloudFlare, saying, hey,
here's all of these sites.

25
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.528
And when you hit these different load
times your conversion rates go up and

26
00:01:36.528 --> 00:01:39.310
down by various different percentiles.

27
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.707
Of course, these are all companies and
consultancies and products that

28
00:01:44.707 --> 00:01:48.530
build their brands on performance and
helping you do performance.

29
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.440
So you got to take all of these studies
with a little bit of grain of salt.

30
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.892
And any chart you see about this,

31
00:01:54.892 --> 00:02:00.500
you do need to kind of consider
here's a chart that I really like.

32
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.414
Now, this is a chart that plots the global
average temperature versus the number

33
00:02:05.414 --> 00:02:07.810
of pirates in the world.

34
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.302
And we see that there's a direct
correlation that as the number of pirates

35
00:02:12.302 --> 00:02:15.350
has fallen,
the global temperature has gone up.

36
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.150
And so clearly this means that global
warming is caused by our lack of pirates.

37
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.058
But of course,

38
00:02:25.058 --> 00:02:29.294
that's ridiculous because we need to
remember as we see these statistics.

39
00:02:29.294 --> 00:02:32.342
The correlation is not the same
thing as causation and

40
00:02:32.342 --> 00:02:36.610
that these are very complex
systems that we're talking about.

41
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.524
And usually there's no one metric
that perfectly correlates with or

42
00:02:40.524 --> 00:02:42.420
that perfectly causes another.

43
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.257
And so, anytime we're thinking about this,

44
00:02:46.257 --> 00:02:50.860
we have to bring some skepticism to it and
critically analyze our thinking.

45
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.218
All right, more important than those
studies are two very important reasons

46
00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:59.280
the performance is important.

47
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.070
And the first is because Google says so.

48
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.710
And that's really important
because whether we like it or

49
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.430
not, Google owns a big
portion of the Internet.

50
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.871
And they have stated that
coming this year in 2021,

51
00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:21.790
they are going to break your sites
base on your performance course.

52
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.500
And so if you have bad performing sites,

53
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.647
starting this year,
you're gonna start losing customers,

54
00:03:28.647 --> 00:03:33.607
losing clicks directly from Google
search results, which is a big deal.

55
00:03:33.607 --> 00:03:38.574
It's a really big deal, it's going
to make or break a lot of companies,

56
00:03:38.574 --> 00:03:40.536
a lot of, Travel websites.

57
00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:46.250
Is gonna break a lot of content sites
that put too many ads on their screen.

58
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.584
It's probably gonna break some advertising
providers that can't get their stuff out

59
00:03:49.584 --> 00:03:51.130
fast enough.

60
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.457
But focusing on performance,
especially right now,

61
00:03:54.457 --> 00:03:58.370
is really, really important and
so I'm glad you're all here.

62
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.298
Google cares about this a lot, for the
same reason, you should care about this

63
00:04:04.298 --> 00:04:07.400
a lot and that's the second
reason we care about performance.

64
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.107
It's because angry and frustrated users,

65
00:04:11.107 --> 00:04:16.290
because you're taking too long to show
them their stuff, won't stick around long.

66
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.022
If your site's a low value thing,
like a content site,

67
00:04:21.022 --> 00:04:25.860
they might leave they might go,
I'm gonna do something else.

68
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.482
If it's a high value, like a service and
application they're in,

69
00:04:29.482 --> 00:04:33.930
they're gonna slowly look for alternatives
or a competitor might come along, and

70
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.870
if they can be a little bit faster,
you'll lose them.

71
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.691
This is why Google thinks it's really
important to rank your sites this way and

72
00:04:42.691 --> 00:04:47.540
why your business is gonna be dependent on
how fast you can get your app to perform.
