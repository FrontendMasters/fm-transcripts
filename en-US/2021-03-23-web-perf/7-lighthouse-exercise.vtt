1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.610
We're gonna take a look at putting
some objective measurements on

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.950
these same websites.

3
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.501
So what I want you to do is go to
the Exercise 2 tab on that same

4
00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:14.340
google sheet that I gave you before.

5
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:22.570
And we are going to run chrome
lighthouse on each of these four sites.

6
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.113
And what I want you to do is I want you
to record the first contentful paint,

7
00:00:27.113 --> 00:00:32.102
largest contentful paint and cumulative
layout shift that score that you see for

8
00:00:32.102 --> 00:00:34.750
each of the four websites.

9
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.960
Remember, opened them up in an incognito
window so it doesn't know who you are.

10
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.310
Run the site run the lighthouse report.

11
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.680
They'll take 30 seconds or so
per site and record your scores.

12
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.310
And then we're going to come back and

13
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.370
we're going to talk
about how these related.
