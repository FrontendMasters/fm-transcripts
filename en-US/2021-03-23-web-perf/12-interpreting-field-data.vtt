WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.430
But we have to think about
what that data means.

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.660
So let's take a look at
some quick statistics.

3
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.470
Cuz field data is different than lab data,
when we get lab data, we get a score.

4
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.281
So our website was ranked
95 in a lighthouse score.

5
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:22.060
So we think, yeah, that's great.

6
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.107
But if we take corresponding
field data to that same score,

7
00:00:27.107 --> 00:00:29.810
we get lots of different scores.

8
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.670
We had some people who had that 95.

9
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.020
We have some people who had 100,
and had a way better experience.

10
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.010
But we also had some people who had a 64,
and had a really crappy experience.

11
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.371
And so we have to figure how
do we interpret this data.

12
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:46.541
What do we think that this means?

13
00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:48.710
Because 95 isn't the whole story.

14
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.252
There's a wide range of experiences and

15
00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:55.320
understanding what that means
can change what you do.

16
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.672
Now when you look at that field data,

17
00:00:58.672 --> 00:01:02.470
we have to understand that
we're taking a sample.

18
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.520
This is not all browsers will report this,
especially web vitals.

19
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.412
Because the web vitals interfaces,
the APIs in the browser that

20
00:01:12.412 --> 00:01:17.610
report this data is only in
blink-based browsers today.

21
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.410
Firefox hasn't implemented it.

22
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.560
Safari hasn't implemented it.

23
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.251
This is just in Chrome and Edge.

24
00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:27.050
These are the only people
sending this data.

25
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.809
Now fortunately, there's a whole
lot of people who use that.

26
00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:35.960
And so we still have a pretty
significant sample size.

27
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.320
But there's bias in that data
that we need to be aware of.

28
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.581
So for example, the red section of this,
this is browser usage that

29
00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:52.360
I captured off of internet stats website
as of recently, 2020 aggregated.

30
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.440
It might be a little different now.

31
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.850
But for the purposes of our conversation,
it's fine.

32
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.100
So all of the red is Chrome.

33
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.762
And the green, which is Edge is now based
on blink, now that they moved over to it.

34
00:02:04.762 --> 00:02:06.848
And so we get data from them as well.

35
00:02:06.848 --> 00:02:14.370
Unfortunately, 14% of that
Chrome section says it's Chrome.

36
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.640
But it's Chrome on your iPhone,
which isn't really Chrome.

37
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.570
It's a Chrome wrapper
around the Safari engine.

38
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.217
And so it does not report web vitals.

39
00:02:24.217 --> 00:02:27.860
Because it doesn't have the API to do it.

40
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.030
So the data here is going to be skewed.

41
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.289
It's gonna be biased.

42
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.010
The data might have a positive
bias on desktops because Chrome is

43
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.540
gonna represent a percentage of the users.

44
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.010
But those users who use Chrome
are probably more modern machines.

45
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.051
They probably keep them
up-to-date a little bit better.

46
00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:54.323
And it's going to ignore all of
the old versions of Internet Explorer.

47
00:02:54.323 --> 00:02:56.610
It's gonna ignore all the Firefox users.

48
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.640
It's gonna ignore the privacy of people
who are privacy aware and use Brave and

49
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.360
Opera and those sorts of things.

50
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.810
We can also infer that it might
have a negative bias on phones.

51
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.484
Because the data that we'll get from
from mobile devices is all gonna be from

52
00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:14.680
Android.

53
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.060
It's not gonna be from iPhones at all.

54
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.895
Android devices tend to be
quite a little bit slower

55
00:03:21.895 --> 00:03:25.950
on web applications than iOS phones.

56
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.940
And so mobile data is gonna skew worse
than the actual average experiences.

57
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.927
And for Mac OS users for
MacBook Pros, that sort of thing,

58
00:03:36.927 --> 00:03:42.440
which have a pretty high adoption
of Safari relative to Chrome.

59
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.151
There's still a lot of Chrome,
still majority Chrome, but

60
00:03:45.151 --> 00:03:46.330
there's a lot of Safari.

61
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.950
We're not gonna report that.

62
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.240
We're gonna underreport
that percentage of users.

63
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.435
So as you think about this data and
interpret it to your own user base,

64
00:03:57.435 --> 00:04:02.740
you just have to think about these
biases and pull them into your data.

65
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.330
Another thing we should think about
is how do we roll up these numbers.

66
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.530
So we have a whole bunch of different
scores that come in from field data.

67
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.080
And let's say we're gonna be
super simple about it, and

68
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.740
we're just gonna take the average.

69
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.747
Well, the averages kind of
sucks a lot of the time.

70
00:04:20.747 --> 00:04:25.987
Because here's an average of 80
based on these set of scores 3,

71
00:04:25.987 --> 00:04:29.834
99s, 3, 90s, 3, 70s and 3, 60s.

72
00:04:29.834 --> 00:04:34.410
Well, mean 80 is right.

73
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.150
But it's really half of my users
have a totally unacceptable score.

74
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.273
Here's another example also 80.

75
00:04:42.273 --> 00:04:47.030
This is the majority, my users,
have a pretty great score.

76
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.200
But I have two people who are just so
bad that they drag the average down.

77
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.390
And they get seemed like I'm
not doing as well as I am.

78
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.400
And so averages are very misleading.

79
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.540
And so most of the time,
field data is interpreted in percentiles.

80
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.390
And what I mean by percentiles is median.

81
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.842
So a median half of your users will
have a better score than the median.

82
00:05:11.842 --> 00:05:15.330
And half of your users
will have a worse score.

83
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.518
So the median in this case,
or the 50th percentile is 95.

84
00:05:19.518 --> 00:05:22.980
That's a very important number.

85
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.210
And it's interesting.

86
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.679
But for Google's purposes,
they usually care about the p75

87
00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:33.410
number which is 75% of your users
have a better score than this.

88
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.830
Google cares about that cuz
they're saying, you know what?

89
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.467
We're gonna eliminate a big chunk of
people who have a really crappy experience

90
00:05:40.467 --> 00:05:41.940
on the Internet.

91
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.360
But most people will
have this score better.

92
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.730
And so we're gonna rank you based on that.

93
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.578
From your own personal perspective,

94
00:05:50.578 --> 00:05:53.830
I think it's really
interesting to care about p95.

95
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.270
p95 basically gives you the idea
of what your worst user sees.

96
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.380
It's not actually your worst.

97
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.119
But a lot of the time,

98
00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:08.350
your worst score from field data
is gonna be so hilariously bad.

99
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.880
You can't even imagine how it is possible.

100
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.692
It's going to be from a boat in outer
Mongolia that runs on a 486 processor and

101
00:06:16.692 --> 00:06:20.680
has no idea how to load
a modern web page at all.

102
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.360
It is going to be so hilariously bad
that you won't think it's real data.

103
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:33.207
And so usually, you have to lop off
the worst 5% of users as erroneous data.

104
00:06:33.207 --> 00:06:35.818
And p95 is usually
a common consideration for

105
00:06:35.818 --> 00:06:38.110
what your worst users would experience.

106
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.295
So how would we interpret that?

107
00:06:42.295 --> 00:06:44.070
Let's look at some real data.

108
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.820
This is a bunch of made up data.

109
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.480
Let's look at some real data.

110
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.950
Here's some charts from real
field data for real websites.

111
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.617
And let's see what does
this tell us about it.

112
00:06:55.617 --> 00:06:57.082
So here's the chart,

113
00:06:57.082 --> 00:07:02.027
and it shows us how many users experienced
the site in each of these buckets.

114
00:07:02.027 --> 00:07:05.960
So almost 2,000 people loaded
a page in less than a second.

115
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.680
Little, fewer and the median loaded
it in less than two seconds.

116
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.360
Little, fewer left in less than three
seconds, and that is our 75th percentile.

117
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.900
So at this point,
we've covered 75% of our users.

118
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.757
3 seconds are faster,
feels like a pretty fast site.

119
00:07:23.757 --> 00:07:26.336
But then the long tail comes out.

120
00:07:26.336 --> 00:07:28.870
And it slows down very gradually and

121
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.510
the 95th stretches all
the way out to 7 seconds.

122
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.790
And so we have a wide distribution for
even sites that we feel are super fast.

123
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.410
Here's another example from a real site.

124
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.910
Now this long tail
stretches out really far.

125
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.740
And it's not a perfect
normal distribution.

126
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.050
So the site itself is obviously slower.

127
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.696
The median is at four or five seconds.

128
00:07:55.696 --> 00:07:59.390
The 75th is all the way
up at eight seconds.

129
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:03.392
But somewhere up here,
between 10 and 15 seconds,

130
00:08:03.392 --> 00:08:09.600
we seem to have more users have this
worse experience than the ones around it.

131
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.334
There's something about our site
that makes this particular behavior,

132
00:08:14.334 --> 00:08:18.240
this particular performance
more likely than it should be.

133
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.680
And so that would be worth exploring more.

134
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:27.660
The 95th is obviously just terrible, the
worst users are seeing 20 seconds or more.

135
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.215
Here's a hilariously bad site
that almost has an inverse

136
00:08:34.215 --> 00:08:39.670
distribution where it is really unlikely
for people to have a good experience.

137
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:41.090
Some people obviously do.

138
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:46.040
These are probably people who work in the
same building that your web server is in.

139
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.877
But most people, the most frequent
performance is 30 seconds or more,

140
00:08:50.877 --> 00:08:55.710
which is just a hilarious thing that
you would never imagine happened.

141
00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:00.909
But this is real data captured from
real websites through request metrics.

142
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.560
So this data can take all
kinds of different forms.

143
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.683
So when you start measuring
your own field data,

144
00:09:08.683 --> 00:09:13.350
you have to look at it thinking,
I have a distribution of users.

145
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:19.420
That distribution is biased based
on where my data is coming from.

146
00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.080
And then what does that
data tell me about my site?

147
00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.350
And how it performs for
different classes of users?

148
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:30.254
Now I know those are a bunch of
abstract questions because they are,

149
00:09:30.254 --> 00:09:31.770
every site is different.

150
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.500
I can't tell you what your
performance charts mean to you.

151
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.060
Because every application
stack is different.

152
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.220
What your code does is different,
who your users are serving are different.

153
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.164
And so I can't give you a,
here's how to make your site fast answer,

154
00:09:47.164 --> 00:09:50.200
because that's going
to be relative to you.

155
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:55.000
But looking at your data can help
you understand what your real

156
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.670
user experience is.
