00:00:00.204 --> 00:00:04.308
Today we are gonna be talking
about improving web performance.

2
00:00:04.308 --> 00:00:09.855
And what that means is that we're gonna
look at some real world techniques

3
00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:16.311
on how to make your performance experience
better for both your users and for Google.

4
00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:22.924
So that you can get better search rankings
and more people visiting your site.

5
00:00:22.924 --> 00:00:26.669
Today's course is gonna be
split into three parts.

6
00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.142
In the first part, we're gonna talk
about understanding web performance and

7
00:00:31.142 --> 00:00:32.236
what does it mean?

8
00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:35.249
We're gonna talk about
the metrics that we're gonna use.

9
00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:39.108
We're gonna talk about the old
metrics that people used to use and

10
00:00:39.108 --> 00:00:41.225
the new metrics that are emerging.

11
00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:45.830
We're gonna talk about how to measure them
and what these different things mean.

12
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.580
In part two, we're gonna focus on
actually improving those metrics.

13
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.049
We're gonna look at some real
world techniques that you can use

14
00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.097
today to improve each individual metric.

15
00:00:57.097 --> 00:01:01.506
And we're gonna focus on which
tactics improve which metrics so

16
00:01:01.506 --> 00:01:06.829
that you can to try and fine tune what
you need to work on for your application.

17
00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.232
And then part three, we're gonna wrap up,
and we're gonna talk about some planning.

18
00:01:10.232 --> 00:01:13.106
So how do you bring performance
into your project and

19
00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:15.730
not make it something
that is an afterthought?

20
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.877
How do you make performance
something that you bring forward and

21
00:01:19.877 --> 00:01:23.580
is part of your overall
application development cycle?

22
00:01:26.277 --> 00:01:27.130
Who am I?

23
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.317
I am Todd Gardner, on most online sites,

24
00:01:30.317 --> 00:01:36.431
you'll find me with the handle
@ToddHGardner, which is really mysterious.

25
00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:39.280
I'm very anonymous on the internet.

26
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.599
I'm a software developer and entrepreneur.

27
00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:46.577
I've been writing web applications for

28
00:01:46.577 --> 00:01:51.260
probably longer than I
care to admit right now.

29
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.230
And often I've taken
those applications and

30
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.629
I found a way to solve real world problems
with them and turn them into businesses.

31
00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:02.474
I'm nearby where the front
end masters headquarters.

32
00:02:02.474 --> 00:02:09.110
I'm in Stillwater which is about 30
minutes away from all these fine people.

33
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.932
When I'm not doing this, I work a lot
with a couple of different products.

34
00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:14.340
The first is track js.

35
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.572
It's a JavaScript error monitoring tool.

36
00:02:16.572 --> 00:02:19.872
So make some better JavaScript.

37
00:02:19.872 --> 00:02:23.990
And more recently, I've been working a lot
with a product called Request metrics.

38
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.486
Which is monitoring real user performance
and simplifying those numbers down.

39
00:02:30.486 --> 00:02:34.647
I've also been here before, I have another
course in the Frontend Masters catalogue

40
00:02:34.647 --> 00:02:37.436
called Debugging and
Fixing Common JavaScript Errors.

41
00:02:37.436 --> 00:02:44.203
Where we dive in and look at real bugs and
how to fix them and how to use the tools.

42
00:02:44.203 --> 00:02:46.044
So if you like my style and
what we're doing,

43
00:02:46.044 --> 00:02:47.600
you should check out my other course.
