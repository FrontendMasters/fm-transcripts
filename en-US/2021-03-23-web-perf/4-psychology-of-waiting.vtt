00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.380
So what we're just experimenting
with is the psychology of waiting.

2
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.190
Each of us waited while
we watch the site's load.

3
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.403
And each of us had a different feeling,

4
00:00:12.403 --> 00:00:17.240
a different perception of how much time we
spent, and whether that time was worth it.

5
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.090
And that wait time is subjective.

6
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.748
We can't necessarily say what is okay

7
00:00:23.748 --> 00:00:26.770
to one person is going
to be okay to the next.

8
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.520
But, we can think about it and
apply some general rules.

9
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.542
Let's say I go out to the pub,
and I walk up to the bar, and

10
00:00:38.542 --> 00:00:41.996
not that you can walk into
a bar these days, but

11
00:00:41.996 --> 00:00:46.890
let's say I did, and the bar was empty,
as it clearly should be.

12
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.100
Well I could go up and order a drink, and
the bartender should get right to me.

13
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.080
I should have a very fast interaction.

14
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.126
But the bartender probably
expected the bar to dead, and

15
00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:01.440
so he took his sweet time about it.

16
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.961
And even though I might have only
waited a minute to get my drink,

17
00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:11.930
it felt like a long time, because
the bartender didn't have anything to do.

18
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.390
And I didn't have anybody to talk to,
and I was just bored.

19
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.805
Whereas, if I go into a pub in
the before times, the pub will be busy,

20
00:01:20.805 --> 00:01:22.850
there'd be people there.

21
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.290
I'd wanna talk to them, and
I'd go up to the bar and

22
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.970
I'd order a drink, and
it might also take a minute or so

23
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.860
to get me my drink because
the bartender's busy doing other things.

24
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.367
But there's a bustling scene there,
and I'm talking to people, and

25
00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:40.620
I'm seeing what's going on.

26
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.876
And so it doesn't feel as
long because I understand why

27
00:01:44.876 --> 00:01:47.810
the bartender took that time.

28
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.880
And I had other things
to do during that time.

29
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.047
And that's what's important to understand
because that applies to the web as well,

30
00:01:56.047 --> 00:02:01.620
is how much time we spend depends on our
expectations of how long it should take.

31
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.140
And what we can do while we're waiting.

32
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.090
And this is called perceived performance.

33
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.320
So there's some general rules that
we can extract from this around

34
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.140
the psychology of waiting.

35
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.584
And the first is that people want to start
their activity, they want to get going.

36
00:02:21.584 --> 00:02:28.890
If we give them a way to start earlier,
they feel like the wait time is less.

37
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.031
But if they want to start and we are
slowing them down, they're gonna feel like

38
00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:37.320
it's more, even if objectively we're
only doing the same amount of wait time.

39
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.024
Second, bored time feels slower,
if the user doesn't have anything to do,

40
00:02:45.024 --> 00:02:50.020
they don't have anything to look at,
the time will go slower.

41
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.580
I think many of us will instinctively
understand that if you've ever

42
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.370
taken a road trip in the times
before electronics, and

43
00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.510
all you had to do was
stare out the window.

44
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.820
You were bored.

45
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.800
You had nothing to do.

46
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.571
The car trip took forever,
even if it was only two hours.

47
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.190
Anxious time feels slower
than relaxed time.

48
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.899
If you're at a website and
it's bringing up, say medical records,

49
00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:22.363
how a lab test went or whether or
not you're approved for a loan for

50
00:03:22.363 --> 00:03:26.840
a house or something else that
is a high stress activity.

51
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.719
That time feels slower than if you're just
clicking on something that doesn't matter,

52
00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:33.680
because you're worried about it.

53
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.377
You want to get through to it and
you curse that loading screen

54
00:03:37.377 --> 00:03:41.306
that's keeping you from
understanding what the future holds.

55
00:03:42.465 --> 00:03:46.532
Unexplained wait times feel
slower than explained wait times,

56
00:03:46.532 --> 00:03:51.126
that bartender with nothing to do that
time felt slower because I didn't

57
00:03:51.126 --> 00:03:53.856
understand why it was taking them so long.

58
00:03:55.975 --> 00:04:02.570
If I don't know why I'm waiting,
that also feels slower.

59
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.507
Like how long am I going to wait for?

60
00:04:04.507 --> 00:04:06.640
How long is this gonna take?

61
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.529
Is this gonna be a minute,
five minutes, ten minutes, an hour?

62
00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:16.260
if I don't know how long this is gonna be,
it feels forever.

63
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.220
And the sixth and final rule that I
have is that people will wait for value.

64
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.200
If something is more valuable to you,
you'll wait longer for it.

65
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.846
But if it's an article on CNN about
nothing, well, if it doesn't load pretty

66
00:04:36.846 --> 00:04:40.640
quick, you're just gonna get bored and
move on with your day.
