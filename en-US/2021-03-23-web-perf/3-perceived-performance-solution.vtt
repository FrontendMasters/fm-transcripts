00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.796
I imagine that each of you probably had
a slightly different experience with this.

2
00:00:05.796 --> 00:00:10.805
Because what we're talking about is
perceived performance, what your

3
00:00:10.805 --> 00:00:16.648
expectations were of the sites, and where
in the world you were located to see that.

4
00:00:16.648 --> 00:00:18.731
But that was your real performance,

5
00:00:18.731 --> 00:00:23.040
the number that you care about the most
if we were to actually rank the sites.

6
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.320
Now we probably have different scores,
but here's how I rated them.

7
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.625
I thought NPR was the fastest,
I felt it was the fastest,

8
00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:38.050
followed by the New York Times,
The Wall Street Journal, and last CNN.

9
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.057
And so let's talk about why,

10
00:00:41.057 --> 00:00:45.760
why did we feel these things were slow or
fast?

11
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.819
Well, NPR to me felt fast, because
the ads were an afterthought, I had all

12
00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:57.560
the content I wanted, but the reasons
why I came to the site, were all there.

13
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.778
And then, there were some ads,
but they weren't intrusive,

14
00:01:00.778 --> 00:01:02.120
they weren't in my face.

15
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.866
Whereas the CNN, it's like the ads
were the first thing that loaded,

16
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:12.540
it grabbed my attention, which is
obviously what the advertisers want.

17
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.907
But as a consumer going there looking for
what's the news of the day,

18
00:01:16.907 --> 00:01:22.260
it was distracting, and it slowed
down the actual content of the page.

19
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.090
New York Times and Wall Street Journal
had various degrees of that as well.

20
00:01:29.567 --> 00:01:33.954
So, how might the business
models of these applications or

21
00:01:33.954 --> 00:01:37.690
these companies have affected that?

22
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.728
Well, NPR is a publicly
funded organization and

23
00:01:40.728 --> 00:01:46.650
advertising revenue is just crazy, it's
just as if they can get a little bit more.

24
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.003
But they don't need to put ads,
so they can,

25
00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:53.630
they can just deliver
the best content they can.

26
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.786
Whereas CNN is completely advertising
funded, that's how they get their money,

27
00:01:58.786 --> 00:02:01.860
they take advertisers and
they put them on their television.

28
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.610
They put them on the bottom scroll, they
take video they put it on their website.

29
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.462
Because they're a video driven company,

30
00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:13.857
many of their advertisements are also
video driven, which is bandwidth heavy.
