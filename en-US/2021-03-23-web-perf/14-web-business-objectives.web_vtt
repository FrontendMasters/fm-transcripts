WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.903
We're going to move on to part two,
which is all about how do we go about

2
00:00:04.903 --> 00:00:10.010
improving these metrics now that we
understand generally what they are.

3
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.568
We're going to talk first about the
business objectives of building websites,

4
00:00:16.568 --> 00:00:20.590
which is the thing that
really drives all of this.

5
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.880
None of us are building web applications
purely out of the joy of it.

6
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.910
Well, some people definitely are.

7
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.410
I know a few people who build websites for
art.

8
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.000
But most of us here today, I think are
building websites because it's our job.

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.620
And it's our job because somebody
is making money off of them.

10
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.720
So we should talk about how
performance influences money,

11
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.520
because ultimately that is gonna be
the driver of why we do any of this.

12
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.986
Then we're gonna go through each of
those four web vitals we talked about.

13
00:00:50.986 --> 00:00:55.947
And discuss techniques and
apply some techniques to improve each one,

14
00:00:55.947 --> 00:00:59.770
when you would do it and what to consider.

15
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.340
And throughout all of that,
we're gonna be doing some code demos.

16
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.204
We're going to be doing
some coding together and

17
00:01:05.204 --> 00:01:06.710
we're gonna be doing some exercises.

18
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.290
We're done with the spreadsheet
worksheet from part one, but

19
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.109
we're gonna be using some
other stuff this time.

20
00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:18.226
All right, let's get into it.

21
00:01:18.226 --> 00:01:22.370
Let's talk about the objectives
of a web business.

22
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.626
So if your company,
if your organization has a website or

23
00:01:26.626 --> 00:01:31.070
a web application, it's usually for
one of four reasons.

24
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.918
To build awareness for what you do and
what your products are,

25
00:01:36.918 --> 00:01:41.714
to retain customers to keep them around so
that they keep paying you.

26
00:01:41.714 --> 00:01:47.060
To convert new customers you're trying
to attract a group of people and

27
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.046
get them to check out from your store or
subscribe to your service or

28
00:01:52.046 --> 00:01:55.180
watch your training or whatever that is.

29
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.684
Are you and through all of those,

30
00:01:56.684 --> 00:01:59.720
you might be just trying to
compete with other people.

31
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.882
And there's other players
in the market and

32
00:02:01.882 --> 00:02:04.740
you want to have a better
website than theirs.

33
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.910
And that's great.

34
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.511
All of these are really important for
us to think about in terms of performance,

35
00:02:10.511 --> 00:02:13.230
because this is where
the money comes from.

36
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.317
This is where the money comes from the
drives all of our time and our money and

37
00:02:16.317 --> 00:02:16.909
our efforts.

38
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.916
There's an interesting thing to consider,

39
00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:23.780
specifically when we
talk about competition.

40
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.212
So if we're building a website, and

41
00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:31.243
we want to compete with other people who
might be doing similar things to us.

42
00:02:31.243 --> 00:02:35.550
Well, being faster is cool,
and something to brag about.

43
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.952
But being faster really only matters,

44
00:02:38.952 --> 00:02:45.052
is really only detectable by a person
If it's at least 20% faster.

45
00:02:45.052 --> 00:02:47.523
As then, if you're just fractions,

46
00:02:47.523 --> 00:02:51.081
like ten milliseconds faster
than your competitor and

47
00:02:51.081 --> 00:02:56.123
you claim to be faster, well,
nobody cares, nobody's gonna notice that.

48
00:02:56.123 --> 00:03:01.400
That you have to be at least 20% faster
than your competitor for people to matter.

49
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.960
And so what does that look like?

50
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.010
Well, I changed some things and
can check some things out.

51
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.786
This is a little app called
lightestapp.com which allows you to run

52
00:03:12.786 --> 00:03:19.070
synthetic chrome lighthouse reports for
multiple websites and compare them.

53
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.862
So I compared myself with some
competitors to see how we did.

54
00:03:22.862 --> 00:03:27.377
At the top is my website at
requestmetrics.com, and then three other

55
00:03:27.377 --> 00:03:31.980
performance related companies speedcurve,
calibre, and pingdom.

56
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.108
And I recorded where the largest
contentful paint happens for each of them.

57
00:03:40.108 --> 00:03:42.500
Well, I circled each one.

58
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.474
This is the point at which the majority
of the content has now rendered

59
00:03:47.474 --> 00:03:48.602
on the screen.

60
00:03:48.602 --> 00:03:54.109
Our website, thankfully,
was the fastest at 0.6 seconds.

61
00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.980
The next fastest was speedcurve which
load at 0.9 seconds, which is 50% slower.

62
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.370
So more than 20% people will notice
that we're faster than speedcurve.

63
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.122
Calibre was 1.2 seconds which is double,

64
00:04:11.122 --> 00:04:15.090
were twice as fast as calibre.

65
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:23.120
And pingdom was 1.5 seconds, so we're 150%
faster or they're 150% slower than we are.

66
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.347
So if I wanted to come in and compete and

67
00:04:25.347 --> 00:04:29.130
say we're the fastest
performance monitoring app.

68
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.351
Well, people would actually notice that,

69
00:04:31.351 --> 00:04:34.002
that would be something that
we could say and prove.
