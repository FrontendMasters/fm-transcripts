1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.412
In summary, what we're gonna focus on
is always be producing content, right.

2
00:00:06.412 --> 00:00:09.161
They're also the most important
things that we have to focus on.

3
00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:12.681
We have to focus on
always building things,

4
00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:18.455
always pushing things out via Twitter,
Twitch, blogs, anything like that.

5
00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:24.170
Doing our profiles correctly and
writing our resumes in a really,

6
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.740
I want to say offensive but really in a
way where we shine the best versus having

7
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:39.110
the HR members think I've been
reactive to what HR says, right?

8
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.425
So that's the biggest thing that I want to
try to get across to you guys from when it

9
00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:49.762
comes to getting your first front end job,
it's all about making yourself shy.

10
00:00:49.762 --> 00:00:55.120
Think of it, you're a piece of
the puzzle for every team, right?

11
00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.130
So you should only focus on being
the best piece of that puzzle,

12
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.020
not trying to be everything that
everyone needs on everywhere.

13
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.260
So that's what I want you to go from and
if you learn anything from this, go for

14
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.180
taking the things that
you learn in here and

15
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.040
focus on being the best piece of that,
right?

16
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.410
I'll be consistently
adding things to here.

17
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.910
There's something that you want me
to add or you want me to review,

18
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.180
make sure you hit me up on Twitter and
I can add to here.

19
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.930
This is gonna be open source,
this is gonna be live for

20
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.370
the rest of my days posted on GitHub,
posted on our Frontend masters.

21
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.210
So you guys will be able to
have all this stuff with you.

22
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.670
I want to do a huge shout
out to Ayumi Bennett,

23
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.670
who did all of the notes all of the really
fun, cool weird things that you guys see.

24
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.770
That was all her, I do not have
a talent for any of this stuff.

25
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.650
She's a great sketch artist, and we worked
and we did this talk and it was just like,

26
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.380
this is pretty fine, let's do this again
and now that's she's who created art.

27
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.180
So definitely if you see her,
if you want something similar like this,

28
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.140
please reach out to Ayumi,
right, she's a rock star.

29
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.290
Yeah, so that's it,
do you guys have any questions for me?

30
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.270
Any feedback, any questions,
anything you want me to dive deeper in or

31
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.945
anything like that?

32
00:02:16.925 --> 00:02:21.331
&gt;&gt; There's people that are asking for
that resume, that example resume,

33
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:24.605
so if you could link that up
in the site at some point.

34
00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:27.383
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can, if you want me to,
I can link this up.

35
00:02:27.383 --> 00:02:32.040
So yeah, if you guys want that,
I'll share that and you guys link it or

36
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.930
I can make an entire page just for
that, does that sound cooler more?

37
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.420
So if you want to deep dive
on the technical side or

38
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.630
interviewing more technical, Jim Young.

39
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.750
I actually just did a podcast with him,

40
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.690
he's a really great guy,
little weird but super funny.

41
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.468
He has a technical interviewing
workshop here on front end masters and

42
00:02:52.468 --> 00:02:55.270
it's great,
you should definitely check it out.

43
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.000
I think these will work really well in
conjunction, minds focus on making sure

44
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.870
you get the eyes and he has focused
on what happens once you get

45
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.470
beyond those eyes and now you're in
the room and they're grilling him.

46
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.090
So I think they work
really well in Unison.

47
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.660
&gt;&gt; There's a question here about if you're
remote or from, say, a different country,

48
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.720
what's the best way to
find places to apply to?

49
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.030
&gt;&gt; It depends from what I've seen,
we use VWC,

50
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.190
we use LinkedIn,
we use Google, we use Twitter.

51
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.340
Most of my guys and
girls have found jobs on Twitter.

52
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.470
That was a good 50%,
half of them have found their

53
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.910
job through an HR recruiter that was
looking at their stuff on Twitter.

54
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.460
But LinkedIn is a great place, and

55
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.150
also to pins on what you're
trying to do as well.

56
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.010
For instance, different regions have
different stacks that they really focus

57
00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.570
on, if you're in the south
eastern United States.net PHP and

58
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.215
Java Spring Boot, reigned supreme.

59
00:04:04.215 --> 00:04:07.775
But if you were to go further west coast,

60
00:04:07.775 --> 00:04:13.695
you have a lot more nodeJS Express,
Python, flask, Django framework.

61
00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:17.230
So it all depends on what you're
trying to work on as well.

62
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.150
&gt;&gt; Is it a good strategy to reach out to
more experienced devs on LinkedIn and

63
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.000
ask for advice?.

64
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.690
&gt;&gt; I would do that via Twitter.

65
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.140
People tend to be a little more like,

66
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.870
get off my lawn on LinkedIn
than they are on Twitter.

67
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.798
So having those type of conversations
they don't slide in DMs,

68
00:04:35.798 --> 00:04:40.000
more experienced engineers they like to
have those conversations out in the open

69
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.490
because you never know who
else needs that information.

70
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.160
And your question could be helping
other people who are in similar place,

71
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.605
but didn't ask that question.

72
00:04:51.605 --> 00:04:55.785
So I would move that expertise to Twitter.

73
00:04:55.785 --> 00:04:58.715
Unless you were looking for a mentor,
then I would, you know what?

74
00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:01.245
I will still use Twitter,
most of the people who are willing

75
00:05:01.245 --> 00:05:05.935
to help the most in my experience,
have been on Twitter.

76
00:05:05.935 --> 00:05:08.645
&gt;&gt; Yeah, a person just said, dang,
I really need to make a Twitter.

77
00:05:08.645 --> 00:05:10.380
&gt;&gt; Yes, you really need to make a Twitter.

78
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:18.060
I have a rule that tell people Facebook is
where everybody you already know is at,

79
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.280
Twitter is where everyone you
need to know is at, all right?

80
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.650
So and same with LinkedIn, most of
the people that I deal with on LinkedIn,

81
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.600
I already dealt with him, but
I found them through Twitter, right?

82
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.380
So that's all you know part
of your funnel, right?

83
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.870
You can loot treat that
as a marketing funnel,

84
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.280
you go on Twitter, you find the people
who you wanna connect with,

85
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.350
you build rapport with them,
then you go find them on LinkedIn.

86
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.770
Then you follow them or
connect with them on LinkedIn, right?

87
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.960
You start with the informal way,

88
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.500
remember Twitter's like a bar
of intellects and stuff, right?

89
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.720
So, especially if you're focused on
just JavaScript stuff, get in there,

90
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.020
have those conversations, ask questions.

91
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.575
And no one's gonna judge you for
not having for asking questions,

92
00:06:02.575 --> 00:06:06.050
cuz more questions you ask, and someone
else that has those excellent questions.

93
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.900
So that's what I would recommend.

94
00:06:11.792 --> 00:06:14.528
&gt;&gt; And
does that also extend beyond the US or

95
00:06:14.528 --> 00:06:16.738
do you feel like it's,
&gt;&gt; Yes,

96
00:06:16.738 --> 00:06:18.870
it definitely extends beyond the US.

97
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.650
Some of my favorite people that I've met
or I've leanred from aren't in America and

98
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.240
it's because of Twitter.

99
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.640
So yeah, it's a global thing.

100
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.650
Do you guys have any other questions?

101
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.260
I'm one of those people that are on
Twitter, that you can ask questions to.

102
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.180
I am always there,
ask away if you need me to review stuff,

103
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.450
I'm fine with that too,
I do this for my veterans every day.

104
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:50.820
So, I'm always on here
doing that type of work,

105
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.725
well I deal with veterans,
I deal with civilians.

106
00:06:52.725 --> 00:06:56.400
If you'd need to review something you had
or you want to ask an opinion or something

107
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.699
or get more clarification, just hit me up
and I can definitely talk to you about it.

108
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.670
&gt;&gt; Looks like there's another question on
how do I discover new people on Twitter?

109
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.792
Do I use hashtags?

110
00:07:07.792 --> 00:07:11.090
&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] yeah, we got a hell
of a whole class on Twitter for

111
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.135
developers, right?

112
00:07:12.135 --> 00:07:16.490
[LAUGH] A discovery on Twitter.

113
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.202
You can start with some of
the more basic characterized,

114
00:07:19.202 --> 00:07:22.890
has 100 days of code that runs on
one days code, hashtag, JavaScript.

115
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.940
Or you can start looking at
people's list or find list and

116
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.160
look through those, because that's
where a lot of the magic is happening.

117
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.000
Now people are making lists
of people you should follow,

118
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.410
based upon their expertise of
things that you're looking for.

119
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.740
So awesome, great.

120
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.400
If you're a newbie,
number one and they're two

121
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.770
Twitter's you should be following
if you're brand new to this game.

122
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.140
If you're brand new, you go to code
newbies, follow them on Twitter, and

123
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.670
then you should go to practical Dev and
follow them on Twitter.

124
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.940
Then from there, you'll start being able
to find people, other people that you can

125
00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.360
follow on Twitter by going
through list and hashtags.

126
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.460
But first use profiles,
if you're new to the code

127
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:11.190
game is code newbies and practical Dev.

128
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.770
Another one I could
recommend is CSS tricks,

129
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:20.564
CSS tricks they are always dropping some
good nuggets, so I'll definitely do that.

130
00:08:20.564 --> 00:08:25.770
And just go from there,
dive in though don't ask questions

131
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:30.900
look up Java look up hashtag, JavaScript
and just research people and jump in.

132
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.128
Or you can need to follow me too,

133
00:08:33.128 --> 00:08:37.630
if you asked me who should you follow on
Twitter, I'll be like, where you're at and

134
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.500
then I'll pointing direction to three or
four people.

135
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.305
And no problem, Richard, you're welcome.

136
00:08:45.305 --> 00:08:47.710
&gt;&gt; What frameworks do you recommend?

137
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:55.670
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I cannot legally recommend
frameworks because every job is different.

138
00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:00.750
I am a huge, I focus on react
which isn't a framework, but

139
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.150
your experience may be different.

140
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:07.240
I don't want to influence what your
opinions on frameworks, but I love react.

141
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:13.300
But you might love you,
you might love spelt,

142
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.590
you may enjoy working with Angular, you
may be that person that brings Ember back.

143
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:19.580
We don't know.

144
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.070
So I'm not gonna try to influence
which direction you're gonna go.

145
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:30.800
I'm gonna say for jobs, that the two that
are most prevalent in the area are React

146
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:36.740
and Angular, just because those
are the oldest and most stable, right?

147
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:43.230
View is coming up, Ember is waning, there
are some big corpse that work in Ember,

148
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.980
but there aren't allowed a new
Ember jobs coming out, right?

149
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:53.890
So you're talking purely from
the aspect of getting a job,

150
00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.800
I will focus on React and Angular.

151
00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:02.800
&gt;&gt; A recommendation you made I think
is to find your local meetups.

152
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:08.710
But what about during the fact
that everybody isremote and

153
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.478
not a lot of conferences and
meetups are happening in person?

154
00:10:11.478 --> 00:10:15.265
&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually,
they're not in person, but

155
00:10:15.265 --> 00:10:18.579
they're all virtual go to you solution,

156
00:10:18.579 --> 00:10:23.141
Tracy Lee, let me go to GitHub,
Tech Community slacks.

157
00:10:23.141 --> 00:10:27.190
So, you go here,
I'll add this to my summary.

158
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:33.760
You can find the slack channels
that are popular in your locale.

159
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.810
And you can just based on frameworks,
languages,

160
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:40.520
whichever low place you're at, and you can
start building relationships in there.

161
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.900
But all it really takes is one person
you ask for a person's time, or

162
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.110
you ask a person question estimate or
any other feedback estimates or

163
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:52.680
anything to read, and
it just goes from there, right?

164
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.760
It just begins with one, mine, Ken
Wheeler, he's a board member of mines now.

165
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.470
But when I met him seven, eight years ago,
I was asking questions about

166
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.760
slick cuz he actually made
that slick slider in jQuery.

167
00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.250
And a lot of people don't know that.

168
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:13.870
But that was our first time
interacting and really, he was open,

169
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.650
he was able to help me work through
some things and I was a brand new Dev.

170
00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:22.690
So that's how that goes, in one
conversation to another conversation.

171
00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:29.660
My first time meeting Zed A Shaw, he
writes Learn Program in the Hardway books.

172
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.610
It was because I was
talking about vets and

173
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.490
come to find out he was a veteran, right?

174
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.710
So I built that rapport
based on both of us.

175
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:40.260
Being veterans and both haven't been
stuck in Korea, and we both know how

176
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.910
boring Korea can get, cuz you can
do everything there in 30 minutes.

177
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.190
If you end up there in the right time,
3 or

178
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.360
4 months you can do everything in Korea.

179
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.680
So I was just able to build
that rapport off of it and

180
00:11:54.680 --> 00:12:00.180
just he keeps building what you're
looking for is this you have to shift

181
00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:05.035
how you build relationships in a physical
plane to avoid cracking and stuff.

182
00:12:05.035 --> 00:12:09.120
[LAUGH] You have to shift to how you build

183
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.600
relationships in a physical
plane to a virtual plane.

184
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.100
All that is,
is just talking to people like Eddny.

185
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.764
If you're on Twitter say, hey,
we had a really good time.

186
00:12:17.764 --> 00:12:20.949
I'd love to if you should point me to
somebody else to talk to about these

187
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:22.660
subjects where you ask me questions.

188
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.432
I'm always gonna be there to answer
questions cuz this is what I do.

189
00:12:25.432 --> 00:12:31.600
So don't hesitate to start with me and
then branch out.

190
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.800
And I'll help you build
those relationships.

191
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.360
Well, my name is Jerome Hardaway.

192
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:43.050
I'm a geek event Sukkot and I had a blast
and I hope that you guys enjoyed it too.

193
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.690
And I will see you guys on Twitter.
