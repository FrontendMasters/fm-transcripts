1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.914
This is the part everybody
has a question for it.

2
00:00:01.914 --> 00:00:07.773
This is the part everyone
has a billion questions for

3
00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:12.575
building a portfolio that works, rules.

4
00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:15.881
You have to showcase your experience and
the tools are the major tools needed.

5
00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:20.350
What I do, how I do it make sure
you put your personality in it.

6
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.639
Make it exciting while also
using design psychology right?

7
00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:27.468
So you know when people
read from right to left,

8
00:00:27.468 --> 00:00:31.595
you know that the handle how hamburger
means have nav menus are done.

9
00:00:31.595 --> 00:00:33.762
They have nav menus straight across,

10
00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:38.400
then when you minimize them they go to
the hamburger menu on the right side.

11
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.489
And then you press and then it comes
to drop down, and you know all that.

12
00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.108
So follow the rules that makes
the Internet simple and boring,

13
00:00:46.108 --> 00:00:48.808
cuz we do not want our users to think,

14
00:00:48.808 --> 00:00:53.900
particularly the HR who has six
seconds to look at your website.

15
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.546
So you don't want this person to
figure out how to work your website,

16
00:00:56.546 --> 00:00:59.530
cuz now you are just gonna
throw it away next right?

17
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.995
So you want to put all your content at
the top that your introductory pitch.

18
00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:07.774
Make it so it's up there, so
they'll see that, add your face or

19
00:01:07.774 --> 00:01:08.758
don't add your face.

20
00:01:08.758 --> 00:01:15.860
But make sure that part is professional
and eyecatching at the same time Right?

21
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.170
When it comes to your projects,
I always vouch on one deep level,

22
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.460
like well thought out project over three.

23
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.760
You see it everywhere.

24
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.466
Everybody has three projects that
are done a little bit at a time,

25
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:34.221
and they're not even really fleshed out.

26
00:01:34.221 --> 00:01:36.605
Essentially they're ugly babies right?

27
00:01:36.605 --> 00:01:39.557
And they haven't really
done enough to make them

28
00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:42.155
stand out as really well thought out apps.

29
00:01:42.155 --> 00:01:45.488
You are going to get a lot
further doing one app

30
00:01:45.488 --> 00:01:50.333
a lot better than you were doing
three apps that were just subpar.

31
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:53.110
So focus your energy on that.

32
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.718
Then the most important part
is having a contact form.

33
00:01:57.718 --> 00:02:02.930
You do not want to just put your email,
cuz that's how you get spam.

34
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.848
And you also don't want to be in
a situation to where they have to go

35
00:02:06.848 --> 00:02:09.002
somewhere else to reach out to you.

36
00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:11.259
You want to be able to
capture that information,

37
00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:13.140
capture that user right then and there.

38
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.730
This is just business 101, right?

39
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.700
You can use a great tool
that I like to push and

40
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.120
teach my veterans about is emai.js is
serverless is focused on JavaScript.

41
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.110
You can slide your email right
into the JavaScript, and

42
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.980
then you can make a form and
you can use it.

43
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.922
Great example, going back to example

44
00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:40.250
right here, so here's Adrian.

45
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.270
He has eye popping, he says what
he's doing a lot of magic going on.

46
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.477
You press the screen, look at that,
there's magic all over the place.

47
00:02:52.477 --> 00:02:54.212
I could play with this for hours right?

48
00:02:54.212 --> 00:02:59.174
Now I want him to move this up but
this is how he has all his information for

49
00:02:59.174 --> 00:03:01.520
quickly for you to look at.

50
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.784
Scroll down here's a directory statement.

51
00:03:06.784 --> 00:03:10.770
You find his tinkering say GitHub or
COPPA, here's his projects.

52
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.886
Use his portfolio Islam has projects, and

53
00:03:14.886 --> 00:03:19.007
he has a crazy Nordic like, what's this?

54
00:03:19.007 --> 00:03:24.280
Yeah, crazy Rockbed project,
my goodness, okay, cool.

55
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.670
And he has sent me a message.

56
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.326
I'd love to hear from you where you have
some message where you could type and.

57
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.987
There we go and it works.

58
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.142
And has success message.

59
00:03:48.142 --> 00:03:52.509
So you wanna make sure that you can
do that and capture all the emails so

60
00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:53.950
nice clean, simple.

61
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.473
Remember, these things are meant for

62
00:03:58.473 --> 00:04:02.579
things to be fast now, let me see,

63
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.081
Here we go, Jason Savage.

64
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:19.840
This is another project where he's, yeah,
his hair does not look like that anymore.

65
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.480
He's actually a mentor for VWC.

66
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.630
His higher, he has a bunch of projects are
being automatically pulled in from GitHub.

67
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.497
Then he has all the skills
that he's using.

68
00:04:37.412 --> 00:04:42.490
And a badge, I don't know where that badge
come from, but another contact form.

69
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.829
This is what you always want.

70
00:04:44.829 --> 00:04:49.424
You always want a contact form.

71
00:04:49.424 --> 00:04:51.660
You want to capture that information.

72
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.395
I cannot stress that enough.

73
00:04:53.395 --> 00:04:56.829
You do not want them going
to a secondary location

74
00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:59.640
to find you to find out how to reach you.

75
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.280
You don't want them having to
go to LinkedIn cuz guess what?

76
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.629
They get on your website, they love
your stuff, they want to talk to you,

77
00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:08.493
and then I got to go to LinkedIn and
send them a my message and

78
00:05:08.493 --> 00:05:11.310
Bill over here asked them for
their opinion on something.

79
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.277
They go there check out what Bill's
talking about on that resume bill,

80
00:05:14.277 --> 00:05:16.063
Bill's looking at giving it to go, no go.

81
00:05:16.063 --> 00:05:18.170
Then they come back over here and
it's like what was I doing?

82
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.508
And then they go to the lunch, and
then after that, they come back and

83
00:05:21.508 --> 00:05:23.421
guess who didn't get a message, you.

84
00:05:23.421 --> 00:05:28.836
So make sure that everything that you
want in your portfolio is there and

85
00:05:28.836 --> 00:05:30.920
you have the contact form.

86
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.078
Does everybody get that?

87
00:05:34.078 --> 00:05:40.356
&gt;&gt; Yeah, would you say that you should
build that portfolio completely yourself,

88
00:05:40.356 --> 00:05:45.244
or is it okay, to use something
like Bootstrap, semantic UI,

89
00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:47.940
material UI something like that?

90
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.196
&gt;&gt; I get this question a lot.

91
00:05:50.196 --> 00:05:54.395
I think that as a front end developer,

92
00:05:54.395 --> 00:06:02.965
you will get dinged a little bit as your
entry level if you use a CSS framework.

93
00:06:02.965 --> 00:06:06.066
Cuz I understand I get it,
the CSS frameworks make them easy.

94
00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:07.615
I absolutely love Bootstrap.

95
00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:10.895
You just throw it up and
just by using their stuff,

96
00:06:10.895 --> 00:06:15.350
you can have a nice looking
site within 30 minutes, right?

97
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.912
I get it.

98
00:06:16.912 --> 00:06:20.519
However, when you're looking
at today's current UI,

99
00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:25.430
the CSS frameworks were created,
because how hard it was to do layout.

100
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.310
And now we're in a stage of CSS and

101
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:34.350
stylings that you have grid and
flex that does a lot of that work for you.

102
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.842
So what that says to an HR person is,
I don't know if this person understands or

103
00:06:38.842 --> 00:06:43.212
the tech lead, I guess would be the person
you had to worry about on this one.

104
00:06:43.212 --> 00:06:47.730
I don't know if this person understands
grid or flex, because you're using

105
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:52.060
bootstrap, and bootstrap,
doing all that work for them, right?

106
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.940
So that's another layer of complexity
you're adding to your interview.

107
00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:01.138
Remember, you want to influence everything
by making sure that hey, the least amount

108
00:07:01.138 --> 00:07:05.540
of questions that you get asked when
your interview because of what you show.

109
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.979
And if you use bootstrap or
semantic UI or tailwind CSS,

110
00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:13.763
which are all great tools
to build things with.

111
00:07:13.763 --> 00:07:16.719
When it comes to your portfolio's
entry level developer,

112
00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:19.270
they can get in the way and
be a little problematic.
