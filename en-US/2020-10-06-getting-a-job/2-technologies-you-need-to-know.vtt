1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.950
Technologies you need to know
that to get a job, right?

2
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.250
So these are technologies
as an entry level developer

3
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.940
that are going to put you above the other
devs or at least help pick the interest

4
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.830
when they see this on your resumes and see
this on your content that you're making.

5
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.800
It's gonna help you get the attention
of people that are looking to hire you.

6
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.500
So you need a strong
understanding of the Big Three.

7
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.270
Everybody that says they know HTML,
CSS and

8
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.650
JavaScript, knowing how to write it and
knowing the why behind writing it,

9
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.040
and how to write it, while you're
writing it, is a big difference.

10
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.030
When it comes to HTML, you need to
understand Semantic Web and SEO.

11
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.100
You need to understand
about HTML validators.

12
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.860
You need to understand why it's so
important to write a Semantic HTML,

13
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.900
because doing Semantic HTML helps web
crawlers know which information is

14
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.200
most important, which helps websites SEO,
which also helps with accessibility.

15
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.300
Which makes it easier for

16
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.150
the web users, you'd be amazed how
many people write really bad HTML,

17
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.510
they dev all the things, then they
force it to do their bidding with CSS.

18
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.100
And then especially in past two years, the
website gets hit with a huge lawsuit for

19
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.980
web accessibility, because
everything was done wrong or weird.

20
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.720
You need to understand that and
be able to have those that use cases,

21
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.510
the why you do it a certain way.

22
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.900
CSS, knowing CSS,
just to change colors is great.

23
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.130
You also need to learn how to do
animation, a little bit of animation.

24
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.410
Not a lot like text transform, style
transformations, things of that nature.

25
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.971
You'll have a deep dive on it for

26
00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:50.520
you to be able to understand it as well
as make sure you understand grid and

27
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.700
flex, front end masters has
several great courses on that.

28
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.540
And understanding the why, for

29
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.980
instance, I was a big fan of grid
when it came to larger sites.

30
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.120
But that was when I had a more monolithic
thought process of building websites.

31
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.880
Once it came to more modular,
I focus on more smaller components

32
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.990
of building websites,
that's when I started making my

33
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.450
products more focused on flex because it
gave me more control of what I was doing.

34
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.350
Now if I'm using something that has
a lot of data that has to manipulate and

35
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.020
move around as we're going from
desktop to mobile or mobile desktop,

36
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.360
as we're like switching between those
devices, then yes, I will use grid,

37
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.420
if you had a table with
a lot of data points, and

38
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.680
rows, and all that stuff, right?

39
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.460
That's when I will use grid.

40
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.400
But for everything else, I use flex.

41
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.940
I also recently learned that
grid is slower than flex,

42
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.185
which helped influence me
to make more decisions,

43
00:03:02.185 --> 00:03:05.357
to say if I can try using flex, I will.

44
00:03:05.357 --> 00:03:09.253
So these are the type of conversations and
ideals that you need,

45
00:03:09.253 --> 00:03:14.090
when you're building things, and
when you're interviewing, so that way you

46
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.442
can have these type of conversations,
so you can lead with influence.

47
00:03:18.442 --> 00:03:21.922
So they're like,
you've played with it enough,

48
00:03:21.922 --> 00:03:25.106
you work with it enough to
understand the gotchas,

49
00:03:25.106 --> 00:03:28.899
the sacrifices that you have
to make based upon technology.

50
00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:30.342
JavaScript, same way,

51
00:03:30.342 --> 00:03:34.191
you need to understand that most
especially as an entry level dev,

52
00:03:34.191 --> 00:03:39.715
most of the websites that you're going to
be on that you're gonna be working on.

53
00:03:39.715 --> 00:03:45.510
It's gonna have some older writing
styles with them and be using jQuery.

54
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.090
So you need to learn a not
just JavaScript, but

55
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.960
a little bit of how to transform
jQuery into JavaScript.

56
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.970
So there's a great website.

57
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.450
I should put it in here.

58
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.050
I'll put in my notes for later.

59
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.920
It's called you You don't need jQuery and
they actually walk through how

60
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.630
to use a DOM selector in lieu of jQuery
to like do things I highly recommend it.

61
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.800
It was a fun site, one of my friends,
Adam Dylan, he showed it to me.

62
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.690
He's a great example if you're on
Twitter of a person to follow who's

63
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.270
strong in the front end game,
comes from a graphic design background and

64
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.840
learn front end on his own,
just because he loves building a product.

65
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.260
So that's a great tool.

66
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.880
&gt;&gt; How rock solid do you
have to be on the HTML,

67
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.095
the CSS, and then we'll leave
JavaScript to another question?

68
00:04:46.095 --> 00:04:48.310
But do you need to be able to

69
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.079
whip up a page without even thinking or
you just got to know.

70
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.560
Obviously, everybody can write it,

71
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.280
but can you if you're given a design,
can you pound that design out

72
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.490
in 20 minutes without even
thinking just by looking at it?

73
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.956
&gt;&gt; I have yet to see a 20-minute
interview challenge with HTML CSS.

74
00:05:12.956 --> 00:05:15.635
I've seen like there's some
competitions that do that.

75
00:05:15.635 --> 00:05:20.330
But this is a job, this is a profession so

76
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:27.030
you have to be pretty solid on
the fundamentals as well be able to share.

77
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.120
This is where how I find the fundamentals,

78
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.740
being able to show that
you're a great communicator.

79
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.890
Well, if you don't know something or
saying how you would find it,

80
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.740
that takes you make suggest
as well when it comes to

81
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.870
looking for being solid and
these problems or any issues.

82
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.060
So you have to be able to
you have to be solid but

83
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.840
you also have to be able to
communicate if what you don't know.

84
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.120
And be open about and say how you would
find out I just say, I don't know, and

85
00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.640
I'll find out like,
okay, I don't know this.

86
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.610
So my first thing I would
do is go to the MDN,

87
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.230
I would search this on the Mozilla MDN and

88
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.130
see this now if it's still like,
I'm still having an issue with growing it.

89
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.130
What I would do is I would go to CSS
tricks and read a blog post about it cuz I

90
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.170
know CSS tricks probably has something
written on it, or I would go the front end

91
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:24.450
masters and try to do a video on it, try
to see if there's any coursework on it and

92
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.695
go through that before I
attempt to tackle this again.

93
00:06:28.695 --> 00:06:30.946
Cuz you get a deeper dive, right.

94
00:06:30.946 --> 00:06:34.907
So that's what you would do,
you would talk through them and

95
00:06:34.907 --> 00:06:37.937
you might find your
solution based upon that.

96
00:06:37.937 --> 00:06:41.840
They ask you about, how do you center?

97
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.461
How do you center a div or
center square without using float, right?

98
00:06:47.461 --> 00:06:50.844
So you're like, okay,
I know I can do display flex.

99
00:06:50.844 --> 00:06:53.189
I know I can do justify content, but

100
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:56.874
I now remember is the justify
content space in between.

101
00:06:56.874 --> 00:06:58.408
They're like no,
just listen to the sentence go there.

102
00:06:58.408 --> 00:07:02.788
All right, okay, it's just by
content center, right and yeah,

103
00:07:02.788 --> 00:07:04.440
that's exactly right.

104
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.404
Being able to show how you think is going
to help you not answer like not only

105
00:07:09.404 --> 00:07:12.702
answer questions but
to help build trust in him.

106
00:07:12.702 --> 00:07:16.068
Well, you know what you
are passionate about this.

107
00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:20.847
You think about your code you're
communicating just in the end coding,

108
00:07:20.847 --> 00:07:23.446
contrary to popular belief is social.

109
00:07:23.446 --> 00:07:28.038
And you have to be able to talk through
the ideas and the issues that you're

110
00:07:28.038 --> 00:07:32.558
having with people as well as
the problems that you're trying to solve.

111
00:07:32.558 --> 00:07:35.225
So I would say if we
were going to be honest,

112
00:07:35.225 --> 00:07:37.700
we're going to do it from scale on one.

113
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.985
As in,
you just hello world yesterday to attend,

114
00:07:41.985 --> 00:07:45.760
as in you go to a coding
a dark competition and

115
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:51.797
they give you 15 minutes to knock
out airbnbs UI using only HTML CSS.

116
00:07:51.797 --> 00:07:59.450
Like you get first place I would say,
six or seven

117
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:03.210
when it comes to an entry level developer
because these are the fundamentals, right?

118
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.720
These are the things that are gonna
save you your entire career, right?

119
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:13.620
For HTML, CSS, JavaScript, these
are the things these are the big three

120
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.860
because you're on the way up
your this is your domain, right?

121
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.430
Just like in the military.

122
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:23.470
You don't want a person who's a four
when it comes to being a rifleman,

123
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.450
like doing their job around you, right.

124
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.210
That's where my you're laughing.

125
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.940
That's where my experience comes from,
right?

126
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:35.820
Like you know,
I you know you got to at least be 80%

127
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.810
to be around me because
lives are on the line.

128
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:45.470
So same thing you know, at I will
take that same rule that 80% knowing,

129
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.840
being competent enough to build things or

130
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.770
be able to quickly find
a solution build things.

131
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:52.910
That's important.

132
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:57.516
Or be able to expertly talk about
the things that you want to build.

133
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.961
So does that making sense chat?

134
00:09:02.961 --> 00:09:10.870
&gt;&gt; No, your analogy of hello world being
one Coding up Airbnb with only HTML and

135
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:16.510
CSS in ten minutes and
you have to be a six or seven.

136
00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:19.658
That's a great figure
to tell me a ballpark.

137
00:09:19.658 --> 00:09:25.340
Now JavaScript, how good are they?

138
00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.130
I mean, JavaScript gets deep.

139
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:32.690
I mean, there's a lot a big difference
between writing an object, or

140
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:38.340
an array, or a model, or making a, using
a snippet to create a react component,

141
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.480
and like really understanding
functional programming, and closures,

142
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:46.430
and concatenating, and
like how far down the rabbit hole?

143
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.730
Do you got to go?

144
00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:53.750
&gt;&gt; My general rule of thumb when I tell my
veterans is when it comes to JavaScript

145
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:58.250
is there's no such thing as
being over prepared, right.

146
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:03.820
So that is because like you said,
Java's like JavaScript is our battlefield.

147
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:08.830
JavaScript is the fluid
constantly evolving,

148
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:13.380
highly opinionated different
from team in team area, right?

149
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.960
So that's our firefight is front ends,
right?

150
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.940
So when you're dealing with doing
about that there's no such thing as

151
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:27.960
being too prepared, you can really
put a number on it because it

152
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.190
is volatile the way is written
is different from team to team.

153
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:37.700
That's why they have style guides like
the Airbnb style guide if you're looking,

154
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.910
have you ever seen that?

155
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.480
You have style guides,
you have like functional programming,

156
00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.540
object oriented programming,
you have all these things that you have,

157
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.680
that you have to at least be exposed to.

158
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.930
So don't focus on competency
focus on a core competency,

159
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.350
but don't focus on like as an entry level.

160
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.900
Then they're going to expect you
to have complete mastery, but

161
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:06.620
they will expect exposure they will expect
a hunger to know more interest, right?

162
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.670
And start where you're at.

163
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.971
You're a new programmer started ES 2015.

164
00:11:12.971 --> 00:11:14.809
And then as you get comfortable with that,

165
00:11:14.809 --> 00:11:18.450
you're able to build most of your things
are that go backwards compatible, right?

166
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:21.020
Because no one knows all the things,

167
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.670
like contrary to popular belief,
every programmer you're looking up to

168
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.600
Google something that you would not like
they'd be ashamed to tell you every day.

169
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:35.300
It was like six months ago, until I just
realized that if I just do link, Colon,

170
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:41.900
CSS, the style sheet pops up automatically
in my co-editor when it came to things.

171
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.480
I would brain for
how to do it all the time.

172
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:51.390
So everyone is always looking up things we
just get better at googling than others.

173
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:55.857
So don't pick yourself up over that.

174
00:11:55.857 --> 00:12:00.177
It's just that as you get better, your
Google gets better and your ability to

175
00:12:00.177 --> 00:12:05.280
find questions and answers gets better,
and your questions get better.

176
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.610
Just keep plugging away.

177
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:11.130
I always recommend coach challenges or
just talking to people.

178
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:13.060
That's how you know you build a thing.

179
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:18.772
And you converse as being
plugged into your community and

180
00:12:18.772 --> 00:12:25.682
having people who are more advanced
in you on it, it actually helps.

181
00:12:25.682 --> 00:12:30.133
I'm sure Minneapolis has a slack
that's dedicated just to JavaScript.

182
00:12:30.133 --> 00:12:31.771
&gt;&gt; Looks like we have a question in chat.

183
00:12:31.771 --> 00:12:33.417
How important are data structures and

184
00:12:33.417 --> 00:12:35.376
algorithms to an entry
level job interview?

185
00:12:35.376 --> 00:12:40.170
&gt;&gt; Data structures and
algorithms, it varies.

186
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:46.140
Data structures and algorithms comes
into play at the higher level position.

187
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:52.940
So if you're at a agency or startup, they
just wanna know if you can build things.

188
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:58.430
But if you are like, okay, Facebook and
Netflix, yeah, data structures,

189
00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:04.170
algorithms can become super important
especially when it comes to the ideology

190
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:09.240
of big annotation and performance,
because billions of people use those and

191
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.720
there are certain things like autocomplete
when people are searching and

192
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.380
they want to make sure that that stuff and
you understand those tools.

193
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.080
But as an entry level developer,

194
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.120
depending on your background and
the job that you're looking at, it varies.

195
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.060
There are some jobs that have had that.

196
00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.170
No, it was important.

197
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:32.340
There was some jobs where no one cared or
talked about it and

198
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.930
they're both fortune 500 companies.

199
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.360
So like I said, that varies.

200
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:44.410
For entry level dev though, it's
better to be overpaying underprepared.

201
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.980
There's a great course on front end
masters for data structures and

202
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:48.790
algorithms.

203
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:52.560
We're not going over that you would
you're thinking about is the interviewing

204
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.370
process.

205
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.990
Once you get to the end,
this is all about how do we get, you know,

206
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.960
even to the point where a technical person
is talking to us about data structures and

207
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.580
algorithms, right?

208
00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.460
You haven't even gotten to that point yet.

209
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:08.030
So let's move on let's try to
stay focused and on task for

210
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.640
that because why we have to get
the interview before we start talking

211
00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.550
about data structures and
algorithms right?
