00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.500
When it comes to GitHub, a lot of people,
they're only focusing on four things.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.151
They're focusing on repo activity and
used to be in old days that was it.

3
00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:13.820
But now it's repo activity
it's your pin projects,

4
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.010
is your profile,
the GitHub profile itself.

5
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.670
And it's about how you're doing things.

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.070
Is just as powerful as a resume,
it's basically the new way to tell

7
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.660
your story if you're not using a portfolio
or in conjunction with a portfolio.

8
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.214
So, I actually have one
here of one of my troops.

9
00:00:39.214 --> 00:00:43.640
Let me, here you go, Adrian Grimm.

10
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.446
This is his GitHub portfolio,
his GitHuB profile.

11
00:00:49.446 --> 00:00:53.356
It shows a nice picture of him,
this is a good picture,

12
00:00:53.356 --> 00:00:58.132
with him is all happy stuff like
that's Marines smiling, right.

13
00:00:58.132 --> 00:01:03.282
I mean, that's what you get
when you ask a Marine to smile,

14
00:01:03.282 --> 00:01:06.480
[LAUGH] I don't know what to tell you.

15
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.979
This is all his story,
he's making it personal,

16
00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.752
is like you know where he's coming from.

17
00:01:11.752 --> 00:01:15.661
He's coming from artillery to database
admin, he's on Android development.

18
00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:18.524
And now he's with etsuko as
your front end development.

19
00:01:18.524 --> 00:01:25.710
He has added his most used languages,
which I have included here.

20
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.995
Plugins you can use, so you got this.

21
00:01:33.172 --> 00:01:36.642
You have
the GitHub Readme Stats Vercel app,

22
00:01:36.642 --> 00:01:40.762
shout out to Anurag Hazra and
his crew for hosting it.

23
00:01:40.762 --> 00:01:45.076
But this is a Vercel app that
basically makes cards so

24
00:01:45.076 --> 00:01:50.580
you can add to your repos to show
just your stats and your username.

25
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.450
I highly recommend you use these,
because they tell a story.

26
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.660
You have themes, it's pretty awesome.

27
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.730
This is kinda cool, I wish it was
out when I was looking for a job.

28
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.000
I'd use this in a New York minute.

29
00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:13.410
And we have the GitHub
profile views counter.

30
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.802
And it gives you an indicator of how
good your profile is doing, right?

31
00:02:18.802 --> 00:02:26.044
It lets you know how many people shown and
seen your stuff, right?

32
00:02:26.044 --> 00:02:33.196
So going back to this,
I know that his most used languages and

33
00:02:33.196 --> 00:02:40.950
his GitHub status is right here,
he has a little Gif, be here.

34
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.410
I try to tell them not to put their
emails on here because that's

35
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.900
how you get like a bunch of crazy
stuff emailed to you, a bunch of spam.

36
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.790
He has his pin projects,
now pin projects are the things that you

37
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.730
want the employers or
people looking at your site to go towards,

38
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.010
right, you're trying to
influence by design, right?

39
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.580
People by nature are lazy, so when you
put your pin projects repos there,

40
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.130
you're intentionally putting your best
work easiest place for them to find.

41
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.970
So that way they will
gravitate towards it versus,

42
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.350
your most recent repo,
it might be a garbage repo or

43
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.480
something that you just do training or
you playing with the new technology.

44
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.339
So instead of like the more random
process, you are actually guiding them and

45
00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:39.846
making it intentional for them to find the
type of work, find your best work, right?

46
00:03:42.921 --> 00:03:47.150
And here's his contributions
within the last year.

47
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.040
As you can tell, he has been busy,
way busier than me clearly.

48
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.956
He's really been pushing and so
this is something that although as

49
00:03:56.956 --> 00:04:02.242
a community we really try to get hiring
managers to move away from this.

50
00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:08.970
But we have to work with what the world
is, not how we want it to be.

51
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.112
And one of the things that they're doing
is they're still looking at GitHub as your

52
00:04:13.112 --> 00:04:15.551
repo activity, so
you have to prepare for that.

53
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:20.757
My advice is do something like your
portfolio, your profile site, and

54
00:04:20.757 --> 00:04:26.744
consistently and continuously add,
I'm sorry, add features to your profile,

55
00:04:26.744 --> 00:04:32.430
to your portfolio so that way you can
continue to get those squares green.

56
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.720
Changing colors, adding blocks,
add in a dark mode.

57
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.200
Things that you find in community
are cool and you're like okay,

58
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.130
this is how I should do it,
this is what I wanna do, let me go do it.

59
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.600
Going back up here remember
we talked about copy, right?

60
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.550
So this is what he's done up here,
he started copy, he did,

61
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.815
he added some personality to it.

62
00:04:55.815 --> 00:04:59.720
He's talking about the work that he's
done, he's talking about his experience

63
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.600
with that Sukkot, he's talking about his
experience with fun and development.

64
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.905
He has organizations up here,
he's participated in developer program,

65
00:05:07.905 --> 00:05:10.445
mentor and Arctic code vault contributor.

66
00:05:10.445 --> 00:05:15.030
He has everything like his website and
his Twitter up here.

67
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.790
It's a very clean repo and

68
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.470
it's the first thing that
the employer is gonna see, right?

69
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.808
So that's what you wanna do,

70
00:05:23.808 --> 00:05:28.763
like this is a relatively new
thing that they've pushed out and

71
00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:32.985
it's something that you
really want to use as a tool.

72
00:05:32.985 --> 00:05:37.320
As another tool that helps you
break that threshold of becoming

73
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.976
a frontend developer.

74
00:05:38.976 --> 00:05:41.826
There's another guy, Jason,

75
00:05:41.826 --> 00:05:47.532
he does a lot of things at Gatsby,
and I think his is really wild.

76
00:05:47.532 --> 00:05:49.172
I'm not gonna mess around and

77
00:05:49.172 --> 00:05:53.168
figure it out because I'm gonna
mess up spelling his last name.

78
00:05:53.168 --> 00:05:55.605
And I don't want that on camera, so

79
00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:59.860
he [INAUDIBLE] me in the DMs,
so I'm gonna pass on that.

80
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.130
&gt;&gt; Jason.af
&gt;&gt; So I just go jason.af and

81
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.824
I'll be able to find his.

82
00:06:12.383 --> 00:06:18.141
Click and see, this is a crazy portfolio
I just wanted to get your GitHub man,

83
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:19.480
[LAUGH] Here we go.

84
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.838
Yeah, he can do everything great but
grow hair.

85
00:06:22.838 --> 00:06:26.607
So yes,
I hope that goes into this workshop so

86
00:06:26.607 --> 00:06:31.972
he knows that I clown him for
being bald headed on live workshop.

87
00:06:31.972 --> 00:06:36.290
And I can't wait till he sees
this [LAUGH] he's gonna get me.

88
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.500
Yeah, so
this is a great way he has his profile,

89
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.410
he has the projects that
he wants people to share.

90
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.950
He's another person that is
making me look bad on Twitter,

91
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.930
I mean on GitHub with all of
his contributions of the year.

92
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.250
So like this is how it stores and
see this short little bit of information

93
00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.070
that is like okay,
this is all you know about me.

94
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.555
And he's showing a little bit of fun whle
he's talking about the things that he does

95
00:07:04.555 --> 00:07:06.670
right?

96
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.856
As a worker who neds to know about
that you're okay at making drinks,

97
00:07:10.856 --> 00:07:12.311
alcoholic beverages?

98
00:07:12.311 --> 00:07:15.963
But it works, it humanizes him,

99
00:07:15.963 --> 00:07:21.187
makes it easier to approach HR,
it disarms HR.

100
00:07:21.187 --> 00:07:24.437
That's what humor is used,
humor is used to disarm.

101
00:07:24.437 --> 00:07:29.172
It's an amazing disarming tool that we use
in the military when we're going through

102
00:07:29.172 --> 00:07:30.382
crazy things right?

103
00:07:30.382 --> 00:07:34.305
So the humor disarms HR,
to make him seem more personal,

104
00:07:34.305 --> 00:07:36.772
that makes him easier to approach.

105
00:07:36.772 --> 00:07:40.050
So that way they can talk to him
about the options they have.

106
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.110
As a internal developer,
you should use that too,

107
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.320
that's something that we've learned,
mid and senior devs that we use.

108
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.990
When you see all these quirky
things in our Twitters,

109
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:55.090
we're doing that as a way to convey that
we don't take ourselves too seriously.

110
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.395
We are approachable, come talk to us.

111
00:07:57.395 --> 00:08:01.490
Cuz you never know what type
opportunities are gonna be there or

112
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.460
who I can help, so
that's what that's there for.

113
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:09.373
And he's actually really helpful person,
he's follically challenged.

114
00:08:11.206 --> 00:08:14.142
I'm sorry, I just love making fun of him.

115
00:08:14.142 --> 00:08:17.760
[LAUGH] Do we have any
questions about this?

116
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.960
&gt;&gt; Are there examples of
resumes with less experience?

117
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.863
It seems like all of
these are flushed out.

118
00:08:23.863 --> 00:08:27.298
&gt;&gt; Well, let's say Adrian,
he's not really well established.

119
00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:31.316
He's only been learning how to code for

120
00:08:31.316 --> 00:08:36.812
I think a year, so
he's not well established at all.

121
00:08:36.812 --> 00:08:41.736
He's green, he's a rookie,
so I can say that from,

122
00:08:41.736 --> 00:08:46.250
he's come through my
program he's very green.

123
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.024
It just is how hard we
tend to push people.

124
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.672
No, yeah, but he's I think,
yeah, started a year ago.

125
00:08:55.672 --> 00:08:59.427
He started a year playing with
Android stuff then found us,

126
00:08:59.427 --> 00:09:02.216
converted into JavaScript so he's green.

127
00:09:02.216 --> 00:09:05.432
He's green as they get,
he's less than a year into it.

128
00:09:05.432 --> 00:09:09.078
Just a lot of work, which is what I keep
saying, keep producing, keep building.

129
00:09:09.078 --> 00:09:10.948
We're gonna get more into that later,

130
00:09:10.948 --> 00:09:13.611
cuz I want you guys not to be
intimidated by this stuff but

131
00:09:13.611 --> 00:09:17.197
like this should motivate you, to do yeah,
I need to do more work, right?

132
00:09:17.197 --> 00:09:21.225
Cuz the guys out here who they're
calling green and rookies,

133
00:09:21.225 --> 00:09:24.570
they're doing 1000 commits a year, right?

134
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:28.523
So that's the whole mentality,
and when I say there's no.

135
00:09:28.523 --> 00:09:32.172
Bruce Lee actually said it best,
rather be overtrained than undertrained.

136
00:09:32.172 --> 00:09:34.536
He wasn't saying overtraining,
over working out,

137
00:09:34.536 --> 00:09:36.590
he was saying is being over prepared,
right?

138
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.690
There's no such thing as
being over prepared, right?

139
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.761
There's a such thing as
being underprepared but

140
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:43.232
you can't ever be over prepared.

141
00:09:43.232 --> 00:09:48.354
And this is a great example,
somebody who isn't, while they're

142
00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:54.313
newer to code like they are putting in
the work and they're doing those reps.

143
00:09:54.313 --> 00:09:56.893
Because what we do is a skill,

144
00:09:56.893 --> 00:10:02.715
it is a craft that is closer to
alchemy than anything else, right?

145
00:10:02.715 --> 00:10:05.448
It's magic and science combined in one.

146
00:10:05.448 --> 00:10:08.386
We use about thing that you can
learn through academia, but

147
00:10:08.386 --> 00:10:12.600
you only get better of it when you
actually apply it and experience, right?

148
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.161
So that's what you have to do.

149
00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:18.056
The academia part is fine, but
you have to constantly and

150
00:10:18.056 --> 00:10:22.860
consistently build and do things to
really get that level of mastery.

151
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:29.242
&gt;&gt; How would you handle private repos,
and how would you handle,

152
00:10:29.242 --> 00:10:34.165
like I did work for somebody else,
and I have to sign an NDA, so

153
00:10:34.165 --> 00:10:40.362
how do I handle that in a job interview,
showing them the code and all of that?

154
00:10:40.362 --> 00:10:45.792
&gt;&gt; I recommend building a project
on your own that you can host,

155
00:10:45.792 --> 00:10:49.425
that basically showcases your skills.

156
00:10:49.425 --> 00:10:52.409
One project, first and foremost,

157
00:10:52.409 --> 00:10:57.184
having one project that deep
dive is worth more than seven

158
00:10:57.184 --> 00:11:02.690
projects that are like small
boilerplate concepts, right?

159
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:07.377
So one project where you can consistently
add things to is always gonna

160
00:11:07.377 --> 00:11:10.962
be better than you see it
on everybody's portfolio.

161
00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:14.533
They have three projects and
it's all JavaScript calculators and

162
00:11:14.533 --> 00:11:18.350
all this other crap, but
no one cares about any of that stuff.

163
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:23.880
So what you wanna do is,
you wanna focus on just

164
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:29.680
consistently adding to your project,
so that people can see your skills.

165
00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:34.638
Even if you have that hurdle

166
00:11:34.638 --> 00:11:39.482
of NDAs, I can't show you work
cuz of the repo's private.

167
00:11:39.482 --> 00:11:45.356
That's where consistently producing
things for yourself comes into play.

168
00:11:45.356 --> 00:11:49.210
That's just but one example,
like getting your employers attention.

169
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.655
&gt;&gt; How important is it to have green
commits on your GitHub user profile?

170
00:11:54.655 --> 00:11:59.030
&gt;&gt; It depends, sometimes it's an issue,
sometimes it's not.

171
00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:03.100
I have been one of those people
who've never had a lot of green

172
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.240
on my repo activity.

173
00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.691
And because what I've done to do that, is
I've offshored it by doing other things.

174
00:12:09.691 --> 00:12:15.402
Like focusing on education or
talks or writing.

175
00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:19.770
I'm a big writer, right, I do a lot
of writing when it comes to blogs.

176
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:23.374
So, is more of, all right,
this is great, but

177
00:12:23.374 --> 00:12:26.452
you can show your niche in other places.

178
00:12:26.452 --> 00:12:29.103
Like that's just a really good portfolio.

179
00:12:29.103 --> 00:12:33.503
If you have everything else is A1,
they say, your repo activity is great,

180
00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:35.512
this is just one of the indicators.

181
00:12:35.512 --> 00:12:37.680
There are four parts there, right?

182
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.846
So going back here, you have the profile,

183
00:12:41.846 --> 00:12:46.722
you have the plugins,
you have the pin projects.

184
00:12:46.722 --> 00:12:50.110
Then at the very bottom you have
the contributions of the last year.

185
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.370
This is just one part
of four where they're

186
00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:57.350
gonna take all of this to grade you on,
right?

187
00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:01.087
So this person is pushing
really hard to have all four,

188
00:13:01.087 --> 00:13:04.914
done really well,
he's done a really good job of this.

189
00:13:04.914 --> 00:13:10.023
But as long as you have
a nice clean repo I mean,

190
00:13:10.023 --> 00:13:15.533
they're gonna be like okay,
you actually care.

191
00:13:15.533 --> 00:13:20.008
Manicured projects outlay a lot of work
done on projects that don't really care

192
00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.490
about, so that's fine.
