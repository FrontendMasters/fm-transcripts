00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.760
First question is if you have a period
of unemployment, how do you handle that?

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.690
&gt;&gt; If you have a period of unemployment,
you could explain it away

3
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.720
with volunteering or you can,
it really depends on a reason but

4
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.650
our industry is pretty forgiving.

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.970
Particularly if it doesn't
have anything to do with the,

6
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.950
if you're education base as having
to do with what we're doing anyway.

7
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.530
They're usually forgiving of that.

8
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.290
I've had people who they
were in the military and

9
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.670
can stay at home moms and now they're back
out there doing software engineering.

10
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.570
So I would maybe if it was something
positive place what you're doing but

11
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.060
if it was something, not just omit it,

12
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.540
and if they ask you a question
about it then explain it.

13
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.470
But all I say our industry
is pretty forgiving,

14
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.250
forgiving with that type of stuff.

15
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.630
So you had to worry about that too much.

16
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.240
&gt;&gt; How do you handle a bad relationship
with an employer or say a client?

17
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.920
&gt;&gt; You focus on making sure that you

18
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.918
extract the good things
from that great example.

19
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.510
Because the organization I was working
at had a, was also a veteran services.

20
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.060
They had said no to helping to
how bits of code was formed,

21
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.410
which was to help a person,
family in need.

22
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.390
For you guys that don't know, organization
was actually birthed out of a veteran

23
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.950
losing his life and family but
not being able to bury him.

24
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.230
They didn't have the funds to do that.

25
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:47.188
So I used technology, built a website and
I was able to raise $10,000 in 27 hours.

26
00:01:47.188 --> 00:01:53.150
So, even though they say no,
they didn't like the fact that I did it on

27
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.740
my own, or at least my executive director
didn't like the fact I did it on my own.

28
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.460
And I helped his family on life
without them getting any credit for

29
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.980
it, which was super weird.

30
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.900
I was you said no, I get credit for it.

31
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.110
So he was very upset about that and
we had a very bad relationship.

32
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.190
We still have a very bad relationship,
whenever we see each other,

33
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.375
we're scout and
hate on each other the whole time.

34
00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:22.460
So what has helped me is

35
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.300
continuing the good working relationships
with my main manager at the time.

36
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.780
She was actually a person who I recently
had to call to give me a recommendation

37
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.100
as little as I think four months ago.

38
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.090
So that's how you do that
you continue building,

39
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.985
you keep the good relationships
that you have had with that.

40
00:02:42.985 --> 00:02:45.560
And you keep those intact,

41
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.080
right versus focusing on that
negative person, especially if it's

42
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.455
something that was outside of your
control with a client or something.

43
00:02:53.455 --> 00:02:56.540
Cuz there's good and
bad like things go wrong.

44
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.690
Project, I mean, no one understands
it better than technical people.

45
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.270
Every project goes, it goes over the time
limit and it cost twice as much.

46
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.790
We know everything's bad,
everything's falling red it,

47
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.940
everything's basically a really
bad Reddit stream, right?

48
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.070
So what you do is you focus on the good,
and

49
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.320
you keep pushing out the good as long as
the good outweighs the bad, no one cares.

50
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.200
&gt;&gt; Is there a limit of how much
experience you should list?

51
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.510
&gt;&gt; I would try to keep
everything on one page.

52
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.290
So if it's not,

53
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.960
especially if all the stuff is not
relevant to what you're doing.

54
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.290
Obviously in the same industry, I would
focus on just whatever's in the industry

55
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.220
and try to keep it as focused on
your soft skills as possible, right?

56
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.490
&gt;&gt; How do you feel about making
a non-traditional web resume instead of

57
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.320
a Word doc making a website or
in some cases,

58
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.520
people have seen a side scrolling
video game, that kind of thing.

59
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.590
&gt;&gt; If you're talking about your portfolio,
that's one thing, but

60
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.520
if you're talking about just a resume that
you're gonna end up handing off to people,

61
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.330
they're gonna end up printing off and
things of that nature.

62
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.540
I'm against it mainly because the rule the
name of the game is keep it simple, silly.

63
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.240
So you got to keep this resume to
the light, you have three users, right?

64
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.180
So you're making a video game user how
they're gonna be able to upload that

65
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.720
to their HR tech.

66
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.560
They're not gonna be able to do that.

67
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.950
If you have some crazy design PDF thing
how are they gonna be able to upload that.

68
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.350
I'm not gonna be able to do it.

69
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.330
So you have to do that and

70
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.550
ideally it was your resume, keep it to
the lowest common denominator, right.

71
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.560
HR person isn't gonna be taken a call, the
robot is just gonna be looking for words

72
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.820
like literally what they're gonna do, the
tech is gonna convert your resume either.

73
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.160
If this PDF or
Word is gonna convert it to a JPEG and

74
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.750
use machine learning to pull
the words right off the JPEG.

75
00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:00.605
So don't waste time trying
to fancy things up.

76
00:05:00.605 --> 00:05:03.650
The rules I focus on it
resumes are super simple.

77
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.010
Don't use a Serif font
because we're in tech,

78
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.420
San Serif font look traditional
download moderate, so

79
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.600
keep it like that and try to keep it
as clean and concise as possible.

80
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.150
So I'll try to keep my resumes up to
one no longer than one or two pages.

81
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.020
Even now I try to make it two pages I
don't know why I just throw stuff away

82
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.400
because it doesn't help keeping it long,

83
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.020
isn't gonna help how long resume
isn't helped me get a better job.

84
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.370
A strong resume is what
helps you get a better job.

85
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.590
So you got to think of
strength versus length, right?
