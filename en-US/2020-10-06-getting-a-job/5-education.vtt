1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.530
So let's talk education.

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.320
Now, I do not have a CS degree.

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.030
I have a criminal justice degree
because I was in the military,

4
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.748
security forces which focus on
security and law enforcement.

5
00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:21.681
I minored in marketing after I
got the criminal justice degree.

6
00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:26.910
I have absolutely zero experience on
the technical side of doing anything.

7
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.240
I learned everything through much like
everyone else, the hard knocks of life,

8
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.510
going through and
learning stuff, boot camp stuff,

9
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.996
learning stuff, old school style.

10
00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.540
I never used YouTube,
but I was a big blogger.

11
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.302
I love reading blogs, David Walsh,
his blog is my favorite book to read.

12
00:00:46.302 --> 00:00:50.652
I wish I could just pour tea and
just read that blog,

13
00:00:50.652 --> 00:00:55.402
get paid to read it out loud for
Audible all the time, but

14
00:00:55.402 --> 00:00:59.870
they won't.

15
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.623
There you go for those of you guys
looking for it, David Walsh, amazing.

16
00:01:05.623 --> 00:01:10.204
He used to work at Mozilla.

17
00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:15.877
He's the GOAT, right,
he is the greatest of all time.

18
00:01:15.877 --> 00:01:20.248
So definitely check out his
blog if you're looking for

19
00:01:20.248 --> 00:01:25.961
things to read on JavaScript, and
just being making yourself better.

20
00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:27.306
I highly recommend it.

21
00:01:27.306 --> 00:01:31.328
But that's where I learned a lot of my
stuff when I first started that and MDN.

22
00:01:31.328 --> 00:01:35.656
So education right here, you have your
first list, you put in the middle or

23
00:01:35.656 --> 00:01:38.410
you can put it at the end, doesn't matter.

24
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.510
I always tell people, if you have
college and you have a CS degree,

25
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.355
put it immediately underneath
your introductory statement.

26
00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:52.221
It's going to help with the biases
that people have with you.

27
00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:56.690
It's gonna lower some of those
gates that are gonna be kept.

28
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.055
So yeah, if you have a technology degree,
put that right underneath your education

29
00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:03.896
or underneath your introductory statement,
right?

30
00:02:03.896 --> 00:02:06.694
So if you don't, put it at the end.

31
00:02:06.694 --> 00:02:09.950
But make sure that when you're
putting your stuff there,

32
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.413
you're putting things that are relevant.

33
00:02:12.413 --> 00:02:18.461
For instance, I don't put my degree
on my stuff at all because I am,

34
00:02:18.461 --> 00:02:20.383
it's not relevant.

35
00:02:20.383 --> 00:02:23.796
So my education, I don't even put that
on there because I have a bunch of other

36
00:02:23.796 --> 00:02:25.390
things now that I don't use.

37
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.869
But if I was looking at past me,
this is exactly how I would do it.

38
00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:36.592
I've put my education right here, so

39
00:02:36.592 --> 00:02:40.282
let me put general assembly,

40
00:02:40.282 --> 00:02:44.570
let's see, 2014, I think.

41
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.357
No, that was 2013.

42
00:02:52.317 --> 00:02:57.414
Web developer, Immersive,
and if I'm being honest,

43
00:02:57.414 --> 00:03:00.672
I think I learned Git in Bootstrap.

44
00:03:00.672 --> 00:03:05.233
That's only lessons that I remember
from there, but let's see,

45
00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:12.147
if I was here, Because it's less than
20 you got to use this part, right?

46
00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:20.692
12 week Immersive gotta write it out,

47
00:03:20.692 --> 00:03:23.853
where we focused on,

48
00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:34.701
Front end development,

49
00:03:34.701 --> 00:03:37.335
Rails work.

50
00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:39.256
Nope, not Rails work.

51
00:03:39.256 --> 00:03:43.995
Sorry, Ruby on Rails, Git,

52
00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:48.173
and what else would I say?

53
00:03:48.173 --> 00:03:54.845
Bootstrap since I remember
using the mouse and,

54
00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:04.126
Node, all right, so
this is what I would put right here.

55
00:04:04.126 --> 00:04:11.136
Now what I would do differently right
now is I'll put right here, boom.

56
00:04:11.136 --> 00:04:16.206
Cuz Git would come before say,

57
00:04:16.206 --> 00:04:20.892
same thing with Bootstrap.

58
00:04:20.892 --> 00:04:26.705
I like to put things in order, so
it makes sense when it has a nice flow,

59
00:04:31.407 --> 00:04:35.273
Because bootstrap is a part of frontend
development, so it's right there.

60
00:04:35.273 --> 00:04:39.010
Ruby on Rails and Node, so
I try to make things flow well.

61
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.369
Make sure there's no typos, I just double
apostrophe right here, or double comma.

62
00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:48.248
But in your current era,
you have to make sure your

63
00:04:48.248 --> 00:04:52.674
things that you also learned, soft skills.

64
00:04:58.683 --> 00:04:59.790
Working asynchronously.

65
00:05:05.151 --> 00:05:09.115
Working asynchronously and remotely.

66
00:05:13.667 --> 00:05:19.419
With teams and having deadlines,

67
00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:26.171
managing tickets, managing tickets.

68
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:31.059
And leading a team because
I ended up leading,

69
00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:38.300
being the person who got yelled at
all the time for for a project.

70
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.906
Yeah, so that's how I would put my,
from four score and

71
00:05:42.906 --> 00:05:48.309
seven years ago, ancient,
[LAUGH] stuff on here based upon that.

72
00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:54.889
If you are now modern, I would make sure,
especially if you were doing Teams,

73
00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.986
I would make sure learn about
how a GitFlow workflow method.

74
00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:06.680
Either research on your own, ask your
bootcamp instructor how to do that.

75
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.356
Or just just pull some guys off of Slack,
and be like, yo, can we practice this?

76
00:06:11.356 --> 00:06:16.246
So you'd be amazed how many people,
hey, yo, can we practice this together?

77
00:06:16.246 --> 00:06:17.122
Yeah, sure, why not?

78
00:06:17.122 --> 00:06:21.902
How to make a great user story and
tickets.

79
00:06:21.902 --> 00:06:24.339
Those are most of those important skills.

80
00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:27.953
I don't know what they teach in boot
camps yet, but I know we teach it.

81
00:06:27.953 --> 00:06:31.784
So definitely look that up as well,
how to make a user story.

82
00:06:31.784 --> 00:06:36.077
And be able to plan out a good
ticket because every company has

83
00:06:36.077 --> 00:06:39.541
a planning meeting now,
so definitely do that.

84
00:06:39.541 --> 00:06:43.754
There's not a lot of other
things I can think of.

85
00:06:43.754 --> 00:06:47.291
I'm pretty sure more will come to
me though as we keep this going.

86
00:06:47.291 --> 00:06:48.847
So yeah, so who has questions, let's go.

87
00:06:48.847 --> 00:06:54.919
&gt;&gt; In the chat somebody was asking that
they have an unrelated bachelor's degree,

88
00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:58.596
should they list that and
what would they write?

89
00:06:58.596 --> 00:07:05.230
&gt;&gt; In education, cool, right here,
I would just do it just like this.

90
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.969
I'll put underneath my relevant stuff.

91
00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:12.064
And I would just put how I would do for
myself,

92
00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:16.758
Florida State University, what was it,

93
00:07:16.758 --> 00:07:20.662
it four score and seven years now?

94
00:07:20.662 --> 00:07:22.539
2004, 2009, all right.

95
00:07:32.363 --> 00:07:37.476
And bachelor of science, yeah, bachelor's

96
00:07:37.476 --> 00:07:42.880
of science, criminal justice, there we go.

97
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.611
That's it, right?

98
00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:46.880
It doesn't matter because it's not going
to really help the education part.

99
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:52.465
It's where your experience is gonna
come forward in that stage, right?

100
00:07:52.465 --> 00:07:54.493
So if you list it, it's fine.

101
00:07:54.493 --> 00:07:58.583
I personally don't list it because
out of all the experience I had,

102
00:07:58.583 --> 00:08:02.625
I don't put any of this,
the education part on my resume any more.

103
00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:08.371
Because I have enough experience where I
went to school at, no one cares, right?

104
00:08:08.371 --> 00:08:13.059
It's not even like once,
your bootcamp is only relevant to

105
00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:17.389
your experience your first
year of trying to get a job.

106
00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:21.116
And then after that,
once you have a job for a year,

107
00:08:21.116 --> 00:08:25.551
all that's relevant is your
experience on the job, right?

108
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:29.490
Cuz that's how because tech moves so
fast, especially front end,

109
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.406
we're the most volatile
industry on the market.

110
00:08:32.406 --> 00:08:35.818
We move faster than the speed of light,
right?

111
00:08:35.818 --> 00:08:39.257
Every time you turn around,
there's a new framework,

112
00:08:39.257 --> 00:08:42.782
there's a new CSS thing,
TC39's adding something.

113
00:08:42.782 --> 00:08:46.851
You go to sleep at night and
you wake up in the morning,

114
00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:49.572
the whole world is on fire, right?

115
00:08:49.572 --> 00:08:54.985
So you have to think of it like that,
we are an ever-evolving craft.

116
00:08:54.985 --> 00:08:57.457
So you have to be ever-evolving with it.

117
00:08:57.457 --> 00:09:02.445
&gt;&gt; How do I approach showing I was
self taught through online courses and

118
00:09:02.445 --> 00:09:03.821
certifications?

119
00:09:03.821 --> 00:09:07.028
&gt;&gt; If it is a premium course
that comes with a certification,

120
00:09:07.028 --> 00:09:10.112
I know Wes Bos,
he has courses that all come with certs.

121
00:09:10.112 --> 00:09:14.937
I would actually put those on there
to show that you have the cert.

122
00:09:14.937 --> 00:09:20.207
Some of the things I went with,
I'd focus on premium stuff than not, like

123
00:09:20.207 --> 00:09:26.336
the FCC certs, I don't see how much value
they would have considering other access.

124
00:09:26.336 --> 00:09:29.755
But yeah,
Wes Bos's stuff I can see that as a,

125
00:09:29.755 --> 00:09:33.629
I think that's the only
person I know who does that.

126
00:09:33.629 --> 00:09:36.782
Or maybe Pluralsight I don't
know if I can say that on here.

127
00:09:36.782 --> 00:09:38.018
Can I say it on here?

128
00:09:38.018 --> 00:09:39.099
&gt;&gt; You can.

129
00:09:39.099 --> 00:09:40.491
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.

130
00:09:40.491 --> 00:09:45.342
[LAUGH] They have a crazy hard
test that you can go through that,

131
00:09:45.342 --> 00:09:48.886
if you pass you get
competent on any of those,

132
00:09:48.886 --> 00:09:52.637
it's like you know what, you deserve it.

133
00:09:52.637 --> 00:09:58.979
You can have that,
there's also let me, this right here,

134
00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:09.706
Test, there was a fun test that we took,

135
00:10:09.706 --> 00:10:12.740
and I can't find it now.

136
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.633
Is this it, is this the one,
the nightmare?

137
00:10:15.633 --> 00:10:22.438
That's okay, come on, what are you doing?

138
00:10:22.438 --> 00:10:26.472
I guess, darn it, his cert is gone, boo.

139
00:10:26.472 --> 00:10:30.006
Get your certs up people, but
yeah, so I'm gonna find it.

140
00:10:30.006 --> 00:10:34.699
There is a front end developer
test that my troops and I took,

141
00:10:34.699 --> 00:10:39.863
it has like a 55% success rate and
it's free, but it is so hard.

142
00:10:39.863 --> 00:10:46.058
And if you can pass that, I would
screenshot it and put it everywhere,

143
00:10:46.058 --> 00:10:51.841
it was, man, it was tough and
I think we had a few mentors pass it.

144
00:10:51.841 --> 00:10:54.271
Some of our alumni, but

145
00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:59.771
none of the phase one troops passed
it like, it was wow, it was painful.

146
00:10:59.771 --> 00:11:03.953
I was like man, this is hilarious, but
everybody was phase two, passed it.

147
00:11:03.953 --> 00:11:04.970
I'm gonna find it.

148
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.783
And I'll definitely be sharing that in my
docs with you guys and tweeting it out.

149
00:11:09.783 --> 00:11:15.281
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what about courses that
don't have completion certificates?

150
00:11:15.281 --> 00:11:20.574
&gt;&gt; The main purpose of courses
when it comes to an employer

151
00:11:20.574 --> 00:11:26.220
is it showcases that you can
complete something, right?

152
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:30.776
So if you go to Udemy and you don't have
a bunch of courses that you're doing or

153
00:11:30.776 --> 00:11:35.193
maybe the path, right, Frontend Masters,
that's a great one, right,

154
00:11:35.193 --> 00:11:36.965
where you complete the path.

155
00:11:36.965 --> 00:11:41.279
If you have a path completion or
you can screenshot that, I would do it.

156
00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:46.839
But Udemy, you can't really
do that because it's Udemy.

157
00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:50.703
So that's like how would I recommend it.

158
00:11:50.703 --> 00:11:54.978
If you complete all the paths that
Frontend has, Frontend Masters has,

159
00:11:54.978 --> 00:11:58.217
that's a great thing that
you can talk about, right?

160
00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:03.639
Because it showcases a path of completion,
but other organizations, if it doesn't

161
00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:09.079
have that, I wouldn't talk about it unless
it has a path of completion to it, right?

162
00:12:09.079 --> 00:12:13.010
All the metrics are met like,
FEM they have that,

163
00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:19.107
they have the free front end developer
handbook that I absolutely love them.

164
00:12:19.107 --> 00:12:23.157
I was waiting for 2020 to drop but
I guess outside closed and

165
00:12:23.157 --> 00:12:26.453
they forgot about us who loves the book,
#tears.

166
00:12:26.453 --> 00:12:30.626
I think they have a couple JavaScript
books, but their path system is what I

167
00:12:30.626 --> 00:12:35.530
really love, and I'd really recommend
that everybody go through the paths.

168
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.874
Make sure that you if
you're on your resume,

169
00:12:37.874 --> 00:12:41.151
make sure you're saying that
you've completed those paths.

170
00:12:41.151 --> 00:12:45.044
So that way they know that hey,
I have these core competencies skills.

171
00:12:45.044 --> 00:12:50.488
&gt;&gt; Should you tailor your resume
to a specific job posting?

172
00:12:50.488 --> 00:12:55.978
&gt;&gt; I don't, that's one of the things
that people do that I do not do.

173
00:12:55.978 --> 00:13:00.587
And it works amazing for me or
it's amazing for my troops.

174
00:13:00.587 --> 00:13:04.527
I am what I call
an offensive resume writer,

175
00:13:04.527 --> 00:13:08.373
I do not write resumes
to tailor to the job.

176
00:13:08.373 --> 00:13:12.004
I write my resume to showcase
all of my strengths.

177
00:13:12.004 --> 00:13:17.618
And then I look for
jobs that match my strengths, right?

178
00:13:17.618 --> 00:13:21.014
You have to be counter, because guess
what, all the time that you're spending

179
00:13:21.014 --> 00:13:24.562
editing your resume doing this little
bit here, that little bit there.

180
00:13:24.562 --> 00:13:28.302
You could be building something
that would catch somebody's eye,

181
00:13:28.302 --> 00:13:31.065
that would make them hire you on the spot,
right?

182
00:13:31.065 --> 00:13:33.760
Or hire you for
a tool that they you've never used.

183
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.602
My first one, I like React, right?

184
00:13:37.602 --> 00:13:43.212
I was so busy doing things in React and
Gatsby and focused on having one resume,

185
00:13:43.212 --> 00:13:47.978
that I was hired initially for
CBS to do an app that was using Ember.

186
00:13:47.978 --> 00:13:52.271
Never used Ember, absolutely loathe Ember,
it's not my thing, not my jam.

187
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:56.946
But guess what, because of the things I
was doing, they didn't care because they

188
00:13:56.946 --> 00:14:00.890
knew that I was working hard enough
to learn this type of stuff.

189
00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:04.670
Same thing with Angular,
things of that nature.

190
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.736
I might say I love React,
I don't write a lot of Angular.

191
00:14:08.736 --> 00:14:11.067
But because of what I do and
how I've been like,

192
00:14:11.067 --> 00:14:13.760
because I've been focusing
on building things.

193
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.110
They're like you know what,
we know that you can do this stuff.

194
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:20.200
So they are banking on that potential
because you have that desire, or

195
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.420
you you showcased that diligence, right?

196
00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:28.198
So I personally,
I write my resume really well

197
00:14:28.198 --> 00:14:32.248
once that showcases all my strengths.

198
00:14:32.248 --> 00:14:37.111
And then I focus on finding
the job that matches my strengths

199
00:14:37.111 --> 00:14:41.497
versus trying to rewrite it
to hopefully get past HR.

200
00:14:41.497 --> 00:14:45.282
I think that's a thing that a lot of
entry level developers don't get.

201
00:14:45.282 --> 00:14:48.748
You're gonna be part of a team,
you're gonna be part of a unit,

202
00:14:48.748 --> 00:14:53.522
what they're looking for from your resume,
is they're looking for core competency.

203
00:14:53.522 --> 00:14:59.624
They're looking for self starting, they're
looking for teamwork and collaboration.

204
00:14:59.624 --> 00:15:03.038
And most importantly,
they're looking for potential.

205
00:15:03.038 --> 00:15:07.170
Every company is looking for potential
whether they're looking to fill that other

206
00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.080
20% of the gap of your education or
that 50% of the gap of your education.

207
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.224
In the end, they're looking for potential.

208
00:15:13.224 --> 00:15:17.711
So if you showcase the potential and
along with the core competencies,

209
00:15:17.711 --> 00:15:19.519
you're gonna do all right.

210
00:15:23.456 --> 00:15:24.949
Do you have anything else, Yusef?

211
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:26.596
I know I kind of cut you off on that.

212
00:15:26.596 --> 00:15:30.845
&gt;&gt; If an online course comes with
a certification or nano degree,

213
00:15:30.845 --> 00:15:33.016
should I post that on my resume?

214
00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:36.800
&gt;&gt; All right, well,
if it comes with a cert, then, yeah, sure.

215
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:43.169
If it has a cert, you can talk about it,
I don't know how much weight those hold.

216
00:15:43.169 --> 00:15:48.923
I think what you build holds a lot more
weight than what you are certified in.

217
00:15:48.923 --> 00:15:53.306
I have zero certs in technology,
I have never had a cert.

218
00:15:53.306 --> 00:15:58.535
So the whole I think that comes from
the whole AWS and .NET world or the older

219
00:15:58.535 --> 00:16:04.190
Microsoft stuff, where they used to have
certifications and things like that.

220
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.703
They look more for you being able
to talk about it competently and

221
00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:16.058
build things with it and showcasing what
you can do more so than a certification.

222
00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:19.704
&gt;&gt; I heard Udacity has portfolio projects.

223
00:16:19.704 --> 00:16:25.293
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and we're gonna get into
that because when it comes to portfolios,

224
00:16:25.293 --> 00:16:29.513
I have a different way of doing
that as well that really works.

225
00:16:29.513 --> 00:16:31.880
And we're going to talk
more about that as well.

226
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.192
&gt;&gt; I'm having a bit of a challenge
rectifying the fact that you're

227
00:16:35.192 --> 00:16:37.952
telling people to do courses
with certificates, but

228
00:16:37.952 --> 00:16:40.551
you said you don't have
certificates yourself.

229
00:16:40.551 --> 00:16:42.555
So I'm trying to figure that out.

230
00:16:42.555 --> 00:16:46.182
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I'm saying, do courses to have certs,

231
00:16:46.182 --> 00:16:49.848
if you're going to be
putting them on your resume.

232
00:16:49.848 --> 00:16:54.795
You don't need the certs on your
resume but if they're asking,

233
00:16:54.795 --> 00:16:58.193
I'm not saying do courses that have certs.

234
00:16:58.193 --> 00:17:03.005
I'm saying, if you're going to put them on
your resume only focus on the ones that

235
00:17:03.005 --> 00:17:07.400
have like a path or course completion,
like the Frontend Master paths, or

236
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.736
a certification of some sort, right?

237
00:17:09.736 --> 00:17:14.373
So if it's a premium course yes,
if you complete it and you had to pay,

238
00:17:14.373 --> 00:17:18.550
a bunch of stuff, money for it,
yes, put that on your resume.

239
00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:22.346
But for the most part,
looking for experience or

240
00:17:22.346 --> 00:17:28.373
looking at your education it really only
comes down to boot camps or college.

241
00:17:28.373 --> 00:17:31.905
Even here if you're self taught,
just omit the whole section.
