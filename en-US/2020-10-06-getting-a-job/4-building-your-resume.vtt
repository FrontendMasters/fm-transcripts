1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.997
We are on the phase everybody's been
talking about, everybody's excited about.

2
00:00:03.997 --> 00:00:06.990
Let's build that resume.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.477
First thing I'm gonna
give you guys is from me,

4
00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:14.936
from my experience,
from dealing with over 250 people.

5
00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:19.498
The number one thing that you should
be focusing on that no developer

6
00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:23.192
focuses on is their copy and
their writing abilities.

7
00:00:23.192 --> 00:00:26.651
In the end, no matter what you say,
no matter what you do,

8
00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:30.261
your writing abilities are still
going to be put to the test.

9
00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:34.870
Because you're doing confluence, you're
doing JIRA tickets, you're doing repose.

10
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.550
You have to focus on being a good writer.

11
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.030
So this is something that's
really helped me in my career.

12
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.410
I have it, I read it,
I go through I went through this workbook.

13
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.261
I say this workbook,
I bought a new copy just for

14
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:48.553
this because my old copy is tattered.

15
00:00:48.553 --> 00:00:54.352
I got this and there's a book that
they had me and another workbook

16
00:00:54.352 --> 00:00:59.949
that has a spot Coding not is a pain and
quill from the Air Force.

17
00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.503
I can put on you guys enough
to become like really strong

18
00:01:04.503 --> 00:01:06.887
writers elements of style.

19
00:01:06.887 --> 00:01:12.841
It's the one thing this workbook I
recommend to everybody in this industry,

20
00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:13.948
regardless.

21
00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:17.797
Because knowing how to
write code is great.

22
00:01:17.797 --> 00:01:22.565
Knowing how to write about code,
even better, right?

23
00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:24.572
Being able to get your ideas clear and

24
00:01:24.572 --> 00:01:29.103
concise in a manner that the HR person can
understand, your non-technical team or

25
00:01:29.103 --> 00:01:33.785
the DevOps guys can understand, you can
understand, make it easier for everybody.

26
00:01:33.785 --> 00:01:36.574
You can't beat that.

27
00:01:36.574 --> 00:01:43.016
So please get this book,
it is a great investment on your career.

28
00:01:43.016 --> 00:01:48.549
So introductory pitch, to me, this is
the most important part of your resume,

29
00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.689
better yet on everything that
you're going to be writing.

30
00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.433
From your LinkedIn to your Twitter,
to your resume, to your website,

31
00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:00.771
this is the most important
copy that you can have.

32
00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:06.217
It's a place where you put all your
keywords and your skills in and

33
00:02:06.217 --> 00:02:12.767
you make it flow really, really well,
so that it gives that total idea of you.

34
00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:16.424
You also amend it or
get rid of it, minimize or

35
00:02:16.424 --> 00:02:20.480
maximize, depending on your audience,
right?

36
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.663
So if you're on Twitter, where you're
allowed to have a little bit of humor,

37
00:02:22.663 --> 00:02:23.640
you can add humor into it.

38
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.413
If you're not on Twitter, I mean,
if you're on LinkedIn and

39
00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:31.271
it just needs to be professional,
you can take away the humor.

40
00:02:31.271 --> 00:02:34.557
Your website, you can add a little
get humor, change words with emojis,

41
00:02:34.557 --> 00:02:35.406
things like that.

42
00:02:35.406 --> 00:02:37.810
This gives you an idea how you're
gonna build the rest of your things.

43
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.923
I recommend people building their writing
or copy, write an introductory statement

44
00:02:41.923 --> 00:02:44.675
before they even think about
whether you want a website.

45
00:02:44.675 --> 00:02:46.086
Because when they're
talking about themselves,

46
00:02:46.086 --> 00:02:47.240
they learned talking about themselves.

47
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.310
They can help mold how their portfolio or
website should go and

48
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.535
look like, right, from their resume, from
what projects they're gonna focus on and

49
00:02:57.535 --> 00:02:59.615
build anything, right?

50
00:02:59.615 --> 00:03:03.493
So once you learn these skills,
you write about the things about you and

51
00:03:03.493 --> 00:03:07.066
then you pull your projects out
of your introductory statement.

52
00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:13.868
That is an exercise that I do with
my veterans all the time, right?

53
00:03:13.868 --> 00:03:17.522
And also this third one,
it focuses on disinterest.

54
00:03:17.522 --> 00:03:24.403
This introductory statement
focuses on diligence over passion.

55
00:03:24.403 --> 00:03:27.156
You hear in tech community all the time,
I wanna see if you're passionate,

56
00:03:27.156 --> 00:03:28.455
I wanna see if you're passionate.

57
00:03:28.455 --> 00:03:30.915
No, you only passion,
passion is an emotion.

58
00:03:30.915 --> 00:03:34.058
What you need to showcase is diligence.

59
00:03:34.058 --> 00:03:38.153
You need to showcase
the systems that you use,

60
00:03:38.153 --> 00:03:43.403
the projects that you use to
continue bettering yourself.

61
00:03:43.403 --> 00:03:46.957
Even when you don't have the motivation,
even when you don't want to, right?

62
00:03:46.957 --> 00:03:52.552
Especially, it's a crazy time right now
out here, you may not be motivated.

63
00:03:52.552 --> 00:03:54.304
You're stuck in the house,

64
00:03:54.304 --> 00:03:57.737
it feels like the world is
ending every other day [LAUGH].

65
00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:02.500
You're like, 2020 can't get anywhere
else and it's like [LAUGH].

66
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.598
You need to show those things that will
motivate you beyond another bad day or

67
00:04:08.598 --> 00:04:12.710
the one bad day as
the Joker said with Batman.

68
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.687
Let's go into that, right?

69
00:04:15.687 --> 00:04:17.396
I actually have mine staying up here.

70
00:04:17.396 --> 00:04:20.385
I put it on my whiteboard all the time.

71
00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:23.798
But because I'm doing this,
I'm going to do it live with you guys.

72
00:04:23.798 --> 00:04:25.727
So I pulled up a template, right?

73
00:04:25.727 --> 00:04:26.743
It says profile.

74
00:04:26.743 --> 00:04:28.746
This is where my introductory
statement is gonna be.

75
00:04:28.746 --> 00:04:31.176
So let's talk about some things about me,
right?

76
00:04:31.176 --> 00:04:35.124
I'm a JavaScript developer.

77
00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.271
Let's see, all the things I said,
we need to focus on,

78
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:45.027
when you focus on frontend systems.

79
00:04:47.721 --> 00:04:50.187
Frontend framework like React,
that's what I work on, right?

80
00:04:50.187 --> 00:04:55.316
I do frontend, I am React.

81
00:05:00.626 --> 00:05:06.340
Plus Angular.
I need to also I love design systems,

82
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.822
I love design systems, all right,

83
00:05:11.822 --> 00:05:19.175
so web, Accesability, what's the biggest?

84
00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:23.423
Yeah, okay so biggest project I'm working
on right now is the vets who code website.

85
00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:28.378
Or not what my motivation projects, vets
who code website which is all JAM stack.

86
00:05:28.378 --> 00:05:30.842
So it helps me now that I
remember that's JAM stack.

87
00:05:30.842 --> 00:05:35.938
That's all serverless,
I can go up here, and

88
00:05:35.938 --> 00:05:40.783
I can do serverless technologies, right?

89
00:05:40.783 --> 00:05:44.901
Or I can deep dive and talk about that.

90
00:05:44.901 --> 00:05:47.864
Things have asked them questions, right?

91
00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:55.721
Vets who code is my passion project.

92
00:05:55.721 --> 00:06:02.118
I love bacon and Captain America
every day, all day, all right?

93
00:06:02.118 --> 00:06:05.087
All right, so what am I gonna say?

94
00:06:08.564 --> 00:06:10.077
Make sure to stays plugged up.

95
00:06:10.077 --> 00:06:11.303
There we go.

96
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:20.384
So now right here,
I'm a JavaScript developer.

97
00:06:25.047 --> 00:06:27.188
That focuses typo, see?

98
00:06:37.504 --> 00:06:41.659
Which is React and Angular.

99
00:06:46.137 --> 00:06:51.003
All right, have a passion for

100
00:06:51.003 --> 00:06:53.927
design systems.

101
00:06:58.552 --> 00:07:02.958
Web, Accesability and,

102
00:07:05.581 --> 00:07:11.196
Serverless, Technologies.

103
00:07:13.422 --> 00:07:16.674
So now I got all those
three in right there, boom.

104
00:07:19.373 --> 00:07:25.941
To keep, not to keep,
what's best way to say this?

105
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.854
To grow my skills.

106
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:41.986
Focus on building a JAM.

107
00:07:41.986 --> 00:07:46.497
Especially like someone that
has no idea what JAM stack is.

108
00:07:46.497 --> 00:07:47.208
What's JAM stack?

109
00:07:47.208 --> 00:07:49.286
And then you can have other conversation,
right?

110
00:07:49.286 --> 00:07:50.572
So JAM stack.

111
00:07:53.008 --> 00:07:57.831
Application for a non-profit,
that's the only time I will

112
00:07:57.831 --> 00:08:02.286
use the acronym in this when
I'm talking about a stack.

113
00:08:02.286 --> 00:08:06.571
But I wouldn't say like NPO or

114
00:08:06.571 --> 00:08:11.034
JS developer, or Angular JS.

115
00:08:11.034 --> 00:08:16.041
Any of that stuff, keep the acronyms out
of your introductory statement, all right?

116
00:08:16.041 --> 00:08:18.399
It's a pitch, right?

117
00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:19.736
It's like an elevator
pitch of an elevator.

118
00:08:19.736 --> 00:08:23.452
You wanna be able to say this as fast
as you can, or just like that, right?

119
00:08:23.452 --> 00:08:27.415
You got 30 minutes or 30 seconds,
wherever, you can say all this to so on.

120
00:08:34.109 --> 00:08:39.340
Vets who code, and yeah,
well, there we go.

121
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.456
Get those two out of the way.

122
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.737
All right, so
that's my introductory statement.

123
00:08:59.737 --> 00:09:02.008
Now, here's I'm looking at this,
all right?

124
00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:05.675
I'm JavaScript developer, focuses on
frontend frameworks such as React and

125
00:09:05.675 --> 00:09:06.180
Angular.

126
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.483
Have passion for design systems,
websites building, and service technology.

127
00:09:09.483 --> 00:09:13.940
Let me capitalize those
because those are now, so

128
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.940
just don't worry I'm throwing out there,
all right?

129
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:23.159
To grow my skills I focus on
building a JAM stack application for

130
00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:25.559
non-profit called Vets who code.

131
00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:28.639
Basically letting them know that, hey,

132
00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:33.923
I have a project that I focus on to
ensure that I am constantly evolving.

133
00:09:33.923 --> 00:09:35.250
This is where I get my diligence.

134
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:41.062
When I'm not feeling motivated, this is
where I go to continue to grow, right?

135
00:09:41.062 --> 00:09:42.002
This is what I do.

136
00:09:42.002 --> 00:09:44.350
My vices are bacon and Captain America.

137
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:48.760
They don't need to know that on this part,
so I'm gonna go ahead and delete that for

138
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.459
the resume.

139
00:09:49.459 --> 00:09:53.757
So that's what I'm gonna put for
my introductory statement on the resume.

140
00:09:53.757 --> 00:10:00.472
Just to let them know that I do
JavaScript, it's gonna pick that up.

141
00:10:00.472 --> 00:10:04.085
Say frontend frameworks such as React and
Angular, I need to capitalize those.

142
00:10:04.085 --> 00:10:09.225
The bot is gonn pick React and Angular up.

143
00:10:09.225 --> 00:10:13.275
Design systems, web accesability,
service technologies, that's for

144
00:10:13.275 --> 00:10:16.563
the HR rep because they're gonna
be looking for that stuff.

145
00:10:16.563 --> 00:10:23.031
I could right here put such as AWS and
Google Cloud,

146
00:10:23.031 --> 00:10:27.550
bot's gonna pick that up, right?

147
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:32.932
Think about all these little
keywords that C3PO bot that

148
00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:39.160
the HR tech uses to give me
a green light or red light, right?

149
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.970
So that's what we're focusing on.

150
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:45.140
So to grow my skills,
I'm focusing on building a JAM stack.

151
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:51.623
Now, let's say I know it, but
still I just wanna make sure, see?

152
00:10:51.623 --> 00:10:54.528
So I'm gonna use that, so JavaScript APIs,

153
00:11:02.349 --> 00:11:03.105
Markup.

154
00:11:12.434 --> 00:11:15.719
Markup, right?

155
00:11:15.719 --> 00:11:19.880
So now I'm saying JavaScript twice in just
my introductory statement, all right?

156
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:25.112
So that just as, snap, now it says,

157
00:11:25.112 --> 00:11:29.640
well, I'm a JavaScript developer twice.

158
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.944
I focus on frontend frameworks.

159
00:11:31.944 --> 00:11:34.249
I got React and Angular,
the things I want to work in.

160
00:11:34.249 --> 00:11:36.858
Always make sure you put
the things you want to work in,

161
00:11:36.858 --> 00:11:38.855
the things you want to get paid for doing.

162
00:11:38.855 --> 00:11:42.873
3 AM rule is paramount here,
because if you put some stuff in here,

163
00:11:42.873 --> 00:11:47.806
you don't wanna be doing but you know,
trust me and believe me, you'll be getting

164
00:11:47.806 --> 00:11:51.983
hit on interviews for people who will
be hitting you up for that stuff.

165
00:11:51.983 --> 00:11:58.098
I put on when I was a Rails dev for
your score in seven years ago,

166
00:11:58.098 --> 00:12:03.863
well, forever ago,
I still get emails about some resumes

167
00:12:03.863 --> 00:12:09.176
out there floating around
about me being a Rails dev.

168
00:12:09.176 --> 00:12:11.689
And I haven't touched Rails
in legit three years.

169
00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:15.515
So just know if you put it on there and
you start getting experience,

170
00:12:15.515 --> 00:12:20.029
people will start hitting you up for
stuff, even stuff you don't wanna learn.

171
00:12:20.029 --> 00:12:26.027
So I should probably change my thing.

172
00:12:26.027 --> 00:12:27.738
I'm getting notifications
like Carol Baskin.

173
00:12:27.738 --> 00:12:33.740
I'm sorry y'all, [LAUGH] I'm a Tiger King
fan, don't hate on me, don't judge me.

174
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:37.960
So that goes into that.

175
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:43.300
Now, how does what I just wrote apply to,
say, LinkedIn, all right?

176
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.749
So here it is, LinkedIn.

177
00:12:44.749 --> 00:12:50.814
I have a million messages
as everybody else does.

178
00:12:50.814 --> 00:12:53.939
This is where I have so much stuff.

179
00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:56.183
I'm right here,
I'm a JavaScript engineer and

180
00:12:56.183 --> 00:13:00.455
developer advocate that focuses on React,
Angular, design systems, web accesability,

181
00:13:00.455 --> 00:13:03.670
and server technologies, and
Agile, and compound settings.

182
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.620
I made sure that they knew that stuff.

183
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.332
I highly recommend you look up Agile or
Kanban.

184
00:13:09.332 --> 00:13:11.107
You went to a code boot camp.

185
00:13:11.107 --> 00:13:16.779
You probably worked in Agile a little
bit or Kanban maybe as well.

186
00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:22.480
But I know at VWC we focus on everybody
knowing and working in Kanban.

187
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.319
And my passion project is
building an operating,

188
00:13:25.319 --> 00:13:28.165
a JAM stack web application
called Vets who code.

189
00:13:28.165 --> 00:13:32.175
Well educated fellow veterans in frontend
development to follow my footsteps and

190
00:13:32.175 --> 00:13:34.625
attain lucrative jobs in
the technology sector.

191
00:13:34.625 --> 00:13:40.651
So I'm always letting them know that hey,
I'm doing stuff, right?

192
00:13:40.651 --> 00:13:42.714
I'm always focusing on doing things.

193
00:13:42.714 --> 00:13:44.899
Now let's say I go to Twitter, right?

194
00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:45.828
Here it is.

195
00:13:45.828 --> 00:13:47.830
I'm a JavaScript engineer and

196
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.835
developer advocate at the Java
net currently Quicken Loans.

197
00:13:51.835 --> 00:13:53.278
Educate vets in frontend at Vets who code.

198
00:13:53.278 --> 00:13:56.136
I love reading, bacon, and
all things America, Captain America.

199
00:13:56.136 --> 00:14:00.921
I just chopped that up and been like,
hey, here's the stuff that I do.

200
00:14:00.921 --> 00:14:02.988
This is what I'm having fun for.

201
00:14:02.988 --> 00:14:05.923
This is me, and of course,

202
00:14:05.923 --> 00:14:11.030
one of the pictures I
shared in last 24 hours is

203
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:16.026
a Captain America gif because me,
all right?

204
00:14:16.026 --> 00:14:20.647
So [LAUGH] I'm on brand
if there's anything else.
