1
00:00:00.282 --> 00:00:01.462
Let's start with the resume stuff, right?

2
00:00:01.462 --> 00:00:04.781
Let's get back to,
starting back from the beginning.

3
00:00:04.781 --> 00:00:11.404
I want you guys to take ten minutes, and
come up with a strong Introductory Pitch.

4
00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:20.256
So let's go with some of these pitches,
I really liked Laura's.

5
00:00:20.256 --> 00:00:22.001
I saw, is that Laura?

6
00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:28.315
Yes, creative and
client-focus full stack developer.

7
00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:33.418
I really don't like the from
what I've seen with

8
00:00:33.418 --> 00:00:38.653
HR is that they have
a negative connotation to it.

9
00:00:38.653 --> 00:00:40.543
So I always just change
it to web developer.

10
00:00:40.543 --> 00:00:44.802
So that's what you're working on,
web developer as a full stack

11
00:00:44.802 --> 00:00:48.917
developer using JavaScript,
jQuery, React, PostgreSQL.

12
00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:53.021
And express to solve problems
independently and collaboratively.

13
00:00:53.021 --> 00:00:57.648
Established professional with
a proven record of managing people,

14
00:00:57.648 --> 00:00:59.728
processes, and technology.

15
00:00:59.728 --> 00:01:02.843
For the most part that's really strong,

16
00:01:02.843 --> 00:01:07.827
it shows that you said you're creative,
you focus on the client,

17
00:01:07.827 --> 00:01:12.457
you say the technologies that
they're gonna be looking for.

18
00:01:12.457 --> 00:01:18.276
And they're, the robots, gonna be
looking for, so you did that good.

19
00:01:18.276 --> 00:01:21.750
Solve problems independently and
collaboratively.

20
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.559
So you're showcasing that you have that
experience to be able to work by yourself

21
00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:27.418
for any team.

22
00:01:27.418 --> 00:01:32.170
And you say you have established yourself
professional with a proven record of

23
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.196
managing people,
processes, and technology.

24
00:01:35.196 --> 00:01:39.359
I like that, I feel like it's
a little too formal at parse, but

25
00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:41.023
it still works, right?

26
00:01:41.023 --> 00:01:46.275
Beyond the full stack developer and
turn it into web developer and

27
00:01:46.275 --> 00:01:51.338
that's the only thing that I
think really needs to be changed,

28
00:01:51.338 --> 00:01:53.739
but other than that it works.

29
00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:59.466
George, I am a web and mobile
developer who works mostly with React,

30
00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:04.229
Native React, and Spelt,
always learning new things.

31
00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.005
I think you wanna say I'm always learning
new things, I've been coding for

32
00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:08.891
over 25 years.

33
00:02:08.891 --> 00:02:13.855
In that time I had the opportunity
to experience multiple technologies,

34
00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:18.099
starting my career,
developing configuring applications,

35
00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.189
and old school Unix machines.

36
00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.246
I would keep the amount
of years out of it.

37
00:02:22.246 --> 00:02:25.745
You don't want to carbon date yourself or
anything.

38
00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:30.636
They need to let them find out how many
years you've been in this game, right?

39
00:02:30.636 --> 00:02:35.691
Also was very active in
the early days of PHP,

40
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:39.284
once again your carbon dating,

41
00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:43.820
PHP, Linux, MySQL, and open source.

42
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.904
Presently enjoy working on
mobile front-end and serverless.

43
00:02:46.904 --> 00:02:49.093
So with this I will be like,

44
00:02:49.093 --> 00:02:54.814
I'm with a mobile developer who
works mostly in React, Native React.

45
00:02:54.814 --> 00:02:59.228
And so, while always learning new things,

46
00:02:59.228 --> 00:03:04.475
I focus most of my time being
active in a PHP, Linux,

47
00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:11.779
MySQL, open source, and a bunch of
other things over my tenure in tech.

48
00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:17.459
I presently enjoy working with mobile
front-end and serverless technologies.

49
00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.169
All right, so I was shoring that up.

50
00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:23.241
I wouldn't date myself so
much cuz you said there are biases,

51
00:03:23.241 --> 00:03:25.684
we have to think about that, right?

52
00:03:25.684 --> 00:03:30.682
We have to give them everything they
need to not ask us questions, but

53
00:03:30.682 --> 00:03:32.416
take everything away.

54
00:03:32.416 --> 00:03:38.298
They can give them ideas of what we might
like, not give them red flags, right?

55
00:03:38.298 --> 00:03:40.955
Because you have to think of
it from a hiring standpoint.

56
00:03:40.955 --> 00:03:45.498
The first year of being on
a team is an investment of you.

57
00:03:45.498 --> 00:03:49.548
They don't really get anything
financially from you in your first year,

58
00:03:49.548 --> 00:03:53.488
is that second year, they're trying
to get that investment, right?

59
00:03:53.488 --> 00:03:58.176
And if the average developer moves two
to three years to try to make sure

60
00:03:58.176 --> 00:04:02.784
that they get at least two years of
experience of investment out of you

61
00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:05.985
before you start looking
at other places to go.

62
00:04:05.985 --> 00:04:10.483
One and two, they also wanna
make sure that you can stay in

63
00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:13.406
the workforce long enough, right?

64
00:04:13.406 --> 00:04:17.762
So when you're saying that they're
even though you might be cuz I'm from

65
00:04:17.762 --> 00:04:18.682
the military.

66
00:04:18.682 --> 00:04:22.536
So guys have 20 years of
experience in the military and

67
00:04:22.536 --> 00:04:26.309
they're like, I'm retired and
they're like 31.

68
00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:31.369
So, I come from a world of young retirees,
so I totally get it.

69
00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:35.031
I just wanna like that is a thing
that they may use against you.

70
00:04:37.848 --> 00:04:41.899
As you, Matt,
I use front-end technologies and I for

71
00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:46.756
design to make accessible websites for
all people or any device.

72
00:04:46.756 --> 00:04:53.955
My specialties include React, Node, CSS,
Vanilla JavaScript in area, all right?

73
00:04:53.955 --> 00:04:57.154
So instead of area to
just put accessibility,

74
00:04:57.154 --> 00:04:59.129
how to put the .js on there.

75
00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:06.413
You'll just node and JavaScript,
you don't need to put Vanilla JavaScript.

76
00:05:06.413 --> 00:05:09.666
A HR person isn't gonna know what that is,
so you just say at JavaScript,

77
00:05:09.666 --> 00:05:11.565
that's the word they're gonna look for.

78
00:05:11.565 --> 00:05:13.718
Vanilla JavaScript doesn't matter.

79
00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:22.190
When you say an I for
design, I make accessible

80
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.709
websites using front-end technologies and

81
00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:32.222
with experience of product design.

82
00:05:32.222 --> 00:05:37.167
I think that sentence goes better because
instead of you say I use front-end

83
00:05:37.167 --> 00:05:42.663
technologies, you're saying I make
websites with the front-end technologies.

84
00:05:42.663 --> 00:05:45.719
Instead of saying I use
front-end technologies,

85
00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:48.213
now you make websites using now, right?

86
00:05:48.213 --> 00:05:52.465
So I make accessible websites
using front-end technologies

87
00:05:52.465 --> 00:05:54.678
with a focus on product design.

88
00:05:54.678 --> 00:06:00.416
And you say the accessibility part as
well, so let's do that sentence again.

89
00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:05.505
I focus on making
accessible websites using

90
00:06:05.505 --> 00:06:12.939
front-end technologies with
a with a focus on product design.

91
00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:17.544
And you have to use on any device,
is 2020 they know you should be doing

92
00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:20.535
everything is mobile first and
expanding out.

93
00:06:20.535 --> 00:06:23.176
So if you aren't, it'd be a problem.

94
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.259
Nadia, all right, I'm a mess,

95
00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:34.740
I'm a front-end developer
with a master's degree in IT.

96
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.103
I love building websites and bring ideas
to life by making responsive web design

97
00:06:39.103 --> 00:06:42.829
and modern CSS using the latest
in different technologies, okay?

98
00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:47.496
So here is a little two is small and
broad, here's another,

99
00:06:47.496 --> 00:06:51.993
I mean, you're a front-end developer,
that's good.

100
00:06:51.993 --> 00:06:55.934
But you're not talking about any of
the technologies you use on the front-end.

101
00:06:55.934 --> 00:06:59.984
You say web design and modern CSS,
but you're not saying anything

102
00:06:59.984 --> 00:07:04.041
about JavaScript, React tone has
very little that you have to do.

103
00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:07.440
Beyond that you have a master's degree,
and you're a front-end developer.

104
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.821
So right there you go,

105
00:07:08.821 --> 00:07:13.264
I'm a front-end developer with
a focus on these type of technologies.

106
00:07:13.264 --> 00:07:17.283
And then you can get into
your master's degree and

107
00:07:17.283 --> 00:07:23.703
talk about how you love doing websites and
bringing things to life, all right?

108
00:07:23.703 --> 00:07:25.681
So that's the only feedback I have for
you.

109
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.777
This is a good one, Alicia,
you rocked it, I love it.

110
00:07:34.777 --> 00:07:39.904
Alicia as a front-end developer,
I focus on HTML, CSS, and

111
00:07:39.904 --> 00:07:44.945
JavaScript as this specifically
applies to the UI, you go.

112
00:07:44.945 --> 00:07:49.848
I am a motivated individual who seeks
to utilize my creative abilities and

113
00:07:49.848 --> 00:07:51.911
grow as a person and employee.

114
00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:55.803
I love generating new ideas and
seeing them through to completion.

115
00:07:55.803 --> 00:07:58.785
My greatest assets are organization,
communication, and

116
00:07:58.785 --> 00:08:00.310
the ability to learn quickly.

117
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.002
The majority of my development projects
I utilize Vanilla JavaScript and Sass.

118
00:08:04.002 --> 00:08:08.563
But I have professional experience in
a number of js libraries such as React,

119
00:08:08.563 --> 00:08:09.695
View, and Marco.

120
00:08:09.695 --> 00:08:13.904
I think of those, React as the only
library, View as a framework.

121
00:08:13.904 --> 00:08:16.478
So you also like that's a got you,
remember,

122
00:08:16.478 --> 00:08:19.126
React is a library it's
not a framework at all.

123
00:08:19.126 --> 00:08:23.266
We didn't put it in the framework
cuz it's how people treat it, but

124
00:08:23.266 --> 00:08:25.965
it handles one thing,
which is just the UI.

125
00:08:25.965 --> 00:08:30.159
Angular is a framework cuz it
does in the whatever, right?

126
00:08:30.159 --> 00:08:34.330
So other than that is good,
you know how to say Vanilla JavaScript.

127
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.522
It's like, just a JavaScript, we all
know we say JavaScript, what that means.

128
00:08:38.522 --> 00:08:41.775
Everybody knows and the person who
doesn't know, doesn't care, right?

129
00:08:41.775 --> 00:08:47.664
So they're just looking for that
keyword other than that you rocked it.

130
00:08:50.798 --> 00:08:54.782
Let me see, Alan.

131
00:08:57.684 --> 00:09:02.216
I'm a highly motivated JavaScript
developer with a focus on front-end and

132
00:09:02.216 --> 00:09:05.419
full stack frameworks as React,
Gatsby, Index js.

133
00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:08.635
Is next, yeah,
next is full stack, I guess.

134
00:09:08.635 --> 00:09:12.856
I am passionate about providing and
engaging in mobile user experience,

135
00:09:12.856 --> 00:09:14.830
whether it be on a phone, tablet,

136
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:19.000
computer, or any other device,
just a responsive design right there.

137
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.653
First foremost, like I said,
if you're a developer in this era,

138
00:09:22.653 --> 00:09:25.408
they know that you're
doing responsive design.

139
00:09:25.408 --> 00:09:27.955
If you're not doing responsive design,

140
00:09:27.955 --> 00:09:32.986
is a problem because everyone's doing
a response design as the industry trends.

141
00:09:32.986 --> 00:09:34.832
So you don't have to say that, right?

142
00:09:34.832 --> 00:09:36.638
Continue my education and

143
00:09:36.638 --> 00:09:41.896
staying current with the latest technology
trends is very important to me.

144
00:09:41.896 --> 00:09:47.335
I would learn new and improved ways,
code cleanly and efficiently.

145
00:09:47.335 --> 00:09:52.672
Let's see, I like the idea of
the highly motivated, to say,

146
00:09:52.672 --> 00:09:57.701
I am a JavaScript developer,
they focus on front-end and

147
00:09:57.701 --> 00:10:02.131
full stack frameworks is
just React gasping in js.

148
00:10:02.131 --> 00:10:08.736
I like the, I'm passionate about providing
an engaging and memorable user experience.

149
00:10:08.736 --> 00:10:13.037
If we did stop know, erase that stuff,
which is, throw that out.

150
00:10:17.661 --> 00:10:20.751
To say my primary focus is
continuing my education,

151
00:10:20.751 --> 00:10:25.047
staying current with the latest
technology trends versus continuing.

152
00:10:25.047 --> 00:10:27.041
Yeah, I think that sounds
a little bit better.

153
00:10:27.041 --> 00:10:31.146
But that is opinionated, so
you can keep as that is or a new kit,

154
00:10:31.146 --> 00:10:32.936
whichever way you want to.

155
00:10:32.936 --> 00:10:37.024
I'm love new and improved ways
to code cleanly and efficiently.

156
00:10:37.024 --> 00:10:40.751
Just say, I love to learn new ways to or

157
00:10:40.751 --> 00:10:46.588
it's just I love to improve
on my craft regularly, right?

158
00:10:46.588 --> 00:10:50.545
As a way to, you tie all that together and
you make it concise, right?

159
00:10:50.545 --> 00:10:54.104
So that was pretty good,
I definitely liked it.

160
00:10:54.104 --> 00:10:56.980
There are some things that
everybody kind of get,

161
00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.686
like there was a lot of things
talking about responsive design.

162
00:11:00.686 --> 00:11:05.283
Remember, as an industry trend,
everybody's doing responsive design.

163
00:11:05.283 --> 00:11:08.645
You do not have to sell that part because,
if you weren't,

164
00:11:08.645 --> 00:11:11.284
you're not gonna get the job anyway,
right?

165
00:11:11.284 --> 00:11:14.450
So you don't have to tell them that
you're in responsive design cuz all of us

166
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:15.740
are doing responsive design.

167
00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:20.463
What you need to do focus on the
technologies that you are strongest at,

168
00:11:20.463 --> 00:11:22.601
that you wanna work in, right?

169
00:11:22.601 --> 00:11:25.279
I saw a lot of responses I and
a lot of light,

170
00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:27.969
there's a few acronyms in there, right?

171
00:11:27.969 --> 00:11:31.741
But just focus on those technologies
that you want to work at.

172
00:11:31.741 --> 00:11:37.352
Remember the domain that you work in
is more important than a stack as well.

173
00:11:37.352 --> 00:11:41.785
Saying full stack or
front-end developer or back-end that's not

174
00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:46.618
as important versus say either to
the technology which will be a keyword.

175
00:11:46.618 --> 00:11:51.992
Or what you build in,
which is another key word or

176
00:11:51.992 --> 00:11:55.148
key context clues, right?

177
00:11:55.148 --> 00:12:00.545
Saying you're a mobile developer, I
already know that you're focusing on Java,

178
00:12:00.545 --> 00:12:03.945
IOS which means swift,
you might know some Kotlin.

179
00:12:03.945 --> 00:12:07.347
You might know, I mean,
you know how to put in the Android SDKs,

180
00:12:07.347 --> 00:12:11.516
I already know that, just for you saying
you're a mobile developer, right?

181
00:12:11.516 --> 00:12:15.771
You say iOS developer,
I know Objective C and Swift, right?

182
00:12:15.771 --> 00:12:20.536
I know that because I already have
enough experience that you're

183
00:12:20.536 --> 00:12:25.475
a mobile developer, that means you're
gonna miss iOS and Objective C.

184
00:12:25.475 --> 00:12:30.575
So with that being, when you're
doing that focus on the platform,

185
00:12:30.575 --> 00:12:35.599
if you're doing everything on the web,
you're a web developer.

186
00:12:35.599 --> 00:12:40.545
If you're doing everything on mobile,
your mobile developer like IoT,

187
00:12:40.545 --> 00:12:45.027
that's all that you really had to
focus on cuz it's the keywords.

188
00:12:45.027 --> 00:12:49.735
And the end is to bots and the person HR
who matters especially a full stack is

189
00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:53.792
like a word or indicator that why
they are using against people.

190
00:12:53.792 --> 00:12:58.064
Cuz there are some HR people that when
they see full stack, they think boot camp.

191
00:12:58.064 --> 00:13:03.020
And there's only a few boot camps
that they really wanna select from,

192
00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.476
which is the HackerRank and
General Assembly's of the world.

193
00:13:07.476 --> 00:13:12.429
So you have to really focus on
using the right type of verbiage,

194
00:13:12.429 --> 00:13:15.237
right, this isn't an indicator.

195
00:13:15.237 --> 00:13:19.372
Web developer works great, everybody
you are gonna web your web slinger,

196
00:13:19.372 --> 00:13:21.679
your next Spider Man, you do you boo boo.

197
00:13:21.679 --> 00:13:25.100
So that's the best way to handle that.
