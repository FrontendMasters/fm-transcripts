1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.250
Also, another thing you're
doing your experience,

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.720
talk about anything that you're
doing with volunteering.

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.290
So I have a protocol that I like to use,

4
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.500
I said I'm here is what you did,
what technologies you use and impact.

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.300
So anything technical you do,
you use technology,

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.630
you use what you did and
what you did it for.

7
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.930
What technology is used and the impact.

8
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.694
So let's say right here
what I'm doing now.

9
00:00:28.922 --> 00:00:32.802
To code and I'm my

10
00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:41.230
2014, Present.

11
00:00:46.868 --> 00:00:47.630
Make sure I put right here.

12
00:00:51.153 --> 00:00:56.022
Volunteer, So,

13
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.486
Like I said, what you did,
what technologies and the impact.

14
00:01:10.986 --> 00:01:11.829
Built and,

15
00:01:20.884 --> 00:01:26.306
I wanna do that, may be a little,

16
00:01:26.306 --> 00:01:31.538
maintained a project that focus

17
00:01:31.538 --> 00:01:38.915
on educating veterans and
how to write code.

18
00:01:42.695 --> 00:01:49.936
The languages, Not languages,

19
00:01:49.936 --> 00:01:56.274
technologies, tools use are Gatsby,

20
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:05.130
Netta fly, Github.

21
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.401
Let's see contentful problem,

22
00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:13.190
pretty sure I missed something,
contentful and

23
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.050
what else AWS how about that,
put that all there, AWS the,

24
00:02:22.691 --> 00:02:28.141
Currently, it has helped over

25
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:33.591
250 veterans, get jobs and

26
00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:38.000
had a socio-economic,

27
00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:49.061
Impact of, Six,

28
00:02:49.061 --> 00:02:54.051
not again, so I put that there
because even though it's volunteer is

29
00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:58.884
really impactful and
because my socio-economic impact is high.

30
00:02:58.884 --> 00:03:04.265
It has a business logic skills, the
superpower, the secret sauce when it comes

31
00:03:04.265 --> 00:03:10.090
to resumes, is especially when it comes
to hiring managers and your tech team.

32
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.280
Because your technical managers, they need
people who can code but also understand

33
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.780
the business side, how to make
decisions based upon businesses, right.

34
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.204
So I'm sitting here I say what I did,

35
00:03:22.204 --> 00:03:27.800
like this is where we build a maintain
project to focus on the education.

36
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.030
Let's put that the education of veterans,

37
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.080
how to write code, the tools that we use.

38
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.290
Always make sure you read
your stuff three times.

39
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.460
So once you get past three offhand and

40
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.090
have somebody else read it,
there's some data.

41
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.410
I can't remember where I read it.

42
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.775
But it says, that once a human
being read something three times,

43
00:03:51.775 --> 00:03:55.460
they'll know if they're right,
they'll no longer see the mistake.

44
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.770
So always have proofreader.

45
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.980
So I'm saying the tools that were
used are Gatsby, Netflay, GitHub,

46
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.222
Contentful and AWS.

47
00:04:05.222 --> 00:04:08.280
Then I'm, okay, so
he knows what he's doing.

48
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.980
Then we're currently has helped
over 250 veterans get jobs and

49
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.815
it's had a socio- economic
impact of 17.6 million.

50
00:04:14.815 --> 00:04:17.875
That perks them up, because they're,
that's business stuff,

51
00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:22.745
you know how to do things that involve
what we care about, which is money.

52
00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:27.145
Because in the end, they care about
they want you to build good things so

53
00:04:27.145 --> 00:04:30.255
that they can make money,
right and in an efficient manner.

54
00:04:30.255 --> 00:04:33.275
So, then they won't start getting
the budgets and things like that.

55
00:04:33.275 --> 00:04:35.655
And you're like, okay,
we can have these talks now.

56
00:04:35.655 --> 00:04:38.628
And you're like, so you actually,
you know what you're doing.

57
00:04:38.628 --> 00:04:41.051
So always focus on when
you're volunteering.

58
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:46.490
What's the social impact that what
you did, you did volunteer work?

59
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.430
If you build a website for a non-profit?

60
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.500
Did you focus on adding or Google
Analytics so that way they can get better

61
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.035
data to understand who their donors are,
what age and gravity the donors are.

62
00:04:57.035 --> 00:04:59.565
Did you improve their donor
process on their website,

63
00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:01.608
make sure that the donor
buttons stood out.

64
00:05:01.608 --> 00:05:04.430
And that their donor page was quick and
easy.

65
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.880
And a form worked and they didn't have to
leave the website to go to another form.

66
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.950
Because once they leave the website

67
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.620
that donor retention just
starts dwindling down.

68
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.260
Did you do any of that,
you have to think about.

69
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.540
All that stuff when you're talking
about your impact in the same way

70
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.560
when you're talking about
business internship, right.

71
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.820
So now let me do something,
I didn't do an internship.

72
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.100
Let me, you know what I use my first
job because it was marketing but

73
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.150
I was working on the DevOps team,
working on the website, right.

74
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.430
So I'll treat that as a internship.

75
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.960
&gt;&gt; Should job experience be
listed in chronological order?

76
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, you're right.

77
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.680
So I'll just show it as an example.

78
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.230
But boom, take that.

79
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.970
Put that right there,
put it in chronological order.

80
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.580
I just wanted to, cuz I had volunteer
work on there, but bam, there you go.

81
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.350
So now since I have that up there,
I have volunteer,

82
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:12.200
have this and I have so
now let's talk about, boom.

83
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.079
So we'll put this,
let's do 2000 or 2012, yeah.

84
00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:31.755
Yes, that was the marketing assistant.

85
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.870
But because when you're 24 and

86
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.179
you go to no-nprofit what happens
is it as you fix the website.

87
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.378
All right, so now once again,
I like to do things not in bullet

88
00:06:47.378 --> 00:06:52.072
form I do in a story,
let me show you, this is what I did.

89
00:06:52.072 --> 00:06:55.708
This is what I did.

90
00:06:55.708 --> 00:06:58.995
I focused on, matter of fact, I'm gonna
get rid of that first six months.

91
00:06:58.995 --> 00:07:01.629
Can I just, just say cuz this
is over death, ot six months,

92
00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:05.732
your primary focus was improving the site
speed and UI, as well as donor practices.

93
00:07:05.732 --> 00:07:08.130
Say I'm using LAMP stack, WordPress, and

94
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.610
with a specific focus on learning PHP
analytics, find a strong user base.

95
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.050
Cleaner donor processes,

96
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.750
jesup all images ensure that we're
not affecting our page speed,

97
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.910
help, save proofread, pay speed and remove
anything that's not being used locally.

98
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:31.416
As result our page speed rose by 40% and

99
00:07:31.416 --> 00:07:36.550
our mobile donor user base rose by 75%,
right.

100
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:41.130
I'm so on saying I'm giving
the story of what I did,

101
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.070
what I used to do it and
the business value.

102
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.380
Managers love business value.

103
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:52.000
I can't say that enough managers want,
why they want that they eat that stuff up.

104
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.290
They love business value.

105
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.430
They love developers,
as an entry level developer,

106
00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.420
knowing the business of business value,
developers love that.

107
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.590
I mean managers love that.

108
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.610
Just had a veteran who just
got hired as a senior Dev and

109
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.482
the first thing that the HR
person came back and told me.

110
00:08:09.482 --> 00:08:13.960
Yo, this person really
understood how to do things,

111
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.450
on a budget and
do things well on a budget.

112
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.350
I absolutely love that.

113
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.185
And then another person came
through was a junior Dev.

114
00:08:22.185 --> 00:08:25.350
She's, I don't know what to do,
all these people are amazing.

115
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.710
They know exactly what we wanna do.

116
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:32.350
They absolutely love you
understanding business value.

117
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.050
I cannot, managers love it.

118
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:35.980
They love it.

119
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.620
I can't say any better than that.

120
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.780
They absolutely love it.

121
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.720
I don't know, for
me it'd be Oreos or Redbull.

122
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.410
I don't know.

123
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:44.530
Will be the equivalent for it.

124
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.998
Will be the healthy equivalent for that.
