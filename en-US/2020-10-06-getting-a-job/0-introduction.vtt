00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.590
Hey everybody, how you guys doing?

2
00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.510
My name is Jerome Hardaway,
I am the executive editor of etsuko.

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.804
And I'm here today to talk about
getting the first frontend job and

4
00:00:10.804 --> 00:00:14.723
basically how to get the employers
to see and love your work.

5
00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:19.905
So before we get started, I'm going to
go run through my table of contents and

6
00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:23.653
let you guys see some of
the things we're gonna cover and

7
00:00:23.653 --> 00:00:26.623
a get a little deep dive
introduction of me.

8
00:00:26.623 --> 00:00:30.968
We're gonna go over what I
like to call the three users,

9
00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:35.510
technologies you need to know,
how to build your resume.

10
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.050
Then we're gonna to take a lunch break.

11
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.510
After lunch, we're gonna be
getting our GitHub employer ready.

12
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.290
And then we're gonna look at how
to build a portfolio that works.

13
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:59.590
And then finally,
macro to micro content, constantly

14
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.270
pushing things out, that will get the
attention of prospective employers, right?

15
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.878
And then we're gonna have a summary and
a light goodbye.

16
00:01:08.878 --> 00:01:15.249
Because of today, we've had some really
crazy things go on and last week, we had

17
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.520
Chadwick Boseman aka Black Panther,
I just name as the business name.

18
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.730
I don't know what his name was.

19
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.220
He passed last week due to colon cancer.

20
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.400
And I'm a big marvel fan,
if you guys haven't don't know that.

21
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.700
That's a pretty common thing on the web
about me is that I love all things marvel.

22
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.000
And I had this around.

23
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.980
So I was, you know what?

24
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.010
Today is as good as any day to
have my giant black panther

25
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.720
mask that I have never worn,
I've worn once but

26
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.160
because I'm a dork,
I have this around the house and I'm 30.

27
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.780
So, there you go.

28
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.000
So now after that, let's go ahead and
get into this, let's get alive.

29
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.260
So who am I?
Like I said, name's Jerome Hardaway.

30
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.370
They call me Captain America of the web.

31
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.470
And I get that name because I
love all things Captain America.

32
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.530
Hat right here, shields over there.

33
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.250
It's three of them, I moved them so
people didn't think I was too weird.

34
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.960
I help veterans get jobs through
my nonprofit Vets Who Code.

35
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.370
Well I'm not working as a dev Rail at
Quicken Loans where I'm focusing on tech

36
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.530
evangelism and
helping other people, other teams

37
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.310
get better while also championing
our culture to the outside world.

38
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.860
I focus on teaching veterans
everything I know about frontend,

39
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.960
every mistake I've made about Front End,
and helping them get jobs.

40
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.494
Today, I've helped over 250,
255 to exact, of veterans

41
00:02:49.494 --> 00:02:55.960
get jobs in the tech sector,
mostly in frontend.

42
00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.480
I have a few stragglers, once I've
done a DevOps, and have done a UX.

43
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.320
So rails and

44
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.500
things like that, but frontend is
where most of our veterans get jobs.

45
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.520
And I've done this with minimal resources,
minimal networking, just

46
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.851
all focus on the skills, pay the bills and
the tactics that we're gonna learn today.
