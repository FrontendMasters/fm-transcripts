00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.787
One of the things that developers
are notoriously horrible about

2
00:00:05.787 --> 00:00:10.592
is it then they build their portfolio or
their profile size or

3
00:00:10.592 --> 00:00:16.834
anything that showcases them, they think
only about what they want to build.

4
00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:20.036
Or how they can build or
what the bootcamps telling them or

5
00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:23.145
the colleges or
what people are saying on YouTube.

6
00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:25.655
They're not thinking about the user,

7
00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:28.115
which is a very important
skill that we have to have.

8
00:00:28.115 --> 00:00:29.960
We have to focus on our users.

9
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.675
Then that's the same way when
you're looking for a job.

10
00:00:32.675 --> 00:00:36.665
You have to focus on who
are gonna be the people or

11
00:00:36.665 --> 00:00:41.530
things that are gonna be interacting
with the things that you build.

12
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.920
So before this, we have to know,
in military we call it knowing our enemy,

13
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.710
getting intel, getting recon.

14
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.880
Like so, our situation report is
currently, we are in the middle of

15
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.890
a pandemic, outside is closed,
there have been some layoffs on people.

16
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.650
So you the new developer has to get recon
on who are the users that are hiring,

17
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.420
while also competing with people who
may have more experience than you.

18
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.390
So you have to figure out every blue
piece of intelligence you can get to

19
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.510
plan your portfolios, your resumes,
your CodePens, etc perfectly.

20
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.776
So let's go through the three users.

21
00:01:23.776 --> 00:01:29.855
User number one, this is the big one.

22
00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:35.695
This is your first layered defense against
getting your job, getting your goal.

23
00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:37.685
And this is HR Tech and Bots.

24
00:01:39.135 --> 00:01:43.045
Their strengths is they quickly
find the parameters that are set by

25
00:01:43.045 --> 00:01:44.380
the hiring team.

26
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.170
What that means is they usually
they scan your resumes, they scan,

27
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.070
your portfolios, they scan your LinkedIn.

28
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.805
They see those keywords, they see how
many years you've been in keywords like

29
00:01:56.805 --> 00:02:00.965
same way is when you go to a website and
ask how old are you for

30
00:02:00.965 --> 00:02:04.645
like drinking or something and
you had to put in like your birth date.

31
00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:08.405
Well, it's looking for those like that
year date, to be able to say, okay,

32
00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:13.475
this person has this amount,
this person's experience level starts at,

33
00:02:13.475 --> 00:02:16.735
let's say, 2015 and
then this person is qualified.

34
00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:24.010
This person starts less than after 2015,
then this person isn't qualified, right?

35
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.553
2015 or before they're good,
2015 or after they're not good.

36
00:02:27.553 --> 00:02:31.790
So that was a green red type of paradigm.

37
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.810
Same concept when it comes to keywords.

38
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.941
I actually saw this in real time when
you can upload a key, upload a resume,

39
00:02:39.941 --> 00:02:45.154
upload your keywords and see how many of
those keywords appear on a resume and

40
00:02:45.154 --> 00:02:48.670
how many times you have it set for
your parameters.

41
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.933
So you be like if they need every
single keyword to be said or

42
00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:56.503
at least 70% or
something like that, right?

43
00:02:56.503 --> 00:03:00.480
So these are the two things
that the bot is looking for.

44
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.925
Well, that's its strengths.

45
00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:07.250
Is to minimize the amount
of time that the HR

46
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.490
personnel have to use, but
it's not a real strength for you.

47
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.980
So you have to focus on the keywords that

48
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.398
it would use to make your resume as strong
as possible as well as your portfolio.

49
00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:24.270
Weakness is, it's not empathic,
hard data only,

50
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.740
there's no real workaround for
this beyond making sure that

51
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.690
you're using the right word,
you're using the right words often.

52
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.900
The gotcha is you don't know
what the parameters are.

53
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:46.310
So we have to do that well more intel or
we can focus on, what I like to do, which

54
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.450
we'll get more into our entire resume an
offensive protocol to write in our resume.

55
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.390
So that we play offence, not defence and
we'll get more into that.

56
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.970
But it's a robot, so
you get what you get with it.

57
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.610
Now, here is user two.

58
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.208
This is the second adversary or
ally depending on how

59
00:04:09.208 --> 00:04:13.506
they are helped to you getting your job,
right?

60
00:04:13.506 --> 00:04:17.895
These are the HR recruiters.

61
00:04:17.895 --> 00:04:23.241
Their strength, they're human,
so they have empathy,

62
00:04:23.241 --> 00:04:28.425
they have creativity,
they can be influenced.

63
00:04:28.425 --> 00:04:32.607
So you can have them like,

64
00:04:32.607 --> 00:04:37.430
Pause, like you can
influence their decisions to

65
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.390
assumptions at a greater level,
you can pique their interest.

66
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.450
Weakness, they don't have much time.

67
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.190
The average resume website
is about six seconds of

68
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.330
time per resume per website.

69
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.730
So you have to make sure that
what you're doing pops or

70
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.400
has all these keywords readily available
so it can grab their attention.

71
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.761
They tend not to be the technical ones,

72
00:05:07.761 --> 00:05:12.340
their specialty is HR, not not tech.

73
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.660
So while beyond the key words, beyond the
things that the tech team is telling them

74
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.810
what they need, they don't really
have that deep understanding which

75
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.000
can be can be a win or
a loss depending on how you use it.

76
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
The gotcha, like I said earlier,

77
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.030
decisions can be influenced by
what by design or what you build.

78
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.850
That is very important because, you have
to understand when it comes to websites,

79
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:44.780
when it comes to anything that you're
building as a developer, deep down

80
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.975
the 8020 rule of it is 80%
of people care about is,

81
00:05:48.975 --> 00:05:54.160
does it look good,
is it fast, does it work?

82
00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.490
So those are the things that can
help influence the HR recruiter.

83
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.470
All right, and here you go.

84
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.750
These are big bats, right?

85
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.820
These are people that you tend to
be a little more intimidated by if

86
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.224
you're selling your first
job because these people,

87
00:06:13.224 --> 00:06:16.628
they already had the job and
they've been at the job and

88
00:06:16.628 --> 00:06:20.567
they are the ones basically
saying you're go, no go, right?

89
00:06:20.567 --> 00:06:27.355
So the tech lead or tech team, their
strengths is that they are very technical.

90
00:06:27.355 --> 00:06:31.665
So all those terms you've been studying
on like beyond interview cake,

91
00:06:31.665 --> 00:06:36.425
on the Mozilla MDN, reading through
over and over and over again.

92
00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:40.615
These are the people that you're
gonna be able to use them on.

93
00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:46.518
These are the show, right,
these are people that are gonna ask

94
00:06:46.518 --> 00:06:50.131
you about FizzBuzz and
Fibonacci sequences and

95
00:06:50.131 --> 00:06:54.824
all that other boring stuff that
you have to get through just so

96
00:06:54.824 --> 00:06:58.366
they can pay you to change
the color of an href.

97
00:06:58.366 --> 00:07:00.411
We never say interviewing was perfect, but

98
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:03.569
we have to deal with the world the way
it is not the way we want it to be.

99
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.350
So their gotcha.

100
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.980
They can be influenced by building
rapport based on product or

101
00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.850
company values or community.

102
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.570
That's one of the things we're
going to your virtual meet ups and

103
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.940
talking on Twitter and
writing your blogs and things major.

104
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:27.000
That's where that influence to assumption
comes into play because the more

105
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.740
they know you, in the end, they're trying
to find people who can do the job or

106
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.670
people who have the potential to do the
job that they can spend eight hours with

107
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:41.960
and not end up having to go to HR
themselves for something negative.

108
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.860
Weaknesses, the harsh reality is they
may have gatekeeping practices built in.

109
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:52.180
As I just said earlier,
going through FizzBuzz to change colors

110
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:58.260
on a website is a pretty weird
thing that we do in tech.

111
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.410
That we have to work around and
we as a community have to be better.

112
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.780
But until then we have to train for
the worst case scenarios

113
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.810
versus get upset about the worst
case scenarios and react negatively.

114
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:15.940
So you have to be cognizant of that,
especially some of them may have

115
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:20.488
biases against bootcamps,
against self taught things that nature or

116
00:08:20.488 --> 00:08:24.553
against CS grads,
I've have actually seen that.

117
00:08:24.553 --> 00:08:28.503
So we have to prepare to adapt and
overcome for

118
00:08:28.503 --> 00:08:31.573
those things that we see
that we might interact with.
