1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.382
Now, I wanna get to another exercise.

2
00:00:03.382 --> 00:00:10.960
It's based on the resume, but it's
exercises only based on the experience.

3
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.870
I want everyone to try to come up with
one bullet of why I want their job.

4
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.280
I want the description of the job.

5
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.265
I want the tools you use in a job and

6
00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:28.327
I want the impact of what
you did with the job.

7
00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:34.190
So job, what you did,
how you did it with the tools, or impact.

8
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.630
Or if you didn't have a job,
job, what you did and how, and

9
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.635
then try to pull the soft
skills out of it.

10
00:00:41.635 --> 00:00:46.780
Give you ten minutes to try to pull
either with a job that you've had before

11
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.020
that isn't technical, pull the soft skills
out of it, so we give feedback for that.

12
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.970
Or a job that you had, or
internship, volunteer work.

13
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.250
Pick your poison and we'll work with it.

14
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.314
So that way we'll get that experience up,
so you guys can talk about it.

15
00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:14.345
Let me start working on this right now,
let's see what you guys have.

16
00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:20.748
Tanae, all right, so you said you
developed a scalable website for

17
00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:26.490
a content creation agency using
web technologies like CSS.

18
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.947
So you either used the technologies or
like technology.

19
00:01:30.947 --> 00:01:35.815
So we're gonna say is I used
the web technology CSS,

20
00:01:35.815 --> 00:01:39.060
Flexbox, PHP, and SaaS hosted.

21
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.156
So we're gonna say from that,

22
00:01:42.156 --> 00:01:46.690
using web technologies, using PHP and AWS.

23
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.771
The website is optimized for SEO,

24
00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:52.840
which helped the agency to get
more clients around the globe.

25
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.562
So that's your business impact.

26
00:01:54.562 --> 00:01:59.050
So what we're gonna say is I
developed a scalable website for

27
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.320
a content creation agency.

28
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.795
Technologies I used, using LAMP stack
with AWS, I was able to optimize

29
00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:11.920
the website for SEO, which helped
the agency get more clientele.

30
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.200
All right, Alan.

31
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.112
Alan is Millie North America
materials manager 2017, 2018.

32
00:02:22.112 --> 00:02:24.514
When I started,
the shipments were difficult to locate and

33
00:02:24.514 --> 00:02:27.031
manual inventory accounts were
made up of seven hours a week.

34
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:30.850
I developed an application were HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript

35
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.440
to show the layout of the warehouse and
details of all the shipments.

36
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.140
It was accessible from any device and
updated in real time.

37
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.740
This reduced the time needed to do
manual inventory counts just two,

38
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.015
three hours per month.

39
00:02:43.015 --> 00:02:44.600
Yo, that is spot on.

40
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.781
That is what I'm talking
about right there.

41
00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:48.590
You've showcased what you did.

42
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.790
You showcase that, guess what,

43
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.070
even though this was a job that
didn't really need it anything to do,

44
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.450
I still developed something that was able
to handle, like do the work for it, right?

45
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.778
And you showed the time saved, because
a company's business time is money, right?

46
00:03:06.778 --> 00:03:09.016
And you did that, that's perfect.

47
00:03:09.016 --> 00:03:15.493
Alan, if you're hearing this,
good job, that was great.

48
00:03:15.493 --> 00:03:18.382
Air a round of applause for that guy.

49
00:03:18.382 --> 00:03:24.890
All right, Ronald,
software engineer intern, Near app.

50
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.495
Lead a team of four engineers and on
a front end and collaborated with back end

51
00:03:30.495 --> 00:03:36.452
teams directly in application lifecycle
process for a ride sharing app on iOS and

52
00:03:36.452 --> 00:03:41.025
Android with a focus on designing,
coding, and debugging.

53
00:03:41.025 --> 00:03:46.808
Okay, so you're missing your impact on it,
what did you learn?

54
00:03:46.808 --> 00:03:51.726
Cuz if you're doing this as an intern,
so you could either as an intern,

55
00:03:51.726 --> 00:03:56.565
you'd have to focus on what did you
learn or what was the impact for you,

56
00:03:56.565 --> 00:04:00.750
was it like leadership skills,
collaborative skills?

57
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.350
What was that?

58
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.230
I'm not really seeing that.

59
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.610
So I think that's the only place
that needs to be improved is that

60
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.060
we need to have the impact.

61
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.058
How did it impact you?

62
00:04:09.058 --> 00:04:11.090
How did it impact the company?

63
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.862
So you guys were working on another Uber,
so that was cool.

64
00:04:15.862 --> 00:04:19.818
Even though, they stay in trouble.

65
00:04:19.818 --> 00:04:23.820
All right, Zoe.

66
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.900
So we got business developer manager
investment bank incorporated NDA.

67
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.480
So I was a business development
manager for an investment bank.

68
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.119
So where I taught my customers
to use our automated

69
00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:44.890
underwriting system to
approve residential loans.

70
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.460
I use my technical skills
to teach my customers and

71
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.900
at the same time use soft skills to build,
expand, and maintain my customer base.

72
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.440
So if you say you're
growing your customer base,

73
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.930
we already know if you're
expanding your customer base,

74
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.990
we already know this maintain we
don't have to say maintaining because

75
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.170
it's getting bigger, you have more people,
so you have to do that.

76
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.710
So you build and
expanding your customer base, right?

77
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.120
Done, right?

78
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.260
Use your technical skills
to teach your customers

79
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.190
how to use this automated
underwriting system.

80
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:27.012
You have to say, was it remotely or
was it you walk them through it hand hand?

81
00:05:27.012 --> 00:05:28.460
Or you had to be able to showcase that?

82
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.510
That way it shows like I think
what you're trying to convey there

83
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.950
is that you had the aptitude and

84
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:40.000
the communication skills to teach
someone something that was difficult.

85
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.730
That's what you're trying to convey there.

86
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.120
And which I love, is just this
needs a little bit of tweaking.

87
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.551
So that's what needs to be there.

88
00:05:50.826 --> 00:05:51.830
Chad, yay.

89
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.580
My goodness, Chad.

90
00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:01.117
Okay, stem hero, Minneapolis, Minnesota
2019 to present, full stack developer.

91
00:06:01.117 --> 00:06:05.564
Owner of freelance developer for
independent software development company

92
00:06:05.564 --> 00:06:09.531
providing full stack development
services for small businesses and

93
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:12.230
nonprofits in the Twin Cities area.

94
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.830
Okay, so

95
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.330
you research developing tools to improve
web applications that are accurate tools.

96
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.160
Apply strong knowledge,

97
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.190
JavaScript, HTML and frameworks,
like Node.js to develop solutions.

98
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.640
Collaborate with technical or client
technical teams to support the development

99
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.240
of products through the SDLC
that's a acronym, like remember.

100
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.320
I'm not gonna know that no one's gonna
know that unless you work with that.

101
00:06:35.385 --> 00:06:38.120
Utilize knowledge of Agile and
work on projects and

102
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.010
test driven development cycles, develop
test plans and develop schedules for

103
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.520
achieving project objectives and
deliverables.

104
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.530
Formulate system scope and objectives
to create and modify application,

105
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.860
including all functional features,
analyze, design, develop, and implement.

106
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.350
Solutions and dashboards based upon
requirements and roadmaps develop,

107
00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.780
update, technical documentation and
cuts off.

108
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:07.432
But what I've seen the biggest thing
is there's no impact on any of these,

109
00:07:07.432 --> 00:07:11.663
it's not showing what is the benefit,
what happened?

110
00:07:11.663 --> 00:07:14.825
There's a lot of stuff of like
a lot of technical things, but

111
00:07:14.825 --> 00:07:18.200
what it's not saying is like
this is how it impacted, right?

112
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.060
When I said, hey, yo, I built a website

113
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:26.150
that raise $10,000 in 27 hours for
a fallen veteran.

114
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.080
There was the impact of that.

115
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.010
I built this thing, this is what
the impact of it was, all right?

116
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.400
So that's what you have to do,

117
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.150
the impact matters to leadership
to business people, right?

118
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:46.670
They want to know what is
the thing that did happen?

119
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.730
What's the social impact?

120
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:48.860
What's the business impact?

121
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.190
What was the educational impact to you?

122
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.250
What's professional impact for you?

123
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:59.074
You have to show not just what you did,
but also show the impact of it.

124
00:08:01.485 --> 00:08:06.365
Laura, regulatory liaison,
June 2009 January 2013 authored

125
00:08:06.365 --> 00:08:11.565
reply comments to regulators explaining
detailed data, trends changes and

126
00:08:11.565 --> 00:08:16.640
policies implemented department
processes reduce response time.

127
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.230
Over 16% in the first year, that's good,

128
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:26.230
you are showing that
you understand data and

129
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.400
trends and
you're also showing the business impact.

130
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.386
So that's good, I'll give that an A.

131
00:08:37.678 --> 00:08:42.123
Ross's US Census numerator,
learn to quickly connect with respondents,

132
00:08:42.123 --> 00:08:46.708
dealt with disagreeable and hostile
situations calmly and professionally,

133
00:08:46.708 --> 00:08:51.100
recorded and protected information
efficiently and accurately.

134
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.000
Okay, so cuz I'm a veteran,

135
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.470
I can definitely tell you this,
no one likes we're hostile in your resume.

136
00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.083
[LAUGH] The easiest way to lighthouse

137
00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:05.789
allies eyebrow goes up
is he's a hostile eye.

138
00:09:05.789 --> 00:09:11.915
I use hostile and one of my first resumes
when I first came out of the military,

139
00:09:11.915 --> 00:09:16.171
no callbacks,
I'm that walking meme of their life.

140
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:17.390
So why don't you have a lot of
things about your first job?

141
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.280
You'd be like,

142
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.200
you know what, I'm not gonna tell
you because I kind of need this job.

143
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.810
So that was me when I first came out.

144
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.892
So I wanna say drop hostile,

145
00:09:26.892 --> 00:09:31.778
learn to quickly connect with respondents.

146
00:09:31.778 --> 00:09:36.998
I will try to reword this an idea of like,

147
00:09:36.998 --> 00:09:44.840
I can work well with others or
I can help people connect.

148
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.180
So I will say I learned to
connect with respondents.

149
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:53.980
And then I was able to,
I'm not gonna say dealt with disagreeable,

150
00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.190
but it's not personal,
it doesn't sound empathic.

151
00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:03.737
So I'm gonna say,
Able to work professionally

152
00:10:03.737 --> 00:10:09.910
with people who might not have
agreed with me on things, right?

153
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.560
So it's something like that,
I would workshop that more.

154
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:19.680
But I'll make that nicer because you say
that isn't like okay, that's probably,

155
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.760
recorded and protected information
officially accurately.

156
00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.314
So you're right there,

157
00:10:26.314 --> 00:10:30.318
you're trying to showcase a little
bit of attention to detail.

158
00:10:30.318 --> 00:10:35.001
You need to focus on making
this more of a story, one, and

159
00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:37.733
two, I would like to record it and

160
00:10:37.733 --> 00:10:43.318
protected information efficiently and
accurately a little more.

161
00:10:43.318 --> 00:10:48.845
I just feel like I could just all this
whole thing could be said better and how

162
00:10:48.845 --> 00:10:55.250
do I feel like you could really workshop
this in a manner that makes it friendlier.

163
00:10:55.250 --> 00:11:00.290
Like I see what you're saying but
it comes off as a little abrupt, so

164
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.110
we have to soften that up.

165
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:06.188
We would be like, okay,
as a census enumerator,

166
00:11:06.188 --> 00:11:11.141
I focus on connecting with clients
to get the information and

167
00:11:11.141 --> 00:11:13.877
secure it in a efficient manner.

168
00:11:13.877 --> 00:11:19.739
Yeah, so as a census enumerator
I connected with respondents and

169
00:11:19.739 --> 00:11:24.857
securely and efficiently,
securely, efficiently and

170
00:11:24.857 --> 00:11:29.665
accurately received
the information needed.

171
00:11:29.665 --> 00:11:34.706
Oftentimes I worked through
disagreements in order

172
00:11:34.706 --> 00:11:39.638
to have a positive outcome,
something like that.

173
00:11:42.533 --> 00:11:45.715
And I'm really up here working hard, look.

174
00:11:45.715 --> 00:11:54.135
[LAUGH] Okay, just do the whole
giggity thing as well as realize.

175
00:11:54.135 --> 00:11:57.315
[LAUGH] So let's look at,

176
00:12:01.733 --> 00:12:06.707
Okay, I have a mobile developer,
I made a engaging UI heavy movie,

177
00:12:06.707 --> 00:12:10.198
discovery app or
a start up on the iOS platform,

178
00:12:10.198 --> 00:12:15.720
the moon current application,
swift UI, react and React Native.

179
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.390
You're missing the impact on that one,
so it was UI heavy,

180
00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:26.030
so what was the purpose one as it
is the perf good is the light.

181
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.620
What are you trying to tell me?

182
00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.550
What did you do?

183
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:32.790
Well, are you saying
that the impact is that

184
00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.740
you learn how to do something
because you made a UI heavy?

185
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:43.150
Excuse me meta UI heavy app, so now
because of that you're able to move on to

186
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:48.240
React Native, like I think that needs
to be clarified a little bit more.

187
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.147
But other than that, that's good.

188
00:12:52.545 --> 00:12:55.570
All right, so
we got a Microsoft in here, okay?

189
00:12:55.570 --> 00:13:00.336
As a Microsoft we're producer contractor
on the products office comm team I

190
00:13:00.336 --> 00:13:04.654
set up OneNote documentation for
accessibility to bring consistent

191
00:13:04.654 --> 00:13:09.583
accessibility fixes across the website,
using, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

192
00:13:09.583 --> 00:13:13.259
And this increase in happiness and
disabled users and

193
00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:18.440
cut down on arguments among
developers about the correct fixes.

194
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:24.050
Yeah, anybody who can keep our developers
from arguing over tech stuff is a hero.

195
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.230
So we salute you cuz that's all we do.

196
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:32.091
We love to argue about it every weekend we
want to get a fight over tabs or spaces,

197
00:13:32.091 --> 00:13:37.186
or tabs or spaces or semi colons or none,
can't maximum windows, it's nothing.

198
00:13:37.186 --> 00:13:41.017
But yeah all right, Matt,
I'll definitely, yeah,

199
00:13:41.017 --> 00:13:45.110
that gets to pair so far or
many of you guys did pretty good.
