1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.020
This is where you make your bread and
butter, right?

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.070
Macro to micro content.

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.230
What this means is taking large pieces
of things that you're building.

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.680
And turning it to smaller things that
you're building to continue what I like

5
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.080
to call the HR funnel of getting
the attention of hiring managers, right?

6
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.480
So you see, you have your website.

7
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.794
Here's the hiring funnel, the website,
portfolio that has email capture,

8
00:00:26.794 --> 00:00:31.530
and contact form, and then which
hopefully leads to a phone call.

9
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.563
But what happens first
is you have your social.

10
00:00:34.563 --> 00:00:38.494
You're pushing everything out
using scheduling tool like Buffer.

11
00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:42.383
You're pushing projects and links, and
you're doing Twitch, doing YouTube.

12
00:00:42.383 --> 00:00:45.492
You're blogging,
you're tweeting things out,

13
00:00:45.492 --> 00:00:50.480
which leads to people looking at the
website, which leads to the phone call.

14
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.850
It's a continuous cycle over and
over and over again.

15
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.597
This is how everyone does it.

16
00:00:57.597 --> 00:01:01.725
And once you get to mid and
senior, they know that, hey,

17
00:01:01.725 --> 00:01:05.596
the more things I build and
the more things I produce,

18
00:01:05.596 --> 00:01:09.917
the more things I can showcase,
which ups my versatility.

19
00:01:09.917 --> 00:01:13.087
Which actually showcases,
sends people to my website,

20
00:01:13.087 --> 00:01:18.020
which has other people who hire, people
who are in hiring decisions, contact me.

21
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:25.090
So we are constantly moving in
this flowing state of producing,

22
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.350
pushing, and then dealing with
the social aspect of people, right?

23
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.973
So there's a few things
that you can do here,

24
00:01:33.973 --> 00:01:36.605
like for instance,
we had the GitHub issue.

25
00:01:36.605 --> 00:01:39.281
People were like, well,
my GitHub's not fleshed out.

26
00:01:39.281 --> 00:01:44.700
These are other ways that you can do to
get people's attention and stuff, right?

27
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.485
So one way is Codepen, right?

28
00:01:49.485 --> 00:01:52.100
So I actually have this one up already.

29
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:54.676
Right here,

30
00:01:54.676 --> 00:02:00.210
this is a person's website I was trying
to show you guys about this Codepen.

31
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.506
She has two dogs.

32
00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:02.856
She absolutely loves them and

33
00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.830
she did everything she could to put
them as a part of her projects.

34
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.960
She put her Codepen up,
and she had bubbles.

35
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.260
Lucy and her ukulele,
all of these designs.

36
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.320
She did a grid imagery,
CSS train 404 page.

37
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.400
The force is strong with this one,
so she did this.

38
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.378
I think she did this for
May the 4th, right?

39
00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:28.960
Puppy-loader, so she has a loading
screen for her with a puppy on it.

40
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.580
She did all this stuff just to showcase
everything that she wanted to do.

41
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.713
How a firewall should work,
just a ton of stuff.

42
00:02:40.713 --> 00:02:44.820
She was one of our troops I think two,
three years ago.

43
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.360
And this is how she really made
her name and helped her get jobs.

44
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.790
She used her Codepen to actually attract,

45
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.720
which attracted employers cuz
they were interested in her work.

46
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.145
So that's what I recommend.

47
00:03:01.145 --> 00:03:04.712
Those of you who are more design-focused
as well, this is a great place.

48
00:03:04.712 --> 00:03:06.543
Chris Coyier and his crew,

49
00:03:06.543 --> 00:03:11.680
they have a newsletter that shoots
out design challenges every week.

50
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.135
So you don't even have to
think about the stuff.

51
00:03:13.135 --> 00:03:15.394
You can just go look at
what they're doing and

52
00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:17.600
focus on that week on
building what that is.

53
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:25.152
And then picking that, then send it
out via Twitter, things like that.

54
00:03:25.152 --> 00:03:31.575
Let me see if I can find someone who
has a really great story about that.

55
00:03:31.575 --> 00:03:36.146
Cuz I wanna tell you guys
the story of Jacob Oakley,

56
00:03:36.146 --> 00:03:44.427
if I can find his, Where he's at,
I can't find where he's at.

57
00:03:44.427 --> 00:03:47.350
That's all right, I'm still gonna tell
you guys the story of Jacob Oakley.

58
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.453
Jacob was an HR.

59
00:03:49.453 --> 00:03:55.161
He worked in HR in the army and he came
to Vets Who Code about four years ago.

60
00:03:55.161 --> 00:03:59.385
And he was hands down the worst front-end
developer that I ever met when I first

61
00:03:59.385 --> 00:03:59.899
met him.

62
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.790
And he had no idea to how
he consistently practice.

63
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.480
So we put him on, this is my first pip
that I've ever done at Vets Who Code.

64
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.370
We put him on his
performance plan that will

65
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.835
have him pushing things
out a lot through Codepen.

66
00:04:15.835 --> 00:04:20.135
And as he got better about
pushing more things out,

67
00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:25.035
he was able to consistently
start getting the attention of

68
00:04:25.035 --> 00:04:28.937
Chris Coyier and
their team for his Codepens.

69
00:04:28.937 --> 00:04:32.887
Till we put him on our Codepen team,
which he now leads, and

70
00:04:32.887 --> 00:04:37.469
he helps other troops learn how to
write code on our Codepen team, and

71
00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:41.890
they still consistently get
picked pen on Chris Coyier.

72
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.886
Chris Coyier was so
impressed with us work.

73
00:04:44.886 --> 00:04:48.475
He came and
did ask me anything with us, and

74
00:04:48.475 --> 00:04:53.360
Jacob was able to host Chris Coyier for
about an hour.

75
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.740
So that's how these processes work.

76
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.540
Now Jacob, he ended up getting so
talented in his craft that

77
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.054
his first job as a developer
was a mid-level position.

78
00:05:05.054 --> 00:05:08.164
So he skipped entry and went to mid.

79
00:05:08.164 --> 00:05:12.995
He was actually the second person
at Vets Who Code to ever skip

80
00:05:12.995 --> 00:05:17.555
entry level programmer and
go straight to mid or senior.

81
00:05:17.555 --> 00:05:21.583
So Codepen is a very powerful
tool if you use it right,

82
00:05:21.583 --> 00:05:24.907
if you do the work, if you're consistent.

83
00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:27.287
Consistency is key when
it comes to content.

84
00:05:27.287 --> 00:05:30.190
You can't do it once and then be like,
all right, I'm done with it.

85
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.130
You have to continuously and
consistently produce things and

86
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.954
then push it out regularly.

87
00:05:41.075 --> 00:05:44.880
Here we go, Twitch,
if you get more personal,

88
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.017
if you like having fun with people,
this is a great avenue of a way

89
00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:54.795
to reach out to people and
get what you're doing out there.

90
00:05:54.795 --> 00:05:56.729
This is a page by CodeHustle.

91
00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.161
He started a few weeks ago,
and people love him.

92
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:06.211
He already has 3.1 thousand followers.

93
00:06:06.211 --> 00:06:11.441
That's a lot of people to look
at you talking about code.

94
00:06:11.441 --> 00:06:12.854
Sorry, but yeah, that's crazy.

95
00:06:12.854 --> 00:06:15.216
So that's another way.

96
00:06:15.216 --> 00:06:19.475
If you're personal and you like
being there and if you're okay with,

97
00:06:19.475 --> 00:06:24.543
most important, you're okay with failure
in public, Twitch is perfect for you.

98
00:06:24.543 --> 00:06:27.871
Seeing how you talk yourself through
problems, seeing how you fix things,

99
00:06:27.871 --> 00:06:29.904
seeing how you're interacting with people.

100
00:06:29.904 --> 00:06:32.273
While you're talking,
you pause in the chat, things like that,

101
00:06:32.273 --> 00:06:34.366
employers pay attention
to that type of stuff.

102
00:06:34.366 --> 00:06:39.110
So you wanna make sure that hey, yo,
when I had this stuff up, I'm doing this.

103
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.630
Let me make sure I put my best foot
forward because you never know who's gonna

104
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.002
see it, because,
guess what, they're hiring.

105
00:06:45.002 --> 00:06:48.459
I've had two veterans who have gone
through, have done Twitch, and

106
00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:51.275
they've gotten jobs based
off their Twitch channels.

107
00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:54.539
And CodeHustle,
he's a part of our team, and

108
00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:59.746
he gets a lot of good feedback and
job opportunities just because of this.

109
00:07:06.112 --> 00:07:08.922
YouTube, now you're looking for
a little something,

110
00:07:08.922 --> 00:07:11.750
a little more old school,
okay, and we all say it that.

111
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.936
But YouTube's where it's at.

112
00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:16.730
They have YouTube live.

113
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:17.870
It's been around forever.

114
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:18.964
It's a stable brand.

115
00:07:18.964 --> 00:07:20.480
It's more mature.

116
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.970
You can have a vlog video cast.

117
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.350
Some of you people that are on the call or

118
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.530
on the workshop right now have actually
learned through YouTube, right?

119
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.800
So you can do, you can teach
through YouTube, upload it and

120
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.290
have your channel where you're doing that,
right?

121
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.889
So you should definitely think about that.

122
00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:42.850
Think about your flow.

123
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.598
Try to make it once a week.

124
00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:46.040
Plan it out, talk about it.

125
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.010
Who's some good YouTube
channel teachers out there?

126
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.592
Anyone knows?

127
00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:56.324
&gt;&gt; Traversy Media is the biggest thing.

128
00:07:56.324 --> 00:07:57.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Traversy Media.

129
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.840
Yeah, they do a lot of that stuff.

130
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.283
I know, I think there's a guy
named James from Memphis.

131
00:08:02.283 --> 00:08:03.830
I think he does a lot of stuff on there.

132
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.710
He's a dev advocate there, James Quick.

133
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.926
So that's a really good area.

134
00:08:09.926 --> 00:08:12.435
Just only recent,
just learned on the way how I know him.

135
00:08:12.435 --> 00:08:14.473
Traversy Media is a great one.

136
00:08:14.473 --> 00:08:19.350
I think This Dot Co or Tracy Lee, they
do a lot of things on YouTube as well.

137
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:24.240
So definitely use this as an avenue
to help grow your brand and

138
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.190
gain your exposure, so people who
are hiring, they have eyes on you.

139
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.527
It's all about right now,
as a person trying to get a job,

140
00:08:31.527 --> 00:08:36.036
as a person trying to get that interview,
it's all about getting eyes on you.

141
00:08:36.036 --> 00:08:42.050
So there's a saying in tech that
getting a job is a job itself.

142
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:44.770
So you have to plan that stuff out.

143
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.939
So that way, you can go out there and
consistently produce, so

144
00:08:48.939 --> 00:08:53.266
you can get the type of eyes and
looks that you're trying to get for

145
00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:57.220
your resume and your portfolio,
so you get the interview.

146
00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:03.057
When it comes to blogging, there's no
place better, in my opinion, than dev.to.

147
00:09:03.057 --> 00:09:09.428
One, you're not competing with everyone,
right?

148
00:09:09.428 --> 00:09:13.670
Only other place better than blogging than
on dev.to is probably your own blog, but

149
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.963
you might not get as many eyes
on it as you would as dev.to.

150
00:09:16.963 --> 00:09:22.500
So even cross-posting or for extra credit,
put it on dev.to, utilize our API and

151
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.106
then have it pushed to your website
using serverless technologies.

152
00:09:27.106 --> 00:09:28.057
You can do that.

153
00:09:28.057 --> 00:09:31.370
I've seen it before, it's pretty awesome.

154
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:36.740
So when you're doing that with this
blogging and posting, make sure

155
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:43.024
you're using all of their hashtags and
you're sharing that stuff out.

156
00:09:43.024 --> 00:09:49.140
You wanna make sure that it's something
that people can resonate with and

157
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.740
that you consistently share.

158
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.902
I can't recommend this enough
as writing has really helped my

159
00:09:56.902 --> 00:10:00.544
career over the past six
years really blossom.

160
00:10:04.515 --> 00:10:09.455
And finally, Cuz I know

161
00:10:09.455 --> 00:10:14.401
a lot of people have stuff
about social media, Twitter.

162
00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:16.520
Name of the game is Twitter.

163
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.520
You can't go wrong with Twitter.

164
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:23.158
Twitter is where everybody you
wanna know in tech is there.

165
00:10:23.158 --> 00:10:26.530
Every job you don't have in tech is there.

166
00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.794
You can't build your network.

167
00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:30.144
You can't build your community.

168
00:10:30.144 --> 00:10:35.609
You can't be taken, I mean,
you could, but it would be very hard.

169
00:10:35.609 --> 00:10:36.884
You can't really do,

170
00:10:36.884 --> 00:10:41.490
especially in this remote time where
in-person meetings is difficult.

171
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:46.486
It's really hard to get
the type of relationships and

172
00:10:46.486 --> 00:10:50.045
tractions you need without Twitter.

173
00:10:50.045 --> 00:10:54.030
Greg Curl is a great example of
somebody who has been doing it, right?

174
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:58.707
He's been using that
100DaysOfCode hashtag and

175
00:10:58.707 --> 00:11:02.116
talking about his journey at coding.

176
00:11:02.116 --> 00:11:06.676
He's been getting the type of looks and
information that he wants,

177
00:11:06.676 --> 00:11:10.600
that he needs to make sure that
people are focusing on him.

178
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.260
He's already starting to get calls.

179
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:18.300
So this is what you will want to, look at
the compliment, didn't even notice that.

180
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.890
So this is what you would
want to do as you wanna grow,

181
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:27.763
as you wanna use social media,
particularly Twitter, to your advantage.

182
00:11:27.763 --> 00:11:32.227
I have seen people use Instagram as well.

183
00:11:32.227 --> 00:11:34.640
I suck as an Instagrammer.

184
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.537
I'm the worst person on Instagram,
and I have a voice made for radio,

185
00:11:39.537 --> 00:11:43.773
or face made for radio,
whatever that old person saying is.

186
00:11:43.773 --> 00:11:47.540
Either way,
Instagram is not exactly my bag.

187
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.594
But when it comes to stuff,

188
00:11:51.594 --> 00:11:56.184
that's where people look at.

189
00:11:56.184 --> 00:12:00.820
Addy Osmani, I think he's on
there is Addyo for Instagram.

190
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.931
He does great with his Instagram,
if you guys are looking for

191
00:12:03.931 --> 00:12:05.395
someone to follow on there.

192
00:12:05.395 --> 00:12:08.532
But he's also on Twitter as well.

193
00:12:08.532 --> 00:12:12.490
But he's an engineering manager at Google,
so people follow him regardless.
