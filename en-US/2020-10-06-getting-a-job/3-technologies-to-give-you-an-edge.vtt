1
00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.258
All right, so now we're gonna go into,
now these are our big three.

2
00:00:03.258 --> 00:00:05.027
These are the fundamentals
that you have to know.

3
00:00:05.027 --> 00:00:10.503
But these three are a theme,
these tools are things

4
00:00:10.503 --> 00:00:15.856
that if you them,
you're going to really shine.

5
00:00:15.856 --> 00:00:18.700
If you showcase them,
you're going to really shine.

6
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.784
You have to deep dive about these things,
especially when it comes to

7
00:00:23.784 --> 00:00:28.708
bigger companies because they
are using a lot of these things now.

8
00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:32.279
Design systems,
design systems are super important.

9
00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.645
Basically a set of
interconnected patterns and

10
00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:40.945
practices across the company to quickly
aid in the digital development and

11
00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:45.040
product development across the board,
right?

12
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.883
So think of it like a style
guide on steroids, right?

13
00:00:48.883 --> 00:00:52.474
So it lets you know how
you do the class names.

14
00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:54.697
And you can pull things automatically in,

15
00:00:54.697 --> 00:00:57.981
it already has components that
are pre-made that you can use.

16
00:00:57.981 --> 00:01:01.059
So so this is how this thing is done.

17
00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.172
You have to understand how to use them,
how to build them, their importance.

18
00:01:07.172 --> 00:01:14.020
Code.gov and the I believe they're
called the US Digital Defense Agency,

19
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.302
Digital Agency,
I think I'm messing that up.

20
00:01:18.302 --> 00:01:24.545
But they both have style guides that
they've created that are really great.

21
00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:26.945
They're A1, and
when it comes to a beginner,

22
00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:29.047
you wanna look at something open source.

23
00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:32.734
And deep dive on that on
the science of design systems.

24
00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:38.680
I highly recommend you go through those,
and definitely look that stuff up.

25
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.957
Web accessibility,
can't harp on this enough.

26
00:01:40.957 --> 00:01:45.827
But especially in this current era and
during we're in, what, 2020?

27
00:01:45.827 --> 00:01:50.941
People, companies are getting hit left and
right on web accessibility.

28
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:56.588
It started around 2019 where Papa John's I
believe was the first major lawsuit or

29
00:01:56.588 --> 00:01:59.419
Domino's, I think, I can't remember.

30
00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:04.847
[LAUGH] One of the pizza companies
that got hit by a large lawsuit.

31
00:02:04.847 --> 00:02:07.489
And then it just kept rolling downhill,

32
00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.696
big companies getting hit by
lawsuits with web accessibility.

33
00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:17.133
So having a deep understanding of AA and
AAA web accessibility,

34
00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:22.378
I recommend you go to W3C and
understand their CWAG ratings.

35
00:02:22.378 --> 00:02:24.158
Is it CWAG, or, yeah, there you go.

36
00:02:24.158 --> 00:02:29.352
And you focus on that stuff and
make sure your own website's accessible,

37
00:02:29.352 --> 00:02:33.808
and that you can speak about
this stuff clearly, eloquently.

38
00:02:33.808 --> 00:02:40.067
And eyeball those,
learn about [LAUGH] a very funny story,

39
00:02:40.067 --> 00:02:45.172
we had a debate on me using a color for
my slides,

40
00:02:45.172 --> 00:02:50.140
and I was like, no,
I know that looks right.

41
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.111
That's a four to one ratio,
I know it's right.

42
00:02:52.111 --> 00:02:54.530
And then also I was like, you're right.

43
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.024
Okay, but I still don't like it,
change it.

44
00:02:58.024 --> 00:03:01.879
You know what, Mark,
breaking my heart, but did it so

45
00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.906
[LAUGH] yeah,
he's laughing cuz like yeah, that was me.

46
00:03:04.906 --> 00:03:10.329
But yeah, that's how you've set yourself
apart, being able to know that like,

47
00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.220
those are little things that you can
know and pull off the top of your head.

48
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.239
Okay, when you're pressing the link,
how many indicators does it have?

49
00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.791
Should you have a cursor indicator,
then it should also have an underline or

50
00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:24.630
something else.

51
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.574
Let the user know that hey,
yo, you're on a link, right?

52
00:03:28.574 --> 00:03:31.472
You're hovering over a link,
this is clickable, do something.

53
00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:35.076
Same thing with buttons, anything that's
clickable should have two indicators

54
00:03:35.076 --> 00:03:38.540
minimum on it, right, to let people know
that yo, you can do stuff with this.

55
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.680
This is interactive, right?

56
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.661
So that's why websites that is something
that is no gate is being kept.

57
00:03:45.661 --> 00:03:50.047
It's open source, you can go research it,
you can deep dive in it.

58
00:03:50.047 --> 00:03:55.658
And there are people, Marcy Sutton,
she's a rock star in it.

59
00:03:55.658 --> 00:03:57.510
If you find her on Twitter,
she absolutely loves it.

60
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.170
She will talk your head off about
web accessibility on all the things.

61
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.520
And you can literally, Frontend Masters
has a course going on for it.

62
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.675
You guys can literally just deep dive and
enjoy all the web accessibility things.

63
00:04:11.675 --> 00:04:16.581
Personally, it helped my career
over the past two years a lot.

64
00:04:16.581 --> 00:04:20.543
I was one of those people that was against
web accessibility, not against it, but

65
00:04:20.543 --> 00:04:24.172
just wasn't a big deal because I just
want to JavaScript, all the things.

66
00:04:24.172 --> 00:04:27.541
But after a year and
a half of using it, and

67
00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:32.630
focusing only on that it really
helped my career skyrocket.

68
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.571
So I definitely recommend if you're
a beginner and you're looking for

69
00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:40.656
something to add some extra firepower
to your resume, to your skill set.

70
00:04:40.656 --> 00:04:46.157
Focus on accessibility,
companies are looking for it like crazy.

71
00:04:46.157 --> 00:04:49.384
Usage of APIs, that's one of the things,

72
00:04:49.384 --> 00:04:54.865
everybody talks about JavaScript,
building things with JavaScript.

73
00:04:54.865 --> 00:04:58.289
But no one really talks about when you're
hearing the entry-level developers,

74
00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.330
no one's talking about,
how are you manipulating data?

75
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.989
We live in a serverless world right now,

76
00:05:03.989 --> 00:05:07.440
everything is gonna be put in an API,
a RESTful API.

77
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.966
And it's going to be pushed to the web or
it's either gonna be built,

78
00:05:11.966 --> 00:05:16.690
it's gonna be pulled in to a RESTful API
to have that data manipulated.

79
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.300
So you need to be able to talk
about API's and how to use them.

80
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.779
There's several GitHub repos out there.

81
00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:31.320
I'll put them in here as examples that
actually have a huge list of free API's.

82
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.356
Even one of my veterans,
they've made a list of API's.

83
00:05:34.356 --> 00:05:39.740
Matter of fact, let me, There we go.

84
00:05:43.244 --> 00:05:45.968
Here we go.

85
00:05:45.968 --> 00:05:52.206
So, here's a list of
API's that you can use.

86
00:05:52.206 --> 00:05:54.433
Insult generator, that sounds fun.

87
00:05:58.854 --> 00:06:01.665
Miscellaneous collections,
movies and comics,

88
00:06:01.665 --> 00:06:04.550
let's say you better
the Marvel Developer Portal.

89
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.531
This is my favorite,
I love this one, of course, Simpsons.

90
00:06:08.531 --> 00:06:11.356
Rick and Morty,
if you're into dark humor and

91
00:06:11.356 --> 00:06:13.899
you don't care about not getting fired.

92
00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:16.604
Spotify API, that's a fun one.

93
00:06:16.604 --> 00:06:21.020
I've actually been seeing this
one been put in usage a lot.

94
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.779
So that's something that's actually
popular out there in the market.

95
00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:32.220
So I'll definitely be sharing this
one with on my slides, add to that.

96
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.337
But those are those are tools
that you really need to know.

97
00:06:37.337 --> 00:06:44.910
Serverless technologies, AWS free tier,
get that Google Cloud, Firebase.

98
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:50.578
Use those, basically is a cloud
computing execution model,

99
00:06:50.578 --> 00:06:55.706
the whole joke that,
there's no such thing as a cloud.

100
00:06:55.706 --> 00:06:56.974
It's another person server.

101
00:06:56.974 --> 00:07:00.952
While that may be true,
being able to use these platforms and

102
00:07:00.952 --> 00:07:06.106
use these technologies will set you
apart from other entry level developers.

103
00:07:06.106 --> 00:07:10.406
My favorite website right now on
the market for front end devs,

104
00:07:10.406 --> 00:07:13.989
that's absolutely free
that shows all this stuff.

105
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.740
Right here, serverless.CSStricks.com.

106
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.000
Chris Coyier has made a amazing website

107
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.810
that showcases all the tools that you
can use, some resources and ideas for

108
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:36.950
projects to build serverless things,
right?

109
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.985
You want to be able to showcase
that you have that understanding,

110
00:07:39.985 --> 00:07:43.293
that logic, because that's where
the market is going, the markets,

111
00:07:43.293 --> 00:07:45.072
everything's gonna be serverless.

112
00:07:45.072 --> 00:07:50.446
Everybody is serving their data and
storing the data somewhere else,

113
00:07:50.446 --> 00:07:55.743
be at a CDN like Cloudflare, or
AWS, or Google Cloud, or Firebase.

114
00:07:55.743 --> 00:08:02.880
Everyone is storing their stuff elsewhere
versus on an old school data warehouse.

115
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.840
Except maybe Facebook,
they still have those things,

116
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:11.310
so but they're Facebook, so.

117
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:17.910
But yeah, so these are the things that
will add firepower to your resume,

118
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:21.785
to your skill set, to those
conversations that you go to meetups.

119
00:08:21.785 --> 00:08:25.614
Virtual meetups on Twitter, like in Slack,

120
00:08:25.614 --> 00:08:29.945
these are the things that
if you add to your basics,

121
00:08:29.945 --> 00:08:33.598
they're going to help you stand out more.

122
00:08:33.598 --> 00:08:38.248
Deeper or
even a surface level understanding of

123
00:08:38.248 --> 00:08:42.781
these will put you ahead
of your competition,

124
00:08:42.781 --> 00:08:49.772
other people that you're going to be
competing with in the job market.

125
00:08:49.772 --> 00:08:55.870
This is something that we go over
each one of these and deeper dives.

126
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.960
I definitely recommend you to
go through these as well because

127
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.690
that's how you set yourself apart.

128
00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.444
FEM, Frontend Masters,
they are always ahead of the game.

129
00:09:07.444 --> 00:09:09.447
They have several of this
course coming out, so

130
00:09:09.447 --> 00:09:11.260
you guys definitely wanna check that out.
