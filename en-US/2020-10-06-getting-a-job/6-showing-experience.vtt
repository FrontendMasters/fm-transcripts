WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.620
So now,
we're talking about experience, right?

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:10.740
So that's the most important part
as a front end and as a programmer.

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.100
That's what trumps whatever college you
went to, whether you're self taught or

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.340
not, or whether you went to a boot camp or
anything like that.

5
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.960
So the boot camper problem is you're
gonna talk about the product.

6
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.615
We tend to talk about the projects, but

7
00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:36.294
you don't really talk about what
you learned or what was the impact.

8
00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:38.903
So we're gonna go through
an exercise right now,

9
00:00:38.903 --> 00:00:42.640
in which after I go through this,
I'll give you guys some time to do it.

10
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.720
I'm gonna show you guys how to write for
experience.

11
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.790
So let's say it was a boot camper.

12
00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:55.470
Let's say I would write here,

13
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.280
I will put, so
this is what I was immersed in, right?

14
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.136
So I'm gonna put General Assembly.

15
00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:11.219
I spelled that wrong, make sure,

16
00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:20.071
Assembly just spell, now assembly,

17
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:27.230
colon, Web developer,

18
00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:35.215
Try and hit preset,

19
00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:42.845
And let's see, So

20
00:01:42.845 --> 00:01:46.565
we will focus on our problem solving and
working alone on parts of it, right?

21
00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:51.076
So how to find the solution
of the problem, right?

22
00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:53.179
So focus on building projects.

23
00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.755
Let's see, I'll use get,

24
00:02:05.112 --> 00:02:09.726
Various workflows and

25
00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:17.738
how to quickly pick up technologies and

26
00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:24.550
adapt them to our goals, right?

27
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.410
Cuz that's what they really wanna know,
right?

28
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.590
Cuz all the boot camps pretty
much now teach the same thing,

29
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.031
unless they're a city style boot camp,
right?

30
00:02:34.031 --> 00:02:38.955
If you're in a region that's heavy
in .NET, they'll teach .NET for

31
00:02:38.955 --> 00:02:40.606
the boot camp, right?

32
00:02:40.606 --> 00:02:45.866
But for the most part,
they all teach either full stack MERN,

33
00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:50.230
full stack MEAN or
JavaScript and Python, right?

34
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.756
So that's what it is, they wanna know
is the things we learned, the heart,

35
00:02:54.756 --> 00:02:58.180
what you learned that people
don't talk about, right?

36
00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.880
They can look at that and see, right?

37
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.689
So I'm talking about how I learned
how to use Git, how to use workflows,

38
00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.602
how to quickly pick up on various
technologies, multiple technologies,

39
00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:16.015
Building multiple projects and

40
00:03:16.015 --> 00:03:21.131
learning how to work as a unit on tight

41
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:29.240
deadlines without constant
guidance from instructors.

42
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.658
So what I'm saying is,
I focus on building multiple things and

43
00:03:32.658 --> 00:03:35.507
learning how to work as
a unit on a tech team, right?

44
00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:42.450
Or yeah, let's use unit, cuz I'm military,
I use unit, but tech team.

45
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.782
There you go, as a tech team with

46
00:03:46.782 --> 00:03:51.940
tight deadlines without constant
guidance from instructors.

47
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.820
So it's kind of this idea like
the instructor is a manager and

48
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.104
your tech team is working
without bothering them.

49
00:03:59.104 --> 00:04:02.508
They're meeting the metrics of the manager
without bothering them too much, right?

50
00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:06.668
We'll understand how to use get various
workflows and how to quickly pick up

51
00:04:06.668 --> 00:04:09.985
multiple technologies and
adapt them to our goals, right?

52
00:04:09.985 --> 00:04:14.881
So to showcase that I was in a constant
learning phase and always building stuff,

53
00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:15.670
right?

54
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.480
So let's talk about job experience
that has absolutely nothing to do

55
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.830
with my web developer stuff, right?

56
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:32.088
So I'm gonna put US, Air Force,
because that was my first job, right?

57
00:04:32.088 --> 00:04:39.270
And I will put, it was 2004 to 2010,

58
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.704
so US Air Force, 2004 to 2010.

59
00:04:45.704 --> 00:04:49.380
I was security forces, so

60
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.480
what does that have to do with tech?

61
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.030
So this is what I do when I follow
this protocol, I extrapolate or

62
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.380
extract the soft

63
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.840
skills that I got from
the military right here, right?

64
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.928
So I'm talking about how I was,

65
00:05:19.258 --> 00:05:24.332
Worked in a fast paced environment
which is true because doing

66
00:05:24.332 --> 00:05:29.321
gangster stuff with the government is,
well, it's fast.

67
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:34.528
[LAUGH] We're in a fast

68
00:05:34.528 --> 00:05:40.895
paced environment where I

69
00:05:40.895 --> 00:05:46.682
had to rapidly learn and

70
00:05:46.682 --> 00:05:51.599
pick up new skills by

71
00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:57.097
immersing myself into

72
00:05:57.097 --> 00:06:03.770
cultures and other teams,

73
00:06:07.991 --> 00:06:13.267
Took a disciplined approach

74
00:06:13.267 --> 00:06:18.987
to learn multiple languages.

75
00:06:22.396 --> 00:06:27.272
That benefit me,

76
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:39.238
My performance of my duties, all right?

77
00:06:39.238 --> 00:06:43.035
Because I was deployed multiple times.

78
00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:46.762
So this is basically me saying, hey,
I'm accustomed to work in a fast paced,

79
00:06:46.762 --> 00:06:50.383
ever evolving environment,
because that's what technology is, right?

80
00:06:50.383 --> 00:06:55.800
I know that tech moves fast,
military moves fast.

81
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.515
Let me show them I'm already
accustomed to moving fast, right?

82
00:06:58.515 --> 00:06:59.845
Where I had to rapidly learn and

83
00:06:59.845 --> 00:07:02.305
pick up new skills by immersing
myself in a culture change.

84
00:07:02.305 --> 00:07:07.209
Like so he's already accustomed to jumping
in, becoming a part of the team and

85
00:07:07.209 --> 00:07:10.654
devouring everything,
all of our practices and things.

86
00:07:10.654 --> 00:07:12.880
Cuz he had to do that already, right?

87
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.748
Took a disciplined approach, I make sure
I put that in there, disciplined approach

88
00:07:16.748 --> 00:07:20.082
in learning multiple languages to
benefit my performance of my duties.

89
00:07:20.082 --> 00:07:22.225
What was the motivation behind that?

90
00:07:22.225 --> 00:07:25.674
To benefit performance of my duties,
you learn multiple languages,

91
00:07:25.674 --> 00:07:28.018
can you explain to this
disciplined approach?

92
00:07:28.018 --> 00:07:32.563
Yeah, well learn about about
how the Lord's Prayer had all

93
00:07:32.563 --> 00:07:35.443
the words in it that
most language is used.

94
00:07:35.443 --> 00:07:38.766
And I would focus on that to
learn language, things like that,

95
00:07:38.766 --> 00:07:40.460
being able to have that stuff and

96
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.200
converse to actually be able to share
that when I'm in an interview, right?

97
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.900
So that's what I mean by extrapolating or
extracting

98
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.840
the soft skills that you're gonna have
from something out of a job that might

99
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.765
not have the soft skills that you need or
the hard skills that you need, right?

100
00:07:56.765 --> 00:08:00.083
Cuz I didn't touch a computer
at all in the Air Force.

101
00:08:00.083 --> 00:08:04.648
I'm not one of those people that
are behind a desk and pushing numbers,

102
00:08:04.648 --> 00:08:08.163
tapping on my fingers on computers and
keys and stuff.

103
00:08:08.163 --> 00:08:11.815
No, I was outside in the desert,
it was hot, not fun.

104
00:08:11.815 --> 00:08:18.799
It was like Texas times five in
the summer, so it was a big, big nope.

105
00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:24.332
So that's what I had to do when I left
the military, was I had to showcase

106
00:08:24.332 --> 00:08:30.010
the soft skills that I picked up while
in the military to the employer.

107
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:34.130
So thinking like, okay,
this matches what we need here, right?

108
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.200
So mine is collaborative,

109
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.730
someone is accustomed to being fast paced,
uncharted waters regularly.

110
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.650
Someone who's accustomed in
immersing themselves in new things.

111
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:49.050
These are the things that we need here
now, so at least, we know he has that.
