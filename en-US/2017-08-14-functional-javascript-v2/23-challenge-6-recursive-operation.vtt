&gt;&gt; Kyle: I want you tao take
what we've just talked about and

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.150
only what we've talked about,
don't try to get too fancy with it.

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.860
Use those same concepts to refactor
a function that can multiply numbers,

4
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.650
do the same kind of thing.

5
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.560
And I'm gonna recommend that you end up in
that place where you have the three listed

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.690
parameters rather than just the one or
the two.

7
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.220
But usually just there over this
last few slides, to try and

8
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.290
you might even start with the iterative
version if that helps you to then

9
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.020
pair that back down to the recursive.

10
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.860
But try to implement
the multiply function,

11
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.110
the MUL function, in a recursive manner.
