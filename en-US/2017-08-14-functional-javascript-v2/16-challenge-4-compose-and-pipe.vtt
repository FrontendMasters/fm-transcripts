&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So I want you to
practice with exactly that concept.

2
00:00:03.534 --> 00:00:07.040
Exercise 4 asks you to
implement a function,

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.750
you're generating a list
of lottery numbers.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.000
And it asks you to generate that list,

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.410
using the principles of
immutability we just talked about.

6
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.881
And specifically, it asks you to make
sure that that list stay sorted.

7
00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:26.831
So you have to add to the list, but also
sort the array every time you wanna do

8
00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:30.750
that using the principles of the
immutability that we just talked about.

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.760
So we'll take some time to work on
Exercise 4 and we'll come back and

10
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.660
look at that solution.
