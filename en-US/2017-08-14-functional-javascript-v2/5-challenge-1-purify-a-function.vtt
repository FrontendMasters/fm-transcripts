&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So I want you to
practice with those two techniques.

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.532
Exercise one gives you an impure function.

3
00:00:06.532 --> 00:00:09.470
First step, make a wrapper around it.

4
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.560
Make a bar wrapper around the impure food
that contains all of the side effects.

5
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.110
It passes in any context it needs.

6
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.238
Captures any outputs,
returns the outputs that are necessary.

7
00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:25.332
Here's a hint,
if you need to return multiple outputs,

8
00:00:25.332 --> 00:00:29.720
which you will, a nice, convenient way of
doing that is return them as an array.
