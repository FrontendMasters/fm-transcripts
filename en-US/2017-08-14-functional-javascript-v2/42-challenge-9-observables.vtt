&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So I wanted to give
you a very brief opportunity to

2
00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:03.628
practice with it.

3
00:00:03.628 --> 00:00:07.688
You don't actually need to
do any real RX programming.

4
00:00:07.688 --> 00:00:09.440
But in EXERCISE 9,

5
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.431
you need to do the functional
programming part attached to the list.

6
00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:19.074
So if you open up the Read Me,
you'll see that it says,

7
00:00:19.074 --> 00:00:23.365
there's the fix solution works but
the exercise does not work.

8
00:00:23.365 --> 00:00:26.406
And it gives you very specifically
what you need to add in.

9
00:00:26.406 --> 00:00:30.628
You need to implement a function and
then adapt it to the stream.

10
00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:34.766
So we'll give you probably a few
minutes to try your hand at that.

11
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:37.562
It's really actually only about two or
three lines of code, so

12
00:00:37.562 --> 00:00:38.894
there's not a lot to do here.

13
00:00:38.894 --> 00:00:41.887
Well I'll give you a few minutes to
familiarize yourself with that and

14
00:00:41.887 --> 00:00:43.570
then we'll talk about that solution.
