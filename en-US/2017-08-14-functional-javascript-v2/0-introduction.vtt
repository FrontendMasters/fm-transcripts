&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: As Mark mentioned,
I've been coming back and

2
00:00:03.144 --> 00:00:06.324
doing a lot of teaching for
Frontend Masters, and

3
00:00:06.324 --> 00:00:10.431
I actually love getting to teach for
this particular platform.

4
00:00:10.431 --> 00:00:15.276
And just as a quick shout-out, because
Mark doesn't sing enough of his own

5
00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:20.438
praises, this is the premier platform for
front-end development and beyond.

6
00:00:20.438 --> 00:00:24.090
And It's the reason why I exclusively
teach through this platform.

7
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.076
If you find my videos on other platforms,

8
00:00:26.076 --> 00:00:29.384
it's because they realized how
great it was from Frontend Masters.

9
00:00:29.384 --> 00:00:31.721
And they begged and
pleaded to license that,

10
00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:34.810
so Frontend Masters really
is the best collection.

11
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.530
For those of you that don't already have
a membership or are contemplating it or

12
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.040
you have a membership, but
maybe your team at work doesn't.

13
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.570
I strongly recommend that you
let them know how important and

14
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.780
how great the teaching is.

15
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.046
There's a ton of fantastic authors
on here, and I am honored and

16
00:00:52.046 --> 00:00:54.596
humbled every time I get
a chance to participate.

17
00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:55.096
So [COUGH]
