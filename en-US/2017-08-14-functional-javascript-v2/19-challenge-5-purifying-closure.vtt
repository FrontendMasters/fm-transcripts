&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Based upon
that knowledge of closure,

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.206
you have a simple exercise
before your exercise 5.

3
00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.010
Actually, it's gonna seem way too simple,

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.380
because it's only a couple
of lines of code to write.

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.904
But as they say, the devil's in the
details, we're gonna spend quite a bit of

6
00:00:14.904 --> 00:00:17.780
time talking about the solution and
some of those implications.

7
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.673
We'll give you just three or four minutes,

8
00:00:19.673 --> 00:00:22.575
because this really is only
a couple of lines of code.

9
00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:25.135
But then we're gonna come back and
talk about that in much more detail.
