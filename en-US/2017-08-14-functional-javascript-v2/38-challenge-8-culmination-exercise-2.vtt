00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.611
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So I want you to
have some practice working with

2
00:00:03.611 --> 00:00:06.527
data structures that aren't just arrays,

3
00:00:06.527 --> 00:00:11.280
and also thinking about how do I make
my code something that I can model?

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.600
And that's EXERCISE 8.

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.152
So before I turn you loose on it,
I wanna set your expectation,

6
00:00:17.152 --> 00:00:19.910
I want you to understand
what we're looking at.

7
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.274
So let me pop up exercise eight for you.

8
00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:34.461
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So first off I want you
to spend a few minutes of this exercise

9
00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:38.140
actually familiarizing yourself
with the stuff that I've provided.

10
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.390
When you open up EX8 you'll notice that
there has been quite a bit already

11
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.630
provided to you.

12
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.550
I provided to you some of our built-in
utilities that we've talked about.

13
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.546
Or when I say built-in, I mean things that
would have been provided by libraries.

14
00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:54.730
I've provided you a curry,
a compose, a pipe, and a binary.

15
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.911
So I've provided those
utilities to you already.

16
00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:59.810
We've already talked about them in this
course, but I just dropped them in so

17
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:00.540
you can use them.

18
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.760
I've provided you down here

19
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.210
several helpers that you don't need
to go ahead and write yourself.

20
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.040
Cuz you already know how to test for
something odd,

21
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.880
you know how to use reduce to
do a summation across a list.

22
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.480
I did that for you with list sum.

23
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.330
So those are the parts I want you
to think about in this exercise.

24
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.320
In this exercise what I want you to
think about is this code that's going

25
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.860
on up here.

26
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.600
What you'll notice is that I
am calling a filter object,

27
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.510
a map object, and a reduce object utility.

28
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.020
So I'm doing a filter, map and
reduce across an object.

29
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.260
We've already implemented map objects so
I'm giving that one to you.

30
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.379
But I want you to implement
filter object and reduce object.

31
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.580
And moreover, once you've done that,
the second part of this exercise,

32
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.290
this is where the rubber
really meets the road.

33
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.670
Those three separate statements that
exist there, you'll notice some things,

34
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.290
there's actually a quite a bit of
not point-free style going on.

35
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.190
There's a bunch of functions that for
example, line seven is a function where we

36
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.510
get that list, and then it immediately
passes in to some other function.

37
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.140
So I want you to use the concepts that
we've talked about throughout this course

38
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.970
like currying, piping,
restricting things with binary.

39
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.340
Those utilities I provided you here,
curry, compose, pipe, and

40
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.170
binary, you need all four of
those to do this exercise.

41
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.500
And I want you to take
the lines 7 through 17, and

42
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.420
I want you to express them
completely point free.

43
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.230
And it's going to be a bit tricky, so
we're gonna give you some time on this,

44
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.970
but I want you to express
this completely point free.

45
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.330
And what I've provided to you in this
file is all that you need to do that.

46
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.087
So that's the spirit of exercise eight,

47
00:02:52.087 --> 00:02:56.270
relays designed to kind of put a cap stone
on everything we've talked today so far.
