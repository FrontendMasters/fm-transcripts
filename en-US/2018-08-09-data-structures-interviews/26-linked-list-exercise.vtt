00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.310
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
the next one is a linked list,

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.280
let's look at the different operations for
a linked list.

3
00:00:09.697 --> 00:00:12.851
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
here's our LinkedList class,

4
00:00:12.851 --> 00:00:16.490
again, we have a storage property.

5
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.043
Again I can put an underscore there,
to say that this is private,

6
00:00:20.043 --> 00:00:23.418
you shouldn't be interacting
with it outside of this class.

7
00:00:23.418 --> 00:00:27.218
And just to clarify on that,
since this is inside of the class,

8
00:00:27.218 --> 00:00:29.550
you can interact with the _storage.

9
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.905
But when you instantiate,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Like this,

10
00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:45.588
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: When you instantiate,

11
00:00:45.588 --> 00:00:52.506
you don't later access storage.

12
00:00:58.428 --> 00:01:01.335
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,
but inside here is fine.

13
00:01:01.335 --> 00:01:06.172
So the expectation is
eventually to do all of these.

14
00:01:06.172 --> 00:01:11.290
But initially, insertion, removal,

15
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.700
and contains would be
the main ones to work on.

16
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.524
But being able to do all kinds of
different things on a linked list is gonna

17
00:01:20.524 --> 00:01:21.509
help you on interviews.

18
00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.260
Because this is one of those ones where
you don't use them in the day-to-day.

19
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.769
And interviewers like
to throw interesting,

20
00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:31.783
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I don't know,

21
00:01:31.783 --> 00:01:36.070
interesting twists on this problem.

22
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:43.465
So some things to think about insertion,
is that it needs to be constant time.

23
00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:49.607
Removal can be constant time,
if you have a reference to the node,

24
00:01:49.607 --> 00:01:55.110
or if you first need to search it,
that's gonna be linear.

25
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.700
So a contains is gonna be
a linear-time operation,

26
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.814
cuz you need to loop
through all of the nodes.

27
00:02:01.814 --> 00:02:04.330
IsHead should be constant time,
IsTail should be constant time.

28
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.045
I'm going to write these two in the notes,
when I am done.
