00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.460
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Further
resources in case you wanted more.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.730
I don't know why I just like this gif,
I think it's cute.

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.700
So we have a couple of things that I
recommend on finding master Brian Holt

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.450
has a computer science
in five hours course.

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.040
And then fundamasters will have upcoming
interview prep course right Mark?

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

7
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.480
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And we also have
some other resources that I like.

8
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.352
I use geeks for geeks a lot,
you'll see that linked.

9
00:00:29.352 --> 00:00:33.730
It's a crowd sourced website with a bunch
of different of data structure algorithms,

10
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.790
interview type questions, and
also you can practice there.

11
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.776
There's this github repo that someone
compiled while they were studying for

12
00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:43.115
an interview, for like a Google interview.

13
00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:48.090
It turned into pretty much like a book of
all kinds of stuff so that's pretty cool.

14
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.150
Cracking the coding interview is
a good one if you like to read.

15
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.170
Here's all the solutions
online which is nice.

16
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.540
They have Java Script solutions as well.

17
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.240
And also some ES5 solutions,
which is cool too.

18
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.790
So if you want to just
do a lot of practice.

19
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.070
So these are more like resources to read,
this is resources to watch and exercises.

20
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.510
And this is just only exercises, so

21
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.040
Leetcode is just a bunch
of random exercises.

22
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.110
Hacker rank is good to use in practice cuz
a lot of companies actually use this for

23
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.610
their interviews and
it has kind of a weird interface.

24
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.730
So, I recommend just trying out some
problems on Hacker Rank before you have to

25
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.610
do it in a high stakes situation, just
because it's a little tough to figure out.

26
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.670
Also, debugging and
hacker rank can be tough, and

27
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.840
they're tracking if you're copying and
pasting and things like that.

28
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.370
So, it's just something to practice with.

29
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.457
These two are pretty cool,
Interviewing.io and Primp,

30
00:01:49.457 --> 00:01:52.103
they're real interview
where you can practice.

31
00:01:52.103 --> 00:01:56.380
So one of them is where you
get interviewed by a peer, and

32
00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.160
then another one is you're actually
getting interviewed by people anonymously.

33
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.480
You are anonymized.

34
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.500
I've never actually done this, but
someone was telling me about and

35
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.450
it sounds so cool.

36
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.940
You are anonymized when you interview,
and if you do well,

37
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.300
it's kind of like a dating app I guess.

38
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.380
If you do well or I guess if the
interviewer is interested in hiring you

39
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.640
then you could figure out where
they work and who they are.

40
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.170
So it's kind of cool
way to get practice and

41
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.136
maybe get introduced
to a cool opportunity.

42
00:02:28.136 --> 00:02:34.973
[SOUND] Okay, thanks everyone.

43
00:02:34.973 --> 00:02:36.090
We made it.

44
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.853
We made it through.

45
00:02:39.372 --> 00:02:44.720
