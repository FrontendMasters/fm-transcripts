00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.070
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,
what else can we do?

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.980
So we removed.

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.590
So is head, this was easy, right?

4
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.128
Return this.head.

5
00:00:14.477 --> 00:00:15.710
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Wait, this is isTail.

6
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.340
Return, so we have a node.

7
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.367
So return node,

8
00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:29.900
if node === this.head.

9
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.730
&gt;&gt; Student: You're just checking
whether it's true or not?

10
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.840
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, like is
the node, the head, is this the tail.

11
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.180
So it's gonna return a boolean.

12
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.160
Yeah.

13
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.630
Contains, so contains is another
one where you would loop through.

14
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.980
So what we could do is.

15
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.700
So we're gonna pass some value against.

16
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.688
So this one we're checking for
a particular value, not a node.

17
00:00:56.688 --> 00:01:00.310
But we would have to loop
through pretty similarly So

18
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.970
I'm gonna copy our remove
tail implementation.

19
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.860
And so we're gonna start at the beginning.

20
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.170
We have our value.

21
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.775
So while current node value is not

22
00:01:13.775 --> 00:01:18.716
equal to our value, keep looping.

23
00:01:26.114 --> 00:01:28.210
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,
and then once we exit.

24
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.062
So, if currentNode.value === value,

25
00:01:33.062 --> 00:01:37.133
actually we could just return this.

26
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.002
So if it equals,
if does equal return true,

27
00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:46.193
if not this will return false.
