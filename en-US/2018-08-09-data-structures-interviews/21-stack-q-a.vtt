00:00:00.773 --> 00:00:03.431
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: When you guys
were implementing this on your own,

2
00:00:03.431 --> 00:00:08.973
what were some pieces that were confusing?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just

3
00:00:08.973 --> 00:00:13.977
how the data was being stored, basically?

4
00:00:13.977 --> 00:00:18.154
So it made sense just to
implement with an array.

5
00:00:18.154 --> 00:00:19.180
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, yeah, yeah,

6
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.099
yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And I was like, well,

7
00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.847
it already works like a stack, [LAUGH].

8
00:00:23.847 --> 00:00:28.520
So as an object, it was the challenge,

9
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.178
the subject.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool,

10
00:00:35.203 --> 00:00:36.547
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Anything else,

11
00:00:36.547 --> 00:00:38.855
any questions, comments?

12
00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:43.264
Things that you feel like you
need to pay attention to when you

13
00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:45.339
implement this on your own,

14
00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.249
that might be confusing later, no?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Maybe a weird side

15
00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.026
questions, line 6, line 7, right?

16
00:00:52.026 --> 00:00:58.390
Using the underscore to denote, hey, don't
access this outside of methods, internal.

17
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.910
I know in Ruby, you can set private
methods, protected methods.

18
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.429
Is there any JavaScript analog to that,
where you can actually physically

19
00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:12.916
lock the process, or is it always, yeah?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's complicated,

20
00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:14.612
I mean, the answer is yes.

21
00:01:14.612 --> 00:01:21.300
There are a lot of ways you can go about
doing it, usually they're a lot of work.

22
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.710
So you can use things like closures,
and then

23
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.860
you can also freeze objects and stuff like
that, so you can't actually change them.

24
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.270
But in general,
it's okay just to do the underscore, and

25
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.684
people will understand that
that is not to be messed with.

26
00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:45.548
Yeah, especially if you're using a class
constructor in this way, you're not gonna

27
00:01:45.548 --> 00:01:50.131
be able to make it private.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Good question.
