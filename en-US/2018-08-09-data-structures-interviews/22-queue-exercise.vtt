00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.846
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then,
we also have the queue prompt.

2
00:00:11.174 --> 00:00:16.315
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And again, same thing,
you can fork this, you can also save this

3
00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:21.190
wherever you want,
whether it's in GitHub or what have you.

4
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.410
So, same thing, so
we have our constructor.

5
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.540
Instead of push we call this enqueue, and

6
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.880
that's just the standard language that
we use when we talk about queues.

7
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.780
So stacks, push pop,
queues, enqueue, dequeue.

8
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.981
So enqueue is gonna add
other value at the end,

9
00:00:41.981 --> 00:00:45.210
dequeue is gonna remove
the value from the front, and

10
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.560
then peek is just going to look at
the next one that would be dequeued.

11
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.643
So peek would for
enqueue return the first and oldest,

12
00:00:53.643 --> 00:00:56.850
for the stack would be the last and
newest.
