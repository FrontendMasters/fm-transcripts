00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.745
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Welcome to a practical
introduction to data structures for

2
00:00:03.745 --> 00:00:04.644
interviews.

3
00:00:04.644 --> 00:00:08.420
This is a part two of a four part series.

4
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.496
We started off with part one,
talking about practical algorithms.

5
00:00:13.496 --> 00:00:18.781
Part two, we're gonna get started with
some introductory data structures,

6
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:23.118
stacks, queues, hash tables,
link list, things like that.

7
00:00:23.118 --> 00:00:27.340
Part three, we're gonna talk about trees.

8
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.099
And part four,
we're gonna go into graphs and

9
00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.079
we're gonna tie those in with part
one with all of our algorithms.

10
00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.765
Great.

11
00:00:35.765 --> 00:00:38.104
And so who am I?

12
00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:41.410
My name is a Bianca, I'm a JavaScript
developer and consultant and

13
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.690
I'm an also an educator.

14
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.876
When I'm not doing coding,
you can find me outside.

15
00:00:49.876 --> 00:00:53.735
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

16
00:00:53.735 --> 00:00:54.312
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I feel like it's

17
00:00:54.312 --> 00:00:56.380
a dating profile or something.

18
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.190
So we're gonna start by
talking a little bit about

19
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.190
the interview process and what you
can expect, and then how this course,

20
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.000
and the other three parts of
this course line up with that.
