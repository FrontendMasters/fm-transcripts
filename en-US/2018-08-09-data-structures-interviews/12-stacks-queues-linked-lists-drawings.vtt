00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.734
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, so

2
00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:05.720
we're back let's take a look at what some
people drew, so this one's from Lyne.

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.854
We have a stack in a queue,

4
00:00:07.854 --> 00:00:13.196
I like the composition of this
photo with the pencils on the side.

5
00:00:15.207 --> 00:00:20.557
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Very good, all right,
very cool, pushing and popping.

6
00:00:22.886 --> 00:00:27.770
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, in queuing and
de-queuing, great, awesome.

7
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.547
Then we have a double link list,
overachiever.

8
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.460
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Very great,
nice, value and pointer,

9
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.917
I like that this one really outlines
that the pointer points to the.

10
00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:46.903
Well, the pointer should
actually point to the whole node,

11
00:00:46.903 --> 00:00:52.400
but yeah,
I'm sure that's what it was representing.

12
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.190
Very cool, we can track head and
tail, we also can track head and

13
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.593
tail, the link list, as well.

14
00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:00.333
Awesome.
