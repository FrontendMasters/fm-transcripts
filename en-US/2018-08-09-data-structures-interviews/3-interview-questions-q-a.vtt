1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Got some
questions from the online chat.

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.015
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Sure.

3
00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:09.189
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: When a company asks,
why should we hire you?

4
00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:10.711
How would you proceed?

5
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:15.531
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: How would I ask that,
how would I personally answer that?

6
00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:18.900
Man, guys you're not supposed
to be interviewing me.

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.516
I think that when you're answering this
question you should be thinking about,

8
00:00:24.516 --> 00:00:26.839
what are your unique strengths?

9
00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.090
And so
that would take some self reflection.

10
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.900
So let me self reflex.

11
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.580
So, I think my unique strengths
are distilling complex problems

12
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.178
into digestible pieces.

13
00:00:37.178 --> 00:00:41.578
And that is important for teaching,
but it's also important for

14
00:00:41.578 --> 00:00:45.658
designing a UI, which is just
an abstraction over a system.

15
00:00:45.658 --> 00:00:49.757
Or even writing my code, which is also,
when I write a function,

16
00:00:49.757 --> 00:00:52.749
that's an abstraction over a system,
right?

17
00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:53.560
There's an input and output.

18
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.120
So I think I do that well,
I have experience doing that.

19
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.270
And also I'm nice, I don't know,
those are some reasons.

20
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.718
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I'd also add one point.

21
00:01:04.718 --> 00:01:08.977
It's also really important if you
show interest in that company,

22
00:01:08.977 --> 00:01:13.590
and the product, and
why you're excited about that product.

23
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.648
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep.

24
00:01:14.648 --> 00:01:17.545
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I feel like a lot of
people are asking you for that.

25
00:01:17.545 --> 00:01:19.279
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I see, yeah.

26
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.320
Why we should hire you, not necessarily
asking you about your strengths, but

27
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.345
asking about, how your strengths
play uniquely to that role?

28
00:01:27.345 --> 00:01:28.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.

29
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.510
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
you can try to remember with a job.

30
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.310
If you're on the phone,
you can always have your job posting up,

31
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.650
your resume up, and
any other notes that you want.

32
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.190
So that you can quickly reference, and

33
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.351
I always do that just so
that I don't get flabbergasted.

34
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:49.270
That was a good question.

35
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.135
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What do you think about the
online resume like stack over developers

36
00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:53.100
for you to [INAUDIBLE]?

37
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.619
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
I call that your web presents.

38
00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.430
What do I think about it?

39
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.210
I think it's super important.

40
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.820
They're gonna Google you at every step
of the way right before they meet with

41
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.970
the interview,
they're gonna look at your LinkedIn.

42
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.268
They might check out your GitHub.

43
00:02:11.268 --> 00:02:12.650
They'll probably have your resume.

44
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.510
So yeah, it's super important.

45
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.410
You wanna make sure that
they're consistent, right?

46
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.970
So if in your resumes it says something
different than your LinkedIn.

47
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.430
It could just be like the way that you're
formatting it, or something like that.

48
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.150
It can confuse people, and you wanna
think about, what is you narrative?

49
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.090
What is your story?

50
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.940
Where did you start?

51
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.220
How did you get to where you are now?

52
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.130
And kinda make sure that,
that lines up correctly,

53
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.320
cuz people trust you and
they feel like you're consistent.

54
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.700
And so, I would just be mindful
of that in your web presence.

55
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.399
Especially old,
old logs that you might have

56
00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:53.103
that might be not really consistent
with your story anymore.

57
00:02:53.103 --> 00:02:58.779
It might be very basic programming stuff,
and maybe you want to down play that,

58
00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:02.940
and maybe you wanna hide that post or
something like that.

59
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.076
So, super important, and
that goes with sort of

60
00:03:08.076 --> 00:03:12.979
the resume application
piece of the process.

61
00:03:16.637 --> 00:03:17.397
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Sure.

62
00:03:19.817 --> 00:03:22.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What do you think about
books like Cracking the Code Interview?

63
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.337
Is that still considered
the best technical resource, or

64
00:03:26.337 --> 00:03:28.437
prepping [CROSSTALK] question?

65
00:03:28.437 --> 00:03:31.080
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, yeah,
I mean, other than Frontend Masters,

66
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.576
I think that Cracking the Coding Interview
is a really good resource.

67
00:03:34.576 --> 00:03:38.520
[LAUGH] Yeah,
I use Cracking the Coding Interview

68
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.430
when I prepare for
these kind of workshops.

69
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.149
Also, when I do my own
interview preparation.

70
00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:50.826
I have a whole list of resources
that I'll send you guys after, but

71
00:03:50.826 --> 00:03:53.926
Cracking the Coding Interview
is one that I recommend.

72
00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:58.732
It's just this huge book, and
it has all the basic computer science

73
00:03:58.732 --> 00:04:04.150
fundamentals that you have learned about,
but maybe never fully learned.

74
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.070
Even if you went to college,
and took that class, and

75
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.250
somehow passed,
you might not fully understand them.

76
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.243
So it really this tells it well,
it's a lot of practice problems

77
00:04:14.243 --> 00:04:19.334
with solutions that are explained and
intuitive hands on stuff.

78
00:04:19.334 --> 00:04:23.700
So, that's nice, it's a nice resource,
some other resources.

79
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.150
So the thing that I wouldn't recommend and
I used to recommend.

80
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.450
Because I first learned data structure
algorithm through taking computer science

81
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:35.120
classes.

82
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.040
Like on books some things like that.

83
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.270
I would recommend my
favorite algorithm textbook.

84
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.420
But I realize that's not realistic and

85
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.710
necessary for people who are just trying
to pass their technical interview.

86
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:57.780
It's a little too academic,
it's a little too, it takes it too far.

87
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.850
When really you just need a basic
understanding of the concept so

88
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.830
then you can apply it to
the different problems.

89
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.300
You don't need to know the name
of particular algorithms, or

90
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.920
things like that.

91
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: If you're in
an on sight interview, and

92
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.530
you're given the question that you
don't know, how do you handle that?

93
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.180
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Well,
you probably will never know it.

94
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.640
So in terms of technical interviews,
well, there are themes,

95
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.220
and I'll talk a little bit about
the themes throughout this class.

96
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.780
That you'll see with particular questions,
but they always have some twist so

97
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.950
it's not about knowing something
ahead of time and memorizing.

98
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.990
It's really about learning the concept,
learning how to solve a problem and

99
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.664
break it down, then knowing the answer.

100
00:05:44.664 --> 00:05:49.720
But if it's not a question
that I can solve,

101
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.910
or I get stuck I think it's
just important to be honest.

102
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.010
So a lot of us when we're in
a interview setting we feel like

103
00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.070
we have to pretend especially if you're
suffering from imposter syndrome

104
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.890
where you feel like everyone else knows
all the stuff and you don't know anything.

105
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.600
And you're just fake and
they're gonna find out any moment,

106
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.540
especially in this on sight interview.

107
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.240
You might feel like you need to pretend
like you know things you don't know.

108
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.890
Don't do that, this whole fake it till
you make it, you can only take that so

109
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:18.410
far, right?

110
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.360
When you get to a technical question,

111
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.570
you can't pretend to know the answer and
you shouldn't just make it up.

112
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:32.580
You can make inferences, so you can say,
if someone says, what is a quad tree?

113
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.730
And you could be like, well I'm not
really sure, I've never done too

114
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.637
much work with quad trees, but
I've done work with binary trees.

115
00:06:42.637 --> 00:06:47.257
And binary trees just a tree which
has two child notes, so maybe,

116
00:06:47.257 --> 00:06:50.449
I could guess, just say it,
just be honest,

117
00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:54.989
that a quad tree is a tree where
a node at most can have four nodes.

118
00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:59.101
You could just but just be open with
it and communicate it, like that,

119
00:06:59.101 --> 00:07:02.180
versus like quad tree,
definitely four children.

120
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.186
And in your head you're, like, God, I
hope they don't ask a follow up question.

121
00:07:06.186 --> 00:07:10.344
[LAUGH] Sure.

122
00:07:10.344 --> 00:07:11.184
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So one thing,

123
00:07:11.184 --> 00:07:16.015
I started with that a little bit is that
sometimes I'll have heard of the concept,

124
00:07:16.015 --> 00:07:20.510
and they''ll be one sentence on it
in lecture or something like that.

125
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.901
And so I'll phrase it to be, like,
yeah, I know what it is, but

126
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:27.476
then I'll just, kind of realize like no,
I don't fully grasp this.

127
00:07:27.476 --> 00:07:32.193
So how do I spin that and make sure that
I'm coming off as authentic like yeah I

128
00:07:32.193 --> 00:07:36.469
know what the concept is, I just
haven't worked with it coming off as

129
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:40.920
inauthentic because I did start it off as,
I know what that is.

130
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.600
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, so do you have a specific example?

131
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.887
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: In one of the interviews
that I had for a book camp, and

132
00:07:51.887 --> 00:07:55.025
I know what it is now, don't worry,

133
00:07:55.025 --> 00:08:00.220
[LAUGH] But they were trying
to communicate stack to me.

134
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.824
And it was kind of like
a recursion question, and

135
00:08:04.824 --> 00:08:10.324
they're like okay, so
why is it that when we put the number

136
00:08:10.324 --> 00:08:16.416
after the call to the function
it's printing it out backwards.

137
00:08:16.416 --> 00:08:19.275
Or whatever the numbers were
going downwards from five and

138
00:08:19.275 --> 00:08:22.050
then afterwards It was
going upwards from five.

139
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.300
And I thought I knew what it was like
I was like yeah, that makes sense and

140
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.370
I tried to talk through it.

141
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:31.398
But then I realized that I
knew what the word was, and

142
00:08:31.398 --> 00:08:38.385
I remembered talking about it in
a lecture, but I couldn't on the spot.

143
00:08:38.385 --> 00:08:42.076
I needed ten minutes to just
gather my thoughts, but obviously,

144
00:08:42.076 --> 00:08:45.550
you don't have that when
you're in front of the person.

145
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.810
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, yeah,
no, that's a good example.

146
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.627
So, I think how I would handle that is

147
00:08:51.627 --> 00:08:58.637
that,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Talk

148
00:08:58.637 --> 00:09:01.430
through your thought process, cuz
that's what they're really looking for.

149
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:07.050
Talk through your thought process when
you hit a speed bump in that process,

150
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:12.700
you can just day maybe that isn't
exactly what I thought it was.

151
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:17.200
And then,
if you identify where your understanding

152
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.370
is different from like whatever
reality is happening in your code.

153
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:25.970
You'd be like I expected to do this,
but it's actually doing that, and

154
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.330
then you could be like I
wonder what would cause that?

155
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:33.104
And then, try to think about it, but

156
00:09:33.104 --> 00:09:38.408
posing that like could help
the interviewer give you a hint.

157
00:09:38.408 --> 00:09:42.740
So going through it, thinking about
saying what you would expect.

158
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.050
Finding out that maybe it
didn't meet your expectations.

159
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.380
This is just like classic debugging,
right?

160
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.059
I expected when I clicked
on this button for

161
00:09:51.059 --> 00:09:55.155
the window to a model,
to pop up but it didn't.

162
00:09:55.155 --> 00:09:58.890
And then you could think okay, what
are the reasons why that didn't happen?

163
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:04.010
Okay, so, we have the click handler,
I'm toggling a class

164
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:08.789
maybe, a display you know like
a hide show kind of class.

165
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.328
Is there an error in the terminal,
maybe it's just my app's broken, and

166
00:10:14.328 --> 00:10:16.334
none of my click handlers are working.

167
00:10:16.334 --> 00:10:23.100
So thinking through what
could be causing that gap,

168
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:28.342
that's how I would handle it, I think.

169
00:10:28.342 --> 00:10:32.554
Yeah, I think it is good to have
these experiences because it makes

170
00:10:32.554 --> 00:10:36.180
you realize like where
are the bounds of your knowledge.

171
00:10:38.614 --> 00:10:47.050
So obviously, in an interview was asked
about different application state models.

172
00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:50.070
And I was like, yeah,
reacting to directional and

173
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:57.170
then he kept asking me question, maybe I
don't actually understand how this works.

174
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.030
And that was really important for
me, because I was like, no,

175
00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:01.830
I really need to study up on this and
really really understand this.

176
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.215
Because it's important to
me that I master my craft.

177
00:11:06.215 --> 00:11:08.527
So,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool,

178
00:11:08.527 --> 00:11:09.270
any more questions?

179
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.103
These are great questions.

180
00:11:11.103 --> 00:11:14.351
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I just have a tiny
comment when I was interviewing,

181
00:11:14.351 --> 00:11:18.520
in the early stages,
I always failed the technical interviews.

182
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.960
Because I didn't understand
the basics of closure and

183
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.594
scope, and the stuff that you teach and
fundamentals to functional, and

184
00:11:26.594 --> 00:11:29.930
also Kyle Simpson Deep
JavaScript Foundations.

185
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:34.925
Like back when front
masters was a side project.

186
00:11:34.925 --> 00:11:38.060
One subject those courses at fully pass

187
00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.579
the technical-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

188
00:11:39.579 --> 00:11:41.451
now you can get any job.

189
00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:42.036
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What's that?

190
00:11:42.036 --> 00:11:43.218
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
now you can get any job.

191
00:11:43.218 --> 00:11:44.965
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Now,
I can get any job [LAUGH].

192
00:11:44.965 --> 00:11:45.618
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH].

193
00:11:45.618 --> 00:11:48.452
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Well obviously,
Frontend Masters worked out so,

194
00:11:48.452 --> 00:11:49.110
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH].

195
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.272
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: But
those two course are for me,

196
00:11:51.272 --> 00:11:55.601
really helped as far as understanding
cuz people will always ask

197
00:11:55.601 --> 00:12:00.436
you what's closure because you're
talking about that kind of thing.

198
00:12:00.436 --> 00:12:02.209
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

199
00:12:02.209 --> 00:12:05.784
Those kind of questions like closure,
prototype inheritance or

200
00:12:05.784 --> 00:12:10.009
language specific questions, that is
a type of question you might be asked.

201
00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:11.901
That is not a data structure or

202
00:12:11.901 --> 00:12:16.457
algorithm one that you can reference
on different Master's courses.

203
00:12:16.457 --> 00:12:19.760
What Mark mentioned,
my JavaScript fundamentals course.

204
00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.980
Also, Kyle Simpsons Deep Foundation
course will cover that.

205
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.350
Some other kinds of questions that
you might need to prepare for

206
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.077
that aren't data structures.

207
00:12:28.077 --> 00:12:31.181
And algorithm specific
are there's some logic and

208
00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:35.950
math ones out there that I don't teach
because I'm not very good at those.

209
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:37.670
And I think they're bad
interview questions, but

210
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.900
sometimes they'll still ask them anyway.

211
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:46.300
Usually have bigger companies
those logic in math questions.

212
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:52.268
There are language specifics then there
is domain more front end back end,

213
00:12:52.268 --> 00:12:55.962
or full stock kind of
questions about sort of,

214
00:12:55.962 --> 00:12:59.955
how a web application in general,
how they work?

215
00:12:59.955 --> 00:13:04.933
How does the Internet work,
and then recursion is more of

216
00:13:04.933 --> 00:13:09.079
a computer science-y question,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: But

217
00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:13.438
it falls under data structures and
algorithms because we use them a lot in

218
00:13:13.438 --> 00:13:16.667
algorithms,and it's a technique for
algorithms.

219
00:13:16.667 --> 00:13:19.785
Cool.

220
00:13:19.785 --> 00:13:22.440
When we talk about that,
if you're interested in recursion and

221
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.920
recursive algorithms.

222
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.720
We talk about that for, I don't know,
how many hours last workshop.

223
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.020
Maybe two or three?

224
00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.720
And we just like recursed all day.

225
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.440
We won't be doing too much for
recursion today, so
