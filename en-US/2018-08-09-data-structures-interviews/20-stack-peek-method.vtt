00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.960
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, so
like I was saying before,

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.290
a peek is really similar to pop.

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.130
For a stack, we wanna peek the last one.

4
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.830
For the queue,
you always peek the first one.

5
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.164
So we wanna return the last
newest value without removing it.

6
00:00:15.164 --> 00:00:18.370
So it's really similar to this, so
I'm just gonna copy this logic.

7
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'm just removing line 27,
28.

8
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.986
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep,
and just remove the delete.

9
00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.690
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And the length change.

10
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:34.863
And really,
we could just return that and be happy.

11
00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:38.029
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep?

12
00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:40.149
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can I see
the constructor up there again?

13
00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:40.909
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

14
00:00:47.426 --> 00:00:52.654
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And also, if you
wanted to give access to your length,

15
00:00:52.654 --> 00:00:54.479
you could do that.

16
00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.879
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: But I would
probably do something like get length.

17
00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.428
Like a method that gets the link or

18
00:01:03.428 --> 00:01:08.437
something versus,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Accessing

19
00:01:08.437 --> 00:01:09.740
the length directly.

20
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.510
Cuz you don't want anyone to
set the length on accident or

21
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.946
think that they have to.

22
00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:21.448
So it would just be like get length and

23
00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:24.890
it would be a function that would just
return this to underscore length.

24
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.234
There would never be a set length so
people can never change the length

25
00:01:30.234 --> 00:01:35.595
cuz if someone changes the length
then that messes everything else.

26
00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:38.435
Which is why I have the underscore there.
