00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.336
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
what are we gonna cover today?

2
00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:07.140
So we're gonna talk about
the background of each data structure,

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.200
each of these data
structures listed below.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.370
We're going to talk about how
we use them in real life.

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.690
How we're gonna implement them.

6
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.760
We're gonna analyze them.

7
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.215
And then, I hope that you guys gain
experience and intuition through

8
00:00:20.215 --> 00:00:24.219
practicing with just some classic problems
related to these data structures.

9
00:00:28.556 --> 00:00:31.920
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, so
how to succeed, how to be effective.

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.736
Like I mentioned earlier,
don't memorize, it's not gonna help you.

11
00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:39.677
But learn the overall concepts and
think about how you're gonna apply them.

12
00:00:39.677 --> 00:00:41.640
Keep these tools in your belt.

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.185
But be able to adapt them to
the various problems that

14
00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:49.400
maybe thrown at you in an interview.

15
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.506
You wanna find themes, but
don't jump to conclusions.

16
00:00:52.506 --> 00:00:55.981
This is important,
once you start having that intuition,

17
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:58.285
do not let your assumptions take over.

18
00:00:58.285 --> 00:01:01.762
Once you start to have an assumption,
clarify with your interviewer and

19
00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:03.990
that is totally fine,
but don't run with it.

20
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.155
If it seems like a good way to solve
a problem is with a stack, say that,

21
00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:14.958
don't just keep it to yourself, cuz it
might not actually be what you expect.

22
00:01:17.193 --> 00:01:20.089
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Rule #3 is practice
with a timer because speed matters.

23
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.620
Most people, when they go
through the interview process,

24
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.250
they don't do well the technical portion.

25
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.840
Not because they don't know the theory and
the analysis, but

26
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.470
because they aren't able to solve
the problems in enough time.

27
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.670
So they would have arrived at an answer,
but it just took them a long time.

28
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.748
So practicing a lot in getting fast
is really important to get through,

29
00:01:45.748 --> 00:01:48.379
even just the initial phone screen.

30
00:01:51.518 --> 00:01:54.618
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And so,
you wanna be able to solve these problems.

31
00:01:54.618 --> 00:01:59.791
Some of them are longer than others,
but typically, like, 30 minutes.

32
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:04.060
You wanna able to, or even like some
of these, like 20, 10 to 20 minutes.

33
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.981
Some of them are very like
entry level problems, but

34
00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:09.190
you wanna try to do it as fast as you can.

35
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.830
Next point, actually, practice.

36
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.360
Reading does not count,
reading the solution does not count as

37
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.050
actually practicing because
that's the memorization piece.

38
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.870
It is not the, have a tool and
adapt it, technique.

39
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.967
So you can read the solutions and
go through them, but

40
00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:38.096
it doesn't replace actually,
struggling through a problem.

41
00:02:38.096 --> 00:02:42.263
I recently took an interview prep class,
and

42
00:02:42.263 --> 00:02:47.097
they said to struggle for
two hours before looking.

43
00:02:47.097 --> 00:02:49.220
But that's pretty brutal,
I don't know if I recommend that.

44
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.572
But that was their recommendation,
like struggle for two hours and

45
00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:57.324
then ask for help, and
then look at the solutions online.

46
00:02:57.324 --> 00:03:03.070
So every common interview question has
a solution online, it's out there.

47
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.106
And last but probably the most important,
make sure you communicate really well,

48
00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:14.290
and that you're nice
throughout the whole time.

49
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.000
Even if you're frustrated, even if it's
not going well, even if you don't know,

50
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.910
communicate, be polite,
it'll get you a long way.
