00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.790
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I get a lot of
questions about at particular steps of

2
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.830
an interview, why people bomb,

3
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.780
and also a lot of people
don't know why they bombed.

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.040
A lot of times you won't
get that feedback, right?

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.310
There are a lot of reasons for that,

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.410
maybe the recruiter is busy,
maybe it's a liability thing.

7
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.120
So you may not get
the feedback that you want

8
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.310
when you're dropped off
at a particular step.

9
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.531
So let's talk about each step, so the
resume, looking for relevant experience.

10
00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:36.549
Why that might not have gotten through is
maybe you're not highlighting the relevant

11
00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:37.230
experience.

12
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.450
So think about what particular, and
this can be hard if this is your first

13
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.000
software engineering job, to find out
which experiences are the most relevant.

14
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.180
So you can work with a friend or a mentor
to kind of draw out those tidbits.

15
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.590
Say like you worked in a retail job,
maybe you could draw out some

16
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.918
sort of data analytics piece,
and maybe you did some inventory.

17
00:01:02.918 --> 00:01:05.541
Or you could kind of just, even though
that's not what you did all day,

18
00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:06.166
you did do that.

19
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:10.119
Or maybe you did some sort of
something a little more leadershipy,

20
00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.541
where you got an award.

21
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:15.610
So you just draw those pieces, and
I can highlight your relevant experience.

22
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.010
So if you don't have technical experience,
think about, okay, what do I have in my

23
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.790
experience that is roughly technical or
shows that I am some sort of over achiever

24
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.580
or a leader in some way?

25
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.030
Also grammar, if you have grammar problems
in your resume, that's gonna be an issue.

26
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.270
So the coding challenge,
maybe your code wasn't clean.

27
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.468
Maybe you didn't understand
the problem correctly, so

28
00:01:45.468 --> 00:01:46.666
you solved the wrong problem.

29
00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:49.556
This happens a lot,
where people have assumptions about, so

30
00:01:49.556 --> 00:01:53.070
you see a lot of the same problems,
same challenges, over and over again.

31
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.928
And so you start to form an intuition and
assumption about what they're asking.

32
00:01:56.928 --> 00:01:59.200
However, this can really,

33
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.508
really come back to haunt you when
you just jumped to a conclusion.

34
00:02:04.508 --> 00:02:09.307
You're not actually fully understanding
what the problem is that you're solving,

35
00:02:09.307 --> 00:02:11.650
so you're solving a different problem.

36
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.380
And so that's the correctness, right?

37
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.492
You're solving the wrong problem,
it's incorrect.

38
00:02:21.317 --> 00:02:22.301
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So the recruiter

39
00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:27.075
phone screen,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's probably

40
00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:30.152
unlikely, if you get
a recruiter phone screen,

41
00:02:30.152 --> 00:02:34.967
it's unlikely that you won't,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's unlikely that

42
00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:37.050
you will move forward.

43
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.290
As long as you seem excited and polite

44
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.230
and you have relevant experience
that you can talk about.

45
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.932
So if you don't do those things,
that's probably a reason why you bombed.

46
00:02:52.932 --> 00:02:56.572
Maybe you don't have the relevant
experience needed for a particular role,

47
00:02:56.572 --> 00:02:58.426
and that wasn't clear on your resume.

48
00:02:58.426 --> 00:03:04.010
Maybe you offended your
interviewer on accident.

49
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.080
Things like that can be
a reason that you fail.

50
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.860
But typically, the recruiter phone
screen is just to see if you're nice,

51
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.530
if you have relevant experience.

52
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.439
They're not technical, so
it's not a technical issue,

53
00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.327
it's more of a marketing yourself issue.

54
00:03:18.327 --> 00:03:23.770
Similar with the resume,
marketing yourself appropriately.

55
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.710
And then the technical phone screen,
this is where this course and

56
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.530
the future courses and
the last course come in.

57
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.019
And reasons why you bombed is you didn't
know all your basic data structures and

58
00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.500
algorithms.

59
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.810
Not that you even really need
them on the job most of the time.

60
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.650
However, it shows that you didn't prepare,
right?

61
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.968
If you didn't study a linked list and
you go into an interview,

62
00:03:47.968 --> 00:03:49.210
they ask you about a linked list.

63
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.225
You can't just say, well we don't
really use linked lists in React or

64
00:03:54.225 --> 00:03:56.710
whatever you may be doing.

65
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.960
It just shows that you're not dedicated,

66
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.960
you're not cramming the night before
with your cracking the coding interview.

67
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.830
Trying to figure out what
a linked list is again.

68
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.090
So maybe they asked you
about a project and

69
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.350
you weren't able to articulate
your contribution on it.

70
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.848
So that's like a flag that you might
be lying on your resume, so be careful.

71
00:04:22.848 --> 00:04:26.694
So any bullet you have on your resume,
make sure that you're able to discuss it.

72
00:04:26.694 --> 00:04:31.351
At least one thing about it,
like a challenge you had, or

73
00:04:31.351 --> 00:04:37.580
an interesting thing, or just the
specifics of how you went about doing it.

74
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.340
Like what libraries you may have used,
and maybe even why would be great.

75
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.602
So similar skills needed for
the onsite interview,

76
00:04:47.602 --> 00:04:50.030
except with more perseverance, right?

77
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.987
So reasons you might have bombed this
one is, maybe you stayed up too late and

78
00:04:54.987 --> 00:04:58.720
you're really tired,
by the end of it you got burnt out.

79
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.485
Again, your data structures in algorithms,
you won't personable,

80
00:05:04.485 --> 00:05:07.513
you didn't communicate well
during your interview.

81
00:05:07.513 --> 00:05:12.585
So maybe you got stuck, and instead of
talking through why you were stuck,

82
00:05:12.585 --> 00:05:16.370
you just stared at the white board and
just blanked.

83
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.976
Instead of communicating, like hm, I was
thinking of going down this route, but

84
00:05:20.976 --> 00:05:25.380
now I'm seeing that maybe we
can't do that because of x, y, z.

85
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.800
So I'm just gonna take a moment and
think about what other options I have.

86
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.610
So this is showing,

87
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.890
this isn't just you just like,
deer in the headlights like this.

88
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.634
Your communicating clearly, it shows
that you're able to collaborate well,

89
00:05:39.634 --> 00:05:40.852
even in a hard time.

90
00:05:40.852 --> 00:05:45.140
It gives your interviewer an opportunity
to give you a hint as well.

91
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.500
So those are some reasons that you bombed
and some skills that you may need.

92
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.551
Kind of my brain dump to you.

93
00:06:01.183 --> 00:06:05.817
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, and if you
ever get frustrated, that's a red flag,

94
00:06:05.817 --> 00:06:09.350
so be mindful of your
emotional regulation.

95
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.859
Especially, it's a high pressure
environment, just so you know,

96
00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:17.024
you don't wanna get frustrated.
