00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.030
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
what to expect is, step one

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.202
is really submitting your resume or
application, no surprise here.

3
00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:13.163
You're gonna either do that by emailing
someone, talking to someone in person and

4
00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:16.741
then emailing them your resume, or
applying through some online portal.

5
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:21.234
Or maybe even using some platform
like Hire.com or Triplebyte,

6
00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:26.310
which has a hybrid model where you set
up a profile and companies seek you.

7
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.735
The next step may or
may not happen at the very first step, but

8
00:00:31.735 --> 00:00:36.700
it could happen throughout any step of the
process, which is the coding challenge.

9
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.049
And this doesn't happen for all companies,
but it seems to be getting more and

10
00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:41.200
more popular.

11
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.261
So the coding challenge can be
a HackerRank test, where you're timed and

12
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:50.589
you're solving data structures and
algorithms problems, or

13
00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.322
some multiple choice kind of questions,
so sort of trivia related to

14
00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:59.916
whatever your domain expertise
may be that you're applying for.

15
00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:02.765
It could be to write an app from scratch.

16
00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:03.993
Usually they're pretty simple,
like a to-do app or

17
00:01:03.993 --> 00:01:05.096
something like that with
no data persistence.

18
00:01:05.096 --> 00:01:11.000
Or they'll give you a demo app and
you're supposed to implement

19
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.621
a future in this app that's already made.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The next

20
00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:18.625
step is recruiter phone screen.

21
00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:23.608
This is more kind of, I get to know you,

22
00:01:23.608 --> 00:01:26.480
it's very friendly.

23
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.079
The recruiter is gonna spend time
marketing the company to you,

24
00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.489
why it's a great place to work,
what their culture is like.

25
00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:38.230
So this is a pretty easy step
in terms of technical interview,

26
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.516
in terms of the whole process, but
you do need to take it seriously and

27
00:01:43.516 --> 00:01:46.340
you still need to research for it.

28
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.830
Research about the company and
have questions to ask, things like that.

29
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.916
Then there's the technical phone screen,
this is usually

30
00:01:54.916 --> 00:02:00.012
where you're typing in a Collabedit or
even a Google Docs.

31
00:02:00.012 --> 00:02:03.896
So you're gonna be coding in an odd
environment, and you'll be answering often

32
00:02:03.896 --> 00:02:07.723
data structures and algorithms questions,
general questions about your past

33
00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:12.140
projects, your experience, technologies
that you've worked with, things like that.

34
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.290
And the very final step, sometimes
there'll be one technical phone screen,

35
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.700
sometimes there'll be two, it depends
on the company that you're working for.

36
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.100
Sometimes the coding challenge comes
after the technical screen, or

37
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.150
sometimes the coding challenge comes
before the technical screen and

38
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.094
then you talk about your implementation
with your phone interviewer.

39
00:02:33.094 --> 00:02:37.960
The onsite interview,
these are pretty much a whole day affair.

40
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.162
I've seen them be broken
up into two half days, but

41
00:02:41.162 --> 00:02:46.314
generally you can expect four to six hours
of interviews for an on site interview.

42
00:02:46.314 --> 00:02:48.036
If you're out of town, they'll fly you in.

43
00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:49.284
They usually pay for your hotel and

44
00:02:49.284 --> 00:02:54.860
things like that.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

45
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.117
so it's similar to the technical screen,
where they're gonna be asking you to

46
00:02:59.117 --> 00:03:02.690
talk about your past projects,
your specific domain knowledge.

47
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.037
So if you're doing a front-end,
you're applying for a front-end role,

48
00:03:06.037 --> 00:03:08.560
you're going to be asked
questions probably about CSS.

49
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.720
Or if you have a framework on your resume,
like React or Angular,

50
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.065
expect questions about that.

51
00:03:13.065 --> 00:03:15.610
Trade-offs that you would make, and

52
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.000
examples of things that you've
made with those technologies.

53
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.550
And then also you'll be doing
likely data structures and

54
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.454
algorithms type questions, especially
if you're applying to a bigger company.

55
00:03:28.454 --> 00:03:32.510
Smaller startups tend to err on
the side of less data structures and

56
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.880
algorithms, and then larger companies
tend to rely more heavily on them.

57
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.980
So what that means for you is,
if you're applying to one of the larger

58
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.360
tech companies, really really drill on
those data structures and algorithms,

59
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.006
especially if you are a new grad or this
is your first job as a software engineer.

60
00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:55.430
They're likely gonna be more focused on
the problem solving data structures and

61
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.790
algorithms versus deep domain knowledge.

62
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.810
So new grad rules, internships, things
like that, more data structure-centric,

63
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.540
bigger companies even more
data structure-centric.

64
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.372
Startups aren't that worried about data
structures, but they should ask you

65
00:04:12.372 --> 00:04:16.999
some coding challenge type questions
that might rely on a data structure.

66
00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:21.171
And so you do need to do some
preparation for that, but

67
00:04:21.171 --> 00:04:26.290
I would focus more on showing that
you can hit the ground running.

68
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.650
Often startups don't have the resources
to invest in training you, and so they're

69
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.410
really just trying to see if you can come
in, be independent, wear multiple hats.

70
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.780
These are small startups, there's also
larger startups that have more resources,

71
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.270
so kind of think about this in a range,
it's not a black or

72
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.120
white type of statement.

73
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.850
What do you think is gonna be the most

74
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.940
challenging aspect of the process?

75
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Onsite interview.

76
00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.630
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Bear with

77
00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.170
me.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

78
00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.713
yeah, no problem.

79
00:04:59.713 --> 00:05:02.873
Onsite interview, why is that?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well,

80
00:05:02.873 --> 00:05:07.057
cuz you have the actual
knowledge factors involved, but

81
00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:11.170
you also have the psychological,
emotional factors.

82
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.950
That's also gonna put pressure on your
thought process and how you analyze and

83
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.150
break a problem down, versus if you
were just hanging at some place,

84
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.840
that comfortable zone that
you're [INAUDIBLE] thinking.

85
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.517
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, and

86
00:05:24.517 --> 00:05:25.650
also it's long.

87
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.018
Right, multiple hours of being grilled,

88
00:05:28.018 --> 00:05:29.930
yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: For me,

89
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.170
it's anything on the phone.

90
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.930
So just based on your layout, technical
phone screen would be terrifying,

91
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.210
because you can't read the cues, right?

92
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.742
And then so it feels almost like you can't
make a personal connection, right, and

93
00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:43.620
they're throwing these questions at you.

94
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.190
So that for

95
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.505
me is definitely the scariest part.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Hm, yeah.

96
00:05:46.505 --> 00:05:47.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Because I think

97
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.835
by the time they bring you on site
they've already kind of invested, and

98
00:05:49.835 --> 00:05:51.503
they've vetted you enough to bring you in.

99
00:05:51.503 --> 00:05:53.736
It's almost like they
don't want you to fail

100
00:05:53.736 --> 00:05:55.000
at that point.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

101
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: But I think anything leading

102
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.430
up to that is just elimination game.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, totally.

103
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.370
And another thing I forgot to mention when
I talked about technical phone screens is,

104
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.980
sometimes they're just high level
questions about your domain expertise.

105
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.280
So I've had technical interviews where
there was no coding involved at all,

106
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.630
just compare and
contrast different frameworks,

107
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.990
talking about data flow
through your application,

108
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.090
and how would you setup the project for
the first time, these kinds of questions.

109
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.590
That happened to me once, so
I wanted to mention that.

110
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.150
Okay, so that's what to expect.

111
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.430
So how do you overachieve at each step?

112
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.630
So for the resume application piece,
get a recommendation.

113
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.860
If you can, hopefully you can find someone
who you know, a friend of a friend,

114
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.770
especially someone you used to work with,
and get a recommendation that way.

115
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.564
If not, it's better than nothing
just to meet someone on LinkedIn,

116
00:06:55.564 --> 00:06:59.220
ask for a conversation, meet for coffee,
and ask for a recommendation that way.

117
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.880
This works especially if you're
part of the same network, so

118
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.530
if you went to a coding bootcamp or

119
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.860
something like that you can ask
someone who went to your same school.

120
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.110
Or if you want to college, there's
sorority or fraternity kind of groups.

121
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.650
These are kind of networks you
can pull from and contact.

122
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:23.138
Or you could just cold call,
and see what you can, you know?

123
00:07:23.138 --> 00:07:26.427
It never hurts to ask.

124
00:07:26.427 --> 00:07:29.106
And then, for the coding challenge,

125
00:07:29.106 --> 00:07:33.470
what they're really looking for,
is clean, correct code.

126
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:38.995
So you wanna make sure that your
indentation is correct, all your brackets,

127
00:07:38.995 --> 00:07:43.758
or all of your semicolons,
are inserted, if you use semicolons.

128
00:07:43.758 --> 00:07:47.830
That you're being modular,
you're breaking your functions up into

129
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.466
the smallest possible components in
a reasonable way without going too crazy.

130
00:07:52.466 --> 00:07:54.157
Especially with time constraints,

131
00:07:54.157 --> 00:07:56.289
you might not have time
to go too crazy with it.

132
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.500
And then once you get to the, mm-hm?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So it may be kind of a weird

133
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.320
question, but do you find it's worth it to
bring in a linter on coding challenges,

134
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.730
just to enforce that, or do you feel then
they look at it and, they're cheating?

135
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:10.610
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Well, it depends.

136
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.852
So some coding challenges are on

137
00:08:14.852 --> 00:08:19.565
a platform like HackerRank, and so

138
00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:25.233
I don't believe HackerRank has a linter.

139
00:08:25.233 --> 00:08:26.583
But if you're pulling in a code
from GitHub, for example,

140
00:08:26.583 --> 00:08:28.292
you should just have a linter set up
in your editor and just use that, yeah.

141
00:08:28.292 --> 00:08:33.095
Yeah, but there

142
00:08:33.095 --> 00:08:38.932
might be an online,

143
00:08:43.518 --> 00:08:44.390
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: There might be an app

144
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.230
where you can paste in code and
it lints it for you, I'm not sure.

145
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:51.380
I usually just do it locally,
but yeah, that's a good question.

146
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:57.290
There's the other thing, as HackerRank
will track whether you copy and paste

147
00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:03.990
stuff, and they gauge if they think that
you're plagiarizing, and things like that.

148
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.220
So I would just be careful with
copying and pasting inside and

149
00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.638
outside of the HackerRank
platform in particular.

150
00:09:09.638 --> 00:09:15.249
The other ones, I'm not as familiar with.

151
00:09:15.249 --> 00:09:18.313
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,

152
00:09:18.313 --> 00:09:21.157
recruiter phone screen.

153
00:09:21.157 --> 00:09:25.603
So they wanna just make sure that
you're gonna fit in with the team,

154
00:09:25.603 --> 00:09:30.907
that you seem like a nice person, and that
you have reasonable reasons for why you

155
00:09:30.907 --> 00:09:36.740
are leaving your company and why you're
interested in their particular company.

156
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:40.113
So, how do you overachieve for this?

157
00:09:40.113 --> 00:09:44.471
Read their engineering blog if they have
one, know about what's going on with

158
00:09:44.471 --> 00:09:48.910
the company, just quick Google search,
find out news and ask them about that.

159
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:52.960
So it just shows that you're engaged and
you're interested in what they do.

160
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:59.390
Technical phone screen,
they're just looking for

161
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.800
your technical ability and also fit.

162
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.992
When I say fit, basically what
that means is, do they like you?

163
00:10:05.992 --> 00:10:08.040
Would they enjoy working with you?

164
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.550
And do they think the other people on
their team are also gonna enjoy working

165
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.201
with you?

166
00:10:13.201 --> 00:10:16.197
And so they're gonna be
gauging that throughout, so

167
00:10:16.197 --> 00:10:18.870
communication is key
throughout the process.

168
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:23.751
Don't be silent if you could help it,
and be confident, and

169
00:10:23.751 --> 00:10:27.620
be nice, and ask them how they're doing.

170
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.750
If it's a Monday,
maybe ask them how their weekend was.

171
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:36.940
Just normal things like that
can make you come off as more

172
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:42.120
sociable, more of a fit than
not doing those things.

173
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:48.143
Onsite interview is really similar, so
more data structure and algorithms.

174
00:10:48.143 --> 00:10:52.070
Tends to be a little bit harder than
the phone screen, depends on the company.

175
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.365
Some companies their phone screen,

176
00:10:54.365 --> 00:10:59.252
technical challenge is just to kind of
check if you can code kind of challenge,

177
00:10:59.252 --> 00:11:04.680
so it'll be a Fizz-Buzz where you're just
looping and you're printing things out.

178
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.164
But more and more I'm seeing the technical
phone screens are more similar to

179
00:11:09.164 --> 00:11:12.259
the onsite interviews,
except they're shorter.

180
00:11:12.259 --> 00:11:15.462
And so
the problems maybe a little bit easier,

181
00:11:15.462 --> 00:11:20.888
just because the time constraint of
the phone screen is usually 45 minutes or

182
00:11:20.888 --> 00:11:24.560
so, versus onsite it's more like an hour.

183
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.960
Although that can vary, of course.

184
00:11:28.586 --> 00:11:30.890
So know your data structure algorithms,

185
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.870
thinking ahead of time
about recent projects.

186
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.080
Like a highlight reel,

187
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.660
what are some really cool challenges that
you saw recently, how did you do it?

188
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.460
Just have that on hand.

189
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:47.530
Here's the other one, what was some issue
you had with someone you work with?

190
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:48.770
How did you resolve it?

191
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:52.090
So just write these things down and
have them ready.

192
00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:56.918
When people ask you to tell you about
themselves you can give them a good answer

193
00:11:56.918 --> 00:12:01.315
about who you are, what you do, and
what you're interested in next.

194
00:12:01.315 --> 00:12:08.750
All right.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right,

195
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.850
yeah, and another thing is,
have a conversational tone.

196
00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.520
You don't need to be overly formal, but

197
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:19.740
you don't wanna be too informal as well,
you wanna have a good balance there.

198
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:26.362
Okay, any questions about how to
overachieve at each of these steps?

199
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.266
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm?

200
00:12:30.266 --> 00:12:31.967
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So if a recruiter, or

201
00:12:31.967 --> 00:12:37.828
whoever your future employer may be,
asks you, tell me about yourself,

202
00:12:37.828 --> 00:12:41.550
how do you approach that?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I just flail,

203
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:42.223
usually.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Okay.

204
00:12:42.223 --> 00:12:43.550
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH] No.

205
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:48.890
I mean, so the format I try to take is,
this is who I am,

206
00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.030
this is where I work,
this is something I'm working on lately.

207
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:57.920
And then usually I say, and also I
do a lot of education related stuff,

208
00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.970
and I really am passionate about that.

209
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:00.925
So that's kind of the format.

210
00:13:00.925 --> 00:13:05.188
I'm like, who I am, what I do now, or
the project that I'm currently working on?

211
00:13:05.188 --> 00:13:10.195
And some other technical
tidbit that shows that I'm

212
00:13:10.195 --> 00:13:16.130
engaged to have some technical
leadership type experience.

213
00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:21.018
So that's kind of how I do it, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So stuff like,

214
00:13:21.018 --> 00:13:26.286
this is why I love what I do, and this is
why I am who I am, and more like, this

215
00:13:26.286 --> 00:13:31.875
is what's currently going on in my life?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, yeah.

216
00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:35.473
At least I like to draw
from just the facts, and

217
00:13:35.473 --> 00:13:39.470
then let them kind of speak for
themselves.

218
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.960
I don't know if that's necessarily
the best technique, but

219
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.520
that's just my approach generally, yeah.
