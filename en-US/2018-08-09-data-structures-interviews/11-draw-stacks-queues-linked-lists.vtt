&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
our exercise is an artistic one.

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.130
We're going to be drawing out what we
remember of these data structures.

3
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.550
For those of you in person
I have markers and paper.

4
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.700
We're going to, from memory,
draw a stack, queue and

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.750
a linked list however you
remember it in your head.

6
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.700
For fun, you could Tweet it at me or
FrontendMasters.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.499
And we can just see what funny thing or

8
00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:32.289

from these data structures so far.
