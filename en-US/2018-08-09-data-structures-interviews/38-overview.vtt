&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So now that you
have some foundational experience with

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.280
implementing data structure from scratch,

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.500
it's time to apply those to some
common interview questions.

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.138
And so what we're gonna do right now
is investigate different themes and

5
00:00:16.138 --> 00:00:20.942
different types of questions that
you'll see for these data structures.

6
00:00:20.942 --> 00:00:24.161
And kind of talk about
things to keep in mind,

7
00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:27.630
then it's up to you to go and
implement them.

8
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.950
And there's solutions online, and
to practice these types of problems.

9
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.050
So let's take a look, these are some
common questions about stocks and queues.

10
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.560
Actually, let me take a step back and
talk about where I have accumulated these

11
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.180
themes and questions and
the resources that I used.

12
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.030
So how I first started
learning data structures and

13
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.930
algorithms was through MOOCs, so like
college classes on data structures and

14
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.990
algorithms and things like that.

15
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.850
Reading books like Cracking
the Coding Interview,

16
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.760
kind of takes a less academic approach,
and I think that's a lot more digestible.

17
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.580
So a lot of my questions are from

18
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.720
themes that I found in Cracking the Coding
Interview, websites like InterviewBit,

19
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.860
LeetCode, and
GeeksforGeeks is another one that I like.

20
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.940
It's like a crowd sourced website.

21
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.737
So basically what I did in preparation for

22
00:01:26.737 --> 00:01:32.597
this class is I went through all
the questions on these platforms

23
00:01:32.597 --> 00:01:37.930
that were under the particular
data structure umbrella.

24
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.731
And then that kind of like
went through them and

25
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:45.730
try to pick up themes and
different approaches.

26
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.460
And so this one what I wanna do is kind
of talk to you about what I found and

27
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.260
different ways to approach
these kind of problems.

28
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.900
So that when you see them, and
you'll see an adaption of these in

29
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.140
a variety of different ways that
you'll have an idea of where to start.
