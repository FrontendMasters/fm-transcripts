00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.223
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: So we're gonna
start off with a brief introduction.

2
00:00:02.223 --> 00:00:06.634
This is gonna kinda go over what Elm is,
who's using it.

3
00:00:06.634 --> 00:00:10.312
Some of the costs, cuz every technology
has some costs and, of course,

4
00:00:10.312 --> 00:00:12.590
some benefits that come with those costs.

5
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.060
And finally, we're gonna talk about some
of the overall structure of the workshop.

6
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.755
Okay, so elm fundamentally is
a programming language that compiles to

7
00:00:19.755 --> 00:00:20.500
JavaScript.

8
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.269
So it's a separate programming language
from language from JavaScript in the sense

9
00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.540
that it's got its own semantics,
it's got its own syntax.

10
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.270
But it does compile to JavaScript,

11
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.400
which is important because that's how
web browsers are able to understand it.

12
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.620
You might be familiar with Babel.

13
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.800
Babel is another programming language
that compiles to JavaScript.

14
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.840
So Elm does essentially
the same thing that Babel does,

15
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.170
except the difference is that, whereas
Babel has semantics that are intentionally

16
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.930
very similar to JavaScript's,
Elm has its own semantics,

17
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.120
its own syntax,
separate programming language.

18
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.830
TypeScript is another example
of a programming language that

19
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.690
compiles as JavaScript.

20
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.486
Again, very intentionally close to
JavaScript, but as well we'll see,

21
00:00:56.486 --> 00:01:00.766
Elm has a more significant departure from
JavaScript, and that comes with costs and

22
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:01.387
benefits.

23
00:01:01.387 --> 00:01:03.921
There's companies of all
different sizes using Elm.

24
00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:07.790
Some big ones that are publicly traded
companies that you've probably heard of,

25
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.060
all the way down to smaller companies and
then sort of everything in between.

26
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.920
Most of these companies are using
Elm in various different ways.

27
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.780
So I believe Amazon,
the AWS team uses it for internal tools.

28
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.920
I think that's how Microsoft is using it,
too.

29
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.100
Whereas we use it to power our entire
front end, that's how Culture Amp does it,

30
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.230
and everything in between.

31
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.720
So depending on the company and
what they use Elm for,

32
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.750
you might find that different companies
have different reasons for using it.
