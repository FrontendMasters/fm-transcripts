00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.441
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Another way I
could write an annotation is for

2
00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:03.669
something like this.

3
00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.933
I could say, totalPages is an integer,
that's true.

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:10.034
So Elm has integers as well as floats.

5
00:00:10.034 --> 00:00:12.685
So floating points,
that would be like a decimal.

6
00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:13.462
Also, Boolean.

7
00:00:13.462 --> 00:00:17.475
So isActive, Bool, that works.

8
00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:19.034
Here's how we can annotate functions.

9
00:00:19.034 --> 00:00:22.664
So I could say the function round, goes
from the float to an int by rounding it

10
00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:26.376
off, there is also floor and ceiling,
which have the same type annotation.

11
00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:29.833
There is the not function,
which we saw earlier, that takes true and

12
00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:32.707
turns it into false or
vice versa, that's bool to bool.

13
00:00:32.707 --> 00:00:35.047
The arrow basically says,
here is what I'm taking in and

14
00:00:35.047 --> 00:00:36.524
then here's what I'm returning.

15
00:00:36.524 --> 00:00:40.648
We have a String.length, which gives
you back the length of a string,

16
00:00:40.648 --> 00:00:42.933
that takes a string and returns on int.

17
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:46.452
We can also do record
types in our annotations.

18
00:00:46.452 --> 00:00:50.872
So this kind of demonstrates that's
why elm has this different syntax for

19
00:00:50.872 --> 00:00:52.019
colon and equals.

20
00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.833
If you see these kind of
stacked up like this.

21
00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:59.763
Colon is used for types in Elm,
whereas equals is used for values.

22
00:00:59.763 --> 00:01:02.944
So that's why there's a slightly different
syntactic difference between Elm and

23
00:01:02.944 --> 00:01:04.816
JavaScript in terms of
how these literals look.

24
00:01:04.816 --> 00:01:09.321
So in JavaScript, there is no type
annotation that uses colons, so

25
00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:11.065
colon can mean whatever.

26
00:01:11.065 --> 00:01:12.652
Whereas the Elm,
it wants to be consistent.

27
00:01:12.652 --> 00:01:16.097
As you can see on the bottom here, where
we're using equals for the values and

28
00:01:16.097 --> 00:01:18.657
then colon for
the types corresponding to those values.
