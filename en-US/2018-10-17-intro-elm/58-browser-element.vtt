00:00:00.044 --> 00:00:04.419
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Now previously, when
we introduced Browser, back in part three

2
00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:10.144
when we introduced Browser.sandbox, which
was the way that we had our program up and

3
00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:15.335
running and able to process interaction,
update took this type signature.

4
00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:17.939
It took a message and
a model and returned a model.

5
00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.119
Now, we're gonna be upgrading
to Browser.element,

6
00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.700
which has a different signature for
update.

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.258
It looks basically the same as before,
except now it's returning a tuple of Model

8
00:00:28.258 --> 00:00:30.915
and Cmd Msg, and
that's the only difference.

9
00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:35.383
Everything else is essentially the same
as before, as we had with the sandbox,

10
00:00:35.383 --> 00:00:39.384
except now we're able to actually do
some commands in addition to our,

11
00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:43.541
that's a tuple sight, it's the first
tuple we've encountered so far.

12
00:00:45.165 --> 00:00:48.264
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Okay, and so
essentially, each of our branches of

13
00:00:48.264 --> 00:00:53.163
update is still going to have that case
expression that's gonna check each of our

14
00:00:53.163 --> 00:00:57.292
messages and make sure that we're
handling everything properly.

15
00:00:57.292 --> 00:01:01.059
And now each of those branches,
instead of returning Model, or

16
00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.871
maybe a record update on Model, it's gonna
do that and also some sort of command,

17
00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:07.994
like pickGreeting, for example.

18
00:01:07.994 --> 00:01:12.414
Or, as is so often the case,
we have no commands that we want to run,

19
00:01:12.414 --> 00:01:14.055
you just say Cmd.none.

20
00:01:14.055 --> 00:01:16.965
And that says don't do anything,
I just wanna update the model, or

21
00:01:16.965 --> 00:01:18.865
maybe I don't even wanna update the model.
