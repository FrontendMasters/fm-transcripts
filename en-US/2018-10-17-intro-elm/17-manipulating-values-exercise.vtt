00:00:00.204 --> 00:00:03.581
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Great,
let's dive into the exercise.

2
00:00:03.581 --> 00:00:07.815
So we're gonna work, again we're building
up this same homepage that we've been

3
00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:09.821
building up in the previous exercise.

4
00:00:09.821 --> 00:00:14.568
Now we're gonna add something to the right
that's got a list of popular tags.

5
00:00:14.568 --> 00:00:18.741
So we're gonna use list.map to
iterate over a list of tags and

6
00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:24.131
actually display in the right hand side
there a list of whatever tags there are.

7
00:00:24.131 --> 00:00:25.654
So let's hop over here.

8
00:00:25.654 --> 00:00:27.869
Hey, the terminal came up this time,
great.

9
00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.970
[LAUGH] And go into part2.

10
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.835
So once again, we see the same
kind of stuff that we did before.

11
00:00:33.835 --> 00:00:36.663
There is a new directory
down there called source.

12
00:00:36.663 --> 00:00:40.166
So typically speaking,
when you do your Elm programs,

13
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:43.604
it's not normal to put all
your files in the top level.

14
00:00:43.604 --> 00:00:45.553
Usually you put them
in a sub directory and

15
00:00:45.553 --> 00:00:47.733
usually that sub directory
is called source.

16
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:52.405
So compared to the previous one, I've
moved us a little bit closer to the way

17
00:00:52.405 --> 00:00:55.107
things are done in normal Applications.

18
00:00:55.107 --> 00:00:58.141
Contents of source,
we have only one file, main.elm, so

19
00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.787
all I did was move it into there.

20
00:00:59.787 --> 00:01:04.548
However, that does mean that we're
going to run the build a little bit

21
00:01:04.548 --> 00:01:06.979
differently than we did last time.

22
00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.027
So if I open up the readme here, notice
that now instead of elm make Main.elm,

23
00:01:12.027 --> 00:01:14.178
it's elm make src/Main.elm.

24
00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:18.155
Otherwise, everything else
is the same as before.

25
00:01:18.155 --> 00:01:23.225
So let's go back here,
and compile that, okay?

26
00:01:23.225 --> 00:01:26.819
And also worth noting that previously,
we had,

27
00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:31.384
in the browser, had,
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: The part one

28
00:01:31.384 --> 00:01:34.746
index.html up there in the location bar.

29
00:01:34.746 --> 00:01:38.176
We do need to open a different
index.html for part two.

30
00:01:38.176 --> 00:01:41.544
It's gonna be different for
the part one index.html.

31
00:01:41.544 --> 00:01:45.000
So you can see over here we have
the same header as we did before but

32
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.216
now we have this popular tabs
thing over there on the right.

33
00:01:48.216 --> 00:01:51.721
So et's take a look at the code
that we're going to be working

34
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:53.872
on to actually populate that thing.

35
00:01:53.872 --> 00:01:55.224
Because right now,

36
00:01:55.224 --> 00:01:59.766
popular tags is looking kind of sad
with no actual popular tags yet.

37
00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:03.370
All right, so here we have the same
module structure as before,

38
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.987
the same imports as before.

39
00:02:04.987 --> 00:02:07.332
Again, not quite gonna cover that yet.

40
00:02:07.332 --> 00:02:09.939
We now have a function called viewTags,
and

41
00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.204
it takes as an argument a list of tags.

42
00:02:12.204 --> 00:02:13.841
And we have a let expression inside.

43
00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:16.653
So we have it TODO for
what we're gonna do in there.

44
00:02:16.653 --> 00:02:19.059
Then we also have a viewTag function,

45
00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:22.525
which ultimately viewTags
is going to end up calling.

46
00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:25.054
And finally we have our main,
just like before,

47
00:02:25.054 --> 00:02:27.528
which has another let expression for
the tags.

48
00:02:27.528 --> 00:02:32.499
Currently these are hardcoded, but in the
future we will move them into something

49
00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:34.816
that we actually get from the server.

50
00:02:34.816 --> 00:02:36.935
And then finally,
we have a third TODO down here.

51
00:02:36.935 --> 00:02:38.777
So there are a grand
total of three TODO's.

52
00:02:38.777 --> 00:02:42.670
First up we have inside viewTags, then we
have one another one inside viewTag, and

53
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.349
finally we have one inside of main.
