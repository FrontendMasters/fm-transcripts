&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Here's how we could
annotate the model that we used in

2
00:00:02.534 --> 00:00:03.728
the previous exercise.

3
00:00:03.728 --> 00:00:06.652
We could write out this entire
elaborate nested record, and

4
00:00:06.652 --> 00:00:08.097
this is perfectly accurate.

5
00:00:08.097 --> 00:00:11.392
If we wanted to put this in our program,
Elm would accept it, it would say, yes,

6
00:00:11.392 --> 00:00:13.248
I agree,
that is what your model looks like.

7
00:00:13.248 --> 00:00:18.048
It's a record of a selectedTag field,
which is a String, a List of articles,

8
00:00:18.048 --> 00:00:20.034
which is a List of also records.

9
00:00:20.034 --> 00:00:23.323
Each of those records has a title String,
tags, which is a List of Strings, and

10
00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:24.808
then body, which is also a String.

11
00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:27.119
But as you can imagine if your
program gets kind of big,

12
00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.238
you don't want to write
all this out all the time.

13
00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:31.462
That's just a lot of
stuff to be repeating,

14
00:00:31.462 --> 00:00:35.442
especially if you have multiple different
places where a model is being used.

15
00:00:35.442 --> 00:00:40.136
You don't have to copy and paste all that
around, fortunately, we don't have to.

16
00:00:40.136 --> 00:00:45.013
We can do what's called a type alias,
which is a way to give a name to a type.

17
00:00:45.013 --> 00:00:48.621
So just like we can have declarations,
where we say user name equals, quote,

18
00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:50.762
RTFeldman, that's giving
a name to a value.

19
00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:54.054
Type alias is a way to give
a name to a particular type.

20
00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.078
And it's most often used
with more elaborate types,

21
00:00:57.078 --> 00:01:01.186
sort of of compound types like this
that have other types inside of them.

22
00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:03.759
Like records or parameter types.

23
00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:08.475
Once we define our type alias for
Article, then the type alias for

24
00:01:08.475 --> 00:01:10.714
Model gets much more concise.

25
00:01:10.714 --> 00:01:14.604
Now we can say selectedTag is a String,
and articles is just List Article.

26
00:01:14.604 --> 00:01:15.920
It's a list of articles and

27
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.907
then we've defined elsewhere
what it means to be an article.
