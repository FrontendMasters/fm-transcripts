00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.806
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Okay, let's take
a look at the exercise for part five.

2
00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:11.433
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Okay,
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: All right, so

3
00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:16.224
this is the part where we flip the bit and
we are now not just working on what we had

4
00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:19.873
before, where we were just
building up this index.html.

5
00:00:19.873 --> 00:00:24.537
We are now actually working with
the entire working application.

6
00:00:24.537 --> 00:00:28.245
So we have a new directory called assets,
which just has some static assets.

7
00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:30.307
Not gonna worry about that too much.

8
00:00:30.307 --> 00:00:32.327
If we look inside the source
directory though,

9
00:00:32.327 --> 00:00:35.166
we now have a whole bunch more stuff,
so a whole bunch of Elm files.

10
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:39.162
We've actually got some additional
directories in there for

11
00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:40.320
even more sources.

12
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.574
And 99% of these we're not going to worry
about for the purpose of this workshop.

13
00:00:46.574 --> 00:00:49.939
The reason they're there is to sort
of give you a sense of not just how

14
00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:53.247
do I build an Elm application
from scratch, that's very simple,

15
00:00:53.247 --> 00:00:56.043
which is what we've been
working with up to this point.

16
00:00:56.043 --> 00:00:58.014
But this is now demonstrating, okay,

17
00:00:58.014 --> 00:01:01.190
what does it feel like to work
inside an existing ELM code base?

18
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.439
Let's fast forward and say,
you've gotten it introduced at work,

19
00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.744
you're working with this
larger ELM code base.

20
00:01:06.744 --> 00:01:11.270
What does it feel like to work inside
of this code base and make changes?

21
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.167
Because really, that's I think a very
important part of sort of the experience

22
00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:19.006
of using ELM is what does it feel like
when you're making changes to an existing

23
00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:22.400
code base that's way too much to
already have loaded into your head.

24
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.106
And as you can see here, there's no
way to get up to speed this quickly.

25
00:01:26.106 --> 00:01:29.720
We're just going to be relying on the
compiler, and we're just gonna see just

26
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.750
how much help it can give us when
we're solving these exercises.

27
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.580
Cool, okay, so part five.

28
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.876
I open up the Readme.

29
00:01:36.876 --> 00:01:42.483
It sort of explains that we're going
to be working on this larger code base.

30
00:01:42.483 --> 00:01:46.338
We're still going to be
building source main.elm, but

31
00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:49.238
we're gonna be editing different files.

32
00:01:49.238 --> 00:01:53.645
So source main.elm imports all other
files that we're gonna be modifying.

33
00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:57.268
So for the rest of the workshop we're
still going to be building the same way,

34
00:01:57.268 --> 00:02:01.005
it's just that we don't need to point it
at different files just because we're

35
00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:02.320
editing different files.

36
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.629
The fact that main imports those files
means that the compiler will figure it

37
00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:07.311
out for us.

38
00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:09.644
Second thing is instead
of opening index.html,

39
00:02:09.644 --> 00:02:11.926
we're now gonna open local host port 3000.

40
00:02:11.926 --> 00:02:14.684
So that's that server we set up
at the beginning of the workshop.

41
00:02:14.684 --> 00:02:19.109
And finally we're gonna specify
a slightly different output target,

42
00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.289
which is to say ../server/public/elm.js.

43
00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.239
And basically this is so
that it's going to be outputted

44
00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.507
into the folder that the server that we've
got running is going to be expecting,

45
00:02:29.507 --> 00:02:31.601
rather than into our local directory.

46
00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:33.625
So start off with that.

47
00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:36.735
ELM make, okay, success,
compiled one module.

48
00:02:36.735 --> 00:02:41.973
And now when I go back to my browser,
I'm going to go to local host port 3000.

49
00:02:41.973 --> 00:02:46.273
Great and here we can see everything
looks pretty similar except there's now,

50
00:02:46.273 --> 00:02:50.637
believe it or not, a whole bunch more
functionality going on behind the scenes,

51
00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.650
not just rendering a little avatar.

52
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.233
[LAUGH] There's actually
an entire application here.

53
00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:58.463
So now we can sign in, we can sign up,
we can click links to people's profiles.

54
00:02:58.463 --> 00:03:00.768
There's way more functionality
than what we had before.

55
00:03:00.768 --> 00:03:04.688
Also, this is a single page app, but we're
not gonna get into how those work today.

56
00:03:04.688 --> 00:03:10.287
Just be aware that this is really
a sort of fully futured example app.

57
00:03:10.287 --> 00:03:14.284
Also worth noting that this is, being
a real world app, you can see this whole

58
00:03:14.284 --> 00:03:17.608
application implemented in
various different technologies,

59
00:03:17.608 --> 00:03:19.652
which can also be a good learning tool.

60
00:03:19.652 --> 00:03:21.580
So there's a react Readex version of this.

61
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.456
There's an Angular version of this.

62
00:03:22.456 --> 00:03:23.604
There's a View version of this.

63
00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:27.602
If you go to their website, which we'll
have a link to at the end, you can see

64
00:03:27.602 --> 00:03:31.556
this same application implemented in
a bunch of different technologies.

65
00:03:31.556 --> 00:03:33.249
And by the end of this workshop,

66
00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:36.967
you'll be at least partially familiar
with the ELM implementation.

67
00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:41.266
Cool, okay, so same format as
what we've been doing so far.

68
00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:45.139
We're gonna open up main.elem and we're
gonna start working through the to do's.

69
00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:49.250
You may notice there are slightly
more imports now because,

70
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.483
well there's a lot of
stuff going on there now.

71
00:03:52.483 --> 00:03:54.391
And actually I just remembered that for
this exercise,

72
00:03:54.391 --> 00:03:55.661
we're not gonna work on main.elm.

73
00:03:55.661 --> 00:04:00.727
It's actually going to be
sourcepageregister.elm.

74
00:04:00.727 --> 00:04:02.435
So this is the sign up page.

75
00:04:02.435 --> 00:04:04.660
So still more imports,
but not as many as main.

76
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.840
Main wires everything together, so it's
got the most imports as a general rule.

77
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.525
Okay, so this is sign up page.

78
00:04:12.525 --> 00:04:17.599
And so right now when we open up
the sign up page, there's a bug, and

79
00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:23.311
this bug exists because I introduced it so
we could do an exercise around it.

80
00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:24.243
But here's the bug.

81
00:04:24.243 --> 00:04:25.787
So let's say I wanna
sign up as Archy Feldman.

82
00:04:25.787 --> 00:04:27.818
I'm like, yeah, cool,
sign up as Archy Feldman.

83
00:04:27.818 --> 00:04:30.690
Email address is, hey,
where did my username go?

84
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.624
That's weird, let's try again,
rtfeldman, okay, kept it, great.

85
00:04:34.624 --> 00:04:36.690
My email is, come on, what's going on?

86
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.000
So there's a weird bug here where when I'm
typing in my username it works fine, and

87
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.894
then as soon as I start typing
in any of the other fields,

88
00:04:43.894 --> 00:04:46.745
like if I start typing in a password,
it clears it out.

89
00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:51.537
And that's the symptom of the bug, and
we're gonna see what the root cause is and

90
00:04:51.537 --> 00:04:54.231
then fix it over the course
of this exercise.

91
00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:57.120
Okay, so here's our first to do.

92
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.548
When the user inputs a user name,
update it in the model.

93
00:05:00.548 --> 00:05:03.508
So that's kind of a clue list
of what's the problem here is.

94
00:05:03.508 --> 00:05:07.302
We currently are not actually writing
down the username whenever the user

95
00:05:07.302 --> 00:05:07.985
types it in.

96
00:05:07.985 --> 00:05:11.711
Which means that as soon as we
change any of the other forms,

97
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:15.748
it immediately sort of gets blown
way as ELM rerenders the page.

98
00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:19.299
I'm not going to explain how to do this.

99
00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:21.466
Because if this were a real code base,

100
00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:24.800
we wouldn't necessarily know
how all these things work.

101
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.623
We see a bunch of ELM code here, and
we sort of know how ELM code works.

102
00:05:27.623 --> 00:05:30.565
We don't know the exact details
of how this code base works yet.

103
00:05:30.565 --> 00:05:31.908
That's okay, though.

104
00:05:31.908 --> 00:05:35.022
We have all the tools to do it,
the compiler's gonna help us out.

105
00:05:35.022 --> 00:05:39.201
Now we've got a hint which is to say you
can see examples of how to do something

106
00:05:39.201 --> 00:05:41.633
like this in the email input below, right.

107
00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:43.346
We've also got email which
is working properly,

108
00:05:43.346 --> 00:05:45.033
we've got password which
is working properly.

109
00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:46.843
It's just username that's broken.

110
00:05:46.843 --> 00:05:48.904
So we're gonna use that as an example, and

111
00:05:48.904 --> 00:05:51.724
take a look at that to figure
out how to solve this problem.

112
00:05:51.724 --> 00:05:55.326
There's only one to do in here,
but there's some implications.

113
00:05:55.326 --> 00:05:58.901
This is not going to be one of those
things where we can just add one line of

114
00:05:58.901 --> 00:06:00.757
code here and it's just gonna work.

115
00:06:00.757 --> 00:06:04.233
The one line of code that we add is going
to have be based on making some other

116
00:06:04.233 --> 00:06:07.881
modifications to this file, using custom
types that we just learned about,

117
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:11.500
using the ELM architecture that we
learned about in the previous sections.

118
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.460
And all the tips and

119
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.135
tricks that we've accumulated
throughout the course of the workshop.

120
00:06:16.135 --> 00:06:19.468
So this is a live fire exercise,
we're gonna solve our first ELM

121
00:06:19.468 --> 00:06:24.050
bug in an unfamiliar code base, and we're
gonna do it in between 10 and 15 minutes.
