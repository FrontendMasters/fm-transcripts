00:00:00.198 --> 00:00:01.216
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: So for this exercise,

2
00:00:01.216 --> 00:00:05.088
we're going to see that there's something
slightly wrong with our feed once again.

3
00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:07.645
This poor feed really can't catch a break.

4
00:00:07.645 --> 00:00:11.058
So on the left we see what we're
going to see when we start out,

5
00:00:11.058 --> 00:00:14.816
which is to say that instead of
actually showing the article names.

6
00:00:14.816 --> 00:00:18.184
Because these are coming back
as JSON from the server.

7
00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.499
It's just going to say
needs decoding everywhere,

8
00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:22.665
because that's what
we've hard-coded it to.

9
00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:25.842
And what we're going to do is we're going
to actually implement the decoders that

10
00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:27.324
will translate that from the server.

11
00:00:27.324 --> 00:00:31.172
So that we can actually get our
nice article titles back here,

12
00:00:31.172 --> 00:00:33.399
so I'll jump into part7 for that.

13
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:40.721
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: And-
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: If we open up

14
00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:44.542
the README, once again, we've got
the same build command as before,

15
00:00:44.542 --> 00:00:46.468
articles don't quite look right.

16
00:00:46.468 --> 00:00:52.678
And the way we're going to fix
this is by adding article.elm and

17
00:00:52.678 --> 00:00:56.361
resolving the TODO that's in there.

18
00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:58.847
So, this right here is a metadata decoder,

19
00:00:58.847 --> 00:01:01.750
it's decoding some metadata
about the articles.

20
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.625
Which is to say things like the title and
the description and all that.

21
00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:09.024
And we've got, as you can see,
[LAUGH], required for createdAt,

22
00:01:09.024 --> 00:01:11.952
that's the only one that we
actually have implemented.

23
00:01:11.952 --> 00:01:16.293
And all of the others are hardcoded, so
hardcoded is something that happens in

24
00:01:16.293 --> 00:01:19.342
these pipeline decoders,
if you say, you know what?

25
00:01:19.342 --> 00:01:23.098
I don't even want to look at the JSON,
just hardcode it to always be this value,

26
00:01:23.098 --> 00:01:25.302
and just stick that right
there in the record.

27
00:01:25.302 --> 00:01:28.069
So what we're going to do is we're
going to replace all of these calls to

28
00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.584
hardcoded.

29
00:01:28.584 --> 00:01:33.912
With calls to required in order
to decode these things properly.

30
00:01:33.912 --> 00:01:38.147
Okay, so that's the only to-do
that we have to resolve.

31
00:01:38.147 --> 00:01:39.686
But of course it has multiple sub to-dos,

32
00:01:39.686 --> 00:01:41.757
because there are several
instances of hardcoded here.

33
00:01:41.757 --> 00:01:44.693
But when they're all done,
everything should compile, and

34
00:01:44.693 --> 00:01:47.182
the articles should be
appearing in the feed again.
