00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.059
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Excellent,
let's hop over to the exercise.

2
00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:09.316
Go over to the exercise for
part four and open it up.

3
00:00:09.316 --> 00:00:13.591
So for this exercise we're not
actually going to open the browser,

4
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:17.941
we're just going to take the stuff
we did in the previous exercise and

5
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:19.442
add annotations to it.

6
00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:23.542
So in the read me it says, no need to open
index.html in your browser this time,

7
00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:25.578
the exercise is only about compiling.

8
00:00:25.578 --> 00:00:27.469
So we're gonna open
main.elm in our editor.

9
00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:31.419
And what we'll see here is we've
got a bunch of to do's that

10
00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.780
essentially have to do with type
annotations, and that's all.

11
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.342
So we're not actually changing
any of the logic here,

12
00:00:38.342 --> 00:00:41.416
we're just sort of adding
documentation to what we already did.

13
00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:44.426
So this first one is about
creating a type alias.

14
00:00:44.426 --> 00:00:47.863
So we've got this sort of nested all
articles list that's got a bunch of

15
00:00:47.863 --> 00:00:49.076
different fields in it.

16
00:00:49.076 --> 00:00:52.248
We're gonna break that out and
give it a type alias called articles.

17
00:00:52.248 --> 00:00:54.784
So this can just become list article.

18
00:00:54.784 --> 00:00:59.222
And the remainder of the TODOs have
to do with adding annotations to

19
00:00:59.222 --> 00:01:01.609
existing top level declarations.

20
00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.793
So this initial model will add something
that says initial model colon and

21
00:01:04.793 --> 00:01:05.472
then the type.

22
00:01:05.472 --> 00:01:08.904
And then we'll do that several other
times throughout the exercise.
