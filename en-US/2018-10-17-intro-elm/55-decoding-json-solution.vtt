00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.550
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: So
we have just the one to do here.

2
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.230
Let's start by taking a look at how
sort of the existing version looks.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.700
So we have this global feed.

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.340
Everything in here say it needs decoding.

5
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.745
Hey, we now have
the article that I posted,

6
00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.780
[LAUGH] great, from the previous exercise.

7
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.250
[COUGH] Well, it also needs decoding.

8
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.940
So all of these things are relying
on the same decoder for

9
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.230
metadata, which currently
has everything as hardcoded.

10
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.780
So essentially, let's convert these.

11
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.300
So metadata is a type alias
that is defined up here.

12
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.670
So it's got description which is a string,
title which is a string,

13
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.520
a list of tags, favorite id,
favorites count and createdAt, and

14
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.530
createdAt is the only one
that's filled in with required.

15
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.997
So let's just go down the line.

16
00:00:42.997 --> 00:00:46.694
[COUGH] So the first one we're gonna
need is a required description and

17
00:00:46.694 --> 00:00:47.850
that one is a string.

18
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.910
Then we're gonna need
another required one,

19
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.860
in fact all these are gonna be required,
so title, title is also a string.

20
00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:02.269
Then we have tagList,
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Which

21
00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.970
is not a string but a list of strings.

22
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.030
And so we're gonna call the list function
inside the json.decode module, and

23
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.540
pass it string decoder so

24
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.200
it turns that from a single string
decoder to a decoder of list of strings.

25
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.260
Then we've got favorited, which is
a bullion, that will just be bull.

26
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.383
And finally we have favoritesCount,

27
00:01:28.093 --> 00:01:31.884
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Which is an int, okay.

28
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:37.260
&gt;&gt; Richard Feldman: Let's see.

29
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.960
Yeah, order matters.

30
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.769
These must be decoded in the same order
the order of the fields in 'type alias

31
00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:42.040
Metadata' above.

32
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.850
So let's just double check that we got
those in the right order, description,

33
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.724
title, tagList, favorited,
favoritesCount, and createdAt.

34
00:01:49.724 --> 00:01:54.795
Looks good, let's rebuild, that worked.

35
00:01:54.795 --> 00:01:59.355
Let's refresh, go to the global feed and
hey, we got article titles again.

36
00:01:59.355 --> 00:02:02.535
Including, this excellent piece that I
wrote here, which I all suggest you read

37
00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:05.335
afterwards, because,
I think it's really got a lot to say.
