00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.170
Let's turn our designs
into styled components.

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.050
We wanna create our secondary and
tertiary buttons.

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.480
But if you notice, some of these
properties, our CSS properties,

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.580
are gonna be the same.

5
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.520
Our padding's gonna be the same,
our font size.

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.290
So do we repeat ourselves for
every single button?

7
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.998
You could, but let's actually make a base
button component that's gonna have all of

8
00:00:21.998 --> 00:00:22.935
our shared styling.

9
00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:26.908
And then we can kind of inherit
from it for our other buttons.

10
00:00:26.908 --> 00:00:31.022
So let's refactor this a little,
so we've got const button.

11
00:00:31.022 --> 00:00:35.415
Again, this is gonna be a button,
so styled.button.

12
00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:40.940
I'm gonna pull font size and padding
straight out of our primary button and

13
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.367
put it in our new button
we're creating here.

14
00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:49.230
I'm also gonna give up
a border radius of 2 pixels.

15
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.446
You can follow along with me, or you can
actually, you'll have time later, but

16
00:00:53.446 --> 00:00:57.239
you can apply the styles from your
design that you just created in Figma.

17
00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.535
So I'm gonna set a minimum width so
that, if we have super small buttons,

18
00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:04.326
they'll at least have 100 pixels in width.

19
00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:09.886
On a button, we want to indicate to
the user that, hey, this is clickable,

20
00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:10.916
it's a form element.

21
00:01:10.916 --> 00:01:12.525
So I'm gonna give it a cursor pointer.

22
00:01:12.525 --> 00:01:17.588
And I'm just gonna set my
font-family to Roboto Mono.

23
00:01:17.588 --> 00:01:19.596
Again, feel free to use your font family.

24
00:01:24.222 --> 00:01:27.661
So now I've got this base button,
I'm not actually using it anywhere, so

25
00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:29.197
let's go ahead and change that.

26
00:01:29.197 --> 00:01:32.800
Where it says styled.button,
we're gonna replace this now.

27
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.800
We're gonna open and
close parentheses here.

28
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.210
And this is going to say, inherit all the
properties from our new button component.

29
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.520
So we're not using an HTML
button element anymore.

30
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.892
We're gonna inherit everything from
our button component we just created.

31
00:01:44.892 --> 00:01:48.655
And so if I save this, you should see,
it now has my font style,

32
00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:50.786
has a little bit of a border radius.

33
00:01:50.786 --> 00:01:53.970
And if I hover over,
my cursor pointer is being applied.

34
00:01:58.352 --> 00:02:03.170
So if you used a Google font, and you're
kinda trying to figure out how to get it

35
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.607
integrated with this,
cuz that can be a little tricky.

36
00:02:06.607 --> 00:02:10.711
You just need to come to
the Google font site,

37
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:16.125
select a font, and
this link here that you see, copy that.

38
00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:19.226
We're gonna open our index.html,
and you can go ahead and

39
00:02:19.226 --> 00:02:21.155
throw that right in the head, okay?

40
00:02:21.155 --> 00:02:24.345
So if your front is not already
on your local computer,

41
00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:26.515
you can just go ahead and get it that way.

42
00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:33.038
One other thing before we start creating
our secondary and tertiary buttons.

43
00:02:33.038 --> 00:02:35.812
I don't need to save mine cuz I
already have my font on my computer.

44
00:02:35.812 --> 00:02:41.092
Let's create a variable, so let's say
I wanna use my primary color, okay?

45
00:02:42.092 --> 00:02:45.760
Why don't you go grab the hex code for
your primary color, whatever that may be.

46
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.194
And let's create a new variable,
so constant primary,

47
00:02:48.194 --> 00:02:51.250
I'm gonna call it primaryBlue,
you can call it whatever you'd like.

48
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.726
I'm gonna set my hex code here.

49
00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.950
And I wanna use this, so
instead of saying background color red,

50
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.323
let's actually use my variable.

51
00:03:04.177 --> 00:03:05.782
So it's very similar to a template string.

52
00:03:05.782 --> 00:03:10.656
You can actually evaluate variables inside
of styled components using the dollar sign

53
00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:11.666
curly brackets.

54
00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:13.512
So I'm gonna say primaryBlue here.

55
00:03:13.512 --> 00:03:18.095
And you can see now that my style is
being interpolated into actual hex code,

56
00:03:18.095 --> 00:03:19.467
which is really nice.

57
00:03:19.467 --> 00:03:22.858
So what I would like you to do,
take the next five minutes or

58
00:03:22.858 --> 00:03:25.016
so, it doesn't have to be perfect.

59
00:03:25.016 --> 00:03:29.527
I want you to create your secondary
button and your tertiary button.

60
00:03:29.527 --> 00:03:31.905
And you can use your designs on Figma,

61
00:03:31.905 --> 00:03:36.449
or you´re also welcome to use my
design if you would prefer that, okay?

62
00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:40.244
So let´s take ten minutes, let's code up
our secondary and tertiary buttons, and

63
00:03:40.244 --> 00:03:42.657
let's get them all rendering
in our index.js file.
