00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.244
This is my favorite section.

2
00:00:01.244 --> 00:00:05.460
We're gonna talk about the psychology
of colors for a second here, so

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.389
whether we realize this or not,

4
00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:12.263
a color of our products actually can
elicit emotional responses from our users.

5
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.943
So red is typically associated with fire,
violence, war, love and passion, and

6
00:00:19.943 --> 00:00:23.929
It can actually raise your users
blood pressure subconsciously.

7
00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.989
So really try to use this sparingly
throughout your application.

8
00:00:31.318 --> 00:00:35.379
Orange as vibrant and energetic typically
it can be associated with like earth,

9
00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:36.871
autumn change and movement,

10
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:39.690
this is a really great color
to use throughout your UIs.

11
00:00:43.271 --> 00:00:46.175
Yellows associated with happiness and
sunshine but

12
00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:49.081
can also be associated with cowardice,
or deceit.

13
00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:51.900
So just make sure you're
picking a nice shade

14
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.395
of yellow if you're gonna
use that throughout your UI.

15
00:00:58.698 --> 00:01:03.810
Green represents new beginnings and
growth, it can signify renewal, abundance,

16
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.566
or can even represent like envy or
jealousy, and it has many calming effects.

17
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:11.880
It's pretty similar to blue, but
it has the vibrancy of a yellow, so

18
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.093
green is a great choice.

19
00:01:13.093 --> 00:01:16.770
You might actually see this with
a lot of financial applications.

20
00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:21.228
Blue can represent sadness or calmness,

21
00:01:21.228 --> 00:01:24.890
but also represents trust and
reliability and responsibility.

22
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.582
And this is why you'll see a lot of social
media applications using blue like Twitter

23
00:01:28.582 --> 00:01:32.222
and Facebook because, they're basically
asking for all of your personal data and

24
00:01:32.222 --> 00:01:35.349
they wanna give you that subconscious
sense that it's safe with them.

25
00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:37.060
So that's why a lot of them choose blue.

26
00:01:40.253 --> 00:01:43.516
Purple's fun, I would love to
create an application using purple.

27
00:01:43.516 --> 00:01:47.697
It typically is associated with luxury and
royalty like the royal family for example,

28
00:01:47.697 --> 00:01:49.255
but it is a little bit quirkier.

29
00:01:52.647 --> 00:01:56.447
Black has long been associated with
power and elegance and formality,

30
00:01:56.447 --> 00:02:00.576
again, it can signify evil, death,
and mystery, so just be aware of that.

31
00:02:03.172 --> 00:02:04.129
And on the other side, we've got white.

32
00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:08.295
So white indicates purity, cleanliness,
virtue, and goodness, it's often used for

33
00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:09.472
a lot of modern designs.

34
00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:16.236
Gray can indicate moodiness or
depression but

35
00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:22.381
in general I would say gray is now more of
a formal and modern design for our UIs.

36
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:25.780
And then last we've got brown,
brown is a little boring sometimes,

37
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.190
it can indicate dependability,
reliability.

38
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.129
So if you're gonna use brown just make
sure it fits with your brand identity,

39
00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.948
if you're gonna use any color make
sure it exhibits your brand identity.

40
00:02:33.948 --> 00:02:37.173
So if you're building a financial
application like a banking site,

41
00:02:37.173 --> 00:02:38.238
maybe don't use red.

42
00:02:38.238 --> 00:02:42.401
We don't wanna raise our our clients
blood pressure while they're trying to

43
00:02:42.401 --> 00:02:43.370
transfer money.
