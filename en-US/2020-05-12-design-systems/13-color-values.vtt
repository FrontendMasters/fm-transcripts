00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.645
So hex,
we're probably all familiar with, right?

2
00:00:01.645 --> 00:00:04.130
It's the base 16
representation of a color.

3
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.080
So if you didn't go to computer science
school or you don't understand like this,

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.290
that's totally fine hex means hexadecimal,
so base 16.

5
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.430
So we count in base 10,
so digits 0 through 9.

6
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.120
Binary is base two,
hex is gonna be base 16.

7
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.020
So you'll have the digits 0 through 9, and

8
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.370
then also the letters A through F,
that's kinda where that comes from.

9
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.030
So we're probably pretty
familiar with hex.

10
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.370
You probably are also familiar with RGB,
so

11
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.700
this is the additive color mixing model
that we just looked at previously.

12
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.604
So it mixes red, green,
and blue light sources.

13
00:00:35.604 --> 00:00:40.583
RGBA is the same as RGB but
it has a fourth parameter, alpha,

14
00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:44.207
that represents the opacity of each pixel.

15
00:00:46.658 --> 00:00:47.266
And lastly,

16
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:51.247
you probably haven't heard of this if you
don't work with designers regularly, but

17
00:00:51.247 --> 00:00:56.040
the CYMK value, it's the subtroctive color
mixing model that's used in print design.

18
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.090
I didn't actually know that there were two
different kinds of values, like I just

19
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.357
assumed printed media was the same, like
I just assumed it was all RGB, it's not.

20
00:01:03.357 --> 00:01:06.772
So and that's fascinating.
