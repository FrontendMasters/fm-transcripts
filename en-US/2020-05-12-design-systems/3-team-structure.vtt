00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.560
So are three different team
structures that ideally would work.

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.860
The first is a centralized model, so

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.938
this is where you have one core
team building the design system.

4
00:00:08.938 --> 00:00:11.050
It's their full-time job, they build it,

5
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.510
they have complete veto
power over the system.

6
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.676
So if someone comes in and they say,
hey, I would like this component.

7
00:00:16.676 --> 00:00:20.173
They can say, yeah, let's do it, or
they can say, no, we're not doing this.

8
00:00:20.173 --> 00:00:21.915
So that's their full-time job, and

9
00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:24.265
then the product teams
would simply consume that.

10
00:00:26.585 --> 00:00:28.050
The second is a distributed model.

11
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.500
This is very popular for companies who
can't afford to put full-time talent

12
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.700
on building a design system.

13
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.170
And so this is where the product teams
who are consuming the system are also

14
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.250
building it.

15
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.800
This is really great in the sense that
it gives the teams a sense of ownership.

16
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.862
People are really excited about stuff
when they're the ones building it.

17
00:00:44.862 --> 00:00:50.054
It's also influenced by many vantage
points, which is really great.

18
00:00:50.054 --> 00:00:53.399
Innovation is a great thing,
and diversity is a great thing.

19
00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.148
And then lastly, less downtime.

20
00:00:55.148 --> 00:00:57.213
So if we have two developers on vacation,

21
00:00:57.213 --> 00:01:00.521
the system can still evolve because
we have lots of contributors.

22
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.034
And the hybrid model is a hybrid,
it combines both of these ideas.

23
00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:09.555
Where you have a core centralized
team who is responsible for

24
00:01:09.555 --> 00:01:11.703
kinda driving the system as a whole.

25
00:01:11.703 --> 00:01:15.732
But they still accept contributions
from the larger ecosystem.

26
00:01:15.732 --> 00:01:18.820
I'm gonna say ecosystem,
I mean internal ecosystem.

27
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.400
So generally, you wouldn't just open
source your your system in general, and

28
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.070
get community contributions.

29
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.880
But when I say open source,
I mean internally to your company.
