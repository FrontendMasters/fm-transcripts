00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.740
There are three main ways that we would
apply CSS.The primary one that you're

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.920
probably used to is creating
an external CSS stylesheet with a link

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.261
that you would link in
the head of your HTML element.

4
00:00:12.261 --> 00:00:15.930
The second way that you can apply CSS,
typically,

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.760
is creating style tags in
the head of your document and

6
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.510
just actually writing
the CSS in your HTML file.

7
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.220
And then lastly, we've got inline on
HTML elements using the style attribute,

8
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.920
which typically is not
a great way to do it.

9
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.290
Let's talk about some of
the problems with CSS.

10
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.030
First, we need to kind
of examine specificity.

11
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.270
You might not have even
heard this term before.

12
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.380
But this is the mathematical equation
of how our styles are applied to our

13
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.310
HTML elements.

14
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.510
So there are three different
big buckets of CSS specificity.

15
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.920
So the first are type selectors and
pseudo elements.

16
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.200
So you can see we've got an h1 tag and
the pseudo element here, so

17
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.250
the before element.

18
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.060
The second is class selectors,
attribute selectors, and pseudo classes.

19
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.810
So we've got a class of cat,
we have an input type of radio, so

20
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.530
that's our attribute selectors.

21
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.059
And we've got the pseudo class of hover
and then last bucket is ID selectors.

22
00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:19.267
So essentially, going back to this real
quick, the way that our styles are applied

23
00:01:19.267 --> 00:01:23.470
are by examining how specific a style
is and that accrues a point value.

24
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.460
So the most specific style wins.

25
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.460
So an ID selector is much more specific
than just selecting all h1 tags.

26
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.650
And so whatever has the ID selector,

27
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.770
whatever styles are in that,
are gonna be applied.
