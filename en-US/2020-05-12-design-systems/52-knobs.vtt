00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.620
Let's talk about knobs,
knobs are super cool.

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.650
So I wanna be able to test
the disabled state of our components.

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:14.635
So the first thing we need to do is,
install one more add-on.

4
00:00:14.635 --> 00:00:20.530
It's called storybook/addon-knobs,
so, npm install storybook.

5
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.350
Let me bring this up here so
you all can see it.

6
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:32.680
Npm install @storybook/addon-knobs, okay.

7
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.930
And, what do we need to do?

8
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.471
Come on, Brent,
I know you know the answer,

9
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:39.102
what do we have to do when
we install an add-on?

10
00:00:39.102 --> 00:00:41.430
&gt;&gt; Add it to main.

11
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.993
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

12
00:00:42.993 --> 00:00:47.530
Into the add-on array
storybook/addon-knobs.

13
00:00:48.652 --> 00:00:51.350
I'm gonna harp on that, cuz I've
forgotten that plenty of times, and

14
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.920
then sat there wondering
what the heck was going on.

15
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.395
So we add it to our array.

16
00:00:55.395 --> 00:00:59.629
This one's super easy, all we have to do
now, we have included our add-on, but

17
00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.330
we need to tell Storybook we wanna use it.

18
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.890
So, inside of our preview JS,
we need to register that as a decorator.

19
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.210
So addDecorator(withKnobs),
which we have to import.

20
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.549
So, you install your add-on,
you add it to the add-ons array,

21
00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.026
and then inside of preview JS you
import it, and add as a decorator.

22
00:01:19.026 --> 00:01:23.828
So, import withKnobs from

23
00:01:23.828 --> 00:01:29.474
@storybook/addon-knobs.

24
00:01:29.474 --> 00:01:33.090
Well, prettier.

25
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.182
Okay.

26
00:01:36.182 --> 00:01:41.120
So, you'll notice, if I just go refresh
this, it's not gonna show up, you,

27
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.512
actually every time you do an add-on,
need to stop and

28
00:01:44.512 --> 00:01:47.053
restart, it's kind of a pain the butt.

29
00:01:47.053 --> 00:01:49.140
But hopefully that doesn't take too long.

30
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.117
And what this is going to do.

31
00:01:52.117 --> 00:01:55.540
Well, actually, this isn't working because
I didn't actually do anything with it.

32
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.370
So that might also be part of the problem.

33
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.380
We actually need to tell the Knob
what are we gonna be changing,

34
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.660
what do you want this to be used for.

35
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.840
So back in buttons, let's import it.

36
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.770
So let's import withKnobs, and
I'm also gonna import boolean.

37
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.420
So I wanna actually toggle
the disabled state of my buttons and

38
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.640
see if those are working, and
those are gonna be true or false value.

39
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.150
So, from storybook/addon-knobs.

40
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.830
Once you've imported that,
we can actually set that as a property.

41
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.060
So on my primary button,
let's set a disabled attribute, right?

42
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.770
This is gonna be boolean,
that's why we imported boolean.

43
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.580
And, what label do we want this to have?

44
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.360
The first argument here is our label,
so, this can be whatever you want.

45
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.633
We're gonna toggle Disabled, and
we'll initialize it to false, so

46
00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:43.970
that's the initial value.

47
00:02:49.934 --> 00:02:53.525
This one actually did show up without
having to restart, that's exciting,

48
00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:55.140
we're making progress.

49
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.048
So, you should see down
here our Knobs tab.

50
00:02:59.048 --> 00:03:02.453
And if I click Disabled,
you can see our button is now disabled,

51
00:03:02.453 --> 00:03:05.140
it has all of our disabled states, okay?

52
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.212
You can use Knobs for
a bunch of different things.

53
00:03:07.212 --> 00:03:10.430
Generally you wanna be explicit, and
just create stories for different states.

54
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.070
Like if you have a warning button,

55
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.840
you wouldn't create a Knob that
you can select different states,

56
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.140
actually create stories for
these things, it's a lot more explicit.

57
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.723
&gt;&gt; Do you sometimes make
a kitchen sink style example?

58
00:03:22.723 --> 00:03:26.164
Where you just turn all the Knobs on and
let people fiddle however they want, or

59
00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:27.860
has that not turned out well?

60
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.160
&gt;&gt; I haven't, but when I was speaking with
the Storybook, one of the core members,

61
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.650
he suggested actually being very
conservative with using Knobs.

62
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.494
And actually just to be more
explicit with your stories, so.

63
00:03:39.494 --> 00:03:42.546
Having all these different examples,
it's tedious, but

64
00:03:42.546 --> 00:03:45.552
he actually suggested that
was better than having Knobs.

65
00:03:45.552 --> 00:03:48.060
Yeah, good question.
