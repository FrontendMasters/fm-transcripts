00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.010
So, what you're gonna do now
is go into your starter.

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.340
Your project not my template,
but your project and

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.090
we've got these five rectangles here.

4
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.960
You can hover over them you'll see them.

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.390
We're gonna fill these with color.

6
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.650
So if you double click these,

7
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.710
you have to double click it
cuz right now it's a group.

8
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.550
So it has a label, it has two labels or
two texts fields and a square.

9
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.120
So double click it,
it'll highlight that square.

10
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.790
Okay, so grab a hex value from
your palette once you find it.

11
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.970
If I'm talking too quickly or you need
a reference, you can go find that,

12
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.180
it's under creating a color palette.

13
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.960
So when you highlight that square, you're
gonna come over here to this right side it

14
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.740
says fill, okay,
you're gonna paste in that hex code there.

15
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.850
You can also double click this label and
kind of just update that so

16
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.440
it actually reflects the correct label.

17
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.840
And I'm just gonna copy it over.

18
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.117
Let's just copy over some colors.

19
00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:15.308
Now if your shade is a little darker,

20
00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:19.440
like this one, you can see this black
text is maybe a little bit too dark.

21
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.431
Go ahead and
change that to white if you would like.

22
00:01:30.888 --> 00:01:35.049
Okay, so once we've now got our
color strokes and don't worry if

23
00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.580
I'm going too fast, you're gonna get
some time to work on this right now.

24
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.490
Once we've got these,

25
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.950
we're gonna turn them into actual assets
that we can use to build our components.

26
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.605
So what you're gonnado is you're gonna
double click again on the rectangle,

27
00:01:49.605 --> 00:01:50.850
you can see I've got my fill here.

28
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.140
If you look under fill to the right side,

29
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.970
there are these four little dots here for
this menu.

30
00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.450
You can click that and oops,
no I don't wanna add a gradient.

31
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.765
So you click this little menu here,
you'll see it says color styles and

32
00:02:05.765 --> 00:02:06.780
you add a plus.

33
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.890
So I wanna create a new color style.

34
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.560
I'm gonna call this, the same as my label.

35
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.590
So primary 200, okay?

36
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.135
You create your style.

37
00:02:13.135 --> 00:02:15.520
You're gonna do that for all of these.

38
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.330
So again, go to this little menu,
hit plus.

39
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.490
Just give it a name.

40
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.430
Again, you can call
this whatever you want.

41
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.659
I'm gonna stick with the primary dash and
then increments of 100.

42
00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.177
So add those in there.

43
00:02:28.177 --> 00:02:31.750
And once those are added and
make sure you do these down here too, so

44
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.370
when you copy over these art boards I
don't think it copied over the styles.

45
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.240
I'm gonna give you time to work on this.

46
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.090
And once you do that, the really,
really cool thing is if I go over here, or

47
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.000
I'll stay in colors, if I stay here and
I press R and I create a new rectangle,

48
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.170
I want to give this one
of my primary colors.

49
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.980
If I click this menu, look,
I've got all my colors here.

50
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.840
And so I can change it to red.

51
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.580
And now I can create another rectangle and
I can set this to red as well.

52
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.610
But now if I actually go and update this,
let's make this I don't know.

53
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.636
What's a hex code?

54
00:03:07.636 --> 00:03:10.704
Let's do 4AB.

55
00:03:10.704 --> 00:03:13.969
We change the color of this.

56
00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.270
I'll just copy one from down there,
737581.

57
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.450
Let's say I change this color,
you can update the color style and

58
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.020
it'll propagate now to
all of your components.

59
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.930
So, if you have gone through in creative
color styles for all of these, on this

60
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.690
right hand side bar, on this design tab
here, you should see them showing up.

61
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.350
So you can see color styles and
we've got all the list here.

62
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.530
And if you haven't gotten through adding
all those status colors or the neutrals,

63
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.390
that's okay, it's not a big deal.

64
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.760
You can work on that later.

65
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.130
All right, so this is what mine looks.

66
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.080
I'm excited to see what yours
all look like in the chat.

67
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.650
And with that, I think we're ready
to move on to the hypography.
