00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.237
So just a couple more add ons that we're
gonna use, these ones are pretty quick,

2
00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:04.602
they're not gonna be as heavy duty.

3
00:00:04.602 --> 00:00:06.430
So the first one is actions, and

4
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.680
actions are gonna allow you to
simulate different events in your UI.

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.083
So we have buttons, let's go ahead and
add a couple of options to those.

6
00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:19.853
Inside main.js you can see add on actions
is actually already installed with

7
00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.816
storybook so that's really good
we don't need to add that.

8
00:00:22.816 --> 00:00:26.140
What we can do now let's go
into our Button Stories and on

9
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.048
Primary button first of all first we need
to import it or else it's not gonna work.

10
00:00:31.048 --> 00:00:35.587
So import { action } from
"@storybook" also if you're getting

11
00:00:35.587 --> 00:00:40.123
errors make sure all your story
books haven't at sign before them,

12
00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:42.370
I did make that mistake already.

13
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.488
And it's going to import from
add on actions with an S, And,

14
00:00:50.488 --> 00:00:55.709
now we can actually go and
simulate a click, so unclick.

15
00:00:55.709 --> 00:01:00.489
Let's simulate an action and let's say
let's simulate a button click a button,

16
00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.130
click [LAUGH] a button click, Okay?

17
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.091
So on our primary button, anytime you
click it, lets simulate that, And

18
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:12.334
if you look down here,
we've got our little Actions panel, and

19
00:01:12.334 --> 00:01:15.593
if you click our primary button,
we can simulate those clicks.

20
00:01:15.593 --> 00:01:18.602
There's not much going on in here,
it's simulating a DOM event, but

21
00:01:18.602 --> 00:01:21.768
you can use this to test the functionality
of your different components.

22
00:01:21.768 --> 00:01:24.471
So like if you have a text field for
example,

23
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:29.532
with an on change that actually validates
the data being passed in you can do that.

24
00:01:29.532 --> 00:01:32.803
Like if you have the error
state depicted as a red border,

25
00:01:32.803 --> 00:01:34.720
this is a great way to check that.
