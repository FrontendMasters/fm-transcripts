00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.039
Let's talk about typography.

2
00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:04.530
Let's go over some terminology.

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:10.472
So an ascender is the piece of the letter
that actually rises above the x-height.

4
00:00:10.472 --> 00:00:14.643
So we've got these two lines that kinda
set boundaries on our different font

5
00:00:14.643 --> 00:00:15.306
families.

6
00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:16.852
And anything that rises
above's called an ascender.

7
00:00:19.549 --> 00:00:20.750
And on the opposite side,

8
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.759
anything that dips below that
bottom line is called a descender.

9
00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:30.611
The baseline is just that imaginary
line that our letters are gonna sit on.

10
00:00:30.611 --> 00:00:34.506
And the cap line is the one
that comes right above it.

11
00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:38.156
So we've got our cap line, our baseline,
our ascenders and our descenders,

12
00:00:38.156 --> 00:00:39.661
which go above and below those.

13
00:00:41.972 --> 00:00:45.652
The x-height is just gonna be the height
of the typeface's lowercase letters.

14
00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:53.365
Tracking is actually the uniform
amounts of spacing between characters.

15
00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:56.724
So you can see here we've got some normal
tracking, and we've got some tight

16
00:00:56.724 --> 00:01:00.098
tracking that reduces the letter spacing,
and we've got looser tracking.

17
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.159
You might have heard of kerning
if you work with developers.

18
00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.715
Kerning is the horizontal
spacing between two characters.

19
00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:13.515
And you might hear too, this,
this font family has terrible kerning,

20
00:01:13.515 --> 00:01:14.643
we can't use it.

21
00:01:14.643 --> 00:01:15.944
So that's what they're talking about.

22
00:01:18.502 --> 00:01:21.146
Now this is not called leading,
it's called letting,

23
00:01:21.146 --> 00:01:23.915
which is very confusing if
you've not heard that before.

24
00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:25.697
It's just the vertical space in
between lines, so line spacing.

25
00:01:25.697 --> 00:01:29.606
So we've got normal leading there,
tight leading and loose leading.

26
00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:33.001
And actually, if you have super tight
leading or super loose leading,

27
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.275
it's gonna be harder for
your users to read it.

28
00:01:35.275 --> 00:01:38.592
If you have really loose leading,
or if you have really wide text,

29
00:01:38.592 --> 00:01:40.857
it's gonna actually cause some eye strain.

30
00:01:40.857 --> 00:01:45.070
I don't remember the actual pixel amount,
but there is a specific width after which

31
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.100
if you go longer, if you have really long
paragraphs of text on your interfaces,

32
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.371
it's hard for
your users to keep reading it.

33
00:01:51.371 --> 00:01:52.434
It's gonna strain their eyes.
