1
00:00:00.057 --> 00:00:01.832
We're gonna go create a theme.

2
00:00:01.832 --> 00:00:06.880
So we have our colors file,
where we have blue, green, yellow, red.

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.966
These ain't very semantic, they don't
really tell us what is being used for

4
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.444
what element or what piece of our UI.

5
00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:14.632
So that's where themes
are really gonna come in.

6
00:00:14.632 --> 00:00:20.194
So I'm gonna open themes.js,
we're gonna create a theme.

7
00:00:20.194 --> 00:00:24.900
We're gonna just create a default theme,
so export const defaultTheme,

8
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.078
you can call it whatever you like.

9
00:00:27.078 --> 00:00:30.810
It's gonna be an object, and
we're gonna throw some values in here.

10
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.710
Before I do that, I'm just gonna import
a couple of things that we just created.

11
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.270
So I'm gonna import my blue palette and
my neutral palette.

12
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.510
If your primary color is red, import red.

13
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.310
If it's pink, import pink.

14
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.580
And these are gonna come
from our colors file.

15
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.484
I'm also gonna import my primaryFont,
I'm gonna wanna use that, so

16
00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:56.551
primaryFont, typography, okay?

17
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:58.600
So what do I wanna add here?

18
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.884
Well, I wanna know what
my primary color is.

19
00:01:00.884 --> 00:01:03.573
My primary color is gonna be my blue,
my 300 value.

20
00:01:03.573 --> 00:01:07.585
Yours might be something different, but
this is what mine's gonna look like.

21
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.612
I'm also gonna want to kind of
remember the hover color maybe and

22
00:01:13.612 --> 00:01:14.544
the active color.

23
00:01:14.544 --> 00:01:17.130
So let's do primaryColorHover.

24
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.282
Mine is gonna go lighter so
I'm gonna do blue 200, go a shade lighter.

25
00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:30.760
On primaryColorActive,
I'm gonna do the lightest color.

26
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.604
Or this is the darkest color,
mine go darker,

27
00:01:34.604 --> 00:01:39.049
mine go the other way, so
it's gonna be blue 100.

28
00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.774
It's yelling at me cuz I'm
using semicolons in an object.

29
00:01:42.774 --> 00:01:46.581
Now I wanna know what textColor needs
to be on top of my primaryColor.

30
00:01:46.581 --> 00:01:50.037
So if you have a very dark primaryColor,
you're gonna want white, maybe,

31
00:01:50.037 --> 00:01:50.960
as your textColor.

32
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.031
If you have a very light primaryColor,
you're gonna want a very dark textColor.

33
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:59.520
So textColorOnPrimary, mine is gonna
be neutral 100, which is just a white.

34
00:02:03.163 --> 00:02:06.668
For text color that's not on a primary
if it's just on a background,

35
00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:10.789
textColor, I'm just gonna set it to
neutral 600, which is a very deep gray.

36
00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:19.772
How about text that's on a very light
background, I'm gonna want a dark color.

37
00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:26.676
So I'm gonna do textColorInverted,
And this is gonna be neutral 100.

38
00:02:28.923 --> 00:02:31.775
And then the last one
is just my primaryFont.

39
00:02:31.775 --> 00:02:36.204
So, you could write like this, but
because it's the same value for both,

40
00:02:36.204 --> 00:02:38.685
we can actually just shorten it.

41
00:02:38.685 --> 00:02:40.909
We can just write primaryFont, and

42
00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.774
it'll automatically assign
the value as the same as the key.

43
00:02:44.774 --> 00:02:47.214
So that's our theme, again,
you might have different variables, and

44
00:02:47.214 --> 00:02:48.015
that's totally fine.

45
00:02:50.633 --> 00:02:54.825
The last thing that we're gonna do is,
we've got these three JavaScript files in

46
00:02:54.825 --> 00:02:57.326
our utility folder, and
that's totally fine.

47
00:02:57.326 --> 00:02:59.120
But let's do something to
make that a little easier.

48
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.262
Let's create a file called index.js,

49
00:03:01.262 --> 00:03:04.730
and we're just gonna export
everything from these three files.

50
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.518
So export * from ./colors,

51
00:03:08.518 --> 00:03:13.326
do export * from ./typography, and

52
00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:18.000
we'll do export * from ./themes.

53
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.018
Okay, why are we doing this?

54
00:03:23.698 --> 00:03:27.730
Does anyone know why we might wanna
do this, over just importing and

55
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.580
exporting the regular files?

56
00:03:33.104 --> 00:03:38.277
So if we didn't have this index file,
what I would have to do is import

57
00:03:38.277 --> 00:03:43.275
primaryFont from,
if I'm on my components folder, let's say,

58
00:03:43.275 --> 00:03:48.120
I'd have to go up a directory into utils,
and go to typography.

59
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.672
And that's totally fine, you can do that.

60
00:03:51.672 --> 00:03:56.722
But it's a lot nicer if we could just
import things from utils, isn't it?

61
00:03:56.722 --> 00:04:00.559
So I can import primaryFont,
I can import blue,

62
00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:05.400
I can import defaultTheme, and
I can do this all from utils.

63
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.920
I don't have to go into color,
I don't have to go into typography, so

64
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.262
that's why we've done it this way.

65
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:16.190
So let's go use this,
let's go use our theme.

66
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.102
Let's go to buttons.js again.

67
00:04:19.883 --> 00:04:22.330
So right now,
we have this hardcoded value.

68
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.742
Let's use our theme instead,
that sounds a lot better.

69
00:04:25.742 --> 00:04:32.787
So let's import that, import defaultTheme,
again, this is going from utils.

70
00:04:32.787 --> 00:04:37.002
I'm also gonna want our typeScale, so

71
00:04:37.002 --> 00:04:43.660
I'm gonna add this to the same import,
so typeScale, okay?

72
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.191
So that means we can get
rid of this constant.

73
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:47.050
We don't need this anymore,
we're gonna use our theme.

74
00:04:50.374 --> 00:04:53.697
So I've set font-size here to 1rem,
we can replace that now.

75
00:04:53.697 --> 00:04:59.772
So we can say default, wait, I'm sorry,
typeScale, typeScale.paragraph.

76
00:05:01.363 --> 00:05:04.954
And anything that was using this primary
blue, I'm gonna highlight it and

77
00:05:04.954 --> 00:05:07.753
press Cmd+D to highlight every
single instance of that.

78
00:05:07.753 --> 00:05:14.150
It's gonna be defaultTheme.primaryColor,
okay?

79
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.809
So we're replacing that constant we
just got rid of with our defaultTheme

80
00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:18.642
primaryColor.

81
00:05:22.732 --> 00:05:25.439
So if I go back, everything still looks
the same, which is really, really good.

82
00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:27.707
So we just got rid of
our hardcoded values,

83
00:05:27.707 --> 00:05:31.050
and we used them from our theme
inside of our styled component.
