00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.900
I'm gonna show you a way that you
can actually customize Storybook,

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.610
the appearance of your storybook,
to fit with your brand identity,

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.518
which is really cool.

4
00:00:06.518 --> 00:00:09.915
If you're gonna publish this as your style
guide, you can actually customize it so

5
00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:10.990
it looks like your brand.

6
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.895
So I have on the website
a lot of code snippets here.

7
00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:22.925
I'm going to actually just copy and
paste from here.

8
00:00:22.925 --> 00:00:27.160
These are different variables that you can
use to change your font, the color of it.

9
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.320
I've already done this just
to save a little bit of time.

10
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.165
But feel free to go in and play around
with these different configurations.

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.449
The first thing that we need to
do is just create one more file.

12
00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.610
So let's, in our storybook folder here,
create a manager.js file.

13
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.200
And we need to import our themes.

14
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.890
So themes actually come
built in with Storybook and

15
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.740
they have different
themes that you can use.

16
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.560
Okay, so inside of manager.js,
we're gonna import two things.

17
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:02.750
So import { addons }, first and
foremost, from "@storybook/addons".

18
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.890
And the second thing is import {
themes } from "@storybook/theming".

19
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.430
So once we've imported those couple of
things, let's actually go ahead and

20
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.708
pick a theme that we want to use.

21
00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:20.590
So let's addons.setConfig().

22
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.020
Takes an object.
And we just want to set our theme.

23
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.390
So let's do themes.dark.

24
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.250
Let's set a dark theme.

25
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.840
Okay, and
if we go back to our Storybook instance,

26
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.830
you can see now that this is dark theme.

27
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.041
If we change this to light,
we have the light theme if I refresh.

28
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.780
You can actually create
a fully custom theme.

29
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.570
So let's do that really quickly.

30
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.935
Inside of Storybook,
you can create a new file.

31
00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:46.300
I'm just going to call it myTheme.js.

32
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.698
And I've already typed all this
out on the course website.

33
00:01:49.698 --> 00:01:50.656
I'm just gonna copy and paste in.

34
00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:52.610
There are a bunch of different settings.

35
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.230
So you can go change the font,
the colors, all that kind of stuff.

36
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.080
So I've saved this under my theme.

37
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.655
And back inside manager,
let's actually go ahead and import it.

38
00:02:04.655 --> 00:02:06.467
So I'm gonna import.

39
00:02:06.467 --> 00:02:07.348
Get rid of this.
We're not gonna use

40
00:02:07.348 --> 00:02:08.450
the preconfigured themes.

41
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.462
import myTheme from "./myTheme".

42
00:02:11.462 --> 00:02:14.692
And all we need to do is just set
that here as our theme variable.

43
00:02:19.538 --> 00:02:22.390
And if I go back,
now you can see it's really pretty.

44
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.260
So this is how you can
kind of customize things.

45
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.380
So feel free to take a look through
all of these different arguments.

46
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.170
You might not want hot pink for
your brand, but

47
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.880
if you do you've got the option.
