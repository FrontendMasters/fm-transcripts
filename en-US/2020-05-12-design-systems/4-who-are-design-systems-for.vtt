00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.670
And this kind of begs the question,
who are designs systems for?

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.090
And Chris Coyer wrote
an article in CSS Tricks, and

3
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.640
he said if a design system is by
a company it's for that company.

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.810
So it might be open source, but

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.400
any old random developer who wants to
use it is not the target audience.

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.020
We actually open source our
systems to share knowledge.

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.670
So while I technically could go and
I could integrate IBM Carbon into my

8
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.310
personal blog and style it like an IBM
product, I wouldn't necessarily do that.

9
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.675
It's possible, but
that's not the primary purpose.
