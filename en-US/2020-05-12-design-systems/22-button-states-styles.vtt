00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.154
So we had mentioned button states before,
yhere's a lot of them, and this can be

2
00:00:05.154 --> 00:00:09.763
a little confusing, and so I've created
a little chart for you to fill in.

3
00:00:09.763 --> 00:00:12.978
Let's quickly talk about different
types of buttons before we do that.

4
00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:16.612
Your buttons should, first and foremost,
look and function like buttons, right?

5
00:00:16.612 --> 00:00:17.480
That's the biggest thing.

6
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.744
There are different styles you can apply.

7
00:00:18.744 --> 00:00:21.720
You can have completely
perpendicular edges.

8
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.780
You can have ones with small
amount of border radius.

9
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.030
You can have full border radius.

10
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.082
You could have a drop shadow, but they
need to look and function like a button.

11
00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:33.190
So we've got solid buttons.

12
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.900
No surprise here.

13
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.100
They're just filled with
a solid background.

14
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.060
These are pretty industry standard.

15
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.980
This is, you would look at this and
know it's a button.

16
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.500
You might have heard of ghost buttons or
line buttons.

17
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.940
That just means that they don't
have a solid background fill.

18
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.820
I'm gonna show you an example of mine,
my secondary buttons are ghost buttons.

19
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.540
Typically, the filled buttons are primary
buttons because they draw the most

20
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.740
attention.

21
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.620
And actually, I heard during a conference
that squared edges on buttons actually

22
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.900
draw the user's attention more than
rounded border radius buttons like round

23
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.210
buttons because there's more pixels for
the user's eye to be drawn to.

24
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.260
So that's just an interesting, fun fact.

25
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.920
But ghost buttons yeah, you would
typically see for a secondary button.

26
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.162
We have icon buttons,

27
00:01:15.162 --> 00:01:18.660
so there are ones without labels
which you need to add some aria to.

28
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.290
Because without labels,

29
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.200
assistive technology does not
know what this is going to do.

30
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.240
If you can use a label,
use a label please.

31
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.687
We'll talk about that when
we actually code these.

32
00:01:32.475 --> 00:01:34.270
So button styles.

33
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.628
So border radius,
we all know border radius probably.

34
00:01:36.628 --> 00:01:41.573
These are gonna be a little bit more
playful than a traditional 90 degree

35
00:01:41.573 --> 00:01:44.060
perpendicular button edge.

36
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.030
But think back to your brand identity,
think back to your design principles.

37
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.340
If you wanna be bold and energetic,
maybe border radius is fun to incorporate.

38
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.960
If you're building something
that's very professional,

39
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.820
you might want to stick with square edges.

40
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.920
Drop shadow is also cool.

41
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.320
These give your buttons elevation.

42
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.170
There is, Scott Tolinski made a great
course about style components,

43
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.370
design systems, and
he talked about elevation.

44
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.492
You can have an elevation, library,
utility function which is really fun and

45
00:02:14.492 --> 00:02:16.126
can give your buttons height.

46
00:02:16.126 --> 00:02:19.160
You can also implement the on hover and
focus to indicate a state change.

47
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.720
Let's talk about labels.

48
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.990
We all love uppercase text, but
it's really hard for our users to read.

49
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.280
Much harder to read than title case.

50
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.985
So if you can use title case,
I would recommend using title case.

51
00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.958
And your labels need to fit
with the color contrast ratio,

52
00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.421
they need to be accessible.

53
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:39.942
So you can see those bottom one is
really hard for our users to see.

54
00:02:39.942 --> 00:02:45.520
It does not pass
the WCAG AA color contrast.

55
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.380
And also when we're talking fonts for
this, make sure it's thick enough.

56
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.460
If you have a very, very thin font,
it's not gonna be recognizable.

57
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.472
The whole goal is if you were to turn
off the color and decrease contrast,

58
00:02:56.472 --> 00:02:59.512
you should still be able to
read your button and your UI.

59
00:03:02.214 --> 00:03:04.854
So buttons need to be large
enough to be clickable and

60
00:03:04.854 --> 00:03:07.340
accessible on mobile devices.

61
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.760
And so you need to make sure that they
have enough padding or enough width and

62
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.490
height to do so.

63
00:03:13.882 --> 00:03:16.310
So a default button might have
eight pixels top and bottom.

64
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.026
Padding, a small might have 4 and
a large might have 16.

65
00:03:19.026 --> 00:03:23.545
When I create our design system at work,
I use multiples of 4,

66
00:03:23.545 --> 00:03:26.550
increments of 4, for spacing.

67
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.650
It plays very nicely and so you can
see here we've got multiples of 4 for

68
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.827
our top and bottom padding.

69
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.092
And horizontal padding,

70
00:03:34.092 --> 00:03:36.621
you can add a horizontal padding
to keep them responsive.

71
00:03:36.621 --> 00:03:39.428
So if you set a width,
it's not gonna be responsive but

72
00:03:39.428 --> 00:03:42.250
if you set padding,
it's gonna be a little bit nicer.

73
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.140
It's gonna play a little nicer.

74
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.050
You can set minimum
widths on these as well.

75
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.780
So if you have just an icon button,
you can make it min width 100 pixels, so

76
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.170
it's not gonna be super tiny,
still accessible.
