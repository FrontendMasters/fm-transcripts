1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.930
I'm gonna go ahead and
add state for my buttons.

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.758
So, the first thing I need to
do is go back into my theme.

3
00:00:05.758 --> 00:00:07.340
So themes js.

4
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.430
And I need to add a couple of
different additional variables.

5
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.300
So, I need to say what my
disabled background color and

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.410
my disabled text color
are going to look like.

7
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.000
So I'm gonna add disabled neutral [400].

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.058
And text on disabled is
gonna be neutral [300].

9
00:00:24.058 --> 00:00:26.420
Now, Bryan asked a really
good question on the break.

10
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.160
And he said, are you gonna be,
just putting this all top level,

11
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.600
or are you gonna be nesting some of them?

12
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.510
That's a great question,
these are gonna be top level.

13
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.770
But you'll see once we get to status,

14
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.340
that we're actually in a nest
those inside of a status object.

15
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.090
So, you can definitely
break these up by textile,

16
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.070
by font, by color, things like that.

17
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.860
So feel free to do that.

18
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.280
Okay, so I have two different values
that I've just added for the disabled.

19
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.280
And I'm gonna add these
to my button component.

20
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.810
So on focus.

21
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.700
I'm going to add an outline of
three pixels solid, default theme,

22
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.290
primary color hover.

23
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.790
Gosh.

24
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.220
Those are confusing.

25
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.340
And I'm also going to give this an offset.

26
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.660
So, if you look at my design here, you'll

27
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.790
notice that I have this space
between my button and the outline.

28
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.820
So, I want that offset.

29
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.450
I want it by 3 pixels.

30
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.920
Offset 3 pixels.

31
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.119
2 pixels, I'm sorry, 2 pixels.

32
00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.930
For active,
mine just got a shade darker, I believe.

33
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.270
So active, I'm gonna set background color.

34
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.730
I'm gonna set this to
defaultTheme.primaryActiveColor.

35
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.500
Primary color,
that's really gonna confuse me.

36
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.018
Let me quickly go back to themes,
primaryColorActive, primaryColorActive.

37
00:01:57.018 --> 00:01:59.970
In my notes, I said primaryHoverColor.

38
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.530
I'm gonna change these so
they match my note.

39
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.880
So, primaryHoverColor.

40
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.533
Otherwise we're gonna get mixed up.

41
00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:10.607
PrimaryActiveColor.

42
00:02:10.607 --> 00:02:14.367
I obviously have to change those.

43
00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:17.881
PrimaryHoverColor.

44
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:20.589
PrimaryActiveColor, that should be good.

45
00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:21.972
If something breaks, we'll fix it, okay?

46
00:02:21.972 --> 00:02:25.372
So I'm setting my background color.

47
00:02:25.372 --> 00:02:30.768
I'm gonna set a border-color
as well to primaryActiveColor.

48
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.399
ActiveColor.

49
00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:38.006
And then I'm just going to
set the color of the text.

50
00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:45.672
DefaultTheme.textColorOnPrimary.

51
00:02:45.672 --> 00:02:48.553
Now, if you notice my disabled states,

52
00:02:48.553 --> 00:02:52.935
I mentioned this before
the break that minor different.

53
00:02:52.935 --> 00:02:56.459
So, in order to do that, I can't just
set that on the base button component.

54
00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.616
I need to actually go in and
style the individual buttons.

55
00:02:58.616 --> 00:03:05.752
So disabled On my primary,
it's gonna be a background-color.

56
00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.572
So background-color.

57
00:03:07.572 --> 00:03:12.053
And we're gonna use my new disabled
color I just added to my theme.

58
00:03:12.053 --> 00:03:17.212
DefaultTheme.textOnDisabled.

59
00:03:17.212 --> 00:03:23.060
And then,
I am gonna set cursor to not-allowed.

60
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.047
So, if I hover over this,
it's gonna tell me no, you can't do that.

61
00:03:25.047 --> 00:03:28.663
I'm gonna copy this into
my secondary button.

62
00:03:28.663 --> 00:03:33.436
So, on my secondary button,
my color is not gonna be textOnDisabled

63
00:03:33.436 --> 00:03:37.340
because it's just sitting
on this background here.

64
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.220
So there's no background color.

65
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.535
So this is just gonna be disabled.

66
00:03:40.535 --> 00:03:42.853
We're not gonna have a background color.

67
00:03:42.853 --> 00:03:44.674
So I'm gonna explicitly set that to none.

68
00:03:44.674 --> 00:03:49.361
And then we will leave
the cursor not-allowed.

69
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:54.243
Let me just throw this once more
on our Tertiarybutton here.

70
00:03:54.243 --> 00:03:55.399
Again, no background color.

71
00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:59.217
The color is gonna be disabled and
cursor not-allowed.

72
00:03:59.217 --> 00:04:04.238
And if I test this,
let's go back to index.js.

73
00:04:04.238 --> 00:04:06.730
I'm just gonna highlight here.

74
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.660
I'm gonna press, what is it, command?

75
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.336
No, option click.

76
00:04:10.336 --> 00:04:14.623
If you press option and click,
you can have multiple cursors.

77
00:04:14.623 --> 00:04:18.641
I'm gonna do that and
I'm just gonna write disabled.

78
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:23.003
So, when I come back here ideally,
that should work as expected.

79
00:04:25.788 --> 00:04:29.991
The one thing I did
forget is the border on

80
00:04:29.991 --> 00:04:34.824
the Secondarybutton
needs a disabled color.

81
00:04:34.824 --> 00:04:38.196
So let me set that.

82
00:04:38.196 --> 00:04:44.550
So border-color do defaultTheme.disabled.

83
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.691
So, now this is gray and
it shouldn't be allowed.

84
00:04:48.691 --> 00:04:50.325
Our hovers are still being applied.

85
00:04:53.405 --> 00:04:59.122
So, what happened here is, in here
I'm seeing background color of none.

86
00:04:59.122 --> 00:05:01.466
And actually, we just don't want
any background on disabled.

87
00:05:01.466 --> 00:05:05.554
We don't want that to have any
background on hover or focus, okay?

88
00:05:05.554 --> 00:05:06.838
That was the difference.
