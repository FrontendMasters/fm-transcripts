00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:02.044
So let's implement some button states.

2
00:00:02.044 --> 00:00:04.762
So we designed our hover, focus,
active, and disabled states.

3
00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:09.006
Now let's actually code them,
so open buttons.

4
00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:16.496
And If you notice, on my design,
let me go back to that real quickly.

5
00:00:18.363 --> 00:00:21.485
On my design, you can see here,
make this big.

6
00:00:23.432 --> 00:00:26.896
For my primary, secondary,
and tertiary buttons here,

7
00:00:26.896 --> 00:00:30.310
they all have the same hover,
focus, and active state.

8
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.596
The disabled state's gonna be
different cuz essentially,

9
00:00:32.596 --> 00:00:36.050
we're taking our neutral state,
and we're just making it disabled.

10
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.731
But my hover, focus, and
active are all the same styling.

11
00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:43.958
So for me, because that's the case, I'm
gonna add all of this on the base button.

12
00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.349
So that our primary, secondary, and
tertiary are just gonna inherit those.

13
00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:50.840
But if you have different styling for
your different states of your buttons,

14
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.534
you're gonna wanna add those
to your individual buttons.

15
00:00:55.761 --> 00:01:00.120
So we can still nest our CSS,
which is really great.

16
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.383
So on hover,
I'm gonna set my background-color

17
00:01:05.383 --> 00:01:09.777
to my defaultTheme primary HoverColor.

18
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.123
And I'm gonna set the color of the text
to defaultTheme textColorOnPrimary.

19
00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:23.838
I'm also gonna add a transition here.

20
00:01:23.838 --> 00:01:26.575
This is gonna help with
animating the state change.

21
00:01:26.575 --> 00:01:31.481
So transition,
I'm gonna transition background-color,

22
00:01:31.481 --> 00:01:33.630
I'm gonna give it a 0.2 second duration.

23
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.480
And I'm gonna do just
a linear timing function.

24
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.219
So it's gonna maintain the same
animation across our whole 0.2 seconds.

25
00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:46.061
And in our new color, same thing,
0.2, and I forgot the s here, so

26
00:01:46.061 --> 00:01:48.783
0.2 seconds, and again, linear.

27
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:59.096
And so if I come back now, and I hover
over, something is going horribly wrong.

28
00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:01.780
&gt;&gt; Did you call primaryColorHover?

29
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.628
&gt;&gt; primaryColorHover,
I think you're right.

30
00:02:04.628 --> 00:02:06.414
So we can see our transition's happening,
and

31
00:02:06.414 --> 00:02:08.921
they're all inheriting because
we've put it on our base button.

32
00:02:08.921 --> 00:02:13.402
And I want you to do the focus,
active, and disabled states.

33
00:02:13.402 --> 00:02:20.021
So anything that you have in your figma
here, hover, focus, active, and disabled.

34
00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:22.820
Do those for your secondary and
tertiary buttons as well as primary,

35
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.134
cuz we only did the hover state.
