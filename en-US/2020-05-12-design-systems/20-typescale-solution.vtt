00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.081
What is your view on combining different
typographies for headers versus body text?

2
00:00:05.081 --> 00:00:05.702
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

3
00:00:05.702 --> 00:00:06.615
That's a great question.

4
00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:10.191
So should you have more
than one font family?

5
00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:12.360
The answer is yeah,
you can absolutely have more than one.

6
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.155
I wouldn't do more than three maximum.

7
00:00:15.155 --> 00:00:18.438
Typically, what you would
do is see combinations of

8
00:00:18.438 --> 00:00:20.830
a sans serif header with a serif font.

9
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.865
For example,
you want them to be differentiated enough.

10
00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:29.865
I'm gonna go back to fonts.google.com and
show you that if you click on a font,

11
00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:34.470
they typically will do pairings,
I forget where they put it.

12
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.788
If you select it, I think they do
suggest the pairings with this font.

13
00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:40.181
I forget where it is.

14
00:00:40.181 --> 00:00:45.747
But Google has an option to actually
check out different font family pairings.

15
00:00:45.747 --> 00:00:49.999
So yeah, you would pair maybe a sans serif
header with a serif font or a serif header

16
00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:53.719
with a sans serif body text and
maybe some monospace for code snippets.

17
00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.371
But never pick more than three.

18
00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:57.514
It's going to be a little hard for
your users.

19
00:00:57.514 --> 00:01:01.351
&gt;&gt; And at what point on the H1
through H5 do all the headers,

20
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:06.281
are they all gonna be consistent or,
as they go down, do you have a breaking

21
00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:10.769
point where this isn't considered
a header for differentiation?

22
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.805
Would I go H1 through H5 as a serif
font and then just my paragraph,

23
00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:19.632
helper text and copyright as a sans serif?

24
00:01:19.632 --> 00:01:23.142
&gt;&gt; Yeah, any body text is going to be
probably all the same font family, so

25
00:01:23.142 --> 00:01:25.789
you need helper text,
legal text, paragraph text.

26
00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.966
Any headers, so H1 through H5 or H6,
as someone pointed out in the chat.

27
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:33.470
I only did through H5 cuz that's all
that type scale generator gave me, but

28
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.183
you could totally have another one.

29
00:01:35.183 --> 00:01:38.002
Keep all your headers
the same font family,

30
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:40.831
keep all of your body and
copy text the same.

31
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:42.561
Yeah, great question.

32
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:44.342
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

33
00:01:44.342 --> 00:01:48.075
&gt;&gt; Awesome, so yeah, I don't know
where the font pairing is on Google,

34
00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:50.181
but it definitely exists, I promise.

35
00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:52.488
You should go check that
out at some point when.

36
00:01:52.488 --> 00:01:54.740
I can link that,
I'll link that in my teacher notes.
