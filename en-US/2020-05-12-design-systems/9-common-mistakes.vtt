00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.936
Let's examine some common mistakes, these
are mistakes that I've made personally.

2
00:00:04.936 --> 00:00:09.893
So this is learn from my mistakes,
the first is starting for scale.

3
00:00:09.893 --> 00:00:10.949
So while scaling,

4
00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:15.305
the ability to scale is really good if you
start out trying to code and design for

5
00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:19.402
every possible situation,
you're just gonna get really overwhelmed.

6
00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:24.143
And I did this at my current company
because we've got a lot of products, and

7
00:00:24.143 --> 00:00:29.032
a lot of end-points like iOS, Android,
and we started building for scale and

8
00:00:29.032 --> 00:00:31.495
we got very overwhelmed very quickly.

9
00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:32.893
So only scale when you need to.

10
00:00:35.372 --> 00:00:38.765
I also made this mistake which
is educating before you build,

11
00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:43.401
engineers and designers get really excited
when you show them a toolkit that they can

12
00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:46.030
use to quickly prototype or
quickly build UIs.

13
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.790
But if there's nothing for them to
use today, this is all just theory,

14
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.400
they're not gonna be happy with you, and

15
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.317
I can actually kind of act negatively
impact your relationship with them.

16
00:00:53.317 --> 00:00:57.735
So have something to discuss before you
educate on the system you're building.

17
00:01:00.743 --> 00:01:02.792
When you're working with other people,

18
00:01:02.792 --> 00:01:05.837
especially if you're working
across different time zones or

19
00:01:05.837 --> 00:01:10.182
remotely discussing workflows big, how do
you want to handle new component requests?

20
00:01:10.182 --> 00:01:11.875
How do you want to actually collaborate?

21
00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:14.229
Do you wanna have weekly meetings,
bi-weekly meetings,

22
00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.491
common terms on these things before you
start, it's gonna save you a lot of time.

23
00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:23.278
And the last is not documenting decisions.

24
00:01:23.278 --> 00:01:26.010
Again, I made this problem where
we would make decisions and

25
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.602
we wouldn't document it and either we
would forget why we made that decision and

26
00:01:29.602 --> 00:01:31.544
we couldn't back it up when we were asked.

27
00:01:31.544 --> 00:01:35.566
Or we spent a lot of time communicating
these decisions to individual stakeholders

28
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:36.722
who would come and ask.

29
00:01:36.722 --> 00:01:41.150
So having is documented, having your
priorities documented is very important,

30
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.762
it'll save you a lot of time.

31
00:01:45.894 --> 00:01:49.979
Okay, that is a very high level
introduction to design systems, so

32
00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.144
are there any questions
before we jump into design?

33
00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:58.611
&gt;&gt; I have a question.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

34
00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:03.400
&gt;&gt; You were talking about a checklist
of the unsigned system, right?

35
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.665
Do you have a priority list of like,
say more first or accessibility first?

36
00:02:10.665 --> 00:02:17.663
And like that kind of puts the theme
when you're deciding system basically.

37
00:02:17.663 --> 00:02:20.978
&gt;&gt; Like kind of what's the most
important things that has to have?

38
00:02:20.978 --> 00:02:24.232
This is gonna be individual to your team,
it's gonna depend.

39
00:02:24.232 --> 00:02:27.242
So for us,
our initiative right now is accessibility,

40
00:02:27.242 --> 00:02:30.443
if our components are not usable,
we can't ship them, but

41
00:02:30.443 --> 00:02:33.720
maybe browser compatibility can
be lower on the totem pole.

42
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.205
So I would talk with your team and

43
00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:38.836
kind of figure out what's your biggest
priority in terms of have to haves, and

44
00:02:38.836 --> 00:02:42.101
what are just kinda like nice to have,
features for your components.
