00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.510
So some of the drawbacks
of design systems is time.

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.690
Time is a big one.

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.882
Rome was not built in a day, your design
system is not going to be either.

4
00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:12.753
It's gonna take time and I'm not talking
a couple of weeks, a couple of months.

5
00:00:12.753 --> 00:00:15.653
To build a fully robust design
system from scratch not using

6
00:00:15.653 --> 00:00:19.550
any other component libraries or UI
frameworks, it's gonna take a long time.

7
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.950
And it's never done, it's never complete.

8
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.260
This is not a product with
like a finite release date.

9
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.870
This is a product serving products.

10
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.165
And as a result,
it's gonna require some maintenance.

11
00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:35.000
So this industry changes very quickly.

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.760
Different, what's the word like
different priorities or different.

13
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.200
What am I looking for?

14
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.500
Fads I guess, right.

15
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.250
Like we have UX fads and
they change quickly.

16
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.830
So it's gonna require some maintenance and
what that means is we need investment.

17
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.420
We need investment from our leadership and
this can be really, really difficult.

18
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.860
We need designers, engineers, and

19
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.890
product managers to ensure
the success of our system.

20
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.034
Because actually a lack of adoption is the
number one reason why design systems fail.
