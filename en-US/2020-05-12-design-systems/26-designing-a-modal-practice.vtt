00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.350
I want you to create a second one.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.720
So you can just copy this art board and
paste it, and it'll create a duplicate.

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.240
So all the other stuff is already set for
you, find a second illustration, and

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.240
maybe use another button.

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.640
And I've provided those text fields for
you.

6
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.780
So these, if they're purple it means
they're already components, and

7
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.750
you can already drag them in and
play with them.

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.990
So go ahead and
actually just drag these in.

9
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.010
You might have to go ahead.

10
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.130
So like if you've cloned this,
you're going to need to select these and

11
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.940
maybe create components out of them,
but that's okay.

12
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.750
Just go to your model.

13
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.160
Select this and
we'll just drag in a text field.

14
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.026
So take the next 10, 15 minutes and

15
00:00:43.026 --> 00:00:46.980
just create a second model.

16
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.773
It can look like whatever
you want it to look like,

17
00:00:48.773 --> 00:00:50.405
it can have whatever
illustration you want.

18
00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:54.784
And then, we're ready to code it.
