00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
What I would like you to do
is go add one more add-on.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.684
This is the last add-on, I believe.

3
00:00:04.684 --> 00:00:07.625
I could be mistaken, but
I think this is the last add-on, and

4
00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:12.261
this is going to be called,
Add-on accessibilities.

5
00:00:12.261 --> 00:00:20.099
So npm install @storybook/addon-811y
accessibility.

6
00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:25.861
Of course, while this is loading,
let's go add this to our array here.

7
00:00:28.437 --> 00:00:34.051
@storybook/addon-a11y/register.

8
00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:36.318
Again, we need to register this add-on.

9
00:00:40.571 --> 00:00:41.353
What's the next step?

10
00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:44.473
What do we have to do after we
put this in our add-ons array?

11
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.372
We do one more thing, just to tell
storybook, hey, we need to add this.

12
00:00:49.372 --> 00:00:49.980
&gt;&gt; Decorator?

13
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.298
&gt;&gt; Decorators, in preview.js,
let's add one more decorator.

14
00:00:55.298 --> 00:00:59.688
So import withA11y from

15
00:00:59.688 --> 00:01:05.280
@storybook/addon-a11y.

16
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.570
This one's, again, very simple,
just simply addDecorator withA11y.

17
00:01:17.287 --> 00:01:20.642
So this one might need a refresh.

18
00:01:20.642 --> 00:01:21.957
Let me restart my server.

19
00:01:21.957 --> 00:01:25.911
So if your add-ons are not appearing in
your storybook, just go ahead and stop and

20
00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:27.189
restart your dev server.

21
00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:28.322
That should take care of it.

22
00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:33.053
If there's an error, you'll see that
in your terminal, but it should work.

23
00:01:33.053 --> 00:01:36.628
Okay, so when I stopped and restarted my
server, you can see now on the bottom

24
00:01:36.628 --> 00:01:40.322
here, alongside Knobs and Actions,
I have a third tab called Accessibility.

25
00:01:40.322 --> 00:01:44.618
When you click on this, you should be
able to see if you have any violations,

26
00:01:44.618 --> 00:01:46.512
any incomplete, or any passes.

27
00:01:46.512 --> 00:01:48.030
So you can look through these.

28
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.392
This a lot about attributes.

29
00:01:50.392 --> 00:01:54.135
If we check out our Buttons, for example,
we can see those are a little simpler but

30
00:01:54.135 --> 00:01:54.849
they all pass.

31
00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:57.136
So this is a really great and
easy tool that you can use for

32
00:01:57.136 --> 00:01:58.263
checking accessibility.

33
00:01:58.263 --> 00:02:01.333
But, again, I wouldn't have this
as the only tool that you use.

34
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:05.340
I would actually, if you have someone
who's really knowledgeable about

35
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.872
accessibility, maybe just check with them.

36
00:02:07.872 --> 00:02:11.833
Actually having someone who is
an accessibility expert part of your

37
00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:16.776
core team when you're making design
systems is invaluable, very, very helpful.

38
00:02:16.776 --> 00:02:20.448
But there are other tools that you can
use as well, which we'll have linked on

39
00:02:20.448 --> 00:02:23.286
the website that you can use
to learn about accessibility.
