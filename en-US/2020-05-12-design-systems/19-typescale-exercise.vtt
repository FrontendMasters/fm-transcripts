1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.210
So, we're going to go create a type scale.

2
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.311
The first thing that I want you to do is,
go to Google Fonts.

3
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:08.880
So that's fonts.google.com.

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.305
And I want you to find
a font that you like.

5
00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:12.650
It can be sans serif, it could be serif.

6
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.587
It could be monospace.

7
00:00:13.587 --> 00:00:15.910
I'm going to be using a monospace font.

8
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.750
And actually, if you copied over that
artboard to your typography page here,

9
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.930
you can see this is my type scale.

10
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.500
I believe I used the perfect
fifth as my scale.

11
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.160
And I used a monospace font, Roboto Mono.

12
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.430
So the first thing is go select
a font from Google Fonts.

13
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.920
If you don't know how to actually save it,

14
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.370
all you need to do is, let's pick one,
I don't know, I don't think I have this.

15
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.320
So you press the plus button here.

16
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.550
Okay, it's gonna pop down here.

17
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.580
You can hit Download.

18
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.830
When you download it,
you can open Font Book.

19
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.260
And then all you need to do is drag this,
unzip it, and then drag this

20
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.360
file into your Font Book, and now it's
locally installed on your computer, okay?

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.740
So if you want to use a font, just go
ahead download it, drag it into Font Book.

22
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.680
Once you have that downloaded,
it's now on your local machine.

23
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.540
I mean, we're using Figma,

24
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.540
it's in the browser,
it's probably a little bit different.

25
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.905
I don't know if it's pulling your local
fonts or if it's all in their UI,

26
00:01:13.905 --> 00:01:14.639
I'm not really sure.

27
00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:19.547
But if you're using Sketch, for example,
Sketch is a Mac application you would have

28
00:01:19.547 --> 00:01:23.340
locally, you would need the fonts
downloaded to your computer.

29
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.080
So choose a font, and then you can
use my artboards here as reference.

30
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.600
You can actually even just
change this font itself.

31
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.210
You don't need to create new ones.

32
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.315
So you can either copy and paste
these artboards and create copies, or

33
00:01:34.315 --> 00:01:37.460
you can just change mine,
whatever you prefer.

34
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.150
And then, type scale generate calculator,
there is,

35
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.380
this is all linked in the website,
Type Scale, A Visual Calculator.

36
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.170
If you Google for that,
you're gonna get this.

37
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.890
And you can change over here, and
you can find a type scale that you like.

38
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.100
So perfect fourth,
perfect fifth is really big.

39
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.260
Golden ratio is even bigger.

40
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.460
So find a scale that you like.

41
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.740
I chose the perfect fourth, I think.

42
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.401
And what you're gonna do here,
as you can see, we've got 1M, 1.3M,

43
00:02:07.401 --> 00:02:11.750
1.7M, it's a base 16 pixels, and
you're gonna copy that over.

44
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.830
So let's say I'm gonna choose a different
one, let's say I choose the major third.

45
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.370
I'm gonna put these windows side by side,
so I have a reference here.

46
00:02:22.554 --> 00:02:26.064
If you wanna hide these sidebars,
if you're doing a double screen on Figma,

47
00:02:26.064 --> 00:02:27.858
you can hit Cmd+Period to hide those.

48
00:02:27.858 --> 00:02:31.270
It'll give you a little
bit more real estate.

49
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.650
And I don't know what the command
is on a Windows machine, but

50
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.670
it is probably Ctrl+Period, okay?

51
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.040
So let's say I'm choosing this,
I've got 1M here.

52
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.690
This is my paragraph text, okay?

53
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.074
That's gonna stay the same, it's base 16.

54
00:02:45.074 --> 00:02:49.853
The H5 is now going to be 1.25M,
so let's change that.

55
00:02:49.853 --> 00:02:55.570
Let's go 1.25M, and instead of 18 pixels,
it's going to be 16 pixels.

56
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.420
This is what you would see in
a traditional design system,

57
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.190
or a design kit from someone.

58
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.790
They would do something similar to this,
okay?

59
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.360
So find your scale, find your font.

60
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.712
Now, let's say I want to
change this font family too.

61
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.940
You can pick a random font,
find a font you like.

62
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.814
Not that one, that one's cursive, and
that's gonna be really hard to read.

63
00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:18.871
And we're gonna do the same
thing that we do with colors.

64
00:03:18.871 --> 00:03:21.550
Okay, we're gonna actually
create text styles out of these.

65
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.080
So we did color styles,
now we're going to do text styles.

66
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.450
So once you get your fonts,
the way that you want them, again,

67
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.510
click those four dots here, and
you hit plus to create a new text style.

68
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.570
Let me do that on here.

69
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.620
So we've got this.

70
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.180
Now let's say it's 20 pixels.

71
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.570
I'm going to go in,
create a new text style.

72
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.240
I'm going to call this H4.

73
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.199
You can label it however you want,
it's just for you.

74
00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.680
Now I call it H4, and
I've got a text style.

75
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.250
So if I create some new text, which you
could do just by pressing the T on your

76
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.370
keyboard, creating a new little text box.

77
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.250
I have some text here.

78
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.742
You can now highlight that,
click those four dots, and

79
00:03:59.742 --> 00:04:02.234
your text style can be applied, so H4.

80
00:04:02.234 --> 00:04:06.482
Go find your font family, go find
a font scale, using this visual type

81
00:04:06.482 --> 00:04:11.249
scale calculator, type-scale.com,
and let's create some text styles.
