00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.910
This is what should look
like when you're done.

2
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.202
Except yours is gonna look different,
because you have a different font family,

3
00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:06.212
a different type scale.

4
00:00:06.212 --> 00:00:09.680
Well, the type scale is gonna be the same,
you're gonna use paragraph fonts for

5
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.170
all of the default buttons.

6
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.599
Small buttons, you can use the typography
that's right beneath the paragraph,

7
00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.309
I think I called copyright text,
or helper text.

8
00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:20.772
And then you could use an H5 for
the large buttons here,

9
00:00:20.772 --> 00:00:23.560
this is what it should
look like generally.

10
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.606
So I've created this chart here for you.

11
00:00:26.606 --> 00:00:29.612
So, using your colors,
so let me do an example.

12
00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:32.530
If you click R,
that gives you a rectangle tool.

13
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.710
You can draw a rectangle here.

14
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.200
And, you can see it's filled.

15
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.110
So I'm gonna fill this with my primary
color, I'm gonna do that by clicking these

16
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.010
four little dots here and
select one of my color styles.

17
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.640
And so now that's changed.

18
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.350
Then you can press T, and
that'll give you text.

19
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.380
You can click and
it'll just start the cursor there,

20
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.696
you can even draw a box if you want.

21
00:00:52.696 --> 00:00:56.910
I'm gonna call this Submit, okay?

22
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.490
And, I didn't add a text style,
let me do that real quick.

23
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.340
So if I create a new text style,
I'm gonna call this, Paragraph.

24
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.770
I've got a text style, I can go back to
my button, I can highlight this text.

25
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.140
If it's already linked to a text style,
which it might be, you can unlink it here.

26
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.460
And then you can open this and
select Paragraphs.

27
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.633
Now it's my paragraph text, okay?

28
00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:22.700
And, so
I want you to just play around with this.

29
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.683
You can add some border radius,
that's gonna be this little thing up here.

30
00:01:25.683 --> 00:01:27.999
You can add some border radius,
you can make them fully round,

31
00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.970
you can make them square.

32
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.340
Just make sure that, this label obviously
is not gonna pass color contrast,

33
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.760
it's gonna be too dark.

34
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.119
So, I wanna actually give
this a text color inverted.

35
00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.425
I'm gonna create this text style,
we'll call you.

36
00:01:44.425 --> 00:01:49.191
Text, no, see, this is what happens if you
don't double-click and highlight the box,

37
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:51.590
it's gonna be really
hard to add that color.

38
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.720
So, text color inverted.

39
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.950
Now I can go to my button and say,
okay, this is a little too dark.

40
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.620
Let me give this a color of,
text color inverted, and there you go.

41
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.600
So take the next, let's say 30 minutes,
this is gonna take a little bit longer.

42
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.820
Take the next 30 minutes and
create a chart that looks just like this.

43
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.820
And for the warning, error, and success,

44
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.180
you should have grabbed those from here,
which I've already given to you.
