1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.890
So there are many different
kinds of typescales.

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.350
We've got major third,
major second, perfect fourth.

3
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.870
You might have heard of golden ratio, it's
also used I believe in biology, right?

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.356
Is it biology?

5
00:00:11.356 --> 00:00:12.510
And the perfect fifth.

6
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.020
This is a screenshot of IBM's typography
page where they have their typescale.

7
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.036
And the whole premise here is all of these
different type scales have different

8
00:00:22.036 --> 00:00:27.288
ratios that you would multiply the larger
font sizes by 1.2, or like a 1.8.

9
00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:31.603
Which we'll see in a second, or
the smaller would be like 0.8 REM, for

10
00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:32.235
example.
