00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.074
So there's a couple other areas of design.

2
00:00:02.074 --> 00:00:05.272
If you're building and designing system,
you're gonna wanna to talk about grid

3
00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:07.276
spacing, accessibility,
motion iconography.

4
00:00:07.276 --> 00:00:10.177
Those are just a few other
areas you might see.

5
00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:14.685
And I've linked some design systems at the
end of this, that we'll quickly go over,

6
00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:18.689
And what I like to do if I'm building
something is I like to audit other design

7
00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.130
systems and see what they're including and
see what are the things that I need.

8
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.964
Again, you don't need to do all of
these if you don't need them, right?

9
00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:27.709
Like if you're not using motion,
you don't need it.

10
00:00:27.709 --> 00:00:29.705
If you don't have the resources,
it's totally fine.

11
00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:32.184
But accessibility, grid,and spacing and

12
00:00:32.184 --> 00:00:36.330
iconography are gonna be four big
ones that you'll definitely need.

13
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.480
We're not gonna talk
about those today though.

14
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.530
Okay, I think we're ready to
actually design a component.

15
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.764
And then once we design our components,
we're gonna build them, so

16
00:00:44.764 --> 00:00:45.464
let's design them.
