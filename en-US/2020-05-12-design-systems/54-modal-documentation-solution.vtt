00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.260
For the Modal exercise,

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.860
all I did was create a new file called
Modals.stories.mdx inside of components

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.390
and I just copy and pasted over all
of the code for my button stories.

4
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.410
So it's very similar and

5
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.100
has the same exact structure,
all I did was instantiate the SignupModal.

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.050
And then, all we need to do to get
this working with the show and

7
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.550
hide modal is just to create a showModal
attribute here passing in our state.

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.880
It's a boolean, and
we're going to initialize it to true.

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.650
So if we come in here to our norms we
can see now we've got our Show Modal.

10
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.980
And if I uncheck this, it fades out and
if I check, it fades in.

11
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.620
I believe it's not transitioning just
because the CSS like it doesn't know

12
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.420
where to go.

13
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.460
So, at least, it's showing and it's not
showing that it's good enough for me.
