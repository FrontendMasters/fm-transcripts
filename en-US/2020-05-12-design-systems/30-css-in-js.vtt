00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.039
But while this is a better solution,
and while this does allow for

2
00:00:05.039 --> 00:00:08.806
scoping, we have a new
solution which is CSS and JS.

3
00:00:08.806 --> 00:00:12.344
This is something a little
controversial but this really,

4
00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:15.540
really scope styling to
the components themselves.

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.210
Everything is encapsulated
in one document.

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.240
So as opposed to having separate SASS
files that are transpiled into CSS code.

7
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.720
We can actually just write our CSS
inside of our React components,

8
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.330
so we use JavaScript styler components.

9
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.140
And when our components are parsed,
it then generates the CSS and

10
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.150
attaches it to the DOM.

11
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.586
So we're gonna be using
styled components today.

12
00:00:37.586 --> 00:00:40.585
There are other libraries like Emotion,
is another popular one for React.

13
00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:45.292
It's also a great choice, but
we're gonna be using styled components.
