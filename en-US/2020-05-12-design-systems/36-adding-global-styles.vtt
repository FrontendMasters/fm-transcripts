00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.720
Sometimes you want global styles.

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.790
Sometimes you want to maybe reset or
normalize your UI.

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.270
So let's go ahead and
install a really cool package.

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.183
So open your terminal.

5
00:00:11.183 --> 00:00:15.265
We're gonna save npm i, so npm install,

6
00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:18.889
polished, it's called polished.

7
00:00:18.889 --> 00:00:22.850
So let me go to the site, so polished.

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.363
If you look this up,
we get a bunch of nail salons.

9
00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:30.590
So it's Polished.js.org.

10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.050
Okay, this has a ton of really cool
features that you can use with your code.

11
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.620
Something that might be really
useful is visually hide,

12
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.060
I think it was called, let me see.

13
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.680
Hide visually, this is so
great for accessibility.

14
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.630
If you need to add additional text,
like a hidden description for

15
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.510
assistive technology,
hiding something visually is really hard.

16
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.700
You can't write display none.

17
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.950
It'll remove that from the document and
it won't be wrote allowed.

18
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.116
So having these little tools
that you can use to do things,

19
00:01:01.116 --> 00:01:03.490
we're gonna use normalize.

20
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.059
These are really useful and

21
00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.120
we're gonna use them just like a function
call within our curly brackets.

22
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.580
Okay, so Polished has now been installed.

23
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.645
I'm gonna go back to
a full screen on this.

24
00:01:17.645 --> 00:01:22.236
So inside of utils,
let's add a new file called Global.js.

25
00:01:22.236 --> 00:01:27.255
I'm going to capitalize it cuz we're gonna
instantiate it like a react component or

26
00:01:27.255 --> 00:01:29.900
like an HTML component, so Global.js.

27
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.476
And we're gonna import three things.

28
00:01:31.476 --> 00:01:39.670
So import createGlobalStyle,
From styled components.

29
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.534
We'll import our primary font.

30
00:01:45.534 --> 00:01:49.696
Now, we can't, since this is in the same
directory as the typography file,

31
00:01:49.696 --> 00:01:53.552
we can't just say, import primary
font from this current directory.

32
00:01:53.552 --> 00:01:54.640
That's not gonna work.

33
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.326
You actually do have to say
typography in this case

34
00:01:58.326 --> 00:02:01.145
because it's in the same directory.

35
00:02:01.145 --> 00:02:06.116
And let's import our normalized
function from Polished.

36
00:02:07.511 --> 00:02:09.408
Okay, let's get rid of this.

37
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.125
So, let's create a constant and
let's export it,

38
00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:22.620
export const GlobalStyle and
it's gonna use createGlobalStyle.

39
00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:27.810
Two backticks, and in here we're going
to essentially write all of our CSS that

40
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.890
we want applied globally.

41
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.290
The first thing we wanna
do is normalize our code.

42
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.620
So again, we've got our dollar sign
curly brackets to evaluate this,

43
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.860
we're just gonna call normalize
just like a function call.

44
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.030
So that's gonna normalize all of our code.

45
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.210
I'm gonna add a couple more things.

46
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.300
So on our HTML element,
let's first set font size to 16 pixels.

47
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.550
So this is how you would set
the default font size and

48
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.800
when we use our REM values now they're
gonna be evaluated against the 16 pixels.

49
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.140
We're gonna do box-sizing border-box.

50
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.330
So what this does is if you have
padding and margin and you set

51
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.600
a specific width and height, and let's say
I set a width of 300 pixels on my button.

52
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.194
But I've also set, or
let's say it's a Max width, right?

53
00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:19.586
I set max width of 300 pixels on my
button, but I also have padding and stuff.

54
00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:20.577
What that's gonna do,

55
00:03:20.577 --> 00:03:23.598
box-sizing border-box is gonna say
no matter what padding or margin or

56
00:03:23.598 --> 00:03:27.430
whatever is added to this element,
it can be no bigger than 300 pixels.

57
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.780
If you don't use this sometimes when you
add padding and margin, it might push

58
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.090
the boundaries above the 300 pixels and
so this is really gonna prevent that.

59
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.603
It's gonna say maximum no matter
what padding margin width,

60
00:03:38.603 --> 00:03:42.866
whatever you have on here,
keep it within the box, okay?

61
00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:46.093
Here we're going to select three things.

62
00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:52.591
We're going to select all, all before, and
another pseudo element, which is after.

63
00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:55.712
We're just gonna say box-sizing inherit.

64
00:03:55.712 --> 00:03:59.433
So from the parent element,
which in this case is HTML,

65
00:03:59.433 --> 00:04:02.055
just inherit that box-sizing value.

66
00:04:03.162 --> 00:04:06.041
On our body I'm gonna
set a margin of 0 and

67
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:11.240
I'm gonna set font family to our font,
font-family to our primaryFont.

68
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.330
So all of our body content will
inherit our primary font now.

69
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.490
And the last thing, I'm just gonna
set this on my main just for

70
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.980
display purposes, but
I'm gonna set a width of 90% and

71
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.680
a margin of 0 auto, so
it should center things, okay?

72
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.890
So we've got some global styles.

73
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.350
We need to add this to our index export
here so we can just import it from utils.

74
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.380
So export star from Global.

75
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.540
So let's go ahead and actually use this.

76
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.915
Let's go back to our
index file in the source,

77
00:04:43.915 --> 00:04:46.536
in the root of the source where we
instantiate all of our components.

78
00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:50.961
So import Global, I'm gonna

79
00:04:50.961 --> 00:04:55.920
call it GlobalStyle from utils.

80
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.070
And all you need to do is the last
element is just render it, so

81
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.470
GlobalStyle, just like that,
just a self closing tag.

82
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.290
And if we come back here now,

83
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.370
ideally we should see
that should be added.

84
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.520
Let's test that real quick
as it's being added.

85
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.200
Let's set a padding, I don't know.

86
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.092
So yeah, we can see our
GlobalStyle's now being added, okay?
