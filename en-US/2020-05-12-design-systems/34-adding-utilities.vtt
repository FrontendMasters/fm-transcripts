1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.230
We created our color palette,

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.910
we created our typography scale,
let's actually go build those in our code.

3
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.215
Inside of source create another folder,
we're gonna call this utils,

4
00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:16.738
We're gonna have three files
we're gonna create colors.js,

5
00:00:16.738 --> 00:00:21.992
we're gonna add typography,
typography that was hard to type,

6
00:00:21.992 --> 00:00:24.965
and we're going to add themes.js.

7
00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:28.549
We'll get to themes in just a little bit
but might as well create the file, so

8
00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:30.910
we've got colors,
themes and typography.js.

9
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.652
Let's start with colors,
So, for your colors,

10
00:00:38.652 --> 00:00:43.520
I had mentioned this before someone
asked a great question about

11
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.113
how you name your colors,
I'm gonna call mine blue 100,

12
00:00:48.113 --> 00:00:51.288
red 100 all the way up through 500.

13
00:00:51.288 --> 00:00:55.674
And this is a great time for you to
actually have the website open because if

14
00:00:55.674 --> 00:01:00.374
you want, you can go and actually grab
the code I've already written for you.

15
00:01:00.374 --> 00:01:04.422
So this is on the adding utilities page,
there's a code snippet here that has

16
00:01:04.422 --> 00:01:08.678
all of my values, you might just wanna
go grab this, it's gonna be the easiest.

17
00:01:08.678 --> 00:01:13.413
Okay, so copy and paste that in and you
can replace your hex codes with whatever

18
00:01:13.413 --> 00:01:17.719
value that you want like your primary
color that you just designed, but

19
00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:18.601
this is mine.

20
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:20.942
So, you're welcome to use mine, you're
welcome to use yours, whatever you prefer.

21
00:01:20.942 --> 00:01:25.683
So we've just got some constants here,
they're all being exported, and

22
00:01:25.683 --> 00:01:30.648
it's just an object where the key is
a value of 100 and the value is a string,

23
00:01:30.648 --> 00:01:32.623
with the hex code in it, okay?

24
00:01:32.623 --> 00:01:37.814
So just copy that over you can
change your colors later, So

25
00:01:37.814 --> 00:01:44.080
we've got some colors,
let's go add some stuff in typography.js.

26
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.200
Let's get rid of this we'll make
this full screen for a moment here.

27
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.024
So if I open typography.js,
the first thing I wanna do is I have my

28
00:01:56.024 --> 00:02:01.190
primary font, so our font family,
so export const primary font,

29
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.182
I'm gonna call mine again
was '"Roboto Mono",

30
00:02:08.348 --> 00:02:11.073
Monospace'.

31
00:02:11.073 --> 00:02:14.625
So if you don't know like what this syntax
means and in the past like if you haven't

32
00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:16.891
worked with this,
basically this is saying look for

33
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:19.640
this font and if you can't find
it default to a monospace font.

34
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:26.614
So now what we're gonna do is we're gonna
use our typeScale so you can again grab us

35
00:02:26.614 --> 00:02:30.101
from the notes if you'd like,
I'm just gonna type it out so typeScale.

36
00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:35.066
Again, give me an object where
the key is gonna be like header1,

37
00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:38.517
header2 and then your values at 1.8rem.

38
00:02:38.517 --> 00:02:43.113
Header2, this is gonna be your type
scale that you just created in figma, so

39
00:02:43.113 --> 00:02:47.708
let's just take two minutes I'm gonna
type mine out, we can do it together,

40
00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:50.060
just copy over your typeScale 1.6.

41
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.056
Again, you're welcome to
use mine if you prefer,

42
00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:57.872
Yeah if you're still typing it in,
again you can go grab it,

43
00:02:57.872 --> 00:03:01.763
it's right on the course site,
so you're welcome to go do that.

44
00:03:01.763 --> 00:03:05.582
And I also just wanna say, and this is how
I'm teaching it, this is how I might do

45
00:03:05.582 --> 00:03:09.743
it, but there are many different ways that
you can build these utility functions, and

46
00:03:09.743 --> 00:03:11.122
design systems in general.

47
00:03:11.122 --> 00:03:13.200
So if you find a better way,
please let me know and

48
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.350
I would love to share
different tactics for that.
