00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.901
If you are following along
in my speaker notes,

2
00:00:02.901 --> 00:00:05.592
you can go here to
creating a color palette.

3
00:00:05.592 --> 00:00:06.910
And there's a link.

4
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.937
It's at the end of the sentence.

5
00:00:08.937 --> 00:00:10.880
I've created a starter file for
you to use.

6
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.891
This is gonna be with Figma.

7
00:00:11.891 --> 00:00:13.493
We are gonna log into Figma.

8
00:00:13.493 --> 00:00:16.527
I've created a starter file so you don't
have to do all of the setup for yourself.

9
00:00:16.527 --> 00:00:23.197
Well, look, all the people okay, listen,
[LAUGH] I didn't know that iwas there.

10
00:00:23.197 --> 00:00:25.152
You're gonna see on the left hand side,
it's a little small.

11
00:00:25.152 --> 00:00:28.273
On the left hand side,
we've got our different pages, okay?

12
00:00:28.273 --> 00:00:32.274
What I want you to do is open Figma,
I'll do this with you right now, and

13
00:00:32.274 --> 00:00:33.360
go to figma.com.

14
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.977
In the top right,
there's this little plus icon.

15
00:00:35.977 --> 00:00:39.989
Click that, it's gonna create
a new project for you, okay?

16
00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.751
Once you've created a new project,
go back to this template, my gosh,

17
00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:45.855
look at all the people, that's so cute.

18
00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:47.324
We're gonna copy these artboards.

19
00:00:47.324 --> 00:00:49.908
These things here are called artboards,
okay?

20
00:00:49.908 --> 00:00:53.820
I'm gonna just hit Shift and
click these and hit Cmd + C, and

21
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.900
go into my little project here.

22
00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.964
All right, in the top left, you see
this page, this page drop-down here.

23
00:01:00.964 --> 00:01:05.064
When you expand it, there's a plus
icon where you can add new pages.

24
00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:08.648
I'm gonna change the name of this
by just double clicking on this,

25
00:01:08.648 --> 00:01:10.440
and I'm gonna call this Colors.

26
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.741
So Cmd + C on those art boards in
the template here, and Cmd + V, and

27
00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.928
now you've got a copy of
that on your own project.

28
00:01:17.928 --> 00:01:20.194
We're gonna do that with these pages here,

29
00:01:20.194 --> 00:01:22.640
y'all please don't create
pages in the template.

30
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.446
I have a backup in case something goes
wrong, but please don't create pages here.

31
00:01:26.446 --> 00:01:30.068
You're gonna create your own project,
okay?

32
00:01:30.068 --> 00:01:32.451
So highlight those artboards,
Cmd + C and Cmd + V.

33
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:35.936
Let's just grab them all, so
create new pages in your own project.

34
00:01:35.936 --> 00:01:41.478
Let's create a type scale, typography
page, typography is a hard word to spell.

35
00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:52.542
We've got buttons, We've got text fields,

36
00:01:56.566 --> 00:02:00.166
And then we've got modsls
which there's nothing in, so

37
00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:03.170
we're just gonna create
a page called modals.

38
00:02:06.497 --> 00:02:08.572
Okay, this is what it's gonna look like.

39
00:02:08.572 --> 00:02:09.535
This is mine, okay?

40
00:02:09.535 --> 00:02:11.780
So, if you notice I've left these gray,
and

41
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.398
that's because you're gonna fill
them in with your own color palette.

42
00:02:15.398 --> 00:02:17.635
I chose this dark blue.

43
00:02:17.635 --> 00:02:20.844
It's a little boring, but
you can choose a fun palette.

44
00:02:20.844 --> 00:02:26.847
So I'm gonna have you go to
coolors.co C-O-O-L-O-R-S.co.

45
00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:30.500
Okay, this is a color scheme generator.

46
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.646
So when you're there, click this big blue
button that says start the generator, and

47
00:02:34.646 --> 00:02:37.467
I'm gonna have you choose
a monochromatic palette just so

48
00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:38.980
this goes a little bit easier.

49
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.632
So if you go actually to this little
settings wheel here, it's a little small.

50
00:02:43.632 --> 00:02:47.394
If you click Settings,
there's actually a monochromatic option.

51
00:02:47.394 --> 00:02:50.246
So turn on that toggle, it's only gonna
give you monochromatic color palettes.

52
00:02:50.246 --> 00:02:53.944
And then you can actually press
the space bar to look through some

53
00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:56.079
of these different color palettes.

54
00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.785
If you find a color that you like,
like let's say I like this purple,

55
00:02:58.785 --> 00:03:00.150
you can click it, it'll lock it.

56
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.420
So it'll keep that one and just generate
new palettes based on that shade.

57
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.450
So what I'm gonna have you do
is just find one that you like.

58
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.996
You can go back and
change this later if you want.

59
00:03:10.996 --> 00:03:16.238
Let's say I wanna choose,
That one's a little brIght.

60
00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:18.337
I'm gonna choose this one.
