1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.053
Let's actually start building our modal.

2
00:00:02.053 --> 00:00:05.469
So our modal has our illustration,
it has a header, it has a paragraph,

3
00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:07.544
our primary button, and then a close icon.

4
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.323
For this, I'm just gonna use a basic
React component, so SignUpModal.

5
00:00:17.508 --> 00:00:21.213
I am gonna make this have curly
brackets with a return function, and

6
00:00:21.213 --> 00:00:23.493
you'll see why once we start animating.

7
00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:29.530
So we have our modal wrapper, oops,
that's gonna wrap our components.

8
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.760
Now we need our illustration,
so let's go and import that.

9
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.871
So import Illustrations,

10
00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:43.151
that object we just created, from /assets.

11
00:00:43.151 --> 00:00:44.057
Also, while we're up here,

12
00:00:44.057 --> 00:00:46.178
let's import our PrimaryButton cuz
we know we're gonna need that.

13
00:00:48.603 --> 00:00:50.896
And again, because we're already
in the components folder,

14
00:00:50.896 --> 00:00:52.373
we can't just import from components.

15
00:00:52.373 --> 00:00:54.063
So we actually have to
import from /Buttons.

16
00:00:54.063 --> 00:01:00.296
So import PrimaryButton, from /Buttons.

17
00:01:00.296 --> 00:01:04.189
Okay, so we have our PrimaryButton we have
our Illustrations being imported here.

18
00:01:06.436 --> 00:01:07.390
So we have our modal wrapper.

19
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.421
The first thing that we see
here is our illustration.

20
00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:12.765
So let's give it an image,
give it a source.

21
00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:19.644
This is gonna be Illustrations.SignUp,
no exclamation, I'm just excited.

22
00:01:19.644 --> 00:01:26.003
For our alt tag.technically,
this is not imperative to the user, right?

23
00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:29.410
This illustration doesn't really
indicate anything that's of importance.

24
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.141
We already have a title and
we already have a paragraph.

25
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:34.664
So I'm actually just
gonna give us an alt of,

26
00:01:34.664 --> 00:01:39.360
you can add an explicit text like,
sign up for an account.

27
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.740
But what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna set aria-hidden="true".

28
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.659
Cuz if I'm using a screen reader,
I don't really care that this exists,

29
00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.938
it's not helping me in any way.

30
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.608
Let's add our header, so
we've got SignUpHeader, Sign Up.

31
00:01:56.206 --> 00:02:02.895
And then our text, SignUpText,
so sign up today to get access.

32
00:02:05.684 --> 00:02:12.058
And then lastly, our buttons,
so PrimaryButton, sign up.

33
00:02:12.058 --> 00:02:13.520
Okay, so now we just have our modal.

34
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.881
We've got our wrapper, our illustration,
our header text, and primary button.

35
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.996
The only thing we need
is a close button here.

36
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.558
So what you can do again from figma
is export this icon as an SVG,

37
00:02:30.558 --> 00:02:31.871
export close icon.

38
00:02:34.664 --> 00:02:40.314
Back inside of our assets, let's create
one more folder called icons, And

39
00:02:40.314 --> 00:02:41.878
just drag in that SVG.

40
00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:46.322
Gonna rename you.

41
00:02:51.613 --> 00:02:53.730
And lastly,
just add that to the export here.

42
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.110
So, we did not use inline SVG for
this illustration,

43
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.910
which means that we actually just
used it as a source attribute.

44
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.813
So I imported it and
I just used it as source.

45
00:03:03.813 --> 00:03:07.200
That's not inline,
that's being rendered as an image.

46
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.620
For our close icon,
we do wanna render this as an inline SVG.

47
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.100
Because when I hover it, for example,
maybe I wanna change the color,

48
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.467
maybe I wanna manipulate
the SVG dom contents itself.

49
00:03:19.467 --> 00:03:21.382
And in that case, you need an inline.

50
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.335
So what we're gonna do, let's create
a wrapper around our close icon.

51
00:03:31.007 --> 00:03:37.483
So const, actually, what I'm gonna do,
since this is gonna be inline SVG,

52
00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:43.540
I want to actually export this as
a React component, let's do that.

53
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.711
So inside of close-icon.svg, we'll just
move this down so we have that SVG code.

54
00:03:49.711 --> 00:03:53.825
So import React, and import styled.

55
00:03:59.002 --> 00:04:02.243
Let's create a wrapper.

56
00:04:02.243 --> 00:04:03.963
We're gonna need to set
some styling on it, and

57
00:04:03.963 --> 00:04:05.563
that's why we're creating this wrapper.

58
00:04:05.563 --> 00:04:10.908
So const CloseIconWrapper, first of all,
let me change this to a JavaScript file so

59
00:04:10.908 --> 00:04:13.860
that it's highlighting things, not an SVG.

60
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.155
So we've got our wrapper, styled,
and this is gonna be a styled SVG,

61
00:04:19.155 --> 00:04:20.686
so it's still semantic.

62
00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:29.428
And inside of here, I just wanna set
width to 100% and height to 100%.

63
00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:36.560
Now export const CloseIcon,
it's gonna be a React component.

64
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.518
This is simply gonna take
our CloseIconWrapper, I'm

65
00:04:43.518 --> 00:04:49.247
gonna set aria-hidden="true".

66
00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:51.430
Why am I setting aria-hidden="true"?

67
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.000
That's because our icon,
we don't actually care about.

68
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.606
It's not giving our visually
impaired users any information,

69
00:04:56.606 --> 00:04:58.014
this is gonna be a button element.

70
00:04:58.014 --> 00:05:01.360
So this is just the icon, and our users
don't really care that it's a close icon.

71
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.960
And inside of here,
we can copy and paste this code.

72
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.990
Now, that being said,
I've already created a styled SVG, so

73
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.220
we can actually just remove this SVG,
I've already created it.

74
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.795
So it's just a path,
it's just a simple path.

75
00:05:22.628 --> 00:05:25.792
So our CloseIcon is being exported.

76
00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:32.880
We need to add this to our exports in our
index file, but this is a React component.

77
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.279
So that's a simple export, so
export * from /icons/CloseIcon.

78
00:05:42.861 --> 00:05:45.070
And now we can actually go and
add this to our modal.

79
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.659
This is also coming from assets,
so we can just import CloseIcon.

80
00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:56.300
And this needs to be a button
because it's interactable.

81
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.810
That's not a word, but
you can interact with it.

82
00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.527
So I'm going to come down here,
and I'm gonna create one more

83
00:06:03.527 --> 00:06:08.890
component called const CloseModalButton,
it's gonna be a button.

84
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.322
We're gonna set some style, so
cursor, I want it to be pointer,

85
00:06:13.322 --> 00:06:18.256
I don't want it to have a background,
I wanna remove the border as well.

86
00:06:20.852 --> 00:06:25.771
So we had set position relative on
this modal wrapper, and that's because

87
00:06:25.771 --> 00:06:30.700
what I want to do is, I wanna position
this element in the top right corner.

88
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.530
And if you wanna absolutely position
something against a parent,

89
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.450
the parent needs position relative.

90
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.219
And the item needs a position of absolute.

91
00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:43.347
So that's what we're doing here,
position absolute.

92
00:06:43.347 --> 00:06:46.374
I want it to be at 40 pixels to the right,
and

93
00:06:46.374 --> 00:06:50.142
I want it to be at 40 pixels to the top,
so 40, 40.

94
00:06:50.142 --> 00:06:52.805
And then I'm just gonna set width and
height to 24 pixels.

95
00:06:54.893 --> 00:06:57.220
And lastly, just no padding,
I don't need any padding.

96
00:07:00.555 --> 00:07:03.264
And what we can do now is
just kind of render this

97
00:07:03.264 --> 00:07:07.717
under as the last thing inside of our
modal wrapper, so CloseModalButton.

98
00:07:11.262 --> 00:07:14.879
I'm gonna give this an aria label because,
again, there's no explicit text, so

99
00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:16.389
aria-label="Close Modal".

100
00:07:21.022 --> 00:07:26.281
And inside is gonna be our CloseIcon,
self closing tag.

101
00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:30.390
Okay, so we created this modal button.

102
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.260
We have this icon, it's being exported
as a stateless React component.

103
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.150
And we're just including this here as
being absolutely positioned against this

104
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.710
modal parent.

105
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.383
So if I go back to my primary
index file and source,

106
00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:50.818
what we can do now,
let's get rid of these buttons.

107
00:07:50.818 --> 00:07:54.988
And also, now that we have an index file
and components, I can actually just remove

108
00:07:54.988 --> 00:07:58.100
this button import,
just import directly from components.

109
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.111
But remember how I said this default
export, this is not gonna work.

110
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:09.215
So one last thing, let's make our
primary button a named export,

111
00:08:09.215 --> 00:08:12.300
okay, so export const PrimaryButton.

112
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.189
We'll remove this default
export at the bottom.

113
00:08:18.483 --> 00:08:22.742
Imports are important,
letters are important.

114
00:08:22.742 --> 00:08:26.351
Can't export CloseIcon, one second.

115
00:08:32.413 --> 00:08:37.178
Export const CloseIcon, that is working.

116
00:08:37.178 --> 00:08:40.928
export * from /icons.

117
00:08:42.881 --> 00:08:45.380
This is a different error,
at least, can't resolve styled.

118
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.822
So this is in components.

119
00:08:51.194 --> 00:08:53.756
Did I spell something wrong, yeah.

120
00:08:56.035 --> 00:09:01.566
Okay, so now that we have named primary
button, named import, and named export,

121
00:09:01.566 --> 00:09:06.800
let's remove these and let's just
import our SignUpModal from components.

122
00:09:09.803 --> 00:09:13.462
So now we can remove these,

123
00:09:13.462 --> 00:09:18.300
SignUpModal, And there we go.

124
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.975
This is a little a little funky,
this position absolute.

125
00:09:22.975 --> 00:09:26.650
Let's see what's going on, and then it
looks like it's working decently well.

126
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.396
This is why,
I didn't add a unit to my top.

127
00:09:31.396 --> 00:09:36.894
So if I go back to Modals.js, 40,

128
00:09:36.894 --> 00:09:41.670
here we go, forgot my unit, and
now it's being positioned absolute.
