00:00:00.162 --> 00:00:01.770
There are things that
I've been researching,

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.710
things I've learned from experience,
but again, I'm not a designer.

3
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.940
So if you are looking for a designer,
I can't answer all your questions, but

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.760
I'm gonna do my best.

5
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.068
So let's talk about color for a second.

6
00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:20.050
How how many of you knew that there were
two different types of color mixing?

7
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.440
Okay, Matt,
maybe Daniel a little bit, cool.

8
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.400
There are two different
types of color mixing.

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.880
I didn't know this.

10
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.230
Additive color mixing.

11
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.400
So colors actually start black and
become white as more red, blue,

12
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.070
or green are added.

13
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.950
This is used for TVs and
other computer monitors.

14
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.468
Subtractive color mixing actually
start white and as filters are added,

15
00:00:42.468 --> 00:00:44.344
they take on the appearance of color.

16
00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:47.366
So this would be for
printed media like photos and magazines.

17
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:50.347
I didn't know that,
I thought that was really interesting.

18
00:00:52.483 --> 00:00:55.740
And there are actually a couple of
different color types that you've probably

19
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.070
heard of, maybe you don't
know exactly what they are.

20
00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.581
So let's let's talk about those.

21
00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.106
Primary colors.

22
00:01:03.106 --> 00:01:05.009
So this kind of takes
us back to art school.

23
00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.190
I didn’t go to art school.

24
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.460
I meant like when you are in
elementary school and

25
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.760
they make you go to art class and
you’re like, primary colors.

26
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.935
Primary colors are colors that cannot
be created by combining other colors.

27
00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:18.785
So in this case it's red,
yellow, and blue.

28
00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:25.475
Secondly colors are result from
mixing two different primary colors.

29
00:01:25.475 --> 00:01:27.355
So if you mix red and blue you get purple.

30
00:01:27.355 --> 00:01:29.805
If you mix green and
orange you get yellow.

31
00:01:29.805 --> 00:01:32.550
And, what's the other combination?

32
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.720
Purple.

33
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.250
No.

34
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.430
Blue and yellow, you get green.

35
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.750
And tertiary colors are created
by combining a secondary

36
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.670
color with a primary color, and
there are six of those here.

37
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.902
And you noticed that
these were on a wheel.

38
00:01:48.902 --> 00:01:50.713
These were actually in a circle,

39
00:01:50.713 --> 00:01:55.320
the color wheels are very fascinating in
terms of different kinds of color pallets.

40
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.085
I'm sure we've all looked at UIs and
been like that looks really great or

41
00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:00.674
this looks horrible, and
a lot of times it's due to color theory.

42
00:02:00.674 --> 00:02:02.842
So let's talk about color palettes for
a second.

43
00:02:02.842 --> 00:02:04.666
We've got monochromatic,

44
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:09.080
they are created by establishing
variations on a shade of one color.

45
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.360
These are generally very
safe color palettes.

46
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.950
You'll see a lot of resume designs
as well use monochromatic,

47
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.896
cuz it's a very safe choice, but
it can be a little bit boring.

48
00:02:18.896 --> 00:02:22.890
So if you work in an exciting company or
you're building an exciting product,

49
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.960
maybe you want to pick
a different color palette.

50
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.600
Complementary color palettes
are created by selecting two colors

51
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.490
opposite from each other on the color
wheel so they balance each other out.

52
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.550
Then we have analogous.

53
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.310
So analogous color palettes,

54
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.160
you select three different colors on
the same side of the color wheel.

55
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.360
Triadic is super fun.

56
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.500
This one's a little bit edgier.

57
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.680
It's not done as often I would say, but

58
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.150
they're created by selecting three colors
evenly spaced around the color wheel.

59
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.520
And so by using these different
color palettes we can easily

60
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.940
kind of unify our UIs to
look a little bit nicer.
