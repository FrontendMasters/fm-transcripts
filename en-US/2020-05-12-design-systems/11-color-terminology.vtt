00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.716
We're not gonna necessarily
use this today.

2
00:00:01.716 --> 00:00:05.051
But I think it's really important to
understand because when we work with our

3
00:00:05.051 --> 00:00:07.114
designers, we need to
have a common language.

4
00:00:07.114 --> 00:00:10.895
I think often we expect our designers
to have some idea of HTML, and CSS, and

5
00:00:10.895 --> 00:00:12.800
maybe even JavaScript.

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.650
But I think as engineers,

7
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.820
we also need to have some kind of
common terminology with them as well.

8
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.712
So hue was just any old
color on the color wheel.

9
00:00:22.674 --> 00:00:25.926
Saturation is the intensity or
the actual purity of a color.

10
00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:31.818
Luminance is the amount of brightness or
light in a color.

11
00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:38.631
A shade, you actually create a shade by
incorporating black into a base hue, and

12
00:00:38.631 --> 00:00:40.310
this will actually darken your color.

13
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.278
A tint is the opposite, so you would
actually add white to your base hue, and

14
00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:46.585
then that'll lighten the color.

15
00:00:49.301 --> 00:00:50.420
And the last one is tone.

16
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.773
So you would create a tone by combining
black, or white, or gray with a base hue.

17
00:00:55.773 --> 00:00:59.293
You can use tones when you're trying to
create like hover states for example,

18
00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:00.660
this is how you would do that.

19
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.640
&gt;&gt; Are you going to discuss
color naming convention?

20
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.960
&gt;&gt; I'm not, but that's a great point.

21
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.220
So talking about naming colors,
naming is hard.

22
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.199
So typically, you're gonna have primary,
secondary, and tertiary colors,

23
00:01:15.199 --> 00:01:18.193
which we had already discussed
in our color theory section.

24
00:01:18.193 --> 00:01:24.156
And so what you'll typically see, is a lot
of design systems will call it blue-100 or

25
00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:28.690
blue-400, and
these increments of 100 are very standard,

26
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.040
the whole point of numbering these things
is to give a certain amount of leeway.

27
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.010
So let's say I have blue
100 through blue 600,

28
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.180
and I need another shade of blue for some
reason, this happens a lot with neutrals,

29
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.110
okay, cuz we use a lot of
different neutral shades.

30
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.300
And let's say I need to add a new value
in, well, if I have blue 10, blue 20,

31
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.788
there's not as much of a leeway in between
to give additional shades if you need it,

32
00:01:52.788 --> 00:01:57.105
there's only like nine other values that
you could have in between two different

33
00:01:57.105 --> 00:01:57.760
shades of blue.

34
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.100
The 100 is typically pretty standard,
I'm not exactly sure why, but

35
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.760
you'll see a lot of hundred denominations.

36
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.050
So if I needed a blue between 200 to 300,
you would see blue 250 for example.

37
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.960
So you would typically call your colors,
blue, red, yellow, dash 100, 200, 300.

38
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.917
And then I want you to talk about themes,

39
00:02:17.917 --> 00:02:22.081
in color palettes is where you would talk
about primary, secondary, and tertiary.

40
00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:26.617
And you could save those values,
like my primary could be blue 200, so

41
00:02:26.617 --> 00:02:30.950
that's typically how you would name
colors, it was a good question.

42
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.718
Great, okay.

43
00:02:33.718 --> 00:02:38.650
So type skills, if you added textiles,
you should now see them over

44
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.275
here on your right hand sidebar under
Design, you can also see your colors.

45
00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:46.645
And if you actually, let's say highlight
this and you go to the Code tab,

46
00:02:46.645 --> 00:02:49.695
it actually generates your CSS for
you, how cool is that?

47
00:02:49.695 --> 00:02:54.332
A lot of design tools now like Sketch,
Figma, Framer, they're all using

48
00:02:54.332 --> 00:02:59.204
generative code that you can use to have
a conversation with your developers.

49
00:02:59.204 --> 00:03:02.148
I wouldn't necessarily export this
code and throw it into production nor

50
00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:03.382
take a second glance at it, but

51
00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:05.815
it is something that you can
definitely use as a foundation.
