00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.460
Okay, let's just wrap it up to talking
about some resources that you can use to

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.470
learn more about design systems.

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.620
There are many people in this industry in
design systems who are extremely notable.

4
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.060
I want to recognize specifically Gina and
she is fantastic.

5
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.130
There's also a design
systems Twitter list, so

6
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.760
if you wanna go subscribe to that,
that's great.

7
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.900
Brad Frost is one of the veterans of the
industry and Mina Markham is also great.

8
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.578
Lots of great people on this list,
so I recommend checking them out.

9
00:00:24.578 --> 00:00:28.940
Again, Clarity Conf,
this is solely for design systems and

10
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.500
there are a couple others as well.

11
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.220
This is kind of a newer field,
so it's still growing but

12
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.750
hopefully we'll see more conferences.

13
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.430
And if you're looking for
some really notable design systems,

14
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.510
these are just a few.

15
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.630
There are lots of different design
systems and there is a GitHub

16
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.720
repository where people have actually gone
and aggregated different design systems.

17
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.950
So you can go check this out as well.

18
00:00:51.565 --> 00:00:54.291
Again, if you wanna check out
some accessibility resources,

19
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:57.900
here are some links that you can go check
out to learn more about web accessibility.

20
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.470
And someone had asked previously if I have
any other tools I would recommend for

21
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.710
building a style guide.

22
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.782
Absolutely, I would recommend Gatsby
if you work with React is fantastic and

23
00:01:07.782 --> 00:01:11.303
what's nice is you can still write
all your documentation in MDX.

24
00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:13.579
They have a starter file for
a starter blog,

25
00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:15.750
a blog is very similar to a style guide.

26
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.090
So it'll actually parse all of
your MDX files with GraphQL and

27
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.080
it'll auto compile those down for you.

28
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.100
React style guide is this is
another one I wanna call out.

29
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.790
They're very good, obviously, it's
React specific, but it's a great tool.

30
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.650
And with that, if you have any questions,
please reach out to me.

31
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.520
This is my first workshop, so
I'm really happy that you're all here and

32
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.460
everyone is so supportive.

33
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.610
So I just wanna thank you all for
that and if I can ever help you or

34
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.525
do anything, please let me know.

35
00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:47.135
