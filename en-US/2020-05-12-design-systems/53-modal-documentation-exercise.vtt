00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.611
So now that we've kind of created
our buttons, I would like for

2
00:00:03.611 --> 00:00:07.297
you to go inside of your components
folder, create a new story for

3
00:00:07.297 --> 00:00:09.793
your models, and
do the same kind of thing.

4
00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:12.709
You can copy and paste over the MDA
documentation from buttons and

5
00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.460
kind of just change it to fit.

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.080
Don't worry about what the documentation
says, it's just meant for

7
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.710
presentational purposes.

8
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.709
So get your modal rendering, and

9
00:00:21.709 --> 00:00:26.645
use use a knob to actually
toggle the visibility of it.
