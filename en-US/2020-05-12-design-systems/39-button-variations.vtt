00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.080
All right,
let's move on to some modifiers.

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.130
We're gonna install another package.

3
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.646
So go ahead and
open your terminal once more.

4
00:00:05.646 --> 00:00:11.550
It's npm install styled-components.

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.690
There's an s on components.

6
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.134
I have messed this up multiple times.

7
00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:17.428
Modifiers, okay?

8
00:00:17.428 --> 00:00:24.520
So, styled-component modifiers

9
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:31.040
are going to allow you to pass in an array
of different modifiers on our components.

10
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.970
And say, hey, I want this to be a small
button, I want this to be a big button.

11
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.810
So very much like this.

12
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.180
You can pass in just a simple string that
says, I want this to be a success button.

13
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.020
Or you can pass in an array.

14
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.696
So this is what we're
installing right now.

15
00:00:46.836 --> 00:00:49.710
So once that install it,
let's go into our button file again.

16
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:59.887
We're gonna import applyStyleModifiers
from styled-components modifiers.

17
00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.294
Now we're gonna actually create a constant
that tells styled-components what kinda

18
00:01:06.294 --> 00:01:07.430
modifiers we wanna have.

19
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.524
So, const BUTTON_MODIFIERS.

20
00:01:14.526 --> 00:01:16.877
So we're gonna give them small button.

21
00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:21.444
And we're also gonna have a large button.

22
00:01:21.444 --> 00:01:24.265
And these are going to be modifiers
that we just can pass in.

23
00:01:24.265 --> 00:01:27.240
So, what I want is to be able to,
let me get rid of these disabled.

24
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.510
What I ideally want is to be able
to come in here and say modifiers.

25
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.610
I want this to be a small primary button.

26
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.480
Or, this has to be in curly
brackets cuz it's a JSX expression.

27
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.715
I want this to be a large button, okay?

28
00:01:44.715 --> 00:01:45.910
So, this is what we want.

29
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:46.850
So, let's actually go build that.

30
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:54.180
So, if it's a small button, I want to set
the font size to typeScale.helperText.

31
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.568
So it's gonna be 0.9 or 0.8 rem.

32
00:02:02.103 --> 00:02:04.051
Why is this yelling at me?

33
00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:08.060
I put opening in curly brackets here.

34
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.260
We don't want that.

35
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.660
This is not JavaScript.

36
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.690
This is styled-components.

37
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.993
So, we're gonna use backticks.

38
00:02:16.232 --> 00:02:19.350
So, it has to have backticks here
instead of open and closed brackets.

39
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.412
Just like that.

40
00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:23.505
And I'm going to set padding
here to eight pixels.

41
00:02:23.505 --> 00:02:27.150
And remember I had that diagram
in our design part of this.

42
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.470
And I said, well, padding on a small
button, eight pixels sounds good.

43
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.460
For larger entity font size,
we're gonna do a typeScale.

44
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.780
But, I'm gonna give it an H5.

45
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.650
You can give it whatever you like.

46
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.700
And I'm gonna give this padding
of 16 pixels, 24 pixels.

47
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.364
So 16 top and bottom and
24 left and right.

48
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.910
So we haven't used this yet.

49
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.430
So, what we need to do is, for each of
our three buttons, primary, secondary and

50
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.550
tertiary, we're gonna come down here
to our dollar sign curly brackets and

51
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.525
we're gonna say, applyStyleModifiers.

52
00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:03.916
Call the function and
pass it our modifiers button.

53
00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:06.897
Modifiers okay?

54
00:03:06.897 --> 00:03:10.412
We're gonna do this on all three.

55
00:03:10.412 --> 00:03:13.413
Does anyone know why we're applying it to
all three as opposed to the top level?

56
00:03:15.802 --> 00:03:18.222
If we were to apply that
up here on our button,

57
00:03:18.222 --> 00:03:20.470
all of these are inheriting from Button.

58
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.790
It would actually be overwritten,

59
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.630
probably, by a lot of
individual styling on here.

60
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.472
So we wanna make sure that any modifiers
are the last CSS to be applied so

61
00:03:30.472 --> 00:03:31.963
that they are shown.

62
00:03:31.963 --> 00:03:33.140
And now we go back to our UI.

63
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.626
We can see we've got a small primary
button, a big secondary button and

64
00:03:36.626 --> 00:03:37.623
a tertiary button.
