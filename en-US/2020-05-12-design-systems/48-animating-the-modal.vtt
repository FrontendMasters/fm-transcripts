00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.127
As a last kind of animation exercise,
let's animate our modal.

2
00:00:03.127 --> 00:00:06.866
So we have it rendering now,
let's actually go and animate this.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.436
First, let's go and commit this stuff.

4
00:00:12.436 --> 00:00:14.720
So this is all the heavy,
heavy styled components stuff.

5
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.779
So we're just gonna commit this,
and let's just say,

6
00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:24.178
style components, Commit messages.

7
00:00:24.178 --> 00:00:29.772
Okay, so first, we need to install
react-spring, so npm i react-spring

8
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.220
And inside of index,
we're gonna set some state here.

9
00:00:41.657 --> 00:00:46.360
So we already have useState, so let's
do showModal and let's do setShowModal.

10
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.540
So by default,
we don't want it to be showing.

11
00:00:50.782 --> 00:00:53.259
Wow, I just deleted our state,
let's not do that.

12
00:00:53.259 --> 00:01:00.390
Let's create a second state, [showModal,
setShowModal] = useState(false).

13
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.080
So let's create just a third
button similar to our dark theme,

14
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.070
our default theme, copy and
paste one of those.

15
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.280
onClick, though,
this is gonna be setShowModal.

16
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.651
And let's just toggle our state, so
showModal, whatever the opposite is,

17
00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:22.668
so toggle modal.

18
00:01:26.648 --> 00:01:30.560
Okay, So we have our SignUpModal here.

19
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.641
Our SignUpModal needs to know whether or
not to be shown.

20
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:38.030
So let's pass some state, so we've got
our showModal state that we just made.

21
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.340
And we need our event handler or a state
updater, so setShowModal, setShowModal.

22
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.453
Okay, so now we have those two pieces
of state that we're passing along.

23
00:01:49.453 --> 00:01:52.752
And if we go back to our modal here,
let's destructure these out.

24
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.778
So we have our two pieces of state that
we're now pulling out of our SignUpModal.

25
00:01:59.778 --> 00:02:01.790
That's why we had these
curly braces here earlier.

26
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.445
You don't need curly braces if
you're just returning JSX, but

27
00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:07.178
I knew we were gonna add some animations.

28
00:02:09.778 --> 00:02:13.070
So first thing we need to do is
import some things from react-spring.

29
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.224
So import,
we're just going to use useSpring, and

30
00:02:16.224 --> 00:02:18.313
we're gonna need that animated.

31
00:02:23.278 --> 00:02:25.455
Next, we're gonna define our animation.

32
00:02:25.455 --> 00:02:31.000
So const animation, It's gonna be very
similar to kind of what we just did.

33
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.089
All right, so if our modal is being shown,
we want it to be visible.

34
00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:40.877
Otherwise, we don't want it to be shown
it all, we want it to be transparent, so

35
00:02:40.877 --> 00:02:42.013
it'll fade in and out.

36
00:02:42.013 --> 00:02:45.880
And then transform, so
this'll have it slide in and slide out.

37
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.180
So if modal is visible,
we want it to fall into its natural place.

38
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.043
Otherwise, I'm gonna
animate this out -200%,

39
00:02:56.043 --> 00:02:58.147
just to make sure it really
gets off the screen.

40
00:02:58.147 --> 00:03:01.355
But this is a little bit excessive,
you might not need -200%.

41
00:03:04.377 --> 00:03:07.319
And then the last thing is,
we need to actually tell react-spring,

42
00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.750
this is what's being animated.

43
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.437
And so what I'm gonna do is actually
wrap this in an animated.div here.

44
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.689
Now again, this is not fully accessible,

45
00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.965
you would need to add some aria attributes
on here to make this fully accessible.

46
00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:22.079
But this is what we're working with for
right now.

47
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.897
So technically, if I go back,
this should be working now.

48
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.926
So what's going on here?

49
00:03:39.313 --> 00:03:44.250
[SOUND] Animation, did I spell
something wrong, is assigned a value.

50
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.570
You know what,
does anyone know what my problem is?

51
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.697
What is it, Brent?

52
00:03:48.697 --> 00:03:51.626
&gt;&gt; You've not set the animation
on your animated.div.

53
00:03:51.626 --> 00:03:55.022
&gt;&gt; Perfect, cool, thanks, yeah,
I need to pass that as a style attribute.

54
00:03:55.022 --> 00:03:55.834
&gt;&gt; Got one, yay [LAUGH].

55
00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:57.735
&gt;&gt; Yay, cool.

56
00:03:59.677 --> 00:04:02.030
It's really fast, right,
that's really fast.

57
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.192
So one thing react-spring
comes with is a configuration.

58
00:04:06.192 --> 00:04:08.430
I just wanna show you this, react-spring.

59
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.243
If you go to their website, they have
this fun little tool where you can

60
00:04:13.243 --> 00:04:18.153
actually play around with the tension and
the mass of your animations.

61
00:04:18.153 --> 00:04:22.245
Since it's all physics-based, It's all
mass and tension and all that stuff.

62
00:04:22.245 --> 00:04:24.440
I don't know where on the page it is,
so we're not gonna mess around.

63
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.891
But it does come with a configuration.

64
00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:29.488
And so what I can do is, we can pass
this config option here and say,

65
00:04:29.488 --> 00:04:33.617
I wanna slow this down, let's give
it something really crazy, molasses.

66
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.388
That looks ridiculous, you should
never animate a modal this slowly.

67
00:04:41.388 --> 00:04:44.954
But it can show you that they do come, we
could just set this to slow, for example,

68
00:04:44.954 --> 00:04:46.260
and it's a little bit nicer.

69
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.580
So the longer distance that
you're animating something,

70
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.680
the longer duration it has to have.

71
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.110
Otherwise, it's just way too much.
