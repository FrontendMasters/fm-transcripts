00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.985
So an ID selector is much more specific
than just selecting all h1 tags.

2
00:00:04.985 --> 00:00:07.102
And so whatever has the ID select or

3
00:00:07.102 --> 00:00:10.174
whatever styles are in
that are gonna be applied.

4
00:00:10.174 --> 00:00:15.200
But this is problematic for
several reasons.

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.250
The first is our styles are slowly
becoming decentralized,

6
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.258
because we have three different
ways that we can write CSS.

7
00:00:21.258 --> 00:00:25.701
This can be really hard to remove code, if
you rip out some features of your product,

8
00:00:25.701 --> 00:00:26.900
or if you update them.

9
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.783
It can be hard to update your CSS
if you donÂ´t know where to find it.

10
00:00:30.783 --> 00:00:34.524
And a lack of knowledge about specificity
leads to a lot of importants going on.

11
00:00:38.693 --> 00:00:42.546
So if we look at this code example, we can
see this is selecting every single list

12
00:00:42.546 --> 00:00:44.685
item, and it's setting its color to blue.

13
00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:48.795
And then here, we've got a different way

14
00:00:48.795 --> 00:00:53.500
that we could also be
setting the color to blue.

15
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.038
So we have here, we're selecting
an unordered list with a class of

16
00:00:57.038 --> 00:01:00.779
shopping-cart, and selecting all
immediate children list items.

17
00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:04.663
So it's not gonna do nested list items,
just the top level immediate children,

18
00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:05.872
set their color to blue.

19
00:01:05.872 --> 00:01:09.540
Or you could just select all list items
with a color of shopping-cart-item and

20
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.275
set their color blue with an important,
so that's gonna override everything.

21
00:01:13.275 --> 00:01:16.289
Or you could select your shopping-cart and
then do all children descendants.

22
00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.667
The point being, there's a lot
of ways that you can write CSS.
