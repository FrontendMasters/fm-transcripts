1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.730
I am gonna do one example with you for
the status, and

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.090
then I'm gonna let you do the last two.

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.620
So, doing it together is
gonna help save some time

4
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.270
just because this is
little bit more confusing.

5
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.035
So, we're gonna do status.

6
00:00:11.035 --> 00:00:15.809
And status is this success, error,
and warning buttons down here,

7
00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.301
these colored ones.

8
00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:21.040
So let's do one together.

9
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.700
Let's go into our themes.

10
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.507
And if you go back to the notes
real quick under, where is that,

11
00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:33.229
button variations solution,
I have this status.

12
00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:37.158
So to Brent's question, now I'm gonna
actually create a status object that has

13
00:00:37.158 --> 00:00:39.400
some of these status colors in them.

14
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.650
You can copy and paste this,

15
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.140
it might save some time as opposed
to manually typing them out.

16
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.090
We're all using the same status color.

17
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.600
So that just makes
a little bit more sense.

18
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.920
So let's come in here and
let's add our status object.

19
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.424
Now we haven't imported these,
so let's add yellow, red,

20
00:00:55.424 --> 00:00:58.374
and green to our colors imports, okay?

21
00:00:58.374 --> 00:01:00.884
So now we've got status in our theme.

22
00:01:00.884 --> 00:01:04.424
I'm gonna do the warning with you,
and then we'll take five minutes,

23
00:01:04.424 --> 00:01:06.312
cuz they're gonna be about the same,

24
00:01:06.312 --> 00:01:09.850
it should be pretty easy to fill
in the rest once we do one.

25
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.452
And yeah, so let's do warning.

26
00:01:13.263 --> 00:01:14.218
So let's go back to buttons.

27
00:01:14.218 --> 00:01:17.241
Let's add a warning modifier.

28
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:22.783
Warning, no curly brackets,
so we're doing back-ticks.

29
00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:29.491
Okay, so it looks like our warning
button needs a background color.

30
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:32.502
I'm gonna set this to defaultTheme.status,

31
00:01:32.502 --> 00:01:36.200
cuz we now put it in that stop subject,
dot warningColor.

32
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.595
Our color, let's set that to
defaultTheme status not status,

33
00:01:42.595 --> 00:01:48.840
this is just gonna be
the textColorInverted, textColorInverted.

34
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.390
Now again, these are all gonna have
hover focus and active states.

35
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.480
So let's nest that in here.

36
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.955
So &amp; hover, and again, my hover and
focus are the same, so

37
00:01:58.955 --> 00:02:01.610
I'm just going to use a comma and
join those.

38
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.797
So &amp; focus.

39
00:02:03.797 --> 00:02:07.154
I'm gonna set background-color to

40
00:02:07.154 --> 00:02:13.658
defaultTheme.status.warningColorHover,
warningColorHover.

41
00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:21.759
I'm gonna set an outline to 3 pixels solid

42
00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:27.378
defaultTheme.status.warningColorHover.

43
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.361
And I'm gonna give us an offset.

44
00:02:34.361 --> 00:02:37.504
I think actually, the offset is inherited
already, so I'm gonna leave that out.

45
00:02:37.504 --> 00:02:41.016
If I need it, I'll add it, but
I'm not positive then I do.

46
00:02:41.016 --> 00:02:43.768
And then the last thing is just active,
&amp; active.

47
00:02:43.768 --> 00:02:47.306
So background-color,

48
00:02:47.306 --> 00:02:53.034
defaultTheme.status I can't spell,

49
00:02:53.034 --> 00:03:00.113
defaultTheme.status.warningColorActive.

50
00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:04.999
Okay, so theoretically,
I have a warning modifier, and

51
00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:09.400
theoretically if I add it here,
let's add it here.

52
00:03:16.044 --> 00:03:20.228
It should work, right?

53
00:03:20.228 --> 00:03:23.573
It looks like it works, okay?

54
00:03:23.573 --> 00:03:24.931
But there's a problem.

55
00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:30.281
What if I want this on
my secondary button?

56
00:03:32.785 --> 00:03:35.369
Doesn't look too good, does it?

57
00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:41.590
So the problem with this is that we
are setting the background color.

58
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.257
And by default,
my buttons are ghost buttons,

59
00:03:45.257 --> 00:03:46.923
they don't have a background color.

60
00:03:46.923 --> 00:03:50.103
So one way around this is to
set different modifiers for

61
00:03:50.103 --> 00:03:52.400
your secondary and tertiary buttons.

62
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.310
That's what I'm gonna do today.

63
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.810
However, one other solution would be
the create an actual warning button,

64
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.820
to create an actual warning secondary
button or a warning tertiary button.

65
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.940
What I'm gonna do with this though is
I'm going to set another modifier.

66
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.191
So I'm gonna say warning,
what do I call you, secondary warning?

67
00:04:16.074 --> 00:04:17.528
I'm gonna call you secondary warning.

68
00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:23.590
It didn't update, that's okay.

69
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.960
So I'm gonna call you warning secondary.

70
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.800
The difference here is that our secondary
button does not have a background color.

71
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.583
So background, none.

72
00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:46.788
And we want our border color to be
defaultTheme.status.warningColor.

73
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.202
It's very tedious.

74
00:04:50.202 --> 00:04:54.332
And so what I would suggest.

75
00:04:54.332 --> 00:04:57.060
Here we go, secondary button warning and
tertiary button warning.

76
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.580
I've written these out for you.

77
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.170
I'm not saying this is the best solution.

78
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.410
This is the one we're gonna go with today.

79
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.920
So what this is doing is saying for

80
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.030
a secondary button warning,
these are the styles we need.

81
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.621
As opposed to going and trying to like
override things or creating individual

82
00:05:09.621 --> 00:05:13.062
buttons just for secondary warning,
this is how I'm gonna do it, okay?

83
00:05:13.062 --> 00:05:15.706
So let me,
you can go grab this from the notes.

84
00:05:15.706 --> 00:05:18.780
So secondary button warning is
going to have no background.

85
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.370
It's going to have a border again.

86
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.420
It's just gonna use our warning
color instead of having a fill.

87
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.530
That's our neutral color and
it's gonna set the text color.

88
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.800
Same thing for tertiary button.

89
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.093
So now if I come back and I just say,
this is a secondary button,

90
00:05:34.093 --> 00:05:35.756
I need this modifier.

91
00:05:35.756 --> 00:05:40.093
The hover states are still messed up,
but it shouldn't be.

92
00:05:40.093 --> 00:05:42.885
Let me go back.

93
00:05:42.885 --> 00:05:44.127
See, you know why?

94
00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:50.134
That's why.

95
00:05:50.134 --> 00:05:54.843
It looks a little ridiculous now because
I've double set the border here.

96
00:05:54.843 --> 00:06:00.537
So the reason why is I was setting styles
here on this base warning modifier, right?

97
00:06:00.537 --> 00:06:04.115
And I'm only overriding certain CSS
properties for the secondary button.

98
00:06:04.115 --> 00:06:07.705
I don't want a background
on my secondary button,

99
00:06:07.705 --> 00:06:10.884
but I still need the hover and
focus CSS here.

100
00:06:10.884 --> 00:06:14.201
So in my case, the way I've written this,
I would need both warning and

101
00:06:14.201 --> 00:06:15.545
secondary button warning.

102
00:06:15.545 --> 00:06:17.698
There are definitely better
ways to do this, but

103
00:06:17.698 --> 00:06:20.916
this is the one we're gonna go with
right now, cuz it's very explicit.

104
00:06:20.916 --> 00:06:23.675
So take the next five minutes,
the error and

105
00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:27.860
the success are gonna be generally,
basically the same, right?

106
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.490
You're just gonna be changing
warningColorHover to errorColorHover.

107
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.190
Go ahead and add your error and
your success states.

108
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.160
And try to get them rendering in your UI.

109
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.205
So try to get a success, a warning and
an error button rendering.
