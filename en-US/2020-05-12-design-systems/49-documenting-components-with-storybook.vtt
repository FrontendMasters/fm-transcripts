1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.880
We are gonna be documenting
with Storybook.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.120
I had shown in the interest
slides a couple of different

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.360
tools that you can use, and
I'll show them again at the end.

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.644
Storybook is one tool you can use to
document your components to show code,

5
00:00:13.644 --> 00:00:15.963
to add different features for testing.

6
00:00:15.963 --> 00:00:18.474
And this is really,
really great for a style guide.

7
00:00:18.474 --> 00:00:19.493
So this is what we're gonna use.

8
00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:25.610
So first, let's install Storybook and
we can do this with npx.

9
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.470
I'll make this a little bit bigger here.

10
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.360
Okay, let me clear this.

11
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.999
This is just a mess.

12
00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:41.440
Okay, npx- p @storybook/cli sb init.

13
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.380
If you go to their website,
you can go see this command.

14
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.153
It's also in the notes.

15
00:00:48.153 --> 00:00:52.140
What this is going to do is it's going
to do all the configuration for you.

16
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.110
This will set up a new
directory called stories.

17
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.040
It'll have two default
stories in there for you.

18
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.560
It's even going to ulterior
package.json for these commands.

19
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.750
So it'll set up the build,
it'll set up the dev server,

20
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.960
it'll do all of it for you.

21
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.830
So it will create a stories folder, and
why does it create a stories folder?

22
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.125
It doesn't know the architecture
of your project.

23
00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:14.914
And so it throws it all in
the stories folder, but

24
00:01:14.914 --> 00:01:17.990
when you're developing these stories,
you should put them with the components.

25
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.890
So everything is kind of like
right next to each other.

26
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.050
Storybook actually works
with other frameworks and

27
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.720
libraries that are not just React.

28
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.250
So you can see it said detecting project
type and detecting all that stuff.

29
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.557
And you can use it with Vue and
probably Angular two,

30
00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:32.932
it supports a bunch of things.

31
00:01:36.036 --> 00:01:38.380
So we can see our stories
folder has been created here.

32
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.822
We've got two different stories,
a welcome story and a button story.

33
00:01:45.012 --> 00:01:46.673
We're actually not gonna use any of this,

34
00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.780
I don't really wanna go over it just cuz
some of the notation is a little bit old.

35
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.840
So I would actually prefer
not to go into that.

36
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.657
We're actually just gonna delete that
once Storybook has done installing.

37
00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:59.439
They're gonna be refactoring this new
version of storybook to be using,

38
00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.550
I think a new version of
Chromium is what they said.

39
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.240
I forget exactly what they're changing.

40
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.940
But it doesn't really
make sense to talk about

41
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.900
notation that is potentially
going to be changing.

42
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.986
&gt;&gt; A question.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

43
00:02:10.986 --> 00:02:13.950
&gt;&gt; Who is your target audience for
Storybook?

44
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.668
Is it more development or
more product or a combination of both?

45
00:02:17.668 --> 00:02:22.730
&gt;&gt; Both, so the default Storybook
is gonna show code snippets.

46
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.407
You're gonna be able to test
different states of your components.

47
00:02:25.407 --> 00:02:29.219
But what we're gonna do right now is
gonna documentation, so you can actually

48
00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.628
use this to generate nice documentation
where any developer can go and

49
00:02:32.628 --> 00:02:34.790
see what properties each component needs.

50
00:02:35.912 --> 00:02:40.860
Where any stakeholders like PMs or what
not can go in and read your documentation.

51
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.522
So depending upon how you configure it,
it can be for everyone.

52
00:02:46.305 --> 00:02:51.169
Ideally, what you would be able to do
is create a fully fledged design system

53
00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:54.133
website style guide like
IBM Carbon has done,

54
00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:57.000
like Material Design has done, right?

55
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.990
Ideally, you could go
build this on your own.

56
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.075
I think they're actually using Gatsby,
I could be mistaken.

57
00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:05.200
Gatsby is a great tool for
building static site generators.

58
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.830
But ideally,

59
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.190
a lot of teams building design systems
do not have the time to do this.

60
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.016
And so that's where Story about can
really help us to save a lot of time and

61
00:03:14.016 --> 00:03:15.600
development effort on that.

62
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.430
Storybook has installed, okay.

63
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.480
Once your Storybook is done creating,

64
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.240
you can see again that we
have the stories folder.

65
00:03:26.698 --> 00:03:28.650
And Storybook doesn't know
the architecture of your project, so

66
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.560
again, it's gonna generate
the stories folder.

67
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.112
If we go into our package.json,
let's open this for a second.

68
00:03:35.112 --> 00:03:38.330
One of the things Storybook does is
actually generate two different scripts

69
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.570
for you here.

70
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.420
So we have storybook,
we have build-storybook.

71
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.630
We will build Storybook at the end of
this section just so we can deploy it.

72
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.200
But let's run our Storybook server.

73
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.741
So, let's run npm run storybook.

74
00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:56.285
The other thing Storybook will generate
for you, if you go up to the top,

75
00:03:56.285 --> 00:03:57.981
you'll see this .storybook folder.

76
00:03:57.981 --> 00:03:59.802
It has one file in it I know, main.

77
00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:03.028
And anytime we use an addon,
which we're gonna do in just a second,

78
00:04:03.028 --> 00:04:05.200
we have to add it to this array.

79
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.416
So you should just have a storybook folder
at the top level with a file in it called

80
00:04:08.416 --> 00:04:10.481
main and
you should have a stories directory here.

81
00:04:15.741 --> 00:04:20.621
When you open your Storybook,
when you start your development server,

82
00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:22.705
it should look pretty simple.

83
00:04:24.922 --> 00:04:28.355
So we've got our welcome story which
you can see here in Welcome.stories.js.

84
00:04:28.355 --> 00:04:33.080
And we have a button story that just
has a button in it and an emoji, okay?

85
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.690
We're gonna delete these, so go ahead and
delete your entire stories directory.

86
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.560
We wanna actually create stories
right next the components.
