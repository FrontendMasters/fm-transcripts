00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.640
The first thing I want you to do is,
hopefully,

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.760
you have a primary button
in a default state.

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.760
Go ahead and select that entire button and
right click on it and

4
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.430
you'll see this option that says
Create Component, where is it?

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.630
Mine's already component.

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.500
Let me do this on another art board.

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.780
Okay, I have my little button here.

8
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.066
Select both the text and
this rectangle and

9
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.203
you can create a group out of this, okay?

10
00:00:28.203 --> 00:00:32.299
So if you're on a Mac, its Command G,
or probably Ctrl G on a Windows,

11
00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.730
I would assume.

12
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.055
So now that we've got this group,
you can double click on the label and

13
00:00:38.055 --> 00:00:39.899
say primary button default.

14
00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.590
And once you do that, you can right click,
and it says Create Component here.

15
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.903
So if you click Create Component,
you'll see this turns purple now.

16
00:00:50.903 --> 00:00:54.770
And if we're now on the left side,
there's a toolbar that says Asset.

17
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.940
You can see here we've got our components.

18
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.870
So what that means is we can
actually drag these out.

19
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.650
We can create new instances of our
buttons now, and that's really great.

20
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.180
You're welcome to do that
with all your buttons.

21
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.909
But right now we just need a primary and
default state, okay?

22
00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.895
And we're gonna use this,
we're gonna use this to create a module.
