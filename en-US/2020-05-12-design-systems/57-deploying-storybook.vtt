1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.740
The last step with Storybook is,
we wanna actually deploy this,

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.290
we want everyone to be able to go
to a URL and see what we built.

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.480
So, the first thing we're gonna do,
let's commit, let's commit all of this,

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.930
this is a very big commit.

5
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.640
But let's do Addingstorybook.

6
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.370
Now, we haven't actually initialized
a git-repository here, so let's go and

7
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.410
do that really quickly.

8
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.060
Let's go to GitHub.

9
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.255
And we're gonna create a new repository.

10
00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:32.576
So, my awesome design system.

11
00:00:32.576 --> 00:00:33.638
It's gonna be public.

12
00:00:33.638 --> 00:00:37.080
Don't initialize with a readme,
you can, you totally can.

13
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.400
I'm gonna not, because I want you to see,

14
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.170
if you haven't done this before,
it actually gives you the steps here.

15
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.722
So, the first thing that we need to do,
I'm gonna split screen.

16
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.320
The first thing that we need to do in our
terminal, we can stop our dev server, I am

17
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.765
going to write, git init, this is gonna
to initialize an empty git-repository.

18
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.300
I am then going to add the remote origin.

19
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.349
I'm just gonna copy this for lack of typo.

20
00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.769
So, if you don't initialize
with a readme on GitHub,

21
00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:09.724
it will provide you with
all of these links.

22
00:01:09.724 --> 00:01:11.500
I'm gonna copy and paste that.

23
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.532
So I've now set my upstream.

24
00:01:13.532 --> 00:01:18.630
I'm now gonna push all that code,
so git push upstream origin master.

25
00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:27.160
So now we should have a git-repository, it
should have all of our code on it, great.

26
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.990
Let's build Storybook.

27
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.526
And we to back to package json, if you
remember I said Storybook when we ran that

28
00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:37.220
npx command, it already provides
a build storybook command for you.

29
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.550
So, npm run build-storybook, okay?

30
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.400
This is going to build all of our
Storybook files into a static folder,

31
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.570
which we can then deploy to Netlify.

32
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.510
So it creates a Storybook static folder
and it has all of our files in it.

33
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.420
All right, so
once Storybook is done building,

34
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.450
you should see this Storybook
static folder on your sidebar.

35
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.940
So whilst this one's building,
actually let's go and log into Netlify.

36
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.090
Netlify is an awesome tool for
easily deploying sites,

37
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.860
it allows you to add custom domains really
easily, their documentation is fantastic.

38
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.380
Their team is fantastic, so

39
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.610
I highly recommend using it,
I use it for everything.

40
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.520
So, when you log in,
you're gonna create a new site from Git,

41
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.210
this is why we push it
to our git-repository.

42
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.664
You can also use GitLab or Bitbucket,
but we're gonna use GitHub.

43
00:02:27.664 --> 00:02:29.545
So, select GitHub,

44
00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:33.460
it's going to ask you to authenticate,
I'm already authenticated.

45
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.080
I have an absurd amount of old repository,
so let's search for design system.

46
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.086
We can see that my awesome
design system is recognized, so

47
00:02:45.086 --> 00:02:45.730
I'm gonna click that one.

48
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.594
As far as these build commands,
when we built Storybook,

49
00:02:53.594 --> 00:02:58.110
that already gave us this command, so
we wanna run this specific command.

50
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.076
We don't wanna run yarn-build,
we'll run, npm run build-storybook.

51
00:03:04.076 --> 00:03:10.644
And our publish directory, you can see
here, it published to storybook-static,

52
00:03:10.644 --> 00:03:14.449
so we want this to be storybook-static,
okay?

53
00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:17.877
All we have to do is hit Deploy,
it's gonna work, hopefully, and

54
00:03:17.877 --> 00:03:19.420
it's gonna be really great.

55
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.100
This should probably take about
a minute and a half, two minutes.

56
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.981
And once it deploys, you can see,
this is the URL it's gonna be at, and

57
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:30.091
mystifying-leakey doesn't
sound super nice to me, so

58
00:03:30.091 --> 00:03:32.380
I'm gonna go into Domain Settings here.

59
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.348
Again, they make it super
easy to add a custom domain.

60
00:03:36.348 --> 00:03:38.870
And their documentation
on it is excellent.

61
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.280
So, if we just open this while
it's deploying, you can see,

62
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.350
they have step by step instructions for
how to actually change your DNS.

63
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.760
So that's wonderful.

64
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.006
But, I don't have a custom domain, so
I am just going to click Options and

65
00:03:52.006 --> 00:03:53.183
edit the site name.

66
00:03:53.183 --> 00:04:00.650
And I'm gonna make it called,
emmas-awesome-style-guide, why not?

67
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.820
So when it is published,
this is gonna be the URL.

68
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.720
This is actually exactly how I made
the course website, was with Netlify,

69
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.240
so it's very, very simple to use,
really like it a lot.

70
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:17.160
So, once this is published, it is now
gonna be readily available for everyone.

71
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.616
And, what's really nice is, you can
set up auto deploys anytime you push,

72
00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:26.122
it can build and redeploy,
which is excellent.

73
00:04:26.122 --> 00:04:30.218
Since this is a static site you can
also publish this on GitHub Pages, so.

74
00:04:30.218 --> 00:04:33.765
You don't have to use Netlify,
if you wanna deploy it to GitHub Pages,

75
00:04:33.765 --> 00:04:36.990
you can go into your settings,
and you can do it this way.

76
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.740
Originally I had it this way, but then I
thought Netlify was a lot more seamless.

77
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.700
So if you wanna use GitHub Pages
you can select your branch, and

78
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.260
you can select the folder
that you wanna deploy.

79
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.110
Typically they would go inside of docs.

80
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.772
But Netlify's a lot nicer in
my opinion to work with, so

81
00:04:52.772 --> 00:04:54.850
that's why we picked it today.

82
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.750
Another really cool thing that you can do
with Netlify is, have auto previews for

83
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.600
your pull requests or branches, you can
integrate this with GitHub so that,

84
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.270
if someone opens a pull request or
a branch it'll auto preview it for you.

85
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.970
It'll actually create a URL for
you to use in that pull request,

86
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.049
which is extremely nice.

87
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.370
And one other feature of Netlify,
unfortunately, it's paid, but

88
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.990
to be honest, it's an excellent,
excellent tool, is Analytics.

89
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.520
And so what this does is, if you're open
sourcing your design system, for example,

90
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.450
you probably wanna aggregate data about,

91
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.550
who's accessing your style guide,
where they come from.

92
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.110
This is gonna allow you to kind
of prioritize different things.

93
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.512
So, if the majority of your traffic is
coming from, I don't know, Europe or

94
00:05:34.512 --> 00:05:37.783
somewhere in Asia, or
somewhere else, you can kind of.

95
00:05:37.783 --> 00:05:41.702
For example, if you have a lot of
people from Germany who are accessing

96
00:05:41.702 --> 00:05:46.220
your style guide, perhaps you wanna add
in a language toggle to your Storybook,

97
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.240
that could be another
configuration that you add in.

98
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.600
Guess what?
It's published.

99
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.383
So, we can actually go view it.

100
00:05:54.777 --> 00:05:55.750
And it looks great.

101
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.024
This theme is really on brand.

102
00:05:59.024 --> 00:06:01.526
But, yeah,
your documentation is now public.

103
00:06:01.526 --> 00:06:04.280
You can view the docs here just like
you would a traditional style guide.

104
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.086
So, that is a great way to share
documentation with your company.
