00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.305
Let's take a practical example.

2
00:00:01.305 --> 00:00:04.648
If I haven't convinced you by now that
this is important, let's talk numbers,

3
00:00:04.648 --> 00:00:06.600
engineers like numbers.

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.370
So Nathan Curtis is a very prominent
person within the design systems field.

5
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.105
He has an excellent combination
of blogs over on Medium.

6
00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:18.235
And he wrote a post called you
thought buttons were easy.

7
00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:20.525
So I wanna share some of
the sentiments with you today.

8
00:00:22.445 --> 00:00:23.890
We all know what a button is.

9
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.985
It seems really easy to build,
probably the simplest, but

10
00:00:27.985 --> 00:00:32.665
we have to worry about padding, margin,
border radius, background color,

11
00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:35.290
font size, font family,
color, all these things.

12
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.000
Right, and that's a lot, and buttons are
one of the most frequently used components

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.045
throughout your user interfaces.

14
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.020
But we're not just done once we examine
background color and padding and

15
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.724
all those things, we have to worry
about different states of the button.

16
00:00:48.724 --> 00:00:53.210
So we have to worry about hover,
focus, active, disabled states.

17
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.713
And typically you're not just gonna
have one button in your user interface.

18
00:00:55.713 --> 00:00:57.020
You're gonna have multiple.

19
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.361
So we need a secondary and
tertiary button for all of those states.

20
00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.110
And of course icon buttons.

21
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.680
You're gonna have buttons with just icons,
which aren't great for accessibility,

22
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.020
we'll talk about that, and
you might have buttons with a label.

23
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.798
We are gonna have primary, secondary,
and tertiary buttons with an icon, so

24
00:01:14.798 --> 00:01:19.350
that's a lot And we have different
sizes for different resolutions.

25
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.751
So we're gonna have small buttons and
big buttons and

26
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:23.413
then maybe status buttons, right?

27
00:01:23.413 --> 00:01:26.176
If you're gonna ask a user to
delete their account, maybe,

28
00:01:26.176 --> 00:01:28.410
you might wanna use an error or
a warning button.

29
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.800
That's a lot, so if we add up all
these different buttons, that's

30
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.040
about 14 different button combinations,
approximately, if my math is correct.

31
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.985
And if we have five different states,
like hover, focus, disabled,

32
00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:46.483
and two different sizes, that's about
140 button combinations per theme.

33
00:01:46.483 --> 00:01:47.630
This is just for one theme.

34
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.412
Imagine if we had three themes like
high contrast mode or dark theme.
