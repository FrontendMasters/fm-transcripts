1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.105
To create our modal, let me just
get rid of these so we can focus.

2
00:00:03.105 --> 00:00:08.016
Inside of components,
let's add a modal, new file, Modal.js.

3
00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:11.044
Before we actually build it,
let's just add another index file so

4
00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.055
we can simply just import from components.

5
00:00:15.604 --> 00:00:20.470
So export * from /Buttons, and we're gonna

6
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.474
export everything as well from Modals,
okay?

7
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.616
So in our Figma file,
we had an illustration.

8
00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:36.876
So what you can do is go and
export that illustration as an SVG.

9
00:00:36.876 --> 00:00:42.842
Or if you already have the SVG
saved from your export from Undraw,

10
00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:44.911
you can just use that.

11
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:49.426
If you wanna export it, let me go
back here, you can go to modals and

12
00:00:49.426 --> 00:00:51.371
you can say, where are you?

13
00:00:51.371 --> 00:00:55.817
Under the design tab, there is
an export option down at the bottom.

14
00:00:55.817 --> 00:00:58.560
So you can do export sign up,
export it as an SVG.

15
00:01:00.507 --> 00:01:01.323
Okay.

16
00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:09.185
Inside of source, let's just create
an assets folder that's gonna

17
00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:11.614
hold all of our illustrations,
our icons, etc.

18
00:01:11.614 --> 00:01:17.583
I'm gonna create an illustrations folder,
And

19
00:01:17.583 --> 00:01:20.951
then I'm gonna go and
actually drag this SVG in there.

20
00:01:26.922 --> 00:01:30.608
I'm just gonna rename it to get
rid of that 1 at the end, so

21
00:01:30.608 --> 00:01:32.279
it says sign-up, okay?

22
00:01:37.088 --> 00:01:40.428
Inside of the assets, let's just
create one more file, index.js, so

23
00:01:40.428 --> 00:01:41.707
we can export everything.

24
00:01:41.707 --> 00:01:45.187
So export * from,

25
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.286
Illustrations is gonna be
a little bit different.

26
00:01:53.286 --> 00:01:57.166
So we're gonna have to actually
use our SVG as a source attribute,

27
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.839
we're not gonna inline it.

28
00:01:58.839 --> 00:02:04.705
So the way I'm gonna do that,
Is I'm gonna create a little object here,

29
00:02:04.705 --> 00:02:07.973
export const,
I'm gonna call it Illustrations.

30
00:02:10.237 --> 00:02:15.922
I'm gonna call it SignUp, so import SignUp

31
00:02:15.922 --> 00:02:21.463
from /Illustrations/sign-up.svg.

32
00:02:21.463 --> 00:02:26.841
So what this will do is, it'll export
all of our illustrations in this object.

33
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:28.994
Again, totally, you can do it other ways,

34
00:02:28.994 --> 00:02:31.161
this is the way we're
gonna do it right now.

35
00:02:33.115 --> 00:02:38.507
Also, in our theme, I'm gonna go back and
I'm going to add a new color variable,

36
00:02:38.507 --> 00:02:41.653
I'm gonna call this formElementBackground.

37
00:02:41.653 --> 00:02:46.895
This is gonna be neutral, so our modal
had that neutral 100 that it was using.

38
00:02:46.895 --> 00:02:50.553
But on our dark theme, we don't want it to
be white, we want it to be something else.

39
00:02:50.553 --> 00:02:54.050
So on our default theme,
it's gonna be neutral 100.

40
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.326
And then we want
textOnFormElementBackground,

41
00:02:57.326 --> 00:03:01.850
I'm gonna set this to neutral 600,
so it's gonna be a dark gray.

42
00:03:05.714 --> 00:03:08.480
This is all in the notes,
if you need to go grab those values.

43
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.096
I'm gonna also add this to the dark theme,
but on here,

44
00:03:11.096 --> 00:03:12.941
I'm gonna change this to blue 100.

45
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:14.799
So we can definitely tell the difference.

46
00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.451
Again, this is not gonna look very good,
it's gonna look horrible, actually.

47
00:03:18.451 --> 00:03:21.080
And I wouldn't use this in production,

48
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.030
it's just kinda to see
the difference here.

49
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.202
So let's build a modal.

50
00:03:25.202 --> 00:03:28.474
I'm gonna close all of these files,
close all to the right.

51
00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:31.237
Let's import React.

52
00:03:33.722 --> 00:03:36.652
We're gonna need React, and
we're gonna need styled components here,

53
00:03:36.652 --> 00:03:38.508
we're gonna do a little combination, okay?

54
00:03:38.508 --> 00:03:41.570
Import React from react, and
we're gonna import styled from styled.

55
00:03:46.247 --> 00:03:47.678
Let's create a modal wrapper.

56
00:03:47.678 --> 00:03:50.499
This is gonna contain all of
the styling for our actual modal.

57
00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:54.381
So const ModalWrapper,
it's gonna be a div.

58
00:03:56.934 --> 00:04:00.968
I'm gonna give it, and this again is
gonna look just like your Figma creation.

59
00:04:00.968 --> 00:04:03.249
So whatever yours looks like,
feel free to go add that in here.

60
00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:07.588
Mine was 800 pixels wide,
and it was a height of 500.

61
00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.924
I also added a box shadow,
which is gonna be 0 5px, 16px.

62
00:04:14.924 --> 00:04:17.668
And this is where that
rgba value comes in.

63
00:04:17.668 --> 00:04:20.507
So I want it to be black,
but at 0.2% alpha, so

64
00:04:20.507 --> 00:04:22.614
it's gonna be pretty transparent.

65
00:04:28.293 --> 00:04:29.722
For a background color,

66
00:04:29.722 --> 00:04:33.677
we just defined those two themes,
so we´re gonna take props again.

67
00:04:33.677 --> 00:04:38.727
We wanna grab that formElementBackground.

68
00:04:38.727 --> 00:04:39.995
It´s gonna be the same for color,

69
00:04:39.995 --> 00:04:41.885
I´m just gonna copy it to
save a little bit of time.

70
00:04:41.885 --> 00:04:48.274
It´s gonna be textOnFormElementBackground,
textOnFormElementBackground.

71
00:04:50.408 --> 00:04:52.471
We're gonna use flex box,
so let's display flex.

72
00:04:52.471 --> 00:04:54.616
This will align our items very nicely.

73
00:04:54.616 --> 00:04:56.844
We're gonna give it
a flex-direction of column.

74
00:04:59.311 --> 00:05:02.542
We want this all to be aligned in
the center, so justify-content center.

75
00:05:02.542 --> 00:05:06.549
I also want this to be both vertically and
horizontally centered, so

76
00:05:06.549 --> 00:05:07.943
align-items center.

77
00:05:07.943 --> 00:05:13.539
I am also gonna give this
a position of relative,

78
00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.642
we'll see why in just a little bit.

79
00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:25.134
A little bit of a border-radius,
and that's it.

80
00:05:25.134 --> 00:05:27.620
Okay, so we've got our wrapper.

81
00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.157
Now let's actually create
the content that goes inside.

82
00:05:32.157 --> 00:05:38.143
So I'm gonna put this under here,
we need our typeScale,

83
00:05:38.143 --> 00:05:41.818
so import typeScale from /utils.

84
00:05:41.818 --> 00:05:49.185
I wanna create the header,
SignUpHeader, it's gonna be an h3.

85
00:05:52.946 --> 00:05:55.898
So we want our h3 to have the font
size of an h3, so let's do that.

86
00:05:55.898 --> 00:06:00.386
So font-size is typeScale.h3, header3.

87
00:06:05.488 --> 00:06:08.952
And back on my modal, you can see,
so this is our header three.

88
00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:11.638
This is our text content, so
let's create that as well.

89
00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:17.891
SignUpText is gonna be styled.p,
it's gonna be a paragraph tag.

90
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.599
Again, let's set our font size,
typeScale.paragraph.

91
00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:28.552
I'm gonna give this text
a max-width of 70%.

92
00:06:28.552 --> 00:06:30.721
You can see otherwise,
it would span the whole container.

93
00:06:30.721 --> 00:06:34.457
We don't really want that,
so max-width of 70%.

94
00:06:34.457 --> 00:06:36.950
And I just want the text
to be aligned to center.

95
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.116
So we'll do text-align of center, Center.
