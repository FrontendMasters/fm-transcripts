1
00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.311
We're gonna create a modal now,
modals are fun.

2
00:00:02.311 --> 00:00:03.940
Modals are composite component.

3
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.185
So while buttons are an atomic components,
they're just an atom,

4
00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:11.220
that's Brad Frost, his atomic design.

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.260
A modal is gonna be an organism, I think,

6
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.312
I like to call it a composite component
cuz it's made up of other components.

7
00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:22.210
We're gonna create the sign up modal
together, and then you're going to create

8
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.520
a second one using these text fields
that I've already provided for you.

9
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.810
So first, let's create a rectangle in your
fingerboard, if you don't have a modals

10
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.560
page here, just go ahead and create one,
there shouldn't be anything in it.

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.129
I'm gonna create an artboard, an artboard
is just a space to design within,

12
00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.180
you can press A, if you type A,
it will let you drag, just an art board.

13
00:00:48.342 --> 00:00:50.170
They are also on the right side
here if you're designing for

14
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.880
a Macbook or a tablet, those are pre
determined artboard sizes, but

15
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.710
you can also just drag and
create a new one.

16
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.690
So I have an artboard,
I don't know where that came from.

17
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.712
I am not gonna draw
a rectangle by pressing R, and

18
00:01:03.712 --> 00:01:05.571
I'm just gonna draw a shape.

19
00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:09.554
I'm gonna manually change these sizes, so

20
00:01:09.554 --> 00:01:16.346
I am going to make mine 800 by 580,
so 800 width, 580 height.

21
00:01:16.346 --> 00:01:18.348
And my artboard is clearly not big enough,
so

22
00:01:18.348 --> 00:01:20.574
I'm just gonna make that a little bigger,
okay?

23
00:01:20.574 --> 00:01:28.972
So I have a square, hopefully you have
those neutrals saved as color variables.

24
00:01:28.972 --> 00:01:32.772
If you don't, that's okay,
you're just gonna again, select that,

25
00:01:32.772 --> 00:01:36.527
press this little menu, create a new
color and call it neutral 300.

26
00:01:36.527 --> 00:01:39.452
I'm gonna do one for
this as well neutral 200, and

27
00:01:39.452 --> 00:01:43.612
we're gonna do this because we're gonna
use this color value in our modal.

28
00:01:43.612 --> 00:01:48.236
So we select this rectangle,
press those four dots,

29
00:01:48.236 --> 00:01:52.364
I'm gonna set this to
my neutral 200 value.

30
00:01:52.364 --> 00:01:56.763
Actually, let's do neutral 100, that's
a little bit better, well, that's white.

31
00:01:56.763 --> 00:02:00.834
Yeah, let's do white, let's add white,
we're gonna give it a back shadow.

32
00:02:00.834 --> 00:02:05.371
So let me save this real fast,
neutral 100.

33
00:02:08.074 --> 00:02:12.517
So I'm gonna go back, let's get my
rectangle and neutral 100 value,

34
00:02:12.517 --> 00:02:13.314
there we go.

35
00:02:13.314 --> 00:02:14.896
And I'm gonna add a box shadow.

36
00:02:14.896 --> 00:02:17.473
So if I go under effects here,
press the plus button,

37
00:02:17.473 --> 00:02:19.208
it's gonna give you a drop shadow.

38
00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:26.485
If you click this little sun icon here,
it pops up in this little tooltip dialogue

39
00:02:26.485 --> 00:02:29.069
thing where you can
actually set blur X and Y.

40
00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.205
I'm gonna give it a blur of
16 an X of 0 and a Y of 5.

41
00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:38.547
If you need these values again,
they're on in the course website, so

42
00:02:38.547 --> 00:02:42.603
you can go grab that one,
Making a modal that's where we're at.

43
00:02:42.603 --> 00:02:45.395
So we've got 16, 0, and
5 for our back shadow,

44
00:02:45.395 --> 00:02:48.006
this is giving some elevation here,
all right?

45
00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:51.470
So we want our model to have
an illustration and an icon,

46
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.620
let's just add our button right?

47
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.383
We know we need our primary
button in a default state.

48
00:02:55.383 --> 00:03:00.632
So we'll come back over to assets again,
we can drag that in, there we go.

49
00:03:00.632 --> 00:03:03.423
Oop, if you wanna lock this,
if you right click it, so

50
00:03:03.423 --> 00:03:06.850
locking it means you can't move it around,
which is really nice.

51
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.553
Cuz I accidentally just tried to move it,
you can lock it.

52
00:03:09.553 --> 00:03:13.452
So now it doesn't matter,
I can't select this, that's really nice.

53
00:03:13.452 --> 00:03:21.063
So I've got my Submit button here,
and let's go get an illustration.

54
00:03:21.063 --> 00:03:25.355
My favorite place to go is undraw.co, and

55
00:03:25.355 --> 00:03:31.092
if you browse now this is created,
it is all open source.

56
00:03:31.092 --> 00:03:34.438
You don't have to add any contributions
to Catarina or to UnDraw,

57
00:03:34.438 --> 00:03:37.979
you can use them in your designs and
you can even change the color here.

58
00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:44.232
So what I'd like you to do is take
your primary color, let's see mine.

59
00:03:44.232 --> 00:03:45.122
What value is this?

60
00:03:45.122 --> 00:03:47.841
If you are in your right hand
side on your design panel, and

61
00:03:47.841 --> 00:03:51.130
you click this little settings thing,
it'll give you a color title.

62
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.787
Even though grab that hex value,
I'm gonna copy that hex value and

63
00:03:54.787 --> 00:03:56.040
paste it into UnDraw.

64
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.221
And look all those illustrations
now match my primary color.

65
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:04.155
We're gonna create a sign in modal,
you can call it whatever you want, but

66
00:04:04.155 --> 00:04:06.097
I'm gonna stick with sign in modal.

67
00:04:06.097 --> 00:04:11.712
So I'm gonna actually search
let's say search for a login.

68
00:04:11.712 --> 00:04:16.658
So I had this one mobile login, you can
choose whichever illustration you want,

69
00:04:16.658 --> 00:04:18.562
go ahead and download the SVG.

70
00:04:18.562 --> 00:04:21.968
So once it's downloaded,
just simply drag it in,

71
00:04:21.968 --> 00:04:26.654
you can just drag it into Figma, and
it's obviously a little bit big.

72
00:04:26.654 --> 00:04:31.450
We wanna resize this,
hold down the shift key and resize it.

73
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.950
This will scale it appropriately, so
it'll maintain all of its proportions.

74
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.197
If I didn't hold Shift + Down,
I can squish it, and I don't like that,

75
00:04:38.197 --> 00:04:40.023
it's not maintaining its proportion.

76
00:04:40.023 --> 00:04:44.824
So hold down the Shift key and
resize it, and now I can place it here.

77
00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:50.263
I'm gonna add some text in here,
so on mine,

78
00:04:50.263 --> 00:04:52.490
I did sign up Sign up today to get access.

79
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.007
You can just whatever you want, right?

80
00:04:54.007 --> 00:04:54.632
It's just placeholder text.

81
00:04:54.632 --> 00:04:58.973
So I press T, and we'll do sign up.

82
00:04:58.973 --> 00:05:02.125
Now if you have all of your headers done,

83
00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:05.665
you can just apply that
header to your modal.

84
00:05:05.665 --> 00:05:10.689
So if I have this, let me just add this so
Each to, so go back to modal,

85
00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:14.688
select your text and
then give it that Each to styling.

86
00:05:14.688 --> 00:05:18.964
And it's appropriately sized
with your type scale, right?

87
00:05:18.964 --> 00:05:24.987
Add a little description, Sign up today,
and you get access to cool things.

88
00:05:24.987 --> 00:05:27.420
As always, that's a little too big,
let's make this a paragraph.

89
00:05:30.654 --> 00:05:33.870
Okay, we'll just centre
align all this stuff.

90
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.465
Let's say you're really bad at
determining whether this is all centred,

91
00:05:37.465 --> 00:05:39.928
what you can do is just drag and
highlight all of it.

92
00:05:39.928 --> 00:05:44.084
At the top right here you can see we've
got all these different alignment icons.

93
00:05:44.084 --> 00:05:48.176
So I just like to hit both of the centre,
so centre horizontally and

94
00:05:48.176 --> 00:05:52.507
this obviously isn't correct,
that centre's at all in the centre.

95
00:05:52.507 --> 00:05:57.335
But now these are all vertically centred,
so if I move this, and it's totally off,

96
00:05:57.335 --> 00:06:00.124
if you press that,
it will totally snap, okay?

97
00:06:00.124 --> 00:06:02.941
And if you group this,
if you hit Command + G,

98
00:06:02.941 --> 00:06:06.063
when you highlighted over,
neither of the group.

99
00:06:06.063 --> 00:06:11.083
I can drag them around, and I can place
them at the centre here of my modal.

100
00:06:11.083 --> 00:06:13.016
The last thing we'll just
need is a close button.

101
00:06:13.016 --> 00:06:16.860
So Danielle brought up a good point
at the last break that I forget to

102
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.793
tell you where you can get icons.

103
00:06:18.793 --> 00:06:22.482
If you go to the nounproject.com,
you can get icons.

104
00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:26.955
So I just searched for close,
you can just pick one of these,

105
00:06:26.955 --> 00:06:31.900
you might need to sign in to
get an account, but it is free.

106
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.881
So just click this icon,
get a basic download.

107
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:37.362
If you're gonna be using this in
production, please pay for it and

108
00:06:37.362 --> 00:06:38.660
please give appropriate credit.

109
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.216
Today, we're just gonna be using this
just for our internal purposes but again,

110
00:06:43.216 --> 00:06:45.273
please give credit to the creators.

111
00:06:45.273 --> 00:06:47.075
You're gonna want the SPVG,

112
00:06:47.075 --> 00:06:51.413
so again, download that icon and
we could just drag it in Figma, okay?

113
00:06:51.413 --> 00:06:54.990
So now I've got a close icon,
and that's it.

114
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.122
So now we've got a little modal.
