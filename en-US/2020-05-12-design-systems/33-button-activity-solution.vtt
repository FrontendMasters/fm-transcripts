00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.202
Hopefully you were able to add your
secondary and tertiary button styles.

2
00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:05.071
Let's go ahead, I'm gonna add mine in.

3
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:08.858
So, export const.

4
00:00:08.858 --> 00:00:10.952
This is gonna be a named export, okay?

5
00:00:10.952 --> 00:00:12.390
So as opposed to the default export.

6
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.270
I will refactor that later,
so don't worry about it.

7
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.797
export const,
I'm gonna do a SecondaryButton.

8
00:00:17.797 --> 00:00:20.062
And again,
this is gonna be a styled button.

9
00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:24.232
Not an HTML button,
our button that we just created.

10
00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:27.410
So my secondary button,
if I go look at my Figma file, and

11
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.610
yours can look just like
however your buttons look like.

12
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.882
Let me find my Figma file here.

13
00:00:32.882 --> 00:00:40.620
If I go back and look at my Buttons tab,
We can see mine is a ghost button, okay?

14
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.842
So mine's not gonna have a background.

15
00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:44.727
So I'm gonna set background to none.

16
00:00:44.727 --> 00:00:51.261
I'm gonna set a border of 2px solid,
and I want it my primaryBlue.

17
00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:56.441
And I am going to set my
color also to primaryBlue.

18
00:00:57.541 --> 00:00:59.450
My tertiary button's gonna
look pretty similar.

19
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.420
So I'm just gonna copy and paste that for
the sake of saving a little bit of time.

20
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.982
This'll be TertiaryButton,
again, no background on mine.

21
00:01:06.982 --> 00:01:10.641
It just simply looks like a link,
so my border's also gonna be none.

22
00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:12.644
But I don't need to
explicitly state border none,

23
00:01:12.644 --> 00:01:15.770
just because it's already declared
up here in our base Button.

24
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.429
It's not, I lied, it's not declared,
I'm gonna set border to none.

25
00:01:20.665 --> 00:01:22.661
Okay, and again, color is primaryBlue.

26
00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:26.649
So now that we have those exported,
let's go import them.

27
00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.886
Since these are named imports, we're gonna
do SecondaryButton and TertiaryButton.

28
00:01:34.162 --> 00:01:38.645
And since we're gonna be returning
multiple items, and we know in React we

29
00:01:38.645 --> 00:01:42.863
have to have one top level,
I'm just gonna surround those with a div.

30
00:01:42.863 --> 00:01:46.765
We've got our primary button and we've
got, just gonna copy and paste twice.

31
00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:50.135
I'm gonna use that same trick by
highlighting this PrimaryButton,

32
00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:53.110
hitting Cmd+D once, and
changing it to SecondaryButton.

33
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.839
Let's do the same with TertiaryButton.

34
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.480
And I'm gonna change this to Goodbye
world, and I don't know, Hey world, okay.

35
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.360
And so now, if I come back, you can
see they're all being rendered here.

36
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.670
If you have different CSS, totally fine,

37
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.310
it should look like
your component library.
