1
00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.680
So how do you actually build a system?

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.875
This is kind of the general flow.

3
00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:08.144
So you define your design principles,
conduct a UI audit, create your checklist,

4
00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:09.260
and define your workflows.

5
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.051
So let's kind of examine
what all of these mean.

6
00:00:14.293 --> 00:00:18.211
Design principles are really the grounding
values that drive the creation of your

7
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:18.787
products.

8
00:00:18.787 --> 00:00:21.470
And they really encompass
the question like,

9
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.057
what do you want your users to
feel when they use your product?

10
00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:29.910
And this is gonna drive
the creation of your components.

11
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.680
So if someone comes with a proposition for
a new component and

12
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.960
it doesn't fit with your design
principles say, this isn't gonna work,

13
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.960
it's not gonna work with our system.

14
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.770
So this is a design
principle from Atlassian.

15
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.780
And there's as bold,
optimistic, and practical.

16
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.430
So that's the first step,
define your design principles.

17
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.891
What do you want your users to feel
when they use your application?

18
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.700
So most of us are probably working on
legacy applications that already exists.

19
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.220
You're probably not building a design
system in a silo from scratch.

20
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.420
And what that means is your UI is
probably comprised of a lot of different

21
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.300
combinations of components.

22
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.270
And so, the next step is a UI audit.

23
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.320
So you need to go through your UI,
through your products.

24
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.050
Take screenshots of every component
in every single state that exists and

25
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.500
throw it into a common place,

26
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.150
whether that's a sketch file, a figma
file, a Google Drive, something or other.

27
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.120
And then you group them by functionality.

28
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.330
We're not gonna group them
by visual appearance,

29
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.400
because visual appearance can kind
of change and evolve over time, but

30
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.100
the functionality, the underlying
functionality is gonna be the same.

31
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.940
So once we conduct our UI audit,

32
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.540
we actually have to prioritize,
we're gonna have a lot of components.

33
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.010
How do we actually pick and choose what
we're gonna work on first, especially if

34
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.400
we don't have a dedicated design team or
if we don't have that many team members?

35
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.999
So we need to figure out
how to prioritize them.

36
00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:50.606
And we wanna focus on the things that
are gonna have the highest impact and

37
00:01:50.606 --> 00:01:51.800
be easily achievable.

38
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.360
So some of the questions you're gonna
wanna ask yourself and I like to put these

39
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.100
in a survey, an online survey that you can
give to product management to design and

40
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.490
engineering and
have all of them take these surveys.

41
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.150
Because in integrating a new component to
your system does not just impact design,

42
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.380
it doesn't just impact engineering,
it's gonna impact all of them.

43
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.330
So you need to kind of make sure that
all three areas are really covered.

44
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.690
And these are some of
the questions you might wanna ask.

45
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.770
Does this request or does this
component embody our design principles?

46
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.730
Is this going to require a lot
of design or development effort?

47
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.460
Does this come with a high risk
to the success of our product?

48
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.468
Is it gonna break things potentially?

49
00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:36.755
Does this coincide with
our product roadmap?

50
00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:39.008
Is this something that we can actually
fit into our current workflow?

51
00:02:41.256 --> 00:02:43.373
Is this going to actually
improve the UX of our products?

52
00:02:43.373 --> 00:02:45.020
Is this is gonna make
our users lives better?

53
00:02:47.345 --> 00:02:48.803
Are we confident in this decision or

54
00:02:48.803 --> 00:02:50.900
is it gonna have to be
revisited in the near future?

55
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.870
And is this technically feasible?

56
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.690
If we can't build it,
we shouldn't even be wasting time on it.

57
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.970
So we can kinda take these statements,
or take these questions and

58
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.280
turn them into impact statements.

59
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.450
And then we're gonna evaluate
them on some metrics.

60
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.000
So we've got two different
kinds of metrics.

61
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.770
We have adoption metrics that indicate
this component should be prioritized.

62
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.100
This is a great component to integrate.

63
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.640
And we have opposition metrics.

64
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.441
So these are ones that are saying, well,

65
00:03:18.441 --> 00:03:21.846
you might wanna actually not focus on
this right now, it has a lower priority.

66
00:03:21.846 --> 00:03:24.718
And we're gonna examine these from impact,
identity, and

67
00:03:24.718 --> 00:03:27.150
competence, and maintenance,
risk and effort.

68
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.519
Those are the metric areas.

69
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.640
This is a lot, this is a big slide.

70
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.450
But this is essentially telling
you how you can calculate

71
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.120
the priority of a component and
actually plot this on a graph.

72
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.560
And why this is great is you're
gonna have a lot of stakeholders,

73
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.430
people are going to be
watching your system.

74
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.130
And oftentimes, this is twofold.

75
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.488
One is, you will get people who
question your decisions and

76
00:03:47.488 --> 00:03:50.440
one is why you've prioritized
component A over B.

77
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.050
And this gives you a mathematical
equation actually tell them this is why.

78
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.919
This was super risky to do,
this is gonna take a long time to build.

79
00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.727
So it's less of a priority
than different component.

80
00:04:00.727 --> 00:04:05.170
So essentially you're gonna
create these impact statements.

81
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.030
You're gonna have your designers,
your engineers,

82
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.448
your product managers, all take a survey
that kind of evaluates these metrics.

83
00:04:10.448 --> 00:04:14.720
And you're gonna get this an adopter
score and an opposer score.

84
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.770
So what's the priority?

85
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:17.630
Should it be a high priority?

86
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.292
Should it be a low priority?
And

87
00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:22.702
we're just basically gonna like average
these together across all people who've

88
00:04:22.702 --> 00:04:23.397
taken this.

89
00:04:23.397 --> 00:04:27.207
And we're gonna get an X, Y value out of
this, and we can plot that on a graph.

90
00:04:27.207 --> 00:04:28.740
It's gonna be a four quadrant graph.

91
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.370
So in the top right,
we've got priority one.

92
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.815
This means it's a strong adopter and
it's a weak opposer.

93
00:04:34.815 --> 00:04:36.163
And these are wins, right?

94
00:04:36.163 --> 00:04:40.535
If something is gonna be really impactful
on unifying our UIs and our products,

95
00:04:40.535 --> 00:04:45.310
and it's really not very risky, it's
not gonna require a lot of maintenance.

96
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.080
Yeah, let's focus on that, that's great.

97
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.020
Priority two, in the bottom right,
the strong adopter, but

98
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.235
it's also a strong opposer.

99
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.429
So maybe it's going to
require a lot of maintenance.

100
00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.905
In that case,
maybe try to mitigate the opposition.

101
00:04:59.905 --> 00:05:03.540
What the nice thing about this is you can
point to exactly the opposition metric.

102
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.660
That's the issue, like you can say,

103
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.810
maintenance is gonna be a huge issue or I
don't remember what my other metrics were.

104
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.080
But you can point to the exact
metric that is the problem and

105
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.540
maybe try to do something to fix that and
get it up into the top right quadrant.

106
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.980
Priority three are weak adopters,
weak opposers.

107
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.670
So you're gonna wanna focus on the other
components before starting these.

108
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.970
And then parking lot I don't like to say
throw them out, cuz no idea is a bad idea.

109
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.293
But these are kinda things that aren't
gonna give you a lot of benefit, but

110
00:05:32.293 --> 00:05:35.144
they have a lot of risk associated or
maintenance associated and

111
00:05:35.144 --> 00:05:38.768
should be kind of just put off to the side
until you need something else to work on.

112
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.719
So let's take a little example.

113
00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:45.445
So buttons, let's say we go through this
whole process, we have our designers,

114
00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:47.340
our engineers, our product managers.

115
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.173
All take this survey and
let's say we get an average score of four,

116
00:05:51.173 --> 00:05:52.550
four out of five point.

117
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.710
It will put it up in this upper
right quadrant, priority one.

118
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.110
So buttons are gonna have a high impact,

119
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.510
they're really gonna unify our products
and they're gonna help brand identity.

120
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.540
They do however,
require a lot of maintenance and effort.

121
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.800
They might have to be revisited a couple
of times in terms of styling and

122
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.140
things like that, but
they're gonna have a good impact.

123
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.539
So those maybe be priority one.

124
00:06:16.036 --> 00:06:17.413
And let´s take something
like an accordion.

125
00:06:17.413 --> 00:06:21.292
You're probably not gonna use accordion
through out your products too

126
00:06:21.292 --> 00:06:22.202
often, right?

127
00:06:22.202 --> 00:06:24.023
Buttons are definitely
gonna be used a lot more.

128
00:06:24.023 --> 00:06:27.615
And accordions are complex,
they're not a native HTML element or

129
00:06:27.615 --> 00:06:31.027
a semantic element that you can
just instantiate and it works.

130
00:06:31.027 --> 00:06:34.186
There's something you have to build,
you have to add accessibility concerns,

131
00:06:34.186 --> 00:06:37.010
the way and make sure it's accessible,
and things like that.

132
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.180
So it would be a low adopter.

133
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.410
And we shouldn't focus on
that as much as buttons, or

134
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.930
other four elements for example.

135
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.047
So this is kind of how you can
mathematically graph the priority

136
00:06:50.047 --> 00:06:53.129
of your components and give that
to stakeholders and be like, hey,

137
00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:55.098
here's our priority list and this is why.
