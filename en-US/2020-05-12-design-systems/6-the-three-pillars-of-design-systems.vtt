00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.740
Let's actually run through a scenario.

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.320
So let's say we have a designer, engineer,
and a quality assurance engineer

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.990
all working on building, testing,
and designing this button.

4
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.880
And let's say they're about $100 an hour.

5
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.570
Okay, so that's $300 per hour.

6
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.930
And let's say it takes a week and a half.

7
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.210
So that's about 66.6
hours of work per person.

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.770
That's $20,000 dollars.

9
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.710
And if you have 50 teams, like if you work
at a large enterprise company like IBM or

10
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.200
Google, if you have 50 teams and
building buttons, that's a lot of money.

11
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.210
That's a million dollars that
you're spending on buttons,

12
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.230
which is utterly absurd to me.

13
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.610
So you really need a design system.

14
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.870
So there are three kind of
pillars of design systems and

15
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.070
they are the design language, the
component library, and the style guide.

16
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.180
So the design language is gonna
be like your personality,

17
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.180
you're gonna take your brand
identity of your company and

18
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.540
you're gonna put it into living breathing
components and foundational elements.

19
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.380
So the foundation is color, typography,
grid, those kinds of things.

20
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.980
And the UI kit they're gonna be
things like buttons, modols,

21
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.810
anything that's designed as a component,
which we'll be creating today.

22
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.250
Then we take those design components and

23
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.660
we actually build them
into a component library.

24
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.390
And we can build it with a ton
of different frameworks and

25
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.950
technologies like Vue, React, Angular.

26
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.240
You can use CSS,
pre-processors, CSS-in-JS.

27
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.870
We'll talk about these things today.

28
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.940
But the important thing is if
you're building a design system,

29
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.540
you need to meet your
developers where they're at.

30
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.930
So if they're using Angular, don't build
them a design system component library in

31
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.130
React, they're not gonna use it.

32
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.730
So just be aware of kind of like
what the current tech stack is and

33
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.640
try to frame your system around that.

34
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.230
And the style guide is the documentation,
it tells your designers and

35
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.870
engineers where to go to get assets,
how to actually get up and running.

36
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.400
How to integrate it, how to open pull
requests and things like that and

37
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.510
there are many technologies you
can use to build your style guide.

38
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.135
We're gonna use story book today.

39
00:01:56.135 --> 00:02:00.460
I love using Gatsby, I use Gatsby at work
and this is great if you work with React.

40
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.480
You can also use other static site
generators for different frameworks.

41
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.169
But these are just a couple of tools.
