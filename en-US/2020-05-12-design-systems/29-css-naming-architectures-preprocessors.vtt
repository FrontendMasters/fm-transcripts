00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.720
There's a lot of ways
that you can write CSS.

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.125
And one of the ways that people tried
to combat this is with CSS naming

3
00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:07.032
architectures.

4
00:00:07.032 --> 00:00:10.450
You might have heard of bem, it's a block
element modifier which we can see here.

5
00:00:11.815 --> 00:00:15.840
Naming architectures were kind of created
to superficially scope our styles, but

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.240
they don't actually prevent styles from
leaking into elements that we don't

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.670
want them to be styled on.

8
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.790
So we can see here this block
element modifier type of styling.

9
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.320
So those two underscores differentiate
the block and the element.

10
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.440
So the block is the shopping cart and
the element is the item within that.

11
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.590
A modifier you would see two hyphens, and

12
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.680
this would be shopping cart items
selected or shopping cart item disabled.

13
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.180
It's just kind of like a modifier,
for example.

14
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.640
But again this doesn't
prevent leaked styling.

15
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.703
So technically if this is styling
all of these shopping cart items,

16
00:00:51.703 --> 00:00:53.782
maybe their color is gonna be red.

17
00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:57.118
Maybe there's a style somewhere else
that's actually influencing, or

18
00:00:57.118 --> 00:00:59.592
yeah, maybe it's actually
styling this list item and

19
00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:01.542
we don't know where that's coming from.

20
00:01:01.542 --> 00:01:03.446
So that's problematic.

21
00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:05.480
And this is where pre-processors came in.

22
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.167
This was really a great,
great tool for a long time.

23
00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:10.183
You've probably heard of SAS or LES.

24
00:01:10.183 --> 00:01:14.760
These are pre-processors and these provide
a bunch of capabilities, like nesting.

25
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.670
So we can now select our shopping cart,
and

26
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.130
it plays very nicely with this block
element modifier naming architecture.

27
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.482
We can just use this ampersand,
two underscores to select the element, and

28
00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:28.799
the two hyphens to select the modifier.

29
00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.828
So at this point, our styles are scoping.

30
00:01:31.828 --> 00:01:32.798
It's really, really nice.

31
00:01:32.798 --> 00:01:34.778
And they allow us to create mixins or

32
00:01:34.778 --> 00:01:38.018
functions that can be applied
to our styles in all of this.
