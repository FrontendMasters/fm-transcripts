00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.580
Let's take a look.

2
00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.600
So we've got we had our warning before.

3
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.400
And now we've got a primary button error,
a secondary button error,

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.560
a tertiary button error, and then just a
base error class is going to actually set

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.832
like all of the hover active,
and should be also focus in here.

6
00:00:14.832 --> 00:00:19.140
It's gonna set the state since they're
all the same, just add that there.

7
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.050
These are exactly the same
as what we just did.

8
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.710
So we don't need to spend
too much time going over it.

9
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.200
I also added a couple of modifiers so I
should have a small error primary button.

10
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.640
I should have a large
warning secondary button and

11
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.360
I should have a success treasury button.

12
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.745
And when I come in here I can see
that all of the styles are being

13
00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:38.875
applied appropriately, okay.

14
00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:41.455
So like I mentioned, this is
probably not the best way to do it,

15
00:00:41.455 --> 00:00:43.415
this is one way to do it.

16
00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:46.405
And if you have other solutions,
feel free to let me know.

17
00:00:46.405 --> 00:00:49.695
I always like to learn about
different ways that we can

18
00:00:50.865 --> 00:00:54.985
help apply these styles for some of
these statuses to secondary and tertiary
