WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.569
We're gonna create some documentation, so
we're gonna install a couple of ad-ons.

2
00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:06.009
Ad-ons are packages that you can install,
and

3
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:08.760
use with storybook to add
additional capabilities.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.631
We're gonna have a bunch of them,
so let's install them now, npm i,

5
00:00:13.631 --> 00:00:21.387
let me make this bigger here, we're
gonna do Okay, that was my own thing.

6
00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:25.356
Npm i, we're gonna do renew
app storybook slash preset,

7
00:00:25.356 --> 00:00:30.544
create react app, so we're telling story,
but this is a create react app.

8
00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:38.326
We're gonna install actions,
I have to believe that storybook

9
00:00:38.326 --> 00:00:45.669
actions though we'll find out,
And add-on docs.

10
00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:48.572
Okay, so those three and
those are on the website,

11
00:00:48.572 --> 00:00:52.092
feel free to go grab them and
they're using add-on section.

12
00:00:54.623 --> 00:00:57.170
When we add these add-ons
every time we add

13
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.141
an add-on we have to tell
storybook about it, and

14
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:04.269
we can do that by going to this main
file up here that I just mentioned.

15
00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.191
So, anytime we add an add-on
it has to go in here.

16
00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:11.298
So, while that's loading let's
go ahead and do that, so,

17
00:01:11.298 --> 00:01:15.967
lets add our preset create react
app is actually already added here,

18
00:01:15.967 --> 00:01:18.798
so I actually didn't need to install it.

19
00:01:18.798 --> 00:01:23.047
We also have actions and so
I don't know why I just added those but

20
00:01:23.047 --> 00:01:25.654
that's fine, not harming anything.

21
00:01:25.654 --> 00:01:30.329
And then we just need to add our docs, so

22
00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.022
@storybook/addon-docs.

23
00:01:34.022 --> 00:01:36.595
This is gonna give us
that documentation for

24
00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:41.472
product management for design to go in and
actually have something nice to look at.

25
00:01:41.472 --> 00:01:46.443
What I'm gonna recommend is that you
actually go over to the course notes and

26
00:01:46.443 --> 00:01:50.715
under the add-ons story here
using add-ons, I have this file,

27
00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:52.980
I have this big block of text here.

28
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.815
This is marked down and this is gonna
be like our fake documentation for

29
00:01:56.815 --> 00:02:00.845
our components, so what I would say
is let's copy this, it's a lot, but

30
00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:03.841
we'll see it rendering and
I'll walk you through it.

31
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:07.606
So inside of components,
create a new file,

32
00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:11.875
I'm gonna call it buttons.stories.js,
okay?

33
00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.776
I'm just gonna copy and
paste all this stuff in and

34
00:02:17.776 --> 00:02:20.535
then we'll walk through
it in just a second.

35
00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:30.905
Okay, so we've imported add-on docs, and
you'll see what all of these packages

36
00:02:30.905 --> 00:02:36.049
are doing in just a second, and
we've also imported our button components.

37
00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.527
So at the top here, we've got some
metadata, what's the title of the story,

38
00:02:39.527 --> 00:02:41.863
and what component is this
going to be documenting.

39
00:02:41.863 --> 00:02:46.516
And actually, this should be the MDX,

40
00:02:46.516 --> 00:02:51.310
we're gonna be using MDX which is a way to

41
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.822
write mark down with your JSX, okay?

42
00:02:55.822 --> 00:02:59.877
And so what we need to do now that
we have our documentation added,

43
00:02:59.877 --> 00:03:03.562
I wanna tell stories but,
hey this file could be a js file but

44
00:03:03.562 --> 00:03:08.250
also it could be an mdx file, so
we're gonna add that or operator in there.

45
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.324
Select by stories ending in js or
mdx and let's render those, and

46
00:03:13.324 --> 00:03:19.610
this extension, this file extension
will be MDX, so buttons.stories.mdx.

47
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.180
So now we can actually use markdown to
create documentation for our components.

48
00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:31.973
Every time you add an on on, you're
gonna have to restart your dev server,

49
00:03:31.973 --> 00:03:35.344
it's very unfortunately, especially given
that my computer is very slow today.

50
00:03:35.344 --> 00:03:39.296
Okay, so once you have
npm-installed this addon-docs,

51
00:03:39.296 --> 00:03:44.680
we actually need to go and add it to our
main.js file inside of this addons array.

52
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.512
So this one's special,
we wanna give it an option and

53
00:03:48.512 --> 00:03:53.371
this options configureJSX: true,
just telling it basically that

54
00:03:53.371 --> 00:03:57.390
hey if we have JSX go ahead and
actually recognize that.

55
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.259
So we add our addon-docs
to the addons array, and

56
00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:02.182
then this is just some mark down.

57
00:04:02.182 --> 00:04:05.973
So this is gonna render our mark down
files into nice documentation you

58
00:04:05.973 --> 00:04:10.343
can deploy and use with any stakeholder,
they don't have to just be developer,

59
00:04:10.343 --> 00:04:13.119
they can be designer they
could be product, okay?

60
00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:17.648
And when you run NPM run storybook,
if everything works as expected,

61
00:04:17.648 --> 00:04:19.275
you should now see this.

62
00:04:19.275 --> 00:04:23.384
So taking a look at this real quick,
on our dock site, we have a header just as

63
00:04:23.384 --> 00:04:27.127
here's what buttons are used for,
this is where you would use them.

64
00:04:27.127 --> 00:04:31.050
And then we look down here and
we have this preview element,

65
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.665
preview is coming from our
add-on that we just added.

66
00:04:34.665 --> 00:04:37.823
So it comes from add-on docs,
and then we create a story,

67
00:04:37.823 --> 00:04:41.186
I'm giving this name of primary,
it's our primary button.

68
00:04:41.186 --> 00:04:45.176
You can see here the other store names
are gonna be secondary and tertiary.

69
00:04:45.176 --> 00:04:48.681
These names correspond to
the tabs on the side, so

70
00:04:48.681 --> 00:04:51.940
whatever I change this
to it'll update here.

71
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.558
And, for whatever reason,

72
00:04:55.558 --> 00:05:01.487
let me see, You should have
this secondary tab appear docs,

73
00:05:01.487 --> 00:05:04.919
this is what our add on just added for
us is this document tab, right?

74
00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.393
So we can pair the side by side,
we have our title here, so buttons,

75
00:05:09.393 --> 00:05:13.490
here's the text underneath that,
our usage and all of that.

76
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.011
You can even I like props table as
well for all your components, and

77
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:21.987
this actually,
you can see this is the code for it, okay?

78
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.008
So that was our first add-on docs,
now what you'll notice though,

79
00:05:28.008 --> 00:05:30.493
that our buttons are not actually
retaining any theme, right?

80
00:05:30.493 --> 00:05:36.299
We wanna be able to trigger that, so lets
go add another two plug-ins,two add-ons,

81
00:05:36.299 --> 00:05:40.448
that are gonna allow us to pass
our theme and simulate a theme.

82
00:05:40.448 --> 00:05:45.400
So, in your terminal were gonna
install two more add-ons,

83
00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:48.626
Let me clear this so
it's a little easier to read.

84
00:05:48.626 --> 00:05:56.760
So nom install and those are gonna
be @storybook/addon-backgrounds.

85
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.551
It's gonna allow us to change
the background of our storybook,

86
00:06:02.551 --> 00:06:08.246
and @storybook/addon-contexts,
just like that, okay?

87
00:06:08.246 --> 00:06:15.528
And anytime we add an addon we have to add
it to the addon array inside of main.js,

88
00:06:15.528 --> 00:06:22.445
so while that is installing,
Let's go ahead an add it here,

89
00:06:22.445 --> 00:06:27.014
I probably typed that
wrong addon backgrounds,

90
00:06:27.014 --> 00:06:32.928
that's cuz backgrounds has an S,
seems to be the theme today.

91
00:06:32.928 --> 00:06:38.032
Let's try that again, in the meantime,
I'm gonna go add these,

92
00:06:38.032 --> 00:06:43.885
so @storybook addon-contexts,
this needs to have a register at the end.

93
00:06:43.885 --> 00:06:47.667
So slash register we have to tell story
about that we need to use this, okay?

94
00:06:47.667 --> 00:06:51.056
It's gonna be the same for
background so I'm just gonna copy and

95
00:06:51.056 --> 00:06:55.666
paste that, this is just gonna be changed
to backgrounds, so register both of those.

96
00:07:00.374 --> 00:07:03.285
Now, we actually need to create our
context, so we've told story, but

97
00:07:03.285 --> 00:07:05.811
we want to add this plug in,
let's tell it what we want it to do,

98
00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:09.152
you can use this for language if you wanna
change the language of your application,

99
00:07:09.152 --> 00:07:10.427
we're gonna use it for theme.

100
00:07:10.427 --> 00:07:14.942
So let's create a new file
called context.js, and

101
00:07:14.942 --> 00:07:18.431
we're gonna import a couple of things,

102
00:07:18.431 --> 00:07:23.775
first is { ThemeProvider }
from 'styled-components'.

103
00:07:23.775 --> 00:07:28.559
The second is our themes we need
to actually pass our theme so

104
00:07:28.559 --> 00:07:33.547
import, defaultTheme and
darkTheme from our utils folder.

105
00:07:33.547 --> 00:07:39.528
And then we're just gonna export
an array of different like properties,

106
00:07:39.528 --> 00:07:42.718
and it's gonna be an array of objects.

107
00:07:42.718 --> 00:07:47.849
So each object has a different
configuration, so export const context

108
00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:53.235
= { } array so you can have multiple
contexts we're just gonna have one,

109
00:07:53.235 --> 00:07:58.779
it's gonna be an object We
can set icon this one's gonna

110
00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:04.125
be shown in the toolbar, don't need to set
that it's really not useful right now.

111
00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:07.355
For title we wanna give it
themes as our color theme, for

112
00:08:07.355 --> 00:08:12.185
components, we're gonna be using theme
provider that's gonna go into an array.

113
00:08:12.185 --> 00:08:16.808
And now we need to give it
some parameters, so params,

114
00:08:16.808 --> 00:08:22.046
what do we need this theme provider
to kind of switch between.

115
00:08:22.046 --> 00:08:27.600
So the first we're gonna call default
theme, that's the name of it that'll

116
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.910
show up in the toolbar, and the property,
ThemeProvider needs a theme.

117
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:37.092
So this will be our defaultTheme,
and optionally,

118
00:08:37.092 --> 00:08:41.188
we can pass just one more
argument default: true.

119
00:08:41.188 --> 00:08:45.119
So this will be what it's
originally set to, And

120
00:08:45.119 --> 00:08:49.914
we're gonna do the same for dark theme so
this would be dark theme the props this

121
00:08:49.914 --> 00:08:52.980
will set the theme to dark theme,
and that's it.

122
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:58.358
So those are our parameters,
I think I messed up a bracket,

123
00:09:02.493 --> 00:09:04.358
Where did I mess it up?

124
00:09:04.358 --> 00:09:12.931
Okay, I have a couple too many,
Theme: defaultTheme.

125
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:15.109
&gt;&gt; Left of default.

126
00:09:15.109 --> 00:09:16.375
&gt;&gt; Left of default here?

127
00:09:16.375 --> 00:09:24.813
Wait, Yeah,
yeah you're totally right thank you.

128
00:09:24.813 --> 00:09:28.292
That should not be closed there,
there we go,

129
00:09:28.292 --> 00:09:33.660
when it auto like pretties you're like,
yeah, I'm good, awesome.

130
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:39.156
We're just gonna set like
two more options down here,

131
00:09:39.156 --> 00:09:42.978
so right after the params array here,

132
00:09:42.978 --> 00:09:47.054
add one more object, just the options.

133
00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:49.323
So deep true, this is gonna say hey,

134
00:09:49.323 --> 00:09:53.938
we need to pass this property all the way
through every child component, so

135
00:09:53.938 --> 00:09:57.622
pass our theme all the way
through every single component.

136
00:09:57.622 --> 00:10:01.950
Disable, we don't want
this to be disableable,

137
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.183
that's the word today and
cancelable: False.

138
00:10:09.397 --> 00:10:10.791
So this is not gonna be optional, so

139
00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:13.171
someone brought up a really good
point that I made a mistake.

140
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:17.709
I actually forgot to wrap my dark theme
within context.js in curly brackets, so

141
00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:19.655
make sure that those are wrapped.

142
00:10:19.655 --> 00:10:25.155
And inside of preview.js,
make sure your backgrounds has an s,

143
00:10:25.155 --> 00:10:30.965
cuz I did just make that mistake and
it didn't actually work, okay?

144
00:10:30.965 --> 00:10:36.089
So now we have our context, and
we can actually pass this, So

145
00:10:36.089 --> 00:10:38.949
we need to make one more file in our
storybook folder to get this to work,

146
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:40.436
it's gonna be called preview.js.

147
00:10:42.965 --> 00:10:46.832
And this is where we're gonna configure
all of our like decorators, so

148
00:10:46.832 --> 00:10:49.613
a decorator is gonna be what
we use with our addons.

149
00:10:49.613 --> 00:10:57.114
So let's say we're gonna import
[addParameters] from 'storybook/react',

150
00:10:57.114 --> 00:11:02.934
this will all make sense in a second
once we get these parameters.

151
00:11:02.934 --> 00:11:07.896
Add decorator,
that's coming from the same place,

152
00:11:07.896 --> 00:11:14.450
I'm gonna combine those,
Import with contexts,

153
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.180
so we need to actually pass
our context to our decorator.

154
00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:23.100
This is coming from
'@storybook/addon-contexts/react'; cuz

155
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.150
this is a react application.

156
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:30.553
And let's just import that context we just

157
00:11:30.553 --> 00:11:35.966
made { contexts } from 'contexts';.

158
00:11:35.966 --> 00:11:39.942
Cool, so the first parameter we
wanna add is our background, so

159
00:11:39.942 --> 00:11:44.583
let's do addParameters {( so what do
we want to set a dark background when

160
00:11:44.583 --> 00:11:48.045
we have our default theme so
we can see our components and

161
00:11:48.045 --> 00:11:52.488
we wanna set a light background when
we have our dark theme components.

162
00:11:52.488 --> 00:11:58.600
So, backgrounds: [ it's gonna be an array,
so {}name:'Default theme',

163
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:03.924
is going to have a value: '#ffffff'
of white, so when our components

164
00:12:03.924 --> 00:12:09.195
are dark colored, we want that on
a white background so we can see them.

165
00:12:09.195 --> 00:12:12.624
And this is gonna be the default value,
so we'll set default again to true},.

166
00:12:12.624 --> 00:12:17.772
And the other is just gonna be the 'Dark
theme', so when our components are in

167
00:12:17.772 --> 00:12:22.850
their dark theme, let's set
the background to a Dark Blue #050449.

168
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:27.950
And the only other thing
that we need to do

169
00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:33.050
to get this to work is
just add a decorator

170
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:37.850
We want to actually use our theme now.

171
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:41.513
So with contexts and
pass it the context we just made,

172
00:12:46.524 --> 00:12:47.604
So whenever you add an addon,

173
00:12:47.604 --> 00:12:50.036
you're going to actually have to
restart your storybook server.

174
00:12:50.036 --> 00:12:52.836
So make sure you stop and
restart it, and when you do,

175
00:12:52.836 --> 00:12:56.633
you should have these two up here,
these two little icons are very tiny,

176
00:12:56.633 --> 00:12:59.200
the first one on the left
is going to be our theme.

177
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.328
So if we change to a dark theme
our components disappear and

178
00:13:03.328 --> 00:13:05.192
they have our dark theme.

179
00:13:05.192 --> 00:13:09.171
Obviously we can't see them that's why we
also need to change our background, so

180
00:13:09.171 --> 00:13:09.812
there we go.

181
00:13:09.812 --> 00:13:14.096
Now we actually can see our
components dark theme, and

182
00:13:14.096 --> 00:13:17.461
you can do this for
any theme that you have.
