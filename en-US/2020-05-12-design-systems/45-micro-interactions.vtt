00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.530
Okay, so we're gonna jump into
the fun part of this course now,

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.590
we're gonna animate some stuff.

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.182
Let's talk about micro-interactions.

4
00:00:06.182 --> 00:00:09.740
So micro-interactions are small
animations whose purpose is

5
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.800
to really delight the users and
provide feedback for things.

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.670
So some of the benefits
of this aren't above and

7
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.270
beyond just delighting our users,
they can have a lot of positive impacts.

8
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.620
So we can actually alter our user
sense of perceived performance.

9
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.690
So users are actually willing
to wait a longer time if they

10
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.580
think something is going on.

11
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.550
And this is where perceived
performance can really

12
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.860
be benefited by incorporating animations.

13
00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:40.251
Micro-interactions can also update
users about the status of a task, so

14
00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:44.028
if you're doing a transaction, like you
see here, it can inform users that hey,

15
00:00:44.028 --> 00:00:46.304
it's successful, or hey, it's processing.

16
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.216
These animations can be used to indicate
state change, so if they're typing in

17
00:00:52.216 --> 00:00:55.250
a form, and there's something wrong or
if the form is not correct,

18
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.041
we can use those animations to
indicate those state changes.

19
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.768
We can use micro-interactions
to draw attention, so

20
00:01:02.768 --> 00:01:05.447
this is like the typing indicator
on an iPhone or in Slack.

21
00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:12.889
A lot of social media applications will
use these interactions to create habits,

22
00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:15.607
so when we click like,
that cute little interaction

23
00:01:15.607 --> 00:01:18.850
that actually subconsciously
will cause you to form a habit.

24
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.289
But also sometimes they can just turn
really boring tasks that you have to do,

25
00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.929
like signing up for an account or
filling out a form, make them fun.

26
00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:37.400
Just a couple of tips when you use
animations in your component library.

27
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.530
First of all, obviously,
they have to be accessible.

28
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.737
So make sure that anything that you
are doing is able to be read by

29
00:01:42.737 --> 00:01:43.653
a screen reader.

30
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.639
Also be intentional, like don't draw
animations on absolutely everything,

31
00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:51.855
I know it's fun but be really intentional.

32
00:01:51.855 --> 00:01:55.677
Animations draw the user's focus and so it
should only be used in the most prominent

33
00:01:55.677 --> 00:01:57.873
parts of your application or
your components.

34
00:02:00.298 --> 00:02:03.791
Also something that we typically
struggle with, with CSS animations,

35
00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:07.150
as making them feel like
they're part of the real world.

36
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.710
When we're creating CSS animations
are typically very linear,

37
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.380
even with cubic Bezier functions,
they can feel a little bit mechanical.

38
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.020
So React Spring is nice, so we'll see in
a minute, it's a physics based library.

39
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.499
So try to incorporate different elements
of the real world to animate your items.

40
00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:27.373
And never make your users wait for
an animation,

41
00:02:27.373 --> 00:02:30.149
like if you are showing
a loading indicator and

42
00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:34.581
you think it's really snazzy,
if their data is loaded, show it to them.

43
00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:36.605
There's nothing worse than
going to like a webpage and

44
00:02:36.605 --> 00:02:38.497
you see like this loading
progress indicator, and

45
00:02:38.497 --> 00:02:42.280
you know the webpages loaded, they just
wanted to show you their fancy animation.

46
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.286
So please don't do that.

47
00:02:43.286 --> 00:02:44.026
