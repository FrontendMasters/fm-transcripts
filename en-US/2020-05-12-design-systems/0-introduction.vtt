00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.830
Thank you all for being here today.

2
00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.649
It really means a lot that people took
time out of their lives to come see

3
00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:07.460
my talk, which is really exciting.

4
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.450
So I'm Emma Bostian.

5
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm a software engineer at LogMeIn.

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.360
I am from Upstate New York
originally born and raised there.

7
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.710
After I graduated from Santa College in
Albany, I moved down to Austin, Texas for

8
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.290
three years when I worked
at IBM on a design team for

9
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.690
the quantum computing site,

10
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.490
which was super fun, and that was kind of
like my first intro to design systems.

11
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.070
But at LogMeIn I actually I work on
building design systems as well.

12
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.880
And so this is something I'm really
excited to be sharing with you today.

13
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.850
I do a lot of miscellanous things in my
spare time, like podcasting, blogging,

14
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.860
all the things that everyone
is getting into right now.

15
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.790
So I am really looking forward to this.

16
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.120
It's a little bit of an experiment,

17
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.680
because we're gonna be building a system
together, but everyone's is gonna look

18
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.550
a little bit different by the end of this,
which is gonna be really neat to see and

19
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.120
I hope that you all will share it in the
chat maybe after this workshop is done.

20
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.930
So we're gonna start out learning about
design systems like what they are,

21
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.320
why they're important and
how to build them.

22
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.309
Then I'm gonna teach you
some design foundations and

23
00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.442
I think as engineers this is
really hard to learn design.

24
00:01:06.442 --> 00:01:09.450
I'm not an expert,
I am an engineer by nature.

25
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.640
But I think going over some color theory
and typography will be super fun.

26
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.060
Once we get that foundational knowledge
we're gonna switch into Figma

27
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.800
which is designed tool.

28
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.978
We're actually gonna design
components together.

29
00:01:20.978 --> 00:01:23.702
We're gonna turn them
into coded components.

30
00:01:23.702 --> 00:01:26.870
We're gonna animate those components and
then we'll document them and

31
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.440
publish that on natla phi.

32
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.770
And then we'll just wrap up by
talking about some fun people and

33
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.510
tools in the industry that you can
reference for more information.

34
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.990
I do talk quickly.

35
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.001
So if I'm too fast, just raise your
hand and I will try to slow down.

36
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:43.824
And if you have any questions,
I'm gonna try to pause and thereafter,

37
00:01:43.824 --> 00:01:46.190
some of those sections and take questions.

38
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.700
But if anything is unclear,
just stop me and we'll address it.

39
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.650
So today we're gonna talk
high-level design systems.

40
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.550
This is a new field and it hasn't really
been standardized in the industry yet.

41
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.130
So this is my take on how I
would build a design system but

42
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.810
it's not gonna go into the nitty gritty.

43
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.672
So, we're not gonna talk about how to
actually deploy like a build process

44
00:02:09.672 --> 00:02:13.841
because a lot of companies have different
standards, different procedures and

45
00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:17.415
it wouldn't make a ton of sense for
me to discuss those intricacies.

46
00:02:17.415 --> 00:02:22.342
But we will talk about how to actually
build components and design components and

47
00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.147
all of that.

48
00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:28.125
Just a couple of housekeeping things,
so I have a repository on GitHub,

49
00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:29.830
I just made this public.

50
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.846
Let me bring that up here.

51
00:02:30.846 --> 00:02:39.110
You can go find it at
emmabostian/fem-design-systems.

52
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.080
It is public now.

53
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.690
My reading is very complete and
there are links to the documentation.

54
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.530
So I put together this website
which matches my slides because I'm

55
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.300
super extra in how to do that.

56
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.950
And these are also my speaker notes.

57
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.560
So this is what I'm
gonna be looking at and

58
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.190
reading through, and if you ever
get lost feel free to just jump in.

59
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.980
I also have branches I've
created on GitHub at the end of

60
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.940
each of these big sections
that you can jump to.

61
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.980
But we will be referencing this from
time to time just to grab some larger

62
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.570
code snippets.

63
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.164
So I would just recommend
keeping this open.

64
00:03:11.164 --> 00:03:12.525
Okay.

65
00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:19.391
So, Let's talk about design systems.

66
00:03:22.062 --> 00:03:26.389
So the internet was not originally
intended to host large scale social and

67
00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.410
enterprise applications.

68
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.270
It was really created as a way
to share data across the world.

69
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.860
And a lot of the terminology
that we've used and

70
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.520
we've coined throughout time
as it's written printed books.

71
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.170
So if we think about pagination,
bookmarking,

72
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.200
web pages, these all have
references to printed media.

73
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.890
But we don't develop web pages
as like full web pages anymore.

74
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.400
And when we think about building
our sites in terms of pages,

75
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.230
we kind of subconsciously throw
reusability out the window.

76
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.920
So, instead of thinking in terms of pages,

77
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.100
we should start thinking
in terms of components.

78
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.620
We're seeing a lot of popular JavaScript
frameworks in libraries are a do-this,

79
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.580
even native web components.

80
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.660
So we really need to shift our
mindset to think of things modularly.

81
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.830
So a design system is really going
to allow us to create this modular

82
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:14.400
experience.
