00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.230
Before we jump in,
I just wanna preface this with the fact

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.400
that we're gonna be
using create-react-app.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.220
Under normal circumstances,
if you're building a design system,

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.250
you would not use create-react-app.

5
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.370
You would want to have a different kind
of pipeline a different environment.

6
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.322
Maybe you wanna use a monorepo,
if you have different packages for

7
00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:17.810
different types of components.

8
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.510
Maybe you have react,

9
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.870
we have Angular, a monorepo like
learner would allow you to do that.

10
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.210
We're not gonna be setting that
up today,for several reasons,

11
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.380
I'm not an expert in monorepos.

12
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.073
Secondly, it might not
be the best solution.

13
00:00:30.073 --> 00:00:33.648
There was a library called create-react
library which is really cool,

14
00:00:33.648 --> 00:00:36.465
it's linked in the website,
and it was really great.

15
00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:40.527
But I could not get it to work very well
with style components, and it's great for

16
00:00:40.527 --> 00:00:44.373
actually deploying your components to npm,
it worked super well with npm.

17
00:00:44.373 --> 00:00:48.352
But I wanted to use CSS in JS, and
I didn't wanna run into errors.

18
00:00:48.352 --> 00:00:51.190
So, because I wanna focus on how
we build styled components, and

19
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.700
the styling in storybook,
we're going to use create react app.

20
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.428
But you would not use that in production.

21
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.665
Okay, let's do it.

22
00:00:59.665 --> 00:01:04.180
So, you can open your terminal, I'm
going to save my project to my desktop,

23
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.067
I just find it to be the easiest.

24
00:01:06.067 --> 00:01:11.938
And I'm gonna use npx to
create this react application,

25
00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:17.332
npx comes with npm version 5.2.0 and
greater.

26
00:01:17.332 --> 00:01:21.052
It's a great tool that allows you to
use different versions of packages,

27
00:01:21.052 --> 00:01:22.621
to create your applications.

28
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:26.433
So previously, like you would run,
create-react- app and

29
00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:30.260
then your app name,
with npx you do npx create-react-app.

30
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.522
And so you don't need to have
create-react-app globally installed,

31
00:01:33.522 --> 00:01:35.990
that's another important
thing nps lets you do that.

32
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.042
So if you have npm greater than 5.2,
you can use this command and if you don't,

33
00:01:40.042 --> 00:01:41.230
that's totally fine.

34
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.264
Just use the current react app CLI tool.

35
00:01:44.264 --> 00:01:48.150
Does everyone have create react up
enabled, like you're able to use it?

36
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.070
Okay, so we're gonna create react app,
I'm going to call it my component library.

37
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.650
And I'm going to chain two commands
together using this ampersand.

38
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.340
You could run this and then the second
command cd into it, change directories and

39
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.100
I'm just gonna do cd, create react, or my
component library, my component library.

40
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.440
So this is going to create this
new component library, and

41
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.310
that's gonna change directory so
we are in there.

42
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.340
It might take a second, but while it does,
I wanna show you a really cool tool.

43
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.027
Let me go to the notes here,
this tool is a CLI tool for

44
00:02:24.027 --> 00:02:30.044
VS code if you are using VS code,
it's going to allow you to,

45
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.070
Actually run like a code command to
open your current directory in VS code.

46
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.901
So, you can grab that here, it's again, on
the website, it's the CLI interface tool.

47
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:46.273
So what this is gonna allow me to do once
I'm actually in this directory in my

48
00:02:46.273 --> 00:02:47.662
terminal, I can run code dot,

49
00:02:47.662 --> 00:02:51.320
meaning the current directory, saying
open that current directory in VS code.

50
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.246
So I'm gonna be doing
that in just a moment.

51
00:02:53.246 --> 00:02:55.777
But if you want to go download it,
this is where you can find it.

52
00:02:57.881 --> 00:03:02.109
I'll also show you my editor settings just
in case I have a couple of things that

53
00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.520
you're curious where I got them,
while it's still loading.

54
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.510
So, in terms of font, a really fun font
that has ligatures, what I use is, I think

55
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.740
it's called Dank Mono, Dank Mono, this is
the font I'm using in case you're curious.

56
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.650
I think it's paid,
I think it's about 40 British pounds.

57
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.280
But it's really, really nice,
if you don't wanna pay for it,

58
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.450
what was the other one
is just gonna mention?

59
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.230
Fira Code, Fira Code is free, looks very,
very similar and you can download this for

60
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.080
free use, it's for free experiment, it
looks very similar I just repeated myself.

61
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.500
So those are my two fonts
that I would choose from.

62
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.711
Another fun thing that you can
do is these material icons,

63
00:03:42.711 --> 00:03:45.800
I just like to share this
with you since we're waiting.

64
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.178
So this allows you,
if you have a project and you drag it in,

65
00:03:51.178 --> 00:03:54.470
when we create ours, you'll see mine.

66
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.088
It'll actually use the material
design icons on the side for

67
00:03:57.088 --> 00:03:59.357
all the different files and
it looks really pretty.

68
00:03:59.357 --> 00:04:03.530
So that's another plugin that I really,
really like.

69
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.348
Can you define styled components?

70
00:04:05.348 --> 00:04:09.810
Yeah, so
styled components is a CSS in JS library,

71
00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:18.290
It is, to your Google app,
styled components dot com.

72
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.723
This is what it looks like.

73
00:04:20.723 --> 00:04:26.883
In contrast emotion, like I mentioned
emotion is another CSS in JS library.

74
00:04:26.883 --> 00:04:33.030
They're very similar, they have
very similar foundational elements.

75
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.020
And so the whole concept here,
is we're gonna create JavaScript files.

76
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.650
And we're going to actually apply CSS
directly onto these HTML elements.

77
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.660
And once you do that, you can just render
them like normal, like normal elements.

78
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.513
So that's what a styled component is,
it's a library for

79
00:04:51.513 --> 00:04:53.647
creating CSS in JS components.

80
00:04:53.647 --> 00:04:55.605
We are now inside of my
component library directory.

81
00:04:55.605 --> 00:04:58.388
So I'm gonna, like I mentioned before,
I'm gonna run that code command.

82
00:04:58.388 --> 00:05:00.390
It's gonna open my current
directory in VS code.

83
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.794
You can get at the link to that again,
on the website.

84
00:05:04.794 --> 00:05:06.936
Okay, so,
the first thing that we're gonna do,

85
00:05:06.936 --> 00:05:10.310
is delete everything inside the source
folder, this is a lot of boilerplate.

86
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.148
So I'm just going to select all of this,
my holding Shift, and delete.

87
00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.371
Okay?

88
00:05:16.371 --> 00:05:21.541
From now on, I'm going to use this
integrated terminal in VS code,

89
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:25.454
and you can open that by
pressing Cotrol backtick.

90
00:05:25.454 --> 00:05:29.230
And let's go ahead, well let's not start
our dev-server yet, cuz it's gonna break.

91
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.226
So inside of source create a new folder,
new file, I'm sorry, a new file,

92
00:05:34.226 --> 00:05:36.033
called index.js, okay?

93
00:05:36.033 --> 00:05:39.858
Import react from react, and

94
00:05:39.858 --> 00:05:45.680
then importReactDoM from ReactDom, okay.

95
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.322
Let's just instantiate a simple stateless
functional component that just returns

96
00:05:50.322 --> 00:05:51.900
a div saying Hello, World.

97
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.535
So, const, what did I call you?

98
00:05:54.535 --> 00:06:00.111
App, And we'll just do,
we'll do an h1 we'll be semantic.

99
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:05.047
And we'll say, hello world, okay?

100
00:06:05.047 --> 00:06:10.118
Let's render it, so
ReactDom.render will render our app,

101
00:06:10.118 --> 00:06:14.880
and we will use document
querySelector to grab the root.

102
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.540
You can also just use get element per ID,
whatever you prefer.

103
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:25.970
So ,now, if I run npm start, it should
spin up our dev-server if it doesn't take

104
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.560
two weeks to start up, and it should show
us a header tab that says Hello, World.

105
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.653
I use a tool called Spectacle to snap my
windows if you're wondering how I'm doing

106
00:06:37.653 --> 00:06:38.699
that really easily.

107
00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:44.613
But there are much better tools that
are maintained that you can use as well.

108
00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:47.080
Okay, so we've got Hello,
World, that's exciting.

109
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.560
Let's actually go ahead,
let's install styled components.

110
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.378
I'm gonna create a new terminal window,
terminal window in VS code by

111
00:06:56.378 --> 00:07:00.884
pressing this plus, and
there are two ways that you can install.

112
00:07:00.884 --> 00:07:02.090
I'm gonna close my sidebar with Command B.

113
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.923
There are two ways you
can install this you,

114
00:07:05.923 --> 00:07:09.867
can write npm install styled-components.

115
00:07:09.867 --> 00:07:13.049
Or you can just simply write
npmi styled-components,

116
00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:15.222
it's kind of shorthand components.

117
00:07:15.222 --> 00:07:16.310
Components.

118
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.103
So I spell that right, yeah.

119
00:07:18.103 --> 00:07:22.517
So let's go ahead and install that And

120
00:07:22.517 --> 00:07:25.840
while that's installing, we can
actually go ahead and start using it.

121
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.330
So the first thing we wanna do,
let's create a new component folder.

122
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.056
So inside of source create a new
folder called components, and

123
00:07:33.056 --> 00:07:35.530
we're gonna add a buttons dot.js file.

124
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.983
Now a fun little trick if you wanna
just do both of those at the same time.

125
00:07:38.983 --> 00:07:43.743
If you hit New File, and
you type components slash buttons d.js,

126
00:07:43.743 --> 00:07:47.830
this is gonna create a folder and
put that file inside it.

127
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:48.882
So it's a fun little trick.

128
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.950
So, we've got our buttons.js file
inside of our components folder.

129
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.109
And let's actually,
let's create ourselves component.

130
00:07:58.109 --> 00:08:03.570
So the first thing we need to do is
import styled from styled components.

131
00:08:05.922 --> 00:08:06.888
Okay?

132
00:08:06.888 --> 00:08:08.826
Now let's just build out
a little simple primary button.

133
00:08:08.826 --> 00:08:13.630
So const primary button, the way styled
components work is you're gonna have

134
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:18.359
this word styled, it's gonna say hey,
styled components I want to style and

135
00:08:18.359 --> 00:08:20.820
you give it an HTML element.

136
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.646
So I want to create a button,
so style.button.

137
00:08:23.646 --> 00:08:27.935
You're gonna put two backticks like you
would if you were using template strings,

138
00:08:27.935 --> 00:08:30.521
and everything inside here
is going to be our CSS.

139
00:08:30.521 --> 00:08:33.027
You would just write it like
you would in a CSS file,

140
00:08:33.027 --> 00:08:35.711
sometimes if you're using
react like inline Styles,

141
00:08:35.711 --> 00:08:39.120
it's different shorthand like
you would right margin, right?

142
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.770
If you are doing some inline styling but
you can just write regular CSS so

143
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.640
you just use the hyphenated
slight margin right like that.

144
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.227
Okay?
So let's give it some properties,

145
00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:49.724
let's give it a background colour red.

146
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.201
Give it a border with none, no border.

147
00:08:57.158 --> 00:08:57.739
We'll give the color of white.

148
00:09:00.653 --> 00:09:04.790
We'll give it some pattern of 12 pixels,
24 pixels on the left and right.

149
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:09.487
And lastly,
let's just that font size 2 1 ram.

150
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.848
The last thing we just wanna
do here is just export,

151
00:09:17.848 --> 00:09:20.010
I'm gonna use a default export for
right now.

152
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.058
We will come back and refactor this.

153
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.799
So here's our default export.

154
00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:29.678
So as soon as this is done,
we can go and instantiate this and

155
00:09:29.678 --> 00:09:31.990
hopefully it works great, okay?

156
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.910
So just to reiterate,
you just have to write the words styled,

157
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.930
followed by the type of component
you want this to be styled upon.

158
00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.000
And you'll see when we actually go and
instantiate this button,

159
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.810
you would just use the regular tags
like you would for any HTML element.

160
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:45.990
It's just a styled component.

161
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.010
So let's head back over to our index
file in the root of our source folder.

162
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:56.476
And let's import primary button
from components buttons.

163
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.752
So because we're using the default export
here, we don't need those curly braces for

164
00:10:03.752 --> 00:10:06.752
those of you who are kind of
new to this whole process.

165
00:10:06.752 --> 00:10:09.987
A default export you don't need those
curly braces, but if we were exporting

166
00:10:09.987 --> 00:10:13.450
many different kinds of things from the
same file, you would need a named export.

167
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.470
So we'll see those differences
in just a little bit.

168
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.190
Okay, so
styled components is now installed.

169
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:24.020
And let's actually, let's change
this from an H1 to a primary button.

170
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.700
If you're wondering how I selected those,
if you highlight something in VS code and

171
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:28.720
you press Command D.

172
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.062
It will highlight every instance
of what you've highlighted.

173
00:10:32.062 --> 00:10:35.320
It's really great way to change the start
and tag or something very quickly.

174
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.360
So primary button.

175
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.139
Just like that.

176
00:10:40.012 --> 00:10:42.110
Now we can see our button
showing up on our UI.

177
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.315
So it's looks really nice.
