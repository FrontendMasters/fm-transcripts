WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.268
So let's take a look at the actual
sites that we're gonna use today.

2
00:00:03.268 --> 00:00:08.801
So we have a course site, that
frontendmasters.learnwithJason.dev/interm-

3
00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:13.426
ediate-gatsby, that is gonna contain
all of the lessons that we're

4
00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:14.872
gonna work on today.

5
00:00:14.872 --> 00:00:20.841
And then the source code for the project
we're gonna use today is on github at

6
00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:26.634
jlengstorf/frontend-masters-intermediate--
gatsby-project.

7
00:00:26.634 --> 00:00:30.413
We are gonna fork that repo so
that you can deploy it later on.

8
00:00:30.413 --> 00:00:34.527
So in fact, why don't we just
jump right into that, right?

9
00:00:34.527 --> 00:00:39.487
So the first thing that we're gonna
do is let's make sure that we have

10
00:00:39.487 --> 00:00:41.464
all the requisite pieces.

11
00:00:41.464 --> 00:00:44.887
So you're gonna need
a GitHub account today, so

12
00:00:44.887 --> 00:00:49.154
make sure that you are on GitHub and
that you have an account.

13
00:00:49.154 --> 00:00:52.080
We are also going to be
deploying to Netlify, so

14
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.249
if you don't have a Netlify account,
you can sign in, or sign up for

15
00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:00.954
one that you sign up with your GitHub
account, so it takes a couple seconds.

16
00:01:00.954 --> 00:01:07.772
We are going to be using the GitHub CLI,
which I absolutely love.

17
00:01:07.772 --> 00:01:13.989
Is a tool, it's made my life as
a maintainer so, so much easier.

18
00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:18.068
So instead of having to
remember all the Git commands,

19
00:01:18.068 --> 00:01:22.694
I can just do gh repo clone, and
then I get the repo that I want.

20
00:01:22.694 --> 00:01:27.554
I don't have to type out the github.com or
any of those, like get at GitHub things,

21
00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.342
none of that, it's all gone.

22
00:01:29.342 --> 00:01:31.727
It's really powerful,
we're gonna be using that.

23
00:01:31.727 --> 00:01:35.833
We're also gonna use the Netlify CLI,
and the Netlify CLI today

24
00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:40.016
is significantly more important
than it was on the Gatsby intro,

25
00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:43.379
because we're gonna use it for
local development.

26
00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:47.539
It gives us the ability to run our mono
repo to manage environment variables,

27
00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.907
it runs our serverless functions for
us, so

28
00:01:49.907 --> 00:01:53.947
there's a lot that it's doing that
just makes local development easier.

29
00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.099
So I'm gonna be relying on that.

30
00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:03.206
If you don't have that, you can install
it with npm install -g netlify-cli,

31
00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:08.840
and just get the @latest,
I'll go ahead and run it right now.

32
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.049
Danger zone to install something
fresh right before we start.

33
00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:19.866
So the version that we are gonna be
using today is, let's see, I've got,

34
00:02:21.668 --> 00:02:26.418
Netlify 6.3.4, GitHub version 1.2.1.

35
00:02:26.418 --> 00:02:31.971
We're using, or let's get the repo forked
and then we'll get everything else.

36
00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:36.867
Once you've got both of those,
you can do gh auth login, and

37
00:02:36.867 --> 00:02:41.871
it'll log you into the account
that you wanna be logged into.

38
00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:44.963
So I'm already logged in, so
I'm not gonna re-authenticate.

39
00:02:44.963 --> 00:02:48.009
And then Netlify the same thing,
ntl login, and

40
00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.543
it will say that I'm already logged in.

41
00:02:50.543 --> 00:02:54.554
So, in your case, it'll bounce you out,
you do the auth, and

42
00:02:54.554 --> 00:02:57.074
then you'll be ready to rock and roll.

43
00:02:57.074 --> 00:02:59.391
We're also gonna be using yarn today,

44
00:02:59.391 --> 00:03:03.478
so if you don't have yarn,
which you can check by typing which yarn.

45
00:03:03.478 --> 00:03:08.781
And I'm using the old version of yarn,
so don't worry about having yarn 2 or

46
00:03:08.781 --> 00:03:12.544
yarn 3 or anything,
you can use yarn 1, it's fine.

47
00:03:12.544 --> 00:03:16.713
That is gonna used for
running the mono repo, so

48
00:03:16.713 --> 00:03:21.508
yarn workspaces are a really
nice way to do mono repos,

49
00:03:21.508 --> 00:03:26.115
and I'll show you how it works,
it's really nice.

50
00:03:26.115 --> 00:03:30.985
Okay, so the first thing that we're gonna
do is I already have this clone but

51
00:03:30.985 --> 00:03:33.888
for everybody else create
a fork of the repo.

52
00:03:33.888 --> 00:03:38.311
So, gh repo fork, and
then you can just type

53
00:03:38.311 --> 00:03:45.741
jlengstorf/frontend-masters-intermediate--
gatsby-project.

54
00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:50.692
And by running this command,
you will create a fork of the repo on

55
00:03:50.692 --> 00:03:55.937
your own account, you're gonna
need that fork in order to deploy.

56
00:03:55.937 --> 00:04:01.417
So if you don't wanna fork, you can also
clone the repo, delete the .git folder,

57
00:04:01.417 --> 00:04:06.534
and then initialize your own version,
whatever you wanna do it's up to you.

58
00:04:06.534 --> 00:04:11.919
But if you wanna deploy later,
you are gonna need a GitHub repo or

59
00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:15.822
Bitbucket or
git lab that you can deploy from.

60
00:04:17.541 --> 00:04:20.865
But I already have it, so
let's take a look at what's in the folder.

61
00:04:20.865 --> 00:04:23.346
We have just some starter files here.

62
00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:28.117
So the first thing is we've got
a readme that's just bare-bones

63
00:04:28.117 --> 00:04:29.947
details about the repo.

64
00:04:29.947 --> 00:04:33.069
We have a Gatsby config,
if we look in this Gatsby config,

65
00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:35.120
there's actually nothing in it yet.

66
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.104
Package.json, we'll look
at that in a second.

67
00:04:37.104 --> 00:04:41.106
We've got some Json data, so authors and
books that's some data that we're gonna

68
00:04:41.106 --> 00:04:44.821
work with a little bit later on, but
I didn't want everybody to have to type it

69
00:04:44.821 --> 00:04:46.896
out, so
we just put that right in the repo.

70
00:04:46.896 --> 00:04:52.083
And then an index.js, so
let's take a look at what these look like.

71
00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:56.448
So our gatsby-config is
exporting an empty object,

72
00:04:56.448 --> 00:05:03.536
our package.json has the bare minimum
dependencies, gatsby react and react-dom.

73
00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:07.022
Those are what are required for
building a Gatsby site,

74
00:05:07.022 --> 00:05:09.631
these are the three that you have to have.

75
00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:13.459
I set up the scripts that we need,
so we've got the develop command,

76
00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:16.038
which is the one that
runs the Gatsby locally.

77
00:05:16.038 --> 00:05:19.035
Start as an alias for that build,
we'll build the site,

78
00:05:19.035 --> 00:05:22.419
it'll make it into an actual
static site that's publishable.

79
00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:28.051
Serve lets you take a look locally at
what the published site will look like,

80
00:05:28.051 --> 00:05:33.067
so it's a way to take a look at your
build site on your local machine,

81
00:05:33.067 --> 00:05:37.529
and, Clean will delete the cache and

82
00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:42.671
public folders and kind of set you
back to a freshly installed or

83
00:05:42.671 --> 00:05:47.441
freshly built state where
there's no cache or anything.

84
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:49.455
Try not to use this feature.

85
00:05:49.455 --> 00:05:52.173
The only time that it really
makes sense to use this feature

86
00:05:52.173 --> 00:05:55.070
is if you're getting behavior
that doesn't make any sense.

87
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.692
Or if you're working with the schema and
you're doing schema customizations, and

88
00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:01.612
you're noticing that why is it
giving me an error that files there.

89
00:06:01.612 --> 00:06:04.205
That's when it makes
sense to do Gatsby clean.

90
00:06:04.205 --> 00:06:08.101
Don't use it as your turn it off and
turn it on again.

91
00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:11.327
Most of the time Gatsby clean is
just gonna make your build slower.

92
00:06:11.327 --> 00:06:15.660
They do a lot of work to make the cache
resilient and to recover it, and

93
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.143
keeping that cache makes your local and
production builds much, much, much faster.

94
00:06:21.143 --> 00:06:24.122
So Gatsby clean is a last resort.

95
00:06:24.122 --> 00:06:28.324
All right,
then you can see an nvmrc here, so

96
00:06:28.324 --> 00:06:35.069
I'm going to just run nvm install,
and it's gonna pick up that nvmrc and

97
00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:40.502
it'll show that we're
using version 16.6.1 now.

98
00:06:40.502 --> 00:06:46.410
And with that, I think we're ready to go.
