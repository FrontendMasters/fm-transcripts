00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.549
Let's get in here and
actually build out a layout in our theme.

2
00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:08.378
So the way that I wanna do this theme is,
I wanna provide some color settings,

3
00:00:08.378 --> 00:00:12.115
and then we wanna add some global stuff,
like typography.

4
00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:15.430
And then we will style up our layout, so

5
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.457
have the ability to have a header,
footer in main content.

6
00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:25.128
And then we will add a shared nav
that'll sit up at the top of the site.

7
00:00:25.128 --> 00:00:29.264
And in that will have kind
of some some config as well.

8
00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:32.336
So let's start by defining some of
our styles that we're going to need.

9
00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:34.438
So we'll go into source styles and

10
00:00:34.438 --> 00:00:39.303
the first one that we're going to create
is going to be called variables.css.

11
00:00:39.303 --> 00:00:44.327
And so I'm going to use plain old css
variables because I like them very much.

12
00:00:44.327 --> 00:00:47.652
They don't require us to install
anything new and they work

13
00:00:47.652 --> 00:00:52.180
on in the browser without transpilation
or, or any kind of build step.

14
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.077
So it's easy to debug.

15
00:00:54.077 --> 00:00:59.100
And you can write these in your dev tools
without having to stress out over it.

16
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.899
I very much enjoy this general approach.

17
00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.992
Okay, so this is going to be the whole
site we're going to have a color for

18
00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:06.629
black color for white color for text.

19
00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:11.498
And as just a general design thing,
putting pure black and pure white together

20
00:01:11.498 --> 00:01:15.803
can be a little like I said, It just
makes your eyes kind of do a thing.

21
00:01:15.803 --> 00:01:20.469
So a dark gray as opposed to a black
is just a little bit softer.

22
00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:24.463
That's why we're using this
instead of pure dark black.

23
00:01:24.463 --> 00:01:26.778
And then for text,
want it to be a little bit lighter so

24
00:01:26.778 --> 00:01:29.100
that the heading stand out and
those sorts of things.

25
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.282
And this is all that's going in this file.

26
00:01:32.282 --> 00:01:35.524
And you might be thinking like,
well, that's silly.

27
00:01:35.524 --> 00:01:37.391
Why would you create an extra file for
this?

28
00:01:37.391 --> 00:01:40.140
And I'll tell you why
a little bit later on.

29
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.430
Because there's a there's a very specific
reason that we're doing it this way.

30
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.377
So we set up our variables.

31
00:01:46.377 --> 00:01:48.484
Now we're going to set
up our global styles.

32
00:01:48.484 --> 00:01:50.683
And for our global styles,
we're going to keep these pretty simple.

33
00:01:50.683 --> 00:01:54.389
We are going to make sure that
margin padding do what we want.

34
00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:56.877
So we'll say box sizing is
going to be border box.

35
00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:03.007
And then we're going to set
up on the HTML and the body.

36
00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:08.139
We want to set our color to be,
the text color that we created,

37
00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.020
we're going to set a font family.

38
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.494
And I'm gonna use to have like,

39
00:02:14.494 --> 00:02:18.875
Apple system does it do the whole thing?

40
00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:20.470
That's close enough for use.

41
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.164
So those are system fonts.

42
00:02:22.164 --> 00:02:27.890
Got font size will set to 18 pixels,
line height of 1.4.

43
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.618
That's just a personal preference.

44
00:02:29.618 --> 00:02:31.270
You can ignore that if you want.

45
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.921
And then I'm going to set
a general margin of 0,

46
00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:39.020
because otherwise the document will have
a little bit of a white border around it.

47
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.243
So these will be our global styles.

48
00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:41.557
So again,
we're not doing much here, right?

49
00:02:41.557 --> 00:02:45.361
We're trying to create some some
baselines for things to look okay.

50
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:47.957
So we've got our global styles, and

51
00:02:47.957 --> 00:02:51.908
then we're going to add
a scopes module for our layout.

52
00:02:51.908 --> 00:02:55.674
So we'll call this one layout.module.css.

53
00:02:55.674 --> 00:02:59.642
And inside we're gonna say content.

54
00:02:59.642 --> 00:03:01.463
And we'll say margin.

55
00:03:01.463 --> 00:03:06.420
So we'll give our content a good top and
bottom margin about 3 rem and

56
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.143
then we'll center it.

57
00:03:08.143 --> 00:03:13.238
And I'm going to set the max
width to be 54 characters,

58
00:03:13.238 --> 00:03:15.905
this is good for line length.

59
00:03:15.905 --> 00:03:18.896
It means that no matter
what size the font is,

60
00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:22.223
the lines will be roughly
a good readable length.

61
00:03:22.223 --> 00:03:24.738
And then let's tell our footer.

62
00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:27.188
So for our footer,
we're gonna keep it really simple.

63
00:03:27.188 --> 00:03:29.657
You could do a lot of cool
stuff with the footer, but

64
00:03:29.657 --> 00:03:33.103
I just want to have one present and
I don't want to spend a lot of time on,

65
00:03:33.103 --> 00:03:35.190
like building out the markup for a footer.

66
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.037
So we will instead just set up the basics
of what a footer could look like.

67
00:03:41.037 --> 00:03:43.245
So we're going to text align center.

68
00:03:43.245 --> 00:03:46.022
And so this is just going to be small
text centered in the screen with a little

69
00:03:46.022 --> 00:03:47.270
bit of breathing room around it.

70
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.015
And that'll be our entire layout.

71
00:03:49.015 --> 00:03:52.991
So we're going to keep this very,
very straightforward as simple as we can.

72
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:57.597
Now that we've got that,
let's add a component and

73
00:03:57.597 --> 00:04:00.640
we'll call this one layout.js.

74
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.327
So in layout.js it's going
to be a React component, so

75
00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:07.470
we will import everything
as React from React.

76
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.527
We will also import those Styles.

77
00:04:11.527 --> 00:04:14.199
So we're going to start
with the variables.

78
00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:18.958
Then we're gonna get the global stuff, and

79
00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:25.130
then we're gonna import those
classes that we created,

80
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.159
so content and
footer from our layout module.

81
00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:36.117
Okay, then we can export
default function layout.

82
00:04:36.117 --> 00:04:40.661
And because it's a layout, we're gonna
allow it to have children that means it'll

83
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:43.733
wrap, a document and
whatever gets passed inside of this

84
00:04:43.733 --> 00:04:47.591
component will be delivered in the,
wherever we use children in here.

85
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:49.179
So I'm going to return,.

86
00:04:52.023 --> 00:04:55.626
Let's do a fragment and
I'm going to add main,

87
00:04:55.626 --> 00:05:00.596
with a class name of content and
we'll put the children in there.

88
00:05:00.596 --> 00:05:07.342
And then we'll add a footer
with a class name of footer.

89
00:05:07.342 --> 00:05:10.347
And this will just say,

90
00:05:10.347 --> 00:05:15.468
built with the shared Nav Gatsby theme.

91
00:05:15.468 --> 00:05:17.320
Right, so so
we're not doing too much with this.

92
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.672
We're gonna keep this pretty simple.

93
00:05:18.672 --> 00:05:22.767
Close our fragment and
we now have a working layout component.

94
00:05:22.767 --> 00:05:30.200
So we could, at this point, import this
component from the theme and use it.

95
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.735
But we're going to consider this
to be an opinionated theme.

96
00:05:32.735 --> 00:05:37.082
So what we want this theme to do is
actually automatically wrap every page in

97
00:05:37.082 --> 00:05:38.464
a site with the layout.

98
00:05:38.464 --> 00:05:42.143
So let's add a plugin that's
going to let us do that.

99
00:05:42.143 --> 00:05:46.258
And the way that we're going
to do that is yarn workspace.

100
00:05:46.258 --> 00:05:52.598
Gatsby theme shared nav add and
we want Gatsby plugin layout.

101
00:05:52.598 --> 00:05:56.855
So this is actually mimicking a behavior
that used to exist in Gatsby one.

102
00:05:56.855 --> 00:06:00.986
So you may have seen this before, where
it would automatically apply layouts.

103
00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:06.009
It was decided as as a part
of a time to a typo.

104
00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:08.876
Gatsby themes shared nav, there we go.

105
00:06:08.876 --> 00:06:12.483
It was determined that it's
a little unintuitive to have things

106
00:06:12.483 --> 00:06:14.233
like automatically applied.

107
00:06:14.233 --> 00:06:18.826
And honestly React is so good at just
making things into components that that by

108
00:06:18.826 --> 00:06:23.020
default, the behavior that should
be Gatsby doesn't do magic.

109
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.181
Like that was a way when
I used to work there.

110
00:06:25.181 --> 00:06:26.515
That was a mantra for us.

111
00:06:26.515 --> 00:06:31.284
We shouldn't do magic, like, there
should be only magic where it's actually

112
00:06:31.284 --> 00:06:33.785
useful and not where it's neat, right.

113
00:06:33.785 --> 00:06:37.517
And so layouts being automatically
applied got taken out but

114
00:06:37.517 --> 00:06:41.689
this Gatsby plugin layout is re
implementing that functionality in

115
00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:46.538
cases where you are consciously making
the decision that you want that magic.

116
00:06:46.538 --> 00:06:48.938
Because we want it to be, less work for

117
00:06:48.938 --> 00:06:51.866
somebody to install this
theme on their site.

118
00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:55.289
So once we have installed
Gatsby plugin layout,

119
00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:58.299
we can go to our themes, Gatsby.config.

120
00:06:58.299 --> 00:07:01.030
And we're going to set
up our plugins array.

121
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.532
And inside of that,
set up an object for the plugin, or

122
00:07:07.532 --> 00:07:13.098
resolve it to Gatsby,
plug in layout and then as the options.

123
00:07:13.098 --> 00:07:16.127
We want to tell it where our layout is.

124
00:07:16.127 --> 00:07:19.370
So the component is going
to be required out resolve.

125
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.990
You might recognize this from the way
that we do create pages calls.

126
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.978
It's the same general approach,

127
00:07:23.978 --> 00:07:28.960
except we're going to use dirname to
make sure that it uses this theme.

128
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.164
And not like whatever
theme it's installed in.

129
00:07:31.164 --> 00:07:37.140
So we'll do that and
source components layout.js So

130
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.917
the way that you instal
a theme is you have to

131
00:07:41.917 --> 00:07:46.058
actually go in to the Gatsby config.

132
00:07:46.058 --> 00:07:50.279
And we're gonna use
'gatsby-theme-shared-nav'.

133
00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:53.860
It wants us to restart.

134
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.316
Let's restart that dev server

135
00:08:05.766 --> 00:08:07.110
There it is.

136
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:11.842
So now with no changes to our site
outside of adding this one line to

137
00:08:11.842 --> 00:08:14.767
install the theme, we have added some,

138
00:08:14.767 --> 00:08:19.601
like overarching styles to the site
that make it look really nice.

139
00:08:19.601 --> 00:08:21.830
So, as we kinda navigate around here,

140
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.876
we can see that we didn't
have to make these changes.

141
00:08:24.876 --> 00:08:28.503
These changes were made for
us and as a site builder,

142
00:08:28.503 --> 00:08:33.377
if all I cared about was getting
information going onto the Internet.

143
00:08:33.377 --> 00:08:37.553
Having something like this that gives me
a baseline structure that I can just put

144
00:08:37.553 --> 00:08:39.685
content into is really, really handy.

145
00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:45.539
And if I'm a company that's trying to make
sure that people use a design system or

146
00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:50.542
otherwise kind of keep track of
the shared components or utilities.

147
00:08:50.542 --> 00:08:54.437
Themes are a great way to pass that around
if you standardize on Gatsby as the way

148
00:08:54.437 --> 00:08:55.565
you build for the web.

149
00:08:55.565 --> 00:09:01.510
So now that we've got that,
we can build out that shared nav component
