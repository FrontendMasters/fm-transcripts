1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.339
Let's get our mono repo set up, so

2
00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:05.897
the first thing I'm gonna
do is out in the main repo.

3
00:00:05.897 --> 00:00:11.589
And so this is something that's a little
bit different from a non mono repo.

4
00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:16.660
If you're building in a standard way, you
would put all of this the source folder,

5
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.220
the Gatsby config,
the package JSON, right on the root.

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.714
But because we're gonna be working on
multiple packages one's gonna be the site,

7
00:00:25.714 --> 00:00:30.750
one's gonna be our theme, we need a way
to differentiate those in our repo.

8
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.744
So I created a folder for the site, and

9
00:00:33.744 --> 00:00:37.497
now we need to tell yarn that it exists,
right?

10
00:00:37.497 --> 00:00:42.528
So we're gonna put another package
JSON in the root and inside of it,

11
00:00:42.528 --> 00:00:47.401
we're gonna tell it, just the bare
minimum that it needs to know.

12
00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:52.667
So we wanna make sure that this
doesn't get published to NPM,

13
00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:55.110
that is not what this is for.

14
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.014
Then we're going to say that
we're gonna use workspaces, and

15
00:00:59.014 --> 00:01:02.771
the way that workspaces work is
we give them an array of folder

16
00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:05.513
names that are the workspaces
we wanna use.

17
00:01:05.513 --> 00:01:09.647
So I'm going to set site,
which matches this here site, and

18
00:01:09.647 --> 00:01:13.716
that will tell yarn that we
wanna use that particular site.

19
00:01:13.716 --> 00:01:17.929
Then, because I want some shortcuts,
I'm gonna add some scripts.

20
00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.149
So my develop is going to run
the site development command, and

21
00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.780
the reason I'm adding a shortcut,
is it's a little verbose.

22
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.884
So if I run yarn workspace site develop,
that's what will cause

23
00:01:31.884 --> 00:01:37.571
this site to run what you would run
with NPM run develop or yarn develop.

24
00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:44.272
Because I don't wanna have to type that
every time now I can do yarn develop,

25
00:01:44.272 --> 00:01:48.265
and it will run yarn
workspace site develop.

26
00:01:48.265 --> 00:01:51.318
Same thing with the build command,

27
00:01:51.318 --> 00:01:56.219
I just want to alias that, so
yarn workspace site build.

28
00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.488
And that gives us our ability to shorthand
NPM, run, develop NPM run build.

29
00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:07.598
And that's it for this so
what we can do now is we can go over

30
00:02:07.598 --> 00:02:12.405
to our terminal, and
I can install my dependencies.

31
00:02:12.405 --> 00:02:16.895
So we start out by installing
all of our dependencies, and

32
00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:20.844
what's interesting here is
I ran this in the root.

33
00:02:20.844 --> 00:02:25.458
But because it saw this workspace,
it went into this site, and

34
00:02:25.458 --> 00:02:27.910
found its dependencies as well.

35
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.882
And so we can see here that all
the stuff we need for Gatsby,

36
00:02:31.882 --> 00:02:35.560
is actually up here at the top level,
instead of being in the site folder.

37
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.317
And that's really convenient because
that also means when you're working with

38
00:02:39.317 --> 00:02:42.519
workspaces, if your packages share
the same version of something,

39
00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.243
you don't have to install it twice.

40
00:02:44.243 --> 00:02:50.509
You'll just have one node modules folder,
and then it kinda does this alias here so

41
00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:55.361
that we've got access to the Gatsby
command inside of the site.

42
00:02:55.361 --> 00:02:59.148
And then,
now that we've got this set up, we can,

43
00:03:01.858 --> 00:03:04.997
We're gonna tell Netlify
how to find our mono repo.

44
00:03:04.997 --> 00:03:10.280
So we're gonna create a new
file called netlify..toml,

45
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.785
and in this, we're just gonna tell this
is for the CLI to know where the site is.

46
00:03:17.785 --> 00:03:21.722
So we're gonna set base site, and
that's just to say when you build this,

47
00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:23.799
the site is what we're gonna publish.

48
00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.863
The theme is a supporting file that will
actually be installed by the site, so

49
00:03:27.863 --> 00:03:31.364
when we publish this mono repo
the only thing that we want to build,

50
00:03:31.364 --> 00:03:34.070
is the site so
we can move netlify into that folder.

51
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.736
And finally, now that we've installed our
dependencies, we can run netlify dev,

52
00:03:41.736 --> 00:03:46.180
and netlify dev is a CLI command
that gives us a lot of power.

53
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.797
It auto detects what you're using, so

54
00:03:48.797 --> 00:03:53.015
it can see what framework we're using,
we're using Gatsby.

55
00:03:53.015 --> 00:03:57.651
It runs the develop command for us, and
you can see here that it's kinda doing

56
00:03:57.651 --> 00:04:02.023
some environment variable stuff,
that'll become more useful later.

57
00:04:02.023 --> 00:04:07.056
So then it runs our Gatsby
develop command, And

58
00:04:07.056 --> 00:04:10.920
once this is done here, it's actually
gonna pop open a browser for us.

59
00:04:13.168 --> 00:04:18.968
&gt;&gt; It has mauled out so, when we were
setting up our yarn file write so

60
00:04:18.968 --> 00:04:24.556
what it was was it detects
the package.JSON inside the site for

61
00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:26.463
our folder, right?

62
00:04:26.463 --> 00:04:32.040
So when we set up a couple of more
folders like you said a theme,

63
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.920
and maybe we are having
a couple of themes.

64
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.939
So will the yarn file detect each and
every package JSON or

65
00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:48.271
recursively, through those file structure
and install all of the dependencies?

66
00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:53.223
&gt;&gt; No so, what it will do is it will
detect the ones that we've told it to so,

67
00:04:53.223 --> 00:04:55.035
we told it to look at site.

68
00:04:55.035 --> 00:04:58.437
And so it's gonna look in here and
actually this is a good point,

69
00:04:58.437 --> 00:05:01.467
it uses the name in here,
which can be kind of confusing.

70
00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:06.621
So, when we did yarn workspace
site develop, it's looking for

71
00:05:06.621 --> 00:05:10.731
this package name, and
not the name of the folder.

72
00:05:10.731 --> 00:05:15.221
So that can be a little bit confusing, so
if this folder was called websites but

73
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:19.659
the package in here was called site,
you would put website as the workspace.

74
00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:22.587
But you would still run yarn
workspace site develop, so

75
00:05:22.587 --> 00:05:25.453
that's why I always named
the folders the same thing,

76
00:05:25.453 --> 00:05:28.523
cuz otherwise I get really confused and
it has a hard time.

77
00:05:28.523 --> 00:05:32.184
If you want it to auto detect
a whole group of things,

78
00:05:32.184 --> 00:05:35.846
you can do I think it's either a star or
double star,

79
00:05:35.846 --> 00:05:40.276
we're not gonna use that today,
but I have used it in the past.

80
00:05:40.276 --> 00:05:45.694
It's documented well on the yarn
workspaces docs if you wanna do that,

81
00:05:45.694 --> 00:05:50.411
but that will auto detect
the packages inside of that folder.

82
00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:54.786
So that can be really nice if you're
working on a mono repo that's got all of

83
00:05:54.786 --> 00:05:58.331
your your open source node packages or
something like that,

84
00:05:58.331 --> 00:06:02.716
where you don't wanna have to
explicitly declare each one.

85
00:06:02.716 --> 00:06:07.657
Okay, so we're up and running, we've got
the site is functioning now a slight

86
00:06:07.657 --> 00:06:11.961
difference Gatsby goes to 8,000
netlify dev goes to 8888.

87
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:14.543
That's because it is running
Gatsby at Port 1000 and

88
00:06:14.543 --> 00:06:17.087
then proxying it along with
the serverless functions.

89
00:06:17.087 --> 00:06:22.378
So that way we were able to go in, and
otherwise everything is exactly the same.

90
00:06:22.378 --> 00:06:25.168
If we come in here and make a change,

91
00:06:25.168 --> 00:06:30.380
then it's auto updated everything
happens very, very quickly.

92
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.930
So great, we have a development
environment, were up and running now.
