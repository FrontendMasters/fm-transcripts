1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.429
So for our shared nav here,
let's dive into the theme.

2
00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:07.602
So I'll collapse that site down.

3
00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:12.401
What I want is the name
of the site up here.

4
00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:14.765
And then I want navigation over here, and

5
00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:18.289
the items will just kinda grow
out from the site as we add more.

6
00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.784
So by default,
we're just gonna link to the homepage,

7
00:00:20.784 --> 00:00:24.197
cuz that's the only thing that we're
pretty sure every site is gonna have.

8
00:00:24.197 --> 00:00:26.884
It's pretty rare that you don't
have a home page on your site.

9
00:00:26.884 --> 00:00:33.051
So if that's the case, then I want to be
able to let people configure, so for us,

10
00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:38.884
for example, I want the ability to set
a link to the authors and to the books.

11
00:00:38.884 --> 00:00:43.195
So in the theme,
I'm gonna use just the site metadata,

12
00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:47.704
which is a built in way to
handle this sort of information.

13
00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:52.960
So we can set the title, and we'll start
by saying Gatsby Theme Shared Nav.

14
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.800
And then in here, we can say navItems, and
we can just set these to whatever we want.

15
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.304
So I'm gonna make it an array,
I'm going to put in just the one for now.

16
00:01:02.304 --> 00:01:05.284
So the label will be the text that shows,
the Home.

17
00:01:05.284 --> 00:01:10.539
And the path will be a forward slash for
taking us to the homepage.

18
00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:12.645
And so this is gonna be the way
that we configure this theme.

19
00:01:12.645 --> 00:01:16.471
There's also a way, and I just realized
I put this in the wrong place.

20
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:20.270
Let me take this out cuz I was
looking at the wrong Gatsby config.

21
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.764
I want this to be in
the theme Gatsby config,

22
00:01:24.764 --> 00:01:28.778
this one, so I'm gonna put that here.

23
00:01:28.778 --> 00:01:34.608
And then this one I want to leave,
the site one we'll leave alone.

24
00:01:34.608 --> 00:01:40.124
So this should, retriggered,
did it actually start?

25
00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:44.219
No, so we're gonna notify dev, and

26
00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.724
that puts these into our GraphQL layer.

27
00:01:48.724 --> 00:01:54.958
So we'll see those as part
of the GraphQL layer,

28
00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:58.007
something went wrong.

29
00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:03.580
Site meta data, yeah, that's correct.

30
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.967
That was a helpful validation.

31
00:02:05.967 --> 00:02:09.617
I thought they would just go quietly and
then we'd be really confused.

32
00:02:09.617 --> 00:02:12.382
Okay, so it validated our config for us.

33
00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:14.858
And now we're gonna put this in.

34
00:02:14.858 --> 00:02:19.683
Now keep in mind,
this is the Gatsby config for the theme,

35
00:02:19.683 --> 00:02:21.762
not the one for the site.

36
00:02:21.762 --> 00:02:26.535
So when I go out to graphical,
and I reload,

37
00:02:26.535 --> 00:02:30.921
I can pull in the site and site metadata.

38
00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:35.277
And it's gonna give me my title and
my nav items.

39
00:02:37.283 --> 00:02:40.935
Gotta turn off this ID
that we're not using.

40
00:02:42.062 --> 00:02:46.017
There we go.

41
00:02:46.017 --> 00:02:51.008
And so
now we can just query this right out.

42
00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:54.017
So what I want to do is in my site,
I just wanna override this.

43
00:02:54.017 --> 00:02:58.801
So I'm gonna take this part, I can
copy it, move into the Gatsby config,

44
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:02.291
drop this in and
we're gonna say this is My Book Club.

45
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:06.673
And then we will skip the Home,
we don't actually wanna go home,

46
00:03:06.673 --> 00:03:09.073
we're gonna do books and authors.

47
00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:21.733
Okay, so now that we've got that,
if we rerun this query,

48
00:03:21.733 --> 00:03:27.688
we can see that it automatically overrode
so that we've got these new values.

49
00:03:27.688 --> 00:03:29.303
Great, that's what we wanted.

50
00:03:29.303 --> 00:03:33.050
We're gonna need some styles, so in
the interest of keeping everything in one

51
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.995
place and not jumping around between
files, let's start with the styles for it.

52
00:03:36.995 --> 00:03:39.914
So the way that our nav is gonna work
is it's gonna live in a container.

53
00:03:39.914 --> 00:03:41.713
And that container is gonna be
up at the top of the screen.

54
00:03:41.713 --> 00:03:47.141
So for that I want the background
to be our dark color and

55
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:51.861
then I want the color of
it to be our light color.

56
00:03:51.861 --> 00:03:56.511
We will set it to display flex,
because I want the logo on one side and

57
00:03:56.511 --> 00:03:59.217
the items on another side, remember?

58
00:03:59.217 --> 00:04:04.933
I will justify the content
with space between and

59
00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:08.008
then we'll do margin 0.

60
00:04:08.008 --> 00:04:11.205
We will do padding, 0.5 rem and

61
00:04:11.205 --> 00:04:16.504
we'll give it 5% of the viewport
width on either side.

62
00:04:16.504 --> 00:04:19.143
And that'll give us a box
that we can put things in.

63
00:04:19.143 --> 00:04:22.745
Then we're gonna have our shared nav.

64
00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:27.263
And that shared nav is going
to be also display flex,

65
00:04:27.263 --> 00:04:32.204
because I want to justify content and
put space between.

66
00:04:32.204 --> 00:04:39.103
And I'm gonna put a little bit of a gap
in there, so we'll give it a 1 rem gap.

67
00:04:39.103 --> 00:04:43.136
Then we're gonna style
up the links in the nav.

68
00:04:43.136 --> 00:04:46.067
So we want those to be whatever
the color of the nav is.

69
00:04:46.067 --> 00:04:50.180
We're gonna set padding so that it's
a little easier to click on them.

70
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.588
And we will set the text
decoration to none.

71
00:04:53.588 --> 00:04:55.342
And since we took the text decoration off,

72
00:04:55.342 --> 00:04:57.694
we gotta do a little bit of
work to make these accessible.

73
00:04:57.694 --> 00:05:01.972
So let's do a link focus, link, not like.

74
00:05:05.115 --> 00:05:11.436
And a link hover, and then with those,
let's just invert the background.

75
00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:17.189
We will set the background color to be,
Our light color,

76
00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:21.780
and then we'll set the color of
the text to be our dark color.

77
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.704
So that should signify pretty
clearly that we are using

78
00:05:26.704 --> 00:05:31.103
what we're hovering over,
what we focused on.

79
00:05:31.103 --> 00:05:35.488
So now that we've got that,
we can set up our components.

80
00:05:35.488 --> 00:05:38.884
So let's set up a nav.js,

81
00:05:38.884 --> 00:05:43.464
and in nav.js we're going to import

82
00:05:43.464 --> 00:05:48.202
everything as React from 'react'.

83
00:05:48.202 --> 00:05:55.417
We're going to import Link,
useStaticQuery and

84
00:05:55.417 --> 00:06:01.037
graphql, From gatsby.

85
00:06:02.714 --> 00:06:05.781
And we're also gonna get
the styles that we set.

86
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:09.368
So the container, sharedNav, and
link from styles/nav.module.css.

87
00:06:09.368 --> 00:06:17.054
And now we can export
a function called Nav,

88
00:06:17.054 --> 00:06:22.881
which will be our nav component.

89
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.170
And I'm gonna start by getting data,

90
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.676
that's gonna be usestaticQuery graphql.

91
00:06:32.676 --> 00:06:36.880
And we can set up a query here,
we'll get our site, site metadata.

92
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.427
And then we want the title,
the nav items, and

93
00:06:42.427 --> 00:06:49.124
then we want the label and
path for each nav item, oops.

94
00:06:50.491 --> 00:06:52.643
One more, good.

95
00:06:52.643 --> 00:06:54.578
Then we can get out our nav items
from data.site.siteMetadata,

96
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.604
navItems.

97
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:14.913
And we can return a header with
a class name of container.

98
00:07:14.913 --> 00:07:20.664
Then we'll link to our homepage, and

99
00:07:20.664 --> 00:07:26.964
that's gonna have a class name of a link.

100
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:34.752
And inside of it, we'll use
the data.site.siteMetadata.title.

101
00:07:36.301 --> 00:07:42.940
All right, then we can set up
our nav Items, so navItems.map.

102
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.451
And for each one, we're going to,

103
00:07:49.464 --> 00:07:55.875
Set up a link with a key of the,
we'll give it a unique name,

104
00:07:55.875 --> 00:08:02.688
so nav item.path is somewhat unique,
we'll make that okay.

105
00:08:02.688 --> 00:08:10.202
We'll link that to item.path,
we'll give that a class name of link.

106
00:08:10.202 --> 00:08:15.822
And inside of it,
we're going to put the item.label.

107
00:08:15.822 --> 00:08:23.117
Okay, so now that we've saved that,
we can import it into here.

108
00:08:23.117 --> 00:08:29.577
import nav from nav.js and
then we'll use it right here.

109
00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.191
And let's go check it out.

110
00:08:37.266 --> 00:08:42.244
I missed something,
I missed in my header a,

111
00:08:46.803 --> 00:08:49.132
I missed the end of my loop.

112
00:08:54.709 --> 00:08:58.597
And then I missed another
closing parenthesis.

113
00:08:58.597 --> 00:09:01.414
Hey, there we go, so that's better.

114
00:09:01.414 --> 00:09:03.572
That's a little weird,
that's not exactly what I wanted.

115
00:09:03.572 --> 00:09:06.724
Maybe we should mess
with this a little bit.

116
00:09:09.735 --> 00:09:13.945
Maybe we want these ones instead of
being space-between to be flex, and

117
00:09:13.945 --> 00:09:16.648
I didn't wrap it in the nav
is what went wrong.

118
00:09:16.648 --> 00:09:22.922
So let's go back into our nav,
and we're gonna put nav,

119
00:09:22.922 --> 00:09:27.520
and that needs a class name of sharedNav.

120
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.295
And then we can drop this around and
that should fix everything.

121
00:09:31.295 --> 00:09:34.462
There it is,
that's what we were actually after.

122
00:09:34.462 --> 00:09:38.140
And so we can put that gap back in now,
cuz that's a gap isn't.

123
00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.858
Okay, good, all right, so
we have a nice looking shared nav,

124
00:09:41.858 --> 00:09:45.381
we can go to the books page,
we can go to the author's page.

125
00:09:45.381 --> 00:09:48.093
We can click around,
get to where we wanna go.

126
00:09:48.093 --> 00:09:50.099
And this is all, I mean,
this is great, right?

127
00:09:50.099 --> 00:09:51.109
This is what we want.
