00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
What I wanna do is,
I wanna show what happens,

2
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.530
like what if I wanna change this.

3
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.481
So what if I decide that I
want my header to be blue.

4
00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:19.503
If I wanna do that, well how do I even
get to the code, if I had installed

5
00:00:19.503 --> 00:00:25.313
this as a package instead of installing it
like having it in a mono repo like this.

6
00:00:25.313 --> 00:00:30.361
I don't have access to this source code,
so it might just out of luck do

7
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:36.280
I need to fork this theme and make my own
fortunately gatsby thought through this.

8
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.743
Gatsby themes were designed by
Christmas guardian John tender and

9
00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:43.684
a couple other really, really smart
folks and they were kinda thinking okay,

10
00:00:43.684 --> 00:00:45.431
what is this experience gonna be?

11
00:00:45.431 --> 00:00:50.174
And the concept they came up with
is something they call shadowing.

12
00:00:50.174 --> 00:00:55.628
Which is the idea that I can selectively
replace a file from a theme,

13
00:00:55.628 --> 00:00:59.084
by creating a specific path in my project.

14
00:00:59.084 --> 00:01:02.492
So let's do a little bit
of file shadowing here.

15
00:01:02.492 --> 00:01:06.983
And what I'm gonna do is the reason we
set up that variables dot CSS is so

16
00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:10.041
that we could only shadow
the color variables.

17
00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:13.522
And that's why it was important to
make that just a tiny little file cuz,

18
00:01:13.522 --> 00:01:16.052
otherwise, we'd have to
copy out the whole thing.

19
00:01:16.052 --> 00:01:20.295
So what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna take this variables file,

20
00:01:20.295 --> 00:01:23.463
I'm gonna copy it, so I'm just doing copy.

21
00:01:23.463 --> 00:01:26.338
And then in my site source folder,

22
00:01:26.338 --> 00:01:31.904
I'm gonna create a folder
called gatsby-theme-shared-nav.

23
00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:36.560
And then inside of that, we're going to
treat this as if it were the source folder

24
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.619
of gatsby-theme-shared-nav.

25
00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.195
So I wanna get into styles and then inside
of that we're gonna put in variables.CSS.

26
00:01:43.195 --> 00:01:47.838
So lemme oops create a new
folder called styles.

27
00:01:47.838 --> 00:01:52.328
And then inside of that,
I'm gonna paste our variables.CSS, and

28
00:01:52.328 --> 00:01:55.338
I'm going to change our
black to a dark blue.

29
00:01:55.338 --> 00:01:58.982
That should be still be
enough contrast to work.

30
00:01:58.982 --> 00:02:03.993
And I'm going to stop and restart because
when you do shadowing you're changing

31
00:02:03.993 --> 00:02:08.706
the file system, you need to basically
get gatsby to get a fresh look at it for

32
00:02:08.706 --> 00:02:10.194
that to work properly.

33
00:02:10.194 --> 00:02:14.995
So this is probably one of those like,
it's not the most

34
00:02:14.995 --> 00:02:20.308
straightforward thing the first
time you're looking at it,

35
00:02:20.308 --> 00:02:26.353
because basically what we just did,
is we told gatsby use this theme.

36
00:02:26.353 --> 00:02:32.853
But look in this folder where I named
it specifically to match this theme and

37
00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:37.822
replace variables dot CSS into
the theme with this file.

38
00:02:37.822 --> 00:02:43.129
And otherwise use it exactly the same,
so the cumulative effect

39
00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.856
of what we've done,
is if we were to just edit the theme.

40
00:02:47.856 --> 00:02:52.703
As far as the theme is concerned, this
file no longer exists, it's now this one.

41
00:02:52.703 --> 00:02:54.902
And that's how shadowing is designed.

42
00:02:54.902 --> 00:02:59.733
It's a really powerful approach
that gives us the ability

43
00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:04.572
to modify themes without having
to fully eject from them.

44
00:03:04.572 --> 00:03:09.068
There's a concept that I really
like that I've written about in

45
00:03:09.068 --> 00:03:13.077
the past called progressive
disclosure of complexity.

46
00:03:13.077 --> 00:03:18.017
And what progressive disclosure
of complexity is this kind of

47
00:03:18.017 --> 00:03:19.827
concept of teaching.

48
00:03:19.827 --> 00:03:25.016
And so this is in UX, Nielsen Norman
group has written about it, and

49
00:03:25.016 --> 00:03:30.114
I've written about it in the terms
of just kind of like teaching and

50
00:03:30.114 --> 00:03:31.860
learning in general.

51
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.896
But the idea is that you let somebody get
into something without having to touch

52
00:03:35.896 --> 00:03:36.517
anything.

53
00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:39.582
And then as they wanna get deeper into it,

54
00:03:39.582 --> 00:03:43.799
they can only get it the extra
complexity that they need.

55
00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.120
It's not all or nothing I think if you
ever use create react app back in the day,

56
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.246
the experience was you could use create
react app until you wanted to change

57
00:03:52.246 --> 00:03:56.595
literally anything and then you had to
eject and then you owned all of the code.

58
00:03:56.595 --> 00:04:00.394
For create react app, and it was
separate from the create react app cord.

59
00:04:00.394 --> 00:04:06.077
And so this was an idea, it was easy until
you injected to all of the complexity.

60
00:04:06.077 --> 00:04:08.784
You either had full automation or
fully manual.

61
00:04:08.784 --> 00:04:13.441
And with progressive disclosure,
what you're getting is this concept of,

62
00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:16.662
I want automatic until I
need to customize one thing,

63
00:04:16.662 --> 00:04:19.258
and then lemme make that one thing manual.

64
00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:20.587
So that's what we're doing here.

65
00:04:20.587 --> 00:04:24.076
We've said I wanna use
everything about this theme,

66
00:04:24.076 --> 00:04:26.334
except I wanna modify this color.

67
00:04:26.334 --> 00:04:31.623
So I shadow the variables, and then I
can replace the colors that I want and

68
00:04:31.623 --> 00:04:35.308
if I want to do a full theme,
I could do that as well.

69
00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:38.063
And now the site is
showing this dark blue.

70
00:04:38.063 --> 00:04:44.253
So that's a really kind of lightweight
look at how shadowing works,

71
00:04:44.253 --> 00:04:50.991
any of the other examples that we could
do would be a little heavier handed.

72
00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:53.642
Just because there's not too
much going on in this theme.

73
00:04:53.642 --> 00:04:57.773
So I want to show something that
would illustrate the concept

74
00:04:57.773 --> 00:05:00.044
without getting into the weeds.

75
00:05:00.044 --> 00:05:02.212
And this is I think
a pretty good look at it.

76
00:05:02.212 --> 00:05:05.240
So that's how file shadowing works.
