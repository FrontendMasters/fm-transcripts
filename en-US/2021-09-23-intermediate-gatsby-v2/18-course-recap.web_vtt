00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.780
Just as a general recap before we go into
deployment, and then we're gonna look at

2
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.730
environment variables here a little bit,
let's poke at what we built today.

3
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.594
So first and foremost,
we set up custom data.

4
00:00:13.594 --> 00:00:17.050
We were able to pull in custom
data from these JSON files,

5
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.290
we could have pulled them in
from a third party API, or

6
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.970
could use software as a service thing,
could use a headless CMS, whatever.

7
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.642
And using those and the Gatsby source
nodes API, we were able to specify some

8
00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:37.740
relationships between them and then create
nodes in the graph QL layer for each one.

9
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.665
We were also able to use the create
pages API to then go ahead and

10
00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:47.000
turn all of these into like
here we got our books.

11
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.475
We turned our books into pages,
with some special handling,

12
00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:55.619
we needed some logic for
the way that the slugs were done.

13
00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:59.748
And that let us to some
customization in the data itself,

14
00:00:59.748 --> 00:01:03.340
we wanted to be able to create a bio-link.

15
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.230
We wanted to be able to get the cover
image from a third party service.

16
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.676
So we use the Open Library to find
those covers and then turn that into

17
00:01:11.676 --> 00:01:16.060
a locally optimized image by loading
it in with a custom resolver.

18
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.590
All of that led to us
building out these pages.

19
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.863
And then we dug into client only routes,
were able to get those up and running,

20
00:01:26.863 --> 00:01:33.490
we got protected routes up and running,
and we also built ourselves a theme.

21
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.818
So with a Gatsby theme,
we were able to set up this header and

22
00:01:36.818 --> 00:01:40.214
the nav and all that good stuff
with this shared styling, and

23
00:01:40.214 --> 00:01:43.490
we didn't actually have to
include that nav on anything.

24
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.046
So if you look at our pages, our pages
actually don't have any reference to like

25
00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:51.660
a layout, there's no layout here
we just export this markup.

26
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.173
But when we go to the books page, you can
see that it still has this layout apply,

27
00:01:55.173 --> 00:01:57.070
that's the power of a theme.

28
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.538
And we used some tools including
just regular old config by

29
00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:06.510
overriding the site metadata
which composes in themes.

30
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.038
To set our site title and
the nav items, and

31
00:02:10.038 --> 00:02:14.353
then we also use a technique
called file shadowing.

32
00:02:14.353 --> 00:02:19.882
To replace the variables and change
the heading color to dark blue up here,

33
00:02:19.882 --> 00:02:23.700
so that we were able to
have a dark blue header.

34
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.709
&gt;&gt; I'm just curious, so
the way you did the data pool,

35
00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.370
I've been putting it in a in
a direct in a plugins directory.

36
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.210
Did you do it differently
because this is a monocyte?

37
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:44.041
Or is has the convention just changed or
is it could you just do it either way?

38
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:49.359
&gt;&gt; I mean the idea of making a custom
plugin for your site to handle

39
00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:54.950
stuff like data pulling that's
an organizational choice.

40
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.130
If I had a really complicated.

41
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.340
To the node, which we are kind
of approaching that, right?

42
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.600
This is a fairly complex Gatsby
node file where it 150 lines.

43
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.659
So I could pull all of this out
into like a Gatsby plugin books.

44
00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.843
That would be locally installed and
then I could use it and

45
00:03:14.843 --> 00:03:18.852
not have to look at this as
part of my actual site build,

46
00:03:18.852 --> 00:03:22.535
it mostly comes down to your preference,
right?

47
00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:27.111
Because there's cleanliness of having
it tucked away in a plugin is nice you

48
00:03:27.111 --> 00:03:28.980
don't have to think about it.

49
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.720
You don't have to look at it.

50
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.832
If I was shipping this to lots and
lots of developers,

51
00:03:32.832 --> 00:03:36.500
I would probably consider that
because it's one less thing for

52
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.360
somebody to get intimidated by to stumble
into and accidentally break their site.

53
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.309
The other side of it though,
like the trade off here is that,

54
00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:46.810
that's an indirection.

55
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.509
So by taking it out of the site setup and
putting it into a separate directory,

56
00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:53.316
if it's not gonna be reused,

57
00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:58.580
you're adding a layer of indirection
around the where the data is coming from.

58
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.684
So it's ultimately a matter of preference
I would say way the the use case and

59
00:04:02.684 --> 00:04:06.630
where it's gonna live and
how many people have to look at it.

60
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.950
Who has to maintain the data itself versus
who has to just use what comes out of it?

61
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.360
And based on the answers
to those questions,

62
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.460
I think both answers are good answers.
