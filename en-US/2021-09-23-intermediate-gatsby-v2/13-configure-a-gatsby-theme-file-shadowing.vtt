00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:05.579
What I wanna do is I wanna
show what happens if we like,

2
00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:08.319
what if I want to change this.

3
00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:13.571
So what if I decide that I
want my header to be blue,

4
00:00:13.571 --> 00:00:18.583
if I wanna do that,
how do I even get to the code?

5
00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:22.573
If I had installed this as a package,
instead of installing it as a,

6
00:00:22.573 --> 00:00:27.275
having it in a monitor repo like this,
I don't have access to this source code.

7
00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:30.437
So am I just out of luck?

8
00:00:30.437 --> 00:00:32.315
Do I need to fork this theme and
make my own?

9
00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:36.537
Fortunately Gatsby thought through this,
Gatsby themes were designed by

10
00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:41.375
Christmas Guardian, Johnno Tender and
a couple other really, really smart folks.

11
00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:45.511
And they were kinda thinking like,
okay, what is the experience gonna be?

12
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:50.024
And the concept they came up with
is something they call shadowing.

13
00:00:50.024 --> 00:00:54.646
Which is the idea that I can
selectively replace a file from

14
00:00:54.646 --> 00:00:58.620
a theme by creating a specific
path in my project.

15
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.558
So let's do a little bit
of file shadowing here.

16
00:01:02.558 --> 00:01:06.966
And what I'm gonna do is the reason we
set up that variables dot CSS is so

17
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.978
that we could only shadow
the color variables.

18
00:01:09.978 --> 00:01:12.732
And that's why it was important to
make that just a tiny little file.

19
00:01:12.732 --> 00:01:16.183
Cuz otherwise,
we'd have to copy out the whole thing.

20
00:01:16.183 --> 00:01:20.540
So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take
this variables file, I'm gonna copy it,

21
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.989
so, I'm just doing copy.

22
00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:25.208
And then in my site source folder,

23
00:01:25.208 --> 00:01:30.988
I'm gonna create a folder called
Gatsby theme, shared nav.

24
00:01:30.988 --> 00:01:35.266
And then inside of that,
we're going to treat this as if it were

25
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:38.427
the source folder of
Gatsby theme shared nav.

26
00:01:38.427 --> 00:01:39.297
So I want to get into styles.

27
00:01:39.297 --> 00:01:44.299
And then inside of that,
we're gonna put in variables dot CSS.

28
00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.284
So let me create a new folder,
called styles.

29
00:01:50.284 --> 00:01:53.238
And then inside of that,
I'm gonna paste our variables dot CSS and

30
00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:55.159
I'm gonna change our black to a dark blue.

31
00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.032
That should be still be
enough contrast to work.

32
00:02:00.032 --> 00:02:04.412
And I'm gonna stop and restart because
when you do shadowing you're changing

33
00:02:04.412 --> 00:02:08.654
the file system, you need to basically
get Gatsby to get a fresh look at it for

34
00:02:08.654 --> 00:02:09.999
that to work properly.

35
00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:14.508
And so this is probably one of those,
it's not the most

36
00:02:14.508 --> 00:02:19.620
straightforward thing the first
time you're looking at it.

37
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.622
Because basically what we just did
is we told Gatsby use this theme,

38
00:02:25.622 --> 00:02:32.257
but look in this folder where I named
it specifically to match this theme and

39
00:02:32.257 --> 00:02:37.233
replace variables.CSS into
the theme with this file.

40
00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:39.325
And otherwise use it exactly the same.

41
00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:47.789
So the cumulative effect of what we've
done is if we were to just edit the theme.

42
00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.677
As far as the theme is concerned,
this file no longer exists.

43
00:02:50.677 --> 00:02:51.771
It's now this one.

44
00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:54.678
And that's how shadowing is designed.

45
00:02:54.678 --> 00:02:59.665
It's a really powerful approach
that gives us the ability to

46
00:02:59.665 --> 00:03:04.270
modify themes without having
to fully eject from them.

47
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.902
There's a concept that I really
like that I've written about in

48
00:03:08.902 --> 00:03:13.039
the past called progressive
disclosure of complexity.

49
00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:16.888
And what progressive
disclosure of complexity is,

50
00:03:16.888 --> 00:03:19.603
is this kind of concept of teaching.

51
00:03:19.603 --> 00:03:25.309
And so there's, like this is in UX and
Nielsen Norman group has written about it,

52
00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:30.189
and I've written about it in the terms
of just kind of like teaching and

53
00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:31.782
learning in general.

54
00:03:31.782 --> 00:03:34.732
But the idea is that you
let somebody get into

55
00:03:34.732 --> 00:03:37.857
something without having
to touch anything.

56
00:03:37.857 --> 00:03:38.565
And then as they wanna get deeper into it,

57
00:03:38.565 --> 00:03:39.505
they can only get the extra
complexity that they need.

58
00:03:39.505 --> 00:03:45.210
It's not all or nothing.

59
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.390
I think if you ever use create react app
back in the day, the experience was you

60
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.586
could use create react app, until you
wanted to change literally anything.

61
00:03:53.586 --> 00:03:56.571
And then you had to eject and
then you owned all of the code for

62
00:03:56.571 --> 00:04:00.123
create react app, and it was separate
from the create react app core.

63
00:04:00.123 --> 00:04:01.993
And so this was an idea of,

64
00:04:01.993 --> 00:04:05.917
it was easy until you eject
it to all of the complexity.

65
00:04:05.917 --> 00:04:08.037
You either had full automation or
fully manual.

66
00:04:08.037 --> 00:04:12.947
And with progressive disclosure,
what you're getting is this concept of,

67
00:04:12.947 --> 00:04:16.420
I want automatic until I need
to customize one thing and

68
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.928
then let me make that one thing manual.

69
00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:23.605
So that's what we're doing here is we've
said I wanna use everything about this

70
00:04:23.605 --> 00:04:26.103
theme, except I wanna modify this color.

71
00:04:26.103 --> 00:04:31.355
So I shadow the variables, and then I
can replace the colors that I want and

72
00:04:31.355 --> 00:04:35.184
if I wanted to do a full theme,
I could do that as well.

73
00:04:35.184 --> 00:04:36.784
And now the site is
showing this dark blue.

74
00:04:36.784 --> 00:04:44.222
So that's a really kind of lightweight,
look at how shadowing works.

75
00:04:44.222 --> 00:04:49.670
Any of the other examples that we could
do would be a little heavier handed.

76
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.576
Just because there's not too much going
on in this theme, so I wanted to show

77
00:04:54.576 --> 00:04:59.650
something that would illustrate the
concept without getting into the weeds.

78
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.267
And this is I think
a pretty good look at it.

79
00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:05.148
So that's how file shadowing works.
