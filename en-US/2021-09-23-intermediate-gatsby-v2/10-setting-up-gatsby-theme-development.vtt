1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.657
So let's do a quick recap of
where we are on this site, right?

2
00:00:03.657 --> 00:00:08.536
So what we've done to date is we've
made ourselves a website that will

3
00:00:08.536 --> 00:00:12.503
show us a list of books,
show us a list of all authors, and

4
00:00:12.503 --> 00:00:15.250
let us see individual pages for those.

5
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.427
The way that we were able to create
that was by customizing the way that

6
00:00:19.427 --> 00:00:22.825
Gatsby creates pages and
the way that it pulls in data.

7
00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:27.352
So we are pulling in some JSON data,
this could be data from anywhere,

8
00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:31.751
we could pull it in from third
party API's, or whatever we needed.

9
00:00:31.751 --> 00:00:36.352
And once we have that, we are defining
some relationships between that data.

10
00:00:36.352 --> 00:00:40.206
And then we're creating data nodes for
each one,

11
00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:43.707
which puts it into
Gatsby's graph qL layer.

12
00:00:43.707 --> 00:00:47.214
Then using that data, or
actually before we use the data,

13
00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:49.791
we get down to this create resolvers here,

14
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:54.822
where we're able to extend the data with
custom resolvers that give us new fields.

15
00:00:54.822 --> 00:00:59.616
So we created a biolink,
which gives us the ability to link out and

16
00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:01.633
see the place to purchase.

17
00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:05.481
And we also created a cover,
which is a remote image.

18
00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:09.240
So we look up the book
in the open library API.

19
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.909
We then get a link to
the book's cover image, and

20
00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.412
have Gatsby pull that in
as a remote file node.

21
00:01:16.412 --> 00:01:20.681
And by configuring Gatsby
config with image plugins,

22
00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:25.241
we're able to get an optimized image for
each book cover.

23
00:01:25.241 --> 00:01:28.021
So we got quite a ways here.

24
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:33.628
But as you may have noticed, this is
not the most visually appealing site,

25
00:01:33.628 --> 00:01:38.347
we've pretty much ignored
the visuals of this site entirely.

26
00:01:38.347 --> 00:01:42.973
And what I wanna do is just kind of
dig into how we can make this more

27
00:01:42.973 --> 00:01:47.855
visually appealing, but in a way
that if I wanted to build more sites

28
00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:51.820
like this in the future,
I could reuse that content.

29
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.171
And so to do that, we're gonna introduce
what's known as Gatsby themes.

30
00:01:57.171 --> 00:02:01.262
So under the hood,
a Gatsby theme is almost a Gatsby plugin.

31
00:02:01.262 --> 00:02:02.479
You install it the same way,

32
00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.851
we're gonna put it into the plugins array
just like we would any other plugin.

33
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:10.930
But the difference is a Gatsby
theme has a few special properties,

34
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.753
one It can extend our Gatsby config.

35
00:02:13.753 --> 00:02:16.852
So we can install our own
plugins that way, and

36
00:02:16.852 --> 00:02:20.042
we'll show you how that
works here in a minute.

37
00:02:20.042 --> 00:02:23.742
You can provide components that will
wrap things which is what we're

38
00:02:23.742 --> 00:02:25.801
gonna do with this particular theme.

39
00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:28.194
You can provide shared styles,

40
00:02:28.194 --> 00:02:33.332
you can do a whole lot of Kind of
foundational work that makes building

41
00:02:33.332 --> 00:02:38.970
multiple websites even easier if
they're all kind of in the same vein.

42
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.777
So this is a really, really powerful
approach if you are an agency developer.

43
00:02:42.777 --> 00:02:48.275
If you work with clients, and you want to
have the ability for a lot of different

44
00:02:48.275 --> 00:02:53.214
websites to start with the same
general boilerplate whether that is.

45
00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:55.519
If you're building a frontend
that's a little more advanced,

46
00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.890
maybe you need to wrap
everything in context providers.

47
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.113
Maybe you've got some shared hooks that
you use in almost every site that make

48
00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:02.411
your life a little bit easier.

49
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:05.383
Or maybe you're using tailwind,
and you've got a base config.

50
00:03:05.383 --> 00:03:09.218
Any of those sorts of things can
be wrapped up into a Gatsby theme,

51
00:03:09.218 --> 00:03:12.705
and then installed onto a site so
that you start at that point

52
00:03:12.705 --> 00:03:16.785
without having to build your own
starter that you can then maintain.

53
00:03:16.785 --> 00:03:21.287
The benefit of this is that if I use a
starter, I'm getting a copy of that site,

54
00:03:21.287 --> 00:03:25.951
and all of its config, and all of its
components, and everything that's in it.

55
00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:30.071
And if I make changes, it's now
completely diverged from the starter.

56
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:35.680
If improvements get made to the starter, I
have to manually port those into my code,

57
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.242
which is to be honest,
probably never gonna happen.

58
00:03:39.242 --> 00:03:40.763
I've tried this a few times.

59
00:03:40.763 --> 00:03:46.106
Never in my history as a developer, unless
I was under duress, have I voluntarily

60
00:03:46.106 --> 00:03:51.153
gone and gotten changes from upstream and
lovingly ported them into my code.

61
00:03:51.153 --> 00:03:55.052
It's usually not possible because
your code, it diverges too much.

62
00:03:55.052 --> 00:04:00.292
With a theme though, a theme is an NPM
package, it's separate from your site.

63
00:04:00.292 --> 00:04:04.530
So if a theme gets updated upstream,
I can update the version of my theme.

64
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.427
And assuming the authors didn't
make any breaking changes,

65
00:04:07.427 --> 00:04:09.663
I just automatically
get those improvements.

66
00:04:09.663 --> 00:04:13.534
It's just like using Gatsby or
just like using any other NPM package.

67
00:04:13.534 --> 00:04:17.500
I do NPM install my theme at latest,
and boom, I got the changes.

68
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.101
So this is a great way
to keep things in sync.

69
00:04:20.101 --> 00:04:25.309
A really good example of this
in practice is if you look

70
00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:30.771
at the Apollo Graph QL Docs,
these are set up as themes.

71
00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:37.624
So if you look at the docs,
they have all of these different tools.

72
00:04:37.624 --> 00:04:41.624
And so each of these has its
doc's in a different place, and

73
00:04:41.624 --> 00:04:44.751
they're able to keep all
of the common stuff.

74
00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:49.079
The sidebar styling, the shared header,
the search functionality,

75
00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:51.037
all that lives in shared repos.

76
00:04:51.037 --> 00:04:53.572
But if we go and actually edit this.

77
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.842
We can see that this is the Apollo Docs.

78
00:04:58.842 --> 00:05:02.140
And then if I go to, let's go to React.

79
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.922
And I go to edit the React Docs,
this is in a different repo.

80
00:05:06.922 --> 00:05:11.213
So each of these is its own kind of thing,
they're separately maintained, but

81
00:05:11.213 --> 00:05:13.400
they all have this really unified feel.

82
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.795
And that's because Trevor Blades,
who's the developer who built this did

83
00:05:17.795 --> 00:05:21.720
a really great job of setting up
a series of sharable Gatsby themes.

84
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.560
So this is a really powerful approach
that you can take and use in your code.

85
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.920
So let's start that, right?

86
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.044
So the reason that we set up a mono repo
is to make this as easy as possible to

87
00:05:33.044 --> 00:05:33.672
get started.

88
00:05:33.672 --> 00:05:37.150
So I'm gonna create two
new files in a folder.

89
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.983
So our theme, I want it to be
called gatsby-theme-shared-nav.

90
00:05:41.983 --> 00:05:46.809
Now I could put this in a /packages
folder or a /themes folder whatever, but

91
00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:50.534
no benefit in over nesting here,
so I'm not gonna bother.

92
00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:55.350
So I'm gonna create a Gatsby config, and

93
00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.171
I'm also gonna create a package.json.

94
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:03.650
And so the Gatsby config,
all we need to start is nothing,

95
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.208
we're just gonna export an empty object.

96
00:06:06.208 --> 00:06:09.903
And the package JSON,
we're gonna set a few basic details.

97
00:06:09.903 --> 00:06:15.732
We wanna know name, and we're gonna
call it gatsby-theme-shared-nav.

98
00:06:15.732 --> 00:06:20.211
Again, we're in a mono repo which means
that whatever the folder name is,

99
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:24.690
if this is what yarn workspaces are gonna
use when we wanna start the theme or

100
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:25.920
install the theme.

101
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.722
So if these don't match,
that can be kinda confusing.

102
00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:32.116
So I would just say, if you don't
wanna call it gatsby-theme-shared-nav,

103
00:06:32.116 --> 00:06:32.783
that's fine.

104
00:06:32.783 --> 00:06:35.729
But call the folder and
the package the same thing, or

105
00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.642
you're gonna get real confused.

106
00:06:37.642 --> 00:06:39.362
Then we're gonna set a version.

107
00:06:39.362 --> 00:06:44.327
We're not gonna publish this today,
so the version is more just to keep

108
00:06:44.327 --> 00:06:48.318
NPM from yelling at us, and
then we're gonna set a main.

109
00:06:48.318 --> 00:06:53.677
And this is important, main will
default to index.js, but the main field

110
00:06:53.677 --> 00:06:59.226
is what node, and NPM, and yarn use to
determine whether a package is valid.

111
00:06:59.226 --> 00:07:03.444
So if you put in index.js and
there's no index.js in here,

112
00:07:03.444 --> 00:07:08.659
your theme will throw errors,
it'll say it's incorrectly configured,

113
00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:11.741
or no main export, or something like that.

114
00:07:11.741 --> 00:07:15.724
So you can, and a common practice
is create an index.js and

115
00:07:15.724 --> 00:07:20.361
just it's a no op, just put in
a comment that's nothing to see here.

116
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:23.829
And that's fine because then
your main can be index.js, or

117
00:07:23.829 --> 00:07:26.352
you can just change what
this main field is.

118
00:07:26.352 --> 00:07:29.277
And the last thing we're gonna do
is we're gonna set a license, and

119
00:07:29.277 --> 00:07:30.440
we'll call it MIT.

120
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.687
And so the reason that we set these fields
is to register this as a package and

121
00:07:35.687 --> 00:07:38.033
to prevent getting complaints.

122
00:07:38.033 --> 00:07:40.904
Like we don't want a notice that
our package is unlicensed or

123
00:07:40.904 --> 00:07:43.791
a notice that our version is invalid or
something like that.

124
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:48.445
Those can all cause problems and
just generally they cause.

125
00:07:48.445 --> 00:07:52.800
So, now that we've done that,
we can tell yarn to track this.

126
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.737
So I'm gonna come in here, and
I'm gonna say, gatsby-theme-shared-nav,

127
00:07:57.737 --> 00:07:59.853
cuz now I wanna track this folder.

128
00:07:59.853 --> 00:08:04.966
And if I come out here, and
I look at what's in our yarn workspaces,

129
00:08:04.966 --> 00:08:09.110
which you can do by doing yarn space info.

130
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.661
It's gonna show me two workspaces,
one is site.

131
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:13.091
Okay, that makes sense.

132
00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:16.835
And then gatsby-theme-shared-nav,
here's its location,

133
00:08:16.835 --> 00:08:18.950
and perfect, that's what we want.

134
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:24.452
So now that I've got that,
I'm going to add Gatsby to our theme.

135
00:08:24.452 --> 00:08:28.260
So yarn workspace gatsby, whoops.

136
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:33.088
gatsby-theme-shared-nav, and
you wanna add this as a peer dependency,

137
00:08:33.088 --> 00:08:36.133
because we don't want two
copies of Gatsby, but

138
00:08:36.133 --> 00:08:40.531
we do wanna make sure that Gatsby is
installed when you use this theme.

139
00:08:40.531 --> 00:08:43.358
So peer dependency is a way
to make that work, so

140
00:08:43.358 --> 00:08:45.492
the dash capital P is how we do that.

141
00:08:45.492 --> 00:08:50.308
And again, we're using yarn
workspace theme named add instead of

142
00:08:50.308 --> 00:08:54.780
like NMP install or yarn add,
because we want to make sure that

143
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.540
it shows up in this package JSON and
not this package JSON.

144
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.242
And that's how yarn
workspaces handle that.

145
00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:05.751
Okay, so we've installed, and

146
00:09:05.751 --> 00:09:10.062
now we're gonna install
the custom theme into our site.

147
00:09:10.062 --> 00:09:14.491
So, how we do that is we
get into our terminal, and

148
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:21.250
we're going to say yarn workspace
site add gatsby-theme-shared-nav.

149
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:26.176
And to get it to pick up the local theme,
we're gonna say @"*", and

150
00:09:26.176 --> 00:09:30.054
I'm using z shell which means
I have to quote that star.

151
00:09:30.054 --> 00:09:35.367
So @"*" is how we're gonna do this,
so I hit Enter.

152
00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:38.812
And instead of adding the remote theme,

153
00:09:38.812 --> 00:09:43.281
it links our dependencies and
gives us what we want.

154
00:09:43.281 --> 00:09:50.200
And then, I'm going to say,
yarn workspaces info again.

155
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.136
And now, you can see site and

156
00:09:52.136 --> 00:09:57.402
here workspace dependencies including
the gatsby-theme-shared-nav.

157
00:09:57.402 --> 00:09:59.703
So this is what we wanted,
this is what we were after.

158
00:09:59.703 --> 00:10:04.759
We have a site that is now using
the theme, and that theme is local for

159
00:10:04.759 --> 00:10:09.400
our development,
which is gonna make our lives really easy.

160
00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:16.915
So if we can start this right now but
honestly nothing will happen yet

161
00:10:16.915 --> 00:10:21.336
because it's an empty theme,
it's just kind of there.

162
00:10:21.336 --> 00:10:25.047
So let's not even bother cuz if I started
it, it would just start, we wouldn't even

163
00:10:25.047 --> 00:10:28.730
see that we installed the theme, it would
just be like, okay, your site started.
