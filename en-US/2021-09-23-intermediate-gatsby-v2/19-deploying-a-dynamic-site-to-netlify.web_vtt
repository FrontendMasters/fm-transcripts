1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.140
Why don't we go ahead and
build ourselves a deployable site?

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.276
So because this is a monorepo,
Gatsby sites by default,

3
00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:13.720
they're gonna build to
a folder called public.

4
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.110
This is what the build folder looks like.

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.430
And they've got this .cache folder which
needs to be kept around between sites.

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.187
And now we told Netlify to look
in the the netlify.toml here but

7
00:00:26.187 --> 00:00:30.421
once it looks in here,
it needs to find another

8
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:34.563
netlify.toml to tell
it what the rules are.

9
00:00:34.563 --> 00:00:37.384
I mean, we could go configure
this to the UI as well but

10
00:00:37.384 --> 00:00:41.400
if we're sending this to other people,
it's just easier to not make them do

11
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.270
the configuration manually when
we can commit it into the code.

12
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.870
So we wanna make sure that it
uses the right workspace command.

13
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.596
So we're gonna say yarn workspace
site build is our command instead of

14
00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:55.261
the autodetected Gatsby
build that we would get.

15
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:59.280
We're gonna set our publish
directory to public.

16
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.440
And because it's in this folder,
it's relative, right?

17
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.630
So if we close up source, we're in this
directory and we wanna get to public.

18
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.050
And then I also wanna make
sure this is a quirk that,

19
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.330
honestly, this is something that
I think Netlify needs to improve.

20
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.750
But right out of the gate,
we don't have a lock file in this folder.

21
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.420
The lock file is actually
outside of it in the top level.

22
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.620
So by default, Gatsby won't use yarn.

23
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.930
So I'm gonna tell it to use yarn by
setting an environment variable here.

24
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.737
And this is one way that you can
set an environment variable but

25
00:01:38.737 --> 00:01:43.560
as you can see, I don't know,
this doesn't scale, right?

26
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.610
Having to put a ton of these in,
that's not gonna fly forever, right?

27
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.550
So for one, okay fine,
all good, don't care.

28
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.430
But for multiple,
it's not gonna work very well.

29
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.257
The other thing that we're doing is we're
using these client-only routes where we

30
00:02:00.257 --> 00:02:01.760
want these catch balls.

31
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.070
And that means that there
are redirects being done.

32
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.500
And in order to get redirects to get
picked up properly, we need to install

33
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.080
a plugin that will sync those between
Gatsby and whatever host it's using.

34
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.323
So for netlify,
we will yarn workspace site add, and

35
00:02:18.323 --> 00:02:22.420
then we're gonna add
gatsby-plugin-netlify.

36
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.063
And this is going to make
the redirects work, and

37
00:02:25.063 --> 00:02:28.608
it adds some other stuff like
content security policy headers and

38
00:02:28.608 --> 00:02:32.620
iframe security and some things that
will help with your web speed score.

39
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.835
Once we've got that plugin,

40
00:02:35.835 --> 00:02:38.630
we can just toss it at
the bottom of our gatsby-config.

41
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.580
Doesn't need any options or anything.

42
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:48.840
So we'll put in gatsby-plugin-netlify,
okay?

43
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.647
And then we can just add all this stuff.

44
00:02:53.647 --> 00:02:58.080
So let's add everything git commit and

45
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.311
say, site ready to deploy.

46
00:03:04.127 --> 00:03:04.726
Let's push it.

47
00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.917
Okay, so what I'm gonna do is I
have to use this progress branch,

48
00:03:11.917 --> 00:03:16.359
which means I have to do
an extra step because by default,

49
00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.080
what netlify will do is
run off the main branch.

50
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.270
So I'm gonna do a netlify in it.

51
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.017
And actually, I wonder if it'll let
me set the branch, that will be cool.

52
00:03:28.276 --> 00:03:29.060
Nah, that's okay.

53
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.513
So let's do netlify in it and

54
00:03:32.513 --> 00:03:36.695
this is going to walk me
through setting up a new site.

55
00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:38.539
So I'm gonna create and
configure a new site.

56
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.010
And then I'm gonna choose my own team,
and I wanna give this a name.

57
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.850
So let's call it
frontend-masters-intermediate-gatsby.

58
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.819
That's already taken,
let's try another one.

59
00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.716
frontend-masters-intermediate-gatsby-proj-
ect.

60
00:04:03.795 --> 00:04:04.501
There we go.

61
00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:08.455
All right, so we already know that we've
got the base set to site and because it's

62
00:04:08.455 --> 00:04:13.165
leading our netlify.toml, well now it can
see it wants yarn workspace I build, good.

63
00:04:13.165 --> 00:04:15.181
It's pulling public, right.

64
00:04:15.181 --> 00:04:16.995
We can ignore that one.

65
00:04:16.995 --> 00:04:18.865
It needs the essential Gatsby plugin.

66
00:04:18.865 --> 00:04:20.595
This is gonna keep the cache around.

67
00:04:20.595 --> 00:04:23.695
It's gonna make Gatsby functions work,
it does a bunch of stuff like that.

68
00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:26.357
Theoretically, you could opt out of it but
I don't know why you would.

69
00:04:26.357 --> 00:04:31.687
So we will let that run and
then, we're off to the races.

70
00:04:31.687 --> 00:04:33.707
So let's open this.

71
00:04:33.707 --> 00:04:38.335
And what I have to do is because I,
see it open in the wrong browser,

72
00:04:38.335 --> 00:04:41.367
let's pull it on to this one.

73
00:04:41.367 --> 00:04:46.216
Because I changed my branch, I'm just
gonna jump into the site settings and

74
00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:47.137
go to Deploy.

75
00:04:47.137 --> 00:04:50.033
Let me make this a little bit bigger so
it's easier to read, and

76
00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:51.298
then go to Build &amp; deploy.

77
00:04:51.298 --> 00:04:53.290
And then I'm gonna change the branch.

78
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.820
And I'm just gonna build this progress
branch that we've been using.

79
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.600
So let me save that,
head out to my deploys.

80
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.080
You don't need to finish that one,
so we can cancel it.

81
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.100
And then I'm gonna go to here and
let's just start again.

82
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.180
So I'm gonna deploy the site.

83
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.582
All right, so here we go.

84
00:05:10.582 --> 00:05:15.654
We're deploying the sit and
this is going to install Node.

85
00:05:15.654 --> 00:05:19.898
It's gonna install all of our packages,
yarn, all the things that we need and

86
00:05:19.898 --> 00:05:22.680
then it's gonna run our
yarn workspaces command.

87
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.616
It'll also compile our functions and
store the cache and

88
00:05:26.616 --> 00:05:30.634
all the stuff that we don't
wanna have to do ourselves, so

89
00:05:30.634 --> 00:05:35.390
that we can just move on with our day and
be happy about having deployed

90
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.756
a site instead of thinking about
how to get that site deployed.

91
00:05:47.025 --> 00:05:50.431
And this will take usually about two
minutes the first time around, and

92
00:05:50.431 --> 00:05:53.235
then it'll drop down to about
a minute on repeat deploys.

93
00:06:00.097 --> 00:06:05.099
The thing about Gatsby is that
it's a really large NPM package,

94
00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:09.375
but we don't ship most of
that to production, right?

95
00:06:09.375 --> 00:06:11.140
Gatsby is a build tool.

96
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.270
So it pulls in a ton of stuff for
building sites.

97
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.876
And then the vast majority of
that is only used for the build,

98
00:06:18.876 --> 00:06:23.600
it doesn't actually get used in
production on the client site.

99
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.145
So it's important to look at not just
the package size because that can be

100
00:06:28.145 --> 00:06:29.380
misleading.

101
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:35.268
It's important to look at what actually
comes out of the production build,

102
00:06:35.268 --> 00:06:41.350
cuz a very small package can produce
huge bundle sizes if it's not optimized.

103
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.402
And vice versa,

104
00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:47.150
huge package that's optimized well
can create some pretty tiny bundles.

105
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.120
Okay, so we're running the build,
you can see it's installing this plugin.

106
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.090
It doesn't have a Gatsby cache cuz this is
the first time we're building the site.

107
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.400
It's running that yarn workspace
site build, that's what we wanted.

108
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:07.310
So off to the races we go, and
this will just take a few more seconds.

109
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.730
And then once this finishes,
netlify will bundle the functions,

110
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.388
push all these pages up to the CDN and
then we will be live.

111
00:07:17.388 --> 00:07:18.806
There we go.

112
00:07:18.806 --> 00:07:20.722
Function's bundling, that's done.

113
00:07:20.722 --> 00:07:26.518
It's deploying the site, that goes and
then got ourselves a site.

114
00:07:26.518 --> 00:07:28.215
So we can go look at this now.

115
00:07:28.215 --> 00:07:31.764
We've got our site up on the Internet,
we can go to our Books,

116
00:07:31.764 --> 00:07:34.720
we can go to our Authors,
we can go to the accounts.

117
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.869
And we go.

118
00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:41.510
If we log in, great, log out, great.

119
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.950
All the things that we wanna do, right?

120
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.210
It's all doing what we want, and
we've got our optimized images.

121
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.070
So this is pretty slick.

122
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.990
It's doing what we want.

123
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:56.272
I'm happy with this, we're able
to get it up pretty quickly, and

124
00:07:56.272 --> 00:07:59.840
it's fairly painless to get this up and
running.

125
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.100
And now any changes that we make will
also automatically build and deploy.
