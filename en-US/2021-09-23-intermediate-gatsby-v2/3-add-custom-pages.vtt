1
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.587
Now that we've got our development
environment, we've got a monorepo,

2
00:00:03.587 --> 00:00:05.580
let's dig in and
start just making some stuff.

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.311
So the first thing I wanna do is I
want to build a custom page, and

4
00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:13.090
I wanna do this without using files.

5
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.310
Instead, I want to use the node APIs.

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.672
So Gatsby has this concept of node APIs,
where during the build process,

7
00:00:22.672 --> 00:00:26.920
it will expose hooks into
different parts of the process.

8
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.450
So there's a create pages API,
a source nodes API.

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.450
We're gonna look into how we can use
those to customize our Gatsby site.

10
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.060
So the first one we're gonna
look at is called create pages.

11
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.803
And the way that this works is
we are going to create a new

12
00:00:41.803 --> 00:00:45.735
file at the root called
gatsby-node dot js.

13
00:00:45.735 --> 00:00:50.540
And inside of this, we can export
any number of hooks that we want to.

14
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.810
And so the one that we're actually
looking at first is createPages.

15
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.970
So exports dot createPages.

16
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.064
Now, remember this is node,
so it needs to be done, or

17
00:01:01.064 --> 00:01:04.540
let me turn off Copilot so
it doesn't, yeah.

18
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.725
Copilot gets really confusing if I'm
trying to do one thing, and it's helping.

19
00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:16.100
So in here, we've got the ability
to export a function.

20
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.577
And whatever we do in this
function will get run as part

21
00:01:19.577 --> 00:01:23.069
of the create pages step of
the Gatsby build process.

22
00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.790
And for us,
we just wanna create our first page.

23
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.800
So let's pull out of the actions
the createPage action.

24
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.530
And this is an object that gets
passed in with various helpers.

25
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.830
We'll use a handful of
these throughout the day.

26
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.440
I'll go into what the ones we use are,
but know that's not an exhaustive list.

27
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.207
There's more stuff you can
do with the Gatsby API's.

28
00:01:49.207 --> 00:01:54.250
I'm gonna do the ones that
are most practically useful.

29
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.794
Some of them get a little esoteric,
you can get into changing the Webpack and

30
00:01:58.794 --> 00:02:01.928
Babel config,
which I would recommend you don't.

31
00:02:01.928 --> 00:02:05.100
[LAUGH] I mean you can do whatever
you want, but it's gonna.

32
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.820
Anytime you get into the internals,
you're probably gonna have a bad time,

33
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.800
unless you've got a very,
very good reason for doing so.

34
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.995
So the way the createPage API works
is we're gonna pass it an object.

35
00:02:16.995 --> 00:02:19.780
And createPage requires three things.

36
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.710
The first thing is a path.

37
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.180
The second thing is a component.

38
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.390
And the third thing is optional,
which is context.

39
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.010
So let's actually leave context out for
now.

40
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.108
So a component is gonna actually look for
a file,

41
00:02:36.108 --> 00:02:39.970
a react component that we
can use to render this page.

42
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.650
So we need to build that.

43
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.438
So before we save this file,
let's actually go in here, and

44
00:02:45.438 --> 00:02:47.090
let's make ourselves a template.

45
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.920
So I'm gonna create
a folder called templates.

46
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.044
If I can spell it, templates.

47
00:02:54.044 --> 00:02:56.890
And we'll call this one custom dot js.

48
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.537
This is gonna be more of
a proof of concept page.

49
00:02:59.537 --> 00:03:02.940
And inside of it, let's make
a pretty standard react component.

50
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.420
We're gonna import everything as React.

51
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.217
From React, this is a workaround for
React 17, not requiring the global

52
00:03:11.217 --> 00:03:16.380
React import anymore but
Gatsby not having implemented that yet.

53
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.828
So you have to pull in the whole library.

54
00:03:18.828 --> 00:03:24.900
And then we're going to export
default function CustomPage.

55
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.190
And inside of it, we can add some,
let's leave that part out actually.

56
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.850
We'll get to that in a minute.

57
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.240
So let's return, just a basic div.

58
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.765
And inside of it, we can say, Custom Page.

59
00:03:45.326 --> 00:03:48.020
All right, so now that we've got that,
we can load this in.

60
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.645
So we're gonna use require dot resolve,

61
00:03:50.645 --> 00:03:54.026
which is a way to get
the absolute path to a component.

62
00:03:54.026 --> 00:03:58.772
And we're gonna use the templates
custom dot js that we just created.

63
00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:01.421
And I'm gonna set this
at a path of custom.

64
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:03.990
So the path is just whatever
we want it to be on the site.

65
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.350
So slash custom will be my
site dot com slash custom.

66
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.965
And now that I've done that,
if we stop and restart,

67
00:04:12.965 --> 00:04:17.580
because we just added a new process,
we will see, and

68
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.345
we can look at the stages in here as
well as this builds as it starts.

69
00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:30.209
So there's these hooks here onPreInit,
and onPreBootstrap, and

70
00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:34.497
createSchemaCustomization, and
there's createPages.

71
00:04:34.497 --> 00:04:39.420
So when we ran createPages,
Gatsby picked up our changes.

72
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.960
And now, if we go in here and look,
we can go to our custom page.

73
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.490
And there it is.

74
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.200
So this is a really powerful workflow,
right?

75
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.558
It lets us do a lot.

76
00:04:48.558 --> 00:04:54.328
But it's not particularly useful right
now because this way, what's the benefit

77
00:04:54.328 --> 00:04:59.290
of doing this versus just creating
a page called custom dot js, right?

78
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.950
There's no real benefit here.

79
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.616
So where the createPage starts to
become extremely interesting is

80
00:05:05.616 --> 00:05:07.960
when we start including context.

81
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.180
So with context,
we can just pass in any object.

82
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.990
And whatever we pass here is gonna be
made available to our Gatsby site.

83
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.832
So I'm gonna keep this pretty simple.

84
00:05:17.832 --> 00:05:20.350
Let's do a custom page.

85
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.130
And then we'll add some meta stuff.

86
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.460
So we'll do a description.

87
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.820
And inside that, we can say,
a custom page with context.

88
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.120
And That's probably good enough, right?

89
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.390
And then let's change this out
before we restart that thing.

90
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.762
So anything that we pass in context
is gonna be available in this prop

91
00:05:43.762 --> 00:05:46.680
pass to the page called pageContext.

92
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.382
And so in here, if we look at it,

93
00:05:50.382 --> 00:05:55.060
we can now use this to just set things up.

94
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.260
So remember we had that title.

95
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.490
So let's just grab that title,
and use it as our page title.

96
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.382
And then for the sake of brevity,
since this is just

97
00:06:03.382 --> 00:06:07.015
to demonstrate the concept before
we go deeper, I'm just gonna

98
00:06:07.015 --> 00:06:12.390
dump everything else in pageContext into
a pretext so we can see what's in there.

99
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.777
So let's save that, let's come out here,
and let's restart that browser.

100
00:06:19.455 --> 00:06:20.515
Looks like it didn't do it.

101
00:06:20.515 --> 00:06:22.535
So I'm gonna stop and restart it manually.

102
00:06:24.295 --> 00:06:28.147
This is one of the things that can get
a little tedious with doing more advanced

103
00:06:28.147 --> 00:06:32.294
Gatsby stuff, is when you start messing
with the config files, with Gatsby node,

104
00:06:32.294 --> 00:06:36.522
and some of the other ones, you'll end up
stopping and restarting the server a lot.

105
00:06:36.522 --> 00:06:39.789
So when you've got good reason to do it,
absolutely, you should do it.

106
00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:46.740
When you, just don't opt in, voluntary
suffering is my least favorite kind.

107
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.844
So do as little as you have to,
that's a motto.

108
00:06:52.742 --> 00:06:54.590
Let's take a look at this.

109
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.544
So basically, what we did here is
we passed in this context, and

110
00:06:58.544 --> 00:07:03.158
everything that we passed in,
this gets passed directly as pageContext,

111
00:07:03.158 --> 00:07:05.445
which we can see looking at the site.

112
00:07:05.445 --> 00:07:08.509
Cuz this is what got dumped out
of that pageContext variable.

113
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.967
This is a really handy way
to pass in information, and

114
00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:17.922
theoretically speaking, you could build
your whole Gatsby site without ever

115
00:07:17.922 --> 00:07:22.143
looking at the GraphQL layer by
just passing in context like this.

116
00:07:22.143 --> 00:07:25.401
You could load things
from a third party API,

117
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:28.488
drop it into this custom page context, and

118
00:07:28.488 --> 00:07:33.655
then use that to set up your titles and
your blog role and all that stuff.

119
00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:39.179
It is fairly useful, but as you get
into more and more complex pages,

120
00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:41.507
it can get pretty challenging.

121
00:07:41.507 --> 00:07:46.429
So, we'll look at a way to make this
a little bit better as we get into some of

122
00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:51.040
the custom data, and see a more
useful pattern for using context, and

123
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.917
how we can kind of level that
up to make things easier.

124
00:07:54.917 --> 00:07:59.332
The other thing that I don't like
is that if we use this approach,

125
00:07:59.332 --> 00:08:01.580
where all the data is in context,

126
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:07.080
then I don't actually know what's here
until I go and look at Gatsby node.

127
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:11.266
So there's a little bit of hopping between
files to figure out what's available to me

128
00:08:11.266 --> 00:08:12.220
to use it.

129
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.513
And I kind of prefer the the GraphQL way,

130
00:08:14.513 --> 00:08:19.420
where the query that shows me what data
is in the file is just right up above.

131
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:26.620
So this is baby steps with createPage,
but let's go a little bit further here.
