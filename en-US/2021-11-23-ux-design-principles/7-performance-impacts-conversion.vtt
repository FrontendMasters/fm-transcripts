WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.099
And actually,

2
00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:04.835
this isn't just about the content you add
to your website if you wanna build trust.

3
00:00:04.835 --> 00:00:07.491
It's also about your design as well,

4
00:00:07.491 --> 00:00:13.510
your design can have a big impact on
whether your site is being trusted or not.

5
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.192
And I'm gonna talk about this a lot
more when we talk about design.

6
00:00:16.192 --> 00:00:21.227
But basically, we can very easily
associate certain design as

7
00:00:21.227 --> 00:00:26.420
being trustworthy and
other design as being untrustworthy.

8
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.690
And actually,
it's something you need to test for.

9
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.355
And you need to put your design
in front of people and go,

10
00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:33.710
do you find this trustworthy?

11
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.650
So, yeah, that's a little bit
about how to build trust.

12
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.684
Now the fourth psychological pillar we're
gonna talk about, I know that a lot of

13
00:00:44.684 --> 00:00:48.008
the people watching this would
class themselves as developers and

14
00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:50.250
not designers or content people.

15
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.720
And I know I'm taking out of your comfort
zone and making you look up all kinds of

16
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.855
things that maybe you're not quite so
familiar with.

17
00:00:57.855 --> 00:01:02.020
But this last one, you're gonna
love cuz it's all about speed,

18
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.997
it's all about performance.

19
00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:10.520
Because actually, we are incredibly
impatient more so than ever before.

20
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.492
And so performance is one of the most
important things that we can

21
00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:17.620
do to improve conversion.

22
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.368
And there's been loads of
research done into this, right?

23
00:01:20.368 --> 00:01:23.940
For every 2 seconds of
load time on a website,

24
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.060
you're gonna see a 4.3% loss
in revenue per visitor.

25
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:36.139
You're gonna see a 3.8% reduction in
clicks and a 1.8% drop off in inquiries.

26
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.520
Performance makes an enormous difference.

27
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.744
So next time you're dealing with
a designer who wants a video

28
00:01:42.744 --> 00:01:44.320
background, right?

29
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.097
Click them around the head and

30
00:01:46.097 --> 00:01:50.730
tell them that performance matters
more than their stupid graphic, right?

31
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.666
What next time you've got a designer
that wants to use 20 different forms,

32
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:56.517
shut them down.

33
00:01:56.517 --> 00:02:04.671
Stop them doing it cuz they're undermining
performance and people are so impatient.

34
00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:07.992
And performance impacts
repeat visits as well,

35
00:02:07.992 --> 00:02:11.680
79% of shoppers won't return to slow site.

36
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.775
It also affects whether they're willing
to recommend a product or service, right?

37
00:02:15.775 --> 00:02:19.175
44% of shoppers will share if
they have a bad experience or

38
00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:22.250
their sites really shut slow,
don't bother with it.

39
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.650
So we need to be improving performance
as much as we possibly can.

40
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.020
So how can we do that?

41
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.502
Well, I've kind of indicated
a few things in my rants, but

42
00:02:34.502 --> 00:02:38.080
here's a few more to kind
of throw into the mix.

43
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.290
Imagery is a huge one, right?

44
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.226
Serving the right images
at the right time and

45
00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:47.360
at the right size is critical to success.

46
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.660
So I would highly recommend that you
use a service like servesiv.com,

47
00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.650
which basically just because the trouble
is we know what happens, right?

48
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.666
You let a client or a stakeholder at
the content management system and

49
00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:11.043
they upload some enormous ass PNG or
TIFF, some ridiculous resolution.

50
00:03:11.043 --> 00:03:14.890
And obviously, all of that needs to be
resized and they don't follow the rules.

51
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.510
So a service like Serve, basically,
they upload it at a massive size.

52
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.530
And then you can pull it back
at whatever dimensions you want.

53
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.890
And it basically, compresses and
serves the image on the fly.

54
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.250
It's really, really great.

55
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.330
So it's not the only one.

56
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.767
There are a number of them, and no,
I'm not getting paid commission by them,

57
00:03:33.767 --> 00:03:34.560
unfortunately.

58
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.590
So something like that works really well
and also serving the right file format.

59
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.550
And again,
server will do this automatically.

60
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.390
So if you can serve a web p file or
whatever.

61
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.350
So speed up your imagery, make sure
you're serving at the right resolution.

62
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.126
There's also I think about
the perception of speed as well,

63
00:03:56.126 --> 00:03:58.850
not just the reality of speed.

64
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.753
So don't just go and
run this through Google page speed test,

65
00:04:02.753 --> 00:04:05.530
because that will give you the numbers,
but

66
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.400
won't necessarily give you
the feel of using a website.

67
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.197
So images get great example of this.

68
00:04:11.197 --> 00:04:13.711
Lacy load images,
load up the rest of the page, and

69
00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:16.410
then bring the images in afterwards.

70
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.053
Because it will give a perception that the
site is loading faster than actually is.

71
00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:26.412
That's gone wrong,

72
00:04:26.412 --> 00:04:30.290
yes, on my slide.

73
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.910
Sorry about that.

74
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.020
It should say use a content
delivery network, okay?

75
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.255
So, yeah, make sure that your
website has been served from

76
00:04:38.255 --> 00:04:40.395
multiple locations around the world.

77
00:04:40.395 --> 00:04:43.170
Hopefully, if you guys
got developer background,

78
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.828
this is something that
you're doing a standard.

79
00:04:45.828 --> 00:04:49.686
I know sometimes, clients are reluctant to
pay for this color, kind of functionality,

80
00:04:49.686 --> 00:04:52.836
stakeholders are reluctant to do it,
there may be complications in it.

81
00:04:52.836 --> 00:04:57.673
But when you can tie it back to the impact
that it's having on conversion,

82
00:04:57.673 --> 00:05:02.762
you'll find that they start to pay a lot
more attention to this kind of thing.

83
00:05:02.762 --> 00:05:07.435
So, for example, you can actually
calculate the amount that it's costing

84
00:05:07.435 --> 00:05:10.510
them not having a content
delivery network.

85
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.247
And then what you can do is effectively
work out how many additional

86
00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:18.900
seconds it's taking to load because
there's no content delivery network.

87
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.600
Then from that, you know that you're
gonna get a 4.8% reduction in revenue.

88
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.485
And then work out what your revenue is and

89
00:05:26.485 --> 00:05:29.431
you can get a guesstimate how
much it's costing the business.

90
00:05:29.431 --> 00:05:32.623
You'll be amazed how quickly
people then turn around and

91
00:05:32.623 --> 00:05:37.014
say they're willing to spend a bit of
money on tech when they realize that it's

92
00:05:37.014 --> 00:05:39.694
actually undermining
their conversion rate.

93
00:05:39.694 --> 00:05:43.597
And then obviously, we need to do things
like optimize our CSS and JavaScript.

94
00:05:43.597 --> 00:05:48.811
And increasingly, we're building our
websites on top of frameworks and

95
00:05:48.811 --> 00:05:55.500
systems like React and stuff like that,
and, yeah, these are incredibly powerful.

96
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.870
Yeah, they have their place.

97
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.457
Yeah, they make your life easier maybe but
often,

98
00:06:01.457 --> 00:06:06.190
they are a sledgehammer to crack a nut,
as a phrase we have over here.

99
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.520
In other words, they're overkill.

100
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.662
And for a lot of websites, you shouldn't
be using these kinds of frameworks because

101
00:06:12.662 --> 00:06:16.820
the amount of JavaScript that's
required is actually fairly minimal.

102
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.449
And we should be minimizing our code,
minimizing our use of JavaScript,

103
00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:23.615
minimizing our use of framework,

104
00:06:23.615 --> 00:06:27.030
because it will have
performance benefits doing so.

105
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.250
And this applies to all kinds of
JavaScript that we use on our websites,

106
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.906
aren't strictly necessary
in order to deliver.

107
00:06:35.906 --> 00:06:40.832
Not only is JavaScript additional
downloads have to be made,

108
00:06:40.832 --> 00:06:45.007
additional calls to the server
that have to be made.

109
00:06:45.007 --> 00:06:49.806
They also have the problem of they
can cause performance issues on

110
00:06:49.806 --> 00:06:53.470
slower browsers, cause browsers to crash.

111
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.840
We overly use JavaScript in
my humble opinion these days.

112
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.850
You can write the hate in the comments,
I'm sure it will come.

113
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.850
And then there's finally
watch those web fonts.

114
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.060
Remember I was talking about for
designers.

115
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.691
Designers love to include
lots of different fonts, and

116
00:07:13.691 --> 00:07:16.270
those fonts are a killer.

117
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.962
Fonts can be huge, so bully your
designers, or if you do design yourself,

118
00:07:20.962 --> 00:07:23.132
really show restraint over this.

119
00:07:23.132 --> 00:07:27.526
Because it will have a big impact on
your conversion rate if you start

120
00:07:27.526 --> 00:07:29.810
downloading these big fonts.

121
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.735
Also when you do low fonts, make sure
designers won't like that flash you

122
00:07:33.735 --> 00:07:37.916
get where you delay the loading of the web
font until the whole pages appeared so

123
00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:40.410
you'll get it in a default
font to begin with.

124
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.437
But actually, you should be doing that
wherever possible because it means that

125
00:07:44.437 --> 00:07:45.990
the page loads quicker.

126
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.600
Users feel more of a perception of speed.

127
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:54.040
So get a default font in there then
bring your web fonts in afterwards.

128
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.437
Use variable fonts where you
can as well because obviously,

129
00:07:57.437 --> 00:08:00.180
that they're much smaller font sizes.

130
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.320
Now the one I throw in a dodge just
sort of off the top of my head.

131
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.290
Get rid of those social media icons.

132
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:10.180
The marketing team always likes
to use these social media icons.

133
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.280
These social media icons are a bugger for
performance.

134
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.146
They really do undermine
the performance of your website and

135
00:08:17.146 --> 00:08:18.910
cause all kinds of problems.

136
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.460
Hardly anybody uses them.

137
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:24.290
If you look at your analytics,
nobody will be using them anyway.

138
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.686
And he's ruining your conversion rate so

139
00:08:26.686 --> 00:08:31.616
really that's a good argument to go back
to your marketing people, is to say, look,

140
00:08:31.616 --> 00:08:35.120
this is undermining conversion and
so we need to avoid this.
