1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.981
So with that in mind, let's get back
into the topic of our content and

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:07.021
the creation of our content.

3
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:11.216
As you may remember,
we were talking about content blocks and

4
00:00:11.216 --> 00:00:16.230
that every content block is gonna
have a heading, a smooth description.

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.823
Normally in my experience,
about 160 characters, something like that.

6
00:00:20.823 --> 00:00:22.794
So quite short and snappy.

7
00:00:22.794 --> 00:00:27.660
An optional link to more information
if you want it and an option or

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.876
image if it's appropriate.

9
00:00:29.876 --> 00:00:33.163
Now the question is,
how do you write a good heading?

10
00:00:33.163 --> 00:00:35.542
How do you write a good description?

11
00:00:35.542 --> 00:00:38.680
And that is as much an art as a science,
if I'm honest.

12
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.116
And it's something that only
comes with practice and

13
00:00:42.116 --> 00:00:46.173
with testing in order to work
out what works and what doesn't.

14
00:00:46.173 --> 00:00:51.566
But there are some advice that I can give
you about creating good headings and

15
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:56.463
good body copy, and some tools that
might potentially help as well.

16
00:00:56.463 --> 00:01:01.209
So let's talk about creating
compelling headlines.

17
00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:06.568
One of the tools that I use to kind
of help me think about the structure

18
00:01:06.568 --> 00:01:10.909
of my headlines is CoSchedule's
headline analyzer.

19
00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.889
If you do a quick Google on CoSchedule and
headline analyzer,

20
00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:20.122
it will come back and
you can try it out for yourself.

21
00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:23.942
It's a free tool,
at least to try out initially.

22
00:01:23.942 --> 00:01:29.286
Now, I'm not saying that you should
use this as the ultimate tool for

23
00:01:29.286 --> 00:01:33.263
creating headlines, but
it's rather guidance.

24
00:01:33.263 --> 00:01:36.448
It gets you thinking in
the right kind of ways.

25
00:01:36.448 --> 00:01:41.076
And what it does is effectively
analyze a variety of different factors

26
00:01:41.076 --> 00:01:44.379
associated with the headline
you're creating.

27
00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:48.082
And it will then incorporate that and
take that data and

28
00:01:48.082 --> 00:01:51.800
turn it into a score, so
it will score your headlines.

29
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.747
Now the score is only limited use really.

30
00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:59.989
But what it does is it breaks down how
it went about producing that score.

31
00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:04.109
It will talk about things like
the kinds of words you use.

32
00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:07.494
The kinds of style of headline it was.

33
00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:09.629
The kind of length of it.

34
00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.582
It's scanability.

35
00:02:10.582 --> 00:02:15.318
All these different factors that kind of
help shape your headlines and create them.

36
00:02:15.318 --> 00:02:19.785
So, for example,
if you wanna create a compelling headline,

37
00:02:19.785 --> 00:02:23.411
you wanna use some emotional words or
power words,

38
00:02:23.411 --> 00:02:29.583
which are a particular wordings that tends
to gain people's attention and interest.

39
00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:30.738
So for example,

40
00:02:30.738 --> 00:02:35.944
something like success is a word that
tends to kind of grab us and pull us in.

41
00:02:35.944 --> 00:02:38.317
It also looks at things like sentiment.

42
00:02:38.317 --> 00:02:40.507
Do you wanna go negative in
the way that you're speaking?

43
00:02:40.507 --> 00:02:42.727
Or do you wanna remain positive?

44
00:02:42.727 --> 00:02:46.920
I generally heavily favor positive
headlines because when you

45
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.429
start looking at negative headlines,
again, you start to more and

46
00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:54.292
more move into the world of dark patterns.

47
00:02:54.292 --> 00:02:58.682
So by way of example, let's look
at some different headline types.

48
00:02:58.682 --> 00:03:00.208
You can use fear, right?

49
00:03:00.208 --> 00:03:03.270
You can talk about not
getting left behind.

50
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.766
But then again, what we're doing is,
we're using negative factors and

51
00:03:09.766 --> 00:03:13.643
connotations in order to motivate people,

52
00:03:13.643 --> 00:03:17.430
which almost always backfires and is bad.

53
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.110
I always look in my copy to build
people up, but not to pull them down.

54
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.508
So another example which goes back to
the whole conversation we were having

55
00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:33.403
about the dieting app that I
mentioned earlier, is guilt, right?

56
00:03:33.403 --> 00:03:37.621
A lot of people write headlines
that use guilt in order to

57
00:03:37.621 --> 00:03:40.510
encourage people to make decisions.

58
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.970
And all of these kinds of approaches
are not really very uplifting.

59
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.321
They're not building up the user.

60
00:03:48.321 --> 00:03:51.732
They're not creating
a positive brand impression.

61
00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:54.234
And in my opinion, should be avoided.

62
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:58.443
Yes they will provide short
term conversion boosts, but

63
00:03:58.443 --> 00:04:01.950
the health of the long
term brand reputation and

64
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.730
just customer satisfaction and
things like that.

65
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.228
But there are headlines
you can use that have got

66
00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:13.264
emotional weight to them
that are much more positive.

67
00:04:13.264 --> 00:04:14.198
Trust, right?

68
00:04:14.198 --> 00:04:17.241
Headlines that talk
about no hidden costs or

69
00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:21.282
really emphasize how you're
trustworthy and reliable.

70
00:04:21.282 --> 00:04:25.251
Get trusted by big brands such as,
those kinds of things.

71
00:04:25.251 --> 00:04:30.825
That's much more positive in its tone and
tends to resonate with people much better.

72
00:04:30.825 --> 00:04:33.465
Then there are ones that focus on value.

73
00:04:33.465 --> 00:04:35.969
You won't find a better deal anywhere.

74
00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:40.903
So people like the idea that they're
getting value from the transaction in

75
00:04:40.903 --> 00:04:42.166
the interaction.

76
00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:45.869
You've got headlines that
talk about the competition.

77
00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:51.413
Again, this one's a bit of a gray one
because you can play this in a fun way,

78
00:04:51.413 --> 00:04:55.818
like be the envy of your neighbors,
quite tongue in cheek.

79
00:04:55.818 --> 00:04:58.766
But also, it could quite easily
turn negative if you let it.

80
00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:02.085
So you've gotta be a little
bit careful with that.

81
00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:05.539
Gonna have headlines that
emphasize senses of belonging,

82
00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:09.002
join today to find out what
people have been talking about.

83
00:05:09.002 --> 00:05:14.124
So the idea of community and belonging,
which is a big motivator for people.

84
00:05:14.124 --> 00:05:17.603
Instant rewards,
everybody loves an instant reward.

85
00:05:17.603 --> 00:05:22.220
So speak to us today for instant
peace of mind or to instant access or

86
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.626
that kind of thing.

87
00:05:23.626 --> 00:05:27.750
Can have headings that talk about
build you up as a leader or

88
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.536
as an innovator or as an early adopter.

89
00:05:30.536 --> 00:05:34.561
Those kinds of things,
which resonates with certain groups.

90
00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:38.430
And then you can talk about time,
saving people time.

91
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.484
Time is, so
when I was talking about performance,

92
00:05:41.484 --> 00:05:43.834
I was saying how impatient people are.

93
00:05:43.834 --> 00:05:46.881
And it's because people
value their time these days.

94
00:05:46.881 --> 00:05:52.870
When you're writing a value proposition or
anything like that, if you emphasize

95
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.276
that you can save people time,
they tend to respond extremely well to it.

96
00:05:58.276 --> 00:06:04.691
Those are just a random set of examples to
kinda get you thinking as you write your

97
00:06:04.691 --> 00:06:10.453
copy, to provide some kind of emotional
content behind there as well.

98
00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:13.990
Now again,
you have to find the balance here.

99
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.893
Find what is right for your audience.

100
00:06:16.893 --> 00:06:23.767
So things like AB testing work really well
on headlines to find out what resonates.

101
00:06:23.767 --> 00:06:26.385
Because we don't wanna annoy people.

102
00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:30.677
We don't want to make them feel
manipulated or out of place.

103
00:06:30.677 --> 00:06:33.646
So for example,
very hugely my audience for

104
00:06:33.646 --> 00:06:39.032
example on my own website are very
digitally savvy, they're very tech savvy.

105
00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:42.410
And to be honest,
they're very cynical, right?

106
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.782
And so I have to really be careful
not to push these kinds of,

107
00:06:46.782 --> 00:06:52.123
rely too heavily on emotion because
it actually alienates my audience.

108
00:06:52.123 --> 00:06:55.929
But with a different audience,
that's what they want.

109
00:06:55.929 --> 00:07:02.310
They want to feel engaged and listened to
and have an emotional connection there.

110
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.655
That's why user research is so important.

111
00:07:05.655 --> 00:07:10.110
But let's talk about some practicalities,
to move away a little bit from the kind of

112
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.892
marketing side of content to some of
the more practical side of things.

113
00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:17.601
For a start,
let's talk about content scannability.

114
00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:19.709
As we've already said, right?

115
00:07:19.709 --> 00:07:23.531
Most people do not read your copy,
they scan it.

116
00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:26.373
And so we wanna facilitate that and
enable that and

117
00:07:26.373 --> 00:07:28.887
make our content as scannable as possible.

118
00:07:28.887 --> 00:07:31.610
And there are essentially
two ways we can do this.

119
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:38.509
One is how we structure our content and
the other is how we write our content.

120
00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:43.392
I'll come to structure in a little bit,
but let's talk about writing your content.

121
00:07:43.392 --> 00:07:44.179
Writing for

122
00:07:44.179 --> 00:07:49.461
the web is different because people
are just scanning through it very quickly.

123
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:53.635
And that means that it needs
to be incredibly simple and

124
00:07:53.635 --> 00:07:55.730
very easy to scan through.

125
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.393
And there are certain things
we can do to achieve that.

126
00:07:58.393 --> 00:08:04.227
So for example, we can avoid using
jargon or unfamiliar terminology.

127
00:08:04.227 --> 00:08:07.988
But we can also use shorter
sentence structures.

128
00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:12.658
And we can avoid too many adverbs and
things like that.

129
00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:17.337
Now if like me, you're not particularly
good at doing that kind of stuff

130
00:08:17.337 --> 00:08:22.720
naturally, then instead what you can do
is, you can use a tool like Hemingway app.

131
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.024
And Hemingway app is a free
online tool that you can use.

132
00:08:26.024 --> 00:08:28.906
You enter your content into it,
it scans it.

133
00:08:28.906 --> 00:08:32.682
It makes suggestions about how you
can shorten it and improve it and

134
00:08:32.682 --> 00:08:34.107
make it more scannable.

135
00:08:34.107 --> 00:08:36.995
It'll also give you
a readability level and

136
00:08:36.995 --> 00:08:39.736
tell you whether that is good or not good.

137
00:08:39.736 --> 00:08:43.528
So it's a really good sanity checker for
the copy that you write.

138
00:08:43.528 --> 00:08:48.492
And there are other tools out there like
that for example, I use Grammarly a lot.

139
00:08:48.492 --> 00:08:52.724
But what I like about Hemingway app
is that it's very much designed for

140
00:08:52.724 --> 00:08:53.950
reading on the web.

141
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.764
It's quite aggressive
in its suggestions and

142
00:08:56.764 --> 00:09:01.532
quite unforgiving about things like
long sentences or lots of conjunctions.

143
00:09:01.532 --> 00:09:04.479
So lots of ands and
commas and things like that.

144
00:09:04.479 --> 00:09:07.740
So just run your draft
copy through that and

145
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:13.281
you'll find that it'll become a lot
more scannable and easy to digest.

146
00:09:13.281 --> 00:09:18.650
But it's not just about writing in plain
language and being as concise as possible.

147
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:23.146
It's also about how we then
structure that information.

148
00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:28.077
There's a lot of usability
experts that will tell you

149
00:09:28.077 --> 00:09:31.700
that your copy has to be short, right?

150
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.631
And that isn't strictly true, okay?

151
00:09:34.631 --> 00:09:40.890
It has to be concise, but
that's two different things, right?

152
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:46.042
Concise is,
it's got to be as short as it can be and

153
00:09:46.042 --> 00:09:49.007
still get the point across.

154
00:09:49.007 --> 00:09:53.602
And sometimes you need more words
to be able to explain something.

155
00:09:53.602 --> 00:09:56.272
Is just the nature of the beast, right?

156
00:09:56.272 --> 00:09:58.730
And so don't be afraid to do that.

157
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:02.825
But what you need to avoid is copy that
includes what Steve Kruger in his book,

158
00:10:02.825 --> 00:10:05.098
Don't Want Me Think called, happy talk.

159
00:10:05.098 --> 00:10:08.314
And that's content that
doesn't really add any value.

160
00:10:08.314 --> 00:10:11.857
But it's things like hey,
welcome to our site and stuff like that,

161
00:10:11.857 --> 00:10:14.856
which just doesn't help
answer anybody's questions.

162
00:10:14.856 --> 00:10:16.513
See, remove that kind of thing.

163
00:10:16.513 --> 00:10:18.065
And also remove repetition.

164
00:10:18.065 --> 00:10:21.518
So when we're trying to convince
somebody in an argument,

165
00:10:21.518 --> 00:10:25.729
we often say the same thing in slightly
different ways in the hope that one

166
00:10:25.729 --> 00:10:28.021
of those things will land with people.

167
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:32.493
But actually online, that just creates
noise that people have to struggle and

168
00:10:32.493 --> 00:10:36.627
process pushing their cognitive load
up putting them in the worst mood,

169
00:10:36.627 --> 00:10:38.946
that means that less likely to convert.

170
00:10:38.946 --> 00:10:44.174
So be to the point, but that doesn't
mean you need to be super short.

171
00:10:44.174 --> 00:10:47.172
However, if you are producing more copy,
right?

172
00:10:47.172 --> 00:10:50.533
If maybe you're given a lot
of copy to work with and

173
00:10:50.533 --> 00:10:53.426
you don't have the freedom to shorten it.

174
00:10:53.426 --> 00:10:58.990
Or if it's just appropriate for
there to be more copy, what you then need

175
00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:04.204
to do is structure that content in
such a way as to aid scannability.

176
00:11:04.204 --> 00:11:11.058
So by way of an example,
here's one of my blog posts.

177
00:11:11.058 --> 00:11:15.306
And my blog posts are,
if you look at them, use lots of headings,

178
00:11:15.306 --> 00:11:18.494
lots of bullet points,
lots of pull out quotes.

179
00:11:18.494 --> 00:11:20.740
So I highlight different bits of content.

180
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.268
Also that someone could just scan down
the page, look at the various headlines,

181
00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:29.081
get a feel for what that paragraph or
that section is gonna be about.

182
00:11:29.081 --> 00:11:32.853
And then maybe scan a few lines if
they feel that it's relevant to them.

183
00:11:32.853 --> 00:11:37.592
I grab their attention with things
like pull out quotes and highlights.

184
00:11:37.592 --> 00:11:43.125
Everything is built around the fact that
someone is just gonna scan this page and

185
00:11:43.125 --> 00:11:45.945
look at different bits as they go along.

186
00:11:45.945 --> 00:11:47.692
So break your content down.

187
00:11:47.692 --> 00:11:53.102
We'll get into this more about actually
how to do this when we talk about design.

188
00:11:53.102 --> 00:11:56.657
But for now,
you can take any piece of content and

189
00:11:56.657 --> 00:12:01.340
make it a lot easier to consume and
scan simply by breaking it up,

190
00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.453
chunking it, adding highlights,
that kind of thing.

191
00:12:05.453 --> 00:12:07.909
So that's about making it scannable.

192
00:12:07.909 --> 00:12:11.814
The other piece of advice I would give
you, which I mentioned when we were

193
00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:15.734
talking about building trust earlier,
is to make your copy more human.

194
00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:18.510
Now you may remember I shared
with you a little bit of text,

195
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.506
which I compared to Silence of the Lambs.

196
00:12:20.506 --> 00:12:24.948
Which said, as well as insurance students
make the most of their potential through

197
00:12:24.948 --> 00:12:26.344
their academic studies,

198
00:12:26.344 --> 00:12:30.088
the University of Essex also provides
an environment which caters for

199
00:12:30.088 --> 00:12:34.085
all the needs of its students through
providing a range of accommodation,

200
00:12:34.085 --> 00:12:37.980
catering facilities, an active
students union, sports and the arts.

201
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.530
That is a terrible piece of text.

202
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.547
I said earlier,

203
00:12:42.547 --> 00:12:47.138
it's terrible because it used the third
person rather than first person.

204
00:12:47.138 --> 00:12:50.311
So it talked about the University
of Essex rather than we.

205
00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:52.767
It talked about the students
rather than you.

206
00:12:52.767 --> 00:12:57.292
But it's also bad because it's a one
sentence and it's really hard to scan.

207
00:12:57.292 --> 00:12:59.284
There is nothing good about this.

208
00:12:59.284 --> 00:13:03.242
So I thought by way of an example
let me very quickly rewrite it.

209
00:13:03.242 --> 00:13:06.116
Student life is about
more than just studying.

210
00:13:06.116 --> 00:13:11.074
We support you with everything you're
looking for or you'll be looking for.

211
00:13:11.074 --> 00:13:15.652
From accommodation and catering
through to an active student union,

212
00:13:15.652 --> 00:13:19.463
great sports facilities, and
an engaging arts program.

213
00:13:19.463 --> 00:13:22.040
So there's a couple of
things that I've done there.

214
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.903
One is, obviously, I've changed
the students to you and university to we.

215
00:13:26.903 --> 00:13:29.726
But also I've done more than that.

216
00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:32.827
I've broken it down so
that it's multiple sentences.

217
00:13:32.827 --> 00:13:38.071
And the very beginning of that sentence
notice that I say, student life is about

218
00:13:38.071 --> 00:13:43.332
more than just studying, which effectively
sums up everything that follows.

219
00:13:43.332 --> 00:13:45.030
Now that's called front loading.

220
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.517
It's getting to the point quickly.

221
00:13:47.517 --> 00:13:53.029
And then basically I could
go even further than this.

222
00:13:53.029 --> 00:13:57.477
And where it says we support you with
everything you'll be looking for.

223
00:13:57.477 --> 00:14:02.175
Then where it says accommodations,
catering, active student use, sports and

224
00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.218
an arts program.

225
00:14:03.218 --> 00:14:07.784
You could have those as bullets,
which would make it even more scannable.

226
00:14:07.784 --> 00:14:10.430
So you can take the same piece of content,

227
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:14.374
say the same thing in a more
concise easier way of scanning it.

228
00:14:14.374 --> 00:14:19.517
And that is what your clients and your
stakeholders and your marketing execs and

229
00:14:19.517 --> 00:14:24.276
all of the other people you're dealing
with do not understand very well,

230
00:14:24.276 --> 00:14:25.751
generally speaking.

231
00:14:25.751 --> 00:14:29.196
And this is what you can
bring to the table as

232
00:14:29.196 --> 00:14:33.033
you work with them on
creating their websites.

233
00:14:33.033 --> 00:14:35.114
That you can contribute with content,

234
00:14:35.114 --> 00:14:37.898
even if content isn't really
the thing that you do.

235
00:14:37.898 --> 00:14:43.216
And you have a fundamental role play in
educating stakeholders and your clients.

236
00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:48.662
And also maybe producing
the first draft of your content.

237
00:14:48.662 --> 00:14:50.131
Another thing.

238
00:14:50.131 --> 00:14:55.985
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I would say for developers who
are wanting to upgrade their career and

239
00:14:55.985 --> 00:15:00.579
whenever, writing blog posts and
getting used to writing,

240
00:15:00.579 --> 00:15:05.102
is just incredibly important for
developing your career.

241
00:15:05.102 --> 00:15:11.413
As well as if you're ever wanting to sell
courses and all those kinds of things.

242
00:15:11.413 --> 00:15:16.137
Developers speaking to other
developers is really the only

243
00:15:16.137 --> 00:15:18.691
way that that's gonna happen.

244
00:15:18.691 --> 00:15:23.071
Whereas when you're
speaking to that audience,

245
00:15:23.071 --> 00:15:27.567
you kind of have to have empathy for
that audience.

246
00:15:27.567 --> 00:15:30.453
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and
I started blogging in 2005.

247
00:15:30.453 --> 00:15:34.188
And I started writing content
to share with my peers,

248
00:15:34.188 --> 00:15:38.766
to share with other people what I
was doing, what I was learning.

249
00:15:38.766 --> 00:15:42.872
And I was rubbish at writing, right?

250
00:15:42.872 --> 00:15:46.386
I failed GCSE English.

251
00:15:46.386 --> 00:15:52.368
I'm just not particularly good at that,
my spelling and my grammar is atrocious.

252
00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:55.572
But by only blogging,
by sharing my experiences,

253
00:15:55.572 --> 00:15:57.664
I got comfortable with writing.

254
00:15:57.664 --> 00:16:02.396
Even if it wasn't very good and
if you can still to this day go back and

255
00:16:02.396 --> 00:16:06.316
read some of my early blog posts and
they're terrible.

256
00:16:06.316 --> 00:16:09.021
But it got me comfortable with writing.

257
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:10.393
And then over time,

258
00:16:10.393 --> 00:16:14.926
you begin to learn certain patterns
that work better with people.

259
00:16:14.926 --> 00:16:18.127
So experiment, try it out,
learn it for yourself.

260
00:16:18.127 --> 00:16:21.938
If you wanna promote a little
side project you've got.

261
00:16:21.938 --> 00:16:23.895
Trying these techniques and

262
00:16:23.895 --> 00:16:29.364
you'll be amazed at the difference it
makes to people's level of engagement.

263
00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:33.515
To the feedback that you get, and
to the number of people taking action.
