1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.897
So really that's about it for session one.

2
00:00:02.897 --> 00:00:06.734
I've no idea how long we've been running
because I haven't been paying attention.

3
00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:11.749
But let me summarize back to you what
we've covered in this first session.

4
00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:16.240
Basically, when it comes to dark patterns,
no you shouldn't be using them.

5
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.906
But make that a business argument,
not an ethical one,

6
00:00:19.906 --> 00:00:23.424
you'll find a much easier
to win stakeholders over.

7
00:00:23.424 --> 00:00:26.348
Second, make sure that in
everything you're doing,

8
00:00:26.348 --> 00:00:30.735
you're addressing users objections and
reducing the risk for them in your copy,

9
00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:32.977
in your design, in your calls to action.

10
00:00:32.977 --> 00:00:37.248
All of those kinds of things,
reduce risk and address objections.

11
00:00:37.248 --> 00:00:40.095
In your design,
make sure you're always simplifying,

12
00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:44.561
keeping people's cognitive load down, and
we're gonna explore that more in a minute.

13
00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:48.707
Focus in your content and
in your testimonials on building trust and

14
00:00:48.707 --> 00:00:50.170
overcoming cynicism.

15
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.953
Oops sorry about that.

16
00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:58.655
And finally, prioritize speed
above everything else because that

17
00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:04.468
is gonna be by far the biggest way
of improving your conversion rate.

18
00:01:04.468 --> 00:01:07.656
Outside of potentially cognitive load,

19
00:01:07.656 --> 00:01:11.669
you could argue both have
a pretty profound effect.

20
00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:13.561
So that's it for this session,

21
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:16.579
we will be moving on to
the next one in just a moment.

22
00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.599
But I do wanna spend a few minutes
addressing any questions that may have

23
00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:22.147
come in before we proceed.

24
00:01:22.147 --> 00:01:24.213
Have there been anything, Mark?

25
00:01:24.213 --> 00:01:28.697
&gt;&gt; So I just have a comment that we don't
use a framework for performance reasons.

26
00:01:28.697 --> 00:01:31.032
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And people compliment our website all

27
00:01:31.032 --> 00:01:31.637
the time.

28
00:01:31.637 --> 00:01:36.137
They post screenshots of
web page test results or

29
00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:40.649
lighthouse test results and
that kind of thing.

30
00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.606
And yeah, it works well for us
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

31
00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:49.522
I mean if you're building something
like a full blown SAS product or

32
00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:54.472
something like that, then I can completely
understand using a framework kinda makes

33
00:01:54.472 --> 00:01:56.209
sense in a context like that.

34
00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:58.874
But certainly for
sales and marketing sites,

35
00:01:58.874 --> 00:02:02.289
which obviously is the main
thing we're focusing on here,

36
00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.201
it's very rarely is it actually
necessary to do that kind of thing.

37
00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:08.817
So has anybody got any questions?

38
00:02:08.817 --> 00:02:13.508
If we don't have questions I think it
might be quite fun to maybe look at some

39
00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:14.327
websites and

40
00:02:14.327 --> 00:02:18.887
see what we can do with some of the things
that we've talked about so far.

41
00:02:20.478 --> 00:02:24.806
&gt;&gt; Someone asked if you're going to get
into your graphic design principles for

42
00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:26.147
converting websites?

43
00:02:26.147 --> 00:02:28.797
Yes, yeah, absolutely.

44
00:02:28.797 --> 00:02:33.355
So we're gonna talk about content next
when we're going to be talking about how

45
00:02:33.355 --> 00:02:36.157
to create a value proposition
that presents it.

46
00:02:36.157 --> 00:02:40.778
But then after that, we're gonna look
in depth at design principles and

47
00:02:40.778 --> 00:02:43.517
how to design a page that highly converts.

48
00:02:43.517 --> 00:02:48.276
I'm not gonna get into the fundamentals
of design because there are other

49
00:02:48.276 --> 00:02:49.742
courses that do that.

50
00:02:49.742 --> 00:02:56.367
But we're gonna look particularly at
how to approach design for conversion.

51
00:02:56.367 --> 00:02:59.773
&gt;&gt; There's a question
about more information or

52
00:02:59.773 --> 00:03:05.198
anything that you could recommend on
learning more about dark patterns.

53
00:03:05.198 --> 00:03:08.135
&gt;&gt; Sure, [LAUGH] well,
learning more how to do them.

54
00:03:08.135 --> 00:03:13.451
I mean, obviously this is the point
where I have to pimp my own book,

55
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:17.484
Click, which is published
by Smashing Magazine.

56
00:03:17.484 --> 00:03:22.809
And that kinda gets into all that we're
talking about today in a lot more detail.

57
00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:27.081
If you're interested in dark
patterns more generally,

58
00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:32.966
there's a website called darkpatterns.org,
which is a good one to follow.

59
00:03:32.966 --> 00:03:37.971
They've also got a Twitter account,
which I quite enjoy as well cuz they post

60
00:03:37.971 --> 00:03:43.532
examples of horrendous dark patterns that
gives you good giggle every now and again.

61
00:03:43.532 --> 00:03:46.487
But yeah, that's a good site,
that one will help.
