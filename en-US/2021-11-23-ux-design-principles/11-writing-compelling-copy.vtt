1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.560
So let's talk about writing copy for
the web,

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.613
because in my experience,
most people suck at this, right?

3
00:00:10.613 --> 00:00:14.533
Just because, I'm not gonna say you
guys cuz I know a lot of you guys

4
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:19.506
read the designers or developers and so
you wouldn't claim to be good copywriters.

5
00:00:19.506 --> 00:00:24.205
But just because you're a marketer or
an academic or someone that writes

6
00:00:24.205 --> 00:00:29.224
business reports does not mean you can
write good copy for a website, right?

7
00:00:29.224 --> 00:00:34.318
It's a very different approach that has to
be done in a very, very particular way.

8
00:00:34.318 --> 00:00:39.399
And so this is why I'm currently
encouraging you guys to have a go at copy.

9
00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.558
Cuz I know a lot of you will
be sitting there thinking,

10
00:00:42.558 --> 00:00:44.633
I'm no good at writing copy, right?

11
00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:46.538
But neither is anybody else.

12
00:00:46.538 --> 00:00:52.149
[LAUGH] That's the truth of it, that
very few people can write good web copy.

13
00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.714
And at least you've sat
through this course and

14
00:00:54.714 --> 00:00:56.520
learnt the basics of how to do it.

15
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.262
And to be quite frank, because you're
immersed in the web all the time,

16
00:01:01.262 --> 00:01:05.645
you've got a much more intuitive
feel of how people read, right?

17
00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:10.001
A lot of people are still under this
delusion that people read websites.

18
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:15.099
But you and I know they don't do that,
you and I know people scan websites.

19
00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:18.660
They're looking for the bits of
information that they want, and

20
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.910
has a fundamental effect on how
you go about creating copy.

21
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.837
In actual fact, according to some
research by the Nielsen Norman Group,

22
00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:31.133
people are only reading less than
25% of the copy on any page.

23
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:35.295
So that creates some real challenges
if we wanna create compelling copy that

24
00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:37.190
encourage people to take action.

25
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.082
So you need some basic ideas
about how to go about doing it.

26
00:01:41.082 --> 00:01:46.460
So the first thing is to understand
that a website isn't a book,

27
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.847
isn't a brochure, isn't something you flip
through in any logical way necessarily.

28
00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:58.638
So we need to design a kinda content
hierarchy that accommodates the somewhat

29
00:01:58.638 --> 00:02:01.596
anarchistic way that
people access a website.

30
00:02:01.596 --> 00:02:05.854
But also take into account
different learning styles and

31
00:02:05.854 --> 00:02:08.964
different ways people consume content.

32
00:02:08.964 --> 00:02:16.131
So a very broad wholly level, people tend
to consume content in one of two ways.

33
00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:20.770
There's people like me,
right, who are to be honest,

34
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.743
I'm not a details person, right?

35
00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:28.372
I'm not somebody that is very good at
kind of paying attention to details.

36
00:02:28.372 --> 00:02:30.763
I'm give me the big picture, right?

37
00:02:30.763 --> 00:02:35.224
So I'm the kind of people, I just want the
summary, I'll make a gut reaction as to

38
00:02:35.224 --> 00:02:39.249
whether this product is for me or
not, and I'll make a decision, right?

39
00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:45.046
So I'm exceptionally lazy and rely heavily
on system one, the automatic path.

40
00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:51.887
While my co-founder of the agency I
used to run, he's a details person.

41
00:02:51.887 --> 00:02:57.180
He's the person that reads iTune terms and
conditions, that kind of person.

42
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.115
And he will want a lot more detail
on our website than I will.

43
00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:05.908
So that creates an interesting challenge,
doesn't it?

44
00:03:05.908 --> 00:03:11.062
How do you accommodate people like my
co-founder, Chris, at the same time

45
00:03:11.062 --> 00:03:16.069
not overwhelming someone like me,
right, who just wants a big picture?

46
00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.695
Well, you do it by creating
a content hierarchy that guides

47
00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:22.244
people through the process a little bit.

48
00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:23.137
So, again,

49
00:03:23.137 --> 00:03:28.679
I'm not necessarily expecting you to see
the details of this particular slide.

50
00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:32.819
But essentially it comes to
the hierarchy of your website

51
00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.623
should drill down into
progressively more detail.

52
00:03:36.623 --> 00:03:41.620
So the homepage of your website is the
summary, is the thing for people like me,

53
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.360
or your landing page or
whatever you wanna call it, right?

54
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.671
That's the thing that's aimed at people
like me that just want the summary,

55
00:03:49.671 --> 00:03:51.076
top level information.

56
00:03:51.076 --> 00:03:55.186
And then,
people can drill down into more details.

57
00:03:55.186 --> 00:03:59.869
For example, you might have a page for
each of your benefits.

58
00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:02.457
Remember I talked about
the different benefits,

59
00:04:02.457 --> 00:04:06.349
you might unpack those in more detail
with a whole page on each one, right?

60
00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:12.348
Or your list of features might have
multiple pages, one for each feature.

61
00:04:12.348 --> 00:04:15.652
Also, of course, you might have
multiple products, in which case,

62
00:04:15.652 --> 00:04:18.571
you'll wanna have landing pages for
each of those products.

63
00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:23.146
So the deeper you go in the site, the more
detail and more nuance you're unpacking

64
00:04:23.146 --> 00:04:27.325
for those people that want that without
it cluttering up the experience for

65
00:04:27.325 --> 00:04:30.470
those people who just want
the summary at the top level.

66
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.906
So that's the first thing
you need to bear in mind.

67
00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:37.903
But the same principle of this
kinda hierarchy of content

68
00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:40.910
doesn't just apply to the site as a whole.

69
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.373
It also applies with
the individual pages as well.

70
00:04:45.373 --> 00:04:48.285
So the title of the page, right,

71
00:04:48.285 --> 00:04:53.381
is gonna be our strap line, or
is going to be the must know,

72
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:59.519
it's got to include that must know
information that just got to know.

73
00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:04.391
Then you might have a summary underneath
that, a couple of sentences that maybe

74
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:08.841
go into a little bit more detail,
include little bit more information.

75
00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:14.013
And then maybe you've got some headings
that have got a little bit more nuance.

76
00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:17.544
And then sub headings, and
then section copy, and so

77
00:05:17.544 --> 00:05:21.482
it's going from must knows all
the way down to nice to know.

78
00:05:21.482 --> 00:05:25.745
And you gotta all the time keep that
hierarchy in your minds as you work.

79
00:05:25.745 --> 00:05:29.366
So how do you achieve
this in practical terms?

80
00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:34.455
So we've got a strap line,
which is obviously gonna go at the top.

81
00:05:34.455 --> 00:05:38.183
And then we might write a little bit of a
summary that unpacks that in a little bit

82
00:05:38.183 --> 00:05:39.551
more that sits underneath.

83
00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:45.236
But then we've got our chunk of benefits
or chunk of features and our objections.

84
00:05:45.236 --> 00:05:48.910
So what do we do with each of those
bullet points that we've created for

85
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.294
those different things?

86
00:05:50.294 --> 00:05:53.503
Well, for each one, we need to
think in terms of content blocks.

87
00:05:53.503 --> 00:05:59.120
If you look at pretty much any website,
it's made up of content blocks, right?

88
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.547
And each benefit, each feature,

89
00:06:01.547 --> 00:06:06.407
each objection probably is gonna
have its own content block, okay?

90
00:06:06.407 --> 00:06:11.135
So, for example, if you had benefits,
you would have your three benefits

91
00:06:11.135 --> 00:06:15.352
side by side in three columns,
right, like I've mocked up here.

92
00:06:15.352 --> 00:06:18.785
And that would be a chunk on the page.

93
00:06:18.785 --> 00:06:20.492
Remember I talked about chunking.

94
00:06:20.492 --> 00:06:22.056
You can do that with content as well.

95
00:06:22.056 --> 00:06:25.487
So you've got your benefits chunked,
grouped together.

96
00:06:25.487 --> 00:06:30.326
Then underneath that, you'll have your
features grouped together, right?

97
00:06:30.326 --> 00:06:34.078
And each content block is made
up of four elements, right,

98
00:06:34.078 --> 00:06:36.340
two of which are optional, right?

99
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:42.759
The required ones is a heading and
a short description.

100
00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:48.118
So if your benefit is to lose
the weight after pregnancy,

101
00:06:48.118 --> 00:06:54.047
right, your heading will be Lose
the Weight after Pregnancy.

102
00:06:54.047 --> 00:06:58.194
And then the copy underneath might go,

103
00:06:58.194 --> 00:07:05.616
losing weight build up in pregnancy
is one of the hardest things to do.

104
00:07:05.616 --> 00:07:10.470
And our app is optimized to guide you
through the process as quickly and

105
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.100
painlessly as possible,
done, boom, all right?

106
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:19.284
That is your summary version for
the likes of me, okay?

107
00:07:19.284 --> 00:07:21.032
I might only read the heading.

108
00:07:21.032 --> 00:07:25.520
I might just read the Lose Weight after
Pregnancy and that might be enough for me,

109
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.744
and I'm ready to go, although admittedly
I'm not likely to get pregnant,

110
00:07:29.744 --> 00:07:32.518
so it's not the most
appropriate example for me.

111
00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:35.911
But I might want a little bit more
information, what do you mean by that?

112
00:07:35.911 --> 00:07:37.516
Well, then I can read the bit underneath.

113
00:07:37.516 --> 00:07:41.757
Now, some people like Chris,
my co-founder, he will want even more,

114
00:07:41.757 --> 00:07:43.716
well, how are you gonna do that?

115
00:07:43.716 --> 00:07:44.457
How does it work?

116
00:07:44.457 --> 00:07:47.164
How long will it take that kind of thing?

117
00:07:47.164 --> 00:07:52.042
Well for me, for Chris, then you can add
a link in, right, on your content block,

118
00:07:52.042 --> 00:07:56.465
which would go off to a page that would
break that down in more information.

119
00:07:56.465 --> 00:08:02.916
Now, some people are more visual thinkers,
right, so you might wanna add an image in.

120
00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:07.924
That's another optional thing that you can
do, just to grab people's attention so

121
00:08:07.924 --> 00:08:11.802
they can look at it, and
it might show a pregnant woman on scales,

122
00:08:11.802 --> 00:08:15.841
just to kind of in some way indicate
what the content block is about.

123
00:08:15.841 --> 00:08:18.730
So you're giving these visual clues, but

124
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.353
everything is organized
into these content blocks.

125
00:08:22.353 --> 00:08:26.935
So you need to take your list of benefits,
your list of features, and

126
00:08:26.935 --> 00:08:31.754
possibly your objections, I'll
explain that in a little bit more, and

127
00:08:31.754 --> 00:08:36.179
go through and write content blocks for
each one of those, right?

128
00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:40.741
Now in terms of the objections,
having your own content blocks

129
00:08:40.741 --> 00:08:45.660
dedicated to objections doesn't
always work particularly well.

130
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:50.933
What you probably wanna consider
doing instead is integrating

131
00:08:50.933 --> 00:08:55.619
dealing with those objections
as they come up, right?

132
00:08:55.619 --> 00:09:01.947
So for example, well, let's take our Lose
the Weight after Pregnancy content block.

133
00:09:01.947 --> 00:09:06.456
In that description,
you might wanna say something like,

134
00:09:06.456 --> 00:09:12.511
our method is an FDA approved approach
to weight loss after pregnancy, right?

135
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:16.740
So what you've done there is
you've taken the objection of,

136
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.233
is this actually a real thing or
is it just a con, and

137
00:09:20.233 --> 00:09:24.654
you've put in the FDA approved
bit in order to reassure people.

138
00:09:24.654 --> 00:09:28.750
So you're kind of dealing with your
objections as they pop into people's

139
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:29.418
thinking.

140
00:09:29.418 --> 00:09:33.543
And that's one of the big mistakes
people make with objections,

141
00:09:33.543 --> 00:09:36.021
is they include them at the wrong time.

142
00:09:36.021 --> 00:09:41.013
So, for example, no doubt your website
has a privacy policy that says what

143
00:09:41.013 --> 00:09:44.034
you do with people's private data, right?

144
00:09:44.034 --> 00:09:47.054
But it will be buried in
the footer somewhere, okay?

145
00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:49.198
Now, people don't come
to the website going,

146
00:09:49.198 --> 00:09:52.260
I wonder what the privacy policy is,
and go to the privacy section.

147
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.995
What they do is they go to sign up and go,
ooh, now you're asking me for personal

148
00:09:56.995 --> 00:10:01.825
data, I'm not sure I'm comfortable
with that, what's your privacy policy?

149
00:10:01.825 --> 00:10:06.332
Now if buried down in the footer,
people aren't gonna find it.

150
00:10:06.332 --> 00:10:09.193
So you've got to put it there at that
moment when people think about it.

151
00:10:09.193 --> 00:10:11.738
So as you're writing your content blocks,

152
00:10:11.738 --> 00:10:16.160
you need to ask yourself what objections
are related to this content block.

153
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.418
So you can very systematically
assemble a page out of a series

154
00:10:21.418 --> 00:10:25.968
of content blocks made up of benefits and
features.

155
00:10:25.968 --> 00:10:30.584
Now through that, as I'll show you
later when we talk about design,

156
00:10:30.584 --> 00:10:33.930
you're scattering things
like testimonials and

157
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.210
other forms of social proof and
calls to action.

158
00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:38.548
But fundamentally,

159
00:10:38.548 --> 00:10:43.091
your page is just made up of these
content blocks that build up together.

160
00:10:43.091 --> 00:10:48.285
And even something like testimonials,
they are essentially content blocks,

161
00:10:48.285 --> 00:10:52.249
you have a picture of the person
that you're talking about.

162
00:10:52.249 --> 00:10:55.652
I recommend if you've got
a relatively long testimonial,

163
00:10:55.652 --> 00:10:59.265
you pull out one little quote from
it that you make the heading.

164
00:10:59.265 --> 00:11:02.453
So if people don't read
the whole of the testimonial,

165
00:11:02.453 --> 00:11:07.326
they still get the summary version, and
maybe there's a link off to social media.

166
00:11:07.326 --> 00:11:10.821
So that's basically content blocks and
how they work.

167
00:11:10.821 --> 00:11:15.012
And actually I wanted to pick up on one
of the issues in particular which was

168
00:11:15.012 --> 00:11:17.520
the example that I gave
about a fitness app.

169
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.385
Where I talked about a woman potentially
losing weight after being pregnant,

170
00:11:22.385 --> 00:11:25.113
and there was some really
great feedback and

171
00:11:25.113 --> 00:11:28.812
discussion about whether that
is actually a good example.

172
00:11:28.812 --> 00:11:33.525
Whether actually that is a dot pattern in
itself making women feel like they have to

173
00:11:33.525 --> 00:11:34.560
lose the weight.

174
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.699
And obviously I just gave it as
an example off the top of my head and

175
00:11:38.699 --> 00:11:42.160
different women have
different feelings over that.

176
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.436
And I'm not a woman and
I've never been pregnant, so

177
00:11:44.436 --> 00:11:45.811
I'm not gonna comment on that.

178
00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:51.816
But what it does raise is a really
interesting point about dot patterns,

179
00:11:51.816 --> 00:11:57.142
and that is that I can feel that
something is okay as the creator.

180
00:11:57.142 --> 00:12:00.895
But really whether I see something
as being a dot pattern or

181
00:12:00.895 --> 00:12:04.887
not is irrelevant,
is what my audience thinks that matters.

182
00:12:04.887 --> 00:12:09.889
So for example, when I gave that as
an example, it didn't occur to me for

183
00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:13.825
a moment that someone might
perceive that weight loss for

184
00:12:13.825 --> 00:12:16.627
a pregnant woman would be a dot pattern.

185
00:12:16.627 --> 00:12:21.440
Effectively shaming people to lose
weight that maybe don't necessarily

186
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.456
feel the need.

187
00:12:22.456 --> 00:12:27.920
That didn't occur to me as a white
middle-class, middle-aged man, but

188
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:33.052
it would and did occur to certain
segments of the audience in the chat.

189
00:12:33.052 --> 00:12:33.997
So to them,

190
00:12:33.997 --> 00:12:39.766
it was a dot pattern even if my intention
wasn't to create a dot pattern.

191
00:12:39.766 --> 00:12:44.286
And so you have to be incredibly
careful about this kind of thing,

192
00:12:44.286 --> 00:12:47.984
that you've really got to
listen to user feedback and

193
00:12:47.984 --> 00:12:53.265
adjust your marketing and your tone of
voice and your content accordingly.

194
00:12:53.265 --> 00:12:58.155
And that's why iterative design and
A/B testing and user research and

195
00:12:58.155 --> 00:13:03.128
user testing is so important,
because it's very easy, as I already did

196
00:13:03.128 --> 00:13:08.040
with that example, to misjudge
a situation and go down the wrong line.

197
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.696
So it's a really interesting topic that
dot patterns aren't this black and

198
00:13:11.696 --> 00:13:12.390
white thing.

199
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.282
You can't point to something and
say that is a dot pattern and that is not.

200
00:13:16.282 --> 00:13:21.251
Because it does depend on perspectives,
and the only perspective that really

201
00:13:21.251 --> 00:13:25.558
matters is that of the audience
you're trying to encourage to act.
