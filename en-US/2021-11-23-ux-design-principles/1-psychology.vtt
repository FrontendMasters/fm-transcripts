1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.065
So what we're going to cover in this
session is I'm going to explain

2
00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:08.670
why psychology is so important to
encouraging people to take action.

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.690
We're going to look at doc patterns and
what they are, exactly.

4
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.810
Then we're going to look at warning
dark patterns or a bad idea, okay?

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.806
And then we're going to look at four
psychological principles that you can use

6
00:00:23.806 --> 00:00:28.282
without starting to get into dark
patterns and those kinds of things.

7
00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:33.262
Because the problem with something
like nudge is that it can begin to get

8
00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:37.080
a little bit manipulative
if you're not too careful.

9
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.597
So you need to think very carefully about
the techniques and how you use them and

10
00:00:41.597 --> 00:00:42.429
when you use.

11
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.050
So, why talk about psychology?

12
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.005
Why is this such an important subject
when it comes to decision making and

13
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:56.730
acting on websites?

14
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.850
Well I'm sorry to break it to you but you
are not as logical as you think you are.

15
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.008
We like to all think of ourselves as
Vulcans right that when we're presented

16
00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:14.680
with a decision we weigh the pros and cons
and we make a logical decision over it.

17
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.380
Unfortunately nothing could
be further from the truth.

18
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.143
Most of the decisions that we make
are instinctive, intuitive decisions.

19
00:01:23.143 --> 00:01:27.996
And also we don't even structure
the world around us in

20
00:01:27.996 --> 00:01:33.498
a logical way okay let me give
you a very simple example right.

21
00:01:33.498 --> 00:01:37.683
Where did the tomatoes
belong in a supermarket?

22
00:01:37.683 --> 00:01:44.391
Right, if you are logical they belong in
the fruits right, in the fruit aisle.

23
00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:48.740
And that's because tomatoes
are fruits okay but

24
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.140
we always put them in the salad aisle.

25
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.289
Why did we do?

26
00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:59.026
That's not logical what we do it
because our procedural knowledge

27
00:01:59.026 --> 00:02:05.080
are kind of the way that we think of
using tomatoes is as part of a salad.

28
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.840
So therefore it should
sit in the salad aisle.

29
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.768
But actually that's not logical and
we make lots of decisions all the time

30
00:02:12.768 --> 00:02:16.358
based around our mental model,
how we see the world.

31
00:02:16.358 --> 00:02:18.885
And how we organize
information within the world.

32
00:02:18.885 --> 00:02:23.650
And we'll get into that in a little
bit more in a few minutes time.

33
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.057
But the first thing to know is that most
of our decision making is emotional,

34
00:02:30.057 --> 00:02:31.200
right?

35
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.700
So we have a primal brain.

36
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.430
Now our primal brain is
the oldest part of our brain.

37
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.950
It's our brainstem.

38
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.240
It's often called the lizard brain.

39
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.287
And it's the the kind of survival
instinct part of our brain.

40
00:02:46.287 --> 00:02:52.350
And it handles things like aggression and
fear the flight and fight response.

41
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.120
And this is a critical part of
our decision making process.

42
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.451
So if you've ever been to a website
that uses techniques like fear, right.

43
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:09.938
Fear of missing out, fear of
something going wrong that is really

44
00:03:09.938 --> 00:03:15.030
it's using psychological
manipulation to encourage you to

45
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.547
make a decision to act and
it's playing off of that primal brain.

46
00:03:20.547 --> 00:03:26.784
Equally if you go to a website and
it plays off of scarcity right?

47
00:03:26.784 --> 00:03:31.635
So this is gonna run out soon again
that's manipulating your primal

48
00:03:31.635 --> 00:03:35.393
brain that likes to hoard and
keep things to itself.

49
00:03:35.393 --> 00:03:40.346
So these kinds of fundamental
manipulative techniques

50
00:03:40.346 --> 00:03:43.410
are targeting your primal brain.

51
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.137
But the primal brain
presents some problems for

52
00:03:47.137 --> 00:03:52.363
those of us that want to encourage
people to act ethically as well.

53
00:03:52.363 --> 00:03:55.051
The primal brain, for example,
likes to hoard things.

54
00:03:55.051 --> 00:04:00.256
So it doesn't like to give up stuff like
paying money for something or it doesn't

55
00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:06.530
like to hand over personal information
because it's afraid of what will happen.

56
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.495
So our primal brain lives in this
kind of constant state of looking for

57
00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:12.960
dangers and risks.

58
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.820
It's all of the time.

59
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.497
It's the bit that kept us alive in
the savannahs of Africa because it was

60
00:04:17.497 --> 00:04:18.110
looking for

61
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.150
movement that might be some saber toothed
tiger that was gonna rip us apart, right?

62
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.000
So, we need to understand the primal brain
and understand how to calm it, okay?

63
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.900
To enable us to encourage
people to take action.

64
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.410
So, there's one little bit of
psychology you need to understand.

65
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.970
So, remember the primal brain.

66
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.730
We'll be coming back to that later.

67
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.263
Another kind of part of psychology
that's really important to decide

68
00:04:43.263 --> 00:04:49.380
is that we make the majority of our
decisions subconsciously, right?

69
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.984
So it might be that you're sitting
here watching this course at home, and

70
00:04:53.984 --> 00:04:57.300
you've just picked up
from beside you a drink.

71
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.960
You probably picked up your drink.

72
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.610
You took a sip and you put it down again.

73
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.860
Right now, you didn't think about
that you didn't go, I'm thirsty.

74
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.190
I therefore need a drink,
there is a drink beside me.

75
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.010
I'm going to pick it up and
I'm going to drink it, right?

76
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.810
You didn't think that you did
it entirely instinctively.

77
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.320
And so
many of our decisions are done like that.

78
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.470
And it comes down to what is
called system one and system two.

79
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.530
So, earlier I mentioned a book
called thinking fast thinking slow,

80
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.905
where he introduces this concept
of system one and system.

81
00:05:34.905 --> 00:05:38.875
It's a really useful
concept to understand.

82
00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:43.853
So system one,
is the kinda fast automatic,

83
00:05:43.853 --> 00:05:48.310
intuitive emotional mode of thinking.

84
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.280
So the majority of decisions like
whether to take a drink is being

85
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.490
made automatically by system one,
all the time, right?

86
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.580
So for example, if I said to you,
what's 2+2, right?

87
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.440
You don't have to think about that, you
just remember that the answer is 4, okay?

88
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:16.670
It's intuitive quick unconscious
reaction to that particular statement.

89
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.510
So that's system one.

90
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.370
And then there is system two.

91
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.500
Now system two is our conscious brain.

92
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.420
It's the slower, more effortful,
more deliberate part of our brain.

93
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.826
So it's the part of our brain that
we make conscious decisions with.

94
00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:39.712
But while system one is effortless,
system two takes effort and

95
00:06:39.712 --> 00:06:44.950
it's limited, it gets tired and
depleted very easily.

96
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.534
And I can give you a real world
example of this where you will

97
00:06:48.534 --> 00:06:51.700
have personally experienced this.

98
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.790
So those of you that have that
have learned to drive at least

99
00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.400
when you first learned to drive,
it was hard work, wasn't it?

100
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.740
There was loads of things to think about.

101
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.480
You have to, check your mirrors,
you had to look at oncoming traffic,

102
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.666
you had to steer.

103
00:07:08.666 --> 00:07:13.240
If you were in Europe,
you had to change gear.

104
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.500
You had to deal with all these different
pedals indicators, all the rest of it.

105
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.800
It was overwhelming, right?

106
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.037
And you'd have to do all of that was
system to because it was a new thing and

107
00:07:25.037 --> 00:07:26.163
it was effortful.

108
00:07:26.163 --> 00:07:31.217
And you'd be exhausted by the time
you've finished a driving lesson.

109
00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:35.935
Now skip on a few years when you've
been driving regularly especially if

110
00:07:35.935 --> 00:07:39.350
you've been doing a commute
between home and work.

111
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:44.020
Did you ever have those days where you'd
get to work and go, how did I get here?

112
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.450
I've got no memory of
the journey whatsoever.

113
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:52.460
Well that's because system
one has taken over that job.

114
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.120
You've become so accustomed to do it
that is become a subconscious thing.

115
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:04.750
So we're gonna talk more about system one
and two throughout this entire course.

116
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.631
So just keep it in mind system
one is your subconscious,

117
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:11.782
effortless, easy and automatic thinking.

118
00:08:11.782 --> 00:08:18.260
System two is your conscious mind and
it takes a lot more effort.

119
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:24.104
And related to that is another aspect of
psychology that you need to be aware of,

120
00:08:24.104 --> 00:08:29.030
which is that we are inherently
lazy thinkers, right.

121
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.662
So this is evolution for you evolution
believes in using the minimal

122
00:08:33.662 --> 00:08:37.520
amount of effort possible
to achieve results.

123
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.203
Now, we've already said that system
one requires a lot less effort than

124
00:08:42.203 --> 00:08:43.470
system two.

125
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:48.989
So we, tend to favor that over
system one because a sorry,

126
00:08:48.989 --> 00:08:54.690
we favor system one over system two,
if that makes sense.

127
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:59.820
So let me give you a real world example
of where this can become a problem.

128
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.023
So, if I asked you what the chances are of
your favorite football team going on to

129
00:09:04.023 --> 00:09:05.673
win the cup next year, right.

130
00:09:05.673 --> 00:09:10.243
Obviously I'm talking about English
football, boat, American football,

131
00:09:10.243 --> 00:09:11.915
it doesn't really matter.

132
00:09:11.915 --> 00:09:14.789
So that's a complicated
question to answer, isn't it?

133
00:09:14.789 --> 00:09:19.286
There were many different factors
that would determine whether or

134
00:09:19.286 --> 00:09:22.912
not a team was successful
as you buy the competition.

135
00:09:22.912 --> 00:09:27.063
How well they were performing,
whether he had injuries,

136
00:09:27.063 --> 00:09:31.892
there are many, many different things
that could get in the way that

137
00:09:31.892 --> 00:09:37.170
make it hard to answer whether or
not that that is likely to happen.

138
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:42.590
Now you could, if you were completely
logical and you were a system two thinker.

139
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.363
All the way you could go and
do your research and

140
00:09:45.363 --> 00:09:48.720
you could look at the probabilities and
work it all out.

141
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.948
And make an informed answer to my
question, chances are mind you're not

142
00:09:52.948 --> 00:09:57.360
going to do that you're not gonna
do it because we are lazy thinkers.

143
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.830
Instead, you're going to rely on system
one to answer that question, right?

144
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.718
And system one is going to
go with a gut reaction,

145
00:10:04.718 --> 00:10:09.290
a visceral reaction of whether
they you think it's likely or not.

146
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:13.170
And that will be based on your
own bias towards your team.

147
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.540
And also,
towards what the current situation is.

148
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.943
If there's currently one of your
team members, that are injured,

149
00:10:20.943 --> 00:10:23.550
you might reduce the probability slightly.

150
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:25.634
If you've been doing really
well in recent games,

151
00:10:25.634 --> 00:10:28.090
you might increase
the probability slightly.

152
00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:34.210
But you'll give it a gut reaction rather
than a really well considered response.

153
00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.508
You're just kind of guessing at it.

154
00:10:36.508 --> 00:10:41.348
And obviously you can see how this
starts to apply to the decision making

155
00:10:41.348 --> 00:10:45.783
that we're making about whether to
sign up to a product or not, or

156
00:10:45.783 --> 00:10:48.220
whether a product is good, right?

157
00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:52.296
If you haven't heard of a product very
much, your system one might conclude,

158
00:10:52.296 --> 00:10:55.480
well, it's not a very good product, right?

159
00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.276
So there are all kinds of different
factors playing here, but

160
00:10:59.276 --> 00:11:03.570
the thing that I want you to take
away is that we're inherently lazy.

161
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.300
We like to not have to think, right.

162
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:10.140
There's a really famous book by an author
called Steve Krug called don't make me

163
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.145
think, right.

164
00:11:11.145 --> 00:11:13.779
Which is a book about
usability testing and

165
00:11:13.779 --> 00:11:16.486
improving the usability
of your website and

166
00:11:16.486 --> 00:11:21.840
if you've never read don't make me think I
highly recommend getting yourself a copy.

167
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.380
It's really short, really easy to read.

168
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.745
And you can probably read
it in a single sitting.

169
00:11:26.745 --> 00:11:31.501
And the premise of the book is in
the title don't make me think.

170
00:11:31.501 --> 00:11:35.773
So one of the best things that we can do
is reduce the amount that people think on

171
00:11:35.773 --> 00:11:36.442
a website.

172
00:11:36.442 --> 00:11:39.119
We'll come back to that later as well.

173
00:11:39.119 --> 00:11:43.804
So those are some of the kind
of fundamental principles of

174
00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:48.401
psychology that I need you to
kind of hold in your brain.

175
00:11:48.401 --> 00:11:51.613
The fact that we're in heresy lazy,
the fact that we

176
00:11:51.613 --> 00:11:56.003
favor system one over system two and
the difference between those two.

177
00:11:56.003 --> 00:11:59.210
And the fact that we're very
influenced by our primal brain,

178
00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:00.808
the oldest part of our brain.

179
00:12:00.808 --> 00:12:05.848
We need to be aware of these
things as we go about designing

180
00:12:05.848 --> 00:12:09.943
a website and
creating a value proposition for

181
00:12:09.943 --> 00:12:14.780
a product or a service and
all of those kinds of things.
