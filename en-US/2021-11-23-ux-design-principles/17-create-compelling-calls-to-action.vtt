1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.924
So as well as worrying about where
people are looking on the page,

2
00:00:05.924 --> 00:00:09.643
we need to think about our
calls to action in particular.

3
00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:14.641
These are obviously the most critical
element when it comes to the design of any

4
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:18.440
website and it's absolutely
essential we get them right.

5
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.777
The most essential part of
them is that people spot them.

6
00:00:23.777 --> 00:00:28.764
We've already talked about the copy and
how we want to make them clear and

7
00:00:28.764 --> 00:00:31.462
compelling and that kind of thing, but

8
00:00:31.462 --> 00:00:36.156
if people don't see them all the great
copy in the world is useless.

9
00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:40.849
Now, we can partly do that by drawing
people's attention using the techniques

10
00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:42.389
we've already covered,

11
00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:46.116
but there is more that we can do
when it comes to calls to action.

12
00:00:46.116 --> 00:00:50.987
For a start, we can simplify the number
of calls to action we've had.

13
00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:55.525
I touched on this in the last section,
but it is worth repeating.

14
00:00:55.525 --> 00:01:00.234
So often on web sites, we have so
many different calls to action, so

15
00:01:00.234 --> 00:01:05.540
many things that we want people to use,
and that can be really problematic.

16
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.420
Here is an agency website I just
happen to grab at random, and

17
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.220
they've got a ridiculous number of
calls to action going on there.

18
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.200
You've got sign up for our newsletter,
they've got send us a message,

19
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.453
get in touch, phone us, email us,
follow us on social media, chat with us.

20
00:01:22.453 --> 00:01:25.920
All these different things vying for
attention.

21
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.260
The site is begging people
to contact them, isn't it?

22
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.502
But it's too much.

23
00:01:32.502 --> 00:01:36.688
It's too much repetition, so
it creates noise on the page, and

24
00:01:36.688 --> 00:01:41.260
it can lead to paralysis about when or
what do you want me to do sign up for

25
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.522
the newsletter or get in contact?

26
00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:44.962
What do you want me to do here?

27
00:01:44.962 --> 00:01:45.938
Be very clear.

28
00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:49.377
So my rule of thumb, generally speaking,

29
00:01:49.377 --> 00:01:54.160
is to have a primary action and
a secondary action, right?

30
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.920
So your primary action is
the main thing you wanna do, so

31
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.032
on an agency website like this
it would be get in touch, right,

32
00:02:00.032 --> 00:02:04.380
ciz that's the primary thing we want
to do, get in touch and hire us.

33
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.648
But not everybody is going to be ready for
that, right, so

34
00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:10.450
you also have a second reaction.

35
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.413
And your second reaction might be
sign up for a newsletter, okay?

36
00:02:14.413 --> 00:02:17.210
So for those people that aren't ready yet
to commit,

37
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.562
we want to be able to keep in contact with
them until they are ready to commit, okay,

38
00:02:21.562 --> 00:02:24.573
and that's where something
like a newsletter comes in.

39
00:02:24.573 --> 00:02:28.659
So let's take, for example, Frontend
Masters that we were looking at earlier.

40
00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.282
You have multiple calls to action
that were very similar and

41
00:02:32.282 --> 00:02:34.314
may be conflicting a little bit.

42
00:02:34.314 --> 00:02:38.083
There was browse our courses,
there was view our,

43
00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:43.050
I can't remember they were called,
paths or learning paths.

44
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.770
And then there was also join now, right?

45
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.770
And all of those really are kind
of almost primary calls to action.

46
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.061
So really perhaps your action there,

47
00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:56.470
your primary action on your homepage
would be browse our courses.

48
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.606
Then when people are viewing the courses,
that's when you come in and say now join.

49
00:03:01.606 --> 00:03:06.086
But on the homepage we might want to
introduce a secondary call to action for

50
00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:09.924
somebody who's not ready to join yet,
but liked what they saw,

51
00:03:09.924 --> 00:03:14.999
which would be something like, sign up to
tips and advice on front end development.

52
00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:20.000
And they get an email once every month or
something, just reminding

53
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.613
them that the site exists and providing
them with a little bit value as well,

54
00:03:25.613 --> 00:03:31.470
to the point where people are ready
to actually subscribe and join.

55
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.038
So having that kind of two-tier call
to action works extremely well.

56
00:03:36.038 --> 00:03:38.147
The other thing I touched on, and

57
00:03:38.147 --> 00:03:42.967
I touched on this with the Frontend
Masters course and also touched on it when

58
00:03:42.967 --> 00:03:47.582
we were talking about Apple is the need
to have distinct calls to action.

59
00:03:47.582 --> 00:03:52.055
That you know very clearly how
these two courses of action work.

60
00:03:52.055 --> 00:03:58.852
So I was saying that browse courses and
browse learning paths are quite similar.

61
00:03:58.852 --> 00:04:02.456
It's not going to be obvious,
the difference.

62
00:04:02.456 --> 00:04:06.116
Here's the probably the most comical
example I've ever found of that,

63
00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:09.418
having two calls to action buttons
that were extremely similar.

64
00:04:09.418 --> 00:04:11.694
This was on Amazon's iOS app for

65
00:04:11.694 --> 00:04:16.833
a long long time if you tried to buy
an product that wasn't yet released,

66
00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:22.160
you were given two options, preorder
this item today and preorder it now.

67
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.190
Now, you tell me, do you know what
the difference between those two are?

68
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.923
Absolutely not.

69
00:04:26.923 --> 00:04:30.828
Now, turns out, one of them added it to
your basket and then you could check out,

70
00:04:30.828 --> 00:04:33.370
and the other one immediately
took you to check out.

71
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.800
Basically, what had happened there is
some developer had realized, normally,

72
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.700
they would have a button that says add
to basket, and one that says check out,

73
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.500
which is a more logical thing to do.

74
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.133
But when it got changed,
the developer just switched the text,

75
00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:50.608
because it's a preorder, and

76
00:04:50.608 --> 00:04:54.070
you end up with two buttons that
are very similar to one another.

77
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.715
Notice I'm blaming a developer.

78
00:04:55.715 --> 00:05:00.058
It might not be a developer's fault, and
I apologize to developers everywhere, but

79
00:05:00.058 --> 00:05:04.099
it tends to be that kind of scenario where
mistakes are made because the designer

80
00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:06.110
hasn't thought it through properly.

81
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.460
So the developer has to
come up with something.

82
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.180
So that's a great example of where
things can go a little bit wrong.

83
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.523
And you can end up with two calls to
action that are not clearly distinct from

84
00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:16.170
one another.

85
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.880
You can't talk about calls to action
without talking about this idea

86
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.620
of the fold.

87
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.570
Now, this is a really interesting one.

88
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.202
Because there's a lot of argument about
the fold within the design world, and

89
00:05:32.202 --> 00:05:34.770
a lot of people say, well,
the fold doesn't exist.

90
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.595
The idea of a fold comes from the days
of newspapers where they fold

91
00:05:39.595 --> 00:05:42.411
them in half and put them on the stand.

92
00:05:42.411 --> 00:05:48.181
And so you'd always wanna have your
really compelling story on the top half,

93
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:51.488
which would be seen when
it was on the stand.

94
00:05:51.488 --> 00:05:56.469
Now, people argue that on the web there is
no fold because everybody has a different

95
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:59.975
resolution or
the browser open at a different size, etc.

96
00:05:59.975 --> 00:06:05.155
And that is true, there is no specific
point where the fold appears.

97
00:06:05.155 --> 00:06:09.994
However, on everybody's browser,
whatever device you're using,

98
00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:14.260
there is a point where you
have to start scrolling.

99
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.840
And so there is a general kind of view
that your call to action should be high

100
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.251
on the page as a result, so
it can't be missed if people don't scroll.

101
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:29.268
In truth,
it's a lot more complicated than that.

102
00:06:29.268 --> 00:06:34.086
So unfortunately, I can't show you the
actual AB test I ran because of NDAs but

103
00:06:34.086 --> 00:06:38.180
I've kind of mocked it up vaguely
to give you a sense of what we did.

104
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.361
So originally, in the original version,
they had a call to action

105
00:06:42.361 --> 00:06:46.108
that was high on the page, but
it was on the right hand side.

106
00:06:46.108 --> 00:06:51.328
And as I've already said, the right
hand side is not a great position for

107
00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:55.777
calls to action because we tend
not to view that side as much and

108
00:06:55.777 --> 00:06:58.960
we also associate it lot with advertising.

109
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.043
Advertising often is in
the right hand side.

110
00:07:02.043 --> 00:07:05.464
So we decided to move it
to the main column and

111
00:07:05.464 --> 00:07:09.710
lower down on the page,
in the left hand column.

112
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.096
And we saw a 304% increase in conversion,
right?

113
00:07:12.096 --> 00:07:17.750
So even though it was lower on the page,
it tended to perform a lot better.

114
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.320
And this isn't just about
a positioning issue.

115
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.630
It's not just about that the left
hand side is better than the right.

116
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.970
It's also about picking your moment.

117
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.500
I think I might cover this again later.

118
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:35.415
But it's that there is a fundamental
problem that sometimes we go in for

119
00:07:35.415 --> 00:07:38.020
the ask too quickly, right?

120
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.031
It's like when you go to those websites,
when you arrive on the website and

121
00:07:42.031 --> 00:07:46.000
it instantly pops up with,
get 10% off your first order.

122
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.696
Right, and you go, well,
I haven't even seen any products yet,

123
00:07:49.696 --> 00:07:52.074
I don't know if there's anything I like.

124
00:07:52.074 --> 00:07:55.495
So you close the overlay immediately,
right.

125
00:07:55.495 --> 00:07:58.411
Then you navigate around the site,
you find something you want, and

126
00:07:58.411 --> 00:07:59.472
where's my 10% off.

127
00:07:59.472 --> 00:08:02.076
And it's gone because the overlay's gone,

128
00:08:02.076 --> 00:08:04.960
they picked the wrong moment
to ask you to sign up.

129
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.440
And we do this all the time
in calls to action.

130
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.689
So you've got to think about
an appropriate place on the page to put

131
00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:12.740
the calls to action.

132
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:17.179
So although I do tend to have calls
to action high on the page for

133
00:08:17.179 --> 00:08:20.038
returning users that have all
ready made up their mind.

134
00:08:20.038 --> 00:08:24.154
Most of the time I will have
a call to action at least partway,

135
00:08:24.154 --> 00:08:28.997
if not all the way down the content of
a page where people have had a chance

136
00:08:28.997 --> 00:08:34.220
to see everything that I've got
to offer in that particular case.

137
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:39.449
So don't fixate on the fold overly, but
pick the right moment where you think

138
00:08:39.449 --> 00:08:45.430
people have seen enough of the content
in order to make an educated decision.

139
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.981
And then it becomes a matter of ensuring
that people see that call to action at

140
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:50.880
that lower point on the page.

141
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.494
One of the methods you can use
that to do that is white space,

142
00:08:54.494 --> 00:08:57.170
it's an incredibly powerful tool.

143
00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:00.510
But unfortunately,
all the time, clients and

144
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.528
stakeholders like to fill up empty space.

145
00:09:03.528 --> 00:09:09.990
But empty space is a very powerful tool
for drawing your attention to something.

146
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.450
So I'm sure you've experienced it before,
right?

147
00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.030
You can be using your laptop
quite happily, right?

148
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.531
And everything's, fine screen looks great,

149
00:09:21.531 --> 00:09:26.122
and then you come up with a white or
a black, empty page, right.

150
00:09:26.122 --> 00:09:30.682
So your whole screen is white, and
you can see every little speck of dirt

151
00:09:30.682 --> 00:09:35.790
suddenly on it because there's nothing
else to distract you from it, right?

152
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.756
It's all this white and
then a speck of just dirt.

153
00:09:37.756 --> 00:09:41.496
And the reason I use that example right
now is because that's what I'm looking at

154
00:09:41.496 --> 00:09:42.157
on my screen.

155
00:09:42.157 --> 00:09:44.010
Excuse me, there we go.

156
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.379
So you will spot that speck of dirt.

157
00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:52.799
That's the power of negative space, if you
leave a lot of space around something,

158
00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:55.955
there's nothing else to hold the eye,
so the eye settles on

159
00:09:55.955 --> 00:10:00.600
whatever is in the middle of that
empty space, such as a call to action.

160
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.960
So if you leave a lot of empty
space around a call to action,

161
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.368
people are much more likely to notice it.

162
00:10:06.368 --> 00:10:09.326
There are other techniques
available to you as well,

163
00:10:09.326 --> 00:10:11.635
to ensure people notice calls to action.

164
00:10:11.635 --> 00:10:17.776
Color is an obvious one, so
color is a really powerful tool.

165
00:10:17.776 --> 00:10:23.084
If you use a contrasting color
to the rest of the palette,

166
00:10:23.084 --> 00:10:25.855
then it's going to jump out.

167
00:10:25.855 --> 00:10:29.306
And if you think you're a bit rubbish
on color that'ss absolutely fine.

168
00:10:29.306 --> 00:10:32.470
If you go to somewhere
like color.adobe.com and

169
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:36.235
you enter in the kind of default
color that your website is,

170
00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:40.908
probably the corporate color you
are given, it will suggest contrasting

171
00:10:40.908 --> 00:10:45.790
colors that you can use In order
to pop out your call to action.

172
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.148
Now, the only word of warning, and

173
00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:52.704
I'm sure somebody very smug is typing
this into the chat as we speak,

174
00:10:52.704 --> 00:10:57.681
is that something like 1 in 20 men and
1 in 200 women are colorblind.

175
00:10:57.681 --> 00:11:02.090
Which means that we don't all
perceive color in the same way.

176
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.810
Even if you're not colorblind,
we see color slightly differently.

177
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:10.700
So as a result, you can't rely exclusively
on color in order to draw attention, but

178
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.100
it can be a useful secondary tool.

179
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.000
So as you can see here, there's quite
a lot of white space around that Shop Now

180
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.760
button as well as it being
a strong contrasting color.

181
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.279
So alongside color,
another technique that you can use,

182
00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:27.685
because you can't rely solely on color,
is size, really.

183
00:11:27.685 --> 00:11:31.080
And when it comes to calls to action,
bigger is better.

184
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:38.206
It's better because you're more
likely to spot it, which is good,

185
00:11:38.206 --> 00:11:41.015
but it's got a secondary bonus, too,

186
00:11:41.015 --> 00:11:46.220
which is it allows more room to
have a compelling call to action.

187
00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.563
So if you notice on my previous examples,
it's things like Shop Now,

188
00:11:49.563 --> 00:11:52.790
because I don't have a lot
of space to write anything.

189
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.456
And that's fine, but you've got to
remember that people are scanning the page

190
00:11:56.456 --> 00:11:58.520
and reading things out of context.

191
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.365
So calls to action and things like links,

192
00:12:01.365 --> 00:12:05.444
they are often read without
reading the surrounding copy.

193
00:12:05.444 --> 00:12:10.106
And so a term like Shop Now, well, it
tells me that I should buy something, but

194
00:12:10.106 --> 00:12:13.640
it doesn't really help me to
understand what I'm buying or

195
00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.050
what's going on or
what benefit that's gonna provide.

196
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.541
It's like links where it says Read More or
Click Here,

197
00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:25.080
it provides no real
information in its own right.

198
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.108
But if you make your call to action
bigger, you can add more to it,

199
00:12:29.108 --> 00:12:34.650
you can say, for example, buy The Rift
today and become a better gamer, right?

200
00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.790
That's a much more
compelling call to action.

201
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:41.054
Because a, it says what you're buying,
right, what you're gonna get, and

202
00:12:41.054 --> 00:12:44.680
it's communicating the benefit
you get from that.

203
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.852
So bigger and
bolder not only makes it more visible,

204
00:12:47.852 --> 00:12:51.830
it gives you more room to create
some compelling calls to action.

205
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:59.420
One quite popular way of drawing attention
to calls to action is animation.

206
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:05.420
So you can see on this example that
notice the Add to Bag button tethers to

207
00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:11.120
the bottom as as the user scrolls,
so it is effectively animating.

208
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:16.990
Animation does work very well,
it does grab your attention, but

209
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.434
it has its downside.

210
00:13:18.434 --> 00:13:19.952
And its downside is that,

211
00:13:19.952 --> 00:13:24.920
as I'm sure you're already experiencing
as you're watching this now, it's quite

212
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.341
hard to pay attention to what I'm saying
with a looping animation going on.

213
00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:35.973
The movement draws our our attention very,
very strongly, okay.

214
00:13:35.973 --> 00:13:41.848
And so when you have a looping animation
like is going on at the moment,

215
00:13:41.848 --> 00:13:44.646
it shoots up our cognitive load.

216
00:13:44.646 --> 00:13:49.434
And so if you are gonna have an animation
on something like a call to action to

217
00:13:49.434 --> 00:13:54.374
draw attention to it, I suggest that
when someone scrolls, you animate it as

218
00:13:54.374 --> 00:13:59.350
it comes onto the screen,
you animate it then, right, and then stop.

219
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.950
So only animates based on a user
interaction and a user feedback.

220
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.915
Maybe when a user rolls over the button or
when it first comes into view or

221
00:14:06.915 --> 00:14:08.640
that kind of thing.

222
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.450
Be very, very subtle and
understated when you use your animation.

223
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:17.075
And this is another reason why I'm gonna
hate on the the Frontend Masters website

224
00:14:17.075 --> 00:14:21.359
a little bit more as well, because with
their call to action they had a great

225
00:14:21.359 --> 00:14:25.940
solid value proposition, and a great
value proposition at the top of the page.

226
00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.370
But underneath that,
they had a video background.

227
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.500
And video backgrounds have
become very popular now.

228
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.625
But they do increase cognitive load quite
a lot because you're trying to read text

229
00:14:36.625 --> 00:14:40.091
that's over the top of a moving
background, and your eye is flicking

230
00:14:40.091 --> 00:14:44.429
backwards and forwards between two and
it's quite distracting, it's quite hard.

231
00:14:44.429 --> 00:14:48.310
Now, the reason I didn't comment on
that when we were looking at the site Is

232
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.810
because they had the foresight to stop
the video once it played through once.

233
00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:56.091
So by the time I came to comment it,
it actually had stopped moving.

234
00:14:56.091 --> 00:14:59.462
So that's preferable to the endless
loops of video animations.

235
00:14:59.462 --> 00:15:05.044
But generally speaking, those video
backgrounds aren't a great idea.

236
00:15:05.044 --> 00:15:09.232
They take a long time to load, and
they are a constant distraction,

237
00:15:09.232 --> 00:15:12.466
like this animation that's
going in the corner of my

238
00:15:12.466 --> 00:15:15.568
vision all the time I'm
trying to talk to you now.

239
00:15:15.568 --> 00:15:20.184
So I will move on to the next page,
which has also got an animation on.

240
00:15:20.184 --> 00:15:24.168
[LAUGH] But this is to demonstrate
a slightly different point, and

241
00:15:24.168 --> 00:15:28.451
this is the idea of breaking complex
actions down into smaller tasks.

242
00:15:28.451 --> 00:15:33.221
Because not all calls to action are as
simple as click a Shop Now button.

243
00:15:33.221 --> 00:15:37.514
A lot of them are a lot more complicated,
again, if we go back to

244
00:15:37.514 --> 00:15:42.374
the Frontend Masters example,
when we clicked on that Sign Up button,

245
00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:47.241
we had to select the price,
the particular membership that we wanted.

246
00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:51.831
And we then had quite a long form to fill
in that had multiple password fields, and

247
00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:55.409
it also had credit card information
that had to be entered, and

248
00:15:55.409 --> 00:15:57.210
those kinds of things.

249
00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:01.763
When I'm faced with something that's
a little bit longer than like that,

250
00:16:01.763 --> 00:16:04.735
I like to break it into
a series of smaller steps.

251
00:16:04.735 --> 00:16:09.087
It goes back to the chunking that
I was talking about earlier,

252
00:16:09.087 --> 00:16:12.184
to just allow the user
a little bit of time and

253
00:16:12.184 --> 00:16:17.320
space to focus on one task at a time,
to reduce their cognitive load.

254
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.397
You see the same thing done
with customizing products,

255
00:16:20.397 --> 00:16:22.564
like is happening with this bike here.

256
00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:26.513
By making it not a massive
form of drop down list but

257
00:16:26.513 --> 00:16:31.686
an interactive experience you can
work through at your own pace,

258
00:16:31.686 --> 00:16:35.087
it keeps cognitive load more manageable.

259
00:16:35.087 --> 00:16:40.365
And the other thing I would encourage
you to consider when it comes to your

260
00:16:40.365 --> 00:16:46.820
calls to action, to think long and hard
about that post-click experience, right?

261
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:51.050
So let's take a classic example,
like an e-commerce site, right?

262
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:55.404
There is a lot that can still
go wrong when someone says,

263
00:16:55.404 --> 00:16:58.580
I wanna buy this product, right?

264
00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:04.120
So they hit buy now or
they hit add to cart, great, wonderful.

265
00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:09.013
But if you look at statistics, the number
of people that drop out on a shopping

266
00:17:09.013 --> 00:17:12.273
basket page or
a cart page is really, really high.

267
00:17:12.273 --> 00:17:14.802
So we need to think carefully about that,

268
00:17:14.802 --> 00:17:18.936
we need to think carefully about
the payment and checkout process.

269
00:17:18.936 --> 00:17:23.634
Now, that isn't just e-commerce,
I'm talking about things

270
00:17:23.634 --> 00:17:28.338
like bookings of a hotel or or
even submitting a contact us form.

271
00:17:28.338 --> 00:17:31.671
Because it doesn't stop it just cart and
payment checkout process,

272
00:17:31.671 --> 00:17:34.207
then there's the confirmation
email you receive.

273
00:17:34.207 --> 00:17:39.270
That email where, yes,
someone's going to be in touch with you.

274
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.820
Or yes, we've got your order.

275
00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:46.050
And then there's things like dispatch
emails, delivery tracking, delivery text.

276
00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:49.630
All of these things are critical
parts of the experience.

277
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.330
And if you don't get them right,
the result is buyer's remorse.

278
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:57.693
The result is an unhappy client, which
will increase the number of returns and so

279
00:17:57.693 --> 00:18:00.080
you snatch defeat from
the jaws of victory.

280
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:05.955
So this is where very much, you remember
I gave the airline examples where how

281
00:18:05.955 --> 00:18:11.110
informing people and keeping people
informed is absolutely critical?

282
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:16.072
Pay as much attention to what happens
after someone clicks on that button, and

283
00:18:16.072 --> 00:18:21.035
keeping them informed and keeping them
happy as you do, getting them signed up

284
00:18:21.035 --> 00:18:25.610
in the first place, absolutely
critical part of the experience.

285
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:29.714
Because if you get that wrong, not only
are you gonna get more returns, you're

286
00:18:29.714 --> 00:18:33.819
also gonna get more complaints, more
people badmouthing you on social media,

287
00:18:33.819 --> 00:18:37.210
things like that, and
you can undermine the entire experience.

288
00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:41.148
And in my mind,
this is one of the critical differences.

289
00:18:41.148 --> 00:18:45.186
I know a lot of you guys are developers
and maybe you don't consider yourself

290
00:18:45.186 --> 00:18:49.476
designers, but, this in my mind is one of
the critical difference between a user

291
00:18:49.476 --> 00:18:52.341
interface designer and
a user experience designer.

292
00:18:52.341 --> 00:18:55.996
We use those terms like they're
interchangeable, and they're really,

293
00:18:55.996 --> 00:18:56.641
really not.

294
00:18:56.641 --> 00:19:01.020
There's two very different disciplines,
and a user innterface designer

295
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:05.385
is interested in everything we talked
about up to this point, right.

296
00:19:05.385 --> 00:19:07.476
The design, the layout,
all of that kind of stuff.

297
00:19:07.476 --> 00:19:11.148
The user experience designer,
they care about the emails,

298
00:19:11.148 --> 00:19:15.972
the dispatch notifications, the tracking,
and all of these other things that

299
00:19:15.972 --> 00:19:20.724
together make up the experience that
decides whether someone is going to never

300
00:19:20.724 --> 00:19:25.620
buy from you again or become a lifelong
customer that increases lifetime value.

301
00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:32.958
So, yes, so that's all a little bit
about calls, so we've talked about calls

302
00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:38.138
to action, we've talked about leading
users' attention, but I wanna kind

303
00:19:38.138 --> 00:19:43.106
of finish this session by talking
about engaging users with aesthetics.
