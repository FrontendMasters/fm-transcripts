1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.780
So I think to some degree the ethical
argument is a bit of a dead end, okay?

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.706
So I wanna focus on in
this introduction is

3
00:00:10.706 --> 00:00:15.193
really that there are good
business reasons for

4
00:00:15.193 --> 00:00:19.690
not resorting to these
kinds of dark patterns.

5
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.381
And those business reasons
in my opinion are far

6
00:00:24.381 --> 00:00:28.847
more compelling than the ethical argument.

7
00:00:28.847 --> 00:00:34.506
And so I know that this kind of
introduction, this first segment for

8
00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:38.292
today is all quite theoretical, all right?

9
00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:42.685
We haven't looked at any design yet,
we've not looked at any copy yet, or

10
00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:43.959
anything like that.

11
00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:49.628
But making a decision on your approach out
of the gate when you do things like this,

12
00:00:49.628 --> 00:00:55.630
knowing how you're gonna approach it is so
fundamental to success with conversion and

13
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.021
the type of conversion
that you want to achieve.

14
00:00:59.021 --> 00:01:03.279
So understanding where that
line is between what you

15
00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:06.957
are willing to do to
encourage conversion and

16
00:01:06.957 --> 00:01:12.395
what you're not willing to do is
a really important lying to walk.

17
00:01:12.395 --> 00:01:14.790
You need to know where that is.

18
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.588
And so I think it's really important
you understand the consequences if

19
00:01:19.588 --> 00:01:22.980
you start to stray into
the world of dark patterns.

20
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.541
So let's look at these
three business reasons.

21
00:01:26.541 --> 00:01:32.585
Reason number 1 is a consumers
are cynical, savvy, and spoilt for choice.

22
00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:37.230
So you remember that I mentioned
booking.com a minute ago.

23
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.810
So this is a screen grab from booking.com.

24
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.720
And it uses scarcity, right?

25
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.085
This idea that scares the primal brain,
the fact that something is gonna run out,

26
00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:53.150
there's not gonna be enough resources,
okay?

27
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.868
So for example, it says, there's
only six rooms left on our site for

28
00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:03.716
this, and this deal is gonna
expire in 11 hours, okay?

29
00:02:03.716 --> 00:02:06.364
And 21 other people
are looking at this room.

30
00:02:06.364 --> 00:02:11.512
All of those things are designed to
create a sense of panic in you, right?

31
00:02:11.512 --> 00:02:14.130
That if you don't act soon,
you're gonna miss out on the opportunity.

32
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.388
First of all, let's make it clear.

33
00:02:16.388 --> 00:02:19.560
This works without a doubt, right?

34
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.060
It will increase conversion rates, okay?

35
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.920
And manipulating people
in this way does work.

36
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.700
Yet, there were consequences for
it working.

37
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.124
And there is an assumption that people
often make that because it works,

38
00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:44.359
therefore, users must be unaware
that they're being manipulated.

39
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.430
But that is actually not the case, okay?

40
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.389
System two, our conscious minds can be
completely aware of what's going on,

41
00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:59.047
but being undermined in our decision
making, influence to know decision

42
00:02:59.047 --> 00:03:04.805
making process by that older part of our
brain, that primal part of our brain.

43
00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:11.135
And this came out in usability testing
that I've run on exactly this site, right?

44
00:03:11.135 --> 00:03:16.070
So I decided to run some usability
testing to see how people responded

45
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.425
to booking.com and the process of booking.

46
00:03:19.425 --> 00:03:23.048
And this is what one
user subjects said to me.

47
00:03:23.048 --> 00:03:24.969
I hate all of this manipulative crap,

48
00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:28.818
I don't know whether I'm allowed to
say that but that's what the guy said.

49
00:03:28.818 --> 00:03:35.673
Trying to convince me the room is about to
sell out, I just ignore that stuff, right?

50
00:03:35.673 --> 00:03:41.813
So the power of dark patterns isn't
that people don't aren't aware of them,

51
00:03:41.813 --> 00:03:46.480
it's the fact that they think
they can ignore them, okay?

52
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.765
But in truth,
they're being influenced by them anyway.

53
00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:57.798
So let's be clear, people know you're
attempting to manipulate them,

54
00:03:57.798 --> 00:04:00.440
and that has big consequences.

55
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.252
Not only for which, over time,
you get to a situation where

56
00:04:05.252 --> 00:04:09.497
people become increasingly
disgruntled about it.

57
00:04:09.497 --> 00:04:11.356
There's more and more talk about it.

58
00:04:11.356 --> 00:04:15.757
There's more and more complaints about it,
and it starts to have real impact.

59
00:04:15.757 --> 00:04:20.805
It gets to the point where even government
bodies start to take awareness of this.

60
00:04:20.805 --> 00:04:26.490
So the CMA in the UK are a consumer
rights body, government body.

61
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.788
And the CMA have taken enforcement action
to bring to an end misleading sales

62
00:04:30.788 --> 00:04:32.600
tactics, hidden charges, and

63
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.470
other practices in the online
hotel booking market.

64
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.190
They might as well have said booking.com,
right?

65
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.320
These are wholly unacceptable.

66
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.710
So dark patterns have
long term consequences.

67
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.972
And if users are aware that
they're being manipulated,

68
00:04:53.972 --> 00:05:00.150
you can alienate them very quickly,
and they can easily go elsewhere.

69
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.050
After all,

70
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.000
there are literally hundreds of thousands
of sites that offer hotel booking.

71
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.740
Now, you might go, well, hang on a minute,
booking.com is very successful.

72
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.190
So obviously, that's not the case there.

73
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.013
And as I did research into this,

74
00:05:19.013 --> 00:05:24.148
I was discovering that actually
the reason people liked booking.com and

75
00:05:24.148 --> 00:05:28.058
kept using booking.com was
because it was easy to use.

76
00:05:28.058 --> 00:05:34.440
Because they knew it, they understood it,
because they've been using it before.

77
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.939
And so the success of
the site was despite the dark

78
00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:42.690
patterns not because of them, okay?

79
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.930
People kept using it for other reasons,
other things they liked about the site.

80
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.936
And it's interesting to note that
the reason that they did keep using it was

81
00:05:50.936 --> 00:05:52.750
still a psychological one.

82
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.320
It was easy.

83
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.580
They didn't have to think.

84
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.961
So it can get really quite interesting
quite quickly once we realize

85
00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:08.760
that users are aware when we're
attempting to manipulate them.

86
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.540
Because we can quickly use them and
quickly alienate them.

87
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.369
And that can mean that you might get some
short-term improvements in conversion,

88
00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:23.032
but long-term, you're gonna find
it increasingly difficult to

89
00:06:23.032 --> 00:06:26.040
maintain those customer relationships.

90
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.556
Add to that, the one disgruntled customer
can seriously undermine a brand,

91
00:06:32.556 --> 00:06:36.010
and you get into some real problem areas.

92
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.870
So I mean, the obvious power that
consumers now have is that they

93
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.150
can write reviews about you, right?

94
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.300
They can write reviews about
your products and services.

95
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.155
And when there's a lot of people that
feel that they're being manipulated,

96
00:06:51.155 --> 00:06:54.240
that feel they're being tricked
into doing stuff, when they

97
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.690
start to come together and they start
to complain, it causes real problems.

98
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.787
So one of the great examples of this
happened all the way back in the late 90s,

99
00:07:03.787 --> 00:07:07.340
where one blogger wrote a blog
post called My Del Hell,

100
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.570
about their terrible experience with Dell.

101
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.030
And that galvanized a community of other
people who've had terrible experiences,

102
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.260
and it knocked a third
off of Dell share price.

103
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.992
That's how big a difference this kind
of thing can make when you annoy your

104
00:07:22.992 --> 00:07:27.170
potential customers or
your existing customers.

105
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.432
But even one customer in isolation
can cause all kinds of problems

106
00:07:31.432 --> 00:07:33.510
if they're not happy.

107
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.590
Take the case of Hasan Syed, right?

108
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.464
He is my hero, this guy.

109
00:07:38.464 --> 00:07:43.040
Hasan Syed had some problems
with British Airways.

110
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.214
I won't get into what they were,
it's somewhat irrelevant.

111
00:07:47.214 --> 00:07:48.044
But he got so

112
00:07:48.044 --> 00:07:53.291
annoyed with British Airways that he
decided to take out a promoted tweet.

113
00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:58.361
Which meant that whenever anybody talked
about British Airways on Twitter,

114
00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:03.899
when anybody mentioned British Airways,
they got back a promoted tweet that read,

115
00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:09.520
don't fly with British Airways, their
customer experience is horrendous, okay?

116
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.684
Now, this got picked up by Mashable and
the other tech blogs, and

117
00:08:15.684 --> 00:08:20.731
then it got picked up by the BBC and
Fox News and all of these news outlets.

118
00:08:20.731 --> 00:08:26.520
And one upset client or
customer caused the major PR disaster.

119
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:32.750
So you walk a very dangerous line when you
start trying to manipulate your audience.

120
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:37.364
And you can get into
situations like Facebook have,

121
00:08:37.364 --> 00:08:41.509
who were carrying out psychological
experiments on their user,

122
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:45.071
where they got called up in
front of Congress over this.

123
00:08:45.071 --> 00:08:47.914
It can be an enormous problem.

124
00:08:47.914 --> 00:08:52.687
But probably,
the biggest reason to avoid these kinds of

125
00:08:52.687 --> 00:08:56.775
manipulative techniques
is buyer's remorse.

126
00:08:56.775 --> 00:09:01.419
Because buyer's remorse costs
your business a lot more

127
00:09:01.419 --> 00:09:03.660
than you think it does.

128
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.200
So let me give you a real
world example of this.

129
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.990
I worked with an e-commerce brand
that sold consumer electronics.

130
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.529
And one of their biggest
sellers was a kettle,

131
00:09:14.529 --> 00:09:20.720
not exactly the most exciting thing in
the world, but it was their lead product.

132
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:26.172
And the ECOM team was under
increasing pressure to improve

133
00:09:26.172 --> 00:09:32.969
their conversion rate or average order
value I think it was year on year.

134
00:09:32.969 --> 00:09:36.619
Every year, they were expected to
increase it more and more and more.

135
00:09:36.619 --> 00:09:40.870
And of course, that gets harder and
harder to do over time.

136
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:44.486
So they started turning to
dark patterns to do this.

137
00:09:44.486 --> 00:09:49.957
And one of dark patterns that they
employed was automatically adding

138
00:09:49.957 --> 00:09:56.760
kettle filters, this kettle had filters to
stop limescale building up or whatever.

139
00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:01.181
And they would automatically add
someone to the basket, right?

140
00:10:01.181 --> 00:10:02.925
And of course, people are lazy, and

141
00:10:02.925 --> 00:10:06.440
they don't pay attention because
they rely on system one, right?

142
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.792
And so as a result, they would miss that,
and end up paying more than they thought

143
00:10:10.792 --> 00:10:14.260
because they're getting these
kettle filters as well.

144
00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.531
And of course, they were brand kettle
filters that were overpriced compared to

145
00:10:18.531 --> 00:10:21.410
the off-brand ones that you
could pick up on Amazon.

146
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:27.435
So when I came in and I started working
with them, I kind of flagged this as

147
00:10:27.435 --> 00:10:31.910
a potential issue, and they said,
yes, it was very successful,

148
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:35.740
we managed to increase our
order value quite considerably.

149
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.764
But as I began to investigate, I found
out that there were consequences to that.

150
00:10:42.764 --> 00:10:47.427
And this happens all the time that when
you manipulate a customer into doing

151
00:10:47.427 --> 00:10:50.683
something, they're obviously
not happy when they

152
00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:54.472
eventually realize they've been tricked or
manipulated.

153
00:10:54.472 --> 00:10:56.742
And that leads to hidden costs.

154
00:10:56.742 --> 00:11:01.651
So the UX or ECOM team or whatever you
want to to call them, they were happy

155
00:11:01.651 --> 00:11:06.574
because they'd improve their
conversion rate or average order value.

156
00:11:06.574 --> 00:11:08.711
So they were over the moon.

157
00:11:08.711 --> 00:11:12.209
But they weren't communicating with
the rest of the business very well.

158
00:11:12.209 --> 00:11:16.980
And so you had the marketing department
that were actually finding it,

159
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.526
their marketing costs were going up,

160
00:11:19.526 --> 00:11:23.940
they were having to do a lot more
in order to win new customers.

161
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.831
And when you did a little
bit of a search online,

162
00:11:26.831 --> 00:11:31.535
you found out why the existing customers
were moaning about the company, and

163
00:11:31.535 --> 00:11:34.736
about their manipulative techniques,
etcetera.

164
00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:40.400
So there was a hidden cost there
of an increased marketing cost.

165
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.364
Add to that, there were also a lot of
people ringing up support and going, well,

166
00:11:45.364 --> 00:11:48.440
hang on a minute,
I didn't order these filters.

167
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.440
Why have I been charged for these filters?

168
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:57.083
Now, the irony there is that every
time somebody called the call center,

169
00:11:57.083 --> 00:12:01.610
it was costing £3.62 as I remember, okay?

170
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:07.114
The profit margin on the filters was
considerably less than that, right?

171
00:12:07.114 --> 00:12:10.403
So they were actually losing
money as a company because so

172
00:12:10.403 --> 00:12:13.554
many people were calling up saying,
hang on a minute,

173
00:12:13.554 --> 00:12:17.132
I didn't order these filters,
I don't want these filters.

174
00:12:17.132 --> 00:12:22.596
And then of course,
they have to be returned to restocked.

175
00:12:22.596 --> 00:12:25.889
And so
the number of returns was increasing and

176
00:12:25.889 --> 00:12:28.430
the administration of all of that.

177
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:29.684
So as you can see,

178
00:12:29.684 --> 00:12:35.770
this kind of manipulation can really
backfire on you if you're not careful.

179
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:40.580
So all of that was really
a very long disclaimer, okay?

180
00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:45.627
But hopefully, it's a disclaimer that it's
worthwhile to you, because the chances

181
00:12:45.627 --> 00:12:49.927
are you come across people that wanna
do this kind of manipulative stuff.

182
00:12:49.927 --> 00:12:53.362
And now, you've got a little bit
of an argument to take to them

183
00:12:53.362 --> 00:12:58.073
as to why they shouldn't do it, that is
more than, well, it's just wrong, okay?

184
00:12:58.073 --> 00:13:01.535
So I'm hoping you feel in a better
position to handle that kind of stuff.

185
00:13:03.005 --> 00:13:05.944
But you wanna create sites for
your clients and

186
00:13:05.944 --> 00:13:10.625
your stakeholders that do allow
people to increase conversion, right?

187
00:13:10.625 --> 00:13:12.600
It does encourage action.

188
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:17.898
So what different psychological methods
can you use if you can't play off of

189
00:13:17.898 --> 00:13:23.910
scarcity, if you can add things to people
shopping baskets, and all this stuff?

190
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.540
What can you do that makes a difference?

191
00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.843
And these four psychological principles
are the ones that we're gonna be carrying

192
00:13:30.843 --> 00:13:32.760
through for the rest of this course.
