WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.073 --> 00:00:04.631
Okay, so before we jump into
the final section for today.

2
00:00:04.631 --> 00:00:10.379
I wanted to pause a moment and address
a question that came in via the chat,

3
00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.010
which is what do I think
about web checklists?

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.500
And the user in question shared a
particular checklists he'd come across and

5
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.721
asked me why I thought of it I
mean the truth is I haven't seen

6
00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:25.333
this particular one.

7
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.976
I mean there are a lot of
these checklists around and

8
00:00:28.976 --> 00:00:31.857
I've got no problem with them I think for

9
00:00:31.857 --> 00:00:37.470
a lot of people it's very helpful to have,
a checklist they can work through.

10
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.131
And be really confident they've
ticked all the boxes and

11
00:00:40.131 --> 00:00:42.134
covered everything that needs to be done.

12
00:00:42.134 --> 00:00:47.933
I think my only problem with
checklists is that they can become

13
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:53.854
out of date quite quickly because
the web moves at quite a pace.

14
00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:59.113
And you can end up continuing to kind
of mindlessly follow a particular

15
00:00:59.113 --> 00:01:03.761
routine that isn't necessarily
correct any more up to date.

16
00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:07.519
And the other aspect to them and this one
happens to be a good example of that is

17
00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:09.417
that they can be quite intimidating.

18
00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:15.111
There are 240 rules that must be
followed and I think depending

19
00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:21.958
on who's having to use this checklist
that can be quite inaccessible to them.

20
00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:27.680
Often, for example, I see developers or
designers ditch it to people generally

21
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.835
graying this checklist especially for non
digital people and, I have to create them.

22
00:01:33.835 --> 00:01:37.216
I create playbooks all the time
which contain this kind of thing in.

23
00:01:37.216 --> 00:01:40.398
And they can be quite intimidating for
people that don't

24
00:01:40.398 --> 00:01:44.847
work regularly in digital and so that
just don't bother and they abandon them.

25
00:01:44.847 --> 00:01:48.845
So making them accessible, easy to
understand, applying all the same rules,

26
00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:52.082
really, that we've talked about
today in terms of usability.

27
00:01:52.082 --> 00:01:56.062
Find the bility scannability all of that
kind of stuff is just as important with

28
00:01:56.062 --> 00:01:59.156
something like this where
there's 240 rules involved.

29
00:01:59.156 --> 00:02:04.985
But in principle I think they're great so
couple of people submitted sites for

30
00:02:04.985 --> 00:02:09.930
us to learn look at we've got
the Texas State University website,

31
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.329
and I can't even focus on that.

32
00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:15.097
That text the Christian
something Christian University.

33
00:02:15.097 --> 00:02:17.417
Wow, my eyesight is going.

34
00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:20.064
So let's have a quick look at these.

35
00:02:20.064 --> 00:02:23.690
Interestingly, I always seem
to attract a lot of higher

36
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.791
education websites in these sessions and
look at a lot of them.

37
00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:32.771
Which is very fortunate because higher
education sites I've worked on over

38
00:02:32.771 --> 00:02:35.746
30 higher education sites over the years.

39
00:02:35.746 --> 00:02:40.603
And I've kind of learned
the nuances of the challenges

40
00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:44.834
that they face and
they are many and extensive.

41
00:02:44.834 --> 00:02:49.871
And one of the big challenges
that universities face

42
00:02:49.871 --> 00:02:56.752
is the fact that they are trying to
appeal to many different audiences.

43
00:02:56.752 --> 00:02:59.627
From a 18 year old undergraduate,

44
00:02:59.627 --> 00:03:05.299
a prospective undergraduate all
the way through to business partners.

45
00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.773
In the commercial sector to
postgraduate students, researchers,

46
00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:12.560
academics, all these different people.

47
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.655
And as a result,
their websites are often this kinda,

48
00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:21.462
they almost give up on the idea of
providing any kind of journey or

49
00:03:21.462 --> 00:03:27.801
any kind of experiences stayed become
these massive repositories of information.

50
00:03:27.801 --> 00:03:36.051
And from the looks of of this it's it's
beginning to tackle some of these issues.

51
00:03:36.051 --> 00:03:38.846
So is obviously saying front and

52
00:03:38.846 --> 00:03:43.607
center that you're Europe
that your plan is that is for

53
00:03:43.607 --> 00:03:49.421
students and it's putting
the emphasis on things like applying.

54
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:50.449
And majors and

55
00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:56.537
degrees is not getting too distracted by
secondary audiences which is a good thing.

56
00:03:56.537 --> 00:04:01.222
However, often it's a matter
of actually breaking these

57
00:04:01.222 --> 00:04:05.249
audiences down into almost
different sub sites.

58
00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:08.598
So that you can cater more
specifically for them so

59
00:04:08.598 --> 00:04:12.506
have sites that are aimed just
at the business community or

60
00:04:12.506 --> 00:04:16.992
just at academics in pairs and
research and those kinds of things.

61
00:04:16.992 --> 00:04:20.651
Quite nice simple navigation,
not too many navigational items going on.

62
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:27.111
One thing is we've got this navigation
bar that's a fixed navigation bar.

63
00:04:27.111 --> 00:04:31.304
I've got very mixed feelings about these
things in some ways it's quite nice to

64
00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:33.571
have the navigational wisdom available.

65
00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:38.003
But you can quite easily start using
up quite considerable real estate.

66
00:04:38.003 --> 00:04:40.668
It's not too bad on desktops but

67
00:04:40.668 --> 00:04:45.517
on mobile fixed navigation
becomes really problematic.

68
00:04:45.517 --> 00:04:51.409
So again we don't have a strong
value proposition here it's

69
00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:58.927
the emphasis is very much that everybody's
back on campus now off the COVID.

70
00:04:58.927 --> 00:05:04.693
But why Texas state of all the
universities I could go to I'm not really

71
00:05:04.693 --> 00:05:10.383
fight him to hearing why I should
pick this place over so many others.

72
00:05:10.383 --> 00:05:14.905
And as I scroll down I'm still
not really seeing that classic

73
00:05:14.905 --> 00:05:19.968
examples that I see all the time
in higher education institutions.

74
00:05:19.968 --> 00:05:23.415
We were founded in 1899 and
we've been around a long time.

75
00:05:23.415 --> 00:05:25.486
I don't care, right?

76
00:05:25.486 --> 00:05:29.637
And the average student doesn't
care that's in the past.

77
00:05:29.637 --> 00:05:30.868
What about now?

78
00:05:30.868 --> 00:05:32.228
What are you gonna provide me?

79
00:05:32.228 --> 00:05:35.552
What of my chances of getting
a job at the end of it.

80
00:05:35.552 --> 00:05:39.851
Do you have the course that I
want those kinds of things.

81
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:45.250
And because there's this attitude within
universities of what we've got so

82
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.328
much information to share which gonna
put it all online in a logical way.

83
00:05:50.328 --> 00:05:55.083
That actually you just end up with these
verbose sites with far too much content

84
00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:59.924
about all the wrong things, instead you
need to start with the user questions.

85
00:05:59.924 --> 00:06:01.284
What do users wanna know?

86
00:06:01.284 --> 00:06:02.972
What do they care about and

87
00:06:02.972 --> 00:06:08.508
structure around that in the hierarchical
way that we've been talking about so far.

88
00:06:08.508 --> 00:06:13.374
Another typical mistake that
I see universities make and

89
00:06:13.374 --> 00:06:16.421
I'm seeing this on both websites.

90
00:06:16.421 --> 00:06:21.631
I'm seeing it here, and I was seeing
it over on this bit here is that

91
00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:26.951
they're talking about themselves and
how great they are, right?

92
00:06:26.951 --> 00:06:29.178
And I see this on a lot of sites.

93
00:06:29.178 --> 00:06:34.643
They're talking about how great they
are and no what they can do for the user.

94
00:06:34.643 --> 00:06:39.400
Now I'm, in some ways this is great
because it's providing a little bit of

95
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.447
social proof and credibility.

96
00:06:41.447 --> 00:06:43.610
but to lead with that, so

97
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:49.073
strongly is basically the homepage
is saying, we're great.

98
00:06:49.073 --> 00:06:52.234
Well done, but what can you give me?

99
00:06:52.234 --> 00:06:53.104
How can you help me?

100
00:06:53.104 --> 00:06:58.000
How does that translate into my life and
what I have.

101
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.619
Then we've got a video playing,
which maybe creates a bit of

102
00:07:02.619 --> 00:07:07.520
a feel of the facilities that
you've got and that kind of thing.

103
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.694
But there's I'm not hearing anything.

104
00:07:09.694 --> 00:07:10.751
I'm not learning anything.

105
00:07:10.751 --> 00:07:18.929
I'm just seeing some pretty pictures And
then yeah.

106
00:07:18.929 --> 00:07:22.139
Then another problem you
often see on sites is that

107
00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:24.969
they're broken down into the hierarchical

108
00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:29.877
structure of the organization rather
than in the way that the use of things.

109
00:07:29.877 --> 00:07:33.737
So, this is all now broken
down into colleges, right?

110
00:07:33.737 --> 00:07:38.207
Well, you don't come as a prospective
undergraduate don't come to a website and

111
00:07:38.207 --> 00:07:41.729
going I want to know more about
the College of Biblical studies.

112
00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:48.718
You go I want to study theology or I want
to study evangelism or whatever it be.

113
00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:53.332
As a subject matter, so you don't
think in terms of colleges, colleges

114
00:07:53.332 --> 00:07:58.417
are meaningful for existing students and
they're meaningful for academics.

115
00:07:58.417 --> 00:08:01.682
But they're not meaningful for
prospective students.

116
00:08:01.682 --> 00:08:05.642
Now the inevitable response to that
is our yes but existing students and

117
00:08:05.642 --> 00:08:07.424
academics are important to us.

118
00:08:07.424 --> 00:08:11.116
Sure, then deal with them separately,
all right?

119
00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:14.370
Don't try and do everything
on the front end site and it.

120
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:18.873
And you can see this here
that you often have links to

121
00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:22.748
internal systems that
users can click on and

122
00:08:22.748 --> 00:08:28.627
then they can't log into it cuz
they're not an existing student.

123
00:08:28.627 --> 00:08:32.019
Separate out existing students and
existing staff and

124
00:08:32.019 --> 00:08:34.389
academics from your marketing site.

125
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:36.817
The two are very different roads.

126
00:08:36.817 --> 00:08:38.961
You shouldn't try and
combine them all together.

127
00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:42.027
And that's where a good
intranet should come in.

128
00:08:42.027 --> 00:08:46.635
Another problem that I see on
a lot of university sites and

129
00:08:46.635 --> 00:08:50.772
I suspect these are both examples of that,
right?

130
00:08:50.772 --> 00:08:53.623
Is news stories, right?

131
00:08:53.623 --> 00:08:55.609
I would encourage you to
look at your analytics and

132
00:08:55.609 --> 00:08:58.509
look at the number of people that
are actually reading the news stories.

133
00:08:58.509 --> 00:09:03.367
The chances are nobody cares,
nobody reads those news stories.

134
00:09:03.367 --> 00:09:06.166
And again I see this not
just on university sites but

135
00:09:06.166 --> 00:09:07.671
across the board, right?

136
00:09:07.671 --> 00:09:10.825
You don't wake up one morning and
go I want to read the sexist.

137
00:09:10.825 --> 00:09:14.115
To Texas State News University, right?

138
00:09:14.115 --> 00:09:17.039
We don't read websites like that.

139
00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:19.051
Heck, I run a blog, and

140
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:24.193
people don't just turn up to my
site to read the latest news.

141
00:09:24.193 --> 00:09:27.424
They arrive after maybe searching
on a particular problem or

142
00:09:27.424 --> 00:09:30.666
challenge they face and
come to a blog post the answers that.

143
00:09:30.666 --> 00:09:34.665
But that the news itself
provides very little value

144
00:09:34.665 --> 00:09:39.452
in encouraging people to
subscribe to the university.

145
00:09:39.452 --> 00:09:46.833
Yes, but they might want to know that Dr.
Ann works at our institution, will they?

146
00:09:46.833 --> 00:09:51.552
And even if they knew who that person was,
is that gonna swing their decision

147
00:09:51.552 --> 00:09:54.807
making or
is it just more noise that is distracting.

148
00:09:54.807 --> 00:09:59.635
So with university sites is almost always
the good starting point is to go through

149
00:09:59.635 --> 00:10:03.474
each of these elements just like
I said and simplify them and go.

150
00:10:03.474 --> 00:10:11.022
If we remove that, would it reduce
the number of people signing up, right?

151
00:10:11.022 --> 00:10:14.936
It may be a little bit different in
the States because I know that you're mad

152
00:10:14.936 --> 00:10:18.120
about your football in college
football it's a huge thing.

153
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:23.460
But really great you've got
a successful football team but

154
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:28.374
I'm talking about studying
humanities you've got to

155
00:10:28.374 --> 00:10:32.769
again even more with this
kind of featured news.

156
00:10:34.692 --> 00:10:39.338
Former FBI agent heads new online criminal
justice program that's great if I'm

157
00:10:39.338 --> 00:10:43.108
studying criminal justice but
this is on your homepage, right?

158
00:10:43.108 --> 00:10:45.584
And I could be studying anything else.

159
00:10:45.584 --> 00:10:50.019
So why don't you put this information on
the criminal justice page because then

160
00:10:50.019 --> 00:10:51.020
it's relevant.

161
00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.736
So thinking about your visual hierarchy,
simplifying, and

162
00:10:54.736 --> 00:10:59.174
removing unnecessary information,
focusing on people's questions.

163
00:10:59.174 --> 00:11:03.913
Presenting the right information at the
right time is also much more critical and

164
00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:06.500
just to be frank whatever university does.

165
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:11.797
And I'm not just picking on these people
vomiting everything onto the homepage

166
00:11:11.797 --> 00:11:16.394
because every person wants their
bit of real estate on the homepage.

167
00:11:16.394 --> 00:11:19.475
And everybody's arguing about this
is the good, great example of

168
00:11:19.475 --> 00:11:22.950
how you should be running something
like a user attention point exercise.

169
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.603
To focus all of those people
with all of their egos and

170
00:11:25.603 --> 00:11:28.680
all those academics that want
their slice of the homepage and

171
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.373
forcing them to prioritize what's
important within the institution.
