00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.646
Okay, so let's look at 4
psychological principles that you can

2
00:00:04.646 --> 00:00:09.174
actually use that's gonna help
you engage with your audience and

3
00:00:09.174 --> 00:00:12.100
encourage them to take action.

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.691
The first one I wanna look at is
the need to address objections and

5
00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:19.079
reduce risk in people's minds.

6
00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:24.006
Because that is absolutely fundamental
to your success, if you wanna encourage

7
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:28.571
people to act on your website whether
that's sign up for your newsletter or

8
00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:32.716
download your site or your product,
I was gonna say a SaaS product.

9
00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:37.437
You don't download one of those or
buy something on an E commerce site,

10
00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:42.161
addressing people's fears and
concerns is fundamental to success and

11
00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:46.745
that's all because of this guy,
again, the primal brain, right?

12
00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:52.246
Because the primal brain is
constantly looking for danger, right?

13
00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:57.196
Unfortunately, it's not really got much
work to do these days, well, I don't know

14
00:00:57.196 --> 00:01:01.945
what I'm saying unfortunately,
it's quite opposite, it's fortunately that

15
00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:06.662
we're not about to be leapt on by a saber
toothed tiger at any particular moment.

16
00:01:06.662 --> 00:01:11.176
But the result of that, is that it's
kind of flailing around looking for

17
00:01:11.176 --> 00:01:13.480
dangers that aren't really there.

18
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.112
And so,
it starts to grab hold of anything,

19
00:01:16.112 --> 00:01:19.730
anything that could
potentially be seen as a risk.

20
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:27.920
So let's take a really classic example,
like signing up for newsletter.

21
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.403
So I've mocked up a particularly
manipulative newsletter sign up here that

22
00:01:32.403 --> 00:01:34.740
says yes, I'd like a good deal.

23
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.100
And then the other option is
no I prefer to waste money.

24
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.755
But obviously that is exactly
what you shouldn't be doing,

25
00:01:41.755 --> 00:01:43.840
but what can be illustrated here?

26
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.566
Is that, that actually the primal
brain when it's faced with

27
00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:54.343
something like this goes into
overdrive of looking for concerns and

28
00:01:54.343 --> 00:01:58.613
dangers and worries, so
let me just give you a few examples,

29
00:01:58.613 --> 00:02:02.870
what if they sell my email
address to a third party?

30
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.213
Right, that's a concern that goes through
our head not necessarily consciously, but

31
00:02:07.213 --> 00:02:11.830
it's there nagging away in the back of our
brains, or what if the contents rubbish?

32
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.119
Right, and it's not relevant to me,
or what if they make it hard for

33
00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:18.220
me to unsubscribe?

34
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.381
Another common one is what
they send me too many emails,

35
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:23.338
it's really annoying isn't it?

36
00:02:23.338 --> 00:02:28.114
When you sign up to a newsletter and
they just bombard you with emails, and

37
00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:31.286
what if they pressure me
into buying something?

38
00:02:31.286 --> 00:02:36.490
All of these are negatives objections
problems that put us off of signing up

39
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:43.270
to newsletters, and then of course there's
Wi-Fi get hacked or Wi-Fi get hacked.

40
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.402
So, dealing with these risks and

41
00:02:45.402 --> 00:02:49.974
objections that are whirling around
in people's heads consciously or

42
00:02:49.974 --> 00:02:55.077
subconsciously, is so important when it
comes to giving people the confidence

43
00:02:55.077 --> 00:02:59.900
to sign up to your newsletter or
whatever else you're asking people to do.

44
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.890
The problem here is that we're often
afraid to address these objections for

45
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.760
fear of bringing them up.

46
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.730
So really classic example of this.

47
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.812
If you've ever done any design work,
right?

48
00:03:13.812 --> 00:03:16.698
And you've done a design mock up for
a client and

49
00:03:16.698 --> 00:03:19.367
you've got to present it to the client,
and

50
00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:24.372
you know that there's something in
the design the client doesn't want, right?

51
00:03:24.372 --> 00:03:27.936
Won't like, maybe that they're gonna
go the logos not big enough or

52
00:03:27.936 --> 00:03:30.402
they're not gonna like the color or
whatever.

53
00:03:30.402 --> 00:03:34.603
But what we often do is we go into those
meetings and we go, don't mention it,

54
00:03:34.603 --> 00:03:39.276
don't mention it, don't mention it, you
kind of hope that they don't bring it up.

55
00:03:39.276 --> 00:03:41.072
And of course, inevitably they do.

56
00:03:41.072 --> 00:03:43.860
And that's kind of what
we do on our websites.

57
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.700
I hope they don't have this problem with
it, or, and so we don't address them.

58
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.402
But just as it's much better with
a client to actually come out and

59
00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:59.450
talk about the problem in advance
the same is true on websites.

60
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.548
So let's take a really classic example
right which is McDonald's, okay?

61
00:04:05.548 --> 00:04:12.370
We have all heard things about McDonald's,
haven't we, right?

62
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.590
And about their food.

63
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.500
We've all heard things
like chicken nuggets.

64
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.880
They may contain chicken, but we're not
gonna say which parts of the chicken.

65
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.788
Okay, there is this implication that
chicken nuggets have got dodgy bits of

66
00:04:25.788 --> 00:04:30.312
chicken in or that french fries don't
actually contain any potato but

67
00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:34.005
they're all these kind of
myths that are flying around.

68
00:04:34.005 --> 00:04:39.504
Now, McDonald's are clever enough to know
that they need to address those objections

69
00:04:39.504 --> 00:04:44.476
and address those concerns, they don't
come out and say it that blatantly but

70
00:04:44.476 --> 00:04:50.630
what they do say on their website is,
it's always 100% chicken breast meat.

71
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.448
And in fact, if you click through that and
find out more that the expanded title

72
00:04:55.448 --> 00:05:00.193
there is it's always 100% chicken
breast meat even on chicken nuggets,

73
00:05:00.193 --> 00:05:02.910
it actually says even our chicken nuggets.

74
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.844
So McDonald's have had the confidence
to address those objections head on and

75
00:05:07.844 --> 00:05:12.552
that's really what we need to be doing
when it comes to our calls to action,

76
00:05:12.552 --> 00:05:15.450
when it comes to our value propositions.

77
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.380
So going back to the newsletter example,
let me show you my own newsletter on one

78
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.630
version of my newsletter cuz
I do a lot of AB testing.

79
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.337
Everything about my call to action
to encourage people to sign

80
00:05:27.337 --> 00:05:31.558
up to my newsletter on my website is
designed to deal with objections.

81
00:05:31.558 --> 00:05:37.152
So for example I say how often they'll
be emailed every 2 weeks, right?

82
00:05:37.152 --> 00:05:41.299
You will receive support improving your
site by creating a better user experience

83
00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:43.173
a more effective digital strategy.

84
00:05:43.173 --> 00:05:46.273
So I actually explain what
the content is gonna be as well and

85
00:05:46.273 --> 00:05:48.390
how it's gonna benefit people.

86
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.772
But then I go on and say,
you can unsubscribe in one click, and

87
00:05:52.772 --> 00:05:56.930
we will never share your
email address with anybody.

88
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.898
So everything there is about dealing with
those objections and concerns people

89
00:06:01.898 --> 00:06:07.050
have at the moment that they're
making the decision to take action.

90
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.852
And so that is this idea of addressing
these objections and concerns is so

91
00:06:11.852 --> 00:06:17.060
important to your success and we'll get
into that all a little bit more later.

92
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.703
The other thing that you can do when
it comes to addressing these objections

93
00:06:22.703 --> 00:06:27.863
because sometimes the objection isn't
something that you can overcome, right?

94
00:06:27.863 --> 00:06:30.915
Sometimes there are certain
objections kinda baked

95
00:06:30.915 --> 00:06:34.448
into the experience that there's
no way of dealing with, so

96
00:06:34.448 --> 00:06:38.484
your alternative approach is to
make it a risk worth taking, right?

97
00:06:38.484 --> 00:06:42.754
So people will object to spending the
money for example and obviously you're not

98
00:06:42.754 --> 00:06:47.180
gonna give the product away for free,
so they're gonna have to suck that up.

99
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.842
But what you can do is make it so
obvious that it's a great,

100
00:06:51.842 --> 00:06:55.970
it's an objection worth dealing with.

101
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.870
So you can focus on the benefits
before features and

102
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.110
this is a common mistake I
see on a lot of websites.

103
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.580
Is that jumping straight in and
saying what the thing does, right?

104
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.370
What the functionality is,
what the details of the offering is.

105
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.736
And they don't take the time to say
how this is gonna change your life,

106
00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:18.934
how is gonna make things better for
you as a person?

107
00:07:18.934 --> 00:07:23.631
So we see this all the time on
something like car advertising, right?

108
00:07:23.631 --> 00:07:28.292
Car advertising isn't kind of listing
all of the features of the car,

109
00:07:28.292 --> 00:07:33.269
it's not talking you know about its
technical spec or anything like that,

110
00:07:33.269 --> 00:07:37.380
what they're doing is they're
talking about the benefits.

111
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.513
So you'll see everybody who ever sees
to drive a car in an ad is either

112
00:07:42.513 --> 00:07:48.020
incredibly beautiful and
gotten an attractive partner with them.

113
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:48.760
You know that.

114
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.800
So basically the implication is
it's gonna make your life better.

115
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.140
That's the benefit,
you're gonna be more sexy or whatever.

116
00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:00.306
Or it's a family going off kayaking or
something like that, it's all about

117
00:08:00.306 --> 00:08:06.037
self improvement and self filming, so talk
about the benefits of your product if you

118
00:08:06.037 --> 00:08:11.548
want to help people overcome their natural
hesitancy and fear of taking action.

119
00:08:11.548 --> 00:08:17.075
And then we can also do what's called
introducing a new reference point so

120
00:08:17.075 --> 00:08:22.246
you can reframe somebody's thinking
in terms of their objections,

121
00:08:22.246 --> 00:08:26.320
so I can give you a real
world example of this one.

122
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.670
So you've probably heard of Mailchimp,
right?

123
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:35.370
Mailchimp enable you to send
out email marketing to people.

124
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.280
Now, Mailchimp is really good.

125
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.057
So great tool, but I kind of come to
the point where I wanted a different too,

126
00:08:42.057 --> 00:08:42.658
all right?

127
00:08:42.658 --> 00:08:44.138
For reasons I bore you with,

128
00:08:44.138 --> 00:08:47.580
so I started looking around at
what was in the marketplace.

129
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.796
And I came across a tool called
ConvertKit that basically,

130
00:08:51.796 --> 00:08:55.422
yeah, did the same
fundamentally the same thing,

131
00:08:55.422 --> 00:09:00.800
and the first thing I saw was,
it was more expensive, the Mailchimp.

132
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.847
So I was immediately gonna
dismiss it at that point, but

133
00:09:04.847 --> 00:09:09.409
right next to the price,
it had a link that said, explicitly,

134
00:09:09.409 --> 00:09:15.900
ConvertKit compared to Mailchimp cuz
Mailchimp is the leader in the field.

135
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:20.253
So just I happen to click on that link,
it was enough to grab my attention,

136
00:09:20.253 --> 00:09:25.100
it pulled me through to a different page,
and that page basically did a side by side

137
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:30.319
comparison of features, the Mailchimp had
compared to features that ConvertKit hat.

138
00:09:30.319 --> 00:09:33.933
And as sheep, I read down that list
of features and I'm just like, wow,

139
00:09:33.933 --> 00:09:35.540
ConvertKit is really good.

140
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:40.501
I ended up moving across to it,
even though it costs me more some,

141
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:42.880
so notice what happened now.

142
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.293
I had an objection, discuss more, but

143
00:09:46.293 --> 00:09:51.570
they reframed my thinking away
from worrying about price and

144
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:58.030
on to thinking about features and
its capability and what it can do.

145
00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.830
So it changed my reference point.

146
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.560
So that's another thing
that you can explore.

147
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.270
And again, we'll touch on that more later.

148
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.610
And then the final final thing you
can do is appeal to the Selfish Gene.

149
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:10.640
Now, what does that mean?

150
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:16.778
Well, there are a lot of products that
people buy that you're not really buying

151
00:10:16.778 --> 00:10:21.662
for yourself, but you're buying for
somebody else, whether it be a gift, or

152
00:10:21.662 --> 00:10:23.586
obviously in the B to B sector,

153
00:10:23.586 --> 00:10:27.740
often the people buying something
aren't gonna be the end users.

154
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.817
Charity giving is another example
where you're giving money and

155
00:10:32.817 --> 00:10:37.040
you're not actually personally
getting the benefit back from it.

156
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.510
It's going to another person.

157
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:44.928
Now in those kinds of scenarios,
often our tendency as we design and

158
00:10:44.928 --> 00:10:49.588
create websites around those
kinds of things is refocus on

159
00:10:49.588 --> 00:10:54.720
delivering to talking about
the benefit to the end user.

160
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.579
But actually, we need to be talking
about the benefit to the buyer as well,

161
00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:02.100
to appeal to them selfishly.

162
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.909
So for example, with charity,
giving your heart,

163
00:11:05.909 --> 00:11:10.671
you wanna talk about how it makes
the giver feel good about how it,

164
00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:14.235
there might be tax breaks to it or
whatever else.

165
00:11:14.235 --> 00:11:18.927
Don't just focus on the end user but also
focus on the other person because that

166
00:11:18.927 --> 00:11:22.554
helps and overcome their own fears and
their own concerns and

167
00:11:22.554 --> 00:11:25.843
their own objections and
makes it a risk worth taking.

168
00:11:25.843 --> 00:11:31.356
Another thing that you can do with these
objections and these risks that people

169
00:11:31.356 --> 00:11:37.219
are struggling with on the website is give
people a sense of control of those risks.

170
00:11:37.219 --> 00:11:41.872
When we feel in control of something,
it feels less dangerous and

171
00:11:41.872 --> 00:11:47.047
less concerning to us, and there
are a couple of ways that we can do this.

172
00:11:47.047 --> 00:11:51.970
The first is to not leave people
wondering what's going on.

173
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:56.623
Right, one of the biggest
problems is a kind of a natural

174
00:11:56.623 --> 00:12:01.177
hesitancy on our part because
we feel out of our depth,

175
00:12:01.177 --> 00:12:07.540
if we don't know what's going on,
we feel out of control, we worry.

176
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:12.443
We become anxious,
our primal brain kicks into high gear, but

177
00:12:12.443 --> 00:12:18.551
when we're given a sense of control by
being informed about where things are,

178
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:23.546
everything changes so that I can
give you a real example of this,

179
00:12:23.546 --> 00:12:28.660
so, I was flying from
London Heathrow to Austin, Texas.

180
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:33.130
And you have to change or
did have to change at Dallas.

181
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:38.480
So we flew into Dallas and as we flew
into Dallas, it started snowing in Texas.

182
00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.350
It was just ridiculous.

183
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.748
Nobody knew how to deal with this,

184
00:12:42.748 --> 00:12:46.580
the whole airport closed down instantly,
right?

185
00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.174
They just couldn't cope with the idea
of snow in Texas, everybody panicked.

186
00:12:50.174 --> 00:12:55.264
So all the flights were grounded,
and I wandered over to

187
00:12:55.264 --> 00:13:01.490
the information desk,
the British Airways information desk.

188
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:06.438
Along with pretty much everybody else and
to try and find out what was happening,

189
00:13:06.438 --> 00:13:11.387
and there were two information desks side
by side, there was the British Airways

190
00:13:11.387 --> 00:13:15.789
information desk and the American Airlines
information desk, okay?

191
00:13:15.789 --> 00:13:20.230
And as I sat there and watched what
was going on cuz I ended up sitting on

192
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:25.820
the floor a few meters away, and I was
like watching these two information desks.

193
00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:30.470
It was fascinating to know
the difference that occurred, okay?

194
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.835
Outside the British Airways
information desk with just one or

195
00:13:33.835 --> 00:13:37.610
two people just kind of standing
around casually bored, right?

196
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.892
And then, everybody else was
sitting around nearby chilling

197
00:13:41.892 --> 00:13:45.690
out outside the American Airlines
information desk.

198
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.280
There was a ruckus.

199
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.858
There were people frustrated,
they were getting annoyed and

200
00:13:51.858 --> 00:13:55.288
they were getting angry and
it was this big thing going on.

201
00:13:55.288 --> 00:14:00.457
Now my incredibly xenophobic view
of this as a British person was,

202
00:14:00.457 --> 00:14:06.910
well, that's Americans for you,
they like to make a fuss about stuff.

203
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.575
But obviously,
that wasn't the reality of it,

204
00:14:09.575 --> 00:14:12.760
because in British Airways have
Americans flying on it and

205
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.448
American Airlines having British people on
it so it's obviously nothing to do that.

206
00:14:17.448 --> 00:14:21.742
What it was,
was how the two communicated differently,

207
00:14:21.742 --> 00:14:26.752
both of them came out at the beginning and
said I'm really sorry but

208
00:14:26.752 --> 00:14:32.766
the planes have been grounded but then
their response was slightly different.

209
00:14:32.766 --> 00:14:37.642
The British Airways person said,
we'll come back to you in 10 minutes and

210
00:14:37.642 --> 00:14:42.516
give you an update, and the American
Airlines said, we'll come back to you

211
00:14:42.516 --> 00:14:48.030
when anything changes and nothing changed
for a long length of time, right?

212
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:52.550
So there was this long period of
time where nothing was going on.

213
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.190
But every 10 minutes
the British Airways woman came out and

214
00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.115
said sorry we've got no more
information nothing's changed but

215
00:15:00.115 --> 00:15:03.842
we'll be back out in 10 minutes
to give you another update.

216
00:15:03.842 --> 00:15:07.348
So even though they weren't
providing any value,

217
00:15:07.348 --> 00:15:12.090
it still made everybody karma, and
the same is true on your website.

218
00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:17.651
So think about when you place an order on
a website or whether you fill in a contact

219
00:15:17.651 --> 00:15:22.799
us form and then the email or the
transaction disappears into the ether and

220
00:15:22.799 --> 00:15:27.464
you don't know what's happening,
as my order been dispatched?

221
00:15:27.464 --> 00:15:29.940
Is someone gonna get in contact with me?

222
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:30.940
What's going on there?

223
00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:36.730
And so giving people a sense of control
and answering their concerns and

224
00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:42.540
objections reassures them and I'm gonna
give you an example of that later.

225
00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.236
But the other way you can
give people control is allow

226
00:15:46.236 --> 00:15:49.460
people to undo their mistakes, right?

227
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:54.210
For example, can I return an item easily
or can I easily cancel my subscription?

228
00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.624
These are all fundamental
things to help people,

229
00:15:57.624 --> 00:16:01.371
have the bravery to take
the step to overcome the risk.

230
00:16:01.371 --> 00:16:06.015
So that's a little bit about
objection handling and taking risks.
