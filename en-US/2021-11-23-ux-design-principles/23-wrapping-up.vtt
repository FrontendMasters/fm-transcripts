00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.330
So let's wrap that one up as well and
just cover the key

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.183
takeaways there testing is
the key to improving conversion.

3
00:00:11.183 --> 00:00:16.174
Yeah if you can only take away one
thing from today focus on testing,

4
00:00:16.174 --> 00:00:21.517
gain those real users using the site and
watching what they're doing and

5
00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:24.423
how they're behaving on the website.

6
00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:29.043
You will learn way more than you will from
any course like this I can teach you all

7
00:00:29.043 --> 00:00:30.863
the techniques in the world but

8
00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:34.649
nothing is gonna compete testing
your design in the real world.

9
00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.207
Secondly, testing post launch is
most important of all that's when

10
00:00:39.207 --> 00:00:43.698
you're getting people behaving
the most naturally an AB testing.

11
00:00:43.698 --> 00:00:45.561
And testing a prototype and

12
00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:50.425
that iteration really is absolutely
invaluable to the whole process.

13
00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:56.035
And then also and I probably didn't
emphasize this enough testing regularly

14
00:00:56.035 --> 00:01:01.569
leads to even better results so don't
just do this once but test regularly.

15
00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:06.268
For example in Steve crude second book
which was rocket surgery made easy he

16
00:01:06.268 --> 00:01:09.720
proposes doing monthly
testing on your website.

17
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.025
Just to stay on top of
it to keep tweaking and

18
00:01:12.025 --> 00:01:15.280
keep pushing that conversion
rate up over time.

19
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.058
And he talks about doing that
through facilitated remote usability

20
00:01:20.058 --> 00:01:23.130
testing using something like zoom.

21
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.256
But you could do it with
facilitated testing,

22
00:01:25.256 --> 00:01:28.418
you could do it with surveys,
you could do it with first click test any

23
00:01:28.418 --> 00:01:31.215
of the different approaches
that I've talked about today.

24
00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:35.441
But it's getting into that habit of
testing regularly that's how you really

25
00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:38.182
improve your conversion
rate over the long term.

26
00:01:38.182 --> 00:01:41.154
And I would encourage you to
use both quantitative and

27
00:01:41.154 --> 00:01:45.180
qualitative forms of testing so
what do I mean by that?

28
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.798
Don't just rely on AB
testing the whole time but

29
00:01:48.798 --> 00:01:54.226
also make sure you're actually
occasionally talking to real users and

30
00:01:54.226 --> 00:01:58.220
watching real users
interacting with the website.

31
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.236
Because that's when you get insights
into their mindset and their thinking

32
00:02:03.236 --> 00:02:08.184
that really kind of helps you come up
with the best solutions in all of that.

33
00:02:08.184 --> 00:02:13.092
So really that's pretty much all I wanna
say for today that if there's any final

34
00:02:13.092 --> 00:02:17.206
questions from the people watching
live I'd love to answer them.

35
00:02:17.206 --> 00:02:22.316
By hopefully I've inspired you a little
bit that there is enormous potential

36
00:02:22.316 --> 00:02:27.090
to improve the conversion rate of
websites in a very systematic way.

37
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.824
This isn't magic it's about a basic
understanding of psychology following

38
00:02:31.824 --> 00:02:33.510
some basic rules.

39
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.336
And also, I'm hoping to have encouraged
you a little bit out of your comfort zone

40
00:02:37.336 --> 00:02:39.930
to start exploring things
like copy creation.

41
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.393
And design as well, because even as
developers with your own specialism,

42
00:02:45.393 --> 00:02:49.132
you still got value to bring
to those other fields.

43
00:02:49.132 --> 00:02:54.031
Because those other disciplines, then
they're not necessarily experts or writing

44
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:59.140
for the web they're not necessarily
experts in conversion rate optimization.

45
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.587
And you can bring stuff to that
conversation and encourage people to think

46
00:03:03.587 --> 00:03:08.321
in terms of incrementally improving
conversion rather than launch it once and

47
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:09.049
walk away.

48
00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.426
Which is still the mentality that so
many people have with websites so

49
00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.972
let's just get it live and
move on to the next project and

50
00:03:16.972 --> 00:03:20.304
really a successful website
is a lot more than that.

51
00:03:20.304 --> 00:03:23.497
&gt;&gt; Dennis just wants to say thank
you it's been very interesting.

52
00:03:23.497 --> 00:03:29.339
&gt;&gt; Excellent well I mean I'm very
conscious that this whole presentation is

53
00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:34.437
a little bit above and
beyond the stuff that you normally cover.

54
00:03:34.437 --> 00:03:38.581
But it is a part of the front end
experience, your front end masters and

55
00:03:38.581 --> 00:03:43.020
that's not just about front end coding
that's the front end experience.

56
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.296
So I'm hoping that the people
watching have found it valuable and

57
00:03:47.296 --> 00:03:49.170
inspired them a little bit.
