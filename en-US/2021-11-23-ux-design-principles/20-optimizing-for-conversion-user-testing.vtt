00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.139
Okay, so let's wrap up our
final session of this course,

2
00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:08.870
on occurring high converting websites
by looking at the subject of

3
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.670
optimizing your site for conversion.

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.282
At the end of the last session I
started talking about testing and

5
00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:21.847
introducing testing as a way of getting
design sign off and design approval.

6
00:00:21.847 --> 00:00:25.396
But testing actually is a lot
more fundamental to that.

7
00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:28.815
The idea of testing, and improving, and

8
00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:33.904
iterating upon your website is
the lifeblood of conversion.

9
00:00:33.904 --> 00:00:39.299
I've been doing this job for
26 years something like that,

10
00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:42.105
which is depressing in itself.

11
00:00:42.105 --> 00:00:47.899
And over all of that time the one thing
that I've learned above everything

12
00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:54.363
else is that to maximize the conversion
rate on a website you need to test, right?

13
00:00:54.363 --> 00:00:57.909
All of my knowledge, all of my experience
is meaningless in the face of user

14
00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.838
behavior, users do weird things
that I don't understand and

15
00:01:00.838 --> 00:01:02.781
I don't get even after all these years.

16
00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:06.224
They continually surprised me on what
they like, and what they dislike,

17
00:01:06.224 --> 00:01:09.737
what they respond to, what they don't
respond to, is always a surprise.

18
00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:14.150
And the only way that you get to
real results is through testing.

19
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.934
So, that's what we're gonna look
at in this last section is,

20
00:01:16.934 --> 00:01:18.889
how to kind of optimize
your site over time.

21
00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:22.275
We're gonna look at why testing is so
important,

22
00:01:22.275 --> 00:01:27.204
when and how to test, and reviewing
any more websites before we wrap up.

23
00:01:27.204 --> 00:01:30.891
But basically,
we're gonna look at optimizing and

24
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:33.248
testing your website to go with.

25
00:01:33.248 --> 00:01:36.369
So, why is testing so important,

26
00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.113
why is this absolutely
fundamental to our success?

27
00:01:41.113 --> 00:01:45.660
Well, for all our knowledge,
and expertise, and

28
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.711
years of experience, as I say,
that's only gonna take you so far.

29
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:55.568
You might produce the best design
that you possibly could and

30
00:01:55.568 --> 00:01:58.528
follow all the advice that I've given so
far.

31
00:01:58.528 --> 00:02:01.081
But it still won't be
as good as it could be,

32
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:03.706
if you're actually carry out some testing.

33
00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:06.758
Testing has huge power.

34
00:02:06.758 --> 00:02:09.470
For a start, it reduces costly mistakes.

35
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.507
If you design something and roll it out,
only to find that it's wrong only,

36
00:02:13.507 --> 00:02:16.094
if you wasted the time and
money of designing it,

37
00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:20.575
and rolling it, and developing it in the
first place, you're also wasting money,

38
00:02:20.575 --> 00:02:22.625
then having to change it afterwards.

39
00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:26.548
So, if you test early, you can catch
potential problems and mistakes you're

40
00:02:26.548 --> 00:02:30.663
making in the design, and improve it, so
it converts better when you roll it out.

41
00:02:30.663 --> 00:02:35.671
Secondly, it reduces time with those
time consuming debates you have about

42
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:40.756
aesthetics, as I was saying, in the last
session, that the amount of time we

43
00:02:40.756 --> 00:02:46.101
waste debating about what color blue it
should be, well, we could just test it.

44
00:02:46.101 --> 00:02:49.037
Now, I'm not saying we should
do what Google did and

45
00:02:49.037 --> 00:02:51.587
test 41 shades of blue
to see which is best.

46
00:02:51.587 --> 00:02:56.449
But I'm saying that the testing can
help break deadlocks in conversations,

47
00:02:56.449 --> 00:03:01.538
where different people come to different
conclusions about what's working and

48
00:03:01.538 --> 00:03:02.458
what's not.

49
00:03:02.458 --> 00:03:07.273
And at the most basic level, testing will
dramatically improve your conversion rate.

50
00:03:07.273 --> 00:03:13.447
And it really will make an enormous
difference, as I'll show you in a minute.

51
00:03:13.447 --> 00:03:18.248
The other thing we're testing is not
only will it help with an issue orders,

52
00:03:18.248 --> 00:03:20.813
but it can also help with repeat orders.

53
00:03:20.813 --> 00:03:25.583
So, if you create a seamless easy
user experience on the website,

54
00:03:25.583 --> 00:03:31.960
people will tend to use that website time
and time again, we are creatures of habit.

55
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.426
If we find something works,
we will just use it again and again,

56
00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:41.620
is exactly the reason why sites like
Amazon and Booking.com succeed.

57
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.342
It's not because they've got the best user
experience or even the best conversion

58
00:03:46.342 --> 00:03:50.998
optimization, although they both have
those, the second one in particular, is

59
00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:55.739
because people know those sites, and it's
easier just to do what we already know.

60
00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.207
So, if you get the first experience right,
and it's a pleasant experience, and

61
00:04:00.207 --> 00:04:03.594
it's good, then people will
order from you again and again.

62
00:04:03.594 --> 00:04:05.544
And the more times they order,

63
00:04:05.544 --> 00:04:09.899
the more that they're likely to
stick with you over the long-term.

64
00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:13.882
And then finally, of course a great
experience in a well-optimized website is

65
00:04:13.882 --> 00:04:16.745
gonna encourage word of
mouth recommendation, right?

66
00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:21.584
That's how a lot of sites become so
popular these days, is because they

67
00:04:21.584 --> 00:04:27.167
provide a great experience, and that they
get shared from one person to another.

68
00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:30.648
So, just to give you a sense
of how big a difference,

69
00:04:30.648 --> 00:04:33.034
just a little bit of testing can do.

70
00:04:33.034 --> 00:04:39.574
Let me tell you about one change that I
made that caused 6% increase in sales.

71
00:04:39.574 --> 00:04:43.113
So, you remember, I talked about
an e-commerce site I worked on,

72
00:04:43.113 --> 00:04:45.668
which sold frozen ready
meals to the over 80s.

73
00:04:45.668 --> 00:04:48.766
So, this is an old audience.

74
00:04:48.766 --> 00:04:53.567
And we created the website,
we had a checkout process.

75
00:04:53.567 --> 00:04:56.847
And we were finding that a lot of users
were dropping out when it came to credit

76
00:04:56.847 --> 00:04:57.575
card payments.

77
00:04:57.575 --> 00:04:59.446
So, we were looking at the analytics.

78
00:04:59.446 --> 00:05:03.826
And we saw that, when they hit that credit
card page, they were dropping out, and

79
00:05:03.826 --> 00:05:07.592
they weren't finishing the order,
which proved very frustrating.

80
00:05:07.592 --> 00:05:12.492
And we kinda hypothesized
different potential problems, and

81
00:05:12.492 --> 00:05:17.952
one of the problems was that they
didn't feel the website was secure.

82
00:05:17.952 --> 00:05:19.518
Cuz this is an elderly audience and

83
00:05:19.518 --> 00:05:22.813
not necessarily particularly
comfortable with online transactions.

84
00:05:22.813 --> 00:05:27.751
And even though obviously it
was a highly secured site, and

85
00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:31.799
it had the little padlock
in the address bar, and

86
00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:35.968
we even had a one of those
VerisSign secured logo.

87
00:05:35.968 --> 00:05:39.768
But we concluded that actually
nobody had a clue what that meant,

88
00:05:39.768 --> 00:05:41.300
that was our hypothesis.

89
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.368
So, our step one,
was identifying the problem page,

90
00:05:44.368 --> 00:05:46.646
which turned out to be the payment page.

91
00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:51.170
Step two, was then identifying
a potential problem item on the page,

92
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.632
which was our VeriSign secured logo.

93
00:05:53.632 --> 00:05:57.283
So, what we did then is ran
a little bit of A/B testing.

94
00:05:57.283 --> 00:06:03.133
So, we replaced the verify phone logo
with various combinations of icons and

95
00:06:03.133 --> 00:06:08.537
text, that hopefully made it a little
bit more secure, more obvious.

96
00:06:08.537 --> 00:06:11.550
And so, we then ran that as an A/B test.

97
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.720
And we saw a 6% increase in
conversions by introducing the text

98
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.620
you see on the right-hand side
of the screen there, right?

99
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.249
Just by doing a little bit of A/B testing,
wasn't an expensive,

100
00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:30.396
wasn't time consuming, and
yet it made a big difference.

101
00:06:30.396 --> 00:06:35.033
Now that's a drop in the ocean
compared to my friend Jared Spool,

102
00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:38.574
I don't know whether you
know of Jared Spool, but

103
00:06:38.574 --> 00:06:42.740
he's a brilliant expert in
user experience design.

104
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.811
And he tells the story
of one of his clients,

105
00:06:45.811 --> 00:06:50.060
where they changed a particular
form field button.

106
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.170
And by changing the one button,
they increased sales by 300 million.

107
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.535
And they didn't do that,
because Jared Spool is the genius,

108
00:06:57.535 --> 00:07:01.950
although I like to think he is, I like to
hang out with genius or really think I do.

109
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.945
He just a magic guess,

110
00:07:03.945 --> 00:07:10.700
it was just done through systematic
testing of what he was doing.

111
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.900
So, testing makes a huge difference,
it saves you time, it saves you money.

112
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.497
It saves your sanity, if you're the one
responsible for the design, and

113
00:07:19.497 --> 00:07:21.661
it improves the conversion rate.

114
00:07:21.661 --> 00:07:25.233
So, the question then fairly
obviously becomes what to test?

115
00:07:25.233 --> 00:07:29.579
There is a lot of different things
that you can test on a website and

116
00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:32.196
where you begin is not always obvious.

117
00:07:32.196 --> 00:07:36.200
There are several things I like to start
with, one I've already talked about,

118
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.300
which is testing brand keywords.

119
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.056
So, we're saying we want the design
to be trustworthy, friendly,

120
00:07:42.056 --> 00:07:44.272
that kinda thing, so we can test those.

121
00:07:44.272 --> 00:07:47.203
We can also test our visual hierarchy,
right?

122
00:07:47.203 --> 00:07:50.635
Are people seeing the content
that we want them to see?

123
00:07:50.635 --> 00:07:52.866
That's something else that
we can definitely test.

124
00:07:52.866 --> 00:07:56.817
We can test our calls to action, are
people clicking on the calls to action,

125
00:07:56.817 --> 00:07:59.613
are they compelling,
are they being noticed, etc?

126
00:07:59.613 --> 00:08:02.190
And then finally,
we can test the content itself.

127
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:06.359
Is content compelling,
does it communicate what we want it to,

128
00:08:06.359 --> 00:08:09.230
is it as optimized and
as good as it could be?

129
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.120
So, those are the kinds of
things that we're testing.

130
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.705
The next question then becomes, well, when
and how do we go about testing, cuz there

131
00:08:19.705 --> 00:08:25.630
are lots of different phases in a project,
a lot of different opportunities to test.

132
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:30.063
And when we talk about A/B testing, like
I was talking about with Jared Spool and

133
00:08:30.063 --> 00:08:32.474
also on the the frozen
ready meals website,

134
00:08:32.474 --> 00:08:36.800
those were both existing websites
that were already running.

135
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.877
So, you could do A/B testing.

136
00:08:38.877 --> 00:08:42.733
But in actual fact you're
better off testing early,

137
00:08:42.733 --> 00:08:47.545
the earlier you test,
these are estimate changes, right?

138
00:08:47.545 --> 00:08:52.560
If you're just testing a wire frame,
then you can change that easily.

139
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.578
If you've waited until you've
built half the website and

140
00:08:55.578 --> 00:08:59.643
run a bit of usability testing at the end,
because you feel like you should do,

141
00:08:59.643 --> 00:09:02.801
then it's really expensive and
difficult to make changes.

142
00:09:02.801 --> 00:09:08.393
And so, you tend not to bother and see
your website goes live being suboptimal.

143
00:09:08.393 --> 00:09:11.742
So, really there are lots
of opportunities to test.

144
00:09:11.742 --> 00:09:17.691
And I'm not somebody who is
into heavy duty testing, right?

145
00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:20.605
For me it's all about
return on investment.

146
00:09:20.605 --> 00:09:24.549
You wanna put the minimal effort in for
the maximum results.

147
00:09:24.549 --> 00:09:29.151
So, I'm not talking about usability labs,
or two-way mirrors, or

148
00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:31.180
stuff that takes weeks.

149
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:35.468
I know that most of you and me myself
don't ever have budget set aside for

150
00:09:35.468 --> 00:09:38.328
testing, and
the client is reluctant to do it,

151
00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:41.063
cuz they're worried it
slow up the project.

152
00:09:41.063 --> 00:09:44.833
So, everything that I'm gonna
propose is really lightweight,

153
00:09:44.833 --> 00:09:48.610
easy stuff that anybody can do with
no money and very little time.

154
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.348
So, first of all, before you begin,

155
00:09:52.348 --> 00:09:56.840
before you even start on a project,
you can actually do testing.

156
00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.654
Now, I know that sounds weird,
but bear with me it is possible.

157
00:10:00.654 --> 00:10:05.062
The first thing you can do is usability
testing on your existing site or

158
00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:06.792
on your competitors site.

159
00:10:06.792 --> 00:10:09.687
I love competitor's websites, right?

160
00:10:09.687 --> 00:10:12.778
Because they're effectively
a free prototype that

161
00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:14.678
they've built kindly for you.

162
00:10:14.678 --> 00:10:17.352
So, you can rip it apart,
find all the problems,

163
00:10:17.352 --> 00:10:20.920
find what works, find what doesn't,
and copy what you need to and

164
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.610
improve what they've done wrong,
it's great.

165
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.679
So, just spending a little
bit of time running two or

166
00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:31.911
three users through using a site like
that, your various competitors sites,

167
00:10:31.911 --> 00:10:35.841
getting them to complete key tasks,
really doesn't need to take long.

168
00:10:35.841 --> 00:10:38.407
And you've got a couple
of ways you can do that.

169
00:10:38.407 --> 00:10:42.719
You can either do what's called
facilitated usability testing,

170
00:10:42.719 --> 00:10:46.574
where you basically arrange
a Zoom call with them, right?

171
00:10:46.574 --> 00:10:50.496
And you jump on a call, and you say,
show me how to do dot, dot, dot,

172
00:10:50.496 --> 00:10:54.217
how would you contact them more,
how would you buy this thing, or

173
00:10:54.217 --> 00:10:57.146
whatever their primary call to action is,
right?

174
00:10:57.146 --> 00:10:59.370
Just watch them do it.

175
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.421
There's no magic to it.

176
00:11:01.421 --> 00:11:03.879
You don't have to use fancy words.

177
00:11:03.879 --> 00:11:07.865
Yes, you can get very sophisticated
with usability testing.

178
00:11:07.865 --> 00:11:10.566
But even just having
a chat with some users,

179
00:11:10.566 --> 00:11:15.611
getting them to complete some key tasks,
you'll learn valuable stuff for that.

180
00:11:15.611 --> 00:11:20.099
If you wanna test a few more people and
you're really short on time,

181
00:11:20.099 --> 00:11:25.220
then you can use what's called
unfacilitated usability testing, where you

182
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:30.283
use a tool, like look back or another
one that I use quite a lot is maze.com.

183
00:11:30.283 --> 00:11:35.941
And on those tools, you go in,
you write out what the task is, right?

184
00:11:35.941 --> 00:11:41.185
So, how would you contact
this organization, right?

185
00:11:41.185 --> 00:11:44.700
And put in the URL, and
then put in the page,

186
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:50.420
where they complete the task,
where the task is considered complete.

187
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.795
And then what the tool will
do is give you a unique URL,

188
00:11:53.795 --> 00:11:58.083
you can pass out to people on social
media, email or wherever else.

189
00:11:58.083 --> 00:12:01.884
And they can go to the URL, follow
the instructions and complete the task.

190
00:12:01.884 --> 00:12:05.408
And then you'll get videos back, where you
can watch them try and do these things.

191
00:12:05.408 --> 00:12:08.471
Now, what you do is ask them to speak
out loud, while they're doing it.

192
00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:12.598
So, they can express their frustrations
and difficulties that they're having, but

193
00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:13.569
it's that simple.

194
00:12:13.569 --> 00:12:15.645
And often,
if you've got a big mailing list or

195
00:12:15.645 --> 00:12:19.600
a lot of people on the social media
channel, you can get results in a hour.

196
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.772
And if you're in a real hurry, and
you've got a little bit money to spend,

197
00:12:23.772 --> 00:12:27.946
they'll even recruit people for
you to complete the tasks on your behalf,

198
00:12:27.946 --> 00:12:32.517
sometimes as little as $1 or $2 per user,
though the more complex the task is,

199
00:12:32.517 --> 00:12:33.800
the more that goes up.

200
00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:39.284
So, really to do that kind of
initial testing just to kind

201
00:12:39.284 --> 00:12:43.390
of let you know where you're at is super,
super easy.

202
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.401
Also, if it's your own site that
you're testing, you can run things,

203
00:12:47.401 --> 00:12:48.434
like session recorders.

204
00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:51.495
If you've ever come across
a talk on Microsoft Clarity,

205
00:12:51.495 --> 00:12:55.127
where you might have heard of Hotjar
a lot of us have heard of Hotjar,

206
00:12:55.127 --> 00:12:58.793
which you get session recordings
of people moving around the site.

207
00:12:58.793 --> 00:13:01.369
Well, there's a free version
called Microsoft Clarity,

208
00:13:01.369 --> 00:13:04.210
which is Microsoft trying to get
in on the Google analytics game.

209
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:08.515
And actually, it's a great little tool,
where it will record users move around

210
00:13:08.515 --> 00:13:11.807
the site, show where they're
getting angry or frustrated,

211
00:13:11.807 --> 00:13:16.290
because they repeatedly clicking or
clicking on things aren't clickable.

212
00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:19.090
You can learn loads from just
looking at a few of those videos.

213
00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:24.600
So, that kind of upfront testing,
great starting point, highly encourage it.

214
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.130
The other thing that I often do up front
is something called an exit intent survey.

215
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.290
So, we're only showing this as the user
is going to leave the website.

216
00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.014
So, it really only works on mobile,

217
00:13:35.014 --> 00:13:38.700
because as the cursor moves off
the screen, it triggers not.

218
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.102
It only works on desktop,

219
00:13:40.102 --> 00:13:44.360
because it needs to track the user's
cursor going off the screen.

220
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.177
But as the user's cursor
goes off the screen, and

221
00:13:47.177 --> 00:13:51.890
they look like they're about to abandon
the site, then you just display a survey.

222
00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:56.550
I don't like interrupting people who might
be in the middle of doing a task right?

223
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.453
So, we try and
get them just as they're leaving.

224
00:13:58.453 --> 00:14:02.424
And I asked them one simple question,

225
00:14:02.424 --> 00:14:07.263
before you go today we
would love to know why you

226
00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:12.741
decided not to sign up or
buy, whatever the task is?

227
00:14:12.741 --> 00:14:17.507
That's it, that's all I'm asking them, and
I give them a multi choice list of things

228
00:14:17.507 --> 00:14:20.201
that I think are common objections or
problems.

229
00:14:20.201 --> 00:14:23.952
But then I allow them to add more,
if they want to.

230
00:14:23.952 --> 00:14:29.571
And that single test tells you so,
so much, because you then know,

231
00:14:29.571 --> 00:14:33.331
well, okay, price is the problem, right?

232
00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:36.808
That's why people aren't buying,
cuz the price is too high, okay, so

233
00:14:36.808 --> 00:14:38.012
what do we do about that?

234
00:14:38.012 --> 00:14:40.304
We need to handle that objection.

235
00:14:40.304 --> 00:14:44.636
We might reduce the price, or
we might reprime them, like with

236
00:14:44.636 --> 00:14:49.867
the ConvertKit example, by focusing on
the features, or we might make it so

237
00:14:49.867 --> 00:14:54.470
compelling that is worth paying
the extra money, whatever it be.

238
00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.337
And just from that one question,
you can begin to really

239
00:14:59.337 --> 00:15:03.404
build up a picture of what you
should be focusing on the website.

240
00:15:03.404 --> 00:15:06.656
So, that's what I do before I even start.

241
00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:11.183
Then I obviously start doing some
wireframing typically, just kinda getting

242
00:15:11.183 --> 00:15:15.986
the structure in the field, normally
grayscale wireframes, just laying out some

243
00:15:15.986 --> 00:15:19.772
of the content and how I want the page
to flow and that kinda thing.

244
00:15:19.772 --> 00:15:23.347
And again, you've got some
opportunities to test here.

245
00:15:23.347 --> 00:15:25.903
Even with something like card sorting, so

246
00:15:25.903 --> 00:15:30.460
even when I'm just looking at
the information architecture.

247
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:35.304
They've renamed themselves now, I don't
think there are oxShops anymore, but

248
00:15:35.304 --> 00:15:37.491
you can still type in oxshops.com.

249
00:15:37.491 --> 00:15:41.452
And you get to a great website,
where essentially,

250
00:15:41.452 --> 00:15:43.882
you can run card sorting tests,

251
00:15:43.882 --> 00:15:49.566
you can get people to organize information
in ways that make sense to them.

252
00:15:49.566 --> 00:15:53.933
This is really good for
deciding on e-commerce categories, right?

253
00:15:53.933 --> 00:15:58.678
How should the products be categorized,
or pout blog post categories will be

254
00:15:58.678 --> 00:16:02.260
another example, or navigation,
and that kinda thing.

255
00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.178
You can create the whole information
architecture through card sorting

256
00:16:05.178 --> 00:16:06.680
exercises.

257
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:12.490
But you could also, then test the results
of that, you can create a tree structure.

258
00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:17.360
And you can ask people to navigate
those trees to find a particular page.

259
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.452
So, do they find easily
the particular page there after?

260
00:16:21.452 --> 00:16:25.568
So, even at the information architecture
stage, you can start testing it,

261
00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:26.974
start playing around it.

262
00:16:26.974 --> 00:16:29.490
And again,
you can get results in a few minutes.

263
00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:33.549
You don't have to do huge study
with the hundreds of people,

264
00:16:33.549 --> 00:16:38.000
even half a dozen people,
you'll begin to see insights.

265
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.611
And again, you can do this on facilitated,
in other words,

266
00:16:40.611 --> 00:16:43.490
you don't need to sit with people,
while they're doing it.

267
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.470
You send out a link,
then you'll get data back.

268
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:52.700
If you want you can do some facilitated
remote testing on your wireframes,

269
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.461
where you get people to
click through them, and

270
00:16:55.461 --> 00:16:58.800
navigate around them,
and see how they get on.

271
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.250
But if you don't have time, that's fine.

272
00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.220
Don't do that, right?

273
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.820
Do what you can, when you can.

274
00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:07.180
But doing some testing is better
than doing no testing at all,

275
00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.870
in terms of improving things.
