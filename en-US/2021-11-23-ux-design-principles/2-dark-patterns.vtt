1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.472
That knowledge of those psychological
principles can be used for

2
00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:07.865
good or can be used for evil.

3
00:00:07.865 --> 00:00:10.900
And that's where dark patterns come in,

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.723
this idea of manipulating
people with psychology.

5
00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:19.937
So just because we're talking about
psychology and an understanding of

6
00:00:19.937 --> 00:00:25.846
people doesn't mean automatically that
we move into the world of dark patterns.

7
00:00:25.846 --> 00:00:30.761
And I wanna address this issue of dark
patterns because there are good reasons

8
00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:31.754
to avoid them.

9
00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:36.442
Now, you might not have come across
the term dark patterns before, so

10
00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:40.738
let me just take a few minutes to
explain what dark patterns are.

11
00:00:40.738 --> 00:00:44.888
And then we'll look at why you
really should be avoiding them.

12
00:00:44.888 --> 00:00:49.536
So I define dark patterns as user
interface elements that have been

13
00:00:49.536 --> 00:00:55.180
carefully crafted to trick users into
doing things they might not otherwise do,

14
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.089
often by means of psychological
manipulation, okay?

15
00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.902
And I can sum all of this up with this
mock up that I've produced, okay?

16
00:01:04.902 --> 00:01:09.003
So this mock up,
basically is a typical e-commerce site,

17
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:11.881
is trying to sell a pair of shoes, right?

18
00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:18.996
But obviously all good e-commerce sites
wanna increase the average order value.

19
00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:21.081
They want people to spend more with them.

20
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:26.302
So one way that a company might decide it
wants to go about increasing the value

21
00:01:26.302 --> 00:01:30.880
it makes from people buying these
shoes is to sell them insurance for

22
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.671
their shoes, all right?

23
00:01:32.671 --> 00:01:37.219
Absolutely ridiculous, who wants
insurance for their shoes, right?

24
00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.767
But I could easily encourage
somebody to do it.

25
00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:45.641
I could basically manipulate somebody to
adding insurance to their shoes whether

26
00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:46.992
they wanted it or not.

27
00:01:46.992 --> 00:01:51.110
And that's exactly what
this interface does, right?

28
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.040
If you look at this interface,
everything in you cries,

29
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.390
if I want these shoes,
I need to hit that green button, okay?

30
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.295
There are a loads of visual
indicators that show that that is

31
00:02:06.295 --> 00:02:08.562
the right button to click.

32
00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:13.266
For a start, it's got an arrow
that points to the right and

33
00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:18.259
that for us in western countries
that read from left to right,

34
00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:21.925
is a sign of onwards, move forward, right?

35
00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:25.631
So that logically feels
like the next thing to do.

36
00:02:25.631 --> 00:02:29.610
Add to the fact that it's bright green and
green,

37
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.386
again in western society, is a color
that we associate heavily with go,

38
00:02:35.386 --> 00:02:38.719
so that then indicates you move forward.

39
00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:42.253
Now, but there is actually
another button right next to it.

40
00:02:42.253 --> 00:02:46.836
And the other button looks like it's been
grayed out, that it's not selectable.

41
00:02:46.836 --> 00:02:49.526
And it's also pointing backwards.

42
00:02:49.526 --> 00:02:53.164
But this is the moment that you're
giving somebody a choice, right?

43
00:02:53.164 --> 00:02:58.453
If you could read the copy on the buttons,
which by the way, I've purposely

44
00:02:58.453 --> 00:03:04.090
made hard to read because I don't want
people reading it if I want to manipulate.

45
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.446
We've got add to basket with
insurance on the green button and

46
00:03:08.446 --> 00:03:12.563
add to basket without insurance
on the grayed out button.

47
00:03:12.563 --> 00:03:13.829
So in other words,

48
00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.436
I can easily trick somebody into
doing something that I want them to.

49
00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:20.462
And we see these kinds of techniques,

50
00:03:20.462 --> 00:03:23.700
various psychological techniques
being used all the time.

51
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.220
So this particular technique
is relying on the fact

52
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.697
that we favor system 1 over system 2.

53
00:03:31.697 --> 00:03:38.640
In other words, we're not consciously
thinking about which button to click on.

54
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.526
Instead, we're intuitively going to the
button based on our previous experiences

55
00:03:43.526 --> 00:03:44.706
that green is good.

56
00:03:44.706 --> 00:03:48.308
That arrows to the right are onwards.

57
00:03:48.308 --> 00:03:53.592
And so we're just going through without
actually thinking about it was system 2.

58
00:03:53.592 --> 00:03:58.777
So that's the particular strain of
psychology that's being used there.

59
00:03:58.777 --> 00:04:03.315
But there are actually lots of
different techniques that can be used.

60
00:04:03.315 --> 00:04:06.774
So, you see, for example,
things like this all the time.

61
00:04:06.774 --> 00:04:09.906
So I don't know whether
you've ever used Etsy before.

62
00:04:09.906 --> 00:04:15.475
But Etsy sells kind of one-off
handcrafted goods, all right?

63
00:04:15.475 --> 00:04:21.768
And this particular one which is
a vintage lamp that looks like a shotgun.

64
00:04:21.768 --> 00:04:25.631
Cuz why not, well,
let's buy one of those today, shall we?

65
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:30.549
This is a handmade one-off item and
actually if you've read the overview

66
00:04:30.549 --> 00:04:34.289
description of it,
it says that it's a handmade item.

67
00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.088
Yet Etsy really wanna
obviously encourage sales.

68
00:04:38.088 --> 00:04:42.790
So what they then do
alongside that is they say,

69
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.154
almost gone, there's only one item left.

70
00:04:47.154 --> 00:04:50.866
Well, of course there's only one
item left, they're handmade and

71
00:04:50.866 --> 00:04:52.147
made to order, right?

72
00:04:52.147 --> 00:04:56.526
So there's only ever gonna be one left,
but they really emphasized that.

73
00:04:56.526 --> 00:04:59.626
And they also say not only
that's our only one left,

74
00:04:59.626 --> 00:05:03.289
there's three people who've
added this to their cart.

75
00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:07.630
It's gonna go any minute now because
three people have added it to their cart.

76
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.684
And worst still 63 people have
favorited this item, right?

77
00:05:13.684 --> 00:05:18.037
So what they're doing there is they're
tapping into your primal brain,

78
00:05:18.037 --> 00:05:22.527
that part of you that goes, I want to
hoard things, I don't wanna miss out,

79
00:05:22.527 --> 00:05:24.719
what if this is no longer available?

80
00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:26.478
And so that makes you want to buy.

81
00:05:26.478 --> 00:05:29.699
Now you sit there and you go,
I'll hoard of course.

82
00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.457
Of course, I know this,
I know they're trying to manipulate me but

83
00:05:34.457 --> 00:05:37.220
we'll come on to that in just a minute.

84
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.510
So as you can see, we're surrounded
by this all the time, right?

85
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.241
The guys here I've come across from
the states to the UK to film this

86
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:46.517
particular one.

87
00:05:46.517 --> 00:05:51.036
And I bet they booked their hotel
room with something like booking.com.

88
00:05:51.036 --> 00:05:52.653
And booking.com,

89
00:05:52.653 --> 00:05:57.796
they smother their website with
these kinds of scarcity thing.

90
00:05:57.796 --> 00:05:59.520
This room's almost sold out,

91
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.115
there's an exclusive deal that's
gonna expire at any minute.

92
00:06:03.115 --> 00:06:10.539
All of these things encouraged us to act,
but actually they're bad for business.

93
00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:16.770
But most of the conversations you read
online about this kind of manipulation,

94
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.350
these dark patterns, position it in
this way, that it's unethical or

95
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.354
irresponsible to use these dark patterns,
okay?

96
00:06:26.354 --> 00:06:29.511
And I only take issue with this approach,

97
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:33.574
not that it's inaccurate,
it's absolutely true.

98
00:06:33.574 --> 00:06:38.625
I do believe that it's unethical and
irresponsible to use dark patterns.

99
00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:44.009
But my problem with making
the argument in that way is that,

100
00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:46.923
a, it puts peoples' backs up.

101
00:06:46.923 --> 00:06:51.467
So you might be working in a company,
right, or you might have a client, and

102
00:06:51.467 --> 00:06:56.089
your client, or your stakeholders might
suggest some of these techniques.

103
00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:58.861
If you turn around to them and
say they're unethical,

104
00:06:58.861 --> 00:07:02.910
what you're basically saying to them
is you're an unethical person, right?

105
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.821
And nobody wants to be told that.

106
00:07:05.821 --> 00:07:08.716
So you're just gonna put their
backs up and annoy them.

107
00:07:08.716 --> 00:07:14.247
On top of which ethics is very
much open to interpretation, okay?

108
00:07:14.247 --> 00:07:16.704
So if you are a marketing manager,

109
00:07:16.704 --> 00:07:21.295
you're under enormous pressure
to increase conversion rate.

110
00:07:21.295 --> 00:07:23.737
You can justify anything in your head.

111
00:07:23.737 --> 00:07:27.885
So, if we go back to this screen for

112
00:07:27.885 --> 00:07:31.898
a moment and look at this design.

113
00:07:31.898 --> 00:07:37.239
I could justify this to myself ethically,
after all I'm giving them a choice.

114
00:07:37.239 --> 00:07:41.652
They don't have to have the insurance,
it's right there in black and white.
