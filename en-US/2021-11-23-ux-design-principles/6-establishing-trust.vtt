1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.806
So that's a little bit
about cognitive load.

2
00:00:01.806 --> 00:00:06.448
We're gonna explain cognitive load in
a huge amount more depth when we talk

3
00:00:06.448 --> 00:00:07.783
about design later.

4
00:00:07.783 --> 00:00:12.500
But the third psychological
pillar that we need to

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.441
build if we are going to
encourage high conversion is

6
00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:21.946
establishing trust and
overcoming cynicism.

7
00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:27.415
Trust is so, so important if we want
somebody to take action, right?

8
00:00:27.415 --> 00:00:29.897
If you want somebody to do anything,

9
00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:34.715
that person is gonna have to trust
you before they're willing to do it.

10
00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:39.274
And this applies in all aspects of life,
but also applies online.

11
00:00:39.274 --> 00:00:43.463
If we don't trust a website,
if we don't feel that it's reliable and

12
00:00:43.463 --> 00:00:46.173
it's gonna deliver, then we won't use it.

13
00:00:46.173 --> 00:00:48.255
We won't enter our personal information.

14
00:00:48.255 --> 00:00:50.789
We certainly won't buy anything off of it.

15
00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.449
So we need to establish trust.

16
00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.194
The problem is that, increasingly,

17
00:00:56.194 --> 00:01:01.955
people are becoming incredibly cynical and
so don't trust websites, right?

18
00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:07.113
We've learnt not to trust websites
because we've been lied to so many times.

19
00:01:07.113 --> 00:01:11.527
We don't trust marketing cuz
we've been lied to so many times.

20
00:01:11.527 --> 00:01:12.715
So how do we do this?

21
00:01:12.715 --> 00:01:15.903
How do we establish trust and
overcome cynicism?

22
00:01:15.903 --> 00:01:22.016
Well, the first thing you can do is
be open, honest, and transparent.

23
00:01:22.016 --> 00:01:25.337
The best example ever of this,
in my opinion, is Flickr.

24
00:01:25.337 --> 00:01:29.655
I don't know whether you remember
the photo sharing site Flickr.

25
00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:33.713
At one stage it was absolutely huge,
it was one of those web 2.0 companies.

26
00:01:33.713 --> 00:01:38.619
In its very early days, it had a group
of early adopters that were really into

27
00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.079
the service, but they had some
really big growth problems, right?

28
00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.402
Their servers would go down a lot,
people would complain about it.

29
00:01:46.402 --> 00:01:48.682
And then the unthinkable happened,

30
00:01:48.682 --> 00:01:52.442
which is they lost a large
number of people's photographs.

31
00:01:52.442 --> 00:01:55.342
You can't get much worse than that, right?

32
00:01:55.342 --> 00:02:01.105
So what Flickr did is instead
of releasing a legal statement

33
00:02:01.105 --> 00:02:06.060
that covered their asses,
they wrote a post saying

34
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.489
sometimes we suck, right,
and they just apologized.

35
00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.113
They apologized,
they said what went wrong,

36
00:02:14.113 --> 00:02:18.703
they said how they were gonna fix it, and
they said how they compensated people.

37
00:02:18.703 --> 00:02:25.057
No trying to wiggle out of it,
no corporate BS, nothing like that,

38
00:02:25.057 --> 00:02:30.522
they just were honest and
open and human and transparent.

39
00:02:30.522 --> 00:02:36.298
And that paid off hugely for them,
they turned those early adopters into

40
00:02:36.298 --> 00:02:41.895
advocates with their attitude and
their approach and their honesty.

41
00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:47.702
And so often we fail to do this
basic thing on our websites,

42
00:02:47.702 --> 00:02:53.638
when we fail to connect with
people as one human to another.

43
00:02:53.638 --> 00:02:59.109
Most of the things that we buy,
we buy one human to another.

44
00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.955
There's gotta be a trust and
a relationship there of some form or

45
00:03:03.955 --> 00:03:04.772
another.

46
00:03:04.772 --> 00:03:09.607
Let me give you an example of
how it can go wrong, right?

47
00:03:09.607 --> 00:03:13.337
So part of this is really
about being human and

48
00:03:13.337 --> 00:03:16.487
showing a degree of empathy, right?

49
00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:21.017
I work with a lot of higher
education websites, okay?

50
00:03:21.017 --> 00:03:25.064
And one of the websites I worked
with was the University of Essex.

51
00:03:25.064 --> 00:03:28.787
And I was helping them refine their
messaging to be more engaging.

52
00:03:28.787 --> 00:03:34.687
And I came across this piece of text
which is just a train wreck, right?

53
00:03:34.687 --> 00:03:39.212
As well as ensuring students make the most
of their potential through their academic

54
00:03:39.212 --> 00:03:43.291
studies, the University of Essex
provides an environment which caters for

55
00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:45.091
all of the needs of its students.

56
00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:48.842
By providing a range of accommodation,
catering facilities,

57
00:03:48.842 --> 00:03:52.250
an active student union,
sports, and the arts, right?

58
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.105
Now, set aside for a moment that
that is one long sentence, right?

59
00:03:58.105 --> 00:04:00.867
What the real killer there is,

60
00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:05.977
is the fact that it's like
Silence of the Lambs, right?

61
00:04:05.977 --> 00:04:08.667
Did you ever watch the film
Silence of the Lambs?

62
00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:11.504
In that film there is a serial killer,
right?

63
00:04:11.504 --> 00:04:14.244
And the serial killer kidnaps people.

64
00:04:14.244 --> 00:04:19.331
And the way that he copes with
the horrible things that he does

65
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:25.034
to the people he captures,
is he refers to them in the third person.

66
00:04:25.034 --> 00:04:30.116
She will put on the lotion is probably one
of the famous lines from that film, right?

67
00:04:30.116 --> 00:04:32.846
Not you'll put on the lotion, she will.

68
00:04:32.846 --> 00:04:35.697
And that's exactly what this
bit of text does, right?

69
00:04:35.697 --> 00:04:41.244
As well as insuring students, not you,
not the person reading it, but

70
00:04:41.244 --> 00:04:47.355
students, make the most of their
potential through their academic studies.

71
00:04:47.355 --> 00:04:53.018
The University of Essex, not us,
not we, right, it's all third person.

72
00:04:53.018 --> 00:04:57.327
And it totally undermines any
sense of humanity and empathy.

73
00:04:57.327 --> 00:05:02.546
And so often websites are full of
corporate BS that is painful to read,

74
00:05:02.546 --> 00:05:07.058
is dehumanizing, and
does nothing to improve conversion,

75
00:05:07.058 --> 00:05:09.631
it's just clever, slick lines.

76
00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:14.780
And we'll cover that in more
depth when we talk about content.

77
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.703
But then there's social proof, right?

78
00:05:16.703 --> 00:05:22.518
Everybody talks about social proof is
the best way of building trust, right?

79
00:05:22.518 --> 00:05:28.160
If this company and that company used it,
then it must be good.

80
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.639
Or if this person says it's good, this
person gave it a five star review, etc.

81
00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.073
Yes, that's correct,
social proof does work.

82
00:05:37.073 --> 00:05:41.897
And the reason it works is we prefer just
to kind of, rather than having to think

83
00:05:41.897 --> 00:05:47.181
and make a decision ourselves, it's easier
to say, well, what did this person do?

84
00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:50.278
They liked it, therefore it must be okay.

85
00:05:50.278 --> 00:05:53.105
So there is a huge power in social proof.

86
00:05:53.105 --> 00:05:57.055
The problem is,
is we've learned to become cynical.

87
00:05:57.055 --> 00:06:02.453
And that so often these days,
we don't believe social proof anymore.

88
00:06:02.453 --> 00:06:04.123
We don't believe testimonials.

89
00:06:04.123 --> 00:06:05.455
We don't believe ratings.

90
00:06:05.455 --> 00:06:07.808
We don't believe reviews, right?

91
00:06:07.808 --> 00:06:11.729
Cuz we've been fooled far too many times.

92
00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:16.382
So what can you do about that on your
websites as you go about creating them?

93
00:06:16.382 --> 00:06:20.662
Well, the first thing you can
do is use a known source, right?

94
00:06:20.662 --> 00:06:24.566
So if you're gonna use social proof,

95
00:06:24.566 --> 00:06:28.352
don't just use some random person.

96
00:06:28.352 --> 00:06:33.982
But try and quote, say, a publication
that they might have heard of,

97
00:06:33.982 --> 00:06:38.946
or a body that they might have
come across, or a celebrity, or

98
00:06:38.946 --> 00:06:44.116
even try and link to something
like a social media post, right?

99
00:06:44.116 --> 00:06:48.771
Because one of the common things I do is,
if I post a testimonial, I try and

100
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:51.259
take those testimonies from Twitter.

101
00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:55.587
Then I can include a link to
the person's bio where they say that

102
00:06:55.587 --> 00:06:59.434
particular quote and
it shows that it's a real person.

103
00:06:59.434 --> 00:07:01.696
Celebrity endorsements work in part,

104
00:07:01.696 --> 00:07:04.445
partly because we wanna
be like the celebrity.

105
00:07:04.445 --> 00:07:09.162
But part because they know that we know
that, well, if they just made that up

106
00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:13.360
about that celebrity,
the celebrity would have sued their asses,

107
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.540
so we kinda believe it's
something that's real.

108
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.696
So use a known source where you can.

109
00:07:18.696 --> 00:07:21.073
The other option is to rely on numbers.

110
00:07:21.073 --> 00:07:22.859
This is what Amazon does.

111
00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:27.357
When you see 5,000 reviews
of a particular product,

112
00:07:27.357 --> 00:07:30.292
then even if some of them are rubbish,

113
00:07:30.292 --> 00:07:34.441
they're not all gonna be made up,
so you get a sense.

114
00:07:34.441 --> 00:07:38.827
Then the other thing is not
to remove negative comments.

115
00:07:38.827 --> 00:07:45.815
One of the best reviews I ever had
talked about the work I was doing and

116
00:07:45.815 --> 00:07:51.331
how great it was, but
then went on to say things like,

117
00:07:51.331 --> 00:07:55.256
Paul's not afraid to challenge us and

118
00:07:55.256 --> 00:07:59.203
he can be quite provocative, right?

119
00:07:59.203 --> 00:08:03.412
Well, actually, that kind of reads quite
negatively, and I could have chopped that

120
00:08:03.412 --> 00:08:06.520
bit out and removed it, right,
and just gone for the good bit.

121
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.255
But actually by including those
slightly negative comments,

122
00:08:10.255 --> 00:08:14.209
it made people feel like the whole
thing was more likely to be true.

123
00:08:14.209 --> 00:08:17.590
If the reviews are too shining,
if they're too perfect,

124
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:22.423
if they're too great then people are
cynical about them, they don't trust them.

125
00:08:22.423 --> 00:08:24.990
I mentioned use social media already,

126
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.281
which is take posts from places
like Twitter and stuff like that.

127
00:08:29.281 --> 00:08:36.754
And when it comes to photos and
video, make sure they real, right?

128
00:08:36.754 --> 00:08:41.854
The number of times I've been to a site,
and it's like every

129
00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:47.654
single photograph of people that
have got testimonials on the site,

130
00:08:47.654 --> 00:08:53.854
they all look suspiciously like models,
and they're all very well lit,

131
00:08:53.854 --> 00:08:58.258
and they all look very much
like stock photography.

132
00:08:58.258 --> 00:09:03.614
And so instantly now I'm cynical about
the actual review that I'm reading.

133
00:09:03.614 --> 00:09:06.859
So the images we pick to go with
these things is really important.

134
00:09:06.859 --> 00:09:09.247
Make it a real picture of the person,

135
00:09:09.247 --> 00:09:13.340
even if that picture of the person
is shit, it looks terrible.

136
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.960
And the same is true with video, right?

137
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:21.159
Have you ever seen one of these
videos introducing a product and

138
00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:26.472
then they have customers,
using Acme has transformed my life.

139
00:09:26.472 --> 00:09:29.535
And there's some really interesting
stuff that goes on there.

140
00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:33.705
For a start they're word perfect,
they don't go umm or ahh in any of it.

141
00:09:33.705 --> 00:09:38.850
It's all very well lit, it looks
very professional, it looks great.

142
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.841
But it also feels false,
it doesn't feel real.

143
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:46.450
They're obviously reading
off the teleprompter, okay?

144
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:47.292
So actually,

145
00:09:47.292 --> 00:09:52.146
some of the best testimonial videos I've
ever seen were just recorded over Zoom.

146
00:09:52.146 --> 00:09:55.548
And you can see it was recorded over Zoom,
it looks terrible quality.

147
00:09:55.548 --> 00:10:01.223
The person's umming and ahhing, their
audio sounds awful, but he's compelling

148
00:10:01.223 --> 00:10:06.750
and believable because it's got real
content, it's obviously a real person.

149
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:11.253
And the final way, the best type of
social proof is if you can get into

150
00:10:11.253 --> 00:10:15.993
a position where you start connecting
your customers to one another and

151
00:10:15.993 --> 00:10:18.845
they start enthusing about your product.

152
00:10:18.845 --> 00:10:22.535
Let me give you a really
silly example of this.

153
00:10:22.535 --> 00:10:24.922
I collect paperclips.

154
00:10:24.922 --> 00:10:26.122
Now, the chances are,

155
00:10:26.122 --> 00:10:29.548
you're having a little snigger in
your head at that point, right?

156
00:10:29.548 --> 00:10:31.896
That's really sad, okay?

157
00:10:31.896 --> 00:10:33.447
Who collects paper clips?

158
00:10:33.447 --> 00:10:34.369
That's pathetic.

159
00:10:34.369 --> 00:10:36.409
I don't actually collect paper clips,

160
00:10:36.409 --> 00:10:38.937
I just wanted to get that reaction in you,
right?

161
00:10:38.937 --> 00:10:42.645
But imagine now we're in a pub, right?

162
00:10:42.645 --> 00:10:47.559
And we're all sitting around and
I announce that I like paper clips, right,

163
00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:49.309
and I collect paper clips.

164
00:10:49.309 --> 00:10:52.507
Then people are gonna laugh at me, right?

165
00:10:52.507 --> 00:10:55.176
And everybody's gonna go,
you got paper clips.

166
00:10:55.176 --> 00:11:02.156
And that's like, you have this kind of
moment of, I'm gonna shut up then, right?

167
00:11:02.156 --> 00:11:06.169
I'm not gonna carry on talking
about paperclips, I'm gonna stop.

168
00:11:06.169 --> 00:11:10.951
But imagine a scenario now where I go,
I like paper clips, or I collect paper

169
00:11:10.951 --> 00:11:15.985
clips, and somebody else goes no way,
you don't, I collect paper clips too.

170
00:11:15.985 --> 00:11:19.283
And then we start enthusing with
one another about paper clips.

171
00:11:19.283 --> 00:11:23.923
And everybody else is a bit more
reluctant now to take the mickey of me,

172
00:11:23.923 --> 00:11:25.898
right, and to joke about it.

173
00:11:25.898 --> 00:11:27.929
And in fact they start going,
well, actually,

174
00:11:27.929 --> 00:11:31.706
maybe there's something in paperclips,
perhaps I'm missing something here, right?

175
00:11:31.706 --> 00:11:35.579
It's like we were talking before we
started recording about Ted Lasso,

176
00:11:35.579 --> 00:11:39.018
and about how everybody keeps
telling you how good Ted Lasso is.

177
00:11:39.018 --> 00:11:43.995
And so that kind of word of mouth
recommendation is really powerful, but

178
00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:48.809
it's so much more powerful when you
bring together your customers and

179
00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:51.111
get them talking to one another.

180
00:11:51.111 --> 00:11:54.326
And you can use this on your website,
create environments where they can

181
00:11:54.326 --> 00:11:56.763
share with one another and
interact with one another.

182
00:11:56.763 --> 00:11:59.341
Cuz it will create a buzz and
enthusiasm around

183
00:11:59.341 --> 00:12:02.924
your product that actually attracts and
draws in other people.

184
00:12:02.924 --> 00:12:06.634
So social proof is incredibly
powerful at building trust, but

185
00:12:06.634 --> 00:12:08.738
only if it's done in the right way.

186
00:12:08.738 --> 00:12:14.722
Another way I love building trust is
through telling stories on websites.

187
00:12:14.722 --> 00:12:16.968
And there are all kinds
of stories you can tell.

188
00:12:16.968 --> 00:12:19.474
You can tell stories about
how the company was founded.

189
00:12:19.474 --> 00:12:23.821
So, for example,
we all know Google started, not Google,

190
00:12:23.821 --> 00:12:28.179
Apple, started in a garage,
in a suburban garage, right?

191
00:12:28.179 --> 00:12:33.361
And we all know that early story, and
that helps humanize the company and make

192
00:12:33.361 --> 00:12:38.956
the company feel not like the massive,
gigantic, ridiculous company that it is.

193
00:12:38.956 --> 00:12:41.720
So talking about the company and
its origins and

194
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.296
its ethos and what was behind it, that
helps to make connections with people.

195
00:12:46.296 --> 00:12:49.557
You can also tell the story about your
products and how they came about.

196
00:12:49.557 --> 00:12:53.580
Go spend a bit of time looking
through Kickstarter, right?

197
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.175
If you go to the Kickstarter,
or Indiegogo,

198
00:12:56.175 --> 00:12:59.247
or whatever it is,
those kinds of sites, they always

199
00:12:59.247 --> 00:13:03.780
have these videos where they tell the
story about how their product came to be.

200
00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.524
The process they went through for

201
00:13:05.524 --> 00:13:08.958
creating it, where the idea came from,
all of this kinda stuff.

202
00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:12.786
And they do that because by telling
this story, it starts to humanize

203
00:13:12.786 --> 00:13:16.681
the product and the service and
encourage people to interact with it.

204
00:13:16.681 --> 00:13:21.798
Because we're programmed as humans
to pay attention to stories, right?

205
00:13:21.798 --> 00:13:26.756
Again, going back to the savannahs of
Africa, if someone stumbles back into

206
00:13:26.756 --> 00:13:31.028
a camp mauled half to death by
a saber toothed tiger, you wanna hear

207
00:13:31.028 --> 00:13:35.705
the story about what happened so
you can learn from it and avoid it again.

208
00:13:35.705 --> 00:13:38.269
So we'll pay a lot of
attention to stories, and

209
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:41.232
stories help to make connections and
relationships.

210
00:13:41.232 --> 00:13:43.301
We can also tell the story
of your customers and

211
00:13:43.301 --> 00:13:46.234
the cool things they're doing
with your products and services.

212
00:13:46.234 --> 00:13:50.145
And then finally,
you can tell the story of your people,

213
00:13:50.145 --> 00:13:52.192
the people behind the brand.

214
00:13:52.192 --> 00:13:54.380
I'll give you two quick examples of this.

215
00:13:54.380 --> 00:14:00.738
Number one was Apple,
not Apple, Microsoft, right?

216
00:14:00.738 --> 00:14:04.893
I don't know how many of you are as
old and decrepit as I am and

217
00:14:04.893 --> 00:14:10.132
were designing websites in the late 90s,
in what was called at the time,

218
00:14:10.132 --> 00:14:13.897
very melodramatically,
the browser wars, right?

219
00:14:13.897 --> 00:14:18.683
And in this period of time,
all the browsers were competing

220
00:14:18.683 --> 00:14:22.705
with each other with
different functionality and

221
00:14:22.705 --> 00:14:27.027
support that they provided,
except for Microsoft.

222
00:14:27.027 --> 00:14:30.202
Microsoft released IE6 and then stopped,

223
00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:34.936
they did nothing with IE6 for
years, years and years and years.

224
00:14:34.936 --> 00:14:38.154
And all the other browsers
were moving forward and

225
00:14:38.154 --> 00:14:41.066
supporting more and
more web standards, but

226
00:14:41.066 --> 00:14:46.058
then there was this steaming pile of
turd sitting in the corner that was IE6.

227
00:14:46.058 --> 00:14:50.686
And everybody in the development
community came to absolutely

228
00:14:50.686 --> 00:14:53.052
despise Microsoft as a result.

229
00:14:53.052 --> 00:14:57.721
And in the end, there was a group within
Microsoft of developers who got so

230
00:14:57.721 --> 00:15:01.558
fed up with this, so
fed up with being the butt of every joke,

231
00:15:01.558 --> 00:15:06.377
being just persecuted for working at
Microsoft that they set up something,

232
00:15:06.377 --> 00:15:08.660
I think it was called Channel Nine.

233
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.721
I'm not quite sure, it was a blog, right?

234
00:15:11.721 --> 00:15:16.370
And they did it behind the backs of all
the corporate people and behind the backs

235
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:21.162
of marketing, and they set up this blog,
sharing what they were doing, right,

236
00:15:21.162 --> 00:15:24.351
in their day to day lives,
and just talking about it.

237
00:15:24.351 --> 00:15:29.349
And that blog completely changed
the dynamics of people's perception

238
00:15:29.349 --> 00:15:30.439
of Microsoft.

239
00:15:30.439 --> 00:15:35.721
Cuz it was easy to hate on Microsoft, but
it was really difficult to hate on Alex,

240
00:15:35.721 --> 00:15:39.078
who you knew from all
the videos you were watching.

241
00:15:39.078 --> 00:15:44.257
So showing the people behind your brand
really helps to create a relationship and

242
00:15:44.257 --> 00:15:45.179
build trust.

243
00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:48.017
Another great example is, I worked for

244
00:15:48.017 --> 00:15:52.752
a company that sold frozen ready
meals to the over 80s, right?

245
00:15:52.752 --> 00:15:58.295
Very niche product, but
they were hugely successful.

246
00:15:58.295 --> 00:16:03.282
And we decided, they had a blog
that they needed for SEO purposes,

247
00:16:03.282 --> 00:16:05.522
don't even get me into that.

248
00:16:05.522 --> 00:16:10.267
But as part of that, we did some video,
which is well-known to help us SEO,

249
00:16:10.267 --> 00:16:14.735
I don't understand the logic of it,
but anyway, we ended up doing it.

250
00:16:14.735 --> 00:16:16.615
And we would profile different people.

251
00:16:16.615 --> 00:16:21.505
And obviously, we profiled the CEO, and we
profiled the chefs that created the meals,

252
00:16:21.505 --> 00:16:22.839
and it was fair enough.

253
00:16:22.839 --> 00:16:25.958
But eventually we got a little bit
more desperate of people to profile.

254
00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:30.601
So we decided to do a little
interview with a guy called Alexei,

255
00:16:30.601 --> 00:16:32.187
I think his name was.

256
00:16:32.187 --> 00:16:36.899
And he worked in the frozen area,
the packing area where

257
00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:41.217
all these frozen ready
meals was shipped out from.

258
00:16:41.217 --> 00:16:44.656
And he worked in minus 30 all day,
this guy did.

259
00:16:44.656 --> 00:16:48.788
And he was a great guy, Polish guy,
very very enthusiastic,

260
00:16:48.788 --> 00:16:53.795
really really lovely guy, and he
literally had icicles on his mustache and

261
00:16:53.795 --> 00:16:57.550
his beard from working in
these kinds of temperatures.

262
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.641
But he was so positive and upbeat.

263
00:16:59.641 --> 00:17:03.660
And we post this video of him,
he got fan mail, right?

264
00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.229
And I'm not talking fan emails here,

265
00:17:06.229 --> 00:17:10.089
I'm talking real mail through the post,
handwritten.

266
00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:12.716
And he was so good,
he was such an ambassador for

267
00:17:12.716 --> 00:17:15.150
the company at building relationships.

268
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.760
So tell stories, I've gone on about
that too long, but you get the idea.
