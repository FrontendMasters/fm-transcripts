1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.342
Another thing that is a really important
is about simplifying not just,

2
00:00:06.342 --> 00:00:11.076
we've talked about the need for
simplification a lot.

3
00:00:11.076 --> 00:00:14.476
We've talked about it in terms
of reducing cognitive load.

4
00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:18.127
We're gonna talk about it again in
terms of designing an interface.

5
00:00:18.127 --> 00:00:23.626
We've talked about it in terms of
keeping our copy concise and simple.

6
00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:26.743
But there's also something to be said for

7
00:00:26.743 --> 00:00:31.027
simplifying the choices that
you put in front of people.

8
00:00:31.027 --> 00:00:35.377
And actually somebody in the chat
room touched upon this when they were

9
00:00:35.377 --> 00:00:40.317
talking about Apple and the complexity
of offerings that they had at one stage,

10
00:00:40.317 --> 00:00:42.542
it's now a lot simpler than it was.

11
00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:47.665
And this is a really interesting scenario.

12
00:00:47.665 --> 00:00:52.340
One of the big mistakes that I
find that people make when they're

13
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.374
asking people to act, is they ask
them to do too many things, right?

14
00:00:57.374 --> 00:01:00.221
And again,
we're gonna come on to this more later.

15
00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:03.815
But we want you to buy our product,
sign up for

16
00:01:03.815 --> 00:01:08.555
our newsletter, get in touch,
follow us on social media.

17
00:01:08.555 --> 00:01:12.520
All of these different things, they're
all competing for people's attention.

18
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.768
And that's just on the website, and
then there's people's product line ups.

19
00:01:16.768 --> 00:01:22.075
Where they have, loads of different
products that are all competing for

20
00:01:22.075 --> 00:01:25.564
attention, or
loads of different offerings.

21
00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:30.889
And actually there's a need
to kind of simplify what you

22
00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:35.891
present to users so
that you don't overwhelm them.

23
00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:40.446
Because what happens is they get
paralyzed with choice, choice paralysis.

24
00:01:40.446 --> 00:01:43.318
There was a famous study that was done in

25
00:01:43.318 --> 00:01:47.246
California in a supermarket
with preserves, jams.

26
00:01:47.246 --> 00:01:51.840
If you're British, we call them jam, but
everybody else calls them preserves.

27
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.662
And what they did is they tried,
first of all,

28
00:01:55.662 --> 00:01:59.302
they had a whole variety
of different jams.

29
00:01:59.302 --> 00:02:05.743
I think it was over 30 varieties of jams
for people to buy in the supermarket.

30
00:02:05.743 --> 00:02:08.771
And then a week or so
later they changed that so

31
00:02:08.771 --> 00:02:11.253
there was just six varieties of jam.

32
00:02:11.253 --> 00:02:13.598
Now if you ask an individual
do they want more choice?

33
00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:16.341
They will always say yes, of course.

34
00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:21.784
But in truth, the 6 jams outsold
the 30 several times over,

35
00:02:21.784 --> 00:02:27.857
because people were overwhelmed
with 30 different choices of jam.

36
00:02:27.857 --> 00:02:32.423
And this idea of simplifying the options
to avoid choice paralysis is really

37
00:02:32.423 --> 00:02:33.217
important.

38
00:02:33.217 --> 00:02:36.757
And it applies to everything we do
from the number of navigation items,

39
00:02:36.757 --> 00:02:40.415
the number of e-commerce categories,
to even the number of products and

40
00:02:40.415 --> 00:02:41.958
calls to action that you have.

41
00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.600
And actually Apple is one of
the best examples of this.

42
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.307
There was a period of time when
Steve Jobs wasn't running Apple,

43
00:02:51.307 --> 00:02:55.582
and in that time their
product lineup exploded.

44
00:02:55.582 --> 00:02:59.447
And they ended up with a whole
number of different products and

45
00:02:59.447 --> 00:03:03.697
it was overwhelmingly confusing
to know which product suited you.

46
00:03:03.697 --> 00:03:07.157
But when Steve Jobs came
back into the company,

47
00:03:07.157 --> 00:03:12.622
one of the first things he did on
a whiteboard was draw something like this.

48
00:03:12.622 --> 00:03:17.751
Where he basically identified his
two audiences and his two use cases.

49
00:03:17.751 --> 00:03:21.152
And then he associated
one product with each.

50
00:03:21.152 --> 00:03:26.690
So he radically simplified the lineup
of products that they had so that users

51
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.504
knew what they wanted ,what they needed,
what was right for their situation.

52
00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:36.539
And actually increasingly that's
becoming a problem again in Apple,

53
00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.106
that they are adding more and
more products.

54
00:03:39.106 --> 00:03:43.492
So for example when I wanted
a lightweight device for

55
00:03:43.492 --> 00:03:49.277
me traveling to conferences and
doing presentations like this one,

56
00:03:49.277 --> 00:03:52.583
do I get the MacBook Air or the MacBook?

57
00:03:52.583 --> 00:03:55.239
Or the iPad and which size do I need?

58
00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.362
And should I actually go for
a MacBook Pro?

59
00:03:57.362 --> 00:04:01.275
There were so many options that
actually it was overwhelming for

60
00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:03.453
a long time I didn't buy anything.

61
00:04:03.453 --> 00:04:10.608
So what this comes down to especially
when it comes to calls to action,

62
00:04:10.608 --> 00:04:14.990
is to simplify the question effectively.

63
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.673
The question is, what should I buy?

64
00:04:17.673 --> 00:04:19.368
What action should I take?

65
00:04:19.368 --> 00:04:24.916
And the more you simplify that, the easier
people are gonna find it to act.

66
00:04:24.916 --> 00:04:30.042
You remember earlier on I talked
about that when we're presented

67
00:04:30.042 --> 00:04:34.898
with a difficult question,
we tend to just give up and guess.

68
00:04:34.898 --> 00:04:39.485
Or the other thing we do is
just abandon and don't try and

69
00:04:39.485 --> 00:04:41.933
answer that question at all.

70
00:04:41.933 --> 00:04:44.914
So this applies not just to
your product lineups, but

71
00:04:44.914 --> 00:04:49.106
actually even to the wording that you
have for things like calls to action.

72
00:04:49.106 --> 00:04:50.551
Let me explain what I mean.

73
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:53.219
So I did some work with UNICEF, and

74
00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:57.543
on their donation page they had this,
make a donation.

75
00:04:57.543 --> 00:05:02.928
Now when you're faced with
a call to action like that,

76
00:05:02.928 --> 00:05:09.615
that's quite a hard call to action
to make a decision over, right?

77
00:05:09.615 --> 00:05:14.439
So because the question
that goes alongside that,

78
00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:19.945
is UNICEF the most worthy
charity of my donation, right?

79
00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:23.207
And that's quite a complicated
question to answer in your mind.

80
00:05:23.207 --> 00:05:27.017
Because where there's lots
of different charities,

81
00:05:27.017 --> 00:05:31.235
what causes do I care about the most,
how much can I afford and

82
00:05:31.235 --> 00:05:35.645
all of these kinds of different
things that go alongside that.

83
00:05:35.645 --> 00:05:40.802
So that's a big decision to make when it
comes to that and people often choke.

84
00:05:40.802 --> 00:05:45.385
If you could look at the number of people
that go to donation pages across all

85
00:05:45.385 --> 00:05:49.024
charity websites and
you find the conversion rate is very,

86
00:05:49.024 --> 00:05:53.204
very low even though they've clicked
through to a donations page.

87
00:05:53.204 --> 00:05:57.869
However if you reword that slightly to
donate to end the suffering of children,

88
00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:02.464
you're effectively simplifying
the question in people's minds, from, is

89
00:06:02.464 --> 00:06:07.336
UNICEF the best charity to give to, to do
I wanna reduce the suffering of children,

90
00:06:07.336 --> 00:06:09.588
which is a kinda no-brainer really.

91
00:06:09.588 --> 00:06:14.641
So it's focusing people on
the key point here, right?

92
00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:18.850
Instead of the question being,
what's the best charity to give to,

93
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.271
the question is you can help
end suffering of children.

94
00:06:22.271 --> 00:06:25.121
Now again you need to be
a little bit careful,

95
00:06:25.121 --> 00:06:29.399
because some people might find
that emotional blackmail, right?

96
00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:32.090
Saying donate to end
the suffering of children,

97
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.825
especially if it read something like, do I
want to reduce the suffering of children.

98
00:06:36.825 --> 00:06:41.703
It could be emotional blackmail and so you
need to be careful with your audience and

99
00:06:41.703 --> 00:06:43.337
see how they respond to it.

100
00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:48.061
But the principle of taking something
complex and simplifying it down so

101
00:06:48.061 --> 00:06:52.486
it's easily understandable needs
to underpin all of our content.
