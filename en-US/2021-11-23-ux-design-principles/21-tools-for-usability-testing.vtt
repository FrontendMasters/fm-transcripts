1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.486
Then of course, you're gonna probably
produce some form of design comp or

2
00:00:04.486 --> 00:00:06.416
mockup or something like that.

3
00:00:06.416 --> 00:00:09.652
And we've actually already test briefly,
sorry,

4
00:00:09.652 --> 00:00:14.736
we've already touched briefly on the kinds
of tests that you can do at this stage.

5
00:00:14.736 --> 00:00:19.229
So I talked about the five second test,
where you show them the design for

6
00:00:19.229 --> 00:00:23.222
five seconds, then you hide it and
you ask them some questions.

7
00:00:23.222 --> 00:00:28.121
You might ask them which was the question
I said previously of what items did

8
00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:29.460
you see on the page?

9
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.596
And that gives you an idea of whether
you got the visual hierarchy right.

10
00:00:34.596 --> 00:00:38.382
You could also make note of the order
in which people have written stuff in,

11
00:00:38.382 --> 00:00:41.928
because the things they write first
are the things that had the biggest

12
00:00:41.928 --> 00:00:42.787
impact on them.

13
00:00:42.787 --> 00:00:47.020
So that can give you an idea of whether
you've got the emphasis of the page right.

14
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.843
Or another one often asked is,

15
00:00:48.843 --> 00:00:53.415
please describe in your own words what
the website you've just seen offers.

16
00:00:53.415 --> 00:00:57.316
And that's often a very depressing test
to read because you think you've been

17
00:00:57.316 --> 00:01:00.212
really clear and
said exactly what your website is about,

18
00:01:00.212 --> 00:01:03.427
and then they think it's about
something entirely different.

19
00:01:03.427 --> 00:01:06.438
Something as fundamental as what do you do

20
00:01:06.438 --> 00:01:09.884
often can be poorly
communicated on websites.

21
00:01:09.884 --> 00:01:13.243
So five second test,
really great little test to run.

22
00:01:13.243 --> 00:01:17.133
As I said, you can do that
on a tool like UsabilityHub.

23
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:21.324
Then there's first click tests,
which I mentioned earlier, so

24
00:01:21.324 --> 00:01:25.604
you ask people to click on a graphic
to complete a particular task.

25
00:01:25.604 --> 00:01:29.838
So where would you click to sign up for
our newsletter?

26
00:01:29.838 --> 00:01:32.110
And are people clicking
in the right place?

27
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.107
And you'll get a heat map like this
sort of show where people have clicked.

28
00:01:36.107 --> 00:01:40.964
And you can very quickly get an idea
of whether people are getting confused

29
00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:45.833
by two areas that are named very similar
or might have similar content in.

30
00:01:45.833 --> 00:01:50.665
So this is really great where
a client insists on going with,

31
00:01:50.665 --> 00:01:55.230
the classic one is you have
a series of products, right?

32
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.945
And each product has
got its own fancy name,

33
00:01:58.945 --> 00:02:04.180
the Robo 3000 and the Navigator Pro and
things like that.

34
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.937
And the client is going with our product
names, we must have them, right?

35
00:02:07.937 --> 00:02:12.010
And so you end up with these content
blocks for each product, okay?

36
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.570
And you know nobody's gonna have
a clue what any of those things are.

37
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.092
So what you do is you run a quick test,
the first click test that says,

38
00:02:21.092 --> 00:02:25.758
click on the, you want to find
out more about a product that

39
00:02:25.758 --> 00:02:29.490
enables you to do XYZ,
where would you click?

40
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.963
And of course,
the product names don't describe that.

41
00:02:31.963 --> 00:02:35.677
And so people don't know where to click,
they click in the wrong place, and you've

42
00:02:35.677 --> 00:02:39.096
got evidence then to say Mr. Client, Mr.
Stakeholder, you are a dumbass.

43
00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:42.560
But you don't say it like
that because you're nice.

44
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.972
So first click test can be really useful.

45
00:02:44.972 --> 00:02:48.888
And then there's what I call
the semantic differential survey,

46
00:02:48.888 --> 00:02:51.890
which often can be called
a brand keyword survey.

47
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.053
Which is where you show the design
to people and you say, on a scale of

48
00:02:56.053 --> 00:03:00.874
one to five, how much do you agree with
the statement this design is friendly or

49
00:03:00.874 --> 00:03:02.356
trustworthy, etc.?

50
00:03:02.356 --> 00:03:06.068
Or you show them the competition and
your design together, and

51
00:03:06.068 --> 00:03:09.862
you go select the design above
that you consider most friendly.

52
00:03:09.862 --> 00:03:14.548
So you can start to build up a picture
then of what's friendly, what's not,

53
00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:18.676
what's working and what isn't from
the aesthetics point of view.

54
00:03:18.676 --> 00:03:22.366
And all of that, as I said, you can do
with a tool called usabilityhub.com.

55
00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:25.273
I think it's quite a pricey tool for
what it is, but

56
00:03:25.273 --> 00:03:29.008
they have a free option that I think
is a really good free account.

57
00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:33.895
So you can get away with doing
most of what I've talked about

58
00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:36.151
using their free account.

59
00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:39.110
And then I talked about eye tracking,
didn't I?

60
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.434
And I talked about potentially, I like
to think of eye tracking as like, or

61
00:03:43.434 --> 00:03:47.899
particularly eye tracking simulation
software, as like a spell checker for

62
00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:48.669
designers.

63
00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:52.468
How do you know people are gonna
look where you want them to?

64
00:03:52.468 --> 00:03:56.766
It's not 100% accurate all the time, but
it will give you a pretty good idea.

65
00:03:56.766 --> 00:04:01.044
So you can use Attention Insight,
which is the website on the right, for

66
00:04:01.044 --> 00:04:05.255
that kinda simulation software,
where you can just upload a design and

67
00:04:05.255 --> 00:04:09.140
it'll create heat map based on
where it thinks people will look.

68
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.734
I use that all the time, just using their
free account, to sanity check for me.

69
00:04:13.734 --> 00:04:15.259
It's also really good for

70
00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:19.141
showing to clients when they complain
that maybe the call to action

71
00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:23.179
isn't visible enough or that my logo
needs to be bigger or whatever.

72
00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:27.227
You've got evidence to prove that
people are seeing that stuff.

73
00:04:27.227 --> 00:04:30.003
If you wanna do real eye tracking,
believe it or not,

74
00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:32.795
that is now possible without
any special equipment.

75
00:04:32.795 --> 00:04:35.199
All you need is a laptop with a webcam.

76
00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:40.003
And there's this amazing software called
RealEye that will help you with that.

77
00:04:40.003 --> 00:04:44.981
But maybe we're getting a bit carried away
talking about eye tracking studies in

78
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:45.646
this one.

79
00:04:45.646 --> 00:04:49.937
But hopefully I'm showing you
relatively lightweight quick ways.

80
00:04:49.937 --> 00:04:54.550
Uploading a graphic to Attention Insight
takes like 30 seconds and

81
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.140
you get instant sense of
where people are gonna look.

82
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.807
So after the design, you might go
into building a more fancy prototype,

83
00:05:02.807 --> 00:05:06.490
where all your pages interlink and
it's high fidelity.

84
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.617
You might be skipping some of these
stages, and that's fine if you are.

85
00:05:09.617 --> 00:05:13.273
I'm not saying that everybody
needs to do all of this.

86
00:05:13.273 --> 00:05:15.659
But if you do prototyping, again,

87
00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:19.645
some remote facilitated testing
tends to work quite well.

88
00:05:19.645 --> 00:05:23.097
The reason I do it facilitated here,
in other words,

89
00:05:23.097 --> 00:05:28.162
you sit in on the sessions and kinda help
people, is with a prototype website,

90
00:05:28.162 --> 00:05:32.180
there's obviously bits that work and
bits that don't work.

91
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.163
So people need a bit of help
when they inevitably click

92
00:05:35.163 --> 00:05:38.423
on something that's broken or
isn't working properly.

93
00:05:38.423 --> 00:05:39.603
So you need to be around for that.

94
00:05:39.603 --> 00:05:42.596
Well, when you're testing a live site,

95
00:05:42.596 --> 00:05:46.715
you can do it unfacilitated
cuz everything should work.

96
00:05:46.715 --> 00:05:51.405
And then when you get into the actual
build, you're actually building the thing,

97
00:05:51.405 --> 00:05:56.028
sure, I mean, you should be able to do
some unfacilitated remote testing right at

98
00:05:56.028 --> 00:05:56.907
the end there.

99
00:05:56.907 --> 00:06:01.800
Point people at a website and
ask them to complete certain key tasks.

100
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.294
Oftentimes I'll do bit more eye
tracking stuff at that point

101
00:06:06.294 --> 00:06:11.314
because we've got a lot of changes
have been made as we go along, but

102
00:06:11.314 --> 00:06:16.620
all fairly simple stuff that shouldn't
be too time-consuming to do.

103
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.411
You don't need to do all of that
testing I've outlined there.

104
00:06:20.411 --> 00:06:23.938
You can just pick and
choose what you've got the time and

105
00:06:23.938 --> 00:06:26.278
the budget to do within the project.

106
00:06:26.278 --> 00:06:28.956
I would advise if you're
gonna do anything,

107
00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:33.054
test early because that's when you
get the most value from testing.

108
00:06:33.054 --> 00:06:38.001
If I could only pick one stage to test,
it would be to test design comps.

109
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:42.904
Because not only do you get the benefit of
things like first click tests that tell

110
00:06:42.904 --> 00:06:45.550
you if you've got your navigation right.

111
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.278
You get the five second test which
tells you whether you got your

112
00:06:49.278 --> 00:06:51.037
visual hierarchy right, and

113
00:06:51.037 --> 00:06:55.978
your brand keyword test that tells you
whether you've got your aesthetics right.

114
00:06:55.978 --> 00:06:59.220
So not only do you get a lot
of real valuable data, but

115
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.811
it also avoids that endless iteration and
back and forth with the client.

116
00:07:03.811 --> 00:07:08.169
So I think you get the most bang for
your buck at the design stage, but

117
00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:10.860
really, you can be testing throughout.
