00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.602
Hello, and welcome to this course
on creating compelling websites,

2
00:00:04.602 --> 00:00:09.090
websites that convert and
encourage people to take action.

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.754
My name is Paul Boag, and
over the next few hours,

4
00:00:12.754 --> 00:00:19.500
we're gonna explore exactly what is
involved in creating a compelling website.

5
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.740
And I'm hoping you're gonna
join me on this journey.

6
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.408
And the idea is that what we're
gonna get into are techniques and

7
00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:33.560
approaches we can use without having
to resort to things like dark patterns.

8
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.515
So we're gonna explore all these different
subject areas over the next few hours,

9
00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:42.834
or maybe hopefully apply some of those
techniques to various websites so

10
00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:46.620
you can actually see these
techniques in action.

11
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.957
But let me start off by talking
a little bit about myself and

12
00:00:49.957 --> 00:00:54.020
my background and
why I'm doing this particular workshop.

13
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.010
So I've worked in digital
since about 1994,

14
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.855
which means that I have years
of experience of doing all kinds

15
00:01:02.855 --> 00:01:06.760
of different aspects of
the web design process.

16
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.356
So when I started out,

17
00:01:08.356 --> 00:01:13.648
I would do the whole thing from designs
to code to even writing the content.

18
00:01:13.648 --> 00:01:18.546
But over the years, I've come to
specialize in user experience design and

19
00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:21.657
in particular conversion
rate optimisation,

20
00:01:21.657 --> 00:01:25.098
encouraging people to take
action on the websites.

21
00:01:25.098 --> 00:01:27.517
But I was noticing an annoying trend,

22
00:01:27.517 --> 00:01:32.281
which I'm sure you've noticed yourself,
which are websites that become

23
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:37.760
increasingly manipulative in the way
that they encourage you to take action.

24
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.417
And that really made me
deeply uncomfortable.

25
00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:45.247
Because what I strongly believe that you
can actually create a compelling website

26
00:01:45.247 --> 00:01:48.747
without having to resort to
those kinds of techniques, and

27
00:01:48.747 --> 00:01:52.210
I ended up writing a book
on it called Click.

28
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.816
And Click basically proposes
an approach to creating compelling

29
00:01:56.816 --> 00:02:01.310
websites that doesn't involve
that kind of manipulation.

30
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.455
And so that is essentially what we're
gonna be looking at over the next

31
00:02:04.455 --> 00:02:05.000
few hours.

32
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.846
We're gonna look at how to
go about doing that, and

33
00:02:08.846 --> 00:02:13.840
exactly what is involved in
creating a compelling website.

34
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.030
So very loosely, this is gonna be
our agenda for the coming hours.

35
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.520
We're gonna start off by looking
at the four pillars to conversion.

36
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.813
So these are kind of very practical
psychological elements of

37
00:02:29.813 --> 00:02:36.341
our personality that we can use in order
to encourage people to take action.

38
00:02:36.341 --> 00:02:40.599
Now, you might immediately be worried
that I'm starting to use psychology to

39
00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.420
encourage people to take action, doesn't
that sound a lot like manipulation?

40
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.240
Well, you'll find out that actually that
isn't the case, and I'll explain why.

41
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.390
Then we're gonna look at how to
create a compelling offering.

42
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.776
So how to take whatever it is that
you're looking to promote and

43
00:02:57.776 --> 00:03:02.412
structure it in such a way that's
actually compelling to people,

44
00:03:02.412 --> 00:03:05.830
that is something that
they want to take part in.

45
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.552
And then after that, we're gonna
move into looking at design and

46
00:03:11.552 --> 00:03:15.191
how design can shape our
perception of a product and

47
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:19.167
service and also can guide us
around the various content

48
00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:24.180
in order to understand what
the product and service can offer us.

49
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.902
And then finally, we're gonna look at
how to go about optimising a website in

50
00:03:28.902 --> 00:03:31.450
order to encourage conversion.

51
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.540
So that's the basic plan for the day.

52
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.970
Now, as you can tell,
this is covering a lot of different areas.

53
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.050
We're gonna be talking about copywriting.

54
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.590
We're gonna be talking about marketing.

55
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.960
We're gonna be talking about
user interface design.

56
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.991
We're gonna to be talking
about broader UX design, and

57
00:03:47.991 --> 00:03:52.170
we're even gonna to be touching on
development a little bit as well.

58
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.350
So there's a huge amount of
different skill sets that

59
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.610
are required in order to
create a compelling website.

60
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.600
Fortunately, you don't need to be
an expert in all of these areas,

61
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.220
you only need to understand the basics in
each of them in order to be able to start

62
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.870
creating a compelling website.

63
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.620
Really, the techniques that I'm gonna be
sharing apply to pretty much any website.

64
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.911
I've worked on very small mom and
pop businesses over the years,

65
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:23.046
all the way up to working with
international brands like Puma,

66
00:04:23.046 --> 00:04:27.130
or Doctors Without Borders,
those kinds of people.

67
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.602
And actually,
it works on pretty much any sector.

68
00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:34.732
So whether you're a charity looking to
increase donations, or you're trying to

69
00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:39.786
encourage people to sign up to your SAS
App, or whether you're selling products

70
00:04:39.786 --> 00:04:44.792
on an e-commerce site, whatever the case,
these techniques are gonna help.

71
00:04:44.792 --> 00:04:48.315
So I hope you're as excited as I
am about getting into all of this.

72
00:04:48.315 --> 00:04:54.290
And let's begin then by looking at those
four psychological pillars to conversion

73
00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:00.480
and how they're critical to your success
in encouraging people to take action.

74
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.430
&gt;&gt; Someone has mentioned the nudge
theory when you reference psychology.

75
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.142
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna talk about nudging
people to take action to some extent, but

76
00:05:10.142 --> 00:05:15.854
that we're also gonna explore a whole load
of things about how our brains work and

77
00:05:15.854 --> 00:05:19.570
how we have different
systems that make decisions.

78
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.650
And yeah, we're gonna get into that.

79
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.246
But the nudge book is an excellent
book that I highly recommend.

80
00:05:24.246 --> 00:05:27.981
If you get into this kind of thing a
little bit more, you wanna learn a little

81
00:05:27.981 --> 00:05:31.740
bit more about all of these areas,
then that's a really good book to read.

82
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.870
There's another one that I absolutely
love, called thinking fast,

83
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.450
thinking slow, that you guys
might wanna check out as well.
