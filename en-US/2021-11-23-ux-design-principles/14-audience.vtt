1
00:00:00.658 --> 00:00:05.530
Another part of this whole equation
is something called priming when

2
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.048
it comes to content.

3
00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:11.209
Now, a priming is about
preparing the user for

4
00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:15.265
the offering you
are presenting them with and

5
00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:18.908
it's about, it can be used in a bad way.

6
00:00:18.908 --> 00:00:23.120
So, for example,
if you've ever watched any Darren Brown,

7
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.884
who does like mind tricks, and people.

8
00:00:25.884 --> 00:00:27.365
He's a magician, right?

9
00:00:27.365 --> 00:00:30.643
He can set them up with
certain key things,

10
00:00:30.643 --> 00:00:34.844
that they see certain objects in a room or
key phrases.

11
00:00:34.844 --> 00:00:38.795
And he can influence the decision they
make in quite a manipulative way and

12
00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:42.956
that he's using priming to do that,
the fact that we're quite influenced.

13
00:00:42.956 --> 00:00:46.976
But priming can also be used
in a very positive way,

14
00:00:46.976 --> 00:00:53.334
to make the people feel comfortable in a
situation and make people feel valued and

15
00:00:53.334 --> 00:00:59.600
a product is right for them and
is in line with their way of doing things.

16
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.570
And a lot of this comes down to how you
word things and even the imagery you pick.

17
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.327
So let me give you a couple of
examples to show what I mean.

18
00:01:08.327 --> 00:01:12.460
The first example is around something
called mental models, right?

19
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.090
This is the big promo, and
I'm sure you've come across this before.

20
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.866
Where a client is designing a website or

21
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:24.333
creating a new website with you and
you're working with them.

22
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.991
And they're creating
the information architecture and

23
00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:29.987
they start using jargon and
phrases that don't make any sense.

24
00:01:29.987 --> 00:01:34.608
And you tell them that they shouldn't
put it in, and they say, but

25
00:01:34.608 --> 00:01:36.779
everybody knows those phrases.

26
00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:41.240
Well, what's happened there
is that their mental model,

27
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.971
their way of seeing and
perceiving the world has kind of left and

28
00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:51.290
is no longer in line with
the mental model of their audience.

29
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.408
And this happens for a couple of reasons.

30
00:01:53.408 --> 00:01:59.776
One is because, they're having
a unique perspective on things.

31
00:01:59.776 --> 00:02:03.196
That we all have different
ways of seeing the world and

32
00:02:03.196 --> 00:02:07.385
structuring information that's
influenced by our situation.

33
00:02:07.385 --> 00:02:11.490
So there's a very famous fable about
an elephant and you get a group of blind

34
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.087
people that are all introduced to
an elephant for the first time.

35
00:02:15.087 --> 00:02:19.989
And one of them starts off by touching
the elephant's leg and it concludes that

36
00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.156
the elephant must be a tree from
because it feels like a tree trunk.

37
00:02:24.156 --> 00:02:26.459
Another one touches the elephant tail and

38
00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.362
concludes it's a rope
because it feels like a rope.

39
00:02:29.362 --> 00:02:35.640
Another one touches the trunk and thinks
that the elephant is a snake and so on.

40
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.920
So our experiences kind of
alter how we see the world.

41
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.794
So you need to be very aware of how your
audience sees the world, how they think of

42
00:02:45.794 --> 00:02:49.929
things, how they structure things and
use appropriate language.

43
00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:54.386
But to make matters worse, there's
something called the expert dilemma,

44
00:02:54.386 --> 00:02:57.728
which is the more knowledgeable
you become in a subject,

45
00:02:57.728 --> 00:03:02.135
the more your way of seeing the world
differs from your audiences, right?

46
00:03:02.135 --> 00:03:07.830
And that's why people that, you know,
running projects are the worst people

47
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.278
to be writing the content and creating
the navigational structure for it.

48
00:03:13.278 --> 00:03:17.590
Because they're experts in the product,
and so they don't really understand it.

49
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.550
So to give you a real life
example of this, okay?

50
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.289
I'm gonna give you a phrase,
Jill is going to the bank.

51
00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:31.511
What is Jill going to do,
is my question for you.

52
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:36.561
I'm expecting to see things
like going to withdraw money or

53
00:03:36.561 --> 00:03:42.670
going to pay a bill or
someone always says to rob a bank, right?

54
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.231
But they'll almost all be something
to do with financial transactions

55
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:50.620
because that's what you think of,
isn't it?

56
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.110
Jill is going to the bank.

57
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.328
But not everybody necessarily
will have that kind of worldview.

58
00:03:58.328 --> 00:04:02.468
If you are a keen angler, or
if you like to do sailing or

59
00:04:02.468 --> 00:04:07.720
things like that, you might be
thinking of the riverbank, right?

60
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.021
Totally different perception
of the same phrase.

61
00:04:12.021 --> 00:04:15.138
So the language we use
is really important.

62
00:04:15.138 --> 00:04:17.565
If we don't use the right language,

63
00:04:17.565 --> 00:04:21.806
we're gonna find ourselves with
quite significant problems.

64
00:04:21.806 --> 00:04:26.503
And we can help make that transition
not by just using clearer language but

65
00:04:26.503 --> 00:04:29.319
also by associating appropriate imagery.

66
00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:34.236
Just by you putting this image alongside
that text, I'm making it much clearer that

67
00:04:34.236 --> 00:04:37.297
I'm referring to the river
bank in that situation.

68
00:04:37.297 --> 00:04:40.878
Course I'd make it even clearer if I
said river bank rather than bank but

69
00:04:40.878 --> 00:04:41.779
you get the idea.

70
00:04:43.862 --> 00:04:48.796
Another way that we really need
to kind of prepare people and

71
00:04:48.796 --> 00:04:51.166
communicate that this is for

72
00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:55.523
them is through the choice
of imagery we use as well.

73
00:04:55.523 --> 00:04:59.034
And I gave that example earlier when
I was talking about the fitness app.

74
00:04:59.034 --> 00:05:03.774
You don't wanna be showing images
of super fit young people if you're

75
00:05:03.774 --> 00:05:06.320
aiming at middle aged mums.

76
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.976
You need to be able to reflect back
the people that you're actually trying to

77
00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:15.488
reach in the interfaces that you're
creating in the imagery that you're

78
00:05:15.488 --> 00:05:16.590
choosing.

79
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.440
So people know that this is for them.

80
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.750
And this is where things like diversity
of imagery becomes really important.

81
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.000
Because otherwise, people conclude,
this isn't for people like me.

82
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.246
The best example I ever did
of that was some usability

83
00:05:32.246 --> 00:05:36.960
testing I was doing on
a leading UK university, right?

84
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.836
I won't say their name but
you know the top universities in the UK,

85
00:05:41.836 --> 00:05:46.780
no doubt and it is one of
the two that you're thinking of.

86
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.608
And basically they wanted to attract more
international students in particular

87
00:05:51.608 --> 00:05:52.950
from Asia.

88
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:58.396
So what they did is they asked me to run
some usability testing to find out how

89
00:05:58.396 --> 00:06:03.766
we can make the site more accessible and
more appealing to that audience.

90
00:06:03.766 --> 00:06:10.080
And I tested the homepage, knowing full
well that the audience would hate it.

91
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.214
And I showed these Asian
students the homepage and

92
00:06:14.214 --> 00:06:17.850
asked them one question, right?

93
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.976
I asked him, is this university for
people like you?

94
00:06:21.976 --> 00:06:24.647
That was just the only
question I asked and

95
00:06:24.647 --> 00:06:29.242
every single person that I surveyed
said no after seeing the homepage.

96
00:06:29.242 --> 00:06:34.306
And it was obvious why,
cuz the homepage had a carousel on it.

97
00:06:34.306 --> 00:06:37.731
And on the carousel was the latest news.

98
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:41.569
And the particular latest news
at that time was that the fact

99
00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:45.579
that the university had won some
prestigious award or other.

100
00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:50.813
And it showed a picture of
the Chancellor of the University and

101
00:06:50.813 --> 00:06:56.448
some key academics, all wearing
their finery of academic robes,

102
00:06:56.448 --> 00:06:59.882
all of which were middle aged white men.

103
00:06:59.882 --> 00:07:05.990
There was not an Asian person to be
seen in that particular circumstance.

104
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.370
And so as a result, people naturally
concluded, well, this isn't for me.

105
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.328
And I'm not just talking, this isn't
just a race issue or a gender issue.

106
00:07:14.328 --> 00:07:18.758
This is just showing people like
those you're trying to reach,

107
00:07:18.758 --> 00:07:22.050
fundamental to creating
compelling content.
