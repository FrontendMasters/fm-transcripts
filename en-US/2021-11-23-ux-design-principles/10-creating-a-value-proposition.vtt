1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
So how does this kind of then
translate into reality, right?

2
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.004
How do we take all that we've learned so
far and

3
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:11.060
start shaping that into
some kind of content?

4
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.611
The very first step is to create
something called a value proposition.

5
00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:21.035
And a value proposition is a company's
promise to deliver a specific value or

6
00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:22.713
benefit to a customer.

7
00:00:22.713 --> 00:00:29.229
And an outline of how it proposes to
fulfill that promise that they're making.

8
00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:32.811
So when you start off before
you write any copy at all,

9
00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:37.917
you got to start off by assembling what
is the promise that I'm making here?

10
00:00:37.917 --> 00:00:41.187
What is the value that I'm gonna provide?

11
00:00:41.187 --> 00:00:46.864
And how am I gonna explain how
I'm going to provide that value?

12
00:00:46.864 --> 00:00:52.726
So our value proposition typically breaks
down into three components really,

13
00:00:52.726 --> 00:00:58.425
first of all is that how does my offering
solve a particular problem, right?

14
00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:04.795
So let's say for example, I'm having a
look around trying to think of something,

15
00:01:04.795 --> 00:01:09.618
so this water bottle,
this is a water bottle that I purchased,

16
00:01:09.618 --> 00:01:12.820
and it solves a very particular problem.

17
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.327
The most water bottle don't fit into
like a laptop bag because they're

18
00:01:16.327 --> 00:01:17.328
circular, right?

19
00:01:17.328 --> 00:01:22.168
So the particular problem that this solves
is it will fit nicely into a laptop bag,

20
00:01:22.168 --> 00:01:26.252
there you go, that's the value
proposition for this water bottle.

21
00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.499
And people have different
problems that they come across.

22
00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:31.139
Now, sometimes you need to actually
point out what the problem is,

23
00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:33.750
people don't realize they've got
a problem until you tell them.

24
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.187
Other times they already
know what their problem is.

25
00:01:36.187 --> 00:01:40.720
So again, you need to know the journey and
where people are on that journey.

26
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.490
So what's the problem you're solving?

27
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.727
And then what benefit can
people expect to get, right?

28
00:01:46.727 --> 00:01:52.648
So okay, this water bottle solves the
problem but what benefit does it provide?

29
00:01:52.648 --> 00:01:56.021
Well, it provides me with more space,
right?

30
00:01:56.021 --> 00:01:58.132
More space in my laptop bag.

31
00:01:58.132 --> 00:02:01.878
And my laptop bag is less bulky,
less awkward.

32
00:02:01.878 --> 00:02:06.317
And also, obviously,
I've got water with me when I need it.

33
00:02:06.317 --> 00:02:09.769
So those are the kinds of
benefits that you're getting.

34
00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.434
So benefit is how it
improves my situation or

35
00:02:13.434 --> 00:02:17.699
my life,
how it helps me overcome those problems.

36
00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:22.669
And then the final aspect is why should
I choose this water bottle over one

37
00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:24.149
of the competitors?

38
00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:25.921
And actually in this case,

39
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:31.085
it's because the problem that it's
solving most water bottles are circular,

40
00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:35.960
and so the benefit is the reason why
you will choose it over the competitor.

41
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.330
In other cases, it might be
a completely different reason, right?

42
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.190
So for example, one of the reasons that,
[LAUGH] this is embarrassing,

43
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.733
but one of the reasons people hire
me is for my enthusiasm, right?

44
00:02:49.733 --> 00:02:53.528
So it's because I actually care about
their product and their service and

45
00:02:53.528 --> 00:02:55.004
I get really into projects.

46
00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:59.317
Although necessarily, I'm particularly
more knowledgeable than another person.

47
00:02:59.317 --> 00:03:02.774
And I once had a client say to
me how can I say no to you Paul,

48
00:03:02.774 --> 00:03:05.891
it be like kicking a puppy,
an overexcited puppy.

49
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:10.462
And that's one of the reasons people hire
me, and I kind of come to know that.

50
00:03:10.462 --> 00:03:15.470
And I need to communicate that through the
things that I do, it's part of my value

51
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.420
proposition, I guess, I've never thought
of it like that, but I guess it is.

52
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.870
So yeah, how do you go about
creating this value proposition?

53
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:23.800
How do you think about it?

54
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.566
Well, actually, if you've ever
done any kind of user research or

55
00:03:27.566 --> 00:03:30.741
you've got any experience
in user experience design.

56
00:03:30.741 --> 00:03:35.263
Then actually the kind of answers
are almost sitting there in front of you.

57
00:03:35.263 --> 00:03:39.012
And then there's this thing
called a value proposition or

58
00:03:39.012 --> 00:03:42.914
Value Proposition Canvas, and
it's just a methodology for

59
00:03:42.914 --> 00:03:47.676
that I've kind of just outlined really,
and it consists of three parts.

60
00:03:47.676 --> 00:03:49.226
What pains are you addressing?

61
00:03:49.226 --> 00:03:50.873
What gains are you creating?

62
00:03:50.873 --> 00:03:53.671
And what features are you providing,
all right?

63
00:03:53.671 --> 00:03:57.129
And in actual fact,
if you've done any news or research and

64
00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.849
if you've got half decent persona, you
kind of already know the answer to that.

65
00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.524
Cuz your persona will tell you what
pain points people are experiencing.

66
00:04:06.524 --> 00:04:10.224
It will tell you what goals that
they're trying to achieve, and

67
00:04:10.224 --> 00:04:13.936
it will tell you what kind of tasks
that you need to do it, right?

68
00:04:13.936 --> 00:04:19.780
So let's take an example,
let's take a middle aged mom, right?

69
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.532
A middle aged mom,
one of the pain points she might be

70
00:04:24.532 --> 00:04:29.296
experiencing is that she's always tired,
right?

71
00:04:29.296 --> 00:04:33.572
One of the goals that she
might have is to lose

72
00:04:33.572 --> 00:04:38.787
the weight that she gained
during pregnancy, okay?

73
00:04:38.787 --> 00:04:45.891
And so her tasks then are to
do exercise and eat healthily.

74
00:04:45.891 --> 00:04:51.154
So if we've got, say, a fitness app,
we can target it at moms

75
00:04:51.154 --> 00:04:56.234
in that way by talking about
the those pain points, right?

76
00:04:56.234 --> 00:05:02.050
And that goal and those tasks,
yet, that same fitness tracker or

77
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.620
fitness app could be able to teenage boys,
right?

78
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.105
And exactly the same functionality in
the app but how the value proposition

79
00:05:12.105 --> 00:05:17.951
would then be very different, so what
pain points do teenage boys experience?

80
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:21.520
Well, it might be that they feel skinny,
right?

81
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.086
And so they wanna get a bit buffer.

82
00:05:24.086 --> 00:05:27.842
And their goal might be to
attract a partner, right?

83
00:05:27.842 --> 00:05:29.237
They wanna be sexy.

84
00:05:29.237 --> 00:05:35.041
And so the tasks that they need to do
again are fitness, same tasks, right?

85
00:05:35.041 --> 00:05:40.688
But look at how different that would
make the way that you wrote it and

86
00:05:40.688 --> 00:05:45.261
produce content and
even how you designed it, right?

87
00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:49.815
One of the things you often see on
fitness apps, which always confuses me

88
00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:54.683
on fitness sites is that there's lots
of beautiful perfect people, right?

89
00:05:54.683 --> 00:05:57.393
Who are super jacked and
fit and all of it.

90
00:05:57.393 --> 00:06:01.745
And yeah, that's creating
an aspiration that people wanna reach,

91
00:06:01.745 --> 00:06:03.696
but that aspiration is often so

92
00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:07.611
out of reach that actually
alienates people of doing the app.

93
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:12.727
So if you were aiming at teenagers,
you would show pictures of teenage

94
00:06:12.727 --> 00:06:18.640
lads looking fairly fit and attracting
attention from their desired partners.

95
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.795
If you're aiming at middle aged mom's
you'd see healthy fit middle aged

96
00:06:23.795 --> 00:06:29.546
mom playing with their kids, you don't
suddenly show some gym fit bodybuilder.

97
00:06:29.546 --> 00:06:34.366
So this is how we can start building
up a picture of our value proposition,

98
00:06:34.366 --> 00:06:37.321
by thinking about our
audience who they are,

99
00:06:37.321 --> 00:06:40.536
what they wanna achieve,
what their goals are.

100
00:06:40.536 --> 00:06:43.987
And either even affect
not only your imagery,

101
00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:48.334
not only your content but
the tone of voice that you adopt.

102
00:06:48.334 --> 00:06:53.087
For example, in America thing
is called Axe body spray and

103
00:06:53.087 --> 00:06:56.973
that kinda thing,
in the UK it's called Lynx.

104
00:06:56.973 --> 00:07:02.204
And they know their audience so well,

105
00:07:02.204 --> 00:07:10.220
and if you read the back of one
of their shower gels, okay?

106
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.044
Normally, they talk about
things like uses aloe-vera,

107
00:07:14.044 --> 00:07:16.939
if you're looking at another a shower gel.

108
00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:22.017
But because these guys are aiming at
teenage boys, it talks about cactus

109
00:07:22.017 --> 00:07:27.025
milk and it talks about smelling great for
girls and that kind of stuff.

110
00:07:27.025 --> 00:07:30.826
They very much built it around that
audience using their language,

111
00:07:30.826 --> 00:07:33.166
their terminology in that kind of stuff.

112
00:07:33.166 --> 00:07:37.583
Now, I know all of this sounds like
kind of evil marketing talk here.

113
00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:42.922
But actually it kinda matters because it's
about making connections with people.

114
00:07:42.922 --> 00:07:48.288
It's about communicating in a way, in
a language that your audience understands.

115
00:07:48.288 --> 00:07:52.981
And we'll come on to that in
more specific detail later, and

116
00:07:52.981 --> 00:07:56.859
how a failure to do that
can be quite problematic.

117
00:07:56.859 --> 00:08:00.962
But for now, let's talk about how to
communicate your value proposition

118
00:08:00.962 --> 00:08:02.694
specifically online, okay?

119
00:08:02.694 --> 00:08:07.330
So you've got this kind of idea of
what the benefits are of your product,

120
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.841
what the features are of your product.

121
00:08:09.841 --> 00:08:12.802
You kind of know who it's saying that,

122
00:08:12.802 --> 00:08:16.853
what problem it's enabling
them to overcome, etc.

123
00:08:16.853 --> 00:08:20.744
Now, we need to turn that into something
that we can put on our website.

124
00:08:20.744 --> 00:08:25.024
And basically there are three sections
that every good landing page,

125
00:08:25.024 --> 00:08:27.210
homepage, whatever should have.

126
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:31.092
The first is your strap line,
the second is your benefits, and

127
00:08:31.092 --> 00:08:34.036
the third is how you
deliver on those benefits.

128
00:08:34.036 --> 00:08:38.952
So often that would be features of some
description features of your service,

129
00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:40.969
your product, whatever else.

130
00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:45.418
So that's what you're gonna do,
once you've got idea of what your value

131
00:08:45.418 --> 00:08:50.600
proposition, the first thing you're doing
is writing these three things, right?

132
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.956
So let's start with your strapline.

133
00:08:52.956 --> 00:08:57.864
Strapline are really hard to write,
they're probably the hardest thing to

134
00:08:57.864 --> 00:09:01.403
do and there are a lot of
rubbish straplines out there.

135
00:09:01.403 --> 00:09:06.239
Cuz what your strapline needs to do
ideally is it needs to say what the thing

136
00:09:06.239 --> 00:09:07.105
is, right?

137
00:09:07.105 --> 00:09:07.874
Is it a course?

138
00:09:07.874 --> 00:09:08.923
Is it a workshop?

139
00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:11.663
Is it a have a SaaS product?

140
00:09:11.663 --> 00:09:12.976
Is it a app?

141
00:09:12.976 --> 00:09:14.472
Whatever it is.

142
00:09:14.472 --> 00:09:19.456
And also emphasize some
kind of benefit that

143
00:09:19.456 --> 00:09:23.231
thing is gonna provide, right?

144
00:09:23.231 --> 00:09:27.922
So actually, this is a strapline
I initially produced for

145
00:09:27.922 --> 00:09:30.134
one of my courses, right?

146
00:09:30.134 --> 00:09:34.267
And the worries about
around finding new clients,

147
00:09:34.267 --> 00:09:38.595
which is great in terms of
identifying a pain point and

148
00:09:38.595 --> 00:09:43.036
a goal, but
it's really rubbish at saying what it is.

149
00:09:43.036 --> 00:09:44.860
Is it a book?

150
00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.215
Is it a course?

151
00:09:47.215 --> 00:09:48.264
Is it a live event?

152
00:09:48.264 --> 00:09:49.901
Or is it a pre-recorded thing?

153
00:09:49.901 --> 00:09:51.943
What is it?

154
00:09:51.943 --> 00:09:57.238
So actually, here was another one
that I love which was a strapline,

155
00:09:57.238 --> 00:10:00.630
well, I didn't love it, it was terrible.

156
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:05.061
The strapline of speak to your
loved ones this Valentine's, right?

157
00:10:05.061 --> 00:10:08.872
Cuz it was around the Valentine's Day.

158
00:10:08.872 --> 00:10:11.722
Now, if you didn't know,
that could have been anything,

159
00:10:11.722 --> 00:10:13.263
it could have been a dating app.

160
00:10:13.263 --> 00:10:17.511
It could have been a social media channel.

161
00:10:17.511 --> 00:10:20.581
It could have been sending
cards to loved ones.

162
00:10:20.581 --> 00:10:22.490
It could have been anything.

163
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.292
It didn't summarize what it was,
it was actually on Skype, all right?

164
00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.537
We wouldn't necessarily have
got that from the Strapline.

165
00:10:28.537 --> 00:10:33.325
So Strapline needs to be descriptive as
well as touching on the benefit that it

166
00:10:33.325 --> 00:10:34.069
provides.

167
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:38.035
So you need to brainstorm different ideas,
come up with lots of different ones.

168
00:10:38.035 --> 00:10:40.816
You don't need to get it perfect
because probably your client or

169
00:10:40.816 --> 00:10:42.832
stakeholder is gonna
interfere in it anyway.

170
00:10:42.832 --> 00:10:47.465
But you can at least teach them that
it should have these components in.

171
00:10:47.465 --> 00:10:49.213
And then also, of course,

172
00:10:49.213 --> 00:10:54.544
you can do AB testing on different ones to
see what works the best and what doesn't.

173
00:10:54.544 --> 00:10:59.291
After straplines,
then you wanna get into your benefits.

174
00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:02.692
So to start with,
just write yourself a bullet point list.

175
00:11:02.692 --> 00:11:08.024
How does this product service,
actually, help people, right?

176
00:11:08.024 --> 00:11:13.864
So this particular course, which is about
finding clients if you run an agency.

177
00:11:13.864 --> 00:11:18.335
You're less likely to run out of work,
you're gonna win the kinds of clients you

178
00:11:18.335 --> 00:11:21.183
want and
you can increase what you charge, right?

179
00:11:21.183 --> 00:11:24.219
Those are the kinds of
benefits that it provides.

180
00:11:24.219 --> 00:11:26.943
But anything has got its benefits to it,
so

181
00:11:26.943 --> 00:11:30.204
make a bullet point list
of what those are, right?

182
00:11:30.204 --> 00:11:31.948
So you've got a strapline,

183
00:11:31.948 --> 00:11:35.158
which summarizes everything
at the highest level.

184
00:11:35.158 --> 00:11:37.071
You've got a set of benefits.

185
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:40.101
And then finally if you
want your features, right?

186
00:11:40.101 --> 00:11:45.052
How are you gonna deliver on those
promises you're making with the benefits.

187
00:11:45.052 --> 00:11:49.118
So with a course,
it'd be something like a lesson plan, but

188
00:11:49.118 --> 00:11:52.947
other things it might be some
functionality of your app or

189
00:11:52.947 --> 00:11:56.570
the way that a service is delivered or
whatever else.

190
00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:00.562
So there are value propositions
that you need to create,

191
00:12:00.562 --> 00:12:05.650
which consists of your strapline,
your benefits, and your features.

192
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.753
But there are other areas that
you need to consider as well.

193
00:12:08.753 --> 00:12:12.060
For example, there are the objections
I talked about earlier.

194
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.761
So this is a more recent version of the
same call to action I showed you earlier

195
00:12:16.761 --> 00:12:18.460
for my newsletter signup.

196
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:22.597
And I list in there the benefits,
you've got a strapline,

197
00:12:22.597 --> 00:12:26.985
which is to improve your knowledge
of user experience design,

198
00:12:26.985 --> 00:12:30.490
digital, marketing, and
digital leadership.

199
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:32.560
Then I touch on who it's for

200
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.250
because that was another thing
that was missing previously.

201
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:42.090
I also give people a list of some recent
newsletters that they can check out for

202
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.008
themselves to see if
the content is relevant.

203
00:12:45.008 --> 00:12:47.775
Then there's the things
that I had previously.

204
00:12:47.775 --> 00:12:50.452
Things I can unsubscribe in one click,

205
00:12:50.452 --> 00:12:55.981
that I'm not gonna sell your email address
to anybody else or that kind of thing.

206
00:12:55.981 --> 00:13:00.673
So along side we've got a bullet point
list of benefits that we've created,

207
00:13:00.673 --> 00:13:05.091
we've got a bullet point list of features,
and we've got a strapline.

208
00:13:05.091 --> 00:13:09.619
We'll also need a bullet point list
of objections people might have and

209
00:13:09.619 --> 00:13:12.113
ideas for how you could address those.

210
00:13:12.113 --> 00:13:15.206
What could you say to
reassure people in that.

211
00:13:15.206 --> 00:13:20.011
And once you've got all of those
components together those four components,

212
00:13:20.011 --> 00:13:22.940
now you're ready to start
creating your copy.
