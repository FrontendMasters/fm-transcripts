00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:04.957
The final place where you can
do testing and optimization and

2
00:00:04.957 --> 00:00:09.688
by far the most important is
actually once you go live, right?

3
00:00:09.688 --> 00:00:14.196
Once your website is live,
that is the moment where you

4
00:00:14.196 --> 00:00:19.096
finally see real users interacting
with the real website in

5
00:00:19.096 --> 00:00:23.810
real time in a completely
natural environment, right?

6
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.698
In other words,
say they're not being watched or

7
00:00:26.698 --> 00:00:31.115
they've not got someone over their
shoulder watching everything they do.

8
00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:33.102
They're just using the website.

9
00:00:33.102 --> 00:00:36.870
And that has got the most
valuable insights appear there.

10
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.202
And seriously, you could double or

11
00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:44.830
even triple your conversion rate by
doing some post launch optimization.

12
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.791
And it's a very simple step
by step process, right?

13
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:55.630
I've written in my notes, that sitting on
the screen, hammer home this point, right?

14
00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.273
Of everything I've said today, this
little loop that I'm gonna show you now,

15
00:01:00.273 --> 00:01:04.847
is the most valuable thing that you can
do to improve the conversion rate on your

16
00:01:04.847 --> 00:01:06.520
existing site, right?

17
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.084
Don't do a big redesign cuz it'll take
forever and it will be really difficult.

18
00:01:11.084 --> 00:01:13.678
Instead go through this loop again and
again, and

19
00:01:13.678 --> 00:01:17.160
you will systematically
improve your website.

20
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.290
So this loop consists of three steps.

21
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.270
Step one, find a problem area to address.

22
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.900
So we're gonna find
an issue with the website,

23
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.994
a page that is underperforming, okay?

24
00:01:30.994 --> 00:01:33.300
I'm gonna go into these in
more detail in a minute.

25
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.449
Step number two is then
to diagnose exactly what

26
00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:40.569
the problem is on that page, okay?

27
00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:45.597
And then step number three is
to test a number of potential

28
00:01:45.597 --> 00:01:51.481
solutions to that exact problem
that we've identified, right?

29
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:53.820
So let's break that down in
a little bit more detail.

30
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.460
Number one, identify problem areas with
the page and how are we gonna do that?

31
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.510
Well, we're gonna do
it with all analytics.

32
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.626
Now, a lot of you guys watching
this are developers and

33
00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:10.960
probably are a lot more analytical
in your thinking than I am.

34
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.750
To be quite honest,
I suck analytics, right?

35
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.014
I open up something like Google Analytics
and my eyes glaze over and

36
00:02:18.014 --> 00:02:20.184
I start dribbling at
the corner of my mouth.

37
00:02:20.184 --> 00:02:22.420
It's not my natural environment.

38
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.823
But even I am able to do the basic
stuff that is required to

39
00:02:26.823 --> 00:02:30.023
identify problem pages on the website.

40
00:02:30.023 --> 00:02:33.166
Because effectively there are just
two things you're looking for.

41
00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:36.550
So you can do this immediately
after this session, right?

42
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.172
Log into Google Analytics and
look for two things.

43
00:02:40.172 --> 00:02:42.905
Thing number one is exit pages.

44
00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:46.893
Where are people leaving your website,
okay?

45
00:02:46.893 --> 00:02:49.456
Where are they most abandoning it?

46
00:02:49.456 --> 00:02:51.644
So that's the first thing
you're looking for.

47
00:02:51.644 --> 00:02:54.151
Just make a list of the top five or so

48
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:58.250
pages that people
are exiting the site from.

49
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.771
And then secondly,
look at your bounce pages.

50
00:03:00.771 --> 00:03:06.324
So these are pages where someone
is going to the page and

51
00:03:06.324 --> 00:03:09.583
then within first few seconds,

52
00:03:09.583 --> 00:03:14.062
first 20 seconds, are leaving the page.

53
00:03:14.062 --> 00:03:18.687
And actually, you wanna take off people
that are spending less than about five

54
00:03:18.687 --> 00:03:19.962
seconds on the page.

55
00:03:19.962 --> 00:03:23.700
Because those people aren't even
really looking at the page properly.

56
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.610
So in those situations, it's not
necessarily the page that's wrong but

57
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.188
they didn't mean to go click
on the link or whatever.

58
00:03:32.188 --> 00:03:36.192
But people that are staying
between say 5 and 20 seconds and

59
00:03:36.192 --> 00:03:40.822
then abandoning, that means there's
probably a problem on the page.

60
00:03:40.822 --> 00:03:43.878
So it's pages where people
are completely leaving the site and

61
00:03:43.878 --> 00:03:46.540
pages where they're not
spending very long on a page.

62
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.570
So those are the two things you
wanna look at in your analytics.

63
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.010
And that will give you a list of pages
that are potential problem pages.

64
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.048
And then you just pick the worst, right?

65
00:03:58.048 --> 00:04:01.824
You look at the one with the highest
bounce rate or the highest exits and

66
00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:02.984
you start with that.

67
00:04:02.984 --> 00:04:07.366
That's gonna be the page we're gonna
first of all improve and iterate upon.

68
00:04:07.366 --> 00:04:12.299
So once we've done that, we can then
look specifically at that page.

69
00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.932
Now, earlier I talked about
the Microsoft Clarity as a tool and

70
00:04:16.932 --> 00:04:21.227
we're gonna use that to narrow
down the problem, right?

71
00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:26.773
So what we do is we run Microsoft Clarity,
or if you've already got Hotjar,

72
00:04:26.773 --> 00:04:31.280
that will do the same on the page,
on that particular page.

73
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.313
You don't tend to have it running across
the whole site because these tools begin

74
00:04:35.313 --> 00:04:38.943
to interfere with performance if you
leave them running on everything.

75
00:04:38.943 --> 00:04:44.453
So we're just gonna use it for as long
as we need it on that particular page.

76
00:04:44.453 --> 00:04:48.043
And that's gonna produce
some session videos, right,

77
00:04:48.043 --> 00:04:50.526
of people interacting with that page.

78
00:04:50.526 --> 00:04:53.242
We're gonna see people scrolling up and
down the page.

79
00:04:53.242 --> 00:04:57.320
We're gonna see people clicking on things,
all that kind of stuff.

80
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.979
Now, if you do, you can if you want,
run it across the site more broadly.

81
00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.838
And then Microsoft Clarity will provide
you with some analytics on things like

82
00:05:06.838 --> 00:05:08.899
number of people rage clicking or

83
00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:13.410
quickly going back from a page bouncing
from a page and things like that.

84
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.955
So you can always use it as a replacement
for Google Analytics, but personally,

85
00:05:16.955 --> 00:05:18.720
I prefer Google Analytics.

86
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.901
But what you're really looking for from
Microsoft Clarity is you're looking for

87
00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:26.852
some sessions that you can play back and
watch people moving around the page.

88
00:05:26.852 --> 00:05:29.590
And it'll also give you some heat maps.

89
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.351
So I'll show you what people are scrolling
to, what they're seeing on the page,

90
00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:35.531
what they're not.

91
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:39.860
And so you can use this to kind of work
out what may be going wrong with the page.

92
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.714
So for example,

93
00:05:40.714 --> 00:05:44.742
people are scrolling past some critical
piece of content without reading it.

94
00:05:44.742 --> 00:05:47.449
Are they trying to click on
something that's not clickable?

95
00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.722
Are they missing a call
to action entirely?

96
00:05:50.722 --> 00:05:52.244
That kind of stuff.

97
00:05:52.244 --> 00:05:56.385
So after watching a few of those
videos and looking at the heat maps,

98
00:05:56.385 --> 00:06:00.176
you'll begin to have an inkling
of what might be going wrong.

99
00:06:00.176 --> 00:06:05.160
And now hopefully inspire in
you some potential solutions,

100
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.803
right, how do you might fix it.

101
00:06:07.803 --> 00:06:10.232
If you really have
watched those videos and

102
00:06:10.232 --> 00:06:13.413
you still got no clue of what's
going wrong with a page.

103
00:06:13.413 --> 00:06:18.268
Get people to do some usability
testing where you ask them to complete

104
00:06:18.268 --> 00:06:22.119
a task that involves going
through that page, right,

105
00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:25.316
in order to see where
things are going wrong.

106
00:06:25.316 --> 00:06:32.077
And ask them once they've been through the
page, did you spot this piece of content?

107
00:06:32.077 --> 00:06:35.245
Or get them to speak out loud
any problems you have and

108
00:06:35.245 --> 00:06:38.780
you'll be able to narrow down the problem.

109
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.633
Once you've narrowed down the problem,
the next stage is to come up with

110
00:06:43.633 --> 00:06:47.942
some solutions that hopefully
will fix the problem and test it.

111
00:06:47.942 --> 00:06:52.938
So there's kind of how you test your
solutions is somewhat dependent on what

112
00:06:52.938 --> 00:06:54.585
the solution involves.

113
00:06:54.585 --> 00:06:59.192
So there's basically two types
of ideas you'll come up with.

114
00:06:59.192 --> 00:07:04.153
There'll be really quick and
simple things that are things like, well,

115
00:07:04.153 --> 00:07:09.194
if we change the heading or if we rename
the button or if we change the color or

116
00:07:09.194 --> 00:07:14.110
maybe if we swap out that image,
basic stuff like that, right?

117
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:20.216
And then there'll be more complex stuff
which might mean involving some functional

118
00:07:20.216 --> 00:07:25.901
changes, like we are gonna remove capture
from the form or that kind of thing.

119
00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:28.054
For the really simple stuff,

120
00:07:28.054 --> 00:07:33.000
the best solution you can use
is you can run A/B testing.

121
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.659
Now, if you've never run A/B
testing before, it really,

122
00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:39.186
really is incredibly straight forward.

123
00:07:39.186 --> 00:07:43.453
Chances are you've already got it set
up on your website and just don't know.

124
00:07:43.453 --> 00:07:47.052
Because if you've got Google Analytics,
you're already set up with,

125
00:07:47.052 --> 00:07:48.943
they used to call it Google Optimize.

126
00:07:48.943 --> 00:07:51.300
But I think it's now got a new fancy name.

127
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.498
But if you search Google Optimize,
you'll come up with it.

128
00:07:54.498 --> 00:08:00.066
And basically, it's really, really simple
if you've never done A/B testing before,

129
00:08:00.066 --> 00:08:04.838
based on the majority of your traffic
will still go to your original version.

130
00:08:04.838 --> 00:08:09.105
Say the page with your
original headline or whatever.

131
00:08:09.105 --> 00:08:13.414
And then you'd have various
variations where you may be changing

132
00:08:13.414 --> 00:08:16.007
your page in slightly different ways.

133
00:08:16.007 --> 00:08:19.437
You might change the heading, you might
have different headings that you test,

134
00:08:19.437 --> 00:08:20.350
that kind of stuff.

135
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.818
I'm sure you're familiar with A/B testing.

136
00:08:22.818 --> 00:08:26.220
One area that does cause confusion is
the difference between AB testing and

137
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.465
multi-variant testing.

138
00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:30.125
A lot of people get that really confused.

139
00:08:30.125 --> 00:08:33.889
Because everybody thinks that
multi-variant testing is when you test

140
00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:35.023
multiple versions.

141
00:08:35.023 --> 00:08:38.458
So this screen here we've
got three variations,

142
00:08:38.458 --> 00:08:42.811
people think that's multi-variant but
it's actually not.

143
00:08:42.811 --> 00:08:48.135
Multi-variant testing is where
you're testing multiple variations.

144
00:08:48.135 --> 00:08:52.040
So you're changing multiple
things across the page.

145
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.792
So A/B testing, you could have
you're making a single change.

146
00:08:56.792 --> 00:09:00.201
You might be changing the headline
in five different ways,

147
00:09:00.201 --> 00:09:02.256
trying five different headlines.

148
00:09:02.256 --> 00:09:06.293
Multi-variant testing is where you're
changing the headline and the bottom.

149
00:09:06.293 --> 00:09:08.360
You're changing more than one
thing on a page at a time.

150
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.678
And you can do all of this really
simply just through a WYSIWYG editor,

151
00:09:14.678 --> 00:09:16.784
it can't be much easier to do.

152
00:09:16.784 --> 00:09:20.472
You just go in, you edit whatever it is
you wanna edit with a different version,

153
00:09:20.472 --> 00:09:22.409
maybe a different headline or whatever.

154
00:09:22.409 --> 00:09:27.346
Save it,
that becomes a variation job done.

155
00:09:27.346 --> 00:09:31.560
If you've got a big website with
a lot of traffic going to it,

156
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.967
A/B testing is an absolute must.

157
00:09:33.967 --> 00:09:38.094
And as you wanna explore as many
different versions as possible.

158
00:09:38.094 --> 00:09:43.296
So don't just say you wanna change
your headline, don't just do one

159
00:09:43.296 --> 00:09:48.603
old version of that alternative
version of the headline, do 5 or 6.

160
00:09:48.603 --> 00:09:53.480
The reason being is the more versions you
do, the more chances are you're gonna hit

161
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.044
on one that creates a really
big jump in conversion, right?

162
00:09:57.044 --> 00:09:59.678
Which is obviously what we want.

163
00:09:59.678 --> 00:10:05.487
The problem is that a lot of people
don't have high traffic websites,

164
00:10:05.487 --> 00:10:08.810
have quite low traffic websites.

165
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.832
And so they go, well,
I can't do A/B testing then, right?

166
00:10:12.832 --> 00:10:16.489
Cuz you have to be Amazon or
booking.com or someone like that,

167
00:10:16.489 --> 00:10:18.081
to do that kind of testing.

168
00:10:18.081 --> 00:10:24.770
And that isn't strictly true, you just
need a slightly different approach to it.

169
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:29.204
So one option for
a start is you don't do lots of variations

170
00:10:29.204 --> 00:10:33.108
because every variation
has to drive people to it.

171
00:10:33.108 --> 00:10:37.877
And that means that obviously fewer
of people are going to any particular

172
00:10:37.877 --> 00:10:39.260
version.

173
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.470
And that means it takes
longer to declare a winner.

174
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:46.036
So you wanna test maybe just one
alternative if you've got a low traffic

175
00:10:46.036 --> 00:10:46.580
website.

176
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:53.336
Also the problem that you can have
is often there's a big gap between,

177
00:10:53.336 --> 00:10:59.056
this is really hard to explain, one day
I'll workout how to explain it well.

178
00:10:59.056 --> 00:11:02.916
You'll have a big gap between
the point you're testing and

179
00:11:02.916 --> 00:11:04.622
the point of conversion.

180
00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:10.361
So let's say for example you wanted

181
00:11:10.361 --> 00:11:16.485
to test variations of a product name.

182
00:11:16.485 --> 00:11:21.579
And whether changing the product name
is gonna lead to more sales, right?

183
00:11:21.579 --> 00:11:26.457
Now, if you have got a low
converting site, then so

184
00:11:26.457 --> 00:11:29.520
they're on the product page and

185
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.409
they see an alternate
version of the product name.

186
00:11:34.409 --> 00:11:36.344
Now, there's quite a long time,

187
00:11:36.344 --> 00:11:39.358
lots of pages where they
could potentially drop out.

188
00:11:39.358 --> 00:11:42.352
So they might add it to their basket but
then drop out the basket.

189
00:11:42.352 --> 00:11:45.216
They might go from the basket
to the checkout but

190
00:11:45.216 --> 00:11:47.589
not enter their address information.

191
00:11:47.589 --> 00:11:52.761
They might dropout at the credit card
conversion or any other number of points.

192
00:11:52.761 --> 00:11:57.545
And so as a result,
you need a lot of traffic to be able to

193
00:11:57.545 --> 00:12:02.537
confirm that from enough people
to get to the final step to

194
00:12:02.537 --> 00:12:07.132
know whether the new product
name is working or not.

195
00:12:07.132 --> 00:12:11.011
So the way that you can get around
this problem is by shortening

196
00:12:11.011 --> 00:12:15.571
the distance between the point of
conversion and the page being tested.

197
00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:18.567
So instead of testing whether people,

198
00:12:18.567 --> 00:12:23.756
if you change the product name,
do they get all the way to check out.

199
00:12:23.756 --> 00:12:27.845
Where they've actually bought it, you can
test with did they add it to their basket.

200
00:12:27.845 --> 00:12:29.985
And that can be your
conversion point instead.

201
00:12:29.985 --> 00:12:33.210
So it's much closer between the two.

202
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:34.725
So how do you go about dealing with that?

203
00:12:34.725 --> 00:12:36.905
Well, that's one is to close the gap.

204
00:12:36.905 --> 00:12:39.150
The other issue just wait, right?

205
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:43.489
So you wait till you've had enough
traffic that goes to the site and

206
00:12:43.489 --> 00:12:46.442
eventually, Google will declare a winner.

207
00:12:46.442 --> 00:12:49.690
And you just have to wait longer,
but who's got time for that?

208
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:51.765
Second is you reduce the thresholds.

209
00:12:51.765 --> 00:12:56.879
So, in other words, you close, what you do
is you go, well, okay, Google is saying

210
00:12:56.879 --> 00:13:01.589
it can't declare a statistical winner yet
of which of the different options.

211
00:13:01.589 --> 00:13:04.943
But I can see from looking at
it that that one's doing better.

212
00:13:04.943 --> 00:13:09.100
And so I'm gonna declare a winner myself
rather than waiting for the stats.

213
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.636
And then the third one is this
idea of closing the gap to make

214
00:13:13.636 --> 00:13:15.868
the testing more reliable.

215
00:13:15.868 --> 00:13:20.591
Most of the time, to be honest on low
testing websites, all just go in and go,

216
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:23.445
well, look, that one's doing pretty well.

217
00:13:23.445 --> 00:13:25.856
I'm pretty confident
that that's the winner,

218
00:13:25.856 --> 00:13:28.930
even if Google doesn't
declare it the winner.

219
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.057
That's normally good enough for me.

220
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.100
So the, sorry,
I shouldn't quite move on to that.

221
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.637
So that's great for
testing small little stuff like that.

222
00:13:40.637 --> 00:13:44.718
If you're trying to test bigger stuff,
so maybe you're making changes to

223
00:13:44.718 --> 00:13:49.318
the checkout process as a whole or adding
new functionality or something like that,

224
00:13:49.318 --> 00:13:52.270
then normally that's where
you wanna do prototype.

225
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:56.490
You wanna mock it up as a clickable
prototype in something like Figma or

226
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.859
something like that.

227
00:13:57.859 --> 00:14:00.820
It's relatively quick and
easy compared to coding it.

228
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:05.679
And then you just wanna run some
basic usability testing on that and

229
00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:07.513
see how people respond.

230
00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:11.136
Because that you're not gonna
be able to do with A/B testing.

231
00:14:11.136 --> 00:14:16.400
And so between those two types of testing,
you can really begin to solve a problem.

232
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.202
And then when you solve one problem,

233
00:14:18.202 --> 00:14:21.002
you found a solution that gets
a higher conversion rate.

234
00:14:21.002 --> 00:14:24.650
You tick it off, you go back to your
list of poor performing pages and

235
00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:25.868
you pick the next one.

236
00:14:25.868 --> 00:14:29.440
And then you rinse and repeat
the process again and again and again.

237
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.986
And that's how you improve
conversion on your website.

238
00:14:31.986 --> 00:14:36.426
And you'll see bigger conversion rate by
doing that than anything else that you

239
00:14:36.426 --> 00:14:37.030
could do.
