1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.572
So this is where things become
complicated to say the least

2
00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:11.080
because this is where all that
subjectivity comes in, okay?

3
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.782
So we all have different mental models,
we all have different ways of

4
00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:20.580
seeing the world and that very much
affects how we respond to a design.

5
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.985
So interestingly, in one of the breaks,

6
00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:29.450
we were chatting about the stripe
homepage that I showed earlier.

7
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.023
And one of the guys here said, it reminds
me of one of those domain holding pages.

8
00:00:35.023 --> 00:00:39.046
And so as a result, he didn't
really like the design very much.

9
00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:43.931
And that's the kind of thing you're
dealing with when you're trying

10
00:00:43.931 --> 00:00:47.841
to get the aesthetics,
the visuals right on a website.

11
00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:50.606
That in his particular situation,

12
00:00:50.606 --> 00:00:55.776
it reminded him of something else and
so he disliked it as a result.

13
00:00:55.776 --> 00:01:02.530
But that may have been unique to him,
it may or may not be so very confusing.

14
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.237
Like I said, it's not like the simple and
the cleanness and

15
00:01:07.237 --> 00:01:12.245
the binariness of coding where
it either works or it doesn't.

16
00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:16.068
When it comes to design,
it gets complicated.

17
00:01:16.068 --> 00:01:21.090
So let's look at why aesthetics
are important, how we can deal

18
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.891
with them in a way that doesn't lead
to endless debates and iterations?

19
00:01:26.891 --> 00:01:31.215
There is a line of thinking,
that says in actual fact,

20
00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:36.397
aesthetics don't matter that much
when it comes to conversion.

21
00:01:36.397 --> 00:01:41.410
And people hold up sites like
Craigslist which looks hideous or

22
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.013
even Amazon which looks pretty bad, right?

23
00:01:45.013 --> 00:01:50.851
As examples that a site can be highly
successful without good aesthetics.

24
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:53.253
And to some degree, this is true.

25
00:01:53.253 --> 00:02:00.126
Aesthetics supplement rather than replace
other forms of design, the information or

26
00:02:00.126 --> 00:02:05.311
design, the usability and
the structure and that kind of stuff.

27
00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:09.550
So if you aren't somebody
who's a full time designer,

28
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.078
then that should be quite
encouraging to you.

29
00:02:13.078 --> 00:02:18.305
That it doesn't need to look
beautiful to convert well, right?

30
00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:21.564
It just needs to be easy to use.

31
00:02:21.564 --> 00:02:27.687
That said, I think that aesthetics have
more value than we may be first appreciate

32
00:02:27.687 --> 00:02:32.765
but you have to dive into psychology
a little bit to understand why.

33
00:02:32.765 --> 00:02:38.097
I don't know whether you're familiar
with this idea of the halo effect.

34
00:02:38.097 --> 00:02:41.524
And Steve Jobs famously
kinda represented this.

35
00:02:41.524 --> 00:02:46.505
I'm sure you've heard of the Steve Jobs'
reality distortion field.

36
00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:50.588
That when Steve Jobs was
around talking about an idea,

37
00:02:50.588 --> 00:02:56.103
it suddenly is all seemed to make sense
and it all seemed to be a great idea.

38
00:02:56.103 --> 00:03:01.834
And when he left the room, suddenly, you
realized it wasn't such a great idea and

39
00:03:01.834 --> 00:03:05.260
actually it's gonna be
really difficult to do.

40
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.095
That is an example of the halo effect, and

41
00:03:09.095 --> 00:03:14.027
the halo effect is effectively
when we as human beings

42
00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:18.752
associate to unrelated
factors with one another.

43
00:03:18.752 --> 00:03:25.842
So the typical example was the charisma
of Steve Jobs carried you along and

44
00:03:25.842 --> 00:03:30.310
convinced you that the idea was good,
right?

45
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.339
A more extreme example
of it is that in tests,

46
00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:38.544
it's found that attractive people
are considered a much more trustworthy.

47
00:03:38.544 --> 00:03:42.373
So you're more likely to trust
an attractive person than

48
00:03:42.373 --> 00:03:44.135
a non attractive person.

49
00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:47.258
Which is why you trust every
word from my mouth now.

50
00:03:47.258 --> 00:03:49.706
But that's ridiculous
if you think about it,

51
00:03:49.706 --> 00:03:53.494
because there should be no correlation
between those two whatsoever.

52
00:03:53.494 --> 00:03:58.789
You can be incredibly attractive and
a mass murder, yet, there is something

53
00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:03.447
in our psychology that means we do
associate these kinds of things.

54
00:04:03.447 --> 00:04:07.875
And, of course, the result of that
is we associate, for example,

55
00:04:07.875 --> 00:04:12.788
the attractiveness of a website with
the quality of the product behind it.

56
00:04:12.788 --> 00:04:18.206
If the website looks unprofessional,
if it looks dated or whatever else,

57
00:04:18.206 --> 00:04:23.366
then we might conclude that the product
isn't very loved or cared for.

58
00:04:23.366 --> 00:04:27.988
So the halo effect is an important
effect and does have a knock on value.

59
00:04:27.988 --> 00:04:32.890
And you can see this in a very tangible
and very real way, the power of

60
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.235
aesthetics to actually influence our
buying decisions and our actions.

61
00:04:38.235 --> 00:04:41.140
And you can see it in slot machines,
right?

62
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.464
If you go somewhere like Vegas or
something like that,

63
00:04:44.464 --> 00:04:46.500
you see all these slot machines.

64
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.545
Let's look at it from
a developer point of view.

65
00:04:49.545 --> 00:04:51.317
What is a slot machine?

66
00:04:51.317 --> 00:04:56.102
Well, essentially, a slot machine is
a random number generator, isn't it?

67
00:04:56.102 --> 00:05:00.356
That basically is churning out
a load of random numbers that

68
00:05:00.356 --> 00:05:03.512
ascertain whether you win or lose, right?

69
00:05:03.512 --> 00:05:08.326
So if you had a user experience designer
or a UI designer who just cared

70
00:05:08.326 --> 00:05:12.563
about communicating clearly
in the simplest way possible.

71
00:05:12.563 --> 00:05:17.623
Basically, you'd press a button and
it would either say you've won or

72
00:05:17.623 --> 00:05:20.505
you've lost and that'd be it, right?

73
00:05:20.505 --> 00:05:24.113
In fact, it could be even more
seamless an experience and

74
00:05:24.113 --> 00:05:25.923
that you could walk up to it.

75
00:05:25.923 --> 00:05:30.671
And there could be a sensor on it
that detects you walking up and

76
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:33.515
just says, you lose or you win on it.

77
00:05:33.515 --> 00:05:37.266
But that wouldn't make
a great experience with it.

78
00:05:37.266 --> 00:05:42.052
And the whole reason that slot
machines are so addictive and so

79
00:05:42.052 --> 00:05:46.471
enjoyable for
some people is because of the aesthetics,

80
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:50.166
is because of the experience
has been created.

81
00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:53.434
But the sense of control and
engagement and

82
00:05:53.434 --> 00:05:57.714
all of those kinds of factors,
so esthetics do matter.

83
00:05:57.714 --> 00:06:00.137
So then, if we know they matter,

84
00:06:00.137 --> 00:06:06.034
how do we ensure that the aesthetics are
right in order to encourage conversion?

85
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.723
Well, I have a very particular process,
I adopt to get this right.

86
00:06:12.723 --> 00:06:17.360
I don't think I'm a natural
creative designer in may be

87
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.836
the way that some people are.

88
00:06:19.836 --> 00:06:26.117
And so I've kind of reduced it down to
a process that I can kind of follow.

89
00:06:26.117 --> 00:06:31.798
And the first part of my process is
I sit down with my stakeholders and

90
00:06:31.798 --> 00:06:36.193
sometimes with the users as well and
we brainstorm.

91
00:06:36.193 --> 00:06:41.104
Well, what are the words that
we need people to feel in order

92
00:06:41.104 --> 00:06:43.965
to encourage them to act, right?

93
00:06:43.965 --> 00:06:46.744
Do they need to feel
that you're trustworthy?

94
00:06:46.744 --> 00:06:49.139
Do they need to feel friendly towards you?

95
00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:50.952
Do they need to feel positive?

96
00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:53.068
What do they need to feel, or

97
00:06:53.068 --> 00:06:58.279
what do you want them to think about
your brand is another way to put it.

98
00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:03.861
And we ascertain a few words that we all
agree on, that are words that we think or

99
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:07.752
our users think will resonate
most with the audience,

100
00:07:07.752 --> 00:07:10.810
in order to encourage them to take action.

101
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.982
And then I start designing around those
words exploring different colors,

102
00:07:16.982 --> 00:07:22.297
and typography, and
imagery that I feel represent those words.

103
00:07:22.297 --> 00:07:30.079
And you could do some really cool stuff
with just a little bit of thought, really.

104
00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:31.558
So let's take this example.

105
00:07:31.558 --> 00:07:34.500
This is an example from the smashing
magazine, a membership site.

106
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.266
I don't know whether you're aware of it or
not.

107
00:07:37.266 --> 00:07:41.939
But everything in this is designed
to put you in a good mood,

108
00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:44.096
to make you feel positive.

109
00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:49.415
From the vibrant colors being used
to the smiling cat illustrations,

110
00:07:49.415 --> 00:07:54.747
the fact that all the shapes on
the illustration, curved and gentle.

111
00:07:54.747 --> 00:08:00.995
That the whole feel of it even down to the
text and the way that the text is worded,

112
00:08:00.995 --> 00:08:06.985
and then the little delight or animations
where you roll over them, right?

113
00:08:06.985 --> 00:08:12.503
Everything in that design is to make
you feel positive and why do we care?

114
00:08:12.503 --> 00:08:17.692
Because the more positive we feel,
the lower our cognitive load is,

115
00:08:17.692 --> 00:08:22.344
the more trusting we are,
the more positive we're gonna view

116
00:08:22.344 --> 00:08:26.296
the website because of the halo effect,
et cetera.

117
00:08:26.296 --> 00:08:31.695
So that's a great little bit of using
styling and shapes and animation and

118
00:08:31.695 --> 00:08:37.370
imagery and copy and all those things
together to create a great impression.

119
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:42.088
And one of the things that I
like in particular about this is

120
00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:45.765
the little animations or rollover, right?

121
00:08:45.765 --> 00:08:49.978
So they're really subtle but
they make you go and actually,

122
00:08:49.978 --> 00:08:53.043
those kinds of own moments so that's nice.

123
00:08:53.043 --> 00:08:58.188
I'll call design delighted and
they're a really good way of putting

124
00:08:58.188 --> 00:09:02.723
people in a positive mindset
about your brand or direction.

125
00:09:02.723 --> 00:09:07.641
And these do take a little bit of
thought and a little bit of fun but

126
00:09:07.641 --> 00:09:10.111
they're all worth exploring.

127
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:15.990
So humor is quite a good way of making
a connection from one person to another,

128
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.793
building trust and putting people
in a positive state of mind.

129
00:09:20.793 --> 00:09:23.563
So for example,
MailChimp used to be a master at this.

130
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:26.461
Unfortunately, they've taken
it all the way and gone for

131
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:28.956
something a bit more soulless,
which is a shame.

132
00:09:28.956 --> 00:09:33.670
But when you want to send an email,
when you are gonna send an email to

133
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:38.648
all your subscribers, you would have
this hand hanging over a button.

134
00:09:38.648 --> 00:09:42.315
And if you didn't press
the send button after a while,

135
00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:44.477
the hand would start sweating.

136
00:09:44.477 --> 00:09:47.380
And if you still didn't press the button,

137
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:52.710
it will start shaking a little bit and
seeming quite nervous about it, right?

138
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.551
And that was a great
little bit of delight us.

139
00:09:56.551 --> 00:10:01.059
And it worked so well because not
only was it a kind of moment,

140
00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:05.909
it was a hidden little feature that
you kind of stumbled across me and

141
00:10:05.909 --> 00:10:08.305
made you go, that's nice.

142
00:10:08.305 --> 00:10:12.128
But also it showed a degree of
empathy with the audience that, yes,

143
00:10:12.128 --> 00:10:16.168
sending an email out to a big mailing
list is a little bit scary, right?

144
00:10:16.168 --> 00:10:19.909
So build a great relationship there,
which is good.

145
00:10:19.909 --> 00:10:23.668
And then the other example
they did is when you sent it,

146
00:10:23.668 --> 00:10:26.376
it went to give you a high five, right?

147
00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:30.428
And if you repeatedly clicked
on the hand with your cursor,

148
00:10:30.428 --> 00:10:35.709
the hand will get redder and redder,
like you've constantly high fived it.

149
00:10:35.709 --> 00:10:40.622
Nobody's gonna find that out or
it will take people a long time to find

150
00:10:40.622 --> 00:10:44.022
that out but
then that kinda thing gets shared.

151
00:10:44.022 --> 00:10:47.811
And those kinds of things become
design delight as they're called.

152
00:10:47.811 --> 00:10:52.294
Things like the Toblerone logo, go and
have a look at the Toblerone logo.

153
00:10:52.294 --> 00:10:56.011
And if you look very carefully,
if you look on Google images,

154
00:10:56.011 --> 00:10:57.667
they highlight it for you.

155
00:10:57.667 --> 00:11:00.614
You'll find a hidden bear in that or

156
00:11:00.614 --> 00:11:04.553
the FedEx logo that's got
a hidden arrow in it.

157
00:11:04.553 --> 00:11:07.141
Or there are loads of examples and

158
00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:11.857
these little things that kind
of give a positive attitude and

159
00:11:11.857 --> 00:11:16.679
reduce people's cognitive load
makes them more receptive.

160
00:11:16.679 --> 00:11:21.865
Now you might be thinking, yeah,
but I work at a boring company and

161
00:11:21.865 --> 00:11:26.627
they won't do humor and
it's not appropriate in our situation.

162
00:11:26.627 --> 00:11:32.518
And my response to that is if
the CIA can use humor, you guys can.

163
00:11:32.518 --> 00:11:38.073
The first ever tweet from the CIA was we
can neither confirm nor deny that this is

164
00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:43.312
our first tweet and I think that's
just brilliant, that's brilliant.

165
00:11:43.312 --> 00:11:48.719
Because they brought some humanity to
a faceless government bureaucracy and

166
00:11:48.719 --> 00:11:51.887
whatever you think of
the CIA is irrelevant.

167
00:11:51.887 --> 00:11:57.720
That idea that anybody can introduce some
humor and seem humanity to their brand,

168
00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:02.723
their visuals, their copy,
whatever it be makes such a difference.

169
00:12:02.723 --> 00:12:05.476
That said, it's not always appropriate.

170
00:12:05.476 --> 00:12:10.062
There are times and
places where you shouldn't be using it.

171
00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:14.812
Here's one example,
I don't know whether you're aware of MOO.

172
00:12:14.812 --> 00:12:19.235
There's a website called
moo.com which basically does

173
00:12:19.235 --> 00:12:24.127
your printed business cards and
stickers and stuff like that.

174
00:12:24.127 --> 00:12:26.292
And I received a sticker,

175
00:12:26.292 --> 00:12:31.223
I ordered a sticker book from MOO and
I received this email.

176
00:12:31.223 --> 00:12:34.748
Now I should say that
they use personality and

177
00:12:34.748 --> 00:12:38.192
humor quite a lot on their communications.

178
00:12:38.192 --> 00:12:41.681
So for example, they have big Moo
which is their printing press,

179
00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:43.783
that's kind of the given a character.

180
00:12:43.783 --> 00:12:47.069
And then they have their software
which is called little MOO and

181
00:12:47.069 --> 00:12:50.670
little MOO looks off to you and
is your kind of interaction with them.

182
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:54.595
So you kind of interact with these
characters which is kind of cute and

183
00:12:54.595 --> 00:12:59.129
differentiate some a little bit from your
average print company which is really

184
00:12:59.129 --> 00:12:59.682
boring.

185
00:12:59.682 --> 00:13:02.174
But I received this email from little MOO.

186
00:13:02.174 --> 00:13:04.454
So hi, I'm little MOO,
we've spoken before.

187
00:13:04.454 --> 00:13:07.488
I'm a piece of software that
manages your order with MOO.

188
00:13:07.488 --> 00:13:08.977
I've done a very bad thing.

189
00:13:08.977 --> 00:13:11.410
Don't worry, your sticker book is fine but

190
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:15.553
I might have lost the information that
tells the real life people at MOO what

191
00:13:15.553 --> 00:13:18.210
color cover you ordered for
your sticker book.

192
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.704
I might only be a piece of software but
I'm embarrassed and

193
00:13:21.704 --> 00:13:23.569
I do feel like a bit of an idiot.

194
00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:27.785
If you get the wrong cover for your book,
please accept my apologies and know that

195
00:13:27.785 --> 00:13:31.760
someone has fiddled with my insights
to fix them and it won't happen again.

196
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.496
In the meantime,
I hope you love your stickers.

197
00:13:35.496 --> 00:13:40.420
The stickers you have ordered, very
best wishes and sorry again, little MOO.

198
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.809
Now, that's a bad example
of when to use humor.

199
00:13:43.809 --> 00:13:45.378
When things go wrong,

200
00:13:45.378 --> 00:13:50.343
that is not the best moment to use
humor because people are frustrated.

201
00:13:50.343 --> 00:13:54.966
It was made a lot worse by the fact that
they didn't follow my advice from earlier,

202
00:13:54.966 --> 00:13:58.734
which was keep the user informed,
and deal with their questions.

203
00:13:58.734 --> 00:14:02.712
This doesn't tell me, if I get the wrong
sticker book, can I get a refund?

204
00:14:02.712 --> 00:14:07.602
How can I tell you what the right
sticker book cover was, et cetera.

205
00:14:07.602 --> 00:14:10.633
So it very much failed and
I think oftentimes,

206
00:14:10.633 --> 00:14:13.444
I see people using humor
at the wrong time.

207
00:14:13.444 --> 00:14:18.171
The classic example and I blame
designers and developers for this is,

208
00:14:18.171 --> 00:14:19.863
is error pages, right?

209
00:14:19.863 --> 00:14:24.114
Why everybody feels the need to
make star wars puns on error

210
00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:26.037
pages is quite beyond me.

211
00:14:26.037 --> 00:14:30.982
Because that is the very moment that
people are frustrated that they can't

212
00:14:30.982 --> 00:14:35.073
find the page they're looking for
and you're making jokes.

213
00:14:35.073 --> 00:14:39.177
So you need to use some sensitivity
when it comes to this stuff but

214
00:14:39.177 --> 00:14:42.901
remember I said about getting
a list of keywords, right?

215
00:14:42.901 --> 00:14:45.697
So we're gonna take that
list of keywords and

216
00:14:45.697 --> 00:14:48.426
we're gonna do some design work around it.

217
00:14:48.426 --> 00:14:51.862
And we're gonna work out our colors and
our typography and

218
00:14:51.862 --> 00:14:53.484
apply that to our designs.

219
00:14:53.484 --> 00:14:56.778
How do you avoid those endless iterations?

220
00:14:56.778 --> 00:15:01.673
How do that the the design you've come
up with actually does communicate those

221
00:15:01.673 --> 00:15:02.422
keywords?

222
00:15:02.422 --> 00:15:05.005
Well, it's very simple, you ask users.

223
00:15:05.005 --> 00:15:08.544
You do a very basic survey
with a very fancy name.

224
00:15:08.544 --> 00:15:12.022
It's called the semantic
differential survey.

225
00:15:12.022 --> 00:15:16.711
And you can use any survey tool you
want that can display an image and

226
00:15:16.711 --> 00:15:20.755
ask a question, and
you can use any people that you want.

227
00:15:20.755 --> 00:15:24.856
Typically, I use existing
customers of the company or

228
00:15:24.856 --> 00:15:29.415
I post out on their social media channel,
places like that.

229
00:15:29.415 --> 00:15:33.240
And I show them the design and
I asked them a question,

230
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.559
very simple question on
a scale of one to five.

231
00:15:36.559 --> 00:15:41.009
How strongly do you agree with
the statement this design is dot, dot dot?

232
00:15:41.009 --> 00:15:44.464
Whether that be trustworthy,
friendly, positive,

233
00:15:44.464 --> 00:15:48.078
whatever words you come up with and
then see how it ranks.

234
00:15:48.078 --> 00:15:53.107
And if it ranks well, then really your
client or stakeholder, the fact that

235
00:15:53.107 --> 00:15:58.056
they think it looks like a domain holding
page or they don't like the blue or

236
00:15:58.056 --> 00:16:02.165
they want the font moved or
whatever all becomes irrelevant.

237
00:16:02.165 --> 00:16:04.554
Because you prove that the design works.

238
00:16:04.554 --> 00:16:09.569
You've proved that it creates the response
that you're wanting from users.

239
00:16:09.569 --> 00:16:13.927
And you can run a survey like
that in half an hour, 40 minutes,

240
00:16:13.927 --> 00:16:18.547
doesn't take very long to get a load
of people to look at it and vote.

241
00:16:18.547 --> 00:16:23.375
Another option you can have is which I
sometimes use is compare your design mock

242
00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:25.362
up alongside the competitors.

243
00:16:25.362 --> 00:16:29.161
And ask people to select the one
that they find most friendly or

244
00:16:29.161 --> 00:16:33.779
most approachable or most trustworthy or
whatever keywords you've got.

245
00:16:33.779 --> 00:16:37.817
And see whether they pick your
design over the competitors.

246
00:16:37.817 --> 00:16:41.381
If they do,
then you know you're in a good place.

247
00:16:41.381 --> 00:16:45.334
So actually, you can test for
aesthetics, you can test for

248
00:16:45.334 --> 00:16:49.938
design in order to ascertain whether or
not it's working properly.

249
00:16:49.938 --> 00:16:53.452
And there are loads of other
ways of testing a design.

250
00:16:53.452 --> 00:16:57.040
For example, there's something
called a first click test,

251
00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.635
which will help ascertain whether
your navigation is right.

252
00:17:00.635 --> 00:17:05.491
So you ask people, where would you click
to go to find x piece of information,

253
00:17:05.491 --> 00:17:09.923
and they click on the graphic and
that where they clicked is recorded.

254
00:17:09.923 --> 00:17:14.348
If people get that first click right,
there is an enormously high chance

255
00:17:14.348 --> 00:17:17.840
that they will then go on to
complete the task correctly.

256
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:22.601
Another test that you might want to find
out a little bit more about is called

257
00:17:22.601 --> 00:17:27.001
a five second test where you show
somebody a design for a few seconds.

258
00:17:27.001 --> 00:17:30.954
You take the design away and
ask them to recall what they saw.

259
00:17:30.954 --> 00:17:33.370
Did they spot the critical
calls to action?

260
00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:34.755
Did they see the main content?

261
00:17:34.755 --> 00:17:37.667
Did they understand what
the website is about?

262
00:17:37.667 --> 00:17:41.730
That can all help to ascertain
whether the design is right or not.

263
00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:46.650
Now you can run all three of those tests
to survey the first click test and

264
00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:50.428
the second test using a tool
like usability hub.com.

265
00:17:50.428 --> 00:17:52.573
And they've got free account so

266
00:17:52.573 --> 00:17:57.030
you can you do the occasional test
like that very easily with them.

267
00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:01.627
And it proves to stakeholders that
you're in the right direction.

268
00:18:01.627 --> 00:18:04.488
I've shown a lot of eye
simulation over there,

269
00:18:04.488 --> 00:18:07.714
some of eye tracking tests
to show where people look.

270
00:18:07.714 --> 00:18:09.375
You can do that as well.

271
00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:13.701
There are tools out there that no
run a full blown eye tracking study,

272
00:18:13.701 --> 00:18:18.190
which obviously takes a lot of special
equipment and all the rest of it.

273
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:22.376
But actually takes thousands of
hours of existing eye tracking, and

274
00:18:22.376 --> 00:18:26.637
actually simulates that in a piece
of software that will predict where

275
00:18:26.637 --> 00:18:29.539
people would look in
a real eye tracking study.

276
00:18:29.539 --> 00:18:34.780
With about an 80 to 95% accuracy so it's
not perfect but it's better than nothing.

277
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.213
And again,
you can run your design through it and

278
00:18:38.213 --> 00:18:41.995
see are people looking at
the right place on the page?

279
00:18:41.995 --> 00:18:46.199
So attention insights is one that I
use quite a lot for that, and again,

280
00:18:46.199 --> 00:18:48.805
they've got a free
account you can try out.

281
00:18:48.805 --> 00:18:52.529
So design doesn't need to be
this kind of creative mystery.

282
00:18:52.529 --> 00:18:55.004
In fact, design is very understandable.

283
00:18:55.004 --> 00:18:58.522
It's about following a set of rules and
testing so

284
00:18:58.522 --> 00:19:02.962
that you've got real data so
stakeholders get off your back and

285
00:19:02.962 --> 00:19:07.515
stop hassling you about the fact
that they don't like the pink.

286
00:19:07.515 --> 00:19:09.756
So there's a little bit about design.

287
00:19:09.756 --> 00:19:13.982
Let's recap very quickly the key
takeaways before we take final break and

288
00:19:13.982 --> 00:19:16.104
go into the final session for today.

289
00:19:16.104 --> 00:19:19.529
Those key takeaways is
simplify mercilessly.

290
00:19:19.529 --> 00:19:23.529
If every element on a page needs
to justify its place on that page,

291
00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:26.524
it needs to help improve
conversion in some way.

292
00:19:26.524 --> 00:19:30.177
If it doesn't, then it's out of there.

293
00:19:30.177 --> 00:19:33.650
Secondly, use imagery and
shapes to lead attention,

294
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:38.415
to show where people should be looking,
to focus them on the right things.

295
00:19:38.415 --> 00:19:44.443
Pay particular attention to calls to
action to make sure they're working hard.

296
00:19:44.443 --> 00:19:48.642
And the people spot them and
consider that post click experience.

297
00:19:48.642 --> 00:19:51.906
Cuz if you don't get that
post click experience right,

298
00:19:51.906 --> 00:19:54.415
you're gonna be in some serious trouble.
