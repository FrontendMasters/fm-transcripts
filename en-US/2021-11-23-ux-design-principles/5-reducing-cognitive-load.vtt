00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.178
The second thing, the second
psychological pillar to really creating

2
00:00:05.178 --> 00:00:09.255
high-converting websites is
defeating cognitive load.

3
00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:14.790
And I would go as far as saying this is
probably the best thing you can do, right?

4
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.380
And this is where design becomes so,
so important.

5
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.937
Now, if you haven't come
across cognitive load before,

6
00:00:24.937 --> 00:00:30.899
it's basically because of the way
system two works, our conscious brain.

7
00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.567
Because our conscious brain
is a finite resource,

8
00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:38.148
if you're doing too many
things at the same time,

9
00:00:38.148 --> 00:00:44.420
your cognitive load goes up and
you get overwhelmed and can't cope, right?

10
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.440
And that causes some really
interesting scenarios.

11
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.490
So first of all, let's talk about
what causes high cognitive load.

12
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.844
Have you ever had those
mornings where you wake up and

13
00:00:54.844 --> 00:00:56.461
you're just in a bad mood, right?

14
00:00:56.461 --> 00:00:59.960
Doesn't matter, maybe you had a bad
dream or something like that.

15
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.777
And notice what happens on those days,
everything goes wrong, all right?

16
00:01:03.777 --> 00:01:07.132
If you wake up in a bad mood,
the day just gets worse, okay?

17
00:01:07.132 --> 00:01:09.181
It's like everybody annoys you.

18
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:11.316
Everything's more difficult than normal.

19
00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:16.757
And that's because your bad mood increases
your cognitive load, makes it higher.

20
00:01:16.757 --> 00:01:22.995
So that's one way that cognitive
load can be a problem.

21
00:01:22.995 --> 00:01:26.803
So if you're using dark patterns on
your site and irritating people,

22
00:01:26.803 --> 00:01:28.545
they're gonna be in a bad mood,

23
00:01:28.545 --> 00:01:32.434
which means they're gonna find
the website harder to use, all right?

24
00:01:32.434 --> 00:01:35.364
The second thing is inconsistencies.

25
00:01:35.364 --> 00:01:40.057
So for example,
if the navigation moves around or

26
00:01:40.057 --> 00:01:44.752
the design is inconsistent
through the website,

27
00:01:44.752 --> 00:01:49.687
it confuses people,
their cognitive load goes up.

28
00:01:49.687 --> 00:01:52.840
And as you'll see in a minute,
that causes bad consequences.

29
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.220
Then there's just a confusing
display with too much going on,

30
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.407
too much trying to grab your attention.

31
00:01:58.407 --> 00:02:00.707
That increases cognitive load as well.

32
00:02:00.707 --> 00:02:03.523
And the final one is we're poorly primed.

33
00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:06.336
In other words, when we hit a website or

34
00:02:06.336 --> 00:02:10.782
a webpage, it doesn't perform
as we expected it to perform.

35
00:02:10.782 --> 00:02:15.360
So a really classic example
of that is search, right?

36
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.260
If you go to a website,
where do you look to search?

37
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.416
The chances are your eye immediately
goes to the right-hand corner,

38
00:02:23.416 --> 00:02:24.761
doesn't it, right?

39
00:02:24.761 --> 00:02:26.477
That's often where a search box is.

40
00:02:26.477 --> 00:02:29.498
And you're looking,
your eye is looking for an input field,

41
00:02:29.498 --> 00:02:31.193
probably with a button beside it.

42
00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:35.698
And then everything that you've
learned previously tells you to type

43
00:02:35.698 --> 00:02:39.907
into that input field your search term and
press search, right?

44
00:02:39.907 --> 00:02:42.474
That's called procedure knowledge,

45
00:02:42.474 --> 00:02:46.604
where we learn that a certain
series of steps leads to a result.

46
00:02:46.604 --> 00:02:48.749
But if your website is different for

47
00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:53.340
whatever reason, then you're gonna
increase people's cognitive load.

48
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.045
And I could give you a real-world
example of this on my own website.

49
00:02:57.045 --> 00:02:58.474
This was quite a while ago.

50
00:02:58.474 --> 00:03:00.208
I've learnt my lesson here.

51
00:03:00.208 --> 00:03:05.141
But I designed a website wherein the top
right-hand corner was a call to action for

52
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:07.750
people to sign up to my newsletter.

53
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.680
And it had a box for email address and
a signup button next to it.

54
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.954
And it was so ingrained in people to look
there for search that I would regularly

55
00:03:16.954 --> 00:03:20.700
get emails from people saying
your search isn't working.

56
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.357
Cuz they typed in a search term,
hit submit, and, of course,

57
00:03:24.357 --> 00:03:27.398
it wasn't an email address,
so it invalidated it.

58
00:03:27.398 --> 00:03:29.764
It wouldn't come up cuz it
was a newsletter signup.

59
00:03:29.764 --> 00:03:32.964
But people were so
confused that I overwhelmed them.

60
00:03:32.964 --> 00:03:38.060
Their cognitive load went up so
high that they made mistakes.

61
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.041
And a high cognitive load is
devastating to your conversion on

62
00:03:43.041 --> 00:03:46.504
your website, absolutely devastating.

63
00:03:46.504 --> 00:03:50.371
For a start,
your website is gonna feel difficult.

64
00:03:50.371 --> 00:03:53.410
It's gonna feel like hard work, right?

65
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.050
But that's fairly obvious.

66
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.848
But then you start to get some really
bizarre behavior that comes out of high

67
00:03:59.848 --> 00:04:01.560
cognitive load.

68
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.810
So we end up feeling like
something's unfair, right?

69
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.443
So you might have a really good deal on
your website, a really good offering,

70
00:04:11.443 --> 00:04:13.741
right, for a fair reasonable price.

71
00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:19.063
But if your website is hard to use and
people's cognitive load is high,

72
00:04:19.063 --> 00:04:22.530
that deal won't look as good to them,
right?

73
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.777
Just a weird fluke of human psychology.

74
00:04:25.777 --> 00:04:29.947
Also, they're more likely to think
you're lying on the website.

75
00:04:29.947 --> 00:04:32.433
They're not gonna trust
your testimonials as much.

76
00:04:32.433 --> 00:04:35.176
They're not gonna trust
your reviews as much,

77
00:04:35.176 --> 00:04:37.653
just because your website's hard to use.

78
00:04:37.653 --> 00:04:41.740
And they're just gonna feel bad
about the whole experience.

79
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.410
So cognitive load is so, so important.

80
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.610
But I recognize it's quite a difficult
concept to wrap your head around.

81
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.730
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
play a little video, right?.

82
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.838
The instructions are gonna be written
on the screen, okay, and they come up.

83
00:04:56.838 --> 00:05:01.566
And I want you to try and
follow the instructions, and

84
00:05:01.566 --> 00:05:07.678
we'll come back afterwards and
we'll see what you say, all right?

85
00:05:07.678 --> 00:05:08.694
Are you ready?

86
00:05:08.694 --> 00:05:11.469
Okay, you need to pay attention to this.

87
00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:18.661
Yeah.

88
00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:24.036
How many passes did
the team in white make?

89
00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:41.514
Did you get it right?

90
00:05:41.514 --> 00:05:43.833
Did you get 13?

91
00:05:43.833 --> 00:05:46.635
But did you see the moonwalking bear?

92
00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:58.012
You see it?

93
00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:05.748
Now that, if you did the exercise and
if you didn't see the moonwalking bear,

94
00:06:05.748 --> 00:06:10.800
that was because your cognitive
load was overwhelmed.

95
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.295
Now, some people will see
the moonwalking bear.

96
00:06:13.295 --> 00:06:14.889
It might not work with you.

97
00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.444
You might have spotted it, and
that could happen for a number of reasons.

98
00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:21.757
One reason is you might just
be very relaxed anyway, right?

99
00:06:21.757 --> 00:06:25.307
That there were outside factors going
on where you were in a really good

100
00:06:25.307 --> 00:06:27.965
environment, and so
you saw the moonwalking bear.

101
00:06:27.965 --> 00:06:31.380
Others of you who didn't see it
might have been in a really busy,

102
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.810
stressful work environment or not giving
this presentation your full attention or

103
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.658
whatever else, so you missed it.

104
00:06:37.658 --> 00:06:42.400
But the point is because you
were concentrating on counting,

105
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.430
your cognitive load shot up and
you missed the moonwalking bear.

106
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:55.300
So that is a great example of where
cognitive load can be enormously damaging.

107
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.706
Because if you can miss a moonwalking
bear, it means you can miss a call to

108
00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:05.190
action, a critical piece of content,
or anything else on your website.

109
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.162
So we need to reduce
people's cognitive load.

110
00:07:08.162 --> 00:07:10.110
So how do we do that?

111
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.927
Well, the most simple way is to
simplify your user interface, right,

112
00:07:14.927 --> 00:07:19.103
to have less balls being passed and
less players on the field so

113
00:07:19.103 --> 00:07:22.520
the moonwalking bear stands out more.

114
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.194
And we're gonna talk about that more
later when we get into design and

115
00:07:27.194 --> 00:07:32.606
how design works and how design can be
used to reduce people's cognitive load.

116
00:07:32.606 --> 00:07:36.332
There's some very simple techniques
that you can use around that.

117
00:07:36.332 --> 00:07:40.429
Other things you could do is design for
maximum visibility so

118
00:07:40.429 --> 00:07:44.703
that the user's eye is drawn to
the moonwalking bear, right?

119
00:07:44.703 --> 00:07:48.021
If that moonwalking bear
was wearing lime green,

120
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:51.107
for example,
would have stood out a lot more.

121
00:07:51.107 --> 00:07:54.009
If the moonwalking bear had been
a lot taller than the other players,

122
00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:57.327
he would have stood out a lot more and you
would have been more likely to see him.

123
00:07:57.327 --> 00:08:01.119
So we're gonna get into that as well
as we talk about design later on.

124
00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:07.089
But we can also do it through
techniques like chunking.

125
00:08:07.089 --> 00:08:11.447
I don't know whether you're aware
of the idea of chunking, but

126
00:08:11.447 --> 00:08:14.512
basically, if you've got a lot of options,

127
00:08:14.512 --> 00:08:19.295
if you've got a lot of players, for
example, on a basketball court.

128
00:08:19.295 --> 00:08:23.748
Then you can group them together,
and so your moonwalking bear

129
00:08:23.748 --> 00:08:28.378
would have stood out more because
he would be in a group of his own.

130
00:08:28.378 --> 00:08:31.350
That's a bit of a overstretched analogy.

131
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.060
So let me give you an easier one, right?

132
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.669
Your credit card,
if you look at your credit card,

133
00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:38.742
it's got 16-digit number, right?

134
00:08:38.742 --> 00:08:42.413
There's no way our system two brain or
system one for

135
00:08:42.413 --> 00:08:46.592
that matter is capable of
holding 16 digits in your head.

136
00:08:46.592 --> 00:08:47.632
You just can't do it.

137
00:08:47.632 --> 00:08:49.150
It's not possible.

138
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:53.977
So what the credit cards do, they split
it into four groups of four cuz it makes

139
00:08:53.977 --> 00:08:57.419
it easier for us to remember and
read back that number.

140
00:08:57.419 --> 00:09:02.024
And we can use exactly the same
techniques with things

141
00:09:02.024 --> 00:09:05.614
like the navigation on a website, okay?

142
00:09:05.614 --> 00:09:10.320
Instead of having eight options, right,
have two groups of four options,

143
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.877
makes it a lot easier for people to
process that information, right, and

144
00:09:14.877 --> 00:09:17.480
keeps their cognitive load low.

145
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.220
Another example would be email,
sorry, e-commerce categories, okay?

146
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.043
If we have lots of e-commerce categories,

147
00:09:25.043 --> 00:09:29.820
then group them together to make
them easier for people to process.

148
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.040
So again, we can get into all
of this kind of thing more.
