WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.213
Okay, so in the first session,

2
00:00:02.213 --> 00:00:07.650
we will be really looking at was the kind
of underlying psychology of conversion.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.960
What encourages people to take action?

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.180
What puts them off?

5
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.564
That kind of thing.

6
00:00:12.564 --> 00:00:17.112
In this session, we're now gonna
start to build on those psychological

7
00:00:17.112 --> 00:00:20.921
principles to explore how to
create a compelling offering.

8
00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:23.825
Because no matter how
great your design is or

9
00:00:23.825 --> 00:00:26.964
how well coded your website
is if the offering,

10
00:00:26.964 --> 00:00:33.060
the content of the website isn't
compelling you're not gonna get anywhere.

11
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.725
Ultimately, content is key
when it comes to conversion.

12
00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:42.440
The problem is that most people
have pretty bad creating

13
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.970
good what web copy, and
I include marketers in that.

14
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:55.644
In truth, it is a very specific discipline
to create really good compelling web copy.

15
00:00:55.644 --> 00:01:00.217
Fortunately, it's something that can be
learned relatively easily at least to

16
00:01:00.217 --> 00:01:04.994
start off with and although ideally you'd
probably want a professional copywriter

17
00:01:04.994 --> 00:01:08.088
to help you out that isn't
always gonna be possible and

18
00:01:08.088 --> 00:01:11.201
to be honest it's probably
better off you having a go.

19
00:01:11.201 --> 00:01:14.261
Then is some marketer, or some client, or

20
00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:20.040
stakeholder who really has got very
little experience writing good copy.

21
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.164
So in this section, I really wanna show
you how to go about creating copy,

22
00:01:25.164 --> 00:01:30.270
how to give it a go yourself even
if that copy is just draft copy.

23
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.630
Okay, then somebody else refines and
improves over time.

24
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.390
So that's kind of the aim of this section.

25
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.899
So the way we're gonna break that down,
is we're gonna look at three

26
00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.721
crucial questions that you need to be
asking yourself before you decide on

27
00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:51.699
what you're offering is, or how you're
gonna present your offering, and

28
00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:54.681
in particular, before you create any copy.

29
00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:57.878
Then we're gonna look at the process
of creating what's called

30
00:01:57.878 --> 00:01:59.010
a value proposition.

31
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.412
And then finally, we're going to
explore some different techniques and

32
00:02:04.412 --> 00:02:08.519
tips that you can use for
creating great copy yourself.

33
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:15.031
Now, my first piece of advice is,
when you are asked to wireframe or

34
00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:18.994
produce mock ups or
anything like that don't wait for

35
00:02:18.994 --> 00:02:24.475
the client to give you copy righ&gt; t but
don't you Use lorem ipsum either.

36
00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:30.835
Oftentimes when we do mock ups it takes
forever to get any decent copy out of

37
00:02:30.835 --> 00:02:31.795
the client and

38
00:02:31.795 --> 00:02:37.055
even when they do deliver copy is
normally not particularly good copy.

39
00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:42.484
So, actually a better approach is for you
to have a go at creating the messaging and

40
00:02:42.484 --> 00:02:47.410
the layout and how all of these
different parts work together.

41
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.037
And then the client or
the stakeholders involved could tweak and

42
00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:52.521
change that afterwards.

43
00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:54.799
But if you set the basis for it,

44
00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.839
then you can bake in best
practice from the beginning.

45
00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:04.227
And you'll be able to have a conversation
with the client rather than just sending

46
00:03:04.227 --> 00:03:09.458
you a word document with pages and pages
of text that you copy and paste across and

47
00:03:09.458 --> 00:03:15.270
it's going to be completely and compelling
to anybody so with that in mind.

48
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.160
You're gonna have a go at the copy
what do you need to think about.

49
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.715
As I said, there are three crucial
questions you need to ask yourself before

50
00:03:23.715 --> 00:03:26.360
you have a go at creating
the copy yourself.

51
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.660
And the first question
is who are your users?

52
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.650
Who is it that you're trying to reach and
appeal to?

53
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.067
Now, I'm not gonna get into
things like user research here or

54
00:03:39.067 --> 00:03:43.772
anything like that, because to be
quite frank I could spend a whole day

55
00:03:43.772 --> 00:03:46.428
just talking about that kind of stuff.

56
00:03:46.428 --> 00:03:50.509
But having a clear picture in
your head of who your users are,

57
00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:54.832
is really important when it comes
to creating a compelling value

58
00:03:54.832 --> 00:03:58.451
proposition that will make
them want to act, right?

59
00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:02.819
So you need to know who they are what
motivates them in particular,

60
00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.655
you wanna know what questions they've got,
what concerns do they have,

61
00:04:07.655 --> 00:04:09.605
what their ultimate goal is,

62
00:04:09.605 --> 00:04:15.570
what pain points they're hoping you can
help them overcome things like that.

63
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.470
Now, different people approach
this in different ways.

64
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.996
It might be that you know somebody Who
is one of the potential group that

65
00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:27.596
you're trying to appeal to,
in which case, as you produce your copy,

66
00:04:27.596 --> 00:04:32.604
you can just picture that person in your
head at the most basic level, right?

67
00:04:32.604 --> 00:04:35.286
You could also use personas.

68
00:04:35.286 --> 00:04:39.831
As long as those personas are telling
you truly useful information

69
00:04:39.831 --> 00:04:44.702
like that I listed above rather than
just George has 2.3 children and

70
00:04:44.702 --> 00:04:48.451
lives in a semi detached house and
reads the Guardian.

71
00:04:48.451 --> 00:04:51.986
That kind of information isn't
necessarily gonna be that helpful

72
00:04:51.986 --> 00:04:53.321
in creating great copy.

73
00:04:53.321 --> 00:04:57.207
So you need to have at least
an understanding of those tasks and

74
00:04:57.207 --> 00:05:00.620
objections and questions and
that kind of thing.

75
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.550
Another exercise you might find very
useful is customer journey mapping.

76
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.833
If you've never done
customer journey mapping,

77
00:05:06.833 --> 00:05:10.435
I'd encourage you to google it and
have a look but basically what it's doing?

78
00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:13.735
Is it's outlining the user's
experience over time and

79
00:05:13.735 --> 00:05:15.981
the different questions they have and

80
00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:21.360
different tasks they wanna complete at
different points within their journey.

81
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.559
And that can be very helpful because not
only does it helps you understand the user

82
00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:29.840
better but also help you understand the
context of the website you're creating.

83
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.080
Where does it fit into things?

84
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.302
So for example, some websites will take
the customer through the entire build

85
00:05:37.302 --> 00:05:42.580
up buying cycle and E-commerce website
is a classic example of this, right?

86
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.809
You go on to the website, you research
your product, you select the product,

87
00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:49.500
you make a purchase, and
then it's delivered and

88
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.596
you can do returns of things
through the website as well.

89
00:05:52.596 --> 00:05:56.321
In other cases your website might
just do a part of the journey, for

90
00:05:56.321 --> 00:06:00.791
example if you're buying a service like
if you are hiring a web design company.

91
00:06:00.791 --> 00:06:04.574
Then the contract would be
to contact the people so

92
00:06:04.574 --> 00:06:08.816
part of the sales process is
happening off the website.

93
00:06:08.816 --> 00:06:14.149
So you kind of, Helps to understand the
context that the user is in when they're

94
00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:19.247
interacting with your website and
actually understanding this journey and

95
00:06:19.247 --> 00:06:24.341
this that users go on is is a really
fundamental part of kind of understanding

96
00:06:24.341 --> 00:06:30.430
the whole structure and how you present
the different messages that you have.

97
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.400
So, understanding where that website fits
within the journey is really important.

98
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.984
So, is I'm not expecting you to be
able to read this slide, don't worry,

99
00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:46.746
but this is the a mock up that I did have
a particular journey that I was doing for

100
00:06:46.746 --> 00:06:50.225
one of my own courses that
I sell on my website.

101
00:06:50.225 --> 00:06:55.021
So there was a landing page of course,
for the course I was selling but

102
00:06:55.021 --> 00:06:58.013
actually a load of happened prior to that.

103
00:06:58.013 --> 00:07:02.907
So I started off by surveying people
about what they might be interested in,

104
00:07:02.907 --> 00:07:04.291
in terms of a course.

105
00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:06.236
And I got people to sign up for

106
00:07:06.236 --> 00:07:11.103
a pre-launch mailing list,to express
an initial interest in it, and

107
00:07:11.103 --> 00:07:15.910
I kind of drip fed them a few emails
before they got to the landing page.

108
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.410
And then of course that is a big
difference in their mindset when they hit

109
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.220
that landing page to somebody
who just come in cold.

110
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.045
I'd already prepared them
a lot in that journey so

111
00:07:27.045 --> 00:07:31.320
that they were ready to buy by
the time they hit the landing page.

112
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.494
So understanding what's happening
around the particular website or

113
00:07:35.494 --> 00:07:39.280
page that you'll produce is really,
really important.

114
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.740
And not just what happens leading up to
it but also happens afterwards what email

115
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.482
communication so
they can receive afterwards.

116
00:07:46.482 --> 00:07:49.380
How you're gonna update
them about their order or

117
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.930
whatever it is that the call
to action involved.

118
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.850
So essentially what we're
talking about here is thinking

119
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.490
about About the sales funnel, right?

120
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:05.121
This is a concept marketers talk about a
lot of the journey that uses going on and

121
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:07.570
the different stages in it.

122
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.813
So, step one in sauna was attracting
people's attention it's grabbing their

123
00:08:11.813 --> 00:08:14.250
attention for the first time, right?

124
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.240
So let's use this for example.

125
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.273
So you're may be coming across me for
the first time you've never had about me

126
00:08:21.273 --> 00:08:26.632
before, so I've attracted your attention
actually through doing this course.

127
00:08:26.632 --> 00:08:30.729
Now, then the next stage in a sales funnel
is to make a connection with people.

128
00:08:30.729 --> 00:08:35.561
So maybe because you have heard me
speak at this course you might go and

129
00:08:35.561 --> 00:08:39.680
google my name and
that will take you to my website.

130
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.970
And then I want to make a connection.

131
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.857
So I want to get you to sign up to my
mailing list, for example, all right?

132
00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:48.120
So the landing page has to get you
to sign up to my mailing list and

133
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.320
that's the conversion point then,
then I've got to keep you engaged, right?

134
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.194
So I've got to keep you interested,

135
00:08:54.194 --> 00:08:59.210
until you're at a point where potentially
you might want to hire me for my services.

136
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.940
Okay, that's a typical sales journey of
attract attention, make a connection,

137
00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.910
keep engagement and
then encourage contact.

138
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:13.127
Or make a purchase or whatever that
final step is in your particular case.

139
00:09:13.127 --> 00:09:18.296
All of this provides the context
within which your website sits and

140
00:09:18.296 --> 00:09:20.880
the copy that you produce sits and

141
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.879
makes an enormous difference on
what you say and when you say it.

142
00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:30.676
Because if somebody knows when they hit
your website if they potentially know

143
00:09:30.676 --> 00:09:35.767
nothing about your product or service,
you're gonna have to say a very different

144
00:09:35.767 --> 00:09:40.713
set of things than somebody who's already
been pre prepared through something

145
00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:45.118
like an email campaign or something or
even a pay per click ad Equally.

146
00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:49.593
If somebody is promised something in
a pay per click ad then when they hit

147
00:09:49.593 --> 00:09:53.938
the website you've got to make sure
you deliver that straightaway.

148
00:09:53.938 --> 00:09:58.610
So context is everything understanding
your users needs is everything
