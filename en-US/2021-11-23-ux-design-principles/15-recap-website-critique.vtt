1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.007
So let's sum up what we've said
in this section about content and

2
00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:05.178
content creation.

3
00:00:05.178 --> 00:00:09.792
First of all, you've got to
really understand your user and

4
00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:11.971
your user journey, right?

5
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:16.860
Not make assumptions about who you think
your users are and what they want,

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.921
that leads to dangerous consequences
cuz your assumptions are often wrong.

7
00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:26.783
Secondly, you need to understand where
the content that you're creating

8
00:00:26.783 --> 00:00:28.719
sits in the overall journey.

9
00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:31.402
Are someone just discovering about you for

10
00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:34.990
the first time or
are they returning for the 50th time?

11
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.528
Where does it sit in their experience
of grabbing attention through to,

12
00:00:41.528 --> 00:00:47.329
making contact and purchasing,
through to post delivery etc.

13
00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.745
And then be clear on what you want the
user to do, what are your calls to action?

14
00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:54.981
What steps are you gonna make?

15
00:00:54.981 --> 00:01:02.397
Have you simplified that down to a simple
clear ask that anyone can complete?

16
00:01:02.397 --> 00:01:07.213
And then you need to build a value
proposition around users and users needs,

17
00:01:07.213 --> 00:01:12.330
so that they understand specifically how
it's gonna help them, how it's gonna

18
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.093
benefit them, and how you're gonna
go about delivering those benefits.

19
00:01:17.093 --> 00:01:21.201
And then as you write your copy
you need to write it in a clear,

20
00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:23.143
structured way that human.

21
00:01:23.143 --> 00:01:29.320
The rule of thumb I use, right,
when it comes to writing copy is could I,

22
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.213
if I'm sitting in a coffee shop
with someone just chatting, right?

23
00:01:35.213 --> 00:01:41.809
Could I say that copy out loud to them and
it not sound weird, right?

24
00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:46.931
Too often the copy that we have
the answers users questions,

25
00:01:46.931 --> 00:01:52.466
sounds so fake and it's not
conversational and it's not human.

26
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:55.056
Your copy has to be more human.

27
00:01:55.056 --> 00:01:58.877
Okay, should we talk a little
bit about this as a sample site?

28
00:01:58.877 --> 00:02:03.135
If anybody's got suggestions for
other sites they wanna look at,

29
00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:06.570
then I'm more than happy to
talk about those as well.

30
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.520
But it's always good to look at our kinda
practical example of this and see how some

31
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.840
of those principles we've talked about so
far apply in the real world.

32
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.193
So, let's talk about this page.

33
00:02:20.193 --> 00:02:24.770
Advance your skills with in-depth,
modern front-end engineering courses.

34
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.660
Great, couldn't ask for
better strapline than that, right?

35
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.050
It's got a very obvious benefit which
is in bigger text, advance your skills.

36
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.827
Brilliant, very clear how
it's gonna benefit people.

37
00:02:37.827 --> 00:02:42.819
And it's also self actualization,
they call it, improving yourself

38
00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.559
is one of the most attractive things for
people in developed Western

39
00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:52.985
countries where their basic needs like
food and that shelter are dealt with.

40
00:02:52.985 --> 00:02:58.092
So we love the idea of improving
ourselves, so great, strong strapline.

41
00:02:58.092 --> 00:03:01.793
And then add to that,
the fact that it makes it clear,

42
00:03:01.793 --> 00:03:04.030
well what the thing is, right?

43
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.745
So you can make a promise
like advance your skills but

44
00:03:07.745 --> 00:03:12.051
if you're not also saying how
you're gonna deliver that and

45
00:03:12.051 --> 00:03:16.625
through what mechanism,
then you haven't made things clear.

46
00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:22.967
Front-end engineering courses, brilliant,
love it, can't fault that, great job.

47
00:03:22.967 --> 00:03:27.640
Then we get into things
like calls to action.

48
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.468
Calls to action,
we've got a nice, simplified,

49
00:03:32.468 --> 00:03:35.960
two sets of calls to action, right?

50
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.883
So there's not too many calls to action,
not too much stuff competing for

51
00:03:39.883 --> 00:03:40.841
your attention.

52
00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:44.818
But one of the problems, and I think
I might even touch on this later, so

53
00:03:44.818 --> 00:03:47.485
apologies if I'm jumping
around a little bit.

54
00:03:47.485 --> 00:03:51.859
One of the problems that they've just
fallen into here is that we've got

55
00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.390
two calls to action that are actually
very similar to one another, right?

56
00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.233
That it's not immediately clear
what the difference is between

57
00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:05.455
browse our courses and
view learning paths is, right?

58
00:04:05.455 --> 00:04:10.463
And when you have two calls to action
that are quite similar to one another,

59
00:04:10.463 --> 00:04:14.756
then it can cause paralysis,
it can cause people not to choose or

60
00:04:14.756 --> 00:04:19.150
they choose the wrong option that
gives them a false impression.

61
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.127
So it might be that having those two calls
to action isn't really necessary at this

62
00:04:24.127 --> 00:04:24.639
point.

63
00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.089
Maybe we take them into one or
the other to begin with and

64
00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:31.765
then have a secondary one that
takes them on after that, so

65
00:04:31.765 --> 00:04:35.008
that you can control
the journey a little bit more.

66
00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:37.758
Because I mean,
there's some great examples there.

67
00:04:37.758 --> 00:04:40.690
One of my all time favorites is Wikipedia,
right?

68
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.518
Wikipedia used to have a search
box on their website, and

69
00:04:44.518 --> 00:04:49.649
then next to the search box they didn't
have one submit button they had two.

70
00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:55.640
And the one submit button said search and
the other one said go.

71
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.020
What's the difference?

72
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.642
Now actually,
one would search all of Wikipedia for

73
00:05:02.642 --> 00:05:05.730
whatever phrase that you just typed in.

74
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:11.750
The other would go to this page specific
to that particular phrase, right?

75
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.751
But that's a very confusing and

76
00:05:14.751 --> 00:05:18.140
subtle difference that increases
people's cognitive load.

77
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.640
And we've got a similar thing here.

78
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.353
I'm sure the guys could
easily explain the difference

79
00:05:26.353 --> 00:05:31.070
between the two, but
it shouldn't need explaining.

80
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.446
Now, then we've got some
different languages here which

81
00:05:35.446 --> 00:05:38.670
basically it's a clever mix of features.

82
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.240
In other words, it's showing that you
have courses on these different subjects.

83
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.582
But at the same time,
it's a type of social proof actually.

84
00:05:47.582 --> 00:05:52.479
It's kind of expert via association that
these are things that people recognize.

85
00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:56.399
They might not have heard
the Frontend Masters brand, but

86
00:05:56.399 --> 00:06:00.479
they have heard of node or react or
any of these other ones, so

87
00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.693
it helps reassure them that the content
is relevant and appropriate to them.

88
00:06:05.693 --> 00:06:10.876
And then they've completely
nailed the social proof

89
00:06:10.876 --> 00:06:17.338
side of things by pulling in
testimonials straight from Twitter.

90
00:06:17.338 --> 00:06:21.875
Which means you know that they're
real testimonials, right, and

91
00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:24.432
that they're completely reliable.

92
00:06:24.432 --> 00:06:28.938
So very good use of social proof there.

93
00:06:28.938 --> 00:06:34.291
Join now and learn straight from the
experts who shape the modern web, okay?

94
00:06:34.291 --> 00:06:39.447
Yeah, again, really a call to
action with a strong button.

95
00:06:39.447 --> 00:06:46.938
But we are lacking some
objection handling here.

96
00:06:46.938 --> 00:06:51.922
Because with this kind of thing there
are gonna be a lot of questions

97
00:06:51.922 --> 00:06:57.006
that are associated and its going for
the join now, quite quickly.

98
00:06:57.006 --> 00:07:00.934
Now admittedly, you've got a different
call to action that's going on up here.

99
00:07:00.934 --> 00:07:04.372
But it might be good to take
some of the types of courses,

100
00:07:04.372 --> 00:07:08.190
admittedly you're kind of showing
a bit of an overview here.

101
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.304
But have some content blocks showing some
different types of courses to give us

102
00:07:12.304 --> 00:07:15.185
a feeling of all the different
content that's there.

103
00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.951
You might wanna give
an indication of pricing, right?

104
00:07:17.951 --> 00:07:20.617
Especially when you get to the Join Now,
right?

105
00:07:20.617 --> 00:07:24.855
If I click on that what's gonna happen?

106
00:07:24.855 --> 00:07:28.767
Will I suddenly be expected
to part with my credit card?

107
00:07:28.767 --> 00:07:33.120
Here we go, so now we're getting
into the pricing at this point.

108
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.864
Well, perhaps that needs to be
brought up to the homepage, so

109
00:07:36.864 --> 00:07:39.530
that there's a decision being made there.

110
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.775
Then we've got a load of fields
like you'd pretty much except, but

111
00:07:43.775 --> 00:07:48.036
maybe that needs to be chunked,
broken down into a series of steps.

112
00:07:48.036 --> 00:07:50.274
So it doesn't feel to like quite so

113
00:07:50.274 --> 00:07:54.374
many overwhelming number of
fields that are available there.

114
00:07:54.374 --> 00:07:59.455
There's some interesting stuff going on
here as well from a design perspective.

115
00:07:59.455 --> 00:08:04.978
So, for example, getting someone to repeat
their password, isn't necessarily the best

116
00:08:04.978 --> 00:08:09.728
way of doing it cause you're doubling
the amount of data entry they have to do.

117
00:08:09.728 --> 00:08:12.126
Maybe you wanna instead just show them,

118
00:08:12.126 --> 00:08:15.945
allow them to view their password
with the little toggle thing.

119
00:08:15.945 --> 00:08:20.906
And that works very well because
it's reducing the amount of data

120
00:08:20.906 --> 00:08:25.426
entry which on mobile devices
is particularly important.

121
00:08:25.426 --> 00:08:27.266
And then the credit card stuff,

122
00:08:27.266 --> 00:08:30.685
maybe we wanna move that off
on to a different page, right?

123
00:08:30.685 --> 00:08:35.303
And the reason being is cuz it makes
the form feel more accessible and

124
00:08:35.303 --> 00:08:37.093
less work involved in it.

125
00:08:37.093 --> 00:08:42.027
And better still, that if they fill in
this information get to the point of

126
00:08:42.027 --> 00:08:46.335
making a transaction and
then don't do it for whatever reason.

127
00:08:46.335 --> 00:08:50.942
Because they've already submitted
the first part of the form we've got their

128
00:08:50.942 --> 00:08:55.476
email address, which means that we can
send them a follow up saying we noticed

129
00:08:55.476 --> 00:09:00.400
you didn't finish entering the data, is
there anything we can do to help, right?

130
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.000
And then finally, CAPTCHA is evil and
it should never be on a website and

131
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.751
I'd fight anyone who disagrees.

132
00:09:05.751 --> 00:09:10.028
So, there you go, there's a little
bit about Frontend Masters.

133
00:09:10.028 --> 00:09:14.289
Does anybody else want to share a site or
should we move on and

134
00:09:14.289 --> 00:09:19.076
then maybe look at another site
a little bit further down the line?

135
00:09:19.076 --> 00:09:24.059
Actually while if anybody wants to
recommend a site pop it into chat now.

136
00:09:24.059 --> 00:09:25.507
But in the meantime,

137
00:09:25.507 --> 00:09:30.424
I just wanna show you a nice example
of content blocks in action, right?

138
00:09:30.424 --> 00:09:35.927
So this is Stripe's homepage which I love,
I think it's a beautifully designed one.

139
00:09:35.927 --> 00:09:40.678
And, again, they do a lot right on this
site, I think it's worth pointing out.

140
00:09:40.678 --> 00:09:44.941
So they've got a nice clear strap line
again, payment infrastructure for

141
00:09:44.941 --> 00:09:45.829
the internet.

142
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:50.745
But notice how we're beginning
to get content blocks, heading,

143
00:09:50.745 --> 00:09:53.567
small piece of copy, links, image.

144
00:09:53.567 --> 00:09:59.089
And if we scroll down, heading,
piece of copy, link, image underneath.

145
00:09:59.089 --> 00:10:03.936
Scroll down more, heading, block or
copy, link, sociated image.

146
00:10:03.936 --> 00:10:08.790
They've even nested one content
block inside another in this, so

147
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.356
that's kind of one.

148
00:10:10.356 --> 00:10:14.242
And then you've got these
two smaller ones inside.

149
00:10:14.242 --> 00:10:18.884
So we've got image, heading, there'll
be a copy, link, done it again there.

150
00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:23.857
And their whole page is built up
in this way, here it is again.

151
00:10:23.857 --> 00:10:27.853
And notice how easy that is to scan and
how engaging it is.

152
00:10:27.853 --> 00:10:33.712
Because if all I do is read the world's
most powerful and easy to API.

153
00:10:33.712 --> 00:10:37.364
I know all I need to know
without having to read this, but

154
00:10:37.364 --> 00:10:39.786
if I want that detail, I can read it.

155
00:10:39.786 --> 00:10:44.275
And if I want even more detail, I can
click through to the documentations and

156
00:10:44.275 --> 00:10:46.250
drill down into the detail of it.

157
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:52.020
This is good, engaging, well structured,
content that leads me through.

158
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:57.721
And notice, again, we've got value
proposition, social proof, all right?

159
00:10:57.721 --> 00:11:03.900
Then we start to get into features,
fully integrated suite of products,

160
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.098
API, and
then more features again going on here.

161
00:11:08.098 --> 00:11:13.827
So is it's a very well structured,
and then showing that they've

162
00:11:13.827 --> 00:11:19.266
got the capacity to deal with it feature,
feature, feature.

163
00:11:19.266 --> 00:11:23.873
What they are lacking is benefits,
they don't talk a lot about benefits.

164
00:11:23.873 --> 00:11:27.136
And in some ways Frontend Masters
does a better job

165
00:11:27.136 --> 00:11:30.409
at that in its value
proposition on the homepage.

166
00:11:30.409 --> 00:11:35.955
&gt;&gt; What's your thought on those super long
sales funnel pages that go on and on and

167
00:11:35.955 --> 00:11:41.432
finally end with a single call to action
button at the very bottom of the page?

168
00:11:41.432 --> 00:11:46.337
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're very interesting,
it's an old form

169
00:11:46.337 --> 00:11:51.904
technique that predates
the internet by many, many years.

170
00:11:51.904 --> 00:11:57.125
They are very effective for
a certain audience in a certain situation.

171
00:11:57.125 --> 00:12:01.337
They work less well on the web,
I'm actually working for

172
00:12:01.337 --> 00:12:04.948
a client right now that
uses that as a technique.

173
00:12:04.948 --> 00:12:09.332
And what you can do is,
is you can combine kind of more modern

174
00:12:09.332 --> 00:12:13.733
techniques with that to create
quite powerful solutions.

175
00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:18.645
So the way that you normally do it
in that situation is you have what I

176
00:12:18.645 --> 00:12:22.350
would call a standard
landing page to begin with.

177
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:27.114
Where you have value proposition,
summary of the offering, call to action,

178
00:12:27.114 --> 00:12:29.362
benefits, features social proof.

179
00:12:29.362 --> 00:12:34.113
But then it goes on into
the long-form stuff after that with

180
00:12:34.113 --> 00:12:40.483
the call-to-action repeated multiple
times down the page in my experience,

181
00:12:40.483 --> 00:12:45.522
with the various social proof
alongside the calls to action and

182
00:12:45.522 --> 00:12:47.730
some objection handling.

183
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.279
That's one way of dealing with it.

184
00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:53.752
My preference however, if it's
an organization that focuses on long form

185
00:12:53.752 --> 00:12:58.083
marketing like that, is actually you
have a very condensed landing page

186
00:12:58.083 --> 00:13:01.001
where the call to action is to sign up for
emails.

187
00:13:01.001 --> 00:13:05.552
And then you drip feed them
the information that would have been in

188
00:13:05.552 --> 00:13:09.125
the long form piece over
a series of days via email.

189
00:13:09.125 --> 00:13:13.557
If you've ever read the book, Launch,
that takes a similar approach using email.

190
00:13:13.557 --> 00:13:17.313
And it's basically taking the principles
of long form marketing and

191
00:13:17.313 --> 00:13:21.209
spreading it over a number of days
via email to achieve the same result.

192
00:13:21.209 --> 00:13:25.224
If I was on my own computer I could
actually show you a landing page that I've

193
00:13:25.224 --> 00:13:26.499
created with that, but

194
00:13:26.499 --> 00:13:30.221
unfortunately it's not available
on this machine unfortunately.

195
00:13:30.221 --> 00:13:34.964
But yeah it's got its place, but if you're
gonna go long form then it's really,

196
00:13:34.964 --> 00:13:37.303
really important to make it scannable,

197
00:13:37.303 --> 00:13:41.870
which leads nicely into the next section
we're gonna look at which is design.
