1
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.474
Okay, so in the third session that
we're gonna do in this course,

2
00:00:04.474 --> 00:00:07.168
we're gonna look at the subject of design.

3
00:00:07.168 --> 00:00:13.376
And how to go about creating great design
that encourages people to take action.

4
00:00:13.376 --> 00:00:16.942
Now the chances are that if
you're watching this course,

5
00:00:16.942 --> 00:00:21.091
because of the nature of the courses
that Frontend Masters create,

6
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:25.114
you're probably more development
focused than you are design.

7
00:00:25.114 --> 00:00:29.914
Yet, almost always, developers end up
having to do some design at some point.

8
00:00:29.914 --> 00:00:32.654
Sometimes they're doing the entire design.

9
00:00:32.654 --> 00:00:35.130
Sometimes they're just doing parts of it.

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.864
And it can be a very frustrating
experience producing a design.

11
00:00:38.864 --> 00:00:43.264
It's frustrating for designers,
let alone for a developer having to do it.

12
00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:47.922
And part of the problem from a development
point of view is when it comes to code,

13
00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:50.439
code either works or it doesn't, right?

14
00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:52.840
All design is subjective, isn't it?

15
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.003
Everybody's got an opinion on it.

16
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:59.939
And you can end up caught in these
endless loops of iteration, moving pixels

17
00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:05.201
around the page, changing colors just
to keep stakeholders and clients happy.

18
00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:07.853
But actually,
it doesn't need to be that way.

19
00:01:07.853 --> 00:01:11.863
They're all fundamental rules that
underpin a design process and

20
00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:16.315
enable you to say with confidence whether
a design is going to work or not.

21
00:01:16.315 --> 00:01:20.002
And so that's what we're gonna
explore in this section.

22
00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:24.764
We're gonna look at how design can
play a pivotal role in encouraging

23
00:01:24.764 --> 00:01:28.473
people to convert and
to take action on your website.

24
00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:31.865
And how we can ensure that
our design is appropriate for

25
00:01:31.865 --> 00:01:34.532
our audience that we're trying to reach.

26
00:01:34.532 --> 00:01:39.242
And hopefully in the process,
avoid all those endless iterations.

27
00:01:39.242 --> 00:01:44.505
So with that, let's have a look at what
we're gonna cover in this segment.

28
00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:50.256
We are gonna look at three fundamental
parts of creating any compelling design.

29
00:01:50.256 --> 00:01:55.030
One is the ability to lead people's
attention around the page that they look

30
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.772
at what we want them to look at
when we want them to look at it.

31
00:01:58.772 --> 00:02:03.431
Because we want to tell a story,
we wanna unpack what our offering is, and

32
00:02:03.431 --> 00:02:08.556
that means that we need people to look in
particular places at particular times.

33
00:02:08.556 --> 00:02:12.818
Second, we're gonna look at creating
compelling calls to action,

34
00:02:12.818 --> 00:02:16.279
the actual physical action
that we want people to take.

35
00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:21.489
Whether it be sign up for a newsletter,
make purchase a product, whatever it is,

36
00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.807
how do we make sure that users, a,
see them, and b, click on them?

37
00:02:25.807 --> 00:02:30.823
And then the third is how do
we ensure that our design,

38
00:02:30.823 --> 00:02:36.740
the aesthetics of a website
keeps users engaged, right?

39
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.216
How do we ensure that
it resonates with them,

40
00:02:39.216 --> 00:02:41.831
creates the best reaction
possible with them?

41
00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:46.176
And that is obviously where things
can get very subjective, and

42
00:02:46.176 --> 00:02:49.084
we're gonna get into
that as we come to it.

43
00:02:49.084 --> 00:02:51.570
So let's start with
the first of those three,

44
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.810
which is leading the user's attention.

45
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.195
And actually,
it's not as difficult as you think.

46
00:02:58.195 --> 00:03:01.500
It's actually just
a relatively straightforward

47
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.201
process that anybody can do even if
you're not particularly creative.

48
00:03:06.201 --> 00:03:10.017
Because I'm not claiming the designs that
you're gonna produce following watching

49
00:03:10.017 --> 00:03:12.304
this are gonna be beautiful or
gonna be wonderful.

50
00:03:12.304 --> 00:03:16.077
But they will convert, they will
encourage people to complete action.

51
00:03:16.077 --> 00:03:20.743
And the ability to lead someone's
attention around the page is

52
00:03:20.743 --> 00:03:24.713
really just a matter of
following a few simple rules.

53
00:03:24.713 --> 00:03:27.791
Rule number one is to simplify, okay?

54
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.631
So before you do your final design,

55
00:03:30.631 --> 00:03:35.092
you need to identify all
the content blocks you create.

56
00:03:35.092 --> 00:03:38.881
And you might wanna create a bit of
a wire frame, where you lay them all out

57
00:03:38.881 --> 00:03:42.196
on the page and kinda get
everything roughly in place, right?

58
00:03:42.196 --> 00:03:44.826
Doesn't need to be pretty at this stage.

59
00:03:44.826 --> 00:03:50.800
Now once you've done that, you're now
gonna wanna go back through that page.

60
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.767
And with each of the elements that you've
added, you're gonna wanna simplify them.

61
00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:59.466
You're gonna wanna reduce the complexity
of the page so people's cognitive load is

62
00:03:59.466 --> 00:04:04.180
lower, and they're not overwhelmed and
their eyes are skipping all over the page.

63
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.365
And the way you do that is for each
element that you've added to the page,

64
00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:14.054
ask three questions, and
ask these questions in order, right?

65
00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:18.047
Question number one is can I
remove this element, right?

66
00:04:18.047 --> 00:04:23.187
So that might be some social media
icons or it might be your primary

67
00:04:23.187 --> 00:04:27.870
call to action or your logo or
search box or navigation bar.

68
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.540
Whatever the item is, could you remove it?

69
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.880
If you removed it, would it undermine or
reduce your conversion rate in any way?

70
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.450
If the answer to that is no,
it wouldn't affect the conversion rate,

71
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.680
then you need to remove it.

72
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.800
Because items only have value
if they're actually moving

73
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.256
someone towards taking
action on your website.

74
00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:57.192
If anything else is just noise, it's just
clutter that is going to increase people's

75
00:04:57.192 --> 00:05:02.746
cognitive load, put them in a bad mood,
reduce the chance of their conversion.

76
00:05:02.746 --> 00:05:03.755
Put another way,

77
00:05:03.755 --> 00:05:08.040
we've all heard of the phrase finding
a needle in a haystack, right?

78
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.060
Every element you add to a page
is another piece of hay, right?

79
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.609
That makes it harder to find that needle,
key call to action,

80
00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:19.920
that key piece of content.

81
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.710
Effectively, users have limited attention
and we need to spend it wisely.

82
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.996
But that said,
you can't remove everything, right?

83
00:05:27.996 --> 00:05:31.333
Obviously, some content is very critical,
and so

84
00:05:31.333 --> 00:05:34.524
you wouldn't wanna remove
that from your site.

85
00:05:34.524 --> 00:05:39.394
Other content might not be critical for
your primary audience, but

86
00:05:39.394 --> 00:05:42.648
might be critical for
a secondary audience.

87
00:05:42.648 --> 00:05:48.427
So they can be things that you can't
remove, but maybe you can hide it.

88
00:05:48.427 --> 00:05:51.672
You can deemphasize it in some ways.

89
00:05:51.672 --> 00:05:56.230
So let's say, for example,
on an e-commerce site,

90
00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.097
the information about
account management and

91
00:06:00.097 --> 00:06:05.464
that kind of thing is not critical for
somebody buying the item.

92
00:06:05.464 --> 00:06:10.187
But it's still very important for
existing customers.

93
00:06:10.187 --> 00:06:15.940
So you don't wanna remove it entirely from
the website, but you might wanna hide it.

94
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.775
And by that, I mean, move it deeper
in the information architecture.

95
00:06:20.775 --> 00:06:23.220
Move it onto a subpage somewhere.

96
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.841
Or alternatively, put it under a tab or
a toggle or something like that.

97
00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:31.248
So it's not immediately
in people's way and

98
00:06:31.248 --> 00:06:34.610
it's not cluttering up
the visual interface.

99
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.438
So by moving things either deeper
in the information architecture,

100
00:06:38.438 --> 00:06:42.596
hiding them under a tab, or even putting
them lower on the page in a footer or

101
00:06:42.596 --> 00:06:43.858
something like that.

102
00:06:43.858 --> 00:06:49.180
You can help to deemphasize them and
clear the way for other content.

103
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.667
And then the third question you need
to ask, if you can't remove it or

104
00:06:52.667 --> 00:06:54.210
you can't hide it.

105
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:59.335
So typical examples of this would be
something like compliance information

106
00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:03.909
that you say you're selling insurance or
some financial service.

107
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:09.478
There's certain text that you have to
have visible for compliance reasons.

108
00:07:09.478 --> 00:07:12.150
Well, then your third option is,
can I shrink this?

109
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.984
Can I visually deemphasize it,
make it smaller font or a lighter color or

110
00:07:16.984 --> 00:07:20.235
whatever else to just
visually deemphasize it so

111
00:07:20.235 --> 00:07:23.740
that people's attention
stays in the right place?

112
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.266
And there is actually an exercise that
I sometimes do with stakeholders called

113
00:07:29.266 --> 00:07:31.184
a user attention point exercise.

114
00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:35.614
And in this exercise, I get all of my
stakeholders together, and together we

115
00:07:35.614 --> 00:07:40.048
brainstorm every conceivable item that
might need to go onto a landing page or

116
00:07:40.048 --> 00:07:40.744
homepage.

117
00:07:40.744 --> 00:07:44.731
And then when we finish doing that,
we can often end up with 50 or

118
00:07:44.731 --> 00:07:47.632
more different items that
can potentially go on

119
00:07:47.632 --> 00:07:51.929
from individual navigation items
to e-commerce categories, etc.

120
00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:53.620
After we've done that,

121
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.461
the next thing I say is I explain that
users have got limited attention.

122
00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:02.209
That people normally make
a decision about a website and

123
00:08:02.209 --> 00:08:05.889
whether to stay on it in
approximately eight seconds.

124
00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:10.769
And they can only process so
much information in those eight seconds.

125
00:08:10.769 --> 00:08:16.089
So I represent those eight seconds in
terms of points, user attention points.

126
00:08:16.089 --> 00:08:21.371
So for example, we could say they could
process two or three items in a second.

127
00:08:21.371 --> 00:08:27.037
So then we end up with 21 points of user
attention or something along those lines.

128
00:08:27.037 --> 00:08:31.546
And they have to spend those user
attention points on the different

129
00:08:31.546 --> 00:08:32.357
elements.

130
00:08:32.357 --> 00:08:36.506
The elements they want people
to pay more attention to,

131
00:08:36.506 --> 00:08:38.901
they have to add more points to.

132
00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:41.553
So a call to action may want four or
five or

133
00:08:41.553 --> 00:08:45.280
even more attention points
associated with it.

134
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.986
And it's a way of getting people to think
through the amount of noise that they're

135
00:08:50.986 --> 00:08:56.957
introducing, the amount of distractions
they're introducing onto the homepage.

136
00:08:56.957 --> 00:08:59.031
So simplify, simplify, simplify.

137
00:08:59.031 --> 00:09:02.758
Don't get seduced by adding
aesthetic elements for

138
00:09:02.758 --> 00:09:07.087
the sake of it, right,
pretty images and things like that.

139
00:09:07.087 --> 00:09:08.913
If it doesn't add value,

140
00:09:08.913 --> 00:09:14.894
if it's not gonna move people towards that
point of conversion, you don't want it.

141
00:09:14.894 --> 00:09:17.793
Less is more when it comes to design.

142
00:09:17.793 --> 00:09:20.636
So we simplify it as much as possible.

143
00:09:20.636 --> 00:09:23.484
Now we need to consider the page flow.

144
00:09:23.484 --> 00:09:28.921
And to be honest, almost all landing
pages have a pretty consistent and

145
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:30.831
similar layout to them.

146
00:09:30.831 --> 00:09:34.623
And that is basically what
I've been touching on and

147
00:09:34.623 --> 00:09:37.992
off through the whole
of the content section.

148
00:09:37.992 --> 00:09:43.370
So we begin with our summary, which
is our value proposition effectively.

149
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.365
Then we go into our benefits,
and then our features.

150
00:09:47.365 --> 00:09:52.510
But intermixed with that is calls
to action and social proof.

151
00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:54.652
So normally,
wherever I have a call to action,

152
00:09:54.652 --> 00:09:58.083
I normally associate a social proof
alongside it just to reassure people and

153
00:09:58.083 --> 00:10:00.194
to say, yes, you're doing the right thing.

154
00:10:00.194 --> 00:10:03.314
Look, these other people
have been doing it, too.

155
00:10:03.314 --> 00:10:07.632
And I tend to include that pretty near
the top, the call to action pretty near

156
00:10:07.632 --> 00:10:12.238
the top for returning users so that they
don't have to scroll away down the page.

157
00:10:12.238 --> 00:10:15.965
If it's a long page, I'll include
a call to action in the middle as well.

158
00:10:15.965 --> 00:10:19.819
And then at the end of the page,
I normally end with a call to action and

159
00:10:19.819 --> 00:10:21.762
associated social proof as well.

160
00:10:21.762 --> 00:10:23.895
And that way,
you're taking people on a journey.

161
00:10:23.895 --> 00:10:27.596
So you're answering the key questions that
come into their minds as they come in.

162
00:10:27.596 --> 00:10:31.957
So the first question when they land
on a site is what does this site do and

163
00:10:31.957 --> 00:10:33.853
what does it offer me, right?

164
00:10:33.853 --> 00:10:36.927
And that's what your value
proposition does, right?

165
00:10:36.927 --> 00:10:39.827
So I'm on the right site
is the first question.

166
00:10:39.827 --> 00:10:42.427
Does it offer the kind
of thing I wanna do?

167
00:10:42.427 --> 00:10:45.030
Value proposition, how does it help me?

168
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:48.350
That's where your benefits come in,
where you talk about benefits.

169
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.380
And then it's how do they
deliver on those benefits?

170
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.331
And that's where your features come in.

171
00:10:53.331 --> 00:10:58.396
And then obviously, your social proof is
just reassurance that goes alongside that.

172
00:10:58.396 --> 00:11:03.980
So the layout and the flow of your pages
is gonna be pretty consistently the same

173
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:09.490
for any kind of product page, landing
page, homepage, that kind of thing.

174
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.040
Then you can go with this formula and

175
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:17.565
be fairly confident you're gonna see
a reasonable conversion rate from it.

176
00:11:17.565 --> 00:11:22.670
It's not some artistic kind of black
box that just spews out websites.

177
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.390
There is process here that
you can follow through.

178
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:31.263
The other thing that you need to
consider as you create the flow of

179
00:11:31.263 --> 00:11:34.612
the page is the way that
people read as well.

180
00:11:34.612 --> 00:11:39.280
You need to be acutely aware
that in Western countries,

181
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:46.149
which use a Latin character set, we read
from left to right and from top to bottom.

182
00:11:46.149 --> 00:11:47.865
And presuming that's you,

183
00:11:47.865 --> 00:11:52.290
that has quite a fundamental
impact on how you design pages.

184
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:55.849
So for example, we tend to read
in what's called an F shape.

185
00:11:55.849 --> 00:12:00.114
So we scan across a line, and
then scan down the left-hand side a bit.

186
00:12:00.114 --> 00:12:04.894
And then scan across when something
else grabs our attention,

187
00:12:04.894 --> 00:12:08.062
and then down a bit and scan across again.

188
00:12:08.062 --> 00:12:12.098
And it's a very particular way of reading,
but what it means is that there

189
00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:16.150
are certain dead spots on the page
which don't tend to perform very well.

190
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:21.730
So the right-hand side, for example,
tends to not get a lot of attention to it.

191
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:25.672
Now, there are other factors that
influence this, but generally speaking,

192
00:12:25.672 --> 00:12:29.380
the right-hand side of a page won't
get as much attention as the left.

193
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:33.570
So you don't wanna put critical calls to
action on the right-hand side of the page.

194
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.505
Very simple rule that you can remember and

195
00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:38.239
implement as you go
about designing things.

196
00:12:38.239 --> 00:12:43.304
But the biggest thing, and
this goes back to the question we

197
00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:48.470
had earlier about long form pages,
is that you need to really

198
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:54.681
make your pages as scannable as
possible however long they are, right?

199
00:12:54.681 --> 00:12:59.322
So if they use content blocks,
that's quite a nice easy formula to use

200
00:12:59.322 --> 00:13:03.267
with a heading, a short description,
a link and an image.

201
00:13:03.267 --> 00:13:06.570
That's by its nature content
blocks are scannable.

202
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.118
But if it's a longer form piece,

203
00:13:09.118 --> 00:13:13.942
then you're gonna need to kind
of build that scannability in.

204
00:13:13.942 --> 00:13:16.214
So obviously, I have a blog.

205
00:13:16.214 --> 00:13:20.027
My blog has obviously
some quite long posts.

206
00:13:20.027 --> 00:13:23.620
But if you've noticed the way that
I've got this here on the page,

207
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.264
there's pull out quotes, there's headings.

208
00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:32.318
There's related links, there's
highlighted copy, bullet points, imagery,

209
00:13:32.318 --> 00:13:37.430
lots of things that essentially
enable someone to scan down the page.

210
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:42.184
Also look how I've included a lot
of spacing around elements to

211
00:13:42.184 --> 00:13:47.309
allow them to breathe, and so
that the eye isn't working too hard.

212
00:13:47.309 --> 00:13:50.859
The other thing is don't make
your line lengths too long,

213
00:13:50.859 --> 00:13:54.417
because the longer the line length,
the more eye strain.

214
00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:57.294
We've got move eyes more back and forth.

215
00:13:57.294 --> 00:14:02.144
There's a sweet spot of about 40 to
70 characters on a line which seems

216
00:14:02.144 --> 00:14:03.486
to work quite well.

217
00:14:03.486 --> 00:14:04.815
So break up content.

218
00:14:04.815 --> 00:14:08.852
Don't have big,
long paragraph after paragraph of text,

219
00:14:08.852 --> 00:14:11.365
cuz that people just won't read it.

220
00:14:11.365 --> 00:14:12.959
They won't look at it.

221
00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:18.463
So you have to support scannability
in the way that you design.

222
00:14:18.463 --> 00:14:21.934
So there are a lot of elements
to consider here, but

223
00:14:21.934 --> 00:14:26.150
you don't need the creative or
artistic gene for any of them.

224
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:31.046
The kind of stuff that we're talking about
here is just following a set of rules

225
00:14:31.046 --> 00:14:34.698
to make something simple and
clean and straightforward.

226
00:14:37.802 --> 00:14:42.798
Then we got to start talking maybe about
some of the more creative elements

227
00:14:42.798 --> 00:14:46.515
that you bring into,
things like imagery and shapes.

228
00:14:46.515 --> 00:14:51.503
You might wanna start introducing
imagery alongside the kind of layout

229
00:14:51.503 --> 00:14:55.002
that you've got to
represent different things.

230
00:14:55.002 --> 00:15:00.100
And generally speaking,
imagery is a more static decision, but

231
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:05.310
can be used to signal to an audience
that this site is for them.

232
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:08.731
It can be used to create
the right emotional feel over it,

233
00:15:08.731 --> 00:15:13.220
which may be a little bit woolly,
and we'll get onto in a minute.

234
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.750
But one other thing that imagery
does is it draws the eye.

235
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.358
It controls where people look.

236
00:15:19.358 --> 00:15:26.700
And you can actually use that factor
to guide people's eyes around the page.

237
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.742
We are kind of programmed
to pay particular attention

238
00:15:29.742 --> 00:15:33.265
to visual feedback and
visual imagery over things like text.

239
00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:35.747
And so it can be used to draw attention.

240
00:15:35.747 --> 00:15:39.844
So this mock-up that I've
produced is a great example.

241
00:15:39.844 --> 00:15:45.391
All of the imagery on this page or most
of the imagery on this page is designed

242
00:15:45.391 --> 00:15:50.820
to draw the user's attention to that
call to action button of Shop Now.

243
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.985
So everything from the imagery itself, but

244
00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:55.686
also the shapes that have
been added to the interface.

245
00:15:55.686 --> 00:15:57.953
Let me show you what I mean.

246
00:15:57.953 --> 00:15:59.474
So as you can see here,

247
00:15:59.474 --> 00:16:04.616
we've got this triangle that's been
created by the typography at the top.

248
00:16:04.616 --> 00:16:08.274
So it's narrowing down towards the button,
right?

249
00:16:08.274 --> 00:16:12.407
Then on top of that, you've got
the background image of this woman behind

250
00:16:12.407 --> 00:16:15.806
the button, which is positioned
right next to the button and

251
00:16:15.806 --> 00:16:17.756
drawing your attention that way.

252
00:16:17.756 --> 00:16:21.402
And you've even got the mountains
underneath that are pointing

253
00:16:21.402 --> 00:16:23.169
upwards back up to the button.

254
00:16:23.169 --> 00:16:27.982
But then after that, you've got this guy
in the left-hand corner whose eyeline,

255
00:16:27.982 --> 00:16:32.880
even though he's wearing a headset, his
eyeline is looking up towards the button.

256
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.410
And where someone's eyeline is
makes an enormous difference.

257
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.980
We follow people's eyelines.

258
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:43.189
Add to that, he's actually pointing at the
button with his, we'll say his left arm.

259
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:47.762
And then on the back of the woman's head,
she's actually got a triangle,

260
00:16:47.762 --> 00:16:50.678
which is pointing upwards
towards the button.

261
00:16:50.678 --> 00:16:54.143
So you can see how just by
the positioning of imagery,

262
00:16:54.143 --> 00:16:58.847
you can draw attention to anything
particular that you want on the page.

263
00:16:58.847 --> 00:17:03.086
To really drive that home,
let me show you eye tracking study and

264
00:17:03.086 --> 00:17:06.004
show you how big
a difference this can make.

265
00:17:06.004 --> 00:17:09.417
Here's a design using not
a very clever design.

266
00:17:09.417 --> 00:17:12.559
It's got a little bit of text on the left.

267
00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:16.520
It's got some copy written there,
and under that is a call to action.

268
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.301
And you can notice how all of
the attention on that page is drawn to

269
00:17:20.301 --> 00:17:21.498
the call to action.

270
00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:24.834
Now look what happens if I
just take this guy out and

271
00:17:24.834 --> 00:17:28.499
replace him with a slightly
different image, right?

272
00:17:28.499 --> 00:17:30.962
Look how suddenly everything changes.

273
00:17:30.962 --> 00:17:37.099
The attention is no longer on that button,
but it's instead on her face and cleavage.

274
00:17:37.099 --> 00:17:39.250
I won't even get into that conversation.

275
00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:40.822
It's a human characteristic.

276
00:17:40.822 --> 00:17:41.787
We can't help it.

277
00:17:41.787 --> 00:17:44.045
We're all the same.

278
00:17:44.045 --> 00:17:48.228
But that doesn't work as
an image because she is looking

279
00:17:48.228 --> 00:17:52.153
directly at the camera and
she's holding our gaze.

280
00:17:52.153 --> 00:17:56.411
And also, there's this line that's
going down between her arm and

281
00:17:56.411 --> 00:18:00.227
the background that's creating
a barrier between the two.

282
00:18:00.227 --> 00:18:03.951
So what's happening is somebody's
eyes are hitting this page,

283
00:18:03.951 --> 00:18:06.059
immediately jumping across to her.

284
00:18:06.059 --> 00:18:10.076
Because faces are more compelling and
hold our attention and

285
00:18:10.076 --> 00:18:13.315
never getting back over
to the left-hand side.

286
00:18:13.315 --> 00:18:16.483
Now when you compare that to
the original image, right,

287
00:18:16.483 --> 00:18:20.716
our eyes are still jumping directly
over to the guy on the right-hand side.

288
00:18:20.716 --> 00:18:25.754
But then we're following his eye and his
eyeline immediately back over to the left.

289
00:18:25.754 --> 00:18:31.214
So we don't miss that copy and
the call to action associated with it.

290
00:18:31.214 --> 00:18:34.945
So think about when you select an image,
are they looking into the page or

291
00:18:34.945 --> 00:18:35.812
out of the page?

292
00:18:35.812 --> 00:18:37.920
Are they looking towards
the call to action?

293
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.109
Are there visual indicators that are
pointing at critical pieces of content?

294
00:18:42.109 --> 00:18:46.901
Things like that will make an enormous
difference in terms of whether somebody

295
00:18:46.901 --> 00:18:51.563
spots your call to action or just scrolls
straight by it and doesn't see it.

296
00:18:51.563 --> 00:18:54.101
And the same is true with key content,
etc.

297
00:18:54.101 --> 00:19:00.120
So that's a little bit about how we can
draw people's attention around the page.
