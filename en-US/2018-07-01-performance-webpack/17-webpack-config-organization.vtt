00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.610
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: The reason why I spend
kind of early on starting from scratch

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.220
is that we've tried to
create this system that

3
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.050
allows you to not only have configurations
based on your environment, right?

4
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.730
Like that's literally
what this mode config is.

5
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.730
And so in your build-utils,
anything that's for production,

6
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.230
you're gonna have in production,
you put in this config.

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.790
Anything that's for

8
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.510
development, you're gonna have it
here like your dev environment.

9
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.630
Mode handles a lot of it so,

10
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.410
before webpack 4 these would be
much larger, but thankfully,

11
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.500
we're doing a huge amount of stuff under
the hood now for you automatically.

12
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.840
Now when it comes to these presets,

13
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.890
like this preset system that I was
showing kinda the last piece as

14
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.320
we were building out this configuration,
was it doesn't have to be just one plugin.

15
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.040
The point of presets is that you can add

16
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.030
isolated functionality that allows you
to experiment, test or for any reason,

17
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.820
right, that you can just add on with
a flag, or add on with an extra script.

18
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.310
So, I try and tell people in
a prescriptive manner, this is really,

19
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.870
this setup that I have here I've
used maybe hundreds of times.

20
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.480
And it's really easy for
anybody else to jump in and

21
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.790
see that it's pretty manageable, right?

22
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.510
And it's not too much complexity here.

23
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.610
I would say maybe the most
complexity is this tiny function,

24
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.570
which Is just flattening out presets and

25
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.560
making sure that if you don't pass
a preset it doesn't fail, right?

26
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.620
And so I missed that when we live
coded it yesterday but patched it.

27
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.180
Does that answer his question?

28
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.616
Or hopefully we'll find out.

29
00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:55.424
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: But like ideally, what I
always do in terms of best practice is

30
00:01:55.424 --> 00:02:00.660
don't hide your webpack config, keep it at
the top level of the root of your project.

31
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.970
I think that's super important because
web pack like sets the default context

32
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.650
as being like the root of your package,
right.

33
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.560
Or wherever the config is.

34
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.810
And so if I had to define the entry point
and it was nested in some folder like 13

35
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.140
folders deep, I would have to work my
way out to find that relative path.

36
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.050
So maybe the best-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's super, thanks a lot.

37
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.110
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: Yep, no problem.

38
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.922
I'd say the best,
if you're doing anything,

39
00:02:23.922 --> 00:02:26.563
just make sure you have your config
at the top level, no matter what.

40
00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:31.369
&gt;&gt; Sean Larkin: Because your no modules
are gonna be at the top level and

41
00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:35.016
that's what webpack expects to resolve
by default, is wherever it's at and

42
00:02:35.016 --> 00:02:38.080
then local to it,
it's gonna be no modules.

43
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.380
So, you'll have a lot easier time.

44
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.790
Or you'll find that if you move it around
a bunch, you're gonna fuss with your

45
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.950
configuration and your paths,
and that's gonna be more complex.
