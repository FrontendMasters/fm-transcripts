00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.910
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Why does nothing change?

2
00:00:03.198 --> 00:00:04.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: No re-render, right?

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.728
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I never hooked up,
I never subscribed to those.

4
00:00:08.728 --> 00:00:11.346
I never subscribed to the user changing,
right?

5
00:00:11.346 --> 00:00:13.930
So it is totally legitimate
that it doesn't change.

6
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.280
I can now change the display name but
I won't see it instantaneously.

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.550
Let's fix that.

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.622
We can go into that UserProvider.

9
00:00:24.622 --> 00:00:29.862
This is gonna get a little squirely
now it means that when we log in,

10
00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:31.370
if there is a user.

11
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.278
Well I totally want to go subscribe to
that user profile and update this provider

12
00:00:36.278 --> 00:00:40.780
state and when they log out,
I donâ€™t want to do that anymore, right?

13
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.910
So we're gonna subscribe
to our state change and

14
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.433
when that changes we're gonna then also
subscribe to a document, all right?

15
00:00:55.806 --> 00:01:02.472
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So here we can say,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Say if

16
00:01:02.472 --> 00:01:08.939
a user came in
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We're

17
00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.537
gonna update that last one anyway.

18
00:01:17.492 --> 00:01:23.640
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll go ahead and
we'll call this, this is called userAuth.

19
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.683
So if there is a userAuth.

20
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.205
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Then we'll go ahead and
we'll get that current user.

21
00:01:33.205 --> 00:01:38.140
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: What I might consider
doing is instead of turning the whole

22
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.299
document, this point, I'm just gonna
turn the reference out of here.

23
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.410
That feels like a better choice than I
possibly could have considered earlier.

24
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:57.687
So then to firebase and
I'm simply going to return the reference.

25
00:02:00.467 --> 00:02:03.632
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So this is just
gonna be the place in the database

26
00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:17.946
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Where this happens.

27
00:02:17.946 --> 00:02:23.371
All right, so what we'll do here.

28
00:02:25.884 --> 00:02:27.204
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This
could happen either way,

29
00:02:27.204 --> 00:02:29.800
we probably didn't need to make
that change but it's fine.

30
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.049
So we'll get the userRef in this case, and

31
00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:41.910
we'll say userRef,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: OnSnapshot.

32
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:42.913
So every time it changes,

33
00:02:55.103 --> 00:02:57.011
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll go ahead and,

34
00:03:01.618 --> 00:03:02.821
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll say that the user,

35
00:03:05.496 --> 00:03:07.113
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Snapshot.id or

36
00:03:07.113 --> 00:03:09.885
your id in this case, yeah.

37
00:03:17.465 --> 00:03:18.770
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Get
everything out of there

38
00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:26.203
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,

39
00:03:26.203 --> 00:03:31.610
let's start with that and
see how it goes for us.

40
00:03:40.227 --> 00:03:42.031
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Now whenever
anything changes in here,

41
00:03:43.425 --> 00:03:43.983
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You can

42
00:03:43.983 --> 00:03:48.300
see it's automatically changing in the UI.

43
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.228
Yeah, so let's really explain what just
happened there which is when the Auth

44
00:03:52.228 --> 00:03:53.130
changes.

45
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.020
If there is a user cool,
what we're gonna do

46
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.140
is we're gonna go subscribe to that
user to users profile document, right?

47
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.840
When we update this form,
it's changing that document, right?

48
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.260
So before, we were making all
these changes to the user.

49
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.700
We had to refresh to see them.

50
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.990
Now we don't have to do that anymore.

51
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.590
Now when the user logs in,
we find, okay, I know your UID.

52
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.860
If you don't have a document
I'm going to create you one.

53
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.197
If you do have a document,
I'm going to subscribe to it.

54
00:04:19.197 --> 00:04:21.047
And if you don't I'm gonna
make one then subscribe to it.

55
00:04:21.047 --> 00:04:26.660
And now any changes that happen to this
user are automatically reflected in my UI.

56
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.870
Bonus is writing that code was not the
most fun I've had all day, today, right.

57
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.080
I didn't enjoy that too much.

58
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.950
But because I have this abstraction
now of this user context

59
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:38.780
I don't have to write that again.

60
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.610
Anyone who needs a user I can
basically say, here have the user.

61
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.030
I've done all the hard work.

62
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.390
And it's a little bit of extra steps
of listen for the Auth change.

63
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.330
When the Auth changes,
go find the document,

64
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.160
with the document go listen the changes.

65
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.310
But that's not abstract it away.

66
00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.300
And I've created myself something really
useful that and the rest of my application

67
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.687
I can simply use that context and I don't
have to really worry about it again.

68
00:05:04.687 --> 00:05:08.635
We'll create one other component that
manages user state but good news,

69
00:05:08.635 --> 00:05:11.063
it's just gonna leverage this one, right?

70
00:05:11.063 --> 00:05:14.924
So that will also be really useful that
sometimes you have to write slightly

71
00:05:14.924 --> 00:05:15.794
squirely code.

72
00:05:15.794 --> 00:05:19.469
But when you have to write
really squirrelly code,

73
00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:22.800
if you can hide it in a box
somewhere [LAUGH], and

74
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.820
never look at it again,
that's usually for the better, right?

75
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.100
And should that squirrelly code
inevitably have bugs well,

76
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.580
you just fix it in that one place, right?

77
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.190
Versus, I think what I used to do is which
is spread my squirrely code throughout

78
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.030
the code base.

79
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.670
It's called job security,
worked out really great.

80
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.200
Worked out so
great they had to promote me.

81
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.700
That's fine.
