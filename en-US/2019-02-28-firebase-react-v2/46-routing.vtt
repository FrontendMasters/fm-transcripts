00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We went through all
that work of creating a user profile.

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.850
And right now it has that created at,
and that's it, right.

3
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.490
That user profile document.

4
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.370
What I would love to do is,
we change this in the dashboard, right.

5
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.640
We don't actually have a way to let
the user change their display name or

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.640
their profile picture.

7
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.360
And like we said before,
that user profile page can be used for

8
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.250
a whole bunch of stuff.

9
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.170
It can be used for
sorting literally anything we want.

10
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.490
It's just a NoSQL document.

11
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.680
You can tack on anything
you want on there.

12
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.100
So we give us a lot of
opportunities to expand stuff, but

13
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.870
we need a way to change that.

14
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.910
So what we're gonna do is we're
gonna implement React Radar

15
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.920
to give ourselves another
page that we can go to.

16
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.012
So, we can go visit user profile page
from there, we're gonna be able to update

17
00:00:48.012 --> 00:00:52.970
display name, and we're also gonna hook
into Firebase's storage system so that

18
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.210
we can actually allow the user to upload
a new photo and then use that instead.

19
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.120
So, when they upload a new photo,
what we'll do is we'll take that.

20
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.430
And then we'll replace the photo
URL on their user profile document.

21
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.630
And that's what we're using now.

22
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.820
We hydrated this lovely picture of
yours truly from the Google OAuth API.

23
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.890
The email sign ups didn't
have one of those, right?

24
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.890
So this'll give us the ability to upload,

25
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.570
which'll let us play with
another Fire-based API.

26
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.510
And then also change that
user profile document.

27
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.280
All right, so let's make a new file.

28
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.849
This one we'll call UserProfile.jsx.

29
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.020
We're gonna keep this one
pretty simple for right now.

30
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.858
We'll say class UserProfile

31
00:01:46.858 --> 00:01:51.065
extends Component.

32
00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:58.017
And I'll render, and let's just make sure
everything works so it'll return a div.

33
00:02:00.776 --> 00:02:05.112
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This is
totally a user profile page.

34
00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.027
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, and
then we will just export default.

35
00:02:15.576 --> 00:02:17.310
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That user profile.

36
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.070
All right, so
now we want to hook up React Router.

37
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.170
That is gonna be yet another
provider on this stack of providers.

38
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.810
It's gonna be great.

39
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.604
And we will
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Import

40
00:02:34.604 --> 00:02:35.739
BrowserRouter as Router.

41
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.811
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: From react-router-dom.

42
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:47.110
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, and
then we just stack another one on here.

43
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:49.470
It's fine.

44
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.180
Don't worry about it.

45
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.638
This isn't at all getting ridiculous.

46
00:02:56.968 --> 00:03:00.573
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, and now with
React Router basically allows the URL to

47
00:03:00.573 --> 00:03:03.240
control which components that we see.

48
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.190
That's all it really does.

49
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.360
And so here where we're showing posts,

50
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.513
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
bring in some useful helpers here.

51
00:03:12.513 --> 00:03:21.159
From React Router, we're gonna
import a switch, a route and a link.

52
00:03:26.391 --> 00:03:29.703
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And what we'll do
here is we will implement the switch.

53
00:03:32.455 --> 00:03:34.279
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
the switch is gonna look at the URL and

54
00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:35.839
then try to figure out what to do.

55
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.450
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If
the route is an exact match,

56
00:03:43.503 --> 00:03:44.884
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: To just the root path,

57
00:03:44.884 --> 00:03:46.567
show me those posts again.

58
00:03:53.394 --> 00:03:59.515
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Otherwise,
if the route is an exact path to

59
00:03:59.515 --> 00:04:06.887
/profile,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Show

60
00:04:06.887 --> 00:04:08.319
me that user profile page.

61
00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:18.169
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And one thing that
I'm just gonna do, for my own sanity,

62
00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.556
is I'm gonna put a link
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Which is the same

63
00:04:23.556 --> 00:04:30.707
thing as an a tag, but for
React Router, back to the main page and

64
00:04:30.707 --> 00:04:36.271
in that current user
component I'm going to say,

65
00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:43.840
hey, if you click on their name
it'll take us to that profile page.

66
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.095
So just so we can get back and forth.

67
00:04:55.359 --> 00:04:59.953
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool.

68
00:04:59.953 --> 00:05:03.272
Link.

69
00:05:03.272 --> 00:05:04.567
That'll go to profile.

70
00:05:09.447 --> 00:05:13.758
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, let's see if
any of that works, click on that, totally

71
00:05:13.758 --> 00:05:19.146
user profile page, click on the title,
we're totally going back to the main page.

72
00:05:19.146 --> 00:05:20.202
Very validating.

73
00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:26.070
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, we've made our
point, we can navigate back and forth.

74
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.430
And this is mostly because my UI
is getting a little busy here.

75
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.400
Give us a safe space to
do some extra stuff here.

76
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.550
Otherwise it would just be conditional
after conditional picking what components

77
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.261
to render,
nobody needs that in their life.
