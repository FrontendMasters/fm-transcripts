00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.760
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Now it is your turn.

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.003
What you're gonna do is we
have the ability to remove.

3
00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:18.406
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There are two
different ways to modify a reference,

4
00:00:18.406 --> 00:00:21.990
right, to modify a document.

5
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.140
One is set,
which kind of wipes it out completely and

6
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.150
also is useful if you know exactly
whether you want to create one.

7
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.190
But if you just want to update
a single property, right,

8
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.000
it won't wipe away the entire object,
the entire document.

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.660
You can basically go ahead and use update,
and update will basically take those

10
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.780
properties and those values and
merge them into the existing document.

11
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.762
So your job is, in our post component,
we wanna go ahead, and

12
00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:49.991
the same way that we have a remove,
we wanna go ahead for the star.

13
00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:52.190
And we can start by incrementing it.

14
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.410
One would argue, yes,
you can hit star multiple times and

15
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.740
keep going ahead and
star it a thousand times.

16
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.390
You know how in Medium,
you can hold the thing like for the claps?

17
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.311
Same basic concept here, but we wanna just
practice to being able to actually modify

18
00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:08.406
one, and seeing it in both places.

19
00:01:08.406 --> 00:01:09.360
So I will go ahead.
