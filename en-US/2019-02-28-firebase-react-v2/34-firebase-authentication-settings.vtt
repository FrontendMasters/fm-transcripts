&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The other thing you
can do is for stuff like email address

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.370
verification, you can actually customize
the emails or a password reset email,

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.740
and you can trigger a lot of that
stuff from the auth module as well.

4
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.930
And you can also effectively
get some data on your users.

5
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.420
One thing to keep in mind
is that out of the box,

6
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.660
I think it's down here, there are some
other settings that you can change.

7
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.770
Which is, what domains are the users
allowed to login from?

8
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.149
So this is, Firebase has a hosting service
that we'll play around with a little bit.

9
00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.445
So they can log in to the app either
from my official hosting service or

10
00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:44.020
from local hosts.

11
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.230
And you can add other ones if you need to.

12
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.790
One account per email address, so

13
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.090
that's why I made one of those
fake email addresses for

14
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.542
my email characters cuz I use both
of my real ones for the Google auth.

15
00:00:55.542 --> 00:00:57.854
And then the other one is,

16
00:00:57.854 --> 00:01:03.533
this is just kind of protection
which is from a given IP address,

17
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:08.489
100 sign ups per hour for
your application, right.

18
00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:13.161
So if someone isn't spamming you and
try to sign up for a bunch of accounts.

19
00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:17.696
So those are some of
the settings in there as well.

20
00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:20.234
But that is how we can implement.

21
00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:21.976
So we saw how to do an OAuth.

22
00:01:21.976 --> 00:01:26.242
OAuth might not work for you, so
we can also sign up with email and

23
00:01:26.242 --> 00:01:29.336
password and
stuff along those lines as well.

24
00:01:29.336 --> 00:01:30.650
But it's pretty straightforward.
