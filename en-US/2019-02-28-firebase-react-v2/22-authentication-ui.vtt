00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.160
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I probably wanna
keep track of the current user.

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.480
I'm gonna need that for
all sorts of things, right?

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.448
We saw that posts can be attributed to
a user if I go into the AddPost, or

4
00:00:10.448 --> 00:00:12.818
I think it's in posts, plural.

5
00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:22.183
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's in AddPost, right
now I have it hard coded in user, right?

6
00:00:22.183 --> 00:00:27.799
So we know that, on top of just being able
to get tokens for talking with a database,

7
00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:32.070
we also wanna hold on to this user
information and work with it.

8
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.400
So I'm probably going to want to keep
it in my application state as well, so

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.870
I can use it when I create new content.

10
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.822
But also, we're gonna get to the point
where, in this liveblogging app,

11
00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:43.140
anyone can make a post.

12
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.680
But right now,
anyone can delete anyone's post, right?

13
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.320
And so we'll eventually get to the point
where we have authentication rules, or

14
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.270
authorization rules,

15
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.340
in place that say, hey,
you can only delete your own posts, right?

16
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.323
Or only logged in users can go ahead and
make posts.

17
00:00:58.323 --> 00:01:02.972
Right now,
we have not wired in authentication yet.

18
00:01:02.972 --> 00:01:07.555
So it stands to reason that you don't
need to be authenticated to make a post,

19
00:01:07.555 --> 00:01:09.682
see also we've been making posts.

20
00:01:09.682 --> 00:01:14.792
So let's put a user in here as well.

21
00:01:18.773 --> 00:01:21.812
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll just store
it as null at this moment, we'll go and

22
00:01:21.812 --> 00:01:23.810
fetch one in a second.

23
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.390
And we'll begin to put in
the ability to log in.

24
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.410
Right now there are just posts, but
you can see I've got this SignInAndSignUp.

25
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.570
And I've also got this Authentication
one which basically says

26
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.230
either show me the CurrentUser or show me

27
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:50.740
the SignUpAndSignIn one, so
we'll start with that one.

28
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.833
And we'll go ahead and
put that in Application, and

29
00:01:53.833 --> 00:01:56.795
put it right below the heading and
above the post.

30
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.243
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll pull
the user off of state.

31
00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:13.478
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Now user is null, so
we should see those SignUpAndSignIn forms.

32
00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:21.467
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Index does not match
the corresponding name on disk during

33
00:02:21.467 --> 00:02:23.653
authentication, let's
go take a look there.

34
00:02:26.082 --> 00:02:28.976
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: React has a lowercase r,
all right.
