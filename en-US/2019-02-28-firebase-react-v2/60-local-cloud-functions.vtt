00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.550
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You can run them locally,
too.

2
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.940
The local ones only work for
the HTTP ones.

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.680
Let's give that a shot.

4
00:00:08.142 --> 00:00:14.476
So we'll do firebase serve,
think doing some memory.

5
00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:24.910
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
this is a series of lies, right here.

6
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.190
Because we're clearly running no date.

7
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.420
But it's tell me that you're running
nine and they're running six.

8
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.589
[LAUGH] Yeah,
I can use something like MVM.

9
00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:38.411
And so here, these are now
local endpoints that I can use,

10
00:00:38.411 --> 00:00:43.310
so,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Same basic idea.

11
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.168
It's still hooked up the same Firestore,
it's not a local Firestore.

12
00:00:46.168 --> 00:00:51.000
It's running on my computer rather
than Google's computers, right?

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.280
So the HTTPS ones, you can test
them locally, and that's great.

14
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.030
Here's the Hello World one,
so on and so forth.

15
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.320
So this is server-side code that we can
deploy that can hook into our entire

16
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.470
Firebase infrastructure.
