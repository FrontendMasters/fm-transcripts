00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.110
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
let's talk a little bit about Firebase.

2
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.923
As I mentioned,
this is version two of the course.

3
00:00:05.923 --> 00:00:09.990
And in the year and
a half since we did this last time,

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.603
Firebase released
an entirely new database.

5
00:00:13.603 --> 00:00:16.483
So [LAUGH] a lot has actually changed,
and also,

6
00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:19.437
React has changed a lot in that time too,
right?

7
00:00:19.437 --> 00:00:23.750
We have a new context API, all sorts of
new ways for dealing with state as well.

8
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.633
So there's a lot of kind of new and

9
00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:28.203
interesting ways in
which the two interact.

10
00:00:28.203 --> 00:00:29.579
So we'll talk a little bit.

11
00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.992
We're going to build
a application using Firebase and

12
00:00:32.992 --> 00:00:37.901
React from the ground up, with a kind of
very close to a create React app basis.

13
00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:40.804
And then start to bring in various
different Firebase features.

14
00:00:40.804 --> 00:00:45.090
We're going to bring in authentication,
right?

15
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.480
If you've ever tried to wire up oauth
yourself, one, I'm sorry, and two, you're

16
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.830
gonna be a little both elated and sad when
you see how easy it is with Firebase.

17
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.068
We're going to use Firebase's
brand new Cloud Firestore,

18
00:01:03.068 --> 00:01:08.451
which is their fancy new database
that is a lot easier to work with and

19
00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:10.166
a lot more scalable.

20
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.870
And it's really kind of exciting.

21
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.280
We'll play around with storage for
storing images and

22
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.200
any other kind of files
that we wanna store.

23
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.752
We'll upload those through
our React app as well.

24
00:01:19.752 --> 00:01:22.212
And then we'll also write cloud functions.

25
00:01:22.212 --> 00:01:26.482
There's a lot of stuff, like Firebase,
we think about it a lot as,

26
00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:30.370
it's totally for a front end to
talk to a back end system, right?

27
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.540
But actually we can write back
end code with Firebase too.

28
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.944
And we're going to need to for
a lot of things.

29
00:01:33.944 --> 00:01:37.289
There's a lot of things you don't
wanna necessarily do on the client so

30
00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.533
it's awesome to be able
to make API end points.

31
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:42.578
Or say, hey, when this data change,
then I want to go ahead and

32
00:01:42.578 --> 00:01:44.653
trigger all these other actions, right?

33
00:01:44.653 --> 00:01:46.910
So you can do a whole bunch
of stuff in the background.

34
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.530
If you've ever played with AWS Lambdas or
anything along those lines,

35
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.690
it's very similar to that.

36
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.520
Based on events that happen
in your application,

37
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.300
you can trigger other things
that go on and happen as well.

38
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.052
Right, so be able to update data,
change stuff as other things change, and

39
00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.050
it'll be really interesting.

40
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.310
And for me, this is also very compelling,
because one

41
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.350
of my hobby horses is this argument that

42
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.290
we don't tend to think about modern
client-side applications in the same

43
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.920
way that we think about stuff like
an iOS or an Android application.

44
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.732
Your modern day true web application
is very much like a mobile application.

45
00:02:26.732 --> 00:02:30.857
Right, it was one of those boiling a frog
things where it went from, okay yeah,

46
00:02:30.857 --> 00:02:33.276
I'm gonna do some form
validation in jquery.

47
00:02:33.276 --> 00:02:36.676
To, I'm going to ship a giant
of bundle of JavaScript, and

48
00:02:36.676 --> 00:02:41.660
an index.html file with a single div on
it and build the entire thing in there.

49
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.460
And have it work offline, and
stuff along those lines, right?

50
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.580
So it's really interesting to use
the same kind of tools, like Firebase,

51
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.880
we're gonna use it with React today.

52
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.850
But Firebase also supports iOS and
Android as well, right?

53
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.980
So kind of thinking in that
paradigm of building, in our case,

54
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.360
both desktop and mobile applications,
cuz that's the beauty of the web.

55
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.960
We can start to think about it in
the same way that we think about building

56
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.340
native mobile applications,
they're using some of the same frameworks.

57
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.931
Again, we are doing this in JavaScript and
React, but the Firebase concepts,

58
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:18.356
theoretically, should you choose
to pick up Swift or Kotlin or

59
00:03:18.356 --> 00:03:23.220
Java to do Android development,
the concepts still apply, right?

60
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.690
Theoretically, some of these concepts
will still apply to React Native as well.
