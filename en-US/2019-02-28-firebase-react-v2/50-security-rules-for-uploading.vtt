00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:07.197
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so we've got
the ability to upload a file in place.

2
00:00:07.197 --> 00:00:08.207
This is gonna blow up.

3
00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:11.570
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Anyone wanna
guess why it's gonna blow up?

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.830
&gt;&gt; Student: Image types,
I mean file types, wrong file.

5
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.740
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I mean,
that's also a reason they could blow up.

6
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.570
I mean, you can put whatever
you want in the bucket.

7
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.840
Whether or not it renders as
an image is a different story.

8
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.309
You put whatever you want in the bucket.

9
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.460
Security rules, right?

10
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.490
This is like, there's also,
you can imagine what happened if

11
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.630
we just let anyone upload anything,
right, anywhere, right?

12
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.420
So we'll just do some really
basic security rules here.

13
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.590
I'll take that for
a spin, so go to storage.

14
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.540
We'll get started.

15
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.380
This is the kind of default
rule that I want to give you.

16
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.992
All right, let's read this rule together.

17
00:00:52.992 --> 00:00:58.200
All passes like document before,
it's basically they can read or

18
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.860
write anywhere as long
as they're logged in.

19
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.390
Better than the test one that we did for
FireStore, but not great.

20
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.430
So let's go ahead and
let's make that a little bit better.

21
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.592
And we'll say, no, you can't do anything

22
00:01:17.592 --> 00:01:26.394
unless it's to user-profiles/,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

23
00:01:26.394 --> 00:01:28.373
we'll look at a userId in there.

24
00:01:30.303 --> 00:01:37.477
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And then for a photo URL,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

25
00:01:37.477 --> 00:01:46.030
we'll say, we'll allow,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: read, anyone can read it.

26
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.594
And we'll allow write if the request,

27
00:01:56.701 --> 00:02:00.910
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: auth.uid == user ID.

28
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.850
So you can write to that bucket.

29
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.830
You can write to that folder
if it is your folder.

30
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.760
Anyone can read from it.

31
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.670
Only the user can put a file there.

32
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.008
Otherwise, I can go find any
of your profile things and

33
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:16.700
upload some stuff there and
make it all weird.

34
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.764
Fortunately, the only picture I have
is of myself that's already there, so

35
00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:20.480
that's not fun.
