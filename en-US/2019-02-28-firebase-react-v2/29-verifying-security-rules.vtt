00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.490
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's modify
that add post for a second.

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.180
And what we'll do,
we're gonna change this in a little bit,

3
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:17.020
but we'll say uid, displayName and email.

4
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.298
And photoURL, we're not using all those,
but Say auth,

5
00:00:26.304 --> 00:00:29.449
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: .currentUser.

6
00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.780
All right, so that's that same
user that when we logged in,

7
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.520
we logged into the console that
had all that other stuff on it.

8
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.250
We have access to that user off
the auth object if they are logged in.

9
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.908
So in the event that they're not
trying to de-structure that object,

10
00:00:42.908 --> 00:00:45.274
it's gonna blow up, so
I'll just start with an empty object.

11
00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:52.528
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And now basically,
let's actually do this.

12
00:00:57.867 --> 00:01:00.219
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So now this will be
the current user when we go ahead and

13
00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.639
make a few,
unless I've made some terrible mistake.

14
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.113
So let's sign in.

15
00:01:20.144 --> 00:01:22.858
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, I'll make one more.

16
00:01:30.568 --> 00:01:40.110
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, we'll look
back at the database, do a quick refresh.

17
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.349
We should see our two documents.

18
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.835
There they are, and
now you can see there is my uid and

19
00:01:47.835 --> 00:01:50.900
the actual correct user information.

20
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.760
So I can go ahead,
I'm gonna delete this one.

21
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.510
It's gone, then I sign out, shouldn't be
able to read anything while signed out.

22
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.588
Cool, that didn't work.

23
00:02:00.588 --> 00:02:05.613
And I'm gonna sign in again,
different Google account.

24
00:02:09.735 --> 00:02:14.880
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Still can't delete it,
right?

25
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.340
The snapshots does try to do
the optimistic update, so

26
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.900
you see it vanish for a second.

27
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.970
And then when it doesn't work out,
it puts it right back where it was.

28
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.605
But it never actually leaves the database,
which is the important part.

29
00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:30.377
Now, if we were better front end engineers
we wouldn't show a delete button in

30
00:02:30.377 --> 00:02:31.474
the event [LAUGH].

31
00:02:31.474 --> 00:02:34.428
So that flash is not
necessarily as big of a deal,

32
00:02:34.428 --> 00:02:38.540
cuz we wouldn't let them see the button,
and stuff like that.

33
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.170
But it does give us a way to at least
protect the integrity of our data.

34
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.620
Right, cuz trying to do everything client
side is not a secure way to go about it.

35
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.570
All they have to do is open
up the developer tools and

36
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.230
they have all your hacks, right?

37
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.010
So this gives you a way
to insure your data.
