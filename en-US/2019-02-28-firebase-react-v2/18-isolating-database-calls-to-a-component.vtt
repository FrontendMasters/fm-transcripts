00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.140
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We have a little extra
bonus code here that we don't need,

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.430
which is that we are still
adding it to state manually.

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.524
And removing it from State manually,
whenever we add and

4
00:00:12.524 --> 00:00:17.660
remove posts and now we can just delete
all that code that we just wrote.

5
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.280
Now you might say well why
wouldn't I always want this?

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.700
It all really depends, right,

7
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.030
if this is, it could be that you might
only want to fetch this data once.

8
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.920
You might not want to necessarily
subscribe to every change,

9
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.910
like those queries.

10
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.740
You might choose to just fetch it once and
have it and store it,

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.910
it all depends on your use case.

12
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.510
I would say subscribing to this is fine,

13
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.667
because things can come
in basically streaming.

14
00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:47.580
It does provide some state management
challenges that we'll face later, but

15
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.960
it's really up to you, all right?

16
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.390
If you don't necessarily want to fetch the
data all the time, you can fetch it once.

17
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.990
You can subscribe to the changes,

18
00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.240
either one of them Firebase allows you
to do both which is pretty awesome.

19
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.150
So let's go ahead and delete some code.

20
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.788
So the first thing is in handleCreate and
get rid of this, I don't need

21
00:01:10.788 --> 00:01:15.794
the reference to the documents
since I'm replacing all the State.

22
00:01:15.794 --> 00:01:20.592
I don't need to format that,
I don't need to set state anymore,

23
00:01:20.592 --> 00:01:24.894
I can basically
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Slim it down

24
00:01:24.894 --> 00:01:28.971
to a one-liner, which is take the post,
add the post to firestore.

25
00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:34.921
Firestore will then eventually,
the subscription will update stuff,

26
00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:36.584
handleRemove again

27
00:01:45.491 --> 00:01:48.990
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That's really all that
needs to happen, is change the data store.

28
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.190
The data store will tell the Application
that everything has changed,

29
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.130
and it should all work.

30
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.368
We have more code to remove, but

31
00:01:59.368 --> 00:02:04.994
let's start with this right now.

32
00:02:08.473 --> 00:02:13.710
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, adding works,
removing works still for both of them.

33
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.470
The nice thing now, too, is theoretically,

34
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.910
we don't need to communicate this all the
way back up to the Application components.

35
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.489
Before, because the Application
component held on to the State and

36
00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.142
we had to modify it in
the Application component.

37
00:02:30.142 --> 00:02:34.489
We basically passed those functions
down to addPost into the post itself to

38
00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.183
remove it.

39
00:02:35.183 --> 00:02:39.320
And then let it call back up to
modify the Application state.

40
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.200
But now because Firebase is in control
of it, we don't need to do that anymore.

41
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.700
So we can probably even get rid of
these two methods completely and

42
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.770
just put them where we need them.

43
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.301
So let's go ahead and
do that, so for instance,

44
00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:57.745
we can take this Functionality right here,
we can go into the Post itself.

45
00:02:59.594 --> 00:03:07.887
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we can say
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm gonna go ahead and

46
00:03:07.887 --> 00:03:14.895
make a postRef because I know that the
next thing we're gonna do is an update.

47
00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:18.590
Where I'm gonna wanna change
the number of stars on one as well.

48
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.399
So what I'm going to do is I'm
gonna hold on to that reference so

49
00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:22.832
I don't need to write it twice.

50
00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:31.112
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Nope.

51
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.184
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we'll have the PostRef
and then we'll have const remove.

52
00:03:45.542 --> 00:03:51.611
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That'll
just be postRef.delete.

53
00:03:56.983 --> 00:03:58.820
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
instead of this down here.

54
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.630
We'll simply say onClick, just remove it,

55
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.610
this Star button I'm about to let
you implement update in a second.

56
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.054
So just to point it out star's right here,
so

57
00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:19.233
we have the ability to remove we
don't need that onRemove anymore.

58
00:04:23.892 --> 00:04:25.594
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Which means
we don't need it here as well.

59
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.038
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We actually
don't even need onCreate anymore,

60
00:04:34.038 --> 00:04:37.035
because we can actually go
into the AddPost itself.

61
00:04:43.041 --> 00:04:45.150
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Instead of calling
onCreate, we can say firestore.

62
00:04:48.267 --> 00:04:50.060
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's see that
I imported the right one, yeah.

63
00:05:00.697 --> 00:05:02.807
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Just add it right here,

64
00:05:02.807 --> 00:05:06.825
you don't need to pass
an onCreate anymore.

65
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:12.683
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Which means
I can remove these two.

66
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.760
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Remove these two methods.

67
00:05:21.373 --> 00:05:25.168
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Awesome,
I deleted a lot of code, so

68
00:05:25.168 --> 00:05:28.846
let's go verify that things work.

69
00:05:31.922 --> 00:05:35.550
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: They show up on both,
I can delete them on both, right, so

70
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.970
it's a lot less code.

71
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.761
Once we can just use Firebase,
modify the database, and

72
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:43.380
have Firebase tell the Application
component what's going on, right?

73
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.135
So we're still passing the data down, but

74
00:05:45.135 --> 00:05:48.273
now because we don't need to necessarily
need to pass every function down.

75
00:05:48.273 --> 00:05:50.850
And we'll see other ways that we can
actually make this really useful as well

76
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.720
because we're still
passing the data through.

77
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.650
By the end of this workshop,
we're gonna have some strategies for

78
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.700
creating providers in context
in higher order components.

79
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.140
So we don't even necessarily
need to do that, but

80
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.240
right now we can at least
have the actions in place.
