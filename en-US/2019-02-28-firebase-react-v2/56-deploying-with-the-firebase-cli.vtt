00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.221
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
let's put this thing on the Internet.

2
00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:05.378
So there are also these
things called firebase-tools,

3
00:00:05.378 --> 00:00:08.543
that's the fire base CLI,
I talked it a lot a little bit.

4
00:00:08.543 --> 00:00:12.897
Which is the ability, there's the Firebase
CLI, which allows you to manage a whole

5
00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:17.090
bunch of stuff that we've been doing in
the dashboard locally, in your system.

6
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.573
And then there's firebase-admin,

7
00:00:18.573 --> 00:00:20.666
which gives you some of
the dashboard power, right?

8
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:23.840
The dashboard didn't believe
in any security rules,

9
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.462
we do whatever we want in there,
it's fine.

10
00:00:26.462 --> 00:00:30.809
So these tools allow you to do
it programmatically, as well.

11
00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:35.661
So I have it installed, but
otherwise, if you don't,

12
00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:42.080
you can do npm install -g firebase-tools,
and then firebase-admin.

13
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.257
And those will get you the, firebase-tools
is the CLI binary, firebase-admin

14
00:00:47.257 --> 00:00:51.771
is just a library that you can use,
but I have those installed already.

15
00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:56.591
If you have not done it before,
you do a firebase login, which,

16
00:00:56.591 --> 00:00:58.477
I'm already logged in.

17
00:00:58.477 --> 00:01:01.584
It's actually pretty neat, it'll open up
your browser, and then let you OAuth in,

18
00:01:01.584 --> 00:01:03.151
and then send you back
to the command line.

19
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:08.362
Which I didn't know was a thing
you could do, so that's neat.

20
00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:10.859
And then if you're in a project,

21
00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:15.953
this is just our create-react-app project,
I do firebase init.

22
00:01:15.953 --> 00:01:20.095
That used to be fire emoji,
I don't know why they changed it,

23
00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:24.172
I think they should put it back,
but it used to be fire emoji.

24
00:01:24.172 --> 00:01:25.222
And you can see,

25
00:01:25.222 --> 00:01:30.032
we've got this useful text-based
interface of what things we're using.

26
00:01:30.032 --> 00:01:32.220
Now you're like,
I'm already using Firestore!

27
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.904
What this will do is, it will actually
copy those rules from the console,

28
00:01:36.904 --> 00:01:38.957
into a firestoreRules.json.

29
00:01:38.957 --> 00:01:42.015
And so now, you can pull them down, and

30
00:01:42.015 --> 00:01:46.180
edit them on your machine,
and push them back up.

31
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.863
There's actually also a tool for
running unit tests against them, right?

32
00:01:51.863 --> 00:01:53.154
So you can pull it down,

33
00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:56.522
there's an emulator that will
emulate a Firebase database.

34
00:01:56.522 --> 00:02:01.116
And let you set the security rules, write
unit tests, based on what you can and

35
00:02:01.116 --> 00:02:04.608
can't do in your firebase account,
which is really cool.

36
00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:07.429
Functions, which are those cloud
functions, we'll turn that on.

37
00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.827
Hosting and Storage, Storage is the same
thing, it's just gonna put on the rules.

38
00:02:10.827 --> 00:02:14.573
It's not gonna store stuff on your
computer, it's just gonna pull down those

39
00:02:14.573 --> 00:02:17.421
rules, so you can edit them,
and you can push them back up.

40
00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:20.857
So you can check them into version
control, and do whatever you want,

41
00:02:20.857 --> 00:02:21.564
in that case.

42
00:02:21.564 --> 00:02:26.007
So I'm gonna pull down all four, I'm not
gonna pull down the real-time database,

43
00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:26.884
which project,

44
00:02:26.884 --> 00:02:32.463
I think I'm on this one now,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: What should we use for

45
00:02:32.463 --> 00:02:37.703
the rules, cool, yeah,
that seems fine, firestore.rules.

46
00:02:37.703 --> 00:02:42.243
The indexes, we didn't do really any
super-advanced queries, but Firebase will,

47
00:02:42.243 --> 00:02:45.180
they index, by default,
every property on an object.

48
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.265
But there's also things
called compound indexes,

49
00:02:48.265 --> 00:02:51.922
where if you're trying to do multiple,
they're not joins.

50
00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:55.553
But if you think about joins,
you can create compound indexes,

51
00:02:55.553 --> 00:02:59.601
that Firebase will make those fast,
so this will let you change those.

52
00:02:59.601 --> 00:03:02.833
For your cloud functions,
do you wanna do JavaScript or TypeScript?

53
00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:05.156
I like TypeScript, but
we're gonna do JavaScript.

54
00:03:05.156 --> 00:03:07.735
Do you want ESLint to catch probable bugs?

55
00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:11.683
At the,
whatever the Firebase summit thing is,

56
00:03:11.683 --> 00:03:15.737
they're all really into ESLint and
TypeScript.

57
00:03:17.058 --> 00:03:19.557
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, and so
it wrote these two things,

58
00:03:19.557 --> 00:03:22.653
shall I install the dependencies now,
go for it.

59
00:03:22.653 --> 00:03:25.023
That's gonna install all
of the dependencies for us,

60
00:03:25.023 --> 00:03:27.504
it's gonna create a folder for
our firebase functions.

61
00:03:27.504 --> 00:03:31.759
It's going to set it up, so
we can do a Firebase deploy, and

62
00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:37.548
deploy to an HTTPS server, that we can
just put it in the Internet really easily,

63
00:03:37.548 --> 00:03:40.380
whole bunch of some pretty cool stuff.

64
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.804
Like that, you can see,
it wrote the functions/package.json,

65
00:03:42.804 --> 00:03:45.882
that's what's installing right now,
because these are server-side functions.

66
00:03:45.882 --> 00:03:49.280
They are separate from the package-json
from our client-side code, so

67
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.773
that'll be a separate folder.

68
00:03:50.773 --> 00:03:54.602
That will make the git tool in
Visual Studio Code very angry with me,

69
00:03:54.602 --> 00:03:59.114
cuz those node modules are not currently
in gitignore, which is really great.

70
00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:01.023
This is the one we have
to pay attention to.

71
00:04:01.023 --> 00:04:03.162
It's trying to guess what
the public directory is,

72
00:04:03.162 --> 00:04:06.623
what we're going to use the server page
out of, you're like, yeah, public, no.

73
00:04:06.623 --> 00:04:11.318
If we remember create-react-app, when we
do npm-build, makes a build directory.

74
00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:14.704
And the build directory is what we
wanna push up to the Internet, so

75
00:04:14.704 --> 00:04:15.680
we'll say build.

76
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.334
This one is also important, configure
as a single-page app, which means,

77
00:04:20.334 --> 00:04:22.590
rewrite all URLs to /index.html.

78
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.331
We want that, right,
that's what lets react-router do its work.

79
00:04:26.331 --> 00:04:30.142
Everything goes into /index.html,
react-router does its thing, and

80
00:04:30.142 --> 00:04:31.600
figures out the rest for us.

81
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.085
So we want a yes,
don't just blindly hit Enter to that one,

82
00:04:36.085 --> 00:04:38.258
yeah, don't override it.

83
00:04:38.258 --> 00:04:44.170
We're gonna build anyway,
Storage Rules can go there.

84
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:51.473
And just before, we'll just do,
the code gets angry with me, we'll say,

85
00:04:57.861 --> 00:05:00.012
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, so let's see,

86
00:05:00.012 --> 00:05:06.477
we got some new stuff in here,
we got this new functions directory.

87
00:05:06.477 --> 00:05:10.187
We've got firebase.json which is just some
basic settings, so if you messed up and

88
00:05:10.187 --> 00:05:12.603
did public,
you can just change it here, it's fine.

89
00:05:12.603 --> 00:05:14.903
Indexes, we're not really
doing anything with.

90
00:05:14.903 --> 00:05:20.489
The rules, remember those,
they're down on my file system now,

91
00:05:20.489 --> 00:05:25.896
same with the storage.rules,
they are also down here as well.

92
00:05:25.896 --> 00:05:31.655
Maybe we didn't save them last time, but
everything is down on my system now.

93
00:05:31.655 --> 00:05:35.433
Other stuff like that, which is what
project it is, and so on and so forth.

94
00:05:35.433 --> 00:05:41.373
So what we'll do is,
let's go to package.json, and

95
00:05:41.373 --> 00:05:47.056
we're gonna make one new
script ,which is deploy,

96
00:05:47.056 --> 00:05:50.301
which will be a npm run build.

97
00:05:50.301 --> 00:05:55.622
And then if that is successful,
then we'll do a firebase deploy.

98
00:05:55.622 --> 00:06:02.798
firebase deploy will deploy your app, your
cloud functions, and your rules, right?

99
00:06:02.798 --> 00:06:06.863
You could actually do a dash-dash only,
and do some subset of those, if you want.

100
00:06:06.863 --> 00:06:09.939
But in this case, we're gonna treat
a deploy as, launch all the ships.

101
00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:17.131
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Do an npm run deploy, so

102
00:06:17.131 --> 00:06:19.963
that will first call
create-react-app's build.

103
00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:24.552
Which will go ahead and webpack all
the things, and do my production build.

104
00:06:24.552 --> 00:06:28.213
And when that is successful,
then we will call firebase deploy.

105
00:06:28.213 --> 00:06:31.488
And it will push that up to the cloud,

106
00:06:31.488 --> 00:06:35.722
which is also just
somebody else's computer.

107
00:06:35.722 --> 00:06:39.619
While that happens,
I'm gonna go over to the dashboard here,

108
00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:41.467
we can take a look at Hosting.

109
00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:48.522
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's telling us about all
the stuff we just did, that's very cool.

110
00:06:48.522 --> 00:06:53.633
You can, if you don't like,
whatever it is-.firebaseapp.com,

111
00:06:53.633 --> 00:06:56.414
you can set up your own custom domain.

112
00:06:56.414 --> 00:06:59.877
What is gonna be really cool,
when this shows up is,

113
00:06:59.877 --> 00:07:03.362
every deploy that you have
done will be listed here.

114
00:07:03.362 --> 00:07:08.238
And you can go back, if you botch it,
you can hit roll back, and

115
00:07:08.238 --> 00:07:12.747
you can switch back to a previous deploy,
really easily.

116
00:07:12.747 --> 00:07:17.915
You could also get some amount
of very base-level usage stats.

117
00:07:17.915 --> 00:07:21.165
But the ability, you could see,
here's the current one,

118
00:07:21.165 --> 00:07:23.382
it's not deployed yet, but it will be.

119
00:07:23.382 --> 00:07:26.694
I can actually, as I deploy over,
and over, and over again,

120
00:07:26.694 --> 00:07:28.366
go back to previous versions.

121
00:07:28.366 --> 00:07:31.104
So this works really great as
a continuous deployment thing, as well,

122
00:07:31.104 --> 00:07:33.541
you can hook it up into like Travis CI,
or something like that.

123
00:07:33.541 --> 00:07:37.853
So hey, I pushed the master, run it and
build it, and if it doesn't work,

124
00:07:37.853 --> 00:07:41.767
we could just roll back to a previous
version, which is super cool.

125
00:07:41.767 --> 00:07:43.763
So yeah, here is the current version,
you can see who did it.

126
00:07:43.763 --> 00:07:46.791
So you can also figure out,
where I work, we're very much into,

127
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:48.735
who is to blame for a given thing, right?

128
00:07:48.735 --> 00:07:52.491
Cuz once you can figure out who to blame,
you can move faster, right?

129
00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:57.255
Here, I am to blame for
this deploy, all right,

130
00:07:57.255 --> 00:08:01.916
cool, so that is the long and
short of Hosting.

131
00:08:01.916 --> 00:08:08.487
You basically install the firebase-tools,
you do firebase deploy,

132
00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:13.536
here on the internet,
don't believe me, here it is.

133
00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:18.826
And this one, theoretically,
you could all just log into,

134
00:08:18.826 --> 00:08:23.611
and be hot messes with, and
run on my API keys, [LAUGH].

135
00:08:23.611 --> 00:08:27.411
But I think, without access to the code
in this one, I'm a little safer.

136
00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:30.570
But this is it, in production,
on the Internet, under HTTPS.
