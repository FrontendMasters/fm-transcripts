00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.190
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's talk a little
bit about the new database in Firebase.

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.870
And it's called Cloud Firestore, and

3
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.390
the previous one was called
the Realtime Database.

4
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.230
And there are some kind of
interesting differences,

5
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.300
just because the old one is called
the Realtime Database does not mean that

6
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.440
Cloud Firestore does not support
realtime updates as well.

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.880
And this is really cool, because it means
that you can change your database, and

8
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.700
instantly, events are pushed to
all connected clients, right?

9
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.711
Which means you don't
necessarily have to fetch

10
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:35.022
with Ajax every 30 seconds to poll for
new changes.

11
00:00:35.022 --> 00:00:37.778
As soon as something changes in
either one of these databases,

12
00:00:37.778 --> 00:00:40.490
then you can actually have your
front end respond as well.

13
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.670
Which is really great for a whole class
of applications that would otherwise be

14
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.560
difficult or involve web sockets or
something along those lines, like building

15
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.746
a chatroom application, or anything
along those lines, or a live news feed.

16
00:00:50.746 --> 00:00:53.420
Well, we're gonna build a live
blogging platform today,

17
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.046
where once we push it out live, we'll all
be able to work on it at the same time,

18
00:00:57.046 --> 00:00:59.680
and see all the updates get pushed,
so on and so forth.

19
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.900
It will be really cool.

20
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.020
Generally speaking,
Cloud Firestore is in beta.

21
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.163
However, when we go to
build our application and

22
00:01:11.163 --> 00:01:16.146
you have to pick a database, we're gonna
see that there's a giant banner for

23
00:01:16.146 --> 00:01:18.690
Cloud Firestore that has Get Started.

24
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.864
And if you scroll down a lot,
you can find a much smaller button for

25
00:01:21.864 --> 00:01:23.090
Realtime Database.

26
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.887
So while it is in beta, it is absolutely
the one that Google and/or Firebase is

27
00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:31.100
pushing at this point,
and definitely the future.

28
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.800
This is the company that had Gmail in
beta for ten years, so it's a thing.

29
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.190
They do have slightly
different cost models.

30
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.850
We're gonna be talking about
the cost model, and for

31
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.270
the most part,
Cloud Firestore is very cheap.

32
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.270
It'll take some work to really
get yourself a nice bill.

33
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.080
And you can set up billing alerts and
stuff like that.

34
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.660
The one thing where you might wanna
consider the Realtime Database is if you

35
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.870
are querying and reading and

36
00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.540
writing to the database a lot,
it might technically be cheaper.

37
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.070
Cloud Firestore will almost always
be cheaper in every other case,

38
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.110
other than a lot of queries and
reads and writes.

39
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.089
And we're talking about,
I wanna make a live drawing application

40
00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:13.727
where every stroke of the brush, or mouse
or pen, in this case, pushes an update to

41
00:02:13.727 --> 00:02:18.396
the database, not chatroom-level
application, or blog-level application.

42
00:02:18.396 --> 00:02:22.820
We're talking severe amounts of reads and
writes.

43
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.630
The cost difference might be different,
otherwise, Cloud Firestore, at this point,

44
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.520
is the kind of recommended
way to go about doing it,
