00:00:00.716 --> 00:00:04.150
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
now that we figured out how to add a post,

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.790
we're going to need to figure
out how to remove a post.

3
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.324
Otherwise this database is just
going to grow and grow and grow.

4
00:00:10.324 --> 00:00:14.010
So, we're going to do
the traditional React way.

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.016
Right now, we are still doing the very
first React application, right.

6
00:00:18.016 --> 00:00:20.849
Put everything in the application state.

7
00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.210
Pass all the props down and find the
thing, and then pass everything back up.

8
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.200
And if you've ever developed like a large
enough React application you know that

9
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.810
that gets very tedious very quickly, and
also does have some performance issues

10
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.760
which is, that re-renders every
component on the way down.

11
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.960
So changing stuff, so on and so forth.

12
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.540
Right?

13
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.710
So we'll figure out better
ways to do that, but

14
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.350
first let's indulge in
the pain a little bit.

15
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.900
And, let's pass our way down to
that delete button on the post.

16
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.330
So, go back over here.

17
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.890
Here's the delete button.

18
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.920
Spoiler alert: we've got
the application component.

19
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.870
Then we've got the posts plural component,
then we've got the individual post

20
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.730
component, and
that's where the button lives.

21
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.010
So in order to change it
in the application state,

22
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.870
we're gonna have to pass all
that stuff all the way down.

23
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.985
We will eventually refactor that out,
but not yet.

24
00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:18.960
[LAUGH] So let's go ahead and
let's get into it.

25
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:27.536
So, let's give ourselves a handleRemove
function in application.

26
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.580
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And now we'll just take
the, we really just need the ID of it.

27
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.060
In order to get some stuff done here.

28
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.770
And let's start out with just
removing it from state first.

29
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.690
So we'll say const allPosts

30
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.232
= this.state.posts.

31
00:01:58.232 --> 00:02:02.580
And because it's an array we just
basically need to get it out of the array.

32
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.667
The easiest way to do that is
to filter through the array, and

33
00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:10.290
only keep the things that
are not the one with that ID.

34
00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:20.938
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we'll take each
post and you're allowed to stay

35
00:02:20.938 --> 00:02:27.360
if your Post ID it does not
equal the ID we're looking for.

36
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.660
So everyone else gets to stay but
the ID in question and

37
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.200
it is removed from the array.

38
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.849
And then we'll do this.setState.

39
00:02:38.794 --> 00:02:39.730
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: posts.

40
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.440
Now that's not gonna remove it from.

41
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.890
Firestore, but it is going to go ahead and
remove it from state.

42
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.150
So let's get that wired up and

43
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.490
then we'll put in the ability
to remove it from Firestore.

44
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.930
So we have that.

45
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.509
The next thing we need to do is we need
to pass that to the post component.

46
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.435
So we'll do a onRemove,

47
00:03:03.435 --> 00:03:11.930
this.handleRemove and

48
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.030
then that inside the post component,
that's now a prop.

49
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.767
We'll see how when we get to
wiring up subscriptions and

50
00:03:23.767 --> 00:03:28.330
getting real time updates,
we can remove some of this code.

51
00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.554
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, because
Firebase does in the way that it works,

52
00:03:32.554 --> 00:03:35.964
gives us a little bit of a different way
to think about how we manage state in

53
00:03:35.964 --> 00:03:37.380
the application.

54
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.150
And eventually we're gonna actually move
to just using some very modern react state

55
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.980
techniques, and wire them up with Firebase
as well, which I'm kinda excited about.

56
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.200
So I'm going to go into
the individual post.

57
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.342
We've passed down that on remove.

58
00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:55.640
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And so
we'll find that delete button.

59
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.867
And we'll say, hey,
when someone clicks it,

60
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:05.480
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Call that method.

61
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.152
Pass it the ID of the one in question.

62
00:04:14.997 --> 00:04:18.563
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, and it deletes each
one, we refresh, they're all still there

63
00:04:18.563 --> 00:04:22.090
because we're not actually deleting
them from Firestore just yet.

64
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.260
So we need to handle that as well and

65
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.770
that's actually fairly easy to do,
right, with another method.

66
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.842
And so what we'll see is we can go
back over into the application.

67
00:04:39.784 --> 00:04:46.343
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll say, await
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: firestore.document,

68
00:04:46.343 --> 00:04:48.870
or .doc in this case.

69
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.790
Now, before I was using
the .collection.doc.

70
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.920
This one, I'm just gonna use the
shorthand, mostly to demonstrate it, and

71
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.770
we'll say, go ahead and
find me the document with that ID,

72
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.350
and we'll call delete on it.

73
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.930
Right, and
that will remove it from the database.

74
00:05:06.156 --> 00:05:09.732
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we remove it from the
database and then we're gonna go ahead and

75
00:05:09.732 --> 00:05:12.150
also remove it from the application state.

76
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.020
And this will work,

77
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.100
I think one of them has a slight bug
when I have the Date.Now() in their.

78
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.600
We'll find out together.

79
00:05:22.253 --> 00:05:26.450
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Think two out of
three of them will go away, yeah.

80
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.547
The other one has its own ID field,
so if I get rid of that.

81
00:05:33.095 --> 00:05:34.858
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We can
delete that one as well.

82
00:05:42.452 --> 00:05:45.260
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Now you can
see that they're all deleted.

83
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.760
Awesome.
