WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.530
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The first
thing we wanna do,

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.972
if we look at authentication there's
this web setup button here and

3
00:00:07.972 --> 00:00:13.616
we live in fancy React land,
we don't we are better than script tags.

4
00:00:13.616 --> 00:00:19.820
We don't need those in our lives but we do
wanna grab this configuration over here.

5
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.714
And you might be like, should I be
committing my API key to client-side code?

6
00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:28.010
It's fine.

7
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.580
Trust me.

8
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.221
We're going to secure
the database with rules.

9
00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:34.854
And then there are, if you need to do like
admin access with like a true API key,

10
00:00:34.854 --> 00:00:37.570
there's a secret API key that
you can get somewhere else.

11
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.700
This is the one that basically,
when this client-side application that you

12
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.400
are sending out to your users,
not unlike an iOS or

13
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.660
an Android app, It needs to know what
Firebase project it is associated to.

14
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.180
So, we can take this and

15
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.280
we can put it in our client's base,
we can send it to users.

16
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.265
It is totally okay, we will secure
our database through other means, so

17
00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:02.265
it's not like they can just send
willy-nilly calls, yeah cool open up

18
00:01:02.265 --> 00:01:06.245
the developer tools and get Firebase,
and like go ahead and do stuff, right?

19
00:01:06.245 --> 00:01:10.465
No, we will have that thing
locked down not at first but

20
00:01:10.465 --> 00:01:12.695
eventually we will lock it down.

21
00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:14.755
So, it is safe to ship this.

22
00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:16.910
So, let's go ahead and copy that.

23
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.630
There is this copy button here, but

24
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.680
I'm gonna just take the pieces I need
cuz I don't need all the rest of this.

25
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.320
And I'll go into Visual Studio Code, and

26
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.140
in my source directory I'm gonna
make a new file called Firebase.JS.

27
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.890
The reason I create this file is
there's a whole bunch of minor

28
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.790
configuration that I'm
gonna wanna do to FireBase.

29
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.930
So, rather than kinda have it all over my
code base, I'm just basically gonna do

30
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.660
it all in one place and
then export the stuff that I need.

31
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.530
This is also, in larger projects,

32
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.820
I find this really useful to put
other helper functions in there.

33
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.720
We're going to write most of our
hot fires by hand everywhere, but

34
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.750
for more common things I tend to create
functions that will go ahead and

35
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.270
get all posts and that's just a function
that will do the right thing for me, so

36
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.980
on and so forth.

37
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.180
We're not going to do that because
we want to practice writing and

38
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.990
get really familiar with it.

39
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.840
I don't want to abstract it away too fast.

40
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.420
But, in a kind of larger application,
I am very lazy, and

41
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.010
don't wanna type that
stuff more than I have to.

42
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.470
So, I tend to use this as a place for
a lot of my like abstractions and

43
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.930
stuff along those lines.

44
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.722
So, one thing we will do is we will

45
00:02:24.722 --> 00:02:30.383
import Firebase from Firebase/app.

46
00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:35.735
Now, you could do import Firebase from
Firebase, and you will get a like

47
00:02:35.735 --> 00:02:41.200
polite console warning is not a console
are it's just a console warning.

48
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.840
It's in yellow saying, like hey,
maybe you don't want to do this.

49
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.400
The difference between doing Firebase and
Firebase/app.

50
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.470
if you just do Firebase,
you are going to get everything.

51
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.600
You are going to get the JavaScript code
for the database, the JavaScript code for

52
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.870
the authentication, the JavaScript code
for messaging, the JavaScript code for

53
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.630
maybe a whole bunch of
stuff you're not using,

54
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.040
which is going to make your bundle
bigger than it needs to be.

55
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.535
So there's nothing stopping
you from doing this

56
00:03:08.535 --> 00:03:12.010
except just why be hostile to
users if you don't need to.

57
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.590
So, we will do Firebase/app
which is just the bare bones

58
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.020
as much Firebase as you need to get by.

59
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.545
And then we'll paste that in.

60
00:03:22.844 --> 00:03:25.220
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm going to change
that to const because I'm hipster.

61
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.070
And we've basically now wired up,
we've configured Firebase.

62
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.580
One other thing I'm gonna do is,
I'm just going to

63
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.700
export default this Firebase instance,
which doesn't really matter but

64
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.540
we're gonna export a few other
things from this file as well.

65
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.670
And solely for demonstration purposes,

66
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.340
I am gonna attach Firebase
to the Window objects.

67
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.080
So, that if we wanna
play around something or

68
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.980
if we want to debug, we can just open up
the developed tools and play with it.

69
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.660
This is not a necessarily like

70
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.420
best practice that you should
do in your application.

71
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.180
This is, we're gonna be live coding
together for a really long time, and

72
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.470
occasionally we might wanna poke
at stuff and explain stuff, so

73
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.580
we'll have this here as well.

74
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.830
You could even do,
if you really wanted to,

75
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.140
if process.env.node equals
development do this otherwise don't.

76
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.150
You could do fancy stuff like that.

77
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.230
We're not going to because we're
just gonna keep it, really simple.

78
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.670
Cool, the next thing we wanna do is,
we wanna set up Cloudfire, cuz this,

79
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:37.490
Firebase, we've effectively configured
Firebase and nothing with it, right?

80
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.010
Firebase without a database or
authentication, or storage, or

81
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.920
cloud functions is not much of anything,
right?

82
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.460
We just pulled in the core library,

83
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.730
we don't necessarily have any of
the tooling around with it yet.
