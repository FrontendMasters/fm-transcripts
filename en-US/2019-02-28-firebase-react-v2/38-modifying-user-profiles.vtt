00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.364
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This has some problems
that we're going to need to deal with

2
00:00:02.364 --> 00:00:04.369
in a second which is,
how many times does this fire?

3
00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.626
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Once, so we'll probably
need to refactor this in a little bit.

4
00:00:13.626 --> 00:00:15.330
But we'll burn that
bridge when we get to it.

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.690
Let's go ahead and cancel out of this user

6
00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:27.436
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I have to await it.

7
00:00:33.708 --> 00:00:36.370
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So now you can
see it fills in the display name.

8
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.130
Everything is on those lines.

9
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.780
Eventually we're going to implement a user

10
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.760
profile editing page which is not gonna
update this automatically, right?

11
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.640
Cuz we're only getting it.

12
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.396
What we're eventually gonna wanna do is
we're also gonna want to subscribe to

13
00:00:52.396 --> 00:00:55.435
all the changes to this document as well,
right?

14
00:00:55.435 --> 00:00:59.101
But we do have the ability.

15
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:03.007
So now go in to our database.

16
00:01:04.301 --> 00:01:08.381
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Look at that,
we've got users.

17
00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:11.252
And there is our one user and
so far this makes sense.

18
00:01:11.252 --> 00:01:13.762
There is a created update,
there is display name, there is an email.

19
00:01:13.762 --> 00:01:15.661
We can go ahead and
we can change stuff about the user, right?

20
00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:17.285
So the one that we got from Google Sign In
and stuff along those lines,

21
00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:17.820
we couldn't change.

22
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.260
We're always getting
that from Google Sign In.

23
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.330
Let's actually take one from
Google Sign In cuz I think it'll

24
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.970
be a little more interesting.

25
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.777
So I'll sign in with Google.

26
00:01:33.504 --> 00:01:38.610
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I have a second user that
got created when that user logged in.

27
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.955
And let's go change my name.

28
00:01:46.332 --> 00:01:47.390
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Go ahead and refresh.

29
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.740
And so now it is reading from that
user profile instead of that.

30
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.090
So that we can add all sorts
of data onto this object now.

31
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.700
We can put anything from
the things that they favorited

32
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.017
to any kind of metadata that we want,
right?

33
00:02:01.017 --> 00:02:05.510
And these user documents are generated for
us on the fly as users sign up for

34
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.510
application or that they log in, right?

35
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.350
So we're kinda dynamically doing this now.
