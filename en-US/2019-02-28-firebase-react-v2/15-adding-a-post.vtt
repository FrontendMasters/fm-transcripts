00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.000
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
we make changes to the database.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.850
It's a reload right now,
cuz we're just simply asking the database.

3
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.490
When we're doing that get, it's just
fetching stuff from the database.

4
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.950
In a little bit, we'll learn how
to actually subscribe to changes

5
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.930
in the database and get real-time updates,
but right now, we're just fetching stuff.

6
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.010
So two things we're gonna do is that
little map function that I wrote,

7
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.140
that was fun, that was cute.

8
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.580
I don't ever wanna write it again.

9
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.890
So I'm gonna need it
in a few other places.

10
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.240
So who works on an application
where you have a juncture or

11
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.740
file called utilities.js?

12
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.656
We all do.

13
00:00:33.656 --> 00:00:37.461
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm gonna make

14
00:00:37.461 --> 00:00:38.680
a juncture or file.

15
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.940
I'll do export const collectidsAndDocs,

16
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.760
as we all know naming things is
the hardest problem in computer science.

17
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:56.050
So we'll go ahead and
we will grab that function and

18
00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.009
paste it right in there, sweet.

19
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.260
Now we'll collect IDs and docs.

20
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.590
All right, and let's get rid
of all of this fake stuff and

21
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.880
state, cuz now we're getting real data.

22
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.356
All right now,

23
00:01:19.356 --> 00:01:24.340
it'd be nice to actually be able to
not have to log in to the Firebase

24
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.220
console in order to make new things.

25
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.650
So let's go ahead and figure that out.

26
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.145
So we have this handleCreate, and
right now we can use the form,

27
00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:39.837
it'll show up on the page, but we're not
persisting that in the database anywhere.

28
00:01:39.837 --> 00:01:44.890
We do need to go ahead and
figure out how to add stuff in there.

29
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.580
Now, there's a few ways
that you could do this.

30
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.170
We could go ahead and
do an optimistic update.

31
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.620
The problem is that for

32
00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.290
stuff like the created.time,
we're not gonna have that just yet.

33
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.280
We don't have a really good
way of dealing with that.

34
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.230
So what we're gonna do is we're just
gonna put it in the database and

35
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.600
then we'll immediately
take it right back out.

36
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.320
And the reason we'll do this is that
will give it its unique ID when we add

37
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.740
real timestamps.

38
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.690
In a little bit we'll get the timestamp
and stuff like that as well.

39
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.680
When we go ahead and add some cloud
functions later in this workshop,

40
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.110
we'll actually get the resulted
version from the database, right?

41
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.020
We could spend a little bit of time
in doing the optimistic updates, but

42
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.120
that is more of a not Firebase thing, so

43
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.160
I'm going to kind of hand
wave over that a little bit.

44
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.733
So we'll go ahead and we have the post.

45
00:02:40.733 --> 00:02:43.950
We don't actually need this anymore,
but we'll keep it for a second.

46
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.448
So we could do a,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We need to make this

47
00:02:48.448 --> 00:02:51.090
an asynchronist function,
so put an async beforehand.

48
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.092
We'll do this docRef here,
and that'll await.

49
00:03:01.105 --> 00:03:04.437
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You can see a world
where in that firebase.js you make

50
00:03:04.437 --> 00:03:09.340
a post collection variable so you don't
have to type this every time, right?

51
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.010
That would be a legitimate thing to do, or

52
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.680
an add post function that you could
just use everywhere in your application.

53
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.854
That's kind of what I do normally,
I'm deliberately not doing that so

54
00:03:20.854 --> 00:03:24.762
that we see the syntax over, and
over, and over again, but yeah.

55
00:03:24.762 --> 00:03:28.370
So we'll use the add method and
we'll add this post.

56
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.929
Now, I happen to know that add will return

57
00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:38.530
a reference to the place in,
you can kind of see it,

58
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:45.800
it returns the promise that
resolves to a document reference.

59
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.980
So it's gonna put it in the database and
it's going to then return to me.

60
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.340
Okay, I generated in your ID,

61
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.270
here is the place in the database
where I put your new document.

62
00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:02.160
And that is why I call this variable
over here docref, all right?

63
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.020
Or documentref or documentreference,

64
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.860
if your font was smaller, you might
type something really long like that.

65
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.980
My font is large, so
I'm not doing that at this point.

66
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.330
So we have the document reference and
then what we'll do is we'll go ahead and

67
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.050
we'll just get that
document right back out.

68
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.182
Theoretically, like we have, we could
get the ID from that document reference,

69
00:04:24.182 --> 00:04:26.965
we have enough in there right now
to put it in stay without doing

70
00:04:26.965 --> 00:04:28.692
that roundtrip back to the database.

71
00:04:28.692 --> 00:04:33.295
But this also gives me the opportunity to
show you how to get a single document for

72
00:04:33.295 --> 00:04:36.331
the database, so
I'm going to indulge and do that.

73
00:04:36.331 --> 00:04:39.223
So with that reference,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I can call get, and

74
00:04:39.223 --> 00:04:43.208
that again returns a promise,
we hover over it,

75
00:04:43.208 --> 00:04:48.763
means it returns a document snapshot
promise that we will wait for.

76
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.804
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
then we'll do a const this new post.

77
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.032
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Take that
function that we made earlier,

78
00:05:03.032 --> 00:05:04.490
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Pass in that document.

79
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.330
And that will, again, put the ID on there.

80
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.260
That was the one that we wrote that
I never wanted to write again.

81
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.514
We're gonna use it for

82
00:05:09.514 --> 00:05:16.302
a second time and,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Then

83
00:05:16.302 --> 00:05:18.149
we can just pop it on to
the beginning of the post.

84
00:05:25.793 --> 00:05:28.634
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
now let's go ahead and try it out.

85
00:05:36.092 --> 00:05:40.091
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There it is on the top,
go back here.

86
00:05:43.592 --> 00:05:45.949
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You can see I've
got my new document here as well.

87
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.870
The rest of that is actually put in there
by just my ad post function, that's

88
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.470
just putting in some dummy data that we're
gonna need to replace over the course of

89
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.560
this workshop, but there it is for now.

90
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.274
There is one thing that I need to do,

91
00:06:01.274 --> 00:06:05.518
which is previously I was adding

92
00:06:05.518 --> 00:06:10.265
IDs by hand in,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Posts,

93
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:15.009
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Or AddPost rather,

94
00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.980
where I was doing this cute thing.

95
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.240
I actually have IDs now, so
I don't need to do that anymore.

96
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.089
Right, so these will be generated for
me, awesome.
