00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.810
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
so now we have both in place.

2
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.810
We can do a little bit of cleaning
up of the user interface.

3
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.564
Which is when we implemented those
security rules, we have a whole bunch of

4
00:00:10.564 --> 00:00:14.804
stuff here that the user's gonna
get yelled at for doing, right.

5
00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:21.312
Like, if they're not logged in,
we still show them the ad post forum,

6
00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:26.420
even though, right,
they shouldn't see it, right.

7
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.100
And so there's a whole bunch of little
things that we can and should do,

8
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.766
in this case we could, for
instance we might want to hide

9
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:38.755
the Delete button from the ones
they can't delete, right.

10
00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:41.683
We'll start with using just auth for

11
00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:47.539
that right now because both of these,
actually for post we can just do it,

12
00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.065
I believe,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: For just the regular

13
00:00:53.065 --> 00:00:58.042
post cuz that's to show the power
of the abstraction we just built.

14
00:00:58.042 --> 00:01:04.033
We can just say,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: useContext now.

15
00:01:14.952 --> 00:01:17.865
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll actually, I'm
gonna create myself just a little helper

16
00:01:17.865 --> 00:01:20.684
function here just because I don't
wanna get too gnarly in here.

17
00:01:20.684 --> 00:01:27.018
We'll say,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: belongsToCurrentUser.

18
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:33.952
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Pass in a currentUser,
and the user that owns this.

19
00:01:42.187 --> 00:01:44.718
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Whoop, I don't wanna talk
about how many times I make that mistake,

20
00:01:44.718 --> 00:01:45.557
it's embarrassing.

21
00:01:49.312 --> 00:01:52.520
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There's no current user,
at any given point,

22
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.070
currentUser could be nul, so we always
have to be kind of defensive against that.

23
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.689
And then we'll do currentUser.uid.

24
00:02:04.571 --> 00:02:07.346
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll
call this one postAuthor,

25
00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:13.780
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: .uid.

26
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.050
And so this is just a simple function
that will take the currentUser object and

27
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.000
the user that is passed into this post and
see if their uids are the same.

28
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.660
If the uids are the same they
should be able to delete the post.

29
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.910
If they are not the same,
then they shouldn't.

30
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.217
And before I made this abstraction,
I would have had to pass the user down

31
00:02:35.217 --> 00:02:40.524
from the application to the posts,
from the posts to the singular post,

32
00:02:40.524 --> 00:02:44.439
all the way down in order to
be able to do this, right.

33
00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.674
I don't really want to do that, so

34
00:02:46.674 --> 00:02:51.930
with this now I can just simply wrap the
components that care about a user in this.

35
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.050
So I'm already being able to
use this abstraction here.

36
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.570
So we'll get the user here, and
for the Delete button we'll just

37
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:05.043
say,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: User,

38
00:03:05.043 --> 00:03:09.830
actually these are both called user so
that's not gonna go great.

39
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.557
Call this one currentUser.

40
00:03:18.228 --> 00:03:26.135
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: User,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll

41
00:03:26.135 --> 00:03:28.230
close that curly brace.

42
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.540
We should be good.

43
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.330
Unclear what I have in
the same AI application.

44
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.100
So now you can see that, okay,
this component is somewhere down the tree.

45
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.170
And yeah, this still a small application,
but you can imagine it growing bigger.

46
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.470
This one component is somewhere down
the tree that cared about the user.

47
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.050
Cool, I can just pass it
right to that component.

48
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.490
And now we don't show the Delete
button for that one, which is awesome
