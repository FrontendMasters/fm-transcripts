00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.830
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That's cool, now what
we'd like to do is actually show it on

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.620
the page cuz console login and stuff from
a database does not an application make.

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.590
So, let's go ahead and we're not, we're
gonna use the snapshot.docs instead now.

4
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.660
Now, you could theoretically
put an array up here and

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.990
do everything and
then use stuff afterwards.

6
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.280
In real time database,
you had to do that, but

7
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.820
what we have here is snapshot.docs, and
that's an array that we can map over.

8
00:00:32.374 --> 00:00:37.100
And, as you saw before,
let's go back over real quick and

9
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.980
look, is I have that ID, and
in the data, I just have the fields.

10
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.460
Now, so it's not my first react out,
I know what's about to happen to me is I'm

11
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.400
going to then try to make a bunch of post
components and what's gonna yell at me?

12
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.670
It's gonna want a key for
every single one of them, right?

13
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.570
Fine, so I would like to include,
that ID with the rest of the data.

14
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.122
That's just going to take a little
bit of JavaScript foo, no big deal.

15
00:01:05.122 --> 00:01:10.130
So what we’ll do is we’ll say .map,

16
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.764
we’ll say for each document, go ahead and

17
00:01:15.764 --> 00:01:22.981
return me a new object that
is the idea will be doc.ID.

18
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:26.922
And, then you can go ahead and take
all the other properties from data and

19
00:01:26.922 --> 00:01:27.901
spread them out.

20
00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:39.050
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, and so that,
we'll actually store that as post.

21
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.650
This will now be a bunch of post objects.

22
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.780
We're gonna use an array right now
cuz it is simpler to reason about for

23
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.650
a lot of our purposes
as we learn firebase.

24
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.890
But, I feel really strongly
that arrays are the devil.

25
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.250
And, key value stores are better, but
they'll add a little bit of complexity.

26
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.420
In reducts, it's usually better to
store them as an object so you can

27
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.600
easily remove stuff and get stuff out of
the database, but we'll go with this.

28
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.901
We'll have to do some array filtering and
mapping in a little bit, but

29
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:04.450
it'll be fine.

30
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.015
And, we'll do this.setState.

31
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.588
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Posts.

32
00:02:14.588 --> 00:02:19.181
All right, so we're going to
await the firestore collection,

33
00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:22.380
we'll get all the things out of there.

34
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.520
Then, we'll go through
the snapshot of the database.

35
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.940
We'll map them into objects that will not
get me in trouble with the virtual DOM.

36
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.054
And, then,
we will set the state of our application.

37
00:02:38.894 --> 00:02:41.901
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So, you can see I had
those, like, dummy ones that were in state

38
00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:45.920
for a second there, and then, they
are replaced by what was in the database.

39
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.460
Just to make you believe that I'm honest,
let's make one more.

40
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.005
We'll do title Steve is honest,

41
00:02:56.005 --> 00:03:01.360
and the content will be I told you.

42
00:03:04.655 --> 00:03:05.762
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Make this a map.

43
00:03:09.245 --> 00:03:13.530
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Display name not Steve.

44
00:03:15.705 --> 00:03:22.767
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The uid will be,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That's totally legit.

45
00:03:28.588 --> 00:03:30.210
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Didn't save for
some reason.

46
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.499
It's really important that I
make one about how I'm honest,

47
00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:34.309
and then have it not save.

48
00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:44.891
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, there it is.

49
00:03:46.248 --> 00:03:49.958
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Hit refresh,
and there it is.
