00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:01.550
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We've got a comment form.

2
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:09.630
It doesn't do anything yet because we have
a no out function in here for uncreate.

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:18.622
So we'll say,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: createComment.

4
00:00:25.747 --> 00:00:27.577
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: console.log(comment).

5
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.679
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll use that down
here just to make sure it works.

6
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:49.292
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's
go back to my console.

7
00:00:52.968 --> 00:00:54.735
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
let's take a look at the createComment

8
00:00:54.735 --> 00:00:56.800
cuz it's definitely clearing it out and
doing something.

9
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.800
I think we might have to actually
call the onCreate, let's see.

10
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.060
Comments pass this onCreate.

11
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.557
Cool, so
we'll just say this.props.onCreate.

12
00:01:11.557 --> 00:01:13.000
Now, what we can do here?

13
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.970
If we have the post ID,

14
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.430
we could pass it all the way down
like we were doing in the post before

15
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.990
where we weren't passing functions
from the application all the way down.

16
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.400
We could totally refactor and do that.

17
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.609
But let's get it working, and
then we can decide to do that.

18
00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:41.189
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, so it looks
like I've got some fun things here

19
00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.276
which is an error missing or
insufficient permissions.

20
00:01:45.276 --> 00:01:47.343
I'm not totally sure where
that's coming from yet, but

21
00:01:47.343 --> 00:01:49.680
I know that I don't have the ability
to actually make comments.

22
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.823
So that's a thing.

23
00:01:50.823 --> 00:01:54.235
I also likely don't have
the ability to read comments,

24
00:01:54.235 --> 00:01:57.420
right, because we never
made that security rule.

25
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:05.300
[LAUGH] So it is very likely that me
trying to get the comments is not a thing.

26
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.725
Again this is why sometimes,
like, we'll leave it wide open,

27
00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:15.929
when we're first developing.

28
00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:17.347
So if I just go ahead and

29
00:02:17.347 --> 00:02:24.410
we comment this out,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There is no error now so

30
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.666
now we know what the problem was.

31
00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:31.919
The problem was we don't have
permission to read comments,

32
00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.700
so let's go ahead and fix that.

33
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.348
We'll go to rules,
this time for the database.

34
00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:45.210
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Remember we saw earlier
when discussing security rules that

35
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.880
we can nest them, right?

36
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.344
So we say match

37
00:02:50.344 --> 00:02:58.149
/comments/(commentId).

38
00:02:58.149 --> 00:03:00.371
And I think anyone can read them.

39
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:03.395
That seems fine.

40
00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:07.489
And,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah,

41
00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.549
if they're logged in, go for it.

42
00:03:18.496 --> 00:03:21.298
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, no more error.

43
00:03:21.298 --> 00:03:24.274
&gt;&gt; Student: Is it possible to add
the star, like everything after that line?

44
00:03:24.274 --> 00:03:25.940
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah,
I could totally do that.

45
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.661
I [CROSSTALK] My heart says don't.

46
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:30.221
&gt;&gt; Student: Yeah, yeah.

47
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:32.227
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I don't
know how that could totally,

48
00:03:32.227 --> 00:03:35.246
cuz I could make all sorts
of weird collections, right?

49
00:03:35.246 --> 00:03:41.326
I tend to keep it super restrictive,
but yeah you could.

50
00:03:41.326 --> 00:03:44.154
All right, so we've got comments there.

51
00:03:47.596 --> 00:03:52.657
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: CreateComment,
so that would be what?

52
00:03:52.657 --> 00:03:57.349
This.commentsRef, this is why it's
nice to just cache them somewhere and

53
00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.809
give yourself shortcuts,
this.commentsRef.add.

54
00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:06.179
And we'll say all this stuff
from the comment I really

55
00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:12.158
need the user to know the rest
of that information, right?

56
00:04:12.158 --> 00:04:14.200
I don't have access to the user in here.

57
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.045
And then you'll point it out,
we have all this neat stuff for

58
00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:19.280
used context with a functional component.

59
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.220
But we don't have a way to get the user.

60
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.071
We have ways, but we don't have a really
nice way to get the user the same way

61
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:29.920
we did in those functional ones before,
but

62
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.320
there's inspiration in this withRouter,
right?

63
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.610
If that can give us all
the route information,

64
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.440
imagine one that could give
us all the user information.

65
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.109
So we're gonna start with just that.

66
00:04:45.257 --> 00:04:49.343
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Just an empty, a comment
with no author and see how it goes for us.

67
00:04:51.766 --> 00:04:53.590
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, cool.

68
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.700
I have default props that are just
filling in the rest of it,

69
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.400
so it's not like there was magic in there.

70
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.870
It's just that, if nobody passes in
a username, I chose Bill Murray.

71
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.190
Mostly for the site philmurray.com
which is like placeholder art

72
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.680
that is all Bill Murray.

73
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.120
Cool, so
we can see we can make comments now.

74
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.538
I wanna check that out in
the database real quick.

75
00:05:16.476 --> 00:05:22.890
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You see posts and
now posts can have comments.

76
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.930
Comments can have content, right?

77
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.480
So we can kind of keep nesting down and
see that all in Cloud Firestore as well.
