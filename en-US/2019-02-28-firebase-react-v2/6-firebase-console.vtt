00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.220
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
so what we wanna do is,

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.840
right now this application has no
concept of Firebase, let's rectify that.

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.044
So to get started with Firebase,
we go to firebase.google.com, and

4
00:00:14.044 --> 00:00:20.325
we can go to the console,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

5
00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:22.290
you get this fun animation.

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.740
And if you have a bunch of projects,
they are here.

7
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.640
If this is your first Firebase
application, this will be empty.

8
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.310
Either way,
we are going to add a new project.

9
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.819
All right, so we give our project a name.

10
00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:45.071
I'm going to call it Think Piece Live,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Just

11
00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:47.330
because I already have
one called Think Piece.

12
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.240
And then I am going to accept the terms
and I'm going to create the project.

13
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.087
And it will go ahead and
spin up an entire back end for me.

14
00:00:57.087 --> 00:01:01.380
And while this little loading
indicator feels like an eternity,

15
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.310
if you consider that an entire back end
is getting spun up for you, not bad.

16
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.692
All right, and it's ready to go.

17
00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:15.028
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So over here we've
got Authentication, Database,

18
00:01:15.028 --> 00:01:19.240
Storage, Hosting, Functions, ML Kit.

19
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.730
We are going to use the top five of them.

20
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.310
If you are slightly sad that
we're not also using ML Kit,

21
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.945
it's because it doesn't
have web support yet.

22
00:01:27.945 --> 00:01:30.407
[LAUGH] So I would like to.

23
00:01:30.407 --> 00:01:34.935
If it supported a web application,
we'd totally be using it today, but

24
00:01:34.935 --> 00:01:37.210
it doesn't, so we won't.

25
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.750
But we will use all of
the rest of these today.

26
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.640
So we'll be able to install
an authentication system and

27
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.730
authorization system out of the box,

28
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.700
we'll be able to spin up a database
that will push real time updates.

29
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.130
We'll be able to store binary files.

30
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.790
In this case, we'll use images.

31
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.585
We're gonna push it live to the web
with a simple CLI command, and

32
00:01:56.585 --> 00:01:59.142
then we will write some
back end functions.

33
00:01:59.142 --> 00:02:03.273
We'll create some API end points, we will
have functions that listen to changes on

34
00:02:03.273 --> 00:02:05.290
documents and update other documents.

35
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.546
We'll have one that censors
the word coffee script, and

36
00:02:07.546 --> 00:02:09.710
we'll write a whole bunch
of stuff along those lines.
