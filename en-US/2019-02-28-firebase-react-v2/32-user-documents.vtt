&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we're gonna
set up some email authentication.

2
00:00:03.131 --> 00:00:07.217
And I'm mostly doing that to show you
basically the differences, right?

3
00:00:07.217 --> 00:00:09.762
You can imagine for email authentication,

4
00:00:09.762 --> 00:00:14.654
you're not gonna get a free photo URL that
they use as their Google profile, right?

5
00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:18.684
You're not gonna get a display name,
you're gonna get an email address, and

6
00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:19.485
a UID, right?

7
00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:23.284
And so this is a great place where if we
had these documents, we can, okay, if

8
00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:27.820
they log in from Google, sure, start out
with that picture and that display name.

9
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.700
Otherwise, we'll eventually
build this user document

10
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.760
that the user can then go ahead and
upload their own photo.

11
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.930
And change their display name,
and stuff along those lines.

12
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.099
So we can kinda see both.

13
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.035
Yeah, this is more work than just using
one of the auth ones we get for free.

14
00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:43.900
But I think it at least,
highlights the difference.

15
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.236
You might choose not to
do email authentication.

16
00:00:46.236 --> 00:00:48.767
There's also like,
phone authentication, too, right?

17
00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:50.926
Which is a different can of worms.

18
00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:54.710
You might choose not to do this, but
I think showing you the differences,

19
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.080
I think, is useful important so
you can kind of make that choice.
