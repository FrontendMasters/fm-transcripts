00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.909
&gt;&gt; Steve: But first,
why isn't it gonna work?

2
00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:04.839
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Permissions.

3
00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:05.973
&gt;&gt; Steve: Permissions.

4
00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:11.851
Permissions, the idea of either reading or
writing is going to blow up.

5
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:14.497
Because we went from a wild west of,

6
00:00:14.497 --> 00:00:19.623
do whatever you want to the database,
to nothing, unless we say so.

7
00:00:19.623 --> 00:00:22.210
So now, it means we have to say so.

8
00:00:25.093 --> 00:00:25.665
&gt;&gt; Steve: Cool, so

9
00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:30.700
let's flip over to those rules,
&gt;&gt; Steve: And

10
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.154
we're gonna add a second rule here.

11
00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:43.082
&gt;&gt; Steve: We're gonna say, for matching,
&gt;&gt; Steve: userId,

12
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:47.436
&gt;&gt; Steve: It's a profile,

13
00:00:47.436 --> 00:00:50.871
there's nothing secret in it, so
we're gonna allow anyone to read them.

14
00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:52.900
You can imagine a world where
it's like Twitter, eventually,

15
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.962
we didn't build the UI for this.

16
00:00:53.962 --> 00:00:56.655
But you can imagine a world where
they can go visit a given user, and

17
00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:59.124
maybe see all their posts, or
something along those lines.

18
00:00:59.124 --> 00:01:05.508
So it makes sense to let
someone read something, right?

19
00:01:05.508 --> 00:01:08.574
One quick thing that,
as I think about it is,

20
00:01:08.574 --> 00:01:12.711
these security rules apply to
the entire document, right?

21
00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:16.012
So if you're like, okay,
I want to let them read X, Y, and

22
00:01:16.012 --> 00:01:18.077
Z properties, but not A, B, and C?

23
00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:20.216
You should either make
a separate document, or

24
00:01:20.216 --> 00:01:23.162
maybe a sub-document in a collection,
or something like that.

25
00:01:23.162 --> 00:01:25.433
But you can't say,
only certain properties,

26
00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:28.682
they can either read the document or
they can't read the document.

27
00:01:28.682 --> 00:01:33.866
All right, and then we'll allow write if

28
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:38.902
the request.auth.uid == the userId

29
00:01:38.902 --> 00:01:43.799
of the document, so this idea up here.

30
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.308
&gt;&gt; Steve: So we'll save that,
&gt;&gt; Steve: And

31
00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:51.042
now we're gonna put it in the two places.

32
00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:02.433
&gt;&gt; Steve: We'll go ahead,
and in the SignUp,

33
00:02:06.992 --> 00:02:08.137
&gt;&gt; Steve: We're gonna say,

34
00:02:10.522 --> 00:02:13.825
&gt;&gt; Steve: createUserProfileDocument,

35
00:02:13.825 --> 00:02:19.204
with that user we just made,
plus the displayName,

36
00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:22.515
that's that additional data.

37
00:02:24.373 --> 00:02:27.954
&gt;&gt; Steve: All right, and
then in the Application

38
00:02:27.954 --> 00:02:33.754
component,
&gt;&gt; Steve: We're

39
00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:39.835
gonna say,
&gt;&gt; Steve: So

40
00:02:39.835 --> 00:02:41.423
we should get back the full
user at this point.

41
00:02:41.423 --> 00:02:45.629
We'll say, user, this needs to
become an asynchronous function.

42
00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:55.574
&gt;&gt; Steve: We'll say user is,
&gt;&gt; Steve: Now,

43
00:02:55.574 --> 00:02:59.150
if we think about the code, it
conditionally checks to see if it exists,

44
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.333
but it always returns,
getting the document, no matter what.

45
00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:05.444
So it basically just saved us some
conditional logic, with this way,

46
00:03:05.444 --> 00:03:06.719
we don't have to call both.

47
00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.304
We can call it, it will only create
the document if it needs to, and

48
00:03:10.304 --> 00:03:12.299
we'll get it back, no matter what.

49
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:25.540
&gt;&gt; Steve: We'll call this,
&gt;&gt; Steve: userAuth,

50
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.870
I just can't name them both user.
