00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.310
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: What do I do
on this user profile page?

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.130
Well, really the reason we're implementing
is an excuse for me to do file uploads, so

3
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.280
I can show you how easy it is to upload
files and store them in Fireface.

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.441
That is really the whole reason we're
doing this, but we'll also let them change

5
00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:18.302
the display name because we know the
people who sign up with the email address

6
00:00:18.302 --> 00:00:22.133
and password aren't privileged enough
to have display names by default.

7
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:25.220
So we will also allow
them to do that as well.

8
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.313
And the side thing that I wanna teach you,
as we do this,

9
00:00:30.313 --> 00:00:35.175
is basically kind of remember that this
dot collection, dot doc, basically how to

10
00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:39.631
start extracting some of that in your
component, to make it more workable.

11
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:44.246
So that you don't have these
giant pyramids of doom that

12
00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:46.708
start eking their way right.

13
00:00:46.708 --> 00:00:48.432
The moment you have to scroll left and

14
00:00:48.432 --> 00:00:51.834
right if your font is not size 24 like
mine is, like you have a problem.

15
00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:55.252
So we're gonna start to break stuff out
and hopefully see some patterns for

16
00:00:55.252 --> 00:00:57.580
working with some of these things.

17
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.080
Now, that is going to be a little bit of
typing coming up especially cuz I gotta

18
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.230
make input fields and input fields
in react just take too much work.

19
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.592
So let's go on this journey together.

20
00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:12.210
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I have
the user profile page.

21
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.380
Ahead of myself this is it,
right down in all of its glory.

22
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.394
It's not great.

23
00:01:19.622 --> 00:01:23.636
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Now I imagine on this
page, there's gonna be an input field for

24
00:01:23.636 --> 00:01:26.969
the display name,
there's gonna be a file input for

25
00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:31.760
choosing a file from the file system and
then a submit button.

26
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.350
That's kind of the UI that
I'm imagining right now.

27
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.992
Is that offensive to anyone?

28
00:01:35.992 --> 00:01:40.780
All right, I'm seeing nods, so
I think we're all on board for that.

29
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.150
Which is, file inputs in react
you can't actually store instate,

30
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.360
you have to use a ref.

31
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.320
So the only thing we're gonna need to
store in state is that new display name.

32
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.830
So we'll make it displayName.

33
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.402
We'll start that off as an empty string.

34
00:01:56.402 --> 00:01:59.425
Awesome and

35
00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:04.750
I'm gonna need to hold on to a reference
to that image input at some point.

36
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.610
That's not imageInput.

37
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.840
So we'll define that here as null for
now, and

38
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.395
on the component match we'll go ahead and
get it.

39
00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:18.277
All right, cool.

40
00:02:18.277 --> 00:02:24.433
Now, we'll have it just like
the normal handle change listener for

41
00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:29.848
the display input
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Probably just copy and

42
00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:30.990
paste that from somewhere, but.

43
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.128
Name and value from the event.target,

44
00:02:39.128 --> 00:02:43.685
filed under things that I should

45
00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:48.925
totally make a editor shortcut for.

46
00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:56.185
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, and we'll
do the same thing with a handleSubmit.

47
00:03:02.542 --> 00:03:06.280
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: event.preventDefault, so
that we don't accidentally dump the page.

48
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.450
We'll grab the display name on the state.

49
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.980
Now if there is a display name we want
to update the user reference, right?

50
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.540
Like go find slash users, slash uid and

51
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.710
we wanna go change something about it,
we wanna update that file, right?

52
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.880
So, before I get too carried away,

53
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.910
one of the things that I
really like to do in this case

54
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.320
to give myself some computer properties so
I'm not like typing too much.

55
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.725
I can say like, get uid,
let's give me a ESX computer property or

56
00:03:47.725 --> 00:03:49.803
I can say, return auth-

57
00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:59.424
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: .currentUser.uid.

58
00:03:59.424 --> 00:04:00.744
So now I don't have to
think about that anymore.

59
00:04:00.744 --> 00:04:04.164
I'll say get userRef.

60
00:04:07.718 --> 00:04:09.015
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And that'll return

61
00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:17.498
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Firestore.doc nope.

62
00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:26.867
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Users
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: it

63
00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:28.270
just basically building off the other one.

64
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.865
So, this will get you that
uid shortcut from before.

65
00:04:33.865 --> 00:04:35.390
So it gave me a reference there.

66
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.720
And so I can just use this in my component
and not have to think about this too much.

67
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.570
Now, I can say in here
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If

68
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.174
we have a new displayName,

69
00:04:51.174 --> 00:04:54.586
then go ahead and

70
00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:59.704
just do this.userRef,

71
00:04:59.704 --> 00:05:04.840
update, this.state.

72
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.049
We could even do displayName here,
just in case.

73
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.350
This update will take anything
from that object and merge it in.

74
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.240
So I may be a little bit more defensive
there in case I change stuff later.

75
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.092
All right, so these need some backticks,
thank you, Visual Studio.

76
00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:31.294
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Now we'll simply
just replace this here and

77
00:05:31.294 --> 00:05:34.250
this is where the fun comes.

78
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.714
So we'll say const displayName,

79
00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:45.925
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: this.state.

80
00:05:45.925 --> 00:05:46.928
All right,

81
00:05:56.824 --> 00:05:58.083
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Grab that.

82
00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:03.398
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Say onSubmit.

83
00:06:07.983 --> 00:06:09.514
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: this.handleSubmit.

84
00:06:15.956 --> 00:06:17.230
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Give ourselves an input.

85
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.220
Type text.

86
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.020
The value will be displayName.

87
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:35.030
Name will be displayName and on change.

88
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:48.810
This .handleChange the value,
did I do the value already?

89
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.603
Yeah, I did, sweet.

90
00:06:54.603 --> 00:06:55.774
We'll give it a placeholder, though.

91
00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:02.820
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool.

92
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Should we
do a catch there maybe?

93
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:13.010
Catch, what if the database would scream
at us back that something's required or

94
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.010
something like the display name, or-
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The application'll

95
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.060
blow up right now?

96
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

97
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.670
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We should fix that.

98
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.340
[LAUGHS] Remind me when we
get back up to that handle,

99
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.600
Seb that we should totally fix that.

100
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.733
You're right, that's a good catch.

101
00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:37.713
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll take that file and
this is gonna need a ref, and

102
00:07:37.713 --> 00:07:39.716
this.imageInput.

103
00:07:42.644 --> 00:07:46.450
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Reference, cool.

104
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:47.996
And then last thing we need to do.

105
00:07:57.242 --> 00:07:58.645
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Here's the submit button.

106
00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:07.030
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'll
see how that looks okay.

107
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.190
Looks like the auto complete bit me again.

108
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:10.820
Nope.

109
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.740
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, go here.

110
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.580
I've got this displayName now.

111
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.390
Let's try it out.

112
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.140
Nothing changes till I refresh,
then you can see the name changed.
