00:00:00.075 --> 00:00:03.350
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So what we'll do
right now is, we are simply going to,

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.858
when the application component mounts.

3
00:00:05.858 --> 00:00:11.223
We will go query FireStore for all of
the zero posts that are in there, right?

4
00:00:11.223 --> 00:00:16.227
So we'll start small, but
it'll be good, so we'll go ahead,

5
00:00:16.227 --> 00:00:22.270
we'll skip past all of this default
state and we'll do componentDidMount.

6
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.618
When component mounts, we'll say posts,
now, all of Firestore,

7
00:00:28.618 --> 00:00:34.863
all is a strong word,
95% of Firestore is asynchronis, right?

8
00:00:34.863 --> 00:00:36.912
And it's all promise based, and so

9
00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:39.789
if you're not super
comfortable with promises.

10
00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.715
You are about to become more comfortable
with promises because we are going to

11
00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:47.610
spend a bit of time
together working on them.

12
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.278
So if you do something like post and

13
00:00:51.278 --> 00:00:55.963
you said firestore.collection, posts.

14
00:00:55.963 --> 00:01:00.230
And this brings me to the collection,
this places me at the post collection.

15
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.884
If I want to get all of them, I do
a .get and we say, console.log, posts.

16
00:01:05.884 --> 00:01:10.390
This is not going to work super well, I'm
actually going to make that an object so

17
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.600
I can see what it was.

18
00:01:14.884 --> 00:01:19.121
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll flip back over,
you can see that I get a promise.

19
00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:21.504
I don't get the zero
posts that are in there,

20
00:01:21.504 --> 00:01:23.901
I get a promise of posts eventually,
right?

21
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:27.710
Which means I have asked Firestore for
the post, I have not received them yet,

22
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.394
I will let you know when I get them.

23
00:01:29.394 --> 00:01:32.602
So we do need to resolve the promise
before we can do anything with that.

24
00:01:32.602 --> 00:01:37.822
We'll see a few different ways to
go about doing that in a second.

25
00:01:37.822 --> 00:01:42.692
All right, the other thing we see is
this big, mean old warning, right?

26
00:01:42.692 --> 00:01:47.115
You're like, I didn't even do anything
yet, why am I getting yelled at?

27
00:01:47.115 --> 00:01:52.954
It's not really your fault,
basically, along the beta process,

28
00:01:52.954 --> 00:01:57.062
they had to make a breaking API change,
right?

29
00:01:57.062 --> 00:02:00.751
So originally they were just
using JavaScript date objects for

30
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:05.420
the created at, or any kind of
modified update that you're using.

31
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.886
Turns out that those
aren't super accurate, so

32
00:02:08.886 --> 00:02:12.782
they have their own kind of object for
managing dates.

33
00:02:12.782 --> 00:02:15.511
And so what we need to do is,
we need to opt into that.

34
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:21.200
The nice part here is while
this warning looks big and

35
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.512
mean, they give you the answer in here,
right?

36
00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:30.154
I used to teach developers and
one of the things I learned very,

37
00:02:30.154 --> 00:02:34.228
very early on is that none of us
actually read error messages, [LAUGH].

38
00:02:34.228 --> 00:02:37.389
So it looks scary and big, but if you
read it, it's actually not so bad, right?

39
00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:41.273
It's saying, basically,
make your Firestore,

40
00:02:41.273 --> 00:02:45.803
and then go ahead and do this,
put these settings in place.

41
00:02:45.803 --> 00:02:48.245
Let's go ahead and we'll copy that and

42
00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:51.207
we will bring it back
over to our firebase.js.

43
00:02:51.207 --> 00:02:54.482
Which is where we do all this
fun configuration stuff.

44
00:02:54.482 --> 00:02:59.014
And we will basically say,
we'll have the settings object,

45
00:02:59.014 --> 00:03:01.203
which is simply timestamps.

46
00:03:03.696 --> 00:03:05.927
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: timestampsInSnapshots,
true, and

47
00:03:05.927 --> 00:03:10.603
we'll set those settings, you might be
like, what other settings are there?

48
00:03:10.603 --> 00:03:14.915
Well, let me save you the,
let me save you the work,

49
00:03:14.915 --> 00:03:18.852
I've read the docs,
this is the only setting.

50
00:03:18.852 --> 00:03:24.659
So, I'm just going to go ahead and
collapse that down like that.

51
00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.723
This is the only setting for
Firestore at this point, but

52
00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:28.701
it does give them the option
to have more at some point.

53
00:03:28.701 --> 00:03:31.776
But if you're like,
I want to tweak other things,

54
00:03:31.776 --> 00:03:35.364
there's nothing else to tweak,
I'm really sorry, but.

55
00:03:35.364 --> 00:03:40.921
All right, let's go back, we have no more
error, we do have that promise in there.

56
00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:45.732
There we go, my responsive design skills
were lacking, I needed to fix that.

57
00:03:45.732 --> 00:03:48.782
So what we could do, we have two options
for dealing with these promises.

58
00:03:48.782 --> 00:03:55.601
We can go ahead here and we can say,
we can do a .then, that'll work.

59
00:03:57.462 --> 00:03:59.300
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll say.

60
00:04:02.748 --> 00:04:05.342
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'll talk about why
I'm calling it a snapshot in a second.

61
00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.318
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So the .then is
basically on the promise, saying,

62
00:04:13.318 --> 00:04:16.240
when this promise resolves,
this is what I want you to do.

63
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.174
When we hear back from firebase,
this is what I want you to do, and so

64
00:04:19.174 --> 00:04:21.811
we'll take the snapshot that
comes back from the database.

65
00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:25.353
And it's called a snapshot because
it's a real time database,

66
00:04:25.353 --> 00:04:28.120
which means that is the data
at that point in time.

67
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.344
That is a snapshot of
the current state of the world,

68
00:04:31.344 --> 00:04:34.801
based on your query that might
have changed since then.

69
00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:37.053
So we'll go ahead and
we'll flip back over.

70
00:04:37.053 --> 00:04:39.127
And you can see that
instead of a promise now,

71
00:04:39.127 --> 00:04:41.812
we still have that other one
that was outside that we left.

72
00:04:41.812 --> 00:04:45.215
We have a query snapshot,
that makes sense,

73
00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:48.629
we queried the database for
all of the posts.

74
00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:52.291
All right, cool, all right,
let's flip back and talk about that for

75
00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:54.850
a second before we play
around a little bit more.
