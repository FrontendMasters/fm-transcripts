00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.890
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
firing up authentication in

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.290
Firebase is suspiciously easy.

3
00:00:10.786 --> 00:00:15.440
We've got this Authentication
tab over here, and

4
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.780
we can go ahead and
pick Set up a sign-in method.

5
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.060
And you have a bunch of options here.

6
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.940
You have email and password,
you have phone, Google, Google Play Store,

7
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.660
Facebook, Twitter, GitHub.

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.260
The Facebook, Twitter, and
GitHub ones you need API keys for

9
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.902
Facebook, Twitter, or GitHub, seems legit.

10
00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:40.813
The Google one you don't because you
are in Firebase which is on the Google.

11
00:00:40.813 --> 00:00:43.759
Email and password, you don't as well.

12
00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:47.165
I'm gonna start with Google one since
I can assume that if we can log in

13
00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:51.180
the Firebase console, we have a Google
account, cuz that feels like a safe bet.

14
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.195
So who here has ever tried to implement
oauth either using passport on Rails,

15
00:00:58.195 --> 00:01:00.330
using what is a device.

16
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.330
How much fun was that?

17
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.010
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Not very.

18
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.283
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Not very much fun,
no, it wasn't fun.

19
00:01:05.283 --> 00:01:08.267
You wanna see what's gonna make you
both happy and sad at the same time?

20
00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:09.490
I'm about to implement oauth.

21
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.990
You ready?

22
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.139
Enable &gt; Save.

23
00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:17.490
I gotta put my email address in.

24
00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:26.401
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Save.

25
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:30.043
I have oauth set up.

26
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.193
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If I wanna do email and
password as well, I go here,

27
00:01:36.193 --> 00:01:42.270
I hit the little, just hit this
Enable right here, and I'll save it.

28
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.489
And I've got email and password
authentication set up as well, in place.

29
00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:51.130
Cool, so these are both there.

30
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.574
Now, we'll probably wanna
keep track of the user.

31
00:01:53.574 --> 00:01:58.441
We're gonna find some fun stuff out
together, as we figure out if that rate

32
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:03.490
limit for the real time database
also is counting right now as well.

33
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.560
If not, I'll just make a new API key and
I will keep it to myself.
