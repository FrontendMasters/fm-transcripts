00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So let's talk
about a little bit how we work with

2
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.110
Cloud Firestore before we
start writing some code.

3
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.590
So we're gonna create a Firestore object
when we start writing our React code,

4
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.040
and there's kind of a root.

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.750
You can't put anything in the root, but
you can have many collections, right?

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.770
In this case we'll have a post collection.

7
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.990
Right, and this will be a series of posts.

8
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.850
Now, that collection will have a bunch
of documents, you can go ahead and

9
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.180
get a particular document
out of there as well, right?

10
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.400
So here we have a collection of posts,

11
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.760
we can go get a document out of there and
that is a single post document.

12
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.640
However, a document could have,
in this case a post,

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.330
could have many comments, right?

14
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.520
So we could have a sub-collection of
comments that we can pull from as well.

15
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.670
So you can kinda see it.

16
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.070
There's this back and forth between
collections and documents, collections and

17
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.250
documents as we go through.

18
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.500
We have a collection, we can get
a specific, we can get all the documents

19
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.240
in a collection or we can get a specific
document out of a collection.

20
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.030
And then that document could
have a sub-collection.

21
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.770
In this case, it's comments.

22
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.840
Could be anything, though, right?

23
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.974
You could have books and then chapters,
or books and then characters,

24
00:01:10.974 --> 00:01:13.388
or both in there, and
kind of query down as you need to.

25
00:01:16.961 --> 00:01:20.200
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And then we can
go get a specific comment as well.

26
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.780
Right?
So you can see, it oscillates back and

27
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.560
forth between a collection, a document,
a collection, and a document.

28
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.450
If you don't want to keep
typing all those methods,

29
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.540
you can use something very
similar to a path or a URL.

30
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.330
But it's the same basic idea, right?

31
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.740
That these are the same concept, right?

32
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.130
Which is there is a collection,

33
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.910
there is a document, there is
a collection, there is a document.

34
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.820
And that's kind of how we traverse up and
down Cloud Firestore.

35
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.890
For whatever level you get to,
it is shallow, there.

36
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.590
If you just go to get the post,
you're not gonna get all of the posts and

37
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.300
all of the comments.

38
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.380
You're just going to get all of the posts.

39
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.420
If you say.

40
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.610
I just want a specific post,

41
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.750
you're not going to get any of the
comments unless you say /comments as well.

42
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.290
All right?

43
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.020
So you get to choose
how deep you wanna go.
