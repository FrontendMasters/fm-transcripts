00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.673
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We go
into the console here.

2
00:00:05.382 --> 00:00:10.579
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We can see
we've got that global fire base,

3
00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:15.870
I'll say auth = firebase
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: .auth.

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.110
And you can see that there's
also a sign out method and

5
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.768
call that method and I have that
auth state change handler, right?

6
00:00:27.768 --> 00:00:32.220
So I just call it and
I'm signed out, right?

7
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:39.331
Your job is to when they're signed in,
in that current user component.

8
00:00:43.722 --> 00:00:45.414
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There's
the sign out button.

9
00:00:45.414 --> 00:00:47.030
We wanna wire it up so

10
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.750
that when they click the sign out button,
they are in fact signed out.
