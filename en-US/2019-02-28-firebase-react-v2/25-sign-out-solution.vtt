00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.450
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
our mission was to implement sign out.

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.100
We saw before that it's a very complicated
method that we need to execute.

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.870
We have few options on where
we choose to put this.

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.020
I'm gonna choose to put it, for my own
sanity, near where I put the sign in.

5
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:29.935
So I could say something like,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: auth.signOut,

6
00:00:29.935 --> 00:00:33.160
do I really need to do this?

7
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.040
Probably not,
I could just pull in the auth module and

8
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.048
do it as well, but for
my own organization I do that, and

9
00:00:39.048 --> 00:00:44.042
then on current user,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You're gonna

10
00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:44.810
find the Sign Out button.

11
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.942
I'll say onClick,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll

12
00:00:54.942 --> 00:00:55.980
pull in that sign out method.

13
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.390
Let's pull it in from our
Local Firebase configuration.

14
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.959
So now what I should be able to do is I
should be able to sign in with Google.

15
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.850
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm signed in.

16
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.200
Once you hit the button,
you should be able to sign out, right?

17
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.322
That, in my experience,
is the [SOUND] well,

18
00:01:22.322 --> 00:01:28.730
let's go with world's easiest
implementation of authentication.

19
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.196
Hit a switch, put in the provider
into the sign in with pop up,

20
00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:35.870
the Google auth provider,
hit sign out when we're done.

21
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.860
We'll see in a little bit, we're gonna
switch over to security rules after this.

22
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.090
And start to lock down that database so

23
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.450
that not just anyone
can do anything to it.

24
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.400
But then we'll actually look at what's
involved in setting up an email,

25
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.330
username, and password as well.

26
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.960
That's just another method that we can
configure along the way too, awesome.
