00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We're not
going to see a lot here,

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.960
because we know that that is
an empty array currently.

3
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.390
Let's go ahead, and especially when
we're playing out really early,

4
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.650
we haven't wired up
the ability to add posts yet.

5
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.700
So what we'll do is we'll go ahead and

6
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.900
we'll flip over to our database,
and we'll cheat.

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.300
We'll just hit Add a Collection.

8
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.520
Cool thing about collections in
Firebase is you don't necessarily need

9
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.990
to add a collection.

10
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.365
But if you went ahead and said okay,

11
00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:37.300
Firestore.doc/posts12345/comments678910/r-
eplies so on and

12
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.175
so forth, it would make all the
collections the whole way down for you.

13
00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:45.912
Right, so
it's not like we have to sit there and

14
00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:49.952
think about your schema beforehand,
the simple putting a document in

15
00:00:49.952 --> 00:00:54.940
that location will create all of
the collections along the way for you.

16
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.480
So we'll say that this is the post,
and all right,

17
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.018
we're gonna go with an auto ID,
we give it a title,

18
00:01:04.018 --> 00:01:09.401
title should be,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Good

19
00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:12.790
Word About Cloud Firestore.

20
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.270
The content will be, it's pretty great.

21
00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:27.991
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Real quick, I'll show
you some of the options that you have,

22
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:32.980
you can do numbers, booleans,
maps are pretty much Java Script objects.

23
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.040
They're not JavaScript objects but
they are Java Script objects, right?

24
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.896
And so basically a key value is to us, so

25
00:01:37.896 --> 00:01:40.840
we'd use something like a map
[INAUDIBLE] do more things in it.

26
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.604
So you can say user, and the UID is 123.

27
00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:48.703
I'm gonna regret all of this in a little
bit when I have real users, but

28
00:01:48.703 --> 00:01:49.687
it'll be fine.

29
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:57.373
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, and so you can
have maps, you can also go ahead and

30
00:01:57.373 --> 00:02:00.640
you can have arrays are kind of cheating.

31
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.838
They're basically just maps
where the value is true, and

32
00:02:03.838 --> 00:02:06.646
arrays are really hard
with concurrency cuz yeah,

33
00:02:06.646 --> 00:02:10.515
I wanna get the third thing of that array,
that could change, right?

34
00:02:10.515 --> 00:02:14.013
And so it’s really just keys and
values under the hood, null,

35
00:02:14.013 --> 00:02:17.716
pretty straightforward,
a time stamp we’ll see in a little bit.

36
00:02:17.716 --> 00:02:22.452
We saw that arrow we had before,
reference [INAUDIBLE] and geopoint,

37
00:02:22.452 --> 00:02:23.930
which is kinda cool.

38
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.740
So let's start with this, so
we'll save this in the database.

39
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.970
You see I have a post collection and now
I have this very first document in here.

40
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.610
And let's go back to my app,
and we'll hit Refresh.

41
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.860
And you can see that I have the data,
and I have the ID,

42
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.240
and it fetched it from the database,
which is pretty great.
