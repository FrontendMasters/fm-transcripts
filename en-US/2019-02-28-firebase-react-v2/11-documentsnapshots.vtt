&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So QuerySnapshots hold
onto a number of QueryDocumentSnapshots,

2
00:00:04.235 --> 00:00:07.815
which inherit from DocumentSnapshot,
that's a mouthful.

3
00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:10.170
Let's talk about DocumentSnapshots
before we go on there, as well.

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.959
They have an id, that is the individual
id of that document, whether or

5
00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:14.788
not it exists.

6
00:00:14.788 --> 00:00:19.809
Cuz you could theoretically go to
a document id that does not exist,

7
00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:22.285
in a database, and query for it.

8
00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:25.850
It'll be empty, that might be useful for
making a new document.

9
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.320
So when we create new posts,
we're gonna be like, hey,

10
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.183
just assign me a new id, whatever,
just generate one for me.

11
00:00:35.183 --> 00:00:40.030
But when we start storing user profiles
later, we have a user id, right,

12
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.250
we already know the id that we wanna use,
right?

13
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.282
So we might check in that point, to see,
hey, do I already have a profile for

14
00:00:47.282 --> 00:00:48.923
this user that just logged in?

15
00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:52.681
If so, I don't need to make one, right,
but if there's not one in there,

16
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:56.161
then I wanna make one, so
we'll use exists at one point today, too.

17
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:59.216
metadata and ref, remember,
we talked about before,

18
00:00:59.216 --> 00:01:01.950
ref is the reference to
that spot in the database.

19
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.282
This is the data, we're looking for
the location in the database,

20
00:01:05.282 --> 00:01:07.098
if we needed to go back and find that.

21
00:01:07.098 --> 00:01:09.750
We'll also be using that towards
the end of this workshop, as well.

22
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.978
The methods are a little bit
more important, in this case.

23
00:01:13.978 --> 00:01:16.989
data() will get you back all
of the fields on the object,

24
00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:19.950
.get() will get you back
a single field on the object.

25
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.198
So if you say, .get first name, you
will get the first name property on that

26
00:01:25.198 --> 00:01:30.203
object, should it exist, and
isEqual() is useful for comparisons.

27
00:01:30.203 --> 00:01:34.780
All right, so
that was our taking our vegetables

28
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.253
with QuerySnapshots and DocumentSnapshots.

29
00:01:39.253 --> 00:01:41.540
Let's go ahead and
play with this a little bit.
