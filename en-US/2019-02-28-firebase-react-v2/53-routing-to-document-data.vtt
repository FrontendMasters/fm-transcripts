1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.000
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's in the URL.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.703
I need to get at it, right.

3
00:00:04.703 --> 00:00:08.520
It's not a prop or anything like that yet.

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.370
We need to figure out how to get that.

5
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.370
React Router has a high order component
called withRouter that will take all of

6
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.450
this route information and
pass it in as props to a given component.

7
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.760
So we'll go ahead and we'll grab that.

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.999
So we'll go back to our PostPage, and

9
00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:33.762
we'll say, import withRouter.

10
00:00:37.898 --> 00:00:41.705
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And this is not
dissimilar from the used context concept,

11
00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:42.252
right?

12
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.086
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: react-router-dom and
all I have to do is wrap this component,

13
00:00:55.257 --> 00:00:56.648
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: withRouter.

14
00:00:56.648 --> 00:00:57.870
And what withRouter does, and

15
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.267
we'll actually write a high
order component in a second, so

16
00:01:00.267 --> 00:01:03.276
if this is black magic to you, we will
dispel the black magic in a little bit.

17
00:01:03.276 --> 00:01:05.734
We're gonna create one of these
called with user in a little bit.

18
00:01:05.734 --> 00:01:08.850
That will like basically use
our abstraction from before and

19
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.330
create the same basic concepts so
we can also pass the user in here for

20
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.694
when they make comments.

21
00:01:13.694 --> 00:01:15.220
But let's go with it for now.

22
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:24.457
Let's go ahead and
let's just say console.log(this.props).

23
00:01:30.313 --> 00:01:31.625
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: These are the props.

24
00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:35.480
You can see there is a history which
is the browser history API for

25
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.992
routing back and forth.

26
00:01:36.992 --> 00:01:41.127
The current location,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right,

27
00:01:41.127 --> 00:01:44.410
it's got the given path name and
stuff like that.

28
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.739
Match is the one we care about.

29
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.250
Because if you look at params,
look at that right there.

30
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.870
That's my post ID.

31
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.293
I got it, right?

32
00:01:54.293 --> 00:01:58.526
So we can use that now to
fetch the post from Firebase.

33
00:02:01.148 --> 00:02:03.960
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, so let's just
go ahead and just to make a point.

34
00:02:16.716 --> 00:02:22.125
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: this.props,
we'll say, match.params.id.

35
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:29.853
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, there it is.

36
00:02:29.853 --> 00:02:32.150
Now we know that we can
get it in the component.

37
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.682
My job now is to grab that prop, hook into
Firebase, subscribe to that document,

38
00:02:37.682 --> 00:02:41.609
also get its comments cuz
that's a sub collection right,

39
00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.260
subscribe to those as well.

40
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.501
And hold on to the references so
that we can add comments there, right?

41
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.914
And that will be determined by the URL,

42
00:02:50.914 --> 00:02:54.583
which will tell us what to
subscribe to and unsubscribe to.

43
00:02:54.583 --> 00:02:57.810
Awesome, I feel good about this.

44
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.490
All right,
let's give ourselves some helpers.

45
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.390
So we're gonna say get postId
cuz I don't like typing.

46
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.060
He says, hours into this, match.params.id.

47
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.200
So there's our postId.

48
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.202
Now we can just say this.postId from here
on out, which feels a lot better for me.

49
00:03:24.202 --> 00:03:29.692
We'll say this .postRef, this.get postRef,

50
00:03:29.692 --> 00:03:34.142
which is just gonna build on top of that.

51
00:03:34.142 --> 00:03:38.595
And it's gonna return firestore.doc,

52
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.855
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: posts/.

53
00:03:45.855 --> 00:03:48.377
Also, in the storage when you
saw me use child, child, child,

54
00:03:48.377 --> 00:03:51.210
child, child, that's cuz I was
layering a lot of variables in there.

55
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.260
I could have done ref and done the same
thing I'm doing with this doc as well.

56
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.265
That would have totally worked.

57
00:03:56.265 --> 00:03:58.090
I just chose not to.

58
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.407
So we'll do the this.postId, right,
which is now based on this one.

59
00:04:02.407 --> 00:04:04.146
So that we're not typing
all of that in there,

60
00:04:04.146 --> 00:04:06.523
we're kind of just building up
the things that we need slowly.

61
00:04:06.523 --> 00:04:11.572
And with a ref, you can always extend
a ref so we can also say this.commentsRef.

62
00:04:14.063 --> 00:04:17.505
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Is return this.postRef.

63
00:04:17.505 --> 00:04:18.124
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So you can see,

64
00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:20.229
each one of these is kind of
building on the last one.

65
00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.270
.collection('comments').

66
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.590
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, so this is
really slash post, slash that post ID,

67
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.150
slash comments.

68
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.914
Right, we're kind of building each one up.

69
00:04:31.914 --> 00:04:36.836
And now we can get to the document itself,
as well as its sub-collection,

70
00:04:36.836 --> 00:04:38.884
and have both available to us.

71
00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:51.345
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll have
the ability to unsubscribeFromPost,

72
00:04:51.345 --> 00:04:53.419
unsubscribeFromComments.

73
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.125
And we just define them here.

74
00:04:57.125 --> 00:05:00.522
I think there's two reasons, one,
technically it's like a V8 performance

75
00:05:00.522 --> 00:05:03.520
thing, which is that we know
the shape of the object.

76
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.400
V8 can make performance optimizations
over dynamically defining properties.

77
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.700
I also like it cuz I feel like it
documents what's actually on this class.

78
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.008
Rare that a performance
tweak actually helps.

79
00:05:20.682 --> 00:05:25.256
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
so when the component mounts,

80
00:05:25.256 --> 00:05:33.909
we're gonna say this.unsubscribeFromPost
= this.postRef.onSnapshot.

81
00:05:40.155 --> 00:05:41.338
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: const post.

82
00:05:46.103 --> 00:05:48.467
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's get that
in a way that react likes.

83
00:05:48.467 --> 00:05:55.012
Then we'll this.setState({ post }).

84
00:05:55.012 --> 00:06:02.631
Let's do, copy that and
we'll say comments,

85
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:10.237
commentsRef,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: comments,

86
00:06:10.237 --> 00:06:13.666
this is actually gonna
have to do a map now,

87
00:06:13.666 --> 00:06:17.303
snapshot, because this
is an array of them.

88
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.939
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so this
will go ahead and subscribe to both and

89
00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:32.440
on component will unmount.

90
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.890
We will unsubscribe from the post,

91
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.680
cuz this one, they could very well
navigate away from this page.

92
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.740
We do need to clean up.

93
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.000
For instance, when we're doing it in the
application component, or in the providers

94
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.916
that were always alive, that was just
being responsible and good citizens.

95
00:06:47.916 --> 00:06:51.157
And you should totally do that, cuz you
never know how the refactoring goes.

96
00:06:51.157 --> 00:06:52.289
But in this case,

97
00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:57.230
we know that the user is gonna
navigate away from an individual post.

98
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.692
So we need to clean up our
listeners in this case.

99
00:07:00.692 --> 00:07:03.151
But we should always clean
up our listeners, it's fine.

100
00:07:03.151 --> 00:07:07.030
All right, awesome, so
we have both these in place.

101
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:13.501
Let's actually just see if we
can go into the react tools.

102
00:07:13.501 --> 00:07:14.485
I'll see what I can do with this.

103
00:07:20.112 --> 00:07:25.170
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Go into the post page, so
you can see the state, we've got the post.

104
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.080
We have all the data about the post.

105
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.950
Comments is an array of zero items,

106
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:36.350
which makes total sense,
we haven't made a comment yet, right?

107
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:41.236
So I'm not totally surprised by that.

108
00:07:41.236 --> 00:07:45.846
But looks like we have everything
we need from Firebase as

109
00:07:45.846 --> 00:07:48.736
it's happening, which is great.

110
00:07:48.736 --> 00:07:53.469
Okay, now we actually just need a,
like a real UI.

111
00:07:53.469 --> 00:08:00.795
So we'll say const post
comments equals this.state.

112
00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:10.767
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll return,
let's call it section.

113
00:08:10.767 --> 00:08:16.864
And,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If you have the post,

114
00:08:16.864 --> 00:08:18.031
show me a post.

115
00:08:24.085 --> 00:08:28.842
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,
and show the Comments.

116
00:08:38.558 --> 00:08:40.569
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Comment the,

117
00:08:51.375 --> 00:08:53.094
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: onCreate.

118
00:08:53.094 --> 00:08:54.158
We'll leave that blank for now.

119
00:08:57.102 --> 00:09:00.001
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So let's see if
we can get everything on the page.

120
00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:02.241
That should do the trick.

121
00:09:06.015 --> 00:09:09.550
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Did not like that so
I'll just put an empty meth in there for

122
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.293
now just make sure it loads.

123
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.462
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's skip that for
a second.

124
00:09:24.393 --> 00:09:26.512
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,
so we can see the post.
