00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.400
&gt;&gt; Steve: What I want you to try now,

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.650
is we saw that we can look
at the given resource.

3
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:12.420
What we wanna do, is we wanna make sure
that the title is not null, right?

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.301
So we saw that, if we look at our rules,
&gt;&gt; Steve: We know that we

5
00:00:19.301 --> 00:00:24.580
can look at the resource, and then we have
the request resource is the one coming in.

6
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.990
We know how to check if
something's not null on creation,

7
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.420
or really, any right if you wanted to,
but let's go with creation.

8
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.180
On creation, we want to make
sure that the title is not null,

9
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.000
otherwise we will reject it
coming into the database.
