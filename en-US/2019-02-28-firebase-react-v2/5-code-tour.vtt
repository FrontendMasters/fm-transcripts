00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.225
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So I have an application,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Called Think Piece,

2
00:00:05.225 --> 00:00:08.960
that's linked to in the notes and
in the workshop.

3
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.020
And Think Piece will eventually
be a live blogging platform for

4
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.330
all of your hottest takes,
and stuff along those lines.

5
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.350
And we can fire it up with npm start.

6
00:00:32.742 --> 00:00:34.700
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Give that
one second to fire up.

7
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.074
And right at this moment, it is a very
plain create-react-app application there.

8
00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:43.280
We're gonna take a look at
the code in a second, but

9
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.150
there's not really a lot
of surprises in there.

10
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.631
But we can go ahead and

11
00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:56.828
put in My Fancy new Thoughts on Bacon.

12
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:01.944
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's still kind of okay.

13
00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.600
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Add it,
and there it is, right?

14
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.730
Nothing really special,
it's baby's first React app.

15
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:10.761
We'll take a tour of the code.

16
00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:25.357
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We've

17
00:01:25.357 --> 00:01:29.146
got our index.js which is loading
the application component.

18
00:01:31.728 --> 00:01:36.382
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Application component
right now has just some Component state,

19
00:01:36.382 --> 00:01:40.527
which are the two posts that
you saw on there, some stars,

20
00:01:40.527 --> 00:01:43.650
some content, so on and so forth.

21
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.001
We can go ahead.
We have that handleCreate,

22
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.310
where you saw me creating a new post.

23
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.620
And we basically render that with a post
component that has, we go into posts.

24
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.300
You can see that has
the AddPost component.

25
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.485
I'll let you venture a guess on what that
does, and it renders all of the posts.

26
00:02:02.485 --> 00:02:06.999
At this point right now, Star and
Delete don't actually do anything,

27
00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.720
just the ability to create a post.

28
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.860
So again,
a very kind of standard React app.

29
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.500
If the other files in here
stress you out there,

30
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.339
they're just kinda
presentational components.

31
00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:21.972
So we're not writing a whole bunch
of UI code as we're go ahead and

32
00:02:21.972 --> 00:02:25.223
learning fancy state management and
learning Firebase.

33
00:02:25.223 --> 00:02:27.700
There's just some very basic,

34
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.469
like the SignIn component is a form
where you put in an email and

35
00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:37.350
a password, and there's a Sign In button,
so on and so forth.

36
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.420
Those are kinda just pre-built for
us to use as we go along.
