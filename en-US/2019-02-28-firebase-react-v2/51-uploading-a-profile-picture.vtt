00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.050
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm willing to live
code for hours in front of all y'all.

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.970
I'm not willing to live
Google image search.

3
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.142
So that's a thing.

4
00:00:08.142 --> 00:00:13.071
So what we'll do is we're gonna take,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We're gonna get real

5
00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:13.910
meta here.

6
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.726
We're gonna take a screenshot of the app.

7
00:00:19.726 --> 00:00:21.934
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,
we'll choose a file.

8
00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:22.957
Moment of truth here.

9
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:28.550
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we can change.

10
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.550
We uploaded a file to a bucket.

11
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.820
We replaced the photo URL in
the Firestore document, right?

12
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.690
So two things happened there,
uploaded a file, saved it in a bucket,

13
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.300
replaced the photo URL in the user
profile, which is now editable.

14
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.210
So now we have this ability to kind
of bring together multiple services,

15
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.240
which is really awesome.
