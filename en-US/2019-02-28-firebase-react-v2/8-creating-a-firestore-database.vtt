00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.340
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: What we'll do real
quick is we need to go ahead and

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.620
turn on our database.

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.772
So we'll go back to the Firebase console,
and we'll go to Database.

4
00:00:11.772 --> 00:00:16.441
And this is kinda what I said before,
Cloud Firestore is definitely in beta.

5
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:21.415
But if you look at the screen right now,
what is Google trying to push on you?

6
00:00:24.071 --> 00:00:26.352
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: They have strong opinions
on what database you ought to use.

7
00:00:26.352 --> 00:00:30.496
If you scroll down,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: [LAUGH] Or

8
00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:35.760
alternatively, choose the real
time database, right.

9
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.740
But they definitely have tried to sell you
on the Cloud Firestore first and foremost.

10
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.070
And so
that's what we're going to go with today.

11
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.890
So we'll go ahead and
we'll create database.

12
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.905
And we have two choices, the responsible
choice and the irresponsible choice.

13
00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:56.580
We are going to choose the irresponsible
choice because we're learning.

14
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.830
So start in locked mode.

15
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.350
So locked mode basically,
the database is on complete lockdown,

16
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.160
you can't do anything to it, right.

17
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.416
Which is generally speaking, whitelisting
is better than blacklisting, totally.

18
00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:13.490
And we will eventually go to
something closer to locked mode, but

19
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.470
first we're gonna start in test mode.

20
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.670
Test mode is wide open, anyone can do
anything anywhere in the database.

21
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.320
Now you should not push
to production like this.

22
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.992
However, on local host
you're probably safe, right.

23
00:01:28.992 --> 00:01:32.662
So we'll go ahead and
we'll enable it in test mode.

24
00:01:35.393 --> 00:01:37.223
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Setting
up our security rules,

25
00:01:37.223 --> 00:01:40.420
which are almost like a lack
thereof of security rules.

26
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.298
And we have our database,
there's not much in it yet,

27
00:01:46.298 --> 00:01:49.750
which make sense, we just created it.

28
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.170
Let's actually wire it into
our React application.

29
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.510
So to do that, we will flip back over.

30
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.460
And we're gonna pull in the code for
Firestore.

31
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.650
So we'll import Firebase slash Firestore,
right.

32
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.140
If we pulled in all of Firebase
we would've gotten Firestore, but

33
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.870
we would've also gotten all the code for
working with the real time database.

34
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.670
Chances are we're not using both, right.

35
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.410
There's actually nothing stopping you from
using both, other than your own sanity.

36
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.559
So we can import Firestore, and

37
00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:29.157
then what I'll usually do is
I'll go a head and I'll do,

38
00:02:29.157 --> 00:02:35.943
export const firestore = firebase,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

39
00:02:35.943 --> 00:02:37.760
it calls it as a function like that.

40
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.442
All right, so now we've got Firebase and
we have a database.

41
00:02:43.442 --> 00:02:46.832
That was it, right, we're good to go.

42
00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:51.349
We're not actually calling this file
anywhere yet, so let's go ahead and

43
00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.224
do that in application.jsx.

44
00:02:55.342 --> 00:03:00.613
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Here I
will simply do import

45
00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:04.509
{ firestore } from

46
00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:11.392
'../firebase', all right.

47
00:03:11.392 --> 00:03:13.000
Go back over to my application.

48
00:03:17.253 --> 00:03:19.294
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Firestore is defined but
not used,

49
00:03:19.294 --> 00:03:23.520
that makes total sense because we are in
fact defining it but not using it.
