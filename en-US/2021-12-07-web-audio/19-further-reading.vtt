00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.984
In the repo I've got
tons of other links here.

2
00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:10.519
There's a few GitHub pages that also
collect lots of links around Web Audio and

3
00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.590
one of the,
if we go to awesome-web-audio here.

4
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.940
One of the things worth highlighting
maybe is some of the resources here.

5
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.738
One of the great ones is
the Web Audio weekly newsletter,

6
00:00:25.738 --> 00:00:28.790
pretty much every week or more or less.

7
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:35.334
I think it's Chris, yeah, Chris Lewis
is putting out these newsletters around

8
00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:41.000
Web Audio and what's happening
in sort of the Web Audio space.

9
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.870
And if you're interested in Web Audio and

10
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.600
just continuing to explore this,
it's this really vast space.

11
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.821
And Chris has been putting together
links in terms of finding all the things

12
00:00:52.821 --> 00:00:55.320
on the web that are happening here.

13
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.314
And there's tons,

14
00:00:56.314 --> 00:00:59.772
it's hard to just encompass all
the different work that's going on.

15
00:00:59.772 --> 00:01:05.099
Because what I've been exploring today is
much more on the visualization side and

16
00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.585
sort of synthesis and
sort of maybe the more art side.

17
00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:13.868
But then there's a lot of tools
in terms of MIDI sequencers and

18
00:01:13.868 --> 00:01:16.814
in terms of DJ tools and VJ tools and

19
00:01:16.814 --> 00:01:21.095
modular synthesis tools
happening with the web.

20
00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:25.276
And it really is this massive rabbit
hole that I feel I've just been very

21
00:01:25.276 --> 00:01:27.376
gently scratching the surface of.

22
00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:31.334
So I would definitely recommend
checking out some of these links and

23
00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:35.650
just diving into to seeing what else
there is within this Web Audio space.
