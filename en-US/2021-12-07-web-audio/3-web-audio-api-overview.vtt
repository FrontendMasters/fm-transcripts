00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.390
Little bit about the Web Audio API itself,
what it is, how it sort of works.

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.196
I like to think of it as if you're
a somebody had a switchboard maybe,.

3
00:00:08.196 --> 00:00:11.964
And you've got all these wires and
you're taking them from one place and

4
00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:14.370
you're putting them into another place.

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.127
All of a sudden you have to
change the signal, unplug it and

6
00:00:17.127 --> 00:00:18.620
plug it in somewhere else.

7
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.700
You're basically just rerouting
the signal from one source to another.

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.097
And with Web Audio it's kind of similar.

9
00:00:25.097 --> 00:00:28.167
We're given these little
nodes that are kind of like

10
00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:30.131
Lego building blocks for audio.

11
00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:34.291
It might be something like a microphone
node which is an audio node and

12
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:37.742
that's going to give us
the signal from our microphone.

13
00:00:37.742 --> 00:00:41.732
And then we're gonna have maybe
a speaker like a destination node so

14
00:00:41.732 --> 00:00:42.996
that's the output.

15
00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:45.847
And by just wiring those
two things together,

16
00:00:45.847 --> 00:00:49.648
we can go from a microphone to
a speaker and basically have it so

17
00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:54.056
that anything we put through
the microphone is emitted by the speaker.

18
00:00:54.056 --> 00:00:56.809
Or instead of using
a microphone as a source,

19
00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.235
we can use an MP3 file or a WAV file or
some sort of media asset basically.

20
00:01:02.925 --> 00:01:05.875
Here's a little bit more of
a complicated graph here.

21
00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:10.304
This would be taking your MP3 file,
wiring it through an effect,

22
00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:14.640
like maybe a delay, or
some sort of distortion or reverb.

23
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.988
And then continuing along and
wiring that through to the speaker so

24
00:01:18.988 --> 00:01:21.168
that we have some sort of effect.

25
00:01:21.168 --> 00:01:25.069
Or a typical thing that we do
when we're visualizing audio,

26
00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:29.910
is that we split it up like this
where we are analyzing the MP3 file.

27
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.832
And at the same time, we're also
giving the MP3 file some effects and

28
00:01:33.832 --> 00:01:35.970
then outputting that to the speaker.

29
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.830
And just the other way around is totally
possible as well where you have many

30
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.972
things directed into a single node.

31
00:01:43.972 --> 00:01:48.644
So a good example of this is when you have
lots of layered sounds to create a really

32
00:01:48.644 --> 00:01:53.320
rich and dynamic atmosphere, but
then you wanna have one master node.

33
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.045
Something that is able to control the gain
and control the volume for all of those

34
00:01:57.045 --> 00:02:00.613
things that you're putting into it and
so that's how that might look here.
