1
00:00:00.251 --> 00:00:04.739
So I'll just start with talking about
myself a little bit, just sort of to put

2
00:00:04.739 --> 00:00:09.452
this into context, what kind of work I'm
doing and why I'm interested in this.

3
00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:12.560
So I'm an artist living in London,
I'm from Canada.

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.544
And I've been coding creatively,
I guess you could say for many years for

5
00:00:16.544 --> 00:00:17.454
several years.

6
00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:22.239
And in the last maybe seven or
eight years I've been interested in

7
00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:27.811
generative art specifically, but
always in a sort of wide array of things.

8
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:31.150
So it always looks kind of like this,
the kind of work that I'm interested in.

9
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.245
Where on one side we have some code and
on the other, we have some sort of output.

10
00:00:35.245 --> 00:00:36.733
Typically it's images, but

11
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:41.860
a lot of the work I've been doing has also
been audio based or audio visually based.

12
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.573
So, most of it is really sketching,
sort of just creating imagery,

13
00:00:46.573 --> 00:00:50.577
creating prints sometimes
Animation sometimes as well.

14
00:00:50.577 --> 00:00:55.671
And also sometimes bringing that into
like more physical tangible space for

15
00:00:55.671 --> 00:01:00.859
example using mechanical pen plotters
like this or creating work like this.

16
00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.378
And for those of you who might have seen
my work in the other front end masters

17
00:01:05.378 --> 00:01:05.966
course.

18
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.870
I've been talking quite a lot
about creative coding and

19
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.770
generative art and how to use code
to produce these kinds of images.

20
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.748
But today I wanted to talk a little bit
more about audio and get into that.

21
00:01:17.748 --> 00:01:21.505
But before that I'll just keep
running through some of my work and

22
00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:22.745
this is more recent.

23
00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:27.548
It's just exploring more of these kinds
of forms and shapes and colors, and

24
00:01:27.548 --> 00:01:32.700
trying to put them into this very rich
kind of landscape of work from code.

25
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.084
So this is just me running through
just some of the work I've done.

26
00:01:37.084 --> 00:01:40.109
But now, kind of bringing it
back into context of audio and

27
00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.030
some of the audio visual work I've done.

28
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.606
This was an installation I did in 2019,
which was part of a winter lights

29
00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:52.486
festival in Iceland and it's running on
building and I'll show a little video.

30
00:01:52.486 --> 00:01:56.877
But it's running entirely just with
JavaScript using the Canvas API to render

31
00:01:56.877 --> 00:02:01.110
the graphics, but then using
Web Audio to Play the actual audio.

32
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.685
And the Web Audio that's being used
here is also feeding back into

33
00:02:04.685 --> 00:02:07.223
the visuals that
are happening on the screen.

34
00:02:07.223 --> 00:02:10.761
So it's using a bit of visualization
here as well, I'll just play it.

35
00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:20.761
[MUSIC]

36
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.055
So I like to show that one just because
a lot of times when we think of Web Audio,

37
00:02:56.055 --> 00:02:57.730
we think of just the browser.

38
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.626
But we can also take
the applications we're building and

39
00:03:00.626 --> 00:03:03.836
pull them out of the browser and
put them into a physical space.

40
00:03:03.836 --> 00:03:08.516
Or we can just continue to keep it all in
browser like this game Wayfinder that I

41
00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:10.105
also produced this year.

42
00:03:10.105 --> 00:03:14.984
I developed this with national film
board of Canada and it's using,as you

43
00:03:14.984 --> 00:03:19.954
can see a lot of these rich visuals, but
also a huge part of the game is audio.

44
00:03:19.954 --> 00:03:24.543
And creating these layered ambiance
sort of sounds that are constantly

45
00:03:24.543 --> 00:03:28.684
reacting to your movements and
you hitting objects in the game.

46
00:03:28.684 --> 00:03:31.719
And you interact with different
aspects of the game so

47
00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.150
that's Way finder you can
check that online as well.

48
00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.896
And then bringing it back to some of the
older work that I've done this is audio

49
00:03:39.896 --> 00:03:44.511
graph, this is kind of where my journey
in audio started I guess on the web.

50
00:03:44.511 --> 00:03:47.064
I'll actually just open
the link here to show you.

51
00:03:47.064 --> 00:03:51.947
This was kind of my first foray into like
this kind of space of Web Audio, and

52
00:03:51.947 --> 00:03:54.504
the idea was to create a visualizer very

53
00:03:54.504 --> 00:03:59.171
minimalistic sort of site where all
you need to do is just open the page.

54
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:04.810
And you just hit the space bar,
to load up a track.

55
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.923
[MUSIC]

56
00:04:09.923 --> 00:04:12.889
And then, you can just hit the space
bar again, to load the next track.

57
00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.290
[MUSIC]

58
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.784
And so on, and so forth.

59
00:04:17.784 --> 00:04:21.158
And the artwork is constantly random,
constantly changing and

60
00:04:21.158 --> 00:04:25.105
reacting to the audio that's playing
this pilot priest that's playing.

61
00:04:25.105 --> 00:04:28.864
[MUSIC]

62
00:04:28.864 --> 00:04:33.077
So, that's sort of like a bit of
an overview just a few of the things

63
00:04:33.077 --> 00:04:37.366
I've done related to web audio but
also unrelated to Web Audio I just

64
00:04:37.366 --> 00:04:41.151
wanna show a couple examples
of other work that I've seen.

65
00:04:41.151 --> 00:04:46.032
It's kind of inspiring or interesting or
within this scope of Web Audio.

66
00:04:46.032 --> 00:04:48.972
One of the things I really
love to show all the time

67
00:04:48.972 --> 00:04:53.658
is Jono Brando's Patnitop which is
this really fun website patnitop.com.

68
00:04:53.658 --> 00:04:57.596
The idea here yet, the idea here
is you just smash your keyboard.

69
00:04:57.596 --> 00:05:00.891
[MUSIC]

70
00:05:00.891 --> 00:05:04.597
And it creates this really interesting
sort of audio visual experience,

71
00:05:04.597 --> 00:05:08.241
it's as if you've got a drum kit and
you're not just playing sound, but

72
00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:10.413
also hearing that and seeing that as well.

73
00:05:10.413 --> 00:05:10.913
[MUSIC]

74
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.219
And just one other little funny experiment
that I like to show as well with

75
00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:22.814
web audio is blob opera by Google arts and
culture developed by David Lee.

76
00:05:22.814 --> 00:05:28.140
And this is using Web Audio to its
fullest really where of course there's

77
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.480
a lot of this 3D Web GL sort of beautiful
visuals and physics and things.

78
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.537
But it's synthesizing audio
here in real time and

79
00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:41.410
allowing you to manipulate
it in a very fun way.

80
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:51.410
[MUSIC]

81
00:05:56.866 --> 00:05:59.482
Yeah, so
that's really fun to play with but

82
00:05:59.482 --> 00:06:04.234
also just like such a technical marvel
that they were able to create something.

83
00:06:04.234 --> 00:06:09.162
That is really powerful just from
this Web audio API just synthesizing

84
00:06:09.162 --> 00:06:11.010
audio as if it's a voice.
