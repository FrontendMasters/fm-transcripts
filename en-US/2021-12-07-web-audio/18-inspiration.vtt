1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.076
I'll end on like a note
that's kinda talking about

2
00:00:05.076 --> 00:00:09.450
where you could go with this kind of work.

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.429
So again, so far, most of what we've been
doing has just been demos of p5.js and

4
00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.282
just looking at it through a web browser
on our computers or maybe on our phones.

5
00:00:19.282 --> 00:00:23.740
But one of the nice things with
the web is that it's really flexible.

6
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.718
And you can use it for
something just as simple as

7
00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:31.190
a webpage that you show a friend or
you show a link to the world.

8
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.814
But you can also use this technology for
installation purposes or, for

9
00:00:35.814 --> 00:00:38.444
something that has a larger scale to it.

10
00:00:38.444 --> 00:00:43.297
An example of that is some
of the work by Ryoji Ikeda.

11
00:00:43.297 --> 00:00:51.180
He's not using Web Audio, he would be
using probably much more robust hardware.

12
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.180
But I think a lot of what he's
doing is achievable with Web Audio.

13
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.297
And especially if you're
just starting in this space,

14
00:00:58.297 --> 00:01:01.627
you might want to just start
with something like Web Audio.

15
00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:05.536
Which is very accessible to be able to
produce these kind of outputs in these

16
00:01:05.536 --> 00:01:06.785
kinds of experiences.

17
00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:10.950
Maybe on a smaller scale, maybe not at
the scale that he's working at, but

18
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.075
some of his work is really fantastic.

19
00:01:13.075 --> 00:01:16.334
He recently had an exhibition in London,

20
00:01:16.334 --> 00:01:21.549
where the entire space was just
multiple rooms that he transformed

21
00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.500
into these very emotional kinda
acoustic sound experiences.

22
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.417
And not really like music,
just like noise, but

23
00:01:29.417 --> 00:01:33.347
like interesting noise tied to visuals,
so here's an example.

24
00:01:40.781 --> 00:01:45.463
&gt;&gt; The transnet was possibly one
of the most ambitious projects

25
00:01:45.463 --> 00:01:48.228
that we produced with Ryoji Ikeda.

26
00:01:48.228 --> 00:01:53.323
We've worked for the first ten years,
former can producing his

27
00:01:53.323 --> 00:01:59.028
projects around the world it was artistic
&gt;&gt; Just gonna skip forward a bit,

28
00:01:59.028 --> 00:02:02.892
so he really experiments
with this kind of noise,

29
00:02:02.892 --> 00:02:08.307
this kind of clicking and topping and
&gt;&gt; As I really knew that he was the right.

30
00:02:08.307 --> 00:02:14.273
&gt;&gt; Visualizing that in scale and
some sort of abstract graphic way and

31
00:02:14.273 --> 00:02:21.319
it's quite impactful and quite powerful
to be in these spaces that he sets up.

32
00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.576
And that he defines, with his visuals, but

33
00:02:25.576 --> 00:02:30.534
also with his his sound effects and
compositions.

34
00:02:30.534 --> 00:02:36.830
Another artists that's kind of working in
this space in a different way, is Nonotak.

35
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.380
It's two artists that are working
together to create these

36
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.040
really impressive,
audio visual experiences.

37
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.944
They tend to use a lot of
projection mapping techniques,

38
00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:57.233
or projecting through screens,
or using lasers,

39
00:02:57.233 --> 00:03:01.172
or using similar types of like light.

40
00:03:01.172 --> 00:03:09.404
To create these really rich and

41
00:03:09.404 --> 00:03:14.471
interesting, and

42
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:18.903
exciting sort of

43
00:03:18.903 --> 00:03:23.969
performances just

44
00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:29.351
using their music,

45
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:34.099
but then tied with

46
00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:41.082
visualizations of that.

47
00:03:41.082 --> 00:03:48.805
[MUSIC]

48
00:03:48.805 --> 00:03:51.597
So one of the reasons I
like to show Nonotak and

49
00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:56.533
Ryoji Ikeda's work is because it's very
primitive in terms of the rendering.

50
00:03:56.533 --> 00:04:00.551
It's quite often just rectangles,
lines, circles, simple shapes, but

51
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:03.142
overlapping and
combined in interesting ways.

52
00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:07.180
And then tied in a very precise way to
the sounds that are being played and

53
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.900
that's kind of one of the things
I think is really powerful here.

54
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.708
Is that even if you're
using simple shapes and

55
00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:18.542
simple graphics like what we've been
doing scoring today with just using p5.

56
00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:20.583
And just using rectangles and circles,

57
00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:23.591
you can still produce these
really powerful experiences.

58
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:28.103
And with these kinds of works,
it's quite often through projecting, or

59
00:04:28.103 --> 00:04:32.300
projection mapping, or
just rendering it at a large scale.

60
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.100
But it's something that you can
explore just with p5 yourself.

61
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.780
Because these tools are giving you the
access to be able to create these kinds of

62
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.800
experiences from software perspective.

63
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.288
And just one other source of inspiration
that this one's a little bit older,

64
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:52.567
but it feels like something that
could have been made even today.

65
00:04:52.567 --> 00:04:55.916
Or something that we could
have been exploring for

66
00:04:55.916 --> 00:05:01.270
these kinds of courses where we're
exploring audio visual representations.

67
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.157
I'm not sure,

68
00:05:05.157 --> 00:05:13.529
I don't think this one is coded,

69
00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:18.014
but it definitely

70
00:05:18.014 --> 00:05:23.396
feels like it has some

71
00:05:23.396 --> 00:05:29.376
elements of code to it,

72
00:05:29.376 --> 00:05:37.456
some elements of an algorithm.

73
00:05:37.456 --> 00:05:39.856
[MUSIC]

74
00:05:39.856 --> 00:05:44.977
So yeah really beautiful just audio
visualization very poetic feeling and

75
00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:47.506
very, very lovely to watch and see.

76
00:05:47.506 --> 00:05:52.409
So that's sort of some of the inspiration
some of the things I like to

77
00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:56.107
show just to show where you
could go with these kinds

78
00:05:56.107 --> 00:05:59.645
of ideas if you were to
continue to develop them.

79
00:05:59.645 --> 00:06:05.609
And maybe eventually show them on like a
larger scale to a larger audience outside

80
00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:10.710
of the scope of just the browser and
just your phone or your computer.
