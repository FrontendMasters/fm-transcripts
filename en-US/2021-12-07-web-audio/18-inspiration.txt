>> I'll end on like a note that's kinda talking about where you could go with this kind of work. So again, so far, most of what we've been doing has just been demos of p5.js and just looking at it through a web browser on our computers or maybe on our phones.

[00:00:19]
But one of the nice things with the web is that it's really flexible. And you can use it for something just as simple as a webpage that you show a friend or you show a link to the world. But you can also use this technology for installation purposes or, for something that has a larger scale to it.

[00:00:38]
An example of that is some of the work by Ryoji Ikeda. He's not using Web Audio, he would be using probably much more robust hardware. But I think a lot of what he's doing is achievable with Web Audio. And especially if you're just starting in this space, you might want to just start with something like Web Audio.

[00:01:01]
Which is very accessible to be able to produce these kind of outputs in these kinds of experiences. Maybe on a smaller scale, maybe not at the scale that he's working at, but some of his work is really fantastic. He recently had an exhibition in London, where the entire space was just multiple rooms that he transformed into these very emotional kinda acoustic sound experiences.

[00:01:26]
And not really like music, just like noise, but like interesting noise tied to visuals, so here's an example.
>> The transnet was possibly one of the most ambitious projects that we produced with Ryoji Ikeda. We've worked for the first ten years, former can producing his projects around the world it was artistic

[00:01:56]

>> Just gonna skip forward a bit, so he really experiments with this kind of noise, this kind of clicking and topping and
>> As I really knew that he was the right.
>> Visualizing that in scale and some sort of abstract graphic way and it's quite impactful and quite powerful to be in these spaces that he sets up.

[00:02:21]
And that he defines, with his visuals, but also with his his sound effects and compositions. Another artists that's kind of working in this space in a different way, is Nonotak. It's two artists that are working together to create these really impressive, audio visual experiences. They tend to use a lot of projection mapping techniques, or projecting through screens, or using lasers, or using similar types of like light.

[00:03:01]
To create these really rich and interesting, and exciting sort of performances just using their music, but then tied with visualizations of that.

[00:03:48]
So one of the reasons I like to show Nonotak and Ryoji Ikeda's work is because it's very primitive in terms of the rendering. It's quite often just rectangles, lines, circles, simple shapes, but overlapping and combined in interesting ways. And then tied in a very precise way to the sounds that are being played and that's kind of one of the things I think is really powerful here.

[00:04:10]
Is that even if you're using simple shapes and simple graphics like what we've been doing scoring today with just using p5. And just using rectangles and circles, you can still produce these really powerful experiences. And with these kinds of works, it's quite often through projecting, or projection mapping, or just rendering it at a large scale.

[00:04:32]
But it's something that you can explore just with p5 yourself. Because these tools are giving you the access to be able to create these kinds of experiences from software perspective. And just one other source of inspiration that this one's a little bit older, but it feels like something that could have been made even today.

[00:04:52]
Or something that we could have been exploring for these kinds of courses where we're exploring audio visual representations. I'm not sure, I don't think this one is coded, but it definitely feels like it has some elements of code to it, some elements of an algorithm.

[00:05:37]
[MUSIC]

[00:05:39]
So yeah really beautiful just audio visualization very poetic feeling and very, very lovely to watch and see. So that's sort of some of the inspiration some of the things I like to show just to show where you could go with these kinds of ideas if you were to continue to develop them.

[00:05:59]
And maybe eventually show them on like a larger scale to a larger audience outside of the scope of just the browser and just your phone or your computer.
