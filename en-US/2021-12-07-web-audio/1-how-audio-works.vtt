00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.050
So first I wanted to run through some of
the basics of how digital audio works and

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.749
how audio works in general.

3
00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:11.056
This is kind of a prerequisite to
understand some of the libraries and

4
00:00:11.056 --> 00:00:14.248
some of the things we're
gonna be using with code,

5
00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:18.183
is to understand how do we really
perceive this kind of audio and

6
00:00:18.183 --> 00:00:22.075
what does it really mean for
sounds to be happening around us.

7
00:00:22.075 --> 00:00:27.288
So when we talk about sound we're talking
about just waves through the air.

8
00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:33.465
And by waves I mean changes in the air
pressure and changes in the air molecules.

9
00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:37.388
So for example, let's say you're listening
to a speaker and the speaker is pumping.

10
00:00:37.388 --> 00:00:42.149
It's going in and out in pumping, and
it's that pumping motion that creates this

11
00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.568
propagation of air molecules through
the air that eventually hit our ears.

12
00:00:46.568 --> 00:00:49.913
And it's sort of undulating and
changing in different ways,

13
00:00:49.913 --> 00:00:51.467
in different frequencies.

14
00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:55.106
Hitting our ears at different times and
things like that.

15
00:00:55.106 --> 00:00:59.753
Another way to visualize this
is this little animation here.

16
00:00:59.753 --> 00:01:03.428
On the left, we have a speaker which is
pumping in and out some sort of music.

17
00:01:03.428 --> 00:01:06.807
You can imagine maybe you're at
a dance club or something and

18
00:01:06.807 --> 00:01:08.606
it's a lot of these kick drums.

19
00:01:08.606 --> 00:01:10.523
And on the right we have an arm and

20
00:01:10.523 --> 00:01:13.511
mechanical arm that's
attached to that motion.

21
00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:17.042
And every time it goes in,
it draws up every time it goes out,

22
00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:18.301
it draws down, etc.

23
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:21.689
And what you end up with is a graph
that looks kind of like a sign wave,

24
00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.549
just going up and
down in this smooth undulating motion.

25
00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.050
And when the speaker's turned off,
there is no more motion there and

26
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.026
so it just draws a straight line in
the middle which means that it's silent.

27
00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:36.732
That's kind of how these sound waves work.

28
00:01:36.732 --> 00:01:42.128
And so when we say the word waveform
we're just talking about this kind

29
00:01:42.128 --> 00:01:48.544
of graph almost this form and the shape of
the wave that we're trying to visualize.

30
00:01:48.544 --> 00:01:51.677
But usually when we think of waveforms,
we think of it more like this.

31
00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:55.176
A music track might be
a couple minutes long.

32
00:01:55.176 --> 00:01:59.372
And so if we take the waveform of this
music track and we zoom it all the way so

33
00:01:59.372 --> 00:02:03.502
that we can see the entire waveform,
it might look like this where you can

34
00:02:03.502 --> 00:02:08.041
clearly see that there's some peaks and
some quiet parts and some loud parts and

35
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:11.043
some different sort of
frequencies going on there.

36
00:02:11.043 --> 00:02:15.831
But at the end of the day even this music
track this long large waveform if you

37
00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:20.315
zoom in close enough it's still just
like the earlier shapes that I was

38
00:02:20.315 --> 00:02:24.346
showing you just a line that's
going up and down on some graph.

39
00:02:24.346 --> 00:02:28.240
The way it works is that
the horizontal axis is time.

40
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.671
So maybe measured in seconds or
milliseconds or

41
00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:33.738
however long your music is.

42
00:02:33.738 --> 00:02:36.124
And the vertical axis is amplitude.

43
00:02:36.124 --> 00:02:41.401
The amplitude refers to the size of
the wave the height of it, how loud it is.

44
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:44.241
So the higher this is,
the louder it'll be.

45
00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:47.963
The closer it is to that straight
line that I was showing earlier,

46
00:02:47.963 --> 00:02:49.459
than the quiet it'll be.

47
00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.859
These values in amplitude always go
from positive one to negative one.

48
00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.471
They don't go really higher or

49
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:58.576
lower than that everything is
normalized into that range.

50
00:02:58.576 --> 00:03:03.339
And the time here I've just put 0 to 1
milliseconds but that's pretty arbitrary

51
00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:07.550
it could be in between you know 50
milliseconds to 51 milliseconds or

52
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.708
it could be measured in nanoseconds or
some other measurement of time.

53
00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:16.579
And again when the line is straight across
on the 0 amplitude it means we have total

54
00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.639
silence we can't hear anything.

55
00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.735
One other concept to understand here
is frequency we're going to be talking

56
00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:26.586
about this when we start to visualize and
try and manipulate the audio.

57
00:03:26.586 --> 00:03:30.762
But sound waves can be either high
frequency which means they change at

58
00:03:30.762 --> 00:03:34.015
a very fast rate, or
they can be low frequency sounds,

59
00:03:34.015 --> 00:03:36.453
which means they changing very slowly.

60
00:03:36.453 --> 00:03:41.494
So that it's as if the speaker is
pumping very slowly or very quickly.

61
00:03:41.494 --> 00:03:46.206
And those two differences will give
us a sort of different perception of

62
00:03:46.206 --> 00:03:47.078
that audio.

63
00:03:47.078 --> 00:03:51.901
So when sound is fluctuating and changing
very rapidly we have a high frequency

64
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:55.701
sound that's perceived by us
as something that's high pitch

65
00:03:55.701 --> 00:03:59.961
like treble like cymbal crashes or
chimes or very high pitch sounds.

66
00:03:59.961 --> 00:04:03.040
Whereas something that's
more like a sub bass,

67
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.817
like a kick drum or
even like a guitar pluck,

68
00:04:05.817 --> 00:04:10.342
those are low frequency sounds that
are changing at a much slower rate.

69
00:04:10.342 --> 00:04:13.030
And that's where we start
to be able to analyze and

70
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.358
start to be able to manipulate
this audio is just by tweaking or

71
00:04:16.358 --> 00:04:19.435
looking at the frequency of
the sound that's coming in.
