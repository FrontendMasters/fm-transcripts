1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.310
Welcome to Web Audio Synthesis and
Visualization.

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.708
My name is Matt DesLauriers and today's
class is gonna be about web audio and

3
00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:10.535
how to use audio in
the browser with JavaScript.

4
00:00:10.535 --> 00:00:14.948
We're gonna be talking quite a lot
about using the library itself,

5
00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:16.193
the web audio API.

6
00:00:16.193 --> 00:00:21.191
Then we're gonna also get into some
other libraries like Tone.js to be

7
00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:24.534
able to help us in a bit
of a more convenient way.

8
00:00:24.534 --> 00:00:29.586
The first part of the workshop is gonna
be just pure JavaScript, pure Web Audio,

9
00:00:29.586 --> 00:00:34.630
some of the lower level concepts, but
also talking about how audio works.

10
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.620
What is digital audio and
sort of the basics of that.

11
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.613
And then in the second part of
the workshop, we're gonna get more into

12
00:00:42.613 --> 00:00:45.862
synthesizing audio,
how to make music just with code and

13
00:00:45.862 --> 00:00:49.671
using libraries like Tone.js to
make things a little bit easier.

14
00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:52.561
So to talk about some of the tools and
libraries, so

15
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:55.193
we're gonna be using
a few different things.

16
00:00:55.193 --> 00:00:59.873
I'm going to show a little bit of Glitch,
we might not end up using it for

17
00:00:59.873 --> 00:01:00.737
the coding.

18
00:01:00.737 --> 00:01:05.044
It'll be there, it's something that
you can always refer to later.

19
00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:08.912
Just for today, just for the sake of
being offline and making sure everything

20
00:01:08.912 --> 00:01:12.901
works properly, I'm gonna be doing most
of the coding without the Internet and

21
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:14.650
just using a local sort of server.

22
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.344
But especially for those of you
who have never used Node.js or

23
00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:21.682
those of you who are kinda
new to local web development,

24
00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:25.894
you might rather use some of
the examples that I've posted on Glitch.

25
00:01:25.894 --> 00:01:28.264
And that's gonna be a place
where you can edit the code,

26
00:01:28.264 --> 00:01:29.790
you can see the results of the code.

27
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.211
You can hear it, and
you can also remix it and

28
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:36.090
sort of build up your own little
sketches in your own little projects.

29
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.165
We're also obviously gonna be using
the Web Audio API which you don't need to

30
00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:45.550
install anything, it's just built
into the browser, it's already there.

31
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.670
And so that's that's gonna allow
us to do all these things.

32
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.990
And then later in the afternoon,
we're gonna be using Tone.js.

33
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.793
And that's gonna be specifically for
synthesizing audio and

34
00:01:55.793 --> 00:01:58.937
using a more convenient,
more helpful library for

35
00:01:58.937 --> 00:02:03.252
playing audio in a way that's using
synths and using musical notes and

36
00:02:03.252 --> 00:02:07.590
things like that and layering them
to create something interesting.

37
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.339
And for rendering, I like to instead of
just looking at a screen with a button

38
00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:17.633
on it or instead of just looking at a
blank page, I like to use p5.js to try and

39
00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:19.440
visualize this in a simple way.

40
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.060
Just with circles, lines,
rectangles, nothing too complicated.

41
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.537
But this might be new to you if you've
never done any sort of creative coding or

42
00:02:27.537 --> 00:02:30.760
you've never done any sort
of graphics programming.

43
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.772
That might be a bit of a new thing and
you might just have to sort of try and

44
00:02:34.772 --> 00:02:35.658
follow along.

45
00:02:35.658 --> 00:02:38.221
Or if you really want to
start from the basics,

46
00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:42.498
I also have that Creative Coding Workshop
with Frontend Masters where you can

47
00:02:42.498 --> 00:02:46.800
learn all about how to draw shapes,
draw those kinda things with Canvas API.

48
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.559
So to start off,
this is where you can go and

49
00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:57.325
just this will be our sort of
home base for the workshop.

50
00:02:57.325 --> 00:03:02.462
It's
github.com/mattdesl/workshop-web-audio.

51
00:03:02.462 --> 00:03:05.205
And this includes all of the notes,

52
00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:10.793
it includes links to the different demos,
which I'll open in a second.

53
00:03:10.793 --> 00:03:16.344
It includes a list of some of the tools
and also links to the API documentation.

54
00:03:16.344 --> 00:03:20.040
Some of the versions I've
just decided to use here.

55
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.724
Also links,

56
00:03:20.724 --> 00:03:25.730
if you're new to JavaScript I have a few
references here that I often suggest.

57
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.014
Presumably I think most of the audience
here is familiar with JavaScript.

58
00:03:30.014 --> 00:03:34.518
It's gonna be very code heavy, I'm gonna
be showing code examples with ES6 and

59
00:03:34.518 --> 00:03:35.590
things like that.

60
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.624
So you might need to be familiar with
JavaScript to really follow along some of

61
00:03:39.624 --> 00:03:42.183
the code examples I'll
be talking about today.

62
00:03:42.183 --> 00:03:43.910
And then also some code snippets.

63
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.403
So a lot of this will just be sort
of taking little bits of code, and

64
00:03:48.403 --> 00:03:53.063
I have a few snippets here that you
can reference instead of having to

65
00:03:53.063 --> 00:03:56.200
always reference it within a big file.

66
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.200
Within a big sketch,
you can just see the snippets here.

67
00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:04.726
And then also just some
further reading here.

68
00:04:04.726 --> 00:04:08.411
And if you go all the way up to the top,
you can go into the source, and

69
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:13.010
you can see all the different demos
that I'm gonna sort of showing here.

70
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.827
And then also you might,
if you wanna run this locally,

71
00:04:17.827 --> 00:04:21.220
you can clone it or download it as a zip.

72
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.276
Or if you're not wanting
to run it locally,

73
00:04:25.276 --> 00:04:27.780
you can just open up these links here.

74
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.970
So I've already got one open here.

75
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.050
This is Web Audio demos and
this one is just showing a few of

76
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.910
the different demos that
are using pure Web Audio.

77
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.406
We'll go in later to some other demos,
like the Tone.js demo,

78
00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.105
that'll be in the afternoon.

79
00:04:43.105 --> 00:04:46.290
But for now, let's just focus on this one.

80
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.138
This is just pure Web Audio, which is
like the lowest level you can get with

81
00:04:50.138 --> 00:04:52.449
this kind of library in
this kind of system.

82
00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.176
This is what's gonna allow
us to play mp3 files,

83
00:04:56.176 --> 00:04:59.918
like this piano track
that's in the background.

84
00:04:59.918 --> 00:05:03.440
[SOUND] Or
some very loud sort of chime sound,

85
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.389
which is played immediately on a tap,
instead of it being sort

86
00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.976
of streamed in the background,
like background music.

87
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.365
And also affecting the audio,
such as changing the volume in real time,

88
00:05:20.365 --> 00:05:22.465
based on some user interaction.

89
00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:28.300
And then we'll talk about visualization.

90
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.099
So visualizing a waveform.

91
00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:38.296
[SOUND] I'll talk about what is a waveform
as well, I'll explain those things.

92
00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:40.072
But I'll just run through these.

93
00:05:40.072 --> 00:05:43.237
[MUSIC]

94
00:05:43.237 --> 00:05:45.724
Just another waveform demo.

95
00:05:45.724 --> 00:05:49.733
And then metering, so just getting
the levels of a track as well.

96
00:05:49.733 --> 00:05:53.399
[MUSIC]

97
00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:57.604
And splitting those levels up into
different frequency bands so that we can

98
00:05:57.604 --> 00:06:01.889
start to analyze the different tones,
whether it's high pitch or low pitch

99
00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:09.616
[MUSIC]

100
00:06:09.616 --> 00:06:14.556
And similar, just listening to kick drums
so that we can start to create these

101
00:06:14.556 --> 00:06:18.891
interesting maybe visualizers
based on electronic type of music.

102
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:22.064
[MUSIC]

103
00:06:22.064 --> 00:06:26.323
Or creating something that's more like
a generative artwork that's ever changing,

104
00:06:26.323 --> 00:06:30.069
something that's a little bit more
calming and more contemplative maybe.

105
00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:35.212
So those are there,
the Web Audio demos, and

106
00:06:35.212 --> 00:06:37.342
we'll come back to that in just a second.

107
00:06:37.342 --> 00:06:39.170
Then I'll go back to this for now.
