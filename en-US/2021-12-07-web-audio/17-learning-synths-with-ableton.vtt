00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.164
So if you're wanting to go down this
rabbit hole of synthesizing audio and

2
00:00:04.164 --> 00:00:06.120
especially synthesizing music.

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.442
That's where you start to wanna learn
a bit more about the things like

4
00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:13.884
the envelope, attack,
decay, sustain, release.

5
00:00:13.884 --> 00:00:18.412
And also how do you actually layer
together these different synths to create

6
00:00:18.412 --> 00:00:20.050
specific types of sounds.

7
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.759
And a really great resource for

8
00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.610
that is learning synths by Ableton, and

9
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.317
I have the links in the the course repo as

10
00:00:33.317 --> 00:00:38.468
well at the bottom and the resources page.

11
00:00:38.468 --> 00:00:44.936
And it's a really fantastic online
digital book very interactive,

12
00:00:44.936 --> 00:00:52.632
[SOUND] and showing some of the ideas that
I've talked about in terms of amplitude,

13
00:00:52.632 --> 00:00:58.877
[SOUND] in terms of frequency and
things like that and pitch [SOUND] and

14
00:00:58.877 --> 00:01:03.895
then also going into details
about how to use all these

15
00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:10.727
things [SOUND] to create really rich
sounding electronics synthesizer.

16
00:01:10.727 --> 00:01:20.727
[SOUND].

17
00:01:21.808 --> 00:01:26.697
So I'll just go straight to a certain
chapter, let's just see here.

18
00:01:26.697 --> 00:01:30.447
[SOUND].

19
00:01:30.447 --> 00:01:33.731
You can start to see
some of these demos here.

20
00:01:33.731 --> 00:01:38.000
They reproduce the old
school service analogue

21
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.694
synths that you might use
if you're a musician But,

22
00:01:42.694 --> 00:01:48.685
using just entirely digital
Web Audio API sort of structure here.

23
00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:54.873
Giving us controls over amplitude and
other parameters of the synths so

24
00:01:54.873 --> 00:02:01.887
these parameters like brightness and
movement they define these parameters and

25
00:02:01.887 --> 00:02:07.147
then for example this movement
parameter might be affecting

26
00:02:07.147 --> 00:02:12.329
in tone it might be called
an LFO low frequency oscillator.

27
00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:17.310
And that's what creates
these kind of back and

28
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.293
forth sounding wobbly
sounds that you get from

29
00:02:22.293 --> 00:02:26.392
this movement parameter here [SOUND].

30
00:02:26.392 --> 00:02:30.807
And something like brightness,
it's hard to say what that is exactly.

31
00:02:30.807 --> 00:02:35.704
It could be chorus, it could be distortion
or something else that you could

32
00:02:35.704 --> 00:02:40.601
probably achieve something similar just
using some of the effects here and

33
00:02:40.601 --> 00:02:45.284
hooking up the wet parameter to a slider
like they have in Ableton here.

34
00:02:45.284 --> 00:02:50.977
[SOUND] So there's a specific

35
00:02:50.977 --> 00:02:56.433
few that I just wanna show,

36
00:02:56.433 --> 00:02:59.763
if I can find it.

37
00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:03.863
So yeah, there's a whole chapter on
envelopes, it's really fantastic.

38
00:03:03.863 --> 00:03:07.377
And LFO's how to oscillate the sound.

39
00:03:07.377 --> 00:03:09.704
But then they also have some recipes.

40
00:03:09.704 --> 00:03:15.116
And some examples of
different sort of sounds and

41
00:03:15.116 --> 00:03:18.818
how these sounds come together.

42
00:03:18.818 --> 00:03:20.354
So let's say,

43
00:03:20.354 --> 00:03:22.987
[MUSIC]

44
00:03:22.987 --> 00:03:24.904
Something like a pluck bass.

45
00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:32.138
[MUSIC]

46
00:03:32.138 --> 00:03:38.522
And you can hear now how
changing this envelope changes

47
00:03:38.522 --> 00:03:43.792
the synths, so
if we have a very long attack,

48
00:03:43.792 --> 00:03:50.037
it's not even hitting the peak
of that signal because

49
00:03:50.037 --> 00:03:56.179
the note is being turned off
before it hits the peak.

50
00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:58.586
So let's give it a short attack

51
00:03:58.586 --> 00:04:03.127
[MUSIC]

52
00:04:03.127 --> 00:04:08.549
And the decay is once it hits
the peak does it go down,

53
00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.397
or how fast does it go down?

54
00:04:11.397 --> 00:04:14.586
[MUSIC]

55
00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:17.843
Gives it a bit more of a plucky feeling.

56
00:04:17.843 --> 00:04:23.025
And the sustain is,
does it go down all the way to zero or

57
00:04:23.025 --> 00:04:26.417
does it does it stay at full volume?

58
00:04:26.417 --> 00:04:29.470
And just by changing this envelope,

59
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.885
you can really create some
drastically different sounds here and

60
00:04:34.885 --> 00:04:41.882
we haven't even really changed the synth
at all we're just changing the envelope.

61
00:04:41.882 --> 00:04:46.093
There's also effects we
can add like this low pass

62
00:04:46.093 --> 00:04:50.905
filter is actually a great
visualization of how a low pass

63
00:04:50.905 --> 00:04:55.834
filter looks if we were to graph
it in a spectrum analyzer.

64
00:04:55.834 --> 00:05:02.067
[MUSIC]

65
00:05:02.067 --> 00:05:06.427
The lower this value is,
the less that we're letting through.

66
00:05:06.427 --> 00:05:10.093
The less of the frequencies that
we're letting through in the higher,

67
00:05:10.093 --> 00:05:11.203
the more relatable.

68
00:05:11.203 --> 00:05:17.907
[MUSIC]

69
00:05:17.907 --> 00:05:22.929
And even those modulators, so
even these kind of allophones and

70
00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:28.518
these other things that are filtering,
they can also have envelopes.

71
00:05:28.518 --> 00:05:34.247
And you can start to see how layering
all these different features together.

72
00:05:34.247 --> 00:05:35.773
Start to create this.

73
00:05:35.773 --> 00:05:36.828
[MUSIC]

74
00:05:36.828 --> 00:05:40.508
Kind of playground where you begin
to tweak little variables and

75
00:05:40.508 --> 00:05:42.287
find something that's good.

76
00:05:42.287 --> 00:05:46.185
And it's really nice to be able to play
with something like this which is a system

77
00:05:46.185 --> 00:05:49.207
where you can change the envelope,
you can see the envelope,

78
00:05:49.207 --> 00:05:50.797
you have all the settings here.

79
00:05:50.797 --> 00:05:53.912
And then once you're happy with things,

80
00:05:53.912 --> 00:05:59.347
you could potentially bring these into
your code into your tone JS code.

81
00:05:59.347 --> 00:06:03.817
It might take a little bit of time to
figure out the exact way to try and

82
00:06:03.817 --> 00:06:06.027
reproduce some of these scents.

83
00:06:06.027 --> 00:06:11.432
But a lot of this Ableton learning
synths guide is just using

84
00:06:11.432 --> 00:06:17.717
the same types of Web Audio API's
that we've been exploring today.

85
00:06:17.717 --> 00:06:19.467
I'm not sure if they use tone JS.

86
00:06:19.467 --> 00:06:21.925
I think there's a chance they might, or

87
00:06:21.925 --> 00:06:25.332
they might just have their
own web audio API interface.

88
00:06:25.332 --> 00:06:30.023
But from what I've seen, all of this
should be very possible with something

89
00:06:30.023 --> 00:06:33.610
like tone JS if it just Take a bit
of time to figure out what it

90
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.084
is that they're they're doing to
create these types of oscillators and

91
00:06:38.084 --> 00:06:40.392
how they're layering them together

92
00:06:40.392 --> 00:06:44.794
[MUSIC]

93
00:06:44.794 --> 00:06:51.963
[SOUND] So just to find another one
that's a little different here let's see.

94
00:06:51.963 --> 00:06:56.830
These are using just
different envelopes again

95
00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:03.827
[MUSIC]

96
00:07:03.827 --> 00:07:08.656
And you might find a few leads or
a few sounds keys that are using multiple

97
00:07:08.656 --> 00:07:12.213
oscillators, or
different types of oscillators.

98
00:07:12.213 --> 00:07:17.297
[MUSIC]

99
00:07:17.297 --> 00:07:22.431
Anyways, this site is really fun to
just go through the site and just like,

100
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:27.087
see what you can do and see what you
can hear and how you can change it.

101
00:07:27.087 --> 00:07:33.002
And then even just go to this playground
and really just like, dive into doing your

102
00:07:33.002 --> 00:07:38.413
own synths and making them in different
ways and just playing around here.

103
00:07:38.413 --> 00:07:40.898
So I highly recommend checking this out.

104
00:07:40.898 --> 00:07:45.099
Just like going through the guide, and

105
00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:49.690
just having fun with this amazing resource
