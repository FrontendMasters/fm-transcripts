&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Now, that's our big kind
of high level overview of the ideas behind

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.640
programming, and I just wanna call you
back to this is all the kinda stuff that

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.890
we dig into in much more detail than just
now in chapter one of the Up &amp; Going book.

4
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.410
So I strongly encourage you to
kinda go through that chapter,

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.200
after you've watched through
this part of the course,

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.310
go through that part of the chapter and
just try out the different code.

7
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.520
Really, it's great for
you to actually program along with it,

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.500
instead of just reading, or
just listening to me talk.

9
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.800
You wanna actually go through and
try out each of these things and

10
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.520
get your brain really wrapped
around these ideas of values and

11
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.910
operations and things like arrays.

12
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.758
We need to figure out
how to work with those,

13
00:00:44.758 --> 00:00:47.566
cuz you're gonna see those a lot
in the rest of your program.

14
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:50.860
So you wanna then be able to do loops and
decisions and

15
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.760
even make your own functions.

16
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.900
So definitely check that stuff out,
and then you'll be ready to move on to

17
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.580
the next part of this course, where we're
gonna dive into the deep principles,

18
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.330
what I call the three deep pillars,
principles, of the JavaScript language.
