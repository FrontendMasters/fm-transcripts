00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.726
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I just want to review
what we've now been talking about

2
00:00:03.726 --> 00:00:05.561
over these three pillars.

3
00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:08.292
We started by talking
about the type system.

4
00:00:08.292 --> 00:00:10.899
And we talked about how
types exist in JavaScript,

5
00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:14.673
even though it's a dynamically typed
language it still have real types.

6
00:00:14.673 --> 00:00:17.501
And we have a set of
different mechanisms for

7
00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:22.249
how we can convert from one type to
another type that's called coercion.

8
00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:26.300
We have a specific kind of coercion
that's available to us with our equality

9
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.943
checking.

10
00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:31.792
And we can find different use cases for
different times when we wanna use what

11
00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:36.134
coercive equality checking versus
a more strict type of checking.

12
00:00:36.134 --> 00:00:40.101
Both of those are entirely valid things
that we wanna do in our programs.

13
00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:43.882
The second pillar that we looked at
was the scope and the closer system.

14
00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:48.333
The scope and closures are really one of
the most important and powerful patterns.

15
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:51.697
It underlines things like the module
pattern which is much more

16
00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:55.187
a complex topic than we have time
to get into in this workshop, but

17
00:00:55.187 --> 00:00:59.374
it's covered in these books and I strongly
recommend once you go from here that

18
00:00:59.374 --> 00:01:03.771
you go dive in, understand closure more
and then learn about the module pattern.

19
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:07.647
And finally the third unit that we've just
talked about, as the this keyword and

20
00:01:07.647 --> 00:01:08.793
the prototype system.

21
00:01:08.793 --> 00:01:10.949
And together the this keyword and

22
00:01:10.949 --> 00:01:15.806
the prototype system enable us to do
classes using that new class keyword.

23
00:01:15.806 --> 00:01:20.127
Those really, that's the map,
that really is the like landscape of

24
00:01:20.127 --> 00:01:24.164
the fundamental core principles
that you need for JavaScript.

25
00:01:24.164 --> 00:01:27.892
And though we've gone through them in
just a brief period of time here in this

26
00:01:27.892 --> 00:01:31.809
course, I don't want you to take away
is well, I'm done and I can move on.

27
00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:36.220
No, these are so much more rich of
a topic that you need to spend so

28
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.076
many more hours and weeks and
months even digging into.

29
00:01:40.076 --> 00:01:44.171
And there is no substitute for
you actually practicing this stuff.

30
00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:46.441
You can't just listen
to me talking about it.

31
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:50.958
You've got to do it like in the exercises
and retry these exercises, and

32
00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:54.523
you've gotta also go and
try them on your own code bases.

33
00:01:54.523 --> 00:01:56.108
If you don't have a code base yet

34
00:01:56.108 --> 00:01:59.350
try to find an open source project
that's out there to look at it.

35
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.362
But as you go along that journey as you're
trying to learn more about that stuff,

36
00:02:03.362 --> 00:02:06.784
I just wanna remind you that all
the topics that we talked about in this

37
00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:09.085
section of the course,
all of these pillars,

38
00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:12.522
those are laid out in more detail in
Chapter 2 of the Up &amp; Going book.

39
00:02:12.522 --> 00:02:16.750
And then Chapter 3, shows you where to
get more information about each of those

40
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.540
topics throughout the rest
of the unit on JS series.
