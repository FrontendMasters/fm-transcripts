00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.840
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay, well, that's
a whole slew of different programming

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.780
principles.

3
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.820
And it might have just
flown right over your head,

4
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.110
but that's okay cuz we're gonna
take some time to practice it.

5
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.865
In this exercise,

6
00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:13.708
you're gonna get a chance to practice
each of these different things.

7
00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:18.631
The values, the types, the loops,
conditionals, the variables,

8
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:20.140
all of those things.

9
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.370
We're gonna put it all together
in one working piece of code.

10
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.290
It's really important that you
check out this README file and

11
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.670
read through these
instructions very carefully.

12
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.180
I've tried to lay out exactly which steps
you need to take to work through it,

13
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.235
but I want to orient you to this
exercise file so you understand.

14
00:00:38.275 --> 00:00:42.355
We have a variable here
holding an empty array,

15
00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:44.015
favoriteBooks is holding an empty array.

16
00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:45.780
And what you're gonna be doing,

17
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.258
is you're gonna be finding first
an addFavoriteBook function.

18
00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:51.393
You notice I'm already calling it here,
and

19
00:00:51.393 --> 00:00:54.660
I've got listed several books
that are gonna be passed in.

20
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.480
You're gonna be defining that function
such that each time it's called,

21
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.310
it's gonna add what you've
passed in into this array.

22
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.050
However, there's a little twist, which is
that it's only gonna add it into the array

23
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.800
if the book title that's passed in
doesn't have the word great in it.

24
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.440
And you'll notice,

25
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.690
there are two of these book titles
that have the word great in them.

26
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.350
So those won't end up getting added, but
the others will, the other three will.

27
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.450
That's what addFavoriteBook is gonna do.

28
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.590
And then,
printFavoriteBooks is gonna do a loop.

29
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.710
Remember we talked about loops.

30
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.070
You're gonna do a loop.

31
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.380
And you're gonna print out all of
the books that are in this array.

32
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.941
You're gonna loop over all the values
in this array and print those out.

33
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:40.028
And you're also gonna print out a message
that says how many books are in there,

34
00:01:40.028 --> 00:01:42.542
which as we just said is
going to be three, okay?

35
00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:46.032
So just make sure you follow along
in these instructions, go in order,

36
00:01:46.032 --> 00:01:49.638
and make sure you check out the hints
that I've labeled in each one of these

37
00:01:49.638 --> 00:01:53.480
items because they will give you
critical information that you need.

38
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.700
Refer back to the slides, all that
information should be either in here or

39
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.060
in those slides.

40
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.180
And if you do get stuck, it's entirely
okay, cuz I know for some of you,

41
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.500
this may be some very early
experience with programming.

42
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.498
If you do get stuck, and you need to kind
of orient yourself a little bit, I have

43
00:02:09.498 --> 00:02:13.513
provided a solution file that you can take
a look at and try to get back on track.

44
00:02:13.513 --> 00:02:15.511
So we'll take plenty of time on this.

45
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:17.679
Take as much time as you need.

46
00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.940
Work through these types of things,
and try to run the code.

47
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.840
And by the way, use an environment that
allows you to run code like, for example,

48
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.900
the developer tools
console in your browser.

49
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.130
One tool that I really like to
run my code is called RunJS, and

50
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.570
this is what it looks like.

51
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.963
It allows you to type in some
code like var x equals 42,

52
00:02:37.963 --> 00:02:40.120
and then console dot log x.

53
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.480
And then,
it allows you to click the Run button, and

54
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.360
then you see the output right there.

55
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.750
So I really like this tool for running
code, and that might be useful to you.

56
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.870
But definitely,
do run the code as you're writing it so

57
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.800
that you really get that hands-on
experience with your code.

58
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.790
Before you jump into this exercise and
try to work on the code,

59
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.430
I just wanna make sure I re-emphasize
that there really is no substitute for

60
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.260
actually running your code and
seeing the results.

61
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.730
So as you're typing these things out,

62
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.130
it's really important that you are also
running them to try to see what results

63
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.460
you're getting, what errors you might
be getting to kind of correct things.

64
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.770
That's how all JavaScript
developers do it.

65
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.362
So I wanna show you real quickly a couple
of different ways that you might do that.

66
00:03:19.362 --> 00:03:23.528
You could take some code and
put it into the developer console of, say,

67
00:03:23.528 --> 00:03:24.784
the Chrome browser.

68
00:03:24.784 --> 00:03:28.182
So if you don't already have the Chrome
browser downloaded, you can get that.

69
00:03:28.182 --> 00:03:31.392
If you got something like Firefox,
it's gonna work very similar.

70
00:03:31.392 --> 00:03:37.426
I'm gonna go up here, and open up
the developer tools for my Chrome browser.

71
00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:39.085
And I've got it on the console tag.

72
00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:41.709
If it's on the elements tag,
just click over to console.

73
00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.410
But this is an environment now
that you can actually write code.

74
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:51.284
So I can say teacherName equals Kyle.

75
00:03:51.284 --> 00:03:54.145
And I can see the results
of what I'm typing.

76
00:03:54.145 --> 00:03:58.430
And then, I could say,
console dot log teacher name.

77
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.581
And I can actually run that code and
see the results of what I'm typing.

78
00:04:01.581 --> 00:04:03.726
So try your code in
an environment like that.

79
00:04:03.726 --> 00:04:07.641
And if you don't wanna use Chrome console,
or it's not working for you in developer

80
00:04:07.641 --> 00:04:11.360
tools, there's another tool that I really
like to use and it's called RunJS.

81
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.370
And it looks like this.

82
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.800
It's an environment where you can type in,
and

83
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.320
then there's a button where
you can click to run.

84
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.090
So again, I could type in var
teacher name equals Kyle.

85
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.320
And then, if I don't make typos, and
then, say console dot log teacher name.

86
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.290
And then, when I click the Run button,
we see the results right there.

87
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.460
So either one of those two environments,
or if you have a different one,

88
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.310
maybe you like to run your
NodeJS on a command line.

89
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.330
But make sure you're running this
code as you're trying the exercise.

90
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.560
It's not good enough to
just talk about code, or

91
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.490
write some code in theory in your head.

92
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.610
What you really wanna do is make sure
that you're running that code and

93
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.600
checking yourself, and
then correcting, and moving forward.

94
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.050
So try that on this exercise.

95
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.330
We'll be back in a little bit to
talk you through, line by line,

96
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.520
through the solution.

97
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.567
And remember, if you get stuck and
you need a little bit of help,

98
00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:04.458
you can always take a look,
take a peek at the solution file.
