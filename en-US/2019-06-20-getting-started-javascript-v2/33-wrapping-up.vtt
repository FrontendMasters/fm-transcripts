&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Well, it's been kind
of a whirlwind of a course, I'm sure.

2
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:09.251
And especially if you're kind of new to
this JavaScript programming language, or

3
00:00:09.251 --> 00:00:10.419
even new to programming,

4
00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.800
your brain is probably awash
with a lot of different details.

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.280
I just wanna remind you that you
don't have to have all this stuff

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.130
perfect right now.

7
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.350
That's completely,
completely unreasonable for

8
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.630
anybody to have picked up all that stuff
in just a few couple of hours together.

9
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.080
So I just wanna encourage you that this
is a long journey that you're beginning.

10
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.580
These are some of the first steps in
a journey to really get your brain wrapped

11
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.070
around a much more sophisticated and
complex ecosystem which is JavaScript.

12
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.098
And there are lots of materials, there are
many, many videos that can help you along

13
00:00:44.098 --> 00:00:46.437
that way here on
the Front End Masters platform.

14
00:00:46.437 --> 00:00:49.613
There are books like the ones that
I've referenced here in this course.

15
00:00:49.613 --> 00:00:53.643
And the exercises, make sure you go back
and practice those several times and

16
00:00:53.643 --> 00:00:57.440
try to extend them and add to them and
do more things with them.

17
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.390
But really, the biggest take away
that I can leave you with is

18
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.790
there is no substitute for just getting
in and writing the Java Script.

19
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.380
That's all of us of have learned it.

20
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.660
If you're wondering how did I figured
out all these stuffs of our Java Script,

21
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.290
the only answer is that I just
wrote a lot of JavaScript.

22
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.150
So I hope we've armed you with
the tools to do that, and

23
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.910
I'm excited to see what you're gonna
do in your journey learning JavaScript.

24
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.450
Thanks very much for being with us.
