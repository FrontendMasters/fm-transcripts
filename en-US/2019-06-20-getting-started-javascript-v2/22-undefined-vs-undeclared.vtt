&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Let's talk about two
very special concepts around emptiness

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.770
that come into play heavily
when we're talking about scope.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.780
I just mentioned the idea of
a variable never having been declared,

4
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.100
the topic variable in that previous slide.

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.910
It's never been declared.

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.790
That is the state of undeclared, and

7
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.340
a lot of people think the word
undefined is the same concept.

8
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.500
That being undefined or being undeclared
are basically the same thing.

9
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.680
They're very distinctly different.

10
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.730
Specifically in a program
something that is

11
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.950
undefined is a variable that has been
declared, but it doesn't have a value.

12
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.050
And then a variable that is undeclared
is one that was never declared anywhere.

13
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.490
We just start trying to reference it.

14
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.242
And the JavaScript engine
has no idea where that is.
