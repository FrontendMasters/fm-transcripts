00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.002
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: All right.
So, we wanna do

2
00:00:01.002 --> 00:00:02.785
something useful with our programs.

3
00:00:02.785 --> 00:00:06.596
We don't just wanna save the number 42,
and then add something to it.

4
00:00:06.596 --> 00:00:08.431
We wanna actually do things.

5
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:11.102
And the way we're gonna figure
out how to do things is,

6
00:00:11.102 --> 00:00:12.969
we're gonna have to make decisions.

7
00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.499
We're gonna have to decide If the user has
added some item to their shopping cart and

8
00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:21.828
they wanna check on the Amazon.com or
whatever.

9
00:00:21.828 --> 00:00:24.728
We're gonna have to decide
if that item is in memory.

10
00:00:24.728 --> 00:00:28.329
I mean if that item is in inventory so
that we can sell it to them.

11
00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.752
We're gonna have to make decisions.

12
00:00:30.752 --> 00:00:34.815
And the primary that we're gonna make
a decision, there are other ways to do so.

13
00:00:34.815 --> 00:00:39.223
But one of the primary way to make
a decision is called the if statement.

14
00:00:39.223 --> 00:00:40.500
So here we see line 1.

15
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.405
That should look familiar.

16
00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:44.416
We're making a var age = 39.

17
00:00:44.416 --> 00:00:47.065
That's an assignment statement,
if you remember.

18
00:00:47.065 --> 00:00:51.209
But line 3 is slightly different
because we have the if keyword, and

19
00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:53.647
then we have a set of parentheses there.

20
00:00:53.647 --> 00:00:58.389
That's what we call the if clause or
the test clause.

21
00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:02.714
And then we have some stuff that we're
gonna do inside of those curly braces.

22
00:01:02.714 --> 00:01:05.970
You see there's a curly brace
at the end of line 3 and

23
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.342
then another one at the end of line 5.

24
00:01:08.342 --> 00:01:12.590
They kinda group together a set of
statements that would be kinda like

25
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.388
a paragraph In a novel
that you were reading.

26
00:01:15.388 --> 00:01:18.559
We would group a set of sentences
together into a paragraph.

27
00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:21.725
We group a set of statements
together with curly braces.

28
00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:25.554
So we're saying if age is greater than or
equal to 18,

29
00:01:25.554 --> 00:01:30.203
then we want to do everything that's
inside of these curly braces.

30
00:01:30.203 --> 00:01:35.116
So we need to figure out what
the results of the operation age

31
00:01:35.116 --> 00:01:37.880
greater than or equal to 18 is.

32
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.143
And remember, greater than or equal,
that's one of our comparison operators so

33
00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:43.828
it's gonna go make a decision.

34
00:01:43.828 --> 00:01:47.325
It's gonna go say, yes,
it is greater than or equal to 18,

35
00:01:47.325 --> 00:01:51.723
in which case it gives us true or no it
isn't, in which case it gives us false.

36
00:01:51.723 --> 00:01:53.992
And the if statement then says,

37
00:01:53.992 --> 00:01:59.298
I'm only gonna do the work inside of
the curly braces, If I got a true back.

38
00:01:59.298 --> 00:02:01.524
That’s how we make a decision.

39
00:02:01.524 --> 00:02:06.117
Now it’s sometimes the case that we only
want to do one thing if some condition

40
00:02:06.117 --> 00:02:07.255
like this is true.

41
00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:09.859
We want to make a decision and
then do something.

42
00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.679
But a lot of times, it’s like we’ve got
to choose between two different things.

43
00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:17.497
We either need to do this or
we need to do that.

44
00:02:17.497 --> 00:02:21.883
And that's a slightly different variation
on the if statement form called

45
00:02:21.883 --> 00:02:22.654
the if else.

46
00:02:22.654 --> 00:02:27.632
So if, looks exactly the same,
lines one through three, you see the if.

47
00:02:27.632 --> 00:02:31.506
You see an expression there,
which in this case is a function call.

48
00:02:31.506 --> 00:02:34.778
That's gonna either return
something that looks like true, or

49
00:02:34.778 --> 00:02:36.543
something that looks like false.

50
00:02:36.543 --> 00:02:41.766
If it returns as true,
then we're gonna do the stuff on line two.

51
00:02:41.766 --> 00:02:46.254
But if it returned as false, immediately
we're gonna skip over that stuff and

52
00:02:46.254 --> 00:02:47.893
go right to the else clause.

53
00:02:47.893 --> 00:02:52.791
And the else clause then executes only if

54
00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:56.835
the test clause returned false.

55
00:02:56.835 --> 00:03:00.041
So now you see the basic building
blocks for making decisions.

56
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:02.946
We can either do something or
not do anything at all.

57
00:03:02.946 --> 00:03:06.425
Or in this case, as we see in
this slide we can do one thing or

58
00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:09.423
do another thing depending
upon some condition.

59
00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:10.814
And you can chain these things.

60
00:03:10.814 --> 00:03:13.493
You can nest these and
put these things together.

61
00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.705
Kind of like when you build with legos.

62
00:03:15.705 --> 00:03:19.785
You can put all of these pieces together
and you start to build up more and

63
00:03:19.785 --> 00:03:22.239
more complex things in your application.

64
00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.092
Okay, let's test out how
that if L stuff works.

65
00:03:26.092 --> 00:03:28.720
Here, I've changed the code
just a little bit.

66
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.499
Instead of calling functions,
I'm using a Boolean variable here.

67
00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:32.715
But if I run this code,

68
00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:36.058
you're going to see because
enrolled as is enrolled is true.

69
00:03:36.058 --> 00:03:37.952
It's going to take the class.

70
00:03:37.952 --> 00:03:39.629
But if we change that to false,

71
00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.960
now all of a sudden it's gonna print
a different message which is enroll first.
