00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.126
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: As a quick
overview of what to expect,

2
00:00:02.126 --> 00:00:06.028
we're gonna start as I said with
a quick primer on programming concepts.

3
00:00:06.028 --> 00:00:09.233
And we'll look at things like statements
and expressions and variables.

4
00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:12.924
So, we'll fill in any gaps
that may exist for you there.

5
00:00:12.924 --> 00:00:18.194
And then we're going to dive into the
three pillars of the JavaScript language.

6
00:00:18.194 --> 00:00:21.991
This is only my opinion on how to
divide up the various features, but

7
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:25.802
I think these are the three main
areas that you'll spend focusing.

8
00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:29.914
And just to set some expectation, these
are not things that you learn in one day.

9
00:00:29.914 --> 00:00:32.868
You could take one of these units and
spend weeks or

10
00:00:32.868 --> 00:00:35.833
even months,
potentially even years learning.

11
00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:39.460
I'm 20 plus years at this,
I'm still learning bits and

12
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.065
pieces, and figuring these things out.

13
00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:45.236
So really the best way to approach
this is not like I wanna,

14
00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:48.279
get I wanna check something off in my and
spread sheet but

15
00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:52.324
really I want to approach this is
a continual ever sort of learning thing.

16
00:00:52.324 --> 00:00:55.750
You're starting out in the journey
to learn how to do programming,

17
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.295
learn how to do Java script ,and I
want you to embrace that as a constant

18
00:00:59.295 --> 00:01:02.382
thing that you will journey
throughout your entire career.

19
00:01:02.382 --> 00:01:04.845
So the three pillars
that we want to look at.

20
00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:07.432
Number one,
we're gonna look at types and coercion.

21
00:01:07.432 --> 00:01:09.752
And again, if those words
don't make sense, don't worry,

22
00:01:09.752 --> 00:01:11.596
we'll talk exactly what
all those things mean.

23
00:01:11.596 --> 00:01:13.325
But we're gonna look at scope and

24
00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:17.166
scope enables us to talk about closures
which is a very critical feature.

25
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:21.083
And finally we're gonna look at
the this keyword and the prototypes.

26
00:01:21.083 --> 00:01:24.449
And so if you've never heard of any of
those things that's great you're in

27
00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:27.281
the right spot, maybe you have
heard of some of those things but

28
00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:30.811
they're confusing or you've just seen
them used in a library or a framework or

29
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:32.010
on a stack overflow post.

30
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.748
You weren't really quite
sure what they meant.

31
00:01:34.748 --> 00:01:37.655
We want to take a little bit
of a deeper dive into it.

32
00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:40.964
And again, just as a reminder,
the book is where you go next,

33
00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:45.052
after anything that you've learned
here in this course, go into the book.

34
00:01:45.052 --> 00:01:48.807
It'll start to give you more of that
information and then it'll push you into

35
00:01:48.807 --> 00:01:52.701
the rest of the book series, which dives
really deep into each of these topics.

36
00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:56.969
Before we go on, though,
I want you to hear a little bit about

37
00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.484
my thoughts on why we code,
which is that we code so

38
00:02:00.484 --> 00:02:04.705
that the things that we write
are readable to human beings.

39
00:02:04.705 --> 00:02:09.047
So let's dive into a primer on
basic programming concepts.

40
00:02:09.047 --> 00:02:12.294
And here's a quick list of
the concepts that we wanna look at.

41
00:02:12.294 --> 00:02:16.359
We'll look at one or two code examples for
each one of these to sort of illustrate

42
00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:20.076
what does that mean and where does it
fit in the overall scheme of things?

43
00:02:20.076 --> 00:02:21.979
Just like if you were an English major,

44
00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:24.237
you need to learn about
the English language.

45
00:02:24.237 --> 00:02:27.726
Well, we need to learn about
the process of speaking a language, and

46
00:02:27.726 --> 00:02:30.792
we are gonna do so
in the context of JavaScript, obviously,

47
00:02:30.792 --> 00:02:32.613
that's what this course is about.

48
00:02:32.613 --> 00:02:33.956
But these are the basic things,

49
00:02:33.956 --> 00:02:36.402
that you'll actually find in
any programming language.

50
00:02:36.402 --> 00:02:39.404
So, if you have done a programming
language before, in your mind,

51
00:02:39.404 --> 00:02:42.931
you'll think, I know, I used to do
a function this way in that language and

52
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:44.844
now, that's how I do that in JavaScript.

53
00:02:44.844 --> 00:02:46.780
So look for those sorts of connections.

54
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.341
And if this is your first
programming language,

55
00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:52.027
you'll be able to take these
as your foundation and

56
00:02:52.027 --> 00:02:55.409
use those to learn another
programming language at some point.

57
00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.479
So we'll look at values,
those are things like the number 42 or

58
00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.042
the string hello world.

59
00:03:01.042 --> 00:03:04.363
We'll look at operations,
things that we do like 42 + 1.

60
00:03:04.363 --> 00:03:07.495
We'll look at variables which is
where we store those values and

61
00:03:07.495 --> 00:03:09.119
then where we access them later.

62
00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:10.854
Expressions and statements.

63
00:03:10.854 --> 00:03:13.900
That's really again back to
the sort of English grammar.

64
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.880
An expression is kind of like
a phrase in a sentence and

65
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.005
a statement is a whole sentence
with a period at the end.

66
00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:21.472
We'll look at decisions.

67
00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:24.965
Deciding whether or not to do something or
to do something else.

68
00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:28.497
We look at loops repeating things over and
over again.

69
00:03:28.497 --> 00:03:30.840
And finally we look at functions.

70
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.498
These are the building blocks that
make up a program, make up the logic

71
00:03:34.498 --> 00:03:38.290
the instructions that we give to
the computer through our programming.
