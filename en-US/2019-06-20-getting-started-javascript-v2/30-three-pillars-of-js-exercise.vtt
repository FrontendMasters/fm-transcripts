00:00:01.496 --> 00:00:04.236
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Wow, that was
an awful lot of JavaScript that I just

2
00:00:04.236 --> 00:00:07.186
threw at you over those
last few lecture videos?

3
00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:09.873
Well, it's good that we practice
what we've been looking at so

4
00:00:09.873 --> 00:00:12.081
that it doesn't just go in one ear and
out the other.

5
00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:14.921
So that's why we got this
exercise to practice all

6
00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:17.771
those three pillars of
the JavaScript language.

7
00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:21.247
We're gonna be practicing a little
bit about types and coercion,

8
00:00:21.247 --> 00:00:25.466
a bit about scope and closures, and a bit
about the this keyword and prototypes,

9
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:29.153
specifically using that class syntax
that we talked about at the end.

10
00:00:29.153 --> 00:00:31.520
So let me orient you to this exercise and

11
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.623
then we'll give you plenty
of time to work on that.

12
00:00:34.623 --> 00:00:38.330
What we're gonna be doing is revisiting
the exercise from previous, but

13
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.379
we're gonna be adding some more
functionality to this now,

14
00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.555
or a little bit more sophistication to it.

15
00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:46.395
Now that we understand a little
bit more about JavaScript.

16
00:00:46.395 --> 00:00:50.313
So we're gonna be defining
a Bookshelf class.

17
00:00:50.313 --> 00:00:52.868
And you can see that there's
going to be a constructor.

18
00:00:52.868 --> 00:00:56.327
We're going to have the addFavoriteBook
and printFavoriteBooks,

19
00:00:56.327 --> 00:00:59.079
you might remember those
from the previous exercise.

20
00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.458
Well, now we're gonna move them to be
methods inside of our bookshelf class.

21
00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:09.558
And then we're gonna be calling a function
that pretends to make an ajax call.

22
00:01:09.558 --> 00:01:13.115
That's a way of making a request from
the webpage back to the server, and

23
00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:14.525
getting some information.

24
00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:16.457
We're not going to really
make an ajax call.

25
00:01:16.457 --> 00:01:20.393
I've provided you a fake function
that pretends to do ajax.

26
00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:23.907
But it's going to give you a chance to
practice remembering something over time

27
00:01:23.907 --> 00:01:25.961
which is what we're going
to do with closure.

28
00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:29.310
So you're going to get a chance to
practice with all of three pillars.

29
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.474
I've laid out very specific instructions.

30
00:01:31.474 --> 00:01:33.874
I want to make sure you go
through them in order and

31
00:01:33.874 --> 00:01:35.640
make sure you read very carefully.

32
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.628
You gonna try out this exercise, and

33
00:01:37.628 --> 00:01:40.332
bit by bit make sure you're
executing this code.

34
00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:41.832
Don't just write a bunch of code,

35
00:01:41.832 --> 00:01:44.427
and then try to run it, and
you have a whole bunch of errors.

36
00:01:44.427 --> 00:01:47.282
Every time you make a little change or
a little edition,

37
00:01:47.282 --> 00:01:50.744
move it over to one of those
JavaScript environments like runJS, or

38
00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:53.072
the Chrome dev tools or
something like that.

39
00:01:53.072 --> 00:01:55.995
Make sure you run the code,
and check yourself often.

40
00:01:55.995 --> 00:02:00.184
Make sure you save your files often so
that you're not losing information.

41
00:02:00.184 --> 00:02:03.369
But we'll give you some time to
run through this exercise and

42
00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.434
try your hand at it.

43
00:02:04.434 --> 00:02:08.243
And don't feel bad if there's some
challenge here because this is an awful

44
00:02:08.243 --> 00:02:10.550
lot of JavaScript to
throw at you all at once.

45
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.799
I just want you to get a little bit of
a feel, little bit less intimidation,

46
00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.318
hopefully around each of those
core pillars of the language.

47
00:02:18.318 --> 00:02:21.651
Again, feeling okay about how
we deal with types and coercion,

48
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:24.491
feeling okay about the scope and
the closure system and

49
00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:27.471
feeling okay with the this keyword and
the class system.
