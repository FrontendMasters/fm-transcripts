1
00:00:00.298 --> 00:00:05.105
So one of the questions that
we got earlier was before and

2
00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:07.360
after pseudoselectors.

3
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.625
And I was like, we will get there,
and guess what?

4
00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:12.799
We are now here, we've arrived.

5
00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.777
And I have another terrible live coding
idea that I'm gonna try to resist the urge

6
00:00:16.777 --> 00:00:18.369
for, but it's not gonna work.

7
00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.835
And so, in this case,
the kind of main one, first and foremost,

8
00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:25.204
is either this, before content.

9
00:00:25.204 --> 00:00:29.186
And, like we saw before, pun unintended,

10
00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:34.145
that in brackets you can
have arbitrary data, right?

11
00:00:34.145 --> 00:00:38.239
And so, in this case, we're putting
a string in there, all right,

12
00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.229
I have a different one for after.

13
00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:45.967
And then I can continue to stack
up these variant classes for all.

14
00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:51.470
I can style them any way that I want,
independent of the element itself.

15
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:58.452
And also, [COUGH] we saw earlier
that we can stack these as well.

16
00:00:58.452 --> 00:01:02.804
So any of the group and
peer stuff, you could have,

17
00:01:02.804 --> 00:01:08.080
if the group is open,
then do an after, or whatever, right?

18
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.807
If it's required,
then put a little notification

19
00:01:11.807 --> 00:01:16.672
that says required afterwards,
or something along those lines.

20
00:01:16.672 --> 00:01:21.601
You can stack these as much as you want,
and kinda combine them,

21
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:26.178
and get a lot of interactivity
just with Tailwind, right?

22
00:01:26.178 --> 00:01:28.980
For freebies as well.

23
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.736
And so,
I think that's pretty cool there as well.

24
00:01:31.736 --> 00:01:34.718
And again, all the styles
work just as they did before,

25
00:01:34.718 --> 00:01:36.374
you can take them as elements.

26
00:01:36.374 --> 00:01:40.794
And as you know,
they're not really kind of there,

27
00:01:40.794 --> 00:01:46.360
you can't select them, but
they exist on the page, cool.

28
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.660
And so, what we could do with this one is,
we looked at before when we wanted to say,

29
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.881
hey, wouldn't it be great if I could
style a label based on whether or

30
00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:03.031
not it's required, or
something along those lines, or invalid?

31
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:05.145
And we could,
we had to use the has operator,

32
00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:07.268
which doesn't have great browser support.

33
00:02:07.268 --> 00:02:10.930
But there is a dark hack that we could do.

34
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.325
And if you don't feel good about it,

35
00:02:12.325 --> 00:02:15.260
just wait for the has operator, and
then you don't have to feel bad about it.

36
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.975
But we could do something similar as well.

37
00:02:18.975 --> 00:02:23.510
And we could use, effectively,
a flexbox, and then reverse the order.

38
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.710
So in the DOM, it's afterwards,
but it shows up before.

39
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.526
And you could do something
like that as well.

40
00:02:29.526 --> 00:02:31.100
And it does combine and stack them.

41
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.001
I think the more important part is I
can't come up with a more egregious

42
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:37.560
reason to do this.

43
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.276
So just to kind of demonstrate how
you can stack these, let's go for it.

44
00:02:42.276 --> 00:02:47.090
All right, so we'll give ourselves a div,
it's gonna be great.

45
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.629
And this time, we'll say the input, and
we're gonna say that it is required.

46
00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.464
And I'm just gonna do some light styling
to it, cuz I can't live with that.

47
00:02:58.464 --> 00:03:01.343
If you want me to focus,
I need it to look good, sorry.

48
00:03:01.343 --> 00:03:07.258
So, let's say border,
That seems like a fine border.

49
00:03:11.267 --> 00:03:19.273
Great, and we'll say, placeholder,

50
00:03:25.047 --> 00:03:28.673
I am required, cool.

51
00:03:32.521 --> 00:03:34.927
Fine, that's good enough for our purposes.

52
00:03:34.927 --> 00:03:38.776
And we'll close that tag as well.

53
00:03:38.776 --> 00:03:41.536
And so you could theoretically
put the label here.

54
00:03:41.536 --> 00:03:45.730
And if you don't feel good about this,
I don't blame you.

55
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.635
But it's mostly so I can show you
how you can stack these things,

56
00:03:49.635 --> 00:03:52.140
more than I endorse this as a plan.

57
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.036
So we'll say, Required Field,

58
00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:07.496
Let's make that, Great.

59
00:04:07.496 --> 00:04:13.475
And we'll go into the depths of flex and
grid in a little bit.

60
00:04:13.475 --> 00:04:16.543
But mostly to show that we can stack
these in interesting ways to create

61
00:04:16.543 --> 00:04:17.532
interactive pieces.

62
00:04:17.532 --> 00:04:20.800
There are more practical ways, absolutely.

63
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.003
But since we were talking about it
during a break, now we're gonna do it.

64
00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:26.205
So, we'll say,

65
00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.131
I think I'm gonna make these both blocks,
too.

66
00:04:39.976 --> 00:04:41.330
There we go.

67
00:04:50.278 --> 00:04:51.764
Why is that no worky?

68
00:04:55.036 --> 00:04:57.395
&gt;&gt; Flex added before
the flex column reverse?

69
00:04:57.395 --> 00:04:58.177
&gt;&gt; What's that?

70
00:04:58.177 --> 00:05:00.743
&gt;&gt; Do you have to add flex
before flex column reverse?

71
00:05:00.743 --> 00:05:06.743
&gt;&gt; I do, this is why you pair program with
ten of your friends at the same time.

72
00:05:06.743 --> 00:05:11.376
All right, there we go, there it is.

73
00:05:11.376 --> 00:05:14.742
So now, theoretically,
with that peer selector,

74
00:05:14.742 --> 00:05:19.265
we know that only does future siblings,
which it technically is now.

75
00:05:19.265 --> 00:05:24.735
So you could do something like peer,

76
00:05:24.735 --> 00:05:30.029
and then we'll say peer required,

77
00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:34.091
and then we'll say after.

78
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:39.066
And then we'll just say like, And

79
00:05:39.066 --> 00:05:43.886
so now I can theoretically,
no, I could add something to

80
00:05:43.886 --> 00:05:49.460
a label if it is required,
cuz we're using the peer selector.

81
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.692
We know about isRequired,
we can stack peerRequired, and then after.

82
00:05:54.692 --> 00:05:58.876
And you can probably find other
clever ways to set this up as well.

83
00:05:58.876 --> 00:06:03.025
But there are ways around it if it is
something that you really want to do.

84
00:06:03.025 --> 00:06:07.293
And it's not the worst thing in the world,
it's not the best, either.

85
00:06:07.293 --> 00:06:11.465
Then we can do after, and we'll just say

86
00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:16.695
like, text-red or something like that.

87
00:06:21.717 --> 00:06:24.263
Text-red, not 300.

88
00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:34.867
And yeah, you can do all sorts of stuff,
you can say like, after, and

89
00:06:34.867 --> 00:06:40.003
it will say, margin-left,
get a little bit of space.

90
00:06:40.003 --> 00:06:43.740
You can do whatever you need to do in
this case, you can make it all work.

91
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.629
And now you will get,
if this is no longer a required

92
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:52.287
input field, where did I write that?

93
00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:53.654
Cuz now everything's
upside down backwards.

94
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:58.800
We will lose the pseudoselector there,
right?

95
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.100
So you can stack these up, you can
kinda compile them into different ways.

96
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.133
You've got open, like I said before, you
can do some interesting stuff with checked

97
00:07:06.133 --> 00:07:08.160
as well, kind of even with a hidden thing.

98
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.868
Cuz if you have a label associated with
it, you can sell it however you want.

99
00:07:11.868 --> 00:07:14.149
You can have the label hidden and
stuff along those lines.

100
00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:18.678
There's a bunch of really interesting
things that you can do with zero

101
00:07:18.678 --> 00:07:21.760
JavaScript whatsoever,
which is kind of fun.

102
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.896
Look at me,
I'm enjoying CSS all of a sudden.
