1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.648
Cool, so
we have this grid challenge though, right,

2
00:00:04.648 --> 00:00:08.780
where I wanna build something like this,
right?

3
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.068
Which I can do, and I'll kind of
show you some of the code, but

4
00:00:13.068 --> 00:00:17.275
this is kind of the point of we
can use this arbitrary value and

5
00:00:17.275 --> 00:00:21.320
it'll show you how powerful
some of these pieces are.

6
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.289
But then that trade off of, I'm not always
sure that I want to do all these things

7
00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.457
in Tailwind and that's okay, because you
know what talent is at the end of the day?

8
00:00:29.457 --> 00:00:32.680
It's just a bunch of utility classes and
all your CSS still works.

9
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.443
It's not like you've opted into some
framework where you can only use Tailwind.

10
00:00:36.443 --> 00:00:39.797
You can opt out and like we saw at
the very beginning, you can get

11
00:00:39.797 --> 00:00:43.988
that theme function and grab any part of
the theme you want in your regular CSS.

12
00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:47.564
You still get all the purging,
if you used layers and

13
00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:51.149
stuff along those lines,
you get all of the pieces.

14
00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.274
And you can both, I think, Yehuda Katz
said it about Ember at one point,

15
00:00:56.274 --> 00:01:01.486
a good framework should always push and
guide you in the right direction,

16
00:01:01.486 --> 00:01:06.160
and then give you an escape hatch
that is easy when you need it.

17
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.190
I think Tailwind does
a very good job with that.

18
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.358
So what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna look at a little piece of how

19
00:01:13.358 --> 00:01:18.528
to put something like this together,
and then we are going to look at

20
00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:23.540
just a few other kind of useful
tricks that I think are kinda nice.

21
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.181
We actually accidentally looked at
aspect ratio already as a fun thing, but

22
00:01:28.181 --> 00:01:31.160
we'll look at a few more
of these little ones.

23
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.240
We can talk about animations if you want
or any questions that come after that.

24
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.642
But I kinda wanna just look at how to
put together a layout like this so

25
00:01:37.642 --> 00:01:41.620
you can kind of see where
the advantages and disadvantages are.

26
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.225
And then a bunch of other kind of
potpourri of tricks, and then we'll kind

27
00:01:46.225 --> 00:01:50.979
of pull the train into the station and
answer any kind of questions or any kind

28
00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.909
of thoughts or ideas that we might pull
out and kind of see in this place as well.

29
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:05.670
Cool, so let's take a look at how would
we go about doing something like this?

30
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.040
I'll grab a fresh playground real quick.

31
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.640
And what we can even do is we can say,
we can make some divs.

32
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.276
And what we'll do is we'll grab,

33
00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:21.340
we'll call this one the header,
we'll call this one the,

34
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.727
let's even pretend that we're
gonna use semantic HTML here.

35
00:02:26.727 --> 00:02:31.130
We'll make the sidebar as a NAV,
that seems legit.

36
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.232
It's not a real app, so

37
00:02:34.232 --> 00:02:36.540
I don't really know what the right
semantic meaning is for the sidebar.

38
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.965
We'll just call the main
section a section,

39
00:02:40.965 --> 00:02:48.627
main content, And we'll add a footer.

40
00:02:48.627 --> 00:02:49.143
That seems good, right?

41
00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.174
Awesome, sweet.

42
00:03:02.962 --> 00:03:04.116
And we'll put it all inside of a main,

43
00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:06.400
cuz we're gonna need
something to have the grid.

44
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.473
And I think looking at this in
context will make a little more sense

45
00:03:11.473 --> 00:03:17.860
than me poking a bunch of buttons in
a tool, but pull request accepted, too.

46
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.590
Cool, cool, cool, so we've got that.

47
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.499
The other thing we're gonna do real
quick is we're going to say that for

48
00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:26.302
our first business right now,
this main section,

49
00:03:26.302 --> 00:03:30.540
one of the ones we didn't talk about,
we saw the width full and height full.

50
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.442
The other one that Tailwind gives you
is width screen and height screen,

51
00:03:36.442 --> 00:03:41.730
which are the view widths and
view heights, so we've got that.

52
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.160
I don't want this responsive view anymore.

53
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.460
There, thank you, cool, cool, cool.

54
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.327
And then what we'll do is we'll say,
class,

55
00:03:54.481 --> 00:03:58.644
It's time for
red 300 to make its appearance.

56
00:03:58.644 --> 00:04:05.573
Cool, and we'll say for
now on the side, I'm thinking green.

57
00:04:08.176 --> 00:04:10.734
I like that, I like the 100 on this one.

58
00:04:10.734 --> 00:04:13.711
Nope, it's not enough, there we go.

59
00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:16.160
And we'll pull in, I'm thinking yellow.

60
00:04:19.894 --> 00:04:25.690
And everything that you can do in regular
CSS, you can jam into utility class.

61
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.500
Again, I will leave it as an exercise
to the reader if you want to.

62
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.520
I will say, sometimes my
decisions are made as the person

63
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.039
who runs the team rather than the person,
and so I am of the like,

64
00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.556
if I let people start escape
hashing all the time,

65
00:04:41.556 --> 00:04:46.450
we will have a mess that I won't be
able to change themes on and stuff.

66
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:52.463
So by default is to use utility classes,
but even I will,

67
00:04:52.463 --> 00:04:58.800
in a PR, it'd be like, okay,
this makes total sense.

68
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.672
Cool, I gotta add a shade to
the other one in a second,

69
00:05:03.672 --> 00:05:06.500
blue, 200 for the footer.

70
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.230
So I want to get a layout
like I had before.

71
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.990
So let's go ahead and let's just start by,
what happens if I just throw on grid,

72
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.490
right?

73
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.596
Cool, all right,
we're kind of getting there.

74
00:05:18.596 --> 00:05:25.120
I'm gonna take that margin off the body,
cool.

75
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.590
All right, I'm getting there,
not totally there.

76
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.384
So we could do stuff like,
I forgot to show you colspan so

77
00:05:34.384 --> 00:05:38.161
we'll do that, too, we can say it has two.

78
00:05:38.161 --> 00:05:41.276
That will do it, right, but you can see,

79
00:05:41.276 --> 00:05:46.082
getting to those various where you
can put the lines in CSS grid,

80
00:05:46.082 --> 00:05:50.620
definitely Tailwind out of
the box is not in my experience.

81
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.706
If somebody can slide into my DMs later
and tell me I'm wrong, in my experience,

82
00:05:54.706 --> 00:05:58.070
it is great for the, I wanna lay
out a bunch of items, not for like,

83
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.480
I want to kind of build that kind
of grid layout for the page.

84
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.400
And you can do a bunch of that stuff,
right?

85
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.658
I could say something like,
was kind of hard, but I'll just show you.

86
00:06:08.658 --> 00:06:14.410
I could say something like, it's got
ones that remind me of tables, right?

87
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.138
Colspan2, I could say something like,
hey, go back.

88
00:06:18.138 --> 00:06:21.690
It's because I dismissed the,
I'm so excited,

89
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.676
span two columns, There we go.

90
00:06:27.676 --> 00:06:33.592
And I could make the footer technically,
All right,

91
00:06:33.592 --> 00:06:38.375
so you can do stuff like that but it's
when you want to move a lot of the a lot

92
00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:41.827
of the lines around instead
of just a very even grid,

93
00:06:41.827 --> 00:06:45.455
like the ones in town with a very good,
very even grid.

94
00:06:45.455 --> 00:06:50.394
You can do some stuff in here as well,
and I will show you and it will be great.

95
00:06:55.359 --> 00:06:59.418
So we can go ahead and
instead of the Cols2,

96
00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:04.370
I'm gonna do,
I believe the grid template, right?

97
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.560
And I think I can do it.

98
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.490
I'm doing this from memory real quick.

99
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.965
Let's do 1, 1fr, I can type,

100
00:07:13.965 --> 00:07:18.854
auto or something like that,

101
00:07:18.854 --> 00:07:23.362
nope, hold on real quick.

102
00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:36.922
All right, we want actually the grid
rows in this case, cool, grid rows.

103
00:07:40.207 --> 00:07:44.922
All right, so that's one fractional
unit auto, that's a little much there.

104
00:07:44.922 --> 00:07:50.586
We'll start with that and we'll say, you
can see that I'm using the underscores.

105
00:07:50.586 --> 00:07:54.271
These are the same, if you were writing
CSS you would put these with a space,

106
00:07:54.271 --> 00:07:55.895
right, and that's effective.

107
00:07:55.895 --> 00:07:59.602
But we can actually,
I wonder if it shows you that super

108
00:07:59.602 --> 00:08:04.126
clearly in the generated CSS or
if I gotta inspect an element here.

109
00:08:04.126 --> 00:08:08.006
Yeah, I'm not I'm not doing that.

110
00:08:08.006 --> 00:08:10.500
But you can actually see what comes out,
but

111
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.070
we can take a look at
the inspector over here.

112
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.359
Effectively, if you look at
the class it's generating,

113
00:08:17.359 --> 00:08:21.220
you can see those underscores make spaces,
right?

114
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.188
So my grid template rose that
is what it comes out to,

115
00:08:25.188 --> 00:08:29.261
you can decide if that makes you happy or
not, right?

116
00:08:29.261 --> 00:08:32.623
I'm here to show you,
you can decide, whether or

117
00:08:32.623 --> 00:08:35.277
not you like it is up to you in this case.

118
00:08:35.277 --> 00:08:40.990
So we could say, let's make this instead,
this one fraction, one fractional unit.

119
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.950
Okay, we're getting there, six maybe.

120
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.783
Yeah, right, so we have that in place, and

121
00:08:51.783 --> 00:08:56.565
then we also need to do
the grid calls where we can

122
00:08:56.565 --> 00:09:00.045
also put in that arbitrary value.

123
00:09:00.045 --> 00:09:03.710
Cuz again, if you just put that one, the
two or three, you're gonna get even ones.

124
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.730
If you want one that's a thinner sidebar,
you need to say like, okay, the first

125
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:12.010
column is about this wide, and then either
auto or take up the rest of the space.

126
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:16.222
So I'm gonna say 1fr, and we'll start with
auto, and we'll see what that gives us,

127
00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:19.293
and I think it's gonna give me
something I don't really want.

128
00:09:19.293 --> 00:09:22.230
Yep, that's the opposite
of what I want almost.

129
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:27.542
And maybe I flipped that and that is what
I want, but I could also say that this may

130
00:09:27.542 --> 00:09:32.960
be six fractional units and all fractional
unit is, is six out of seven, right?

131
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.640
You add them all up and
that's where you go.

132
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.813
That's a little small and
so you can adjust it and

133
00:09:37.813 --> 00:09:39.250
you can do all the min max stuff.

134
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.380
You can put it all in
those utility class names.

135
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.801
Again, I'm not gonna tell you that
you should, I do it, I choose to.

136
00:09:45.801 --> 00:09:50.508
If you're like, nah, this is a bridge
too far, I get it, that's cool, too.

137
00:09:50.508 --> 00:09:54.750
But actually, it is nice because
you know what I can do next?

138
00:09:54.750 --> 00:10:02.000
I could say that this should only
happen at that small viewport, right?

139
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:08.084
Cool, but originally what it should do is,

140
00:10:12.062 --> 00:10:17.044
I'm pretty sure it's gonna get angry with
me with those call spans in a second, but

141
00:10:17.044 --> 00:10:20.405
yeah, so I gotta say that
these only happen at small 2.

142
00:10:25.401 --> 00:10:29.249
And what's nice is, so now, theoretically,
and again, I could tweak this a little bit

143
00:10:29.249 --> 00:10:32.917
more, but theoretically at the smallest
viewport, they're stacked in a column.

144
00:10:32.917 --> 00:10:36.146
As we get bigger,
we get the various different layouts, and

145
00:10:36.146 --> 00:10:38.490
I don't write a bunch of media queries.

146
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:45.810
So you pay the cost of, good luck
explaining that during code review, right?

147
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:50.099
But generally speaking, you get a lot
of the responsive breakpoints very

148
00:10:50.099 --> 00:10:54.060
powerfully and very easily, and
get it all kind of laid out nicely.

149
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:57.346
And so
we could decide that instead of one,

150
00:10:57.346 --> 00:11:02.199
we want to have, we'll say,
rows where we do something like,

151
00:11:06.329 --> 00:11:09.915
1fr and then actually make this 3,

152
00:11:12.967 --> 00:11:20.248
1fr, let's make this 5,
it's got to be underscores.

153
00:11:24.805 --> 00:11:28.110
Right, okay, it needs a little bit of
adjustment, we'll make that maybe a 2.

154
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.294
And so now you get the kind of
fully responsive grid layouts,

155
00:11:31.294 --> 00:11:32.970
you don't think about it.

156
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.340
And once you have it set up,
it's actually pretty elegant.

157
00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.896
I mean, for the various different
viewports, how you want it to change

158
00:11:39.896 --> 00:11:43.644
layout, you can change the call spans,
you can change the order, right?

159
00:11:43.644 --> 00:11:48.000
If I wanna say that,
okay at the small one,

160
00:11:53.025 --> 00:11:57.581
Let's see, I'm doing that from memory,
now I'm winging it.

161
00:11:57.581 --> 00:11:59.421
Yeah, I've gotta play around
with the order a little bit.

162
00:11:59.421 --> 00:12:04.049
But you can, theoretically, set up all the
breakpoints, have your layouts in place.

163
00:12:04.049 --> 00:12:07.042
It does take a little bit
of time to get right, but

164
00:12:07.042 --> 00:12:11.943
the integration with the breakpoints is
what I think makes it worth it, right?

165
00:12:11.943 --> 00:12:15.092
But I am not going to be the one
that tells you, it's the way it is,

166
00:12:15.092 --> 00:12:15.909
this is the way.

167
00:12:15.909 --> 00:12:19.232
I'm gonna say, there are some trade-offs
where I think it's worth it for

168
00:12:19.232 --> 00:12:22.780
a lot of the clarity in this and
the ability to adjust it and to iterate.

169
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.969
I get it that that syntax makes
everyone's feelings hurt.

170
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.142
I think that both can be
true at the same time.

171
00:12:28.142 --> 00:12:30.575
Clear off your afternoon,
sit down with the docs and

172
00:12:30.575 --> 00:12:34.071
you get it to the point where you want
it and then you mostly have it in place.

173
00:12:34.071 --> 00:12:37.499
It's one of those things, you do it
once and it kind of works out, but

174
00:12:37.499 --> 00:12:40.180
the I think the potential is there and
it's worth it.
