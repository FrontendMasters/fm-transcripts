1
00:00:00.245 --> 00:00:02.220
Yes?

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.432
&gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be better
to stick to primary and

3
00:00:05.432 --> 00:00:08.399
secondary colors instead of doing this?

4
00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:10.403
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's a great question.

5
00:00:10.403 --> 00:00:13.936
And let's see,
in the theme of off-roading a little bit,

6
00:00:13.936 --> 00:00:16.139
let's talk a little bit about that.

7
00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.567
So yes, so the question was,
instead of saying blue or

8
00:00:20.567 --> 00:00:25.096
white, wouldn't I wanna say
something like primary or

9
00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:29.760
secondary colors, or
danger, or whatever, right?

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.862
Yes, I do those in our application so
that I don't have to think about this,

11
00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:38.238
especially if I'm using it for
multiple things.

12
00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:40.570
I can change the theme,
so on and so forth.

13
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.330
And you can compose those as well.

14
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.759
The way that I would do it for
the colors in particular is I would go and

15
00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:50.050
extend the theme.

16
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.948
So let's actually look at that.

17
00:00:50.948 --> 00:00:55.950
Let's say our primary color,
Blue is too boring.

18
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.943
We're gonna say our primary color
today is gonna be purple, right?

19
00:01:00.943 --> 00:01:02.960
I want it to be purple.

20
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.635
I can either create a bunch of
those component classes, or

21
00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:09.341
I can go into this configuration, right?

22
00:01:09.341 --> 00:01:12.240
And if you look,
this is a JavaScript file.

23
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.489
That usually lives in
the root of your directory,

24
00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:22.266
typically tailwind.config.your
choice of JS, TS, CJS, MJS.

25
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:27.260
I think also MCTS and
MTS which is, whatever.

26
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.570
And this is an empty one.

27
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.255
And there's a bunch of
really cool things in here.

28
00:01:36.255 --> 00:01:39.020
You can either extend the theme, which is,

29
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.367
take whatever the default theme was and
add more stuff to it, right?

30
00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:44.941
Or you can blow the theme away and

31
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:48.430
just literally replace pieces of
it with your own custom thing.

32
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.982
If you wanna have colors like primary,
secondary,

33
00:01:52.982 --> 00:01:57.850
danger, success,
you can absolutely do that in here.

34
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.359
One of the designers I work with,

35
00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:04.244
comes with a set of shades of
colors from 50 to 950, right?

36
00:02:04.244 --> 00:02:08.888
So 50, then 100, 200, 300, 400,
500, 600, 700, 800, 900 and

37
00:02:08.888 --> 00:02:12.407
950, and I have designers that don't
wanna work with that many colors.

38
00:02:12.407 --> 00:02:15.277
So you could cut it down
to a smaller set of colors.

39
00:02:15.277 --> 00:02:19.910
You could name the colors light, medium,
and dark, all of that is possible.

40
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.947
Nothing about the built-in theme and
any of the semantics of it

41
00:02:24.947 --> 00:02:29.803
really are even something that
you're totally stuck with.

42
00:02:29.803 --> 00:02:33.808
So in a theme of our day of
kinda going with that question,

43
00:02:33.808 --> 00:02:37.481
if we wanted to have this idea
of we want the colors but

44
00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:41.333
we also want primary,
secondary, so on and so forth.

45
00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:44.666
So I can extend the theme and
I can say colors, and

46
00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:48.667
I have two options here,
we'll do the easiest one first.

47
00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:52.203
Let's make a new color called primary,
right?

48
00:02:52.203 --> 00:02:59.439
And I can define all of the various
different shades from 50 to 950,

49
00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:05.025
and I will show you a easy way
to generate a set of styles.

50
00:03:05.025 --> 00:03:06.875
There's a bunch of ways to do this,

51
00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:10.528
I'm gonna show you just a quick
website that's super great for this.

52
00:03:10.528 --> 00:03:15.130
Historically, I've also done it just
in Figma, you can generate a full color

53
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.888
palette and export the Figma color palette
to Tailwind as well, that'll work.

54
00:03:19.888 --> 00:03:26.282
But let's say that we wanna have primary,
and let's just actually say for

55
00:03:26.282 --> 00:03:31.578
now that we're gonna go with light,
medium, dark, right?

56
00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:33.196
We're not gonna do
the whole set of colors,

57
00:03:33.196 --> 00:03:34.800
just to show you how flexible it is.

58
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.321
So we'll say the primary has a light,
and that's going to be,

59
00:03:43.374 --> 00:03:46.622
Who thinks I can guess a light purple
hex code off the top of my head?

60
00:03:46.622 --> 00:03:48.397
Probably can't, and guess what?

61
00:03:48.397 --> 00:03:49.994
I don't have to.

62
00:03:49.994 --> 00:03:51.229
But let's go ahead.

63
00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:55.649
I'm gonna put a color in here and we're
gonna say, I think if I use high numbers,

64
00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:58.444
I should get,
a high number is a lot of red and blue,

65
00:03:58.444 --> 00:04:00.866
should get me most of the way there,
right?

66
00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:06.040
So we'll say CC00CC.

67
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.871
That's probably bright but
it's not particularly light.

68
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:11.330
So it's actually, that's dark.

69
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.364
Let's just call this one dark.

70
00:04:12.364 --> 00:04:17.982
That's gonna be a dark color,
yeah, ish, we'll find out.

71
00:04:17.982 --> 00:04:23.172
Apparently, live coding, okay,
live hex code color guessing,

72
00:04:23.172 --> 00:04:26.332
not my strong suit, but it'll be okay.

73
00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:30.086
So now what we could do is say
that this is gonna bg-primary, and

74
00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:31.347
I call that one dark.

75
00:04:31.347 --> 00:04:33.569
And look, you can see we've
got the autocomplete in there.

76
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.859
That's barely a purple,
it's a medium-ish purple at best,

77
00:04:39.859 --> 00:04:44.651
but I'm not actually stuck
with that whole shade system.

78
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:48.302
I could call this banana if I wanted to,
right?

79
00:04:48.302 --> 00:04:52.563
I shouldn't because my teammates
will hate me, but I could.

80
00:04:52.563 --> 00:04:56.289
And so you can opt into, in no way, if
there's any of the semantics of Tailwind

81
00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.240
you don't like,
you're not opted into any of them, right?

82
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.088
You can kind of just use it as
effectively a build system for

83
00:05:02.088 --> 00:05:05.649
the way that you wish it was set up,
and you're not stuck with anything.

84
00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:08.295
And there's an escape hatch at all points,
too,

85
00:05:08.295 --> 00:05:10.442
that I'll show you in about one second.

86
00:05:10.442 --> 00:05:12.836
So you can say dark.

87
00:05:12.836 --> 00:05:16.742
The other thing I can do
in here is I can also say,

88
00:05:22.938 --> 00:05:24.720
Give it a default one.

89
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.050
And now, I can literally
just call bg-primary, right?

90
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.940
So I can make the danger, success,
so on and so forth, as well.

91
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.383
The other thing that you can do here, and,

92
00:05:44.747 --> 00:05:48.861
[SOUND] Hold on,
that's probably too many braces.

93
00:05:57.948 --> 00:06:03.370
Now primary is, we want one more in there.

94
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.799
Theme, return, primary,

95
00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:21.506
Cool, so now I have primary back.

96
00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:24.414
There's no default on that one, so
I gotta change it in a second, but

97
00:06:24.414 --> 00:06:25.985
now it is all of the shades of purple.

98
00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:29.389
So you can easily say that,
okay, success is gonna be green,

99
00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:34.119
danger's gonna be red, warning's gonna be
yellow, and you can grab those things.

100
00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:36.858
And if you then change what purple is,
guess what?

101
00:06:36.858 --> 00:06:38.495
Primary also changes, right?

102
00:06:38.495 --> 00:06:41.260
So you can begin to compose
the entire theme based on this.

103
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.649
So now I can go primary,
and I can say 700, and

104
00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:49.930
that is a purple button, and
it's the full range of shades of purple.

105
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.933
And I could add additional,
if I wanted a 750 in there,

106
00:06:52.933 --> 00:06:55.709
that's not the default theme,
I can add it in there.

107
00:06:55.709 --> 00:07:00.110
If I wanted to put back a default in
there as 500, I can also do that as well.

108
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.280
Let's just do it just for funsies.

109
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.136
So we'll do that, and we'll say

110
00:07:07.136 --> 00:07:12.983
the default is theme.colors.purple,

111
00:07:12.983 --> 00:07:16.667
nope, purple.500.

112
00:07:16.667 --> 00:07:18.630
I think I got a JavaScript.

113
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.039
Cool, so now I should be able to just
actually go back to the bg-primary if I

114
00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:26.041
wanted to, right?

115
00:07:26.041 --> 00:07:28.505
And that's gonna be
purple 500 at this point.

116
00:07:28.505 --> 00:07:31.927
So everything is extensible,
I can call the colors whatever I want,

117
00:07:31.927 --> 00:07:34.471
we'll actually just
generate some colors later.

118
00:07:34.471 --> 00:07:38.115
We can make that our primary color that
we go through, so on and so forth.

119
00:07:38.115 --> 00:07:40.707
So everything is super extensible,
and you can,

120
00:07:40.707 --> 00:07:43.919
to answer that question,
call the colors whatever you want,

121
00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:48.015
add a totally different color palette,
make them a little bit more semantic.

122
00:07:48.015 --> 00:07:50.320
I usually do that in almost all
the apps that I'm building, so yeah.
