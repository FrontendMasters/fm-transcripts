1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.200
So, yeah,
we saw it with the horizontal spacing.

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.045
So why don't you just
take a few minutes and

3
00:00:05.045 --> 00:00:07.850
I'm gonna give you two of these at once.

4
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.815
We've got space and
then it's got its friend, divide, and

5
00:00:11.815 --> 00:00:14.710
they are semantically basically the same.

6
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.480
Divide is almost exactly like space,
except for the fact that it puts a border.

7
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.828
So if you had a sidebar
with a bunch of dividers,

8
00:00:25.828 --> 00:00:29.840
divide, right, in between them,

9
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.322
is the same as space but
it puts a border bottom for

10
00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:39.105
all except the last in this case.

11
00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:42.880
And so, we'll go through and just add a
border to separate them instead of space.

12
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.230
They effectively do the same thing.

13
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.340
So I'll show you both of them.

14
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.935
And then in that space section,
go ahead and

15
00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:56.474
just kinda try them out,
see can separate these very close together

16
00:00:56.474 --> 00:01:01.354
menu items to kind of have them
a little bit more spread out?

17
00:01:03.886 --> 00:01:04.673
All right, so again,

18
00:01:04.673 --> 00:01:07.290
we're just kind of playing around with
some of these space and utilities.

19
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.210
We'll open this up and
go put where I can edit it,

20
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.360
we've got some of the basics in here.

21
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.967
One, I'm, over a course of
time I've tried to sneak a few

22
00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:25.765
little extra like utility classes
in there that maybe don't

23
00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:30.375
necessarily warrant their own
their own discussion, but

24
00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:36.800
this is basically the max width for the
content, it's going down to a CSS class.

25
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.910
Again, at any given point, you can hover
over, you can see the CSS class as well.

26
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.140
Text center does what you
think it does as well.

27
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.450
Nothing else special and new in this case.

28
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.060
So we could do something like
space y 10 like we saw earlier.

29
00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.761
How do we want x actually,
x we can do let's start with divide,

30
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:06.433
you'll kind of see
the difference in this case

31
00:02:15.893 --> 00:02:22.303
There's not as many options, so this puts
a border in there and you kind of see it.

32
00:02:22.303 --> 00:02:25.944
The way the padding works is a little
iffy like this was the spacing exercise,

33
00:02:25.944 --> 00:02:27.624
we can see kind of both in this case,

34
00:02:27.624 --> 00:02:30.450
I do need to define what it
looks like in that sense.

35
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.840
You can't combine space and divide though.

36
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.340
So that's the only issue
you got to think about.

37
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.885
So I can do a border color of,
let's say, Cyan 300, all right?

38
00:02:46.714 --> 00:02:49.970
You can see it looking
a little crazy there.

39
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.950
All right, so we've got all that,
we've got the divide in there.

40
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.019
The other thing that I did
wanna show you real quick is,

41
00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.530
I don't know if this is the best,
I'll do it another div here.

42
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.070
You kind of saw it in the auto
complete a second ago.

43
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.173
Take a look where I can say,
let's say class BG,

44
00:03:11.173 --> 00:03:16.780
I don't know if I can call that,
it's not gray, it's a lot of them.

45
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.592
All right, and
we'll say that the width is,

46
00:03:25.716 --> 00:03:29.569
And the height is 10, just a box,

47
00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.360
make it a little bit bigger than that,
96 and 96.

48
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.900
What happens if you
need a negative amount?

49
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.060
There's an easy shorthand for
that as well.

50
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.800
And so we'll just make another one, we'll
say it's got a height of 20, width of 20.

51
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.190
And we'll give this one
a background color of blue.

52
00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.600
If I give it a margin of 20,

53
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.060
right, it gets a margin of 20.

54
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.734
We see mx in this case,
give this one padding instead.

55
00:04:14.332 --> 00:04:17.040
Height, width, okay, cool.

56
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.270
What is that?

57
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.066
Height and width,
we'll say I can do negative, and

58
00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:27.320
these will just be a negative margin,
right?

59
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.416
So if you ever need a negative value,
you just put a subtraction sign in front

60
00:04:31.416 --> 00:04:34.640
of it, you will get the negative
version of that value.

61
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.106
So now it's the margin of -1.25 rem.

62
00:04:39.106 --> 00:04:42.010
So, I mostly saw that as we were
looking at the other thing,

63
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.650
figured I'd mention it, negative values.

64
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.439
Also if you've ever find
yourself truly need important,

65
00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:51.620
you can just put an exclamation
point before it.

66
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.102
So there is little nuances
to the short hand as we go

67
00:04:56.102 --> 00:05:00.550
through everything as well, and cool.

68
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.075
The only thing I suddenly mess
up before I tried to call it

69
00:05:04.075 --> 00:05:08.550
a border is actually a divide of
the color that I want as well.

70
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.882
So, we can go put that in
place as well over here,

71
00:05:12.882 --> 00:05:17.029
we'll see what that
actually turns out to be.

72
00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:20.437
We'll just say divide, and
we'll make it cyan, just so

73
00:05:20.437 --> 00:05:22.860
it's absolutely ridiculous looking.

74
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.150
We'll get rid of that giant
red box that we made, right?

75
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.342
And you can see that it's a border color,
but

76
00:05:30.342 --> 00:05:34.830
it's doing some extra like fun stuff in
there as well to like show it correctly.

77
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.495
And we could add the padding in here and

78
00:05:36.495 --> 00:05:39.600
get effectively divider in
between each every one of them.

79
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.090
You can kinda see it better
in this example here.

80
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.425
I tend to use it for

81
00:05:43.425 --> 00:05:49.360
those like sidebars where you might
have a bunch of menu items in this case.

82
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.512
But both of work and

83
00:05:50.512 --> 00:05:55.050
I use space a lot more than I use divide
because I just don't need it as much.

84
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.084
But I find myself needing to space things
out a lot more often than I find myself

85
00:05:58.084 --> 00:05:59.639
needing to put dividers between them.

86
00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:03.147
But they are both super
helpful utility methods that,

87
00:06:03.147 --> 00:06:06.654
again, are doing a little
bit of tomfoolery with CSS,

88
00:06:06.654 --> 00:06:10.867
you just get for free because they
are kind of a reusable pattern.
