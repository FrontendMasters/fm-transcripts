1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.600
At a high level,
I will just kind of talk about plugins.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.615
And I think that's kind of final piece and

3
00:00:05.615 --> 00:00:08.580
then you are you all get your
like Tailwind merit badge.

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.210
Generally speaking,

5
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.040
it's not we did a workshop on the recently
where you can like add all this power and

6
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.947
functionality and stuff along those
lines into your build system.

7
00:00:20.947 --> 00:00:25.481
A lot of the plugins for
Tailwind are just nice ways of

8
00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:30.750
packaging up stuff that you
could have done in those layers.

9
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.066
And so, it is useful if you've
got multiple codebases and

10
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.583
you wanna be able to
port that stuff around.

11
00:00:36.583 --> 00:00:40.704
Or the other version of that if
you are running a consultancy and

12
00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:45.864
you wanna have a pack of the stuff that
you use all the time, it is super useful.

13
00:00:45.864 --> 00:00:51.395
But, I think, let's actually
look at the plugin API here,

14
00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:56.800
because I think it does a really
good job of showing it.

15
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.301
It is effectively a function where
you get, and you can kinda tell,

16
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:04.560
what you're getting yourself into with
this addUtilities, addComponents.

17
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.429
What do you think that does?

18
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.460
The same thing that was in your style.

19
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.768
But what's super powerful about it is
then you can publish it up to NPM, and

20
00:01:11.768 --> 00:01:14.320
it actually wires itself
into that IntelliSense.

21
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.127
So here's one, the way that I
use it is on our marketing site,

22
00:01:19.127 --> 00:01:21.540
we have a bunch of typography.

23
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.298
Obviously what a h1 looks like on mobile,

24
00:01:25.298 --> 00:01:29.320
what it looks like on every screen
size is a different set of text.

25
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.953
LG, and then MD text, whatever, and
so I have a plug in that is just

26
00:01:35.953 --> 00:01:41.360
I say typography for the display and
hierarchy for a heading.

27
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.429
And then at each viewpoint, it's got
all the breakpoints in there, right?

28
00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.018
And I can use that across our
documentation site, our marketing site,

29
00:01:50.018 --> 00:01:54.912
all the different places and I don't have
to like port that over by hand I just

30
00:01:54.912 --> 00:01:57.770
bumped the dependency and
we are good to go.

31
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.600
I do wanna draw your attention to one of

32
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.520
the official ones that I
use a lot in the website.

33
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.403
It says tailwindworkshop.forsell.app, and
you just go I'll show you my own repo

34
00:02:11.403 --> 00:02:15.182
you can look at the code,
cuz that's all in tailwind as well, and

35
00:02:15.182 --> 00:02:18.320
you can kind of see some
of the pieces that I used.

36
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.825
I'll show you one of
the official ones that I use.

37
00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:23.130
There are two that I use a lot and

38
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.101
I'll just draw them to your attention,
but really the major thing

39
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:33.280
that I do with plugins is kind of
then adding the base styles, right?

40
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.914
So now I have one plug-in NPM install
like our I actually just we have

41
00:02:37.914 --> 00:02:43.390
the files like internally that we use
cuz they're just functions, right?

42
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.257
It's just literally,
you hand their Tailwind/plugin a function,

43
00:02:48.257 --> 00:02:52.140
in there you get addUtilities,
addComponents.

44
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.870
You get access to the configuration file.

45
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.960
You get access to the theme file,
so you can patch the theme.

46
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.630
You can read stuff from their
current theme and extend it.

47
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.256
So, it's just basically a way to use
JavaScript to package up everything

48
00:03:05.256 --> 00:03:10.178
that would happen that you would do in one
of these styles in a much more portable

49
00:03:10.178 --> 00:03:11.000
format.

50
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
But I'll show you some of the plugins
that I think are also really good.

51
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.990
And we saw that thing with has before.

52
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.616
The other one that's kinda cool is the
addVariant, but there's not a lot going

53
00:03:22.616 --> 00:03:26.702
on there, you basically give it
the same syntax you would do like end.

54
00:03:26.702 --> 00:03:31.608
The hover pseudo class that
we saw like variant is just

55
00:03:31.608 --> 00:03:36.636
end colon hover, but
you call it hover colon, right?

56
00:03:36.636 --> 00:03:41.420
it does the post CSS nesting for
you and just wires it all up,

57
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.263
it's just a nice way to
package everything up.

58
00:03:45.263 --> 00:03:50.250
The one that I use a lot that,
what I used on the site that you we've

59
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.994
been looking at all day
is Tailwind typography.

60
00:03:53.994 --> 00:03:58.998
Basically, it gives you this new prose
class that is just like decent headings,

61
00:03:58.998 --> 00:04:00.396
decent line spacing,

62
00:04:00.396 --> 00:04:04.790
it did give me those back ticks like
they use it on the site, right?

63
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.449
All of that was the Tailwind typography
plug-in that basically you can just write

64
00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.272
Markdown and it will look good,

65
00:04:11.272 --> 00:04:15.614
as long as you put a prose around will
keep everything from getting too wide.

66
00:04:15.614 --> 00:04:18.595
All the little stuff that is tedious,
cuz I'm gonna be honest, I don't really

67
00:04:18.595 --> 00:04:21.750
understand line height, I just know
that I don't like it when it looks bad.

68
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.704
And this gives me relatively good line
height, good typography, good headings,

69
00:04:25.704 --> 00:04:27.790
good everything along those lines.

70
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.280
That one is super simple,

71
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.460
we use it on a site anytime we're
gonna render content and Markdown.

72
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.457
We throw the pros class on it,
it gets laid out really nicely, and

73
00:04:37.457 --> 00:04:39.620
everything's great.

74
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.205
The forums when I don't use
because we have a very specific

75
00:04:44.205 --> 00:04:46.742
design language in that sense.

76
00:04:46.742 --> 00:04:51.558
The one that I really love, and
we talked a little bit about

77
00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:55.685
this which is some of
the things that are plugins or

78
00:04:55.685 --> 00:05:02.820
plugins presently because they are maybe
not full on web standards are in CSS yet.

79
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.021
And so if they're in core, there's like
a little bit of an expectation that you're

80
00:05:06.021 --> 00:05:07.340
not gonna make breaking changes.

81
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.554
If they are a plugin,

82
00:05:08.554 --> 00:05:12.640
like the expectations that you
have are slightly different.

83
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.210
And so container queries are a CSS
feature that this just gives you

84
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.800
utility methods for.

85
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.084
And container queries are the thing you
always wanted that you never knew that you

86
00:05:23.084 --> 00:05:26.928
had, that you wanted, which is we
saw those responsive breakpoints for

87
00:05:26.928 --> 00:05:28.850
a wide screen agenda queries.

88
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.460
How wide is the div that I'm in, right?

89
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.948
So if that div is only 300 pixels wide,

90
00:05:36.948 --> 00:05:42.960
then you might choose the layout and
flex column versus that div ends up.

91
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.156
Even that grid layout that we saw before,

92
00:05:45.156 --> 00:05:49.210
I might choose to then have all
the contents in that sidebar in a flexbox.

93
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.746
And if it was a wide even on a smaller
screen, then I want it to be a row,

94
00:05:53.746 --> 00:05:57.843
versus if it ends up as a sidebar,
then I want it to be a column.

95
00:05:57.843 --> 00:06:03.369
And it allows the browser just say,
okay, what is the container that I'm in?

96
00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:05.789
And remember doing that in JavaScript
you gotta get the client with and

97
00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:07.140
all that it's terrible.

98
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.540
I'll actually show it to you
in this code base real quick.

99
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.100
Cool, let's grab it.

100
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.225
I use it in that CSS grid thing and
we saw earlier, so we'll go to,

101
00:06:24.978 --> 00:06:28.394
Say, do I have it readily available?

102
00:06:38.678 --> 00:06:42.073
So you basically can put it @container,

103
00:06:42.073 --> 00:06:46.830
which is very much like when
we saw peer and group, right?

104
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.850
You can do container,
you can also do one with a slash as well.

105
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.424
And what it will do in those
senses is it will go ahead and

106
00:06:53.424 --> 00:06:56.160
allow you to have different nested ones.

107
00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.640
You can be like, hey, I am an element,
I could be a child way down the DOM tree.

108
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.930
And it's like, if this container is wide,
I wanna render like this.

109
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.510
I use it like, hey, make the text
smaller if we're in a very small div.

110
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:16.250
And go either flex row,
enlarge your text if we're in a wider one.

111
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.820
Not necessarily the viewport of the entire
app, but just the div that we're in.

112
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.834
The fact that I don't have
to do that in JavaScript, or

113
00:07:23.834 --> 00:07:26.680
try to just have heuristics,
is the greatest thing ever.

114
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.359
So then you can do something like,

115
00:07:33.555 --> 00:07:39.570
Here's an example where I say, add extra
small, make the text size base, right?

116
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:44.602
You're gonna have the font size changes
based on the container that it's in,

117
00:07:44.602 --> 00:07:49.570
so even if it's flexible in size,
the other things make total sense as well.

118
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.902
And so that's a plugin that you can just
install on this just NPM install, and

119
00:07:52.902 --> 00:07:55.825
I'll show you the Tailwind config
that I'm using for this app, and

120
00:07:55.825 --> 00:07:57.330
you can go take a look at it as well.

121
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.026
There's a few other tasty notes in here
that we'll look at, and then we'll

122
00:08:01.026 --> 00:08:04.721
kind of open it up for just larger
questions, which is you NPM install them,

123
00:08:04.721 --> 00:08:08.480
you can pull them in, you throw
them in this plugins array, right?

124
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.130
And that's it, and then you have those
container queries, and it's great.

125
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.090
You should do it, it's wonderful.

126
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.160
And the typography again,
you put the pros on it, it's great.

127
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.015
The only ways I really extended this
theme is I changed the fonts out, right?

128
00:08:21.015 --> 00:08:25.870
So the sans font is now like some font
that I found on font source that I liked.

129
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.837
That stupid title display font
that I sometimes regret, but

130
00:08:28.837 --> 00:08:31.930
now I've already shown it to you,
and I can't ever change it.

131
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.100
And then one of my
favorite monospace fonts.

132
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:39.022
The other part is that content, which is
the glob that it will use to figure out

133
00:08:39.022 --> 00:08:43.210
where to look for CSS classes to
figure out what to purge, right?

134
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.810
By default, it will look at HTML.

135
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.212
You don't put your CSS file in there,

136
00:08:49.212 --> 00:08:54.150
because then you won't purge anything,
cuz it'll be in the thing.

137
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:58.150
But like for instance, I wrote Svelte and
Markdown and stuff along those lines.

138
00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.953
So if you're using other files where
you're referencing these classes,

139
00:09:00.953 --> 00:09:02.370
you do need to include them.

140
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.450
But that's I kind of set it and forget it.

141
00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.790
But beyond that some of these
plugins are really powerful.

142
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.821
And there's again like most things
you can there's an awesome list for

143
00:09:09.821 --> 00:09:11.010
every given library.

144
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:15.566
There's awesome Tailwind,
awesome whatever, and it's a like 1000

145
00:09:15.566 --> 00:09:20.000
plugins that I look really cool and
I don't have a use case for.

146
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.640
But that doesn't mean that you don't,
that just means I don't,

147
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.940
worth taking a look at.

148
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.373
I do think that the container
core is one and

149
00:09:27.373 --> 00:09:30.754
the typography one are almost
like worth the cost of entry,

150
00:09:30.754 --> 00:09:34.761
because I think they're really
powerful and solve a lot of problems.
