00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.696
So, let's talk a little bit
about these base styles.

2
00:00:03.696 --> 00:00:08.534
If you look at this little
playground right here,

3
00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:12.230
I told you it was aggressive, right?

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.934
I believe that's a button, right?

5
00:00:14.934 --> 00:00:21.804
I literally had to read the text that
I wrote to remember what that was,

6
00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:28.217
because that button is not
looking particularly button-like.

7
00:00:28.217 --> 00:00:30.176
You can see that I have
an input placeholder in there.

8
00:00:30.176 --> 00:00:33.826
Otherwise, it would be hard to tell
it's input, but I can click on it.

9
00:00:33.826 --> 00:00:35.857
See, that makes it more
clear it's an input.

10
00:00:35.857 --> 00:00:40.794
And this is technically a button,
but it has no styles whatsoever.

11
00:00:40.794 --> 00:00:42.627
And so
this normalizes across the browsers.

12
00:00:42.627 --> 00:00:43.313
But yeah,

13
00:00:43.313 --> 00:00:48.433
there's a certain amount of base styles
that you will have to set up as you go in.

14
00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:50.212
So let's actually take this one.

15
00:00:50.212 --> 00:00:51.348
We're gonna open it up.

16
00:00:51.348 --> 00:00:54.930
And let's actually look at
taking that base layer and

17
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.802
adding some of those core styles in there.

18
00:00:57.802 --> 00:00:59.486
So I've opened up in the playground.

19
00:00:59.486 --> 00:01:00.939
I've got various views here.

20
00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:04.920
I've got a responsive view that we'll use
a little bit later when we talk about

21
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.318
responsive breakpoints.

22
00:01:06.318 --> 00:01:12.101
I can do this up and down version,
or I can do a left and right.

23
00:01:12.101 --> 00:01:17.987
You could also see the generated
CSS as you go along as well.

24
00:01:17.987 --> 00:01:21.647
Other than basically the preflight,
which is the base styles,

25
00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:25.848
there's not a lot in here just yet,
but it's basically going through and

26
00:01:25.848 --> 00:01:30.455
trying to make it so that all the little
browser peculiarities are taken care of,

27
00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:32.788
and you don't have to think about them.

28
00:01:32.788 --> 00:01:36.041
And so that when you start to
build out your own styles,

29
00:01:36.041 --> 00:01:40.357
you get to the point where it's like,
you're not worrying about like,

30
00:01:40.357 --> 00:01:44.412
does Firefox do this differently than,
let's be clear, Safari.

31
00:01:44.412 --> 00:01:47.278
And all of those things as well.

32
00:01:47.278 --> 00:01:48.765
So the most part,

33
00:01:48.765 --> 00:01:54.529
our day to day is actually putting
these utility classes in the HTML.

34
00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:59.369
And to be clear, yes,
React, JSX, Vue, Svelte,

35
00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.999
anything that takes a CSS class,
this all works.

36
00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:08.954
And I hope, honestly,
having components that you then reuse and

37
00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:12.930
have these classes in them
is super helpful as well.

38
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.398
But it's anywhere that you can use
classes, you can use tailwind.

39
00:02:16.398 --> 00:02:20.371
And so integrating it with
whatever your current setup is,

40
00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:22.363
is fairly straightforward.

41
00:02:22.363 --> 00:02:27.210
It's going to spit out a CSS file as
long as that CSS file is referenced

42
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.818
in your production build it,
that's it, right?

43
00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:34.098
There's not a lot of like, well, I've
got to get this all wired up just right.

44
00:02:34.098 --> 00:02:38.741
It's pretty, and
we'll see in a little bit.

45
00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:43.714
And then this is kind of what a basic kind

46
00:02:43.714 --> 00:02:48.248
of version of a CSS file looks like.

47
00:02:48.248 --> 00:02:49.800
I've got this apply in here.

48
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.179
And all I've done here so far is,
because it literally strips

49
00:02:55.179 --> 00:03:00.558
everything out, I have put a little
bit of a margin around it so

50
00:03:00.558 --> 00:03:04.812
that if I get rid of this,
you can see my preview.

51
00:03:04.812 --> 00:03:07.255
It's really up against there, and

52
00:03:07.255 --> 00:03:10.847
in my little widgets in there,
I wanted some space.

53
00:03:10.847 --> 00:03:12.553
So that's it.

54
00:03:12.553 --> 00:03:16.029
But we've got this apply and
the ability to take any utility classes.

55
00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.616
And you can kind of hover over and
see what it is in practicality.

56
00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:24.308
The first thing you might notice

57
00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:28.488
is m-8 is 2 rems, right?

58
00:03:28.488 --> 00:03:29.927
Which is a scale of unit.

59
00:03:29.927 --> 00:03:34.460
And then if I do 4, you kinda see
the autocomplete here as well.

60
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.027
4 is 1.

61
00:03:36.027 --> 00:03:42.896
And so kind of the way the scale works
here is you've got 1 rem, then you have 8.

62
00:03:42.896 --> 00:03:45.945
You can take a lucky guess what 16 is,
right?

63
00:03:45.945 --> 00:03:48.607
And so it goes all the way up.

64
00:03:48.607 --> 00:03:51.376
I think,
depending on which one you're using,

65
00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:55.775
we can take a look at the default style
in a little bit, default theme rather.

66
00:03:55.775 --> 00:03:59.675
But depending on which one, there's
certain upper bounds, but if you're like,

67
00:03:59.675 --> 00:04:03.202
I need one bigger than that, we'll look
at how to extend the theme as well.

68
00:04:03.202 --> 00:04:07.340
And you can either replace it
wholesale with your own theme, or

69
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.554
you can extend it with
anything you want as well.

70
00:04:10.554 --> 00:04:12.981
And both are totally reasonable options.

71
00:04:12.981 --> 00:04:16.634
We do it all the time for things
that we're using constantly as well.

72
00:04:16.634 --> 00:04:19.890
And so do you make the higher class or
stuff for

73
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.758
some of our branding,
like stars in the background?

74
00:04:23.758 --> 00:04:27.439
That can just be a background
bg slash bg just stars.

75
00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:30.438
And now I've got that background
image everywhere as well.

76
00:04:30.438 --> 00:04:31.932
It can all happen in the theme, too.

77
00:04:31.932 --> 00:04:36.191
And so we'll take a look
at that at one point, too.

78
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:41.130
Awesome, so this @apply is just
gonna take those utility classes and

79
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.589
allow you to use the PostCSS to, quote
unquote, apply them in there as well.

80
00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:54.968
The other thing that you have available to
you is I really wanna write regular CSS,

81
00:04:54.968 --> 00:05:00.325
but I do wanna pull in
the colors on my theme, right?

82
00:05:00.325 --> 00:05:03.296
That is totally doable too,
so instead of this,

83
00:05:03.296 --> 00:05:08.159
we could say something like, let's say
I'll keep that for a second actually.

84
00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.479
And we'll say the background-color.

85
00:05:14.948 --> 00:05:17.686
So regular CSS and
I get the theme function,

86
00:05:17.686 --> 00:05:19.988
which is a CSS function in this case.

87
00:05:19.988 --> 00:05:23.791
CSS variables work,
all CSS is fair game, right?

88
00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:26.660
You're not opting out of anything and
going to some walled garden.

89
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.618
It's all fair game,
it's just a bunch of conveniences for you.

90
00:05:29.618 --> 00:05:30.893
So the theme, and

91
00:05:30.893 --> 00:05:35.408
you can kinda see all the things
that I can tweak in here as well.

92
00:05:35.408 --> 00:05:39.064
There is background color,
so on and so forth.

93
00:05:39.064 --> 00:05:41.820
I was gonna grab just regular color,
but let's try it out.

94
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.533
So now, these are colors that we'll
learn how to extend them later.

95
00:05:45.533 --> 00:05:48.517
But these are kind of the colors that
are built into the default theme.

96
00:05:48.517 --> 00:05:51.803
And so if I wanna write regular CSS, but

97
00:05:51.803 --> 00:05:57.091
I also want to be able to hook into
the theme, I can also do that.

98
00:05:57.091 --> 00:06:02.167
So this line right here, and

99
00:06:02.167 --> 00:06:08.096
if I also said bg-red-700.

100
00:06:08.096 --> 00:06:09.916
Not the @ there though.

101
00:06:09.916 --> 00:06:13.711
Those are effectively putting
the same thing in there, right?

102
00:06:13.711 --> 00:06:16.739
This is giving me the opacity of 1, right?

103
00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:19.915
It's doing some CSS variable magic, but

104
00:06:19.915 --> 00:06:24.188
these are effectively giving
me the exact same output.

105
00:06:24.188 --> 00:06:29.607
And so depending on what you're seeking to
do, both of these are available to you.

106
00:06:29.607 --> 00:06:36.525
And so, for the most part in our apps,
we predominantly use this pattern.

107
00:06:36.525 --> 00:06:41.726
But if I do need to get down to a lower
level and just access the theme directly,

108
00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:45.102
this is also a very reasonable
thing to do as well.

109
00:06:45.102 --> 00:06:48.270
And so theoretically, you could
just pull in a tailwind theme and

110
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.508
use none of tailwind, right,
other than hooking into the theme.

111
00:06:51.508 --> 00:06:55.035
And that's totally fine as well.

112
00:06:55.035 --> 00:07:00.312
Awesome, and so
let's actually make that side-by-side.

113
00:07:00.312 --> 00:07:03.197
So we have a lot of the stuff in place,
and like I said,

114
00:07:03.197 --> 00:07:06.358
you can kinda see that there
are a bunch of the basics here.

115
00:07:06.358 --> 00:07:13.017
And anything that I adjust here, I can
also say like if we change this to 32.

116
00:07:13.017 --> 00:07:14.441
Not every number is represented in there.

117
00:07:14.441 --> 00:07:17.079
They are kind of like these scales up,
right?

118
00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:18.976
And you can go look at
the theme at any point or

119
00:07:18.976 --> 00:07:21.863
you can just trust your good friend,
autocomplete, to help you.

120
00:07:21.863 --> 00:07:24.852
I think both of those
are totally fine ways to do it.

121
00:07:24.852 --> 00:07:29.948
And so we wanna start to
flesh out what the basic,

122
00:07:29.948 --> 00:07:32.693
that kind of base styles.

123
00:07:32.693 --> 00:07:36.146
The other thing we might do is
put it inside of that base layer.

124
00:07:36.146 --> 00:07:39.587
That way, it's bundled up
with those preflight styles.

125
00:07:39.587 --> 00:07:41.278
And so we kinda get that all together.

126
00:07:41.278 --> 00:07:45.464
So we can actually say, @layer base, and

127
00:07:45.464 --> 00:07:50.826
then I can say something like,
we can grab the button.

128
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.622
And we can say apply.

129
00:07:56.622 --> 00:08:02.557
I could say bg, what color we like, blue?

130
00:08:02.557 --> 00:08:05.779
All buttons are blue, right?

131
00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:07.461
bg-blue, right?

132
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:12.055
And you can start to see some
of the shape of a button, right?

133
00:08:12.055 --> 00:08:16.262
I could say that I want the left and

134
00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:23.481
right padding to be 2 and
the up and down padding to be 1.

135
00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:24.848
It's starting to look like a button.

136
00:08:24.848 --> 00:08:29.567
I can say that I want
the text to be white, right?

137
00:08:29.567 --> 00:08:33.272
And you can see a lot of these
are like name says bg-blue-500.

138
00:08:33.272 --> 00:08:37.512
It is very clear when you look at this
later, what that is doing, right?

139
00:08:37.512 --> 00:08:41.845
It's very clear when I look at this, the
rough shape of the styles in this point,

140
00:08:41.845 --> 00:08:45.173
and there's a lot of them that
are kind of nicely overloaded.
