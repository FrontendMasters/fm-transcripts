1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So now, we've got a set of these.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.132
We've got some basic ideas, but
these input fields are not great, right?

3
00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:12.944
What we'd love to do is have something
where we can have, the required or

4
00:00:12.944 --> 00:00:18.587
disabled field is styled a little
bit differently than a regular one.

5
00:00:18.587 --> 00:00:20.499
Maybe we've got the disabled button.

6
00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.243
You have terms and conditions, so
on and so forth, with the checkbox.

7
00:00:24.243 --> 00:00:29.213
But we wanna take kind of this other basic
one, we're gonna then build on top of it,

8
00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:33.137
but getting our hands dirty with
some of these various variants.

9
00:00:33.137 --> 00:00:37.308
And feel free to, you want to see
what the outer range one does,

10
00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:41.034
you can modify the HTML,
go put a range slider on there.

11
00:00:41.034 --> 00:00:46.225
You wanna try out different ones,
go for it, do some of the basics,

12
00:00:46.225 --> 00:00:49.868
but then I think take a few
minutes after that and

13
00:00:49.868 --> 00:00:55.176
see what other weird mad science you
can kind of do with some of these.

14
00:00:55.176 --> 00:00:58.524
And then I will then also
take us on a ride and

15
00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:01.787
add a little bit more UX niceties as well.

16
00:01:06.111 --> 00:01:12.049
So let's take a look at what we got here.

17
00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.787
So we wanna just add some basic styling
here based on a lot of these variants, and

18
00:01:16.787 --> 00:01:19.774
we'll kind of play around
with some as well here.

19
00:01:19.774 --> 00:01:25.434
So we've got this idea of
some basic styling for

20
00:01:25.434 --> 00:01:28.554
any given field, right?

21
00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:33.464
And, yes, if there's a piece of you going,
should I make that a component class,

22
00:01:33.464 --> 00:01:34.459
maybe, right?

23
00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:37.013
I feel like input fields and
the borders on them,

24
00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:40.269
I feel a lot safer about than I
feel some other places, right?

25
00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:41.891
There's nothing stopping
you from doing this.

26
00:01:41.891 --> 00:01:45.643
I'm not saying you can't do it,
I'm just saying I have done it and

27
00:01:45.643 --> 00:01:47.319
I have lived to tell the tale.

28
00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.675
And I still do it, [LAUGH] right,
I'm just giving you

29
00:01:51.675 --> 00:01:56.924
the cautionary tale as a level
of responsibility in this case.

30
00:01:56.924 --> 00:02:02.131
Okay, so with that preamble
aside we can do something

31
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:06.577
like, border-2, border-purple.

32
00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:11.049
I don't even know, 600 seems good.

33
00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.251
That was for the label,
we don't want that, and so

34
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:16.499
we'll put that on the input field.

35
00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:20.249
Cool.

36
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.890
Don't exactly know what I used last time,
but this all seems pretty good to me.

37
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.609
Maybe I used something a little
lighter if I look at it.

38
00:02:38.128 --> 00:02:41.258
All right, so we've got that in place, and

39
00:02:41.258 --> 00:02:45.242
we'll play around with some
other ones in a little bit.

40
00:02:45.242 --> 00:02:50.160
For the disabled one,
we saw that before as well.

41
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.451
And so we can do class,
we'll do the basics in here.

42
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:56.722
And the nice part is we can actually,

43
00:02:56.722 --> 00:03:00.179
if we did make a composable class,
we can say disabled.

44
00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:04.665
We can say bg- I don't know,
purple-50, that seems good.

45
00:03:04.665 --> 00:03:10.981
And that border of 2, right?

46
00:03:10.981 --> 00:03:14.240
The nice part is, this pseudo class,
this disabled, right?

47
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.899
We don't have to know that it's disabled.

48
00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:18.557
This is making that pseudo selector.

49
00:03:18.557 --> 00:03:19.789
I can put this one on.

50
00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:23.933
This can be one of the reusable ones
because it's not gonna match on that other

51
00:03:23.933 --> 00:03:24.713
one, right?

52
00:03:24.713 --> 00:03:27.840
Cuz this one is the required one.

53
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.000
It's not disabled and so
I can have all the different states.

54
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.730
Like I said before, input fields are
definitely the ones that I tend to add to

55
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.849
either the base styles or the components.

56
00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:43.015
And you can have the whole stack
of everything you might possibly

57
00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:48.479
want in there, invalid, disabled,
focused, so on and so forth.

58
00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.315
We can put all of that
in there as well and

59
00:03:50.315 --> 00:03:53.499
they will only apply when those
pseudo-selectors match, right?

60
00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.379
So there's no harm, no foul in doing that.

61
00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.119
And again,
either it can go into your base styles,

62
00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:01.285
it can go into those component cells, or

63
00:04:01.285 --> 00:04:05.509
if you have a component library that can
just manually put these classes on it.

64
00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:09.679
I tend to prefer that cuz then when
I'm opening up my button.jsx or

65
00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:14.973
button.svelte or whatever, or input, I see
them all in that same kind of context.

66
00:04:14.973 --> 00:04:18.806
Rather than jumping back to,
what did I call .input again or .btn or

67
00:04:18.806 --> 00:04:19.676
what have you?

68
00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:21.036
I don't want to do that.

69
00:04:21.036 --> 00:04:24.810
And so I've got some of that
kind of stuff in place.

70
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.737
We've got all of that here as well.

71
00:04:27.737 --> 00:04:31.703
And there's the things that I would do in
just regular HTML that I wouldn't have

72
00:04:31.703 --> 00:04:33.314
to do if I was doing it in Svelte.

73
00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:37.332
And so
you choose your own mileage on that one.

74
00:04:37.332 --> 00:04:40.952
Cool, and so we can bring that down for
this other input field as well.

75
00:04:43.497 --> 00:04:47.107
Awesome, and
then we just have the buttons, right?

76
00:04:47.107 --> 00:04:52.379
And so this disabled one, I think this
screen is looking a little bit different.

77
00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:58.551
Do I have it disabled probably,
maybe it was 100, right, as well.

78
00:04:58.551 --> 00:05:01.664
And this is where I don't necessarily
agree, could I multi-cursor both of these?

79
00:05:01.664 --> 00:05:04.888
Yes, as I have in one of the tutorials,
sure,

80
00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:07.717
that seems like a stretch in my opinion.

81
00:05:07.717 --> 00:05:11.689
So I could theoretically make
that button that we saw before.

82
00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:15.224
Let's do that because I think it just
shows the point in either direction.

83
00:05:15.224 --> 00:05:18.349
So if we wanted to do what
we saw in the previous one,

84
00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:23.148
you can ignore my little experiment while
we were on break, I can even say, if I

85
00:05:23.148 --> 00:05:28.289
wanted to do the base button in this case,
I could say something along the lines of.

86
00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.834
Components if I'm gonna
make a class I'm gonna use,

87
00:05:30.834 --> 00:05:34.355
base if I actually wanna take one of
the base styles like an h1 or a button.

88
00:05:34.355 --> 00:05:38.779
I showed you component before, so
I'll show you the base in this case.

89
00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:44.204
We can say button and we could say,

90
00:05:44.204 --> 00:05:49.824
@apply border-2 rounded-md.

91
00:05:49.824 --> 00:05:52.558
Border, we're gonna say
is the current color,

92
00:05:52.558 --> 00:05:54.569
that way I still have that in place.

93
00:05:54.569 --> 00:06:00.169
Cool, that's coming together, and there
is no current color set at this point.

94
00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.680
And I could even say that by default,

95
00:06:05.022 --> 00:06:13.563
That the text should be purple as well.

96
00:06:13.563 --> 00:06:16.306
And 500 seems good,

97
00:06:16.306 --> 00:06:22.073
maybe a little darker than that,
700, fine.

98
00:06:22.073 --> 00:06:28.529
px-2, py-1, looks pretty good.

99
00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:31.686
And what's cool about this is,
because it's a base one,

100
00:06:31.686 --> 00:06:34.587
I'm pretty sure what I can
do is if I really wanted to,

101
00:06:34.587 --> 00:06:39.174
I could say something like, let's say
reset was supposed to be dangerous, right?

102
00:06:39.174 --> 00:06:41.319
I could say,

103
00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:49.489
Right, and

104
00:06:49.489 --> 00:06:53.064
because it's using that current,
it is gonna override the purple, right?

105
00:06:53.064 --> 00:06:55.609
Because this has got
higher specificity and

106
00:06:55.609 --> 00:06:59.872
it's coming later as a class applied
over the base style, but current for

107
00:06:59.872 --> 00:07:03.877
the border, we'll figure everything
else out in this case as well.

108
00:07:03.877 --> 00:07:08.111
And if I really wanted to show off,
which of course,

109
00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:13.029
I really wanna show off, right,
I could do something like.

110
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:16.869
We could say bg is current and

111
00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:22.629
I'm pretty sure, yeah, see this slash?

112
00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:25.519
This is opacity.

113
00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:29.570
So I could also then
take the current as well.

114
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.298
Why are you angry at me?

115
00:07:38.777 --> 00:07:40.421
That's interesting.

116
00:07:40.421 --> 00:07:44.919
It's definitely auto completing it,
but it doesn't, cuz it comes later.

117
00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:45.699
It's not in that layer.

118
00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:48.174
I have to use it as a component,
which is where I normally do it.

119
00:07:48.174 --> 00:07:49.524
So I'll show you.

120
00:07:49.524 --> 00:07:51.799
Let's do @layer.

121
00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:01.791
Components, and here we'll say,
it's for our .btn-primary.

122
00:08:04.823 --> 00:08:06.578
That should be maybe the one
with the background.

123
00:08:06.578 --> 00:08:11.644
And we could say @apply.

124
00:08:11.644 --> 00:08:20.885
And here we'll say, And so
now we've got the idea of a button.

125
00:08:20.885 --> 00:08:22.555
I could even say,

126
00:08:39.258 --> 00:08:42.601
Cool, so we've got all of those in place,
that's disabled.

127
00:08:42.601 --> 00:08:47.212
I could actually say that on the button
and that's just gonna happen for free.

128
00:08:47.212 --> 00:08:50.178
So we'll say disabled, and we'll say,

129
00:08:50.178 --> 00:08:53.753
what do I want to say
disabled one would look like?

130
00:08:56.594 --> 00:08:59.248
We'll just say it had the opacity of,

131
00:09:01.384 --> 00:09:05.200
Like we did before, 50 or
something along those lines.

132
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.084
Great, I can do hover states as well.

133
00:09:07.084 --> 00:09:08.699
You kind of get the point.

134
00:09:08.699 --> 00:09:11.075
But the nice part is now if I said,

135
00:09:16.849 --> 00:09:18.970
Did it say dangerous or danger before?

136
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:19.734
&gt;&gt; Dangerous.

137
00:09:19.734 --> 00:09:20.975
&gt;&gt; Dangerous.

138
00:09:26.008 --> 00:09:27.594
Sweet.

139
00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:32.374
Now I see [INAUDIBLE],
let's make that a little darker.

140
00:09:32.374 --> 00:09:40.247
Cool, and this one I can say,
.btn-primary,

141
00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:45.523
and that's going to,
[SOUND] it's very angry about this.

142
00:09:45.523 --> 00:09:48.645
I think that might have to
go all the way to a utility.

143
00:09:51.636 --> 00:09:56.670
Because with the CSS layers, they're
not defined until those later layers.

144
00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.252
It's not like CSS,
which is effectively hoisting everything.

145
00:10:00.252 --> 00:10:03.394
For something that's
auto-suggested something that

146
00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:08.079
I never thought I would do before with
the current, it's very angry with me?

147
00:10:08.079 --> 00:10:09.664
So we're gonna ignore that.

148
00:10:09.664 --> 00:10:11.295
I was like, it auto-suggested it,
it seemed great.

149
00:10:11.295 --> 00:10:14.390
I was like, let's live code,
it'll be fun together.

150
00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:17.244
Not so much.

151
00:10:17.244 --> 00:10:20.574
So we've got the dangerous one,
we can do something else.

152
00:10:20.574 --> 00:10:27.980
We can say, .btn-primary.

153
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:32.450
We're not gonna do that
fun opacity thing we saw,

154
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:37.888
cuz it's very angry about that
even though it suggested it.

155
00:10:37.888 --> 00:10:40.404
Turns out computers might be a bad thing.

156
00:10:40.404 --> 00:10:46.825
So we can say current,
we've got the, let's make it purple.

157
00:10:46.825 --> 00:10:49.259
So we've got a primary one,
we've got a dangerous one.

158
00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:53.023
If you think that is the point where
you're like, it's cool to do that,

159
00:10:53.023 --> 00:10:54.142
I would say go for it.

160
00:10:54.142 --> 00:10:58.145
But then it's about do you need it too,
right, which is worth thinking about.

161
00:10:58.145 --> 00:11:01.019
And they all just become
styles you can apply.

162
00:11:01.019 --> 00:11:05.229
I'm now newly curious about that auto
suggestion of a class I never thought to

163
