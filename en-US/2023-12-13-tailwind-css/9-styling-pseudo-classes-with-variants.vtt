00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.155
So with pseudo-classes instead of needing,
if you remember in,

2
00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:08.652
if you're doing it in like Sass or
whatever, it's like ampersand, colon,

3
00:00:08.652 --> 00:00:13.007
hover, right, as a nested CSS property,
or you can just write it by hand,

4
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:15.330
like below, so on and so forth.

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.080
But that's usually when a lot of
the stuff kind of falls apart, right?

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.650
Which is like, okay,
what about a hover state?

7
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.920
I can't just put that in a class name.

8
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.941
Or can you, right?

9
00:00:25.941 --> 00:00:27.054
So this is the button or

10
00:00:27.054 --> 00:00:30.170
a button that we might have ended
up with in a previous session.

11
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.660
It looks other than
the fact that it is blue.

12
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.031
And the one that I made was purple
looks pretty accurate to what I wrote.

13
00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:39.497
So then we're going to add
this class right here,

14
00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:43.560
which is basically the pseudo selector for
what it's like when you hover over it.

15
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.033
So now if I hover over it,
you can see that it turns out,

16
00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:52.426
it goes from blue-500 to blue-400, right?

17
00:00:52.426 --> 00:00:55.828
Then I need an active for
when I press it, cool,

18
00:00:55.828 --> 00:00:59.074
active colon, whatever you need to change.

19
00:00:59.074 --> 00:01:01.350
You can stack as many
of these as you want.

20
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.732
You can even stack the variance, right?

21
00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:08.130
So if you want, it's hard to think
about what it would be with a button.

22
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.600
If anyone's got ideas, I'll do it.

23
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.830
It's a problem of imagination because,
hover and active are not at the same time.

24
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.621
But you could say like, you take an input
field, which we'll get to in a little bit,

25
00:01:20.621 --> 00:01:24.065
and it is very possible to be focused and
invalid, right, or

26
00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:25.840
something along those lines.

27
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.327
And so
you can just stack them up as you see fit.

28
00:01:30.327 --> 00:01:32.422
When we get to the responsive
design section,

29
00:01:32.422 --> 00:01:34.720
those are also just variants as well.

30
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.974
And you can actually just say, okay,

31
00:01:37.974 --> 00:01:43.850
maybe the hover effect is
different on a smaller viewport.

32
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.968
I don't know why anyone would do that,
but if you look at the tailwind docs,

33
00:01:46.968 --> 00:01:48.987
that's their example in
every single section.

34
00:01:48.987 --> 00:01:50.092
You can go when you hover over it,

35
00:01:50.092 --> 00:01:51.683
it should go from two
columns to three columns.

36
00:01:51.683 --> 00:01:55.841
I'm like,
why would I choose violence like that?

37
00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:58.051
But that's their example.

38
00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:02.950
The other thing, and then it's not
just for stuff like hover and active.

39
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.930
I guess I could stack these if I wanted
to and I think I'd do in a second.

40
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.670
Look at that, it's like I had a plan.

41
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.175
Pass me had a better imagination
than present me who's talking and

42
00:02:13.175 --> 00:02:15.600
looking us up at the same time.

43
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.980
So disabled, right, is like how
the button should be when it's disabled.

44
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.302
At this point I put an opacity of 50.

45
00:02:22.302 --> 00:02:25.500
I'll show you another trick
with opacity in a little bit.

46
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.950
So now, okay, that's what
the disabled button looks like.

47
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.440
But you notice that it still
has a hover effect, right?

48
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.530
Because effectively I chose
two different CSS properties.

49
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.414
If I changed the background, right,
then CSS class order would take effect,

50
00:02:38.414 --> 00:02:41.620
but this one's only changing the opacity.

51
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.840
It is not changing the background color,
so I'm getting both.

52
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.247
So I could theoretically stack
the two of them together and say,

53
00:02:49.247 --> 00:02:53.749
when I hover over a disabled one,
be the original color, right?

54
00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:57.020
And that will effectively
do the trick as well.

55
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.986
Either or it's mostly to demonstrate
that you can stack them more than

56
00:03:01.986 --> 00:03:03.070
anything else.

57
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.160
And so you have the ability
to kind of add some of these.

58
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.410
There's actually a lot of really,
really powerful ones.

59
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:16.110
You can kind of use to kind of create
a lot of extra UX niceness in your app.

60
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.010
So here is, this is not a complete list,
because at one point the list was getting

61
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.285
long I started cutting ones that I
didn't think were that important.

62
00:03:25.285 --> 00:03:28.806
And there are more than this because
there's also first child stuff along

63
00:03:28.806 --> 00:03:29.500
those lines.

64
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.160
These are kind of I'm just thinking about
the input like states at this point.

65
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.660
But this is the, I must add range
because I was staring at the word range.

66
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.776
This is the range of some of
these variants that just for

67
00:03:42.776 --> 00:03:45.633
the states of an input
field that you can support.

68
00:03:45.633 --> 00:03:50.202
And even the ones that truly
made it in at some point.

69
00:03:50.202 --> 00:03:53.550
There was a certain point before I called
it and decided I'd put enough on here.

70
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.780
But yeah, you've got your hover,
you've got valid and invalid, so

71
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.651
you can change the border color
on an invalid input, in range and

72
00:04:01.651 --> 00:04:03.964
out of range for the input range type.

73
00:04:03.964 --> 00:04:08.259
Whether it's focused or something
within it is focused, disabled or

74
00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:13.499
enabled which honestly I'm gonna be really
clear with you, until I was preparing for

75
00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:17.964
this I didn't even realize that
enabled was a pseudo-selector in CSS.

76
00:04:17.964 --> 00:04:20.544
So that's cool.

77
00:04:20.544 --> 00:04:22.834
Placeholder-shown, that was another one.

78
00:04:22.834 --> 00:04:25.451
Auto fill, yada, yada, yada.

79
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:28.638
And you can kind of see indeterminate is
when you can have a check box that has

80
00:04:28.638 --> 00:04:29.810
a line through it, right?

81
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:30.870
It's not checked or unchecked.

82
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.260
It's kind of that indeterminate phase,
so on and so forth.

83
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.260
So default is if you're on the default
radio button or select, right?

84
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.150
You can have that set to
a certain color as well.

85
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.970
And there are more than this.

86
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.838
And the nice part is auto complete
is your friend on this one.

87
00:04:46.838 --> 00:04:51.622
These are like at one point when I just
decided I've made my point with this list.

88
00:04:51.622 --> 00:04:53.220
And you can kind of see
a bunch of them in place.
