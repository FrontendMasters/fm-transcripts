00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.592
My name is Steve, I am the head of
front end engineering at a company

2
00:00:04.592 --> 00:00:08.202
called Temporal, and
was an early employee there.

3
00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:14.619
And so one of my first jobs was
to get a knit on the UI, right?

4
00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.366
And Mark had saying he had
been using CSS forever, right?

5
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:24.064
I had a brief dalliance with SAS for

6
00:00:24.064 --> 00:00:31.845
the better part of the late
20 aughts early 20 teens.

7
00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:37.250
Then my head mostly with a little bit of
cheating, CSS by cheating CSS I mean post

8
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.592
CSS right for occasional stuff because
I don't wanna write vendor prefixes.

9
00:00:42.592 --> 00:00:45.480
And remember all that stuff, but

10
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.135
had mostly been writing
regular CSS in a lot of cases.

11
00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:54.197
And I would hit get in it
I was like there's a lot I

12
00:00:54.197 --> 00:00:57.864
was the only engineer on the team, right?

13
00:00:57.864 --> 00:01:02.375
And I knew that trying to write all
of this CSS by hand as well as all of

14
00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:06.971
the JavaScript slash TypeScript was
a little much I was like alright

15
00:01:06.971 --> 00:01:11.967
let's go set up post CSS or maybe we'll
still Sass so it's been a while and

16
00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:16.430
then on a whim I've been hearing
a lot of this tailwind CSS stuff.

17
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.505
Let's just try it out, right?

18
00:01:18.505 --> 00:01:20.224
Yeah, I could always abandon it.

19
00:01:20.224 --> 00:01:22.265
That was two and a half years ago.

20
00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:29.224
And at this point now, we use it for
basically everything, right?

21
00:01:29.224 --> 00:01:34.267
And, I mentioned that because,
there's a wide range of use cases

22
00:01:34.267 --> 00:01:39.326
when you're building when you're
doing front end engineering.

23
00:01:39.326 --> 00:01:42.994
Chris Collier has this blog post I
really called The Great Divide, and

24
00:01:42.994 --> 00:01:47.411
the subtitle is two front-end engineers or
two front-end developers grab a beer,

25
00:01:47.411 --> 00:01:49.422
they have nothing in common, right?

26
00:01:49.422 --> 00:01:53.357
And there's a wide set of needs
from building an application to

27
00:01:53.357 --> 00:01:55.223
building a content website.

28
00:01:55.223 --> 00:02:00.153
And it's been super interesting to use
Tailwind for both and see that it's

29
00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:05.251
like incredibly flexible and makes
things that used to feel really tedious.

30
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:11.430
See also media queries is what
I mean by that, very simple and

31
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.711
elegant and to the point where it's
I might writing sales now, right?

32
00:02:18.711 --> 00:02:22.783
And so
the goal today is kind of explore that.

33
00:02:22.783 --> 00:02:26.896
Right now on this slide we've got
a website where there is basically

34
00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:31.743
everything we're gonna do today and we
might even add some stuff as we go along.

35
00:02:31.743 --> 00:02:34.367
Probably more than we could
possibly do in a given day.

36
00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:36.895
So that's kind of where I open it up for

37
00:02:36.895 --> 00:02:41.240
where your interests lie we can
kind of like off road a little bit.

38
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.129
But we've got a pretty
robust set of challenges and

39
00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.742
tutorials to work through here,
and so the basic plan here,

40
00:02:49.742 --> 00:02:53.645
is we're gonna kind of go over the basics,
right?

41
00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:58.711
Just get our sea legs get our
fundamentals out try to figure out how

42
00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:03.702
exactly Tailwind works and
then we'll kind of find a lot of the.

43
00:03:03.702 --> 00:03:06.845
Try to mix in some of the common
patterns like how to do some layout so

44
00:03:06.845 --> 00:03:08.878
you might need a lot in your applications.

45
00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:13.896
Along with a bunch of little things
that I think are just really nice and

46
00:03:13.896 --> 00:03:19.781
easy to kind of just that little extra
pizzazz on whatever site you're building.

47
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:23.473
That's just gonna make it look and
feel a little bit better as well.

48
00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:26.261
And hopefully,
even if you've used Tailwind,

49
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:30.137
there will be at least a few
things in there where you're like,

50
00:03:30.137 --> 00:03:34.088
that's interesting, that you can
kind of play around with and see.

51
00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:41.426
For the most part,
we've got everything on the site.

52
00:03:41.426 --> 00:03:44.560
Tailwind has this thing,
they have their own playground,

53
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.321
which is play.tailwind.css.

54
00:03:46.321 --> 00:03:47.369
Let's check that out real quick.

55
00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:51.952
Play Tailwind CSS, and
this is basically what it looks like.

56
00:03:51.952 --> 00:03:54.114
And so we've got this in place.

57
00:03:54.114 --> 00:03:59.488
And it's really super cool, because it
gives you a lot of the kind of basics

58
00:03:59.488 --> 00:04:05.138
in place where you've got this I-frame
situation here along with an editor.

59
00:04:05.138 --> 00:04:09.423
And what's nice about it is
all of the auto complete of

60
00:04:09.423 --> 00:04:14.484
the Tailwind class names is present
in there and ready for you.

61
00:04:14.484 --> 00:04:17.741
It will do the kind of built in sorting,
and

62
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:21.911
all of this is available as well in,
if you use VS code.

63
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:26.732
There is official VS code plugins for
Tailwind, there's a prettier plugin

64
00:04:26.732 --> 00:04:30.871
that will do a lot of the sorting
stuff that we see here as well, but

65
00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:34.670
this way we all have kind of
the same environment and setup.

66
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.369
Good to go, and it's nice because we
get that immediate feedback loop,

67
00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:41.844
of being able to see it in the browser.

68
00:04:41.844 --> 00:04:46.531
And the other really cool part is,
in terms of changing our configuration and

69
00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:51.720
stuff along those lines, we can do that in
this area as well, and then anything that,

70
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.580
if you kind of discover something really
cool and you wanna share it in the chat.

71
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.020
And we'll kind of add it to
the website as we go along or

72
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.077
if I kind of build something,
you need to see it, or want to see it.

73
00:05:02.077 --> 00:05:03.877
I can kind of share it as well and

74
00:05:03.877 --> 00:05:06.802
we can kind of do all of
those pieces super easily.

75
00:05:06.802 --> 00:05:10.299
So it's gonna be a lot of
where the magic happens today,

76
00:05:10.299 --> 00:05:14.407
along with, this site that we have here,
where you can see that.

77
00:05:14.407 --> 00:05:18.954
We've got some of those playgrounds in
there as well as a bunch of various

78
00:05:18.954 --> 00:05:23.662
different ways to visualize a lot of
the components that we're building.

79
00:05:23.662 --> 00:05:26.532
And you can kind of see what classes
I'm using at any given point.

80
00:05:26.532 --> 00:05:31.644
And I can highlight the important ones and
stuff along those lines.

81
00:05:31.644 --> 00:05:33.281
So that's kind of the high level.

82
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:37.964
And we'll do everything from kind of
some of the basic styles to all of

83
00:05:37.964 --> 00:05:42.973
the little nuances of working with
forms and inputs and the various states

84
00:05:42.973 --> 00:05:47.609
that they can be in to doing CSS
grid layouts, and fun with Flexbox.

85
00:05:47.609 --> 00:05:50.494
Cuz who doesn't like to have
fun with Flexbox, right?

86
00:05:50.494 --> 00:05:53.718
So we kind of go through all
the spaces you can kinda see.

87
00:05:53.718 --> 00:05:56.199
It escalates as we go along.

88
00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:01.479
But like I said, getting some of those
basic fundamentals in place will

89
00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:06.500
behoove us as we kind of get into
some of those more advanced pieces.
