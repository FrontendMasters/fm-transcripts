1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.933
So one of the questions that we got
kind of in the middle was we talked to

2
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:09.880
that group open or peer open and
close and what would you use that for.

3
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.000
And I realized that there were
some bonus things that we

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.700
could talk about with that as well.

5
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.828
And so this is not something
that we've prepared, but

6
00:00:19.828 --> 00:00:24.384
I think it could be interesting to kinda
show some of the other Tailwind features

7
00:00:24.384 --> 00:00:26.300
that becomes super easy as well.

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.616
So we're gonna go off script,
we're gonna go off roading for

9
00:00:30.616 --> 00:00:35.596
a little bit, and we're gonna take
that details things I use a few times

10
00:00:35.596 --> 00:00:38.348
to hide some of the solutions from you.

11
00:00:38.348 --> 00:00:42.082
We'll add one of those and

12
00:00:42.082 --> 00:00:46.326
we'll put then the summary,

13
00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:50.757
is Open for More Information.

14
00:00:53.577 --> 00:00:58.484
Right, because a lot of times,
I used to do this way back when with some

15
00:00:58.484 --> 00:01:04.158
JavaScript be is open, is closed, toggle
classes on and off, I don't have to.

16
00:01:04.158 --> 00:01:08.283
So let's style this a little bit,
we're gonna say class,

17
00:01:08.283 --> 00:01:13.084
we'll do bg, we'll give it,
I like a nice light color in this case.

18
00:01:13.084 --> 00:01:17.815
We'll give it that, and I think this
is cool cuz you get to watch my

19
00:01:17.815 --> 00:01:22.307
thought process of something
that I'm just live doing this.

20
00:01:22.307 --> 00:01:25.528
Let's see, we'll give it a px
of 4 in this case and a py of 2.

21
00:01:25.528 --> 00:01:29.520
That looks good, I like rounded corners.

22
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.574
So I'm gonna do it, and
I'm gonna give it a shadow as well.

23
00:01:36.574 --> 00:01:38.728
Dark background,
you can't really see it, but it's there.

24
00:01:38.728 --> 00:01:42.406
I know it's there,
that's the important part, and

25
00:01:42.406 --> 00:01:45.934
we'll give it a border-slate-100, right?

26
00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:52.928
Okay, got to give it
the thickness of border, too.

27
00:01:52.928 --> 00:01:55.537
Those are for tables, don't look at those.

28
00:01:55.537 --> 00:01:58.010
Those aren't for you, I will show
you those later if you want to.

29
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.700
Anything you want to see,
show me a style table, we'll do it,

30
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.590
I can get talked into anything.

31
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.165
And so we'll give that 200.

32
00:02:07.165 --> 00:02:13.610
All right, cool, and so now this can,
we gotta give it just some additional.

33
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:21.060
Actually, let me go back to this very
long thing cuz that seems great.

34
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.431
Cool, and we'll just use that.

35
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:28.375
And so now I can open and
close this thing.

36
00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:36.397
Let me give this a, Don't like that.

37
00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:41.186
Actually, I do like that, right,
because I don't like that,

38
00:02:41.186 --> 00:02:44.750
and I only want that
spacing when it was opened.

39
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.447
If only I had a way to tell if another
element was open or close of whether I

40
00:02:49.447 --> 00:02:54.089
should show that margin, I was gonna
come up with a different answer.

41
00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:59.724
This is great, cool, so let's do that.

42
00:02:59.724 --> 00:03:07.665
And then my suspicion is what I ought
to be able to do is call this a group.

43
00:03:07.665 --> 00:03:11.795
And then I should say, group-open, and

44
00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:16.161
I cannot tell you how
many times the group and

45
00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:21.007
peer ones have saved my
backend from something.

46
00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:24.980
Might have been hard, that isn't anymore.

47
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.260
Okay, so the fact I still see it
there is slightly not making me,

48
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.370
cuz I have two mb-6s that will, okay.

49
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.892
So now we only get that margin on
the bottom if it's open, right?

50
00:03:38.892 --> 00:03:42.664
That's pretty cool,
the 6 feels a little much, so

51
00:03:42.664 --> 00:03:48.509
we're gonna tone that down just a teensy
bit there, a little bit more than that.

52
00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:50.195
Cool, but I could also give it a peer.

53
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.221
Right, and then theoretically,
I should be able to say p,

54
00:03:59.221 --> 00:04:04.573
and let's say,
class invisible like we saw before.

55
00:04:04.573 --> 00:04:10.404
And we'll say peer open visible.

56
00:04:10.404 --> 00:04:15.928
And we'll say, This is a secret message,

57
00:04:15.928 --> 00:04:20.999
we'll give it, I don't know, teal.

58
00:04:23.167 --> 00:04:27.961
Right, so now we've got the peer, and so
now we can have stuff that maybe wouldn't

59
00:04:27.961 --> 00:04:32.224
have happened maybe without a little
bit of JavaScript involved before.

60
00:04:32.224 --> 00:04:36.400
We can kinda set everything up
the way it might choose to be.

61
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.409
And so I can have that margin border only
happen when it's open on the summary and

62
00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:43.495
then vanish.

63
00:04:43.495 --> 00:04:46.512
So I don't have that extra
little piece there as well, and

64
00:04:46.512 --> 00:04:48.861
I don't necessarily
have to think about it.

65
00:04:48.861 --> 00:04:50.280
That could be interesting, too.

66
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.711
What I was gonna try to do is have
the summary be a different color and

67
00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:57.970
have it have rounded
borders when it's closed.

68
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.334
But then you can theoretically say,
hey, the borders on the bottom,

69
00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:05.221
I want to make zero now, and it'll only do
two, you can do one border if you want.

70
00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:09.121
You don't have to do rounded all the way
around, you can kinda get a little bit

71
00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:12.543
more nuanced about it,
I'll just show you that while we're here.

72
00:05:12.543 --> 00:05:18.164
So I could say something like, Yeah,

73
00:05:18.164 --> 00:05:22.146
we'll say rounded,
we'll just say t in this case.

74
00:05:22.146 --> 00:05:25.783
And now, you can see that
these are now not rounded.

75
00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:28.331
And if you want to just do tr, right,

76
00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:32.133
you'll see that only the top
right corner is rounded.

77
00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:35.293
So if you're trying to do
a slightly more complicated layout,

78
00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:37.915
you don't have to think
about a lot of these things,

79
00:05:37.915 --> 00:05:41.153
you can basically just pull some
utility classes, tweak them.

80
00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:46.744
And because you have the group and
the peer, if I did want this to change on

81
00:05:46.744 --> 00:05:52.441
whether or not it was open or something
like that, I could do that as well.

82
00:05:52.441 --> 00:05:56.582
I just got to see if I can, I got to know,
we'll cut it if it doesn't work.

83
00:05:56.582 --> 00:06:01.591
So we could do something like getting the
borders exactly why not on a live coding

84
00:06:01.591 --> 00:06:06.471
extravaganza is probably, not our best,
but let's go with it for a second.

85
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:10.813
What we could do is to say then,
when it is,

86
00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:18.729
Open, we're gonna actually say,
and then when you are open,

87
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:29.446
Then we'll say rounded-md,
and then when it's open,

88
00:06:29.446 --> 00:06:34.749
we'll say rounded-none only on the b.

89
00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:39.072
So you can kinda see that we can
have it have been totally rounded.

90
00:06:39.072 --> 00:06:42.355
I gotta do a little bit of work there,
you can see between the borders and

91
00:06:42.355 --> 00:06:43.231
all the rounding,

92
00:06:43.231 --> 00:06:46.710
there's a little bit of nuance there
that we'd have to get totally right.

93
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.412
We can kinda get, like when it's closed,
we see it like that, when it's open,

94
00:06:51.412 --> 00:06:53.019
we get the secret message.

95
00:06:53.019 --> 00:06:56.892
All of these things, I don't need any
JavaScript for whatsoever, it's all CSS.

96
00:06:56.892 --> 00:06:59.572
It's all just kind of paying
attention to what else is visible and

97
00:06:59.572 --> 00:07:02.461
not visible in the DOM and
their pseudo selectors and their variants.

98
00:07:02.461 --> 00:07:08.162
And there was a whole class of problems
that I just don't have to write code for

99
00:07:08.162 --> 00:07:09.574
anymore, right?

100
00:07:09.574 --> 00:07:11.476
And now,
I guess I have that checked selector,

101
00:07:11.476 --> 00:07:14.580
you can have a hidden check box and then
the label and stuff along those lines.

102
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.170
And you can actually have all sorts
of things kind of turn on and off,

103
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.814
open and close.

104
00:07:17.814 --> 00:07:22.714
With some of these just native DOM
elements that are available these days,

105
00:07:22.714 --> 00:07:26.782
and some of these pseudo selectors,
and it's pretty great.

106
00:07:26.782 --> 00:07:30.783
Awesome, so yeah, some other things
like menu items, stuff like that,

107
00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:32.210
there's a bunch of ways.

108
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.826
There's a great way to get in any
given newsletter on Hacker News

109
00:07:34.826 --> 00:07:37.444
is to build something that you
think you need JavaScript without

110
00:07:37.444 --> 00:07:39.450
any JavaScript whatsoever,
people love that.
