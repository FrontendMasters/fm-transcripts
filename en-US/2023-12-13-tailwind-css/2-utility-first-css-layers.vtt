WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:05.135
So we've got the site that we
were talking about earlier here,

2
00:00:05.135 --> 00:00:09.951
and we'll kinda go through some
of the philosophical basis

3
00:00:09.951 --> 00:00:14.667
just to kind of like put some
thoughts in our brain to help us

4
00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:18.450
like get a sense of how
everything works here.

5
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.720
I will just mention, like I said for

6
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.591
most of what we're doing we're
gonna use the playgrounds.

7
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:28.937
I actually made these other two
experimental playgrounds here for

8
00:00:28.937 --> 00:00:34.147
you to kind of try to remember, basically
to play around with Flex boxing grid.

9
00:00:34.147 --> 00:00:37.813
And so, there are ways within
the tutorials to manipulate and

10
00:00:37.813 --> 00:00:41.548
see some of the classes, but
also there are two playgrounds for

11
00:00:41.548 --> 00:00:45.566
kind of just trying out all of these
different ideas and seeing how it

12
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:50.385
changes the layout as well, so there's
lots of ways to experiment in this site.

13
00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:53.896
And then there are some useful tools,
these are all gonna be built into

14
00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:58.181
the playgrounds that we're using together
in our time here, but I'd kinda wanted to

15
00:00:58.181 --> 00:01:01.595
call them out as something that you
might also want to take a look at.

16
00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:06.967
Which is the, if you use Visual Studio
code, there is this Tailwind IntelliSense,

17
00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:11.429
which is if you saw the number of
those various classes, first of all,

18
00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:16.371
it's actually not that many cuz there's
a very much easy heuristic to this.

19
00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:18.879
But autocomplete is nice, right?

20
00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:22.775
And auto sorting of them into to a way so
that you don't have to kill your

21
00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:26.753
co-workers because you have different
opinions is also nice as well.

22
00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:31.194
And so we use a lot of the IntelliSense
plugin, everyone's team uses as well as

23
00:01:31.194 --> 00:01:35.838
the prettier plugin at build time, because
it will just put the classes in one sane

24
00:01:35.838 --> 00:01:39.441
order and stuff along those lines
that makes life really easy.

25
00:01:39.441 --> 00:01:41.313
We're gonna get all of that for
free today.

26
00:01:41.313 --> 00:01:46.546
If you look inside this Tailwind play,
if it looks a lot like Monaco,

27
00:01:46.546 --> 00:01:51.342
which is the Visual Studio Code Editor
it's cuz it is, right?

28
00:01:51.342 --> 00:01:56.418
And so we're gonna get all of that
stuff for free, but, as you're

29
00:01:56.418 --> 00:02:02.310
hacking on your own, if you all those
things, then you are able to kinda go and

30
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.320
grab those just as easily and
have all that ready to rock and roll.

31
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.587
Great, so we talked a little
bit about what Tailwind was.

32
00:02:10.587 --> 00:02:15.502
We've talked a little bit about
kind of the various classes

33
00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:17.574
we can add to something.

34
00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:21.232
And you'll see that there's kind
of a heuristic here, right?

35
00:02:21.232 --> 00:02:24.078
That we can kinda take advantage of,
right?

36
00:02:24.078 --> 00:02:28.069
We've got this idea, they're kind of built
into a lot of times, if you look at a lot

37
00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.333
of our colors, it's like,
what do you want to change the color of?

38
00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:34.435
Like to what color and
to what shade, right?

39
00:02:34.435 --> 00:02:38.600
And there are things for like you
can take a lucky guess what PX and

40
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.786
PY are is padding on the left and right
and padding on the top and bottom, right?

41
00:02:43.786 --> 00:02:49.076
And so it's a lot of this ability font
bold, there is not deviating with a bunch

42
00:02:49.076 --> 00:02:54.528
of very specific classes versus you know
what, even if again, you're watching

43
00:02:54.528 --> 00:02:59.358
me scroll along this line you're like
that seems like a lot of classes.

44
00:02:59.358 --> 00:03:01.401
It is very clear what these classes are,

45
00:03:01.401 --> 00:03:04.537
you are also writing the CSS
somewhere to begin with, right?

46
00:03:04.537 --> 00:03:10.122
And it is a lot clearer what
the intention what I'm changing is then,

47
00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:12.253
Blog post title, right?

48
00:03:12.253 --> 00:03:14.005
And then I pull up the Chrome DevTools,
and

49
00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:16.888
I'm looking at effectively the same
thing to get to the same answers.

50
00:03:16.888 --> 00:03:21.806
For me, the ergonomics of
actually just being able to see

51
00:03:21.806 --> 00:03:26.735
it right then and
there has become incredibly powerful.

52
00:03:26.735 --> 00:03:30.934
And there's some other things
that come with Tailwind,

53
00:03:30.934 --> 00:03:36.707
if you need to be convinced on all the
other advantages of this utility per CSS,

54
00:03:36.707 --> 00:03:41.012
and long blog post like selling
the philosophical ideas.

55
00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:44.888
And if you need to be convinced, let's be
clear what I'm really talking about if

56
00:03:44.888 --> 00:03:47.114
your teammates need to be convinced,
right?

57
00:03:47.114 --> 00:03:50.774
Then you can just inundate
them with blog posts, and

58
00:03:50.774 --> 00:03:53.113
that's all here for you as well.

59
00:03:53.113 --> 00:03:57.099
There's a tweet for
that in a lot of cases.

60
00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.847
Cool, so
Tailwind comes this idea of layers.

61
00:04:01.847 --> 00:04:06.068
And what's kinda cool about this is
layers are not a Tailwind thing, right?

62
00:04:06.068 --> 00:04:09.793
Layers are kind of a modern CSS thing.

63
00:04:09.793 --> 00:04:12.313
They've got basic wide
adoption at this point.

64
00:04:12.313 --> 00:04:18.071
And layers are basically, a way to
encapsulate sets of styles, right?

65
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:22.607
So you don't necessarily have to
always fight with specificity, right?

66
00:04:22.607 --> 00:04:26.224
Within a given layer,
specificity applies and

67
00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:29.304
all the rules of specificity are there.

68
00:04:29.304 --> 00:04:32.345
But then layers work in sequential order,
right?

69
00:04:32.345 --> 00:04:37.360
So even if a subsequent layer with a lower
specificity has a style that overrides it,

70
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.954
the later one still wins, and
you're not throwing importance everywhere,

71
00:04:41.954 --> 00:04:46.854
or tryna come up with gnarly selectors
that just happen to have more specificity.

72
00:04:46.854 --> 00:04:52.869
So that first question of, if I don't
super know, CSS is that gonna hurt me?

73
00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:58.134
Well, the nice part is that between
a lot of the modern changes in CSS,

74
00:04:58.134 --> 00:05:02.417
as well as the way that Tailwind
takes advantage of them,

75
00:05:02.417 --> 00:05:06.701
some of the gnarlier parts of
CSS are taking care of you and

76
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:10.295
you don't necessarily
have to think about it.

77
00:05:10.295 --> 00:05:15.617
We're gonna look at a kinda Tailwind CSS
in a second, but I kinda wanted to start

78
00:05:15.617 --> 00:05:21.358
with it at very high level first, which is
Tailwind ships with three layers, right?

79
00:05:21.358 --> 00:05:23.772
The first one is the base layer, and

80
00:05:23.772 --> 00:05:28.778
this is Tailwind effectively ships
with a CSS reset, called preflight.

81
00:05:28.778 --> 00:05:32.722
And it is, it is an aggressive CSS reset,
I will say,

82
00:05:32.722 --> 00:05:36.669
you will need to style some
of the basic elements, and

83
00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:41.862
we'll kinda look at how to do that as
one of the first things that we do.

84
00:05:41.862 --> 00:05:46.492
Then there are components, so
that question I got earlier, which is,

85
00:05:46.492 --> 00:05:50.828
well, if I want to make some of
these higher order things, right?

86
00:05:50.828 --> 00:05:52.266
Where would I go about doing that?

87
00:05:52.266 --> 00:05:55.333
That's where you have
the components layer four.

88
00:05:55.333 --> 00:06:01.021
And again, when we get into it, there's a
certain amount of, do you really need to,

89
00:06:01.021 --> 00:06:06.156
I again, have a softer position on that
than I think, maybe the creators do.

90
00:06:06.156 --> 00:06:10.002
And then utilities are like,
one thing's like setting a margin, or

91
00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:13.404
the gap between two columns or
something along those lines.

92
00:06:13.404 --> 00:06:18.118
And those layers obviously are set up so
that obviously the little utilities those

93
00:06:18.118 --> 00:06:22.435
one-off things you need to do are in
that later layer, yeah, I said that.

94
00:06:22.435 --> 00:06:27.993
And so regardless of specificity,
they have a higher precedence

95
00:06:27.993 --> 00:06:33.559
over the base style, so
you spend less time thinking about this.

96
00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:36.607
And you can go in like these
layers are set up for you,

97
00:06:36.607 --> 00:06:38.698
you can extend any of these layers.

98
00:06:38.698 --> 00:06:41.656
But there's some probably
some new syntax here, and

99
00:06:41.656 --> 00:06:45.336
we will explore it together in
the little playground a second, but

100
00:06:45.336 --> 00:06:49.169
I kinda want to do the kind of
high-level introduction to it as well.

101
00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:53.256
Tailwind is like effectively it's
installing those three layers, and

102
00:06:53.256 --> 00:06:55.266
you can open up any of those layers.

103
00:06:55.266 --> 00:06:58.355
That @layer is not Tailwind-specific.

104
00:06:58.355 --> 00:07:01.403
Now post CSS is gonna help you,

105
00:07:01.403 --> 00:07:06.218
not worry about IE11 or
what have you, right?

106
00:07:06.218 --> 00:07:11.013
Not that I personally worry about IE11
that much anymore, but it will help you

107
00:07:11.013 --> 00:07:15.825
with the translation more So you can use
modern CSS, but layers are part of CSS.

108
00:07:15.825 --> 00:07:20.350
As I said, but this apply is super
interesting, this is actually

109
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:25.469
something provided by Tailwind,
right, by declaring this directive.

110
00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:29.523
And apply allows you to just basically
take any of these utility classes into

111
00:07:29.523 --> 00:07:31.689
that question I got the very beginning.

112
00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:36.526
Allows you to compose other
classes based on this.

113
00:07:36.526 --> 00:07:39.804
Instead of having to go in there and
then, my custom stuff,

114
00:07:39.804 --> 00:07:44.083
I've got to go back to writing regular
CSS, you're welcome to write regular CSS.

115
00:07:44.083 --> 00:07:48.249
And I'll actually show you how to
still take advantage of Tailwind and

116
00:07:48.249 --> 00:07:52.346
write regular CSS, or you can
basically create either base styles or

117
00:07:52.346 --> 00:07:55.117
component styles, or maybe utility styles.

118
00:07:55.117 --> 00:07:56.569
The utility style's
supposed to be one-off,

119
00:07:56.569 --> 00:07:58.682
you're composing them off of
other one-offs, it's kinda weird.

120
00:07:58.682 --> 00:08:01.969
But it's there for you as well,
and you can kinda use this and

121
00:08:01.969 --> 00:08:06.113
we'll kinda see that a few times cuz
at certain points I'm just gonna do it.

122
00:08:06.113 --> 00:08:09.476
And I think, like for me, I always do
with like the base styles as well.

123
00:08:09.476 --> 00:08:13.999
But we'll see ways to hook into the theme
and stuff along those lines, so

124
00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:18.822
you don't have to worry about yourself
getting out of sync with anything else

125
00:08:18.822 --> 00:08:20.472
which will be super cool.

126
00:08:20.472 --> 00:08:24.589
You can put together some of these common
components that you might use as well,

127
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:27.109
like again,
the kinda rule though is like it gets

128
00:08:27.109 --> 00:08:30.674
a little bit harder especially if
you've got these layers fine, but

129
00:08:30.674 --> 00:08:34.455
then if you're also doing a spell
component or view component, right?

130
00:08:34.455 --> 00:08:37.035
Those get a little bit
tricky to figure it out.

131
00:08:37.035 --> 00:08:41.700
It is the the way that the purge
CSS works and Tailwind,

132
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.460
is both beautiful in
how rudimentary it is.

133
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.632
You know how it works?

134
00:08:46.632 --> 00:08:50.991
Just regexes,
it is just a regex on your project.

135
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:54.843
It's just looking for all of those class
names, and if it finds it, it puts in

136
00:08:54.843 --> 00:08:59.192
the bundle, and if it doesn't find it, it
doesn't put it in the bundle, that's it.

137
00:08:59.192 --> 00:09:05.850
And so, and at one point later we'll
kinda configure it in a project as well.

138
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.738
And you can create more classes so
on and so forth.

139
00:09:08.738 --> 00:09:11.975
And so you've got a lot of flexibility,
and under the hood,

140
00:09:11.975 --> 00:09:15.593
you've got all of CSS, you have
an exit door anytime that you want,

141
00:09:15.593 --> 00:09:17.900
if you need to do something very specific.

142
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.589
But you're also gonna learn that you can
actually get to that exit door just using

143
00:09:21.589 --> 00:09:24.640
these utility classes as well, and
we'll see that as we go along.
