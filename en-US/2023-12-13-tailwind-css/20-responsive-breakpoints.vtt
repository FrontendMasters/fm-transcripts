00:00:00.163 --> 00:00:05.523
All right, let's talk about probably
my practically favorite part here,

2
00:00:05.523 --> 00:00:09.304
is the fact that I don't
have to write media queries.

3
00:00:09.304 --> 00:00:11.872
[LAUGH] Cuz there are a few things.

4
00:00:11.872 --> 00:00:15.682
I have been doing this for a very,
very, very, very long time now.

5
00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.822
And I will never remember syntax for

6
00:00:17.822 --> 00:00:20.756
putting a CSS style sheet
into an HTML document.

7
00:00:20.756 --> 00:00:24.783
I'll just note, I've been doing this
since I was 10, and I will still never.

8
00:00:24.783 --> 00:00:27.735
Gonna be 40 next year and
yet, still can't remember it.

9
00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:34.556
And a few of these other things and
media queries also fall in there as well.

10
00:00:34.556 --> 00:00:39.325
And so the way this works is all
the classes that we're using,

11
00:00:39.325 --> 00:00:43.452
that have, I had none of
these media query variants on

12
00:00:43.452 --> 00:00:47.229
it effectively take first
at our smallest size.

13
00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.914
And then after that it's kinda take
that mobile first development,

14
00:00:51.914 --> 00:00:53.861
which when I am smart, I do.

15
00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:57.205
And when I am stupid I forget to,
and then I regret it, and

16
00:00:57.205 --> 00:01:00.580
then the next time I'm smart again for
three more times.

17
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.888
And eventually I get lazy and
stupid again.

18
00:01:02.888 --> 00:01:06.143
But you start with the kind of basic
one and then you can say, coo.

19
00:01:06.143 --> 00:01:10.535
And then as soon as we go
above 640 anything with

20
00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:13.369
the small variant takes place.

21
00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.085
And then when we go above 768,

22
00:01:17.085 --> 00:01:21.480
and all of these are tweakable as well.

23
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.496
And we're gonna do some of that just to
show you cuz I keep saying, [INAUDIBLE].

24
00:01:24.496 --> 00:01:26.296
And we sort of sorted some
of them the theme, but

25
00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:27.692
we'll actually see how this works.

26
00:01:27.692 --> 00:01:34.906
Cuz we use 640, I don't know the width of
an iPhone these days or an Android phone.

27
00:01:34.906 --> 00:01:38.848
I still think it's, I mean I can literally
open the Chrome developer tools and

28
00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:41.253
find out about five seconds,
which we will do.

29
00:01:41.253 --> 00:01:45.117
But for a lot of these things I think that
we, I know that we support I think 375 is

30
00:01:45.117 --> 00:01:48.934
the smallest that we do when we're doing
our designs and stuff along the design.

31
00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:53.833
So we added in an extra small as well,
and I will do that kinda with y'all so

32
00:01:53.833 --> 00:01:56.535
you can kinda see how some of this works.

33
00:01:56.535 --> 00:02:00.924
And then that will get us ready for
some of the more fancy layout stuff

34
00:02:00.924 --> 00:02:04.785
in Tailwind, once we have that
kinda piece in there, too.

35
00:02:04.785 --> 00:02:05.320
So,.

36
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.391
let's go grab just something.

37
00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:13.875
And just to kinda
demonstrate how this works.

38
00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:18.244
I am gonna start with one
of those container divs,

39
00:02:18.244 --> 00:02:21.581
we talked about before, container.

40
00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:25.767
And that's the one that will expand
to whatever the last viewport was,

41
00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:26.617
in this case.

42
00:02:26.617 --> 00:02:28.109
So div class container.

43
00:02:30.593 --> 00:02:33.357
Nope, that's not how you type.

44
00:02:33.357 --> 00:02:35.987
Great, and I will say,

45
00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:48.308
I'm gonna do something else
with this in a second, but

46
00:02:48.308 --> 00:02:50.928
we'll give it a little
bit of extra height.

47
00:02:50.928 --> 00:02:56.403
In this case, we'll do height, 36,

48
00:02:56.403 --> 00:03:00.297
the other thing is these
are fractional heights.

49
00:03:00.297 --> 00:03:05.076
So if you wanna do something
that's a 25% is just 1/4,

50
00:03:05.076 --> 00:03:09.493
3/6 is, you can guess it,
it's the same as 1/2.

51
00:03:09.493 --> 00:03:10.272
So on and so forth.

52
00:03:10.272 --> 00:03:14.020
But you can actually do percentage
one just in the class as well.

53
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.866
You're not stuck with just
these REM units either.

54
00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:24.403
Cool, and so what we're gonna do is,
Who has a favorite color?

55
00:03:26.762 --> 00:03:27.383
&gt;&gt; Teal.

56
00:03:27.383 --> 00:03:32.178
&gt;&gt; Teal, what shade of teal would
you say is your favorite color?

57
00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:34.009
&gt;&gt; 100.

58
00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:36.227
&gt;&gt; 100, okay, great.

59
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.576
And then what's your favourite colour?

60
00:03:41.576 --> 00:03:42.182
&gt;&gt; Black.

61
00:03:42.182 --> 00:03:44.838
&gt;&gt; Black, okay.

62
00:03:44.838 --> 00:03:50.016
You're gonna get shades of black so,
&gt;&gt; Great.

63
00:03:50.016 --> 00:03:52.870
&gt;&gt; I don't know how many shades
of grey there are in this.

64
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.196
Let's see if or.

65
00:03:55.196 --> 00:03:55.732
&gt;&gt; Orange.

66
00:03:55.732 --> 00:04:01.991
&gt;&gt; Orange Favorite shade?

67
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:05.918
&gt;&gt; 500
&gt;&gt; 500, good choice.

68
00:04:05.918 --> 00:04:09.464
LG, and we got a favorite color?

69
00:04:09.464 --> 00:04:11.710
&gt;&gt; Red
&gt;&gt; Red, you can't pick one by the way,

70
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.393
if anyone has a favorite colors
on here you can't do that.

71
00:04:17.713 --> 00:04:22.759
Mine's green, I'm gonna just yell another
favorite color at this point, I'm not.

72
00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.769
Anyone watching the livestream
is done waiting for

73
00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:27.869
me to announce every single color.

74
00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:31.284
We'll start with this because I think on
this MacBook I think there's a I could go

75
00:04:31.284 --> 00:04:34.650
to 2XL, but I don't think this screen with
the way that I have to set up here will

76
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.470
ever get to those.

77
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.881
So I think we can call it at this point.

78
00:04:38.881 --> 00:04:42.148
Great, and so I can do one or
two things here.

79
00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:47.610
I can, for instance,
go into this responsive mode and

80
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.664
that's all the way down there get more.

81
00:04:54.068 --> 00:04:55.743
No, not coming up?

82
00:04:55.743 --> 00:04:57.905
Okay, fine.

83
00:04:57.905 --> 00:04:59.930
We will do it with no code then.

84
00:05:02.203 --> 00:05:04.430
There we go, there we go.

85
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.926
And as you can see, as it goes through the
breakpoints, the different variants apply.

86
00:05:10.926 --> 00:05:14.810
And you can see that this, especially
when you get an auto, will kinda stay.

87
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.999
At the last viewpoint it hit until it
literally switches to the next column,

88
00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:21.365
that's how that container works as well.

89
00:05:21.365 --> 00:05:24.906
And so you can have different layouts
very easily based on the width.

90
00:05:24.906 --> 00:05:28.686
And you can do this throughout your
application, you can say, okay,

91
00:05:28.686 --> 00:05:29.851
I wanna flex column.

92
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:31.803
If we're at the smallest viewport and

93
00:05:31.803 --> 00:05:34.250
as soon as we go to medium just md colon,
right?

94
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.039
Go to like a flex row wrap,
or what have you?

95
00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.352
You can change all this stuff very
easily and very quickly on the fly.

96
00:05:41.352 --> 00:05:43.086
You can do other silly stuff, right?

97
00:05:43.086 --> 00:05:49.615
You could do something like, we can
grab all these as well, And we'll say,

98
00:06:00.817 --> 00:06:07.766
We're gonna say something like,
After content is tiny,

99
00:06:07.766 --> 00:06:13.153
that's just the one that doesn't exist.

100
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.410
Go through as well,
just pop a bunch of these on.

101
00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:37.802
Cool, and so
we'll say this is small, Medium,

102
00:06:37.802 --> 00:06:42.933
large, extra large, cool.

103
00:06:42.933 --> 00:06:47.189
And so now we can kind of,
we see it's tiny.

104
00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:48.684
Let's go and make this bigger.

105
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:54.251
And it will also change,
this is tiny every time.

106
00:06:54.251 --> 00:06:55.291
Did I not save it?

107
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.825
Or did I mess something up, check it.

108
00:06:59.825 --> 00:07:02.943
I didn't put the after
on the rest of these.

109
00:07:02.943 --> 00:07:06.253
Right, so this is, again, you can stack
the variance do whatever you need to do.

110
00:07:12.022 --> 00:07:12.876
Cool.

111
00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:17.129
Yep, now it's changing.

112
00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:19.950
So let's say we wanted to add that 375,
right,?

113
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:26.685
As a breakpoint as well,
we can do that super easily in our theme.

114
00:07:26.685 --> 00:07:32.003
So, we can literally go in here and
we can say screens.

115
00:07:34.298 --> 00:07:41.860
And we'll say extra small is 375.

116
00:07:44.782 --> 00:07:52.840
Awesome, thats gotta, String, great.

117
00:07:52.840 --> 00:08:00.955
Now we can go back here and
also add in, Extra small and

118
00:08:00.955 --> 00:08:06.393
we're gonna go with, And

119
00:08:06.393 --> 00:08:10.047
just add in breakpoints for
whatever we need as we go through.

120
00:08:10.047 --> 00:08:13.028
[INAUDIBLE] Tiny, I want to see my
tiny mistake if not I'll look at it

121
00:08:13.028 --> 00:08:16.349
during break break, cuz it's not
the most important thing in the world.

122
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.112
Cuz I don't know anything about that, but

123
00:08:21.112 --> 00:08:24.118
if you look it did resolve correctly,
right?

124
00:08:24.118 --> 00:08:28.553
So I wonder if it's a me issue or
if it's a playground issue because

125
00:08:28.553 --> 00:08:32.210
it has definitely figured it out,
you know what it is?

126
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.481
&gt;&gt; Unit?

127
00:08:33.481 --> 00:08:37.531
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was like why does it
want a string instead of a number?

128
00:08:37.531 --> 00:08:40.874
Cuz it wants, because you look at it,

129
00:08:40.874 --> 00:08:46.268
you can see 375 pixels, 640 pixels, yeah.

130
00:08:46.268 --> 00:08:49.157
That hovering, it's good.

131
00:08:49.157 --> 00:08:50.312
So you can see, it did turn purple.

132
00:08:50.312 --> 00:08:52.974
I didn't add the other,
I'm changing it there, but

133
00:08:52.974 --> 00:08:54.582
it did turn purple in this case.

134
00:08:54.582 --> 00:08:59.618
So we can add if you wanna, we also have
a 3XL because I work with engineers.

135
00:08:59.618 --> 00:09:04.225
And they, I learned something about my co
workers, which is apparently they maximize

136
00:09:04.225 --> 00:09:08.215
their browser window on their 5k
monitors and their ultra wide monitors.

137
00:09:08.215 --> 00:09:11.446
Which is a horrifying
thing that I can't unsee.

138
00:09:11.446 --> 00:09:16.206
But I know that the biggest, and this has
multiple tech companies I've worked at

139
00:09:16.206 --> 00:09:21.398
when they talk about responsive design,
they're talking about ultra wide monitors.

140
00:09:21.398 --> 00:09:23.731
Which is never a way I've
heard of it referred to in it.

141
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:27.257
Are these people all maximizing their
browser window on these ultra wide

142
00:09:27.257 --> 00:09:28.829
monitors, is that happening?

143
00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:32.597
Cuz the amount of times it's come up
is at multiple companies is somewhat

144
00:09:32.597 --> 00:09:35.335
shocking to me
&gt;&gt; There is a change including more than

145
00:09:35.335 --> 00:09:36.685
just background color.

146
00:09:36.685 --> 00:09:38.917
Do you use the empty colon for

147
00:09:38.917 --> 00:09:44.032
all of the classes that need to be
changed or can you combine them?

148
00:09:44.032 --> 00:09:47.136
&gt;&gt; We looked this up during a break
where we found a blog post.

149
00:09:47.136 --> 00:09:49.474
Went up, I still have it open,
I don't think I do.

150
00:09:49.474 --> 00:09:52.613
Where we wanted to find out is
there a shorthand for this?

151
00:09:52.613 --> 00:09:56.344
Presently there is not,
you do stack them up.

152
00:09:56.344 --> 00:10:01.461
Now this is where you could choose to
bring those utilities or those components.

153
00:10:01.461 --> 00:10:04.813
I haven't for the most part, right?

154
00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:08.733
But you could, you could, that's where
you could pull them together in either

155
00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:12.316
a utility class or a component class,
and begin to pull those things in.

156
00:10:12.316 --> 00:10:16.533
I, again, at the end of the day,
constantly every part of me that

157
00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:21.149
is an engineer writing JavaScript
is like I should have abstractions.

158
00:10:21.149 --> 00:10:24.521
And then every part of me that has to flip
back and forth between two files to figure

159
00:10:24.521 --> 00:10:27.267
out why something's styled the way it is,
hates that part of me.

160
00:10:27.267 --> 00:10:30.942
Right, the part of me that is
good JavaScript developer,

161
00:10:30.942 --> 00:10:33.647
then makes me hate me writing CSS, right?

162
00:10:33.647 --> 00:10:36.696
And this of having it all
right there in front of me.

163
00:10:36.696 --> 00:10:40.278
And tweaking turns out, cuz every
part of me wants to abstract it away,

164
00:10:40.278 --> 00:10:42.557
everyone asking that question, I feel you.

165
00:10:42.557 --> 00:10:45.533
I am there with you all,
I am spiritually there too.

166
00:10:45.533 --> 00:10:49.468
I just know that every time I do it,
I end up sad, right?

167
00:10:49.468 --> 00:10:52.890
But I want it as well, but
then I don't like it when I have it.
