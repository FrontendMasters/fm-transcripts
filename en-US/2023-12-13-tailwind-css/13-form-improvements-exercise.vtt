1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.370
We've got this kind of a version of
what we ended up with last time.

2
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.660
Just take a few minutes and
try some of these out.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.245
Change the accent color of the check box.

4
00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:11.631
Style the placeholder and the caret.

5
00:00:11.631 --> 00:00:16.819
Try some of the things that we just kinda
toured here and take them for a spin.

6
00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:19.275
Part of this is, do it for
the muscle memory.

7
00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:20.555
So it sticks in your brain
a little bit better.

8
00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:24.140
Because otherwise,
you will forget that some of these exist.

9
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.445
And I think having that kind
of neural pathway where it

10
00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:31.690
exists is worth the five minutes
it's gonna take us to get it.

11
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.118
So I'll give you five minutes
to play around with that and

12
00:00:34.118 --> 00:00:37.475
we'll kinda style this one together and
look at some other things we could do.

13
00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:44.881
Yeah, really what we're trying to do
now is just play around with some of

14
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:47.770
the little things that we saw
in that last little tour.

15
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.401
The one that makes me the happiest, which
is how I'm gonna focus my time right now,

16
00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:58.405
is making the check box
match the rest of my theme.

17
00:00:58.405 --> 00:01:02.677
And so we can go in here and
we just say class.

18
00:01:02.677 --> 00:01:08.080
Purple seems a little subtle,
just to show that it works.

19
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.262
Let's go grab, I don't know, cyan teal.

20
00:01:12.262 --> 00:01:15.550
Let's do teal, right?

21
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.900
That's obnoxious.

22
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.950
Let's do that, right?

23
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.060
And so, yeah,
you can make it whatever color you want.

24
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.582
And, again, I think those
little things that are, like,

25
00:01:24.582 --> 00:01:29.442
it's always interesting because a lot of
these little niceties get quietly added

26
00:01:29.442 --> 00:01:32.460
to the browser, like, cross-platform.

27
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.322
And so there's always a few little new
ones that pop up every once in a while

28
00:01:36.322 --> 00:01:37.320
as well.

29
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.688
And we'll see some other really
interesting things you do when we get to

30
00:01:40.688 --> 00:01:42.790
the peer and the group stuff as well.

31
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.170
We talked a little bit about if we
take this input field over here.

32
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.240
We talked a little bit about,
let's use teal cuz it's obnoxious.

33
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.510
And some of the ones I had in the last
example were a little subtle, right?

34
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.980
And so you can kinda see our caret,
we can change that color as well.

35
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.221
We can do that for
the placeholder as well,

36
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:14.726
we'll say placeholder- teal-300.

37
00:02:14.726 --> 00:02:20.040
Now I decide to live code again.

38
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.570
See how this goes.

39
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.582
placeholder-shown, So

40
00:02:25.582 --> 00:02:30.147
you can change the background color if it,
effectively,

41
00:02:30.147 --> 00:02:34.899
placeholder-shown should be
a useful analog to empty, and

42
00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:39.186
I bring this up because there
is a pseudo-selector and

43
00:02:39.186 --> 00:02:45.650
thereby a variant called empty, but
it's not for our input fields, right?

44
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.650
I'll show you real quick.

45
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.680
We can put a div in here.

46
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.620
And we're just gonna give it some
amount of a width and a height.

47
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.460
Give it a height of, I don't know, 10.

48
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.580
Feels good.

49
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.780
A width of full.

50
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.820
So that's, again, a nice handy
way of a full width in this case.

51
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.663
And we'll give it a background color of,
why not teal, teal-300.

52
00:03:07.663 --> 00:03:08.610
Let's do it.

53
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.620
That's great.

54
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.340
And then what I could do,
I'm gonna just put something in here.

55
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.260
I'm going to say, p-Hello World.

56
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.770
That seems like a pleasant
thing to put in there.

57
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:22.920
We've got that.

58
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.986
And then I could say, Empty.

59
00:03:32.823 --> 00:03:34.975
And why am I doing 300?

60
00:03:34.975 --> 00:03:37.710
It's barely a color.

61
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.973
teal-300 is a color, red-300,
it barely even registers.

62
00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:47.166
If I take this out and then I save it,

63
00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:52.390
it means that the actual DOM
node itself is empty, right?

64
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.138
This is super useful, because how many
times have you put up, written custom,

65
00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:04.220
a conditional in your component,
cuz you're still loading the data.

66
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.340
And you're putting those
empty fields in by,

67
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.867
if array length equals equals equals zero,
then render this wholly other thing.

68
00:04:12.867 --> 00:04:16.559
Versus you could have just done
it with a little bit of CSS, and

69
00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:21.459
when we get to before and after content or
some of the animations, right, you'll

70
00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.380
see that there's some interesting ways
that we could like leverage that as well.

71
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.190
So I just wanna bring that
other one to your attention.

72
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.350
There was not really other great way
to slide it into the overall story.

73
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.862
The other one that I'd hidden here for
you that I think is pretty

74
00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:43.765
cool is this really
nondescript-looking container.

75
00:04:43.765 --> 00:04:48.690
You can kinda see a little bit what's
going on with the actual CSS that it

76
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.521
generates, which is basically that at
its smallest it'll be a width of a 100%,

77
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:57.559
and then instead of
being fluid after that,

78
00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:01.116
it basically goes to the next breakpoint,
right?

79
00:05:01.116 --> 00:05:02.913
And you can change the breakpoints
to whatever you want,

80
00:05:02.913 --> 00:05:04.454
cuz you can change anything
you want until when.

81
00:05:04.454 --> 00:05:09.342
And so instead of being,
like, okay, let's say your

82
00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:14.660
designer hypothetically hands
you a set of Figma designs,

83
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.488
hypothetically, and they send you one for

84
00:05:18.488 --> 00:05:22.980
320 pixels wide, 720 picker poisons.

85
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.190
We can even just say, in this case, 640.

86
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.910
We added one smaller than this.

87
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.450
I think we've got 375 is
our smallest viewport.

88
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.785
And they hand you designs at each and
every one of those, and

89
00:05:32.785 --> 00:05:34.580
those designs look great.

90
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.435
Sometimes at a width of 820,
part of the background image,

91
00:05:40.435 --> 00:05:43.870
or stuff doesn't look quite right.

92
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.729
This allows you to basically say, the
container will basically, each breakpoint,

93
00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.691
it goes to, whatever,
the kind of last breakpoint it was.

94
00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:57.663
So once you're above 640,
it'll be a max width of 640, right?

95
00:05:57.663 --> 00:06:01.890
Then once you pass 768, it will be
the max width, so it'll only be as large

96
00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.922
as your last breakpoint, and if they
go into any of those in between ones,

97
00:06:05.922 --> 00:06:09.395
you don't have to worry about that,
you get this one for free.

98
00:06:09.395 --> 00:06:13.930
And if you wanna just add that with an
Mx Auto, right, it'll be centered as one

99
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.468
nice column as a freebie that tailwind
has handed you to make your life easier,

100
00:06:18.468 --> 00:06:18.977
right?

101
00:06:18.977 --> 00:06:22.590
So not only is a bunch of utility
classes just for syntax but

102
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.438
there are a bunch of these niceties
in there as you saw before.

103
00:06:26.438 --> 00:06:30.888
When the slash for the opacity didn't
bite me with that one that doesn't exist,

104
00:06:30.888 --> 00:06:34.946
that's another nice shorthand that kind
of just makes it a lot easier to be

105
00:06:34.946 --> 00:06:39.397
productive, because otherwise this is
something you'd write over and over and

106
00:06:39.397 --> 00:06:40.790
over again in every app.
