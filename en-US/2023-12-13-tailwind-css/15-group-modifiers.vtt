00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.359
So let's talk about group,
which is similar to peer.

2
00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:09.926
The big difference is peer is siblings,
group is descendants, right?

3
00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:14.912
And so lets you do an entire all,
any child of that element can also

4
00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:19.001
then have a variant, and
you can do stuff like hover.

5
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:23.098
So it's like, okay,
we have a card, and I hover.

6
00:00:23.098 --> 00:00:26.599
I want a bunch of stuff to change color,
right, cool.

7
00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.342
You can do all of that and not worry about
them hovering over the correct part or

8
00:00:30.342 --> 00:00:31.849
something along those lines.

9
00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.810
And more importantly, not have to use
JavaScript event listeners that you

10
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.374
have to worry about cleaning up to like,
okay, so if it bubbles up and

11
00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:45.652
then go apply the styles back down,
you get it for free with CSS.

12
00:00:45.652 --> 00:00:49.323
So yeah, in this case, you can see,
if we look at the markup here,

13
00:00:49.323 --> 00:00:51.569
I'll just show you what happens first.

14
00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:55.396
Anywhere over this, I would get some
highlighting and some underline.

15
00:00:55.396 --> 00:00:57.999
And then this delete,
it doesn't do anything.

16
00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:02.271
But a button to show up and different
things that happen as we go through,

17
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:04.243
that will happen with the group.

18
00:01:04.243 --> 00:01:07.697
Let's look at that syntax real quick.

19
00:01:07.697 --> 00:01:09.454
I'll just open it up.

20
00:01:09.454 --> 00:01:13.733
I'm gonna hit my Open button, cool.

21
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.486
And it's the same basic idea.

22
00:01:15.486 --> 00:01:19.191
On the kind of top level one that
we care about, in this case,

23
00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:23.348
it's gonna be the li, we say group,
and then we say group-hover.

24
00:01:23.348 --> 00:01:27.328
Whatever it happens to be,
any of the variants, and

25
00:01:27.328 --> 00:01:32.219
if you ever are curious which ones
you can do, you can just type.

26
00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.985
And there's a lot of really
powerful ones in here.

27
00:01:35.985 --> 00:01:39.855
The other one that I kind
of just learned about, for

28
00:01:39.855 --> 00:01:44.270
a lot of the solutions,
I'm using the detailed summary.

29
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.841
A little open close, and
that'll actually respond to,

30
00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:54.144
it has the variant slash
the selector open.

31
00:01:54.144 --> 00:01:57.816
So you can style it differently
on whether or not it's open or

32
00:01:57.816 --> 00:02:01.996
closed on top of the actual,
no longer use state is open, is closed.

33
00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:05.654
You actually just do it with regular DOM,
and you can change the styles and

34
00:02:05.654 --> 00:02:07.019
everything based on that.

35
00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:12.472
Everything that you can do with a variant,

36
00:02:12.472 --> 00:02:18.236
you can also do with a group or
a peer, right?

37
00:02:18.236 --> 00:02:19.749
Like I said before,

38
00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:24.911
the only thing with peer is that
it's only gonna be future siblings,

39
00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:30.340
right, younger siblings effectively,
not the ones that came before.

40
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.916
But you can do lots of
interesting stuff here.

41
00:02:31.916 --> 00:02:35.116
You could theoretically
take the open close and

42
00:02:35.116 --> 00:02:38.640
hide the thing that is opening and
closing, right?

43
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.740
I've done that before when I
wanna have a hidden checkbox,

44
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.770
right, or something along
those lines that then create.

45
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.728
If I wanna have interactivity with no
JavaScript involved, there's a lot you

46
00:02:51.728 --> 00:02:55.950
can do with a lot of these tools and
just not have JavaScript at all.

47
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.386
And just do it purely with the DOM and
CSS, which is awesome.

48
00:03:00.386 --> 00:03:02.688
And this one is actually
super important as well.

49
00:03:02.688 --> 00:03:05.700
That's data attribute, right?

50
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.047
You can actually kind of say, if one
of those has a certain data attribute,

51
00:03:10.047 --> 00:03:14.472
then its children might get a certain
style or something along those lines.

52
00:03:14.472 --> 00:03:18.145
And you can also then get that data
attribute without the group or

53
00:03:18.145 --> 00:03:19.172
the peer as well.

54
00:03:19.172 --> 00:03:20.675
It's just a raw one.
So if it has this data,

55
00:03:20.675 --> 00:03:22.654
you would then do this thing as well.

56
00:03:22.654 --> 00:03:27.398
So you've got a lot of options there
too that you can kind of come up

57
00:03:27.398 --> 00:03:31.900
with interesting use cases for,
which I think is super cool.
