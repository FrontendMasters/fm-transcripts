WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:04.813
So with that,
we can kinda start to move on to the big

2
00:00:04.813 --> 00:00:08.116
dogs of layout, flexbox and grid.

3
00:00:08.116 --> 00:00:13.587
One of the tricky parts of Tailwind,
and it's only just like,

4
00:00:13.587 --> 00:00:18.952
as you get used to it again,
is first of all, let's be clear,

5
00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:24.217
most of us don't remember half
the properties on a flexbox or

6
00:00:24.217 --> 00:00:29.203
grid to begin with and
have to look it up on MDN every time.

7
00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:33.331
But then when they kind of changed
the names of them a little bit,

8
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:36.014
it adds an extra level of unfamiliarity.

9
00:00:36.014 --> 00:00:40.631
So I'm going to assume that you've
probably flexboxed a little bit before,

10
00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:43.697
a non-zero amount of flexbox or
gridding before.

11
00:00:43.697 --> 00:00:48.399
But I am going to also assume that
the way that Tailwind presents

12
00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.225
that terminology might be
a little bit new as well.

13
00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:56.614
So we're gonna re-calibrate
our brains a little bit, and

14
00:00:56.614 --> 00:01:01.459
just kind of get on board with
the way that Tailwind describes it.

15
00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:05.480
So for flexbox, you have two axes,

16
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.183
the main axis and the cross axis, right?

17
00:01:10.183 --> 00:01:15.347
Out of the box, the default lineup for
flex is flex row.

18
00:01:15.347 --> 00:01:18.896
So if you don't say anything about what
kind of flex you want, you get a flex row.

19
00:01:18.896 --> 00:01:23.545
If you say you want a flex column,
take this, rotate it, I guess rotate it,

20
00:01:23.545 --> 00:01:26.033
whichever way you want, I don't care.

21
00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:30.651
And then there's reverse to actually
flip it the other way as well.

22
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:34.954
I did that in CSS, I'm pretty proud
of myself, that's not a picture.

23
00:01:34.954 --> 00:01:41.166
And basically,
you get a few different classes.

24
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:45.730
You get justify content,
justify items, align content,

25
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.489
align items, and then you get
place content and place items.

26
00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:54.020
And I have a little sandbox play area
where we can kinda play around with this

27
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.275
a little bit as well,
and we'll explore that.

28
00:01:56.275 --> 00:02:00.717
But the important part, and
they're mostly aligned to

29
00:02:00.717 --> 00:02:05.076
the properties under the hood
in the CSS declaration.

30
00:02:05.076 --> 00:02:09.876
But you get at one point where it's
like they're just different enough

31
00:02:09.876 --> 00:02:14.836
that re-calibrating on the Tailwind
nomenclature for it to make sense.

32
00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:20.014
So justify is where do you want it
on this axis, align is where do

33
00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:25.708
you want it on this one, and
then place is effectively both, right?

34
00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:29.948
But the problem is a lot of times
I want where I have the items,

35
00:02:29.948 --> 00:02:35.290
you'll actually see this when we get
to the class names, it's a lot of fun.

36
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.290
If I want it centered, I need justify
content center and align items center.

37
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.978
I only know this cuz I do it 1,000 times.

38
00:02:44.978 --> 00:02:49.149
But let's actually go take a look at
the little playground here that we have.

39
00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:51.185
I'm gonna zoom out a little bit.

40
00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:56.820
And it's basically a way to
re-calibrate and just think about it.

41
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.011
So I have these drop downs,
they're all named by the Tailwind classes,

42
00:03:01.011 --> 00:03:03.154
not by the actual regular property.

43
00:03:03.154 --> 00:03:08.074
So mostly it's like, if you find
yourself struggling to remember what

44
00:03:08.074 --> 00:03:13.572
Tailwind calls them, then you can kind
of play around with the classes in here.

45
00:03:13.572 --> 00:03:19.027
And the flex wrap one, that's not the one
that anyone has ever forgotten, right?

46
00:03:19.027 --> 00:03:23.291
The interesting one is we've got that
justify content, that's got the same name,

47
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:24.983
it's justify start and center.

48
00:03:24.983 --> 00:03:30.103
So I put center, they move to
the center along that main axis,

49
00:03:30.103 --> 00:03:33.557
right, the horizontal one in this case.

50
00:03:33.557 --> 00:03:36.457
Where it gets a little squirrely is,
all right,

51
00:03:36.457 --> 00:03:40.725
align content doesn't have the word
align in it, it's just content.

52
00:03:40.725 --> 00:03:44.999
So you do need to know that it's
different than justify content,

53
00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:48.585
which is justify, and
align content is just content.

54
00:03:48.585 --> 00:03:54.291
And the other one is for justify items,
that's justify items start,

55
00:03:54.291 --> 00:03:58.366
end, and center, and
align items is just items.

56
00:03:58.366 --> 00:04:01.095
At one point your brain will just
click and you will remember them.

57
00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:05.847
I wish I tried to come up with a cute
heuristic that you could say in

58
00:04:05.847 --> 00:04:10.689
your brain, eventually you just
kind of get a sense of it as well.

59
00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:13.747
So we can say, for instance,
align items center,

60
00:04:13.747 --> 00:04:18.601
we'll put them across the axis in the
middle, and so it's stretching them out.

61
00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:23.243
And then we could say justify content
center or justify center, and

62
00:04:23.243 --> 00:04:26.263
we get them in the middle like this,
right?

63
00:04:26.263 --> 00:04:27.433
And these are the Tailwind classes.

64
00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:31.385
So if you are just like,
I don't remember, I'm tired of typing in

65
00:04:31.385 --> 00:04:35.200
different classes and
command tabbing back over to my browser,

66
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.365
you can kinda take a look at my little
toy that I didn't totally make for

67
00:04:39.365 --> 00:04:43.203
me six months ago or
anything along those lines, I would never.

68
00:04:43.203 --> 00:04:45.690
The other interesting one is the gap.

69
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.302
And these are the Tailwind gaps you
can kinda put in there as well.

70
00:04:48.302 --> 00:04:51.630
They're the same units that
we've seen everywhere else.

71
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.321
And so it is kind of powerful.

72
00:04:53.321 --> 00:04:56.874
The other thing you can do in this is
if you right-click on any of them,

73
00:04:56.874 --> 00:04:59.113
you can change
the individual ones as well.

74
00:04:59.113 --> 00:05:06.411
So, for instance, we can say, And
now this one will follow its own rule.

75
00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:12.740
The items basically are just applying
align self, justify self onto all of them,

76
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.693
but obviously the individual
one can override it.

77
00:05:16.693 --> 00:05:21.387
And the nice part is it's all stored
in query params, so you can save it and

78
00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:24.131
remember what it was
at some point as well.

79
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:27.757
If I was a nicer person, I would have
it generate the classes down below for

80
00:05:27.757 --> 00:05:31.165
you to copy and paste, but
I didn't think about that until just now.

81
00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:32.641
But you can kinda figure it out as well.

82
00:05:32.641 --> 00:05:36.881
So kinda thinking about that again,
we'll keep the 8 in there.

83
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:41.859
This one,
let's put itself back where it was.

84
00:05:41.859 --> 00:05:45.467
So you can go ahead and figure out the,
again, justify that main axis.

85
00:05:45.467 --> 00:05:48.668
And the content is the entire group,

86
00:05:48.668 --> 00:05:54.047
items is then applied to each
one in there for itself, right?

87
00:05:54.047 --> 00:05:58.360
So, for instance, item center is
the one that you always want when

88
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.151
your text is higher than the image,
you just want them in a straight line.

89
00:06:03.151 --> 00:06:07.691
That's where you're trying
to take all of them and

90
00:06:07.691 --> 00:06:11.184
move them down along that axis as well.

91
00:06:11.184 --> 00:06:16.329
Justify center is the one that will
kinda get it in the middle here as well.

92
00:06:16.329 --> 00:06:18.327
But depending on what you're trying to do,

93
00:06:18.327 --> 00:06:21.900
you could be trying to make a menu where
you want all the items to go on that side.

94
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.128
Whatever you're seeking to do,
there is an option in here.

95
00:06:25.128 --> 00:06:30.857
And then you can actually add
more boxes if you want to.

96
00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:34.442
And then the other one that is
a lot of times very useful is

97
00:06:34.442 --> 00:06:38.789
this idea of flex-wrap,
where you can have them wrap, once I hit,

98
00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:41.096
wherever they're supposed to go.

99
00:06:41.096 --> 00:06:47.177
And so, you got to figure out what layout
you're looking for and get a sense of it.

100
00:06:47.177 --> 00:06:51.431
If we go with flex column instead,
they will line up like this.

101
00:06:51.431 --> 00:06:56.174
We turn the wrap off and
they go out of the box cuz I

102
00:06:56.174 --> 00:07:01.281
didn't wanna deal with not
being able to see them.

103
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:02.858
Cool, and so, yeah,

104
00:07:02.858 --> 00:07:08.352
you can do all the different options that
you want here and play around with it.

105
00:07:08.352 --> 00:07:11.900
But the classes are named
a little bit differently, and

106
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.523
it does take a little bit of time to
kind of fully wrap your head around it.

107
00:07:16.523 --> 00:07:19.358
But all the rules of flexbox apply,

108
00:07:19.358 --> 00:07:24.091
particularly flexbox I think
is super easy with Tailwind.

109
00:07:24.091 --> 00:07:27.872
Again, item center and
justify center are the two that you want.

110
00:07:27.872 --> 00:07:30.308
The ones you were thinking of,
those are the ones you want.

111
00:07:30.308 --> 00:07:35.229
The other ones you will use one day,
probably.

112
00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:39.995
But those are the ones that tend to
be the ones I find myself using,

113
00:07:39.995 --> 00:07:44.240
I never want the entire flexbox
at the bottom of the thing,

114
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.638
I can't remember the last
time I wanted that.

115
00:07:47.638 --> 00:07:52.354
But if you do need it, you can figure out
what exactly you want in that case, and

116
00:07:52.354 --> 00:07:53.585
put it all in place.

117
00:07:53.585 --> 00:07:56.617
And we'll play around with some of that,
but I usually, honestly,

118
00:07:56.617 --> 00:07:59.772
started with a joke with my team of
that would none of us could remember.

119
00:07:59.772 --> 00:08:04.400
So I made it as a gift joke.

120
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.330
The other interesting thing, obviously
with flexbox is, we can tone that

121
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.886
down a little bit, is if you need to
figure out the grow shrink basis.

122
00:08:13.886 --> 00:08:20.292
There's the ability to do an order,
there's a click outside but it doesn't.

123
00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:23.726
We can say orders to, so you can put
them in different orders, so layouts.

124
00:08:23.726 --> 00:08:27.507
This is usually what we will do
in a responsive design situation,

125
00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:31.905
which is like, cool, maybe I wanted that
at the top in this one situation but

126
00:08:31.905 --> 00:08:35.412
on a different mobile screen,
it should go somewhere else,

127
00:08:35.412 --> 00:08:37.918
I don't wanna rearrange stuff in the DOM.

128
00:08:37.918 --> 00:08:40.371
You don't have to.

129
00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:45.404
As you can see,
the rest of them have the default order.

130
00:08:45.404 --> 00:08:50.696
So something with a higher order
goes to the very end, right?

131
00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:53.084
Do an order first,
it will go to be the first thing.

132
00:08:53.084 --> 00:08:55.868
So a lot of times with our
different responsive designs,

133
00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:59.294
if we do need to move stuff around
fundamentally, these exist for us.

134
00:08:59.294 --> 00:09:02.993
And the nice part is, you don't have to
hold a lot of complexity in your head

135
00:09:02.993 --> 00:09:07.072
other than remembering these class names,
because you can just do it all inline.

136
00:09:07.072 --> 00:09:12.520
You can be like, hey, at the smallest
viewport, it should be first, right?

137
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.663
But then if we get to a larger one you
can do order none, and it goes back

138
00:09:16.663 --> 00:09:21.253
to where it would have been in the DOM,
right, and stuff along those lines.

139
00:09:21.253 --> 00:09:24.178
And you can kinda get a sense and
move stuff around in that case.

140
00:09:24.178 --> 00:09:28.755
Also, how it grows if you
wanted to have the columns at

141
00:09:28.755 --> 00:09:34.161
the different viewports,
you can figure all these stuff out.

142
00:09:34.161 --> 00:09:40.874
And those responsive styles make it
super easy in this case as well.

143
00:09:40.874 --> 00:09:43.912
This is here cuz we're gonna do a few
little exercises in a little bit.

144
00:09:43.912 --> 00:09:49.417
And this is here if you are like,
I need help, this exists for you.
