1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.703
We're gonna do a little bit of like
the other kind of I think really kind of

2
00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:04.604
powerful things.

3
00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:09.174
We're gonna make a one thing that kind of
pulls a bunch of these things together and

4
00:00:09.174 --> 00:00:10.909
you can kind of see it in place.

5
00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:15.693
With that we're going to take a look
first at the animations, which again,

6
00:00:15.693 --> 00:00:19.530
super powerful, not that important,
but super powerful.

7
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.432
You can define your own animations, but
I really like the ones that Tailwind

8
00:00:24.432 --> 00:00:29.420
comes with because they have a bunch
of fairly practical use cases.

9
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.239
So one of the ones, and
again, these are, if we

10
00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.740
pull them into one of the playgrounds,
these are just regular CSS animations.

11
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.270
This one is pulse, and
it's like free skeleton loaders, right,

12
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.115
and so these are a bunch of different
just shaped, just rounded divs.

13
00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:54.857
But remember when we had that
empty pseudo selector before?

14
00:00:54.857 --> 00:00:55.764
Yes, that was cool.

15
00:00:58.052 --> 00:00:59.907
Now we have the ability
to show loading and

16
00:00:59.907 --> 00:01:03.480
we don't need to have a bunch
of conditionals in our content.

17
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.188
So we could theoretically on empty, have
certain things that we choose to show and

18
00:01:08.188 --> 00:01:09.826
layout, have this pulse and

19
00:01:09.826 --> 00:01:14.980
as soon as that DOM node is filled
with our actual content, they're gone.

20
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.524
Right there's a bunch of powerful
stuff you can do there as well or

21
00:01:18.524 --> 00:01:21.495
you can just make them
literally like hidden or block.

22
00:01:21.495 --> 00:01:25.131
Based on whether or not as empty and
they will vanish when it's time so on and

23
00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:25.659
so forth.

24
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:31.038
Okay, could I have gotten an SVG that
actually shows you a spinning loader?

25
00:01:31.038 --> 00:01:34.902
I could have as soon as I started using
emoji, I thought really hard about going

26
00:01:34.902 --> 00:01:37.729
to get the SVG and
I couldn't stop myself, so here it is.

27
00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.330
But this is actually more practical for
the spinning loader,

28
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.766
but it made me happy every time
I looked at it, so here it is.

29
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:51.066
All right, the other one you get for
free and here is pulse,

30
00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:55.882
you can use it as like one of those
little kind of notifications of,

31
00:01:55.882 --> 00:02:01.134
new feature over here or something
along those lines, and then bounce.

32
00:02:01.134 --> 00:02:04.045
And you can change any of
the speeds on these as well.

33
00:02:04.045 --> 00:02:09.725
You also get transitions and transforms
and all of these are free in Tailwind and

34
00:02:09.725 --> 00:02:13.792
you can change the timing,
everything you can do in CSS,

35
00:02:13.792 --> 00:02:17.550
you can also do in Tailwind,
it is all there for you.

36
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.089
Some of those, we use them less,
so when I had to decide on time,

37
00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:25.235
those are not the ones that I chose to
include, but they're there as well.

38
00:02:25.235 --> 00:02:30.063
The other ones that I really personally
use a lot is this one I literally stole

39
00:02:30.063 --> 00:02:32.070
from my codebase.

40
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.976
Which is we have a lot of IDs,
and people want to copy them,

41
00:02:36.976 --> 00:02:43.060
you can do this select all you
click one you get the entire thing.

42
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.326
Right and you can just,
I have lots of places where for

43
00:02:46.326 --> 00:02:49.534
any given ID anything you
want to copy super easily.

44
00:02:49.534 --> 00:02:53.967
One click you can do that on a code block
you can do it on like any kind of JSON

45
00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:59.129
thing that one click, I cannot understate
the amount of happiness that I have caused

46
00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:04.830
my co workers, just by adding a CSS class,
well, they think I'm some kind of wizard.

47
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.627
And I'm not gonna tell them, right,
but that's pretty great, and

48
00:03:09.627 --> 00:03:14.106
then you also do select none which
nobody's ever asked me to do.

49
00:03:14.106 --> 00:03:17.616
Those are the sites that you hate, when
you go to pull a block quote to send it to

50
00:03:17.616 --> 00:03:21.450
your friend and it's like they've disabled
copy and paste or something like that,

51
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.540
don't be this person.

52
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.589
Be this person,
don't be this person, okay?

53
00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:34.323
So yes, the other one that I use a lot
cuz I'm trying to be a good person,

54
00:03:34.323 --> 00:03:39.293
is there are some times where
I'll just do this one together,

55
00:03:39.293 --> 00:03:43.510
I won't make you suffer through this one.

56
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.410
There are some times where I do
not want to show the labels, but

57
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.310
you should have the labels,
because people need the labels,

58
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.050
cuz they have screen readers, right.

59
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.127
And because it makes everything
accessible and you should have them, but

60
00:03:58.127 --> 00:04:01.757
sometimes you don't want them in
your design, so what do you do?

61
00:04:01.757 --> 00:04:06.736
There's a really great,
class in here we can do, class,

62
00:04:06.736 --> 00:04:12.342
SR only and then you can see there's
the opposite of that as well.

63
00:04:12.342 --> 00:04:17.043
And we saw before there is the ones for
prefers reduced animation and

64
00:04:17.043 --> 00:04:18.866
stuff along those lines.

65
00:04:18.866 --> 00:04:23.224
And so did not actually have to do
a whole bunch of extra classes and

66
00:04:23.224 --> 00:04:27.741
everything, just be able to go like
screener only they're there if

67
00:04:27.741 --> 00:04:30.350
you're on a screen reader, right.

68
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.291
They're not there if you can see the
placeholders and stuff along those lines,

69
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:40.231
as it's doing some trickery but it is
effectively an accessible way to both have

70
00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:42.980
the labels there for
the people who need it.

71
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.061
And then also if for some reason,
the designs don't have them,

72
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:48.180
you have a way around that as well.

73
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.765
Like I said,
the reduced motion the high contrast,

74
00:04:50.765 --> 00:04:54.290
getting those all just as an inline
thing make doing the right thing a lot

75
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.855
easier which makes us more likely
that we're gonna do the right thing.
