WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.401 --> 00:00:03.848
And so we've got our colors,
you can see that I can pull those in.

2
00:00:03.848 --> 00:00:08.314
We've talked about the arbitrary colors,
we're killing it right now,

3
00:00:08.314 --> 00:00:10.630
now it's time for you to do some work.

4
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.613
We have this very basic alert here,
you can kind of click on this link and

5
00:00:16.613 --> 00:00:23.217
jump into one of the playgrounds without
having to set up or install anything.

6
00:00:23.217 --> 00:00:25.522
If you don't get the shades
of colors exact,

7
00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:28.022
I will find it in my heart to forgive you,
right?

8
00:00:28.022 --> 00:00:34.160
It's more about the kind of flow of
pixel perfect is not super important,

9
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.612
but we should go for the high level
of the general aesthetic here.

10
00:00:39.612 --> 00:00:42.319
I do mostly like to practice
some of the basic pieces.

11
00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:46.720
And again, you're like but I don't
remember what the border one was, well,

12
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.000
first of all, what's border, right?

13
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.841
And second of all, use the force,
do you know what I mean?

14
00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:57.301
You try to use the IntelliSense
in this case and

15
00:00:57.301 --> 00:01:00.597
navigate it like that and
see where you get.

16
00:01:00.597 --> 00:01:04.071
And again, stuff like we haven't
talked about Flexbox yet.

17
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:07.227
We haven't talked about grid,
I know, right?

18
00:01:07.227 --> 00:01:10.213
We can start with that, but
if you wanna just try to explore and

19
00:01:10.213 --> 00:01:12.402
get ahead of the curve, that's cool, too.

20
00:01:12.402 --> 00:01:15.054
But yeah, take it for a spin and

21
00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:19.347
see how close you can get
to this little alert box.

22
00:01:19.347 --> 00:01:21.726
And then try some other stuff that
makes you happy if you get there, but

23
00:01:21.726 --> 00:01:23.639
see how close you can get and
then we'll do it together.

24
00:01:27.224 --> 00:01:31.688
With the base styles that we get out
of the box, with that kind of CSS Risa,

25
00:01:31.688 --> 00:01:35.016
this is effectively what we
get to start with, right?

26
00:01:35.016 --> 00:01:39.935
But I think it's also powerful because
it shows you how quickly we can kind

27
00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:42.404
of begin to put something together.

28
00:01:42.404 --> 00:01:46.909
So I think it's a great place
to start in that sense.

29
00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.856
So let's go ahead and let's take it for
a spin, let's see what we got.

30
00:01:51.856 --> 00:01:56.498
Okay, so there's a few kind of pieces,
right now,

31
00:01:56.498 --> 00:02:00.202
obviously, divs take up the full width.

32
00:02:00.202 --> 00:02:05.057
We probably want this to be a little
bit smaller, so we can say class,

33
00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:09.189
and there's a bunch of ways to
kind of go about doing this.

34
00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:11.423
I would just say that the width is 96,

35
00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:14.824
I'll actually show you something
cool in a second as well.

36
00:02:14.824 --> 00:02:19.091
Also, the width is about 96,
and that puts it around there,

37
00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:21.919
mx-auto to get it in the middle, right?

38
00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:27.314
This point, I only need the x-axis margin,
right, because I only care about

39
00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:32.572
it being the middle of the two in that
case, and give it the rounded corners.

40
00:02:32.572 --> 00:02:34.802
Let's give it a background color first.

41
00:02:34.802 --> 00:02:42.346
Let's give it, let's say it's got bg,
looks like it was white, bg-white.

42
00:02:42.346 --> 00:02:47.406
You have the shades except for white and
black, which are white and black.

43
00:02:47.406 --> 00:02:51.098
If you want a off-black,
you can go change it in the theme.

44
00:02:51.098 --> 00:02:54.765
So we've got white and
black in this case, and so

45
00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:59.423
now I've got that in place,
it needs a little bit of padding.

46
00:02:59.423 --> 00:03:01.851
So you say p-4,
it's coming together, right?

47
00:03:01.851 --> 00:03:06.965
We say rounded, it's medium,
we'll give it a border of about 2,

48
00:03:06.965 --> 00:03:12.192
which if you're wondering what 2 is,
it's in this case 2 pixels.

49
00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:16.124
The nice part is you can kinda acquiesce
in again, if you need to change this,

50
00:03:16.124 --> 00:03:16.677
go ahead.

51
00:03:16.677 --> 00:03:18.583
And we want that to be purple.

52
00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:21.158
I think I said in the kinda
exercise description,

53
00:03:21.158 --> 00:03:24.605
I was only really using purple 600 and
400 for the most part.

54
00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:31.121
So I think I've got, and this one,
I don't have the electric pilot yet.

55
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:35.347
So we want, not the bg,
we want the border, but

56
00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:40.130
I do wanna point out that,
see those squiggly lines?

57
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.243
That's the IntelliSense saying you just
did two classes that do the same thing.

58
00:03:44.243 --> 00:03:49.623
So I actually say the border,
and we'll give it a shadow.

59
00:03:49.623 --> 00:03:53.833
That seems like probably most
of what we have in that case.

60
00:03:53.833 --> 00:04:00.673
All right, so then let's see,
we've got that h1 appear as well,

61
00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:06.262
and we can say, That it's got,
and we'll show some other

62
00:04:06.262 --> 00:04:09.930
ways to do spacing momentarily, but we'll
say it's got a margin along the bottom.

63
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.049
That is font is semibold, and the text,

64
00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.931
again, we'll say purple-600, right?

65
00:04:20.931 --> 00:04:22.782
I thnk that's gonna be
a little bit bigger, right?

66
00:04:22.782 --> 00:04:27.466
So we'll do text, you kinda see that I've
got a bunch of different options in here.

67
00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:31.852
You'll get the autocomplete for
the colors too, but

68
00:04:31.852 --> 00:04:35.080
we do the 2xl in that case, all right?

69
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.057
Yeah, that seems to be
about what I need there.

70
00:04:42.168 --> 00:04:45.042
Let's say text is small here.

71
00:04:45.042 --> 00:04:48.489
We don't have to get it exact, but
it's mostly about getting a feel for

72
00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:49.534
styling something.

73
00:04:49.534 --> 00:04:51.959
In Sierra, quickly,
this is coming together and

74
00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:56.131
also the workflow of not doing that thing,
where it's like, I need seven monitors.

75
00:04:56.131 --> 00:04:59.568
So I can look at my HTML, and my CSS,
and my JavaScript at the same time.

76
00:04:59.568 --> 00:05:02.667
There's no JavaScript, but
yeah, you know what I mean.

77
00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:10.127
Great, and so we've got that, again,
we can just say this is rounded.

78
00:05:10.127 --> 00:05:14.137
And we could make this the base styles for
buttons, too, right?

79
00:05:14.137 --> 00:05:16.252
We could just say all buttons
should have these things.

80
00:05:16.252 --> 00:05:22.347
I will say, though,
that every time I feel tempted to do that,

81
00:05:22.347 --> 00:05:25.117
I tend to regret it, right?

82
00:05:25.117 --> 00:05:29.859
Because then you're like, okay, we've got
a button in the photo that's maybe bigger

83
00:05:29.859 --> 00:05:33.527
and a totally different color,
now I'm overriding those styles.

84
00:05:33.527 --> 00:05:37.086
And in a lot of cases, if you've ever
played the game of where you write your

85
00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:41.003
own style sheet, where it's like, I want
input fields to have rounded corners.

86
00:05:41.003 --> 00:05:44.524
And then you forget that a check
box is technically input field and

87
00:05:44.524 --> 00:05:46.200
a range is also an input field.

88
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.142
Now, you have a weird shadow around
your range, so on and so forth, right?

89
00:05:50.142 --> 00:05:53.439
With the components you make,
using any kind of framework, sure.

90
00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:58.782
But I feel like every time that I think
that I'm supposed to go and do a bunch

91
00:05:58.782 --> 00:06:04.740
of base styles for stuff, I realize that
the Web is terrible, and I suffer for it.

92
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.672
So we've got that in place,
we've got the border-2, we can say, again,

93
00:06:07.672 --> 00:06:08.408
border-purple.

94
00:06:08.408 --> 00:06:13.354
And you can decide at one point that
we do have a class, is just a border,

95
00:06:13.354 --> 00:06:18.807
which is our default border color with
our default border thickness, right?

96
00:06:18.807 --> 00:06:21.325
At a certain point,
the patterns emerge but

97
00:06:21.325 --> 00:06:23.775
my caution to you is
not to early optimize,

98
00:06:23.775 --> 00:06:28.620
because it's usually the early optimizing
where you're like brand new code base.

99
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.764
I'm gonna do everything perfect where you
make the mistakes that you tend to regret

100
00:06:32.764 --> 00:06:36.391
because you don't actually know
the reality of the situation just yet.

101
00:06:36.391 --> 00:06:40.843
px-2, px-1,

102
00:06:40.843 --> 00:06:47.530
great, py-1, see?

103
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.217
Those sensor really helped me there, the
IntelliSense is really helping me there.

104
00:06:53.217 --> 00:06:54.340
There we go.

105
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.004
I can talk, and then bg-purple-400,

106
00:06:59.004 --> 00:07:04.178
I also get to cheat because
I do this all the time.

107
00:07:04.178 --> 00:07:10.944
So it is well deep in my psyche
at this point, rounded border-2.

108
00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:22.603
Great, and then yeah, so some of these, I
might break it out into a component class,

109
00:07:22.603 --> 00:07:26.256
I'll actually show you how
to do that in a second.

110
00:07:26.256 --> 00:07:29.269
px-1, yeah, px-2, see,
there's some advantages, right?

111
00:07:29.269 --> 00:07:34.719
px-1, I zoomed my screen in a little
bit to make my font bigger,

112
00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:38.682
but generally speaking,
I think that is very,

113
00:07:38.682 --> 00:07:42.167
very close to what we
had in there as well.

114
00:07:42.167 --> 00:07:44.248
Mark, you have a question
from the Internet.

115
00:07:44.248 --> 00:07:48.110
&gt;&gt; Is there any special
sorting in that playground?

116
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.859
&gt;&gt; Yes.

117
00:07:48.859 --> 00:07:50.090
&gt;&gt; When it comes to the classes?

118
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:57.186
&gt;&gt; Yep, it uses recommended
Tailwind sorting algorithm.

119
00:07:57.186 --> 00:08:02.438
I would love to tell you that I
could totally do it from memory,

120
00:08:02.438 --> 00:08:07.087
but if you watch,
there's an algorithm at one point.

121
00:08:07.087 --> 00:08:11.160
If I put the two patterns away from
each other, and I hit Save, or

122
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.776
that Tidy button, unless I got
a boo-boo in my mark, this cancel.

123
00:08:18.179 --> 00:08:21.507
Now, this gotta be a button,
I had a boo-boo in my markup,

124
00:08:21.507 --> 00:08:25.186
you can see that, it will then move
them all into the right place.

125
00:08:25.186 --> 00:08:28.572
So yeah, if I move that,
if I move this py somewhere else,

126
00:08:31.113 --> 00:08:36.519
It kind of goes and tries to put
them all in a sensible arrangement.

127
00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:39.610
We've got some of the basic shape,
followed by the colors,

128
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.312
followed by the spacing, yeah.

129
00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:47.055
&gt;&gt; Does Tailwind have any
sort of form of reset?

130
00:08:47.055 --> 00:08:49.987
Does it reset the styles?

131
00:08:49.987 --> 00:08:54.468
&gt;&gt; So that preflight that took
all the styles away from my

132
00:08:54.468 --> 00:08:58.261
button that we saw it
towards the beginning.

133
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:03.977
[SOUND] Out of the box,
that's what a button looks like, right?

134
00:09:03.977 --> 00:09:08.335
And so it has got a very
aggressive set of a reset.

135
00:09:08.335 --> 00:09:12.044
So in the very beginning,
you are somewhat on the hook for

136
00:09:12.044 --> 00:09:16.307
at least laying the foundation for
some of these pieces, right?

137
00:09:16.307 --> 00:09:21.460
Like I said, both from the official
documentation that I didn't take seriously

138
00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:26.082
in the very beginning, they were like,
don't overoptimize too soon,

139
00:09:26.082 --> 00:09:29.669
and I went and did it,
I have learned to agree with that.

140
00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:34.104
But if there are things like, listen,
I know the general shape of my buttons

141
00:09:34.104 --> 00:09:38.073
are always gonna be the same,
you can begin to break that stuff out.

142
00:09:38.073 --> 00:09:42.946
I would just say, when it gets to
the point that you definitely need it,

143
00:09:42.946 --> 00:09:46.601
and if you find yourself using React,
Svelte, Vue,

144
00:09:46.601 --> 00:09:50.929
what have you, you probably
have a button component, right?

145
00:09:50.929 --> 00:09:52.676
You don't need to put this in two places.

146
00:09:52.676 --> 00:09:57.939
But let's talk about where, if we did
need to say, okay, I wanna have this idea

147
00:09:57.939 --> 00:10:03.535
of maybe a primary and a secondary button,
right, that seems totally reasonable.

148
00:10:03.535 --> 00:10:07.275
We could, and maybe I don't put
the color information in there, right,

149
00:10:07.275 --> 00:10:08.130
it's up to you.

150
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:12.904
I'll show you both, but let's talk
about if I did wanna add reusable

151
00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:15.718
components on just a CSS level, right?

152
00:10:15.718 --> 00:10:19.082
And there are various reasons, if you're
just using a frontend framework of some

153
00:10:19.082 --> 00:10:21.485
choice, right,
you might just put it in your component.

154
00:10:21.485 --> 00:10:25.706
For us, there are a bunch of these that
we do pull out into styles because our

155
00:10:25.706 --> 00:10:29.271
marketing website is next and
our core application is Svelte.

156
00:10:29.271 --> 00:10:33.035
And guess what works in both places,
CSS, right?

157
00:10:33.035 --> 00:10:36.683
So I would say, it's not that you have,
I would not rush to do this,

158
00:10:36.683 --> 00:10:40.478
I would not over-optimize,
I have done this and I have paid the cost.

159
00:10:40.478 --> 00:10:43.173
But there are absolutely
practical use cases,

160
00:10:43.173 --> 00:10:46.808
where you might choose to eventually
break it out into a plugin,

161
00:10:46.808 --> 00:10:50.398
where you might choose to kind
of extend that component layer.

162
00:10:50.398 --> 00:10:55.289
And let's do that real quick, let's
talk about extending the component layer

163
00:10:55.289 --> 00:10:59.094
cuz I think it's worthwhile to
see as a thing that we could do.

164
00:10:59.094 --> 00:11:02.432
So we go into the CSS, and a lot of times,

165
00:11:02.432 --> 00:11:06.965
your CSS file might just be
these three lines, right?

166
00:11:06.965 --> 00:11:13.740
But I have two options here, I could
change the base style of what a button is,

167
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.820
I'm gonna regret that I promise you,
right?

168
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.187
Because eventually, I will then have
to override a bunch of the stuff for

169
00:11:21.187 --> 00:11:24.774
a very special and different button I'd
rather start with the tabula rasa and

170
00:11:24.774 --> 00:11:25.677
build on top of it.

171
00:11:25.677 --> 00:11:28.957
But I could go ahead and
open up that components layer,

172
00:11:28.957 --> 00:11:32.608
which are supposed to be those
kind of more reusable pieces.

173
00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:40.184
So I could say, layer components,
And I could say .button.

174
00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:46.171
And I forget what we had about the button,
no need to go look back and

175
00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:47.142
forth too much.

176
00:11:47.142 --> 00:11:48.506
We'll say it was what?

177
00:11:48.506 --> 00:11:53.827
A px-2 and a py-1, and a border-2, and

178
00:11:53.827 --> 00:12:01.540
I might choose not to put the color
information in there, right?

179
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.703
I might just choose to say,
well, that's what a button is,

180
00:12:05.703 --> 00:12:08.409
and don't worry about it, past that.

181
00:12:08.409 --> 00:12:12.255
And then let's go ahead and
put that back in my HTML here.

182
00:12:12.255 --> 00:12:15.529
So now I could theoretically,
it was rounded as well as do that.

183
00:12:18.709 --> 00:12:24.278
Rounded, and now what we'll do
is we'll just swap, put in btn,

184
00:12:24.278 --> 00:12:29.060
you can call it button if you want,
I just get confused.

185
00:12:31.481 --> 00:12:35.246
Right, btn, and
we can take out those paddings.

186
00:12:37.727 --> 00:12:42.878
And now, I've got this idea of a reusable
button, I could then theoretically make

187
00:12:42.878 --> 00:12:47.830
the idea of a primary and a secondary
button, so on and so forth, right, yeah.

188
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.905
&gt;&gt; There's a cool
community solution in chat?

189
00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:56.810
&gt;&gt; So yeah, you can see that they
did some additional things in here,

190
00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.799
where we've got the idea of a gradient.

191
00:12:59.799 --> 00:13:05.650
Who amongst you has written a gradient
in regular CSS and enjoyed it?

192
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:10.432
Of course, he writes vanilla JavaScript
and makes his own frameworks.

193
00:13:10.432 --> 00:13:15.881
But let's look at the end,
we'll do a deeper dive in this little bit.

194
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:19.039
The utility says super interesting,
at least don't worry about like,

195
00:13:19.039 --> 00:13:22.261
I don't totally grok the gradient,
we'll talk about gradients later.

196
00:13:22.261 --> 00:13:27.345
But I just wanna point out the power
of the utility classes in this case,

197
00:13:27.345 --> 00:13:33.038
which is we've got a background gradient,
to-r, which is to right, right?

198
00:13:33.038 --> 00:13:36.958
And then from-green-500, and that one,

199
00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:41.371
they don't actually have,
they don't say to what.

200
00:13:41.371 --> 00:13:47.330
But I couldn't say to, let's find
something absolutely ridiculous,

201
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:53.300
to-pink-500, and that's all it
took to make a gradient, right?

202
00:13:53.300 --> 00:14:00.142
And with the IntelliSense, think about the
compounding interest of the time you save,

203
00:14:00.142 --> 00:14:06.075
not really looking at the MBN docs on how
to do a gradient, so on ans so forth.

204
00:14:06.075 --> 00:14:11.260
Anything else that we should kinda, any
other interesting tasting notes in here?

205
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.300
Yeah, but a gradient is simply a set of
utility classes that you can kind of write

206
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.247
on the fly, compose it all together.

207
00:14:17.247 --> 00:14:22.391
And again, you could theoretically
pull this out as well

208
00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:27.437
into your theme or
something along those lines as well.

209
00:14:27.437 --> 00:14:32.183
But yeah, cool, is there anything in
the one that we're doing that we wanna

210
00:14:32.183 --> 00:14:33.751
play around with or see?

211
00:14:33.751 --> 00:14:36.494
I do wanna show you one other
thing that's kind of cool as well.

212
00:14:36.494 --> 00:14:40.696
And this is mostly just
a regular CSS kinda thing,

213
00:14:40.696 --> 00:14:45.197
which is right now my button
color is black, or yeah,

214
00:14:45.197 --> 00:14:48.014
I think it's black in this case.

215
00:14:48.014 --> 00:14:52.756
The other thing that I can
do that's super cool is,

216
00:14:52.756 --> 00:14:56.726
let's say that the text color of these is,

217
00:14:56.726 --> 00:15:01.908
text color is,
I'm writing regular CSS at this point,

218
00:15:01.908 --> 00:15:06.562
text or
writing what I'm talking about, right?

219
00:15:06.562 --> 00:15:11.105
We'll say text is, we'll say,

220
00:15:11.105 --> 00:15:14.844
purple-600, right?

221
00:15:14.844 --> 00:15:21.896
Cool, maybe it's not the best
contrast in the world,

222
00:15:21.896 --> 00:15:27.430
but we'll turn this down to maybe 300.

223
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:31.057
And what I can do then
is I can actually say

224
00:15:31.057 --> 00:15:34.703
that the border should just be current.

225
00:15:38.501 --> 00:15:39.884
You can do that here as well.

226
00:15:42.297 --> 00:15:45.752
And the cool part about this is I can
actually move this over into the button

227
00:15:45.752 --> 00:15:49.337
style, and you'll see what I get for
free out of this, which is super neat.

228
00:15:49.337 --> 00:15:55.746
Put the border-current in there with
the border-2, so we can take all that out.

229
00:15:55.746 --> 00:16:00.602
And now if I change the text
color to green, you can see that

230
00:16:00.602 --> 00:16:06.269
the border color changes as well,
right, which is super awesome.

231
00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:11.076
Because now, yeah, I have to do maybe
something with the background, but

232
00:16:11.076 --> 00:16:16.054
if you look at that secondary button,
which is not even as, we'll say cyan.

233
00:16:16.054 --> 00:16:18.877
You can see that the border and
the test hole are now synced, so

234
00:16:18.877 --> 00:16:20.893
I can start to pull out
some of those things.

235
00:16:20.893 --> 00:16:25.230
And that's why I say, use your own,
do the tedious bit first and

236
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:28.054
then figure out what you wanna optimize.

237
00:16:28.054 --> 00:16:33.036
But you can kind of begin to find out what
patterns make a ton of sense in this case,

238
00:16:33.036 --> 00:16:37.360
and allow you to kind of have a lot
of flexibility along the way as well,

239
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.047
awesome.

240
00:16:38.047 --> 00:16:42.587
&gt;&gt; So what are some gotchas that
you ran into by over-optimizing?

241
00:16:42.587 --> 00:16:45.075
&gt;&gt; Just like I have a button and
then I find out,

242
00:16:45.075 --> 00:16:48.651
do you think that design is only
gonna have that kind of button?

243
00:16:48.651 --> 00:16:51.802
And the design decides that this other
place is a very different kind of button.

244
00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:55.761
And now, you're doing things
to override those styles into

245
00:16:55.761 --> 00:16:58.876
the boilerplate in there
a little bit too soon.

246
00:16:58.876 --> 00:16:59.988
You know what I mean?

247
00:16:59.988 --> 00:17:02.548
If you know for a fact that there
is only one kind of button,

248
00:17:02.548 --> 00:17:05.490
that they're all rounded the same way,
yeah, go for it, right?

249
00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:09.086
But when the other button shows up,
[LAUGH] right,

250
00:17:09.086 --> 00:17:13.638
versus having just those classes
in there makes a ton of sense.

251
00:17:13.638 --> 00:17:15.865
And you figure out what
parts you can pull out,

252
00:17:15.865 --> 00:17:18.222
all of our border radiuses
are roughly the same.

253
00:17:18.222 --> 00:17:23.397
And it's super interesting
because of these utility classes.

254
00:17:23.397 --> 00:17:27.494
At a certain point, you have teched it and
you have designed it, right?

255
00:17:27.494 --> 00:17:30.335
Designers have new ideas,
certain things drift.

256
00:17:30.335 --> 00:17:34.539
One of the really interesting things we
were able to do a few months ago was,

257
00:17:34.539 --> 00:17:38.342
in the same way that they use
the PurgeCSS to pull out all the styles,

258
00:17:38.342 --> 00:17:40.244
I basically just wrote a parser.

259
00:17:40.244 --> 00:17:43.921
And I could say what colors and
what border widths we were using,

260
00:17:43.921 --> 00:17:44.952
where in the app.

261
00:17:44.952 --> 00:17:47.964
And like hundreds of designers and
saying like, hey,

262
00:17:47.964 --> 00:17:50.984
we're using one different
color of yellow over here.

263
00:17:50.984 --> 00:17:54.034
Cuz it was all very
clear in the markup and

264
00:17:54.034 --> 00:17:59.342
down to what component it was in,
right, and what file was all there.

265
00:17:59.342 --> 00:18:02.491
I just wrote a script and
I was able to produce a spreadsheet, and

266
00:18:02.491 --> 00:18:05.989
I were able to figure out what are the
primitives in our design system and

267
00:18:05.989 --> 00:18:07.530
what do we need to think about.
