00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.930
All right, so

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.510
we're just gonna talk a little bit
about some really nice utilities.

3
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.793
So there's a lot of proxies
to just regular stuff.

4
00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:14.134
For instance, bg-cyan-700 is not that much
harder than writing background color,

5
00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:16.930
right, and then your favorite hex code or
a CSS variable or

6
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.551
something along on those lines.

7
00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:19.994
There are some niceties in here though.

8
00:00:19.994 --> 00:00:25.446
There are some utilities that
are maybe not necessarily

9
00:00:25.446 --> 00:00:29.975
default CSS that are pretty
cool in this case.

10
00:00:29.975 --> 00:00:33.298
So here I've got a bunch of divs,

11
00:00:33.298 --> 00:00:37.938
cool, they're stacked
on top of each other.

12
00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:40.068
Normally, I would probably reach for
flex or

13
00:00:40.068 --> 00:00:42.710
something that if I wanted to
create a layout like this.

14
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.527
I don't have to,
I can literally just say space-y is 4.

15
00:00:49.527 --> 00:00:54.272
It says, basically,
that the same standardized spacing in

16
00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:58.188
between each of these,
and that's all it takes.

17
00:00:58.188 --> 00:01:02.447
We can do it with our
buttons that we saw before.

18
00:01:05.846 --> 00:01:08.601
We'll do it with this one.

19
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:16.100
And so what I can do here is I can say,
let's do space-x.

20
00:01:18.158 --> 00:01:21.685
And we'll do something egregious
just to make the point.

21
00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:23.262
That's in the button, sorry.

22
00:01:23.262 --> 00:01:25.154
We want it on the container.

23
00:01:26.824 --> 00:01:28.317
And then we've got some spacing in there.

24
00:01:28.317 --> 00:01:34.265
If I hover over it,
it's actually super cool.

25
00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:36.655
I'll show you what it is over in here,

26
00:01:36.655 --> 00:01:40.712
which effectively what it becomes
is whatever the element was.

27
00:01:44.655 --> 00:01:49.802
So let's say this is a div or whatever,
plus this, which basically means

28
00:01:49.802 --> 00:01:55.294
it's going to add a margin to everything
that's not the first child, right?

29
00:01:55.294 --> 00:01:59.211
So every every element that
came after another element, so

30
00:01:59.211 --> 00:02:02.668
also known as not the first,
right, gets spacing.

31
00:02:02.668 --> 00:02:05.273
And you can do that with x or
y or x and y.

32
00:02:05.273 --> 00:02:08.875
You just add that one class and
you're getting effectively this for

33
00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:10.781
free cuz it's a reusable utility.

34
00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:14.050
And that's kind of when we thought
about those layers of base.

35
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.558
So yeah, typography,
I usually put in the base styles.

36
00:02:17.558 --> 00:02:22.235
Some of the components will eventually,
I don't find myself expanding

37
00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:26.771
the base component layer cuz I have
a framework and I have components.

38
00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:28.779
And then utilities are like,

39
00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:33.452
stuff like that becomes what we think
about in the utilities as well.

40
00:02:33.452 --> 00:02:36.585
So we've got the ability to
space stuff out, which is great.

41
00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:40.328
So, again, I could even instead of these,

42
00:02:40.328 --> 00:02:44.688
I have these mb-4s here,
we can get rid of those.

43
00:02:44.688 --> 00:02:45.964
Those are obnoxious.

44
00:02:45.964 --> 00:02:49.414
And we can literally just say,

45
00:02:49.414 --> 00:02:53.799
space-y, and then 4 is about right.

46
00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.141
And I'll get the same effect.

47
00:02:55.141 --> 00:03:00.721
It'll add that margin bottom to all of
them, kind of in between in this case.

48
00:03:00.721 --> 00:03:04.192
And so now I don't have to put mb-4,
mb-4, mb-4, mb-4.

49
00:03:04.192 --> 00:03:07.939
So it's also one of those things,
which is, as you get more comfortable with

50
00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.661
Tailwind, you start to get
some of these little hacks.

51
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:13.695
And you don't write as
many utility classes, or

52
00:03:13.695 --> 00:03:17.400
you can begin to compose your
own as needed as we go through.
