1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.345
Alright, so,
going into our good friend, Flexbox.

2
00:00:05.345 --> 00:00:08.752
We've got just something kind of
simple we want to play with here is,

3
00:00:08.752 --> 00:00:10.004
we got a bunch of quotes.

4
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:13.522
And what we want to do is,
at the smallest viewport, we want,

5
00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:15.835
I think this column view totally works.

6
00:00:15.835 --> 00:00:17.391
I'd love to see a little
space in between these.

7
00:00:17.391 --> 00:00:19.400
These feel a little cramped.

8
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.950
And then as we kind of go to some of the
other viewports, as we go to medium and

9
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.640
large, maybe it's a row,
maybe that row wraps.

10
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.570
Kind of whatever feels right.

11
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.512
The goal here is to try out the break
points along with some of the different

12
00:00:34.512 --> 00:00:38.720
Flexbox options, and
get a feel for how they interact.

13
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.490
And we can kind of see that,
and I got a little bonus.

14
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.705
I've been trying to hide other little
utility classes throughout this, and

15
00:00:46.705 --> 00:00:49.690
I'll show you a tiny little
one that's not that important.

16
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.094
But the main goal here is to get a sense
of like, try to add some spacing

17
00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:56.758
in between them, try the different
layouts in the different viewports.

18
00:00:56.758 --> 00:00:59.865
And then we'll try it all
together in about five minutes.

19
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.630
We want to try a few things,

20
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.770
we're just kind of getting
a sense of Flexbox in this case.

21
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.596
And so one of the things we can
do in this section here is,

22
00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:18.490
it's super easy with Tailwind.

23
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.340
So we can do flex,
that will, that's weird.

24
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.770
But we could also do a flex column.

25
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.150
Right, it seems, in the very beginning,
that seems reasonable and good.

26
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.240
And then maybe at larger viewports
we'll try something else.

27
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.413
And then what we can do is,
you could use the space x,

28
00:01:39.413 --> 00:01:43.175
and that'll work great in this case,

29
00:01:43.175 --> 00:01:48.480
because again,
it just adds a margin to everything.

30
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.390
But then you've got to
switch it to a space y.

31
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.113
I think there was a period
of time where GAP was

32
00:01:58.113 --> 00:02:03.890
better supported in grid
than it was in Flex.

33
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.448
I don't know when that time was,
because by the time I read that,

34
00:02:07.448 --> 00:02:09.890
I'd been using it forever and it was fine.

35
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.130
It works all the time.

36
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.450
So we'll do that.

37
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.258
So we'll say, you know, GAP 4,
same rules as ever before,

38
00:02:16.258 --> 00:02:18.720
and we kind of get that initial sense.

39
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.960
And then we can pick a viewport
where we might choose to change it.

40
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.760
So we have the flex gap, and we could say,
let's get a little bit bigger here.

41
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.754
That seems like a time
when maybe we'd choose to,

42
00:02:31.754 --> 00:02:35.662
I don't know,
what was the width at that point?

43
00:02:35.662 --> 00:02:36.824
620.

44
00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:40.550
That's only,
I don't agree with their screen sizes.

45
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.880
That's only small in their minds.

46
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.300
And I'm not putting back
that extra small right now.

47
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.342
So we can stay at small,

48
00:02:49.342 --> 00:02:54.218
maybe we want to say flex row, right?

49
00:02:58.835 --> 00:03:00.534
We can go as small as 640.

50
00:03:00.534 --> 00:03:01.620
Wow.

51
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.880
So, all right, we go all the way there.

52
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:11.440
And now what I might choose to do,
at that small, is also say item start.

53
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.590
Right, and
they'll kind of go towards the top, right?

54
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.772
And again, we could argue if this is
exactly what we want in this case, but

55
00:03:19.772 --> 00:03:23.016
we can kind of see that we can
begin to put these together.

56
00:03:23.016 --> 00:03:26.581
We could also say, at small,

57
00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:32.149
we want to Flex wrap.

58
00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:36.723
Basically, the workflow around this makes

59
00:03:36.723 --> 00:03:41.178
working on this stuff super easy, right?

60
00:03:41.178 --> 00:03:45.978
I don't know if I love that so much there.

61
00:03:45.978 --> 00:03:49.133
But you can kinda play around with it.

62
00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:52.739
But it does make the process of doing
the different viewports, especially like,

63
00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.980
you've got the Chrome Dev Tools,
you know, they switch between them and

64
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.882
have a bunch going.

65
00:03:56.882 --> 00:04:00.294
The workflow of looking at the markup,
changing the markup,

66
00:04:00.294 --> 00:04:01.940
in the large state of things.

67
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.490
If you're jumping down to a, maybe the
child needs something in a given sense.

68
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.670
It actually is a workflow that
works out super, super well.

69
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.740
We could even, there's various
things we can do here, as well.

70
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.113
Trying to think, is there anything
we want to see in particular.

71
00:04:17.113 --> 00:04:19.485
We can change the gap
at different viewports.

72
00:04:19.485 --> 00:04:21.945
We're saying maybe like,
at small again, in so

73
00:04:21.945 --> 00:04:24.177
far that my screen is
a little bit zoomed in.

74
00:04:24.177 --> 00:04:26.824
I don't have a lot of breakpoints
at my disposal right now.

75
00:04:26.824 --> 00:04:32.340
If I'm on my 5k monitor,
I got a little more to work with.

76
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.691
But we zoom in for this,
I'm like the equivalent of a 2016, or

77
00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:39.740
earlier than that,
MacBook with the screen.

78
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.900
But we can say, okay, at a certain point
the gap is 2, when we get to small.

79
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.619
I think I can go into responsive mode and
do the fake version now, yeah!

80
00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:50.904
Right, and so
that's the wrapping happening.

81
00:04:50.904 --> 00:04:54.383
And you can gotta begin to play
around with this stuff, and

82
00:04:54.383 --> 00:04:55.952
get a sense of what works.

83
00:04:55.952 --> 00:04:59.831
And again, for the most part,
we are playing with these things.

84
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:04.246
We don't actually have a real design we're
trying to implement at this exact moment,

85
00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:05.462
which is totally fine.

86
00:05:05.462 --> 00:05:08.170
But you can begin to put these in place.

87
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.620
Again, we had the item start in that case.

88
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.060
We can swap that out.

89
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.090
We don't, we got rid of that already.

90
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.060
We can do item center.

91
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.170
And they are all gonna
kind of go to the center.

92
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.871
I could actually make this whole
viewport like the width of the screen.

93
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:32.475
And now they're aligned
across that axis there.

94
00:05:32.475 --> 00:05:34.096
We could do...

95
00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:42.160
There's also, you know, the around,
in between, and stuff along those lines.

96
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.963
These are a little bit big for that.

97
00:05:43.963 --> 00:05:47.319
But we could also say that,
for the various articles,

98
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.898
I'll say that the width is only gonna be,
I don't know.

99
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.381
Some of these are, yeah,
as I'm playing around a little bit with

100
00:06:08.381 --> 00:06:12.330
this tinier screen,
a little wonky, but it works.

101
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.200
And you can kind of play and get a sense
of this really quickly and iteratively.

102
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.426
But you have these two axes, it's just the
the class names are slightly different.

103
00:06:21.426 --> 00:06:26.635
But, you can get away with a lot with
just Flexbox in a lot of these cases.

104
00:06:26.635 --> 00:06:28.254
And have this in place.

105
00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:33.315
And, let's get rid of that,
it was a fine idea at the time.

106
00:06:33.315 --> 00:06:34.723
And it all kind of works.

107
00:06:34.723 --> 00:06:38.669
But it's really the mix with the
responsive design that I think is super

108
00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:39.670
powerful.

109
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.065
The little hidden thing is,
if you ever need a space in your thing,

110
00:06:43.065 --> 00:06:44.930
it's just an underscore.

111
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.019
And Tailwind tries to be smart enough,
if underscores are meaningful,

112
00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:51.910
then a space will do it,
so on and so forth.

113
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.400
But if you do need a space, you can
use this underscore in there as well.

114
00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:03.330
And like I said, we can justify around,
we can do, it's a little bit big for that.

115
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.157
But if we did item center,
we can do item start,

116
00:07:08.157 --> 00:07:11.790
items end, and kind of get a sense.

117
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.150
And it's just a bunch of classes.

118
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.118
We don't have to remember where
exactly this is defined, and

119
00:07:16.118 --> 00:07:18.030
what meaningful name does it have.

120
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.079
We get those classes in place,
we can begin to adjust.

121
00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:24.437
And when I am working on the marketing
site, and where it's interesting,

122
00:07:24.437 --> 00:07:28.900
the harder programming that I have to do
is on the application that I work on.

123
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.088
The harder layout I have to
do is on the marketing side.

124
00:07:32.088 --> 00:07:36.568
So, just having this ability to kind
of change these things and see it very

125
00:07:36.568 --> 00:07:41.720
instantly has been incredibly helpful for
a lot of these things, as well.

126
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.482
So yeah, pulling all that stuff in,
it does take a little bit time to get

127
00:07:45.482 --> 00:07:49.528
the like, slightly changed in the class
names, your head wrapped around.

128
00:07:49.528 --> 00:07:51.452
But I will tell you, item center and

129
00:07:51.452 --> 00:07:54.544
justify center are almost
always the ones that you want.

130
00:07:54.544 --> 00:07:57.734
And if you remember that those
are the ones that get you to the middle,

131
00:07:57.734 --> 00:08:01.211
then you know that, end to start for
the justify will get you on both sides.

132
00:08:01.211 --> 00:08:03.667
Item start and
end will get you mostly there.

133
00:08:03.667 --> 00:08:05.595
And then it's one of those things.

134
00:08:05.595 --> 00:08:06.474
You remember the two?

135
00:08:06.474 --> 00:08:08.964
And then from there you can get
to each and every additional one.

136
00:08:08.964 --> 00:08:12.774
It's like, and
then it gets me to justify around, and

137
00:08:12.774 --> 00:08:16.830
everything works along those lines,
and it's pretty great.

138
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:20.302
Cool, so, like I said, you do need
to put that flex class on that,

139
00:08:20.302 --> 00:08:21.303
as we saw earlier.

140
00:08:21.303 --> 00:08:24.829
I just left some notes in here that
you can kinda play around with.

141
00:08:24.829 --> 00:08:29.050
But for the most part, use the tool,
it will kind of make it very clear, and

142
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.510
you kind of get a sense of where
to start in this case, as well.

143
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:34.010
Awesome.

144
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:39.570
All right, let's talk about,
let's go back.

145
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:45.081
In here too, if you want,
there's other little treats for you.

146
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:48.739
So for that justify content,
you can go in here and

147
00:08:48.739 --> 00:08:54.390
just see them all individually, too,
if you're trying to get a sense.

148
00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:58.547
A lot of them are set up a little bit
easier to kind of see as an individual

149
00:08:58.547 --> 00:08:59.460
thing.

150
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.290
Justify starts, again,
justify center will get you in the middle.

151
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.140
You've got the ability to stretch.

152
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:12.920
In this part, you can do the end, center.

153
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.000
So, this is with a grid instead.

154
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.016
Do the between, you can get a sense
of what the one you're looking for

155
00:09:21.016 --> 00:09:23.828
is, rather, and pull that in.
