1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.801
All right so
time we're gonna talk about dark mode,

2
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:11.701
the nice part is this again

3
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:16.683
shockingly easy just exciting.

4
00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:20.748
And so let's go fill up,
just another thing so

5
00:00:20.748 --> 00:00:23.991
we can kind of play around with this.

6
00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:27.825
And effectively it is yet another variant.

7
00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:32.740
This one is dark, colon and
you're gonna effectively you

8
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.854
can do this on the body you can
do this wherever you want you can

9
00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:42.888
assign it basically what it
should do in dark mode, right?

10
00:00:42.888 --> 00:00:47.708
And the great part is these days is that
what is dark mana first of all that's

11
00:00:47.708 --> 00:00:52.699
not gonna help you that's gonna have
everything but your thing in this case.

12
00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.333
So we need to make our our thing
support dark mode, which is,

13
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.973
could you go into
the system preferences and

14
00:00:58.973 --> 00:01:03.781
do it but also you can go to the Chrome
developer tools, go to elements, right?

15
00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:05.426
And see this little paintbrush right here.

16
00:01:07.508 --> 00:01:12.368
Right here, click that thing,
and you can switch it back and

17
00:01:12.368 --> 00:01:14.574
forth to prefer dark mode.

18
00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:19.242
And that is all, like, you just use
the variants in this case, right?

19
00:01:19.242 --> 00:01:24.144
And then you can go ahead and
you can switch it in between dark mode and

20
00:01:24.144 --> 00:01:25.697
light mode, right?

21
00:01:25.697 --> 00:01:29.767
On your browser and like,
it's really when dark mode is enabled,

22
00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:31.448
you get dark mode, right?

23
00:01:31.448 --> 00:01:34.780
And so a lot of times that is yeah,

24
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.542
I have my satellite mode
because I'm a person.

25
00:01:39.542 --> 00:01:44.182
But I haven't said to like in the evenings
you know like I have no backlight setting

26
00:01:44.182 --> 00:01:47.559
Whereas like at nighttime is
dark mode daytime is day mode.

27
00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:52.217
And so that will automatically happen but
let's say you wanted like for

28
00:01:52.217 --> 00:01:56.652
instance, they have this toggle here,
what if I wanted to do that?

29
00:01:56.652 --> 00:02:01.703
It's totally cool,
all you really need to do is

30
00:02:01.703 --> 00:02:07.261
go ahead into the configuration and
here we can say,

31
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:13.349
and not in theme,
one up from there we'll say darkMode.

32
00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.513
And I got two options here,
one of them is media,

33
00:02:17.513 --> 00:02:22.604
which is the default mode,
the other one is class, right?

34
00:02:22.604 --> 00:02:27.906
And this would say, like if there
is a cascading class called dark,

35
00:02:27.906 --> 00:02:32.661
then these variants will clock in and
work like that as well.

36
00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:36.801
So now what we can do is,
we can basically,

37
00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:40.251
I don't have access to the body so,

38
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:46.001
we'll just wrap it in a div
because it's a little playpen.

39
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:50.670
I only get like the inside to work with so
we'll say div and

40
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.878
if I say class dark It's in dark mode,
right?

41
00:02:57.878 --> 00:03:00.498
So if you wanted to
toggle the class on and

42
00:03:00.498 --> 00:03:05.198
off with some JavaScript you can do that,
let's go back to the the actual

43
00:03:05.198 --> 00:03:09.687
the mediocre one because it's usually
the one that I prefer as well.

44
00:03:09.687 --> 00:03:15.270
And so we'll go in here and
we'll turn this back to prefers dark.

45
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.271
There's a few other things that you
might choose to change in here as well.

46
00:03:18.271 --> 00:03:22.412
And again, this is all how these selectors
and variants can like stack on top of

47
00:03:22.412 --> 00:03:25.130
each other and
give you a lot of power very quickly.

48
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.293
So what we should be able to do is,
for instance, we could say something

49
00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:36.247
along the lines of we have this other one
called selection, and we're gonna say.

50
00:03:42.328 --> 00:03:45.146
I believe that's how it works,
I'm doing that from memory so

51
00:03:45.146 --> 00:03:46.619
that I can make it pink, right?

52
00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:54.108
That's all more pink,
I wasn't nearly enough pink.

53
00:03:54.108 --> 00:03:57.182
There we go, right?

54
00:03:57.182 --> 00:04:01.103
And you could do stuff like, now,

55
00:04:01.103 --> 00:04:08.553
dark:selection:bg-cyan, we're doing cyan,
aren't we?

56
00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:15.743
We all feel in cyan,
we'll do bg-cyan, and we'll do.

57
00:04:22.453 --> 00:04:23.511
Try all that.

58
00:04:23.511 --> 00:04:25.880
And so now depending on what mode I'm in,

59
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.008
I can not only control the selection,
but I can actually have it, like,

60
00:04:30.008 --> 00:04:34.495
you can begin to stack all these things
on top of each other, so on and so forth.

61
00:04:34.495 --> 00:04:38.164
And do some interesting things.

62
00:04:38.164 --> 00:04:43.190
&gt;&gt; You create more modes or that just
essentially creating more themes.

63
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.284
&gt;&gt; I think for
the most businesses using that media that

64
00:04:48.284 --> 00:04:53.511
supports query,
there are a few other ones in there.

65
00:04:53.511 --> 00:04:57.847
If I'm not mistaken, let's go check
it out real quick, it's in like,

66
00:04:57.847 --> 00:04:59.921
this hover focus in other states.

67
00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:04.520
So there are some really interesting ones
that I think are useful as well, and

68
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.440
so for instance, we were using
preferred color scheme, right?

69
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.499
Which I do believe is just
the dark modifier, but

70
00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:18.542
on a much more serious level stuff
like prefers reduced motion, right?

71
00:05:18.542 --> 00:05:22.440
For people with accessibility issues or
high contrast right,

72
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.851
there are other modes you can pull in for
the prefers contrast like these

73
00:05:26.851 --> 00:05:30.325
are things based on how they
have those browsers set up.

74
00:05:30.325 --> 00:05:33.172
They have high contrast mode because
they have a visual impairment or

75
00:05:33.172 --> 00:05:34.458
something along those lines.

76
00:05:34.458 --> 00:05:39.610
You can easily kind of just tweak all
these things in your design system or

77
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.334
in your UI and
have all those things in place as well.

78
00:05:43.334 --> 00:05:47.461
The supports rules when I was looking for,
but the other one that I actually I just

79
00:05:47.461 --> 00:05:50.133
learned about the other day
while I was preparing for

80
00:05:50.133 --> 00:05:54.160
this is even viewport orientation
are they in portrait or landscape, right?

81
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.409
You can like lay stuff out differently
like there is a set of classes and

82
00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:00.652
tailwind for aspect ratio, right?

83
00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:04.384
So you could theoretically change
the aspect ratio based on which way

84
00:06:04.384 --> 00:06:07.415
the device is being held as well,
or change the layout.

85
00:06:07.415 --> 00:06:11.114
If you wanna have something where it's
like you ever use YouTube on a mobile

86
00:06:11.114 --> 00:06:14.519
device where it's like small, but
as soon as you turn it landscape,

87
00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:17.176
it takes up the full screen,
you can do that, right?

88
00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:18.587
In there as well.

89
00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:21.258
The supports rules is
the one I was looking for.

90
00:06:21.258 --> 00:06:23.035
This is an interesting one,

91
00:06:23.035 --> 00:06:27.859
it's like a way to basically detect what
a browser does and does not support.

92
00:06:27.859 --> 00:06:32.619
And it's generating CSS, this is also
something you can do in regular CSS.

93
00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:36.476
It's just a lot easier to say,
like, okay, In that line,

94
00:06:36.476 --> 00:06:40.718
you can basically say,
do they support CSS grid or what have you,

95
00:06:40.718 --> 00:06:43.900
this is probably the MDNR
column I'm mistaken.

96
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.371
As well as you can kind of like do that
progressive enhancement very easily like

97
00:06:48.371 --> 00:06:52.996
in that same context, and I think that's,
once again, incredibly powerful.

98
00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:57.043
So theoretically, like I'd be curious,

99
00:06:57.043 --> 00:07:01.910
here's all the things you can check for
on the supports.

100
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.970
I wonder if you could check that has and

101
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:10.560
stuff along those lines to see what
font you pick so on and so forth.

102
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.808
You can choose whether or not you
want to do the not operator, right?

103
00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:19.220
Which is like very much like has right
the ability to do like not this and

104
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:24.375
so I'm suspect you can also do has and
then you can like figure out.

105
00:07:24.375 --> 00:07:29.026
We see or all that stuff we were talking
about before where it's like not

106
00:07:29.026 --> 00:07:33.383
fully supported, you can basically
begin to put stuff together.

107
00:07:33.383 --> 00:07:40.277
And all in the same place which again,
I think is is really really powerful,

108
00:07:40.277 --> 00:07:46.431
I don't see has in there but
there might it might be in there as well.

109
00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:47.221
Cool.

110
00:07:47.221 --> 00:07:51.953
So yeah, there's a lot of ways like stack
up these various different variants.

111
00:07:51.953 --> 00:07:54.722
And I think that, we'll get into
the some of the layout stuff,

112
00:07:54.722 --> 00:07:57.555
which is I think we're tailwind
is a lot of times best known for.

113
00:07:57.555 --> 00:08:01.789
But I the reason I spent a lot of time on
this is I do think that these variants and

114
00:08:01.789 --> 00:08:03.691
we move into the responsive ones.

115
00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:08.753
Are, incredibly there have been so
many things that I thought were harder,

116
00:08:08.753 --> 00:08:12.406
that impossibly hard but
it was gonna be an afternoon.

117
00:08:12.406 --> 00:08:14.990
All right that just weren't and afternoon,

118
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.138
through these features that are basically
baked into the web platform,

119
00:08:19.138 --> 00:08:23.970
they become super easy and super easily
discoverable, using tailwind, awesome.
