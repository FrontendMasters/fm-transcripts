1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.280
So Grid works a little bit differently.

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.235
While I could make a pretty picture for
Flexbox, I stole these from Mozilla.

3
00:00:07.235 --> 00:00:12.238
And so with Grid you have
effectively the same idea.

4
00:00:12.238 --> 00:00:18.670
It's just that the axes that they
are applied to are slightly different.

5
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.590
So here you've got the,
because you don't just have one axis.

6
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.650
Like flexboxes, they're in a row or
a column, which is just a row turned.

7
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.750
With a Grid,
you have the inline row axis here.

8
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.290
And then you've got the block axis.

9
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.220
Same basic idea.

10
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.700
There's just more than
one of them in this case.

11
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.160
And so you've got same thing we saw
before, justify a line in place.

12
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.390
Place is just both at the same time.

13
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.441
If you do place content or place items,

14
00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:54.700
it is like doing both align items and
justify items.

15
00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:03.020
If you do place content, it is like doing
both justify content and align content.

16
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.170
My biggest problem is most of the time
I want align items and justify content.

17
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.779
And so I could, that's the place
where it's like, all right,

18
00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:12.980
maybe that becomes a utility method or
something along those lines.

19
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.778
I'm into it.

20
00:01:13.778 --> 00:01:14.815
I don't do that,

21
00:01:14.815 --> 00:01:18.419
I just do it by hand every time
because now it just makes sense.

22
00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:22.031
But that's a place where I
could get talked into it.

23
00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:24.450
So again, we have the same basic idea.

24
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.924
And I'm gonna give you
a challenge in a second.

25
00:01:26.924 --> 00:01:30.320
But we have the same idea of
the Grid playground over here.

26
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.510
So we'll hop on over to that.

27
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.838
And again, you can see right now there's
not this is all the defaults on the Grid,

28
00:01:36.838 --> 00:01:39.620
which is not really a lot happening here.

29
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.699
But you could get a sense of saying,
okay, I want, and

30
00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:46.377
the nice part is a lot of the syntax.

31
00:01:46.377 --> 00:01:51.532
And you will need some of the syntax
of the fractional units and

32
00:01:51.532 --> 00:01:56.703
stuff along those lines if you
wanna do really special stuff.

33
00:01:56.703 --> 00:02:01.655
The grid classes that come in tailwind
are not great for that full like, I wanna

34
00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:06.775
have an application with the sidebar and
the header and stuff along those lines.

35
00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:12.400
You will end up either using those
arbitrary values or writing some CSS.

36
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.545
But if you're like, hey, I've got a bunch
of images that I wanna lay out in a grid,

37
00:02:16.545 --> 00:02:20.038
or I have a bunch of items that I wanna
kind of put somewhere in the page,

38
00:02:20.038 --> 00:02:23.630
the grid classes that come in
tailwind are really good for that.

39
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.251
So here we can kind of take,

40
00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:28.501
we say nine columns which is
nine things a little much.

41
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:30.910
So we can say three columns, right?

42
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.830
And then we get a sense of we got
three columns and we can say that,

43
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.190
the aligned items,
we'll say they should stretch.

44
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.903
No, I think I want justify stretch.

45
00:02:42.903 --> 00:02:45.627
Nope, justify content.

46
00:02:52.202 --> 00:02:54.607
All right,
start with the gap first actually.

47
00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:00.577
This is why this exists, right?

48
00:03:00.577 --> 00:03:03.750
So we can grab that,
we say two columns, right?

49
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.175
We can say that for the items,

50
00:03:05.175 --> 00:03:07.980
that's what I wanted,
the items we want them to stretch.

51
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.240
He says, nope, the end, the start.

52
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.650
And again, I have to link
the little one-offs in here too.

53
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.757
So if you're worried about
the combination of some of these, so

54
00:03:19.757 --> 00:03:20.970
we can put them in there.

55
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.458
So we could say like, okay,
I want the items in the center and

56
00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:29.510
I actually want,
justify items also be in the center.

57
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.249
So now they'll be like in the middle
of their grid boxes in this case.

58
00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:40.394
And again that would do the same as if
I just get rid of both of those and

59
00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:42.664
I do place-items-center.

60
00:03:42.664 --> 00:03:47.845
Same effect because all place
does is it combines align and

61
00:03:47.845 --> 00:03:50.496
justify into one statement.

62
00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:55.814
And so that was what kind of put them all
in the middle in this case, like that.

63
00:03:57.823 --> 00:04:05.834
I've gotta figure out exactly what
the right mix is there for what I wanted.

64
00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:08.490
I don't actually want them to take up
the full area, but now I'm just like.

65
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.576
You also have the various, you can do
it by rows, not particularly exciting,

66
00:04:14.576 --> 00:04:18.975
and these various grid auto flows,
which, that's for the columns.

67
00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:22.340
Grid-flow-row, so on and so forth.

68
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.663
For the most part, you are probably
starting from a design and playing

69
00:04:25.663 --> 00:04:29.640
around with it, but this is a great way to
experiment and see what you want as well.

70
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.100
Again, that place-item-center,
but we only have one row.

71
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.950
We turn this into six.

72
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:35.780
Let's turn it into six.

73
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.164
I want six columns.

74
00:04:42.373 --> 00:04:45.418
Right, and you can begin to
lay out stuff differently.

75
00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:50.083
And again at every viewport you could
choose to do something differently here,

76
00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:52.950
right, and how they kind of go so
on and so forth.

77
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.239
Then we'll talk about how to do the more
advanced grid layouts in a second,

78
00:04:57.239 --> 00:04:57.862
but it is.

79
00:04:57.862 --> 00:05:01.903
I will show you and you will make the
decision if it just writing through CSS

80
00:05:01.903 --> 00:05:06.028
makes a little bit, Grid on CSS makes
a little bit more sense to that point.

81
00:05:06.028 --> 00:05:10.961
But yeah, you can kind of play around this
and get a sense of whatever you're trying

82
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:14.359
to build out and see how it
would lay out as you go through.

83
00:05:14.359 --> 00:05:15.670
I am gonna be real honest with you.

84
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.293
I tend to actually find that I can solve
a lot more of my problems with Flexbox and

85
00:05:20.293 --> 00:05:24.930
like idea of nested flexboxes than getting
too in the weeds of some of the Grid.

86
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.960
And there are advantages and
disadvantages to both, but like for

87
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.621
a lot of the layouts I have to
build on a day-to-day basis,

88
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:36.890
sort of like nested flexboxes does
an amazing job sometimes as well.

89
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.492
And I have like a little piece, that it's
kind of like recommended, not recommended,

90
00:05:41.492 --> 00:05:45.037
at your leisure kind of talking about
some of the trade offs on both of

91
00:05:45.037 --> 00:05:46.430
those as well.

92
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.004
And I think it's done in the appendix,
yeah,

93
00:05:49.004 --> 00:05:52.112
of just like the kinds of
different advantages of both.

94
00:05:52.112 --> 00:05:56.607
But the biggest thing is kind of just
understanding the justify and align, place

95
00:05:56.607 --> 00:06:01.210
and then the content and items because
they are named slightly differently.

96
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.121
And like I said before, I wish I had
a really great heuristic for you for

97
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:08.633
memorizing all of them, but
I think some of that is just time and

98
00:06:08.633 --> 00:06:10.910
play it around experimenting, right?

99
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.067
I am at a point with Flexbox where I
can probably think it with my brain and

100
00:06:15.067 --> 00:06:15.839
get it done.

101
00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:20.232
Grid I still have to like fly around a
little bit because I do a lot more Flexbox

102
00:06:20.232 --> 00:06:22.650
than I do Grid so
at this moment in my life.
