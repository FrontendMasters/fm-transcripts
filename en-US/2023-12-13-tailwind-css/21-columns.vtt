1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.350
So we know about Flexbox and Grid.

2
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.639
I would like,
just in case you were not aware,

3
00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:07.460
introduce you to my good friend columns.

4
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.120
Columns is great.

5
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.970
Columns allows you to live
the dream of the Tumblr era,

6
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.670
where masonry layouts were all the rage.

7
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.150
There's other practical ways that
you could choose to use columns.

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.650
But also, you could also choose
to make basing relayouts.

9
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.010
And so columns is a shorthand
property that we can use.

10
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.120
There's a website called PlaceKitten, by
the way, which if you need an image place.

11
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.090
There was one called Phil Murray
that had pictures of Bill Murray.

12
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.970
That's no longer working.

13
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.055
Rest in peace Phil Murray.

14
00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:49.210
Long live PlaceKitten.

15
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.410
And it's got a bunch of
settings that you can use.

16
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.570
We'll kind of look at it, we'll see
the auto complete in this case as well for

17
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.620
kind of laying out multi column data.

18
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.150
Now this is also super useful for
text, I guess, but

19
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.900
also masonry layouts of kittens is
also a thing that you can use it for.

20
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.070
But if you wanted to have two or
three columns of text,

21
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.480
you no longer need to do anything.

22
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.352
You can just use this it will flow.

23
00:01:11.352 --> 00:01:15.620
And there are ways you can choose like how
you want to break that data, so on and

24
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.730
so forth.

25
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.040
So let's open it up and take a look.

26
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.330
It is pretty straightforward.

27
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.240
But really powerful if you need it.

28
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.960
So you basically have two ways you
can go about this in Tailwind.

29
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.070
You can say how many columns you want, or
you can say how wide a column should be.

30
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.460
And then it can do math and figure out
how many columns you're going to get.

31
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.680
Different reasons for
each one, but we can try both.

32
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.654
So we can say columns three, but
if I wanted this to be columns two, boom,

33
00:01:46.654 --> 00:01:48.490
it's two columns now.

34
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.052
And why I bring this up, right after we
talk about responsive design break points,

35
00:01:53.052 --> 00:01:55.350
I think needs no explanation.

36
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.653
And so
we can theoretically say columns, too.

37
00:01:57.653 --> 00:02:01.160
But I think if you're worried about
the responsive design layout.

38
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.592
I think there's a lot of times more
apropos to think about the width of

39
00:02:04.592 --> 00:02:05.640
the columns.

40
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.263
Where you get some of the breakpoints
we saw before of the small,

41
00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:13.620
medium, large, extra large maybe.

42
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.117
You also get some new entrance.

43
00:02:17.117 --> 00:02:21.357
You get all the way up to three X,
you get three XS, two XL.

44
00:02:21.357 --> 00:02:22.565
You go all the way up.

45
00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:24.585
You can have some big columns.

46
00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:26.755
You can have some pretty large columns.

47
00:02:26.755 --> 00:02:31.679
But it adds some smaller ones in there as
well that are normal breakpoints that we

48
00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:33.915
see in some of the t shirt sizing.

49
00:02:33.915 --> 00:02:37.539
Because four of these columns is a lot of
time is useful to have something along

50
00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:38.225
those lines.

51
00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:40.800
So we can actually get rid
of this max width here.

52
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.880
But even the extra small is pretty large,
20 rems.

53
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.220
That's still 80.

54
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.900
And so, if you wanted an arbitrary value,
you can absolutely put one in.

55
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.522
So we could do something, I don't know.

56
00:02:57.358 --> 00:03:00.754
Whatever you want, right,
tiny little cat columns.

57
00:03:00.754 --> 00:03:05.677
You can also put in a gap of one and
you'll see that the kind of gap in between

58
00:03:05.677 --> 00:03:10.461
the columns gets a lot smaller this
is actually a little ridiculous on.

59
00:03:10.461 --> 00:03:12.310
That's also ridiculous.

60
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.943
But you can change the gap and
stuff along those lines and

61
00:03:14.943 --> 00:03:17.610
get a lot of control over those columns.

62
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.560
What is interesting is for pictures,
you're gonna get that layout.

63
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.130
And it will, it's,
you gotta do a little bit of work there.

64
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.158
There are some things you can do
where we saw with an aspect ratio,

65
00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:32.836
which I think I have an example,
if not, I'll whip one up.

66
00:03:32.836 --> 00:03:37.469
I did make an example where you can also
take advantage, as we saw before, of here

67
00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:42.280
I'm saying, actually, the max height
is 32, and I'm using object dot cover.

68
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.550
And you can kind of see what happens
if I get rid of one of these.

69
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.634
It's just how it's kind of, instead of
getting stretched, we're saying crop it so

70
00:03:51.634 --> 00:03:56.340
it fits which is again another just easy,
nice, useful one.

71
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.306
You can also, if I really wanted to,
I'm gonna get rid of

72
00:04:01.306 --> 00:04:06.600
the max height for a second and
we'll just grab all of these.

73
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.541
There's only three aspect ratios that
it gives you, auto, that's the default,

74
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:15.130
square, and video.

75
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.019
But you have those arbitrary values,

76
00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.860
you can extend the theme with
whatever you want, right?

77
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.767
If you really want like four by three,
or you really want 16 by nine, go for

78
00:04:24.767 --> 00:04:25.660
it, right?

79
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.390
You can do all those things,
you can add them in if you want.

80
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.851
So here I can make them all squares and
like they're not getting stretched or

81
00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:37.033
squeezed they are using object of,
object cover to like fit in there and

82
00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:40.190
there are some tweaks of like
do you want to center it?

83
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.834
Start from the top right stuff
along those lines as well.

84
00:04:43.834 --> 00:04:48.576
I could also do was a video the other one,
yeah, and

85
00:04:48.576 --> 00:04:53.222
then I'll get that kind
of more like video shape.
