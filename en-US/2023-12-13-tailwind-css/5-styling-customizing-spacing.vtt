00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.437
Let's look a little bit at some of the
other kinds of like let's build up like

2
00:00:05.437 --> 00:00:10.309
what am I look like to to kind of get
towards using a button at this point.

3
00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.647
So before this is the base button as we
just saw that we were playing around with,

4
00:00:15.647 --> 00:00:18.274
I am gonna try to walk a fine line today,

5
00:00:18.274 --> 00:00:23.320
where I do not make you slog through
every single utility class there is.

6
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.610
This is gonna be like,
we're gonna do some of the basics, and

7
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.440
then we're gonna do the greatest hits.

8
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.370
Or the ones that I found
particularly useful.

9
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.040
And some of the concepts, but like.

10
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.050
There's obviously in CSS.

11
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.730
There's some real esoteric ones too.

12
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.524
And we're gonna kind of like
leave some of those aside or

13
00:00:38.524 --> 00:00:41.000
explore them as we go through.

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.711
So in our kind of live coding
explorations before you saw me kind of

15
00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.350
add a background color.

16
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.570
Text is interesting because
it's nicely overloaded, right?

17
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.213
You'll see later that like, I can say
text white, as like white is the color.

18
00:00:54.213 --> 00:00:57.530
Primary is a color if it's
in the color's theme, right?

19
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.280
It knows that.

20
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.334
And there's also like text extra small or
small and

21
00:01:01.334 --> 00:01:04.390
it knows the difference between the two.

22
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.450
And so
you don't have to think about it as much.

23
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.052
And we saw before,
if I wanna add padding in every direction,

24
00:01:12.052 --> 00:01:14.780
that can just be like
p4 if I wanna add px.

25
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.490
And there's a few little like
escape hatches in there as well.

26
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.240
There is for instance px,
which is just one pixel, right?

27
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.130
There's a few other ones as well,
hidden in there too.

28
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.138
So I can change it just for

29
00:01:30.138 --> 00:01:33.500
those two different shapes because that
button's looking a little square for me.

30
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.347
Rounding the corners,
you just type rounded, right?

31
00:01:36.347 --> 00:01:40.449
And if you just type random I think you'd
get rounded medium you can change what

32
00:01:40.449 --> 00:01:44.430
the default rounding is, there is
everything from rounded small to rounded

33
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.847
extra large and then there's rounded full
which will do like some ridiculous number

34
00:01:48.847 --> 00:01:53.460
like 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9,
9 which is useful for getting circles.

35
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.900
Effectively, are pill shaped buttons.

36
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.110
In that case we can kind of play
around with that in a second.

37
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.700
You can add a border right,
you just say the border thickness.

38
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.062
Now, if you look very closely in
this there is a border, right but

39
00:02:05.062 --> 00:02:07.650
you can barely see this
is a light gray border.

40
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.023
So the border you both have to
define that there is a border and

41
00:02:11.023 --> 00:02:13.882
then you also say what
color the border is, right?

42
00:02:13.882 --> 00:02:18.200
But you can kind of begin to like compose
all these things as you go you wanna add

43
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.392
a shadow grayed, out a shadow right and

44
00:02:20.392 --> 00:02:23.139
you're not because I
don't know about y'all.

45
00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:28.345
Who remembers the CSS syntax for
adding a shadow the first time every time?

46
00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:29.665
Nope.

47
00:02:29.665 --> 00:02:34.135
There's a few of those that, like,
every time I gotta look it up.

48
00:02:34.135 --> 00:02:36.365
Except I don't anymore.

49
00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:41.215
And the nice part is and
this is kind of the secret hack is.

50
00:02:42.275 --> 00:02:43.466
So, for instance,
if I wanna say a button had a shadow.

51
00:02:46.586 --> 00:02:50.010
I can say, if you look, I've got
a bunch of different shadows here.

52
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.300
I can say 2xl in this case.

53
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.547
And the nice part is there's
some CSS variables in here,

54
00:02:56.547 --> 00:03:01.510
but at least part can see the CSS
is getting generated on my behalf.

55
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.962
And again, everything is customizable in
that theme for as much as you can go,

56
00:03:05.962 --> 00:03:07.370
I hate that shadow.

57
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.178
So change the shadow and it'll all kind
of just work and it will be great.

58
00:03:13.178 --> 00:03:18.878
And you know like I said before you've
got rounded you've also got like

59
00:03:18.878 --> 00:03:25.338
various different forms of rounded that
you can like look at as well so you've got

60
00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:31.150
kind of all of that in place there that
you can like build on top of, cool.

61
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.640
Awesome, so let's go back to the button.

62
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.254
So again, and the nice part is that
IntelliSense, if you have a VS Code,

63
00:03:39.254 --> 00:03:40.400
is your friend.

64
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.460
A lot of times, like occasionally,
do I need to look at the docs?

65
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.080
I do.

66
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.080
The docs are pretty great too.

67
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.619
But a lot of times, I can actually just
use my editor to figure it all out,

68
00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:52.030
and that's pretty wonderful in this case.

69
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.545
There's a little bit like we should
talk a little bit about sizing and

70
00:03:55.545 --> 00:03:57.750
spacing that we saw before.

71
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.272
Here's just kind of an example that we can
kinda take a look at and see if we can

72
00:04:02.272 --> 00:04:06.880
kind of like, gain some understanding
about what's going on here, right?

73
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.787
So here I've got a div with
a height of 72, at the MX-20,

74
00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:19.775
that becomes 18 rem because
you're multiplying as well.

75
00:04:19.775 --> 00:04:21.260
You can say it's got a width of 96, and

76
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.250
you can see what all
these measurements are.

77
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.195
Now, the really cool thing is,
there is that 1, 2,

78
00:04:28.195 --> 00:04:31.538
4, 8, so on and so forth, right?

79
00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:38.450
But let's say, Let's say you
need something to be 375 pixels.

80
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.000
What do you do?

81
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.610
&gt;&gt; Square bracket.

82
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.362
&gt;&gt; Square bracket it, right?

83
00:04:42.362 --> 00:04:46.745
You don't actually if it's a one off if
you're gonna use 375 pixels of width all

84
00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:49.320
over the place,
go put it in your theme, right?

85
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.880
Go give yourself an abstraction.

86
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.020
Let's say you need 375 pixels exactly
once and one time only, right?

87
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.988
All right, there is an escape hatch built
into tailwind here where you can say,

88
00:05:00.988 --> 00:05:05.640
let's say 375 which I think is
probably not the best number here.

89
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.419
Let's go with it, right?

90
00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.582
I can say 375 pixels in here, and

91
00:05:08.582 --> 00:05:12.320
that will then like a class
will be generated on my behalf.

92
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.482
I don't have to go extend my
theme just for a one off and

93
00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:20.420
have it littered with a lot of comments
like I had to do this because this thing.

94
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.670
In this situation,
you can just kind of do it.

95
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:30.780
That said, I will yell at you during
code review or I won't yell at you.

96
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.437
I will say really [LAUGH], or
something along those lines, but

97
00:05:34.437 --> 00:05:38.040
there's always a situation where
you might need it as well.

98
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.862
You know, I usually,
if I get a design that has that in it,

99
00:05:42.862 --> 00:05:46.750
I will round to the nearest
measurement that makes sense as well.

100
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.590
And that'll actually work for
almost anything, right?

101
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.573
So you could, for instance, say, okay,
the background should actually be.

102
00:05:58.407 --> 00:05:58.950
Right?

103
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.530
And you can put a hex code in there or
like on the fly again, if it's a one-off.

104
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.201
So if you found yourself in react, for
instance, maybe trying to put style

105
00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:11.056
attributes in a react,
JSX component, you now have a nicer,

106
00:06:11.056 --> 00:06:16.300
cleaner way of doing that, and not having
to worry about all that stuff as well.

107
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.445
And again, these will like by definition,
if you've written it, it's in your file,

108
00:06:20.445 --> 00:06:21.750
it's in your debase.

109
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.960
But if you remove it, then it will also
be like removed from the CSS bundle.

110
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.690
And on your behalf,
you don't have to think about it.

111
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:35.047
And like I said, you can like that
arbitrary values will work for

112
00:06:35.047 --> 00:06:42.270
basically, And every single utility
class that we have in Tailwind.

113
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.890
So you're not in a pinch,
boxed in to anything at that moment.

114
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.940
You can kind of have an escape hatch and
go ahead and do what you need to do.

115
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.249
But I would say that if you find yourself
doing the same measurements over and

116
00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:59.018
over and over again, you can extend
the theme or you can go ahead and

117
00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:02.210
create any one of those components,
so on and so forth.

118
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.204
The other option, which we'll talk about
the very end of our time together is

119
00:07:08.204 --> 00:07:11.230
you can also write plugins for Tailwind.

120
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.040
And really the nice part
about like the plugins don't.

121
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.900
You can do some very advanced stuff and
we'll show some of the built-in ones.

122
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.494
But the biggest use
case that we use it for

123
00:07:21.494 --> 00:07:27.050
is we've got several different web
properties that we're maintaining.

124
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.320
So I can take all of our company's
branded typography, MPM install it.

125
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.620
I pop in that plugin.

126
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.490
And now I've got all of our typography,
right?

127
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.239
And I don't have to like copy and paste
that or even pull in a CSS file, and I get

128
00:07:40.239 --> 00:07:44.113
all the autocomplete and everything's
hooked up into all the IntelliSense and

129
00:07:44.113 --> 00:07:46.050
it's absolutely wonderful, right?

130
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:46.984
And it's like,

131
00:07:46.984 --> 00:07:50.929
some of the tooling in terms of
the productivity is absolutely there.

132
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.150
Awesome.

133
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.850
So, yeah,
we've got the sign-in and spacing.

134
00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:01.250
This is the table of what all
the different options are.

135
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.680
Because I know how to write JavaScript.

136
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.380
This is literally pulled
from the default theme.

137
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.700
I did not do this by hand.

138
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.320
So this is literally from Tailwind.

139
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.560
I've actually changed my
Tailwind theme right now.

140
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.070
Actually, I'm pulling from
the default theme from NPM.

141
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:18.435
This is the official set of
measurements that you can use,

142
00:08:18.435 --> 00:08:23.420
nothing particularly notable, there is 0.

143
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.976
There is some of these factual units that
come up, there's one pixel if you need it.

144
00:08:26.976 --> 00:08:33.736
You can see that it maxes out
at around 96 which is I believe,

145
00:08:33.736 --> 00:08:38.158
at a normal zoom level is 386 pixels.

146
00:08:38.158 --> 00:08:41.571
But if you wanted to add one number
up you just go to that theme,

147
00:08:41.571 --> 00:08:43.814
you add it in there you got one number up.

148
00:08:43.814 --> 00:08:48.830
You need something for some reason
like hey I'm porting like a legacy

149
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:53.520
code base and I need 46 real badly,
you can make 46, right?

150
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.550
You should try not to do anything insane.

151
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.955
And make sure that you're using
something reasonable so that, again,

152
00:09:00.955 --> 00:09:03.030
everyone doesn't hate you.

153
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.930
But everything is tweakable,
everything is customizable.

154
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.210
Everything is wonderful,
everything is awesome.

155
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.310
The same is true for text sizing.

156
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.330
You'll see that text sizing
works a little bit differently.

157
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:18.330
We've got effectively I guess we
could call them t-shirt sizes.

158
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.780
I don't know that I've
ever seen a 9XL in person.

159
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.790
But I'm wet ready to believe it exists.

160
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:32.800
And the nice part about the text sizing
because again, this might just be my own.

161
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:39.101
Peculiarities leaking in here, which is
every time I start to write my own styles,

162
00:09:39.101 --> 00:09:43.340
I take a lucky guess on what
the line space is going to be.

163
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.586
And it's just called trial and error,

164
00:09:44.586 --> 00:09:46.800
until I don't wanna do
whatever I'm doing anymore.

165
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.470
And so not only do you get a font size,
you also get line spacing.

166
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.810
Use everything from letters.

167
00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.680
Everything is customizable.

168
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.817
Everything from letter
spacing to line spacing, and

169
00:09:57.817 --> 00:10:01.787
even in a one off case, there are ways
to kind of say, okay, no, but

170
00:10:01.787 --> 00:10:06.390
I also want a looser, like line spacing,
something along those lines.

171
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.440
All of those are optional.

172
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.229
Our ability to just basically compose
those utility classes in a way that sees

173
00:10:12.229 --> 00:10:14.760
fit and order of CSS classes matter.

174
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.243
But if you're using any of the tooling,
it will sort it in the right order for

175
00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.710
the most sensible way
to go about doing this.

176
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:24.160
And all of that is there for you.

177
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.990
Cool, let's talk a little bit
about customizing colors.

178
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.288
We got to, by answering your question,

179
00:10:29.288 --> 00:10:32.803
talk a little about customizing
colors a little earlier, but

180
00:10:32.803 --> 00:10:36.670
like we can like kind of go all the way
through and begin to extend it.

181
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.870
So there's, an app I really like.

182
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.482
I've also done this in Figma, as I said,
but in case you're not familiar with

183
00:10:42.482 --> 00:10:46.230
Figma, I'm not gonna force you to also
then download Figma and stuff like that.

184
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.410
There's UIcolors.app and

185
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:54.050
it does what it says on the theme, right?

186
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:58.835
It will go ahead and
generate a full range of colors for you,

187
00:10:58.835 --> 00:11:03.060
and you can put together
a full palette in this case.

188
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.061
So, you can pick any color you
really want, I think we decided.

189
00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:12.564
I go with this kind of purple
over here as my primary elect and

190
00:11:12.564 --> 00:11:14.660
it gives you a name too which is great.

191
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.490
Electric Violet.

192
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:18.920
Great and I can export this and

193
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.390
you can see that I just
basically get everything I need.

194
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.490
If I need a different like you can
also get sass and stuff like that.

195
00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:29.199
I can hit copy code and
I can pop it into my theme.

196
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:35.490
And we'll go ahead and
we'll just say theme, extend, colors.

197
00:11:39.002 --> 00:11:41.400
And we'll pop in electric violet.

198
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.723
And now amazingly,
I can just go into my HTML here and

199
00:11:45.723 --> 00:11:48.900
I'm gonna say BG, electric violet.

200
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.646
600, right?

201
00:11:52.646 --> 00:11:53.810
And we've got it ready to go.

202
00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.458
So I can now decide even
I'm stuck replacing some

203
00:11:56.458 --> 00:11:58.210
of the colors that are in there.

204
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.810
I can blow away that entire color palette
and only stick with the colors I want.

205
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.570
That's what we do on our like marketing
site and stuff along those lines.

206
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:10.902
Or I can extend it with the colors ,and I
could make that the primary color as well

207
00:12:10.902 --> 00:12:14.130
anything is fair game it's all doable,
it's great.
