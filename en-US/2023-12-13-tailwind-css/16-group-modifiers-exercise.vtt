00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.093
All right, so your job is,

2
00:00:02.093 --> 00:00:07.927
I got this really obnoxious version of
the kind of alert that we made before.

3
00:00:07.927 --> 00:00:09.650
And like I was showing before,

4
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.756
there might be much more subtle ones
that you might have a bunch of cards and

5
00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:18.413
a carousel or something like that, that
you want some number of changes to happen.

6
00:00:18.413 --> 00:00:21.840
I decided that taste wasn't in
my interest at this moment,

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.895
that I wanted the most egregious thing
I could come up with at the time.

8
00:00:25.895 --> 00:00:31.752
So yeah, we want something kind of
extreme here where the button changes and

9
00:00:31.752 --> 00:00:33.408
everything as well.

10
00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:35.106
So you can grab this one down here.

11
00:00:35.106 --> 00:00:37.914
There's a solution hiding with
one of those detail summary,

12
00:00:37.914 --> 00:00:39.703
things I was telling you about before.

13
00:00:39.703 --> 00:00:43.125
And you're gonna go take it for
a spin, take about five minutes, and

14
00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:45.959
then we'll kinda just very
quickly look at it together.

15
00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:49.636
And then if there are interesting ideas
somebody has on dumb things that we

16
00:00:49.636 --> 00:00:51.069
could do, I'm here for it.

17
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.378
Let's do the actual test get hand first,
which is just to kinda use the group.

18
00:00:58.378 --> 00:01:04.193
And if you had ideas for how to also put
a peer in here, I'm here for it as well.

19
00:01:04.193 --> 00:01:10.022
And so what we can do is we're gonna say
that the group is this top one right here.

20
00:01:10.022 --> 00:01:14.435
And I could also give that
one its own hover, right?

21
00:01:14.435 --> 00:01:16.121
Separate from everything else.

22
00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:18.603
And I haven't talked about gradients yet.

23
00:01:18.603 --> 00:01:24.343
But since we already had a fun
bonus gradient in the beginning,

24
00:01:24.343 --> 00:01:30.744
I now feel like it is fair game for
me to use gradient, so I'm going to.

25
00:01:30.744 --> 00:01:37.222
So I'm gonna say bg-gradient.

26
00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:39.540
Which ones of these make me happy?

27
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.012
Let's do to-top right.

28
00:01:43.012 --> 00:01:46.099
What could possibly go wrong?

29
00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:49.950
So we'll say, top right and

30
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.606
we'll say from-purple-400

31
00:01:54.606 --> 00:01:59.110
to-purple-100, love it.

32
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.928
Okay, that doesn't look too bad.

33
00:02:01.928 --> 00:02:05.573
That was pretty good, I'm into it.

34
00:02:05.573 --> 00:02:07.254
And so then what we wanna do is,

35
00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:10.436
okay, we wanna also change
the border while we're at it.

36
00:02:10.436 --> 00:02:13.927
So we'll say hover:border.

37
00:02:17.083 --> 00:02:19.760
I want a nice darker border too.

38
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.631
Okay, great.

39
00:02:20.631 --> 00:02:24.196
This button now, this button
we're gonna change that as well.

40
00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:27.888
Forget what else was in the other
one that we wanted to change,

41
00:02:27.888 --> 00:02:31.227
but I think we wanna change
some of the font colors here.

42
00:02:31.227 --> 00:02:35.420
So it's tricky cuz I didn't pick a dark
enough color to justify that, so

43
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.502
let's actually make this 800.

44
00:02:37.502 --> 00:02:40.036
So that I really need to, right?

45
00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:42.029
There's no contrast there.

46
00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:43.399
So we'll make this 600 or 800.

47
00:02:46.698 --> 00:02:48.690
And now we've gotta do some things here.

48
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.493
So, yeah, I can basically, for whatever I
wanna change here as well, I can do that.

49
00:02:53.493 --> 00:02:57.355
I'm gonna do slightly different things
than was in the solution that's there

50
00:02:57.355 --> 00:02:59.355
cause you can look at that solution too.

51
00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:06.373
So here I could say, this one is
using a border of the current and

52
00:03:06.373 --> 00:03:12.610
the hover is purple-300,
and that changes there.

53
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.800
But I wanna change that background there.

54
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.183
Cool, so let's do that,
we'll say, group-hover.

55
00:03:22.183 --> 00:03:25.575
And I don't wanna give it, I'm gonna say,

56
00:03:25.575 --> 00:03:30.356
I'm gonna try to redeem myself
here where we'll do a purple.

57
00:03:30.356 --> 00:03:32.459
It's kinda dark, I think 400, and

58
00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.613
we're gonna give it that slash to make
it a little bit, give us some opacity.

59
00:03:36.613 --> 00:03:41.873
Now that we already got that
cool gradient in the background,

60
00:03:41.873 --> 00:03:48.358
which probably isn't enough at that
point to do it, but we're here for it.

61
00:03:48.358 --> 00:03:50.634
So group-hover,
I'm gonna make that a little bit lighter.

62
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.778
And we can change stuff
like the text as well.

63
00:03:55.778 --> 00:03:58.820
You get the basic idea, so you can have
stuff that's now, like you're not doing

64
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.530
a bunch of JavaScript, you're not
adding classes all over the place.

65
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.107
You're not hoping the cascade works in
your favor and all of those things,

66
00:04:06.107 --> 00:04:10.044
you can kind of have a little bit
more control over these things.

67
00:04:10.044 --> 00:04:13.611
There's nothing wrong with the cascade,
the cascade works, as we could see.

68
00:04:13.611 --> 00:04:14.997
But generally speaking,

69
00:04:14.997 --> 00:04:19.408
then you get into specificity issues when
those child classes have their own colors

70
00:04:19.408 --> 00:04:22.318
that are technically more
specific than the cascade.

71
00:04:22.318 --> 00:04:26.072
And next thing you know,
you've lost an afternoon, right?

72
00:04:26.072 --> 00:04:29.052
And so with Tailwind,
we don't have to lose an afternoon.

73
00:04:29.052 --> 00:04:34.728
We'll say text is,
we can move on with our lives and

74
00:04:34.728 --> 00:04:38.699
go back to doing really cool stuff.
