00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.998
&gt;&gt; Spencer Schneidenbach: Well, welcome
everybody to this frontend master's course

2
00:00:02.998 --> 00:00:03.886
on C# and .NET.

3
00:00:03.886 --> 00:00:08.383
My name is Spencer, and I am super
excited today to be talking to you about

4
00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:11.273
the .NET and C# and
all of the things in that.

5
00:00:11.273 --> 00:00:14.025
I'm gonna teach you the ecosystem,
I'm gonna teach you the language,

6
00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:15.931
I'm gonna teach you things
that you need to know.

7
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:18.879
And I'm gonna open up with,
first of all, this website,

8
00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:21.945
if you wanna go to it in follow along,
all the code examples,

9
00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:24.555
everything I'm going
through is on this website.

10
00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:26.898
So you can follow along
as much as you like.

11
00:00:26.898 --> 00:00:29.011
And we're gonna hit the introduction.

12
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:32.183
And I'm gonna start with maybe
what's gonna be the statement,

13
00:00:32.183 --> 00:00:35.295
the bold statement of the year,
which is that I think that .NET

14
00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:37.954
is the best platform for
making web apps in the world.

15
00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:41.798
This is not .NET as it used to be,
.NET has a bad rap.

16
00:00:41.798 --> 00:00:46.540
I get asked all the time,
I used to do .NET it was Windows only,

17
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.135
it was closed source.

18
00:00:48.135 --> 00:00:50.946
How do you like doing that
in such an open world?

19
00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:52.848
Well, a lot has changed
in the last ten years.

20
00:00:52.848 --> 00:00:56.790
Ten years ago, Microsoft released
.NET Core to the world, and

21
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.638
it has been an awesome
experience ever since.

22
00:00:59.638 --> 00:01:03.869
I've loved .NET even back when it was
on Windows and .NET framework, and

23
00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:05.221
I love it even more now.

24
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:08.162
A little bit about myself,
I'm the president and

25
00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:11.461
CEO of a software consultancy
called Aviron Software.

26
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:15.814
So .NET is primarily what we do,
but we also do lots of React and

27
00:01:15.814 --> 00:01:19.018
React Native, in fact,
my favorite web stack

28
00:01:19.018 --> 00:01:23.882
is ASP.NET Core with React is my
favorite kind of stack to develop on.

29
00:01:23.882 --> 00:01:27.890
And we also do some Azure as well,
cuz we live in a cloud world.

30
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.135
I've been recognized as a Microsoft MVP
for the last ten years for

31
00:01:31.135 --> 00:01:34.617
my contributions to the community
on ASP.NET Core, specifically,

32
00:01:34.617 --> 00:01:36.102
as you can probably imagine.

33
00:01:36.102 --> 00:01:40.765
And on top of that, I'm a .NET consultant
with a bunch of years of experience

34
00:01:40.765 --> 00:01:43.370
doing .NET consulting in various forms.

35
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.266
So my company's been around for about
four years, there's about ten of us, and

36
00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:50.439
that's growing all the time,
which has been really cool to see.

37
00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.461
But I've been a .NET consultant, I think,

38
00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:55.614
ever since I started professional
development at my full-time job.

39
00:01:55.614 --> 00:02:00.449
I think the first thing that I got
was a website, kinda like Upwork.

40
00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:03.325
Then I got paid 75 bucks to
write a SQL stored procedure,

41
00:02:03.325 --> 00:02:04.978
which I was super excited about.

42
00:02:04.978 --> 00:02:11.259
So I've seen a ton of code bases,
I've seen lots of different .NET code.

43
00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:14.648
I've also spoken at
conferences around the world,

44
00:02:14.648 --> 00:02:18.268
specifically about .NET subjects and
ASP.NET Core,

45
00:02:18.268 --> 00:02:22.748
which is my passion, and the thing
that I spend most of my time doing.

46
00:02:22.748 --> 00:02:28.192
So, the goal of this course is to prepare
you for professional .NET development,

47
00:02:28.192 --> 00:02:32.807
kinda show you how I write code and
how I think that the pros write code.

48
00:02:32.807 --> 00:02:37.159
And of course, if you don't do this in
a professional capacity, if you just

49
00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.854
wanna build cool stuff, .NET is a great
platform and a language for that as well.

50
00:02:41.854 --> 00:02:46.698
What I wanna show you, what I intend to
show you is all of the things that I felt

51
00:02:46.698 --> 00:02:50.888
made me successful throughout my
career and my journey in .NET.

52
00:02:50.888 --> 00:02:54.909
So a few things that I wanted
to kinda touch on as reasons why

53
00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.269
you should spend time, and
I'm so excited that you're here.

54
00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.654
It's nice to see there's so many people
that are interested in .NET because

55
00:03:03.654 --> 00:03:06.629
there's a lot to be interested in,
quite frankly.

56
00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.733
First and foremost,
lots of jobs, I hire for

57
00:03:09.733 --> 00:03:13.255
.NET with some frequency
as my company has grown.

58
00:03:13.255 --> 00:03:17.075
But more than that, there's companies
all across the United States and

59
00:03:17.075 --> 00:03:20.966
all across the world that have adopted
.NET as their platform of choice.

60
00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:24.273
And that could go all the way from legacy
.NET all the way up to the modern stuff.

61
00:03:24.273 --> 00:03:29.069
So there's lots and lots of jobs, there's
lots of opportunity in the market to

62
00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.087
be a developer and
working on the .NET platform.

63
00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:34.349
I think it's fun to write and
I think it's fun to use.

64
00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.412
I may be a little biased cuz I started in
.NET, and I've written in lots of other

65
00:03:39.412 --> 00:03:45.024
platforms, I've written all the way down,
nitty-gritty PHP, WordPress plugins.

66
00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:49.616
I've written just straight PHP,
I've written classic ASP,

67
00:03:49.616 --> 00:03:55.258
which is the old web framework back in
the VB script days, made by Microsoft.

68
00:03:55.258 --> 00:03:58.661
I've written stuff in Node,
I've written stuff using Express.

69
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:01.650
I've written them all, and
I personally have the most fun and

70
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.215
enjoy the most when I use .NET.

71
00:04:03.215 --> 00:04:06.640
I like the ecosystem and I love
the language, I love the ecosystem and

72
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.711
I love the language.

73
00:04:07.711 --> 00:04:11.799
I think this is a big one,
open source and cross-platform.

74
00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.691
I still get questions,
I was asked just doing this,

75
00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:18.012
just starting this process,
and kinda meeting people.

76
00:04:18.012 --> 00:04:22.275
Yeah, you use .NET, is it cross-platform,
is that the thing yet?

77
00:04:22.275 --> 00:04:25.435
It didn't used to be, but
it is now, and that has been huge.

78
00:04:25.435 --> 00:04:30.453
For the last ten years,
they've really invested a lot

79
00:04:30.453 --> 00:04:35.264
in bringing C# and
.NET into non-Windows world.

80
00:04:35.264 --> 00:04:37.700
And you can see that I'm using a Mac,
I live it all the way through.

81
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.348
I'm not a big fan of Windows,
I'm gonna be real with you.

82
00:04:39.348 --> 00:04:43.088
There's some things in Microsoft, I don't
like that they do, and Windows is one of

83
00:04:43.088 --> 00:04:46.162
those things, but .NET is definitely
one of the things that I love.

84
00:04:46.162 --> 00:04:50.216
So, I'm here to say it is cross-platform
and it is very open source,

85
00:04:50.216 --> 00:04:52.360
which we'll talk about in a minute.

86
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.852
Another thing is that it has
a strong developer ecosystem.

87
00:04:55.852 --> 00:04:59.854
So I believe, at the core,
I'm a big business person, and

88
00:04:59.854 --> 00:05:04.269
I believe at the core that the network
effect is really powerful.

89
00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:08.126
The reason that Android, iOS have
proliferated is because people use them.

90
00:05:08.126 --> 00:05:12.474
So the more people use something, the more
value it has and tons of people use .NET.

91
00:05:12.474 --> 00:05:17.807
And thus it benefits from a really strong
and core community that, when Microsoft

92
00:05:17.807 --> 00:05:22.601
doesn't do something, the community
has risen up and the kinda reins and

93
00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:27.341
released some packages or things that
have really added value to .NET.

94
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:33.380
I will touch on some of those in this
course as well as my ASP.NET Core course.

95
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.125
It's highly performant and scalable, so

96
00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:39.716
this is something that developers ask,
how fast is it?

97
00:05:39.716 --> 00:05:43.748
Usually my answer is that even most web
frameworks, Ruby or PHP or whatever,

98
00:05:43.748 --> 00:05:48.476
they're probably fast enough for whatever
it is you're doing, but they've invested.

99
00:05:48.476 --> 00:05:49.644
The last few years,

100
00:05:49.644 --> 00:05:54.264
Microsoft has made a huge investment in
making .NET as performant as it can be.

101
00:05:54.264 --> 00:05:57.955
All the way to adding low-level language
features that for embedded systems to

102
00:05:57.955 --> 00:06:01.425
really screw squeeze as much performance
as they can out of the language and

103
00:06:01.425 --> 00:06:02.212
the ecosystem.

104
00:06:02.212 --> 00:06:05.275
Things that, frankly,
I don't know and I don't use, but

105
00:06:05.275 --> 00:06:07.119
Microsoft has taken it seriously.

106
00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:10.462
They used to, I don't know if they
still do this, but ASP.NET Core,

107
00:06:10.462 --> 00:06:12.332
when it was really starting to ramp up,

108
00:06:12.332 --> 00:06:15.465
they used to measure their
performance in nodes of performance.

109
00:06:15.465 --> 00:06:18.135
Such that,
if they had a node application hosted and

110
00:06:18.135 --> 00:06:22.383
an ASP.NET Core application hosted, they
said we can take five nodes of traffic,

111
00:06:22.383 --> 00:06:24.639
and we got it up to six and
a half nodes today.

112
00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.210
So they could handle six and

113
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.564
a half times more than a node
server doing a similar thing.

114
00:06:29.564 --> 00:06:32.760
I don't know if they still do that, but
it's highly performance, highly scape.

115
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.835
And then backed by Microsoft,
which I believe is my favorite and

116
00:06:36.835 --> 00:06:39.107
the best tech company in the world.

117
00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:42.571
One thing that I think that Microsoft
has a huge advantage over companies

118
00:06:42.571 --> 00:06:43.252
like Google or

119
00:06:43.252 --> 00:06:46.856
Amazon is that you can connect directly
with the product team very easily.

120
00:06:46.856 --> 00:06:50.734
.NET, modern and secure, and
backed by Microsoft, they pour a huge

121
00:06:50.734 --> 00:06:54.891
amount of time and resources into making
.NET the best platform it can be.

122
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:58.274
So I wanted to talk a little bit
about the goal of the course.

123
00:06:58.274 --> 00:07:01.751
The goal is to teach you about the most
important parts of the language and

124
00:07:01.751 --> 00:07:02.557
the ecosystem.

125
00:07:02.557 --> 00:07:06.299
And I define important as being
important to the real world.

126
00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:12.178
So this is a course really built
around pragmatic approach to .NET.

127
00:07:12.178 --> 00:07:14.579
This isn't an ivory tower,
there are no ivory towers.

128
00:07:14.579 --> 00:07:16.441
I'm not here to teach
you the one true way.

129
00:07:16.441 --> 00:07:20.384
I'm here to show you things that have
worked for me and throughout my career.

130
00:07:20.384 --> 00:07:23.655
I'm here to kinda show you decisions and
trade-offs, because that's what software

131
00:07:23.655 --> 00:07:26.008
engineering ultimately is,
it's a series of trade-offs.

132
00:07:26.008 --> 00:07:30.887
So I wanted to kinda emphasize that
in .NET, as part of this journey,

133
00:07:30.887 --> 00:07:35.039
as part of this course,
I will be talking about all of that.

134
00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:39.888
And I will happily and boldly tell you
about things about the ecosystem that I

135
00:07:39.888 --> 00:07:42.176
like and things that I don't like.

136
00:07:42.176 --> 00:07:44.122
I also don't believe in magic in code.

137
00:07:44.122 --> 00:07:47.052
I mean, there are some things,
if I looked at the string class and

138
00:07:47.052 --> 00:07:49.397
I tried to see how they
implemented certain things,

139
00:07:49.397 --> 00:07:51.974
I'm probably not gonna
understand that code very well.

140
00:07:51.974 --> 00:07:54.059
But some of the framework code for

141
00:07:54.059 --> 00:07:57.940
building ASP.NET Core apps is
surprisingly approachable.

142
00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.180
It looks like code that I would write.

143
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.525
So, I plan to show you my
real-world experience using .NET,

144
00:08:02.525 --> 00:08:04.682
the stuff that's been important to me.

145
00:08:04.682 --> 00:08:06.861
I plan to show you
professional best practices.

146
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:11.523
I'm not a lead coder,
I don't know how to do a bubble sort,

147
00:08:11.523 --> 00:08:16.374
I think that I don't do lots of one lines,
I often optimize for

148
00:08:16.374 --> 00:08:20.136
code clarity over what
would be latest of code.

149
00:08:20.136 --> 00:08:21.219
I wanna show you how I,

150
00:08:21.219 --> 00:08:24.990
as a professional developer, and
other professional developers write C#.

151
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:27.662
As I mentioned,
we will be looking at source code and

152
00:08:27.662 --> 00:08:31.455
I will be showing you practical
examples throughout this entire course.

153
00:08:31.455 --> 00:08:34.808
And if some things deviate from what I
would do in practice, I might be showing

154
00:08:34.808 --> 00:08:38.027
you something that really is good for
demonstrating a language feature.

155
00:08:38.027 --> 00:08:41.772
But I will contextualize that and say this
is probably not how I would write it, but

156
00:08:41.772 --> 00:08:44.541
it's important that you have
a good foundational knowledge

157
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:45.804
of C# in order to proceed.

158
00:08:45.804 --> 00:08:49.828
So I'll clue you in when
I have those examples.

159
00:08:49.828 --> 00:08:52.192
The very last thing is
that I am opinionated,

160
00:08:52.192 --> 00:08:54.129
I think opinions are really useful.

161
00:08:54.129 --> 00:08:58.655
Opinions help me make micro decisions
that help me be a really fast and

162
00:08:58.655 --> 00:09:00.225
pragmatic developer.

163
00:09:00.225 --> 00:09:02.948
Lots of people like to get
hung up on paralysis analysis.

164
00:09:02.948 --> 00:09:06.186
So, I am a believer that
making a decision and

165
00:09:06.186 --> 00:09:09.776
not waiting is better than
not making a decision.

166
00:09:09.776 --> 00:09:14.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Do I miss something if I'm
outside the Windows ecosystem while using

167
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:15.249
.NET Core?

168
00:09:15.249 --> 00:09:17.116
&gt;&gt; Spencer Schneidenbach: That's
such a great question.

169
00:09:17.116 --> 00:09:18.389
The answer is no.

170
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:23.036
I mean, it's kind of no, for
modern .NET, everything that you see,

171
00:09:23.036 --> 00:09:26.999
everything that I'm showing you today,
all the new stuff.

172
00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:29.993
And I plan on showing you new language
features as well as the older language

173
00:09:29.993 --> 00:09:33.239
features that you know because some people
work on different versions of .NET.

174
00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.352
All of that stuff is accessible on Mac,

175
00:09:35.352 --> 00:09:37.921
I do 90% of my software
development on a Mac.

176
00:09:37.921 --> 00:09:43.153
That said, there are legacy parts of .NET
that some people don't like to work on,

177
00:09:43.153 --> 00:09:44.738
and understandably so.

178
00:09:44.738 --> 00:09:47.667
It's nice It's nice to work
on new exciting stuff.

179
00:09:47.667 --> 00:09:52.505
But if you're working on like ASP.NET, web
forms, or anything in the .NET framework,

180
00:09:52.505 --> 00:09:56.913
then you're not exactly missing out,
it's just those things are Windows only.

181
00:09:56.913 --> 00:10:04.161
However, I would say that there's
no trade-offs for using a Mac.
