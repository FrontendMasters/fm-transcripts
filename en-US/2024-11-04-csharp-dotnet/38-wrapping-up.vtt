&gt;&gt; Spencer Schneidenbach: So today's
course was really about learning about

2
00:00:03.116 --> 00:00:06.306
C-sharp and .NET specifically,
the ecosystem,

3
00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:09.380
as well as all the tooling
that is available.

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.276
So we looked at the .NET Core CLI,
we looked at VS Code, and

5
00:00:14.276 --> 00:00:16.581
we looked at a lot of Csharp.

6
00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:19.936
What we went through the history why .NET

7
00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.056
was relevant why it was created.

8
00:00:22.056 --> 00:00:25.076
We went through a lot of the syntax.

9
00:00:25.076 --> 00:00:29.506
We went through a lot of the syntax for C
sharp, a lot of the things that are built

10
00:00:29.506 --> 00:00:32.616
in directly to it,
like the default types, classes.

11
00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:37.442
We spend a lot of time talking about
classes, interfaces, inheritance, and

12
00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:40.732
other things that are really
core to the language and

13
00:00:40.732 --> 00:00:43.674
pretty much most other
programing languages.

14
00:00:43.674 --> 00:00:46.544
But we talked about
the ones that are specific,

15
00:00:46.544 --> 00:00:51.133
a lot of the ones that are specific to
.NET, such as Linq which is a really

16
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:55.401
powerful way of manipulating and
dealing with collections.

17
00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:59.823
Finally, we ended with talking about a lot
of the APIs that is common to use in

18
00:00:59.823 --> 00:01:03.189
.NET, things that you'll see
a lot of in your .NET journey,

19
00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:07.545
including the file APIs, HTTP client,
JSON, and how you would convert to and

20
00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:11.709
from it, and other important aspects
like asynchronous programming.

21
00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:14.654
For those who wanna do
a little extra in the course,

22
00:01:14.654 --> 00:01:19.109
there is a section on the hosting model
talking about some of the components of

23
00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:23.198
the core host that is basically
the foundation for ASP.NET Core.

24
00:01:23.198 --> 00:01:26.182
That said, we'll be covering a lot of
that in the ASP.NET Core course, and

25
00:01:26.182 --> 00:01:28.168
that's where the rubber
really meets the road.

26
00:01:28.168 --> 00:01:33.447
That's where we'll be able to take
everything that we've learned today and

27
00:01:33.447 --> 00:01:38.397
apply it in a way that you can use to
create ASP.NET Core applications for

28
00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:43.086
working with the React app or
exposing external data to a system.

29
00:01:43.086 --> 00:01:46.972
All of that will be in the ASP.NET Core
course, which I hope you'll watch and

30
00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:48.636
I hope you'll enjoy.

31
00:01:48.636 --> 00:01:52.290
And thank you very much for your time and
I appreciate you all being here.

32
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.246
And thank you very much.

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:59.544
