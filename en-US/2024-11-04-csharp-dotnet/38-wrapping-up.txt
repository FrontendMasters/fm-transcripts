>> Spencer Schneidenbach: So today's course was really about learning about C-sharp and .NET specifically, the ecosystem, as well as all the tooling that is available. So we looked at the .NET Core CLI, we looked at VS Code, and we looked at a lot of Csharp. What we went through the history why .NET

[00:00:19]
was relevant why it was created. We went through a lot of the syntax. We went through a lot of the syntax for C sharp, a lot of the things that are built in directly to it, like the default types, classes. We spend a lot of time talking about classes, interfaces, inheritance, and other things that are really core to the language and pretty much most other programing languages.

[00:00:43]
But we talked about the ones that are specific, a lot of the ones that are specific to .NET, such as Linq which is a really powerful way of manipulating and dealing with collections. Finally, we ended with talking about a lot of the APIs that is common to use in .NET, things that you'll see a lot of in your .NET journey, including the file APIs, HTTP client, JSON, and how you would convert to and from it, and other important aspects like asynchronous programming.

[00:01:11]
For those who wanna do a little extra in the course, there is a section on the hosting model talking about some of the components of the core host that is basically the foundation for ASP.NET Core. That said, we'll be covering a lot of that in the ASP.NET Core course, and that's where the rubber really meets the road.

[00:01:28]
That's where we'll be able to take everything that we've learned today and apply it in a way that you can use to create ASP.NET Core applications for working with the React app or exposing external data to a system. All of that will be in the ASP.NET Core course, which I hope you'll watch and I hope you'll enjoy.

[00:01:48]
And thank you very much for your time and I appreciate you all being here. And thank you very much.
