00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.360
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I will venture to say
that you will never use this one.

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.753
This is mostly for library authors.

3
00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:06.048
I just want to let you
know that it's out there.

4
00:00:06.048 --> 00:00:09.644
I've told you that data only flows one
way, in react it goes from parent to

5
00:00:09.644 --> 00:00:13.131
child, and then that child to that child,
and child to child, right?

6
00:00:13.131 --> 00:00:15.363
So it only moves down,
it doesn't go back up.

7
00:00:15.363 --> 00:00:18.253
This is how you flip it on it's head.

8
00:00:18.253 --> 00:00:22.687
You can actually have
a child control the parent.

9
00:00:22.687 --> 00:00:27.296
So here I have from that I have Seattle,
Washington and if I delete and

10
00:00:27.296 --> 00:00:32.156
click validate form it'll make that
red and then refocus on it, right.

11
00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:37.575
So I have an elaborate input here and then
I need to be able to focus on that right.

12
00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:41.477
Which is something that
the parent would do, right?

13
00:00:41.477 --> 00:00:45.269
So this is actually allowing the child
to expose a function to the parent so

14
00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.480
the parent can say hey,
focus on this, right?

15
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.410
So that's what this is doing
here with useImperativeHandle.

16
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.510
I'm not gonna get too much into the weeds
of the details here because it's just

17
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.210
not that interesting.

18
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.070
But you're welcome to dig
in through this code and

19
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.220
figure out more of what it
does if this is useful to you.

20
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.720
So what this is doing,
this useImperativeHandle,

21
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.170
is it's returning this
function here called focus.

22
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.170
And now the parent call focus
on this elaborate input, right?

23
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.640
And then I'm doing that with
this forwardRef function,

24
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.520
which is basically saying, hey,
if someone makes a ref on me

25
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.160
I'm going to make functions available
on this particular item, right?

26
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.980
So now if I go down here, notice that
I have a cityEl and a stateEl and

27
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.500
I'm using ref on both of those.

28
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.528
And then if I go down in here, they have
a ref here of stateEl, and cityEl, right?

29
00:01:41.528 --> 00:01:46.525
And then I have here this
validation function which is

30
00:01:46.525 --> 00:01:50.197
law I found it on Stack Overflow [LAUGH].

31
00:01:50.197 --> 00:01:52.512
This will validate a city and
this will validate a state.

32
00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:59.639
So if the city is not valid, right, then
it'll say cityEl.current.focus, right?

33
00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:02.702
And that focus function came from here.

34
00:02:02.702 --> 00:02:06.184
So again, I really don't think you'll
be writing very many of these.

35
00:02:06.184 --> 00:02:08.789
But a lot of library authors
will be writing these things for

36
00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.177
you,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sense?

37
00:02:14.177 --> 00:02:14.779
Same thing here.

38
00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:19.151
If I delete this, and you put S here and
then click validate form.

39
00:02:19.151 --> 00:02:22.434
It'll focus on that one so that it'll
actually capture the focus there.

40
00:02:24.548 --> 00:02:28.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that's it,
that is all of the hooks that you have.

41
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.050
There are no more.

42
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.039
There was like one more, but I think they
deleted it because it was so confusing.

43
00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:37.540
These are the not confusing ones.
