00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.216
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Welcome to
the Intermediate React V2.

2
00:00:02.216 --> 00:00:07.290
I'm really excited to be here
talking to you about React again.

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.364
And today we're gonna be talking
about the extended React ecosystem.

4
00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:13.272
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: React in and

5
00:00:13.272 --> 00:00:16.925
of itself is not typically the only
tool that you use to build a project.

6
00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:20.768
You're gonna bring in things like
Emotion to do CSS, you're gonna do Node

7
00:00:20.768 --> 00:00:25.295
server-side rendering, you're gonna do
code splitting, and all that kinda stuff.

8
00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:27.964
And so that's what intermediate
React aims to teach you,

9
00:00:27.964 --> 00:00:30.371
is these kind of extended
ecosystem type of things.

10
00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:35.388
So the first thing I want you to
do is go to bit.ly, B-I-T-L-Y.

11
00:00:35.388 --> 00:00:41.177
Bit.ly, rather, /react-v5.

12
00:00:41.177 --> 00:00:42.639
And that should take you
to this website here.

13
00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:45.660
You can also just go to this link
up there as well, those both work.

14
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.380
These are my course notes, right?

15
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.230
So you see that I have a Surface here.

16
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.640
Literally what I have on what you see in
front of you is what I have here as well.

17
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.080
So If you get lost or anything like that,

18
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.380
you can feel free to just jump into my
notes and take a look at that as well.

19
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.070
So, the thing to note about this website
is both the complete the intro to React,

20
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.242
the intro part is in here,
and the intermediate part is.

21
00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:15.470
So, the introduction part
is 1 through 15 here.

22
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.320
So everything after conclusion is
the intermediate part of this course.

23
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.185
The thing to know about this is that
we're still gonna use the same project

24
00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:32.180
from the first version of this course,
and we're just going to augment that.

25
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.150
Now, you don't have to have
taken the introduction,

26
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.680
it's helpful if you have, but you don't
have to have taken the introduction

27
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.510
to do this part of the course.

28
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.220
The other thing to note,
as opposed to the introduction,

29
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.500
is each one of these is a branch, right?

30
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.549
So each one of these is totally siloed.

31
00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.120
So if you wanna skip Emotion and
go straight to Code Splitting, you can.

32
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.887
So each one of these is
totally in a different silo.

33
00:01:57.887 --> 00:02:03.490
As by way of introduction,
you can read everything that I have here.

34
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.760
But just to say who I am,
my name's Brian Holt.

35
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.613
I work at Microsoft.

36
00:02:08.613 --> 00:02:13.320
I used to be a cloud advocate, and
now I'm a senior program manager

37
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.240
on Node.js on Azure,
as well as on Visual Studio Code.

38
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.550
I live in Seattle with my wife and my dog.

39
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.550
And I sometimes talk out
in front in happy hour.

40
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.582
I am a board member for

41
00:02:25.582 --> 00:02:29.610
Vet Who Code as well as a co-founder
of the African conference, Concatenate.

42
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.930
Feel free to catch up with me on social
media here, I have all my links as well.

43
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.630
And I'm stoked as always to be here at
Frontend Masters teaching the stuff

44
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.060
that I love to teach.

45
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.050
And I'm really, really happy that they
encouraged me to open source my materials

46
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.940
so that you can share these with
your coworkers, and with anyone.

47
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.950
As always, it's really helpful for
me if you star the repo on GitHub so

48
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.370
that other people can find this as well.

49
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.060
Cool.

50
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.213
So inside of this introduction here,

51
00:03:02.213 --> 00:03:05.723
underneath where it says long
series of numbers and letters.

52
00:03:05.723 --> 00:03:10.704
If you click on the repo is here,
this'll take you to the GitHub repo for

53
00:03:10.704 --> 00:03:12.460
this course.

54
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.830
So what you see here in
the masterbranch is the finished

55
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.330
a Complete Intro to React project, okay?

56
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.307
So this is the state that it's in after
you do the Complete Intro to React.

57
00:03:24.307 --> 00:03:28.772
What we're going to do for every single
section of this particular course is we're

58
00:03:28.772 --> 00:03:33.580
gonna go back to the master branch, and
then we're going to start again, right?

59
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.480
So as soon as we finish Emotion, we're
going to go back to the master branch, and

60
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.210
then we're gonna start on server side
rendering or something like that.

61
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.364
So as soon as you're done with any
section, just clear all your dependencies,

62
00:03:43.364 --> 00:03:45.940
remove your node modules, run npm install.

63
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.712
And I'll remind you of these
things as we're going along.

64
00:03:47.712 --> 00:03:50.958
Or you can just clone a new
version of the repo or

65
00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:55.490
you can open a new branch,
those are all fine things to do.

66
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.200
But if you want to see,
I have all of the complete work up here.

67
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.670
If you click on this,
you can see that there's code splitting.

68
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.980
There's Emotion.

69
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.840
These two are for the GitHub Pages,
which is the course website.

70
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.640
And then there's Redux, SSR,
testing, and TypeScript.

71
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.300
Those are all here as well.

72
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.039
But again, for each new section,
you just go back to a clean master branch.

73
00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:18.346
You might consider using
something like Sourcetree,

74
00:04:18.346 --> 00:04:21.725
which you can get at sourcetreeapp.com.

75
00:04:21.725 --> 00:04:25.269
And this will help you if you're
not super familiar with git.

76
00:04:25.269 --> 00:04:27.263
You can also use GitHub Desktop.

77
00:04:27.263 --> 00:04:29.243
I just use the command line.

78
00:04:29.243 --> 00:04:33.874
So feel free to use
whatever suits you best.

79
00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:38.437
But I would suggest you take
's course called Git in Depth.

80
00:04:38.437 --> 00:04:41.103
Git is definitely a tool
that's worth knowing.
