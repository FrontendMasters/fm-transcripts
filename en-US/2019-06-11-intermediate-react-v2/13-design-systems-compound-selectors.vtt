00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.410
&gt;&gt; Brian: Another cool thing here is that
you can kind of build design systems

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.070
into this.

3
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.514
So I want you to make a new file and

4
00:00:05.514 --> 00:00:09.420
call it colors.css here
in the source directory.

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.030
Or sorry, colors.js, rather.

6
00:00:15.076 --> 00:00:20.379
&gt;&gt; Brian: And I want you to make
just export default object here.

7
00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:24.308
And just, you can put in like some colors
here or something like that, right.

8
00:00:24.308 --> 00:00:29.717
So I could say primary export default.

9
00:00:31.145 --> 00:00:37.887
&gt;&gt; Brian: And we'll say like,
what do I have, bf3334.

10
00:00:37.887 --> 00:00:46.311
Secondary is #d9c148.

11
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:54.469
&gt;&gt; Brian: Dark is 122622#.

12
00:00:56.621 --> 00:00:58.811
&gt;&gt; Brian: Light is.

13
00:01:01.397 --> 00:01:07.183
&gt;&gt; Brian: #81a69b.

14
00:01:07.183 --> 00:01:09.449
So now I have all these
colors in one place, right?

15
00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:12.965
So, I can actually come
over to my nav bar.

16
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:16.514
&gt;&gt; Brian: You don't have
to copy my colors exactly.

17
00:01:16.514 --> 00:01:18.706
You could put pink in
there if you want to.

18
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:22.525
&gt;&gt; Brian: The point is
that you can see here,

19
00:01:22.525 --> 00:01:26.420
you could centralize all of your
design system, your style guide, or

20
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.074
whatever you wanna call it,
here in one place.

21
00:01:29.074 --> 00:01:30.457
And now I can import this into my code.

22
00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:37.881
I can say import colors from .colors,
right?

23
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:40.955
Instead of having pink as
the background here, I can have it be.

24
00:01:44.026 --> 00:01:48.454
&gt;&gt; Brian: colors.primary, right?

25
00:01:48.454 --> 00:01:52.446
So now if I go over here,
it would be a nice shade of red.

26
00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:55.624
Or I can put colors.secondary.

27
00:01:57.608 --> 00:01:59.823
&gt;&gt; Brian: Right, and
now stuff is starting to match more,

28
00:01:59.823 --> 00:02:02.052
because those are the actual
colors of the site.

29
00:02:02.052 --> 00:02:07.862
I still think the pink was nice,
if you ask me, but this is fine too.

30
00:02:07.862 --> 00:02:11.986
So, let's say we wanted to have some
sort of hover state on the poodle.

31
00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:16.262
That's pretty easy to do here,
you just put &amp;:hover.

32
00:02:16.262 --> 00:02:19.971
This feels pretty familiar if you've done
like sass before or something like that.

33
00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:25.296
And then text-decoration: underline.

34
00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:27.634
So we just added that.

35
00:02:27.634 --> 00:02:31.628
And now, if you come back over here.

36
00:02:31.628 --> 00:02:32.640
How did I break it?

37
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.439
That's impressive.

38
00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.980
I wonder if I got into
a strange state here.

39
00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:55.028
&gt;&gt; Brian: I think my parcel just broke.

40
00:02:55.028 --> 00:02:59.556
Okay, so that's works now so
you can hover on the dog and underline it.

41
00:02:59.556 --> 00:03:02.000
That's how you do like hover states and
befores and afters and

42
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.380
all that kind of stuff.

43
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.720
You can also do child selectors underneath
that as well if you needed to, right?

44
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.782
So if I had like a child button,
you could just put,

45
00:03:10.782 --> 00:03:15.333
I think you just put button and
I think it would just work.

46
00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:17.073
And immediate child selector,
all that kind of stuff.

47
00:03:17.073 --> 00:03:21.497
You can use and as a stand-in for
the actual component itself.

48
00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:26.132
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay?
