00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.204
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: New file,
save it, call it inside of src,

2
00:00:07.204 --> 00:00:11.215
and call it store.js.

3
00:00:11.215 --> 00:00:16.390
Inside of store,
I want you to import createStore,

4
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.810
compose, and apply middleware.

5
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:24.973
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Actually we
don't need apply middleware,

6
00:00:24.973 --> 00:00:26.501
you can leave that one out,
so just compose.

7
00:00:30.784 --> 00:00:33.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't think
you even need compose.

8
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:39.704
So just createStore from redux.

9
00:00:39.704 --> 00:00:44.506
Then import, we're gonna import
a reducer from ./reducers, but

10
00:00:44.506 --> 00:00:49.410
we haven't made that yet, so
that will just be an error for right now.

11
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.590
const store = createStore(reducer) and

12
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.932
export default store.

13
00:01:00.832 --> 00:01:04.360
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So at its most basic,
this is what redux is.

14
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.674
You have one root reducer which if you
remember from the hooks section of this,

15
00:01:09.674 --> 00:01:12.910
they're gonna look exactly the same,
right?

16
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.242
So this is the root reducer.

17
00:01:14.242 --> 00:01:19.279
So it's a function that
takes in an old state,

18
00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:22.518
and gives you back new state.

19
00:01:22.518 --> 00:01:25.352
So that's what this is,
it's just a function.

20
00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:27.798
And then this is the central
repository of store,

21
00:01:27.798 --> 00:01:31.364
which we're going to eventually connect
to React here in just a second.

22
00:01:31.364 --> 00:01:34.274
Now, we're gonna do one more thing here.

23
00:01:34.274 --> 00:01:38.445
We're gonna give it this kind of black
magic voodoo that allows us to use

24
00:01:38.445 --> 00:01:40.125
the redux dev tools as well.

25
00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:43.584
So we're gonna say if typeof window, so

26
00:01:43.584 --> 00:01:48.687
if we're in the browser, so
if this is equal to object and,

27
00:01:53.674 --> 00:01:55.972
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And typeof

28
00:01:55.972 --> 00:02:06.701
window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__

29
00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:12.578
is not equal to undefined.

30
00:02:12.578 --> 00:02:15.934
So basically it's saying
if I'm in the browser and

31
00:02:15.934 --> 00:02:19.689
the redux dev tools exist,
let's go ahead and use that.

32
00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:23.853
So if that's true, then you're gonna say.

33
00:02:23.853 --> 00:02:26.298
I'll just copy and paste that.

34
00:02:26.298 --> 00:02:30.178
Call that function, otherwise,

35
00:02:30.178 --> 00:02:35.938
just give it some random function to use,
so F to F.

36
00:02:40.886 --> 00:02:45.842
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what this blob of code
does, again, if the Redux DevTools exists,

37
00:02:45.842 --> 00:02:46.598
use them.

38
00:02:46.598 --> 00:02:49.948
If it doesn't, give it some bogus
function which is exactly what this is.

39
00:02:54.978 --> 00:02:56.498
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Makes sense?

40
00:02:56.498 --> 00:03:02.371
Yeah, cool, from here, I know.

41
00:03:02.371 --> 00:03:06.254
The one other thing is, if you wanted to
use something like thunks, or sagas, or

42
00:03:06.254 --> 00:03:10.040
redux observable, or something like that,
you would do that here, as well.

43
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.660
We're not going, but
this is where you would do it.
