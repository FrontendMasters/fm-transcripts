00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.150
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now that all of that
is working together I wanna show you

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.470
some like, give you some ideas of really
cool stuff you can do now that you have

3
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.060
access to all the css and JavaScript.

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.710
So, a good example of that would be here.

5
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.580
This is all JavaScript, so
I can do whatever I want.

6
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.313
I could say like,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Const color

7
00:00:23.313 --> 00:00:27.370
equals I don't know, for
now we can make it like, pink.

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.670
And then here,
this is a template string, right?

9
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.334
So instead of having #333 there, I can
just put ${ and put color there, right?

10
00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:45.680
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That looks
marginally better, doesn't it?

11
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.760
Now you can see your line, well,
that looks really pink up there.

12
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.350
But it's very nice looking on my computer.

13
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.910
So, anything that you
can do with JavaScript,

14
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.160
you can now do in here now as well.

15
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.722
So, I can do something like,
make this a function really quick,

16
00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.281
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And say return,

17
00:01:22.608 --> 00:01:25.437
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's just make a hook here

18
00:01:25.437 --> 00:01:28.512
really quick const padding =

19
00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:37.864
useState
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

20
00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:42.125
here we'll say the initial
padding will be 15, right?

21
00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:50.130
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And set padding,
and we'll put padding here.

22
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.080
And then here, on the header,

23
00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.020
anytime that someone clicks,

24
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.910
to setPadding of padding plus 15 or

25
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.530
something like that.

26
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.106
It's gonna be upset cuz this is not
a quick cuz this is not element, but

27
00:02:15.106 --> 00:02:16.973
again we're just here for examples.

28
00:02:16.973 --> 00:02:22.510
So now if I refresh this,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Our background color,

29
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.380
animal/p background color padding,
I want it just to be padding.

30
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.494
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Padding, this can be,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Pink.

31
00:02:39.288 --> 00:02:40.720
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What did I mess up here?

32
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.220
Yeah, okay.

33
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.880
So, now, if I click this,
notice that every time that I click it,

34
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.480
it gets more beautiful and more beautiful.

35
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.666
Look, they're gonna kiss.

36
00:02:59.666 --> 00:03:04.839
[LAUGH] If my designer
wife could see me now

37
00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:10.630
she would just murder me,
just straight up.

38
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.870
But the point stands here that this is
actually pretty cool that I commend it

39
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.720
manipulate styles programmatically
like this, right?

40
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.248
This would have been a bit more
difficult to do with css and

41
00:03:22.248 --> 00:03:24.151
JavaScript being very separate, right.

42
00:03:24.151 --> 00:03:27.273
But because we've mashed
everything together,

43
00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:30.624
we get a lot of control over
what our stuff looks like.

44
00:03:36.252 --> 00:03:37.543
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about that?

45
00:03:41.743 --> 00:03:44.248
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you want to
use this in your production app,

46
00:03:44.248 --> 00:03:48.290
this design that I've made you
are welcome to, just attribute it to me.

47
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.839
That's all I want.

48
00:03:54.052 --> 00:03:55.226
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

49
00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:06.242
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's make our,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Poodle a little bit bigger,

50
00:04:06.242 --> 00:04:09.961
so I'm gonna put css equals css,
like that, and

51
00:04:09.961 --> 00:04:14.971
I want our poodle to be font-size 60px,
something like that.

52
00:04:16.797 --> 00:04:21.582
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I just added that, right
there, and now we should go over here,

53
00:04:21.582 --> 00:04:24.492
and our poodle should be nice and happy.

54
00:04:27.903 --> 00:04:34.410
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, just out of that
part right there, 17 through 19.

55
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.500
So, again, I'm not gonna say if
this is not for everyone, right?

56
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.070
Some people are just gonna find this
atrocious that we would even consider

57
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.870
putting these things all together.

58
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.560
But let me give you a couple of
benefits beyond what I've shown you

59
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.080
with the programmatic aspects of it.

60
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.420
Now if I ever delete navbar,
the CSS goes with it, right.

61
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.550
Because all the CSS was
built into this navbar.

62
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.630
How many of you have worked on websites
where you just have 2 megabytes of CSS and

63
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.150
you're primarily using 10% of it but
you don't know what you can delete.

64
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.190
Me certainly me right.

65
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.110
LinkedIn when I joined LinkedIn
we had 2 megabytes of CSS.

66
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.160
And who knows how much that we
were actually using, right?

67
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.680
So I like to use the phrase optimize for
delete ability, right?

68
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.350
Because if you're optimizing for
deletable, if your code is deletable,

69
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.090
that means it's modular, right?

70
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.860
That you can pull pieces out and the whole
tower doesn't come tumbling down.

71
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.200
So that's a big benefit as well.
