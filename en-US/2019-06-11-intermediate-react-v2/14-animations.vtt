00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.257
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what happens if
I want to do an animation, right?

2
00:00:02.257 --> 00:00:04.860
What happens if I want to spin the poodle?

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.970
Who doesn't want to spin the poodle,
right?

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.399
So what we're gonna do here
is we're going to import.

5
00:00:12.363 --> 00:00:14.073
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We can get
rid of this onclick handle,

6
00:00:14.073 --> 00:00:15.523
it's driving me crazy, okay.

7
00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:29.000
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So here from emotion/core,
we're also going to import keyframes and

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.184
then we're gonna say,
const spin = keyframes.

9
00:00:34.184 --> 00:00:37.791
We're gonna do another tagged template
literal, keyframes like that.

10
00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:49.156
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're just gonna do
a pretty simple transformation here,

11
00:00:49.156 --> 00:00:55.400
which we're gonna say to {
transform: rotate (360 deg):.

12
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.300
So again, this is not a animation class.

13
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.045
Sarah teaches really
good animation classes.

14
00:01:05.623 --> 00:01:08.121
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
if you say to and you omit from, and

15
00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:13.214
it just assumes that you're going from
the current state to 360 degrees.

16
00:01:13.214 --> 00:01:15.500
Which would be all way around,
right, which is gonna be a spin.

17
00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:20.031
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna go down to the poodle.

18
00:01:21.927 --> 00:01:27.338
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I'm going to say,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Animation,

19
00:01:27.338 --> 00:01:31.687
I think you're gonna have to say,
display:, rather.

20
00:01:31.687 --> 00:01:36.840
Inline-block;
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And animation:

21
00:01:39.985 --> 00:01:48.168
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: 1s ${spin} linear infinite;

22
00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:56.539
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So spin will

23
00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.380
actually contain the name of the animation
that it generates for you, right?

24
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.052
And so now,
we have a very confused poodle.

25
00:02:07.136 --> 00:02:10.420
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Check this out,
so you could do on hover.

26
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.410
We can move this into this and
say reverse.

27
00:02:23.425 --> 00:02:24.740
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's wildly entertaining.

28
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.310
This is good brand work cuz it brings
people's eyes to the brand, right?

29
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.815
Should work in marketing, this is now
marketing masters with Brian Holt.

30
00:02:34.815 --> 00:02:38.106
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Something about this reminds

31
00:02:38.106 --> 00:02:39.278
me of Angelfire.

32
00:02:39.278 --> 00:02:41.500
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [LAUGH] Everything about
it should remind you of Angelfire.

33
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.980
The color palette, the just ridiculous
borders, the spinning poodle.

34
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.443
This was my Geocities site, right?

35
00:02:49.443 --> 00:02:55.614
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I

36
00:02:55.614 --> 00:02:58.402
think the last time I was here,
I made it so

37
00:02:58.402 --> 00:03:02.806
every time you clicked on the poodle,
it spun faster and faster.

38
00:03:02.806 --> 00:03:05.906
Until eventually it was a blur and
it looked like it was spinning backwards.

39
00:03:05.906 --> 00:03:09.110
[LAUGH] But you know exactly
how to do that now, right?

40
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.700
All you have to do is the same
thing we do with padding.

41
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.560
You would just replace this 1s with
half s, quarter s, eighth s, right?

42
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.474
And eventually you get down to like,
0.1S, right?

43
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:22.226
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you end up with

44
00:03:22.226 --> 00:03:23.216
something like that, right?

45
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.680
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is why I'm
really excited about Emotion, right?

46
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.730
You're able to do a lot of
really cool stuff that was

47
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.990
not impossible to do before,
but much more difficult.

48
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.070
Now, because all of your
stuff is melded together,

49
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.140
it's really easy to manipulate
this kind of stuff.

50
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.476
So, I'm a big fan.

51
00:03:38.476 --> 00:03:42.979
I'm a big fan in the sense of they're
really pushing the world of CSS

52
00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:46.309
forward and
I have a great appreciation for that.

53
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:50.400
So, we're actually gonna get something
called Houdini really quick where you're

54
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.530
actually gonna be able to control how
the browser paints CSS properties.

55
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.370
It's a spec that they've been working on
for a while now, but you can actually mess

56
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.110
around with a special version of
Firefox that has Houdini built into it.

57
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.500
So eventually, I think this is
going to start merging more and

58
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.450
more with the browser.

59
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.490
So I'm pretty excited about it.

60
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.601
So if you want to check this out,
this is in the branch Emotion.

61
00:04:12.601 --> 00:04:15.380
Does not come with spinning poodle,
unfortunately.

62
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.920
Well, it doesn't come with
fast spinning poodle.

63
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.820
It comes with normal spinning poodle.
