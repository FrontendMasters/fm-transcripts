00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.410
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we didn't fix the other page, right?

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.077
So if we went back over to,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We could just go ahead and

3
00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:14.499
do it really quick, in details such as,
cuz it's also reading from context and

4
00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.020
context no longer exists.

5
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.470
So we would delete that.

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.708
We would import connect, from connect.

7
00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:30.093
Sorry, not from connect, but react-redux.

8
00:00:33.752 --> 00:00:35.542
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
the context stuff down here,

9
00:00:35.542 --> 00:00:39.071
we would delete all of that stuff
cuz we don't need it anymore.

10
00:00:44.973 --> 00:00:45.537
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right?

11
00:00:45.537 --> 00:00:50.640
We don't need this crazy stuff.

12
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.840
And theme here is just
gonna be props.theme.

13
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.022
And props, well actually,
this is going to be this.props.theme.

14
00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.367
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think that's
the only reference to it.

15
00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:11.625
Okay, cool.

16
00:01:11.625 --> 00:01:13.020
And now we just have to go connect it.

17
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.789
So here we're gonna say
const WrappedDetails

18
00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:30.780
is going to be equal to
connect(mapStateToProps) and then Details.

19
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.540
And then we're going to change
this to be WrappedDetails,

20
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.490
and then we just have to quickly
right const mapStateToProps.

21
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.890
That's gonna be this.

22
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.849
It's going to take on a theme and

23
00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.055
it's going to return an object
that has theme in it.

24
00:01:54.377 --> 00:01:58.341
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, because our redux
store has both theme in it as well as

25
00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:03.260
location, but this particular
component doesn't care about location.

26
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.560
So we don't want to inject that,
we just want to inject theme.

27
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.370
That's why we're only pulling
out theme and injecting that.

28
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.391
And so now,
if you go back over to details, submit,

29
00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:17.910
go look at Fat Boy Slim here.

30
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.170
Still reading and
writing from redux, right?

31
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.390
So everything I've shown you so
far as purely synchronous, a redux, right?

32
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.110
We didn't do any Ajax requests.

33
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.340
We didn't do anything like that.

34
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.900
In V3 of the course,
as well as perhaps before,

35
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.850
I don't remember if we did it before or
not, we go over redux thunk, which is

36
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.720
one way to do request something from
an API, get it back, feed it into redux.

37
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.530
Yeah, there's just more complex things
that you can accomplish with redux.

38
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.690
But for now, I think this is enough of
a demonstration to show you what you're

39
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.730
getting into if you if
you're getting into redux.

40
00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.961
We're gonna do git reset --HARD,

41
00:03:02.961 --> 00:03:08.100
or hard like that to HEAD.

42
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.568
And then we're gonna

43
00:03:14.568 --> 00:03:20.320
say git clean -f.

44
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.060
I have a really hard time
distinguishing mpm and

45
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.640
git cuz they're three letter things and
I use both of them constantly.

46
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.668
I think I have to do rf.

47
00:03:32.668 --> 00:03:33.761
No?

48
00:03:40.164 --> 00:03:41.808
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right, whatever.

49
00:03:41.808 --> 00:03:46.577
I think I still have, yeah,
some of these folders exist, but

50
00:03:46.577 --> 00:03:49.531
let's just go delete them manually.

51
00:03:49.531 --> 00:03:50.260
Server.

52
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.341
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Delete.

53
00:03:57.685 --> 00:03:59.591
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And source.

54
00:04:04.268 --> 00:04:06.875
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: To trash,
reducers, move to trash.
