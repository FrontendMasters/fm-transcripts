00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.230
&gt;&gt; Brian: The thing that I want
to build with you is a nav bar.

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.090
So right now,
we don't have like a nav bar up here, but

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.610
we're gonna build one together
with a tool called Emotion.

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.580
Now, Emotion is something
that we would call CSS in JS,

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.150
which is very controversial
depending on who you ask.

6
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.110
I kind of reserve judgement that I
think CSS is great, and I'm bad at it.

7
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.153
But CSS in JS I think is
a very interesting thing.

8
00:00:26.153 --> 00:00:30.830
And I find Emotion to be the most
compelling implementation of it.

9
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.300
In previous versions of this course,
I taught styled components,

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.200
which is another well known one.

11
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.990
But if you, at this point, Emotion
pretty much has won, it has most of

12
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.920
the developer mind share, it's the most
popular one, it's the most performant one.

13
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.350
So, it's definitely one to,
you should probably think about using.

14
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.591
Okay, so it allows me to do all
of my styling in JavaScript and

15
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:55.012
not have any separate CSS files.

16
00:00:55.012 --> 00:00:57.613
But what it will do is it
will compile your code so

17
00:00:57.613 --> 00:01:01.140
that there will be a separate CSS file,
right?

18
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.020
So, you still end up with JS and
CSS files at the end, but

19
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.259
it mushes everything together for
all of your stylings as well.

20
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.329
So the first thing I
want you to do now is I'm

21
00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.996
gonna stop my server for just a second and

22
00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:24.350
I'm gonna say npm install @emotion/core,

23
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.858
and @emotion/babel-preset-css-prop.

24
00:01:29.858 --> 00:01:32.750
Okay, so this is actually going to give
us the core library that's going to run.

25
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.656
The runtime for Emotion is a couple of
kilobytes, it's not very big at all.

26
00:01:36.656 --> 00:01:41.034
And then this babel-preset-css-prep allows
it to do some extra compiling ahead of

27
00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:42.506
time to make it even faster.

28
00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:48.294
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay,
i'm going to back to doing npm run dev so

29
00:01:48.294 --> 00:01:50.444
that my server is started again.

30
00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:51.860
And then I'm just going to hide this.

31
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.282
So I want you to make a new file.

32
00:01:54.282 --> 00:02:01.410
I want you to call it NavBar.js, inside
of your source directory, and save that.

33
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.859
Okay, here we're going to
import React from React,

34
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.720
&gt;&gt; Brian: import Link from @reach/router,

35
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.493
which is gonna be a link,
as in a anchor tag.

36
00:02:22.493 --> 00:02:30.285
And we're going to import
css from @emotion/core.

37
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.921
&gt;&gt; Brian: Here we're going to say
const NavBar equals a function.

38
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:42.763
And we'll do an implicit return here.

39
00:02:42.763 --> 00:02:49.416
And say header,
&gt;&gt; Brian: And

40
00:02:49.416 --> 00:02:54.856
then link to, this is just like an href,

41
00:02:54.856 --> 00:02:59.350
Adopt Me, this will be the logo.

42
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.204
And then underneath that,

43
00:03:02.204 --> 00:03:07.796
we're going to have a span
with an aria label of logo.

44
00:03:07.796 --> 00:03:11.020
And then we're going to
put an emoji in here.

45
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.022
So however you choose to
put an emoji in there.

46
00:03:14.022 --> 00:03:17.776
So in on Mac,
you can hit Ctrl+Cmd+space and

47
00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:21.055
this will open the selector for emojis.

48
00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:25.685
And you can pick your favorite logo for
the project.

49
00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:27.137
I'm definitely gonna go with a poodle.

50
00:03:34.185 --> 00:03:35.361
&gt;&gt; Brian: And
I have to give it a role as well.

51
00:03:35.361 --> 00:03:37.352
so role = img.

52
00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:51.387
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, and
then down here at the bottom

53
00:03:51.387 --> 00:03:56.050
you're gonna say export default NavBar.

54
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.290
So nothing special here too far,
right, so far?

55
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.930
But I want to do something
cool with this header.

56
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.687
Here, I'm gonna say css=.

57
00:04:10.687 --> 00:04:16.198
And then I'm gonna give it a css,
like that.

58
00:04:16.198 --> 00:04:17.994
And then I'm gonna put a back tick here.

59
00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:26.072
&gt;&gt; Brian: So notice that this is css, and
then directly afterward is a back tick.

60
00:04:26.072 --> 00:04:29.538
Now I recognize that this looks odd for
most of us, because most of us don't deal

61
00:04:29.538 --> 00:04:32.890
with tagged template literals
on a day to day in JavaScript.

62
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.167
This is a feature that came in in
2015 that it's a template string,

63
00:04:37.167 --> 00:04:41.398
as in like a template string like
one that you could have here, right?

64
00:04:41.398 --> 00:04:44.152
And this would work just as well.

65
00:04:44.152 --> 00:04:46.764
Like that, right?

66
00:04:49.274 --> 00:04:50.203
&gt;&gt; Brian: But it's tagged, so

67
00:04:50.203 --> 00:04:52.736
it's actually going to run it
through this CSS function.

68
00:04:52.736 --> 00:04:55.265
So that's all a tagged
template literal does for

69
00:04:55.265 --> 00:04:57.988
you is it runs this stuff
through a function, okay?

70
00:04:57.988 --> 00:05:00.704
Now we can write in here
in just normal CSS.

71
00:05:00.704 --> 00:05:03.967
So background-color: #333.

72
00:05:03.967 --> 00:05:09.036
Now many of you are probably
not getting good

73
00:05:09.036 --> 00:05:13.970
syntax highlighting right here, right?

74
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.040
And notice that I'm also
getting autocompletion.

75
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.042
So if I say position, I'm getting
good autocompletion here as well.

76
00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:24.230
So I'm gonna show you how to do
that really quick with Code.

77
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.109
If you click here on
the Extensions on the side.

78
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.920
Search for, and

79
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.690
I recognize this is a little
counterintuitive, but styled-components.

80
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.460
I actually have it already installed.

81
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.406
So let me find it for you.

82
00:05:37.406 --> 00:05:40.649
It's vscode-styled-components,
this one here.

83
00:05:43.581 --> 00:05:45.028
&gt;&gt; Brian: So install this one and

84
00:05:45.028 --> 00:05:48.465
then it'll just magically
fix all of your problems.

85
00:05:52.917 --> 00:05:55.018
&gt;&gt; Brian: So yeah,
just search for vscode-styled,

86
00:05:55.018 --> 00:05:56.675
it probably will be the first one.

87
00:05:56.675 --> 00:06:01.045
So as of filming,
this has 475,000 downloads, so a lot.

88
00:06:02.935 --> 00:06:05.357
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay?

89
00:06:05.357 --> 00:06:07.311
&gt;&gt; Brian: So once you have that, then you
should start seeing syntax highlighting.

90
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:10.646
You might have to restart your editor,
but probably not.

91
00:06:10.646 --> 00:06:12.434
But maybe.

92
00:06:12.434 --> 00:06:15.411
And.

93
00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:21.624
&gt;&gt; Brian: That's.

94
00:06:27.037 --> 00:06:32.368
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, so I'm gonna give
it padding of like 15 pixels.

95
00:06:32.368 --> 00:06:34.738
And yeah, let's see what that looks like.

96
00:06:39.335 --> 00:06:42.374
&gt;&gt; Brian: So we have to go put
it in first, that's right.

97
00:06:42.374 --> 00:06:46.504
So I want you to go into app.js.

98
00:06:46.504 --> 00:06:53.115
And here we have the header,
let's just replace this with Header.

99
00:06:55.374 --> 00:06:58.521
&gt;&gt; Brian: Or NavBar,
that's what we called it, NavBar.

100
00:07:01.794 --> 00:07:03.525
&gt;&gt; Brian: And
we'll have to import that as well.

101
00:07:08.951 --> 00:07:13.795
&gt;&gt; Brian: From ./NavBar.

102
00:07:13.795 --> 00:07:18.291
And we stopped using links, so
you can go ahead and delete that as well.

103
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:19.651
Up there from reach/router.

104
00:07:24.385 --> 00:07:27.654
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so now in theory.

105
00:07:27.654 --> 00:07:30.026
I think we have one more
thing to do here as well.

106
00:07:30.026 --> 00:07:30.646
We do.

107
00:07:32.424 --> 00:07:36.260
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
we installed the Babel preset.

108
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:44.718
So last thing we need to do here is
go into babble, sorry, .babelrc.

109
00:07:44.718 --> 00:07:48.007
And we have to use this one as well.

110
00:07:48.007 --> 00:07:48.556
So

111
00:07:48.556 --> 00:07:58.171
@emotion/babel-preset-css-prop

112
00:07:58.171 --> 00:08:00.919
like that.

113
00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:02.477
So you have to go include this as well,

114
00:08:02.477 --> 00:08:05.880
because babel has to do some
transformations for us as well.

115
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.350
You put in this emotion/babel, so

116
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.180
we actually need to add
one configuration to it.

117
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.697
So wrap this in another array.

118
00:08:13.697 --> 00:08:17.036
Put a comma here, and then an object.

119
00:08:17.036 --> 00:08:24.715
And you have to say sourceMap: false.

120
00:08:30.596 --> 00:08:33.636
&gt;&gt; Brian: It's annoying, because you're
gonna lose the ability to do source maps.

121
00:08:33.636 --> 00:08:38.496
But for right now, Emotion CSS
prop doesn't play well with some

122
00:08:38.496 --> 00:08:43.180
other things as well, so
we just have to turn off source maps.

123
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.553
In my opinion,
it ends up not being a very big deal.

124
00:08:50.553 --> 00:08:54.349
So now we get this beautiful work of
art that I'm probably killing our

125
00:08:54.349 --> 00:08:55.269
designer with.

126
00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:58.464
But it's gorgeous and I made it.
