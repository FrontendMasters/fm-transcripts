00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.039
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The next thing I want to do
here is I want to migrate this from ESLint

2
00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:05.740
to TSLint.

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.700
Now, let's chat a second about TSLint.

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.367
They plan to eventually get rid of
TSLint and move everyone on to ESLint,

5
00:00:14.367 --> 00:00:18.280
both TypeScript and
ESLint normal users, right?

6
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.880
So why am I teaching you TSLint today?

7
00:00:21.024 --> 00:00:24.710
Because getting, they're still
in the process of migrating and

8
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.410
it's going to take like a while.

9
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.276
I'm going to guess over a year for

10
00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:32.350
them to finally get everyone
from TSlint on to ESlint.

11
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.890
And so ESlint is just not ready for
TypeScript users yet.

12
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.372
So that's why I'm going to
show you TSlint right now.

13
00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:41.357
Is because right now,
if I'm starting a brand new project,

14
00:00:41.357 --> 00:00:44.342
I'm still going to use TSlint
then migrate later to ESlint,

15
00:00:44.342 --> 00:00:47.987
because TSlint is just better at
working with TypeScript than ESlint is.

16
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.920
So let's go ahead and get that done.

17
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.703
So we're gonna do,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Maybe.

18
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.603
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna say pm,

19
00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:14.759
uninstall eslint babel-eslint

20
00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.550
eslint-config-prettier.

21
00:01:22.016 --> 00:01:24.624
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: eslint-plugin-import.

22
00:01:26.582 --> 00:01:32.989
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: eslint plugin-jsx-a11y.

23
00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:38.385
And eslint plugin-react.

24
00:01:38.385 --> 00:01:43.581
And eslint-plugin-react-hooks.

25
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.475
Now, what you could do here is
you could leave some of these and

26
00:01:47.475 --> 00:01:49.542
take away other of them, and
kind of have both of them.

27
00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:52.004
Cuz ESlint does understand TypeScript,

28
00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:55.810
it just doesn't have very many
TypeScript specific rules yet.

29
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.191
For now, I'm just gonna show you how
to take the ESlint out totally, and

30
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:04.090
reimplement it with TSlint.

31
00:02:09.135 --> 00:02:11.843
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so in other words,
we're going to take all of our

32
00:02:11.843 --> 00:02:15.087
ESlint stuff out and we're going
to replace it with TSlint stuff.

33
00:02:25.762 --> 00:02:30.576
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
we're going to say ESlint install,

34
00:02:30.576 --> 00:02:35.780
sorry, blah, eslint, npm install -D tslint

35
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.869
tslint-react tslint-config-prettier.

36
00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:52.440
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

37
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.420
Go ahead and
delete your eslint config doc here.

38
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.130
So I'm gonna delete that,
move it to trash.

39
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.000
And then I'm going to
make a new file here.

40
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.060
Well, let's go ahead and
change this first.

41
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.578
Go to package.json.

42
00:03:11.578 --> 00:03:16.768
And change lint to be tslint --project.

43
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.981
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this --project means,
hey, there's a tsconfig,

44
00:03:24.981 --> 00:03:30.410
read everything from the tsconfig,
which it's getting from TypeScript.

45
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.170
Okay, now make a new file.

46
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.551
Once you've gotten this lint one
changed to tslint --project.

47
00:03:40.551 --> 00:03:46.890
New file, and
we're gonna call it tslint.json.

48
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.330
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and we're going to do

49
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.642
extends tslint:recommended,

50
00:04:03.642 --> 00:04:07.056
tslint-react, and

51
00:04:07.056 --> 00:04:12.020
tslint-config-prettier.

52
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.530
So again, it doesn't matter
that the order of these two,

53
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.080
it just matters that
the config-prettier is last.

54
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.830
Because all this does is turn off things
that prettier's already taken care of.

55
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.870
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then we're gonna
turn off a bunch of rules, because

56
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.760
tslint recommended is really annoying if
you don't turn off some of these rules.

57
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.050
So ordered imports.

58
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.370
This is one where you have to
like alphabetize imports, and

59
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.560
I am just not into that.

60
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.440
Object sort,
let's see object literal key sort.

61
00:04:47.312 --> 00:04:49.329
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Object literal.

62
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.420
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sort keys, that's one.

63
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.980
This one, same thing.

64
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.360
It forces you, if you make an object, you
have to alphabetize all of the keys in it.

65
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.770
And no,
why would I ever wanna do that, right?

66
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.170
So false, turn that off.

67
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.646
No console, cuz we're using console
in some places, so turn that off.

68
00:05:11.915 --> 00:05:13.820
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: jsx-no-lambda.

69
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.436
This obviously would not work with hooks,
[LAUGH] so

70
00:05:17.436 --> 00:05:19.799
you can turn that one off as well.

71
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.780
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And member ordering,

72
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.830
that's another thing where you
have to alphabetize things.

73
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.322
And as you can see,
you might be catching a theme here.

74
00:05:30.322 --> 00:05:34.117
I don't want to alphabetize anything.

75
00:05:34.117 --> 00:05:36.671
That one just doesn't
make any sense to me.

76
00:05:42.267 --> 00:05:47.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
that should get us started with tslint.

77
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.140
The next thing that you probably wanna do,
is you wanna come over here and

78
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:57.370
you wanna search for tslint for
an extension for VSCode.

79
00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.240
And obviously don't get
the deprecated one,

80
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.370
get the one that's made by
Microsoft here and install that.

81
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.560
And this will allow you to see all these
lint errors directly in your editor.
