1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.099
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
I want you to go back to App.js.

2
00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:09.685
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Delete ThemeContext,
cuz we're no longer gonna use context.

3
00:00:09.685 --> 00:00:12.360
So just go ahead and
delete that line there.

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.266
Delete the ThemeContext providers here.

5
00:00:17.023 --> 00:00:19.941
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
delete the theme here out of App.

6
00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.038
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now what we're gonna
do, you can delete that import as well.

7
00:00:31.337 --> 00:00:36.668
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Up here at the top,
we're gonna say import

8
00:00:36.668 --> 00:00:41.711
{Provider} from 'react-redux'.

9
00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:46.456
This is a react component similar to
the provider that we had for the context,

10
00:00:46.456 --> 00:00:51.064
that's going to provide the React Redux
store to the entire application.

11
00:00:51.064 --> 00:00:59.475
So inside of here,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're going to say,

12
00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:05.044
provider and store ={store}.

13
00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:12.239
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we can actually
auto import that from ./store.

14
00:01:14.192 --> 00:01:18.205
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and then we're
just gonna wrap the whole app with that.

15
00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:24.490
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And so now, Redux is
available to the entire application.

16
00:01:29.768 --> 00:01:30.434
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sorry.

17
00:01:32.697 --> 00:01:35.200
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good so far?

18
00:01:36.916 --> 00:01:38.804
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Feels good
deleting a little bit of code.

19
00:01:38.804 --> 00:01:40.343
My favorite thing to do is to delete code.

20
00:01:43.188 --> 00:01:48.063
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's go add it to SearchParams,

21
00:01:48.063 --> 00:01:51.220
so SearchParams here.

22
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.484
So up here, we're going to import

23
00:01:57.484 --> 00:02:03.749
(connect from) react-redux.

24
00:02:06.985 --> 00:02:09.634
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna
replace the context references.

25
00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:14.238
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we can get rid
of the useContext there, and

26
00:02:14.238 --> 00:02:16.530
we can get rid of ThemeContext there.

27
00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:24.087
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
here where it says location and,

28
00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:31.830
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

29
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.358
where it says location,
we're gonna put this to say props.animal.

30
00:02:42.372 --> 00:02:46.183
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, sorry,
props.location, rather.

31
00:02:48.916 --> 00:02:50.784
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll take
in props up here as well.

32
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:02.361
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, oops, get rid that.

33
00:03:06.536 --> 00:03:12.118
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and then anywhere
else that refers to location,

34
00:03:12.118 --> 00:03:16.768
we needs this to be
value = props.location.

35
00:03:16.768 --> 00:03:21.926
And rather than onChange
calling updateLocation,

36
00:03:21.926 --> 00:03:26.269
we're gonna say props.updateLocation.

37
00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:35.172
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then anywhere that refers to the theme,

38
00:03:37.473 --> 00:03:39.940
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Rather than the value being

39
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.302
theme here,
we're gonna change this to be props.theme,

40
00:03:45.302 --> 00:03:50.467
and these setThemes here
are gonna be props.setTheme.

41
00:03:54.977 --> 00:03:57.772
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so now we're gonna
have to go write the code that injects

42
00:03:57.772 --> 00:03:59.685
this from Redux for
us to be able to do that.

43
00:04:02.088 --> 00:04:06.106
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And here, we have to
change this to props.theme as well.

44
00:04:06.106 --> 00:04:10.509
Okay, so down here at the bottom,
we're gonna have to write two things here.

45
00:04:14.612 --> 00:04:17.831
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: First thing I'm gonna
write is map state to prop, so

46
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:21.504
we have to write a function
called const mapStateToProps.

47
00:04:21.504 --> 00:04:27.898
So this is going to pull things out of
Redux, and hand it to the component.

48
00:04:27.898 --> 00:04:32.197
So we're gonna grab the theme and
the location, and

49
00:04:32.197 --> 00:04:37.191
we're going to give back
an object with theme and location.

50
00:04:42.255 --> 00:04:43.186
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and

51
00:04:43.186 --> 00:04:48.682
then we're also gonna have to
do a const mapDispatchToProps.

52
00:04:48.682 --> 00:04:51.778
So this is grabbing the read data,
so it's the things that I can read.

53
00:04:51.778 --> 00:04:56.016
I wanna be able to read the theme and
the location.

54
00:04:56.016 --> 00:05:00.150
And here in the mapDispatchedToProps
I wanna be able to update it, so

55
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.370
I wanna be able to send actions to
Redux for it to tell it update itself.

56
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.332
So here,
I'm gonna just grab a dispatch function,

57
00:05:12.332 --> 00:05:17.124
and I'm going to give back here an object.

58
00:05:17.124 --> 00:05:18.838
So one of them is going
to be called set theme,

59
00:05:18.838 --> 00:05:20.342
cuz that's what we called it, right?

60
00:05:22.641 --> 00:05:25.278
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
that's going to be a function that,

61
00:05:28.375 --> 00:05:30.578
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Takes in a theme and

62
00:05:30.578 --> 00:05:38.713
it calls dispatch, with that
changeTheme function that we created.

63
00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:40.945
Because that's the action creator name.

64
00:05:40.945 --> 00:05:45.096
And we're going to pass in to that theme.

65
00:05:45.096 --> 00:05:50.559
And then same thing here
with updateLocation.

66
00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:54.572
I recognize that these are named different
things, and there is no good reason for

67
00:05:54.572 --> 00:05:55.167
that, so.

68
00:05:56.821 --> 00:05:59.497
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Update location here,
his is gonna take in the location.

69
00:05:59.497 --> 00:06:03.131
It's gonna call changeLocation.

70
00:06:03.131 --> 00:06:06.868
And again,
that's been auto imported at the top.

71
00:06:06.868 --> 00:06:10.203
And we're gonna pass
in a location to that.

72
00:06:18.843 --> 00:06:20.095
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Where did that get so
messed up?

73
00:06:20.095 --> 00:06:23.831
Okay, dispatch, this is an arrow function.

74
00:06:32.772 --> 00:06:35.454
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So again,
changeTheme and changeLocation.

75
00:06:35.454 --> 00:06:38.306
You'll see up here at
the top changeTheme and

76
00:06:38.306 --> 00:06:41.092
changeLocation have been updated up here.

77
00:06:41.092 --> 00:06:46.950
And you can get rid of this
hook right there on line 10.

78
00:06:50.292 --> 00:06:53.756
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, now,
we're gonna use the connect to say,

79
00:06:53.756 --> 00:06:58.638
export default SearchParams right here,
we're gonna say connect,

80
00:07:01.084 --> 00:07:03.507
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: (mapStateToProps,

81
00:07:03.507 --> 00:07:06.313
mapDispatchToProps).

82
00:07:08.755 --> 00:07:11.203
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then this returned the function so,

83
00:07:11.203 --> 00:07:16.034
connect returns a function that then
you're going to invoke on SearchParams.

84
00:07:18.892 --> 00:07:21.222
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's kind of
an odd way of doing it, right?

85
00:07:21.222 --> 00:07:25.953
It's a function that returns a function,
but that's how they chose to do it.

86
00:07:25.953 --> 00:07:30.193
Actually, the real reason they chose
to do it that way is because that's how

87
00:07:30.193 --> 00:07:31.396
decorator's work.

88
00:07:31.396 --> 00:07:34.289
So eventually you'll be able
to use connect as a decorator.

89
00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:36.053
And if you don't know what a decorator is,

90
00:07:36.053 --> 00:07:38.799
that's okay right now because
there's still a long time coming.

91
00:07:42.966 --> 00:07:46.660
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so that was a lot.

92
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:54.020
But now, we have in SearchParams,
we're reading and writing to Redux.

93
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.684
So let's see if we can
actually get this running.

94
00:07:56.684 --> 00:08:01.188
It should be running right now, we'll see.

95
00:08:01.188 --> 00:08:02.687
I'll do npm run dev.

96
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:24.739
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now,
if we go to localhost1234.

97
00:08:24.739 --> 00:08:30.700
So now I have this, but it's still
reading and writing to this location.

98
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.922
But now, this location doesn't
live in the component anymore.

99
00:08:34.922 --> 00:08:36.223
It lives in Redux.

100
00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:41.546
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Same with this theme,
right?

101
00:08:41.546 --> 00:08:46.187
It's reading and writing, not from context
anymore, which is what it was reading and

102
00:08:46.187 --> 00:08:47.279
writing to before.

103
00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:49.270
Now, it's reading and writing from Redux.
