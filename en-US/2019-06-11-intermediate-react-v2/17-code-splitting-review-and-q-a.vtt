00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.355
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does it just bubble
up to the nearest suspense?

2
00:00:03.355 --> 00:00:05.115
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mm-hm, so
if you had one above that,

3
00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:07.104
it would hit the first closest one, yeah.

4
00:00:10.214 --> 00:00:15.029
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I think it just crashes
if you don't have one, I'm not sure.

5
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.633
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So Facebook says that
they're using suspense everywhere.

6
00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:23.407
Yeah.

7
00:00:23.407 --> 00:00:27.823
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is there anything different
about using this with Parcel versus

8
00:00:27.823 --> 00:00:28.565
Webpack?

9
00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:30.618
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nope,
they work the same way.

10
00:00:30.618 --> 00:00:32.538
Yeah, so they both look for

11
00:00:32.538 --> 00:00:36.436
this import keyword,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

12
00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:40.200
they'll split intelligently on that
point and they both know how to do it.

13
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.320
Maybe mechanically it works
a little bit differently, but

14
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.006
lazy comes from React and so
lazy knows how to handle it.

15
00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:54.640
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Same with rollup as well.

16
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.000
So that's code splitting.

17
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.250
There's not a lot more to it than that.

18
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.930
It's a fairly easy technique, especially
with lazy now, lazy and suspense.

19
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.670
If you watch V1 and V2 of this course,

20
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.425
this used to be a lot
more difficult to do.

21
00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:09.752
[LAUGH] And it's just getting easier,
which is cool.

22
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.281
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
that's the end of code splitting.

23
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:19.650
So I'm gonna go reset
my repo really quick.

24
00:01:22.668 --> 00:01:24.239
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'll do that in here,
rather.

25
00:01:28.757 --> 00:01:33.875
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I'm gonna say git reset HEAD --hard,

26
00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:38.434
and then I'm gonna say git clean -f.

27
00:01:38.434 --> 00:01:42.182
And then I'm gonna say npm install.

28
00:01:42.182 --> 00:01:45.697
Again, if you want to check that out, the
branch of that that's available is called

29
00:01:45.697 --> 00:01:47.540
code splitting and
it is on the GitHub repo.
