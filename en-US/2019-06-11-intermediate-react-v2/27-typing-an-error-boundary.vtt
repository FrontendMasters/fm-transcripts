00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.295
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's go do error boundary.

2
00:00:01.295 --> 00:00:08.083
So rename ErrorBoundary.tsx.

3
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:14.665
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And hopefully you're
sensing a pattern here that I just renamed

4
00:00:14.665 --> 00:00:16.800
the file, and I just fixed the problems.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.420
And that's just kind of the process here.

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.670
I helped to migrate one a the code bases
at LinkedIn to be in typescript, and

7
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.470
that's literally what I did for a month.

8
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.270
That's just rename files and fix it.

9
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.320
And ask people,
what the hell were you doing?

10
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.820
Or thinking?

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.910
That's kind of my job in general.

12
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.610
So, I'm gonna move this from
being on a constructor to being

13
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.180
a public class property.

14
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.470
Again you totally could just do it like
this, and you could pass in what the state

15
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.980
is, but I like doing it as
public class properties better.

16
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.231
So I'm just going to delete that, and
move that outside of the constructor, and

17
00:00:56.231 --> 00:00:57.229
delete the constructor.

18
00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:02.694
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then we're
gonna say this is a public state.

19
00:01:02.694 --> 00:01:08.648
We're gonna say this is a public static,

20
00:01:08.648 --> 00:01:12.908
public, public and public.

21
00:01:16.926 --> 00:01:22.505
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We have to tell it
that errors are indeed errors,

22
00:01:22.505 --> 00:01:25.641
and the info is ErrorInfo.

23
00:01:32.454 --> 00:01:34.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that's it.

24
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.832
Everything else it can
figure out what it is.

25
00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.650
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Great, any questions?

26
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.646
That was pretty easy.

27
00:01:48.618 --> 00:01:50.396
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think that's
what you'll find as well.

28
00:01:50.396 --> 00:01:52.592
So, this is what I tell people
that wanna move to typescript.

29
00:01:52.592 --> 00:01:56.319
I actually have a really great
tweet that I'll show you later,

30
00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.960
that migrating the typescript is so
painful, and you're just questioning,

31
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.270
why did I subject myself to this torture?

32
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.300
Until you get to about 60% of your
code's base being in typescript,

33
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.630
and then all of a sudden,
everything is magical.

34
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.805
All of a sudden, this was a fantastic
idea and you're a genius.

35
00:02:13.805 --> 00:02:17.070
[LAUGH] That's kind of
the story of my life.

36
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.200
I just kinda go up and
down like I'm an idiot.

37
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.860
And then I'm a genius,
but mostly the idiot park.

38
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.580
Anyway, this is not therapy with Brian.

39
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.760
What I wanna say though, is there's gonna
be parts of this where you're gonna wonder

40
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.320
why did I choose to do this to myself?

41
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.390
And the payoff really comes once, most of
your code bases in typescript because then

42
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.980
your code base will start kind of
coalescing into like coherence, I suppose.

43
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.543
And, it'll be nice like you can just
import a file from another team, and

44
00:02:46.543 --> 00:02:49.722
you can see all the types in it,
and old type check all that stuff.

45
00:02:49.722 --> 00:02:50.630
It all makes sense.

46
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.350
So, yeah.

47
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.890
That's what I would say,
just be patient a little bit.

48
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.660
Cuz you have to get through a lot of
it before it starts making any sense.
