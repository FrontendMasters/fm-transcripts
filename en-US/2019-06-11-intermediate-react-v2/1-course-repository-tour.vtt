00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.634
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I need you to, if you
haven't already, go clone the GitHub repo.

2
00:00:05.634 --> 00:00:08.856
So if you've taken
the complete intro to React,

3
00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:12.391
obviously what I have in
the docs in the repo is going to

4
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:17.045
differ very slightly from what I've
actually written in the course.

5
00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:19.985
Because some of that's written on the fly,
and there's questions and

6
00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:20.774
so on and so forth.

7
00:00:20.774 --> 00:00:24.398
So I'm actually just gonna start with
a fresh, clean clone of the repo.

8
00:00:24.398 --> 00:00:28.888
So I'm gonna say,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right here,

9
00:00:28.888 --> 00:00:33.385
get clone git@gitHub.com.btholt this.

10
00:00:35.626 --> 00:00:41.198
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can get this URL as
well just by going to the repo, clone or

11
00:00:41.198 --> 00:00:47.334
download, copy that,
the screen button here clone or download.

12
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:55.224
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then, I'm gonna go
into this and then paste that there,

13
00:00:55.224 --> 00:00:56.996
git clone that, okay?

14
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.625
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and then I'm going to
go into the repo that I just cloned and

15
00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:06.943
I'm going to say npm install.

16
00:01:16.172 --> 00:01:20.834
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So probably a good idea
every single time that you go from

17
00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:23.318
module to module after this.

18
00:01:23.318 --> 00:01:27.278
To you can just either clone
a new repo if you want to or

19
00:01:27.278 --> 00:01:30.700
at least run an npm install again,
up to you.

20
00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:36.416
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

21
00:01:36.416 --> 00:01:37.980
I'm gonna open this in code.

22
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.593
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's just get you
acquainted with this project really

23
00:01:51.593 --> 00:01:52.108
quickly.

24
00:01:52.108 --> 00:01:55.120
I'll just do it here from code.

25
00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.107
If you go look in your package.json,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's

26
00:02:00.107 --> 00:02:01.574
using parcel to build this.

27
00:02:01.574 --> 00:02:06.293
It's a React project, it has ESLint and
Prettier built into it.

28
00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:09.607
If you have questions about
any of these things, again,

29
00:02:09.607 --> 00:02:11.275
refer to the intro to React.

30
00:02:11.275 --> 00:02:15.639
It has a frontendmasters/pet client,
which will make API requests for

31
00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:17.366
you to see animals to adopt.

32
00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:20.120
And it uses reach/router, as well.

33
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.201
Down here you can see that
you have some scripts to use.

34
00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:29.038
So one of these here, if you need to clear
the build cache for whatever reason,

35
00:02:29.038 --> 00:02:33.092
there is a clear build cache
function here that will remove that.

36
00:02:33.092 --> 00:02:36.849
There is a dev thing which
will run this project.

37
00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:42.028
So if I open my client right on,
say npm run dev.

38
00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:46.978
It'll start running the developer
server that I can reach that.

39
00:02:46.978 --> 00:02:49.112
If for whatever reason you're offline, or

40
00:02:49.112 --> 00:02:53.158
our API isn't working the way that you're
expecting it to, you can do dev:mock.

41
00:02:53.158 --> 00:02:57.665
So like this, whoops, npm run dev:mock.

42
00:02:57.665 --> 00:02:59.402
And this will run the API
client in mock mode,

43
00:02:59.402 --> 00:03:02.207
which means that you'll be getting
fake data and it won't be going out.

44
00:03:02.207 --> 00:03:05.185
So if you're on the train
watching these videos offline,

45
00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.872
thanks Front End Masters for
doing offline videos.

46
00:03:07.872 --> 00:03:11.056
You can actually run
this client offline and

47
00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:14.765
the entire project works offline,
which is cool.

48
00:03:14.765 --> 00:03:19.103
Okay, you can run npm, run format which
will format everything with Prettier.

49
00:03:19.103 --> 00:03:23.983
And lint it, and then my favorite
are the existing tests that if you

50
00:03:23.983 --> 00:03:28.875
send npm run test" it says,
log there are no tests, [LAUGH] right.

51
00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:33.233
No test specified, right there.

52
00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:41.117
That's it, so right now I'm gonna run
this in npm run dev mode, like that.

53
00:03:41.117 --> 00:03:44.327
And this will open
a development server on 1234.

54
00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:50.897
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Eventually, there we go.

55
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:56.978
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this is the project
that we built together in the complete

56
00:03:56.978 --> 00:03:57.900
intro, right?

57
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.632
So as of writing results,
it's location is in Seattle.

58
00:04:01.632 --> 00:04:07.920
So if I submit here,
this will open these particular animals.

59
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.575
The only two locations this
works in right now is Seattle,

60
00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:16.094
Washington and San Francisco California.

61
00:04:16.094 --> 00:04:18.773
We'll work to make this work
in every location, but for

62
00:04:18.773 --> 00:04:21.057
now it's only working
in these two locations.

63
00:04:21.057 --> 00:04:24.882
I'll look at Theo, you're adorable.

64
00:04:26.437 --> 00:04:28.367
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And so
here you can click adopt Theo.

65
00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:29.222
If you click Yes,

66
00:04:29.222 --> 00:04:32.653
it'll actually take you to the adoption
page where you can adopt Theo.

67
00:04:38.068 --> 00:04:39.436
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So go back.

68
00:04:42.541 --> 00:04:44.118
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then you can select,

69
00:04:44.118 --> 00:04:48.713
if you move from dog to horse,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can

70
00:04:48.713 --> 00:04:52.497
see it changes the breeds of
the horses like miniature

71
00:04:52.497 --> 00:04:56.957
horses,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like Gidget.

72
00:04:58.793 --> 00:05:01.762
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then you can change
the theme of your application as well.
