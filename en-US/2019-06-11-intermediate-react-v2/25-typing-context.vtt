00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.000
&gt;&gt; Brian: So let me show you
something else that's really useful.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.388
If you just hover over
something like this,

3
00:00:03.388 --> 00:00:04.749
it'll give you the function definition.

4
00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:08.788
But if you actually Cmd+click on it, it's
gonna take you into the type definition so

5
00:00:08.788 --> 00:00:10.540
you can see exactly what's in here.

6
00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:18.859
&gt;&gt; Brian: So this gives you back,
&gt;&gt; Brian: A S and

7
00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.850
Dispatch&lt;SetState.

8
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.980
So it actually doesn't have
a specific type of what it does.

9
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.000
Okay, that's good to know.

10
00:00:30.598 --> 00:00:31.780
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yep, same thing.

11
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.140
So what I'm looking at here
is after this colon here,

12
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.162
I was trying to see if hooks had
a specific type they returned.

13
00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:42.270
And it just tells you,
no, it returns an array.

14
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.260
So we just have to type that.

15
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.780
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
this isn't quite correct, yet.

16
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.110
What we want this to be is,
this createContext, is going to be, and

17
00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.790
we're going to give it what's
here called a type parameter.

18
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.590
And it's gonna be a string.

19
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:12.541
&gt;&gt; Brian: Array of string and a,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Theme: string,

20
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:16.160
and this returns to you, void.

21
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.503
So it doesn't return anything, okay?

22
00:01:23.513 --> 00:01:24.740
&gt;&gt; Brian: The other thing we forgot to.

23
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.012
We have to rename ThemeContext to be .tsx.

24
00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:35.798
&gt;&gt; Brian: You also gotta name this .ts
cuz there's not any JSX in it, but

25
00:01:35.798 --> 00:01:38.290
I just rename everything
TSX at this point, so.

26
00:01:45.686 --> 00:01:47.780
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, and
that's all we have to do for this.

27
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.350
What this is doing is this
is telling createContext

28
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.120
what kind of thing we're gonna give it,
right?

29
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.950
And we told it we're gonna
give you a string, right?

30
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.270
And we're gonna give you a function
that takes in a string and

31
00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.784
doesn't give back anything, right?

32
00:01:59.784 --> 00:02:02.340
Which is what this is.

33
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.370
Make sense?

34
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.669
It's like a parameter to a type.

35
00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:05.169
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's not like that
