00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.558
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let me show you the part
about Redux that's actually very,

2
00:00:03.558 --> 00:00:05.351
very compelling in my opinion.

3
00:00:05.351 --> 00:00:09.983
So I want you to go
install redux dev tools.

4
00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:17.439
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I have Firefox, so
that's here, I've already installed it but

5
00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.532
there's also Chrome up here as well.

6
00:00:22.916 --> 00:00:25.309
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
I have those installed, so

7
00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:30.767
I'm gonna go back to my project here,
and I'm gonna open the redux dev tools.

8
00:00:33.873 --> 00:00:36.073
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
you can see here there's an INIT object or

9
00:00:36.073 --> 00:00:39.582
an INIT action that happens but
let's say if I delete all this at once,

10
00:00:39.582 --> 00:00:42.572
there's a change location
action you can see there right?

11
00:00:42.572 --> 00:00:47.947
And you can see that there
was an action that changes

12
00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:52.706
from CLWA to nothing,
so you can see the dev.

13
00:00:52.706 --> 00:00:56.162
You can see what the action looks like,
you can see what the state was, or

14
00:00:56.162 --> 00:00:57.477
the current state is like.

15
00:00:57.477 --> 00:01:00.408
So the location is empty and
the theme is dark blue.

16
00:01:00.408 --> 00:01:02.945
And I could start typing in here, so

17
00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:06.591
they'll be one action for
every keystroke right?

18
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:12.314
So Salt Lake City,

19
00:01:12.314 --> 00:01:15.537
UT right?

20
00:01:15.537 --> 00:01:20.501
And you can see here,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can

21
00:01:20.501 --> 00:01:23.913
kind of go forward, but check this out.

22
00:01:23.913 --> 00:01:26.761
I can actually time travel with redux,
right?

23
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:31.720
So, you can see here in my timeline here,
if I started clicking back,

24
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.940
I start walking backwards
through my stage changes right?

25
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.558
And then I can go forward again.

26
00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:43.024
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
that's what cool about redux, right?

27
00:01:43.024 --> 00:01:44.818
It allows this time traveling debugging.

28
00:01:44.818 --> 00:01:50.430
So I can actually just go all the way
back here, and I can just click Play.

29
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.502
And then it's gonna just start doing
everything that I just did back to me.

30
00:01:57.054 --> 00:02:00.193
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you know what,
we should probably skip that one.

31
00:02:00.193 --> 00:02:01.733
So you can say, Skip.

32
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.330
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, and so notice
it will actually just go through and

33
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.806
skip these and
then it'll just jump to the next one.

34
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.992
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Pretty compelling, right?

35
00:02:14.992 --> 00:02:16.964
So how does this work?

36
00:02:16.964 --> 00:02:20.486
Well, this is called
transactional programming, right?

37
00:02:20.486 --> 00:02:23.226
Each one of these actions is
technically one transaction, right?

38
00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:27.430
And the thing about transactions is you
can just roll back to the beginning and

39
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.379
replay the transactions, right?

40
00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.629
And you can just not do some
of the transactions, right?

41
00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.147
So what this is actually
doing when I say skip, right?

42
00:02:34.147 --> 00:02:37.305
It's just going through and saying okay,

43
00:02:37.305 --> 00:02:41.888
just don't apply that one, and
then reapply all the other ones.

44
00:02:41.888 --> 00:02:47.108
Same thing here, if I come and
change the theme, I can go down here and

45
00:02:47.108 --> 00:02:53.146
see the change theme and see what that
looks like, which is pretty cool as well.

46
00:02:56.428 --> 00:02:58.563
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: One more
pretty cool thing here.

47
00:02:58.563 --> 00:03:03.414
So let's say I have this right here,
and I go here and

48
00:03:03.414 --> 00:03:08.156
I can click on this thing
that says Test right here,

49
00:03:08.156 --> 00:03:12.256
and it generated a unit test for
me, right?

50
00:03:12.256 --> 00:03:15.114
I can actually literally copy and

51
00:03:15.114 --> 00:03:20.023
paste this Into my unit tests and
it'll just work for me.

52
00:03:20.023 --> 00:03:22.254
It's really generating user tests for you.

53
00:03:22.254 --> 00:03:23.462
User test?

54
00:03:23.462 --> 00:03:28.232
I don't know why I keep saying
that unit tests for you.

55
00:03:28.232 --> 00:03:31.733
So this is Jest but it also does Mocha,
Tape, and Ava as well.

56
00:03:37.525 --> 00:03:41.991
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the dev tools are pretty
amazing, I saw one company what they would

57
00:03:41.991 --> 00:03:46.380
do if a user had a crash, they would
dump all the actions that the user

58
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.385
committed and send it off to the air
logging service, so they could literally

59
00:03:51.385 --> 00:03:55.946
step through everything that their
user was doing to cause the crash.

60
00:03:55.946 --> 00:03:56.742
Pretty cool, right?

61
00:03:56.742 --> 00:03:58.056
Pretty compelling.

62
00:03:58.056 --> 00:04:03.364
Again, with that kind of stuff you
need to be really careful with GDPR,

63
00:04:03.364 --> 00:04:05.672
but nonetheless pretty cool.
