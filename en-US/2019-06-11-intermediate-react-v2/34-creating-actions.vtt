00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.899
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now inside
of your directory,

2
00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:04.809
inside of source we're
gonna make a new folder.

3
00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:07.200
And that one's gonna be
called actionCreators.

4
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.400
This isn't necessarily a requirement,
but I find this to be helpful and

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.470
I would say many people do it.

6
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.640
Sometimes people will just
directly create the actions, but

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.300
we're gonna make action creators.

8
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.442
So we're going to make this one, this
one's gonna be called ChangeLocation.js.

9
00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:35.184
And this is just going
to export a function

10
00:00:35.184 --> 00:00:39.950
called export default function.

11
00:00:42.352 --> 00:00:48.207
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: changeLocation,
that takes in a location,

12
00:00:48.207 --> 00:00:55.294
and it returns an object
of type: CHANGE_LOCATION,

13
00:00:55.294 --> 00:01:00.081
and payload is going to be location.

14
00:01:04.165 --> 00:01:06.250
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is what
an action looks like, right?

15
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.320
So this is an action creator, right?

16
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.918
It's a function that you give it
a location it gives you back an action.

17
00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:16.626
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And again, people will just
sometimes directly dispatch objects that

18
00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:17.540
look like this.

19
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.970
I'm fine with that as well.

20
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.744
But I'm just gonna teach you kind of
the more structured way to do it, and

21
00:01:22.744 --> 00:01:24.509
then I'll leave it up to
you how you wanna do it,

22
00:01:27.323 --> 00:01:28.284
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

23
00:01:33.401 --> 00:01:36.006
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna
make one more here, and

24
00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:39.770
this is going to be called changetheme.js.

25
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.196
Looks relatively the same,
changeTheme(theme),

26
00:01:46.196 --> 00:01:54.219
theme and CHANGE_THEME,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?
