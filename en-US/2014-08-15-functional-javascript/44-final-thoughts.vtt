00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:08.016
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: We had two streams we
ended up making, our search input and

2
00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:09.180
our click stream.

3
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.730
Clicks stream, how would we read this?

4
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:13.500
What happens?

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.473
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Well, we just left it
messy with the inner compose [CROSSTALK].

6
00:00:16.473 --> 00:00:19.344
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: There's a cool part of it
actually because what we did is we put it

7
00:00:19.344 --> 00:00:20.090
on document.

8
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.790
We found toDocument so
that was the maybe thing.

9
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.220
You remember that, Brian?

10
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.290
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Yeah.
It's in that YouTube ID where you try to

11
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.160
get the YouTube ID at any document click.

12
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.970
So we just take any document click and
put it in a maybe.

13
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.140
And then if it doesn't
have a YouTube ID on it,

14
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.690
if it's not an element with a YouTube ID
we just don't run the player.

15
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.180
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: So
when I'm clicking around on the page but

16
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.930
not on an LI It gets to click.

17
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.350
It goes through the stream.

18
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.680
It eventually hits this YouTube ID thing.

19
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.570
Actually, yeah it tries.

20
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.140
But this could return like not a maybe,
like a bad maybe.

21
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.750
Maybe you don't map over because
the thing you clicked on,

22
00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.990
didn't have a dated YouTube ID.

23
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.970
Had you clicked on the list, though, it'll
get picked up and it'll get what it needs.

24
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.010
So, the click could be anything.

25
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.260
I don't know how sound it is,
but it's fun.

26
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.840
It's interesting to see
that you click anything and

27
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.480
it knows what to do because
it's in the right functors.

28
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.320
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: The bottom line there,

29
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.000
I think we'd probably factor a little bit
before pushing main thing because that's

30
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.940
just kinda like why are we
map composing this stuff.

31
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.026
Like Player creates pure,
why doesn't that go up there I would

32
00:01:28.026 --> 00:01:32.898
probably put the player create inside
of some kind of just returning HTML.

33
00:01:32.898 --> 00:01:37.339
So we're saying on value get the YouTube
ID why not just get the player right there

34
00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:39.702
and then we'll set the HTML to the player?

35
00:01:39.702 --> 00:01:42.536
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: I think the reason it
didn't come up in regular Chrome is

36
00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:45.691
because of an iFrame restriction
of some kind like a YouTube.

37
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:48.099
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Yeah, but
I was just pointing out,

38
00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:53.100
these are just like what puts together
before I wish we'd refactor a bit.

39
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.610
Anyway, yeah, I think we should push
this through refactor for a second,

40
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.680
then push it as an example of something
you can do where your whole app is pure,

41
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.016
easily tested, memorizable,
portable, whatever.

42
00:02:06.016 --> 00:02:11.730
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Yeah, so
we'll put all my stuff or so, here see you

43
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.570
too and all the libraries
you saw the slides all over

44
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.200
any changes that happened to jazz fans and
all the stuff will be available for

45
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.140
you to try again and if/when you have
questions and all these craziness.

46
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.440
Just tweet at us or whatever.

47
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.110
We're happy to help.

48
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.100
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Yeah, I also said,

49
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.350
I didn't have time to get to
applicatives and monoids.

50
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.550
Those are so
much easier than functors and monads.

51
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.400
So if you look at the slides and
you guys have questions, just email me.

52
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.910
Or we can try to have some
kind of thread follow up.

53
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.020
We can talk,

54
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.960
maybe we could get an email list of just
like, here's the rest of the slides.

55
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.600
Ask me questions on the list,
or something?

56
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.790
I don't know if there's a way to get that.

57
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.910
But, yeah, we'll just figure it out.

58
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.550
Or we'll set it up and you can sign up.

59
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, we have a forum.

60
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.650
We just don't use it, so
I can set up a new thread, or whatever,

61
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.890
and send everyone to it.

62
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:05.570
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Cool, yeah.

63
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.380
So in case you were dying to
hear what applicatives were you

64
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.695
could talk to me about it.

65
00:03:09.695 --> 00:03:11.140
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: And the other part of

66
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.920
it is there's a lens library, that,

67
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.946
it's mind-blowing if you know how functors
work, otherwise it's just neat, so.

68
00:03:18.946 --> 00:03:21.580
[LAUGH] If you guys go
check out lenses and

69
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.410
kind of understand it's built on F map.

70
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.380
It's like woah, but
that's all I wanted to say.

71
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.820
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: That's all
I want to say as well.

72
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.780
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Yay.

73
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.280
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Cats
