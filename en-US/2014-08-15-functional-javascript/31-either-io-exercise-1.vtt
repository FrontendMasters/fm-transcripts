[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.877 --> 00:00:07.960
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Again,
I'm gonna go ahead and define this log.

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.810
I wonder if this'll,
I think you guys will probably all,

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.850
you know what, forget it,
it's not gonna be easy to log.

5
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.670
Well, maybe it will be.

6
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.914
Who knows, let's try it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Maybe

7
00:00:23.914 --> 00:00:28.090
you guys will get this change, maybe you
won't, I don't know, JS Bin mysteries.

8
00:00:40.345 --> 00:00:41.060
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: I didn't say it

9
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.550
earlier, but I'll say it now.

10
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.260
Either is good,
if you put it inside a future,

11
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.780
when you're doing asynchronous stuff.

12
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.680
We'll talk about future soon,
but right now,

13
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.360
let's think of it,
futures wrap up that too.

14
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.284
So, let's just worry about synchronous
versions of this when you're doing,

15
00:01:00.284 --> 00:01:08.792
dealing with either right now.
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: [LAUGH]

16
00:01:40.014 --> 00:01:40.904
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Is anybody having

17
00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:42.809
trouble understanding any of these?

18
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.778
This first one, you just wanna write ex1.

19
00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:00.886
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: It's exactly what we've

20
00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:03.586
been doing with the other ones,
just with different types.

21
00:02:07.884 --> 00:02:12.666
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]

22
00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:13.257
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Yeah, and

23
00:02:13.257 --> 00:02:16.756
everybody has their own JS Bin URL,
once you start editing it.

24
00:02:16.756 --> 00:02:19.984
So if you have problems, we'll just
put it up here and play with it.

25
00:02:19.984 --> 00:02:21.178
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Might be even better, yeah.

26
00:02:21.178 --> 00:02:22.829
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Yeah.

27
00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.120
That's a really good idea,
actually [LAUGH].

28
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.170
Chat or raise a hand if you have problems.

29
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.140
We'll drop it on the screen up here and
walk, work with you on it.

30
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.588
And hundreds of people will love you for
it.

31
00:02:37.588 --> 00:02:42.580
Hundreds [LAUGH], thousands.

32
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.920
Okay, so we're just gonna go through these
quickly, cuz we're running out of time,

33
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.520
and the main, it's the same stuff.

34
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.090
Okay, so, and I know it might not
look like the same stuff, but

35
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.480
let's just talk about it for a second.

36
00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.412
So what we wanna do is, checkActive and
showwelcome, if they're active.

37
00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:05.043
So, checkActive is gonna return us a right
or a left, depending on if they're active.

38
00:03:05.043 --> 00:03:10.220
So, Gary's not active, but to reset
is active, down here in the tests.

39
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.910
So what I'm gonna do is,
basically, let's see,

40
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.460
we're gonna checkActive,
we'll compose that with showwelcome.

41
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.620
But, by golly,
checkActive returns a right or a left,

42
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.850
we can't just call showwelcome,
which expects a user.

43
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.790
So we have to map over that.

44
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.101
And at this point, you should be like,

45
00:03:31.101 --> 00:03:34.890
that's the same thing [LAUGH] that
we've been doing to run that one.

46
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.082
So one's good.

47
00:03:38.082 --> 00:03:42.467
And it runs for Teresa, but not for Gary,
and if you want me to prove that, I can

48
00:03:42.467 --> 00:03:47.340
do that and, you know, and you say, no,
you expected this, but you put it either.

49
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.780
So it's good to fail these tests just
to make sure you're on the right track.
