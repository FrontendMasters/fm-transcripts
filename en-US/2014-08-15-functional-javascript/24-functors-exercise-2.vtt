[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.373 --> 00:00:06.547
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: So,
everybody play around with Identity.

3
00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:12.830
See if you can get exercise one to pass
and exercise two, and ask me questions.

4
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.347
Hey, Brian.
Could you look at Mims W,

5
00:00:17.347 --> 00:00:23.349
look at the chat to double check that
his or her understanding is correct?

6
00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.152
Yes, totally right.

7
00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:30.590
Mims W, to clear this up,
map is not list's map,

8
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.468
map is my map,
that just calls map on whatever it gets.

9
00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:39.520
So let's clear this up a little bit
just to make sure you guys understand.

10
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.988
I have an Identity of 2.

11
00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:45.440
And I can map add(1) to it.

12
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.885
And then I should get an Identity of 3,
result.

13
00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:55.128
So let's run it and look at our result.

14
00:00:55.128 --> 00:00:59.965
toString.

15
00:00:59.965 --> 00:01:01.660
Cannot read property of undefined.

16
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.999
result Identity map add 1.

17
00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:06.546
Sorry, it always gets me.

18
00:01:06.546 --> 00:01:10.420
[LAUGH] There it is.

19
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.234
So this map is the same as this map up
here, where I can do identity of 2,

20
00:01:17.234 --> 00:01:21.890
or whatever, the string 2, or 29,

21
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.410
or an array of a string of 29.

22
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.522
So the idea is that, well,
I guess then I couldn't add 2 to it.

23
00:01:32.522 --> 00:01:37.100
But yeah, map is not list map, itâ€™s
a different map that works on anything.

24
00:01:38.818 --> 00:01:41.199
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: So the slide where
you brought in of week three,

25
00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:44.420
that's what has that implementation in it.

26
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.100
Is that what I'm seeing up, line 3 and 4?

27
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.860
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Yes,
map is the PointFree's map.

28
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.017
What it's going to do is exactly,
Mims pointed this out.

29
00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:58.987
Am I saying that right?

30
00:01:58.987 --> 00:02:03.875
[LAUGH] Map is the one I
showed right here, and

31
00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:08.510
then glazed over and walked away from.

32
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:09.910
There it is.

33
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.280
That's my map.

34
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.870
It just calls map on
whatever object it is.

35
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.450
So, but it's curried, so works like
a list map, but it works on any functor.

36
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.120
A list is a functor, or
an array is a functor, and so is identity.

37
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.420
And so is maybe.

38
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.442
So what you're really gonna be doing

39
00:02:32.442 --> 00:02:38.115
is calling .map when you call this line.

40
00:02:38.115 --> 00:02:41.537
One thing that's really cool is,
this map is like, I'm waiting for

41
00:02:41.537 --> 00:02:42.600
my second argument.

42
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.070
It could be any functor at all.

43
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.411
I'm just gonna call .map on it.

44
00:02:45.411 --> 00:02:48.530
It's an interface, it's .mappable,
you know what I mean?

45
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.956
So up here, you need your specific thing,
but down there you don't.

46
00:02:58.688 --> 00:03:01.332
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Also, anybody can raise
their hand if you're having trouble with

47
00:03:01.332 --> 00:03:02.426
the exercises [INAUDIBLE].

48
00:03:02.426 --> 00:03:03.843
That was easy.

49
00:03:03.843 --> 00:03:09.102
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH] So, [INAUDIBLE]
Yeah, Christian T wants to make a note

50
00:03:09.102 --> 00:03:14.045
that at some point,
he would love to hear if there's any

51
00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:20.162
production-ready libraries to
do this fantasy-land type stuff.

52
00:03:20.162 --> 00:03:21.618
We are [LAUGH].

53
00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:25.948
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: We'll be showing you
the libraries that we're gonna use in our

54
00:03:25.948 --> 00:03:31.350
demo later, but we'll go through
a couple of the libraries we're using.

55
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.120
I have to say, the state of
libraries is not where it should be,

56
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.940
because a lot of this is really new.

57
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.348
It's like if you picked up Node the day
it was invented, and you were like, man,

58
00:03:42.348 --> 00:03:43.708
where's all my plugins?

59
00:03:43.708 --> 00:03:45.660
[LAUGH] I'm like, go make them.

60
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.870
You're gonna be awesome for making them.

61
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.268
[LAUGH] So.

62
00:03:51.451 --> 00:03:55.120
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Strategy
design pattern, cool analogy.

63
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.595
Passing in a function as a strategy,
beautiful.

64
00:04:03.303 --> 00:04:07.525
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So it's like a new
function [INAUDIBLE] I can keep talking,

65
00:04:07.525 --> 00:04:09.600
but might as well just wait.

66
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.383
How do I know that [INAUDIBLE]
is going to be applied

67
00:04:15.383 --> 00:04:21.880
over this Identity [INAUDIBLE]
there's no reference.

68
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.791
[CROSSTALK] Does that make sense?

69
00:04:25.791 --> 00:04:33.237
[INAUDIBLE] Yeah, so what I was doing is
basically giving a double reference to.

70
00:04:33.237 --> 00:04:35.432
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: I think at this point,
right, right, right.

71
00:04:35.432 --> 00:04:38.035
So, I think this is- You were
trying to take the result and

72
00:04:38.035 --> 00:04:39.216
apply it over a function.

73
00:04:39.216 --> 00:04:42.040
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I was, yeah,
this is what I was doing, right?

74
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.865
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: Yeah,
we have trouble doing this, is cuz, yeah.

75
00:04:48.865 --> 00:04:49.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I get it.
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: Totally.

76
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.978
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Cool.

77
00:04:50.978 --> 00:04:54.189
Thank you.

78
00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:56.738
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: Hey Joe, is there
anything I could say that might clear

79
00:04:56.738 --> 00:04:57.297
things up?

80
00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.270
I know, that's the- [LAUGH]
The feeling of being over there.

81
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.810
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Yeah,

82
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.760
what's the one thing that I could say
that'll make everybody grok functors?

83
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.291
If you get rid of the word
functor from your vernacular,

84
00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:13.710
you just say mappable,
I want to map over a mappable.

85
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.206
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: That
just means run inside.

86
00:05:15.206 --> 00:05:16.424
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Map-over-able.

87
00:05:16.424 --> 00:05:18.820
[LAUGH].

88
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.504
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: Everybody else
okay with the exercises, or not?

89
00:05:34.616 --> 00:05:36.348
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: But
yeah, to cut to the chase,

90
00:05:36.348 --> 00:05:39.290
the production-ready code is few and
far between.

91
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.293
But what's good about this
stuff is it's out there and

92
00:05:45.293 --> 00:05:48.151
it's scattered, and it needs help.

93
00:05:55.451 --> 00:06:03.154
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Okay, let's see here.

94
00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:19.620
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Just so
you guys understand example two,

95
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.530
xs is an Identity of a list.

96
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.946
It's not a list, it has,
I keep saying list,

97
00:06:26.946 --> 00:06:30.495
it has an array inside the Identity.

98
00:06:30.495 --> 00:06:37.349
So you can't call head on Identity,
you have to map head over Identity.

99
00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:42.738
So head will work on the list,
not the Identity itself.

100
00:06:42.738 --> 00:06:47.241
You can think of it as,

101
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:52.700
if I want to add 1 to a list.

102
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.720
Let me do that.

103
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.774
So I have this add(1) function,
let me just call it inc.

104
00:06:59.774 --> 00:07:04.140
If I wanna inc a list,
that's not gonna work.

105
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.770
That's just gonna blow up.

106
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.958
And it's not because
there's a lot of things,

107
00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:13.115
it's because it's inside a list,
and inc expects a number.

108
00:07:13.115 --> 00:07:15.340
Even if there's one thing in the list,
it's not gonna work.

109
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:23.805
You have to map inc over that
list to get a new list of five.

110
00:07:23.805 --> 00:07:31.077
And in that exact same way, if it wasn't
in a list, it was instead in identity.

111
00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:35.639
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: We have
to map inc over Identity,

112
00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:39.900
because inc doesn't take Identity,
it takes the value inside of it.

113
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.645
So now we'll get an Identity of 5.

114
00:07:45.895 --> 00:07:51.725
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: And if you want a real
nuts, we have an Identity of a list,

115
00:07:51.725 --> 00:07:56.831
and we wanna inc over that,
we've got to map map.

116
00:07:56.831 --> 00:07:58.420
Whoa-ho [LAUGH]!

117
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:09.759
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: For those of you
who aren't quite crying yet [LAUGH].

118
00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:12.392
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Is that the goal,
to get us to cry?

119
00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:16.234
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: That's what we're
here for, it's therapy, proto-therapy.

120
00:08:21.378 --> 00:08:23.200
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Raise your
hand if you do understand it.

121
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:26.954
We've got three-ish?

122
00:08:26.954 --> 00:08:28.014
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: Do you understand what,
again?

123
00:08:28.014 --> 00:08:32.463
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]
[INAUDIBLE] I got it working.

124
00:08:32.463 --> 00:08:35.700
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: [INAUDIBLE]
You got it working?

125
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.960
All right.
You got it working?

126
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.220
All right.
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: Who doesn't have it

127
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.594
working, I guess [INAUDIBLE].

128
00:08:39.594 --> 00:08:40.325
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Okay, yeah.

129
00:08:40.325 --> 00:08:41.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Which one, two?

130
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:42.997
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: Yeah,
let's talk about two.

131
00:08:42.997 --> 00:08:44.376
Do you guys want to do two together?

132
00:08:44.376 --> 00:08:45.529
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Sure.

133
00:08:45.529 --> 00:08:48.160
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: I don't want to take
up, these are supposed to take time.

134
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.187
I mean, you're supposed to play
with it and learn with it.

135
00:08:50.187 --> 00:08:50.978
I'm not like, hurry!

136
00:08:50.978 --> 00:08:53.414
[LAUGH] So if you don't to go over it,
tell me to hold on.

137
00:08:53.414 --> 00:08:54.891
I don't want to spoil it for you.

138
00:08:54.891 --> 00:08:55.920
How about you guys online?

139
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.000
Do you want me to,
Christian T wants me to go over it?

140
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.850
Or is he like, I know it?

141
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:04.470
Franco's good.

142
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.101
Looks like Myles is either drowning or
happy.

143
00:09:09.101 --> 00:09:14.276
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH] I think that's
supposed to be the rock fist maybe?

144
00:09:14.276 --> 00:09:20.168
[LAUGH] I never thought of it as a person
drowning, but I guess I could see it.

145
00:09:20.168 --> 00:09:23.654
&gt;&gt; Brian Lonsdorf: [LAUGH] It's that.

146
00:09:23.654 --> 00:09:25.523
I can't do that because
my pinkies are crooked.

147
00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:30.668
It's kind of embarrassing
I just documented that.

148
00:09:30.668 --> 00:09:32.090
Eternalized.

149
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.373
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: There's some stuck
on two and some good on two.

150
00:09:35.373 --> 00:09:35.943
Some stuck on three.

151
00:09:35.943 --> 00:09:37.573
And some stuck on three.
