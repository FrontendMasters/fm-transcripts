2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.532
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Well,
one example of Point Free.

3
00:00:07.532 --> 00:00:09.210
It takes it a sec for
the arrow keys to work.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.040
Is this has points.

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.540
The point, points mean arguments.

6
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.300
So I don't know why they
call it Point Free.

7
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.070
Maybe in the analogy of when I was saying,
functions viewed as nouns or

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.530
whatever just take points to points.

9
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.710
Maybe that's what it was.

10
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.460
Or maybe, it's something like,
hm, I don't know.

11
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.270
But you could think of,
Point Free means argument free.

12
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.737
Making a new function without having to
say function taking argument x, y, z.

13
00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:39.779
Or in this case,
taking the function error.

14
00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:47.648
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Let me find-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: All right, that's good.

15
00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:49.860
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: I mean
these are all Point Free.

16
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.570
This has infinity.

17
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.730
That's still,
I'd have to declare a function.

18
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.207
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,
it's really like the data that's going in,

19
00:00:59.207 --> 00:01:02.681
like that list is your point, you know?

20
00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:05.482
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: I was looking for,
there was another one with the error.

21
00:01:09.274 --> 00:01:11.413
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Oops.
No, no, no, don't look at that.

22
00:01:11.413 --> 00:01:13.100
Okay, here we go.

23
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.430
So this is that same
one without the point.

24
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.320
So it used to be on our call of
function that takes a point,

25
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.740
an argument named error and
it passes it in.

26
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.057
And instead of having to make
a function that takes a named argument,

27
00:01:28.057 --> 00:01:31.650
we can substitute that with
a composition which creates a function.

28
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.900
It just doesn't have a name.

29
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.620
And then the argument doesn't have a name.

30
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.670
We didn't mention the argument.

31
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.936
So if I, I think it's four.

32
00:01:39.936 --> 00:01:40.730
No, don't look at that again.

33
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.970
The slides are in an awkward order,
but we could code it in the JS bin.

34
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.310
But the point is, you know you're Point
Free when you're not saying function,

35
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.550
and then naming arguments and then using
those arguments inside the function.

36
00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.540
When you have a palette of tools,

37
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.470
like compose that you can put
other stuff together with.

38
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.700
So you make a couple basic functions
like deep down at the bedrock,

39
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.850
often in a library like and
you could just push them together and

40
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.860
not name it when you're doing it.

41
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.454
Or like in our average thing, when I said
fork, I didn't use any variables there.

42
00:02:19.454 --> 00:02:22.453
Let's see, go back.

43
00:02:22.453 --> 00:02:22.961
Let's look at that.

44
00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:24.010
This is totally Point Free.

45
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.020
So check it out, fork.

46
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.650
I define a thing called average.

47
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.520
And there are no variables.

48
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.007
I just say it's divide sum size fork.

49
00:02:34.007 --> 00:02:36.000
It's like snapping Legos together.

50
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.830
So that's how I'd just define Point Free,
and know when you're using it.

51
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.733
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What's confusing
about that is it looks like you're

52
00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:45.968
passing three arguments in four.

53
00:02:45.968 --> 00:02:49.460
I mean, ultimately you are, right?

54
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.239
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Passing,
really you are, yeah.

55
00:02:55.078 --> 00:02:56.949
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: I see.
Just the fact that we're also doing

56
00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:58.740
the currying on top of the composition?

57
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.320
Because four takes, four up here, but
we only gave it three down there.

58
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.659
Is that the confusing part?

59
00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:13.736
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: No, just, you say that if,
I understand what fork is doing.

60
00:03:13.736 --> 00:03:18.400
I don't know that I have enough depth
of understanding to articulate what I

61
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.742
found confusion on.

62
00:03:19.742 --> 00:03:21.398
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You're confused
about your confusion.

63
00:03:21.398 --> 00:03:23.358
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

64
00:03:23.358 --> 00:03:26.606
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Deep confusion.

65
00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:27.783
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Jessie W wants to clear,
yeah,

66
00:03:27.783 --> 00:03:28.865
I think I might-
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Yeah,

67
00:03:28.865 --> 00:03:30.040
fork isn't Point Free.

68
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.730
Average was built in a Point Free way.

69
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.115
Yeah, fork totally, here's the points.

70
00:03:34.115 --> 00:03:34.805
Lastly, FG.

71
00:03:34.805 --> 00:03:37.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I think that's
what I was trying to say.

72
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.197
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Yeah, yeah, if I was
saying fork was, I was being sloppy.

73
00:03:40.197 --> 00:03:40.830
Fork is not.

74
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.085
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
since you have another minute or two,

75
00:03:44.085 --> 00:03:49.851
it might be fun to just define,
just do two stupid composes to kinda show,

76
00:03:49.851 --> 00:03:55.245
like maybe do the phone number
thing where we the dashes for,

77
00:03:55.245 --> 00:04:00.210
you can make a replace
helper that's just curried.

78
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.260
Then replace the dashes for the slashes or

79
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.120
something, and-
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Let's see.

80
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I don't know,
maybe you shouldn't.

81
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.235
I don't know.
How much lecture do you have left?

82
00:04:10.235 --> 00:04:12.030
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: I got a couple slides.

83
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.300
Maybe would check out the slides and
see what kind of time we have and

84
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.080
how hungry we are and, yeah.
