00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
[MUSIC]
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: There's another question

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:14.060
on what the best way to go about
debugging these jsbin examples is.

3
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.020
Whether there's an easy way to
step through them or something.

4
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.910
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Jsbin has

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.210
been a little bit confusing, both in the
order of the listings And evaluates them.

6
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.850
So, if I drop a debugger
in these things I can try.

7
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.717
I can use JavaSvript debugger, I suppose.
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 2: You know what you

8
00:00:27.717 --> 00:00:28.627
should do though real quick?

9
00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:30.632
Is show them the log.

10
00:00:30.632 --> 00:00:32.575
You just drop that in
the middle of compose.

11
00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:34.588
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Sure, I need to define it.

12
00:00:34.588 --> 00:00:37.369
Some of the built in browser
objects can't be composed for

13
00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:41.354
some reason you try and treat them as real
objects ,they say illegal in locations.

14
00:00:41.354 --> 00:00:47.690
So we have to make a wrapper for
log equals function X.

15
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.760
We say console dialogue X.

16
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.810
And we say return X.

17
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.380
That way it can be composed to
be put in a composition chain.

18
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.270
The last thing it does is return whatever
was given to it so we can say in here.

19
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.450
It's kind of cool is
putting up a composition.

20
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.160
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: I think you might need

21
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.190
to run it again.
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Okay, in that case I better

22
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:17.457
copy this.
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: It worked,

23
00:01:17.457 --> 00:01:26.295
okay so there's that guy, no.
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Get

24
00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:30.326
title.
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: We put a log in there

25
00:01:30.326 --> 00:01:33.487
in between and head
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: And a dot on head.

26
00:01:33.487 --> 00:01:37.841
I sort out that head problem for

27
00:01:37.841 --> 00:01:42.120
the header.
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Yeah.

28
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.240
So now, it printed out everything sucks,
and it also printed out the object,

29
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.130
cuz it logged it on its way through.
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: One thing I use with

30
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.200
compose a lot,
is if you define that as first title

31
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.950
and don't call it right away.

32
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.658
You can compose that with something else,

33
00:02:06.658 --> 00:02:10.260
right?
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Help isn't working.

34
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.180
So, you're saying call this first title?
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: Yeah.

35
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.510
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: With the log and

36
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.590
the head.
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: So,

37
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.020
now we've got our first title,
and so, let's say,

38
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.650
first title, and
then is there there are a [INAUDIBLE]?

39
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.013
Its a good stream function.

40
00:02:38.013 --> 00:02:40.540
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: LIke uppercase?

41
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.245
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: Yeah, or

42
00:02:41.245 --> 00:02:44.760
something.
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: It's just.

43
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.417
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: Or how about,

44
00:02:46.417 --> 00:02:50.050
I wonder if head will work?
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Probably because

45
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.722
the head of the string is
possibly like the list.

46
00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:53.990
[LAUGH].

47
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.529
It's first letter.

48
00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:57.657
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: Yeah.

49
00:02:57.657 --> 00:03:02.200
First letter of the first title.
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: This one is called ahead

50
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:10.069
again.
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 2: An so

51
00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.541
[INAUDIBLE] underscore.
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Yeah,

52
00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:12.105
thanks.
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: So

53
00:03:12.105 --> 00:03:17.600
you see there though it's defined
that as first letter, right?

54
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.700
So the first title and
had his first letter.

55
00:03:23.918 --> 00:03:28.623
That's good.
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Oops.

56
00:03:28.623 --> 00:03:31.613
No, it doesn't and
then up fails to work out,

57
00:03:31.613 --> 00:03:39.435
it evaluates.
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: This

58
00:03:39.435 --> 00:03:42.816
is a bad example what I'm trying
to get at is you're building

59
00:03:42.816 --> 00:03:46.120
a grammar of functions that you're naming.

60
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.286
So I can compose first title and
maybe HTML out of that, make the headers.

61
00:03:53.286 --> 00:03:56.510
So I'm gonna grab the first title and
then I'm gonna compose that header and

62
00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.445
make that drop page.

63
00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:02.088
So it's drop page,
is just the composition of first title and

64
00:04:02.088 --> 00:04:04.700
make header or whatever make H1.

65
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.590
And the whole point of that is,

66
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.692
you end up with this English that
you're reading as your program.

67
00:04:12.692 --> 00:04:15.590
So, if you did it on the left
side it would be a lot clearer,

68
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.070
you'd be able to make your
grammar in a couple functions and

69
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.600
then use your grammar when
you actually run your app.

70
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.600
It's like you're programming with DSLs,
without knowing it.

71
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.020
Do your have questions about that?

72
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.730
I think it's awesome.
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: I think the biggest thing.

73
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.273
You also have gram dots and
looking at the arrays and stuff.

74
00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:37.684
But the real thing comes with taking
these functions and putting them all,

75
00:04:37.684 --> 00:04:40.497
the five or
six types of containers [INAUDIBLE].

76
00:04:40.497 --> 00:04:43.306
Which will become really cool and clear.
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: But,

77
00:04:43.306 --> 00:04:49.166
if you see if you see any my controllers
in a standard app, I'll bring one up.

78
00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:51.558
It's just this function, that function
they're all just specifically named.

79
00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:56.121
This is going to do this,
this going to do that, it's gonna do that.

80
00:04:56.121 --> 00:04:57.721
And then at the bottom,

81
00:04:57.721 --> 00:05:02.820
you've just got the composition of
maybe get from DB and put on page.

82
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.350
And ask the user what they want.

83
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.570
And it's like, I see it.

84
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.750
It just reads right to left.

85
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.297
I don't know much either but.

86
00:05:11.297 --> 00:05:16.050
[LAUGH]
I feel like it pushes you into

87
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.350
this really high level style where
you just writing what should happen.

88
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.030
And it keeps you on the same level
of abstraction pretty easily.

89
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.530
Cuz, you want your sentence to
be like do this, then that.

90
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.980
Okay, those are the three
things that make my page.

91
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.850
And then above it and
we'll see in the demo.

92
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.462
We'll see that pretty clearly.
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Someone once told me that

93
00:05:34.462 --> 00:05:37.990
at Pivotal Labs they use
test driven development

94
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.790
not just because they're
worried about the correctness.

95
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.440
But because it amplifies the pain you
feel by doing certain things wrong.

96
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.346
If you're doing unit test.

97
00:05:45.346 --> 00:05:49.980
So doing the style may amplify a way
that would be less beneficial.

98
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.800
Amplify the pain of doing it that way.
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: That's a good design

99
00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.820
technique for API design technique.

100
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.320
You can do TDD.
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Yeah, right.
