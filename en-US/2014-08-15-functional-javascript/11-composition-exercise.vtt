[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.264 --> 00:00:10.236
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: So here's our jsbin jevag.

3
00:00:10.236 --> 00:00:11.356
I'm gonna do some composing.

4
00:00:15.926 --> 00:00:24.950
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Yeah, good idea.

5
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.639
This time I'm gonna put it in
a different browser so it doesn't know

6
00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:30.668
me as the creator, so when I type things,
it doesn't change the original.

7
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:36.965
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Okay.

8
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.080
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Okay, so like the other
ones, we have this underscore.

9
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.950
It's actually Ramda,
it's coming from Ramda.

10
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.917
We created a little helper, which was get,

11
00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:50.665
like we were talking about before to pull
something off an object and it's curried.

12
00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:53.102
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: I think Ramda
has that built in actually.

13
00:00:53.102 --> 00:00:54.562
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: So- [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: So

14
00:00:54.562 --> 00:00:56.942
would you look at a Ramda [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

15
00:01:09.973 --> 00:01:11.248
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: So it starts with

16
00:01:11.248 --> 00:01:14.680
an example of how you could use compose.

17
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.140
In fact if I run it, we will be
able to see some output, I hope.

18
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.730
Refresh.

19
00:01:21.734 --> 00:01:23.480
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: There it is, cool.

20
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.290
So we could make this
function that given an array

21
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.530
of words because see we have
words in here, we split.

22
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.570
You actually give it a string,
looking at this, double checking.

23
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.690
You give it a string,
it takes out the words and

24
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.050
then it gives you the links of the words.

25
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.427
So maybe you want to make a histogram
of like how complicated words

26
00:01:46.427 --> 00:01:51.633
are in a grade level analyzer in
a word processor or something.

27
00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:53.140
So here's how you do it with compose.

28
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.740
I don't have to make it.

29
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.820
I just throw stuff together.

30
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.071
So that's an example then it's our turn
to take like something an API might have

31
00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:02.123
given us back about articles,
and authors, and stuff.

32
00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:11.362
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: And get a list of
the names inside of the articles.

33
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.740
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: So once again,
we have identity written here,

34
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.092
that just means change this out.

35
00:02:25.522 --> 00:02:26.656
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Get compose and map.

36
00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:45.873
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: [INAUDIBLE] Now
we don't have to do anything.

37
00:02:45.873 --> 00:02:47.947
I was like wait a second,
we should do this.

38
00:02:47.947 --> 00:02:50.897
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: I was telling [INAUDIBLE]

39
00:02:53.013 --> 00:03:01.332
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: [LAUGH]

40
00:03:01.332 --> 00:03:11.227
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

41
00:03:11.227 --> 00:03:12.704
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: I feel like if we

42
00:03:12.704 --> 00:03:15.431
are going to use the jsbin and

43
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:20.557
the refresh Ramda thing,
we should figure that out.

44
00:03:20.557 --> 00:03:24.129
It's weird, cuz it's supposed to
be synchronous in the script tag,

45
00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.710
it's just a HTML script tag,
we should be doing that first.

46
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.054
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Yeah we could add
an asynchronous loader thing,

47
00:03:30.054 --> 00:03:31.031
it gets it already.

48
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:36.099
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: Yeah, said timeout or

49
00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.574
set interval.

50
00:03:39.574 --> 00:03:42.164
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Yeah, I thought scripts
at the top blocked the page [CROSSTALK]

51
00:03:42.164 --> 00:03:43.444
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: Why don't we block

52
00:03:43.444 --> 00:03:44.166
the page?

53
00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:51.041
Jsbin doing some weird stuff..

54
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:53.049
Casper Milquetoast is my favorite author.

55
00:03:56.087 --> 00:03:56.980
&gt;&gt; Joe Nelson: Lessons for all of us.
