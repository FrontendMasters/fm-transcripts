1
00:00:00.257 --> 00:00:01.407
Okay, let's do it.

2
00:00:01.407 --> 00:00:05.177
So first thing first,
course overview, again,

3
00:00:05.177 --> 00:00:10.042
a little bit about myself and
why I spend so much time [LAUGH] on AI.

4
00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:15.907
It's funny because, I remember,
how did all this start?

5
00:00:15.907 --> 00:00:21.392
I think I remember, it was when some
version of Stable Diffusion came out,

6
00:00:21.392 --> 00:00:26.019
and if you know a little bit about me,
I'm really into gaming.

7
00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.681
So I have a crazy advanced gaming
setup at home with a nice GPU.

8
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:35.200
So I was well positioned to try some
of these technologies out at home.

9
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.846
And I was like, wow,
this is really powerful.

10
00:00:37.846 --> 00:00:43.568
So I really got into just trying to train
the best model on my daughter's face or

11
00:00:43.568 --> 00:00:48.873
a dog or my face and things like that,
and I just became obsessed with it.

12
00:00:48.873 --> 00:00:51.691
And from there it just spiraled into just,

13
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:55.780
I wanted to know more about this
technology and how it worked.

14
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.667
So I remember just trying to go back in,
cuz I'm not a traditional CS grad,

15
00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:02.629
I never even went to college,
I'm not a math person, but

16
00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.804
I wanted to understand it on that level,
and I still don't.

17
00:01:05.804 --> 00:01:09.641
[LAUGH] But I remember trying,
making the effort of just going back and

18
00:01:09.641 --> 00:01:13.280
trying to brush up on some collegiate
level math courses to really

19
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.017
understand what was going on.

20
00:01:15.017 --> 00:01:17.748
So, that's just how much
it consumed me early on,

21
00:01:17.748 --> 00:01:21.568
whereas I didn't feel the need to do
that with anything else in my life.

22
00:01:21.568 --> 00:01:23.727
But for this, I feel like I want it to.

23
00:01:23.727 --> 00:01:27.745
But in this course we're gonna be
covering some common use cases for

24
00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:30.081
using generative AI in your app today.

25
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:33.837
So some things you need to know to
really get the most out of this course.

26
00:01:33.837 --> 00:01:36.300
One, you really need to
know what Node.js is,

27
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.206
which also means you need
some JavaScript experience.

28
00:01:39.206 --> 00:01:42.889
So if you've never,
ever use Node.js before in your life,

29
00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:47.309
I think you should probably still be
fine as long as you know JavaScript.

30
00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:50.489
If you've ever built a React app or
anything like that on the front end,

31
00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:53.355
then you already know Node cuz you
need Node to build those apps.

32
00:01:53.355 --> 00:01:56.630
So you might be thinking, I've never
used Node before, but I've built React,

33
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.365
you do know Node.

34
00:01:57.365 --> 00:02:00.327
It's the same thing at this point.

35
00:02:00.327 --> 00:02:01.705
You don't need to be an expert.

36
00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:05.654
You don't need to know how to build APIs,
we're not making an API here.

37
00:02:05.654 --> 00:02:09.548
The second thing is you
need an OpenAI API account.

38
00:02:09.548 --> 00:02:12.381
This is different than a ChatGPT account.

39
00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:22.342
So if you go to platform.openai,
This is what I mean.

40
00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:24.307
So this is the account that you need.

41
00:02:24.307 --> 00:02:26.070
You need to make an account here.

42
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.644
I don't know why they have two
different accounts, one for GPT and

43
00:02:30.644 --> 00:02:31.957
one for their API.

44
00:02:31.957 --> 00:02:34.160
I mean, I get it, but it's annoying.

45
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.998
So it's not the same.

46
00:02:34.998 --> 00:02:38.777
So if you have GPT plus or whatever,
that is not the same as this.

47
00:02:38.777 --> 00:02:41.955
You need to have another one here.

48
00:02:41.955 --> 00:02:46.730
And then as far as what this might
cost for this course, almost nothing.

49
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.398
You shouldn't be spending less than, I
don't know, a penny today if you just ran

50
00:02:50.398 --> 00:02:53.866
this thing on a for loop or a while loop
forever, so you should be fine as cost.

51
00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:58.190
But I do think that they might
require a card on file so

52
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.924
that way they can charge you
later if you go crazy with it.

53
00:03:02.924 --> 00:03:06.053
So, yeah, you will need that.

54
00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:07.820
And then eventually you just
need to make an API key.

55
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.876
So you can just click here,
make an API key.

56
00:03:12.876 --> 00:03:16.029
And we'll go through that
set up when we use it.

57
00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:21.631
Those are the only two requirements
to get what we need from this course.

58
00:03:21.631 --> 00:03:23.161
Where am I at?

59
00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:27.444
I'm over here, there we go.

60
00:03:27.444 --> 00:03:28.739
Cool, any questions on that?

61
00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.311
And then as far as Node version,
let me see what version I'm on.

62
00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:39.139
I'm on 18.14, so at least that version.

63
00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:40.191
Any version beyond that.

64
00:03:40.191 --> 00:03:42.821
I'm sure any version of 18 is fine, but

65
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:46.590
just make sure you're at least
on that version and beyond.

66
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.819
Okay, so some of the things we're
gonna be covering in this course.

67
00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.847
I mean, I feel like I could
have talked about so much.

68
00:03:51.847 --> 00:03:55.605
Honestly, the most difficult part of this
course was trying to limit what I talk

69
00:03:55.605 --> 00:03:59.306
about, cuz I actually have enough stuff
on my mind to talk for, I don't know,

70
00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:01.068
at least three weeks worth of stuff.

71
00:04:01.068 --> 00:04:06.939
So trying to get it down to a few hours in
a day has been extremely difficult for me.

72
00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.839
But luckily, I used GPT to help me
figure that out, which is great.

73
00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:11.612
[LAUGH] It's really good at that.

74
00:04:11.612 --> 00:04:14.010
Because, yeah,
I just can't think through all that.

75
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.567
But anyway, some of the things we're gonna
be covering is we're gonna be building

76
00:04:16.567 --> 00:04:17.197
a chat experience.

77
00:04:17.197 --> 00:04:20.814
So if you've ever used GPT, we're
basically gonna build our own version

78
00:04:20.814 --> 00:04:22.871
of that, very simple, in the terminal.

79
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:26.741
So we'll just be writing a chat
experience in the terminal.

80
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:28.432
Like I said,
there is no front end element to this.

81
00:04:28.432 --> 00:04:32.463
We'll just be doing everything from
the command line just to keep it simple,

82
00:04:32.463 --> 00:04:33.403
keep it focused.

83
00:04:33.403 --> 00:04:36.526
We're gonna be covering things
like embeddings and vector stores.

84
00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:41.147
If that sounds foreign to you, after
today, you'll know exactly what this is.

85
00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:46.849
And this concept of embeddings and vector
stores is very common in the ML community,

86
00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.159
the AI community,
the data science community.

87
00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:55.153
But for us normal people, when I
learned about this, I was just like,

88
00:04:55.153 --> 00:04:56.349
this is insane.

89
00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.059
This makes so
much sense about how this works and

90
00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:01.573
it really simplified a lot of things for
me.

91
00:05:01.573 --> 00:05:04.781
We'll talk about semantic search and
just search in general.

92
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:08.325
We've all used search programs before,
we use Google, we do things like that.

93
00:05:08.325 --> 00:05:10.435
We're gonna talk about the difference
between those experiences and

94
00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:11.549
something called semantic search.

95
00:05:11.549 --> 00:05:14.059
And then we're gonna build our
own semantic search experience,

96
00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:15.206
which is pretty impressive.

97
00:05:15.206 --> 00:05:20.933
Document QA, which basically is just
the ability to ask questions and

98
00:05:20.933 --> 00:05:25.409
get back factual information
off of a knowledge base.

99
00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:29.936
So if your company has documentation, if
your company has, I don't know, some wiki,

100
00:05:29.936 --> 00:05:33.238
and you wanna be able to ask
questions based off that knowledge,

101
00:05:33.238 --> 00:05:34.418
that's what this is.

102
00:05:34.418 --> 00:05:39.538
It's gonna show you how to grab that data,
how to format it a certain way,

103
00:05:39.538 --> 00:05:44.165
how to present it, how to make
sure it's correct and factual, and

104
00:05:44.165 --> 00:05:48.235
then how to match that against
a human query, basically.

105
00:05:48.235 --> 00:05:49.848
So pretty cool.

106
00:05:49.848 --> 00:05:54.509
We're gonna talk about function calling,
which is kinda crazy, but

107
00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:59.251
basically gives the AI the ability
to call functions on other systems,

108
00:05:59.251 --> 00:06:02.666
which effectively upgrades
the AI to do anything.

109
00:06:02.666 --> 00:06:06.910
So if you had a function that says,
release nuclear warheads,

110
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.567
it could call that for you, [LAUGH] and
that would take over the world.

111
00:06:11.567 --> 00:06:15.723
So, yeah, basically, we'll talk
about that and how to upgrade that.

112
00:06:15.723 --> 00:06:17.411
And then throughout all of this,

113
00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:21.696
I'll always just be talking about all the
different scaling issues in production,

114
00:06:21.696 --> 00:06:25.823
things you have to look out for when you
try to deploy these things to production.

115
00:06:25.823 --> 00:06:30.925
Because what we're doing here versus what
you have to do in production is different.

116
00:06:30.925 --> 00:06:33.833
And I know that's true
with any type of app, but

117
00:06:33.833 --> 00:06:36.827
it's especially true
with these types of apps.

118
00:06:36.827 --> 00:06:41.705
The things you do locally are going to
be way different than the things you do

119
00:06:41.705 --> 00:06:42.797
in production.

120
00:06:42.797 --> 00:06:47.143
It's easy to actually build these things,
you're gonna find out.

121
00:06:47.143 --> 00:06:51.337
It's hard deploying these things [LAUGH]
because there's just so many gotchas and

122
00:06:51.337 --> 00:06:52.986
things you have to think about.

123
00:06:52.986 --> 00:06:57.580
So, outcomes, hopefully, by the end
of this course you've built, well,

124
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.265
you will have built some great examples
that you can reference going forward.

125
00:07:02.265 --> 00:07:05.445
I think on their own they're all
really good foundations, but

126
00:07:05.445 --> 00:07:09.048
they're still just gonna be scratching
the surface on what you can do.

127
00:07:09.048 --> 00:07:14.236
You can combine a lot of these
things to do some really cool stuff.

128
00:07:14.236 --> 00:07:15.878
You can expand on these things, but

129
00:07:15.878 --> 00:07:19.000
hopefully it's a really great
reference point for you to go back and

130
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.698
be like, yeah, how do I do semantic
search, or how do I use a vector store?

131
00:07:22.698 --> 00:07:25.405
You can use this as a reference
to go beyond that and

132
00:07:25.405 --> 00:07:27.672
really create some exceptional things.

133
00:07:27.672 --> 00:07:31.755
And I'll get into some examples of some
things you can create later on, yes?

134
00:07:31.755 --> 00:07:37.220
&gt;&gt; Are we doing OpenAI only or are we
gonna explore other models and services?

135
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.017
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so for this course
we're only going to use OpenAI,

136
00:07:41.017 --> 00:07:45.977
cuz there's a feature there that we
need that other models don't have, but

137
00:07:45.977 --> 00:07:48.786
I will be talking about
all the other ones.

138
00:07:48.786 --> 00:07:53.664
But just to keep it simple,
we'll only be using OpenAI today.

139
00:07:53.664 --> 00:07:56.578
And we won't be using their best model.

140
00:07:56.578 --> 00:07:57.822
I mean, you can if you want, but

141
00:07:57.822 --> 00:08:00.282
we won't be using their best one
cuz you don't really need it.

142
00:08:00.282 --> 00:08:04.173
So I picked the one that's the cheapest
and the easiest to use but

143
00:08:04.173 --> 00:08:08.075
also has the most features, and
that one is one that OpenAI has.

144
00:08:08.075 --> 00:08:10.831
But there are a lot of other
alternatives out there,

145
00:08:10.831 --> 00:08:14.591
depending on whether you want it to be
hosted or whether you wanna host it

146
00:08:14.591 --> 00:08:17.744
yourself, and then that depends
on what machine you have.

147
00:08:17.744 --> 00:08:19.691
There's so many things that go into it.
