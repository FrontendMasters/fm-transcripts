WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.060
Now, we need to write a function
that allows you to query it.

2
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.769
And here's where it gets a little
more advanced in the search.

3
00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:08.140
The search kinda was just like this.

4
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.369
Do a similaritySearch, done, we're done.

5
00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:13.012
Okay, well, you can see,
we got a lot more to do after that.

6
00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:18.171
[LAUGH] So let's do it.

7
00:00:18.171 --> 00:00:22.040
So we'll say query, like that.

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.740
We're gonna create a store.

9
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.502
So we'll say, this is gonna be async,

10
00:00:27.502 --> 00:00:32.293
and we're going to await loadStore,
like that.

11
00:00:32.293 --> 00:00:33.613
So now we have our store.

12
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.038
And then we're going to get
the results from the question.

13
00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:41.555
And we could probably just log that so
you can just kinda see.

14
00:00:41.555 --> 00:00:47.030
So const results = await.

15
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.590
And from here, we just wanna do
the same that we did before.

16
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.141
similaritySearch, pass in the question,
and then I'll say 2 docs.

17
00:00:54.141 --> 00:01:01.230
So I'll say store.similaritySearch.

18
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.931
Passing the question
that we created above,

19
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:07.280
that comes in from the command line or
defaults to high.

20
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.040
And I'll just say 2, right?

21
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.153
So let's log that.

22
00:01:11.153 --> 00:01:15.952
So I'm gonna log the results here,
and then I also want to log,

23
00:01:15.952 --> 00:01:18.770
let's log just one of these chunks.

24
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.415
It's gonna be too crazy if I log them all.

25
00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:27.760
So I'll just say videoDocs [0],
and then pdfDocs [0].

26
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.944
And that way, you just kinda
see what a vector looks like,

27
00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:31.114
what an embedding looks like.

28
00:01:31.114 --> 00:01:32.324
I want you to see that.

29
00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:34.744
I think it'll make sense
if you can see it.

30
00:01:34.744 --> 00:01:40.240
And then I'm just gonna run query here,
like this, okay?

31
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.890
If we didn't break anything,
we should at least see some logs.

32
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.320
So let's try that out.

33
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.608
So now if I say no qa, and

34
00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:55.210
then I pass in what is the xbox warranty?

35
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.248
It's not gonna answer it, right?

36
00:01:58.248 --> 00:01:59.408
Because we didn't do that part.

37
00:01:59.408 --> 00:02:00.795
I'm just trying to see the logs.

38
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.230
Okay, here we go.

39
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.340
Here are the logs.

40
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.153
So if I go and look, here is, and again,

41
00:02:11.153 --> 00:02:15.755
this has nothing to do with
the question that I ask

42
00:02:15.755 --> 00:02:20.710
because this log is from
when I indexed all the data.

43
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.342
So it went to YouTube, it got
the transcripts from that video, and

44
00:02:25.342 --> 00:02:26.430
what did I log?

45
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.270
I log chunk what?

46
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.383
Chunk, I log the first
chunk from the video,

47
00:02:32.383 --> 00:02:36.430
so basically the first thing that the
video picks up, that's what I'm logging.

48
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.300
So you can see that this
is what a chunk looks like.

49
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.001
It's not the full thing.

50
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:42.989
You can see why I was like, yeah,

51
00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.959
the punctuation on the transcript is not
proper English, cuz it's a transcript,

52
00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.370
so it's hard to split on a period or
something like that.

53
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.190
So you're basically just guessing.

54
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.569
So this is the 2,500 tokens
that I said a chunk must be.

55
00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.029
And you can see it split in
the middle of someone talking, right?

56
00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:04.823
And here's the metadata
that I told it to add.

57
00:03:04.823 --> 00:03:09.864
I said, add all the metadata to the video,
so it did, title, all that stuff.

58
00:03:09.864 --> 00:03:15.463
And it'll keep doing that forever and
ever, but I only logged the first one.

59
00:03:15.463 --> 00:03:22.140
And then it indexed the PDF and I logged
the, I logged the first one there as well.

60
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.518
So this is the first thing that shows
up in the PDF, is a Product and

61
00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:26.820
Regulatory Guide.

62
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.846
So if I open that PDF,

63
00:03:27.846 --> 00:03:31.510
I'm imagining that's what I
would see when I first open it.

64
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.000
Yeah, that's literally the first
thing on the PDF that shows up.

65
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.690
So that's why that's the first chunk,
right?

66
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.760
Cool, yeah, and that's that.

67
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.209
So that's why that's there.

68
00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.976
And then I closed it before it showed
me the results of the search, so

69
00:03:44.976 --> 00:03:49.552
it didn't show me the results, but
we'll keep going and we'll see everything.

70
00:03:49.552 --> 00:03:52.051
Okay, any questions on that so far?

71
00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:55.641
It's actually like,
it makes sense why it does that.

72
00:03:55.641 --> 00:03:59.636
It's quite predictable
in how it will work.

73
00:03:59.636 --> 00:04:02.877
And it almost makes it
feel like it's not smart.

74
00:04:02.877 --> 00:04:05.090
And this is why I think
sometimes when people are like,

75
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.410
AI is gonna take over the world,
I'm like, have you used it?

76
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.059
This thing needs a lot of hand-holding and
a lot of teaching, so

77
00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:14.911
I don't know, I'm not for there yet.

78
00:04:14.911 --> 00:04:17.890
Okay, so we got that.

79
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.810
And now we need to actually
send this up to GPT.

80
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.012
So let's do that.

81
00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:23.218
And we're gonna do a few
different things here.

82
00:04:23.218 --> 00:04:29.789
So let's say results, and this is awaits.

83
00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.399
Oops, sorry, we have results,
let's say response.

84
00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:39.716
Equals openai.chat.completions.create.

85
00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:41.576
You should know this part by now.

86
00:04:41.576 --> 00:04:43.230
We're gonna pass in our model.

87
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.013
I'm just gonna use, you know what,
I'm gonna splurge a little bit,

88
00:04:48.013 --> 00:04:49.321
go a little crazy.

89
00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:51.064
I'm gonna do gpt-4-32k.

90
00:04:51.064 --> 00:04:53.153
I know, big flex.

91
00:04:53.153 --> 00:04:55.373
Relax, no big deal.

92
00:04:55.373 --> 00:04:57.065
&gt;&gt; That API key is gonna stop working.

93
00:04:57.065 --> 00:04:58.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no big deal, no big deal.

94
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.494
If you're using my key,
feel free, go ahead.

95
00:05:00.494 --> 00:05:02.560
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; It's on me.

96
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.020
[LAUGH] Go ahead.

97
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.594
So yeah, you can use any model you want.

98
00:05:05.594 --> 00:05:06.929
I'm just doing this.

99
00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:10.112
But yeah, if there's one that you have
access to that has a bigger context,

100
00:05:10.112 --> 00:05:12.090
use that one, use a 16k.

101
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.860
I think the other ones are still fine,
they're within token limit.

102
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.711
Just use a bigger one just in case,
otherwise you might run into a problem,

103
00:05:19.711 --> 00:05:20.670
I don't know.

104
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.009
Depends on the query you ask,
I don't know.

105
00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:23.970
So there we go.

106
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.230
We got that.

107
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.870
The other thing here is temperature.

108
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.518
I want this thing to be factual,
so I'm gonna put it at 0.

109
00:05:29.518 --> 00:05:30.927
I don't want you getting creative.

110
00:05:30.927 --> 00:05:32.788
I don't want you flying by
the seat of your pants.

111
00:05:32.788 --> 00:05:37.090
I want you to be for real with me,
don't BS me, keep it real.

112
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.428
So I'm gonna say 0.

113
00:05:38.428 --> 00:05:40.930
I don't need the creative
person right now, right?

114
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.310
I need you to be real with me.

115
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.800
Stop the silliness.

116
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.220
That's what this is saying, okay?

117
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.960
You probably always wanna do this for
a document QA, almost always, just 0.

118
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.540
And then messages,
you know how this works.

119
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.034
Let's make a system message here,

120
00:05:59.034 --> 00:06:03.233
we'll say role: 'system', content.

121
00:06:03.233 --> 00:06:05.198
And this is where it gets interesting.

122
00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.227
Well, not this part.

123
00:06:06.227 --> 00:06:09.138
This was actually pretty easy,
just type that.

124
00:06:09.138 --> 00:06:10.313
And you can put whatever you want here.

125
00:06:10.313 --> 00:06:13.137
I'm just gonna do the same thing I always
do, you are a helpful AI assistant.

126
00:06:13.137 --> 00:06:15.657
Answer questions to your best ability.

127
00:06:15.657 --> 00:06:18.568
Easy, okay?

128
00:06:18.568 --> 00:06:23.513
From there, we want to type
in the user prompt here, and

129
00:06:23.513 --> 00:06:27.420
this is where we kinda
have to make a prompt.

130
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.509
So I'll walk you through
this a little bit.

131
00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:30.799
So I'm gonna add another message.

132
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.430
Its role is gonna be user,
as in this is what the user is saying.

133
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.781
And its content is gonna be,
I'm just gonna use backticks here.

134
00:06:39.781 --> 00:06:43.360
We have to guide this thing a little bit.

135
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.732
So basically,
what I have here is I'm saying, hey,

136
00:06:45.732 --> 00:06:48.950
answer the following question
using the provided context.

137
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.484
If you cannot answer the question with
a context, don't lie and make up stuff.

138
00:06:53.484 --> 00:06:56.002
Just say you need more context, right?

139
00:06:56.002 --> 00:06:57.991
I'm trying to guide it, like don't.

140
00:06:57.991 --> 00:06:59.842
I know I'll put you in temperature 0 but

141
00:06:59.842 --> 00:07:01.812
just in case if you
wanna get crazy with me.

142
00:07:01.812 --> 00:07:04.685
Just cuz you're a people pleaser,
you wanna make me happy and

143
00:07:04.685 --> 00:07:06.240
tell me things that I wanna know.

144
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.570
No, no, I want you to just be like,
look, I need more context.

145
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.515
I don't know how to answer this, right?

146
00:07:11.515 --> 00:07:13.134
So that's what I'm gonna put here.

147
00:07:13.134 --> 00:07:15.629
I'm actually just gonna copy that,
I don't wanna write it again.

148
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.200
Okay, and then from here,
we're gonna add the context.

149
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.575
And in this case,

150
00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:28.632
the context is whatever the results
were from the similaritySearch, right?

151
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.579
That's gonna be the context.

152
00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:33.246
Well, I guess we should
put the question first.

153
00:07:33.246 --> 00:07:34.410
Let's do question.

154
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.210
So we'll say, the question is literally
the same question that we used on

155
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.540
the similaritySearch.

156
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.180
So that's the thing about document QA.

157
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.494
You use the question first
on the similaritySearch

158
00:07:44.494 --> 00:07:46.882
to get back the matching chunks, and

159
00:07:46.882 --> 00:07:52.900
then you use the question again on the
chat completion to answer the question.

160
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.662
So you have to use it twice.

161
00:07:54.662 --> 00:07:55.470
Does that make sense?

162
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.981
We needed the question the first time to
figure out what chunks are semantically

163
00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:03.950
closest to it, and now we need
the question the second time to ask GPT to

164
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.403
answer it with these given chunks, okay?

165
00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:08.191
Okay, so
we gotta put the question back in here.

166
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.170
And then we have context.

167
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:17.862
And I don't think there's a right way to
do this, but the way that I ended up doing

168
00:08:17.862 --> 00:08:22.293
it was I just mapped over all the content
and I just put in their pageContent.

169
00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:25.339
Or I mapped over all the context and
I put in their pageContent and

170
00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:26.870
I just joined them on a new line.

171
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.240
There's really no right or
wrong way to do it.

172
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.400
I just don't wanna give
it an array of objects.

173
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.567
I think that all those extra characters
in there will mess it up, I think.

174
00:08:36.567 --> 00:08:39.912
So I'm just like, giving it
unstructured text is a lot better than,

175
00:08:39.912 --> 00:08:42.980
here's an array of objects and
brackets and things like that.

176
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.162
It's just extra stuff.

177
00:08:44.162 --> 00:08:48.866
Not only does it make my call more
expensive, cuz there's more tokens, but

178
00:08:48.866 --> 00:08:53.220
now the AI has to learn to ignore those
things and just look at the data.

179
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.204
So I'm just making it easy for
it by giving it just the raw text.

180
00:08:56.204 --> 00:08:58.074
So that's what I did here.

181
00:08:58.074 --> 00:08:59.164
So I'll just do the same thing.

182
00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:01.210
I'll say results.map.

183
00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:06.427
I'll take a result and
I'll say result.pageContent like this.

184
00:09:06.427 --> 00:09:09.966
And then I'll just join all
these things on a new line.
