1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.761
Yes.

2
00:00:00.761 --> 00:00:04.072
&gt;&gt; Does it mostly base that
decision on what function to run,

3
00:00:04.072 --> 00:00:07.872
if any, based on whatever description
you give to that function?

4
00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:12.253
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is when to run the function.

5
00:00:12.253 --> 00:00:17.094
This is the description on how
to calculate this parameter.

6
00:00:20.552 --> 00:00:23.245
So yeah, there's nothing
stopping you from making that.

7
00:00:23.245 --> 00:00:26.433
Again, it's like,
ask a friend, [LAUGH] right?

8
00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:31.824
And then you can just put something in
here as a description as a function like,

9
00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:34.914
use this function if
this question feels hard.

10
00:00:34.914 --> 00:00:38.427
If you need help asking this question,
run this function, and

11
00:00:38.427 --> 00:00:41.618
then it'll ask another AI,
right, or versus DALL.E.

12
00:00:41.618 --> 00:00:43.821
DALL.E generates images, right?

13
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:46.354
ChatGPT just got released
with DALL.E support.

14
00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:47.333
How do you think they did it?

15
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:52.145
They did this,
they just made a function here that says,

16
00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:57.043
generateImage, and
it takes in a prompt, Right,

17
00:00:57.043 --> 00:01:00.761
and it just calls the DALL.E API,
which, I mean, we can try it.

18
00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:01.399
Let's see.

19
00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:07.321
Let's see what happens.

20
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:11.599
We can say, result = await

21
00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:17.182
openai.images.generate().

22
00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:17.980
What does this take?

23
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.744
Does this take a prompt?

24
00:01:19.744 --> 00:01:20.879
I don't even know what this thing takes.

25
00:01:23.114 --> 00:01:28.614
Body, I think it takes that thing.

26
00:01:28.614 --> 00:01:29.919
Yeah, okay, so you can do that.

27
00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:33.253
I don't know what the result is gonna be,
let's just log it.

28
00:01:34.735 --> 00:01:37.639
Cool, and I'll just respond
back with nothing for now.

29
00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:38.669
So then I could do that, right?

30
00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:41.566
I can take this whole object, ooh,

31
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:45.631
I can take this whole object here,
make a new one.

32
00:01:48.105 --> 00:01:50.679
Okay, it didn't copy the way
that I thought it was going to,

33
00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.000
I'll just do the whole thing.

34
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.367
And, I put it in the wrong place,
didn't I?

35
00:02:01.742 --> 00:02:02.650
&gt;&gt; One more bracket down.

36
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.279
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

37
00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:05.636
There we go.

38
00:02:05.636 --> 00:02:09.565
So I can call this createImage.

39
00:02:09.565 --> 00:02:12.138
And I'll just give this the same name too,
or generateImage.

40
00:02:12.138 --> 00:02:14.460
Okay, let's do that.

41
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.618
generateImage, and this is a,

42
00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:24.585
Create or generate image based

43
00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:28.987
on a description, right?

44
00:02:28.987 --> 00:02:33.944
And then I'll take a prompt,
it's a string.

45
00:02:33.944 --> 00:02:40.388
And I want the description
of the image to generate,

46
00:02:40.388 --> 00:02:46.109
and then this needs to be prompt,
there we go.

47
00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.030
So I don't know, this might work,
[LAUGH] let's see.

48
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.192
So then now I can go down here and
I can say,

49
00:02:55.486 --> 00:03:00.574
I want an image, or create me

50
00:03:00.574 --> 00:03:07.575
an image of a cat flying through space.

51
00:03:11.605 --> 00:03:12.474
See what happens.

52
00:03:18.487 --> 00:03:19.482
I don't know what that is.

53
00:03:19.482 --> 00:03:21.625
It looks like it just tried
to create some markdown.

54
00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:22.473
There it is.

55
00:03:22.473 --> 00:03:23.446
It did it.

56
00:03:23.446 --> 00:03:27.648
Damn, [LAUGH] I was not expecting that.

57
00:03:27.648 --> 00:03:29.182
Let's go see it.

58
00:03:29.182 --> 00:03:33.159
Wow, [LAUGH] it's kinda crazy.

59
00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.236
It's just responded back with markdown,

60
00:03:35.236 --> 00:03:38.472
because obviously I didn't respond
back with the image, right?

61
00:03:38.472 --> 00:03:40.066
I just put an empty string here.

62
00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:42.795
So it's like, I don't know how to
respond back, but we logged it, right?

63
00:03:42.795 --> 00:03:46.597
So, Card?

64
00:03:46.597 --> 00:03:51.734
&gt;&gt; So it's generating that prompt, which
is just text that it's in, passing to it?

65
00:03:51.734 --> 00:03:54.835
So is it pulling the exact
same prompt that you gave or

66
00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:59.094
is it creating its own prompt based on-
&gt;&gt; That's a good question, let's see.

67
00:03:59.094 --> 00:04:00.189
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Let's check it out.

68
00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:02.993
So let's look at the prompt
that it sent in.

69
00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:06.757
I don't know, I put temperature on 0, so
I'm guessing it's the exact same thing.

70
00:04:06.757 --> 00:04:09.296
If I change the temperature,
I bet it'll get crazier.

71
00:04:09.296 --> 00:04:11.272
So let's log the prompt.

72
00:04:11.272 --> 00:04:13.357
And actually, let me send back the result.

73
00:04:13.357 --> 00:04:14.284
What was the result?

74
00:04:14.284 --> 00:04:18.447
It was an object with
the data in an array.

75
00:04:18.447 --> 00:04:21.793
Let's send that back, so
that way you can respond back with it.

76
00:04:21.793 --> 00:04:30.234
So result.data[0].url.

77
00:04:30.234 --> 00:04:31.426
There we go.

78
00:04:31.426 --> 00:04:32.254
Let's try that.

79
00:04:32.254 --> 00:04:36.646
So, same thing,
image of a cat flying through space.

80
00:04:44.747 --> 00:04:48.332
Yeah, the prompt was a cat
flying through space.

81
00:04:48.332 --> 00:04:53.947
And yeah, here's what I got back.

82
00:04:53.947 --> 00:04:55.299
Yeah, pretty crazy,

83
00:04:55.299 --> 00:05:00.009
the reason why it's not responding back
here is because JavaScript, right?

84
00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.901
I'm trying to do an async.

85
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:03.638
I'm trying to do an await in a while loop.

86
00:05:03.638 --> 00:05:06.025
So it's not waiting for that to finish.

87
00:05:06.025 --> 00:05:12.876
So the completion response finishes before
the API call to the image finishes.

88
00:05:12.876 --> 00:05:13.675
So there's a race condition.

89
00:05:13.675 --> 00:05:16.787
So yeah,
it's just like not doing it, right?

90
00:05:16.787 --> 00:05:20.787
So yeah, that's pretty crazy.

91
00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:22.415
[LAUGH] Yeah.

92
00:05:22.415 --> 00:05:24.769
&gt;&gt; This is more of a question
from the calculate example.

93
00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:29.617
But does the model reprocess
the output of the function call?

94
00:05:29.617 --> 00:05:36.916
For example, will it return whatever
calculate said without double-checking?

95
00:05:36.916 --> 00:05:40.112
&gt;&gt; Yes, it will return.

96
00:05:40.112 --> 00:05:42.203
It won't do anything
you don't ask it to do.

97
00:05:42.203 --> 00:05:46.569
So if you didn't ask it to check it,
it won't.

98
00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:51.759
What that person is describing is more of
what an agent is, where it can think for

99
00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.786
itself, where it can reason about
the result of a function and

100
00:05:55.786 --> 00:05:58.518
determine if the result was good enough.

101
00:05:58.518 --> 00:06:01.731
And if not, it will respond back with,
no, I gotta call another function,

102
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:02.748
that didn't work out.

103
00:06:02.748 --> 00:06:05.335
Or in this case,
it's not thinking about it.

104
00:06:05.335 --> 00:06:09.808
It just assumes whatever the result
of the function is the answer.

105
00:06:09.808 --> 00:06:12.197
But you could write some
prompt engineering like, hey,

106
00:06:12.197 --> 00:06:15.331
if the results of the functions that
you might use come back is not helpful,

107
00:06:15.331 --> 00:06:17.206
then I need you to say
they're not helpful.

108
00:06:17.206 --> 00:06:21.655
Or could you ask it again
with a different parameter?

109
00:06:21.655 --> 00:06:27.263
The possibilities are endless of
how you could do it, so yeah, yeah?

110
00:06:27.263 --> 00:06:32.458
&gt;&gt; Can the AI read back the elevated
privileges that's needed on a database or

111
00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:33.867
active directory?

112
00:06:33.867 --> 00:06:41.755
For example, Well,

113
00:06:41.755 --> 00:06:47.341
can it find out the permissions and
return each item to the prompt or

114
00:06:47.341 --> 00:06:53.649
are permissions are loaded by default and
it can tell you what it has so far?

115
00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:56.519
&gt;&gt; The AI can do whatever your
function allows it to do.

116
00:06:56.519 --> 00:07:01.512
So if you have a function that does all
that and exposes that and you gave the AI

117
00:07:01.512 --> 00:07:06.754
the ability to call that function, then
yes, it can and probably will do that.

118
00:07:06.754 --> 00:07:11.637
[LAUGH] So
don't write a function that can do that.

119
00:07:11.637 --> 00:07:15.225
I mean, I've seen people add
authentication to prompts.

120
00:07:15.225 --> 00:07:16.027
It's insane.

121
00:07:16.027 --> 00:07:21.654
So it's like, yeah, we're gonna teach
the AI about these functions it can run.

122
00:07:21.654 --> 00:07:27.707
But one of the arguments that the function
must have is a password, or a secret, or

123
00:07:27.707 --> 00:07:33.532
something like that that you have to add
to your prompt in order for this to run.

124
00:07:33.532 --> 00:07:38.542
So therefore, only people with this
token can run this prompt that then

125
00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:43.820
runs this function, and the function,
you'll get a token here, right?

126
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.575
You'll get a token, and then you'll check
that token to see if it's valid, and

127
00:07:47.575 --> 00:07:49.688
only then will you run the function,
right?

128
00:07:49.688 --> 00:07:54.730
So I've seen [LAUGH] people do that,
I'm like, this is kinda insane, but, yeah.

129
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:59.041
&gt;&gt; Maybe they should authenticate
out of band of the AI call.

130
00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:01.233
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's probably, yeah, exactly,

131
00:08:01.233 --> 00:08:04.686
don't show this view to someone
who's not authenticated, right?

132
00:08:04.686 --> 00:08:06.850
But yeah, I've seen people do that, or

133
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.619
they'll add the authentication
here to the system message, right?

134
00:08:10.619 --> 00:08:13.782
It's like, here's the authentication for
the logged person, they need this for

135
00:08:13.782 --> 00:08:15.424
function calling or something like that.

136
00:08:15.424 --> 00:08:18.048
I've seen people do that.

137
00:08:18.048 --> 00:08:19.830
I don't know, it's crazy.

138
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.778
It's a crazy world we're living in,
I'll say that.
