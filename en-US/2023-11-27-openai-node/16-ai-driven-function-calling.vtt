1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.559
So far,
we've talked about some pretty cool stuff.

2
00:00:02.559 --> 00:00:06.231
A lot of things building
off of previous things, QA,

3
00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:09.741
piggybacking off of semantic,
semantic search,

4
00:00:09.741 --> 00:00:14.576
piggybacking off of a little bit of
the chat stuff that we did earlier.

5
00:00:14.576 --> 00:00:16.707
I mean, you could actually combine
all these things together.

6
00:00:16.707 --> 00:00:20.183
You could combine the semantic
search abilities and

7
00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:23.501
the Document QA abilities
with a chat-ability.

8
00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:28.831
So you have a chat interface in which the
AI is equipped with the right abilities

9
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:34.757
to, I don't know, talk about different
datasets and search on different datasets.

10
00:00:34.757 --> 00:00:38.457
The problem is trying to teach
the AI the instructions or

11
00:00:38.457 --> 00:00:41.605
convince the AI that it
can do these things, and

12
00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:45.795
then teaching it when to do those
things is quite complicated.

13
00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:49.296
You'd have to be really clever
with your prompt engineering.

14
00:00:49.296 --> 00:00:52.731
And up until recently
that's what people did.

15
00:00:52.731 --> 00:00:58.484
LangChain actually has,
you can describe different tools,

16
00:00:58.484 --> 00:01:04.351
is what they call them or
at least is what they used to call them.

17
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:07.147
Yeah, they have these tools like this.

18
00:01:07.147 --> 00:01:11.605
A tool is basically like you teaching
the AI that it can do something on another

19
00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:12.163
system.

20
00:01:12.163 --> 00:01:13.163
They called them tools.

21
00:01:13.163 --> 00:01:16.169
And it was basically like some
clever prompt engineering, like,

22
00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:18.324
hey, AI,
here's some things that you can do.

23
00:01:18.324 --> 00:01:21.395
Here's when you need to use each thing,
and

24
00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:25.303
here's what each thing needs
from you in order to work.

25
00:01:25.303 --> 00:01:27.848
And that was cool, but
it was never deterministic, and

26
00:01:27.848 --> 00:01:30.898
it never really worked well, but
when it worked, it was magical.

27
00:01:30.898 --> 00:01:38.964
Since then, GPT has added
something called function calling.

28
00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:45.801
Function calling, which is like that,
but ltrained into the platform.

29
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:48.641
So function calling is really cool.

30
00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:54.083
It basically allows you to upgrade GPT or
any other models that are trained

31
00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:59.349
on something like this to,
instead of responding back with a message,

32
00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:02.802
GPT will respond back
with a request from you.

33
00:02:02.802 --> 00:02:04.256
It'll say, hey, I need you.

34
00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:08.036
You told me I could run these functions,
and these functions do x, y, and z.

35
00:02:08.036 --> 00:02:11.072
Based off the query,
the question you gave me, or

36
00:02:11.072 --> 00:02:15.792
the prompt that you gave me, I need to
run this function that you said I can do.

37
00:02:15.792 --> 00:02:18.545
And here are the arguments to
the function that you said you need.

38
00:02:18.545 --> 00:02:21.832
So can you please go run that function or
whatever system you have, and

39
00:02:21.832 --> 00:02:23.684
then report back to me with the answer?

40
00:02:23.684 --> 00:02:27.835
Then I will then run your prompts, right?

41
00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:32.598
So it itself won't run the function,
is asking you to run a function,

42
00:02:32.598 --> 00:02:36.877
but what it does is it chooses
the right function to run based off

43
00:02:36.877 --> 00:02:40.211
the context that it gives you or
that you give it.

44
00:02:40.211 --> 00:02:45.523
So kinda complicated, but
it's actually quite simple in practice.

45
00:02:45.523 --> 00:02:46.287
So we'll talk about that a little bit.

46
00:02:46.287 --> 00:02:50.638
But I think you already have some
notes on it, so let's go to that.

47
00:02:50.638 --> 00:02:52.053
So why do we need this?

48
00:02:52.053 --> 00:02:55.655
Well, if you didn't know this,
LLMs are trained at a certain date and

49
00:02:55.655 --> 00:02:57.863
then from there, they never learn again.

50
00:02:57.863 --> 00:03:00.400
You might think that these LLMs, like GPT,

51
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.358
are connected to the Internet,
but they're not.

52
00:03:03.358 --> 00:03:08.023
If I ask GPT right now, what is
the score of last night's game, right?

53
00:03:10.447 --> 00:03:17.209
What is the score of last
night's football game?

54
00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.857
I don't know what this thing is gonna say.

55
00:03:21.732 --> 00:03:24.843
Yeah, I don't have real time information
to find out the score last weekend.

56
00:03:24.843 --> 00:03:26.977
You can check it just doesn't know, right?

57
00:03:26.977 --> 00:03:30.531
It got trained after a certain that
date in which it was released, and

58
00:03:30.531 --> 00:03:32.013
the training was finished.

59
00:03:32.013 --> 00:03:34.128
That's all it knows,
it doesn't know anything else.

60
00:03:34.128 --> 00:03:41.870
So I might be able to ask it
a score about a game in 2005 or

61
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.406
who won the 2005 NBA finals, right?

62
00:03:47.406 --> 00:03:48.881
I might be able to do that.

63
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:51.453
If it's not hallucinating,
I might be able to.

64
00:03:51.453 --> 00:03:52.600
Yeah, actually I think that's right.

65
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.116
So, like, it knows that because it
was trained after that date, so

66
00:03:56.116 --> 00:03:59.584
it found that information online
somewhere, so it's accurate.

67
00:03:59.584 --> 00:04:02.758
So, yeah, what do you, just wait
to the next update to come out for

68
00:04:02.758 --> 00:04:05.393
the new model to see if you
can get like today's score?

69
00:04:05.393 --> 00:04:06.542
No, obviously you don't.

70
00:04:06.542 --> 00:04:11.024
So you have to like upgrade the model
to be able to interact with the outside

71
00:04:11.024 --> 00:04:11.541
world.

72
00:04:11.541 --> 00:04:17.241
So that's one reason why we need
something like function calling,

73
00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:21.250
and basically,
I talked a little bit about it.

74
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.955
It's basically just you telling the AI,
here are all the things you can do.

75
00:04:25.955 --> 00:04:26.978
Here's what they do.

76
00:04:26.978 --> 00:04:29.636
Here's how to know if you need them.

77
00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:32.097
And then the AI is like, cool,
I'll tell you when I need to run them.

78
00:04:32.097 --> 00:04:33.139
So go run them for me.

79
00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.683
So it's like literally the AI
asking you to do some work,

80
00:04:35.683 --> 00:04:37.599
which is kinda crazy
if you think about it.

81
00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:38.820
But it works very, very well.

82
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.132
So, obviously, the benefits you get
is you get up-to-date responses.

83
00:04:42.132 --> 00:04:45.125
So, for instance,
we just made that semantic search.

84
00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:46.857
We just made that Document QA.

85
00:04:46.857 --> 00:04:51.771
Well, if you told the AI that it can do
those things, and when it should do those

86
00:04:51.771 --> 00:04:56.315
things, whenever it got a prompt that
it felt like it couldn't answer,

87
00:04:56.315 --> 00:05:00.354
it can look to see like,
what are the functions I have access to?

88
00:05:00.354 --> 00:05:03.324
Does any one of these functions
help me answer this question?

89
00:05:03.324 --> 00:05:07.058
Yeah, they told me about a function that
I can use if I need to query a YouTube

90
00:05:07.058 --> 00:05:10.518
video, and a prompt that it gave me
was asking about a YouTube video.

91
00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:12.843
So I guess I'll respond back with, hey,

92
00:05:12.843 --> 00:05:16.575
can you run that YouTube video
function that you said that I can do?

93
00:05:16.575 --> 00:05:18.216
And here are the arguments
that you said you need.

94
00:05:18.216 --> 00:05:19.298
Here they are.

95
00:05:19.298 --> 00:05:24.176
And then when you're done processing that
function, can you pass it back to me,

96
00:05:24.176 --> 00:05:27.636
so I can answer this prompt
that you originally asked me?

97
00:05:27.636 --> 00:05:29.854
And that's basically
what function calling is.

98
00:05:29.854 --> 00:05:32.787
It's really powerful how it works.

99
00:05:32.787 --> 00:05:36.693
And then if you really think about that,
if you put that on a loop to where it

100
00:05:36.693 --> 00:05:41.372
takes in that answer, and then it thinks
some more and then be like, you know what?

101
00:05:41.372 --> 00:05:43.110
I need you to go run
this additional function.

102
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.295
I need some more information.

103
00:05:44.295 --> 00:05:47.641
And then it takes that, and it's like,
you know what, can you go to Google and

104
00:05:47.641 --> 00:05:48.264
look this up?

105
00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:49.180
I need that too.

106
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.396
And then it just keeps doing that.

107
00:05:50.396 --> 00:05:51.978
And it says like, all right,
I got everything I need.

108
00:05:51.978 --> 00:05:52.938
Here's your answer.

109
00:05:52.938 --> 00:05:55.935
It's really powerful, and
that's kinda what an agent is.

110
00:05:55.935 --> 00:05:57.904
It kinda does things like that.

111
00:05:57.904 --> 00:06:00.854
But there are a lot of challenges,

112
00:06:00.854 --> 00:06:06.567
there's a lot of complexity around
handling the function calls.

113
00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:11.445
Now you go from just having a user and
an assistant role in a chat.

114
00:06:11.445 --> 00:06:15.306
And one time a system to now,
there's a fourth one called function, and

115
00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:18.670
to be able to handle that,
you'll see it can get pretty crazy.

116
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:23.940
There's obviously a lot of latency
around the completion API to OpenAI,

117
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.126
but there's also the latency around
your system running the function.

118
00:06:29.126 --> 00:06:33.095
And before they can answer the prompt,
all those function calls

119
00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:37.373
have to have been ran before the AI
will proceed to answer the prompt.

120
00:06:37.373 --> 00:06:40.642
So you might be waiting, I don't know,
if you have an agent, and

121
00:06:40.642 --> 00:06:43.852
it's like continuously asking you
to go run these functions and

122
00:06:43.852 --> 00:06:45.767
those functions are taking seconds.

123
00:06:45.767 --> 00:06:48.263
I don't know, you're not gonna get
an answer back until all that's done,

124
00:06:48.263 --> 00:06:48.859
I guess, right?

125
00:06:48.859 --> 00:06:50.316
So it's stuff like that.

126
00:06:53.023 --> 00:06:54.640
Accuracy, reliability,
is always the thing.

127
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.994
And then, yeah, security concerns.

128
00:06:55.994 --> 00:06:59.980
Okay, what if one of the functions
you told it to do is like, hey,

129
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.485
use this function if you need to write
raw SQL to our database, all right?

130
00:07:04.485 --> 00:07:06.461
[LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.

131
00:07:06.461 --> 00:07:09.583
And AI is like, yeah, well,
someone asked me to update a user.

132
00:07:09.583 --> 00:07:12.299
So, hey I'm gonna call the function
that you told me to, and

133
00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:14.290
here's the SQL query
that I need you to run.

134
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.766
And then you just take whatever
SQL query they give you and

135
00:07:16.766 --> 00:07:19.668
just run it against a database,
not knowing what it is, all cool.

136
00:07:19.668 --> 00:07:22.645
Now someone just like updated
a user to have ID of two now, or

137
00:07:22.645 --> 00:07:25.639
they updated the password to
be this new password, right?

138
00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:29.297
So it's like, you gotta be a little
cautious about this stuff,

139
00:07:29.297 --> 00:07:34.040
because you can't actually build a demo
of like, yeah, here's a chatbot where if

140
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.800
you ask it to change the password for
someone else, it'll do it.

141
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.847
And it will do it, it doesn't care, right?

142
00:07:39.847 --> 00:07:42.429
And this is where people
start to get scared like,

143
00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:44.012
it's gonna take over the world.

144
00:07:44.012 --> 00:07:51.147
It's like, yes, but someone wrote that,
[LAUGH] someone made that reality, right?

145
00:07:51.147 --> 00:07:55.981
So, yeah, that's some of
the security concerns there.

146
00:07:55.981 --> 00:07:59.262
So don't give it access to things
that it shouldn't have access to.

147
00:07:59.262 --> 00:08:01.595
You have to treat the AI
as if it's a user,

148
00:08:01.595 --> 00:08:04.889
you wouldn't give a user direct
access to your database.

149
00:08:04.889 --> 00:08:07.261
You shouldn't give an AI direct
access to your database.

150
00:08:07.261 --> 00:08:10.676
And as long as you follow that
rule of don't trust users,

151
00:08:10.676 --> 00:08:14.662
don't trust AI, you'll probably
be fine cuz there really isn't

152
00:08:14.662 --> 00:08:17.883
much that AI can do that
a user wouldn't be able to do.

153
00:08:17.883 --> 00:08:21.404
So some of those same protections
come in place for the most part.

154
00:08:21.404 --> 00:08:23.710
There are some different ones.

155
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:24.864
Any questions on that?

156
00:08:28.901 --> 00:08:30.574
It's a little scary, right?

157
00:08:30.574 --> 00:08:32.227
&gt;&gt; It's quite the rabbit hole.

158
00:08:32.227 --> 00:08:34.047
&gt;&gt; It is a deep rabbit hole.

159
00:08:34.047 --> 00:08:38.497
And to be honest,
I haven't really wrapped my head

160
00:08:38.497 --> 00:08:42.128
around all the implications of this yet.

161
00:08:42.128 --> 00:08:44.223
Every day I'm like, wait.

162
00:08:44.223 --> 00:08:46.542
Yeah, yeah, that's crazy.

163
00:08:46.542 --> 00:08:52.056
This one AI talking to this AI.

164
00:08:52.056 --> 00:08:56.486
Man, you can have a prompt that has
some function calling in it, and

165
00:08:56.486 --> 00:08:59.850
one of the functions is to
call another AI, right?

166
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:00.352
[LAUGH] And

167
00:09:00.352 --> 00:09:04.378
now you have a team of AIs who's working
together to accomplish something.

168
00:09:04.378 --> 00:09:05.542
It gets nuts.

169
00:09:05.542 --> 00:09:06.509
It gets nuts.
