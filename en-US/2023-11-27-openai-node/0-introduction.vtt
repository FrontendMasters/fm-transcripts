00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.520
Welcome to building
AI-powered apps with Node.js.

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.510
I'm your instructor, Scott Moss.

3
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:06.400
Happy to have you here.

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.670
Happy to be back with
the Frontend Masters team.

5
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.410
As you know, this is pretty much
the only platform that I still teach on.

6
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.590
Just love the team, I love the platform.

7
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.504
And I love to get up here and just talk
about all the random cool things that I've

8
00:00:18.504 --> 00:00:20.019
been working on if people wanna listen.

9
00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.877
[LAUGH] So here I am, I'm back today
to talk about the thing that's been on

10
00:00:24.877 --> 00:00:27.664
top of mind for
me the most which is AI, and

11
00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:32.780
the reason that's been on my mind a lot
is because of just what I do every day.

12
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.570
So if you don't know me, I've been
an engineer for over a decade now, and

13
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.591
since then, I've done things
like starting companies, and

14
00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:45.172
then eventually transitioned
over to be an investor.

15
00:00:45.172 --> 00:00:49.720
So my full-time job now is
an investor in early-stage startups.

16
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.552
And then at the firm that I work at,
I mostly focus on AI, so

17
00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:59.195
I'm literally consuming AI, whether it's
evaluating pitches from teams building

18
00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:04.206
an AI to evaluating technologies around
AI to stay educated on the market and

19
00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:06.620
different opportunities.

20
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.060
And then on a personal matter,
I spend a lot of my time, just one,

21
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.910
just trying to keep up with it,
but two, just building things.

22
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.400
So that way, I am staying relevant when
I talk to these extremely technical,

23
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.409
extremely intelligent founders that
are doing some amazing stuff on

24
00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.330
the forefront of AI.

25
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.408
So it's basically consuming
my professional and

26
00:01:27.408 --> 00:01:30.220
somewhat personal life at this point.

27
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.745
So this is kind of like
a venting exercise for

28
00:01:32.745 --> 00:01:37.400
me to just vent about all the cool stuff
that I've been seeing, and in such a way.

29
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.294
So that's kinda what I'm doing now.

30
00:01:39.294 --> 00:01:45.298
If you've paid attention, the last course
I created here was a full stack out from

31
00:01:45.298 --> 00:01:51.960
scratch where we built a note taking app
in Next Js, or not, it's a journaling app.

32
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.098
And there was a lot of AI involved in it
around figuring out the sentiment and

33
00:01:56.098 --> 00:01:57.410
things like that.

34
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.966
Okay, this course, there is a little
bit of crossover because there's AI, so

35
00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:03.600
the crossover itself is AI.

36
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.020
But in that course, it was mostly just
building the full stack app itself.

37
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.940
And we kinda went through
some examples of AI and

38
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.230
we talked about some of
the things you can do.

39
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.050
But in this course there is no UI.

40
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.480
There's no front end
component to this course,

41
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.090
cuz I feel like that would
just be a distraction.

42
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.246
This is purely only focusing on AI.

43
00:02:24.246 --> 00:02:28.946
And we're gonna get into the intricacies
of different examples beyond what we did

44
00:02:28.946 --> 00:02:30.250
in the full stack app.

45
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.467
So if you wanna learn something more like,
I really just wanna see how I can

46
00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:39.310
integrate some AI techniques into a full
stack app, go check that course out.

47
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.693
If you wanna dive into, I wanna see all
the cool stuff AI can do regardless of

48
00:02:43.693 --> 00:02:48.430
whatever app it might be sitting behind,
this is the course for you.

49
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.353
If you know me, my style is mostly like,
I just like to code as much as possible,

50
00:02:53.353 --> 00:02:57.120
I don't like to talk, but
it can get pretty crazy that way.

51
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.804
I'll get off track,
it might be unorganized.

52
00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:02.698
So to save myself and
to be a resource for you all,

53
00:03:02.698 --> 00:03:05.620
I created some notes with some materials.

54
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.935
So the first thing you wanna do is
you wanna go to this GitHub repo on

55
00:03:08.935 --> 00:03:09.970
Frontend Masters.

56
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.043
It's called ai-nodejs,
should be a public repo.

57
00:03:13.043 --> 00:03:14.120
Go check that out.

58
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.110
This repo you don't need
to pull this code down.

59
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.590
This is just like the finished
version of the course.

60
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.580
What we do here today should be an exact
replica of this, but I don't know.

61
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.648
I never write the same code twice the same
way, so it'll be mostly the same, but

62
00:03:28.648 --> 00:03:32.080
you'll get the point, but
it's here to reference as we go along.

63
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.590
If you wanna see like, okay,
what is he talking about?

64
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.431
Here's the complete version of that, but
also more importantly, in the readme,

65
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:43.511
if you click the notes, there should
be a link to a notion document that

66
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:46.020
has everything that we'll be doing here.

67
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.158
So this is all the lectures,
the topics that I'll be covering, and

68
00:03:50.158 --> 00:03:54.728
then a step by step of all the code that
I wrote in this curriculum explaining

69
00:03:54.728 --> 00:03:59.613
pretty much every single line to the best
of my ability of what I'm doing there.

70
00:03:59.613 --> 00:04:04.376
So also we'll be using this just to stay
on track, stay guided, a resource for

71
00:04:04.376 --> 00:04:09.011
you to copy and paste if you wanna catch
up, and then also that repo is there.
