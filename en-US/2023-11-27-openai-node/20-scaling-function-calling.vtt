00:00:00.097 --> 00:00:01.195
Okay, I mean,

2
00:00:01.195 --> 00:00:06.446
I think there are obvious reasons why
this is hard to scale in production.

3
00:00:06.446 --> 00:00:11.980
[LAUGH] You can do anything,
you can literally do anything.

4
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.738
So don't do everything,
that's basically the hard part.

5
00:00:15.738 --> 00:00:18.602
Don't let this thing do everything.

6
00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:23.004
Depending on what model you use,
for instance, GPT-4 is so

7
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:26.654
much better at determining
what function to call.

8
00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:29.974
If you had ten functions in here,
this gets complicated, right?

9
00:00:29.974 --> 00:00:33.746
Then it's just like, whoa, which one
do I call, which one do I call first?

10
00:00:33.746 --> 00:00:34.513
Which one do I call second?

11
00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:35.172
What's the order?

12
00:00:35.172 --> 00:00:36.236
Some of these overlap.

13
00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:39.719
GPT-4 is a lot better at that than GPT-3.

14
00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.786
And then, yeah,
trying to figure out these things,

15
00:00:44.786 --> 00:00:48.175
the descriptions, is kinda hard.

16
00:00:48.175 --> 00:00:50.747
So I actually use GPT to write
the descriptions for me.

17
00:00:50.747 --> 00:00:54.537
I'm like, [LAUGH] I'm trying to teach
GPT about this function it can use.

18
00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:57.851
And here's what the function does,
but I need to describe it to GPT.

19
00:00:57.851 --> 00:00:59.670
And then here are the parameters
I need to describe.

20
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.043
Write the descriptions for me, and

21
00:01:01.043 --> 00:01:03.165
it'll write really good
descriptions that I can use.

22
00:01:03.165 --> 00:01:05.008
So it's AI all the way down.

23
00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:07.647
[LAUGH] It's insane.

24
00:01:07.647 --> 00:01:11.595
So that's tough,
trying to get this to work.

25
00:01:11.595 --> 00:01:16.367
But the good thing is that you always
will get back structured output.

26
00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:18.410
You'll always get back this.

27
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.671
This is the beautiful part.

28
00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:22.678
This is so good for AI,
you can write tests on this now.

29
00:01:22.678 --> 00:01:25.648
This is deterministic,
every single time, it's great.

30
00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:28.215
So that's beautiful, but yeah,

31
00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:33.701
you have to think about issues around
latency with the function calling,

32
00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:37.786
security, obviously,
different things like that.

33
00:01:37.786 --> 00:01:42.925
And then you have to
think about moderation

34
00:01:42.925 --> 00:01:47.501
around what is being passed to the AI.

35
00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:52.399
And there's so many edge case
I'm not even thinking about, but

36
00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.582
this is incredibly difficult to do well.

37
00:01:55.582 --> 00:02:00.036
You ever use ChatGPT plugins, right?

38
00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:02.009
If you ever been to ChatGPT and
they have plugins you can add now?

39
00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.147
Okay, that's what this is.

40
00:02:03.147 --> 00:02:06.950
A plugin is a function
that makes an API call.

41
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:07.798
That's what a plugin is.

42
00:02:07.798 --> 00:02:10.822
That's literally it, and
there's a spec for it.

43
00:02:10.822 --> 00:02:15.269
A lot of websites have, openai api spec,

44
00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.347
right, they have this, let's see.

45
00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:21.236
Are they gonna show me here?

46
00:02:21.236 --> 00:02:23.524
My God, I don't know why I can't find one,
this is annoying.

47
00:02:23.524 --> 00:02:24.816
[LAUGH] But they're everywhere.

48
00:02:24.816 --> 00:02:26.791
Anyway, that's the new thing now.

49
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:30.894
So it was cool to like, all right, you're
a SaaS app, now you gotta have an API for

50
00:02:30.894 --> 00:02:31.621
developers.

51
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:33.314
Yeah, cool story, we all know that.

52
00:02:33.314 --> 00:02:36.578
Now, it's like, now you have
to have an OpenAI endpoint for

53
00:02:36.578 --> 00:02:39.526
the AI to hit your thing,
and that's what's new now.

54
00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:43.590
So it's not enough just to have API for
developers to hit.

55
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.872
You gotta have an endpoint for the AI
to hit, and that's what a plugin is.

56
00:02:46.872 --> 00:02:50.965
A plugin just describes, it just
teaches ChatGPT how to call your API.

57
00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:54.584
It's just a manifest for that, and
then they just do function calling.

58
00:02:54.584 --> 00:02:55.175
Because, guess what?

59
00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:59.165
You can make a standard function
call that's just called fetch.

60
00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:03.320
And its description is,
make an API request, [LAUGH] that's it.

61
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.317
And then, it just takes in a URL to an API
or anything, right, and it just does it.

62
00:03:08.317 --> 00:03:13.349
So that's what a plugin is,
it's pretty intense.

63
00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.005
But yeah, that's function calling.

64
00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:20.735
It's probably the most powerful thing ever
that program has ever done, in my opinion.

65
00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:23.567
It's terrifying, but also very exciting.

66
00:03:23.567 --> 00:03:27.229
And, yeah, I'm glad I was able to
walk you guys through that today.
