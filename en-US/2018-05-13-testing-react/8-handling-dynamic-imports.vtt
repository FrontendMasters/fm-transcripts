00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: But
because that's not supported right now,

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.580
we're going to have to
support it ourselves.

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.350
In real applications, you're gonna
be using local storage probably, and

4
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.396
so you'll want to have support for this.

5
00:00:10.396 --> 00:00:13.010
You'll also wanna have support for
session storage if you use that,

6
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.770
because that's a very similar API.

7
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:22.332
So to make this work, I'm going to
copy a file from our solution here,

8
00:00:22.332 --> 00:00:28.240
I'll duplicate that,
pull it over into our calculator.

9
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.930
And this is our local storage mock,

10
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.880
so it doesn't simulate things perfectly.

11
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.750
Local storage has some pretty
interesting things about it.

12
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.899
But as long as you're only
using the methods on it and

13
00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.106
not worrying about like the dot syntax,

14
00:00:48.106 --> 00:00:52.367
you can actually do
localStorage.foo.far.baz.

15
00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:53.556
And I don't know why you'd do that.

16
00:00:53.556 --> 00:00:55.280
That's kinda confusing to me.

17
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.570
So as long as you're just using get item,
set item,

18
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.220
and remove item, then this actually
is a perfectly fine type of mock.

19
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.740
So we need to run this
before our test run so

20
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.810
that if we don't have local storage
supported, then we can add it.

21
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.540
There's actually a couple of
ways to do this, quite honestly.

22
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.570
It's kind of annoying, but the way
that we're going to do this is with

23
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.630
the setupTestFrameworkScriptFile,
it's a very long name.

24
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.980
And we'll have that point to our module

25
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.110
that we're using to set
up our test framework.

26
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.024
So require.resolve, and

27
00:01:39.024 --> 00:01:44.858
it's test/setup whatever
the name of this thing is.

28
00:01:44.858 --> 00:01:49.676
Here we go, something

29
00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:54.760
like this, here we go.

30
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.050
And who needs the JS when you're
require resolving something?

31
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.810
Okay, so, setupTestFrameworkScriptfile
points to a file [INAUDIBLE] setups

32
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.210
your test framework.

33
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.223
And now, if we run our test again,
our tests are passing, woo!

34
00:02:12.223 --> 00:02:15.600
That's great.

35
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.366
Any questions about that?

36
00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:24.014
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: So this would be
another place or some other use cases for

37
00:02:24.014 --> 00:02:29.701
this that we're doing at PayPal is we
have this module that's responsible for

38
00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:34.871
taking all of our localization files and
turning that into a JavaScript

39
00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:40.384
object that we then, based off the user's
locale, will choose the user's

40
00:02:40.384 --> 00:02:46.160
locale to put that in the indexed HTML,
when it's rendered on the server.

41
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.150
Send that up to the client and

42
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.550
the client pulls that in for
its internationalization stuff.

43
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.440
And I really like having the English or
the default text in my test.

44
00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.610
And so I use this file to basically do
that process before I start up my test,

45
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.530
so that my test has the stuff all set up.

46
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.400
There are various other things.

47
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.230
If you have global initialization,
your documents, that simulated document

48
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.570
body needs to have a certain shape or
something for some of your third party

49
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.000
mantra your using or something, then you
can use this setupTestFrameworkScriptFile.

50
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.310
There's also a set up files array.

51
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.680
And you can check out the docs
to see what the difference is.

52
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.920
If you figure out what the difference is,

53
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.600
then please tell me because
I don't quite get it.

54
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.190
One is the testing framework
hasn't been installed yet, and

55
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.360
the other one, it has been installed,
but I never really, yeah.

56
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.240
But they both seem to work pretty well, so
