00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.840
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: So,
in the context of React,

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.530
we can write these JavaScript tests.

3
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.370
The idea behind it is to try and
use our code, or

4
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.230
our components, in the same that
they'll be used in the application.

5
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.192
And so if you open up the other directory,
simple-react,

6
00:00:23.192 --> 00:00:28.263
we'll just get started with
this item list component here.

7
00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:33.083
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: So
it's a pretty simple component.

8
00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:34.627
It's just a function component.

9
00:00:34.627 --> 00:00:38.550
And you pass items prop.

10
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.329
And if that items prop has a length,

11
00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.971
then we'll render some ul's and
li's of all those items.

12
00:00:45.971 --> 00:00:48.316
Otherwise we'll render no items.

13
00:00:48.316 --> 00:00:51.118
And then in this __tests__ directory,

14
00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:55.595
we have an item-list.todo,
that's where you need to do your work.

15
00:00:55.595 --> 00:01:01.540
And here I have a bunch of comments
on what you need to do to test this.

16
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.360
So I'm gonna throw you in the deep end
with these comments as your life jacket.

17
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.510
And you can go ahead and
try to make this work.

18
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.020
Actually have some tests to verify
that this thing is rendering

19
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.667
the list of items if there are items.

20
00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:22.384
And then the string No
items if there aren't any.

21
00:01:22.384 --> 00:01:28.363
And then we'll come back and
I'll work through the solution.

22
00:01:28.363 --> 00:01:33.088
So to run this, this I'm pretty

23
00:01:33.088 --> 00:01:37.640
sure it is npm run test simple.

24
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.720
I need to look at my list.

25
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.228
It's test react.

26
00:01:42.228 --> 00:01:45.560
npm run test:react.

27
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.700
And that will start your jest watch mode,
running these tests.

28
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.652
You can just leave it like it is and
make a change to this file.

29
00:01:56.652 --> 00:02:03.000
And it'll pick up that change and
start running the tests in there.

30
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.973
I'll give you a little tip.

31
00:02:05.973 --> 00:02:13.120
So if you haven't had any experience with
testing before, this is probably helpful.

32
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.262
This is what a test looks like.

33
00:02:14.262 --> 00:02:19.150
Title, and
then here's your code for the test.

34
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.500
You'll have the shape of a test is,

35
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.128
arrange, act, and assert.

36
00:02:27.128 --> 00:02:31.810
So you should have code that
gets things ready for the test.

37
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.530
So you're rendering the thing.

38
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.088
And then you perform some sort of action.

39
00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:38.552
In this case there's not any
interactivity, so there's not much for

40
00:02:38.552 --> 00:02:39.501
the action there.

41
00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:41.043
And then you make assertions.
