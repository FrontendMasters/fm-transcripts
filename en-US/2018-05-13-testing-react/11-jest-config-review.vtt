1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.605
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Okay,
I think that is it for the Jest thing.

2
00:00:03.605 --> 00:00:05.630
So let me just go through
a couple of take aways.

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.932
So what we had to do, and

4
00:00:08.932 --> 00:00:13.019
just kinda overview of what we
had to do to make this work.

5
00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.980
We had to add the jest as a dependency.

6
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.770
Here actually let me get my git
dif reset soft add backone.

7
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.420
There we go, so now I get my lines.

8
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.884
So we added just as a dependency,

9
00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:32.640
I did any object proxy as a dependency and
our new babble plugin.

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.477
So those are all
the dependencies we needed for

11
00:00:35.477 --> 00:00:38.230
to support all the stuff that we got.

12
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.730
We also just added these two
scripts to make that work.

13
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.024
We added a couple tests, as one does and

14
00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:49.810
then we added our configuration.

15
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.190
The moduleNameMapper to
support css modules and css.

16
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.472
If you had graph QL things
that you're importing,

17
00:00:56.472 --> 00:01:01.140
any loader that you're using with that
web pack, that's what this thing's for.

18
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.831
Our setup ScriptFile to take care
of any polyfils that it doesn't

19
00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:13.560
come supported with, and yeah,
anything that is not supported by default.

20
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.765
Collect, we specify where we want our
coverage to be collected from and

21
00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:19.950
what we want those thresholds to be.

22
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.910
And then we also have to update our bulk
RC because we do care about tree shaking.

23
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:33.293
And we do have dynamic imports and
we have to support that as well,

24
00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:37.950
that was what we needed
to do to configure Jest.

25
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.979
Any questions about configuring Jest?

26
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.549
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What was the command
you typed in to open up

27
00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.620
that webpage with the coverage?

28
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.950
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Good question,
so, actually nothing too special.

29
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.282
The Jest will create this coverage
directory, which by the way you should

30
00:01:58.282 --> 00:02:03.390
add to your git ignore because it's
generated files, who does that?

31
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.470
And then there's an lcove-report in here.

32
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.860
And this is just the sort of
website that it generates for you.

33
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.884
And so the open command is just like
let me think I think this works

34
00:02:11.884 --> 00:02:12.840
on the Windows too.

35
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.210
And it will just use the default program
that I have set for this file type.

36
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.150
And so I could also open this up in
finder and go double-click on it.

37
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.941
But yeah, it will be in coverage,
I'll cover for it in next HTML,

38
00:02:30.941 --> 00:02:32.580
any other questions?

39
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.508
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: There's
a question on the chat.

40
00:02:35.508 --> 00:02:36.709
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Thank you so much.

41
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.620
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: In a large organization
such as PayPal, who's responsible for

42
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.130
setting up tooling for
testing, coverage, CI, etc.?

43
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.001
So it kinda depends, so at PayPal
they had testing when I joined up,

44
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:55.820
a couple of tests with Mocha,
but not a lot.

45
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.600
I cared the most about testing,
so it was my job.

46
00:02:59.908 --> 00:03:03.530
I just said, hey, I want to write tests
for this and I want it to not be terrible.

47
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.530
So, yeah, so
I actually migrated us from Mocha to Ava.

48
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.540
And I was like guys, listen,
this is gonna be amazing.

49
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.660
They were all guys on my team,
luckily that changed.

50
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.890
It's gonna be amazing, and
Eva will run all of our tests in parallel.

51
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.372
And this was a while ago,
Eva was still getting built,

52
00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:28.410
ended up being way slower and
so many problems.

53
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.500
And so everybody was like Kent,
you don't know what you're talking about.

54
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.070
And then I came to them later and
I was like, hey, listen.

55
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.780
So there's this Jest thing that suddenly
just started to be really awesome.

56
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.330
Please let me migrate us over to Jest.

57
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.000
Come on Ken, last time you did that
it was like terrible and I did.

58
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.800
And now they all give me standing ovations
anytime I come into the office, like,

59
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.730
he's the one.

60
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.920
He brought us Jest,
it's not really what it's like, but

61
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.840
we're all very, very happy with Jest.

62
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.840
So it's kind of my job, in general I just
suggest that's it's the engineers job.

63
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.336
I feel very strongly that QA has
an important role to play, but

64
00:04:12.336 --> 00:04:16.580
engineers should be responsible for
testing their code.

65
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.802
So, yeah, engineers are also
responsible for setting up the tools.

66
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.956
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Okay, cool, there's one
other thing that I just kinda wanted to

67
00:04:29.956 --> 00:04:36.240
show you that actually in an application
or in a project that has multiple,

68
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.950
you need to adjust multiple
configurations is really useful.

69
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.332
So at PayPal we have
our front end code and

70
00:04:44.332 --> 00:04:48.760
out back end code all in a single repo,
and we're testing it all with Jest.

71
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.322
And Jest has this really,

72
00:04:50.322 --> 00:04:54.090
really awesome feature that I'm
utilizing in this workshop.

73
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.794
So if you look at the Jest config
at the root of the project,

74
00:04:58.794 --> 00:05:05.170
we've got all of our coverage
configuration in that root JEST.config.is.

75
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.800
And then we have this
projects property here.

76
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.500
And that points to the directory where
there's another Jest configuration.

77
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.880
And when you do that,
if we run, go back up here.

78
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.590
And if I run node_modules/.bin/jest,
however you want to run that.

79
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.434
And it's gonna pick up my jest
configuration, my default and

80
00:05:31.434 --> 00:05:34.330
it will run all of these in parallel.

81
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.550
And if I do watch mode,
they'll all be together in watch mode.

82
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.850
But each test is running with
a different configuration entirely.

83
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.194
You can add a display name
to your configuration, so

84
00:05:45.194 --> 00:05:48.450
that you know which project these are in.

85
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.190
But yeah,
that is like a very amazing feature.

86
00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.084
And then it will combine all the coverage,

87
00:05:54.084 --> 00:05:56.250
because I don't care to
separate the coverage.

88
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.720
I just really care about the whole
coverage overall my whole project.

89
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.933
So if I open
the coverage/lcov-report in here,

90
00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:11.400
then I'm gonna get client side and
server side.

91
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.305
And if I want to, I could set this and
I cover it's threshold to be like so

92
00:06:14.305 --> 00:06:17.420
on a client side, it should be this,
on the server side, it should be this.

93
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.000
Whatever you can look in deeper into
the covers threshold options, but

94
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.850
yeah, this is just an amazing feature.

95
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.878
You probably will use it if you're
repo isn't just a react app,

96
00:06:28.878 --> 00:06:31.276
if you have multiple things in there.

97
00:06:31.276 --> 00:06:34.544
For your set-up script actually, just for

98
00:06:34.544 --> 00:06:39.060
funzies, we've got several
jest configurations in here.

99
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.460
So this is the one I run,
when you run the set-up script.

100
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.762
So we get a client server and

101
00:06:43.762 --> 00:06:47.000
a whole bunch of other configurations
all running at the same time.

102
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.675
Jest is so awesome.

103
00:06:48.675 --> 00:06:52.912
So anyway, that's Jest.
