00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.040
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: There is one thing
that I am going to show you that doesn't

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.430
actually apply specifically to react but
is really useful for

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.010
jest if you are writing JavaScript
modules that are just pure JavaScript,

4
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.360
don't need the DOM or anything like that.

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.380
By default, jest actually loads
JSDOM in the environment and

6
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.239
here we can go in our utils,
we can console.log(window).

7
00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.940
What, that's weird.

8
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.710
And then we'll run our test again and

9
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.300
we'll see the giant window object
that's provided to us by JS DOM.

10
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.650
Okay, so that's kind of fun and stuff.

11
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.280
But if this were the only test
that I had in my project,

12
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.980
maybe this is a note project or
it's just pure Java scripting,

13
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.260
then I don't actually need
the ability to access window.

14
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.546
And so I don't need JS DOM.

15
00:00:56.546 --> 00:01:01.275
By adding JS DOM it actually
is pretty heavy memory wise.

16
00:01:01.275 --> 00:01:05.070
And so it adds to the start time so
that's why I'm showing you.

17
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.410
Let's go ahead and add our configuration
right in the [INAUDIBLE] JSON for jest.

18
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.040
And here we can add a test environment and
this is a path to a node

19
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.950
module that is responsible for creating or
setting up the test environment.

20
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.927
And so
there is a jest-environment-jsdom, and

21
00:01:26.927 --> 00:01:33.630
that's the default that's installed when
you install jest so that's why this works.

22
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.290
And then there's a jest environment node
and that's also installed by default so

23
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.970
you don't have to install that.

24
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.860
There are various other test environments
that are kind of interesting.

25
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.240
I feel like there's even one that's like
for selenium or web driver or something.

26
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.400
It's just like what?

27
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.820
It's crazy.

28
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.410
Jest is a very, very versatile tool.

29
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.550
Another handy feature about
this test environment is if

30
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.550
the module starts with jest-environment
and you can actually remove that.

31
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.180
So it reads a little nicer.

32
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.090
So with that we can run this and
now our test is going to fail

33
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.450
because we're trying to log
something that's not defined.

34
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.079
So we are all set to have our
tests run a little bit faster.
