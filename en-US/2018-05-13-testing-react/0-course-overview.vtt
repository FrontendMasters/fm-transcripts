WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.740
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: So this is all about
testing React and web applications.

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.560
These are a bunch of links about,
just information about me,

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.630
stuff that I do and I'm involved with.

4
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.730
So, yeah, feel free to click around and
check this stuff out,

5
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.140
my sites are available here.

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.166
They're not very interesting beyond this,
but it's tra-slides.

7
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:26.420
On kcd.im and,
yeah like I said there's not a whole

8
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.680
lot this slides most of my workshop are
very matching the code and in the repo.

9
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.100
So let's set up an expectations for
the workshop, this workshop

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.080
is about the fundamentals of
testing specifically with React.

11
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.790
I will talk briefly about
the fundamentals of testing in general.

12
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.820
But if you want to go deeper on that,
my other course kinda goes into that more.

13
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.600
I'm going to show you
how to configure Jest.

14
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.890
So I thought a lot about how can I make

15
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.340
the configuration of these
tools interactive and hands on.

16
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.020
And the only answer I kept coming
back with is, this will be so

17
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.560
boring to have exercises for
configuring of tools.

18
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.790
So you'll just watch me,
interact with me, and ask questions, but

19
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.520
yeah I'll show you how to configure
Jest for a client side React project.

20
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.630
Luckily, if you're using like create React
app, it's all configured for you and

21
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.510
it's like magic.

22
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.270
But most applications are not
using create React app so

23
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.060
it's good to know how to configure Jest.

24
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.210
I'll talk a little bit about code
coverage and how to use it as a metric,

25
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.080
how to use it properly and
how to configure Jest to support that.

26
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.860
And we'll talk about unit testing,

27
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.390
mostly I'll talk a little bit
about JavaScript utilities but

28
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.540
this is mostly a React stuff so
the React components specifically.

29
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.434
How many people have heard
of snapshot testing, okay?

30
00:01:59.434 --> 00:02:01.560
Anybody use it?

31
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.527
Okay, so I'll go over what
it really actually is and

32
00:02:05.527 --> 00:02:10.590
where it works well and I'll also
talk where it does not work well.

33
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.700
So how you can use that to effectively
give you confidence in your

34
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.640
application and then we'll do
integration tests with React.

35
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.776
So, integration tests for traditionally
it's two services talking to each other,

36
00:02:26.776 --> 00:02:29.110
that's an integration test.

37
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.000
I think the languages kind of changing
there, and now we're talking about

38
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.410
integrating with other, you could almost
consider your components as a service.

39
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.696
And so in this situation,

40
00:02:39.696 --> 00:02:43.730
we'll be talking about integrating
components with each other..

41
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.980
And so we'll talk a little bit about that,
and you'll have some exercises for that.

42
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.550
And then we'll get into the end to end
stuff using a different tool called

43
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.830
Cypress, which is totally
mind-blowingly awesome.

44
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.020
How many people have used Cypress before?

45
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.160
All right, cool, so Joel knows what's up.

46
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.840
He can tell you Cypress is fantastic,
and so

47
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.350
I'll do a similar thing
that I did with Jest.

48
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.410
Cypress actually takes a little
less to configure itself, but

49
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.420
there's a little bit more that you have
to consider with Cypress in general.

50
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.310
But yeah, then we'll have some
exercises for writing intent tests.

51
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.190
So that's pretty much the whole course.

52
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.590
Anybody have questions about that?

53
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.180
Okay, so
here's what this workshop is not about.

54
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.810
It's pretty technology specific,
I'm not gonna show you Mocha,

55
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.610
I'm not gonna show you Jasmine.

56
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.250
I'm gonna show you
the best testing framework

57
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.920
from my experience that I've had for
testing React.

58
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.850
Another thing that I didn't mention, but

59
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.510
I'll just give you the spoiler,
we're not gonna be using Enzyme.

60
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.100
That's like the defacto standard for
testing React's components.

61
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.680
I have a lot of problems with Enzyme, and

62
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.650
I'll talk about those problems
that I have with Enzyme later.

63
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.930
I used Enzyme for like a year and a half
in preparing this workshop and preparing

64
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.040
to teach you all Enzyme, I realize
that it and there were some problems.

65
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.300
I just didn't feel comfortable
teaching you about the tools.

66
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.380
So we'll be using something else
that we'll talk about later.

67
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.240
So, yes it is clearly
quite opinionated and

68
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.340
yeah, we're not gonna cover
all the forms of testing.

69
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.910
There are a lot of them so

70
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.150
we'll just cover the three unit,
integration, and intent.

71
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.380
If you haven't set things up,
definitely get that started.

72
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.120
If you have set things up already, and you
did that yesterday or something, go ahead

73
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:49.230
and do a git pull to get the latest
changes because you will want those.

74
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.840
And actually you could also run npm
run setup as well as to updates some

75
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.400
dependencies.

76
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.850
There is a bug fix in
one of our dependencies,

77
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.280
so if you can get that
updated that would be cool.

78
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.226
But not totally critical if you don't.

79
00:05:05.226 --> 00:05:11.930
Cool so, logistics for this,
sorry, some more boring stuff.

80
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.830
If you have questions
please raise your hand,

81
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.560
you all who are here in person have
a very important job and that is to ask

82
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.120
the questions that people would be asking
when they're watching the course later.

83
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.890
So please, if any question comes into
your mind, if you don't wanna ask it for

84
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.410
yourself ask it for the person who will
wanting to know later, because they can't.

85
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.980
So please, please ask questions.

86
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.860
We have a chat during the workshop,
so feel free

87
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.520
to debug and work through things
together in there and I'll try to be

88
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:54.650
more conscious of that today so that I can
pick up the questions that pop up there.

89
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.750
For several of the exercises we have

90
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.250
a spot where you can elaborate
on what you've learned.

91
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.405
And if you're watching this as
a course there's the note feature in

92
00:06:04.405 --> 00:06:08.060
Frontendmasters, really
important part of learning and

93
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.710
retaining what you've learned is to
elaborate on what you've learned.

94
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.350
Try to say it in you own words, and so
at the bottom of some of the tests that

95
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.840
you'll be writing is an extra
test that has a link to,

96
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.150
a feedback form where you can
type out that elaboration.

97
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.100
And so,
I highly recommend that you do that.

98
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.990
It's an important part of your learning.

99
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.610
And if you have questions that aren't
relevant to what we're talking about here,

100
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:38.660
that's totally cool to ask me those,
but let's keep the workshop on topic.

101
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.460
You can ask those questions on my AMA,
you'll find it on GitHub.

102
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:49.410
It's ask me anything and then I tweet
about stuff sometimes, a lot actually.

103
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.160
I tweet all the time, I tweet too much.

104
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.530
Okay, so
this is more of what we're gonna do.

105
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.370
So I'll demo something,

106
00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.300
introduce an exercise, a concept and
then hand that off to you.

107
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.430
During the exercise if you can, or

108
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.750
if you'd be interested in pair programming
in the exercise, you have two people but

109
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.880
one computer, that can actually
enhance your experience as well.

110
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.040
So you balance ideas off of each other,

111
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.140
clarify each other's assumptions and
correct assumptions in some cases.

112
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.490
So that's a pretty good
learning mechanism as well,

113
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.710
if you're interested in pair programming,
and then fill out the feedback form.

114
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.820
Some of these have a bonus, or

115
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.630
you could make up your own bonus,
mess around with stuff.

116
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.540
So if you finish earlier, you can do that.

117
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.340
Help each other out that will also
help solidify your understanding.

118
00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.890
I have a secret about learning and
that is to solidify your learning,

119
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:53.690
you have to teach and so you all are
participating in my learning experience,

120
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.900
this is just me trying to learn.

121
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.641
And it works out really well, so
if you have an opportunity to help

122
00:08:00.641 --> 00:08:05.352
somebody else teach somebody through this
workshop that'd be a good thing to do.

123
00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:08.770
And then feel free to make full requests,
this is open source,

124
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.580
many people make full requests for
my workshops.

125
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.670
And so definitely if you notice
something kinda weird then

126
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.560
feel free to make a pull
request if you have extra time.
