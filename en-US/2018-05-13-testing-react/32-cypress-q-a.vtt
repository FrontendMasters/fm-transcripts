00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.332
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Other questions?

2
00:00:02.332 --> 00:00:04.160
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's running these tests in

3
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.320
Chrome right now.

4
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.160
Does it work in other browsers?
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Yeah, good question.

5
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.600
So right now, as far as I know,
it doesn't support any other browsers.

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.890
Well, with the caveat,
supports running Electron.

7
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.300
Yeah, there's a poll request
open right now for Firefox,

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.690
at least there was a month
ago when I last checked.

9
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.550
So it might be merched by now.

10
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.120
And then there's work to
support Edge as well.

11
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.230
If I recall correctly,
supporting Safari is actually really hard,

12
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.840
just because Safari doesn't expose
all the APIs that they need.

13
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.190
Now that I think about it,

14
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.440
I think that Safari just recently made
some changes to make that easier.

15
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.520
So we'll see what the future holds for
that.

16
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.982
So the question, the next question
that inevitably comes up is, okay,

17
00:00:52.982 --> 00:00:55.770
well that's kind of a deal breaker for
me and my team.

18
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.580
We need to test cross-browser,
and the question I always ask is,

19
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.400
when was the last time
your test caught something

20
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.900
that they wouldn't have caught if your
tests weren't running cross-browser?

21
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.180
Maybe that happens a fair amount to you,
but

22
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.710
that never really happens to me and
my team.

23
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.506
We're not actually using Cypress.

24
00:01:15.506 --> 00:01:19.210
I use Cypress for my open source stuff
I was unable to convince them that

25
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.829
cross browser doesn't matter.

26
00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.730
Cross-browser matters but
not as much as you think.

27
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.965
In this day and age, most of the issues
that you're running against with

28
00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:35.900
cross-browser problems are related to
under polyfilling or under transpiling.

29
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.680
And those are two problems
that you solve one time.

30
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.180
It's like, we have this problem and
so I'm gonna add this Polyfill.io or

31
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.700
I'm going to make sure I require
Babel Polyfill or something, and

32
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.350
then you never have that problem again.

33
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.230
Or let's just update our Babel config and
now that problem is gone.

34
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.040
If you really are concerned about,

35
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.460
I just need to at least open my
app in all of these browsers.

36
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.455
Then, that's great, just to have four
Selenium tests that open your app and

37
00:02:05.455 --> 00:02:09.633
the browser, run through some really
critical things that you are worried about

38
00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:12.215
with cross-browser compatibility issues,
and

39
00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.380
then to the rest of your tests in Cypress.

40
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.745
Because the value that you
get out of Cypress is just so

41
00:02:18.745 --> 00:02:23.304
great that it seems a shame to
throw away Cypress just for

42
00:02:23.304 --> 00:02:29.540
that last 2% of confidence that you
miss out by not doing cross-browser.

43
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.540
So what I would say is, use Selenium for
a couple of tests to make sure

44
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.460
things are running cross-browser okay,
and then use Cypress for everything else.

45
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.080
And so, cuz the decision really is,

46
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.870
we're gonna have 100 Selenium
tests that take hours to run.

47
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.010
Or we're going to have
10 Selenium tests and

48
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.290
then 1,000 Cypress tests that probably
will still actually take less than

49
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.300
Selenium, than 100 Selenium tests,
because Cypress is so much faster.

50
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.670
And then the development process
is much faster as well, and

51
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.720
that's why you can have that
many tests with Cypress.

52
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.824
So for me it actually feels
like a no-brainer to, and

53
00:03:08.824 --> 00:03:13.910
you saw setting up Cypress is
actually pretty straightforward.

54
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.980
So I would, if cross-browser what
really matters to you, then have both.

55
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.950
Just focus mostly on Cypress and
you'll get a lot of value out of that.
