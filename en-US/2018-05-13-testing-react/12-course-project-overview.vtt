00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.900
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Let's go ahead and
look at what the projects looks like.

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.336
So you know what you're actually testing.

3
00:00:05.336 --> 00:00:09.373
So you run npm run dev, do not start.

4
00:00:09.373 --> 00:00:14.463
And this will start up the server and
I generated a bunch of random data and

5
00:00:14.463 --> 00:00:17.729
start up the client that
will hit that server.

6
00:00:17.729 --> 00:00:21.123
So this is the Today I Learned app and

7
00:00:21.123 --> 00:00:25.659
yeah it just has a bunch
of random posts in here.

8
00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:26.962
You can login.

9
00:00:26.962 --> 00:00:31.665
There's a user already pre-filled in here,
called TIL for Today I Learned,

10
00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:33.457
and the password is also til.

11
00:00:33.457 --> 00:00:35.639
And then you can add,
and this is the editor,

12
00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:38.115
this is what I'm gonna be
testing here in a second.

13
00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:44.806
So, something cool, stuff that is awesome,

14
00:00:44.806 --> 00:00:49.790
and frontend.masters.rocks.

15
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.584
Okay, so we can create a post,
we can't delete it.

16
00:00:52.584 --> 00:00:54.102
You can add that feature if you wanna.

17
00:00:54.102 --> 00:00:54.883
It could be fun.

18
00:00:54.883 --> 00:00:59.842
So, that's what I will be
testing here in a second.

19
00:00:59.842 --> 00:01:00.785
What you will be testing.

20
00:01:00.785 --> 00:01:05.387
It's the login which is actually
very similar to the register,

21
00:01:05.387 --> 00:01:10.346
you might not notice but the URL is
changing they are like identical.

22
00:01:10.346 --> 00:01:14.565
So, you'll be testing this form,
I'll be testing the editor.
