00:00:00.162 --> 00:00:04.290
Now that we're all experts on server
components, let's talk about the number

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.796
one feature in Next.js, and then we'll
write some code, is basically the routing.

3
00:00:08.796 --> 00:00:14.290
So I have some notes here that kinda talk
about routing but we can go over this, so

4
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.803
I'm just gonna open my editor and we're
just going to start working on our app.

5
00:00:19.803 --> 00:00:23.690
So I think the first thing we wanna do is,
before we get in there and

6
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.437
get busy with the routing,
let's just get everything set up,

7
00:00:27.437 --> 00:00:30.494
that way we can start
actually working on this app.

8
00:00:30.494 --> 00:00:34.681
So what I'm going to do is I'm
just gonna make it a repo here.

9
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:39.972
Let me see, actually, one of the best ways
to get started is to use create-react-app.

10
00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:43.630
The problem with that, though, is that
I just wanna be locked into a certain

11
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.187
version, I'm sorry,
not create-react-app, create-next-app.

12
00:00:47.187 --> 00:00:50.393
The problem with that, though, is I wanna
be locked into a certain version with this

13
00:00:50.393 --> 00:00:52.846
course going forward to make
sure it's backwards compatible.

14
00:00:52.846 --> 00:00:56.370
So just keeping that in mind if you're
following along, whatever version we

15
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.545
download what create-react-app.dev, that's
the version you wanna make sure you have

16
00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:03.760
going forward, otherwise future
versions might break this course.

17
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.931
But anyway, I'm just gonna type npx.

18
00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:10.277
If you don't know what npx is, it actually
comes installed with Node, it's basically

19
00:01:10.277 --> 00:01:13.761
a way for you to run global CLIs
without having to download those CLIs.

20
00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:17.927
So npx and then create-next-app like this.

21
00:01:17.927 --> 00:01:20.457
I'm just gonna say @latest,
which is gonna give me the latest.

22
00:01:20.457 --> 00:01:22.165
We'll see what version
that resolves to and

23
00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:24.296
that's the version you're
gonna make sure you have.

24
00:01:24.296 --> 00:01:26.819
If you're taking this course,
after this recording,

25
00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.352
make sure you have this version,
we'll talk about it.

26
00:01:29.352 --> 00:01:33.220
And then I can put
an optional folder name here,

27
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.583
I'll just say intro-v3-app,
and I'll do that.

28
00:01:37.583 --> 00:01:41.678
And then now it's gonna give you this
prompt of different configurations you

29
00:01:41.678 --> 00:01:46.284
wanna use, so asking me to use TypeScript,
I'm going to say yes, I love TypeScript.

30
00:01:46.284 --> 00:01:50.707
ESLint, for sure, Tailwind, yes.

31
00:01:50.707 --> 00:01:56.808
Source directory, so by default, Next.js
works on the root of this directory.

32
00:01:56.808 --> 00:02:00.650
If you wanna put all that into a folder
called source, you can do that,

33
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.703
I'm gonna say no.

34
00:02:01.703 --> 00:02:02.820
Use the App Router,

35
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.047
we'll talk about the App Router, but
yes, definitely use the App Router.

36
00:02:07.047 --> 00:02:09.550
Would you like to customize
the default import aliases?

37
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.900
Don't worry about that right now,
I'd say no.

38
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.631
And then it's just gonna
install everything.

39
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:18.556
&gt;&gt; So is Tailwind kinda
becoming the standard of using?

40
00:02:18.556 --> 00:02:20.410
&gt;&gt; I hate to say it, but yeah.

41
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.870
And the reason I hate to say it is-
&gt;&gt; Also in inline styling, it's-

42
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.389
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.

43
00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:28.783
The reason I hate to say it is cuz I
personally just don't like writing tons of

44
00:02:28.783 --> 00:02:33.589
CSS classes, all of my components, and for
the longest I just did not understand or

45
00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:34.155
like to.

46
00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:38.021
And I didn't know why people use it, I'm
like, I don't get it, I would just rather

47
00:02:38.021 --> 00:02:41.890
just use a component library, I don't
know, that already has styled components,

48
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.851
and then just edit those styles
with inline styling that I need.

49
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:49.321
But I've gotten to this point where I've
realized I was doing more editing of

50
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:54.065
component libraries to fit the style that
I need, and it was probably faster for me

51
00:02:54.065 --> 00:02:58.993
to start with components that didn't have
any style and add the style that I needed.

52
00:02:58.993 --> 00:03:02.239
So then I found myself writing my own CSS,
and then I was like,

53
00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.111
well, I don't wanna write my own CSS,
this is gross,

54
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:08.753
there's gotta be a CSS library out there,
and then it was Tailwind.

55
00:03:08.753 --> 00:03:10.856
But even then I still didn't stick to it,

56
00:03:10.856 --> 00:03:13.690
I think what changed my mind
is I had the wrong idea of it.

57
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.311
I thought Tailwind was just a CSS
library like a Bootstrap, but

58
00:03:17.311 --> 00:03:21.629
in reality, it's a JavaScript library
that generates CSS dynamically.

59
00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.087
And that was when I was like,
wait, this is really powerful.

60
00:03:25.087 --> 00:03:29.826
So that plus me learning about headless
components, which are components that have

61
00:03:29.826 --> 00:03:34.180
functionality but no styling associated
with it, kinda solved my problem.

62
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.840
So I can get the functionality of these
components that look like crap and

63
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.123
then just add Tailwind to it and
it was great.

64
00:03:40.123 --> 00:03:45.120
So yeah, I would say it's pretty much
the standard at this point if you

65
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.162
like this style of styling.

66
00:03:47.162 --> 00:03:51.342
Obviously, there's other different types
of styling, we'll talk about some of them,

67
00:03:51.342 --> 00:03:54.042
but if you like using CSS classes,
it's basically free.

68
00:03:54.042 --> 00:03:56.749
So you just gotta learn Tailwind, right?

69
00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:00.212
But they do do a good job of making
sure the class names match the property

70
00:04:00.212 --> 00:04:04.327
names in CSS so it's almost intuitive, so
you kinda get the hang of it really quick.

71
00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.124
Let's just go check out what we got, so

72
00:04:06.124 --> 00:04:08.148
I'm gonna open this up
in my VS Code editor.

73
00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:10.727
I got a lot of things going on there.

74
00:04:10.727 --> 00:04:12.711
Actually, let me cd into it first.

75
00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:13.944
How about that?

76
00:04:13.944 --> 00:04:16.892
So intro-v3, what do I call it?

77
00:04:16.892 --> 00:04:22.301
App, and I'm gonna open this.

78
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:23.685
So we get a lot of things here, but

79
00:04:23.685 --> 00:04:26.713
the first thing I wanna check out is
just everything that got installed.

80
00:04:26.713 --> 00:04:29.985
So if you head to the package.json,
which if you don't know,

81
00:04:29.985 --> 00:04:34.122
is just the file that keeps track of all
of our dependencies in our Node project,

82
00:04:34.122 --> 00:04:38.240
and we can take a look at the dependencies
in the field here and see a few things.

83
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.886
The most important one
is that we see next.

84
00:04:39.886 --> 00:04:44.234
So next itself is a dependency
in which we download, and

85
00:04:44.234 --> 00:04:47.759
you can see that we resolve to 13.4.5.

86
00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.885
So if you are following along,
if you're watching this later and

87
00:04:51.885 --> 00:04:54.135
you have troubles with any errors,

88
00:04:54.135 --> 00:04:58.876
it's probably cuz you did the latest
command and got a different version.

89
00:04:58.876 --> 00:05:02.927
So what you can do is you can just say,
instead of what we did,

90
00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:06.591
which was @latest,
you can just do @13.4.5.

91
00:05:08.647 --> 00:05:11.962
Just to make sure you have the exact same
version that we're using right now since

92
00:05:11.962 --> 00:05:13.679
it might be a later version in the future.

93
00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:17.177
So you do that, hit Enter,
you'll pretty much get the same thing.

94
00:05:17.177 --> 00:05:20.624
So we have that, you can see that
we opted in for the esLint things.

95
00:05:20.624 --> 00:05:24.816
So we have all the linting stuff, we get
some types set up because we asked for

96
00:05:24.816 --> 00:05:25.611
TypeScript.

97
00:05:25.611 --> 00:05:29.512
Autoprefixer, which is pretty
much needed by Tailwind,

98
00:05:29.512 --> 00:05:31.827
postcss also needed by Tailwind.

99
00:05:31.827 --> 00:05:35.448
Because Next.js sits on top of React,
we get all the React goodies,

100
00:05:35.448 --> 00:05:39.766
Tailwind itself, and then because I opted
in for TypeScript, I get TypeScript.

101
00:05:39.766 --> 00:05:41.164
We also get a few commands here.

102
00:05:41.164 --> 00:05:46.180
So we get a dev command which we'll be
using to develop with locally, gives us

103
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.134
fast refresh, hot reload, a server to
serve, all the really cool things.

104
00:05:51.134 --> 00:05:53.019
The build and
start command is for production,

105
00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:56.188
this is where we'll build the actual app
and then we can start it in production.

106
00:05:56.188 --> 00:05:59.451
You almost will never use this locally
unless you're testing to see if it works

107
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:00.149
in production.

108
00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:04.147
And then lint command does exactly
what you think it does, it lints.

109
00:06:04.147 --> 00:06:08.513
And I'm gonna ignore the linter today, so
red squigglies give you anxiety, you're

110
00:06:08.513 --> 00:06:11.178
about to have a lot of anxiety today cuz-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

111
00:06:11.178 --> 00:06:12.333
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm pretty much

112
00:06:12.333 --> 00:06:13.251
gonna ignore it.

113
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:17.864
[LAUGH] So yeah, and then yeah,
everything else is pretty standard.

114
00:06:17.864 --> 00:06:21.685
And you can see it also set up the
configurations for a lot of these things.

115
00:06:21.685 --> 00:06:24.442
So it set up the postcss.config,

116
00:06:24.442 --> 00:06:30.620
it set up the tailwind.config with our
paths to our app already configured,

117
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:36.526
some custom stuff here for their initial
app that you'll see in a minute.

118
00:06:36.526 --> 00:06:39.951
If you opted in for TypeScript,
you can see TypeScript is already set up.

119
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:44.639
We got some alias paths, all that good
stuff, so pretty much good to go.

120
00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.784
We also have this next.config,
we'll talk about that, but

121
00:06:47.784 --> 00:06:50.453
the most important one to
look at is this app folder.

122
00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:54.702
So this app folder, if you remember, there
was an option when I did create-next-app,

123
00:06:54.702 --> 00:06:57.094
it was like,
do you wanna use the App Router or no?

124
00:06:57.094 --> 00:06:59.428
It was yes or no, and I said you
should probably pick yes on this.

125
00:06:59.428 --> 00:07:02.543
This is the new version of
Next.js that I was talking about.

126
00:07:02.543 --> 00:07:06.925
Right, like if we head over to
the Next.js documentation here,

127
00:07:06.925 --> 00:07:08.605
I'm gonna blow this up.

128
00:07:08.605 --> 00:07:11.663
You can see here on the side there's
a dropdown for Pages Router and

129
00:07:11.663 --> 00:07:12.653
App Router, right?

130
00:07:12.653 --> 00:07:13.845
We are using the App Router.

131
00:07:13.845 --> 00:07:18.646
This is what's new in 13, and we'll talk
about that in literally just a second,

132
00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:20.648
but this is what we wanna opt in to.

133
00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:25.831
And the way that reflects in the repo
is that there is a folder called app.

134
00:07:25.831 --> 00:07:29.880
You actually have to have a folder
called app in order to opt into this.

135
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.008
So yeah, and then once you look in here,
you'll see a couple things,

136
00:07:33.008 --> 00:07:35.461
something called a page,
something called a layout.

137
00:07:35.461 --> 00:07:40.841
If you've never seen a TSX file, that's
just the TypeScript version of a JSX file.

138
00:07:40.841 --> 00:07:43.143
That's all it is, it's nothing crazy.

139
00:07:43.143 --> 00:07:47.379
So if you know JSX in JavaScript,
then you know how to use TSX,

140
00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:51.863
because it's the same thing but
TypeScript, which like I said,

141
00:07:51.863 --> 00:07:54.900
I probably won't be
using any types at all.

142
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.045
Have a CSS file and then a favicon.

143
00:07:57.045 --> 00:08:00.452
So the next thing I wanna
do is I want to start this.

144
00:08:00.452 --> 00:08:03.511
So to start this, like I said,
we're gonna use the dev command.

145
00:08:03.511 --> 00:08:08.957
So we can just say npm run
dev to run that dev script.

146
00:08:08.957 --> 00:08:13.140
And you'll see that it's going to start
it on a port, it tried to use 3000,

147
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:17.522
in my case, I already have something
running on 3000, so it went to 3001.

148
00:08:17.522 --> 00:08:19.511
I can just Cmd+Click on this and
open it up.

149
00:08:22.087 --> 00:08:24.069
And you should see something like this.

150
00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:30.997
So this is the stock Next.js scaffold
app that they give you out the gate.

151
00:08:30.997 --> 00:08:34.835
Everyone should see the same thing, unless
they changed it in a later version and

152
00:08:34.835 --> 00:08:36.415
you're looking at this later and

153
00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:40.211
it doesn't look like this, but this is
what you get by default on this version.

154
00:08:40.211 --> 00:08:43.778
And yeah, it's pretty cool, and
everything here just kinda links

155
00:08:43.778 --> 00:08:48.107
to their documentation so you can check
it out, but it's a great starting point.

156
00:08:48.107 --> 00:08:52.749
One last thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna make a new file on the root,

157
00:08:52.749 --> 00:08:54.388
call it .prettierrc.

158
00:08:54.388 --> 00:08:58.534
And the reason I'm doing this is
because I wanna be able to hit Save and

159
00:08:58.534 --> 00:09:02.468
have everything be auto formatted
with esLint and prettier, and

160
00:09:02.468 --> 00:09:07.211
prettier won't work unless you have
a prettier configuration on your route.

161
00:09:07.211 --> 00:09:11.243
And I also like to have my single quotes,
I hate double quotes,

162
00:09:11.243 --> 00:09:15.285
and I also don't like semicolons,
so I'm turning those off.

163
00:09:15.285 --> 00:09:21.212
You don't have to have this, this is only
because my VS Code is looking for this.

164
00:09:21.212 --> 00:09:25.567
My prettier esLint plugins inside my VS
Code is looking for this file in order for

165
00:09:25.567 --> 00:09:26.226
it to work.

166
00:09:26.226 --> 00:09:28.886
Yours might be set up differently,
so you can add it,

167
00:09:28.886 --> 00:09:31.918
it won't change the functionality or
anything on your app.

168
00:09:31.918 --> 00:09:34.061
Just allows me to get
formatting when I hit Save,

169
00:09:34.061 --> 00:09:36.740
which is something that I cannot
live without at this point.
