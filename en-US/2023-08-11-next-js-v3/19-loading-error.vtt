00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.886
Loading and Error.

2
00:00:00.886 --> 00:00:08.043
So loading and
error is actually pretty cool.

3
00:00:08.043 --> 00:00:10.569
Anyone ever heard of React Suspense?

4
00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:11.730
All right never heard of React Suspense.

5
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.130
So React Suspense basically
allows you to stream.

6
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.051
You can basically stream
the data in from a component and

7
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:23.430
show some type of loading
state while that's happening.

8
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.201
It's like async and it's components
almost, so you can wait for

9
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:33.145
that component to load and
show some type of loading component while

10
00:00:33.145 --> 00:00:37.584
that's loading,
it's the simplest way I can describe it.

11
00:00:37.584 --> 00:00:40.438
There is a suspense component in
which you can set that up manually.

12
00:00:40.438 --> 00:00:45.459
But we get that for free if we just
make a loading JS file, or TSX, or

13
00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:51.133
JSX file in whatever directory in which
a page or a layout is fetching data.

14
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.619
So while that page or
layout is fetching data,

15
00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:57.829
in the meantime it will instantly show
your loading component to the client and

16
00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.480
then when your data comes back without
an error then it will show that component.

17
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.710
So we get that for
free just by making a new file.

18
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.975
The same is true for error state, so

19
00:01:06.975 --> 00:01:10.080
if something errors out
we can show a component.

20
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.597
If while fetching data on that page
errored out, we get that for free.

21
00:01:13.597 --> 00:01:17.982
Which is basically what they introduced,
I don't know what version don't quote me,

22
00:01:17.982 --> 00:01:20.397
maybe 15, where they had error boundaries.

23
00:01:20.397 --> 00:01:24.555
Is basically you're just wrapping your
page or layout an error boundary,

24
00:01:24.555 --> 00:01:26.870
which is like a try catch for components.

25
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.695
Is the best way I can describe, it's
literally a try catch for a component,

26
00:01:29.695 --> 00:01:30.790
which is genius.

27
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.560
So we get those for free.

28
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.250
So let's check it out.

29
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.228
So if I go to the to dues folder
here inside the dashboard,

30
00:01:37.228 --> 00:01:40.464
I can make a loading dot TSX, right?

31
00:01:40.464 --> 00:01:42.314
And I can say this is loading.

32
00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:51.314
And it's gonna return a div
that says loading, like that.

33
00:01:51.314 --> 00:01:58.808
Export default that So we have that.

34
00:01:58.808 --> 00:02:00.635
And then just to demonstrate the loading,

35
00:02:00.635 --> 00:02:02.826
I'm just going to exaggerate
how long this takes.

36
00:02:02.826 --> 00:02:08.507
So I'm just gonna await a promise right
quick on this get data inside of todos.

37
00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:18.899
Let's say two seconds.

38
00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:19.876
That should be good.

39
00:02:23.107 --> 00:02:26.784
So I'm just gonna wait that, you don't
have to add this in if you don't want to

40
00:02:26.784 --> 00:02:29.032
be dramatic, but
I'm just just waiting that.

41
00:02:29.032 --> 00:02:30.865
So we get that two seconds there.

42
00:02:30.865 --> 00:02:33.260
We have our loading file
it just says loading.

43
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.456
Let's see what happens.

44
00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:39.921
So now if I go back Now
refresh as you can see,

45
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:43.352
it's loading, it's loading and then boom,
two seconds later, it shows up, right?

46
00:02:43.352 --> 00:02:44.535
We got that for free.

47
00:02:44.535 --> 00:02:45.592
All we had to do was just make a file.

48
00:02:47.623 --> 00:02:49.310
Right, and it's instant.

49
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.710
So I think that's pretty cool, right?

50
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.633
And the loading files or
client components, so

51
00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:00.610
you can do client things in here.

52
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.910
I think by default they are,
I don't think you need to do this.

53
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.134
I don't think this even changes anything,
because they have to be client components,

54
00:03:07.134 --> 00:03:09.370
because you're already
there on the client.

55
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.327
If it had to go make a round
trip to the server to show,

56
00:03:12.327 --> 00:03:14.022
that would defeat the point.

57
00:03:14.022 --> 00:03:16.715
It just swaps it out, so.

58
00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:20.978
And the same is true for error.

59
00:03:20.978 --> 00:03:23.639
So if we go and
make an error one like this.

60
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.975
Pretty much it's gonna
copy the same thing.

61
00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:30.458
We don't need to use clients.

62
00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:35.333
Call this the ErrorUI.

63
00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:39.350
I can't call it error capital E,
cuz that's already a thing in JavaScript.

64
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.930
So I'll just say Error here, ErrorUI and
just do something like, oops.

65
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.230
Right, so we got that.

66
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.652
And then I'm just gonna make this
thing error and best way to do that,

67
00:03:49.652 --> 00:03:51.370
my example is just to call reject.

68
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.647
So I'm just gonna reject this like that.

69
00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:00.894
So after two seconds, it should load and

70
00:04:00.894 --> 00:04:04.816
then it should freak out so
let's see what happens.

71
00:04:04.816 --> 00:04:05.849
What is this.

72
00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:08.808
What do you want?

73
00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.943
I think it does want that it wants
me to put the use client here.

74
00:04:16.334 --> 00:04:22.637
There we go cool and what is this words?

75
00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:23.578
I misspelled it.

76
00:04:23.578 --> 00:04:24.870
There we go.

77
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.030
Okay, cool, so it's loading.

78
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.370
And then, oops, we get an error.

79
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.627
All right, so we get that for free.

80
00:04:31.627 --> 00:04:34.134
Just by making two files don't
really have to do anything.

81
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:41.188
Yeah, you could do this and react yourself
but setting this up [SOUND] been there.

82
00:04:41.188 --> 00:04:42.020
It's a lot of work.
