1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.970
All right, every one.

2
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.870
How's it going?

3
00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.030
Everyone from around the world.

4
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.021
My name is Scott Moss.

5
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:08.751
And I'm going to be your instructor
today for our version three of Next.js,

6
00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:14.340
which, if you've taken the last version,
you know we recently just updated it.

7
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.660
But Next.js also just had
some really big updates too.

8
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.475
So I felt like it was worth and

9
00:00:19.475 --> 00:00:24.023
the updates were substantial enough
to do another one versus waiting.

10
00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:26.640
So I wanted to get that out me and
the Frontend Masters team.

11
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.020
So that's what we're doing.

12
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.910
Cool, okay.

13
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.790
Well a little bit about me.

14
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.481
My name is Scott obviously.

15
00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:35.841
I've been an engineer for
a little over ten years now.

16
00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:40.402
Before that I was in the Navy where
I fixed helicopters stationed down in

17
00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:41.168
San Diego.

18
00:00:41.168 --> 00:00:42.500
It's a beautiful job.

19
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.906
I don't know how I got so lucky.

20
00:00:43.906 --> 00:00:48.579
But yeah, engineer for almost ten years
now, worked at tons of companies up and

21
00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:49.430
down the Bay.

22
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.070
The last engineering job
I held was at Netflix.

23
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.890
I was a senior engineer there.

24
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.120
Did all types of stuff at Netflix.

25
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.040
Worked on the Smart TV app.

26
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.930
Netflix lets you do whatever you want,
so I did whatever I wanted.

27
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.090
It was really cool.

28
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.288
But now currently I'm an investor at
a firm in San Francisco where my job is

29
00:01:06.288 --> 00:01:07.928
basically like Shark Tank.

30
00:01:07.928 --> 00:01:11.905
I just, I take pitches all
day like technical pitches.

31
00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:15.681
So it's really cool to do a lot of AI
pitches and API Dev tool pitches and

32
00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:16.710
things like that.

33
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.312
But still spend a lot of my free time
writing curriculum, writing code,

34
00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:24.180
building things on the side,
keeping my technical skills sharp.

35
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.200
One, because it's just
a personal passion of mine.

36
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.768
But two, it actually helps me with
my job to be up to date on these

37
00:01:28.768 --> 00:01:31.520
technologies when I'm
talking with these founders.

38
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.190
That way I know what
they're talking about.

39
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.100
And I'm not fooled or
tricked or anything like that.

40
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.738
So I also love things like,
games, sneakers, basketball,

41
00:01:40.738 --> 00:01:42.710
anime, stuff like that.

42
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.054
So if you're into some of that stuff and

43
00:01:44.054 --> 00:01:46.140
want to connect around any of that,
let me know.

44
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.138
But other than that, I'm just your typical
engineer that just stays up till 4 o'clock

45
00:01:51.138 --> 00:01:53.660
in the morning writing code for no reason.

46
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.820
So that's kind of where I'm at.

47
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.500
So yeah, this course is,
it's in the title, right?

48
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.018
It's an intro to Next.js V3.

49
00:02:05.018 --> 00:02:09.878
We have had so many updates over
the last six months that have come out

50
00:02:09.878 --> 00:02:12.870
to Next.js in the form of Next.js 13.

51
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.408
I think when it first came out,
when Next.js 13 first came out,

52
00:02:16.408 --> 00:02:20.643
there were a lot of like beta features
that people just weren't sure if they were

53
00:02:20.643 --> 00:02:24.266
gonna get brought into Maine and
the APIs are gonna remain the same.

54
00:02:24.266 --> 00:02:27.940
But now they're no longer beta,
they're part of the actual framework.

55
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.640
So we're gonna be covering a lot of that.

56
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.962
And just to put it out there,
Next.js has tons and

57
00:02:35.962 --> 00:02:40.543
tons and tons of functionality features.

58
00:02:40.543 --> 00:02:43.892
We just won't be able to
cover all them today.

59
00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:44.550
It's just impossible.

60
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.758
It will take like a week to
cover everything in Next.js and

61
00:02:47.758 --> 00:02:50.376
that's as you'll see most
of it is actually for

62
00:02:50.376 --> 00:02:54.834
more advanced apps when you go into
production and collaboration and teamwork.

63
00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:57.590
But the foundational stuff,
that's what we're going to be covering.

64
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.993
So you'll have the foundational stuff.

65
00:02:59.993 --> 00:03:01.778
Next.js has really good docs.

66
00:03:01.778 --> 00:03:03.947
So you can go follow on the docs and
we'll take a look at the docs and

67
00:03:03.947 --> 00:03:04.830
go over things like that.

68
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.497
But I just want to make sure you have a
really good foundation on like pretty much

69
00:03:08.497 --> 00:03:11.910
everything you would need for
any Next.js app no matter what you do.

70
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.100
And go for it from there.

71
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.520
The other caveat is that with Next.js 13,
there's a new way to make a Next.js app.

72
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.440
And we'll see what that version is.

73
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.650
But the previous version,
there was an old way to make the app.

74
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.874
So if you are part of a team
using the old version of Next.js,

75
00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.350
some of that stuff is not
gonna be taught here.

76
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.610
Because I'm only teaching
the new stuff going forward.

77
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.880
Because that's what
the Next.js team is pushing.

78
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.220
So we'll talk about
some of the older ways.

79
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.680
But we won't be demonstrating.

80
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.640
And there's no curriculum built around it.

81
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.398
I'm totally down to have a conversation
about if you have experienced working on

82
00:03:44.398 --> 00:03:47.603
the older version and you have some
questions of how it might relate to

83
00:03:47.603 --> 00:03:51.050
the newer version, let me know and
we can we can go over it.

84
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.080
Cool, so a couple things if you go
to the notes, should get you here.

85
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.772
It's a, so these notes are,
honestly, mostly for you all,

86
00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:01.470
if you've ever taken my
courses you know that

87
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.740
I just prefer just to hop in editor and
just make mistakes and do it live.

88
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.140
That's just kinda my style.

89
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.730
I just have to do it that way,
I can't follow along.

90
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.226
So these ones are mostly for you all, but

91
00:04:13.226 --> 00:04:15.670
everything that we'll be
covering will be in here.

92
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.000
You see I have two links here.

93
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.274
One is just a link to shortcut
you to the Next.js documentation,

94
00:04:20.274 --> 00:04:21.860
which we'll be referencing.

95
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.356
I hope you'll be referencing because
again, there's just so much amount of

96
00:04:25.356 --> 00:04:28.920
information in this framework and
we're not gonna cover everything.

97
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.660
But the other one is the actual repos.

98
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.930
If you click on that,
you can go check it out.

99
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.251
Highly recommend using
this to as a reference for

100
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:38.521
the code that we'll be writing.

101
00:04:38.521 --> 00:04:42.205
If you feel like you might be falling
behind, if you just want to look ahead,

102
00:04:42.205 --> 00:04:46.210
however you wanna reference it,
it's there, it's always gonna be there.

103
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.120
So take a look at it.

104
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.483
I'll be doing everything from scratch in
this course and I'll probably be doing it

105
00:04:52.483 --> 00:04:56.400
very similar to what's in the repo but
not exactly one for one.

106
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.022
Because I'm just random and

107
00:04:58.022 --> 00:05:01.070
I just do things differently
every time I write code.

108
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.550
I don't remember any of this stuff,
I just do it again.

109
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.640
So that's kind of how my style is.

110
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.436
But yeah, so the other thing I just
wanted to talk about is what I think you

111
00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:14.830
would need to know to get
the best from this course.

112
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.811
So one,
having a good understanding of Node.js.

113
00:05:18.811 --> 00:05:21.179
So that doesn't mean you need
to be an expert at it, but

114
00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:24.936
maybe if you've taken an intro course to
Node.js, that's probably good enough, or

115
00:05:24.936 --> 00:05:29.510
if you've just built the Hello World app
in Node.js, that's probably good enough.

116
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.218
That also includes if you've ever built
any front-end app that uses a framework

117
00:05:33.218 --> 00:05:36.434
like React, or Vue, or Svelte,
because they all use build tools that

118
00:05:36.434 --> 00:05:40.070
are based off Node.js, so
that's probably also good enough.

119
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.710
And then obviously you
need to know JavaScript.

120
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.439
I'll be using TypeScript in the course.

121
00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:46.050
You do not need to know TypeScript.

122
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.700
All the types are optional and
I never used them.

123
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.030
So [LAUGH] you won't even notice it.

124
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.744
But I'm just using TypeScript out of
the box cuz it's just easier to work

125
00:05:53.744 --> 00:05:55.020
with these days.

126
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.307
And then the last thing is, I would say,

127
00:05:57.307 --> 00:06:01.619
probably a decent understanding on what
the difference between servers and

128
00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:06.080
clients and just basic networking
with HTTP and kind of how that works.

129
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.640
Maybe to the point of like, you know how
to make an API call, like that's it.

130
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.847
Anything beyond that I'm not
expecting you to know, TCP and

131
00:06:13.847 --> 00:06:16.250
WebSockets and DNS level things.

132
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.000
Just like I know what API call is.

133
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.750
I know what a server is.

134
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.020
I know what a client is.

135
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.717
Because it's going to get kind of crazy in
here when we talk about some of the new

136
00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:25.190
features.

137
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.220
And I'm very curious
how people react to it.

138
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.560
Because when I saw some of this new stuff,
I was just like, what's going on?

139
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.810
So it's gonna be pretty cool.

140
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.300
Okay, let's just take
a look at the finished app.

141
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.300
I didn't focus on style here.

142
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.590
It's not gonna win any awards,
and that's intentional.

143
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.540
We're focused on functionality.

144
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.950
But basically, it's a to-do app
that's just composed of three things.

145
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.540
So you have a home page where
you can put all your home stuff.

146
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:56.462
We have a documentation page where we can
write documentation about an API that

147
00:06:56.462 --> 00:06:58.490
we're gonna have.

148
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.455
And then the actual app, which is just
a to do app that allows you to like create

149
00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:05.480
to dos and it just list them here for you.

150
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.050
It's basically that.

151
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.616
So it seems simple on the surface,
but if you've ever built a to do app,

152
00:07:09.616 --> 00:07:12.886
you know you can expand that to
create some complicated, I mean,

153
00:07:12.886 --> 00:07:14.410
you can make Evernote [LAUGH].

154
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.117
That's an app.

155
00:07:15.117 --> 00:07:19.510
I don't know about Evernote, it's a thing
but it's a billion dollar company, so

156
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:20.960
it happens.

157
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.795
So we'll be basically be building this
using the latest features from Next.js.

158
00:07:25.795 --> 00:07:29.919
Also we have a full stack course
that I teach using Next.js and

159
00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:33.420
this will literally transition
right over to that.

160
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.707
So in that course we will
actually build a sophisticated,

161
00:07:36.707 --> 00:07:41.134
nicely designed ready to go production
app that you can deploy and hopefully,

162
00:07:41.134 --> 00:07:45.040
my goal with that one is that you'll
be able to use that app every day.

163
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.434
It'll be something that
you actually enjoy.

164
00:07:46.434 --> 00:07:48.590
So that's a more ambitious one.

165
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.145
But you need to know this foundation
before you can do that and

166
00:07:52.145 --> 00:07:53.825
that course is a lot faster.

167
00:07:53.825 --> 00:07:55.544
We moving a lot faster in that course.

168
00:07:55.544 --> 00:07:57.029
We talked about this already but

169
00:07:57.029 --> 00:08:00.450
the last thing here is just like
how to best take this course.

170
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:05.420
So like I said, I'm going to be giving
some high level overview about some topic.

171
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.874
You might see me break away and just like
demonstrate some code about that topic

172
00:08:08.874 --> 00:08:11.240
unrelated to the app that we're making.

173
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.621
And then it'll be like, okay,

174
00:08:12.621 --> 00:08:15.340
now I'm ready to like apply this
to the app that we're making.

175
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.688
So basically what you can do is you can
listen as I'm doing those first two steps,

176
00:08:18.688 --> 00:08:20.360
when I'm giving an overview.

177
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.335
While I'm demonstrating how to
use it in the code, and then for

178
00:08:23.335 --> 00:08:27.210
the third step where we actually apply it,
you can follow along on your machine and

179
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.040
copy it or do it your own way.

180
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.013
Or just feel free to follow along whenever
I'm in editor, but I will be doing a lot

181
00:08:32.013 --> 00:08:34.699
of code that I'm just throwing away
just for demonstration purposes.

182
00:08:34.699 --> 00:08:38.609
But I will let you know which code
is like, I'm just testing this out.

183
00:08:38.609 --> 00:08:40.619
I'm just showing you versus like,
no, this is for the app.

184
00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:41.868
You should pay attention to this.

185
00:08:41.868 --> 00:08:43.619
So you don't have to worry about that.
