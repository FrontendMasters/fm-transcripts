00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.182
I think it's important to talk
about the history of Next.js and

2
00:00:03.182 --> 00:00:04.340
kind of how we got here.

3
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.580
Especially if you're new to engineering,
if you just graduated boot camp,

4
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.580
there's some stuff.

5
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.570
There's some stuff going on here.

6
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.280
So because you might ask yourself,
like, well, isn't React a framework?

7
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.310
Why do I need a framework for a framework?

8
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.670
Right, it's kind of weird, but...

9
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.967
The interesting thing is that like if
you go to the React documentation,

10
00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:28.780
they actually don't recommend
using React by itself anymore.

11
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.920
They actually recommend using
something like Next.js, which is huge.

12
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.520
That just happened this year.

13
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.126
So they recommend using something like
Next.js or any of the other frameworks so.

14
00:00:38.126 --> 00:00:41.988
But anyway, the history of React and
XTS as you know, it may or may not know.

15
00:00:41.988 --> 00:00:46.296
React is just basically a library
that was created by Facebook,

16
00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:48.780
long time ago 2013, 2014.

17
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.327
And then eventually picked up steam
to become pretty much the number one

18
00:00:52.327 --> 00:00:54.320
JavaScript framework out there.

19
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.883
Although I do think there are faster,
better frameworks out there.

20
00:00:58.883 --> 00:01:03.721
I think React is probably still the most
popular one because it just has

21
00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:05.452
the biggest community.

22
00:01:05.452 --> 00:01:11.260
And everything is pretty much based off of
the learnings that React taught everyone.

23
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.650
So like everyone just took that and
improved it.

24
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.770
Had their own opinion.

25
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.661
So it's probably going to be
the most popular one going for

26
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:19.790
it because the community is just crazy.

27
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.710
But it's really just like a library.

28
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.360
It's not really a framework,
in my opinion.

29
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.640
It's just a way for you to build UIs
like it doesn't, it's not complete.

30
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.669
If you ever use something like Angular.

31
00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:35.836
Where Angular is like, all right, you can
build these UIs with these components.

32
00:01:35.836 --> 00:01:39.760
Also, here's a router, also,
here's a testing framework.

33
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.625
Also, here's everything that you ever
need to do everything in Angular,

34
00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:44.720
you don't need to install anything else.

35
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.730
Yeah, React's not that.

36
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.750
React's just like,
here's how you make components.

37
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.390
That's it, right?

38
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.466
They don't even have A complete
state management system.

39
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:56.750
You would have to install something else
like a Redux or something to do that.

40
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.900
They definitely don't have a router.

41
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.980
You would have to install a router.

42
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.315
So, and that's really cool because it
allows you to have that flexibility of

43
00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:04.820
like leve raging things
from the community.

44
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.562
But when you're a big
company with a big team,

45
00:02:06.562 --> 00:02:09.430
the last thing you wanna do is
like go shopping for open source.

46
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.512
And putting your company's resources
back on some random person,

47
00:02:13.512 --> 00:02:16.250
living in a basement, working on a router.

48
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.620
You want it to be backed by a big company.

49
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.200
So you want that assurance.

50
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.000
So that's what bigger companies
would do something like Angular.

51
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.079
So then that kind of created the need for
something like Next.js, where you need it.

52
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.246
A framework for the framework that like
kind of brought all these things in.

53
00:02:32.246 --> 00:02:35.196
And I think what kind of
expedited that was the fact that.

54
00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:38.553
You, there were a lot of advancements
on how you can render react.

55
00:02:38.553 --> 00:02:40.334
So you can render it on the client.

56
00:02:40.334 --> 00:02:41.860
You can render it on a server.

57
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.192
We're going to talk about
some of those things but

58
00:02:44.192 --> 00:02:47.730
building that infrastructure to
do that was incredibly difficult.

59
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.426
I remember when server-side
react came out, and

60
00:02:50.426 --> 00:02:52.680
I was on a team that
had to implement that.

61
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.135
It took us months, it took us
months to figure out how to do it.

62
00:02:55.135 --> 00:02:57.180
Where it's like, now we get it for free.

63
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.100
So that's kind of where Next.js is and,
why it came to the scene.

64
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.558
And now it's like probably
the most heavily adopted,

65
00:03:04.558 --> 00:03:06.870
most useful React framework out there.

66
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.463
And, there are others that kind
of compete with Next.js and

67
00:03:10.463 --> 00:03:15.900
do something similar, but I think
Next.js just has the full package, yeah.

68
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.130
But yeah,
that's the history of React, Next.js.

69
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.644
Also to mention that Versell
is the company behind Next.js,

70
00:03:23.644 --> 00:03:26.021
formerly Zeit, it's not Cart Versell.

71
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:30.385
They're hosting platform and they have
a team dedicated on working on Next.js and

72
00:03:30.385 --> 00:03:33.290
I think they're doing a really good job.

73
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.740
But so
are all the other frameworks out there.

74
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.360
I think all the other frameworks
are doing really great.

75
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.330
It's just, yeah, this company
is crushing it, in my opinion.

76
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.930
Yeah, any questions about that history of
React, Next.js, frameworks in general?

77
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.499
If you just went back 10 years,

78
00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:48.370
it wasn't too long before we
didn't even have frameworks.

79
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.140
I remember Backbone.js
was the first framework.

80
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.410
But before that,
everybody just used jQuery.

81
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.170
And yeah,
part of me wants to go back to that.

82
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.420
But the other part of me is just like,
man, there was no order there.

83
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.280
But it was also very simple.

84
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.450
It was a simple time, so, I don't know.

85
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.140
But there are some really cool frameworks
out there that kind of feel like that.

86
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.365
I like QuickJS, that one kind of
reminds me of the jQuery days, but

87
00:04:12.365 --> 00:04:15.690
with more structure and
speed and things like that.

88
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.600
So that's a really cool
framework to check out.

89
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.100
I think we have a quick JS course
here at Frontend Masters, right?

90
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

91
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.473
&gt;&gt; Misko
&gt;&gt; Misko yeah, the creator of Quick JS,

92
00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:25.750
also the creator of Angular.

93
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.420
Very smart guy.
