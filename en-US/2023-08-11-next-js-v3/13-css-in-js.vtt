00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.663
For this, I mean, there's a long
list of CSS and JavaScript, right?

2
00:00:06.663 --> 00:00:10.016
I can't even begin to cover it all,
there's just so many.

3
00:00:10.016 --> 00:00:13.935
But I would say some of the some of
the most popular ones are probably style

4
00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:17.030
components, emotion,
if you've ever heard of those.

5
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.102
So I wrote an example of
how to do style components.

6
00:00:21.102 --> 00:00:21.914
With that, and

7
00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:26.049
I'm not gonna write this down because
we're not gonna use style components.

8
00:00:26.049 --> 00:00:29.152
But I think it's interesting just to show
you all the work you need to do to get

9
00:00:29.152 --> 00:00:30.282
style components to work.

10
00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:33.231
So basically, to do CSS and JavaScript,

11
00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:38.807
because of the nature of how everything
is rendered on the server in Next.js.

12
00:00:38.807 --> 00:00:42.801
You have to do somewhat of a setup to
ensure that actually works through

13
00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:45.115
the server and then through the client.

14
00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:47.438
So there's a lot of things you need to do.

15
00:00:47.438 --> 00:00:51.938
And this just kind of demonstrates
all those things that you need to do,

16
00:00:51.938 --> 00:00:55.238
it's kinda tedious just to
set up some JavaScript or

17
00:00:55.238 --> 00:01:00.276
some CSS functionality on the client side,
and have it work on the server side.

18
00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:02.509
So I actually tend to avoid this but

19
00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:07.361
I have this here as a reference if you
wanna use it it involves a lot of stuff.

20
00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:09.965
But basically rendering
a stylesheet on a server and

21
00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:14.049
making sure that it's appropriate, and
it works as it's being downloaded, and

22
00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:15.545
different things like that.

23
00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:20.481
Inserting that stylesheet manually
yourself through a hook is

24
00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:26.015
something that you have to do But

25
00:01:26.015 --> 00:01:28.873
maybe you might have to do this one day,
so there you go.

26
00:01:28.873 --> 00:01:32.603
There's something called
a StyleSheetManager that you get from

27
00:01:32.603 --> 00:01:35.857
StyledComponents, and
this use server inserted HTML,

28
00:01:35.857 --> 00:01:38.042
which is exactly what it sounds like.

29
00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:42.108
I should take HTML from a server and
inject it somewhere.

30
00:01:42.108 --> 00:01:43.702
So in this case, a StyleSheet.

31
00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:49.174
So it's kinda tedious, but
that's what you have to do.

32
00:01:49.174 --> 00:01:50.797
Any questions on styling?

33
00:01:50.797 --> 00:01:52.681
There's also more that
I'm not gonna cover,

34
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:55.935
because I don't think you'll ever use
them, but I guess it's worth listing.

35
00:01:55.935 --> 00:02:00.801
So you have style.jsx, which is something
that the Next.js team, I think, made,

36
00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:02.708
actually, or at least for sale.

37
00:02:02.708 --> 00:02:07.984
And it basically has a pretty similar
setup, because it's CSS and JS.

38
00:02:07.984 --> 00:02:11.851
And then did they not
have an example of it?

39
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:13.141
They have an example of it.

40
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:17.876
But basically it's like you can do,
I wish I showed an example of it.

41
00:02:17.876 --> 00:02:21.355
You can do, let me show you.

42
00:02:21.355 --> 00:02:24.547
You can like write the JSX,
like as a component in a string almost,

43
00:02:24.547 --> 00:02:25.516
it's kinda weird.

44
00:02:25.516 --> 00:02:28.070
So it looks like, its like this, right?

45
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.793
Yeah, like a style tag,
where you can write JSX.

46
00:02:30.793 --> 00:02:33.154
And inside of that you can do the CSS.

47
00:02:33.154 --> 00:02:35.595
So I don't know that feels funky to me.

48
00:02:35.595 --> 00:02:37.051
Probably you won't do that.

49
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:40.611
But you could do it if you want to,
it works, I guess.

50
00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:43.777
I don't think you'll see
a lot of this in the world.

51
00:02:43.777 --> 00:02:47.151
Also, I think this was created at
a different time where people did

52
00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:51.139
different things, it seems like this
hasn't been updated in a while either.

53
00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.935
At least out of the source code,
source code is updated eight months ago.

54
00:02:53.935 --> 00:02:59.718
So you got that, you also have,
what's another one?

55
00:02:59.718 --> 00:03:03.805
I've never heard of Tamagui,
but seems cool.

56
00:03:03.805 --> 00:03:08.046
But then yeah, here's emotion,
here's material, here's chakra,

57
00:03:08.046 --> 00:03:09.304
chakra's a big one.

58
00:03:09.304 --> 00:03:11.473
It links me to an issue, so
I already know there's a problem,

59
00:03:11.473 --> 00:03:12.403
I'm not gonna look at it.

60
00:03:12.403 --> 00:03:13.889
So-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

61
00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.493
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It linked me to an issues.

62
00:03:16.493 --> 00:03:18.111
So we just we're not even gonna go look.

63
00:03:18.111 --> 00:03:21.133
So this is why I just stay away
from CSS and JS in general.

64
00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:25.281
What Next.js is just like, unless you
got a really good reason to do it,

65
00:03:25.281 --> 00:03:27.596
I highly recommend not doing CSS and JS.

66
00:03:27.596 --> 00:03:32.038
Just either use style sheets or
write the CSS yourself with tags or

67
00:03:32.038 --> 00:03:33.589
something like that.

68
00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:36.118
I personally like to use something like,

69
00:03:36.118 --> 00:03:40.967
I can't even think of the name of it right
now, cuz I haven't used it in a while.

70
00:03:40.967 --> 00:03:42.605
But because I've been using Tailwind.

71
00:03:42.605 --> 00:03:45.271
Tailwind is probably my favorite,
but there's another one.

72
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:46.839
Let me see if I can
think of the name of it.

73
00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:48.329
I know ThemeUI uses it.

74
00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:53.557
So ThemeUI uses, they basically hijack

75
00:03:53.557 --> 00:03:58.428
the, See they have an example of it.

76
00:03:58.428 --> 00:04:02.440
They hijack the JSX parser and
allow you to,

77
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.115
there you go,
they allow you to basically hijack.

78
00:04:07.115 --> 00:04:09.540
They allow you to tell the parser inside,

79
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.562
like the bundler that's bundling your JSX,
whether it's babble or

80
00:04:13.562 --> 00:04:17.604
something like that, to say, hey,
use this JSX compiler instead.

81
00:04:17.604 --> 00:04:22.147
And this JSX compiler adds a prop to
every single component called SX,

82
00:04:22.147 --> 00:04:24.842
which is basically like a style prop, but

83
00:04:24.842 --> 00:04:28.626
a little more dynamic, and
then you can style it that way.

84
00:04:28.626 --> 00:04:30.469
That's probably my preferred
way to style components.

85
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:34.888
So typically, I only work with component
libraries that have this built into it,

86
00:04:34.888 --> 00:04:36.754
that you can just dial it this way.

87
00:04:36.754 --> 00:04:40.374
And then that way, I can change whatever
modifications that they might have had.

88
00:04:40.374 --> 00:04:42.507
So this is typically what I look for.

89
00:04:42.507 --> 00:04:45.785
I see this as a standard now,
it's like you see in the SX property.

90
00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:49.042
And you can see right here,
this is them overriding the compiler,

91
00:04:49.042 --> 00:04:50.451
doing something like this.

92
00:04:50.451 --> 00:04:55.978
So pretty cool, I like it,
that's probably my preferred way.

93
00:04:55.978 --> 00:05:00.071
If I'm not using something like tailwind,
which is probably what I'm using, okay?

94
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.681
Cool, any questions on that?

95
00:05:07.967 --> 00:05:08.652
Yes?

96
00:05:08.652 --> 00:05:13.054
&gt;&gt; This isn't CSS specific but
it kinda gets to file structures and

97
00:05:13.054 --> 00:05:14.368
different names.

98
00:05:14.368 --> 00:05:16.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; How do you incorporate, like,

99
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.797
testing files into this file structure?

100
00:05:18.797 --> 00:05:21.859
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think when thinking about
testing files, it comes to two things.

101
00:05:21.859 --> 00:05:27.053
One, the same as before, it comes down
to what convention you wanna adopt,

102
00:05:27.053 --> 00:05:30.804
underscore not putting a page or
just bringing it out.

103
00:05:30.804 --> 00:05:33.532
You can do that, you can also just put
a test in every single one of these

104
00:05:33.532 --> 00:05:34.976
directories and and that will work.

105
00:05:34.976 --> 00:05:38.758
So that's one thing to consider is it's
like kind of whatever you see fit.

106
00:05:38.758 --> 00:05:42.838
The other thing is considers what tool
you're using and how it looks for

107
00:05:42.838 --> 00:05:43.795
testing files.

108
00:05:43.795 --> 00:05:47.276
So some tools prefer you to have like
a testing folder where it looks for

109
00:05:47.276 --> 00:05:49.754
things, some tools like
you just give us paths and

110
00:05:49.754 --> 00:05:52.722
will give us a glob we will go
find all those files for you..

111
00:05:52.722 --> 00:05:54.306
So I think it depends on the tool.

112
00:05:54.306 --> 00:05:59.642
I think most tools, probably like Jest or

113
00:05:59.642 --> 00:06:08.039
Vitest, I think that's the one
I've seen people using lately.

114
00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:11.592
They don't really care where you put it,
because you can give it a glob, right?

115
00:06:11.592 --> 00:06:16.257
You can tell it where to test and
how to test things.

116
00:06:16.257 --> 00:06:18.210
So I don't think there's a right way.

117
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.346
Me personally, I just create a test
folder and put all my tests in there.

118
00:06:21.346 --> 00:06:26.328
I used to like co-locating all my
tests into like the actual thing

119
00:06:26.328 --> 00:06:27.875
that I'm testing.

120
00:06:27.875 --> 00:06:31.150
I used to write all my code that way but
now I don't like,

121
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.847
I think I prefer to see things separated
by functionality, then by like topic.

122
00:06:35.847 --> 00:06:41.735
It's like this is everything about
the blog, so for the blog css here,

123
00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:47.811
over the blog page, the blog test,
the blog storied book, for all that here.

124
00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:51.129
I'm kinda in the other boat
now where I'm just like, no,

125
00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:55.272
all style here, all pages here,
all tests here, all story books here.

126
00:06:55.272 --> 00:06:58.935
I'd rather see it that way
because I feel like it just gets,

127
00:06:58.935 --> 00:07:03.701
I feel like you're almost, it's rare
in my opinion that you're looking for

128
00:07:03.701 --> 00:07:08.248
everything about one topic where in
reality, I think at least the way that

129
00:07:08.248 --> 00:07:12.539
I build stuff, I'm just like,
I'm making all the pages right now.

130
00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:15.724
I'm writing all the tests right now,
I'm not going writing all the tests for

131
00:07:15.724 --> 00:07:16.413
this one thing.

132
00:07:16.413 --> 00:07:19.668
So having to like switch between all these
directories to find all the test files is

133
00:07:19.668 --> 00:07:20.858
like annoying to me, right?

134
00:07:20.858 --> 00:07:22.451
To see them all at one directory.

135
00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:23.705
So this is how my brain works.

136
00:07:23.705 --> 00:07:26.386
But I can see like on a team,
where it's like broken outs like this team

137
00:07:26.386 --> 00:07:28.893
works on this, this team works on that,
this team works on that.

138
00:07:28.893 --> 00:07:32.906
It's probably better to separate them into
their own folders of like topics here's

139
00:07:32.906 --> 00:07:36.876
this one folder, there's one team works
on it, everything they need is in there.

140
00:07:36.876 --> 00:07:40.562
And there's other folders this whole team
works on and everything they need is in

141
00:07:40.562 --> 00:07:43.992
there versus it being spread across
folders of different functionality.

142
00:07:43.992 --> 00:07:48.982
So I don't think there's a right or wrong
way, but it just comes out to preferences.

143
00:07:48.982 --> 00:07:50.332
I've just been doing this for

144
00:07:50.332 --> 00:07:53.140
so long that this is just how I
like to do it to save me time, so.
