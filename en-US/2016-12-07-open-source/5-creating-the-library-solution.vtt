[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:06.568
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Let's quickly review the
solution so we're all on the same page.

3
00:00:06.568 --> 00:00:09.907
So what we're doing here,
actually, I'm gonna go ahead and

4
00:00:09.907 --> 00:00:14.406
check out the next branch, and we'll
review that solution, because that's what

5
00:00:14.406 --> 00:00:18.730
we're gonna have going forward,
cuz it might've been a slightly different.

6
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.300
Yeah, of course, use strict, because we
gotta do that when we're just in ES5 land,

7
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.590
although this is Node 6, so
we're actually in ES6 land here, but yeah.

8
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.760
[COUGH] So a unique random array, we're
pulling that from the unique random array

9
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.870
module, which was basically its whole
purpose is to take an array and

10
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.670
give you back a function you can call
to get a random item out of that array.

11
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.446
So this is micro-libraries to the max, but

12
00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:51.022
it's nice because now we don't have
to test of our functionality around

13
00:00:51.022 --> 00:00:54.934
a function to get a random item
out of an array, which is cool.

14
00:00:54.934 --> 00:01:02.090
Then we also get starWarsNames from
the .json file, our starwars-names.json.

15
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.820
So this is all running in node, we're not
doing anything with the browser yet, and

16
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.240
so we can just pull that
right from the file system.

17
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.980
And then we export an object with an all
property and a random property so

18
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.070
that we can use those, and then by running
node, we can simply require("_/src,

19
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.230
which will default to the index,
and then we'll say random, and

20
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.020
we get a random Star Wars name, and we
can say all, and get all the characters.

21
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.878
So that is that for
actually creating the library.

22
00:01:35.878 --> 00:01:39.910
We're not gonna add any
more functionality, really.

23
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.970
Well when we start transplanting with ES6,
then we'll start playing

24
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.640
around with some ES6 features, but,
yeah, for now this is pretty much it.

25
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.410
Maybe a little anticlimactic, but
it's a macro-library, so there you.

26
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.590
I'm not teaching you how to
make a Star Wars names library,

27
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.599
I'm teaching you how to make a library,
so hopefully this is sufficient.
