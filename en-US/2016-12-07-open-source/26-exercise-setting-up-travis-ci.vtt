00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.033
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:05.720
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: We're gonna go ahead and
move on to the next bit.

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.050
So mine is gitHubNames, and
I hacked together something on my

4
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.820
following page for
the people that I follow on gitHub.

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.255
So now I have all of those names
in here for my gitHubNames.

6
00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:21.740
We're sure it's kind of fun.

7
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.010
So yeah, let's go ahead and
set up a Travis build for our repo.

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.200
That's the next step for us.

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.930
Actually let me go ahead and
I'll add my Github names.

10
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.569
Yeah, adding all domains,
and we'll push that up.

11
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.750
And now, actually if I pop up in my fork,
I can look at the source,

12
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.810
look at my github-names, and then there
they are right there, so perfect.

13
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.609
So the part that we skipped here
was this Create Travis.yml file.

14
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.530
And so this is pretty much it for
this whole thing.

15
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.820
Is we're just adding a Travis.yml file and
pretty much you can copy this and

16
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.570
I'll explain what these properties are,
why they're useful.

17
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:21.800
But before we do that though, I'm going to
show you how to setup Travis on your Repo.

18
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:29.107
So if you go to travis-ci.org, then you
should be able to log in with GitHub.

19
00:01:29.107 --> 00:01:35.220
Actually, I'll go to
travis-ci.org in incognito mode.

20
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.080
So this is what you'll see first, and
then you can click sign up with GitHub and

21
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.700
it'll take you to authenticate and
stuff, and it'll be great.

22
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.650
And once you're authenticated you'll
have this My Repositories thing here and

23
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.390
it's a big long list, well once you
have a bunch of repositories on Travis,

24
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.980
you'll have a bunch there.

25
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.340
You'll also see this plus sign,
click Add New Repository.

26
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.956
And you'll just Cmd + F or Ctrl + F to
find your GitHub names or whatever.

27
00:02:06.956 --> 00:02:09.677
You may have to have it synced
to your account, right.

28
00:02:09.677 --> 00:02:11.570
I synced it 16 hours ago.

29
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.380
That sometimes takes a little bit of time.

30
00:02:17.593 --> 00:02:24.042
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: [NOISE] So yeah, this is
travis-ci.org/profile/ your user name,

31
00:02:24.042 --> 00:02:30.069
and you'll have access to any repos
you have access to on GitHub.

32
00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.367
And we'll say githubnames,
it's still not on here.

33
00:02:35.367 --> 00:02:36.899
You know what it might be?

34
00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:41.920
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Is for mine it's under
the JavaScript error organization.

35
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.090
So for yours,
you should be able to find it.

36
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.370
But I'll turn that on.

37
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.000
Then I'll go to my Settings,
right next to the switch.

38
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.170
There's that Settings link.

39
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.220
And there's some general settings.

40
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.910
One thing that I like to turn on is,
I only want it

41
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.460
to attempt to build if there's a
travis.yml present, so I'll turn that on.

42
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.943
And, yeah, pretty much everything else,
I'd like to have build pushes,

43
00:03:08.943 --> 00:03:11.197
so whenever you push, it'll build.

44
00:03:11.197 --> 00:03:15.450
It'll build pull requests,
I like to have my pull requests built.

45
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.810
And yeah, there are integrations that
happen with Git-Hub when you have that

46
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.030
turned on, so that's cool.

47
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.190
Environment variables will matter when we
start automating our releases with Travis,

48
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.430
and so we'll have those,

49
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.410
we'll actually use a tool that will
add some for us at little bit later.

50
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.480
But yeah, right now we can look at
current, we'll see there are no build for

51
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.490
this repository, we need to push
a connect and then now kick off to built.

52
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.580
So, if you value like push everything
you don't know what else to change

53
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.830
an then sometimes just go in your README
and update something, let's say like,

54
00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.480
this is my following or
Is the people I follow as of today.

55
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.080
So just make any random change,
commit docs update, and then push that.

56
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.776
And if you have everything
wired together properly,

57
00:04:13.776 --> 00:04:17.452
then after just a little while,
this should update.

58
00:04:17.452 --> 00:04:21.710
If you are impatient like I am,
then you can click on build history and

59
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.410
that normally updates a little quicker
than current does and hit refresh and

60
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.220
stuff if you don't trust
their web sockets.

61
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.248
Let's see.

62
00:04:37.436 --> 00:04:39.990
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Is anybody on this
page waiting for their build to start?

63
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.310
Anybody have questions?

64
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.370
We have questions in here?

65
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.080
&gt;&gt; Student: Did you make that
Travis.yml or did I miss that?

66
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.470
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: My goodness.

67
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.250
Thank you.

68
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.820
You're right.
I didn't make the Travisyml.

69
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.490
That was the problem.

70
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:54.310
Dear.

71
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.070
It's been a long day.

72
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.340
Okay, so, we're gonna go ahead and

73
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.020
view that travis yml,
look at the raw and copy that.

74
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.870
So if you're on my slides, remember
that's just click on this right here and

75
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.018
that'll take you to that
travis yml quick view in raw.

76
00:05:13.018 --> 00:05:17.815
And copy that then you'll
make the Travis.yml file at

77
00:05:17.815 --> 00:05:21.290
the root of your project Travis.yml.

78
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.040
Just paste it right in there.

79
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.560
And actually I'm gonna go ahead and

80
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.500
explain what this is doing
while Travis is building.

81
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.938
So let me just commit that to travis.yml.

82
00:05:33.938 --> 00:05:38.310
Whoops, gotta add that first, git status.

83
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.480
You'll see a new file and
then we'll commit tha and

84
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.010
push it, cool.

85
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.523
Okay so while that's.

86
00:05:48.523 --> 00:05:51.470
Uh-oh, dear.

87
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.740
I made a boo-boo.

88
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.240
Here we go.

89
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.970
Fix travis.yml.

90
00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.350
Forgot to save my travis file
after I pasted stuff in.

91
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.970
Okay, so

92
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:07.840
now I actually that first build totally
broke because there's no contents in that.

93
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.510
But it's been fixed and
now it's running and

94
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.620
we can actually click right to Build#2.

95
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.770
And as soon as that gets started,
we'll see the output.

96
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.330
This is new, View config.

97
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:27.020
It's kind of, I'm not sure what that does
but maybe it'll be interesting someday.

98
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.530
But yeah, while that's going,
let me explain what's going on here.

99
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.390
sudo, we just don't need it,
so we turned it off.

100
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.690
It's kind of a protected thing.

101
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:42.300
I actually don't even know of a situation
where you do, so your mileage may vary.

102
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.355
Language is gonna be node_js, our cache.

103
00:06:46.355 --> 00:06:50.520
So when you specify a cache so that our
builds don't take forever, we don't change

104
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.490
our node modules all that frequently and
so we can cache the known modules.

105
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.570
It's really easy from the Travis UI
to delete the cache and then we can

106
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:06.358
push the have that, like, rerun the build
with and reinstall the modules.

107
00:07:06.358 --> 00:07:10.645
We're just gonna build this on Node
6 just to keep things simple, but

108
00:07:10.645 --> 00:07:14.133
if you wanted to build this
on multiple versions of Node,

109
00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:16.984
then you could say 0.12.0 and 4 and 6.

110
00:07:16.984 --> 00:07:20.980
Those are the actually the three that
I normally care about building on.

111
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.440
For lots of my projects, but
we're just gonna make it simpler and

112
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.040
do node version 6.

113
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.280
Then for branches we only
want to build master branch,

114
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:35.250
like we have a ton of branches on here and
as we're making working in progress staff,

115
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.240
we don't care to build
them as we're going.

116
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.500
By default though this will
also build pull requests.

117
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.261
So if you make a pull
request to your own repo or

118
00:07:44.261 --> 00:07:49.276
somebody else makes a pull request to your
repo it will still build pull requests,

119
00:07:49.276 --> 00:07:52.268
so we're only going to
build the master branch.

120
00:07:52.268 --> 00:07:56.985
If you don't like receiving email
notifications every single time your build

121
00:07:56.985 --> 00:07:58.415
is done, then do this,

122
00:07:58.415 --> 00:08:02.988
this will still email you if the build
breaks when it was successful before,

123
00:08:02.988 --> 00:08:07.580
and then it'll email you when there's
a change in the status of your build.

124
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.620
And then the scripts that we're
gonna run is our validate script.

125
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.390
So this runs the test,
the linting, and the build.

126
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.630
And so if we go back here,
it looks like it's running.

127
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.540
And we've got our latest node version,
we've ran npn-install,

128
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.680
we're running the validate right now.

129
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.043
All the builds are running in parallel,
we've got that good output,

130
00:08:26.043 --> 00:08:27.670
we've got our test.

131
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:32.290
And we're done, whew, all finished.

132
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:33.290
And we have a green build.

133
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.520
So yeah, and then if I refresh the page,

134
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:42.340
we'll get that badge is It's still
unknown, so now I'm not sure why.

135
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.910
Maybe that's cached or something.

136
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:46.380
But soon it'll say that
the build has passed.

137
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.310
And then you could put a badge on your
README and look like all the other

138
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:53.280
hipster awesome open source projects
out there that have green builds.

139
00:08:55.250 --> 00:09:00.759
Cool, raise your hand in the chat or
here if you have a green build.

140
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.260
Yeah, all right.

141
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.570
Got one.

142
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.600
Anyone waiting on their
build to run still?

143
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:09.910
Yeah?

144
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:10.990
Anybody give up?

145
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.440
Sorry, [LAUGH] hopefully
you're viewing this later,

146
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.890
you can figure out what went wrong.

147
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.301
And we got some people on the chat, yeah.

148
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:26.924
And Travis is not recognizing Ivan's repo.

149
00:09:30.194 --> 00:09:34.190
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: By recognizing,
do you mean not showing it?

150
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:38.960
I'm not sure what you mean by that,
after refreshing.

151
00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.190
Yeah, sorry,
still not sure what you mean by that.

152
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.860
We can maybe chat a little bit later.

153
00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.053
Anybody else in here get a green build?

154
00:09:48.053 --> 00:09:49.402
Hopefully some.

155
00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:53.499
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: I'll wait for
just a little bit.

156
00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:57.300
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Sorry, Ivan.

157
00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:07.396
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: So if you're on Travis
and you're not able to find your

158
00:10:07.396 --> 00:10:12.101
repository, make sure that your
fork is under your user or

159
00:10:12.101 --> 00:10:16.520
the user that you're looking at right now.

160
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.370
And make sure that when you hover over
this sync account that it tells you that

161
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:25.920
it was last synced within the time
that you created your repo.

162
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.630
And if you forked it to a different
organization that you belong to, or

163
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:35.530
something, just click on that org and
you might find it from there.

164
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:41.983
Otherwise, I really don't
know what to tell you.

165
00:10:43.553 --> 00:10:45.609
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Honestly
it should be working so

166
00:10:45.609 --> 00:10:48.510
it looks like there's
a red alert on Travis.

167
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:52.941
It looks like they're investigating
VM booting issues for public and

168
00:10:52.941 --> 00:10:54.476
private Linux builds.

169
00:10:54.476 --> 00:10:55.910
I think we're probably safe.

170
00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.140
So we've got a couple people running.

171
00:11:01.476 --> 00:11:05.700
Yeah, so let me just show
the Travis.yml again for Mike.

172
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.900
Missed the node thing.

173
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.590
Can I just add node
versions in an array there?

174
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.570
So yeah, if you wanted to
have multiple node versions,

175
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.060
this is YAML,
which is a little bit different.

176
00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:21.808
The array kind of works like items
in a list, so it'd be 0.12.0.

177
00:11:21.808 --> 00:11:25.380
And four and five even and six and

178
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:31.340
you can also do IOJS and
stuff but like don't do IOJS.

179
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.370
Like why would you do that now?

180
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:38.230
So the challenge with this
though is each one of

181
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:42.170
these versions is going
to run the same stuff and

182
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:46.780
once we start adding like release
capabilities to our Travis stuff,

183
00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:51.900
than yeah it's going to cause

184
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:56.450
some issues with like each one of them is
gonna try to release at the same time.

185
00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:00.010
And that probably don't
want that to happen.

186
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.936
So there are ways to get around that and
I can show you that at the end.

187
00:12:03.936 --> 00:12:07.970
But just to simplify things a little
bit we'll just do the one version.

188
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:08.870
Mark's got a green.

189
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:15.080
Tim's got a green, and
Ivan's got it going too sweet.

190
00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.180
Anybody else here have a green?

191
00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.066
Green builds anyone?

192
00:12:19.066 --> 00:12:20.670
All right couple.
