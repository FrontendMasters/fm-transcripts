2
00:00:04.055 --> 00:00:05.816
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: First things first here,
for

3
00:00:05.816 --> 00:00:09.712
open source to be considered a open
source it must have a license.

4
00:00:09.712 --> 00:00:14.430
The Opensource.org the organization
responsible for creating the term,

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.450
open source that was their
one of the main stipulations,

6
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.080
is that there is a license
associated with it.

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.080
And there are ten criteria for
that license to meet.

8
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.580
And so that's something that
we're definitely going to add.

9
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.490
There are actually.

10
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.443
You know what we're gonna do,
I'll go to opensource.org/osd.

11
00:00:35.443 --> 00:00:38.250
Stands for Open Source Definition.

12
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.990
So I recommend that you check this out.

13
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.830
And there are, I believe licenses
that you can find on here,

14
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.562
where you can find a whole bunch
of different licenses that fit in

15
00:00:54.562 --> 00:01:00.010
these standards that
the Open Source Definition

16
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.240
enforces them on library licenses.

17
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.920
So the MIT license, I've gone
through some of these licenses they

18
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.310
all have kind of different
different appeals.

19
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.530
I like MIT.

20
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.480
I actually started using MIT, because
I thought it was reference the school.

21
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.740
And I was like, MIT, school with
smart people, I'll just use that.

22
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.620
I have since actually learned what that
license is and I like it, and so I use it.

23
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.670
So yeah, check out what these licenses
are, the restrictions they place on people

24
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.890
using your code and
choose the one that you want.

25
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.750
For this library today,
we're gonna use the MIT license.

26
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.082
But before you publish your own,
you can change it if you want to.

27
00:01:45.082 --> 00:01:50.899
The other thing is a code of conduct,
a CoC.

28
00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.296
So a code of conduct is not
technically required for

29
00:01:54.296 --> 00:01:59.420
an Open Source library, not by
the definition of Open Source anyway.

30
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.880
But I think that it's a really
important part of Open Source,

31
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.250
is having a code of conduct.

32
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.424
I have never had to enforce my code of
conduct on anyone in any of my libraries,

33
00:02:08.424 --> 00:02:10.428
but I think it's because I have one.

34
00:02:10.428 --> 00:02:15.459
And so the Open Source world
can be kind of a scary and

35
00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.849
unkind place at some times and
that's a real tragedy.

36
00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.730
So having a code of conduct that you can
point people to when they're behaving

37
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.412
inappropriately and
making people feel uncomfortable or

38
00:02:29.412 --> 00:02:34.143
just being rude is a good way to deter
people from misbehaving in a community

39
00:02:34.143 --> 00:02:38.220
that you're trying to build
around your Open Source library.

40
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.720
And then finally a README
is really important.

41
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.990
And we'll talk a little bit more
about what you put in the README and

42
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.340
how you communicate
the purpose of your library

43
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.210
when I talk about
community stuff at the end.
