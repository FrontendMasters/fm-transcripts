[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.161 --> 00:00:05.579
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: What
we're going to do now,

3
00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:09.320
we're first going to create
what's called a validate script.

4
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.380
We have two things that
we want to have run.

5
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.880
We want to run both test and linting.

6
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.220
And that like validates that
our project is good to go.

7
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.757
This is something that's really
good to have just in general for

8
00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:26.149
like receiving contributions.

9
00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.790
Is like you say hey, if I go clone
this repo, I make a fork of it,

10
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.740
then clone your fork,
then install the dependencies.

11
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.170
And then run NPM run validate,
and that will run like tests,

12
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.354
and the linting, and whatever.

13
00:00:37.354 --> 00:00:40.640
We're gonna add the build to it
eventually, that way it's really easy for

14
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.390
people to know before
they start contributing.

15
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.340
Whether they have their
environment set up properly.

16
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.940
It's the same concept behind that
setup script that I gave to you.

17
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.040
Yeah let's go ahead and do that.

18
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.756
Kind of the naive approach to this
would be just to add in your package

19
00:00:58.756 --> 00:01:03.240
JSON in your scripts,
a spelled correctly, validate script.

20
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.950
That runs npm run lint and npm run test.

21
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.280
And that would work great.

22
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.010
npm run validate, so it runs linting
first, then it runs a test and

23
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.650
it's pretty quick.

24
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.810
But I don't know, I like running
things in parallel when I can and

25
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.230
these two things are totally
separate from each other.

26
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.540
One doesn't need to run after the other,
and

27
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.700
so we're going to install
a tool called npm-run-all.

28
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.600
Which you normally just
install in the CLI,

29
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.760
but it should already be installed for
you.

30
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.650
And that will be npm-run-all,
right here in your package.json.

31
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.987
And the version that we have
installed here is 2.3.0,

32
00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:54.338
which appears to be the latest.

33
00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:00.898
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: So
with that installed, npm-run-all,

34
00:02:00.898 --> 00:02:04.140
then you can use that in
your validate script.

35
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.300
And its API is basically just give
me a list of scripts that you want

36
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.980
to run after the parallel flag.

37
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.090
So we want npm run all to run in parallel
the scripts called lint and test.

38
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.680
Associated with those two things.

39
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.151
And then when you run those things it
will run a little bit faster because it's

40
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:28.604
running them both at the same time.

41
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.793
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Any questions,
anybody get there?

42
00:02:36.162 --> 00:02:37.621
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: All right, sweet.

43
00:02:43.482 --> 00:02:47.832
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Okay, so then,
now we want this to be like default thing

44
00:02:47.832 --> 00:02:51.270
that runs before we
commit anything at all.

45
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.850
Because I don't wanna like add some code,
and

46
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.330
then I'm committing something
that breaks the test for example.

47
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.820
I should say, something that you
might be thinking like, well.

48
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.590
What if I need to for some reason?

49
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.330
Well there's a pretty easy escape hatch.

50
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.935
Like if you say git commit and
whoop, spelling this correctly.

51
00:03:13.935 --> 00:03:16.607
Foo-bar or whatever you want, and

52
00:03:16.607 --> 00:03:22.030
then you simply add --no-verify and
that will skip all Git hooks.

53
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.790
That's actually something really good to
know when you start adding Git hooks and

54
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.950
stuff, start using those.

55
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.190
We're going to add ghooks to add
some shareable Git hooks, or

56
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.660
installable Git hooks.

57
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.470
And then we'll configure ghooks to
specify what hooks we want to have run,

58
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.890
specifically the validate script.

59
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.685
I'll say ghooks, and the latest version,
I think, is what we have, 3.2.

60
00:03:52.758 --> 00:03:54.299
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: And again,
you already have this installed.

61
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.030
And then you don't
actually use like a CLI or

62
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.450
anything for
G hooks you just configure it.

63
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.820
And then actually,

64
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.140
we will need to install it because it
will do some stuff when it's installed.

65
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.997
But first we'll just configure it,
it's config in your package JSON.

66
00:04:11.997 --> 00:04:15.930
Config is an object so again this is kind
of what I was talking about earlier.

67
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.870
This is where the blast away from
npm to configure your stuff.

68
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:29.630
And in here it's ghooks and
pre-commit is the hook that we care about.

69
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.976
So before commit happens we
want to run something and

70
00:04:32.976 --> 00:04:36.104
the thing that we want to
run is npm run validate.

71
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.995
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Now to actually
get those git hooks installed you

72
00:04:47.995 --> 00:04:54.253
do actually need to run npm
install --save-dev ghooks.

73
00:05:02.918 --> 00:05:05.202
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: And that,
you'll notice maybe,

74
00:05:05.202 --> 00:05:10.760
your output should probably have this,
it says node ./bin/module-install.

75
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.900
And that is what is responsible for

76
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.930
installing stuff into
your git hooks directory.

77
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.580
If you pop open your tag .git/hooks,
you'll now see a bunch of hooks in here.

78
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.940
If you look at commit-msg or
post-checkout,

79
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.380
you'll see generated by ghooks.

80
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.950
Do not edit this file.

81
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.945
And this is responsible for looking up in
your package JSON what scripts to run and

82
00:05:34.945 --> 00:05:36.497
running those scripts.

83
00:05:42.262 --> 00:05:48.737
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: So that is that, here,
I'll go ahead and break a test, or

84
00:05:48.737 --> 00:05:54.566
I'll add some stuff that's not covered,
foobar.

85
00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:02.550
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Actually,
we'll add a linting error too.

86
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.510
If I try to commit this, foobar,

87
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.710
then it runs those scripts first and it
fails, and I still have stuff to commit.

88
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.260
The commit failed and now I am

89
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.420
increasing the quality of the commits
going into my code base which is great.

90
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.420
And I can look up and see it's because
foobar is defined but never used.

91
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:32.200
I would get the same experience if my
test failed, that's cool, fun stuff.

92
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.984
Any questions about all of
that stuff I just said?

93
00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:43.963
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Okay,
I'll wait a second for chat.

94
00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:59.653
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Okay.

95
00:07:06.354 --> 00:07:11.329
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Great,
now we're gonna move onto trans-piling.

96
00:07:19.477 --> 00:07:22.438
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: This one's
a little bit more involved,

97
00:07:22.438 --> 00:07:26.020
it takes quite a bit of configuration and
stuff.

98
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.460
Who here is familiar with- actually,
sorry.

99
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.991
Before we do that,

100
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:38.849
let's all make sure we get on the same
page with the most recent changes.

101
00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:48.576
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: It is
called FEM/06.0-validate.

102
00:07:57.363 --> 00:07:59.663
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: We're gonna get rid
of that npm debug log really quick.

103
00:07:59.663 --> 00:08:00.902
What is that?

104
00:08:00.902 --> 00:08:02.141
Script failed
