&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Here
at Adventure Resources,

3
00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:08.620
I've got a ton of blog posts
on a subject Open Source.

4
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.010
You can check those out later.

5
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.760
Some more resources about Open Source,

6
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.320
there's an awesome OSS
repo that's pretty cool.

7
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.450
I have an egghead course that's
similar to what I just gave you today

8
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.820
called How to Write
an Open Source JavaScript Library.

9
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.380
It's scrunched in like an hour, so

10
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.050
it's quite a bit less than
what you experienced today.

11
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.750
And I have kind of
the opposite side of things,

12
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.320
how to contribute to
an Open Source library.

13
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.570
So this is something you can
direct your contributors to, and

14
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.910
in fact makeapullrequest.com.

15
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.250
It gives you a badge that
links to that project.

16
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.180
So you can put that on your
Open Source project and

17
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.420
people can learn how to contribute to
your project, which is pretty fun.

18
00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.800
And then I got a couple of JavaScript
error podcasts about Open Source and

19
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.450
that's it for me.

20
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.620
I would really appreciate it if
you could submit some feedback.

21
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.290
This just takes you to your form.

22
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.250
Please give me feedback.

23
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.180
I can't learn without feedback, and

24
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.210
Tony is asking if the REPOs
updated with the latest code?

25
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.650
So from the time that we forked

26
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.560
on everything else that we
worked on together is different.

27
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.070
Well, we kinda followed
what the repo is doing,

28
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.060
but it's not GitHub names on there or
anything, it's still Star Wars names.

29
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.470
But if you go to the last branch, if

30
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.430
we go to do starwars-names and
you go to, woops.

31
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.510
The last branch that is FEM,
so it's FEM10.1docs,

32
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.598
then that will have all the- Lot of
the things I already talked about,

33
00:01:54.598 --> 00:01:56.820
that;s what you want to
compare yourself to.

34
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.620
The master branches is outdated.

35
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.490
So yeah, that's it for

36
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.915
me, again, I really appreciate your
feedback and thanks for coming.

37
00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:11.606
