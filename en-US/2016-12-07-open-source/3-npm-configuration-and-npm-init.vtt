00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.000
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: NPM Init so now we're
finally gonna have a package J son.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.677
So what we just did is pretty
much applicable to everything,

4
00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:15.623
every open source library regardless of
the platform you're delivering it to.

5
00:00:15.623 --> 00:00:21.140
Package.kson very specific to NPM
you're not gonna be publishing to

6
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.280
other registries most of
the time with a package.json.

7
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:31.572
So, there are a couple of things with
actually, let's go to npmjs.org.

8
00:00:31.572 --> 00:00:35.940
So, there are a couple of things about.

9
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.260
Weird.
We need docs.

10
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.500
Npm Npmjs docs.

11
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.810
There we go, docs.npmjs.com.

12
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.330
Actually just let me quickly explain why
we're about to do what we're gonna do, so

13
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.140
normally to start a package json.

14
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.580
You can create your own
package json yourself, but

15
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.350
npm comes prebundled with a really
cool command called npm init.

16
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.740
And it's gonna ask you
a whole bunch of questions.

17
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.770
It will probably, your first question
will probably be something different.

18
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.150
It might ask you for your name or
one of the questions and I don't like,

19
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.820
this is my machine I don't like having to
answer the same questions all the time so

20
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.490
I'm gonna show you how
you can get around that.

21
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.440
With more than you'll probably want
to know about the npm configuration.

22
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.470
So we have a couple of properties.

23
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.440
The npm configuration consists of
an npm rc file in your home directory.

24
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.930
So I'm not gonna actually,
I was gonna show you mine, but

25
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.590
it has my npm token in it which means you
can publish all my libraries for me, so

26
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.980
I'm not gonna do that, but
I guess I could npm and logout.

27
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.340
There we go.

28
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.087
Now, I can cat .npmrc.

29
00:02:00.087 --> 00:02:04.680
Oops, cat, in my home directory,
.npmrc, and

30
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.014
that gives you everything
that my npmrc looks like.

31
00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:13.630
So init author name corresponds
to this init author name here,

32
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.640
and so on and so forth.

33
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.310
We have email, URL, license.

34
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.020
I only have to answer
these questions once,

35
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.180
I do not have to answer them over and
over again.

36
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.330
The way that you set up this,
and save exact,

37
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.490
that means when I run npminstall--save,

38
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.425
it's going to save
the exact version of 4.5.3

39
00:02:41.425 --> 00:02:46.340
rather than the carrot that probably
mostly seen in your package.jsons.

40
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.240
So there's kind of like a some
people like that, some people don't.

41
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.590
I like that, so
you don't have to do that though.

42
00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.514
So yeah, the command we're gonna run is,
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Yeah,

43
00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:02.340
where is the document?

44
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.300
Here we go.

45
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.180
So there's a fly right here.

46
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.560
So yeah, it's npm config set, and
then whatever it is that you want to set.

47
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.360
So it's npm config set init-author-name,
and then put your name in here.

48
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.010
So this is one thing that's not
committed to our repository.

49
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.430
This is gonna be for you, so
whatever you wanna put in here.

50
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.910
So for me that would be kencdodds.

51
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.580
And then if I cat the npmrc, yeah,
you're gonna wanna put that in quotes.

52
00:03:37.394 --> 00:03:40.237
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Yeah, and
then if you look at your npmrc,

53
00:03:40.237 --> 00:03:43.120
you should have an init-author-name.

54
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.525
So I'm gonna stop right here and
let you do the same thing for email,

55
00:03:47.525 --> 00:03:50.210
url and license if you want to.

56
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.590
You don't have to do that like maybe
you don't like the MIT license or

57
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.460
something but yeah go ahead and
go through that real quick.

58
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.330
Feel free to ask questions.

59
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.660
Ivan is wondering why we
have init-author-email and

60
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.855
we also have email, so I'm for sure that

61
00:04:16.855 --> 00:04:22.860
init-author-email is what's
used when npm init is run.

62
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.250
And so when you initialize, we'll see what
the package.json looks like in a second.

63
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.060
But one of the properties of
the package.json is the author.

64
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.130
And so in it,
author email is used in that package.json.

65
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.930
The email is, I'm pretty sure it's
used in association with your login.

66
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.480
But I'm not 100% positive what it's for or

67
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.020
what it uses your email for
with your log in.

68
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.020
Maybe it's somehow associated with your
user name and token, like they use

69
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.821
the three of them or something to
authenticate you or something, I think.

70
00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:01.250
I'm not 100% positive on that.

71
00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:07.904
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Everybody
have their npmrc set up?

72
00:05:07.904 --> 00:05:08.856
Anybody have that done?

73
00:05:11.522 --> 00:05:12.916
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Yeah, all right.

74
00:05:12.916 --> 00:05:19.303
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Okay, cool.

75
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.160
So with that you should be
able to run npm init and

76
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.410
it will start asking you
questions about your package.

77
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.980
So it will ask for
the name of your package.

78
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.770
You're going to fork this later and
change the name later so

79
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.989
until we get to that point go ahead and
follow along.

80
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.830
So we'll default with the directory name,
Star Wars names.

81
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.510
The version will default to 1.0.

82
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.110
We're actually gonna change
that version before we publish,

83
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.270
then you can enter in any
description you want for all your

84
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.187
random Star Wars character needs.

85
00:05:58.187 --> 00:06:03.390
Entry point is what

86
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:08.900
will be required when somebody
goes to require your module.

87
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.210
Let's say we had this published on npm,
somebody installs it then they went

88
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.740
require, starwars-names.

89
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.579
The entry point property
in the package.json is

90
00:06:21.579 --> 00:06:26.520
how Node resolves that require statement.

91
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.840
So you set this to whatever you want
your main method to be basically.

92
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.599
For us that's gonna be src/index.js.

93
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.860
And for the test command,
that's pretty cool.

94
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:47.540
So I've never actually had all my Node
modules installed before I ran npm init,

95
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.380
and it looks like it noticed
that we have Mocha installed.

96
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.590
So it's defaulting to Mocha.

97
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.220
I don't know if it's doing that for
you, but that's cool.

98
00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.850
Yeah, you can do Mocha.

99
00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:57.520
We're going to actually,

100
00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.950
when we check out the next branch
it's going to blow it away anyway.

101
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.610
We'll add that later.

102
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.600
The git repository should default to the
one, to your origin, and then keywords,

103
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.690
you can put whatever you want, star wars.

104
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.470
And license will default to MIT.

105
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.410
It'll ask you if this is okay, you can
say yes and pop open your package.json.

106
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.700
Sorry, there's a question.

107
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What was the save exact for?

108
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.610
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Yeah, so
save exact is, like I said earlier,

109
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:34.410
it allows me to run npm
install --save foo.

110
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.470
And normally if you run
this without anything set,

111
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:42.010
then in your package json you'll get,
well, once we have dependencies,

112
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.250
you'll get Foo added to your dependencies,

113
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.370
you know by running say Foo
whatever package you're installing.

114
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.920
And it'll add a carrot and

115
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.490
then the version number and
this has to do with version ranges.

116
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.520
I'm not going to get into that too much.

117
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.270
But I actually kind of like
locking down my version numbers.

118
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:11.640
It makes upgrading dependencies
a little less surprising for me.

119
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.700
So that's all save exact does.

120
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:19.990
You can do that on the command like per
npm install as well if you want to,

121
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.840
but you don't have to do that.

122
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:24.420
Any other questions?

123
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.830
Joel's license defaulted to ISC.

124
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:38.250
It's probably because your init
license is not set properly,

125
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:43.870
and that's fine if you wanna use ISC,
but this is what it should look like

126
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:50.164
if you want to initialize to something
in particular is init-license=MIT
