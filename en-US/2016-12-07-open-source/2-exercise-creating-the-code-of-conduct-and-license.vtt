00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.987
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:07.913
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: I want you to
create a code of conduct, a license,

3
00:00:07.913 --> 00:00:10.260
and a readme in this project.

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.560
So, we'll just kinda do that together and

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.510
I'll show you how I find the stuff for
these files.

6
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.440
We'll start out actually with the readme,
so if you create a new file Readme.md.

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.620
Dot md stands for mark down and

8
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.350
mark down is pretty much the standard
format for readme files.

9
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.220
Or pretty much any documentation
files on GitHub especially.

10
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.450
So here if you use this hash
it's gonna say this is h1 and

11
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.420
normally you would put the name of
the library so we'll put starwars-names.

12
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.680
And then here you can put a description.

13
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.220
When we check out the next branch all your
stuff is gonna be wiped away anyway so

14
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.750
you can put whatever you want in here.

15
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.900
Whatever you want in here.

16
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.430
I like Twix!

17
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.249
Don't put that in your readme's for
your libraries,

18
00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:07.980
I mean, you can, I guess,
make it a badge, I don't know.

19
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.610
So yeah, readme, like I said, we'll
talk about that a little bit more later.

20
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.430
And then we'll create another
new file called license.

21
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.260
This one doesn't need to be in markdown or
anything,

22
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.894
because you're basically just gonna
be copy pasting from somewhere else.

23
00:01:23.894 --> 00:01:29.509
And so I have a generator where I use to
create all my libraries and I recommend

24
00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.627
that if you're gonna be creating
a lot of the same types of projects.

25
00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:37.602
Whether it be libraries or applications or

26
00:01:37.602 --> 00:01:42.570
something you create something like
a Yeoman generator or something.

27
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.700
To automatically like scaffold out
everything for you, most of the stuff

28
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.170
that we're gonna be talking about today,
you can scaffold with a generator.

29
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.555
But yeah, to get the license,
I just go to opensource.org and

30
00:01:58.555 --> 00:02:04.107
go to licenses and standards,
licence by name, MIT.

31
00:02:04.107 --> 00:02:07.540
I grab that one and copy this.

32
00:02:10.685 --> 00:02:15.300
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: So again,
that's opensource.org/licenses/mit.

33
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.020
You could also probably just Google for
it and it'd be pretty simple to find.

34
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.820
And then you can just swap out
the year with the current year and

35
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.240
copyright holders with your name.

36
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:37.812
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: And that is the license
and then finally the code of conduct.

37
00:02:37.812 --> 00:02:41.814
I make that a markdown file but that one,

38
00:02:41.814 --> 00:02:46.889
I'm mostly having you do this so
that you can like.

39
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.750
Not because I don't think you can do it on
your own, but because I think it's helpful

40
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.330
for you to see how I find good
documentation for this kind of thing.

41
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.570
So there are a couple of
good codes of conduct.

42
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.190
You could probably just search
open source code of conduct and

43
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.240
find a couple of good ones.

44
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.960
Let's see, yep, Contributor Covenant
is right there at number three.

45
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.810
The TODO Group has an open
code of conduct as well.

46
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.800
So there are a couple that you
could adopt in your own projects.

47
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.800
I prefer the Contributor Covenant.

48
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.280
There is a markdown version of this one,
that is at contributor-covenant.org.

49
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.113
And if you scroll down to
the English markdown version then

50
00:03:36.113 --> 00:03:41.152
you can copy this and
paste it in your contributor covenant.

51
00:03:41.152 --> 00:03:46.956
There's one place you need to update and
that is in the enforcement section,

52
00:03:46.956 --> 00:03:50.989
there's whoops,
insert email address right here.

53
00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.010
You put your email or
wherever you want to have people contact

54
00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.140
code of conduct issues so
I'll say kent@doddsfamily.us.

55
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.610
And then we've got our code of conduct.

56
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.830
And that's it your project should
look something like this now.

57
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.130
If it doesn't, it's okay.

58
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.360
We're gonna be checking
out the next branch.

59
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.880
So, I should have mentioned at
the beginning, we all learn differently.

60
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.700
Some of us learn better
by following along and

61
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.280
some of us learn better by just kind of
observing and then implementing later.

62
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.800
There will be some parts of this
workshop where I'll stop and

63
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.510
let you do just work through stuff and
that kind of thing.

64
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.710
But lots of this is setting up tooling and

65
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.980
knowing exactly what APIs look like and
stuff.

66
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.740
So yeah,
there will be a little of everything here.

67
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can I ask a few questions?

68
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.180
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Sure.

69
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And maybe you're going
to go over this later but when

70
00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.080
we clone these, the skip,
the repo that you have.

71
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.470
We bring in all the files that are,
of course, on Github.

72
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.103
Then if we go into that directory and
run this npm setup

73
00:05:09.103 --> 00:05:15.810
run setup processors, it seems to
remove everything from that directory.

74
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:16.350
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Yeah.

75
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Am I seeing that right?

76
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.450
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Yeah, so the Master
branch of this project is actually a real

77
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.650
project that's out there and
published to NPM already.

78
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.250
So what I did was, so that we could
build this thing from scratch,

79
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.000
I branched off of master and
I just deleted everything.

80
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.210
Created the first branch and then slowly
added it through the rest of the branches.

81
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.130
So that's why you don't
have anything right now.

82
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.664
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And then the next question,
so you put up two websites that we're

83
00:05:46.664 --> 00:05:50.960
gonna use for our continuous
integration and something else.

84
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.830
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And

85
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.890
I can use my github account to login.

86
00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:02.530
Should I be working your project and then
cloning it from my github account instead?

87
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.500
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Yeah good question,
we're gonna fork eventually for sure.

88
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.670
Yep good question, that is coming.

89
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.420
Okay sweet, any other questions?

90
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:17.330
Okay, I think I'm gonna do something
here with you chat folks because you're

91
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:23.060
a little bit behind on this live feed.

92
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.680
When I am ready to accept questions or
whatever,

93
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.650
you can ask questions at any time.

94
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:34.330
But when I'm waiting for questions, I'm
just gonna type question mark in the chat,

95
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.360
and you can start asking questions,
if you have any.

96
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.230
That way, we don't have to worry about
the time delay with the live feed.

97
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.660
So Ivan is asking, I've seen so

98
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.740
many projects with the license repeated
in the heading of each source file.

99
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.460
Is this a good practice,
should it be used as default?

100
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.610
Ivan, that's a good point,
I've also seen that.

101
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.400
I don't know enough about licenses to
know whether that's required by certain

102
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.460
licenses or if that's, yeah, if that's
necessarily a good practice or not.

103
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.810
That's a good question to
take to Google or maybe,

104
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.500
in particular, some of the libraries
that you've seen do that.

105
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.120
I know that Web pack does this,
and React does this, so

106
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.790
you could ask them, maybe,
why they're doing that.

107
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.670
Good question and if you find out,
Ivan, let us know, I'd be interested.

108
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:27.690
And Brett is asking, what is the dash
f switch on the git checkout?

109
00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:31.460
Yeah, I forgot to mention that,
so thanks Brett.

110
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.750
Right here is how we're gonna
keep up with each other.

111
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.120
Once we're finished with this exercise,
you check out this branch, and

112
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:44.630
it's gonna get us all back up to the same
baseline, so that nobody falls behind.

113
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.580
And so the -f just blows
away all of your changes.

114
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.760
I know that you're working hard on this,
and

115
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.290
it probably feels demoralizing to lose
all the stuff that you've worked on.

116
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.590
And so
if you don't wanna check out branches and

117
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.700
you wanna make sure you're
following along, you can try that.

118
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.410
But this is a nice safety net for you,
so I'm actually gonna do that right now.

119
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.110
And, yep, still have the code of conduct,
the license, and

120
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:19.300
the readme, although it doesn't
say I like Twix anymore, so, yeah.
