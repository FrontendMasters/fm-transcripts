[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.074 --> 00:00:07.250
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: This is where things
are gonna get a little interesting.

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.030
So we'll go ahead and
check out the browser build, and

4
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.050
this will be the last time you can check
out a branch because it is time to fork.

5
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.140
So this may not work for everybody.

6
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.968
I hope that it does, cuz if it does,
it's gonna be awesome.

7
00:00:27.968 --> 00:00:31.190
But hopefully this works.

8
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.584
I'm wondering if maybe what we'll do is,

9
00:00:34.584 --> 00:00:40.070
we'll kinda go through this together and
hopefully get somewhere.

10
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.265
Then we'll take like a 15 minute break for
people,

11
00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:48.180
if it's not quite working yet for you or
something, and I can help out in the chat.

12
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.890
And I can be available here and

13
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.100
yeah hopefully we can all get this up and
going together before we continue.

14
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.560
So what we're gonna do is remember,
my goal here is for

15
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.880
you to publish your own
version of this library.

16
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.190
And I want to show you how to
automate the release process as well.

17
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.853
Automating the release process is really,
really awesome.

18
00:01:18.853 --> 00:01:21.863
And so the first thing that
we're gonna do though,

19
00:01:21.863 --> 00:01:24.390
is you're all gonna fork the repository.

20
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.600
And then you're gonna set up Travis.

21
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.490
Which is a continuous integration service.

22
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.142
To run the tests and the linting and
everything on every single time we build.

23
00:01:35.142 --> 00:01:39.386
And hopefully by the end
of this excercise,

24
00:01:39.386 --> 00:01:43.526
we'll have things all built and running.

25
00:01:43.526 --> 00:01:47.575
But we don't want to all
publish the exact same module,

26
00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:53.277
because that would be kind of sad, you
want to do something good for the world.

27
00:01:53.277 --> 00:01:58.188
And so before you actually push this
up and before we go through and

28
00:01:58.188 --> 00:01:59.540
release things.

29
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.000
You're going to update the package.json
to be only your information.

30
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.130
And you'll also update
the starwars-names.json to be

31
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.780
some other name's JSON.

32
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.524
Like whatever you want it to be.

33
00:02:12.524 --> 00:02:17.554
You can fill it with whatever characters.

34
00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:20.257
Or whatever movie or
your family's names or

35
00:02:20.257 --> 00:02:23.261
whatever you want to
publish to the repository.

36
00:02:23.261 --> 00:02:26.180
And you'll change starwars-names
names to startrek-names.

37
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.375
Don't use that somebody already took it,
but be something else entirely.

38
00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:36.013
And then you'll push that to
your own fork of the, repo and

39
00:02:36.013 --> 00:02:41.720
you can change the name of the repo if
you want to, and it will be your library.

40
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.690
So I have a script that I
have in the slides here

41
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.240
that you can copy and
paste in an IMDB page for a movie.

42
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.568
So like Harry Potter, I'm pretty
sure harrypotter-names isn't taken.

43
00:02:57.568 --> 00:03:01.008
And you just stick this
in your console and

44
00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:07.200
it will copy the names of the characters
from the Harry Potter movie.

45
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.560
Or you could go find another movie.

46
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.600
Hopefully it works.

47
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.939
If it doesn't work you might just have
to code in a couple names yourself and

48
00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:15.486
then you can add more names later.

49
00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:19.122
But yeah, so
that's what we're gonna do for

50
00:03:19.122 --> 00:03:24.001
the next like half hour or so,
is getting you all forked, and

51
00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:28.420
having your stuff all set up and
ready to go for Travis.

52
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.440
Is this gonna be awesome?

53
00:03:33.524 --> 00:03:40.160
Okay so for the first little bit you can
kinda, you can follow along with me.

54
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.410
And then we'll just stop and i'll help you
with specific issues that you're having.

55
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.510
So yeah, let's do this.

56
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.878
I'm just gonna click this link to
get to the repo really quick, and

57
00:03:55.878 --> 00:04:00.560
we'll click on Fork I'm gonna fork
it to JavaScript error, why not?

58
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.844
Cuz I already have a fork at this.

59
00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:10.021
Yeah, so now, yeah,
that was actually really fast.

60
00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:15.053
You just create your own fork, and
then once everybody has their fork

61
00:04:15.053 --> 00:04:20.370
you should be able to clone or
download right to here, you click on that.

62
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.670
And you'll get your very own link.

63
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.982
It should basically be
the same as the original one,

64
00:04:25.982 --> 00:04:29.613
except it'll have your username in there.

65
00:04:29.613 --> 00:04:31.855
And actually before you do that,

66
00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:35.800
why don't you decide what
you're gonna call this repo?

67
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.210
You'll go to your settings and
change it to something else.

68
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.752
Mine's gonna be,
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: I don't know,

69
00:04:43.752 --> 00:04:46.740
this is the hardest part in programming.

70
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.515
How do I name something?

71
00:04:50.515 --> 00:04:54.650
How about, github-names?

72
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.769
Yeah, this will be the names of my GitHub
repositories or something, I don't know.

73
00:04:59.769 --> 00:05:03.510
Okay, so then you'll hit Clone or
download.

74
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.040
Copy that URL to your clipboard.

75
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.550
And come over to your repo, and

76
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.630
I'm actually going to rename my directory.

77
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.890
So I'll pop up one directory and

78
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.760
move starwars-names over to github-names.

79
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.315
And now everything's kind of borked, so
I'm gonna have to restart my editor.

80
00:05:39.732 --> 00:05:40.323
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Okay.

81
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.965
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: And with this,
we now need to update what repository

82
00:05:48.965 --> 00:05:53.335
this GitHub repo or
this git repo is pointing to.

83
00:05:54.605 --> 00:06:01.746
So it is ls-remote.

84
00:06:06.101 --> 00:06:09.252
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: I don't know git very
well, but here, if you say git ls-remote,

85
00:06:09.252 --> 00:06:12.090
I think there's probably
a better command for this.

86
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.650
But it'll show you that your
git repo is still pointing to

87
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.729
kentcdodds/starwars-names, unless
you already forked it,

88
00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:23.376
then in which case,
it might be pointed to yours already.

89
00:06:23.376 --> 00:06:28.947
But we don't want it to do that,
we want it to point to our fork,

90
00:06:28.947 --> 00:06:33.810
and so we're going to say
git remote set-url origin.

91
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.060
So that's the default name
of a remote is origin,

92
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.880
and then you'll paste
in your remote's URL.

93
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:47.372
So we're changing

94
00:06:47.372 --> 00:06:53.526
the origin remote url.

95
00:07:00.456 --> 00:07:07.055
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Okay, so that's step one
of this important step, or step couple.

96
00:07:07.055 --> 00:07:11.988
You fork it, you change the name
to whatever you're gonna

97
00:07:11.988 --> 00:07:15.521
be creating and publishing to NPM today.

98
00:07:15.521 --> 00:07:20.208
And then I changed the name
of my directory just to make

99
00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:23.280
it a little bit more clear.

100
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:29.303
And then you update
your remote origin URL.

101
00:07:29.303 --> 00:07:30.809
And because you've forked it,

102
00:07:30.809 --> 00:07:33.940
everything should be exactly
the same as it was before.

103
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.614
So you have all the same branches,
everything.

104
00:07:36.614 --> 00:07:39.690
You should still be able to continue
to check out next branches and stuff.

105
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.348
So yeah, actually when I said you
can't check out the next branch,

106
00:07:45.348 --> 00:07:47.938
that was not entirely true, you can.

107
00:07:47.938 --> 00:07:52.243
From here, though,
we're going to go ahead and

108
00:07:52.243 --> 00:07:56.830
update a couple more
things to make it ours.

109
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.640
To make it your very own.

110
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:05.080
So let me just really quickly find all
places where we used starwars-names.

111
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.050
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: So there are a couple
places where you could update

112
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.246
starwars-names to github-names
in your package.json.

113
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.945
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Find all the places
that use starwars-names and

114
00:08:20.945 --> 00:08:24.480
change that to whatever you called it,
github-names.

115
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.260
And all places that use
kentcdodds as well.

116
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.412
Change that to your username.

117
00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:32.780
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Except for
eslint-config-kentcdodds,

118
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.457
you don't wanna change that.

119
00:08:36.201 --> 00:08:37.448
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: So
I'll put that one back.

120
00:08:51.232 --> 00:08:53.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
you actually released that yes?

121
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.980
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: It's not,
yeah Star Wars names does exist,

122
00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.810
it already has been released, but
this hasn't yet been released now.

123
00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:04.582
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I mean that
dependency that you just changed.

124
00:09:04.582 --> 00:09:06.400
The kentcdodds one.

125
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:06.980
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Yeah, yeah.

126
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.683
The eslint-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [CROSSTALK] meant to be

127
00:09:08.683 --> 00:09:09.348
released.

128
00:09:09.348 --> 00:09:10.246
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Yep, that exists.

129
00:09:10.246 --> 00:09:11.040
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

130
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.540
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Yep.

131
00:09:14.182 --> 00:09:17.070
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: And let's see,
where else do we have starwars-names?

132
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:22.710
We need to switch it in the readme,
so you'd update.

133
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.790
We don't have any docs yet, so
you don't have too much to update in here.

134
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.483
But we'll do github-names.

135
00:09:28.483 --> 00:09:29.790
For all your random.

136
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:34.025
Ooh, I know what I'll do,
I'll do people that I follow on GitHub.

137
00:09:34.025 --> 00:09:38.141
All your random GitHub, yeah,
we'll just say character names,

138
00:09:38.141 --> 00:09:40.065
these are GitHub characters.

139
00:09:43.896 --> 00:09:50.366
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Okay, and then in our
test, we're calling it starWarsNames.

140
00:09:56.546 --> 00:09:59.247
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: So gitHubNames.

141
00:10:05.028 --> 00:10:08.770
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: And in our index,
we are requiring starwars-names.

142
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:11.910
We're gonna call it github-names, whoops.

143
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:18.401
And we'll rename the file to github-names.

144
00:10:20.444 --> 00:10:22.117
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Pretty
sure that is everything.

145
00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:28.170
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Yeah, and
then of course as well you will want to.

146
00:10:31.744 --> 00:10:33.550
Yeah, sorry.

147
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.180
Couple more places in your source here.

148
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.359
This is starWarsNames.

149
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:46.180
So this will be gitHubNames,
and where was that other?

150
00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:50.760
Yeah, and then in your webpack.config,
the library target, or

151
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.819
the library name, is still starWarsNames,
you want that to be gitHubNames.

152
00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.240
And with that, you should be able to build
it, and everything else should still work.

153
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.620
It'll just be whatever you called it,
and then you just need to update

154
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:10.120
your names thing here,
which I'm not gonna have you watch me do.

155
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:17.993
I'm just gonna say kentcdodds and
sindresorhus.

156
00:11:17.993 --> 00:11:19.066
So we'll just have two for now.

157
00:11:21.942 --> 00:11:26.778
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: And like I said,
I am mostly just kind of showing you,

158
00:11:26.778 --> 00:11:31.627
then you'll get a chance to
do this during the break.

159
00:11:31.627 --> 00:11:36.290
Let me make sure that we're not missing
anything else that you'll want to do.

160
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:44.400
I'm thinking that we'll save the
Travis.yml stuff until after the break.
