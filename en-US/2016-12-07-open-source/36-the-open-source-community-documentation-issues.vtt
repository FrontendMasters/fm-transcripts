2
00:00:03.227 --> 00:00:05.370
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: So
now we're back to the community aspect.

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.720
This is the stuff that I
wanted to mostly talk about.

4
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.680
So for the documentation side.

5
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.920
A couple of you in the pre-event survey
mentioned that one thing that you really

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.710
want to get out of this workshop is how to
write proper documentation for a library.

7
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.000
And so here's what I suggest.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.817
The first thing that you write
about is what the problem is that

9
00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:27.940
you're trying to solve.

10
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.300
How many people have heard of start
with y, the concept of starting with y?

11
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.640
It's fantastic.

12
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.910
And it basically the premise is is what
makes people really loyal to companies

13
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.920
is those companies that understand why
they're doing what they're doing and

14
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.240
communicating that well to the people
who are purchasing their product.

15
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.280
And in the same way I think
we can communicate why to

16
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.060
the people who are using
our open source libraries.

17
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.660
So document the problem.

18
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.220
What are you trying to solve?

19
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.560
And that should be one of
the first things that you do.

20
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.980
And that can be as simple
as a single line of,

21
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.220
when all you want is GitHub] names,
this will solve your problem, whatever.

22
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.110
Or it can be a big long paragraph
explaining what the problem

23
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.280
that you're trying to solve is.

24
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.590
And then explain the solution.

25
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.110
So once people have identified,

26
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.710
okay, I'm having this problem
that they're describing.

27
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.930
I totally get it.

28
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.010
How are they solving this problem?

29
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.010
Then they can determine whether they
like the way that you've solved it.

30
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.760
And if they like the way
that you've solved it,

31
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.220
then they'll be interested in seeing
how they can actually use it.

32
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.900
So you explain how you've
solved the problem.

33
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.967
Once they decided that they agree with
your solution, and they wanna use it,

34
00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:49.570
then you need to explain
how they install it.

35
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.673
And installing is more than just run npm,
install this.

36
00:01:53.673 --> 00:01:57.973
Lots of the people who are using
your libraries are maybe new to npm,

37
00:01:57.973 --> 00:01:59.610
maybe new to Node.

38
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.720
And so explain okay,
you're gonna need Node version this and

39
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.030
NPM version this, and you'll run this
command after you have those things.

40
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.570
And make those links to what NPM and
Node are.

41
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.720
Be as friendly as possible to new people,
because making things good for

42
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.060
new people makes it better for everybody.

43
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.990
And then you get into API documentation.

44
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.250
Obviously you're gonna want to say,
okay, when you require this thing,

45
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.050
you're going to get an object that has
an all property and a random property.

46
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.860
And the all property has all of the things
and random will get you a random item.

47
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.140
And here are the arguments you could
provide to random or whatever.

48
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.700
That's fairly straightforward.

49
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.600
I think most libraries are pretty good
at API, or at least documenting API.

50
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.860
Another really good thing to document is
examples, and make it really easy for

51
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.630
people to add examples to your library,
and ask people to provide examples.

52
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.620
If somebody says, hey, thank you so
much for this library it saved me a lot of

53
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.110
work, you can say, awesome,
could you add an example?

54
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.789
Thank me by contributing
an example to the project.

55
00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:05.045
So an example could be something in
an examples directory in your project or

56
00:03:05.045 --> 00:03:07.881
it could be if you've got a website or
something,

57
00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:11.150
you could have examples that go on there.

58
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.540
Tutorials are really valuable,
too, so we're all different and we

59
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.740
can contribute to open source in different
ways, so seek out the people who are using

60
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.680
your project who might be good at creating
tutorials, or create tutorials yourself.

61
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.240
But through this whole experience

62
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.656
what you're trying to do is
not do everything yourself.

63
00:03:31.656 --> 00:03:36.976
Even if you are excited about the library
and you know that you can do this and

64
00:03:36.976 --> 00:03:41.453
whatever, hold your horses and
try to find somebody else who is

65
00:03:41.453 --> 00:03:46.204
interested in doing it,
somebody who actually uses the library.

66
00:03:46.204 --> 00:03:50.750
Because by doing that you're gonna start
building a community around this library.

67
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.050
At first you might have a little
bit of trouble doing that, and

68
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.180
that's okay because you need to actually
convince people to start using this thing,

69
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.320
and sometimes it's like chicken and
the egg.

70
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.907
Sometimes it's actually better
to have tutorials first, and

71
00:04:02.907 --> 00:04:04.790
then people will start using it.

72
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.710
But if you can,

73
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.040
try to get other people involved
in ways that they can be involved.

74
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.290
Blogposts are really useful, screencasts,
that's something that I really like doing.

75
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.420
I like making screencasts.

76
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.870
Just put it up on YouTube and
then add a link in your readme.

77
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.380
And then give talks, at meetups,
at conferences, whatever.

78
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.470
And that's a great way to kind of give
a high level overview of the problem.

79
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.472
So then on the community site side of
things, there are a couple of services and

80
00:04:34.472 --> 00:04:38.780
things that you can do to kind of
improve your community as a whole.

81
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.950
Chat is really great.

82
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.571
Gitter, anybody familiar with Gitter,
used Gitter before?

83
00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:49.400
Here, I'll just show you, Gitter.im.

84
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.298
We have technically 6 minutes left.

85
00:04:51.298 --> 00:04:55.000
I might go 10 or 15 minutes over.

86
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.320
But yeah, Gitter's great, I like it a lot.

87
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.950
It's good for
interacting with other people and

88
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.820
specifically on projects, and
it's quite easy to set up.

89
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.470
And then Stack Overflow is underrated in
open source and we should use it more.

90
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.676
Generally, people will file
issues when they have questions.

91
00:05:14.676 --> 00:05:17.260
If that's the way that you want to
work your project, that's great, but

92
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.500
I prefer to direct those people very
kindly and patiently to Stack Overflow.

93
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.453
Because often, what you're gonna get are
people who don't understand JavaScripts,

94
00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:31.439
are new to code, and that's totally fine.

95
00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:33.121
But if you want to avoid burnout,

96
00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:37.250
you can't teach every single one of
these people how to use JavaScript.

97
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.860
So send them over to Stack Overflow.

98
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.730
If it's really an issue with your library,
then you can actually

99
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.570
give them a link that will add a question
that's pre-tagged with something.

100
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.510
So you can add a tag for your library.

101
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.350
And then you can subscribe to
the RSS feed for that, add that tag,

102
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.250
get emails, and make sure you stay on
top of those Stack Overflow questions.

103
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.010
But that way, the entire
Stack Overflow community can help you

104
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.740
teach people JavaScript, which is great.

105
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.410
Issues, obviously, leave those on.

106
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.060
That's important.

107
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.880
Pull requests, another really
important thing to to be active on.

108
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.286
And then here's just kind of a fun
pro tip of something that I did

109
00:06:18.286 --> 00:06:19.710
with one of my libraries.

110
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.130
So let's say you have
a lib called yourlib.

111
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.450
And you have the domain yourlib.com.

112
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.580
So often when you're
working with a community,

113
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.860
people are going to ask you for help.

114
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.766
And one of the best ways for

115
00:06:35.766 --> 00:06:41.790
you to give help to people is when they
give you as much information as possible.

116
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.560
And so for libraries that work in
the browser, this is fantastic.

117
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.570
Because you can set up a jsbin or
a jsfiddle or

118
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.510
something like a code pen that
has everything all set up.

119
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.540
It has your library as like a script tag.

120
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.510
And it has kind of the scaffolding, and

121
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.160
you just say insert your code here and
reproduce the problem.

122
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.040
Or show me what you're trying to do.

123
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.616
So then you have that and you point your

124
00:07:11.616 --> 00:07:16.050
help.your-lib.com to that bin.

125
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.560
Or if you don't wanna buy
a domain url that's totally fine.

126
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:26.240
Just have a short url to point to
this place for people to get help.

127
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.690
And then it's really easy when
somebody says hey, I need help.

128
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.150
You can just say, okay, thanks for
your interest in the library.

129
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.890
Just go to help.your-lib.com, and

130
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.620
they look at the URL, they know exactly
what it's for, they go to that.

131
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:46.550
And then before they come back to you
with a link to their reproduction,

132
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.460
they're like, I know what the problem is.

133
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.200
And you never even have
to answer their question.

134
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:57.080
What I find often that happens is
people have kind of a weird mix

135
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.150
of things in their own projects that they
can't reproduce outside of their projects.

136
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.270
That's because they have different
libraries that are in the mix.

137
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.320
And by isolating it into
a separate example,

138
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.660
they realize what the problem
is before they even ask you.

139
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.860
And what's better is for

140
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.780
them to come to you with the actual
reproduction of the problem.

141
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.440
And so, all the while,
you're saving yourself on burnout but

142
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.490
you're also helping people take
ownership on their questions.

143
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:30.970
And you're also offering them a great
deal of help and saving both of you time.

144
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:35.717
Also issues, so
if somebody has an actual issue,

145
00:08:35.717 --> 00:08:38.692
then they can reproduce an issue in Jsbin,
or

146
00:08:38.692 --> 00:08:43.733
if it's more of a server side thing,
you can have a repo that they can clone.

147
00:08:43.733 --> 00:08:47.153
And they do this, too, a fork.

148
00:08:47.153 --> 00:08:50.633
Learn, so
if you have a getting started guide,

149
00:08:50.633 --> 00:08:56.430
you can have learn questions so
that autofills a Stack Overflow tag.

150
00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.080
Changelog can go to the changelog,
chat can go to chat, so on and so forth.

151
00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.030
So having short URLs has
actually been really nice.

152
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.530
Obviously, you know that
I really like short URLs.

153
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:11.320
I use them all the time, so that I don't
have to go find these things all the time.

154
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.805
So issues, labels are really important.

155
00:09:13.805 --> 00:09:17.591
On GitHub,
you can have specific labels to say okay,

156
00:09:17.591 --> 00:09:22.660
this is a beginner friendly issue or
this is a really hard issue.

157
00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.830
We're probably gonna do
this issue ourselves, or

158
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.750
you can assign issues to people.

159
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.640
You could say that this issue
is associated with this thing,

160
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.080
this part of the library.

161
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.780
You can say that this issue
would be a breaking change.

162
00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.548
This is a bug, enhancement, whatever.

163
00:09:39.548 --> 00:09:43.080
It makes it a lot easier to organize
your thoughts around the project.

164
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.210
And even more makes it so

165
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.290
that people coming into the project
who are interested in contributing

166
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:52.740
can organize through those issues and
find issues that they can contribute on.

167
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.398
Having a contributing md file is great.

168
00:09:56.398 --> 00:10:00.556
And so if you're not familiar,
contributing md file in your project,

169
00:10:00.556 --> 00:10:03.610
you just put it in
the root of your project.

170
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:08.390
And at the top of the issues page,
it will have this little thing that says

171
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.160
please review the contributing
guidelines to this repository.

172
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.270
So you can say, hey, if you're gonna
contribute an issue, that's great.

173
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.050
Thank you for doing that.

174
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.150
Here are some things to consider.

175
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:23.014
Or it's also a good place to say,
okay, if you wanna contribute to this,

176
00:10:23.014 --> 00:10:26.779
then you're going to the git clone,
or you'll fork it,

177
00:10:26.779 --> 00:10:30.790
then you'll clone it, and
then you'll cd into your clone.

178
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:34.690
And then run the install, and
run the setup script or whatever.

179
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.210
That's the place where
all that stuff would go.

180
00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.990
Issue template is a sweet new
feature that GitHub finally gave us,

181
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.090
that allows us to prefill issues and
pull, well,

182
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:49.630
the issue template is for
issues in the GitHub issue.

183
00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:54.150
So when somebody goes there they
can make sure that they provide all

184
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.830
the information that you're looking for
so you don't go back and forth.

185
00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.610
This is a great feature.

186
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:04.033
You can just put that in
the root of your repository, or

187
00:11:04.033 --> 00:11:09.339
you put it in GitHub/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
in your repository.

188
00:11:09.339 --> 00:11:12.490
If you check out the last branch for
this workshop,

189
00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:16.751
you will see all of these things set up so
you can get examples of them.

190
00:11:16.751 --> 00:11:18.735
Saved replies has also come.

191
00:11:18.735 --> 00:11:20.080
Take a look at that.

192
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.882
I think I'm just gonna keep
on going through this.

193
00:11:23.882 --> 00:11:27.270
So the same thing with pull requests.

194
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.000
The idea behind issues and

195
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.360
pull requests again with kind of the idea
of saving yourself from burn out and

196
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.730
helping other people kind of build
a community around this thing.

197
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.440
Early on when I was doing open source
I got really excited any time somebody

198
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.390
reported an issue or filed a pull request.

199
00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.300
It was like, sweet, I'm gonna do this now.

200
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.600
I even had one time where somebody
said hey, I've got this issue.

201
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.180
And five seconds later I said awesome,
time me.

202
00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.060
I'll have it released in five minutes.

203
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.300
It took me nine minutes but
I fixed the bug, I pushed it out.

204
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.140
It was tested and
it was released in nine minutes.

205
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.597
That is not a healthy way to
run an open source project.

206
00:12:05.597 --> 00:12:09.283
Sure, they were really excited and they're
like, yeah, you're the man, high fives,

207
00:12:09.283 --> 00:12:10.570
this was awesome.

208
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.890
And it felt great,
I was helping people, and

209
00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.430
that's one of the things
I love about open source.

210
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:19.790
But it turned out that that particular
library still has no owner.

211
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:22.060
I'm not interested in
maintaining it anymore.

212
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.310
I'm not using it.

213
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:29.211
I know that it's helping still hundreds,
if not thousands, of developers right now.

214
00:12:29.211 --> 00:12:33.900
But it's just not something that I have
the time or interest in maintaining.

215
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:39.020
But because I was so
zealous about doing everything myself,

216
00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.910
nobody has really taken
ownership over that library.

217
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:46.780
Luckily, I have semantic-release set up
on that library, so if somebody submits

218
00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:51.610
a pull request and it looks like
it will be fine, and I've got

219
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.480
Travis running the test and everything,
I can just hit the Merge button.

220
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.320
It gets released,

221
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.890
I don't even have to have it come onto my
machine anymore, which is really nice.

222
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:03.270
That's one of the biggest benefits for
semantic-release for me.

223
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.700
But yeah, get out of the way.

224
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.340
Let somebody else hit the green Merge
button, let somebody else solve the issue.

225
00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.950
If somebody says, I found this issue
with your library, you say, great!

226
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.510
Would you like to make a pull request?

227
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.970
And then you leave it at that.

228
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:21.280
Archive the email, because this is
our community, this is our code base.

229
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.490
And if you're the one having the problem
with that, I'm sorry about that,

230
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.280
but we're working together on this.

231
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.262
Now at the same time, if somebody is
new to the community and needs help,

232
00:13:31.262 --> 00:13:35.574
then you should be there to help assist
them and/or other community members in

233
00:13:35.574 --> 00:13:39.000
your community should be there
to help assist them with that.

234
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I think that's important, too.
