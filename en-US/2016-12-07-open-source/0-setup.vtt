00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.140
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: We're going
to build a library from scratch.

3
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.930
It's gonna be a really small library.

4
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.590
We'll write and run tests.

5
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.710
We'll transpile it.

6
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.150
We'll add continuous integration.

7
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.760
We'll add a browser build, and
then we'll publish a real project.

8
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.900
So, each one of you will have an NPM
module registered on the on the NPM

9
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.810
registry, hopefully,
if all works out for that part.

10
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.630
And it will be unique.

11
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.640
It's not just gonna be a clone, like
we'll have 100 clones of this same thing.

12
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.904
It'll be unique and useful.

13
00:01:14.904 --> 00:01:20.290
And then, actually,
I have a talk about managing

14
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.800
an open source project, and
that's how we'll wrap things up.

15
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.540
That's not exactly a workshop-y thing.

16
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.970
It's more of something you think about and
stuff.

17
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.380
So I'll kinda give that talk at the end.

18
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.680
One thing we're not going to do is I'm
not gonna focus on building a library.

19
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.590
We have so many different purposes for
the different libraries

20
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.940
that we're building and so that's
pretty hard to teach in a generic way.

21
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.037
I'll talk a little bit in that talk
about managing an open source library.

22
00:01:52.037 --> 00:01:57.130
I'll talk a little bit about how to
make it extensible and stuff like that.

23
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.816
But for the most part the library
is going to be very small and

24
00:02:01.816 --> 00:02:05.674
we'll kind of skip over
that stuff as we need to.

25
00:02:05.674 --> 00:02:09.892
And mostly we're gonna be
building the tooling around

26
00:02:09.892 --> 00:02:14.680
the library to make your life
as an open source author easier.

27
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.410
So requirements for the workshop.

28
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.810
Hopefully you all have
this set up already.

29
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.700
But you need git, node, NPM, and
then also a travis-ci.org account.

30
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.970
So if you don't have that set up,
go ahead and set that up.

31
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.110
It's pretty quick.

32
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.360
Just connect it with GitHub,
and a codecov.io account.

33
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.750
Connect that with GitHub as well.

34
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.250
These are things that we're gonna be
using to automate part of our project.

35
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.829
So, I leave that up for a second.

36
00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:50.813
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: So
it's travis-ci.org and codecov.io.

37
00:02:50.813 --> 00:02:55.640
Actually, you know what,
I should just copy this into the chat.

38
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.960
That is what I will do.

39
00:03:04.323 --> 00:03:09.150
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Whoops
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: There we go.

40
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.110
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Okay, so
let's go ahead and jump in.

41
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.790
So these are commands that you should
have run, hopefully beforehand.

42
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.710
I will paste those into that chat again,
as well.

43
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.945
There was a mistake in the instructions
that was sent out, that was my bad.

44
00:03:26.945 --> 00:03:29.180
Copy/paste error.

45
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.640
But you shouldn't be running any
server going to local host 8080.

46
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.840
That's not necessary for this workshop.

47
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.550
And when it's all said and

48
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.860
done, you should have a project
that looks like this.

49
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.273
You'll have a .git directory,
a known modules directory and

50
00:03:45.273 --> 00:03:47.110
a .git attributes file.

51
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.100
It's totally empty.

52
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.190
The reason that you have a node_modules
directory, I'll just kind

53
00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.140
of explain this really quick, is this npm
run setup:fem, for friend and masters.

54
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.270
What that is doing is it checks out
the very last branch of our workshop.

55
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.730
At every step is a branch,
and it runs NPM Install,

56
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.550
to install all the dependencies that we're
eventually going to have in the project,

57
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.340
and then it checks out the very first
branch, so the one that has nothing.

58
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.880
But it also deletes a couple
directories that are artifacts of

59
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.340
running some validation and stuff.

60
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.430
And so the reason that we do that is so

61
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.410
that throughout the workshop you don't
have to be constantly running NPM Install,

62
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.660
especially if you're on
a bad internet connection.

63
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.260
That can be a problem, and so

64
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.340
by installing everything upfront
you can just skip over that bit.

65
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.600
So that's why you have this node modules
directory It is not git ignored.

66
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.900
We don't have a git
ignore in here right now.

67
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.630
We'll actually add that
a little bit later.

68
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.360
Don't commit that.

69
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.140
Never commit your node model strength,
almost never.
