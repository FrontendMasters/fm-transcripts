00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.256
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Don't worry about
creating the Travis.yml right now, and

3
00:00:07.256 --> 00:00:09.871
just worry about updating
all of this stuff and.

4
00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:15.132
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Yeah, let's see,
I actually hadn't thought about

5
00:00:15.132 --> 00:00:17.840
the fact that we're on
a separate branch altogether.

6
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.960
You're gonna wanna watch this one too.

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.050
So, we're gonna go ahead and
create a new branch.

8
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.200
So git branch, shoot,
no, I have an alias for

9
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.930
creating a new branch, and now I
can't remember how to do it normally.

10
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.740
gitconfig.

11
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.800
Yeah, yeah.

12
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.586
git checkout -b [LAUGH], and

13
00:00:42.586 --> 00:00:47.820
we'll just call this
one (temp) --no-verify.

14
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.038
I think we've got some

15
00:00:52.038 --> 00:00:57.150
stuff kind of broken here.

16
00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.790
Hold on.

17
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.160
Yeah, and then we'll git add everything,
so sorry,

18
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.620
these are the commands, git checkout,

19
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.530
whatever you wanna call it, whatever
you wanna call your temporary branch.

20
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.330
We'll just call it (temp) --no-verify, and

21
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.400
then we'll git commit -an 'it is mine!'.

22
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.920
Commit that.

23
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.970
This error that we're getting is
because we cloned this thing anew.

24
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.150
And we haven't installed
all the dependencies yet.

25
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.130
And so, git hooks is having trouble.

26
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.310
So, you don't need to worry about it,
you just go ahead and no-verify.

27
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.693
Okay, what is that?

28
00:01:44.613 --> 00:01:50.120
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: That's weird,
go ahead and remove your node mod.

29
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.281
Well, goodness gracious, what is this?

30
00:01:57.175 --> 00:02:01.480
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Okay, so
we're gonna just get rid of our git hooks.

31
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.486
However you remove directories in
your platform, I'm using rm -rf,

32
00:02:07.486 --> 00:02:12.005
and this would be in .git/hook,
just delete that.

33
00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:14.037
And then you won't need
to worry about git hooks.

34
00:02:15.783 --> 00:02:20.498
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: And then, we're going
to totally swap out the Master branch

35
00:02:20.498 --> 00:02:25.980
with our temporary branch that we made,
and push that, yeah.

36
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.750
I knew this was gonna be
really complicated [LAUGH].

37
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.570
I hope that some people
are able to follow along.

38
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.996
We will have time to let you do this.

39
00:02:34.996 --> 00:02:39.390
I really love to have a couple of people
at least to be able to publish this stuff.

40
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.760
&gt;&gt; Student: So,
right now we're on the 0.8 branch, right?

41
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.799
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Yeah,
we're making changes from the 0.8 branch.

42
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.380
And so you make all of your changes, and

43
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.540
then you check out a new
branch called temp.

44
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.850
And then we're going to, let's see,

45
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.590
git branch -D, so
with a capital D, master.

46
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.490
Once I'm done with doing all this stuff,

47
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.760
I'm gonna take all these commands and
I'll put them in the chat.

48
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.440
So, don't worry about
memorizing all these commands.

49
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.350
So we're gonna delete the master branch.

50
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.429
And then we're gonna move temp to master.

51
00:03:28.344 --> 00:03:29.530
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Bad source.

52
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.527
Source is temp, destination is master.

53
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.650
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Wait, no,
that's not the command.

54
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.500
It's branch, okay.

55
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.290
Change then name of the branch get.

56
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.750
I Google sometimes, yeah.

57
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.550
git branch -m temp master.

58
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.260
Okay so now you're on master, you can
git push -f to force push on master,

59
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.770
which is something you should
never ever do except right now.

60
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.880
[LAUGH] Okay and
that's as far as I want you to get, so

61
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.720
a lot of stuff, let me put all this
stuff in the chat, yeah and then.

62
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.610
&gt;&gt; Student: So
where'd you get the temp name?

63
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.540
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: I just made it up.

64
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.816
&gt;&gt; Student: Did you rename or did you-
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: So

65
00:04:17.816 --> 00:04:22.040
that happened when I-
&gt;&gt; Student: Checked it out?

66
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.892
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Yeah, when I checked out
the new branch, so before I was on browser

67
00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:32.610
build, and then I said git checkout,
create new branch called temp.

68
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.590
&gt;&gt; Student: I didn't see that, okay.

69
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.930
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Yeah, so that's why
I'm gonna copy all these to the chat so

70
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.490
you all can see it.

71
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.920
But yeah, then hopefully we can
get some of you onto this stuff.

72
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.573
So let me pull up
Frontend Masters chat here.

73
00:04:54.675 --> 00:05:03.615
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Goodness gracious,

74
00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:05.330
this thing is not super.

75
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.842
This little plugin for the add-on is
great, but it's not always perfect.

76
00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:14.190
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: So

77
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.014
once you've made all of your changes,
then.

78
00:05:20.232 --> 00:05:22.470
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: These are the commands
that you're gonna run.

79
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.504
You'll check out a new branch,
whatever you wanna call it.

80
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.525
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Actually first
you just go ahead and git rm,

81
00:05:35.525 --> 00:05:42.040
or rm -rf.git, or
however you do it on Windows.

82
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.640
Just basically delete that branch or
that folder.

83
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.550
Then you'll check out
a new branch called temp.

84
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.408
And you can commit all of your stuff.

85
00:05:59.341 --> 00:06:02.241
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: And
then you will delete the master branch.

86
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.095
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: And then you'll
move the temp branch to master,

87
00:06:11.095 --> 00:06:13.740
which will move you to master.

88
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.065
And then you'll push with force.

89
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.437
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: And with that, if you
open up your browser to your fork refresh,

90
00:06:24.437 --> 00:06:28.868
you should that that you
recently made changes, and

91
00:06:28.868 --> 00:06:35.830
you should see the name of your library,
and all of your changes should be in here.

92
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.619
And this is what you're
gonna use to set up and

93
00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:45.350
publish your module and
all that fun stuff.
