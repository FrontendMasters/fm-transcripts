[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.888 --> 00:00:06.969
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: This next one we're
actually gonna check out a different

3
00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:11.480
branch, we're gonna skip over a branch,
and I'll show why here in a second.

4
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:19.187
If you once you check that out it's
git checkout -f FEM/03.0-add-data,

5
00:00:19.187 --> 00:00:24.659
and for this one, what it did was,
not only did it blow away

6
00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:29.684
all of your changes so
we don't have to test anymore,

7
00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:34.280
and if you put your own name,
it changed to mine.

8
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.690
We'll change that later, but
it also added a source directory with

9
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.510
a starwars-names.json file in here,
that has,

10
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.400
almost 100 names of random Star Wars
characters, including Yoda, and

11
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.265
I'm not even going to begin to try and
say some of these people's names,

12
00:00:54.265 --> 00:00:58.920
cuz it will reveal that I'm not as much
of a Star Wars nerd as I should be.

13
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.460
So, but yeah, a bunch of Star Wars names.

14
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.299
So let me explain the purpose of
the library that we're building.

15
00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:11.080
We are going to build a module that will
allow you to get a random Star Wars name,

16
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.001
like a random Star Wars characters name.

17
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:20.901
And so like, when you say,
like require('starwars-names').random(),

18
00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:26.538
that will give you back a string of
a random Star Wars character name,

19
00:01:26.538 --> 00:01:31.106
and then there will also be
an all property that will have

20
00:01:31.106 --> 00:01:34.280
that entire list that you can look at.

21
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.700
So, that's what we're trying
to accomplish here, and

22
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.860
that's what we're going to
write in this next step.

23
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.646
So, we're going to create the lib.

24
00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:46.870
This is for microlibs especially.

25
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.147
This is the easy part, and
often when you're open sourcing something,

26
00:01:50.147 --> 00:01:52.781
it's something that you've
already built internally,

27
00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:54.620
you want to take that and open source it.

28
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.485
So often you might think
of this as the easy part,

29
00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:02.732
especially for smaller libraries,
cuz managing and

30
00:02:02.732 --> 00:02:07.188
maintaining open source can
be challenging in itself.

31
00:02:07.188 --> 00:02:11.377
So, this is what we're going to
do [COUGH] for our exercises.

32
00:02:11.377 --> 00:02:15.163
If you want to you can pull up
the slides and look at this gitgif.

33
00:02:15.163 --> 00:02:18.360
This is exactly what we're going to do.

34
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.580
I'm actually going to lead this as
an exercise, not because it's totally,

35
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.562
there are a couple of things you'll
learn about managing open sources and

36
00:02:28.562 --> 00:02:33.810
making open source libraries by doing
this, but it's also just kind of fun.

37
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.650
So I'm gonna leave this to you.

38
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.650
All that I care about,
I'll give you a little bit of pseudo-code.

39
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.350
You're gonna need to have
a index.jsfile in here, and

40
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.960
you need to have a module
that exports an all

41
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.180
property that's going to have the array
of Star Wars names there, and

42
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.330
a random property that will be a function.

43
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.197
So, function, some function here,
and some array here,

44
00:03:07.197 --> 00:03:12.525
and as a pro tip, or
as the way that we're going to solve this,

45
00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:17.583
is you'll use unique-random-array to,
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Or

46
00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:22.960
actually, so you'll require the JSON file
that's totally a thing that node can do,

47
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.439
it can just require in JSON files to
get the array of Star Wars names, and

48
00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:32.900
then you'll use the unique-random-array
to create your random function.

49
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.620
So if you want to, you can reference the
gitgif, but this is kind of the fun part.

50
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.290
So, go hog wild.
