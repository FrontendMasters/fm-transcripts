2
00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:07.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So getting contributors,
because you can't do it on your own,

3
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.450
this is your contributor pipe line.

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.213
This comes from a block post called
healthy open source fantastic

5
00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:19.236
blog post by Michael Richards, or
Rogers, of the node foundation,

6
00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:23.850
and they are phenomenal at
managing an open search community.

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.000
It's really amazing what they've been able
to accomplish with such a huge community.

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.120
So your pipeline goes like this,
this white space out here is everybody in

9
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.160
the world, and a very, very small
section of the world are your users, and

10
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.260
a smaller section of those
users become contributors.

11
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.030
Contributors are people who
like write blog posts, and they

12
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.110
contribute documentation, and they record
screen casts, whatever, and then some

13
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.450
of those people are actually committers to
the project, so they have committed code,

14
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.880
and then a small portion of those
people are in the technical committee,

15
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.400
the ones who make decisions, the ones
who have the power to do releases.

16
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.895
So the one thing that might be
a little counterintuitive to you, and

17
00:01:05.895 --> 00:01:07.750
I'm actually jumping ahead here.

18
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.470
You might be thinking, okay, so

19
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.970
the commiters are the one who made
pull requests, and that's great.

20
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.780
No, commiters are the ones who
have made pull requests and

21
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.180
have commit access to the repository.

22
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.380
So it might surprise you to know that,
actually I'm not even sure how

23
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.860
many people, or how to find out how many
people have commit access to the repo.

24
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.836
But there are probably hundreds of people
who have commit access to the node repo,

25
00:01:33.836 --> 00:01:37.820
and they don't have release
access necessarily, but

26
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.600
they can commit directly to the repo.

27
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.468
And that has served them very well,
because as soon as somebody lands

28
00:01:44.468 --> 00:01:48.667
a nontrivial change, it's like this
isn't a documentation change, but

29
00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:51.816
this is actually core stuff,
then they say, awesome.

30
00:01:51.816 --> 00:01:55.304
Thank you for contributing,
you have commit access now, and

31
00:01:55.304 --> 00:01:59.460
that puts the onus on that contributor,
like whoa, and they step back and

32
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.113
think about it for a second like, this is
a big deal, I have commit access to node.

33
00:02:04.113 --> 00:02:06.988
I feel ownership over this project now,
and

34
00:02:06.988 --> 00:02:10.182
that's a really great way
to build a community.

35
00:02:10.182 --> 00:02:14.390
And so there are things that you can
do to protect things, obviously.

36
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.864
We've just automated releases by merging
in a master that automates releases.

37
00:02:19.864 --> 00:02:24.788
So there are ways you can protect the
master branch so that not just anybody can

38
00:02:24.788 --> 00:02:29.791
actually release anything, but by giving
these people commit access it gives

39
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:34.974
them a lot more feeling of ownership, so
I think that is a really important part.

40
00:02:34.974 --> 00:02:37.592
We talked about CONTRIBUTING.md.

41
00:02:37.592 --> 00:02:38.490
I need to delete that slide.

42
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.767
That's kind of a silly slide.

43
00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:44.913
And we talked about not
doing everything yourself.

44
00:02:44.913 --> 00:02:49.286
So supporting AMPAP, I made this up,
as many platforms as possible.

45
00:02:49.286 --> 00:02:54.710
So even though many of us use Mac
we should support Windows also.

46
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.740
This is an important part of being
an open and friendly community so

47
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.440
that we can have contributors
from all platforms.

48
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.610
So that is important.

49
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.130
Don't commit generated files,
they're really confusing.

50
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.168
I'm not gonna cover this,
you can go to kcd,im/generated to

51
00:03:11.168 --> 00:03:16.110
find out why we are excluding
the disk directory, but, yes,

52
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.692
it really hinders people
contributing to your project.

53
00:03:20.692 --> 00:03:22.185
Newbies are a really,

54
00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:26.190
really great pipeline into
contributing to your project.

55
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.752
They're really excited about life and
about developing, and so having issues

56
00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:35.942
like help wanted, and good for beginners,
or first-timers-only is really valuable.

57
00:03:35.942 --> 00:03:40.166
This first-timers-only thing is
something that I started like a year and

58
00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:43.191
a half ago where I reserve issues for
first-timers.

59
00:03:43.191 --> 00:03:45.808
So if you're not a first-timer,
I won't accept your poll request.

60
00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:48.719
First-timers are those who've never
contributed to open source before.

61
00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:52.527
It takes a lot of work to prepare
issues for first-timers, and so

62
00:03:52.527 --> 00:03:56.128
I don't do it like all the time,
but it's really valuable and

63
00:03:56.128 --> 00:03:59.938
people get really involved and
excited about your project when,

64
00:03:59.938 --> 00:04:03.075
like this is the first project
I ever contributed to.

65
00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:06.116
It's really exciting.

66
00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:09.616
Cool, then this is all contributors.

67
00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:12.895
At the bottom of the repo, of the readme,

68
00:04:12.895 --> 00:04:18.333
you can see this table of people who
have contributed to the project,

69
00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:23.460
and this is totally automatic,
and generated, and stuff.

70
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.010
Well, it's generated based off of JSON,
but there's a CLI to generate that JSON.

71
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.499
But by doing this,
you're putting your face on people,

72
00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:38.177
people's face on your library's
documentation page, or

73
00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:41.276
some prevalent place in your library.

74
00:04:41.276 --> 00:04:42.410
They feel like, wow.

75
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.585
Okay, not only do I have commit
access to this thing now, but

76
00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:47.055
I also, my face is on this.

77
00:04:47.055 --> 00:04:53.260
There's some warm and fuzzy feelings
that are associated with this, and

78
00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:00.785
actually, Wikipedia did a study in Germany
about retaining contributors to Wikpedia.

79
00:05:00.785 --> 00:05:06.953
Wikpedia and open source have kind of an,
some interesting relationship

80
00:05:06.953 --> 00:05:12.722
where we're both highly motivated
to get new contributors to stay,

81
00:05:12.722 --> 00:05:18.900
we're not paying anybody to do so,
and we're doing this at a huge scale.

82
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.577
So how do we manage this?

83
00:05:20.577 --> 00:05:25.103
So what Wikipedia did was they took,
I think they had 1,400 new contributors

84
00:05:25.103 --> 00:05:29.626
every month, and this is just in Germany,
and they took, they whittled that down

85
00:05:29.626 --> 00:05:33.891
to 300 people, and they had the control
group and the variable group, and

86
00:05:33.891 --> 00:05:37.366
with the variable group they gave
them a special award saying,

87
00:05:37.366 --> 00:05:40.350
thank you to your first ever contribution.

88
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.400
They put it on their profile page, it's
like this person contributed, and they

89
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.215
also had a special blog post where they
list out the people who contributed and

90
00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:54.170
thanked them, and they found that
that group that they gave those

91
00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:00.100
special rewards to were 20% more likely to
continue contributing over the next year

92
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.350
then the other people in the other group,
and they did this 11 times, for

93
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.790
11 months, and they found 20% more likely.

94
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.600
So I feel like this is
very much the same idea.

95
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.950
By giving people some
special recognition for

96
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.092
contributing, even non-code contributions.

97
00:06:15.092 --> 00:06:19.190
So GitHub is pretty good at saying hey,
these people contributed, you can see, but

98
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.440
contributions are more than just code.

99
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.290
Not everybody is good
at contributing code.

100
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.280
Some people, or
as good at contributing code,

101
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.120
some people feel uncomfortable about that.

102
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.290
Some people are really good at
contributing documentation, or

103
00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:36.190
answering questions on stack overflow or
in the chat, and so recognizing those

104
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.740
people I think is really important for
building a good community around projects.

105
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.630
I've actually, after having done some of
these things that I'm telling you about,

106
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.600
I'm been able to hand off projects
that I still cared about, but

107
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.070
didn't have time to maintain, and so now
I'm still benefiting from those projects,

108
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.630
but I don't have to maintain them.

109
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.640
That's pretty awesome.

110
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.955
I like not having to work.

111
00:06:57.955 --> 00:07:04.448
Then MAINTAINING.md is a good file
that you can add to talk about.

112
00:07:04.448 --> 00:07:05.670
Okay, here's how our infrastructure works.

113
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:10.710
We're using semantic relays to do this and
whatever else is important for

114
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.130
people who are helping you maintain the
project, and then I already talked about

115
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.740
giving commit access freely and
early, it's good, it's a good thing.

116
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.990
So here are a couple of resources,
you could find those later, and

117
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.640
yeah, that's pretty much
it on my talk on community.
