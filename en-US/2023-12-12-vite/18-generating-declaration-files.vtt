00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.642
We've got all that in place,
we've got the CSS modules,

2
00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:09.401
what we don't have is any of
the type annotations, right?

3
00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:13.424
And if you don't use TypeScript,
that's great, but

4
00:00:13.424 --> 00:00:19.195
even if you don't use TypeScript, I think
for a lot of, like VS Code will still

5
00:00:19.195 --> 00:00:24.639
like read the types even in regular
JavaScript, at least give you hints.

6
00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:29.174
So you saw it before we used
defineConfig in Vite,

7
00:00:29.174 --> 00:00:33.187
that it knew kind of the the answers,
right?

8
00:00:33.187 --> 00:00:38.691
So, there is a fun plug in
called vite-plugin-dts,

9
00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:44.795
which will basically for
any TypeScript, scan through it,

10
00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:50.795
and go ahead and create the dts file for
you in that library.

11
00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:55.075
So npm installed as
a development dependency,

12
00:00:55.075 --> 00:01:00.104
this vite-plugins.dts,
and to no one's surprise,

13
00:01:00.104 --> 00:01:05.564
we can go pull it in,
it's a default exports, I can call it.

14
00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:11.452
We'll say,
import dts from 'vite-plugin-dts',

15
00:01:11.452 --> 00:01:15.847
great, we'll put that in there as well.

16
00:01:15.847 --> 00:01:20.447
And it takes some options,
there's a whole bunch,

17
00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:26.104
what I really like is to,
what's the one that I'm looking for?

18
00:01:26.104 --> 00:01:28.040
Let's see, I'll start typing.

19
00:01:32.493 --> 00:01:37.272
I don't wanna roll,
lets say PluginOptions,

20
00:01:37.272 --> 00:01:41.701
see, sometimes this TypeScript stuff is neat.

21
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:47.651
All right, so you've got route, I want
all the same things in here as well.

22
00:01:48.986 --> 00:01:54.232
What I want, I think I want
insert type entry roll up types.

23
00:01:56.908 --> 00:02:02.414
Which is declarationOnly,
trying to remember which one I want.

24
00:02:02.414 --> 00:02:07.161
Let's just run it and see what we get in
the beginning, and we'll go from there.

25
00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:08.712
So, run build.

26
00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:16.710
So you can see at this point it did create
really, everything at this point, right?

27
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.744
And we could,
we could deal with that a little bit,

28
00:02:19.744 --> 00:02:24.406
it's not really bothering we've got
this main.dts, we've got actually,

29
00:02:24.406 --> 00:02:28.371
in our components, all the dts files for
everything in this case.

30
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:33.132
My components aren't in there though which
is kinda like a little bit squirrely,

31
00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:36.996
there is an option in roll up to do,
I believe it goes in the output or

32
00:02:36.996 --> 00:02:41.832
we could say, PreserveModules is true, and
you can kinda see how that changes it.

33
00:02:44.892 --> 00:02:46.928
I know it's conflicting
with another option, but

34
00:02:46.928 --> 00:02:49.119
that's actually not the one
that I care about so much.

35
00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:51.373
So if I run it with nothing,

36
00:02:51.373 --> 00:02:56.181
we see that I get everything as
if I was building a full app.

37
00:02:56.181 --> 00:03:00.046
I don't need the SVG from
the React template in my library,

38
00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:02.841
unless you need it, but I don't, right?

39
00:03:02.841 --> 00:03:06.028
In this case, I've got,
what I really wanna do is say, okay,

40
00:03:06.028 --> 00:03:10.259
we wanna put it all together, but we want
to just say what's in source components.

41
00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:14.485
If I run this, you'll see that
I'm a little bit better, right?

42
00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:17.882
It didn't pull in all of the other stuff,
like the application and

43
00:03:17.882 --> 00:03:20.136
everything that I'm running this code in.

44
00:03:20.136 --> 00:03:27.666
But it does include that SVG again, and so
the way to handle this is pretty simple,

45
00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:32.139
which is we can go in here,
and we can basically,

46
00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:38.282
in the build options, we can say,
copyPublicDir false, right?

47
00:03:38.282 --> 00:03:41.046
And this, yeah, if you didn't want
the public directory in your regular app,

48
00:03:41.046 --> 00:03:43.230
that would do the trick too, but
like in this case, we won't,

49
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.529
we don't want anything from there.

50
00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:49.639
And so now we've got the style,
we've got the various files,

51
00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:56.407
we've got the button.dts in here as well,
and we've got a bunch of that in place.

52
00:03:56.407 --> 00:04:00.887
Now, if you did wanna also build the app,
you could have two vite configs and

53
00:04:00.887 --> 00:04:05.367
you can do a --config on the vite
command and say, okay, for the library,

54
00:04:05.367 --> 00:04:06.634
we wanna build this.

55
00:04:06.634 --> 00:04:09.350
For the regular app,
we just use the regular base one,

56
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.494
you can have multiple vite configs,
and it will totally work.

57
00:04:12.494 --> 00:04:18.030
It was just like if you did npx
vite --config, and in my case,

58
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.566
I only have the one, button,
it will run that configuration,

59
00:04:23.566 --> 00:04:26.812
that was for the, we do it for build.

60
00:04:26.812 --> 00:04:31.268
If I had a different configuration for the
app versus the library, we would get those

61
00:04:31.268 --> 00:04:35.503
in place as well, so you could have
multiple configurations at this point too.
