1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.838
On that note,
should we have the TypeScript talk?

2
00:00:03.838 --> 00:00:08.289
Let's have the TypeScript talk.

3
00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:09.041
I'm trying to think.

4
00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:11.136
Let's do with add banner.

5
00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:12.797
Anyone wanna know how
to support TypeScript?

6
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:19.738
Watch, And

7
00:00:19.738 --> 00:00:24.058
I gotta make this string.

8
00:00:24.058 --> 00:00:25.010
It's angry about this.

9
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.229
We'll talk about how to
deal with that in a second.

10
00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:32.977
But generally speaking,

11
00:00:32.977 --> 00:00:37.970
as, Cool, all right, and so

12
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.775
other than this being slightly angry about
it doesn't know the type of the CSS file,

13
00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:47.123
there's some libraries that will just
generate the types if you needed to.

14
00:00:47.123 --> 00:00:51.274
You could also just declare
what the types are as well.

15
00:00:51.274 --> 00:00:55.644
But other than changing
the file extension,

16
00:00:55.644 --> 00:00:59.675
that's it, we now support TypeScript.

17
00:00:59.675 --> 00:01:00.890
I don't think I'm actually
calling that at this point.

18
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.006
But TypeScript is supported just
by changing the file extension.

19
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:08.064
No other configuration needed whatsoever,
it's all kinda built in.

20
00:01:08.064 --> 00:01:11.391
If you have a TS config file in there,
it will respect that,

21
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:14.199
everything is good to go
from the very beginning.

22
00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:17.661
There's nothing that you need to do,
TypeScript is just natively supported.

23
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:19.430
We're not gonna be writing
a lot of TypeScript today.

24
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.117
But occasionally, we do an addBanner,
how to configure something for

25
00:01:23.117 --> 00:01:25.022
TypeScript when we build a library,

26
00:01:25.022 --> 00:01:28.844
how to generate the types of it is based
on TypeScript, so on and so forth.

27
00:01:28.844 --> 00:01:34.347
But generally speaking, everything I've
said so far about all these JavaScript

28
00:01:34.347 --> 00:01:39.145
files also applies as well for
a given TypeScript file as well, right?

29
00:01:39.145 --> 00:01:41.534
All I have to do is add
the type annotations.

30
00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.740
The important thing to note, though,

31
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.514
is Vite is not gonna do your
type checking for you, right?

32
00:01:49.514 --> 00:01:51.651
It's gonna process those TypeScript files.

33
00:01:51.651 --> 00:01:56.449
It could be littered with a bunch of,
depending on what your TypeScript settings

34
00:01:56.449 --> 00:02:00.693
are, things that TypeScript's angry about,
it will still compile.

35
00:02:00.693 --> 00:02:05.960
The main reason for
this is that that takes time, right?

36
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.334
And a lot of the kind of fundamental idea
here is that the faster everything is,

37
00:02:10.334 --> 00:02:12.270
the faster your feedback loop is.

38
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.434
So you hit Save, you see on page.

39
00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:18.323
The quicker that time is, right,
the faster you can see that you

40
00:02:18.323 --> 00:02:23.149
messed something up, and the faster you
can make the decision to get either your

41
00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:27.711
test passing or that div vertically
centered, so on and so forth, right?

42
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:32.549
And so it's not doing that type checking,
it's simply compiling your JavaScript and

43
00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.145
rendering it,
which is all it promised to do.

44
00:02:35.145 --> 00:02:38.232
Generally speaking, if you use VS Code or
something along those lines,

45
00:02:38.232 --> 00:02:41.318
VS Code is gonna yell at you with red
squigglies and handle that for you and

46
00:02:41.318 --> 00:02:42.850
your editor in a separate process.

47
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.385
So you're still building fast,
you're still getting the type checking and

48
00:02:45.385 --> 00:02:45.899
development.

49
00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:49.882
And then the only thing, if you're using
TypeScript, that I would say that you

50
00:02:49.882 --> 00:02:53.926
should do, you don't have to do it, is
just to run the TypeScript compiler first

51
00:02:53.926 --> 00:02:57.995
before you build, and that will then blow
up if your TypeScript won't compile.

52
00:02:57.995 --> 00:03:00.805
Cuz Vite will just take your word for
it and go for it, right?

53
00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:05.018
Cuz it's aiming to be fast and
assuming that either your editor or

54
00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:10.320
the TypeScript compiler can go ahead and
do the type checking for you separately.

55
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.608
And this is happening in the process.

56
00:03:12.608 --> 00:03:15.850
Everything is fast cuz you're not
compiling it all, doing the type check,

57
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.127
and then rendering the page.

58
00:03:17.127 --> 00:03:20.529
You're rendering the page, and then you
can also either through your editor or

59
00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:22.786
through the build process,
do the type- hecking.

60
00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:26.377
But out of the box, all you gotta
do is change that file extensions,

61
00:03:26.377 --> 00:03:27.895
no pulling another loader.

62
00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:32.308
There was a time in my life where
a certain build tool that might start

63
00:03:32.308 --> 00:03:37.264
with web and end with pack had three
different TS loaders of various levels,

64
00:03:37.264 --> 00:03:42.548
support for various things, and I don't
wanna live like that anymore, right?

65
00:03:42.548 --> 00:03:46.118
And I don't wanna talk about the week of
my life that I lost in, I think, 2018,

66
00:03:46.118 --> 00:03:48.731
2019 to that cuz I don't have
to live like that anymore.

67
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:51.283
Because I just changed this and
everything works,

68
00:03:51.283 --> 00:03:54.914
and whatever settings are in your TS
config file are totally respected.

69
00:03:54.914 --> 00:03:57.481
When we get to templates and
stuff like that, too,

70
00:03:57.481 --> 00:04:01.663
you'll see that Vite provides a bunch of
templates that'll have most of this stuff

71
00:04:01.663 --> 00:04:05.330
wired up for you as well, and you can
kinda see a lot of stuff in there, too
