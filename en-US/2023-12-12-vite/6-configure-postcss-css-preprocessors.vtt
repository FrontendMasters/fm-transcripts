00:00:00.137 --> 00:00:08.627
All right, let's talk about
various ways to process CSS.

2
00:00:08.627 --> 00:00:10.809
Watch me as I set up PostCSS.

3
00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.673
I'm done, it's already there.

4
00:00:14.673 --> 00:00:20.976
We're good, perfect, great talk, but
let's actually configure it a little bit.

5
00:00:20.976 --> 00:00:26.939
So PostCSS is effectively built in, out of
the box, and we get everything in there.

6
00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.163
Now, granted,
a PostCSS configuration with nothing set.

7
00:00:32.163 --> 00:00:36.267
It's doing stuff, it's getting us those
hashes on the module and a few other

8
00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:40.642
things that are built in, but we could
theoretically extend that any way we want.

9
00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:46.000
And so over on the site, we go to
the PostCSS section, I do have a list

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.170
of all the plugins listed, or
on the site there's all the plugins

11
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.999
that are listed that they have where
you can pick whichever ones you want.

12
00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:00.696
There's all sorts of stuff, whether you
want polyfills for current syntax for

13
00:01:00.696 --> 00:01:04.449
older browsers, you wanna play around
with future syntax that's kinda still in

14
00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.346
the working draft phase and
have support for it in that sense.

15
00:01:07.346 --> 00:01:11.693
There's a bunch of utilities,
so on and so forth, right?

16
00:01:11.693 --> 00:01:16.567
For the most part, the ones that
I use in the app is Tailwind,

17
00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:18.748
cssnano for just minifying it.

18
00:01:18.748 --> 00:01:23.342
And autoprefixer, which will then take
anytime I use one of the ones that

19
00:01:23.342 --> 00:01:25.900
have a dash F, Webkit, dash whatever,

20
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.598
I can just write the regular one in
a polyfill all the additional classes.

21
00:01:30.598 --> 00:01:35.989
That's all in there for free, and
so we can just go grab one of them.

22
00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:37.827
It doesn't matter, you can pick.

23
00:01:37.827 --> 00:01:42.001
If you have a different favorite PostCSS
module, that's great or PostCSS plugin,

24
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.131
that's great, too.

25
00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:47.190
I'm gonna grab this one, cuz it's the one
that I always end up grabbing for

26
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.581
first of I'm just kinda
doing this by hand.

27
00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:57.431
And then all we need to do is put
a regular old postcss.config.

28
00:01:57.431 --> 00:02:02.968
I'm using the type module in my
package.json, so I have to do cjs.

29
00:02:02.968 --> 00:02:06.597
But if you're set to common.js,
you can just do .js as well.

30
00:02:06.597 --> 00:02:11.673
It does need to be common.js,
cuz PostCSS will blow up, otherwise.

31
00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:15.408
But you will know very
quickly in this case.

32
00:02:15.408 --> 00:02:19.632
The way to tell is if your
package.json has type module,

33
00:02:19.632 --> 00:02:23.862
you need to do cjs, if it doesn't,
you can just do .js.

34
00:02:23.862 --> 00:02:27.751
But if I change the file extension,
it will blow up.

35
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:34.676
And all I gotta do in this case is
do the old fashioned module.exports.

36
00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:41.672
And to configure, And
I'm gonna see because it's got the dash,

37
00:02:41.672 --> 00:02:45.992
I got to do this postcss-nested,
and I don't need any configuration.

38
00:02:45.992 --> 00:02:48.831
And this is not Vite per se,
this is PostCSS.

39
00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:51.851
But Vite has PostCSS all wired up,
ready to go.

40
00:02:51.851 --> 00:02:57.453
So in the same way, we don't even
have a Vite config file yet, right?

41
00:02:57.453 --> 00:02:59.013
It has a default config.

42
00:02:59.013 --> 00:03:01.024
It has a default PostCSS config.

43
00:03:01.024 --> 00:03:04.251
It's only if I have special opinions
that I need to overwrite anything.

44
00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:06.795
We've done zero configuration so far.

45
00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:11.432
All we've done really is write
some JavaScript with a few nods

46
00:03:11.432 --> 00:03:13.402
towards relative paths.

47
00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:18.128
And just using modern web technologies,
and the rest has happened for us,

48
00:03:18.128 --> 00:03:22.490
this is the first piece of configuration
we've even had to do so far.

49
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:29.102
And that will load in PostCSS, so
now I can do something, I don't know.

50
00:03:29.102 --> 00:03:33.400
I'm gonna make just another
CSS file real quick.

51
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.977
We'll call it postcss.css.

52
00:03:34.977 --> 00:03:38.667
This is just a different file,
so I can show you.

53
00:03:38.667 --> 00:03:44.343
So I can do something like button,
and I can do color is rebeccapurple,

54
00:03:44.343 --> 00:03:47.478
and then you can do that nested syntax.

55
00:03:47.478 --> 00:03:51.938
And then where you can do and then hover.

56
00:03:51.938 --> 00:03:54.690
We'll say that,
let's do the background color.

57
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.627
It'll be easier to see.

58
00:03:57.627 --> 00:04:00.245
Background color is rebeccapurple and
on hover.

59
00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:04.317
Does anyone have a favorite CSS color?

60
00:04:04.317 --> 00:04:09.022
Cuz otherwise we're picking
blanched almond, all right?

61
00:04:09.022 --> 00:04:11.154
This is why I'm an engineer and

62
00:04:11.154 --> 00:04:15.500
this is why we had to hire a designer
six months after I started,

63
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.260
because when I got to make design
decisions, they were bad, right?

64
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.896
Cool, so we've got that and
now really let's go

65
00:04:25.896 --> 00:04:30.988
take out our very pretty
styles that we had.

66
00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:35.198
We've got that one there.

67
00:04:39.492 --> 00:04:40.824
I don't even remember,
I've moved stuff around so much.

68
00:04:40.824 --> 00:04:44.628
I'm trying to remember where
I even put the other ones.

69
00:04:44.628 --> 00:04:46.025
Let's see what we got.

70
00:04:46.025 --> 00:04:47.356
What does it look like right now?

71
00:04:47.356 --> 00:04:49.284
We've got no CSS, it's perfect.

72
00:04:49.284 --> 00:04:52.365
All right,
we've just got our modules from before,

73
00:04:52.365 --> 00:04:56.210
so now what we'll do is we'll just
pull in this PostCSS file here.

74
00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.371
And you'll see that I could write syntax
that wasn't necessarily valid JavaScript.

75
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:06.842
There is a working spec for
that nested syntax.

76
00:05:06.842 --> 00:05:14.261
It's somewhat supported in the browsers,
but for our purposes.

77
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:17.753
Let's just say it's not.

78
00:05:17.753 --> 00:05:21.492
Actually, let's do it in, just to make
my point, let's do it in counter.

79
00:05:21.492 --> 00:05:22.338
We'll just pull in.

80
00:05:29.688 --> 00:05:33.609
Postcss.css, and
I could have named that file anything.

81
00:05:33.609 --> 00:05:37.005
And you can see that rebeccapurple,
and now I hover over them.

82
00:05:37.005 --> 00:05:43.314
And if we look at the sources in this
case, we find that file, you can see that.

83
00:05:43.314 --> 00:05:45.190
In this case, it transpiled it but

84
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.828
we are getting the hover classes
you can kinda see in there as well.

85
00:05:48.828 --> 00:05:51.569
It's actually going to just
add everything for us.

86
00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:55.333
And that syntax is now supported
just by having that PostCSS plugin.

87
00:05:55.333 --> 00:05:59.755
That's all we had to do is like, really,
we didn't even need to configure PostCSS

88
00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:03.815
until we wanted to add a plugin, and
out of the box, you will get all of that.

89
00:06:03.815 --> 00:06:07.853
Generally speaking these days,

90
00:06:07.853 --> 00:06:13.913
I don't tend to use SASS or
SCSS too much anymore.

91
00:06:13.913 --> 00:06:17.497
Most of what I ever wanted out of SASS or

92
00:06:17.497 --> 00:06:23.099
SCSS was either that nested
syntax and/or CSS variables.

93
00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:28.102
I have both, or I at least have one
because I have PostCSS built in.

94
00:06:28.102 --> 00:06:31.457
And I can get the nested
syntax while I wait for

95
00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:35.172
the working draft to get
into the browsers fully.

96
00:06:35.172 --> 00:06:38.745
But let's say hypothetically,
you're migrating to Vite,

97
00:06:38.745 --> 00:06:42.877
you've got a whole bunch of SASS or
SCSS and you just wanna use, right?

98
00:06:42.877 --> 00:06:45.788
So let's see what's involved in that.

99
00:06:45.788 --> 00:06:50.262
Let's just make another file,
we'll say it's sassy.sass.

100
00:06:53.406 --> 00:06:55.218
It doesn't even really
matter what I write in here.

101
00:06:59.497 --> 00:07:04.518
And we'll go ahead and
we'll just pull that in somewhere as well,

102
00:07:04.518 --> 00:07:07.217
cuz things are gonna blow up for me.

103
00:07:07.217 --> 00:07:16.757
sassy.sass, It should be blown up.

104
00:07:16.757 --> 00:07:19.559
All right, processor dependency,
sass not found.

105
00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:20.801
Did you install it?

106
00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:24.088
Try npm install -D sass.

107
00:07:27.458 --> 00:07:31.674
Because there's literally no concept
of SASS in this entire app whatsoever.

108
00:07:31.674 --> 00:07:34.963
So I'm like, that seems legit,
let's do that.

109
00:07:34.963 --> 00:07:35.603
All right, let's see.

110
00:07:35.603 --> 00:07:36.254
Let's go back.

111
00:07:36.254 --> 00:07:38.031
I think I probably have
to kill the server.

112
00:07:40.432 --> 00:07:42.254
All right, so
my syntax is a little messed up.

113
00:07:42.254 --> 00:07:45.344
And I think I've really
wanted SCSS in this case,

114
00:07:45.344 --> 00:07:49.033
cuz it's been a long time since
I've written actual SASS.

115
00:07:51.442 --> 00:07:54.033
Cool, now we go back.

116
00:07:59.338 --> 00:08:06.549
And so you can see it at least loads, right?

117
00:08:06.549 --> 00:08:09.105
I didn't really do much styling
in this case, I can go ahead and

118
00:08:09.105 --> 00:08:10.224
do it if I really wanted to.

119
00:08:10.224 --> 00:08:14.956
But all we had to do to support SASS was
just simply install SASS in our project.

120
00:08:14.956 --> 00:08:21.008
Again, in our kind of talks from before,
it's working, it's all in place.

121
00:08:21.008 --> 00:08:22.519
All right,
I didn't have to configure anything.

122
00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:23.865
I didn't have to add a SASS loader.

123
00:08:23.865 --> 00:08:26.805
I just needed the idea of SASS
at all installed in my app.

124
00:08:26.805 --> 00:08:30.922
So if you were migrating an app and
you already have SASS, guess what?

125
00:08:30.922 --> 00:08:34.898
Again, just like the PostCSS, just like
everything else, out of the box, done for

126
00:08:34.898 --> 00:08:37.363
you, configured,
ready to rock and roll, right?

127
00:08:37.363 --> 00:08:40.499
This is kind of like, it's simple and
easy to get started and

128
00:08:40.499 --> 00:08:43.823
you're not spending a whole bunch
of time configuring stuff and

129
00:08:43.823 --> 00:08:47.720
you can just kind of pull stuff in and
use it out of the box without thinking.

130
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.166
I think it's really great for
when you're starting a new project.

131
00:08:50.166 --> 00:08:53.855
It's always like, I come with a lot of
hopes and dreams of what this thing is

132
00:08:53.855 --> 00:08:57.311
gonna be, and I spend three days
trying to configure a build process so

133
00:08:57.311 --> 00:08:58.796
I can actually use anything.

134
00:08:58.796 --> 00:09:02.348
And then I lose all steam for
whatever I want it to do.

135
00:09:02.348 --> 00:09:05.537
Having a lot of this have been easy
to kinda get your setup in place.

136
00:09:05.537 --> 00:09:09.795
Again, we still have not written
a Vite config file at all, whatsoever.

137
00:09:09.795 --> 00:09:11.779
We've had to make sure SASS was there,
right?

138
00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:15.270
If we wanted a particular plugin,
we've had to put that in place.

139
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:19.844
But out of the box, we've had a lot
of the common table stakes for

140
00:09:19.844 --> 00:09:24.100
building applications just built in and
ready to go for us.
