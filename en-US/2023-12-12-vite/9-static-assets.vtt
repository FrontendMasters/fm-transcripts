WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.246 --> 00:00:04.671
All right, just some quick logistic
notes is everything we did so

2
00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:08.055
far is in this live coding,
importing JS and CSS.

3
00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:13.608
And we made that template repo on React,
we're going back to the starter now.

4
00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:17.702
That was basically to show you the plugin
in place, there's some React code.

5
00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:22.999
If you've used Create React app before,
just imagine if it was faster, right?

6
00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:27.372
And it calls it main.tsx instead
of index or whatever, and

7
00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:30.092
it has index.html on the top level.

8
00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:33.234
If you've used React before

9
00:00:33.234 --> 00:00:37.844
it's basically very
similar to the same thing.

10
00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:44.026
So let's get back to kinda
little basic starter.

11
00:00:44.026 --> 00:00:48.731
I would say that as I think about
the four acts, act 1, Vite is simple, and

12
00:00:48.731 --> 00:00:50.769
then act 2, Vite is powerful.

13
00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.428
Being that easy to pull in your
framework of choice is like that

14
00:00:55.428 --> 00:00:58.892
fulcrum between simple and
powerful, right?

15
00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.637
Cuz now, you've got whatever
framework makes you the happiest.

16
00:01:01.637 --> 00:01:06.435
You've got TypeScript configured the way
that you want it with not that much work.

17
00:01:06.435 --> 00:01:09.317
So it's both simple and powerful.

18
00:01:09.317 --> 00:01:13.962
I think as we start to move
into the powerful piece,

19
00:01:13.962 --> 00:01:18.822
we're gonna talk a little
bit about some of the things

20
00:01:18.822 --> 00:01:23.899
that are best practices that
maybe we don't always do,

21
00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.895
right, because sometimes I have deadlines,
right?

22
00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:35.756
And hand editing a bunch of images for
various sizes ain't gonna happen, right?

23
00:01:35.756 --> 00:01:38.992
It would be great if my tooling
could do stuff like that.

24
00:01:38.992 --> 00:01:42.406
It would be great if I could run my
static assets through my tooling.

25
00:01:42.406 --> 00:01:47.655
And it's one of those things
where there's wrapping your

26
00:01:47.655 --> 00:01:53.344
head around how Vite processes
static assets is not that hard.

27
00:01:53.344 --> 00:01:54.944
It's fairly simple.

28
00:01:54.944 --> 00:01:59.801
But it's one of those things where it's
like, if you don't know the two or

29
00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:01.806
three core little things, and

30
00:02:01.806 --> 00:02:06.584
it feels like dark science versus if
you just know how it works, then all of

31
00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:11.471
a sudden you have the ability to do
whatever the thing that you need to do is.

32
00:02:11.471 --> 00:02:15.343
So I'm gonna spin up the server again,
it's at 5173.

33
00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:20.066
And let's say that we want to
bring in some kinda static asset.

34
00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:26.904
By a static asset, I mean something that's
not CSS or JavaScript in this case, right?

35
00:02:26.904 --> 00:02:32.695
Images, count, fonts, count,
SVGs, I guess those are images,

36
00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:36.473
but you know what I mean,
so on and so forth.

37
00:02:36.473 --> 00:02:41.394
The other things in our web
apps that are not the CSS, and

38
00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:44.550
the JS, and/or the HTML, right?

39
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.549
And the most standard way to do this is,

40
00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.345
the wrong file, there we go.

41
00:02:53.345 --> 00:02:54.038
Let's do it.

42
00:02:54.038 --> 00:02:57.580
Yeah, if anything is in the public directory,

43
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.725
as when we saw that build,
they got copied over as they were, right?

44
00:03:02.725 --> 00:03:08.746
All of my assets that were from the build
stuff, those got hashes on them, right?

45
00:03:08.746 --> 00:03:11.615
Anything in the public directory
is effectively just lifted and

46
00:03:11.615 --> 00:03:15.227
shifted over into the dist directory, except
instead of being the public directory,

47
00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:16.733
they're putting the top level.

48
00:03:16.733 --> 00:03:20.084
So that when you do, whatever.com/images,

49
00:03:20.084 --> 00:03:25.210
it's not /public/images,
it's just they're moved up to the root.

50
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.991
But effectively, that's all that happens.

51
00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:31.560
Now, that might not be what you want,
right?

52
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.843
Maybe you do want to hash them, right,
so that they're cached appropriately.

53
00:03:35.843 --> 00:03:39.021
So the image changes, they're not
getting the old one from cache.

54
00:03:39.021 --> 00:03:40.051
Maybe that's what you want.

55
00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:44.936
Maybe you wish that your build tool
could theoretically process any of

56
00:03:44.936 --> 00:03:48.515
these static assets,
depending on what they are.

57
00:03:48.515 --> 00:03:51.139
And the cool thing about Vite is that,
sure,

58
00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.499
we're gonna pull images at first.

59
00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:58.467
But with any of these plugins that we'll
see towards the very end, if you wanted to

60
00:03:58.467 --> 00:04:03.165
be able to pull in YAML and work on it
like it was JSON, you can do that, right?

61
00:04:03.165 --> 00:04:07.743
If you want to be able to run all the SVGs
through SVG go, which is the optimizer

62
00:04:07.743 --> 00:04:12.120
takes out all the other craft and
gets the file size down, you can do this.

63
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.298
There are plugins for all of these things.

64
00:04:15.298 --> 00:04:20.302
So in the same way that CSS, you can't
really, I guess, the correction to what I

65
00:04:20.302 --> 00:04:25.233
said before, there was a question like,
the import syntax web standard,

66
00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:28.866
it is web standard when you're
importing in JavaScript.

67
00:04:28.866 --> 00:04:31.265
But as most of us know, you cannot import,

68
00:04:31.265 --> 00:04:35.280
you can't just run TypeScript in
the browser, you can't import CSS.

69
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.712
Vite is basically,

70
00:04:36.712 --> 00:04:42.624
if you saw when I looked at my Sources tab
turning it into JavaScript, that that it then loads.

71
00:04:42.624 --> 00:04:48.136
So those CSS modules were turned into
five lines of JavaScript that's gonna

72
00:04:48.136 --> 00:04:53.836
add a link tag with that style or style
tag with those styles in it onto the page.

73
00:04:53.836 --> 00:04:55.989
And TypeScript has literally
just turned into JavaScript.

74
00:04:55.989 --> 00:05:00.794
But it's turning it into JavaScript,
which is then web standard.

75
00:05:00.794 --> 00:05:06.436
Just gonna do something similar
with the images as well.

76
00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:10.615
And so I've got one image here and
it's called steve-after-a-workshop.

77
00:05:12.514 --> 00:05:17.972
There, that's me sitting in front of my
house after two days of teaching, right?

78
00:05:17.972 --> 00:05:21.744
And so right now,
that's just copied wholesale into,

79
00:05:21.744 --> 00:05:24.884
that is literally my front porch,
by the way.

80
00:05:24.884 --> 00:05:28.446
There's one dressed up
like my son as well and

81
00:05:28.446 --> 00:05:33.528
I like that everyone in the neighborhood
knew who it was as well.

82
00:05:33.528 --> 00:05:38.209
So If I wanna pull this up right now,
it's in the images directory and

83
00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:43.315
I could theoretically go in and
just like, it's just an image tag really.

84
00:05:43.315 --> 00:05:47.752
I can go into index.html at this point and
I can just say like, I don't know,

85
00:05:47.752 --> 00:05:48.924
put in the content.

86
00:05:48.924 --> 00:05:55.697
We'll say img and we'll say the source.

87
00:05:55.697 --> 00:06:00.693
And again, it's in the public directory

88
00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:04.697
under /images/, where is it?

89
00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:07.789
Could have picked a shorter
file name 2020 hindsight.

90
00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.992
Put that in there.

91
00:06:12.992 --> 00:06:17.157
Seemed like a good idea at the time
that I wasn't standing live coding.

92
00:06:17.157 --> 00:06:21.585
Pop that in and put it in place and

93
00:06:21.585 --> 00:06:25.531
we should see it on the page.

94
00:06:25.531 --> 00:06:28.678
It's angry about some
other stuffs I changed.

95
00:06:28.678 --> 00:06:30.220
I think I change that to a .ts before, so

96
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.260
we'll fix that real quick while
I was talking coding earlier.

97
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:40.323
Turn that back to a JS, because
that's the file that we're requiring.

98
00:06:40.323 --> 00:06:42.592
And now, we'll get rid of
that TypeScript annotation.

99
00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:46.302
And then I'll go back to my main point.

100
00:06:48.327 --> 00:06:53.521
All right, cool, I have an image.

101
00:06:53.521 --> 00:06:57.042
It is ginormous,
cuz I literally just took it.

102
00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:58.364
I got a fancy phone now.

103
00:06:58.364 --> 00:07:00.539
It takes nice pictures,
and they're big and

104
00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:02.607
I just literally took the file wholesale.

105
00:07:02.607 --> 00:07:07.353
And I copied it in, cuz I was trying to
make a point, which I'm about to make.

106
00:07:07.353 --> 00:07:08.728
So we can put an image tag in there.

107
00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:14.216
But now, it's basically my entire
app is the file size of the image

108
00:07:14.216 --> 00:07:19.318
plus however many characters
are live code written with you.

109
00:07:19.318 --> 00:07:23.668
And it'd be great if we could actually
figure out and work with the 7.

110
00:07:23.668 --> 00:07:28.507
We'll actually see that this will start
very simple, and we'll see actually

111
00:07:28.507 --> 00:07:33.420
Vite has a few other non-webbish standard
things that make this even better and

112
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.282
practical for us in a little bit, but
let's start with the kind of core piece.

113
00:07:38.282 --> 00:07:44.827
So we know that that's one way to go about
doing it, but that's just HTML, right?

114
00:07:44.827 --> 00:07:47.726
That's how we're all showing up here for
today.

115
00:07:47.726 --> 00:07:53.836
So let's go ahead and let's look
at some other ways to handle this.

116
00:07:53.836 --> 00:07:59.635
So what we can do instead is we
can go ahead and say index.js.

117
00:07:59.635 --> 00:08:05.845
Well, let's go ahead and
let's import image.

118
00:08:05.845 --> 00:08:07.396
We're gonna take it, we're gonna move it.

119
00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:09.916
Anything in the public directory,
we can't access, right?

120
00:08:09.916 --> 00:08:13.543
You can only get stuff in source,
right, in that source folder.

121
00:08:13.543 --> 00:08:17.963
Otherwise, you can't go up five file
directories in the file system and

122
00:08:17.963 --> 00:08:18.764
grab stuff.

123
00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:23.484
It's like, I live here, I watch files
here, please keep this easy for me.

124
00:08:23.484 --> 00:08:26.057
So we'll just go and we'll grab this, and

125
00:08:26.057 --> 00:08:30.421
we're just literally gonna move it
into the source directory, right?

126
00:08:30.421 --> 00:08:34.132
Cool, yeah, I got it in there perfect.

127
00:08:34.132 --> 00:08:40.307
So I can do image from, check this out.

128
00:08:40.307 --> 00:08:46.140
It does not out of the box, right?

129
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:46.700
VS CODE,

130
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:51.542
without a little bit of tweaking is not super keen
on knowing that I can autocomplete that.

131
00:08:51.542 --> 00:08:54.821
But steve-after-workshop.jpg, and

132
00:08:54.821 --> 00:09:00.822
really all I'll do real quick is I'm
going to console log the image, right?

133
00:09:00.822 --> 00:09:02.837
So you can see what
we're working with here.

134
00:09:02.837 --> 00:09:06.067
We're not gonna do anything
with it just yet, right?

135
00:09:06.067 --> 00:09:10.770
We'll go to the console and
you can see that it knows the URL.

136
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.713
It's basically giving me
back the URL in this case

137
00:09:15.713 --> 00:09:20.546
of the image, right,
so that's interesting.

138
00:09:20.546 --> 00:09:22.508
I think if I just build it right now,

139
00:09:22.508 --> 00:09:25.853
it'd be interesting to tree
shaking does anything with it.

140
00:09:25.853 --> 00:09:27.403
Let's go npm run build.

141
00:09:27.403 --> 00:09:31.701
So we can see when we run the build,
that we actually get the hashed build.

142
00:09:31.701 --> 00:09:35.107
And you can see this was
effectively 5 megabytes.

143
00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:36.650
We'll deal with that in a second.
