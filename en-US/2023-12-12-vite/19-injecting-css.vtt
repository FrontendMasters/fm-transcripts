00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.849
The other thing you can do is,
we could inject the styles as well.

2
00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:13.660
Cuz if I look at my file, I'm not entirely
sure that we've got the styles separately.

3
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.557
So there is another library for
that, injectCSS.

4
00:00:17.557 --> 00:00:19.597
We'll do inline-css later.

5
00:00:19.597 --> 00:00:24.270
Inject, no,
we gotta put the T on there too.

6
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.083
There we go.

7
00:00:25.083 --> 00:00:26.435
Inject some CSS.

8
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.970
Awesome.

9
00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:35.518
Import injectCSS.

10
00:00:38.626 --> 00:00:40.172
Vite-plugin.

11
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.594
And we'll throw that in here as well.

12
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.109
Does it [SOUND].

13
00:00:58.882 --> 00:00:59.421
There it is.

14
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:00.421
That's what it's called.

15
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:02.371
All right, cool.

16
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:04.588
So now we're on it again.

17
00:01:04.588 --> 00:01:06.157
Nope, not the install.

18
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.253
Awesome, so this is index.css.

19
00:01:17.253 --> 00:01:22.584
You can see that now, the files will
also import the CSS file as well.

20
00:01:22.584 --> 00:01:26.846
So now when I pull in the module,
it will then pull in the index.css.

21
00:01:26.846 --> 00:01:31.669
And we know that then Vite will do
the work on the consuming application

22
00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:34.544
to then pull them both
in at the same time.

23
00:01:34.544 --> 00:01:37.657
So now when I pull the module,
I also pull in the CSS.

24
00:01:37.657 --> 00:01:40.750
Those styles, if we look are scoped,
to that module.

25
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.950
So now, theoretically,
unless I made a boo-boo, gonna happen.

26
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.959
If somebody pulls in this module,

27
00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.001
they're gonna get a styled button
the way it should be, right?

28
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:53.180
There's not a whole bunch of
stuff they have to have set up.

29
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.121
They're gonna get the CSS
that isn't imported along

30
00:01:58.121 --> 00:02:02.089
with the module as they
begin to pull it in.
