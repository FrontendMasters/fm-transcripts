00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.462
There's other cool things
that Vite gives us.

2
00:00:04.462 --> 00:00:09.574
And one of them is Node has
always let us import JSON and

3
00:00:09.574 --> 00:00:12.988
treat it like JavaScript, right?

4
00:00:12.988 --> 00:00:17.713
You could always in the earliest versions
of Node do Require and then a JSON file

5
00:00:17.713 --> 00:00:22.530
and you would get a JavaScript object you
wouldn't have to do a JSON parse on it.

6
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.950
You would always just get it.

7
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.696
The problem, and it's not actually
a problem of CommonJS read large,

8
00:00:27.696 --> 00:00:30.080
is there ain't no tree
shaking in common JS.

9
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.811
You were getting the whole JSON
file whether you liked it or not.

10
00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:39.915
You can halt everything in CommonJS,
whether you like it or not.

11
00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:44.595
VITE understands that it is likely that
you might wanna have some data in a JSON

12
00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:45.536
file, right?

13
00:00:45.536 --> 00:00:49.220
Other than you could just
export default an object, too.

14
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.445
But you might choose to

15
00:00:54.445 --> 00:00:59.399
pull in just a field.

16
00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.440
And so one of the things that VITE
gives you is the ability, and

17
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.567
I have some JSON files in here just for
funzies.

18
00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:09.679
They're totally randomized D&amp;D characters.

19
00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:13.184
I don't play D&amp;D, so if anyone
knows there's anything wrong here.

20
00:01:13.184 --> 00:01:18.651
I'm sorry, email, Dustin,
and we'll fix it.

21
00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:19.830
And it'll be great.

22
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.050
Let's say this is a giant JSON file,
right?

23
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.784
And let's say I only wanted the name,
right?

24
00:01:27.784 --> 00:01:33.740
Well, pulling in the rest of the JSON
file might add a lot to the bundle.

25
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.930
And I don't want that.

26
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.003
And so what I can do is, let's just do
it in index so I can see it with the build,

27
00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:40.448
I like running the build.

28
00:01:40.448 --> 00:01:44.421
This is my new, wasn't the original plan,
but I'm into it.

29
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:49.676
If we did import, let's do gandorf.

30
00:01:53.228 --> 00:01:54.613
From

31
00:01:54.613 --> 00:02:03.276
./characters/gandorf.

32
00:02:03.276 --> 00:02:07.827
And, I have some ways to render the DOM,
but

33
00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:12.506
I most just wanna show
you in the build tools.

34
00:02:12.506 --> 00:02:15.169
Let's go ahead and
let's see what that looks like in here.

35
00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.860
You can see the entire
thing is loaded in there.

36
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.090
If I go into the sources and go to
characters and slide in this entire file.

37
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.565
But you'll notice something really cool
is look what it did as it pulled it in.

38
00:02:30.565 --> 00:02:34.054
export default is the entire file, right?

39
00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:38.965
But it also went through the JSON file and

40
00:02:38.965 --> 00:02:45.904
it made exports for
every single variable on it, right?

41
00:02:45.904 --> 00:02:50.856
And so then what I can do is
actually I could just do name.

42
00:02:52.843 --> 00:02:57.467
And it's only gonna pull in just the name,
which means when we go to build is gonna

43
00:02:57.467 --> 00:03:01.699
tree shake out all those other
properties cuz they're not used, right?

44
00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:04.251
And so
now instead of using the entire JSON file,

45
00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:06.563
I'm only gonna get that one name property.

46
00:03:06.563 --> 00:03:08.643
I don't know if it'll show
me in the sources but

47
00:03:08.643 --> 00:03:11.303
we're about to find out if not,
I'll show you in the build.

48
00:03:13.753 --> 00:03:16.852
Let's go check it out now.

49
00:03:16.852 --> 00:03:20.648
But if we go and we run the build,

50
00:03:20.648 --> 00:03:25.016
I kind of wanna make it its own chunk.

51
00:03:25.016 --> 00:03:26.892
Hold on, let's do this.

52
00:03:26.892 --> 00:03:31.695
Just to really demonstrate like
that fact that we're only gonna get

53
00:03:31.695 --> 00:03:32.965
the part we need.

54
00:03:32.965 --> 00:03:35.557
We'll do import.

55
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:39.494
And then only pull in the name

56
00:03:48.517 --> 00:03:50.837
And then we'll do npm run build

57
00:03:57.467 --> 00:04:01.818
So we got this little
JavaScript file over here.

58
00:04:01.818 --> 00:04:03.794
It seems pretty big, but

59
00:04:03.794 --> 00:04:08.322
I wonder if I might have that
image in there or somewhere.

60
00:04:08.322 --> 00:04:10.535
Hopefully, I don't embarrass myself,
we'll find out.

61
00:04:21.724 --> 00:04:24.841
I can't find it faster, but it will for

62
00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:29.106
the most part try to pull out
just the part that I need.

63
00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:35.675
Unfortunately, the minified code
is borderline impossible to read.

64
00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:39.427
But, it will tree shake out all the parts
that I don't need, cuz as you can see,

65
00:04:39.427 --> 00:04:41.454
it was turning it into
a regular ES module.

66
00:04:41.454 --> 00:04:44.951
And ES modules have tree shaking
in them when we're not trying to

67
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:49.240
read minified code where they've turned
that variable into a single letter.

68
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.229
But we will actually be able to shake out
all the things you get a whole bunch of

69
00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:53.082
powerful features.

70
00:04:53.082 --> 00:04:57.054
That again, yes, I want us to get that
a little bit of a Vite-specific thing.

71
00:04:57.054 --> 00:04:59.910
But there are a few patterns where again,
I didn't tweak, okay,

72
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:00.987
go shake this stuff out.

73
00:05:00.987 --> 00:05:03.699
I basically get, hey,
these are the things you want.

74
00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:09.123
It's going to under the hood, turn all
that stuff into modern JavaScript,

75
00:05:09.123 --> 00:05:13.883
which gets us all of the ability to
have just the parts that we need.
