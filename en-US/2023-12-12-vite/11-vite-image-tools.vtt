00:00:00.044 --> 00:00:03.942
We're gonna look at this thing
called Vite Image Tools.

2
00:00:03.942 --> 00:00:06.582
However, if you are on an M1 MacBook,

3
00:00:06.582 --> 00:00:11.147
you might have to run this command
if it doesn't immediately work.

4
00:00:11.147 --> 00:00:13.550
So I'm gonna kinda put
this out here right now.

5
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.492
But what we wanna do is this tool, Vite
Image Tools relies on this thing called

6
00:00:18.492 --> 00:00:23.226
sharp, and sharp is basically a library
for processing images, right?

7
00:00:23.226 --> 00:00:27.831
And so basically it can allow you in your
build process to dynamically resize images

8
00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:29.620
or anything along those lines.

9
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.679
So we'll get it working in a second, but
what I wanna do is just verify our setups.

10
00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:41.051
And like I said, if you have any issues,
just basically making sure it's built for

11
00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:43.676
the right platform should do the trick.

12
00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.492
But that way,
if we have to triage anyone's set up,

13
00:00:46.492 --> 00:00:51.610
including those in the chat, we can try to
do that a little bit during lunch as well.

14
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.228
So what I'm gonna do is I
am gonna install this now.

15
00:00:55.228 --> 00:00:58.490
I'm gonna just do npm
install-vite-Imagetools.

16
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.033
This will be the first plugin that we're
gonna install by hand at this point.

17
00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:07.041
And I do need a configuration file,
don't I?

18
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:10.832
Right, and
this is the first time we've actually,

19
00:01:10.832 --> 00:01:13.427
we had one when we did the template.

20
00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:17.070
This is the first time
we've done one on our own.

21
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.078
But we've got that installed, and so

22
00:01:20.078 --> 00:01:25.256
now really all that I need to do
is I can touch a vite.config.js.

23
00:01:25.256 --> 00:01:30.130
If you are using TypeScript,
you can use.ts at the end.

24
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.846
If you are a CommonJS but
you wanna import modules, you can do .mjs.

25
00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:39.684
If you want it to be CommonJS,
you can do .cjs, it doesn't matter.

26
00:01:39.684 --> 00:01:41.951
Vite doesn't care,
it'll look for any of those.

27
00:01:41.951 --> 00:01:45.112
I'm just gonna go for js for our purposes.

28
00:01:45.112 --> 00:01:48.450
And we'll go ahead and
we'll bring that back up in our editor.

29
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.740
And in this empty file,

30
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.020
you kinda saw before when we
had the React stuff in place,

31
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.307
so we'll just import
{defineConfig} from 'vite'.

32
00:02:02.307 --> 00:02:09.781
And then we're gonna import image
tools from Vite image tools as well.

33
00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:14.338
We'll get that all ready to go.

34
00:02:14.338 --> 00:02:18.260
Just making sure,
I think it's just imagetools in this case,

35
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.150
find out together, from vite-imagetools.

36
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.195
[SOUND] What you angry about?

37
00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:27.202
That colon is not a semicolon.

38
00:02:27.202 --> 00:02:31.070
Great, so we got that in place.

39
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.076
And now what we're gonna do is we'll
go ahead and we'll say, actually,

40
00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:40.944
it is a, imagetools.

41
00:02:40.944 --> 00:02:48.880
And now really all we gotta do
is export default defineConfig.

42
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.813
And for me, I'm just gonna
say this plugins is an array.

43
00:02:55.813 --> 00:02:59.202
And I'm gonna say, imagetools and
verify that works.

44
00:02:59.202 --> 00:03:02.440
Now, I am pretty confident
that my setup is working.

45
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.890
If not,
you can watch me triage it real quick.

46
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.210
But if you have any issues, again, I
think it's only on certain Apple silicon.

47
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.368
So generally speaking,
if you are not on an M1, M2, or

48
00:03:13.368 --> 00:03:17.874
nobody's on an M3 at this moment,
then it should work fine,

49
00:03:17.874 --> 00:03:21.964
but if you have that one issue,
then we can deal with it.

50
00:03:21.964 --> 00:03:25.771
So we'll go ahead and just do npm run dev.

51
00:03:30.163 --> 00:03:32.778
Cool, all right, so for me right now,
since it doesn't blow up,

52
00:03:32.778 --> 00:03:33.681
it is mostly in place.

53
00:03:33.681 --> 00:03:37.525
If it blows up for you, like I said,
if that command does not work, and again,

54
00:03:37.525 --> 00:03:38.943
that's a one-time thing.

55
00:03:38.943 --> 00:03:42.945
And generally speaking, the nice part
is if you're using GitHub actions or

56
00:03:42.945 --> 00:03:47.462
whatever, all the Linux builds don't have
that one issue that you have to deal with.

57
00:03:47.462 --> 00:03:50.311
It's only on a select set of
Macs at a certain point, and

58
00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:54.452
I believe it's mostly fixed, but in case
you just have one of those situations.
