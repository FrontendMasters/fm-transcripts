00:00:00.221 --> 00:00:06.344
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: What I think is and
it doesn't look all that special, but

2
00:00:06.344 --> 00:00:12.477
you can also say for
given file types, custom settings.

3
00:00:12.477 --> 00:00:16.211
Which is, okay, these are my settings but
if I am in this case,

4
00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:18.544
I just want prettier on all the things.

5
00:00:18.544 --> 00:00:22.671
I can probably move that out of one, I
think what happened is if you go to format

6
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:26.627
a file and there is no formatter set,
it goes, which one do you wanna use?

7
00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:29.436
And then it updates this,
I didn't do this by hand.

8
00:00:29.436 --> 00:00:33.547
But you can theoretically for
different kinds of files,

9
00:00:33.547 --> 00:00:39.799
let's say hypothetically you're working at
a code base where the front end engineers

10
00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:45.553
really want two space indents, but
the Python engineers want four space tabs.

11
00:00:45.553 --> 00:00:48.651
Or does it go eight spaces or
something horrific?

12
00:00:48.651 --> 00:00:51.913
So theoretically for the go files,
you could have the settings for

13
00:00:51.913 --> 00:00:54.018
the go files and for the Typescript files.

14
00:00:54.018 --> 00:00:58.071
You can get a little more nuanced,
and like we said before,

15
00:00:58.071 --> 00:01:00.923
those language preferences like Stack.

16
00:01:00.923 --> 00:01:04.592
So TypeScript is
an extension of JavaScript,

17
00:01:04.592 --> 00:01:08.546
JavaScript React is
an extension of JavaScript.

18
00:01:08.546 --> 00:01:12.708
Markdown might be an extension
of HTML at one point,

19
00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:16.504
you can see all these
things at various points.

20
00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:19.624
Also if you open up a brand new file,

21
00:01:19.624 --> 00:01:25.251
what you want the default language
to be rather than plain text.

22
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:28.196
If I'm preparing for a workshop,
I want it to be marked down.

23
00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:31.718
If I'm writing code at work,
I usually wanna be TypeScript,

24
00:01:31.718 --> 00:01:34.917
cuz I'm just trying to
scratch something out, right?

25
00:01:34.917 --> 00:01:36.258
But you can set what you want it to be.

26
00:01:36.258 --> 00:01:40.731
This one will also then try to you just
start typing it will try to figure it out.

27
00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:43.990
Works great for
people a little bit more patience than me.

28
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.031
Yeah, a this point I changed the terminal
font size, so on and so forth.

29
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:51.038
This is when we set that material icon
theme just before we target extensions,

30
00:01:51.038 --> 00:01:52.140
that's in here now.

31
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.110
The setting I just changed earlier,
it's here now as well.

32
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.583
And the nice part is for
any given setting,

33
00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:03.356
you can right click on it or
maybe hit the gear.

34
00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:07.821
You can copy that setting ID
just that setting as JSON.

35
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:09.796
Literally linked to
the setting to somebody.

36
00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:15.676
So they click that link into Open VS Code
at that setting, so on and so forth.

37
00:02:15.676 --> 00:02:18.830
If you have multiple profiles,
you can pick what sinks and what doesn't.

38
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.059
A lot of different setting
features in there, yeah,

39
00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:26.811
I have usually this always turned on,
which is update the import on file move.

40
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:30.097
I don't know if that's the default or
not, but if it doesn't work,

41
00:02:30.097 --> 00:02:32.081
that's the one where
if I move the file and

42
00:02:32.081 --> 00:02:35.047
it changed all the imports
automatically for me, love that.

43
00:02:35.047 --> 00:02:40.736
Organize imports will,
if you have an import that is not

44
00:02:40.736 --> 00:02:45.950
used in that file,
it will just remove it, right?

45
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.119
Yeah, you can also have
it set to sort them,

46
00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:54.875
which for
some reason is a hill that I wanna die on.

47
00:02:54.875 --> 00:03:01.904
In our core project, I actually have
an ESN rule that follows my very type

48
00:03:01.904 --> 00:03:07.219
A ordering, which is Node stuff first,
then a space.

49
00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.982
Then third party libraries,
then stuff in my utilities folder,

50
00:03:11.982 --> 00:03:17.364
then relative stuff, and then React
components, or spell components.

51
00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:21.122
I feel strongly about this, no one else
on my team does, but I'm the boss.

52
00:03:21.122 --> 00:03:23.580
So guess what we do?

53
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.929
If you hate the mini map,
you can turn that off, I don't know.

54
00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:32.848
These are esoteric ones, but
they're there, but whatever it is,

55
00:03:32.848 --> 00:03:37.195
if something's not behaving the way
you like, you can open the settings.

56
00:03:37.195 --> 00:03:41.246
You can search, and
if we open up the default settings,

57
00:03:47.642 --> 00:03:48.962
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's all the default

58
00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:50.946
settings, great, who cares.

59
00:03:50.946 --> 00:03:55.774
More importantly,
descriptions of what the options are.

60
00:03:55.774 --> 00:03:57.733
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How long is that file?

61
00:03:57.733 --> 00:03:59.612
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's go to the bottom.

62
00:03:59.612 --> 00:04:07.005
It is 11,166 lines.

63
00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:10.945
But as you can see, a lot of that is
my VS code pets, all right and so

64
00:04:10.945 --> 00:04:13.256
this will be also all your extension.

65
00:04:13.256 --> 00:04:18.323
But you can kinda, in a lot of cases,
you can always see what the options

66
00:04:18.323 --> 00:04:23.916
are super easily if you go into any of
these obviously if it's got to drop down.

67
00:04:23.916 --> 00:04:26.788
It'll show you what the default is.

68
00:04:26.788 --> 00:04:29.924
And you can see all the options what
they mean, but this is very tedious.

69
00:04:29.924 --> 00:04:34.682
Sometimes if you're just trying to get
a sense of what are all the things I

70
00:04:34.682 --> 00:04:36.792
can do and what do they all mean?

71
00:04:36.792 --> 00:04:41.044
You can open this file and
get a sense of what they all are.

72
00:04:41.044 --> 00:04:45.190
They are the default settings,
it doesn't really matter, but

73
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.024
it's sometimes, if I am trying to
tweak stuff maybe I'm, I don't know,

74
00:04:50.024 --> 00:04:52.663
ridiculous, but this is helpful to me.

75
00:04:52.663 --> 00:04:54.387
You can be like,
I don't ever want to see this again.

76
00:04:54.387 --> 00:05:01.349
And I hear that, that's valid as well.

77
00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:06.861
Cool, so yeah, those are,
the other one that I think is,

78
00:05:06.861 --> 00:05:11.237
let's see if we can do it in here,
that is useful.

79
00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.638
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And I turned this
one off, which is associations,

80
00:05:18.638 --> 00:05:23.384
which is extensions that you want to
be treated as something else, right?

81
00:05:23.384 --> 00:05:28.155
So for instance, if you have a certain
file that's got maybe some weird

82
00:05:28.155 --> 00:05:31.507
extension, but no,
it's kinda just a CSS file.

83
00:05:31.507 --> 00:05:36.615
You can say the key is, let's say I'm

84
00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:41.570
trying to come up with a fictitious.

85
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.745
SCSS, treat it like CSS or, and now,

86
00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:50.801
if somebody opens that type of file,
it'll be that file extension, but

87
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:56.488
it will be treating that file
extension as if it's CSS, markdown.

88
00:05:56.488 --> 00:06:00.586
All right, what have you,
if you just like, yeah, I understand this

89
00:06:00.586 --> 00:06:04.699
is a ridiculous file extension, but
dot d, HTML should just be HTML.

90
00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:07.933
You know what I mean?
You can associate different file

91
00:06:07.933 --> 00:06:12.515
extensions with different languages,
useful for,

92
00:06:12.515 --> 00:06:16.686
even some files that I
didn't start at SCSS, but

93
00:06:16.686 --> 00:06:20.477
a license you could
then treat as markdown.

94
00:06:20.477 --> 00:06:24.668
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Or if you have records
that expand inside another file type.

95
00:06:24.668 --> 00:06:26.524
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, exactly, right?

96
00:06:26.524 --> 00:06:34.103
And so if you need to say hey, just treat
this as whatever, it will do that as well.

97
00:06:34.103 --> 00:06:37.075
Yeah, also to little stuff like that,

98
00:06:37.075 --> 00:06:42.480
if your other setup doesn't do insert
a new line, a trailing new line,

99
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.808
or remove all white space at the end, on
save, right, all of those things as well.

100
00:06:48.808 --> 00:06:53.118
The other one that I
have is some of these,

101
00:06:53.118 --> 00:06:59.290
if they are complicated,
you have to go into the JSON view.

102
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.533
But as you can see,
these editor code actions on save,

103
00:07:03.533 --> 00:07:10.099
which is organize my imports on save, fix
any ESLint errors you can fix by yourself.

104
00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:13.448
Don't make me run ESLint dash dash fix,
I don't want to.

105
00:07:13.448 --> 00:07:17.382
Sort the imports, you can have,
certain of these, refactors or,

106
00:07:17.382 --> 00:07:20.083
whatever automatically
apply when you save.

107
00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:23.108
Right, and
you just kinda tweak them over time.

108
00:07:23.108 --> 00:07:27.908
Some of these were probably set when
I got asked to confirm that I didn't

109
00:07:27.908 --> 00:07:30.236
wanna do this, right [INAUDIBLE].

110
00:07:30.236 --> 00:07:33.906
You can have all that in place as well,
yeah.

111
00:07:33.906 --> 00:07:39.467
I don't ever wanna see the release notes
again for every version of VS code, right?

112
00:07:39.467 --> 00:07:43.811
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And dditional one for
that code actions on save that was

113
00:07:43.811 --> 00:07:47.972
suggested in the chat was
to remove unused imports.

114
00:07:47.972 --> 00:07:50.669
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I think
organized imports does that too.

115
00:07:53.175 --> 00:07:58.061
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: They had both in there,
they had organized imports and remove.

116
00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.101
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I mean, I'm doing that.

117
00:08:01.416 --> 00:08:03.479
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Well,
now, I usually do the-

118
00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:04.292
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Actually,

119
00:08:04.292 --> 00:08:08.120
I should clarify organizeImports
was set to explicit.

120
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.322
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I don't know if-

121
00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.855
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Explicit, I think,

122
00:08:10.855 --> 00:08:14.697
asks if you wanna do it,
I don't ever wanna be asked.

123
00:08:14.697 --> 00:08:16.180
[LAUGH] That's why I got version control.

124
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:20.788
[LAUGH] But the nice part is,
as you can see, you can also,

125
00:08:20.788 --> 00:08:24.916
just like the intellisense
is pretty good in here.

126
00:08:24.916 --> 00:08:29.431
Admittedly, I'm gonna regret some choices
in a week cuz I'm not even paying

127
00:08:29.431 --> 00:08:31.381
attention to what I'm picking.

128
00:08:31.381 --> 00:08:33.679
I'm just like,
that seems cool while I'm talking.

129
00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:39.395
And then a week from now,
I'm going to cause an incident.

130
00:08:39.395 --> 00:08:42.349
Luckily, none of my students watches this,
so they won't know,

131
00:08:42.349 --> 00:08:43.839
they have to hear me talk all day.

132
00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:47.333
They don't wanna tune in for
bonus listening to me talk, cool.

133
00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:53.077
But yeah, lots of settings in there,
and like I said before,

134
00:08:53.077 --> 00:08:57.612
there is,
I think you can do it settings, sync.

135
00:08:57.612 --> 00:09:03.015
I have it set up, but you need to be
logged in with I think github and

136
00:09:03.015 --> 00:09:06.867
you can choose to
synchronize your settings.

137
00:09:06.867 --> 00:09:12.095
So all the dumb things I'm doing
right now on my personal computer,

138
00:09:12.095 --> 00:09:18.714
when I open my work laptop, I will inherit
all those things, for better or for worse.

139
00:09:18.714 --> 00:09:24.729
Let's hope I remember what I did even
the UI state, which is kinda of cool.

140
00:09:24.729 --> 00:09:27.845
I can open up a different laptop and
all my panes and stuff will be open.

141
00:09:27.845 --> 00:09:31.086
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does it version
control these settings, I think?

142
00:09:31.086 --> 00:09:32.402
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: No.

143
00:09:32.402 --> 00:09:33.524
Push to mean.

144
00:09:33.524 --> 00:09:36.036
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I think it's just

145
00:09:36.036 --> 00:09:38.817
conflict resolving a JSON file or
whatever.

146
00:09:38.817 --> 00:09:40.734
And I'm sure the last one wins,

147
00:09:40.734 --> 00:09:44.588
I don't think it's particularly
sophisticated technology.

148
00:09:44.588 --> 00:09:52.412
Yeah, I might come to regret it.

149
00:09:52.412 --> 00:09:56.626
The other thing you can do is
you will know if you need this,

150
00:09:56.626 --> 00:10:00.505
is that you can create these
things called profiles.

151
00:10:00.505 --> 00:10:05.065
And all a profile is, it's like
you have those user settings, but

152
00:10:05.065 --> 00:10:09.311
what if you had different people
at different times, right?

153
00:10:09.311 --> 00:10:14.529
Like I said before the extensions
that I have when I'm working on or

154
00:10:14.529 --> 00:10:20.037
doing pies I don't need running
the rest of the time, right?

155
00:10:20.037 --> 00:10:25.522
There's a whole bunch of micro Python ID,
serial port, I don't need that.

156
00:10:25.522 --> 00:10:28.442
There's some BS ones I
made just rehearsing where

157
00:10:28.442 --> 00:10:31.569
you can basically have
different sets of snippets for

158
00:10:31.569 --> 00:10:35.130
different use cases,
different settings, so on so forth.

159
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.842
It's basically different user profiles.

160
00:10:37.842 --> 00:10:40.265
You can create one, I would say, yeah,

161
00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:43.474
if you don't want a bunch
of extensions running, but

162
00:10:43.474 --> 00:10:48.346
you wanna be able to turn them on or
slightly different settings, it's useful.

163
00:10:48.346 --> 00:10:53.106
I would say for the average person,
probably not super useful.

164
00:10:53.106 --> 00:10:56.190
But there, if you need it, and
that's part of my job right now,

165
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:59.733
is to say this thing exists for
the 5% of you that desperate will be like,

166
00:10:59.733 --> 00:11:02.160
yes, and the other 95 will be like,
moving on.
