00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Other things about task,
what else do I have to say?

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.150
The problem matcher,
have I written one these myself?

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.982
Yes, do I ever want to do it again?

4
00:00:09.982 --> 00:00:15.055
No, which is to take all
the lines of stuff that come out,

5
00:00:15.055 --> 00:00:18.753
parse it to see if you
need to deal with it,

6
00:00:18.753 --> 00:00:22.908
hope that you never have to write one,
right?

7
00:00:22.908 --> 00:00:27.532
But again you just have the different
groups, this is like, what file is it in,

8
00:00:27.532 --> 00:00:30.512
what line, what column,
severity and a message?

9
00:00:30.512 --> 00:00:35.041
And then anything that matches that Regex
will show up in the Problems tab and

10
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:36.182
you can jump to it.

11
00:00:36.182 --> 00:00:40.711
Again, most common,
unless you have a bespoke test runner or

12
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:43.161
some other bespoke build thing?

13
00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:48.326
You can grab one off the shelf,
don't do this, and then finally the nice

14
00:00:48.326 --> 00:00:54.170
part is you can reuse the same terminal,
have a dedicated terminal for that task,

15
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.270
you can have it run silently in
the background, there's a lot of like.

16
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.842
Steps, so, like, so the some of the
questions, like, why wouldn't I run this?

17
00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:04.971
Like, you could literally just say,
start the development server,

18
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:07.738
run in a background tab,
I don't even want to see it, right?

19
00:01:07.738 --> 00:01:11.216
And you can have the problem matcher
there, if there's problems Chauvin,

20
00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:13.982
I'll jump to that place in the code,
you can, like, when we

21
00:01:13.982 --> 00:01:17.656
get to debugging in a second, like,
some of that you will get for free, right?

22
00:01:17.656 --> 00:01:22.501
That said, I, also,
if you look in the terminal,

23
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:26.559
anything that is a file path, like colon,

24
00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:30.167
like Like row number, colon number,

25
00:01:30.167 --> 00:01:35.948
you can also command click and
jump right to as well, right?

26
00:01:35.948 --> 00:01:42.046
So like yes to all of those,
what else do we need to say about this?

27
00:01:42.046 --> 00:01:47.294
We talked about compound tasks and
sequence, you can run them in parallel,

28
00:01:47.294 --> 00:01:52.132
you can not care if they're not
like if they're totally unimpotent.

29
00:01:52.132 --> 00:01:59.184
Again, if you need to like wipe
out the local SQLite database and

30
00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:04.279
run another one,
like various things that you

31
00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:09.258
can do as well,
what else to say about tasks?

32
00:02:09.258 --> 00:02:13.796
Like we can play with some of these,
but, like,

33
00:02:13.796 --> 00:02:19.665
I'll kind of leave this as
an exercise because I think watching

34
00:02:19.665 --> 00:02:26.109
me run shell commands is,
beyond what's sure, very cute to watch.

35
00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.512
Also but it's the same concept over and
over and over again, and

36
00:02:29.512 --> 00:02:33.864
you're better off spending time playing
with your actual code base to see if there

37
00:02:33.864 --> 00:02:35.774
are some productivity gains here.

38
00:02:35.774 --> 00:02:40.264
But again, if you're using
a TypeScript compiler or Es Lynch or

39
00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:43.852
whatever, there are some
niceties there as well.
