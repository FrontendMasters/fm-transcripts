1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.914
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Anyone in this room
have favorite extensions they want to

2
00:00:02.914 --> 00:00:03.585
talk about?

3
00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:05.647
&gt;&gt; Justin: It's one by John Papa Earth.

4
00:00:05.647 --> 00:00:07.433
I think it's called Angular files.

5
00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:11.612
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: What
does Angular files do?

6
00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:16.134
&gt;&gt; Justin: Okay, so it allows me to right
click and create component real easy and

7
00:00:16.134 --> 00:00:19.513
not have to type in GC component or
whatever.

8
00:00:19.513 --> 00:00:22.586
Yeah, it saves me a ton of time.

9
00:00:22.586 --> 00:00:26.337
That's the guy in some Eastern Block.

10
00:00:26.337 --> 00:00:27.270
Kind of neat.

11
00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:32.643
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,
any other favorites?

12
00:00:32.643 --> 00:00:37.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I'm looking at my list, and
they are it's obvious that I came across

13
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.927
a file type of something
I wasn't familiar with.

14
00:00:40.927 --> 00:00:44.040
And then I downloaded an extension for
it, yet syntax highlighting or

15
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.842
something in it.

16
00:00:44.842 --> 00:00:46.872
And there's half of them are that

17
00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:47.988
an obscure
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.

18
00:00:47.988 --> 00:00:51.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Anytime you come across
something and it's download the download

19
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.172
the syntax highlighting for it,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yep,

20
00:00:54.172 --> 00:00:56.670
that's how you end up with a lot of these.

21
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.078
Remove someone up with a zig
plug in at some point/.

22
00:01:01.078 --> 00:01:07.360
And the other thing you can
do as well is if you have,

23
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.328
a .versus code folder, you can put in,

24
00:01:12.328 --> 00:01:16.585
extensions.json.extension.

25
00:01:16.585 --> 00:01:21.251
And, put in a list of,
recommended or unwanted Extension so

26
00:01:21.251 --> 00:01:28.305
that if somebody opened this project,
they're, no, I don't want the C++ tools.

27
00:01:28.305 --> 00:01:32.185
For instance, if it was a svelte project,
I might just put the identifier.

28
00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:37.885
And you can get the identifier for
any of these by going in and

29
00:01:37.885 --> 00:01:43.136
just grabbing copy extension ID and
you pop it in here.

30
00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:46.118
And now if somebody opens this project,
they're,

31
00:01:46.118 --> 00:01:48.639
would you to install the svelte extension?

32
00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:49.886
So you can actually add that.

33
00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:52.715
So for your team,
if there are known extent maybe you

34
00:01:52.715 --> 00:01:57.169
want the prettier extension or maybe there
is internal stuff that you're using.

35
00:01:57.169 --> 00:02:01.824
You could directly have somebody who
opens it, get it that recommended.

36
00:02:01.824 --> 00:02:02.684
Yeah,
&gt;&gt; Justin: another

37
00:02:02.684 --> 00:02:07.681
one I is material icon theme just because
it makes the icons look really nice.

38
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:12.436
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This is a super popular
28 million, a very super popular one.

39
00:02:12.436 --> 00:02:18.151
Let's install it real fast and
so everyone can see and

40
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:25.147
so on top of themes now I have
a different set of icons here as well.

41
00:02:25.147 --> 00:02:30.282
And with that, themes are also extensions.

42
00:02:30.282 --> 00:02:33.300
So I use Night Owl,
which was made by Sarah Dresner,

43
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.400
who does a bunch of front
end message courses as well.

44
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.518
And so you can install additional themes,
trying to think, yeah,

45
00:02:40.518 --> 00:02:44.780
there's stuff for again,
language before we talked about earlier,

46
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.424
which is this just adds on top of CSS,
all the post CSS kind of syntax as well.

47
00:02:49.424 --> 00:02:50.109
Yeah.

48
00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:55.899
&gt;&gt; Justin: Is that going back to
the extensions, .JSON earlier?

49
00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.317
Is that specific to a project?

50
00:02:58.317 --> 00:02:59.639
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This one is in a project.

51
00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.894
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Justin: Okay, it sounds good, yeah.

52
00:03:01.894 --> 00:03:04.026
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And so you would
check this into version control and

53
00:03:04.026 --> 00:03:05.969
somebody also opened
this project in VS Code.

54
00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.072
It'd be here are the extensions that we

55
00:03:09.072 --> 00:03:11.577
use
&gt;&gt; Justin: one extension I really is path

56
00:03:11.577 --> 00:03:12.825
intellisence.

57
00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:16.213
So if you're importing
something into a file,

58
00:03:16.213 --> 00:03:19.685
you can start typing and
it will walk through your

59
00:03:19.685 --> 00:03:24.610
file system as you're trying to find
where that file is really nice.

60
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.691
I think I use that all the time.

61
00:03:26.691 --> 00:03:30.544
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, and some of that is
built in, but this is a lot better, right?

62
00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:31.146
&gt;&gt; Justin: Is it, okay.

63
00:03:31.146 --> 00:03:35.570
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, if you're just
doing JavaScript or TypeScript files, but

64
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.925
if you wanted to also, cuz a lot
of times Vite and Webpack and Bun.

65
00:03:39.925 --> 00:03:43.205
Will let you install an HTML file and
the normal,

66
00:03:43.205 --> 00:03:48.334
it's not called path whatever the
intellisense that does pass NVS code is.

67
00:03:48.334 --> 00:03:52.675
Can't handle the idea that you would
ever fathom importing HTML file into

68
00:03:52.675 --> 00:03:53.874
a Javascript file.

69
00:03:53.874 --> 00:03:57.327
Which is a totally legit thing
to do in bun and vit and

70
00:03:57.327 --> 00:04:01.355
maybe webpack,
which I haven't used in forever, right?

71
00:04:01.355 --> 00:04:05.915
And so this one is a little bit better
where it will also all files are fair

72
00:04:05.915 --> 00:04:06.907
game, right?

73
00:04:06.907 --> 00:04:11.358
You just need to turn off the settings for
the built in one as well.

74
00:04:11.358 --> 00:04:14.242
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Not really
an extension suggestion.

75
00:04:14.242 --> 00:04:20.352
But do we need to worry about extension
bloating and slowing down the VS code,

76
00:04:20.352 --> 00:04:23.582
if you download all these,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yes

77
00:04:23.582 --> 00:04:24.706
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I had a code,

78
00:04:24.706 --> 00:04:29.510
a spell checker installed on my machine,
and it would,

79
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.928
it was on a code base that was so
large that the code spell checker

80
00:04:34.928 --> 00:04:40.163
was always running and
if I left the IDE open overnight and I.

81
00:04:40.163 --> 00:04:45.226
I turned my computer on the next morning,
it would that instance of Chrome

82
00:04:45.226 --> 00:04:50.628
would have crashed, and because it was
just so big and so, I had to turn it off.

83
00:04:50.628 --> 00:04:52.512
It was too it was not no good.

84
00:04:52.512 --> 00:04:54.759
Smaller projects is fine, but not really.

85
00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.173
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, a bad extent if you
really went over the top with extensions

86
00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:01.231
you probably made,
because everyone has a cost, right?

87
00:05:01.231 --> 00:05:05.757
It's got to run some amount of JavaScript,
right, and load some amount of stuff and

88
00:05:05.757 --> 00:05:08.262
then one bad extension
can also take you down.

89
00:05:08.262 --> 00:05:11.565
Because, yeah,
if it's running in an infinite loop, and

90
00:05:11.565 --> 00:05:15.345
lighting your battery on fire,
that's not great either, right?

91
00:05:15.345 --> 00:05:22.312
And there are ways to audit, but
barring yeah, one pathological case.

92
00:05:22.312 --> 00:05:27.073
I've never gotten to the point I also
there's, I guess I'm running in 34 now,

93
00:05:27.073 --> 00:05:30.536
some of them I just installed
while we were playing around.

94
00:05:30.536 --> 00:05:38.007
But generally speaking, have never felt
the pain on my very expensive MacBook.

95
00:05:38.007 --> 00:05:39.290
So whatever.

96
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:46.419
So to say there is no pain to be felt but
I have not personally felt that pain,

97
00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.415
or I feel it all the time,
and I'm just dead inside.

98
00:05:51.415 --> 00:05:55.786
One of the two is true,
another one speaking of costs and

99
00:05:55.786 --> 00:06:01.832
being dead inside I don't know,
don't care that much about this one, but.

100
00:06:01.832 --> 00:06:05.539
This one is for
every file that you import will show

101
00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:09.787
you the kilobytes you're
adding to the bundle, right?

102
00:06:09.787 --> 00:06:14.527
It's the only tricky part is,
it's also doing that for me a node and

103
00:06:14.527 --> 00:06:16.200
a bunch of other stuff.

104
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.034
And I'm I don't need it right now,
I don't know.

105
00:06:19.034 --> 00:06:21.286
I will,
I think that obviously something quite.

106
00:06:21.286 --> 00:06:24.531
Incredibly important,
but while I'm importing,

107
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:27.118
I think it's not the time I care about it.

108
00:06:27.118 --> 00:06:29.689
So yeah,
any other ones from the chat, Dustin?

109
00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:30.359
What have we got?

110
00:06:30.359 --> 00:06:33.434
&gt;&gt; Justin: Yeah, we've got a few
pretty typed script errors.

111
00:06:33.434 --> 00:06:36.839
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah,
I got that one in here somewhere.

112
00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:43.335
&gt;&gt; Justin: There's Python folks,
the autodocstring.

113
00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:46.426
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Justin: A recommended extension.

114
00:06:46.426 --> 00:06:48.245
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.

115
00:06:48.245 --> 00:06:51.189
&gt;&gt; Justin: Git graph is
great if you're looking for

116
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:54.659
a more visual representation
of git branches.

117
00:06:56.672 --> 00:07:00.628
&gt;&gt; Justin: There is a recommended quokka.

118
00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:01.449
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.

119
00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:06.546
&gt;&gt; Justin: It's a kind of a JavaScript
productivity extension, I believe.

120
00:07:06.546 --> 00:07:08.706
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I have installed
that one and then I don't use it, but

121
00:07:08.706 --> 00:07:09.379
it seems great.

122
00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:12.778
So this one will kinda, let you see,

123
00:07:12.778 --> 00:07:18.818
the return values of various functions,
in line, as comments.

124
00:07:18.818 --> 00:07:24.952
And so yeah obviously throws an error.

125
00:07:24.952 --> 00:07:29.957
But, as you can see it'll show you,
you can put a comment in there and

126
00:07:29.957 --> 00:07:33.773
it'll show you that line
what it would evaluate to.

127
00:07:33.773 --> 00:07:38.542
So basically, where you would otherwise
put console logs all over the place,

128
00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:40.212
we'll look at debugging.

129
00:07:40.212 --> 00:07:42.139
But let's be clear,
I know what you all do.

130
00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:48.080
You can theoretically just see
the values in here as well.

131
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.268
This is by a company called Wallaby.js,

132
00:07:53.268 --> 00:07:58.465
which has a very similar thing for tests.

133
00:07:58.465 --> 00:08:02.220
So you can see it looks
very similar in this case,

134
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.811
but you can get visual feedback
on your tests in the editor.

135
00:08:06.811 --> 00:08:10.743
If I am not mistaken, this is not
necessarily a free service, but

136
00:08:10.743 --> 00:08:11.968
it's pretty good.

137
00:08:11.968 --> 00:08:17.937
Also, there is some amount of testing
infrastructure built into VS Code.

138
00:08:17.937 --> 00:08:23.277
There is a Jest plugin that will show
you check marks or failing tests.

139
00:08:23.277 --> 00:08:25.200
It's not always running them recursively.

140
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.605
It's when you run it,
it will parse the output.

141
00:08:28.605 --> 00:08:34.350
And then if your test fails and
it says this test in this file, line 10,

142
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:40.580
column whatever, VS Code can figure out
where to put an unhappy mark in there.

143
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.501
We'll actually see how that
works in a little bit.

144
00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:46.806
We won't do too much with it, but we'll
at least acknowledge where that happens.

145
00:08:46.806 --> 00:08:51.384
So again, if you use jest,
then obviously the jest plugin is great.

146
00:08:51.384 --> 00:08:58.281
If you use V test, then obviously that
one is great.So on and so forth, right?

147
00:08:58.281 --> 00:09:01.927
Any other ones in the chat, Justin
&gt;&gt; Justin: ( A live server?

148
00:09:01.927 --> 00:09:04.305
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: A live serve,
you love that server.

149
00:09:04.305 --> 00:09:08.699
&gt;&gt; Justin: There's
a recommendation about you're

150
00:09:08.699 --> 00:09:13.474
trying to avoid kind of
the extension bloat.

151
00:09:13.474 --> 00:09:18.360
You install an extension,
you disable it, and then only enable it

152
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.996
in your workspace to make it not
in every project that you open.

153
00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:24.058
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That's a great segue.

154
00:09:24.058 --> 00:09:26.225
So we'll talk about that,
&gt;&gt; Justin: And

155
00:09:26.225 --> 00:09:30.673
then the one other maybe we'll
conclude with VS code pets.

156
00:09:30.673 --> 00:09:33.569
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Excuse me, [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Justin: Yes VS code pets.

157
00:09:33.569 --> 00:09:36.947
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This is why I show
&gt;&gt; Justin: Multiple recommendations for

158
00:09:36.947 --> 00:09:37.950
VS code pets.

159
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.941
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This is why I.

160
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:44.208
My God, this was worth getting on a plane.

161
00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:45.888
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Justin: My God, I want it.

162
00:09:45.888 --> 00:09:49.403
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, this is-

163
00:09:49.403 --> 00:09:51.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: This we trust,

164
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.798
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I trust whoever

165
00:09:52.798 --> 00:09:55.276
made this, 100%.

166
00:09:55.276 --> 00:09:57.687
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What does it mean?

167
00:09:57.687 --> 00:09:59.675
&gt;&gt; Justin: 1.6 million installs, so.

168
00:09:59.675 --> 00:10:01.064
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And worth it.

169
00:10:01.064 --> 00:10:02.087
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: That's too good.

170
00:10:02.087 --> 00:10:04.625
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Look, it's this.

171
00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:05.321
It's still cute.

172
00:10:05.321 --> 00:10:07.290
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That was my pet,
but how do I make it snow?

173
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.654
We're gonna cancel
the rest of the workshop.

174
00:10:09.654 --> 00:10:11.169
I'm gonna be very busy now.

175
00:10:11.169 --> 00:10:16.786
This is more impressive
than what I have going on.

176
00:10:16.786 --> 00:10:19.126
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The tagline says that
this brings your productivity.

177
00:10:19.126 --> 00:10:20.468
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.

178
00:10:20.468 --> 00:10:21.740
I can put a frog in there?

179
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.958
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Look at the cat.

180
00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.060
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: A red frog?

181
00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.345
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: On the bottom of the screen.

182
00:10:26.345 --> 00:10:29.878
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Kermit,
now there's a red frog in there.

183
00:10:29.878 --> 00:10:31.540
They like each other.

184
00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.304
Okay, I'm cancel my plans.

185
00:10:33.304 --> 00:10:38.120
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Well, that was worth it.

186
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.965
On the installed ones, you will see right?

187
00:10:40.965 --> 00:10:44.068
That you can disable it
without uninstalling it.

188
00:10:44.068 --> 00:10:48.721
You can also either
a disable it normally and

189
00:10:48.721 --> 00:10:53.009
then enable it for a workspace, right?

190
00:10:53.009 --> 00:10:58.839
Or to say if it's such override it
in one way or the other, right?

191
00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:01.211
So if we hit disable for the workspace.

192
00:11:01.211 --> 00:11:05.259
It will for this one be disabled and

193
00:11:05.259 --> 00:11:09.173
then I could choose to enable it.

194
00:11:09.173 --> 00:11:12.073
We'll also look at something called
profiles in a little bit, right?

195
00:11:12.073 --> 00:11:17.052
So for instance,
I do a lot of Raspberry Pi-ish stuff

196
00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:20.826
when there's micropython and cereal.

197
00:11:20.826 --> 00:11:24.008
Port and, I don't know these things
running most of the time, right?

198
00:11:24.008 --> 00:11:26.888
So you can have different profiles
where you adopt different versions

199
00:11:26.888 --> 00:11:28.025
of yourself and personas.

200
00:11:28.025 --> 00:11:32.088
We'll take a look at that in a second
when we get to settings, and

201
00:11:32.088 --> 00:11:35.265
you can turn them on and
off for a given workspace.

202
00:11:35.265 --> 00:11:39.415
You can have sets maybeif you
live in the consulting world,

203
00:11:39.415 --> 00:11:44.644
you can Have different environments for
the different things that you do.

204
00:11:44.644 --> 00:11:46.953
And then there are also ways
to do this with containers.

205
00:11:46.953 --> 00:11:49.380
We'll get into all of
that in a hot minute.

206
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.640
But yeah, and then some of these kind
of come for free and are built in.

207
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.465
And we said before,
some of these should you open a TAML file,

208
00:11:57.465 --> 00:12:00.201
which is just YAML or JSON, but different.

209
00:12:00.201 --> 00:12:04.587
A lot of times it will recommend whatever

210
00:12:04.587 --> 00:12:09.619
the default plugin for
that might be, right?

211
00:12:09.619 --> 00:12:13.660
Particularly if it's made by Microsoft,
and you open up a python file,

212
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.585
it'll be like, would you the one
that we didn't include by default?

213
00:12:17.585 --> 00:12:20.685
Absolutely, yeah.

214
00:12:20.685 --> 00:12:21.420
There are lots of extent.

215
00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:26.389
Extensions again, there
are recommended ones.I am guilty a lot

216
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:29.459
of times though, of installing them and

217
00:12:29.459 --> 00:12:34.083
not remembering what they do,
and then they just sit there.

218
00:12:34.083 --> 00:12:36.974
So your mileage may vary.

219
00:12:36.974 --> 00:12:38.585
Toggle quotes for the win.
