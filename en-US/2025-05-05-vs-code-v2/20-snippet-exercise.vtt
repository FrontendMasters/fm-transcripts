00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.897
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
so exercise time for you.

2
00:00:02.897 --> 00:00:05.340
Do you have to do all of these?

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.580
No, because we don't have enough time for
that.

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.640
But these are mostly to also
serve as inspiration, right?

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.806
So if you do a lot of express, you have
like, we always use this middleware, and

6
00:00:15.806 --> 00:00:17.762
we always do this other stuff, right?

7
00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:19.748
You can just make a snippet out of that.

8
00:00:19.748 --> 00:00:24.403
Take a look at this and just grab one or

9
00:00:24.403 --> 00:00:30.722
two that seem interesting,
and just give a shot.

10
00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:36.002
Just again, to get the muscle memory
in there and whatever, try it out.

11
00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:40.635
I'll show you a trick that I do with
the imports as maybe the one that I

12
00:00:40.635 --> 00:00:42.597
choose to do at the end here.

13
00:00:42.597 --> 00:00:45.413
But yeah, try a few of them out.

14
00:00:45.413 --> 00:00:47.648
Whether or not you're successful,
I'm not super worried about it.

15
00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:50.754
But again, get a sense of
the basic ergonomics, try it out.

16
00:00:57.341 --> 00:00:59.420
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
like I said there, I forget how many.

17
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.060
There are 17 different exercises,
we're not doing all 17.

18
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.111
That said, there's a cheat sheet,
for whichever ones you chose.

19
00:01:06.111 --> 00:01:09.325
Let's grab, one or

20
00:01:09.325 --> 00:01:16.133
two interesting ones, I think there one or

21
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:20.683
two that I kinda like to use.

22
00:01:20.683 --> 00:01:27.174
I'm gonna do something real fast,
ther's much of sub project in here.

23
00:01:27.174 --> 00:01:33.924
So I'm gonna go into this task
one which I think has React and

24
00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:38.655
stuff like that in it and
open that one up.

25
00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:43.712
That way I can demonstrate
what I would like

26
00:01:43.712 --> 00:01:48.490
to accomplish here and so I'm gonna do,

27
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:56.093
I think two of them that show
maybe practictical use cases here.

28
00:01:56.093 --> 00:01:59.312
So again,
we'll just go to configure snippets.

29
00:01:59.312 --> 00:02:03.328
Yes, sure, we'll go into this global one.

30
00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:08.014
So let's do one that I
like to do a lot for

31
00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:11.991
imports, and so in my code base,

32
00:02:11.991 --> 00:02:16.691
we don't really export default ever.

33
00:02:16.691 --> 00:02:18.502
No particular reason why.

34
00:02:18.502 --> 00:02:23.072
I don't know, I'd made a decision
early days, and now we do it.

35
00:02:23.072 --> 00:02:29.097
So let's say, let's do import dependency,
I don't know.

36
00:02:29.097 --> 00:02:36.200
Again, just something where it's not gonna
try to auto complete as something else.

37
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.800
You might have if it doesn't work for
you, that's you know,

38
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.260
you figure something as it works.

39
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.969
What I to do is I'll do import.

40
00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:51.339
I'll have, the braces, and
I will do the other side first.

41
00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:56.590
The what you know, either library or
file I wanna import from,

42
00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.260
and then, afterwards,
jump over over into the brace.

43
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.836
You're like, why hold on?

44
00:03:05.836 --> 00:03:09.880
Import stuff.

45
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.603
Why is I'll show you.

46
00:03:15.603 --> 00:03:21.400
And so you can do something like,

47
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.403
and now if you type in react first,

48
00:03:27.403 --> 00:03:33.418
I don't know, too much talking.

49
00:03:33.418 --> 00:03:37.484
Now it'll, in a sense,
will know what library and

50
00:03:37.484 --> 00:03:40.613
autocomplete the other part, right?

51
00:03:40.613 --> 00:03:44.069
And so it's just a lot nicer than,
because, a lot of times if you're typing

52
00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.488
from left to right, you get to the part
where you would type and use effect.

53
00:03:47.488 --> 00:03:50.733
You get no Intellisense help, and
then you type in the, react part.

54
00:03:50.733 --> 00:03:57.336
This one, you jump to the end, and then
you can tab to the middle, I like a lot.

55
00:03:57.336 --> 00:04:03.195
The other one I think the last
one on the list that I'm gonna

56
00:04:03.195 --> 00:04:08.592
kind of just change up a tiny
bit is that TryCatch one.

57
00:04:08.592 --> 00:04:13.186
Because there's usually
a little bit more that I want

58
00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:16.769
to do than just a TryCatch block, right?

59
00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.075
Sure, we'll start with that.

60
00:04:20.075 --> 00:04:25.316
But what I will, generally speaking

61
00:04:25.316 --> 00:04:30.556
do in this case is do something like,

62
00:04:30.556 --> 00:04:38.347
only console error if we're
in development, right?

63
00:04:38.347 --> 00:04:41.964
Otherwise, don't console error
if we're in production, right?

64
00:04:41.964 --> 00:04:43.839
And then sometimes I will do.

65
00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:51.034
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Even with this error,
I might do.

66
00:04:59.902 --> 00:05:03.072
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If error, instance of
error that way, actually, if I'm in

67
00:05:03.072 --> 00:05:07.315
TypeScript that way, it knows, because,
for some reason, error is unknown.

68
00:05:07.315 --> 00:05:09.118
And so you try to do error, dot message,

69
00:05:09.118 --> 00:05:11.195
TypeScript gets very angry with you,
right?

70
00:05:11.195 --> 00:05:15.705
So I might do something like,
I could even combine them.

71
00:05:15.705 --> 00:05:24.036
So, cool, if we are in development and

72
00:05:24.036 --> 00:05:30.604
then get me the error message.

73
00:05:36.761 --> 00:05:37.847
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Why are you angry?

74
00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:49.612
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And then, after that,
I'll probably at that point, either

75
00:05:49.612 --> 00:05:55.380
rethrow the error or choose then that's
where I'll put the dollar sign zero.

76
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.940
So now I can have a TryCatch
block where I can have the code,

77
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.517
which maybe I'll even default
to selected text, right?

78
00:06:15.465 --> 00:06:20.586
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And I'll get all
this extra ceremony for free, right?

79
00:06:20.586 --> 00:06:23.014
I don't want that there, yeah.

80
00:06:23.014 --> 00:06:25.107
So now I can do something like

81
00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:39.515
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Does anyone
remember what I called the snippets?

82
00:06:39.515 --> 00:06:41.867
Just try that what I called it.

83
00:06:47.535 --> 00:06:48.440
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's go, hold on.

84
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.124
What do I call it?

85
00:06:49.124 --> 00:06:50.554
Let's call it try.

86
00:06:50.554 --> 00:06:57.633
Maybe I should call it cry,
that's what I should call it.

87
00:07:00.174 --> 00:07:01.937
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, so
now it wraps it in there.

88
00:07:01.937 --> 00:07:04.896
That's got to be process.env.nodem, right?

89
00:07:04.896 --> 00:07:09.309
But now I can get all that extra
ceremony that I would have done for

90
00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:13.330
free, and I don't ever have
to type that all out again..

91
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.754
And so it's nice to take like
the conventions in your code base and

92
00:07:16.754 --> 00:07:18.508
just make it super easy, right?

93
00:07:18.508 --> 00:07:21.005
Cause again, every moment you're
typing that out by hand and

94
00:07:21.005 --> 00:07:23.935
even like that little Boo Boo that I
made with forgetting that EMV that's

95
00:07:23.935 --> 00:07:25.299
time it slows you down this time.

96
00:07:25.299 --> 00:07:28.772
That's distracting you from whatever it is
you were actually supposed to be doing and

97
00:07:28.772 --> 00:07:30.714
the problem you were
actually trying to solve.

98
00:07:30.714 --> 00:07:33.862
So just finding, the and
part of this is again,

99
00:07:33.862 --> 00:07:37.978
figuring out the patterns that
you need in your application.

100
00:07:37.978 --> 00:07:41.975
And a lot of this just like building the
habit, as I said in the very beginning of

101
00:07:41.975 --> 00:07:45.625
this workshop of catching yourself
in the repeated things that you do.

102
00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:48.597
And so this will only log there and
catching those things and

103
00:07:48.597 --> 00:07:49.851
then doing it like that.

104
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:52.048
Somebody asked during the break,

105
00:07:52.048 --> 00:07:56.070
are there extensions that have
a bunch of pre-made snippets.

106
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.904
There are i don't use them because
i'm very particular and again,

107
00:07:59.904 --> 00:08:04.086
want my stuff the way that I want it,
and I would rather build them myself.

108
00:08:04.086 --> 00:08:08.134
But there are a whole bunch of these.

109
00:08:08.134 --> 00:08:10.856
Just go search in the extension store for

110
00:08:10.856 --> 00:08:14.790
various different options that
you can play around with.

111
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:19.637
The other thing that I don't
do in the tour of things

112
00:08:19.637 --> 00:08:23.694
that I don't do that I
will tell you about,

113
00:08:23.694 --> 00:08:28.341
is you can also assign
snippets to a key binding.

114
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:32.215
I personally, one I like the fact
I could start typing one, and

115
00:08:32.215 --> 00:08:34.929
IntelliSense will tell me the snippet two.

116
00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:40.062
I get very anxious that I'm going
to run out of keyboard shortcuts.

117
00:08:40.062 --> 00:08:43.698
And then I can barely remember to
type my snippets half the time.

118
00:08:43.698 --> 00:08:49.462
I don't also need some esoteric keystroke,
I will never remember that it exists.

119
00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:55.697
But if you are a person who says, I would
like this, well then you can have it.

120
00:08:55.697 --> 00:08:58.107
This is how you do it,
I put it on a web page for you.

121
00:08:58.107 --> 00:09:01.020
You take everything we learned
about key bindings and

122
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.721
everything then we learned,
this is the command you're calling.

123
00:09:04.721 --> 00:09:10.681
The arguments are gonna be the language
ID and the name of the snippet, right?

124
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:12.450
And then you're good to go.

125
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.627
Your mileage may vary.

126
00:09:15.627 --> 00:09:20.463
If I had more keys on my keyboard,
maybe I would do it.

127
00:09:20.463 --> 00:09:25.889
But cool, and that concludes snippets.

128
00:09:25.889 --> 00:09:29.496
I said, there are more little things
you can kind of wander around,

129
00:09:29.496 --> 00:09:31.285
but we got to most of the big ones.

130
00:09:31.285 --> 00:09:35.693
And then like I said, there are solutions
for all of the exercises, but

131
00:09:35.693 --> 00:09:39.756
watching me do that 17 times seems
not fun for anyone involved.

132
00:09:39.756 --> 00:09:43.378
But especially because the ones you make
will be the ones that you need for you.
