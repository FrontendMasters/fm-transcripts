00:00:00.078 --> 00:00:02.651
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's go check it out,
which is setting one up.

2
00:00:02.651 --> 00:00:08.209
And I get I went into one of these smaller
projects inside the major like, repo.

3
00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:10.241
In this case, I'm gonna get rid of,

4
00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:12.929
like, some of this extra
stuff I did just because

5
00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.212
I don't know how they all play together,
they all work together in reality.

6
00:00:17.212 --> 00:00:21.833
But when you are live coding and
talking and not really paying attention

7
00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:26.697
to what you're doing, don't need to
add that attribute into the system.

8
00:00:26.697 --> 00:00:29.962
So what setting one up is, you guessed it,

9
00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:35.427
open up the command palette, and
you can guess the next few things too.

10
00:00:35.427 --> 00:00:37.858
A JSON file is gonna get created.

11
00:00:37.858 --> 00:00:40.134
I don't think there's any
regex in this one, in case.

12
00:00:40.134 --> 00:00:42.635
That makes a little bit happier.

13
00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:46.162
But I think the act of like,
we could do the whole, like,

14
00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:49.040
large philosophical conceptual framework.

15
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.069
But this one, I actually think
the act of doing it is very

16
00:00:54.069 --> 00:01:00.065
illustrative to what it is like to
set up a dev container in VS code.

17
00:01:00.065 --> 00:01:04.457
So what do you do, you just I don't know,
you type in dev container.

18
00:01:04.457 --> 00:01:09.428
So cool, in this case, rebuild and
reopening container is not gonna work for

19
00:01:09.428 --> 00:01:13.644
us because we have not added dev
container configuration files.

20
00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:16.343
So we are gonna do that.

21
00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:21.134
You can also attach already running
containers if you have one running.

22
00:01:21.134 --> 00:01:25.680
If you really love DevOps more than I do,

23
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.437
you can do all sorts of fun stuff.

24
00:01:29.437 --> 00:01:31.868
You can clone a GitHub
pull request into one.

25
00:01:31.868 --> 00:01:35.045
Lots of fun stuff.

26
00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:41.851
Let's do with the thing that I planned
on doing instead of me just exploring.

27
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:45.467
So, add Dev configuration files,
all right.

28
00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:50.346
So, is this going to be one that
you use just in this project,

29
00:01:50.346 --> 00:01:55.322
or is this gonna be one that you
kind of just have on your machine

30
00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:58.885
that you share amongst multiple projects?

31
00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:00.707
What is the answer to this question?

32
00:02:00.707 --> 00:02:03.045
The answer to this question is,

33
00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:07.818
do you plan on checking that
configuration into source control?

34
00:02:07.818 --> 00:02:11.310
Yeah, it's like, I just want my own little
postgres in this little container that I

35
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.307
use for lots of things.

36
00:02:12.307 --> 00:02:18.275
Sure, almost always you want it in source
control unless you know that you don't.

37
00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:20.478
So we pick that option.

38
00:02:20.478 --> 00:02:21.252
Give it one second.

39
00:02:21.252 --> 00:02:29.212
Okay, so like what kind of
container do you want, right?

40
00:02:29.212 --> 00:02:31.370
For me, it's this one.

41
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.803
But depending on what you
are looking to do, you could choose,

42
00:02:35.803 --> 00:02:40.585
you want to run Alpine Linux or
Kubernetes or have one that has node.

43
00:02:40.585 --> 00:02:44.060
Postgres kinda built together
already in there, right?

44
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.968
You'll roughly know what
it is that you want.

45
00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:53.296
For our purposes,
let's just pick the easy one.

46
00:02:53.296 --> 00:02:56.009
Okay, then you're like, what is this?

47
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.432
This is what version of Node do you want,
right?

48
00:02:58.432 --> 00:03:06.752
Ignore the words that come after that.

49
00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:08.090
Choose the default one.

50
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.830
Okay, what other software would
you like to have involved?

51
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.319
Do you need the GitHub CLI?

52
00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.390
All right, sure, the one password CLI, no.

53
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.274
So you can kind of take a look.

54
00:03:21.274 --> 00:03:25.517
This is act is for
running GitHub actions, which is,

55
00:03:25.517 --> 00:03:31.286
if you need to test that stuff out,
as you can see, I'm only on the A's.

56
00:03:31.286 --> 00:03:33.106
I'm not going through all of these.

57
00:03:33.106 --> 00:03:39.476
But various different tools,
command line tools.

58
00:03:39.476 --> 00:03:41.858
I think yeah, the Angular CLI,
the Android SDK,

59
00:03:41.858 --> 00:03:45.605
whatever you need in here, if you're
doing some amount of machine learning or

60
00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:48.138
whatever you want to have Anaconda,
I don't care.

61
00:03:48.138 --> 00:03:50.016
Pick whatever you know you need.

62
00:03:50.016 --> 00:03:54.674
Turns out it's gonna be a JSON file
in the end so you can edit it later.

63
00:03:54.674 --> 00:03:57.075
It's not a big deal.

64
00:03:57.075 --> 00:03:58.815
Just see if there's anything
like fun that I want to add.

65
00:03:58.815 --> 00:04:00.264
Yeah, the AWS CLI.

66
00:04:00.264 --> 00:04:08.655
Whatever kind of stuff that you think
that you need, you can add it as well.

67
00:04:08.655 --> 00:04:09.863
Yeah, I'm only on the A's.

68
00:04:09.863 --> 00:04:11.441
I'm not doing this.

69
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:12.257
So we hit two.

70
00:04:12.257 --> 00:04:14.583
We hit selected.

71
00:04:14.583 --> 00:04:17.374
We can keep the defaults or
configure the options.

72
00:04:17.374 --> 00:04:20.650
I think for our purposes,
we'll keep the defaults.

73
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.515
And yeah, do I want a depend on YAML?

74
00:04:24.515 --> 00:04:28.809
Sure, why not?

75
00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:31.964
And it is going ahead, and
it has created this file.

76
00:04:31.964 --> 00:04:33.628
And pay attention this down here.

77
00:04:33.628 --> 00:04:34.359
This is important.

78
00:04:34.359 --> 00:04:35.744
Don't ignore it.

79
00:04:35.744 --> 00:04:38.235
If you ignore it you can go to
the command palette and bring it back.

80
00:04:38.235 --> 00:04:40.570
It's fine, but it's here for a reason.

81
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.985
I'm ignoring it for a second because
I wanna talk about what's in here.

82
00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:49.034
But it went away.

83
00:04:49.034 --> 00:04:50.586
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You ignored it for too long.

84
00:04:50.586 --> 00:04:53.648
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I waited too long.

85
00:04:53.648 --> 00:04:59.307
So now in a.devcontainer,
we have devcontainer.json.

86
00:04:59.307 --> 00:05:03.236
Yes, another JSON file.

87
00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:06.368
In this case,
we talk about what image I want.

88
00:05:06.368 --> 00:05:08.838
In this case,
we want the TypeScript node image.

89
00:05:08.838 --> 00:05:15.017
Again, that's just a little Linux
image that happens to have node,

90
00:05:15.017 --> 00:05:18.861
NVM, a few other things kinda, built in.

91
00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:19.844
And then we're saying, hey.

92
00:05:19.844 --> 00:05:24.434
I would also The GitHub CLI and
the AWS CLI, yeah,

93
00:05:24.434 --> 00:05:30.771
we can kind of check out some of
these other things as well, which is,

94
00:05:30.771 --> 00:05:38.333
again, other like features that we might
want to add if you want to forward ports.

95
00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:45.039
And so, if you do, for instance, we might
choose to have like 5173 in here, right?

96
00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:50.941
Which is like the VET
one that we had earlier.

97
00:05:57.738 --> 00:06:02.641
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So cool, and any post
create, any particular customizations, so

98
00:06:02.641 --> 00:06:03.850
on and so forth.

99
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.317
What are you angry about?

100
00:06:05.317 --> 00:06:07.373
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Comma on
the previous configuration.

101
00:06:07.373 --> 00:06:11.098
I don't know what to have.

102
00:06:11.098 --> 00:06:14.197
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This is why
people YAML and Tamil and

103
00:06:14.197 --> 00:06:18.548
not JSON because you know
how often that bites me?

104
00:06:18.548 --> 00:06:20.210
I'll give you a hint,
it's three times a week.

105
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.223
[LAUGH] And
that's being generous [COUGH], right?

106
00:06:23.223 --> 00:06:26.597
There's certain things where,
if you've done them bad for this long,

107
00:06:26.597 --> 00:06:28.879
they're now muscle memory
to make the mistake.

108
00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:30.975
And that's where I live.

109
00:06:30.975 --> 00:06:34.107
So now we can play this game called so
first of all,

110
00:06:34.107 --> 00:06:38.893
one thing I'm gonna just show you real
quick is present working directory.

111
00:06:38.893 --> 00:06:42.255
I am on my computer, right?

112
00:06:42.255 --> 00:06:47.545
This is my computer, here I am, I can
do all sorts of things on my computer.

113
00:06:47.545 --> 00:06:50.619
Dev container has re open.

114
00:06:58.733 --> 00:07:01.567
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And so, if you
don't have Docker Desktop installed,

115
00:07:01.567 --> 00:07:02.742
VS Code will be a hero.

116
00:07:02.742 --> 00:07:09.079
And try to install it for you will
do some dragging and some dropping.

117
00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:11.515
And you can see that VS Code is reopening.

118
00:07:11.515 --> 00:07:15.265
In this case,
it looks like I am grabbing the,

119
00:07:15.265 --> 00:07:19.895
I think at this point,
might be grabbing the container.

120
00:07:19.895 --> 00:07:23.009
I think I'm just grabbing the tools.

121
00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:30.272
And we are back right, and
we are in here doing our thing.

122
00:07:30.272 --> 00:07:34.825
Let me go, sure install whatever
you want., I don't care.

123
00:07:34.825 --> 00:07:38.501
It's a container.

124
00:07:38.501 --> 00:07:44.284
It's not my real computer,
it's putting lots of like,

125
00:07:44.284 --> 00:07:48.981
I should not have just said,
put extra stuff in

126
00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:53.693
here while I'm not paying attention, cool.

127
00:07:53.693 --> 00:07:59.985
We've got one port exposed here as well.

128
00:07:59.985 --> 00:08:02.134
So now we got bash and look,

129
00:08:02.134 --> 00:08:06.628
I am the present working directory,
not on my computer.

130
00:08:06.628 --> 00:08:11.814
There's no user/Steve Kinney,
I am in a container.

131
00:08:11.814 --> 00:08:18.059
This is just Linux, but
like in effectively a virtual machine.

132
00:08:18.059 --> 00:08:23.062
But then if I look in here, it is my
files as they are on my computer as well.

133
00:08:23.062 --> 00:08:26.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It's like
a snapshot into a play sandbox.

134
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.677
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yep, exactly, right?

135
00:08:27.677 --> 00:08:30.614
And I could destroy
whatever I want in here and

136
00:08:30.614 --> 00:08:35.109
it's all basic, I can just rebuild
the container, and it's fine.

137
00:08:35.109 --> 00:08:39.814
But it's also like everyone else
who has this dev container and

138
00:08:39.814 --> 00:08:42.224
hits reopening dev container.

139
00:08:42.224 --> 00:08:49.075
Will be in a dev container running Node 22
right with the AWS CLI and the GitHub CLI.

140
00:08:49.075 --> 00:08:51.786
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Are those
files in the container?

141
00:08:51.786 --> 00:08:53.250
Are those linked?

142
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:59.108
I mean, is that really its own copy,
or is it the same files?

143
00:08:59.108 --> 00:09:03.823
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I don't know off
the top of my head, honestly.

144
00:09:03.823 --> 00:09:11.325
I'm assuming that it's probably my
guess is like, that is yeah, let's.

145
00:09:11.325 --> 00:09:16.226
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: If you made a change
in your workspace, hit save,

146
00:09:16.226 --> 00:09:19.155
you would be able to compare.

147
00:09:19.155 --> 00:09:20.576
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah, easy enough to check.

148
00:09:20.576 --> 00:09:23.219
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah.

149
00:09:23.219 --> 00:09:27.543
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So now I can go ahead and
let's do the npm run dev, and

150
00:09:27.543 --> 00:09:31.388
let's see if I hooked
up the port forwarding.

151
00:09:31.388 --> 00:09:35.452
I got npm install.

152
00:09:35.452 --> 00:09:40.848
All right, so we've got our different
dependencies, MPM installed.

153
00:09:40.848 --> 00:09:42.719
We've got this port forwarded.

154
00:09:42.719 --> 00:09:47.918
The one thing I need to make sure that
I do is when I do NPM run dev, VEET has

155
00:09:47.918 --> 00:09:53.412
the ability to like whether or not like
it is also available on the network.

156
00:09:53.412 --> 00:09:56.648
And technically while the port
from local host forwards,

157
00:09:56.648 --> 00:10:01.216
like you've gotta be on the receiving end
too, like for the development server.

158
00:10:01.216 --> 00:10:05.045
It was a regular web server
I should be good, but like,

159
00:10:05.045 --> 00:10:09.136
vet has to also, like,
put itself on the network as well.

160
00:10:09.136 --> 00:10:11.831
So all you gotta do there is this host,
and

161
00:10:11.831 --> 00:10:14.834
you should see that you get this little,
hey,

162
00:10:14.834 --> 00:10:20.076
you're running something on port 5173
that's one of the forwarded ports.

163
00:10:20.076 --> 00:10:22.231
Would you like to open the browser?

164
00:10:22.231 --> 00:10:23.522
100% I do.

165
00:10:23.522 --> 00:10:24.959
I didn't start the express servers.

166
00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:26.414
That one's not running.

167
00:10:26.414 --> 00:10:30.050
But, there are a bunch of other
interesting things that you can do in here

168
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:33.044
as well to kinda create that
exist consistent experience.

169
00:10:33.044 --> 00:10:36.167
Because now everyone that runs it
inside this container will be on

170
00:10:36.167 --> 00:10:37.430
the same version of node.

171
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.696
They will have the AWS CLI.

172
00:10:39.696 --> 00:10:42.090
Could you set up environment variables?

173
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.461
All that fun stuff.

174
00:10:43.461 --> 00:10:48.491
Absolutely, you can also do stuff

175
00:10:48.491 --> 00:10:52.830
like setting up extensions.

176
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.490
Is it in here, let's see.

177
00:11:11.321 --> 00:11:13.111
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Where
do I put my settings?

178
00:11:19.152 --> 00:11:24.039
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This kind of
my stuff is gonna drive me nuts.

179
00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:26.372
Is this one I want?

180
00:11:26.372 --> 00:11:33.684
The features,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So

181
00:11:33.684 --> 00:11:36.122
we can also set up,
here's just some randoms.

182
00:11:36.122 --> 00:11:37.432
Obviously, I don't want all these.

183
00:11:37.432 --> 00:11:43.947
I don't want the Azure tools,
because I don't have Azure set up on here.

184
00:11:43.947 --> 00:11:49.181
But some of the things that you
can also do is begin to set up,

185
00:11:49.181 --> 00:11:54.444
like, have settings for
that are true for this container.

186
00:11:54.444 --> 00:11:59.862
So now, not only will they have
the tools like the AWS CLI,

187
00:11:59.862 --> 00:12:05.612
the right version of node, but
you can also like, go ahead and

188
00:12:05.612 --> 00:12:11.272
have the consistent settings for
how VS Code should behave.

189
00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:16.689
I have to rebuild, and
I did the auto-complete

190
00:12:16.689 --> 00:12:22.514
of rando extensions, but
now if we go over in here,

191
00:12:22.514 --> 00:12:26.589
you'll see my local ones, right?

192
00:12:26.589 --> 00:12:32.221
The same ones I've had from earlier
in this are fun time together,

193
00:12:32.221 --> 00:12:35.047
plus, the AWS toolkit, right?

194
00:12:35.047 --> 00:12:38.436
Because, like, again,
we installed the AWS CLI, right?

195
00:12:38.436 --> 00:12:42.928
Everyone will have GitHub copilot and
the GitHub pull request and live share and

196
00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:46.226
prettier, and
a few other ones are now like, by default.

197
00:12:46.226 --> 00:12:51.832
But when you grab this repo with
this dev container.json, right?

198
00:12:51.832 --> 00:12:53.918
With like, okay, what version of Node?

199
00:12:53.918 --> 00:12:55.217
What other tools do you need?

200
00:12:55.217 --> 00:12:57.351
What extensions, what settings?

201
00:12:57.351 --> 00:12:59.727
Anyone who jumps into this environment and

202
00:12:59.727 --> 00:13:03.424
does the reopening container will
get a consistent environment.

203
00:13:03.424 --> 00:13:06.741
Now there's two people who like that,
you and your team,

204
00:13:06.741 --> 00:13:11.275
because now you're on a consistent
environment, or you the contractor who's

205
00:13:11.275 --> 00:13:16.432
on 17 different projects and does not need
to re-change everything for every project.

206
00:13:16.432 --> 00:13:20.603
You jump into one project, it's this
version of Ruby, right, and Postgres with

207
00:13:20.603 --> 00:13:24.730
this setup, you jump into the next
project, you're in a different container.

208
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.401
It's this version of Ruby.

209
00:13:26.401 --> 00:13:29.387
And my sequel and whatever, right?

210
00:13:29.387 --> 00:13:34.156
And so, you can have these kind of unique
to every given development situation.

211
00:13:34.156 --> 00:13:36.081
If you're I don't need that.

212
00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:37.465
Probably you're right.

213
00:13:37.465 --> 00:13:39.285
If you're I need that.

214
00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:40.883
Probably you're right.

215
00:13:40.883 --> 00:13:44.933
And so it is I think that
there are advantages of it.

216
00:13:44.933 --> 00:13:49.984
Yeah, having that consists it's
basically what is more complicated,

217
00:13:49.984 --> 00:13:55.803
juggling because who among, even front-end
engineers, come here for a second.

218
00:13:55.803 --> 00:13:58.937
You've all, we all had that day,
we lost NVM.

219
00:13:58.937 --> 00:14:00.117
You know what I mean?

220
00:14:00.117 --> 00:14:02.497
We've all lost that day.

221
00:14:02.497 --> 00:14:08.538
Or one version of NPM doesn't agree
with another one, or whatever.

222
00:14:08.538 --> 00:14:12.549
If that's the thing,
I work on one project,

223
00:14:12.549 --> 00:14:16.780
two repos, one project,
all day, every day.

224
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.347
So, depending on what you're doing, but

225
00:14:19.347 --> 00:14:24.342
is the complexity of juggling a bunch of
versions and different configurations and

226
00:14:24.342 --> 00:14:28.856
setups, and all this stuff harder than
having some of this stuff in place.

227
00:14:28.856 --> 00:14:31.469
Yeah, yes or no,
it will be the answer, no matter what.

228
00:14:31.469 --> 00:14:33.124
Right, like no.

229
00:14:33.124 --> 00:14:36.945
If you are always working on
one project all the time and

230
00:14:36.945 --> 00:14:43.273
with no server-side dependencies, and you
are connecting to like remote APIs, right?

231
00:14:43.273 --> 00:14:44.476
Great, good for you.

232
00:14:44.476 --> 00:14:47.133
I'm proud of you.

233
00:14:47.133 --> 00:14:50.538
If you are juggling yourself,
then this simplified everything,

234
00:14:50.538 --> 00:14:54.629
cuz as far as your acting, you're acting
like you're just in VS code, right?

235
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:58.248
But a consistent environment and
can switch between projects, and

236
00:14:58.248 --> 00:15:00.800
everything is good, and
everyone on the team.

237
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.134
Because again,
as a manager I know that I am giving week.

238
00:15:04.134 --> 00:15:07.737
Somebody didn't get stuff in done for
two days.

239
00:15:07.737 --> 00:15:09.999
Because their development
environment didn't work.

240
00:15:09.999 --> 00:15:16.140
Now, at least if it doesn't work, everyone
gets nothing done for two days, right?

241
00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:21.727
I had in like 2017, and insane setup
where it was like there was a belief

242
00:15:21.727 --> 00:15:27.864
system I worked at SendGrid at the time,
that you needed all of SendGrid running.

243
00:15:27.864 --> 00:15:30.397
In a box in order to,
like, make CSS changes.

244
00:15:30.397 --> 00:15:35.609
Spoiler alert, you didn't, but that was
too big for anyone computers you had to,

245
00:15:35.609 --> 00:15:40.303
like, remotely connect into some
containers in a data center in Chicago,

246
00:15:40.303 --> 00:15:44.720
which was great when it broke,
because it was like a snow day, right?

247
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.939
And it broke a lot, but
this is obviously on your machine.

248
00:15:47.939 --> 00:15:50.572
Everything's like running in
a consistent environment.

249
00:15:50.572 --> 00:15:54.752
And there's a lot to like about there's
a lot that you can set the settings and

250
00:15:54.752 --> 00:15:58.686
the extensions and have these things
like consistent amongst the team.

251
00:15:58.686 --> 00:16:01.778
Or inconsistent as you jump from
project to project, I mean,

252
00:16:01.778 --> 00:16:04.929
have a container that is exactly
what you need for this client,

253
00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:07.202
exactly what you need for
this other client.

254
00:16:07.202 --> 00:16:09.752
Either consistency amongst your team or

255
00:16:09.752 --> 00:16:15.157
your ability to like morph into different
versions of yourself for different tasks.

256
00:16:15.157 --> 00:16:18.077
Both are cool,
there's also a safety aspect,

257
00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:20.778
which is you are not
like you are contained.

258
00:16:20.778 --> 00:16:23.630
I have friends who, for a living,
bust out of Docker containers.

259
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.282
They work in security, so I get it.

260
00:16:26.282 --> 00:16:28.858
But generally speaking,
the hand-wavy version,

261
00:16:28.858 --> 00:16:31.969
you're in a safe little container
where nothing can go wrong.

262
00:16:31.969 --> 00:16:34.432
My friends are gonna text me later.

263
00:16:34.432 --> 00:16:40.260
But generally speaking, that case, and
like I said, at this point you can instead

264
00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:45.855
of just using a deviator, you can actually
just include a Docker file instead.

265
00:16:45.855 --> 00:16:47.951
You can do all of those things.

266
00:16:47.951 --> 00:16:52.774
There is an entire course here
on Docker containers, like this,

267
00:16:52.774 --> 00:16:56.380
if this is, you're more,
join them together.

268
00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:00.469
But like at the sake of boring
everyone who does not care about this,

269
00:17:00.469 --> 00:17:01.631
I'm not doing it.

270
00:17:01.631 --> 00:17:05.509
But yeah, and so for nowadays.

271
00:17:05.509 --> 00:17:06.200
In temporal,

272
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.662
we actually have a single binary that
I can just spin up as a shell thing.

273
00:17:09.662 --> 00:17:14.858
But in the beginning, I did have to
pull down six Docker containers,

274
00:17:14.858 --> 00:17:17.464
yada, and do all of those things.

275
00:17:17.464 --> 00:17:20.910
So, like you know if you need it,
this is a godsend if you do need it,

276
00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:24.726
if you don't need it, you now know that
it does exist if you ever do need it.

277
00:17:24.726 --> 00:17:25.977
And my mission is complete.
