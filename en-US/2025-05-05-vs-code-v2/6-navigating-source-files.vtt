00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.377
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I need to talk
to my Mac users for a second.

2
00:00:03.377 --> 00:00:08.929
There are, if you kind of even
go here you can see there's

3
00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:14.029
a lot of F12,
F8 there's some F2 kind of stuff.

4
00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:16.723
You have those keys on your keyboard.

5
00:00:16.723 --> 00:00:21.064
What happens if you press one?

6
00:00:21.064 --> 00:00:24.761
Brightness will go up and down, or
your sound will turn on and off, and

7
00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:26.150
stuff along those lines.

8
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.248
You can switch that in Mac OS,
if you go into the system settings,

9
00:00:31.248 --> 00:00:35.326
go to keyboard shortcuts,
go to function keys, and

10
00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:40.261
you can do, hey, I want them to
just be function keys, right?

11
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:43.400
And now, before you have that
FN key on your keyboard,

12
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.106
before it was gonna be brightness up and
down, and if you held FN, it would be F1,

13
00:00:48.106 --> 00:00:49.970
F2, now the opposite is true.

14
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.326
If you just touch the key,

15
00:00:51.326 --> 00:00:54.910
then it is now F1 if you need to
change the brightness hold function.

16
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.956
I think for the average person,
they want the keys with the brightness.

17
00:00:57.956 --> 00:01:02.259
For us as developers,
I want my F1 key back, please.

18
00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:09.146
So that is a little trick that you can
do to have your regular keys back.

19
00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:14.372
There are a few this kind of blends
a section where we call navigation,

20
00:01:14.372 --> 00:01:18.093
but a little bit of
the refactoring stuff as well,

21
00:01:18.093 --> 00:01:21.122
because they are kind of tied together.

22
00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:25.359
Which is we've got a bunch of
various things that we can do.

23
00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.805
One of which, and
these are again, very helpful for

24
00:01:28.805 --> 00:01:31.245
kind of navigating our code as well.

25
00:01:31.245 --> 00:01:34.261
If we take a given function,
if we right click on it,

26
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:36.947
you can see that we've
got some options here.

27
00:01:36.947 --> 00:01:40.351
We've got go to definition, what this
is the definition of the function add.

28
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:45.602
You can also go to References, and
this is where it is being used.

29
00:01:45.602 --> 00:01:49.630
Usually you want the opposite,
which is, I've got this ad now,

30
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.619
not particularly compelling.

31
00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.925
We all can kind of guess
what an add function does.

32
00:01:54.925 --> 00:02:00.207
But you can also kind of go to References
or the Definition in this case,

33
00:02:00.207 --> 00:02:05.861
which, depending on your language,
they might be the same thing, right?

34
00:02:05.861 --> 00:02:10.784
Java, it's gonna get a little more
nuanced a lot of cases, the reference and

35
00:02:10.784 --> 00:02:12.695
the definition are the same.

36
00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:14.734
And you can jump back and forth.

37
00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:19.653
The other thing you can do is, if you go
down to any given one of these functions,

38
00:02:19.653 --> 00:02:23.264
right, if you command click,
you will also jump to that.

39
00:02:23.264 --> 00:02:26.851
This works if it's in
a different file as well.

40
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:31.802
Also super useful if you're writing
Typescript and it's, it's this type.

41
00:02:31.802 --> 00:02:33.951
What is this type, right?

42
00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:36.932
You can a lot of times
command click on the type and

43
00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:39.130
go see the type definition as well.

44
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.787
So incredibly useful,
you don't have to know where that is.

45
00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:43.777
It could be down so

46
00:02:43.777 --> 00:02:48.209
far deep in node modules that you never
thought you'd have to journey in there.

47
00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.769
And you don't even know where the file is,
right?

48
00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.119
But in a lot of cases you will go ahead
and it will go ahead and find it for

49
00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:57.294
you, which is super useful a lot,

50
00:02:57.294 --> 00:03:00.823
I will instinctively do it
a number of the times as well.

51
00:03:00.823 --> 00:03:02.084
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What's command key for
that one?

52
00:03:02.084 --> 00:03:04.049
I used that one all the time.

53
00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.110
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
you've got the choice of F12 or whatever.

54
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.973
For me personally,
is I just command click.

55
00:03:12.973 --> 00:03:15.511
It's probably Ctrl+Click on windows.

56
00:03:15.511 --> 00:03:16.231
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

57
00:03:16.231 --> 00:03:20.194
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, and it will jump
right into it for you and kinda go back

58
00:03:20.194 --> 00:03:25.452
and forth from a reference of it being
used to this file to the implementation.

59
00:03:25.452 --> 00:03:29.657
If there are other options in a bigger
file, you'll see, kind of you'll get

60
00:03:29.657 --> 00:03:34.141
llittle sneak peeks of where it might be,
and you can kind of jump to the right one.

61
00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:41.070
I instinctively use that one all the time.

62
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.655
Other one that I use an actual ton.

63
00:03:46.655 --> 00:03:48.417
What's the old joke?

64
00:03:48.417 --> 00:03:52.855
The the hardest problems in
computer science are naming things,

65
00:03:52.855 --> 00:03:55.851
cache and validation and
off by one errors.

66
00:03:55.851 --> 00:04:02.913
A lot of times I am working on something
and I no longer the name of this function.

67
00:04:02.913 --> 00:04:07.282
Or I no longer whatever, the variable,
what have you, and I need to change it.

68
00:04:07.282 --> 00:04:12.641
Now, I do not, find and
replace is fraught with peril, right?

69
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:17.057
Because, if that's inside of another word,
right?

70
00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:20.718
For instance, if I just tried to find and
replace all ads,

71
00:04:20.718 --> 00:04:23.056
I would also change async ad as well.

72
00:04:23.056 --> 00:04:27.722
And who knows where else I would the
amount of chaos that I have caused with

73
00:04:27.722 --> 00:04:31.411
an overzealous Find and
Replace cannot be understated.

74
00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:33.429
I have caused more damage with Find and

75
00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:36.657
Replace than any other thing
in my entire programming life.

76
00:04:36.657 --> 00:04:42.497
This is the one that I use honestly
every day which is if you hit F2,

77
00:04:42.497 --> 00:04:47.088
you can rename a function variable and
throughout,

78
00:04:47.088 --> 00:04:52.745
especially if you're using
something with a language server.

79
00:04:52.745 --> 00:04:56.277
So TypeScript, Python,
most languages, unless,

80
00:04:56.277 --> 00:05:01.304
it's your own homegrown language or
whatever, most languages as long as.

81
00:05:01.304 --> 00:05:05.034
If you're using Zig installzigextension,
that's the only thing, right?

82
00:05:05.034 --> 00:05:05.687
You know what I mean?

83
00:05:05.687 --> 00:05:10.585
But for most major languages, you can go
ahead and it will use the language server

84
00:05:10.585 --> 00:05:15.212
where if you look, I can hover over this,
I get js.forit, same over here.

85
00:05:15.212 --> 00:05:16.565
If you hit F2.

86
00:05:18.463 --> 00:05:21.973
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
either place honestly, you can go ahead,

87
00:05:21.973 --> 00:05:23.775
let's call it sum now.

88
00:05:23.775 --> 00:05:26.230
And throughout my entire code base,

89
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.438
all references to the add function
are now called sum, right?

90
00:05:30.438 --> 00:05:33.418
And I can do a major refactor
throughout my entire code base and

91
00:05:33.418 --> 00:05:36.471
it will be renamed everywhere,
not through find and replace.

92
00:05:36.471 --> 00:05:40.965
But through that actual mechanism of go
from the implementation to the reference.

93
00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:44.056
Knowing that and knowing the type and
all those things,

94
00:05:44.056 --> 00:05:45.776
it will just do that all for me.

95
00:05:45.776 --> 00:05:48.160
If we don't believe me,
we can close this terminal.

96
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.370
It's taken up a lot of room cuz I
also have my font up very high.

97
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.337
It has been changed to sum, right?

98
00:05:54.337 --> 00:05:55.409
Yeah.

99
00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.598
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: In that context menu for
things sum,

100
00:05:59.598 --> 00:06:05.688
there's a definition and
a go to source definition.

101
00:06:05.688 --> 00:06:08.499
Should I worry about those at all?

102
00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:11.592
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, some of them,
I can't always remember the difference,

103
00:06:11.592 --> 00:06:13.670
especially if you just use Command click.

104
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.942
I don't even see them most the time.

105
00:06:14.942 --> 00:06:17.324
I think four things where your type and

106
00:06:17.324 --> 00:06:20.386
your class might be in
totally separate things.

107
00:06:20.386 --> 00:06:22.850
I'm thinking about Java in this case,
right?

108
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.216
I think that there's more nuance to
that in TypeScript, it doesn't really.

109
00:06:27.216 --> 00:06:31.731
Or it might be if I had a type separate
from the actual implementation,

110
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:33.884
those separate in a lot of cases.

111
00:06:33.884 --> 00:06:35.020
If there is more than one,

112
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.913
a lot of times that Cmd+Click will
show you a menu when we get into,

113
00:06:37.913 --> 00:06:41.236
a slightly bigger app, and you can kinda
see where they are and peek at them.

114
00:06:41.236 --> 00:06:47.109
A lot of times you get enough
context clues as well.

115
00:06:47.109 --> 00:06:51.239
Other things in terms of navigation is,
you can see you have these breadcrumbs up

116
00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:55.266
here which are, we saw that go to file and
we also had that go to symbol, right?

117
00:06:55.266 --> 00:06:58.851
So again, that symbol,
that same ability you had to jump between

118
00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:02.124
symbols is what's powering
that renamed symbol, right?

119
00:07:02.124 --> 00:07:04.203
And so it knows,
kind of what the name of this one is.

120
00:07:04.203 --> 00:07:05.423
I go down to subtract.

121
00:07:05.423 --> 00:07:06.736
You can see a change to subtract.

122
00:07:06.736 --> 00:07:08.987
I can see what file I'm in.

123
00:07:08.987 --> 00:07:12.339
I can kind of navigate to
things around that as well and

124
00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:14.510
find myself in different places.

125
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.677
How often do I do that?

126
00:07:15.677 --> 00:07:18.698
Not that often usually,
I'm trying to jump to a particular symbol.

127
00:07:18.698 --> 00:07:22.920
A lot of times, I'm jumping around my code
base without really paying attention to

128
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.384
what files I'm in, right?

129
00:07:24.384 --> 00:07:26.676
Obviously I look and I care, right?

130
00:07:26.676 --> 00:07:32.378
But I'm usually tracking out, that React
component is defined in this file.

131
00:07:32.378 --> 00:07:34.888
I need to go see the props, right?

132
00:07:34.888 --> 00:07:37.656
Or I need to change something about
that reaction component that I'm using.

133
00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:43.158
And you can kind of take
the place you're working and

134
00:07:43.158 --> 00:07:46.417
jump to the next place as well.

135
00:07:46.417 --> 00:07:49.850
But yeah,
that F2 worth its weight in gold.

136
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:55.886
Probably, and again, it will update
imports in different files as well.

137
00:07:55.886 --> 00:07:59.115
It will any place that the thing
would have been referenced,

138
00:07:59.115 --> 00:08:00.453
it will change the name.

139
00:08:00.453 --> 00:08:05.624
It has a few things that
I don't particularly,

140
00:08:05.624 --> 00:08:12.096
which is sometimes it will try
to alias the various things.

141
00:08:12.096 --> 00:08:17.871
I'll show you, if I go here and
let's say I hit F2,

142
00:08:17.871 --> 00:08:22.988
and I just want to call it add,
or let's call it

143
00:08:22.988 --> 00:08:28.257
asyncSum,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right,

144
00:08:28.257 --> 00:08:31.737
it's gonna alias it for me, right?

145
00:08:31.737 --> 00:08:35.671
Cuz I didn't change it in the actual file,
I changed the import.

146
00:08:35.671 --> 00:08:38.430
But you can see throughout
the rest of this file,

147
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:41.270
it did change it to asyncSum everywhere,
right?

148
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.795
So, now I'm importing two
things that have the same name.

149
00:08:44.795 --> 00:08:46.227
I need to change one of them.

150
00:08:46.227 --> 00:08:49.055
I don't have to sit there and
do it by hand, I hit one button,

151
00:08:49.055 --> 00:08:50.122
I give it its new name.

152
00:08:50.122 --> 00:08:55.768
However, put that back, we'll go in here,

153
00:08:55.768 --> 00:09:00.088
and we'll change it over in here.

154
00:09:00.088 --> 00:09:06.272
The actual one that we'll hit,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And if we go

155
00:09:06.272 --> 00:09:11.636
back into this file, you can see that it
did change the imports everywhere, right?

156
00:09:11.636 --> 00:09:15.501
And so now I can do large changes
a lot of times, obviously,

157
00:09:15.501 --> 00:09:20.852
changing add to some cute, but a react
component or something along those lines.

158
00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:23.724
Or a given helper method that now maybe
does something slightly different, or

159
00:09:23.724 --> 00:09:25.073
I named it poorly in the first place,

160
00:09:25.073 --> 00:09:27.482
because sometimes you don't
actually know what you're doing.

161
00:09:27.482 --> 00:09:31.281
You're still flailing around a little bit.

162
00:09:31.281 --> 00:09:34.204
You can just easily
change it everywhere and

163
00:09:34.204 --> 00:09:37.052
again throughout your code base, right?

164
00:09:37.052 --> 00:09:41.590
And this feature we'll kind of see later,
works super well you can,

165
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:47.224
particularly in TypeScript, rename a file,
or move a file into another directory,

166
00:09:47.224 --> 00:09:51.389
and it will update all the imports
everywhere for you, right?

167
00:09:51.389 --> 00:09:54.262
A lot of just really stuff
that would have been, yeah,

168
00:09:54.262 --> 00:09:56.584
just 20 minutes of my life down the drain.

169
00:09:56.584 --> 00:10:02.956
Not terrible, but real annoying
on the grand scheme of things.

170
00:10:02.956 --> 00:10:07.753
Other quick tricks, in terms of just
navigating within a given file,

171
00:10:07.753 --> 00:10:10.842
is you've got this outline here, which is,

172
00:10:10.842 --> 00:10:14.929
it'll be a little bit different for
every given language.

173
00:10:14.929 --> 00:10:19.355
For instance, in a markdown file,
it'll be your headings.

174
00:10:19.355 --> 00:10:24.666
And here you can kind of just see
the various pieces of your application.

175
00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:29.172
You've got A, you've got B,
if we went over into this math,

176
00:10:29.172 --> 00:10:32.215
you can see I've got the various pieces.

177
00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:34.360
And again,
this is all the language server,

178
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.286
which there are a bunch of them built in.

179
00:10:36.286 --> 00:10:39.321
TypeScript, for instance,
is built in, JavaScript is built in.

180
00:10:39.321 --> 00:10:44.289
But if you're using, again, Rust, you
just grab usually an official extension.

181
00:10:44.289 --> 00:10:48.296
Not everything is included, but there are
a lot of times Microsoft makes extensions

182
00:10:48.296 --> 00:10:50.789
and there'll be a language server for
that as well.

183
00:10:50.789 --> 00:10:54.624
My day job is in Svelte, right, which is
a JavaScript framework that has its own

184
00:10:54.624 --> 00:10:57.331
language server so
that I can navigate and jump around.

185
00:10:57.331 --> 00:11:01.030
So if you find that these
features are not working for you,

186
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:05.334
just make sure you have the right
extension that adds that support,

187
00:11:05.334 --> 00:11:09.738
and if that's if that doesn't exist,
well, you have two choices.

188
00:11:09.738 --> 00:11:12.342
Write your own or deal with it.

189
00:11:12.342 --> 00:11:17.342
Deal with it is probably the better the
two choices cuz writing a language server

190
00:11:17.342 --> 00:11:19.216
is a full day in alpha itself.

191
00:11:19.216 --> 00:11:21.195
Let's just put it that way.

192
00:11:21.195 --> 00:11:22.280
But yeah.

193
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:27.417
So yeah, trying to think if
there's any other major things

194
00:11:27.417 --> 00:11:33.696
we said before Cmd+P to jump to
a file as well, Cmd+Shift+O for that.

195
00:11:33.696 --> 00:11:36.224
In this case,
I can see the ones in this file, but

196
00:11:36.224 --> 00:11:39.373
I could even jump to something,
any function I wanna look and

197
00:11:39.373 --> 00:11:42.807
know the name of, I could hit Cmd+Shift+O,
try to jump for it.

198
00:11:42.807 --> 00:11:44.137
You can see this is at symbol.

199
00:11:44.137 --> 00:11:48.798
So again, if you don't even remember
Cmd+Shift+O, you only remember

200
00:11:48.798 --> 00:11:52.947
the regular command palette,
which is me for me for three years.

201
00:11:52.947 --> 00:11:56.210
You can just open the regular command
palette, change that to an add symbol and

202
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:57.057
you're good to go.

203
00:11:57.057 --> 00:12:00.390
Or in this case,
the colon will be a line jump.

204
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.616
This will just be a file.

205
00:12:01.616 --> 00:12:06.580
As long as you can get this thing open,
you can usually figure out the thing

206
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:11.085
you actually intended to do and
be okay with that in the beginning.

207
00:12:11.085 --> 00:12:13.717
Honestly, it's not that bad.

208
00:12:13.717 --> 00:12:18.003
Cuz you know you're in the wrong one and
then you just realize you need to do that,

209
00:12:18.003 --> 00:12:18.708
it's fine.

210
00:12:18.708 --> 00:12:23.027
Cool, so yeah, there's a bunch of
other ways to navigate around but

211
00:12:23.027 --> 00:12:28.170
those are the major and important ones and
again, F2, worth its weight in gold.

212
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:32.647
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you know the difference
between change all occurrences and

213
00:12:32.647 --> 00:12:33.859
rename symbol?

214
00:12:33.859 --> 00:12:34.397
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: No.

215
00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:37.941
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I don't.

216
00:12:37.941 --> 00:12:42.931
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: In theory, there's thoughts
it might mean one might be within the same

217
00:12:42.931 --> 00:12:44.940
one file kind of just a file.

218
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:49.433
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That is probably
like that when it changed it to an as

219
00:12:49.433 --> 00:12:53.196
versus the other thing, right, as well.

220
00:12:53.196 --> 00:12:55.509
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And with go to definition,

221
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:59.842
is there a way to set it up
to work across languages?

222
00:12:59.842 --> 00:13:05.393
If the same repo has both
a client project that's consuming

223
00:13:05.393 --> 00:13:10.501
an API from a backend language
could go to definition,

224
00:13:10.501 --> 00:13:14.289
jump to that API endpoints definition.

225
00:13:14.289 --> 00:13:17.404
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's go with a strong,
maybe, I think that, for

226
00:13:17.404 --> 00:13:20.605
instance, if they're all in TypeScript,
right?

227
00:13:20.605 --> 00:13:25.391
Yes, if one is in Javascript and

228
00:13:25.391 --> 00:13:28.590
one is in Go, maybe?

229
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:35.108
Probably not, is it possible, yes, need
some way to associate those things, right?

230
00:13:35.108 --> 00:13:43.321
And can the languages themselves do that
with the two language servers probably.

231
00:13:43.321 --> 00:13:44.852
Is your code base really set up for that?

232
00:13:44.852 --> 00:13:47.578
Almost definitely not, right?

233
00:13:47.578 --> 00:13:48.628
Is it possible?

234
00:13:48.628 --> 00:13:49.792
I'm sure it is.

235
00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:54.688
Is any code base I've ever worked in my
entire life in any way set up for that?

236
00:13:54.688 --> 00:13:58.810
Almost definitely not cuz
they're barely set up for

237
00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.439
me having the types match at all.

238
00:14:01.439 --> 00:14:02.761
But that's it.

239
00:14:02.761 --> 00:14:05.757
There's a longer rant about backends and
frontends for a different day.
