00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:02.811
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Here's
the thing about Cmd+P and

2
00:00:02.811 --> 00:00:06.685
Cmd+Shift+P, you're gonna mess it up,
right?

3
00:00:06.685 --> 00:00:10.037
You're gonna mean to open
the Cmnd palette, and

4
00:00:10.037 --> 00:00:13.816
sometimes you'll see the files,
you could close it.

5
00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:18.922
We'll see who's got the iSpy,
gold medal today,

6
00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:25.477
which is, if I hit Cmd+P,
I see the file switcher, not Cmd+O.

7
00:00:25.477 --> 00:00:28.899
That's a different thing
that I never want.

8
00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:30.353
If I hit Cmd+Shift+P,

9
00:00:30.353 --> 00:00:33.893
what's the difference in
the contents of that input field?

10
00:00:33.893 --> 00:00:34.719
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Secure it in there.

11
00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.521
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's secure it in there,
right, which is nice,

12
00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:39.723
because it means if you hit Cmd+P, and

13
00:00:39.723 --> 00:00:44.484
you meant to hit Cmd+Shift+P you just type
the caret and you're in the same place.

14
00:00:44.484 --> 00:00:48.938
If you did the opposite, you delete
the caret and you're in the same place.

15
00:00:48.938 --> 00:00:52.522
The only difference between
those two views is whether or

16
00:00:52.522 --> 00:00:55.369
not they put a caret in there for
you, right?

17
00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:58.983
So either one is an option as well.

18
00:00:58.983 --> 00:01:03.165
There's also this pound sign which,
what's this?

19
00:01:03.165 --> 00:01:06.730
This is actually super useful by the way.

20
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:13.266
In the given editor that you're in,
all of the quote-unquote symbols, right?

21
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:16.052
Or this is actually in the project itself,
right?

22
00:01:16.052 --> 00:01:22.011
So if all your functions are poorly named,
this is not super helpful for you.

23
00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:26.856
But we've all got those ones that
maybe pull in from an API and

24
00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:31.050
format your data, or
something along those lines.

25
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.539
If you know the name of
the function you're looking for,

26
00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.950
you can try to guess what file it's in.

27
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.095
Hopefully, you've made
that easy on yourself.

28
00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:42.025
But if you haven't,
you can also just kind of do this.

29
00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:43.527
And this is looking for a symbol, right?

30
00:01:43.527 --> 00:01:49.599
So this is the same as go to symbol and
editor, right, Cmd+Shift+O as well.

31
00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:54.485
And so here you can jump to a given
function, right, and see it as well.

32
00:01:54.485 --> 00:01:57.756
And we'll see some other ways
to kinda jump around later.

33
00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:02.598
But again, I mean, I'm repeating it over
and over and over again cuz it bears

34
00:02:02.598 --> 00:02:07.459
repeating at the beginning of this
workshop for all of the things, pausing.

35
00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.129
Anytime you catch yourself not thinking
your big brain thoughts, think about, why?

36
00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:12.836
What am I doing?

37
00:02:12.836 --> 00:02:17.539
And yes, the act of thinking about why is
a further distraction from your big brain

38
00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:19.874
thought, I get that 100%, right?

39
00:02:19.874 --> 00:02:25.816
But we're trying to do nice things for
future us and not current us in this case.

40
00:02:25.816 --> 00:02:26.590
Cool, cool, cool.

41
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.513
So we split editors.

42
00:02:28.513 --> 00:02:33.322
The other option that you can do,
there's things that you learn about

43
00:02:33.322 --> 00:02:37.904
an editor when you're preparing
to teach a workshop on an editor.

44
00:02:37.904 --> 00:02:41.204
You can also open, yeah,

45
00:02:41.204 --> 00:02:45.860
the same file in a new window as well.

46
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.320
I have never wanted to do that in my life.

47
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.900
I will split my editor a thousand
ways on a big enough screen.

48
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.056
I have never wanted to do that.

49
00:02:57.056 --> 00:03:02.204
The other feature that I
think is probably better for

50
00:03:02.204 --> 00:03:08.645
writing than it is for
coding is we've also got Zen mode, right?

51
00:03:08.645 --> 00:03:10.151
Which kinda focuses you in,

52
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:14.122
you can change some of the settings here
where you can only see a line or two.

53
00:03:14.122 --> 00:03:18.108
Very probably good for
writing a bunch of Markdown,

54
00:03:18.108 --> 00:03:21.291
usually not what I want when I'm coding.

55
00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:27.076
But more importantly,
if you find yourself in this view,

56
00:03:27.076 --> 00:03:30.512
that's how you got there as well.

57
00:03:30.512 --> 00:03:32.742
And any of these are changeable,

58
00:03:32.742 --> 00:03:36.732
we'll talk a little bit about
keyboard shortcuts in a bit.

59
00:03:36.732 --> 00:03:41.687
But if we have tabs,
we have got Cmd, Option Tab, or Ctrl,

60
00:03:41.687 --> 00:03:43.979
Alt and the arrows rather.

61
00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:46.583
And this will actually
split across panes as well.

62
00:03:46.583 --> 00:03:48.369
So if I have this one here,

63
00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:53.408
I can kind of walk across the different
tabs that I have, and it'll go from

64
00:03:53.408 --> 00:03:58.232
the first editor group to the second
editor group, so on and so forth.

65
00:03:58.232 --> 00:04:02.576
As well, like I said, we can jump
between the different editor groups.

66
00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:05.828
Like I said,
you've got that 1, 2, 3, 4, or

67
00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:10.706
you've got the ability to kind of move up,
down, left, and right as well.

68
00:04:10.706 --> 00:04:15.424
The other one is,
anyone ever have a failing test?

69
00:04:15.424 --> 00:04:19.007
Has that ever happened to any of you,
yeah?

70
00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:20.689
There's a bunch of really cool tricks,

71
00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:23.660
like sometimes you can probably just
Cmd or Ctrl click on it and open it.

72
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.230
But let's say you get
something where it's like or

73
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.754
maybe you saw it in the GitHub action or
CICD where it's like,

74
00:04:33.754 --> 00:04:40.681
you have a problem on such and
such file line 235, column 197, right?

75
00:04:40.681 --> 00:04:42.444
Let's go over to this one again.

76
00:04:42.444 --> 00:04:47.175
The other nice thing you can do is Ctrl+G,
or

77
00:04:47.175 --> 00:04:51.166
again, you just go to line/column.

78
00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:54.095
First, it tells you where
you are right now but

79
00:04:54.095 --> 00:04:57.565
you could also say that I
wanna go to line, I know 25.

80
00:05:04.784 --> 00:05:06.953
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Take me to line 25.

81
00:05:06.953 --> 00:05:11.566
I can jump to whatever line I need to jump
to and it'll shoot me down there as well.

82
00:05:11.566 --> 00:05:16.326
Again, the little things just for jumping
around cuz, yeah, in a 40 line file,

83
00:05:16.326 --> 00:05:17.213
not a big deal.

84
00:05:17.213 --> 00:05:20.524
We all know the file I'm talking about.

85
00:05:20.524 --> 00:05:22.788
You have that, we all have that file.

86
00:05:22.788 --> 00:05:23.657
We regret that file.

87
00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:29.394
Maybe it's some kinda auto generated
data or something along those lines.

88
00:05:29.394 --> 00:05:30.662
We all have the file.

89
00:05:30.662 --> 00:05:34.431
Each one of our 1000
line files are different.

90
00:05:34.431 --> 00:05:39.048
Sometimes they are deeply problematic,
but we all have them and so

91
00:05:39.048 --> 00:05:41.694
here we can jump around super easily.

92
00:05:41.694 --> 00:05:46.891
The other one that honestly
is worth the price

93
00:05:46.891 --> 00:05:51.541
of admission alone to this workshop is,

94
00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:56.761
I just say what I'm gonna
call go to bracket.

95
00:05:56.761 --> 00:05:59.968
I'm gonna call go to bracket cuz
it is called go to bracket, right?

96
00:05:59.968 --> 00:06:02.634
And that is why I'm going
to call it go to bracket.

97
00:06:02.634 --> 00:06:08.040
So we again, go to bracket,
is this Cmd+Shift+backslash.

98
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.428
And what it does is let's say you were in,
in this case, these parentheses.

99
00:06:19.525 --> 00:06:22.151
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: As you
can see very subtly.

100
00:06:22.151 --> 00:06:25.798
It will jump to the closing bracket,
right, from the opening to the closing.

101
00:06:25.798 --> 00:06:31.936
There is another useful one that we will
put a key binding to a little bit later,

102
00:06:31.936 --> 00:06:35.471
and the way that I discover
this one is going.

103
00:06:35.471 --> 00:06:37.569
I really wish VS code did this,

104
00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:41.459
half the time when you really
wish VS code did something.

105
00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:44.181
It might and what do you do?

106
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:50.909
You open up the Cmd palette, we sent you
the theme here, then you step in bracket.

107
00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:56.776
There is also select a bracket, when we
select everything in between two brackets.

108
00:06:56.776 --> 00:07:03.553
You will notice that this does not have a
key binding, you can control all of that.

109
00:07:03.553 --> 00:07:05.270
We will get there, we have an agenda.

110
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.973
I promise you,
we will talk about key bindings.

111
00:07:07.973 --> 00:07:12.280
But again, some of this starts with,
I really wish it would do such and such.

112
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.440
And then again,
training the ability to go in there and

113
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.253
find something I have never wanted.

114
00:07:19.253 --> 00:07:22.720
I guess, there's a word where
I might wanna do that one.

115
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.763
Select a bracket again,
just to show you the go to bracket.

116
00:07:26.763 --> 00:07:32.546
Except that I have definitely changed
that one and overloaded it at this point.

117
00:07:32.546 --> 00:07:36.568
But you can jump back and
forth between them.

118
00:07:36.568 --> 00:07:41.495
You will also find all the different
places where you have other apps that

119
00:07:41.495 --> 00:07:44.100
have taken over keyboard shortcuts.

120
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.892
We will talk about ways to dedupe that,
and at least on MacOS,

121
00:07:48.892 --> 00:07:51.482
see what some of them are as well.

122
00:07:51.482 --> 00:07:55.176
So here, we've got go to bracket,
it will jump between the two of them.

123
00:07:55.176 --> 00:07:59.564
Other fun ones is that
terminal we saw before,

124
00:07:59.564 --> 00:08:05.088
you can open it up, again,
there's a terminal Cmd here.

125
00:08:05.088 --> 00:08:09.433
But we can also hit, in this case,
on a Mac Ctrl+backtick, and

126
00:08:09.433 --> 00:08:11.456
it will open up the terminal.

127
00:08:11.456 --> 00:08:14.312
Now the interesting one,
again, this is where,

128
00:08:14.312 --> 00:08:17.378
there are some things that
do not happen into the box.

129
00:08:17.378 --> 00:08:20.964
We will fix them all later, as again,
we begin to build our own lightsaber.

130
00:08:20.964 --> 00:08:23.297
Which is to get back to the editor,

131
00:08:23.297 --> 00:08:28.855
you can hit either Cmd +1 to get back to
the first editor, or 2 to the second one.

132
00:08:28.855 --> 00:08:34.118
There's not really a great way
out of the box to get back

133
00:08:34.118 --> 00:08:39.167
into the terminal,
you can see if it works on yours.

134
00:08:39.167 --> 00:08:41.955
But I think, you can set one up so
you can go back and

135
00:08:41.955 --> 00:08:43.895
focus to it if it's already open.

136
00:08:43.895 --> 00:08:48.164
And we will set that up together in a
little bit, but you can jump around again.

137
00:08:48.164 --> 00:08:50.985
These are all the things where
that's not that hard, right?

138
00:08:50.985 --> 00:08:52.914
Also have a very small screen right now,

139
00:08:52.914 --> 00:08:56.453
not that I'm complaining about that
the entire time, but right now I am.

140
00:08:56.453 --> 00:09:00.429
But like all those things, if we can get
all those little micro things down to

141
00:09:00.429 --> 00:09:03.163
the point we can just think
our big brain thoughts and

142
00:09:03.163 --> 00:09:06.171
the rest becomes muscle memory,
we are happier people.

143
00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:09.793
Are you gonna memorize all these
immediately, cuz I said them once or

144
00:09:09.793 --> 00:09:11.051
cuz you read the notes?

145
00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:16.595
Probably not, but if you just, again,
build the habit, catching yourself and

146
00:09:16.595 --> 00:09:21.013
jumping down that you will see all
of the various pieces as well.

147
00:09:21.013 --> 00:09:26.338
Like I said, there's a lot of work
to do to customize the editor.

148
00:09:26.338 --> 00:09:28.310
All the ways that make us happy, again,

149
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.790
the ways that make me happy might not
be the ways that make you happy, and

150
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.223
we'll talk about how to personalize and
customize it in a little bit.

151
00:09:35.223 --> 00:09:41.291
But out of the box, these are some of
the high level ones that we have as well.

152
00:09:41.291 --> 00:09:46.297
In the kinda course website I did
grab some of the common ones and

153
00:09:46.297 --> 00:09:51.221
make some pretty tables with
what the various shortcuts are.

154
00:09:51.221 --> 00:09:55.856
Again, I got carried away, I put copy and

155
00:09:55.856 --> 00:09:59.441
paste in there, I don't know.

156
00:09:59.441 --> 00:10:05.415
But, yeah, some of the common ones that
you might need and use, because watching

157
00:10:05.415 --> 00:10:11.145
me go through every keyboard shortcut one
by one is probably a form of torture.

158
00:10:11.145 --> 00:10:16.629
So there is a reference again,
but pop quiz.

159
00:10:16.629 --> 00:10:19.593
What's the best way to figure out what
the keyboard shortcut is for something?

160
00:10:19.593 --> 00:10:20.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Use the Cmd palette.

161
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.058
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Use the Cmd palette,
right, again, building habit will not

162
00:10:24.058 --> 00:10:28.133
solve your problems overnight, but
probably over a week or two will.

163
00:10:28.133 --> 00:10:32.022
So that's not a bad timeline,
I'm into it, cool.

164
00:10:32.022 --> 00:10:38.915
So that's kind of something long and
short of the editor layout as well,

165
00:10:38.915 --> 00:10:45.188
just checking real quick if I've
got other big brain thoughts.

166
00:10:45.188 --> 00:10:50.634
Yeah, the other thing you can do in there
as well is, if you hit the up arrow,

167
00:10:50.634 --> 00:10:54.827
you can kinda also move through
some of the things as well.

168
00:10:54.827 --> 00:10:57.774
Again, it's a fuzzy search.

169
00:10:57.774 --> 00:10:59.661
So you can kinda explore.

170
00:10:59.661 --> 00:11:02.400
As you can see,
a lot of these have a little gear, right,

171
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.583
that is the ability to
add a key binding to it.

172
00:11:04.583 --> 00:11:09.572
We will talk about that dedicated in
its own little piece in a second or

173
00:11:09.572 --> 00:11:13.714
two, but kind of to give
a little spoiler alert, right?

174
00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:18.218
You can kind of see some of where
we're gonna go with this as well.
