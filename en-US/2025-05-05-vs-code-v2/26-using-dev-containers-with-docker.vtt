00:00:00.116 --> 00:00:02.269
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There's a bunch of
ways you can use Dev containers.

2
00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:05.942
The way that we're gonna play with it
today is with some docker containers.

3
00:00:05.942 --> 00:00:14.555
You can also connect to
a remote environment as well.

4
00:00:14.555 --> 00:00:18.575
We are not doing that because then
I would have to maintain a remote

5
00:00:18.575 --> 00:00:20.047
environment forever.

6
00:00:20.047 --> 00:00:25.596
And then Dustin will email
me when it goes down.

7
00:00:25.596 --> 00:00:27.741
So we're not doing that.

8
00:00:27.741 --> 00:00:31.569
But you can connect to things like GitHub,
Codespaces,

9
00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:36.449
CodeSandbox will actually do it,
if you ever use VS Code in the browser.

10
00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:42.504
In StackBlitz I think two you can actually
connect to them from VS Code as well,

11
00:00:42.504 --> 00:00:44.174
which is super cool.

12
00:00:44.174 --> 00:00:47.052
You should definitely try
it out at some point.

13
00:00:47.052 --> 00:00:51.034
The idea of a dev container is, obviously,

14
00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:55.565
you need stuff running on your computer,
right?

15
00:00:55.565 --> 00:01:01.284
And whether or not you need dev containers
depends on what stuff you are running.

16
00:01:01.284 --> 00:01:05.345
For instance, if you are just
purely a front-end engineer,

17
00:01:05.345 --> 00:01:08.795
you can probably take
a 10-minute nap right now.

18
00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:13.962
Generally speaking, sure,
you're running a version of node, but

19
00:01:13.962 --> 00:01:19.136
that's only being executed once,
Vite or Webpack or what have you.

20
00:01:19.136 --> 00:01:23.223
Compiles your code to something and
probably as long as you are not

21
00:01:23.223 --> 00:01:27.255
on an ancient version of Node
on your computer, probably good.

22
00:01:27.255 --> 00:01:30.073
Where things get more
complicated is again,

23
00:01:30.073 --> 00:01:34.669
if you do need consistency in the version,
if you're running server side

24
00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:38.990
code that is a lot more version dependent,
right than browser code.

25
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.997
Which were, I think if you're writing
browser code, the build tools are already

26
00:01:43.997 --> 00:01:48.658
ready for the wild world of browsers
in a thousand different environments.

27
00:01:48.658 --> 00:01:53.208
And so that part of the industry has
already dealt with that pain for so

28
00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:56.356
long that they've just
they're dead inside.

29
00:01:56.356 --> 00:02:02.072
If you're doing server code, and you need
to be on Node 22.17 because that's what

30
00:02:02.072 --> 00:02:07.094
you're using in production and one person
on your team is running a different

31
00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:11.832
version and then the tests don't pass,
nobody wants to deal with that.

32
00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:15.330
The other time you need containers is,
again,

33
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.399
if you're just spinning up a web server.

34
00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:23.943
If you need to spin up lots of
other things, Postgres, Temporal,

35
00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:29.784
which is a bunch of docker containers,
like many docker containers.

36
00:02:29.784 --> 00:02:34.998
All those things, then all of a sudden,
you probably want another setup.

37
00:02:34.998 --> 00:02:39.594
But again, the nice part is you
are running that code in a little

38
00:02:39.594 --> 00:02:44.124
contained environment,
not on your computer technically.

39
00:02:44.124 --> 00:02:46.325
So other reasons you might wanna use it,

40
00:02:46.325 --> 00:02:50.601
you're building AI-agents that are gonna
run stuff on the command line, and

41
00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:54.902
you'd like to do that in a safe space than
on your computer where it can go wild.

42
00:02:54.902 --> 00:02:59.522
Right, anything where you want that
kind of consistent environment,

43
00:02:59.522 --> 00:03:04.450
encapsulated, safe, little place where
everyone can be on the same page,

44
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.235
you might wanna consider a dev container.

45
00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:10.246
Does it add more complexity?

46
00:03:10.246 --> 00:03:12.212
It does.

47
00:03:12.212 --> 00:03:15.989
If you are just writing front-end code,
do you need it?

48
00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.254
No, I'm not even gonna say it may depend,
we probably don't.

49
00:03:20.254 --> 00:03:25.826
But if you are worried about, I remember
when I did do backend engineering,

50
00:03:25.826 --> 00:03:32.545
particularly Ruby before Docker, 10, 11,
12, I don't want to think about this.

51
00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:38.251
Every Mac OS update meant you weren't
getting anything done for a week.

52
00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:43.085
As you reinstall installed Postgres and
tried to figure everything out, so on and

53
00:03:43.085 --> 00:03:43.723
so forth.

54
00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:48.097
You just didn't upgrade
your software ever.

55
00:03:48.097 --> 00:03:52.857
So that's me now, this is for you.

56
00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:55.221
I was like five,
I don't know what you want from me.

57
00:03:55.221 --> 00:03:58.526
Then, okay, fine.

58
00:03:58.526 --> 00:03:59.798
That's, okay, the case too.

59
00:03:59.798 --> 00:04:01.767
So it's a way to have a consistent VI.

60
00:04:01.767 --> 00:04:05.735
And the nice part is means that everyone
is running in that same version,

61
00:04:05.735 --> 00:04:09.378
because it is, again,
a container that has that version of Node,

62
00:04:09.378 --> 00:04:13.476
that version of Postgres, with that
auth credential, so on and so forth,

63
00:04:13.476 --> 00:04:16.693
all running at the same ports,
connected in the same way.

64
00:04:16.693 --> 00:04:18.062
Yay, great, right?

65
00:04:18.062 --> 00:04:22.674
And what the Dev containers
allow you to do is basically,

66
00:04:22.674 --> 00:04:25.470
your VS code exists in that world.

67
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.296
It's like you're running
it on that computer,

68
00:04:29.296 --> 00:04:35.098
even though you're running on your
computer, everything feels great.

69
00:04:35.098 --> 00:04:38.697
It's like one of those things where
setting up a basic version, very easy.

70
00:04:38.697 --> 00:04:42.463
And we're going to do it together,
all of the weird,

71
00:04:42.463 --> 00:04:47.919
esoteric parts about your setup are going
to be squarely and hard, I'm sorry
