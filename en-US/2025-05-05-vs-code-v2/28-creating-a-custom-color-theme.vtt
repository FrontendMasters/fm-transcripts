1
00:00:00.073 --> 00:00:02.383
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's talk
about building extensions,

2
00:00:02.383 --> 00:00:04.831
we have seen extensions can be everything.

3
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:07.900
I mean,
the dev container stuff is an extension.

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.816
Just the ability to regex ES
build errors is an extension

5
00:00:12.816 --> 00:00:16.276
that just provides a problem matcher.

6
00:00:16.276 --> 00:00:20.724
Some pretty little icons are an extension.

7
00:00:20.724 --> 00:00:25.926
This theme is an extension that
AI toolkit that I said that was

8
00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:31.949
a full on app that is better than a lot
of there are other electron apps.

9
00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.251
The AI toolkit built into VS code is good,
right?

10
00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:41.918
Do you look at a PDF if I happen
to click on one cuz I work on

11
00:00:41.918 --> 00:00:48.585
the website sometimes and
terms of service and stuff like that.

12
00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:50.929
All of those things, this ability for

13
00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:55.039
the ChatGPT macOS app to hook into
VS code is an extension, right?

14
00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.226
So an extension could be
everywhere from a theme.

15
00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.622
All the way up to
an embedded app experience.

16
00:01:02.622 --> 00:01:07.364
You could build again, there's
a thousand of these apps that let you

17
00:01:07.364 --> 00:01:10.240
open a MySQL database and see the tables.

18
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.197
You could absolutely build
that inside of VS code, right?

19
00:01:13.197 --> 00:01:17.293
And just if I click on a SQL life file,
give me a UI cuz it's again,

20
00:01:17.293 --> 00:01:18.720
like there's no SQL.

21
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.414
The libraries there's, I'm using them
in these applications you could or

22
00:01:23.414 --> 00:01:25.187
for whatever you need to do.

23
00:01:25.187 --> 00:01:26.949
Again, I work on the developer tool.

24
00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:30.998
So, we are working on building one for
just using our own developer tool and

25
00:01:30.998 --> 00:01:34.096
all the integrations of like,
hey, spin up the server.

26
00:01:34.096 --> 00:01:38.317
Spin it down, jump into the web
UI to debug, start a workflow.

27
00:01:38.317 --> 00:01:42.853
Stop a workflow off,
those are all things you can do.

28
00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:45.746
And so we'll take a look at
a bunch of different options.

29
00:01:45.746 --> 00:01:51.803
Now if you want to set up the boilerplate,
I guess, could you do it by hand?

30
00:01:51.803 --> 00:01:53.007
You could do it by hand.

31
00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:54.010
Should you do it by hand?

32
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.244
Probably not.

33
00:01:55.244 --> 00:02:01.854
So let's talk about scaffolding extension,
gonna grab two things,

34
00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:06.459
which is Yeoman,
which is the CLI command is yo.

35
00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.437
And Yeoman uses generators
to generate projects.

36
00:02:09.437 --> 00:02:14.143
And this point code, not just generating
code, but like VS code, right?

37
00:02:14.143 --> 00:02:18.941
And so
far that even it's Visual Studio code.

38
00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:24.365
So this is the Yeoman generator for
VS code extensions, right?

39
00:02:24.365 --> 00:02:28.630
You run this,
you have the ability to do yo code,

40
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.051
which I've been waiting honestly for
multiple hours to say.

41
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:36.803
So, awesome.

42
00:02:36.803 --> 00:02:41.586
So I also have some boiler plates in
that repo ready to go that you can take

43
00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:42.320
a look at.

44
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.009
But for funsies,
we're gonna run it ourselves.

45
00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:53.143
So I'm just in that main directory,
yo code.

46
00:02:53.143 --> 00:02:58.368
Cool, and
you can see all of the different kinds of

47
00:02:58.368 --> 00:03:04.352
extensions that you can build,
we'll talk about them.

48
00:03:04.352 --> 00:03:09.848
New extension is kind of
world's your oyster, right?

49
00:03:09.848 --> 00:03:17.660
You can go anywhere from building that
AI toolkit to VS code pets, right?

50
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.554
Yes, I will remind you VS
code test still exists.

51
00:03:20.554 --> 00:03:23.440
It has not gone on my last three hours,

52
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.701
that is a VS code
extension we all deserve.

53
00:03:26.701 --> 00:03:29.477
You can do that either TypeScript or
JavaScript, what's the difference?

54
00:03:29.477 --> 00:03:34.962
One has a compile step.

55
00:03:34.962 --> 00:03:39.869
I had a one point check, which is I
believe that they are all still common JS

56
00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:44.700
because electron did not support ES
modules forever and ever and ever and

57
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.098
ever and VS code is an electron app.

58
00:03:47.098 --> 00:03:51.131
So there is a compile step here,
so on and so forth.

59
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:53.759
You just wanna make a color theme?

60
00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:59.595
Okay, you want to support your
new programming language.

61
00:03:59.595 --> 00:04:02.870
There's a front end master scores taught
by a very handsome instructor building on

62
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.738
programming language and then you can
make a language server for it too.

63
00:04:05.738 --> 00:04:11.616
You just wanna have your
code snippets available for

64
00:04:11.616 --> 00:04:19.239
either your team cuz you think you
did it better than somebody else.

65
00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.942
Extension packs, web extensions cuz
you can run VS Code in the browser.

66
00:04:23.942 --> 00:04:28.916
It's a different story for
a different day, but if you've ever seen

67
00:04:28.916 --> 00:04:34.507
GitHub Code spaces or Code Sandbox or
Stack Blitz or a thousand other things.

68
00:04:34.507 --> 00:04:37.879
Monaco is the name of
the editor inside VS Code.

69
00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:43.109
You can just put that in a browser,
it's so cool.

70
00:04:43.109 --> 00:04:47.635
Notebook renders are like,
if you've ever seen like Python, Jupiter,

71
00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:49.251
is it Jupiter or Jupyter?

72
00:04:49.251 --> 00:04:50.923
I've never said it out
loud before in my life.

73
00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:51.844
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Jupyter.

74
00:04:51.844 --> 00:04:54.934
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's gotta be Jupiter,
I'm gonna be really sad.

75
00:04:54.934 --> 00:04:56.953
I'm pretty Jupiter and then I said it.

76
00:04:56.953 --> 00:04:58.287
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Spell Jupyter, but.

77
00:04:58.287 --> 00:05:01.645
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, I've said
Jupiter privately all the time, but

78
00:05:01.645 --> 00:05:04.281
I also said Vite instead of Vite for
years.

79
00:05:04.281 --> 00:05:07.021
So I don't know what's going on.

80
00:05:07.021 --> 00:05:09.812
And you can create any given ones,
I already made

81
00:05:09.812 --> 00:05:14.183
a color theme extension that's in there,
but yeah, you can generate one.

82
00:05:14.183 --> 00:05:18.668
You will see some boilerplate,
I have a few ready to go, but

83
00:05:18.668 --> 00:05:24.502
other than run this generator and put in
the pieces of code that have nothing to

84
00:05:24.502 --> 00:05:30.457
do with Visual Studio Code, like the ones
I have in the repo are the same thing.

85
00:05:30.457 --> 00:05:35.932
So let's go ahead and
we'll do that instead.

86
00:05:35.932 --> 00:05:39.879
So we've got regular expressionists,
we've got very cool colors.

87
00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:45.146
We're gonna start there and
we're gonna take a look at it.

88
00:05:45.146 --> 00:05:51.750
And we're gonna open it up in code,
that font is so big.

89
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.234
How did I end up with this Amazon Q thing?

90
00:05:54.234 --> 00:05:56.204
I was talking, I said yes.

91
00:05:56.204 --> 00:05:58.805
I regret everything,
I'll install it later.

92
00:05:58.805 --> 00:06:03.537
I don't even know what it is, cool.

93
00:06:03.537 --> 00:06:08.879
So in this case, this is, again,
the output of the generator for

94
00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:15.486
a VS code extension, which really in this
point, if we look at the package JSON,

95
00:06:15.486 --> 00:06:22.121
the one of the major things in any VS code
extension is, what does it contribute?

96
00:06:22.121 --> 00:06:23.777
Right?
If it is commands,

97
00:06:23.777 --> 00:06:28.574
we saw that we can always assign
key bindings to a given command

98
00:06:28.574 --> 00:06:32.817
where it would been,
workbench.actions or GitHub,

99
00:06:32.817 --> 00:06:37.631
dot whatever, temporal,
dot whatever, so on and so forth.

100
00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:42.086
You can contribute settings,
you can get anything that like,

101
00:06:42.086 --> 00:06:46.791
what are the ways in which you
are extending VS code with this plugin

102
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:50.756
that goes in your package,
JSON as a manifest, right?

103
00:06:50.756 --> 00:06:54.633
So in this case,
we are just contributing a theme,

104
00:06:54.633 --> 00:06:59.246
which I have called very cool colors,
which is a dark theme.

105
00:06:59.246 --> 00:07:06.130
And it is available in /themes/Very
Cool Colors-color-theme.json, right?

106
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:11.929
Other tasty notes here is we can
see that there is a launch.json,

107
00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:18.264
which is using a type we haven't
seen before, called extensionHost.

108
00:07:18.264 --> 00:07:23.711
This basically gives you the ability
to launch the extension in a little

109
00:07:23.711 --> 00:07:28.728
real separate version of VS code and
play around with it, right?

110
00:07:28.728 --> 00:07:31.313
And so if we think about this extension,

111
00:07:31.313 --> 00:07:36.418
this is our very simple start here where
effectively we've got a package JSON.

112
00:07:36.418 --> 00:07:41.344
We got a theme JSON,
we got a lot of JSON in here.

113
00:07:41.344 --> 00:07:44.211
We don't have anything, but JSON.

114
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:45.749
We got a VS code ignore, which is like,

115
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:47.860
what are the parts that
are not part of the extension?

116
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.724
It's very similar to an NPM ignore, or,
arguably, get ignore, which is like,

117
00:07:51.724 --> 00:07:55.196
which are the parts we don't need to
publish NPM, which are the parts that

118
00:07:55.196 --> 00:07:58.004
should not be bundled in the extension,
so on and so forth.

119
00:07:58.004 --> 00:08:03.009
But yeah, actually, we just got
JSON files, so I can hit F5 and

120
00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:07.112
you can see I get a more
different version of VS Code.

121
00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:09.708
What is fundamentally
different about this VS Code?

122
00:08:09.708 --> 00:08:13.138
The theme, why?

123
00:08:13.138 --> 00:08:16.714
Cuz this is the rando theme that I made.

124
00:08:16.714 --> 00:08:20.524
I don't know, it's a theme,

125
00:08:20.524 --> 00:08:24.491
this Amazon, IQ is still here.

126
00:08:24.491 --> 00:08:26.292
Yeah, is it a good looking theme?

127
00:08:26.292 --> 00:08:34.273
No, did I just pick random colors?

128
00:08:34.273 --> 00:08:39.467
100%, do I kind of like it?

129
00:08:39.467 --> 00:08:44.202
It's a little retro and I'm kind of
into it and it's kind of growing on me.

130
00:08:44.202 --> 00:08:46.934
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Does it also
change the font colors too?

131
00:08:46.934 --> 00:08:47.654
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.

132
00:08:47.654 --> 00:08:49.973
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Cool.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, cuz if we look,

133
00:08:49.973 --> 00:08:52.398
I mean, it's very subtle.

134
00:08:52.398 --> 00:08:56.931
I mean, there's nothing in this file, but.

135
00:08:56.931 --> 00:08:57.948
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Nice.

136
00:08:57.948 --> 00:09:03.385
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, and so I mean,
I basically just generated a color

137
00:09:03.385 --> 00:09:09.066
palette and kind of ad hoc
replaced existing colors with.

138
00:09:09.066 --> 00:09:14.669
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What's the steps if you
want to publish this on to the world?

139
00:09:14.669 --> 00:09:19.241
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, so
there is another tool called VSCE.

140
00:09:19.241 --> 00:09:24.208
I think if I just do NPM.

141
00:09:24.208 --> 00:09:29.306
VSCE obviously, so
now it's been renamed VS code.

142
00:09:29.306 --> 00:09:31.611
Okay, the binary is the same.

143
00:09:35.252 --> 00:09:40.113
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So here we can kind of
go ahead and you can MPM it or whatever.

144
00:09:40.113 --> 00:09:44.798
But basically, I think you run,
if I'm not mistaken,

145
00:09:44.798 --> 00:09:48.996
you run VSE package and
then VSE publish, right?

146
00:09:48.996 --> 00:09:52.941
You need an account and
stuff like that, but that is the same.

147
00:09:52.941 --> 00:09:55.807
It's not dissimilar to NPM, right?

148
00:09:55.807 --> 00:10:00.770
And that is why it is also,
if we go to the extensions.

149
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:05.748
There's a few where everyone

150
00:10:05.748 --> 00:10:10.730
made their own version of it.

151
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.195
You know what I mean?

152
00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:17.422
Even like night owl, the theme,
there's night owl, there's Sarah's,

153
00:10:17.422 --> 00:10:22.895
then there's not all black and there's
night all theme and there's overnight

154
00:10:22.895 --> 00:10:27.730
owl then there's, like, it doesn't
take a lot to follow us a theme.

155
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:32.751
[LAUGH] Right which is also
the free tidbit themes whatever

156
00:10:32.751 --> 00:10:39.026
pick the thing you like extension of
like work with Postgres database,

157
00:10:39.026 --> 00:10:43.333
choose the one that has the downloads,
please.

158
00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:45.519
Don't choose the one that is,

159
00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:50.915
all the way at the bottom where it's
814 people have ever downloaded it.

160
00:10:50.915 --> 00:10:53.208
You know what I mean?

161
00:10:53.208 --> 00:10:56.622
I'm very curious what Iron Man theme is.

162
00:10:56.622 --> 00:11:00.395
But, for some of these, there you'll see,

163
00:11:00.395 --> 00:11:06.347
a lot of copies of a given, like,
one, I'm sure, if I type in SQLite,

164
00:11:06.347 --> 00:11:11.216
there's this one that's
got 3.3 million downloads,

165
00:11:11.216 --> 00:11:15.122
and then there's lots of other ones,
right?

166
00:11:15.122 --> 00:11:19.141
Not say they're bad, but again,
the bar, you do not need to get.

167
00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:22.415
It's not like getting into the Apple
App Store, you gotta sign the thing and

168
00:11:22.415 --> 00:11:24.273
pay the however many hundreds of dollars.

169
00:11:24.273 --> 00:11:27.692
It's like, NPM,
make an account, hit Publish.

170
00:11:27.692 --> 00:11:32.371
Yeah, you made extension.

171
00:11:32.371 --> 00:11:37.849
Yeah, so, yes, that's a theme, right?

172
00:11:37.849 --> 00:11:44.310
And like I said, all I really did
was adjust some colors, right?

173
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:49.312
And so if you like a theme or you wanna
like, and these are all the various,

174
00:11:49.312 --> 00:11:52.621
every, when VS Code looks at your code,
again,

175
00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:57.732
whatever the language service is,
figures out what every token is.

176
00:11:57.732 --> 00:11:59.375
Const means this.

177
00:11:59.375 --> 00:12:00.404
Is equal, you know what I mean?

178
00:12:00.404 --> 00:12:03.793
Figures out what every token is,
and then for,

179
00:12:03.793 --> 00:12:09.897
obviously panel background makes sense,
but for the token colors, comments,

180
00:12:09.897 --> 00:12:15.695
comments should be Italic and be this
color variables, you get the point right.

181
00:12:15.695 --> 00:12:19.687
You kind of tweak the colors
to your heart's content.

182
00:12:19.687 --> 00:12:22.011
If it's not running, you hit F5.

183
00:12:22.011 --> 00:12:24.872
And then when you are in there,

184
00:12:24.872 --> 00:12:30.828
you do have to hit command R to
refresh and reload the extension.

185
00:12:30.828 --> 00:12:37.183
And so for instance,
let's say too many windows open.

186
00:12:37.183 --> 00:12:44.195
Variables, let's change this
to something egregious,

187
00:12:44.195 --> 00:12:49.926
sure that should get the point across,
right?

188
00:12:54.305 --> 00:13:01.260
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
now my hello is a deep fiesta red.

189
00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.231
And you can kind of get a sense that
get everything working the way that you

190
00:13:04.231 --> 00:13:05.263
want it to get it to work.

191
00:13:05.263 --> 00:13:08.760
And that is true of other
extensions as well.

192
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.474
Let's take a look at another extension.

193
00:13:10.474 --> 00:13:14.776
I need to make this, I don't know what
Amazon Q is, but it needs to go away.

194
00:13:14.776 --> 00:13:17.426
So I'm not setting it up right now.

195
00:13:17.426 --> 00:13:20.997
It's the most capable generative
AI powered system for building,

196
00:13:20.997 --> 00:13:23.073
operating, transforming software.

197
00:13:23.073 --> 00:13:26.808
I will definitely play with it later,
seems cool.

198
00:13:26.808 --> 00:13:30.247
Not right now, I'm busy with my friends.

199
00:13:30.247 --> 00:13:34.308
And then you can either close it or
let's close some of these.

200
00:13:34.308 --> 00:13:37.486
That was very cool colors.

201
00:13:37.486 --> 00:13:41.908
You can hit it's the same as the debugger
where you can at the stop example from

202
00:13:41.908 --> 00:13:42.872
before as well.
