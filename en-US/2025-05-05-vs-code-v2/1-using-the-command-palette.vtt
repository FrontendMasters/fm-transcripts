00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.848
&gt;&gt; Steve: So this is Visual Studio
code you might have seen it before.

2
00:00:02.848 --> 00:00:07.488
Some tasty notes as I jump in,
I mostly set all of my

3
00:00:07.488 --> 00:00:12.471
environment back to like standard,
vanilla setup.

4
00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:16.842
Some changes are like left
some extensions installed,

5
00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:21.771
because when we get to exploring
extensions watching means all

6
00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:25.216
of them one by one seemed terrible, right?

7
00:00:25.216 --> 00:00:28.087
So some of them are installed,
but other than that,

8
00:00:28.087 --> 00:00:31.954
I wiped away all of my key bindings,
all of my snippets, everything.

9
00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:37.595
So I'm hopefully starting as close
to a tabla rasa as anyone else.

10
00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:40.878
You do not need to do the same, but
I do because I'm the one teaching.

11
00:00:40.878 --> 00:00:46.009
So I've got the examples open,
but let's say that you don't.

12
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:48.042
There are a number of ways
to go about doing it.

13
00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:54.318
One is to go to the file menu,
find open, I have never done this.

14
00:00:54.318 --> 00:00:56.981
There's a lot of things we
were talking about today,

15
00:00:56.981 --> 00:01:00.131
which is it's a thing that you can
do that I have never done why?

16
00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:03.028
Not totally sure it seems like
a totally reasonable thing to do.

17
00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:06.723
The other option is you can go ahead and

18
00:01:06.723 --> 00:01:11.575
there is a ability if you
hit Command-Shift-P or

19
00:01:11.575 --> 00:01:16.312
Control-Shift-P, because
if I say Control or

20
00:01:16.312 --> 00:01:20.489
Command, if you are on Windows, swap it.

21
00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:24.762
Unless I'm very explicit
that I really meant control.

22
00:01:24.762 --> 00:01:29.564
Then we'll talk about later but we will
talk a little bit more about the command

23
00:01:29.564 --> 00:01:33.664
palette in a second, but
the command palette is your best friend.

24
00:01:33.664 --> 00:01:38.088
But there is something fun in here
that if you have not done this before,

25
00:01:38.088 --> 00:01:43.031
you should definitely look at doing,
which is this install code command in your

26
00:01:43.031 --> 00:01:45.785
path and
this will install a little binary.

27
00:01:45.785 --> 00:01:49.142
Well, it's technically already
installed it'll put in your path.

28
00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:54.167
That will let you go navigate
around your terminal, and then you

29
00:01:54.167 --> 00:02:00.421
can type code dot or code a given folder,
and it will open that folder in VS Code.

30
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:04.369
So like, anywhere you are on the command
line, you can type in code dot for

31
00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.698
the current folder, if you wanna open a
different folder, what have you so on and

32
00:02:08.698 --> 00:02:09.289
so forth.

33
00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.145
We'll be doing both today,
because, like, in the beginning,

34
00:02:11.145 --> 00:02:12.273
I'm just gonna start in the main repo.

35
00:02:12.273 --> 00:02:14.344
But like, as you can tell,
if you download the repo,

36
00:02:14.344 --> 00:02:16.013
it's a bunch of little smaller projects.

37
00:02:16.013 --> 00:02:18.961
Sometimes we will laser focus
into one of those and so

38
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:22.043
we'll kind of navigate brigade up,
down and around.

39
00:02:22.043 --> 00:02:27.045
But I've already installed this otherwise,
if that's not working for

40
00:02:27.045 --> 00:02:30.493
you for some reason,
open will always also work.

41
00:02:30.493 --> 00:02:38.491
But like I said, 99.99999% of the time
I will usually use the command line,

42
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:42.506
navigate there and
then open it in VS Code.

43
00:02:42.506 --> 00:02:50.005
But upon doing that, we should be welcomed
by this beautiful, lovely, empty editor.

44
00:02:50.005 --> 00:02:53.850
Some things probably need no introduction.

45
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.943
Over here we have like
the files in the directory,

46
00:02:57.943 --> 00:03:02.140
obviously a full file tree
of everything in there.

47
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.762
This is kind of the activity bar along the
side where you'll see your file explorer,

48
00:03:07.762 --> 00:03:12.592
the ability to search across the entire
project, some source control,

49
00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:15.145
this ability to run and debug things.

50
00:03:15.145 --> 00:03:18.799
Extensions, and this is where it gets
a little squirrelly which is depending on

51
00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.988
the extensions other
stuff might appear here.

52
00:03:20.988 --> 00:03:25.203
Like we have some integration
with various testing tools.

53
00:03:25.203 --> 00:03:29.175
In this case, I do have Github actions
in here, Github Pull Request, and

54
00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:33.550
this little AI toolkit, which we'll
talk about later, cuz that's very cool.

55
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.424
You've got a status bar down here,

56
00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:39.299
which will kind of show you the different
kind of file type that you might be

57
00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.129
working with, as well as some other
fun little things down here as well.

58
00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.666
When something turns bright red, pay
attention to it but generally speaking,

59
00:03:47.666 --> 00:03:49.232
it's subtle for a reason.

60
00:03:49.232 --> 00:03:53.451
If you ever forget the command palettes,
keystroke,

61
00:03:53.451 --> 00:03:58.497
which is Command+Shift+P,
which will probably get worn out on

62
00:03:58.497 --> 00:04:03.558
your keyboard by the end of day,
you can also just click here too.

63
00:04:03.558 --> 00:04:07.989
One of the things I wanna point out,
and we'll see this over and

64
00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.419
over and over and over again,
is if anything has a key binding,

65
00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.196
you will see it in the command palette.

66
00:04:15.196 --> 00:04:19.687
The practice that I want
to instill in you right

67
00:04:19.687 --> 00:04:24.522
now is any time today,
in the future, whenever,

68
00:04:24.522 --> 00:04:29.952
you catch yourself doing
something somewhat tedious.

69
00:04:29.952 --> 00:04:32.391
Pause, hit Cmd+Shift+P, and

70
00:04:32.391 --> 00:04:37.364
just search to see if there's an option
to do it a little bit easier.

71
00:04:37.364 --> 00:04:39.853
Maybe it has a key binding,
maybe it doesn't,

72
00:04:39.853 --> 00:04:43.790
we'll figure out how to give it one if
you want to so on and so forth, right?

73
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.555
Because we will talk about some
of the keyboard shortcuts.

74
00:04:48.555 --> 00:04:53.204
I will tell you them, I will do stuff with
my hands to make them happen on my screen.

75
00:04:53.204 --> 00:04:57.960
Will you memorize all of them
the very first time I say a keyboard

76
00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.497
shortcut out loud?

77
00:04:59.497 --> 00:05:04.015
No right the kind of the best
way to do it is to and again,

78
00:05:04.015 --> 00:05:11.110
install the habit right now, of like, if
you catch yourself doing something where.

79
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.491
There's I think a lot of vim users want to
talk about the fact that every time you

80
00:05:14.491 --> 00:05:17.273
reach for the mouse,
it's like a drainage your productivity.

81
00:05:17.273 --> 00:05:21.478
I understand where my track pad is in
relation to my keyboard that it's not that

82
00:05:21.478 --> 00:05:25.065
big a deal these days, but
I think the idea is still there, right?

83
00:05:25.065 --> 00:05:29.018
Because, like, if you find yourself,
I wanna jump to other editor pane,

84
00:05:29.018 --> 00:05:32.987
or, I wanna jump over to search, or
something along those lines, right?

85
00:05:32.987 --> 00:05:36.601
Now installing the like feeling
of pausing, thinking about it,

86
00:05:36.601 --> 00:05:40.939
just even sometimes going into the command
palette, because there's also,

87
00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:45.031
like a lot of little things that maybe
you didn't even know were in there.

88
00:05:45.031 --> 00:05:49.139
And some of them will only be important to
you if you find yourself doing them right?

89
00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.419
The other way to find out some keystrokes
sometimes is if you hover over stuff,

90
00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.541
sometimes they will be
revealed to you right?

91
00:05:57.541 --> 00:06:02.644
So that's how you switch from the explorer
to search is hovering over these

92
00:06:02.644 --> 00:06:08.167
various things and seeing what the various
keyboard shortcuts are in this case.

93
00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:13.123
But like I said, we've got like a little,
there's a little folder in

94
00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:17.669
here called playground,
which is a very, very exciting file.

95
00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:23.219
He says, thinking he
understands alphabetical order.

96
00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:27.640
And there's some little stuff in here,
we can put this back in a little bit but

97
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.555
there are lots of little things.

98
00:06:35.085 --> 00:06:38.660
&gt;&gt; Steve: You can say apple,

99
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.806
carrot, grape, banana.

100
00:06:43.806 --> 00:06:47.933
You could select all these things unless
I wanna sort them ascendingly, right?

101
00:06:47.933 --> 00:06:52.028
I could look up how to do that,
I could do it by hand, or

102
00:06:52.028 --> 00:06:55.759
I can hit Command+Shift+P
just type in sort and

103
00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:00.491
see I've got sort lines ascending,
sort lines descending.

104
00:07:00.491 --> 00:07:03.663
Great, awesome, pick that and
it'll just do it.

105
00:07:03.663 --> 00:07:07.727
So anytime you find yourself pausing and
thinking, stop, just type the thing into

106
00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:11.048
the command palette for a second,
just see if it's there already.

107
00:07:11.048 --> 00:07:15.109
If not, we'll explore extensions, we'll
talk about all sorts of other stuff and

108
00:07:15.109 --> 00:07:16.510
key bindings and snippets.

109
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:21.063
But step one, annoying thing that I was
about to break my train of thought and

110
00:07:21.063 --> 00:07:25.119
stop thinking big brain thoughts to do,
pause, Command, Shift,

111
00:07:25.119 --> 00:07:27.628
fee, see if there's an option, right?

112
00:07:27.628 --> 00:07:32.626
There's all sorts of things from like
sorting lines to removing duplicates,

113
00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:33.846
so on and so forth.

114
00:07:33.846 --> 00:07:37.139
So that's kind of the like subtle
subconscious practice that

115
00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:41.461
we're gonna do through this entire time
together, which is at any given point.

116
00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.865
And the nice part is,
I think like an hour ago,

117
00:07:43.865 --> 00:07:46.650
Steve said something about
I can split editor panes.

118
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:51.279
I don't remember you
just Command+shift+P and

119
00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:56.358
you type split, and
there's the keyboard shortcut.

120
00:07:56.358 --> 00:07:58.879
Or other options that maybe you
didn't even know were there and

121
00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:00.746
some of them don't have
keyboard shortcuts.

122
00:08:00.746 --> 00:08:02.985
And sometimes they have
crazy ones like this, and

123
00:08:02.985 --> 00:08:05.881
I'll talk about what that means
in a second, so on and so forth.

124
00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:10.517
But you can kind of see all of these kind
of like fun things, like about like code

125
00:08:10.517 --> 00:08:14.884
folding and what level you want to fold
everything to, so on and so forth.

126
00:08:14.884 --> 00:08:19.694
Join lines great, anything you might need
to do, pause, stop, Command+Shift view, or

127
00:08:19.694 --> 00:08:21.954
just click this thing up here, whatever.

128
00:08:21.954 --> 00:08:25.276
But if you find yourself clicking it,
that's, again, the practice,

129
00:08:25.276 --> 00:08:26.641
learn the shortcut, right?

130
00:08:26.641 --> 00:08:30.893
You'll be happier, 'cause then like all
of a sudden it becomes muscle memory and

131
00:08:30.893 --> 00:08:34.959
you find yourself standing in front of
a podium trying to explain in words stuff

132
00:08:34.959 --> 00:08:36.953
that has become second nature to you.

133
00:08:36.953 --> 00:08:39.120
And so that's kind of how
you build it up as well.
