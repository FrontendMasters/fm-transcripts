00:00:00.117 --> 00:00:02.745
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Real quick,
just because this is more of a PSA,

2
00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:07.100
which will not apply to most people, but
I want to point it out if it's a thing.

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.324
I am a person whose backend web server,

4
00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:15.165
it's not showing my we moved it in.

5
00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:19.039
I was a person where the backend
web server is in one repo,

6
00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.965
in one folder the front
end is another one.

7
00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:26.107
You can create multi-root workspaces,

8
00:00:26.107 --> 00:00:30.130
which is instead of right now a folder and

9
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.519
a workspace have been synonymous, right?

10
00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:39.336
You can also kind of separate
that out where you can kind

11
00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:42.904
of go new works space from file, right?

12
00:00:42.904 --> 00:00:47.332
And if you have a .workspace,
you can actually create one, which is hey,

13
00:00:47.332 --> 00:00:50.019
I got two projects in
two different folders.

14
00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.107
I wanna act like they're one thing right?

15
00:00:53.107 --> 00:00:58.451
And now there's like two repos and you got
like, jump back and forth and it works.

16
00:00:58.451 --> 00:01:02.412
I'm sure somebody likes it but
yeah, they are it's useful if you

17
00:01:02.412 --> 00:01:06.963
are treating them like one thing, but
I moved it into the repo for a reason.

18
00:01:06.963 --> 00:01:14.118
There are clips that frontend
masters have put of me on TikTok,

19
00:01:14.118 --> 00:01:19.113
where I have hot takes
on micro frontends and

20
00:01:19.113 --> 00:01:24.919
multiple repos and
I think it's always a bad idea.

21
00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:28.523
But I know people who inherit
bad ideas from other people, and

22
00:01:28.523 --> 00:01:30.681
they live in this world regardless.

23
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:34.631
So there's some guidance
here on just kind of having

24
00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:38.960
a workspace where the projects
are in multiple folders.

25
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.511
You can open up the workspace.

26
00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:43.430
You can set the settings
across all of them.

27
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.182
I don't do any of it, but
I took the notes in case you wanted to.

28
00:01:48.182 --> 00:01:52.419
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you have
instances where you have multiple

29
00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:57.223
windows with separate
workspaces concurrently?

30
00:01:57.223 --> 00:01:59.263
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Me personally
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I mean,

31
00:01:59.263 --> 00:02:02.427
it's a thing I've done but.

32
00:02:02.427 --> 00:02:05.033
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I mean,
it probably happens, right?

33
00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:10.847
I also am a pure front end team and
I'm spinning up like the backend,

34
00:02:10.847 --> 00:02:14.629
but I'm not developing
it at the same time.

35
00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.931
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Sure when you
mentioned micro front end,

36
00:02:17.931 --> 00:02:23.979
can you elaborate not to get you off
track, for the tiny bit more on example.

37
00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:29.499
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, like you will see
a lot of times at larger companies where

38
00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:36.707
there's a belief system that multiple
either front end teams don't wanna halt.

39
00:02:36.707 --> 00:02:41.963
If you're at a 1,000, when I was at
Twilio by the end it was 7,000 people,

40
00:02:41.963 --> 00:02:46.924
and obviously not all of them engineers
and not all of them front end engineers,

41
00:02:46.924 --> 00:02:50.271
but a lot 200 more than at
the company I work at now.

42
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:54.979
And a belief system all of those
people in one repo will become a mess.

43
00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:58.225
I will remind you that Google is one repo,
or was at some point,

44
00:02:58.225 --> 00:03:01.490
somebody's going to fact check
me like that is no longer true.

45
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.845
But last time I talked to one of
my friends that worked at Google,

46
00:03:04.845 --> 00:03:07.031
it was true, which was not that long ago.

47
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:11.526
So yeah, there's a lot of, well,
we need to all control our own destiny and

48
00:03:11.526 --> 00:03:15.182
then you end up trying to create
one cohesive UI experience out

49
00:03:15.182 --> 00:03:17.312
of what is effectively 72 repos.

50
00:03:17.312 --> 00:03:21.064
And you end up with 14 different
versions of React and you'll be well,

51
00:03:21.064 --> 00:03:25.203
you can use module federate, yeah you
can do lots of really complicated stuff.

52
00:03:25.203 --> 00:03:27.484
No one I've ever seen working
on it is happy about it.

53
00:03:27.484 --> 00:03:29.645
I cannot wait for the emails.

54
00:03:29.645 --> 00:03:31.559
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So you're a mono repo?

55
00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:33.951
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: 100% why did
I need more than one repo,

56
00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:36.353
more than one place to
open a pull request?

57
00:03:36.353 --> 00:03:41.777
In what world do I need a different
configuration for everything?

58
00:03:41.777 --> 00:03:45.198
No I am 100% on the give me one monorepo.

59
00:03:45.198 --> 00:03:46.576
I don't wanna deal with this anymore.

60
00:03:46.576 --> 00:03:51.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So the nice thing about that
monorepo across different projects is when

61
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.245
you upgrade packages,
they're always in sync.

62
00:03:54.245 --> 00:03:57.571
There's no lot of sync
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Microservices

63
00:03:57.571 --> 00:04:01.477
even on the back end exists to solve a
scaling problem but you lose all sorts of

64
00:04:01.477 --> 00:04:06.010
things like database transactions, shared
memory, it's a pain in the butt, right.

65
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.036
You do it when you have to do it and

66
00:04:07.036 --> 00:04:08.570
you shouldn't do it if
you don't have to do it.

67
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.058
I think most micro front-ends are
front-end engineers trying to cosplay as

68
00:04:13.058 --> 00:04:17.685
distributed systems engineers when that's
not actually the right solution to

69
00:04:17.685 --> 00:04:20.393
building a cohesive front-end experience.

70
00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:25.078
You can at me on Twitter,
I won't check it, so it's fine.

71
00:04:25.078 --> 00:04:28.202
I'm sorry, X, formerly known as Twitter.
