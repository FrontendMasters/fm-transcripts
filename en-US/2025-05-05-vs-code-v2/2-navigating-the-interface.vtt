00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.384
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's talk a little
bit about the rest of the editor, so

2
00:00:03.384 --> 00:00:06.918
we've got this explorer and
other activities over here.

3
00:00:06.918 --> 00:00:09.052
We have some other fun options,

4
00:00:09.052 --> 00:00:12.697
there is a panel down here
with more different things.

5
00:00:12.697 --> 00:00:16.250
Most notably, for
our purposes, 90% of the time,

6
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.034
is this integrated terminal,
which, for the most part,

7
00:00:20.034 --> 00:00:24.994
should be very much like the terminal
that you open Visual Studio Code from.

8
00:00:24.994 --> 00:00:27.885
But now you can be all in one place,
right?

9
00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:32.002
Because a lot of our day
to day lives are try thing,

10
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:36.329
maybe you have tests,
hopefully, you have tests.

11
00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.481
You don't have tests,
try things, go to browser,

12
00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:42.573
see if works, go back, so
on and so forth, right?

13
00:00:42.573 --> 00:00:45.527
And so the more that we can kinda
do without the context switching,

14
00:00:45.527 --> 00:00:48.023
the more micro decisions we
can make every day, right?

15
00:00:48.023 --> 00:00:53.225
A lot of times it is like it's going to
take me 100 attempts to get this right

16
00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:58.527
if I can cut down the time of each
attempt by 10, 20, 50%, guess what?

17
00:00:58.527 --> 00:01:00.590
I can make more decisions every day, and

18
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.903
all of a sudden I look
like a 10x developer.

19
00:01:02.903 --> 00:01:07.767
The real way to be a 10x developer is
multiple cursors, which we'll talk about

20
00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:12.290
later, but if you have 10 cursors,
you're clearly a 10x developer.

21
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.050
It scales, great, so
we've got this panel here, as you can see,

22
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.589
you can open and close that with this
little icon up here, same with this one.

23
00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:28.193
Then we have another bonus paddle
over here that you can assign

24
00:01:28.193 --> 00:01:33.379
different things in here as well,
hit this little plus.

25
00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:36.474
In this case, it's two of the extensions,

26
00:01:36.474 --> 00:01:39.830
I'm gonna tell you how
often I open this panel.

27
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.060
Never, I never open it,

28
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.531
I didn't even know it was in this
panel until I was preparing for this.

29
00:01:44.531 --> 00:01:48.092
So we've got that,
we've got this main editor here as well,

30
00:01:48.092 --> 00:01:51.186
there's some little information,
that's my doc.

31
00:01:51.186 --> 00:01:56.117
There is some information down here
about what language we are in,

32
00:01:56.117 --> 00:02:02.386
some other fun things, what line, what my
spacing is, so on and so forth, as well.

33
00:02:02.386 --> 00:02:07.693
And like most things, we can open up
more than one file, so we can go hit,

34
00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:12.309
we can click here now,
we've got two tabs, awesome, right?

35
00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:16.640
And we can hit, in this case,
Cmd+Shift and then a square bracket,

36
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.268
go back and forth between the two of them.

37
00:02:19.268 --> 00:02:23.696
We can also, if we need a little
more room, cuz we're on a 13 or

38
00:02:23.696 --> 00:02:27.879
14 inch MacBook, you can hit Cmd+B or
Ctrl+B, I think.

39
00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.285
I'm gonna be honest with you, I have not
used a Windows computer in 25 years,

40
00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:35.558
so some of those are from memory.

41
00:02:35.558 --> 00:02:40.346
But you know what happens if you
if I get one wrong, Cmd+Shift+P,

42
00:02:40.346 --> 00:02:42.199
and you can see what it is.

43
00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:47.128
Especially cuz over time you will write
your own key bindings and go on your

44
00:02:47.128 --> 00:02:52.075
own path, and there'll be none of
the default ones as we go along as well.

45
00:02:52.075 --> 00:02:56.005
So we can hide and show that as well,

46
00:02:56.005 --> 00:03:00.852
we can also split in two,
so we hit Cmd + \.

47
00:03:00.852 --> 00:03:04.697
We're all gonna find out who has
1Password installed at the same time,

48
00:03:04.697 --> 00:03:08.667
cuz that might be taken by 1Password,
at which point you just turn it off or

49
00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:10.703
change it either in 1Password here.

50
00:03:10.703 --> 00:03:15.971
You can split between two editors,
so you can see things side by side.

51
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:20.885
So yeah, these are some empty files
at this point that we can just

52
00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:24.980
play around in for
various different exercises, but

53
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.624
if I wanted to get from this left pane
to this right pane, how would I do it?

54
00:03:30.624 --> 00:03:32.258
It's a trick question, by the way.

55
00:03:32.258 --> 00:03:34.138
&gt;&gt; Audience: Use your mouse?

56
00:03:34.138 --> 00:03:37.504
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay, yes, that was not
the trick question answer that I was

57
00:03:37.504 --> 00:03:41.737
looking for, but I'm into it,
that's technically, you're not wrong.

58
00:03:41.737 --> 00:03:45.245
There's a few other ways to discover
these keyboard shortcuts, right?

59
00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:46.781
Cuz like I said, I can say them to you,

60
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:49.724
they are written down in some of
the notes that I shared in the beginning.

61
00:03:49.724 --> 00:03:52.088
You're not gonna memorize them at first,

62
00:03:52.088 --> 00:03:56.237
you're not gonna memorize them until
you do them 1000 times, right?

63
00:03:56.237 --> 00:04:00.506
So the first thing we'll do is figure out
what the discovery process is here, right?

64
00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:03.112
We know Cmd+Shift+P is one of them, right?

65
00:04:03.112 --> 00:04:08.260
So we can go like,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Close

66
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.318
editors in the left group,
that's interesting, right?

67
00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:16.291
Move editor group left, move the editor
left, so on and so forth, right?

68
00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:20.451
The other way to kind of discover some of
the options is to find out what's just

69
00:04:20.451 --> 00:04:21.795
hanging out in the menu.

70
00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:26.422
We saw that we can learn keyboard
shortcuts by hovering over stuff,

71
00:04:26.422 --> 00:04:29.113
we can also go ahead and switch editor.

72
00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:39.582
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Or switch group, because
I'm in the same file, why are these gray?

73
00:04:39.582 --> 00:04:43.231
Figure that in a second,
sometimes you have turn it off and

74
00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:48.018
turn it back on again, but I don't
think that's my issue, but we'll see.

75
00:04:48.018 --> 00:04:52.902
All right, so we've got the ability
to have various different panes.

76
00:04:52.902 --> 00:04:57.209
There are a whole bunch of different
layouts that you can use, for instance,

77
00:04:57.209 --> 00:05:01.134
like, I'm gonna take a moment and
find out why this is all grayed out.

78
00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:05.358
Because one would argue I got a window
open, apparently, turning it off and

79
00:05:05.358 --> 00:05:07.406
turning it back on was the solution.

80
00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:11.857
So if you find yourself live opening
your editor in front of people and

81
00:05:11.857 --> 00:05:14.314
things aren't working as expected,

82
00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:18.937
there's nothing as clear as turning
off and turning it back on, cool.

83
00:05:18.937 --> 00:05:23.795
So the important part here is to see some
of the options, cuz again, the patterns

84
00:05:23.795 --> 00:05:28.153
that I have to use to get around my code
base might not be the same as yours,

85
00:05:28.153 --> 00:05:28.661
right?

86
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:33.614
And we'll talk about all the various
flavors and stuff along those lines, but

87
00:05:33.614 --> 00:05:38.493
kinda, again, the practice of catching
yourself if you find yourself again

88
00:05:38.493 --> 00:05:41.520
clicking on this side or
clicking on that side.

89
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.203
Like, what would it be, right?

90
00:05:43.203 --> 00:05:48.344
And so we've got Switch Editor,
and we've got Switch Group, right?

91
00:05:48.344 --> 00:05:51.183
An editor is any given one of these tabs,

92
00:05:51.183 --> 00:05:54.868
a group is like any given
one of these panes, right?

93
00:05:54.868 --> 00:05:59.684
And so we can see that if I hit Cmd+2,
I jump over to the second pane here,

94
00:05:59.684 --> 00:06:02.815
you can see my cursor is
flashing at this point.

95
00:06:02.815 --> 00:06:08.062
1, I'm back over here, 2,
1, 2, 1, you can go ahead,

96
00:06:08.062 --> 00:06:13.032
and you can see that you've
got lots of different layouts.

97
00:06:13.032 --> 00:06:16.588
You can go,
some of these are more appropriate for

98
00:06:16.588 --> 00:06:19.730
the 27 inch studio display I have at home.

99
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.954
But if we wanted to,
we could go to a four by four grid,

100
00:06:22.954 --> 00:06:25.775
we can see that there's
no actual files here.

101
00:06:25.775 --> 00:06:29.269
If you need to move an editor,
you have a few choices, right?

102
00:06:29.269 --> 00:06:33.585
You could learn the keyboard shortcut, but
I'm gonna stop harassing you about that

103
00:06:33.585 --> 00:06:36.761
for a moment, you can also drag
a tab over and move it, right?

104
00:06:36.761 --> 00:06:42.988
I'm gonna be honest with you,
I do it a lot, [LAUGH] right?

105
00:06:42.988 --> 00:06:47.136
Again, my trackpad is not that far, so

106
00:06:47.136 --> 00:06:51.428
you can drag various files over as well.

107
00:06:51.428 --> 00:06:54.468
And now you can do a 1, 2, 3, 4 and

108
00:06:54.468 --> 00:07:00.270
jump around just like that to open
a fifth one, I don't need a fifth one.

109
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.441
The other option, if we go in here and
check it out as well.

110
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:07.658
Is more likely you can kind of either
go to the next to previous group,

111
00:07:07.658 --> 00:07:12.474
which does not have one, or you can do
like a group to left, group to the right.

112
00:07:17.005 --> 00:07:18.640
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
this one will actually move it and

113
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.239
stuff along those lines as well,
like I said, some of it.

114
00:07:21.239 --> 00:07:25.659
This is obviously at this point
a very complicated setup, but

115
00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:31.619
generally speaking, again, finding,
you will not memorize them all in one hit.

116
00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:35.288
Find them kinda get into the flow when
you see yourself trying to do something,

117
00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.409
those are the patterns
you want to optimize.

118
00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:42.101
Memorizing literally everything I yell
at you is probably not the way forward.

119
00:07:42.101 --> 00:07:44.891
But to know where the options are and
what you can do and

120
00:07:44.891 --> 00:07:49.045
the idea that sometimes half the battle is
knowing that you can just jump back and

121
00:07:49.045 --> 00:07:51.403
forth between the different panes, right?

122
00:07:51.403 --> 00:07:55.107
And there's a few other options there
is like going back and forward.

123
00:07:55.107 --> 00:08:00.122
The other ones that are super useful
is we've got Cmd+P, which looks

124
00:08:00.122 --> 00:08:05.996
like a command palette, but you'll notice
something slightly different here.

125
00:08:05.996 --> 00:08:10.362
In this case, it is files, and you can
search for any file in your code base.

126
00:08:10.362 --> 00:08:15.578
You start typing in like package JSON
you'll see something along the lines

127
00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:20.890
of all the package JSON's in your project
and the ability to pick which one.
