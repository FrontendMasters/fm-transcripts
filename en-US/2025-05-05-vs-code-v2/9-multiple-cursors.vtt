00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.237
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The other really powerful
thing in VS Code that I use, honestly,

2
00:00:05.237 --> 00:00:10.776
every day, all the time, too often,
is multiple cursors, right?

3
00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:15.462
Multiple cursors does
what you think it does.

4
00:00:15.462 --> 00:00:18.851
There's a bunch of ways
to use multiple cursors.

5
00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:26.376
One is Hold down the option or
Alt key and start clicking.

6
00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:31.066
Now, I have multiple cursors.

7
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:34.932
You will learn something very quickly,
though.

8
00:00:34.932 --> 00:00:40.452
Your aim is terrible, [LAUGH] right?

9
00:00:40.452 --> 00:00:42.774
So what do you do when
your aim is terrible?

10
00:00:42.774 --> 00:00:44.843
So let's say I was hitting Alt.

11
00:00:44.843 --> 00:00:50.935
The nice part about my font being
gigantic right now is my aim is great.

12
00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:55.896
But on a normal font size, on a normal
size monitor, with a trackball,

13
00:00:55.896 --> 00:00:57.314
my aim is terrible.

14
00:00:57.314 --> 00:01:00.371
So let's say we start with one here.

15
00:01:00.371 --> 00:01:04.138
I put another one and then whoops,
I missed the @ symbol.

16
00:01:04.138 --> 00:01:10.646
All right, so command or I think Ctrl+u
will remove the last one, right?

17
00:01:10.646 --> 00:01:12.495
That's good, that's great.

18
00:01:12.495 --> 00:01:17.486
But ultimately, you're never going to
click on all the things that you want,

19
00:01:17.486 --> 00:01:18.024
right?

20
00:01:18.024 --> 00:01:20.769
So let's say hypothetically,

21
00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:25.446
I wanted to take all of these
function declarations and

22
00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:29.929
I wanted to turn them into
arrow functions, right?

23
00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.491
I could do this.

24
00:01:36.727 --> 00:01:39.187
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
I can find the next one.

25
00:01:39.187 --> 00:01:40.394
I'm not doing this.

26
00:01:40.394 --> 00:01:42.641
I can't live like this.

27
00:01:42.641 --> 00:01:47.601
The other option is you can
select something, right?

28
00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:52.853
In this case export, but
let's say export function and

29
00:01:52.853 --> 00:01:57.107
then hit Cmd+d and
it will grab the next one.

30
00:01:57.107 --> 00:02:00.242
And you can hit Command D again and
it will grab the next one.

31
00:02:00.242 --> 00:02:03.360
Do that enough, and you can see it
actually filled out the search thing,

32
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.655
which we'll see in a second.

33
00:02:04.655 --> 00:02:09.752
And now I've got all of the export
functions selected with multiple cursors.

34
00:02:09.752 --> 00:02:12.622
Now, I can do something like this.

35
00:02:12.622 --> 00:02:15.519
You'll notice that I
have done this before.

36
00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.888
Const.

37
00:02:21.297 --> 00:02:23.111
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There we go.

38
00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:27.310
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And if we scroll down,

39
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.035
my multiple cursors all worked
on their given line, and

40
00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:35.967
I just changed all of these function
declarations into arrow functions.

41
00:02:35.967 --> 00:02:41.602
Useful a lot of times we
are cleaning up text, right?

42
00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:45.332
Or trying to find all your console logs,
right?

43
00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:46.720
So delete them, right?

44
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.596
Could you've gotten really fancy with
a Regex in the search and replace?

45
00:02:50.596 --> 00:02:52.605
Yes, you could have.

46
00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:53.904
Are you going to?

47
00:02:53.904 --> 00:02:57.666
No, it's better,
it's easier to find one console log and

48
00:02:57.666 --> 00:03:02.492
slam on Command D until you have all of
them and select the line and delete it.

49
00:03:02.492 --> 00:03:05.771
So that will work.

50
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:10.251
The other thing that you can do that
you will know it when you need it, is,

51
00:03:10.251 --> 00:03:14.512
this is one of the things I've done
from muscle memory so many times,

52
00:03:14.512 --> 00:03:18.857
I gotta think about it, is, so
on a Mac, it's Cmd+Option+Arrow.

53
00:03:18.857 --> 00:03:23.709
You can just Start putting cursors up and
down, right?

54
00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:24.496
And grab them.

55
00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:29.409
That's nice if you've got a bunch
of stuff in a given CSV or

56
00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.028
something along those lines.

57
00:03:32.028 --> 00:03:35.407
The one that I have never used in my life.

58
00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:40.923
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I literally
don't even remember how to do it.

59
00:03:40.923 --> 00:03:45.756
Is there is some way to select a square?

60
00:03:45.756 --> 00:03:48.198
I don't know why you'd want to.

61
00:03:48.198 --> 00:03:50.029
Maybe a marked, I don't know.

62
00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.863
I can't even come up with a hypothetical
reason why you would do it.

63
00:03:53.863 --> 00:03:57.879
I have it in my notes, but literally,
you could do it in TextMate too.

64
00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.474
I just have never wanted to do it.

65
00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:04.269
Shift Option.

66
00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.893
I'm hitting if you don't hit
the right key while you're talking,

67
00:04:08.893 --> 00:04:13.031
nothing works if you if you think
shift option really hard and

68
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:16.459
you hit control shift,
it doesn't do the thing.

69
00:04:18.182 --> 00:04:23.954
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So you can see,
I can grab an area with multiple cursors.

70
00:04:23.954 --> 00:04:27.584
Yes, that is the appropriate reaction of,
why would you want to do that?

71
00:04:27.584 --> 00:04:28.906
I don't know.

72
00:04:28.906 --> 00:04:33.675
I don't know why you would
want to do that, but you can.

73
00:04:33.675 --> 00:04:35.262
I couldn't even remember how to do it,

74
00:04:35.262 --> 00:04:37.148
because I don't know why
I would want to do it.

75
00:04:37.148 --> 00:04:38.950
I've never done it before my life.

76
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.322
Maybe somebody could be like,
I needed that and I provided a service.

77
00:04:44.322 --> 00:04:46.351
Beyond that,
I don't know why you would wanna do it.

78
00:04:46.351 --> 00:04:49.089
The other one that you can do it,

79
00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:53.050
I actually made this its
own page in the notes.

80
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.638
This was a month ago
when I was gonna lose it.

81
00:04:58.638 --> 00:05:00.240
Which is.

82
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:06.948
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Export const, and let's
give it some kind of regex in this case.

83
00:05:06.948 --> 00:05:08.774
We'll say.

84
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:15.521
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If you hit hold option or
Alt and hit Enter,

85
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:19.594
you will get multiple cursors on
everything that matches the regex.

86
00:05:19.594 --> 00:05:21.823
Right, so you don't even
have to have the exact word.

87
00:05:21.823 --> 00:05:23.957
You can have roughly a pattern.

88
00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:26.618
If you hold option or
alt while you hit enter,

89
00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:30.975
you will now get multiple cursors on
everything that matches that regex.

90
00:05:30.975 --> 00:05:35.069
Which is useful, let's say some
of these had three arguments and

91
00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:37.606
I wanted to still match the entire line.

92
00:05:37.606 --> 00:05:39.864
I could get fancy with the regex and
I could do it.

93
00:05:39.864 --> 00:05:42.503
When did I need this?

94
00:05:42.503 --> 00:05:48.022
Sometimes numbers have one digit and
sometimes they have two digits.

95
00:05:48.022 --> 00:05:51.374
I needed both, all right.

96
00:05:51.374 --> 00:05:55.136
That's the very esoteric
use case that I had.

97
00:05:55.136 --> 00:05:58.690
But again, the idea that you can
just have multiple cursors and

98
00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.995
it's a little bit of a dance
that you get good at over time.

99
00:06:01.995 --> 00:06:06.883
Where I can refactor like large
swaths of things just by kind of like

100
00:06:06.883 --> 00:06:10.565
being nimble with the multiple cursors,
right?

101
00:06:10.565 --> 00:06:13.251
And change especially if it is, again,

102
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:17.367
a big JavaScript object with
a lot of the same fields, right?

103
00:06:17.367 --> 00:06:18.656
You grab the one field.

104
00:06:18.656 --> 00:06:21.987
You Command D to your heart's content,
grab all of them, and

105
00:06:21.987 --> 00:06:25.319
then you can theoretically trim
the white space off the line,

106
00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:28.868
or wrap them all in an arrow function,
or whatever you need to do.

107
00:06:28.868 --> 00:06:32.505
Anything that you find yourself
doing tediously, again,

108
00:06:32.505 --> 00:06:37.466
stop, pause, reflect, realize that
there's probably an easier way to do it.
