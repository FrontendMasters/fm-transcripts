00:00:00.213 --> 00:00:02.923
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So, yeah, we've got the
placeholders, we know how to do options,

2
00:00:02.923 --> 00:00:04.204
we know how to do nested syntax.

3
00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:09.324
This you will fight with every time,
I've never not fought with this.““¡” But

4
00:00:09.324 --> 00:00:12.943
it's really great for
common patterns that you might use.

5
00:00:12.943 --> 00:00:16.529
I think if you're using a design
system where everything's got a very

6
00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.992
structured layout, there's some other
methodologies to lay out that boilerplate.

7
00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:25.474
It's like just having some like template
files that you just rewrite and

8
00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:27.687
write in there, that works, too.

9
00:00:27.687 --> 00:00:34.122
There's lots of different ways to do this,
but if you find yourself like, okay,

10
00:00:34.122 --> 00:00:40.683
I have a design system where the component
name is button, it's got button props.

11
00:00:40.683 --> 00:00:44.914
That extends from the HTML button element,
right?

12
00:00:44.914 --> 00:00:48.562
You can get a lot of that boil plate,
yeah, you'll spend, like, honestly,

13
00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:50.017
an hour getting that snippet.

14
00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:55.837
And then you gotta remember to use it,
which is a different story for

15
00:00:55.837 --> 00:01:00.036
a different day, but
I think equally as useful.

16
00:01:00.036 --> 00:01:03.150
Let's just do the one more
with the selected text, and

17
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.998
I got some challenges for
you to play around with.

18
00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:09.908
But let's just look at what I was talking
about earlier with selected text.

19
00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:15.639
Sure, let's take that one, and
at this point, we're gonna say.

20
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.311
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Did I have to try to,

21
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:28.231
trying to remember.

22
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:35.018
$TM_SELECTED_TEXT, doing that from memory.

23
00:01:35.018 --> 00:01:38.089
You will never write enough of these that
you remember any of this, by the way.

24
00:01:38.089 --> 00:01:42.243
You will do one morning where you feel
like you now have mastered this, and

25
00:01:42.243 --> 00:01:46.196
then it will leak out your head,
you will start over fresh every time,

26
00:01:46.196 --> 00:01:47.542
maybe you're better.

27
00:01:47.542 --> 00:01:50.618
If you get good at this,
I got bigger questions for you,

28
00:01:50.618 --> 00:01:53.311
which is like,
what should you have been doing?

29
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:59.574
So here we can say hello, put it in
a string and now hopefully I do log, and

30
00:01:59.574 --> 00:02:06.793
you can see that it took the selected text
automatically and put it in a console log.

31
00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:12.645
Where I use it the most is,
you know that in an async away function,

32
00:02:12.645 --> 00:02:17.153
you're supposed to put the fetch in a try,
catch.

33
00:02:17.153 --> 00:02:20.049
Who does that the first time?

34
00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.617
Nobody, right?

35
00:02:22.617 --> 00:02:28.472
So, now I can just literally like
select the fetch statement, right?

36
00:02:28.472 --> 00:02:32.876
Try catch hit tab and
fix my mistakes, right?

37
00:02:32.876 --> 00:02:37.468
And have prettier fix the formatting for
me usually.

38
00:02:37.468 --> 00:02:41.861
And again, yeah, there are extensions
that have a bunch of snippets,

39
00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:43.850
you should probably use those.

40
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.805
Honestly, just use them for inspiration,
because you can also just open up those

41
00:02:47.805 --> 00:02:50.404
files and see what they are and
grab the ones you like.

42
00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:53.251
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Could you show one more
time how you have selected text and

43
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:54.087
then type that.

44
00:02:54.087 --> 00:02:59.738
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, let's look at the
snippet and I'll show you doing it again.

45
00:02:59.738 --> 00:03:04.461
So, as you can see, I could have put
something like value in here, and

46
00:03:04.461 --> 00:03:08.160
then the default thing would
have been value, right?

47
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.642
In this case we've got $TM_SELECTED_TEXT.

48
00:03:12.642 --> 00:03:15.022
To be clear, the fact that this works and

49
00:03:15.022 --> 00:03:19.222
it knows what I had selected before
I started typing, wild me, right?

50
00:03:19.222 --> 00:03:22.930
At one point too, it's like one of those
things which I've done a million times,

51
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.097
but I had to look it up and double check
before I told any of you about it,

52
00:03:26.097 --> 00:03:28.759
because I'm like that doesn't
seem like it should work.

53
00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:34.656
But yeah, so in this case, we'll say
that the first value is SELECTED_TEXT,

54
00:03:34.656 --> 00:03:37.126
and we'll go back into this one.

55
00:03:37.126 --> 00:03:41.475
So here we got,
let's say we have 1234, why not?

56
00:03:41.475 --> 00:03:47.016
We select it, and
now it's in there, right?

57
00:03:47.016 --> 00:03:51.188
And again, with console log, cool,
I guess, I mean, I honestly worth it.

58
00:03:51.188 --> 00:03:55.736
But if you wanna put in a conditional,
a try catch, something else,

59
00:03:55.736 --> 00:04:01.083
you can also just kind of, like it's all
gonna depend on your code base, right?

60
00:04:01.083 --> 00:04:06.281
But it's nice if it's angular component
that has a bunch of decorators on it or

61
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:07.084
whatever.

62
00:04:07.084 --> 00:04:12.009
Or that you always want this to extend
from a class to extend from a certain

63
00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:17.775
object, you can kind of create the ones
that you find yourselves repeatedly doing.

64
00:04:17.775 --> 00:04:23.209
The other one just to show you a quick
before we happen to the exercises

65
00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:28.001
is obviously, we know the other
one was CLIPBOARD, right?

66
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:31.961
So here I will just copy
something onto my clipboard.

67
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:35.298
And here we'll do this now, and

68
00:04:35.298 --> 00:04:39.877
it is whatever was in my clipboard, right?

69
00:04:39.877 --> 00:04:43.442
Fine, great, again, easy ways to
create stuff for yourself, yeah.

70
00:04:43.442 --> 00:04:48.388
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Those environment variables
are the ones that are in capitals

71
00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:50.954
that come with, yeah, those,

72
00:04:50.954 --> 00:04:55.918
they're not available to you
unless you are using a snippet.

73
00:04:55.918 --> 00:05:01.413
You can't just plug into a regular

74
00:05:01.413 --> 00:05:06.158
component to start using it.

75
00:05:06.158 --> 00:05:09.877
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: No, so I think, if I'm
not mistaken, I have to look this up,

76
00:05:09.877 --> 00:05:14.767
I'll look it up, I think you can also
grab environment variables too, though.

77
00:05:14.767 --> 00:05:19.206
Yeah, I believe it's something like $env.

78
00:05:19.206 --> 00:05:22.503
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Well, when you were
showing the current file path and

79
00:05:22.503 --> 00:05:25.878
selected the file,
that could be very useful.

80
00:05:25.878 --> 00:05:31.765
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Those are the ones I use,
yeah, the most, occasionally I use,

81
00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:36.678
if I want the date and that,
yyd, that's a nice one.

82
00:05:36.678 --> 00:05:41.548
Usually when I'm doing markdown, I'll
do that because it's like the date for

83
00:05:41.548 --> 00:05:44.681
the notes,
you just wanna pop in there real quick.

84
00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:51.363
But yeah, going back to that first
file that has the list, right?

85
00:05:51.363 --> 00:05:55.241
Yeah, I don't use these so
much, but again,

86
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:58.523
if it's a folder with the component and

87
00:05:58.523 --> 00:06:04.207
you want it to be named as the folder,
you can use $TM_DIRECTORY.

88
00:06:04.207 --> 00:06:07.536
If it is the file name that you want
to base it off of it you can use,

89
00:06:07.536 --> 00:06:10.559
and again, you can Pascal case it,
you can Kebab case it,

90
00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:12.938
you can uppercase it,
you can lowercase it.

91
00:06:12.938 --> 00:06:17.872
There's a bunch in there as well, and
so some of these folder ones, again,

92
00:06:17.872 --> 00:06:22.264
then CLIPBOARD and SELECTED_TEXT
are the ones that I use the most,

93
00:06:22.264 --> 00:06:23.979
the rest of them I don't.
