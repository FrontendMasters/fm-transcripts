00:00:00.058 --> 00:00:03.754
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: From just the bare
minimum of the productivity

2
00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:07.639
gains of navigating around
different files, or

3
00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.348
jumping from where is
that function defined.

4
00:00:11.348 --> 00:00:15.239
Or what is the type of this thing,
so on and

5
00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:19.810
so forth or
those again hitting f2 to refactor.

6
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.954
Huge, right?
Those little, or

7
00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:25.703
just jumping from editor to editor so
you're not sitting there stopping mouse.

8
00:00:25.703 --> 00:00:30.237
There's something about the first time you
try to do that keystroke to jump from one

9
00:00:30.237 --> 00:00:32.973
editor group to the other one,
it's gonna hurt.

10
00:00:32.973 --> 00:00:36.122
The 77th time you do it,
it's gonna be muscle memory.

11
00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:39.989
The next thing you know, you're not
thinking about it anymore, right?

12
00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.624
All the way to getting a consistent
development environment.

13
00:00:43.624 --> 00:00:48.543
If you are in one of those camps where you
are either working on different projects

14
00:00:48.543 --> 00:00:51.668
or you need consistency across your team,
right?

15
00:00:51.668 --> 00:00:53.025
To figuring out, again,

16
00:00:53.025 --> 00:00:56.799
there was some controversy on whether
we'd want to run the tests or not.

17
00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.954
It's super useful with these
VS Codeextensions very useful with

18
00:01:00.954 --> 00:01:04.882
an electron app, maybe,
if you're just running npm start,

19
00:01:04.882 --> 00:01:08.143
not the most important thing in the world,
right?

20
00:01:08.143 --> 00:01:13.106
But the idea is, like for whatever the
things in your like development workflow

21
00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:16.957
that are causing that friction
that is just slowing you down,

22
00:01:16.957 --> 00:01:18.902
imperceptibly slow, right?

23
00:01:18.902 --> 00:01:21.995
Snippets to just have
those common patterns so

24
00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:24.701
you're not doing those things by hand.

25
00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:28.119
If things speed you up 5%,
cumulatively over a year,

26
00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.276
you're saving probably a week,
two weeks, three weeks, right?

27
00:01:32.276 --> 00:01:34.947
And all of a sudden you're a hero, right?

28
00:01:34.947 --> 00:01:38.341
Not because you're any
smarter than anyone else.

29
00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:41.019
You will tell everyone
you're smarter than them.

30
00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:43.587
People will believe that
you're smarter than them.

31
00:01:43.587 --> 00:01:48.400
But honestly, it's because you have
a try catch block that has a conditional

32
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.114
break point or something.

33
00:01:50.114 --> 00:01:50.791
You know what I mean?

34
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:54.969
And l those things that were tedious and
took a long time are now faster for you.

35
00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.074
Who's making like,
what are we going to do?

36
00:01:57.074 --> 00:01:58.398
We got pets, we got Pokemon.

37
00:01:58.398 --> 00:02:00.347
Come on, what's next?

38
00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.651
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I want an actual
Tamagotchi that I have to take care of and

39
00:02:06.651 --> 00:02:09.271
I or Digimon, I have it fight.

40
00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:11.564
Right, Mike Tyson, Doom.

41
00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:14.953
Someone put doom in a VS code extension.

42
00:02:14.953 --> 00:02:17.071
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It probably is all right.

43
00:02:17.071 --> 00:02:18.377
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: One moment, please.

44
00:02:18.377 --> 00:02:25.972
Is, yep, no, doom, no, that looks these.

45
00:02:25.972 --> 00:02:31.447
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That shows
up under one review.

46
00:02:31.447 --> 00:02:39.572
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Because if
something exists that it runs doom.

47
00:02:39.572 --> 00:02:44.530
You know this is gonna be high quality.

48
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.999
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yep, delicious.

49
00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:46.881
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right.

50
00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:58.033
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Hold on,
something's happening.

51
00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:00.029
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There you go.

52
00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:01.588
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's a good play?

53
00:03:01.588 --> 00:03:06.204
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: [LAUGH] I didn't
pay attention to the instructions.

54
00:03:06.204 --> 00:03:07.019
To shoot.

55
00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.271
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, all right.

56
00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:08.792
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: No way.

57
00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:13.628
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I occurs to me that I
have not played doom in 30 years, and

58
00:03:13.628 --> 00:03:19.771
I don't know what I'm doing but anyway,
you can put doom in your editor.

59
00:03:19.771 --> 00:03:22.688
Vim, your move.

60
00:03:22.688 --> 00:03:25.731
Emacs, let's go.

61
00:03:25.731 --> 00:03:28.598
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
