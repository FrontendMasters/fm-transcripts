00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.173
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There are some exercises
here, do I expect you to do all of them?

2
00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:09.497
I do not, there are some where
I kinda lead you to water, and

3
00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:12.768
there are some where its you
gotta figure it out yourself.

4
00:00:12.768 --> 00:00:15.487
The ones you gotta figure out
yourself are a little bit easier.

5
00:00:15.487 --> 00:00:17.847
But play around with it, try it out.

6
00:00:17.847 --> 00:00:21.047
Try out some of the different
techniques we've seen so far.

7
00:00:21.047 --> 00:00:22.186
We're gonna do this challenge.

8
00:00:22.186 --> 00:00:28.112
There's a bunch of guided practices
followed by some ones you do on your own,

9
00:00:28.112 --> 00:00:31.039
but give it a shot and get a feel for it.

10
00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.579
Again, the more complicated it is,
the probably less useful it is.

11
00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.648
So if you just get the simple use cases
down, that is probably good enough.

12
00:00:39.648 --> 00:00:44.223
I think that putting Emmett Master
on your resume is not

13
00:00:44.223 --> 00:00:48.906
gonna get you through
the recruiter screen any faster.

14
00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:52.830
So as much as is helpful, get a feel for
it, try out some of these, and

15
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.792
then we'll look at some extensions,
all our favorite extensions.

16
00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.297
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So let's through,
obviously, for some of those exercises,

17
00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:05.623
the answer was in there.

18
00:01:05.623 --> 00:01:09.023
For the other ones,
choose your own adventure.

19
00:01:09.023 --> 00:01:12.890
So let's look at some possible solutions,
there might be more than one way to go

20
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.773
about doing it, and I'll show you one
more bonus Emmett trick because why not?

21
00:01:16.773 --> 00:01:22.144
So for the first one, I have a basic
paragraph with some text in it and

22
00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:27.154
we can argue of, or for
the very small ones, are they worth it?

23
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:35.375
He says as he talks, so
if you put the text in curly braces,

24
00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:37.625
that becomes the inner part.

25
00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:42.152
Not that impressive at this point,
but if we did something like p, and

26
00:01:42.152 --> 00:01:47.400
then the class was,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Summary, and

27
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.928
then we could say we can get
the class in there automatically,

28
00:01:52.928 --> 00:01:59.215
the other thing we can do is then
also insert mouse-up as a second one.

29
00:01:59.215 --> 00:02:02.534
We can do ul with the li that
you saw me doing earlier.

30
00:02:02.534 --> 00:02:07.197
Let's put the word item in there,
but I want three of those,

31
00:02:07.197 --> 00:02:10.868
right, and
I'll get all of that text in there.

32
00:02:10.868 --> 00:02:15.580
Other ones, again, mostly just to get
a feel for it, we can see this one,

33
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.326
how many characters am I actually saving?

34
00:02:18.326 --> 00:02:19.390
Not that many.

35
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.639
Image.png for this third one,
and if we did a second

36
00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:29.661
attribute, it kinda looks
something like this.

37
00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:34.206
Again, for that one,
did I necessarily save myself a ton?

38
00:02:34.206 --> 00:02:39.283
But theoretically, if I did image and
I said, I don't know, icon, and

39
00:02:39.283 --> 00:02:44.611
I did it times 3, obviously, you get
something a little more useful here,

40
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:47.795
where I get three of them,
so on and so forth.

41
00:02:47.795 --> 00:02:52.334
The other thing you can do is let's
finish with the actual solutions

42
00:02:52.334 --> 00:02:54.492
before I go into bonus content.

43
00:02:54.492 --> 00:03:00.482
Easily distractible, as we can see,
we saw with the nested structure.

44
00:03:00.482 --> 00:03:06.700
And you could build out entire
components that way, so on and so forth.

45
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.490
The other ones that we can
do that are kind of useful

46
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.068
is you can get some lorem ipsum as well,
right?

47
00:03:16.068 --> 00:03:21.666
So we could do something like, let's
do for this last one, we'll do header.

48
00:03:21.666 --> 00:03:26.144
And then we'll say that's got a nav and
it's got a ul and

49
00:03:26.144 --> 00:03:31.301
that's got an li times 3,
that will give me that whole layout.

50
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:35.467
The other thing you can do,
though, is something like a div,

51
00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:40.435
I can do lorem, and I give it how many
words I want, and I will get some lorem

52
00:03:40.435 --> 00:03:45.516
ipsum in there of 10 different things,
or 10 different words rather.

53
00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:48.138
And so
if you need to fill out an entire thing,

54
00:03:48.138 --> 00:03:51.450
cuz maybe you don't have
the data from the backend yet and

55
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.935
you're just trying to get the layout down,
you can have some content without

56
00:03:55.935 --> 00:04:00.441
Googling whatever lorem ipsum generator
that I was Googling for 20 years.

57
00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:03.892
You know the one I'm talking about,
it's like lipsome, I don't know.

58
00:04:03.892 --> 00:04:07.230
But now, I don't do that anymore,
so I don't remember what it is,

59
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.113
because I can just type that in Emmett and
VS Code for free and get some layouts.

60
00:04:11.113 --> 00:04:16.861
The other thing you can do is you
can do something like item and

61
00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:20.917
then the $ will be a placeholder times 5,

62
00:04:20.917 --> 00:04:25.215
you'll get items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

63
00:04:25.215 --> 00:04:30.352
Little stuff like that, usually very
useful for placeholder stuff or

64
00:04:30.352 --> 00:04:35.489
scoping out the basics of a component or
something along those lines,

65
00:04:35.489 --> 00:04:39.947
but nice for kind of just getting
some stuff really quickly.

66
00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:45.817
Cuz a lot of times, that stuff can be
a little bit tedious, especially for

67
00:04:45.817 --> 00:04:51.879
nested things where you might have a bunch
of siblings and stuff like that and

68
00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:57.086
classes, so on and so forth to be
able to kind of just get something

69
00:04:57.086 --> 00:05:03.180
very quickly with not real CSS, but
CSS dyntax is somewhat helpful as well.
