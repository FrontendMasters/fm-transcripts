00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.788
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There are settings.

2
00:00:01.788 --> 00:00:03.665
There are a lot of settings.

3
00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:07.800
The easiest way to find the settings
is Command P on a Mac, or

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.542
I think it's Control+p,
I don't know, Windows.

5
00:00:11.542 --> 00:00:17.839
I can't even see them unless I go to my
own notes, which feels like a little much.

6
00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:19.962
The other way, of course, is.

7
00:00:22.628 --> 00:00:27.664
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: To open your settings
right with the command palette when in

8
00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:34.326
doubt, as one could scroll this and see
that there are a lot of settings right.

9
00:00:34.326 --> 00:00:39.152
And that's great and wonderful.

10
00:00:39.152 --> 00:00:40.196
You can usually find.

11
00:00:40.196 --> 00:00:44.334
What I would probably do is search for
whatever we're looking for.

12
00:00:44.334 --> 00:00:48.091
If you're trying to change the font size,
you probably know what you're looking for,

13
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:48.914
so on and so forth.

14
00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:53.885
I think it's somewhat worth a tour at
some point to go through all of them.

15
00:00:53.885 --> 00:00:59.721
That said, most of the sensible deep
faults are sensible and seem good.

16
00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:03.032
Things I wanna point out though, as we
kind of alleged with the extensions as

17
00:01:03.032 --> 00:01:04.960
well, is you've got your user extension.

18
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.775
So you've got the global extensions.

19
00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:09.710
These are the ones that are like
the system defaults and

20
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.816
you can see those at any point.

21
00:01:10.816 --> 00:01:13.806
And there's a reason why you'd want to,
we'll do that in a second.

22
00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:17.894
Then you've got your user settings, which
are your key bindings, your settings,

23
00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:19.404
right, which override that.

24
00:01:19.404 --> 00:01:24.104
And then you can set workspace
specific for a given project, and

25
00:01:24.104 --> 00:01:26.200
those will override yours.

26
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.663
Now, this enters the greatest
debate of all time.

27
00:01:31.663 --> 00:01:35.017
Do you check that into version control?

28
00:01:35.017 --> 00:01:37.143
The answer is it depends, right?

29
00:01:37.143 --> 00:01:39.448
If there are a bunch of settings for For

30
00:01:39.448 --> 00:01:43.566
that project you want everyone to
be on the same page for, then yes.

31
00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:45.765
The problem is on a workspace settings,

32
00:01:45.765 --> 00:01:48.170
it's not like you can
have two sets of them.

33
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.513
So it's either we're all doing this,
or we're all not doing it.

34
00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:57.555
And I think there's,
in terms of stuff like tab size and

35
00:01:57.555 --> 00:02:00.315
stuff like that maybe it makes sense.

36
00:02:00.315 --> 00:02:05.685
You can argue, just use prettier and
who cares, or editor config.

37
00:02:05.685 --> 00:02:08.457
It's I could go either way but yeah,

38
00:02:08.457 --> 00:02:12.494
the big question is not a should you or
should you not.

39
00:02:12.494 --> 00:02:15.424
It is a kind of a team decision, right?

40
00:02:15.424 --> 00:02:20.750
Because the problem is, a lot of cases,
you can make arguments especially for

41
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.232
a lot of the editor settings
on why that's useful.

42
00:02:24.232 --> 00:02:29.893
On the other hand, all it takes is
one person putting their silliest

43
00:02:29.893 --> 00:02:36.470
setting into version control, and
now you have everyone's setting, yeah.

44
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.936
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Obviously people have
different color preferences and

45
00:02:40.936 --> 00:02:47.026
brightness preferences and different
font size preferences and all that.

46
00:02:47.026 --> 00:02:50.850
But is that something, if you wanted to
do, you could put in get ignore or not?

47
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.970
Put in, get ignore.

48
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.925
Does that even matter?

49
00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:55.842
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You doing it?

50
00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:59.448
Get ignore, but yeah, then nobody
gets it right and for font size is

51
00:02:59.448 --> 00:03:03.451
a personal thing, but stuff for
what files we wannna exclude from search?

52
00:03:03.451 --> 00:03:04.112
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.

53
00:03:04.112 --> 00:03:05.050
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right?

54
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.042
And so that's a trickier one.

55
00:03:06.042 --> 00:03:08.731
Now, everyone either needs to set
that setting because it's not in

56
00:03:08.731 --> 00:03:11.577
Version Control, or you put in
version control, you know what I mean?

57
00:03:11.577 --> 00:03:15.566
And so, it's some settings, you can
definitely see a world where everyone

58
00:03:15.566 --> 00:03:19.614
would want them if it's like hey,
in this repo, there's a whole bunch of CSV

59
00:03:19.614 --> 00:03:22.753
files full of data that I never
want to navigate to, right?

60
00:03:22.753 --> 00:03:27.036
I want them excluded from search and
I want them excluded from everything else.

61
00:03:27.036 --> 00:03:30.519
You can see a world where everyone wants
that setting, but in terms of you have

62
00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.908
your peacock color for that workspace,
I don't want your bright yellow.

63
00:03:33.908 --> 00:03:34.756
You know what I mean?

64
00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:35.629
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

65
00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.684
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's tricky,
yeah, it's a trade off.

66
00:03:39.684 --> 00:03:44.316
I don't have a necessarily, right answer
in any way, shape or form, right?

67
00:03:44.316 --> 00:03:49.375
What's usually useful too is,
as you can see,

68
00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:54.814
all of your extensions also
have settings as well,

69
00:03:54.814 --> 00:04:01.024
and so yeah,
languages where Emmett should be expanded.

70
00:04:01.024 --> 00:04:04.467
Included languages where you put
in stuff like if you use view and

71
00:04:04.467 --> 00:04:08.251
you want it supported in there,
maybe it doesn't do that by default.

72
00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:13.784
Maybe you have you also have handlebars
and you want them support in there.

73
00:04:13.784 --> 00:04:17.471
That's just what we saw like
what the keyboard bindings,

74
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:20.716
hey only work in the editor
focus this type of file.

75
00:04:20.716 --> 00:04:25.240
You're basically doing the same for
Emmett in this case, so on and so

76
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.360
forth, depending on what
the given plugin is,

77
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.413
things that you might want to tweak or
change.

78
00:04:31.413 --> 00:04:33.427
And some of these
are the built in extensions.

79
00:04:33.427 --> 00:04:35.436
Some of these are the ones
that we installed.

80
00:04:35.436 --> 00:04:39.407
Obviously, we're all looking for
this one now and

81
00:04:39.407 --> 00:04:42.741
there are settings throw a ball with them.

82
00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:48.590
Yes, we're turning that on and when you
turn on a setting that is differentiated

83
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.421
from the defaults, you can see this
little blue line in this case.

84
00:04:53.421 --> 00:04:59.996
And I think you can, if you hit the at
you can search for either what.

85
00:04:59.996 --> 00:05:02.279
Feature or I think you get modified,

86
00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:06.782
which will be all the settings that
you have modified from the defaults.

87
00:05:06.782 --> 00:05:11.140
So if you wanna see where you have strayed
in this case, you can, turn that on and

88
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.352
see the settings that you have changed,

89
00:05:13.352 --> 00:05:16.042
which is useful if you're
trying to track down.

90
00:05:16.042 --> 00:05:19.601
Did you make something silly happen?

91
00:05:19.601 --> 00:05:20.856
Things that I like.

92
00:05:20.856 --> 00:05:26.747
I do like format on save, not format on
paste, not format on keystroke on save.

93
00:05:26.747 --> 00:05:29.946
I personally do not like autosave either,
right?

94
00:05:29.946 --> 00:05:32.341
Because sometimes I just
want to go read the docs and

95
00:05:32.341 --> 00:05:33.851
I did not want that page saving.

96
00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:39.456
And like Veet or whatever, recompiling it
did not ask for that, did not want it.

97
00:05:39.456 --> 00:05:47.926
Other ones that I think are super
useful is this one right here.

98
00:05:47.926 --> 00:05:53.000
I put this one in the notes too,
this reveal if open.

99
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.716
If you have a bunch of editor groups,
you open the same file,

100
00:05:54.716 --> 00:05:55.939
you will end up two tabs
with the same file.

101
00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.475
I don't want two tabs with the same file,

102
00:05:58.475 --> 00:06:02.176
if it was open in this other
editor window, just do that one.

103
00:06:02.176 --> 00:06:05.198
Do not make two tabs with the same file.

104
00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:08.430
That was one of those ones that was
driving me nuts and I sat there and

105
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.546
I just went through the settings
to find the one, which is like,

106
00:06:11.546 --> 00:06:14.340
if that file is already open in a tab,
just go to that tab.

107
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:20.026
Do not make more tabs with the same file.

108
00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:23.576
Do not ask me if I want to delete a file,
I will probably regret that one.

109
00:06:26.204 --> 00:06:29.417
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Trying to think
what the other ones that are like?

110
00:06:29.417 --> 00:06:33.322
I think, yeah, auto fetch the Git repos.

111
00:06:33.322 --> 00:06:38.159
Some prettier settings by default,
in case there is no prettier .rc in there,

112
00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.817
which is.

113
00:06:38.817 --> 00:06:42.629
Is I want commas after all the things in
the array and I want my single quotes.

114
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:45.757
And if there's a prettier RC,
it will respect that but

115
00:06:45.757 --> 00:06:50.381
if I'm just editing without a prettier
fox, I'm doing just something random,

116
00:06:50.381 --> 00:06:52.706
I will get some of those in there as well.

117
00:06:52.706 --> 00:06:56.487
But yeah, like lots of little things that
you can tweak you can see what you have

118
00:06:56.487 --> 00:06:58.510
and have not tweaked, so on and so forth.

119
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:03.529
There are certain things that you can
only do looking at the JSON itself,

120
00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:06.503
and it's a really powerful thing as well.

121
00:07:06.503 --> 00:07:12.768
So you see, llet's see
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Open User Settings JSON,

122
00:07:12.768 --> 00:07:16.775
and you will see the JSON
representation of all of your settings.

123
00:07:16.775 --> 00:07:21.050
So theoretically I have settings sync on.

124
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.407
But you could let's say we have
the situation where we have a bunch of

125
00:07:25.407 --> 00:07:30.850
workspace settings, but we did not want to
set them to Version Control for reasons.

126
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.399
At the very least, you could put what
the settings are, take the JSON.

127
00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:38.637
Say, hey, paste this or whatever.

128
00:07:38.637 --> 00:07:42.407
Or do even some better
build tooling around this,

129
00:07:42.407 --> 00:07:45.920
but these are all your
settings represented.
