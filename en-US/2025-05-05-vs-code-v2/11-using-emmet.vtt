1
00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.025
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Now we're gonna do
the interactive part of the show.

2
00:00:03.025 --> 00:00:07.538
So we talked a little bit about
conveniences in JavaScript.

3
00:00:07.538 --> 00:00:12.586
The other place where
conveniences are nice is HTML,

4
00:00:12.586 --> 00:00:15.838
because that's tedious, also,

5
00:00:15.838 --> 00:00:20.898
where there is HTML,
there's usually JSX, right?

6
00:00:20.898 --> 00:00:26.194
So, what we're gonna talk about next,
which is Emmet abbreviations

7
00:00:26.194 --> 00:00:31.149
apply to both HTML as well as JSX
depending on what you're doing.

8
00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.977
So in that little playground,there's
just an empty HTML file, that's not it.

9
00:00:35.977 --> 00:00:40.820
I'm gonna pay will do index,

10
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.117
in the playground.

11
00:00:44.117 --> 00:00:49.954
Dope, so, Emmet abbreviations are built
in, there's nothing you theoretically

12
00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:55.149
need to know, they are basically a way
to write a bunch of HTML very easily.

13
00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.383
And the way that it works is effectively
you write what is basically,

14
00:01:00.383 --> 00:01:02.287
a CSS selector, right?

15
00:01:02.287 --> 00:01:07.107
And that CSS selector ich,
will go ahead and

16
00:01:07.107 --> 00:01:10.762
generate a bunch of HTML for you.

17
00:01:10.762 --> 00:01:15.066
So if I did something like div and

18
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:19.689
then the childhood div is a ul, and

19
00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:24.641
then in there I want li*3, great.

20
00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:29.103
I can even tab and fill it out real quick,

21
00:01:29.103 --> 00:01:32.778
I can also do something like div,

22
00:01:32.778 --> 00:01:38.423
we'll do something similar, div&gt;ul&gt;li*3,

23
00:01:38.423 --> 00:01:46.161
and we'll say,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The 3 in that case,

24
00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:50.250
was just one of them, I got look at
the syntax for that one in a second, but

25
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.820
like theoretically, you can scaffold out.

26
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.671
The other thing you can do

27
00:01:57.671 --> 00:02:01.829
is div modal&gt;h2 and

28
00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.222
a paragraph, right?

29
00:02:06.222 --> 00:02:08.071
And it'll put the class on there for you.

30
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:09.870
If you did a pound sign,
it would be an ID, yeah.

31
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.163
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And Emmett just comes with,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Just it's built in,

32
00:02:13.163 --> 00:02:17.223
it's built in by default,
you have it for free.

33
00:02:17.223 --> 00:02:22.077
And so, yeah,
there's a bunch of things again,

34
00:02:22.077 --> 00:02:27.984
like header+main+footer will
get you like the 3 in a row.

35
00:02:27.984 --> 00:02:34.016
The other one that's
super useful sometimes,

36
00:02:34.016 --> 00:02:41.117
is HTML5 gets you roughly
the skeleton of an HTML file.

37
00:02:41.117 --> 00:02:45.615
You can also do script and it will,

38
00:02:45.615 --> 00:02:49.503
put the attributes in there.

39
00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:56.564
It is close enough to CSS selectors
that it will do the trick for you.

40
00:02:56.564 --> 00:03:01.722
Let me actually,
I can do it with the classes too, so

41
00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:09.008
I can do a ul&gt;li.item*5 and
they'll all get the right class, right?

42
00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:12.794
Especially nice if you're doing a bunch
of Tailwind or something like that,

43
00:03:12.794 --> 00:03:16.170
you need to have a bunch of classes
on a whole bunch of little ones, and

44
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.657
they're like, Taiwan's just use multiple
cursors to change this stuff, you're like,

45
00:03:20.657 --> 00:03:22.029
I'm not living like that.

46
00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:27.840
Trying to think, what else is kind of fun.

47
00:03:32.327 --> 00:03:36.965
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
we could do something like div.wrapper.

48
00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:45.183
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
then there we'll have div.title.

49
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.351
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, and
I'll put the text in there for

50
00:03:54.351 --> 00:03:56.279
me as well, right,
which is technically not CSS.

51
00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:59.500
That's where I was CSS each, and

52
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.379
get you some of that boilerplate super,
super fast as well.

53
00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.971
What other things are fun?

54
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:12.689
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm gonna paste this
one in here because it's a little more

55
00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:13.959
complicated, but we'll talk about it.

56
00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.089
Which is you can group them, right?

57
00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:20.922
Which is like, okay, I wanna head over
with an h1 and then next to that, I want

58
00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:25.854
a main with 3 sections in it, and after
that, I wanna foot it with a paragraph.

59
00:04:25.854 --> 00:04:29.453
And you can kinda see that
it will begin to, well,

60
00:04:29.453 --> 00:04:32.807
that was just that Copilot
being a fancy hero.

61
00:04:35.546 --> 00:04:38.023
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think it's
because I pasted it in.

62
00:04:38.023 --> 00:04:40.604
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: But you can start to
set up different sections at that point,

63
00:04:40.604 --> 00:04:41.565
to be honest with you,

64
00:04:41.565 --> 00:04:44.364
I would do these individually,
I'm never gonna remember this.

65
00:04:44.364 --> 00:04:47.964
That's why I didn't remember it
to begin with, but it is nice,

66
00:04:47.964 --> 00:04:50.782
you can kind of scaffold
out things very quickly.

67
00:04:50.782 --> 00:04:58.112
Try and think, if there's any, there would
be some challenges for you in a second.

68
00:04:58.112 --> 00:05:01.836
The ability to trim white space,
like putting comments,

69
00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:06.776
there's all sorts of little things that
are like, I don't do this anymore,

70
00:05:06.776 --> 00:05:09.969
but someone's gonna be
really happy about this.

71
00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:17.764
Form.search&gt;input.field.

72
00:05:17.764 --> 00:05:23.091
No, up, here's the thing when
you're typing in front of people,

73
00:05:23.091 --> 00:05:26.086
is you make dumb mistakes sometimes.

74
00:05:26.086 --> 00:05:30.290
Anyway, you can do lots of fun and
crazy stuff,

75
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:36.823
I have never wanted BEM CSS syntax
even when it was popular, so whatever.

76
00:05:36.823 --> 00:05:42.141
But you can do the attribute, you can
do the child's, you can do siblings,

77
00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:47.046
and a lot of that is useful, but
I usually do it in much smaller pieces,

78
00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:52.065
the moment you are writing a very long,
very complicated Emmet thing.

79
00:05:52.065 --> 00:05:56.139
You could have written 3 small ones and
copied and pasted them, or,

80
00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.612
like, multi cursed your way out of this.

81
00:05:58.612 --> 00:06:00.174
So breaking it apart, but

82
00:06:00.174 --> 00:06:05.011
if there is very few opportunities in this
workshop to have a hands on challenge.
