>> Steve Kinney: From just the bare minimum of the productivity gains of navigating around different files, or jumping from where is that function defined. Or what is the type of this thing, so on and so forth or those again hitting f2 to refactor. Huge, right? Those little, or just jumping from editor to editor so you're not sitting there stopping mouse.

[00:00:25]
There's something about the first time you try to do that keystroke to jump from one editor group to the other one, it's gonna hurt. The 77th time you do it, it's gonna be muscle memory. The next thing you know, you're not thinking about it anymore, right? All the way to getting a consistent development environment.

[00:00:43]
If you are in one of those camps where you are either working on different projects or you need consistency across your team, right? To figuring out, again, there was some controversy on whether we'd want to run the tests or not. It's super useful with these VS Codeextensions very useful with an electron app, maybe, if you're just running npm start, not the most important thing in the world, right?

[00:01:08]
But the idea is, like for whatever the things in your like development workflow that are causing that friction that is just slowing you down, imperceptibly slow, right? Snippets to just have those common patterns so you're not doing those things by hand. If things speed you up 5%, cumulatively over a year, you're saving probably a week, two weeks, three weeks, right?

[00:01:32]
And all of a sudden you're a hero, right? Not because you're any smarter than anyone else. You will tell everyone you're smarter than them. People will believe that you're smarter than them. But honestly, it's because you have a try catch block that has a conditional break point or something.

[00:01:50]
You know what I mean? And l those things that were tedious and took a long time are now faster for you. Who's making like, what are we going to do? We got pets, we got Pokemon. Come on, what's next?
>> Steve Kinney: I want an actual Tamagotchi that I have to take care of and I or Digimon, I have it fight.

[00:02:09]
Right, Mike Tyson, Doom. Someone put doom in a VS code extension.
>> Speaker 2: It probably is all right.
>> Steve Kinney: One moment, please. Is, yep, no, doom, no, that looks these.
>> Speaker 2: That shows up under one review.
>> Steve Kinney: Because if something exists that it runs doom. You know this is gonna be high quality.

[00:02:44]

>> Speaker 2: Yep, delicious.
>> Steve Kinney: All right.
>> Steve Kinney: Hold on, something's happening.
>> Speaker 2: There you go.
>> Speaker 2: It's a good play?
>> Steve Kinney: [LAUGH] I didn't pay attention to the instructions. To shoot.
>> Speaker 2: Yeah, all right.
>> Speaker 3: No way.
>> Steve Kinney: I occurs to me that I have not played doom in 30 years, and I don't know what I'm doing but anyway, you can put doom in your editor.

[00:03:19]
Vim, your move. Emacs, let's go.
