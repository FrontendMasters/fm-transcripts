00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.673
&gt;&gt; Steve.: I have a close
friend named Juan.

2
00:00:01.673 --> 00:00:04.819
And before he was a software engineer,
he was a chef.

3
00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.755
And he had this point that he
made to me nine years ago,

4
00:00:09.755 --> 00:00:15.241
kind of relating that, a good chef or
cook knows their tools

5
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:20.201
incredibly well,
the concept of like mise en place.

6
00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:23.040
A place of getting
everything organized and

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.040
ready to go before you
sit down to do your work.

8
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.845
There's a lot of other fields
where running around and

9
00:00:30.845 --> 00:00:38.171
being kind of doing things very tediously
or manually, is not gonna work, right?

10
00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:41.815
As a software engineer, because we are
mostly sitting in front of the computer,

11
00:00:41.815 --> 00:00:44.937
and it's minor movements with our hand and
stuff along those lines.

12
00:00:44.937 --> 00:00:49.679
It doesn't always feel maybe not having
the best handle on all our tools was

13
00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:51.265
really slowing us down.

14
00:00:51.265 --> 00:00:55.642
Because, to be clear, I joke that
a large part of software engineer,

15
00:00:55.642 --> 00:01:00.333
not necessarily the writing of the code,
but the thinking of the problem.

16
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:04.493
That said, I do think that there is
something to be said for getting really,

17
00:01:04.493 --> 00:01:08.068
really, really comfortable with
your tools to kind of clear that

18
00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.825
part of your brain out, right?

19
00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:14.708
It is easier to think big brain thoughts
if all of the mechanics of manifesting

20
00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:17.939
it on the screen is relatively
straightforward and

21
00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.012
you're not thinking about,
how do I get over to that file?

22
00:01:22.012 --> 00:01:22.939
Or where is that thing?

23
00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.080
All those things are kind of distracting
you from pulling apart the big problem.

24
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.672
And so, what we wanna do today is sit down
with most many people's favorite editor.

25
00:01:33.672 --> 00:01:38.331
I won't quote all the various different
state of JavaScript, surveys, whatever,

26
00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:40.154
but like, generally speaking.

27
00:01:40.154 --> 00:01:43.026
Much to the chagrin of the Emacs group,

28
00:01:43.026 --> 00:01:47.729
Visual Studio Code tends to be
a relatively popular editor, and

29
00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.574
one that I think is worthwhile
to sit down and learn.

30
00:01:51.574 --> 00:01:53.739
I'm coming from, what'd I say coming from?

31
00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:59.599
I mean, like a decade ago, TextMate, so
you know, it was only to go up from there.

32
00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:02.719
So we're gonna kinda
go through everything,

33
00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.003
all the various different
parts of Versus Code.

34
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:11.249
Whether you are brand new to VS code or
you've used it all the time,

35
00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:16.684
there will probably be something where,
that makes my life 1,

36
00:02:16.684 --> 00:02:20.542
2, 10, 75, 1000% easier, right?

37
00:02:20.542 --> 00:02:22.903
And we'll kind of cover all
the various to various and

38
00:02:22.903 --> 00:02:25.853
go into a little more depth than you
might in your normal day to day.

39
00:02:25.853 --> 00:02:29.637
I think it is worthwhile to spend a little
bit of time just sitting down with

40
00:02:29.637 --> 00:02:32.213
the tool itself and
learning the ins and out of it.

41
00:02:32.213 --> 00:02:35.959
A lot of times, we are using the tool
while solving some other problem and

42
00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.477
learning just about enough to get
the job done and no more than that.

43
00:02:39.477 --> 00:02:40.685
So let's spend some time together.

44
00:02:40.685 --> 00:02:44.094
Let's get it,
let's learn all the kind of moving pieces.

45
00:02:44.094 --> 00:02:47.729
Some things are gonna resonate with you
and be like, I'm gonna use it every day.

46
00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:50.888
Some things are like,
that's good to know, right?

47
00:02:50.888 --> 00:02:54.891
And that will be probably slightly
different for every single person.

48
00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:58.240
But the goal is to figure out how
to kind of take this editor and

49
00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.563
make it yours, right?

50
00:02:59.563 --> 00:03:02.231
Not necessarily,
I'll show you some of my settings and

51
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:06.089
some of the extensions I use totally, but
then also kind of give you the inroads to

52
00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:09.590
figure out all the things that you
wanna do for your particular use case.

53
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.662
Because not only do you probably have
different preferences as a human being,

54
00:03:12.662 --> 00:03:13.322
that's great.

55
00:03:13.322 --> 00:03:16.052
You probably work in various
different code bases,

56
00:03:16.052 --> 00:03:18.541
maybe it's a full stack
type script code base.

57
00:03:18.541 --> 00:03:21.692
Maybe it's like, you don't even
control the backend, who knows?

58
00:03:21.692 --> 00:03:26.219
Maybe you need 17,000 Docker
containers to get anything running.

59
00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:30.288
These are all things I have dealt
with in my life at various points.

60
00:03:30.288 --> 00:03:34.698
So kind of look at what those things are
and you can kind of pick and choose and

61
00:03:34.698 --> 00:03:36.810
craft the experience around that.

62
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.690
And no matter what, as I kind of
mentioned before, my aspiration is that

63
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.494
there is something, many things,
a dozen things, depending on you.

64
00:03:46.494 --> 00:03:50.375
If you're like, hey,
I just came from a jet brains ID to,

65
00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:55.069
I'm learning how to code to,
I've been doing this really long time.

66
00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.690
But there's whole parts of VS Code that I
don't touch because I don't know what they

67
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.896
are, and ain't nobody got time for
that, right?

68
00:04:00.896 --> 00:04:02.927
So regardless,
if you're all front-end, great.

69
00:04:02.927 --> 00:04:07.696
If you also need to do some back-end stuff
and worry about having containers and

70
00:04:07.696 --> 00:04:12.699
stuff along those lines, awesome, we'll
kind of navigate all of that together.

71
00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.560
And by the end, you will be able
to kind of navigate around and

72
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.819
customize everything to your liking,
so on and so forth, right?

73
00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:23.552
The high level is, we're gonna talk
a little bit about getting around

74
00:04:23.552 --> 00:04:25.044
the editor, cuz that's important.

75
00:04:25.044 --> 00:04:28.825
We're gonna talk about all of
the things that are repetitive and

76
00:04:28.825 --> 00:04:32.955
not big brain thoughts, and
how to make those as easy as possible, and

77
00:04:32.955 --> 00:04:36.333
then making sure that we have
consistent environments.

78
00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:38.143
If you work on a big enough team,

79
00:04:38.143 --> 00:04:42.180
somebody's development environment
is broken at all times, right?

80
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.522
I meant to get such and such task done,
but I couldn't get whatever to spin up.

81
00:04:47.522 --> 00:04:50.359
So we'll talk a little bit
about how to manage that.

82
00:04:50.359 --> 00:04:54.193
And then we're gonna talk a little
bit about how to build your own

83
00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:58.810
Visual Studio Code extensions because
turns out, I'm not going to assume,

84
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.107
I am going to assume.

85
00:05:00.107 --> 00:05:03.721
And that everyone's got a little
passing knowledge of JavaScript,

86
00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:08.285
the JavaScript programming language,
given that we're on frontendmasters.com.

87
00:05:08.285 --> 00:05:09.000
And so, in so

88
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.443
far that we relatively know a lot of the
moving pieces to make VS code extensions.

89
00:05:13.443 --> 00:05:14.834
We'll kind of take a look at that too,

90
00:05:14.834 --> 00:05:17.098
cuz maybe you can start building
out some of your own tooling.

91
00:05:17.098 --> 00:05:18.565
So we'll look at some existing extensions,

92
00:05:18.565 --> 00:05:20.120
we'll look at how to
build our own extensions.

93
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.697
We'll use the editor to build
extensions for the editor,

94
00:05:23.697 --> 00:05:25.746
it's gonna be great, awesome.

95
00:05:25.746 --> 00:05:29.528
So, let's do the businessy stuff,

96
00:05:29.528 --> 00:05:33.438
which is we've got a course website.

97
00:05:33.438 --> 00:05:38.096
As I said to everyone in the room,
the prerequisites,

98
00:05:38.096 --> 00:05:43.161
you're probably gonna need to
download Visual Studio Code

99
00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:48.223
if you don't have it in a full
course on Visual Studio Code,

100
00:05:48.223 --> 00:05:51.284
that is the one core prerequisite.

101
00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:55.314
When we get into some of the container
step, if you don't have docker desktop and

102
00:05:55.314 --> 00:05:59.483
you would like to do that stuff, you can
download it sometime between now and then.

103
00:05:59.483 --> 00:06:06.221
There is also this little repository
here of little sample silly apps,

104
00:06:06.221 --> 00:06:13.873
just because it is hard to explain how to
use an editor without something to edit.

105
00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:18.862
That said, I would say that if whatever
code base that you work on day-to-day, or

106
00:06:18.862 --> 00:06:22.873
one that you know your way around,
I would open that up to, right?

107
00:06:22.873 --> 00:06:28.275
Cuz I think sometimes, it is very hard to
simulate a large real-world code base and

108
00:06:28.275 --> 00:06:29.594
you might have one.

109
00:06:29.594 --> 00:06:34.576
So I think we can apply a lot of those
things to our own code bases, so on and

110
00:06:34.576 --> 00:06:35.331
so forth.
