00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:02.342
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Now we get
into some of the power tools.

2
00:00:02.342 --> 00:00:06.045
Let's talk a little bit about,
again, as we said before,

3
00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:10.798
how to become a 10x developer,
which is how to cause destruction faster.

4
00:00:10.798 --> 00:00:16.918
Like most text editors, I cannot come up
with a text editor that does not do this,

5
00:00:16.918 --> 00:00:20.891
you do have some amount of find and
replace, right?

6
00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:27.107
And you've got this on two different
levels, you've got this in the file,

7
00:00:27.107 --> 00:00:31.786
and you've got this across
the entire project, right?

8
00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:35.956
The functionality is basically the same,
we'll look at both, but

9
00:00:35.956 --> 00:00:37.356
it is basically same.

10
00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:40.639
So if you want to do any particular file,
it's Cmd+F, or

11
00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:42.921
Ctrl+F if you're on Windows, Linux.

12
00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:48.564
And then just Cmd+Shift+F, Ctrl+Shift+F if
you wanna do it for the entire project.

13
00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:53.240
And you get this cute little thing,
right here.

14
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.925
And you can see that,
you can go up and down for history,

15
00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:01.233
there's my fun regexes from earlier.

16
00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:07.438
And up and down like that, and you can
also expand it and get a find and replace.

17
00:01:07.438 --> 00:01:12.363
Trying to think what else is
important here, these options

18
00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:17.680
are the other kind of important piece,
which is, in this case,

19
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.719
it is gonna be legit, match the case,
no regex, good to go.

20
00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.920
As far as I know,
there's no way to save the setting, but

21
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.477
you can kind of see some
of the commands here.

22
00:01:28.477 --> 00:01:33.847
These are ones I will just, in the sake
of pure honesty, have never memorized.

23
00:01:33.847 --> 00:01:35.612
But I should, right?

24
00:01:35.612 --> 00:01:37.573
And you should too, we all should.

25
00:01:37.573 --> 00:01:39.645
Which is match case, match the whole word,

26
00:01:39.645 --> 00:01:42.116
this will not get you
partial word matches, right?

27
00:01:42.116 --> 00:01:43.096
Depending on what you're looking for.

28
00:01:43.096 --> 00:01:46.513
So that way if you wanted add
by itself but not async add,

29
00:01:46.513 --> 00:01:51.095
this would solve that for you, but
probably break somewhere else for you,

30
00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:54.531
just use the rename F2 thing
that I showed you earlier.

31
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:59.420
And then who doesn't love
a good regular expression?

32
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.630
And so,
you can toggle those things on and off.

33
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.282
The other one is if you are case
insensitive and you wanna do a find and

34
00:02:05.282 --> 00:02:07.344
replace, it will preserve the case.

35
00:02:07.344 --> 00:02:11.338
So if you wanted to let's say,

36
00:02:11.338 --> 00:02:16.102
we don't pair up matching the case,

37
00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:23.027
we'll just say add,
we can see it gets the capital A.

38
00:02:23.027 --> 00:02:25.954
And it gets the lower case one,
you can see a highlight.

39
00:02:25.954 --> 00:02:29.249
The other fun part that's super
useful is on the mini map,

40
00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:32.083
you get a sense of all
the places that are founded.

41
00:02:32.083 --> 00:02:35.720
If you have errors, you'll see red
lines there, also really great for

42
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.461
figuring out why my TypeScript
file won't compile.

43
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:43.734
I'll see one red line, I can just kind of
roughly click to it and get close enough.

44
00:02:43.734 --> 00:02:48.068
But if we preserve the case in this case,

45
00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:54.067
let's change it to sum, and
here we can do replace all.

46
00:02:54.067 --> 00:02:58.969
So lowercase sum, capital S sum,
it'll keep all the case,

47
00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.671
so you don't have to do it twice.

48
00:03:01.671 --> 00:03:09.111
Neat, you can also search by regex,
you know when you need to do it.

49
00:03:09.111 --> 00:03:16.182
You're not happy about it, but no one
goes for regex as their first choice.

50
00:03:16.182 --> 00:03:20.535
I weirdly somehow can think in regex, but
I understand nobody else wants to do that,

51
00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:23.251
that's fine,
I should have been a Perl developer.

52
00:03:23.251 --> 00:03:27.970
And so, yeah, you can change that, you
can search by regex, so on and so forth.

53
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.699
More powerful most of the time is
the overall, if we hit Cmd+Shift+F or

54
00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:37.520
Ctrl+Shift+F, or you can just click
on this little magnifying glass.

55
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.457
But again,
you have to hover over it first and

56
00:03:40.457 --> 00:03:45.189
internalize the command before
you're allowed to click, promise me?

57
00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.673
You see a lot of the same
options in this case,

58
00:03:49.673 --> 00:03:56.166
to no one's surprise,
you have this ability to replace as well.

59
00:03:56.166 --> 00:04:01.065
You also have, hey,
I actually wanna find that word,

60
00:04:01.065 --> 00:04:06.084
but only in TSX files, or
only in this given directory.

61
00:04:06.084 --> 00:04:11.725
Or only in whatever given case you can
put like a glob in there to be like,

62
00:04:11.725 --> 00:04:16.331
okay, so in this case,
this first one here would be like,

63
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:22.000
zoom in a little bit there, yeah,
because I wasn't zoomed in enough.

64
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.253
The first one is all TypeScript files,
or like anything in source,

65
00:04:26.253 --> 00:04:28.800
any sub directory and the file include.

66
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.241
Or the opposite is you can try to use
the ability to exclude given files,

67
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:39.607
whatever you're trying to do any
given case, both will do the trick.

68
00:04:39.607 --> 00:04:43.645
And so, you can search for something,
so let's do asyncAdd, in this case,

69
00:04:43.645 --> 00:04:45.026
that should be a few less.

70
00:04:45.026 --> 00:04:47.279
So now we can see every
place that it is included.

71
00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:50.215
If I only wanted to change in
the test files, for instance,

72
00:04:50.215 --> 00:04:56.886
I could do something like,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right,

73
00:04:56.886 --> 00:05:01.177
now you can see it's only gonna
find it in whatever.test.js,

74
00:05:01.177 --> 00:05:03.810
you can get a little bit more granular.

75
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.745
You can go ahead and look,

76
00:05:06.745 --> 00:05:12.755
you can go say open in editor,
let's turn that down.

77
00:05:12.755 --> 00:05:17.542
And you can see a more like,
kind of exactly where it matches.

78
00:05:17.542 --> 00:05:22.078
The cool thing that you can do here, let's
say you're doing, for whatever reason,

79
00:05:22.078 --> 00:05:24.726
maybe you're doing some data cleaning,
right?

80
00:05:24.726 --> 00:05:29.885
You're probably not doing this with code
all the time, but maybe you're doing it

81
00:05:29.885 --> 00:05:35.042
with some CSVs, you can actually save that
code search and open it back up later and

82
00:05:35.042 --> 00:05:39.795
get kind of all of your settings in this
case and go ahead and find it as well.

83
00:05:39.795 --> 00:05:44.972
But this will kind of show you
all the different files and

84
00:05:44.972 --> 00:05:51.043
give you a little bit of a larger
view in which to find and replace.

85
00:05:51.043 --> 00:05:55.614
Like I said before, we can do regex and
where the regex ones are powerful is

86
00:05:55.614 --> 00:06:00.360
in the ability to kind of pull out parts
of that regex and reuse them, right?

87
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.612
So, let's say I wanted something,
whereas we'll turn on regex,

88
00:06:05.612 --> 00:06:11.799
we'll say async, and then I want to say
any word character until the end there.

89
00:06:11.799 --> 00:06:16.373
And this will get asyncAdd, will get
asyncSubtract, because it's async plus any

90
00:06:16.373 --> 00:06:19.721
number of letters, capital,
lowercase, we don't care.

91
00:06:19.721 --> 00:06:21.330
As you can see, it'll find all of those.

92
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.441
But then the thing I can do
is we can change it to like,

93
00:06:25.441 --> 00:06:29.833
and then the one will be
the first thing in parentheses,

94
00:06:29.833 --> 00:06:33.774
if you have multiple parentheses, $2, $3.

95
00:06:33.774 --> 00:06:38.455
And so now instead of asyncAdd,
asyncSubtract, I can rename them all,

96
00:06:38.455 --> 00:06:43.001
promiseAdd, promiseSubtract,
whatever you choose to do, right?

97
00:06:43.001 --> 00:06:48.999
If you need to keep, hey,
I wanna take all of these Markdown h1s and

98
00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:51.643
make them HTML h1s, right?

99
00:06:51.643 --> 00:06:56.807
You could grab the affectively,

100
00:06:56.807 --> 00:07:01.786
pound, pound, for all the ones

101
00:07:01.786 --> 00:07:06.219
in Markdown files, right?

102
00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:12.016
Pound, pound and we wanna say really

103
00:07:12.016 --> 00:07:17.633
anything until the end of the line.

104
00:07:17.633 --> 00:07:20.733
In this case, we can say, and

105
00:07:20.733 --> 00:07:26.192
I want to change it to h1s or
h2 in this case, $1.

106
00:07:26.192 --> 00:07:30.605
And now you can see, again,
I can open this in the editor and

107
00:07:30.605 --> 00:07:35.294
it will show you everything that
is going to match in this case.

108
00:07:35.294 --> 00:07:38.877
And I can replace all of them right here,
right now, and

109
00:07:38.877 --> 00:07:40.714
keep the text in the middle.

110
00:07:40.714 --> 00:07:44.934
It's regex, it's there for you,
you know it when you need it.

111
00:07:44.934 --> 00:07:49.401
We will literally build a little
regex tester as an extension in

112
00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:54.053
a little bit if you need to practice
your regex, because why not?

113
00:07:54.053 --> 00:07:59.014
The other thing that I
think is really powerful,

114
00:07:59.014 --> 00:08:04.096
and this falls under things
that I didn't know you

115
00:08:04.096 --> 00:08:08.936
could do until a moment
in time where I was like,

116
00:08:08.936 --> 00:08:12.085
this is tedious, I hate this.

117
00:08:12.085 --> 00:08:15.142
And then, sat down and
be there's gotta be a better way.

118
00:08:15.142 --> 00:08:18.302
Listen to that inside of you,
because a lot of times,

119
00:08:18.302 --> 00:08:21.673
my job right now is to kind of
show you the lay of the land and

120
00:08:21.673 --> 00:08:24.710
inspire you of what is possibly possible,
right?

121
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.994
But like what is useful
to you will be like,

122
00:08:27.994 --> 00:08:32.376
anytime you get frustrated,
is the time to sit, pause,

123
00:08:32.376 --> 00:08:36.781
reflect, and figure out is
there a better way to do this.
