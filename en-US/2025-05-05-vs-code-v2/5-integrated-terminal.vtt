00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.825
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's talk
about that the terminal.

2
00:00:01.825 --> 00:00:04.977
Now, there are a lot of things
you can do with the terminal,

3
00:00:04.977 --> 00:00:07.260
most of which most of us don't care about.

4
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.926
So if there are a little, if you need to
use a particular profile, or you're like,

5
00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:15.059
I need to use a given shell,
I got some notes for you, but

6
00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.682
I'm not going to drag
everyone through that.

7
00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:19.670
That could be an exercise for the reader.

8
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.669
Let's go with the most common quick hits,
shall we?

9
00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.833
One is you don't just have
an integrated terminal.

10
00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:32.104
You have more than one.

11
00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:34.954
You have as many as you need.

12
00:00:34.954 --> 00:00:39.435
So you can create another one,
right, with this plus sign.

13
00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:44.501
If you hover over it, you will see
that there is a keyboard shortcut.

14
00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:45.949
Are you gonna remember that right now?

15
00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:46.706
You're not.

16
00:00:46.706 --> 00:00:50.740
But eventually, again,
I don't need you to remember it.

17
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.698
If the other rule is open the command
palette, if you find yourself mousing over

18
00:00:55.698 --> 00:01:00.672
something to click on it, then your
punishment, just not really punishment.

19
00:01:00.672 --> 00:01:04.923
The practice is to hover over for
a first second, reflect on it,

20
00:01:04.923 --> 00:01:06.909
take your mouse away from it.

21
00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.891
In this case,
it is control shift back tick.

22
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:15.567
Control Shift back tick,
and you can open up more

23
00:01:15.567 --> 00:01:20.486
than one editor or
more than one terminal, right?

24
00:01:20.486 --> 00:01:27.975
Useful if you need to spin up, an express
server and a Vite or Webpack for the UI.

25
00:01:27.975 --> 00:01:29.265
You can do that in two separate ones.

26
00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:32.483
We will find a much better ways
to do that in a little bit.

27
00:01:32.483 --> 00:01:36.179
But for now, that will do the trick or
a lot of times,

28
00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:41.140
the more common use case is I've
got the development server running,

29
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.363
and, wait,
I need to NPM install something, right?

30
00:01:45.363 --> 00:01:47.080
And so I will have another one.

31
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.410
The other option, again,
if we hover over here,

32
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.752
is we could also split a terminal as well,
right?

33
00:01:55.752 --> 00:01:57.544
And so you can have two split.

34
00:01:57.544 --> 00:02:02.513
And so if you had two processes, again,
you The Express server for the API and

35
00:02:02.513 --> 00:02:04.900
the web pack, or V server for the UI.

36
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.111
You could have those going so
you can see both of them email

37
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:13.076
at you at various points and
stuff along those lines.

38
00:02:13.076 --> 00:02:16.826
Yeah, those are the major things
that I think are important in

39
00:02:16.826 --> 00:02:18.205
the terminal itself.

40
00:02:18.205 --> 00:02:22.119
Like I said, if you need to use
different shells and profiles and

41
00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:23.726
stuff along those lines.

42
00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:25.633
That is a thing available to you.

43
00:02:25.633 --> 00:02:27.946
But if you need that,
you already know you need that.

44
00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:29.465
And if you're like, do I need that?

45
00:02:29.465 --> 00:02:31.750
The answer is no.

46
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:39.282
Cool, I'm just trying to think, if there's
anything we got into splitting terminals.

47
00:02:39.282 --> 00:02:43.687
If for some reason, when we get into
settings, you can change the font for

48
00:02:43.687 --> 00:02:46.328
the terminal versus
the rest of the editor.

49
00:02:46.328 --> 00:02:50.936
If you're gonna ask me why, I don't
have an answer for you, maybe font size.

50
00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:55.044
But if you wanted totally different fonts,
that's a choice as well.

51
00:02:55.044 --> 00:02:59.504
But like I said, there are notes for a lot
of the other things you might want to do

52
00:02:59.504 --> 00:03:03.843
as well as that keyboard shortcut that
I showed earlier that I left in there.

53
00:03:03.843 --> 00:03:07.618
It was there for us, so on and so forth.

54
00:03:07.618 --> 00:03:09.158
But some extra notes there.

55
00:03:09.158 --> 00:03:13.100
But the terminals there, you can have
more than one, you can split it,

56
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.335
you can navigate across them,
so on and so forth, right?

57
00:03:20.986 --> 00:03:25.237
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we start with focus
terminal, you can also focus the next

58
00:03:25.237 --> 00:03:30.694
terminal group which is the same command
to this for editor as well, right?

59
00:03:30.694 --> 00:03:33.180
Which is one of the ones
I never think about,

60
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.025
cuz this is I think the same as it
is in Chrome from moving across tab.

61
00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:41.158
So It's like one of those ones that I've
never actually had to say out loud too

62
00:03:41.158 --> 00:03:45.181
many times, but you can hit and on a Mac
it is command shift square bracket.

63
00:03:45.181 --> 00:03:49.556
But again, when you forget,
just type it and again,

64
00:03:49.556 --> 00:03:53.165
you don't even need to be perfect, right?

65
00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:57.072
Like, this is finding everything with
the word focus and terminal in it.

66
00:03:57.072 --> 00:03:59.489
And again,
you can see the keyboard shortcut.

67
00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.320
You can change them if you're
coming from some other editor or

68
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.614
whatever that does it differently.

69
00:04:05.614 --> 00:04:07.332
Everything is configurable.

70
00:04:07.332 --> 00:04:12.432
Again, the goal of this workshop is I will
show you the hooks in which you can build

71
00:04:12.432 --> 00:04:17.683
your own lightsaber and customize things
to your preferences, so on and so forth.

72
00:04:17.683 --> 00:04:19.419
And again,
there are stuff like settings sync.

73
00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.974
There's the ability everything is JSON, so
you can port this stuff around with you.

74
00:04:22.974 --> 00:04:27.105
I did with my bash profile and
VIM configuration for

75
00:04:27.105 --> 00:04:32.786
five years before I realized that I
don't have time for that anymore.

76
00:04:32.786 --> 00:04:36.786
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Someone in the chat also
mentions that the latest version of

77
00:04:36.786 --> 00:04:39.926
VS code adds IntelliSense, the terminal.

78
00:04:39.926 --> 00:04:44.132
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, I also have
that from the shell too, that's cool.

79
00:04:44.132 --> 00:04:48.921
I think you can also,
if you have Copilot installed,

80
00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:51.908
you can also use Github Copilot.

81
00:04:51.908 --> 00:04:55.699
I've never done this before,
we're gonna do it together.

82
00:05:02.494 --> 00:05:06.683
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Hey, look, it gave
me a grep command with a single word.

83
00:05:06.683 --> 00:05:10.098
So you can also learn better bash or
ZHS or

84
00:05:10.098 --> 00:05:15.632
any shell command by roughly
guessing what it ought to have been.

85
00:05:15.632 --> 00:05:19.722
Look at it before you [INAUDIBLE]
your entire computer please.

86
00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:24.051
I will not be held responsible for
any dumb thing that you do.

87
00:05:24.051 --> 00:05:29.226
When we get into any of multi-cursor,
find and replace, or

88
00:05:29.226 --> 00:05:35.121
particularly any of the quote unquote
AI stuff, Git is your friend.

89
00:05:35.121 --> 00:05:40.900
If you do anything in bulk without
committing first, it will be a learning

90
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.601
experience that I have had too many times,
because I don't ever learn.

91
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:50.592
But yeah, so that is an option there
as well, which is pretty cool.
