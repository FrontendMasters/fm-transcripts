00:00:00.112 --> 00:00:05.103
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So, VS code has support
for these things called extensions, and

2
00:00:05.103 --> 00:00:10.183
there are lots of them,
there's a bunch of ways you can find them,

3
00:00:10.183 --> 00:00:14.563
you could theoretically just
start searching for them.

4
00:00:14.563 --> 00:00:18.520
There are some recommended
ones as well as you can see,

5
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.213
you could also go by the most popular,
recently published could be anything.

6
00:00:24.213 --> 00:00:30.179
Recommended are the really,
what you think they are it's Docker or

7
00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.225
Python, right so on and so forth.

8
00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:37.489
There are some categories that you
can kind of explore depending on,

9
00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.953
what it is that you're looking for,
so on and so forth.

10
00:00:40.953 --> 00:00:44.567
So, I went through my own setup and

11
00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:50.799
pulled out some of my favorites,
I will warn you right now,

12
00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:56.547
the ones that I love the most
are the silliest, right.

13
00:00:56.547 --> 00:01:00.718
And then I asked all of my coworkers for
some recommendations.

14
00:01:00.718 --> 00:01:05.464
And then I did Google best
VS code extension and

15
00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:09.488
opened five tabs and read some of them.

16
00:01:09.488 --> 00:01:14.307
So, this is a compiled list some of
these if it is a language that you use,

17
00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:19.284
for instance, I also use bun a lot so
having some of those little bindings,

18
00:01:19.284 --> 00:01:21.906
those aren't particularly special.

19
00:01:21.906 --> 00:01:28.279
Let's go to the notes, though,
where I've got a bunch of extensions

20
00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:33.909
that I put in alphabetical order
as not to play any favorites.

21
00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.086
We are not gonna go through all of these
one by one, but I will kind of pick and

22
00:01:40.086 --> 00:01:46.479
choose a few and then we'll grab a few
from the audience and life will be good.

23
00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.441
First, we're gonna go with what
I'm gonna argue is the most

24
00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:55.928
important extension that I use,
the last on the list.

25
00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:59.978
This one is called toggle quotes,
right and

26
00:01:59.978 --> 00:02:04.248
what it does is it adds
a new keyboard binding,

27
00:02:04.248 --> 00:02:08.310
either command, single quote or control.

28
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.756
And I feel the only way
to truly understand,

29
00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:16.051
make sure I uninstalled
a bunch of extensions before.

30
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:18.559
But I'm sure, and
then I tried to play a game of which

31
00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:21.882
ones did I actually feel the need to
put back toggle quotes came back.

32
00:02:21.882 --> 00:02:24.744
Because I installed them and
then went to my normal day job, and

33
00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:27.984
I just tried to see how many of them
should up which I think is an important

34
00:02:27.984 --> 00:02:29.447
practice every once in a while.

35
00:02:29.447 --> 00:02:33.939
Clear out everything and then see what
comes back cuz I found something there

36
00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.688
then I'm I don't remember installing this.

37
00:02:36.688 --> 00:02:41.406
All right, so
toggle quotes let me explain to you so

38
00:02:41.406 --> 00:02:44.495
the glory that is toggle quotes.

39
00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:49.721
So where's my index.js in
the playground there it is, okay so

40
00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:55.615
let's say you have a string,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

41
00:02:55.615 --> 00:03:00.288
all of a sudden, you're like, I wish this
was one of those fancy template strings

42
00:03:00.288 --> 00:03:02.673
with the back ticks go inside the string.

43
00:03:02.673 --> 00:03:07.921
You hit command, and
you toggle between double quote,

44
00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:10.834
single quote, and back tick.

45
00:03:15.108 --> 00:03:18.943
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I love this extension,
it is my favorite extension.

46
00:03:18.943 --> 00:03:23.750
It is the one extension that I
cannot live without, I know,

47
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.149
that seems dumb, and I love it,
[LAUGH] right and it makes me happy.

48
00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:33.524
And whatever, like that way if all of
a sudden need to be, especially for

49
00:03:33.524 --> 00:03:34.905
a much bigger string.

50
00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:39.297
Or all of a sudden, I realize there is
an apostrophe in there or quotes or

51
00:03:39.297 --> 00:03:42.532
I need to do that the template
literal thing of like.

52
00:03:47.973 --> 00:03:52.273
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right if it was
this one now, I could switch it and.

53
00:03:56.982 --> 00:04:01.686
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And get to the same
basic thing it's dumb I love it it's my

54
00:04:01.686 --> 00:04:02.669
favorite.

55
00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:09.236
All right, so that is one let's
see what else we've got in here.

56
00:04:09.236 --> 00:04:14.381
That is nice okay,
this one also great if you work

57
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:19.776
on multiple projects and
you do them all in VS code,

58
00:04:19.776 --> 00:04:26.444
there is a chance that you will
forget which window you were in.

59
00:04:26.444 --> 00:04:30.504
The dumbest version of this, which I'm
sure that no one can relate to, but

60
00:04:30.504 --> 00:04:32.508
I can relate to myself with this one.

61
00:04:32.508 --> 00:04:38.619
Sometimes you are writing code,
sometimes you are writing a ton

62
00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:43.724
of marked down that happens
to have code blocks in it.

63
00:04:43.724 --> 00:04:46.014
Sometimes when you are tired,

64
00:04:46.014 --> 00:04:51.034
you are editing the code in
the markdown code block, hitting save,

65
00:04:51.034 --> 00:04:55.985
refreshing your browser and
wondering why nothing's changing.

66
00:04:55.985 --> 00:05:00.568
What peacock does is it
allows you to kind of like

67
00:05:00.568 --> 00:05:04.935
define a very subtle color for
every window.

68
00:05:04.935 --> 00:05:09.983
So, if you're like your back-end code,
you might choose to have it like red for

69
00:05:09.983 --> 00:05:14.899
ruby, I don't know, and your front-end
code might be blue for typescript.

70
00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:20.719
So it is very in your face which
project you are in, right?

71
00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:24.804
The only issue is that when we
get into settings in a second,

72
00:05:24.804 --> 00:05:29.641
there is user settings,
workspace settings, and global settings.

73
00:05:29.641 --> 00:05:34.369
This is a workspace setting, and if your
team decides they're gonna check those

74
00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:38.620
into version control, you gotta at
least have a conversation, right?

75
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.474
But you will never forget which
project you are in if one is

76
00:05:43.474 --> 00:05:47.638
bright yellow and
the other one is cyan, right?

77
00:05:47.638 --> 00:05:53.658
Again, my favorite ones
are clearly the silliest, but

78
00:05:53.658 --> 00:06:00.589
some of these simple ones are incredibly,
incredibly useful.

79
00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:05.237
Another one that I really
like is indent rainbow,

80
00:06:05.237 --> 00:06:10.882
all it does is color codes my indents,
there used to be one for

81
00:06:10.882 --> 00:06:17.433
making the brackets rainbow too,
but that's not built into VS code.

82
00:06:17.433 --> 00:06:20.490
So like that was another
one that I enjoyed, but

83
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.166
I don't need to enjoy it
anymore cuz it's built in yeah.

84
00:06:24.166 --> 00:06:25.739
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you have one,
not to jump ahead, but

85
00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:28.572
do you have one that does color your
brackets so if you're in a nested.

86
00:06:28.572 --> 00:06:30.044
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's
by default these days.

87
00:06:30.044 --> 00:06:30.621
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

88
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:33.481
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right if we kind of,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right, prettier or

89
00:06:33.481 --> 00:06:35.854
whatever's built in, isn't it?

90
00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:40.139
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There's also prettier
extension unclear what's built in at this

91
00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:40.903
point,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay

92
00:06:40.903 --> 00:06:42.475
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Mostly because sometimes,

93
00:06:42.475 --> 00:06:46.598
when you've had it, always you forget,
if it's built in but if you look,

94
00:06:46.598 --> 00:06:50.409
you can kind of see that the first
one is purple, the next one is blue.

95
00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:54.006
After that, it's yellow, like that
used to be an extension that I used,

96
00:06:54.006 --> 00:06:56.256
it was like bracket colorizer
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's it,

97
00:06:56.256 --> 00:06:56.814
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, and

98
00:06:56.814 --> 00:07:00.168
the only reason I don't use it
anymore is cuz it's now built in.

99
00:07:00.168 --> 00:07:01.064
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

100
00:07:01.064 --> 00:07:04.386
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I actually only learned
that when I uninstalled all the extensions

101
00:07:04.386 --> 00:07:07.540
in preparation for this and
then didn't have to reinstall it.

102
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.807
Cool what else is on the list that I like,

103
00:07:09.807 --> 00:07:13.556
and I will talk about some of
the other ones that other people like.

104
00:07:13.556 --> 00:07:18.423
In a second, EditorConfig is a standard,
which is you've probably seen a lot

105
00:07:18.423 --> 00:07:22.128
of repos, there's .EditorConfig,
which is like this.

106
00:07:22.128 --> 00:07:27.223
We use spaces and not tabs,
we use two spaces as the indent.

107
00:07:27.223 --> 00:07:31.218
If a .EditorConfig is in the repo,

108
00:07:31.218 --> 00:07:36.689
VS code will respect
those settings that's it.

109
00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:40.402
The GitLens one, which I don't
normally use, we talked about,

110
00:07:40.402 --> 00:07:43.859
has a bunch of features and
most importantly IntelliSense.

111
00:07:47.608 --> 00:07:50.080
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This one is pretty cool,

112
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.494
this one will actually cuz we all,
none of you do this,

113
00:07:55.494 --> 00:08:01.525
but we all have a coworker that
puts a to-do in the comments.

114
00:08:01.525 --> 00:08:04.252
They're never gonna do that to-do right?

115
00:08:04.252 --> 00:08:07.189
It's never gonna happen this
will at least make it so

116
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:09.735
that it's like a lot easier to find,
right?

117
00:08:09.735 --> 00:08:14.227
And you can kind of see them in a tree and
colorize them, etc.

118
00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:19.040
Like again,
the ones I use the most are very simple.

119
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.668
Other ones that I think are popular,
the Tailwind IntelliSense,

120
00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:26.233
basically auto completes tailwind
classes and also sorts them so

121
00:08:26.233 --> 00:08:28.592
that you don't have to fight with people.

122
00:08:28.592 --> 00:08:32.990
In the same way prettier,
which just formats everything in a way

123
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.640
that maybe no one fully loves, but
we don't talk about it anymore.

124
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.088
Trying to think the other ones,
this again,

125
00:08:41.088 --> 00:08:44.007
a super simple one, auto rename tag.

126
00:08:44.007 --> 00:08:47.483
Should you be in HTML and
you change the opening tag,

127
00:08:47.483 --> 00:08:49.934
it will change the closing tag yeah.

128
00:08:49.934 --> 00:08:53.451
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I don't know if it's auto
renamed, I mean, that's one I use, but

129
00:08:53.451 --> 00:08:57.063
I run into problems with that sometimes
it can help a little too much.

130
00:08:57.063 --> 00:09:00.051
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah no sometimes it
causes more problems than it's worth.

131
00:09:00.051 --> 00:09:02.035
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I will be honest this

132
00:09:02.035 --> 00:09:05.516
one has probably reason why it has three
and a half stars when it works and

133
00:09:05.516 --> 00:09:07.444
it does the right thing, it's great.

134
00:09:07.444 --> 00:09:11.880
Doesn't always do the right thing, I think
this one's currently turned off for me,

135
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.044
but it shows back up
every once in a while.

136
00:09:14.044 --> 00:09:16.178
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, if you turn it off,
you'll want it back.

137
00:09:16.178 --> 00:09:18.179
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah and
if you turn it on, you'll want it off.

138
00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:21.851
Yeah, I think that's fair color info,

139
00:09:21.851 --> 00:09:26.279
you hover over it,
you see the color info again?

140
00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:30.719
Again, my favorite ones we've got
some more extreme ones in a second,

141
00:09:30.719 --> 00:09:33.013
I'm starting with the subtle ones,

142
00:09:33.013 --> 00:09:38.127
I'm sure the ones from the crowdsource
ones will be a little bit more compelling.

143
00:09:38.127 --> 00:09:42.205
But the ones that I tend to
use are the simplest ones,

144
00:09:42.205 --> 00:09:46.190
mostly because before there
was setting sync, and

145
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:51.302
before there was the ability to
save all your settings with JSON.

146
00:09:51.302 --> 00:09:55.416
There was a period of time where
MacBooks had terrible keyboards, and

147
00:09:55.416 --> 00:09:58.636
I ended up with a new computer
from it every six months.

148
00:09:58.636 --> 00:09:59.950
And my tolerance for

149
00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:05.371
a heavily customized setup dropped in ways
that I've never fully recovered from.

150
00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:07.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: What's that Gremlins track?

151
00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.101
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay,
Gremlins tracker sounds cooler than it is.

152
00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:16.093
There are a lot of Unicode characters that
are kind of like not great in HTML or

153
00:10:16.093 --> 00:10:19.447
code, like a curly quote
versus a straight quote,

154
00:10:19.447 --> 00:10:22.186
there used to be an editor called BB Edit.

155
00:10:22.186 --> 00:10:23.812
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, I know them.

156
00:10:23.812 --> 00:10:24.812
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It was great, I mean,

157
00:10:24.812 --> 00:10:27.039
there still probably is
an editor called BB Edit.

158
00:10:27.039 --> 00:10:31.764
That was mean like, and it had a function
called Zap Gremlins, which would

159
00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:36.946
straighten all your weird curly quotes and
all that stuff and remove all of those.

160
00:10:36.946 --> 00:10:40.482
This one doesn't actually zap them,
it just, puts a little, monster dude.

161
00:10:40.482 --> 00:10:43.869
But it's also kind of built into Versus
code in a much more subtle way but

162
00:10:43.869 --> 00:10:46.593
there's no real way to zap them,
which is unfortunate.

163
00:10:46.593 --> 00:10:49.417
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: That usually happens when
you, copy paste every stuff, right?

164
00:10:49.417 --> 00:10:51.727
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah,
no it's when you got a little copy paste.

165
00:10:51.727 --> 00:10:56.351
Copy and pasting word, stuff from the
Internet or word, stuff from the Internet

166
00:10:56.351 --> 00:11:01.052
where the Blog then took the code straight
quotes and now your code doesn't work.

167
00:11:01.052 --> 00:11:05.783
That's really, at least now, instead of
losing like half an hour tracking that

168
00:11:05.783 --> 00:11:08.160
down on why your code doesn't compile.

169
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.438
You can at least do a little gremlin and
know what the problem is, since there's no

170
00:11:12.438 --> 00:11:16.158
way to zap them, though, and I don't
know how to make them on purpose so

171
00:11:16.158 --> 00:11:18.334
if I copy and paste something, we see it.

172
00:11:18.334 --> 00:11:23.863
What I do normally is I grab them
you'll see them a little in VS code,

173
00:11:23.863 --> 00:11:27.463
they're also in a little Amber rectangle.

174
00:11:27.463 --> 00:11:33.876
And then I multi curse of them, and I
make them go away, so that'll work, okay?

175
00:11:33.876 --> 00:11:37.176
So a few more that I
think are super cool or

176
00:11:37.176 --> 00:11:42.031
actually we're not gonna do
too much with GitHub copilot,

177
00:11:42.031 --> 00:11:46.901
because depending on who you are,
it may or may not be free.

178
00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:52.069
And I'm not gonna make you all subscribe
to something the depends on who you are,

179
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:56.933
which is there is some heuristic that
if you have enough open-source code,

180
00:11:56.933 --> 00:11:58.237
you get it for free.

181
00:11:58.237 --> 00:12:02.742
I work at a company that has an open
source product also all these repos that

182
00:12:02.742 --> 00:12:07.332
I do for Friday and Masters are all open,
so it looks I know I get it for free.

183
00:12:07.332 --> 00:12:10.728
But many people don't, but
there's a bunch of it's just,

184
00:12:10.728 --> 00:12:14.267
you've seen a lot of that kind of
auto complete or in a new file.

185
00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:16.053
I can ask you to do stuff, but

186
00:12:16.053 --> 00:12:20.311
there's a bunch of other really
interesting ones to take a look at.

187
00:12:20.311 --> 00:12:25.493
One of which is, there is a chatgpt

188
00:12:25.493 --> 00:12:30.855
extension that all that it does is,

189
00:12:30.855 --> 00:12:38.200
if you have the Mac app,
right, you can go here.

190
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.213
I know it's still in an update while
I'm like live coding, I'm not a rookie.

191
00:12:43.213 --> 00:12:45.629
You can hook it up to VS Code and

192
00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:51.154
then it has access to whatever
the files that are open in VS Code are.

193
00:12:51.154 --> 00:12:56.179
And then can either use this context or
edit the files for you with

194
00:12:56.179 --> 00:13:02.437
an ability to look at it first because the
stuff is not to be trusted all the time.

195
00:13:02.437 --> 00:13:07.430
So, like for instance,
if I took a real file here and I go back,

196
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:10.824
you can see that it has access to math.js,

197
00:13:10.824 --> 00:13:15.839
which is the active editor tab
that I had opened in that window.

198
00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:19.456
It will only do the ones that are like,
if you have two splits so

199
00:13:19.456 --> 00:13:22.668
it's actually these I got
a bunch of weird files here.

200
00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:26.029
You'll see that,
all I see is math here, but

201
00:13:26.029 --> 00:13:29.654
if I do a split with index
being the other active,

202
00:13:29.654 --> 00:13:34.983
editor tab in another editor group,
you'll see both of them, right?

203
00:13:34.983 --> 00:13:38.882
And now if I ask you questions,
I'm how do I refactor this?

204
00:13:38.882 --> 00:13:41.085
It knows what this is, right?

205
00:13:41.085 --> 00:13:42.263
It has access into Versus code.

206
00:13:42.263 --> 00:13:46.878
It can apply those changes and
that's cool and useful sometimes.

207
00:13:46.878 --> 00:13:50.729
There's a few other integrations
in there as well as you can see.

208
00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:51.490
Notes, notion,

209
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.704
you might see different things depending
on what apps you have installed.

210
00:13:54.704 --> 00:13:58.974
But if you do wanna, hook it into Versus
Code or you found yourself, copy and

211
00:13:58.974 --> 00:14:01.729
pasting stuff and
then copy and pasting it back.

212
00:14:01.729 --> 00:14:03.656
This is arguably a better workflow.
