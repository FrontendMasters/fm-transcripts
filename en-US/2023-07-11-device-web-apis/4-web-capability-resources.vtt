WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.038 --> 00:00:06.032
So your new friends, also to answer
the question on how to deal with this,

2
00:00:06.032 --> 00:00:08.170
are a couple of websites.

3
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.139
MDN, that it's on developer.mozilla.org,

4
00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.991
if you're a web developer,
okay, you probably know MDN.

5
00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:20.191
Just a quick update on this,
it says Mozilla,

6
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:25.035
because originally it was the official
documentation for Firefox and

7
00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:29.648
other Mozilla products, but
today that's not the case anymore.

8
00:00:29.648 --> 00:00:35.853
Even if it's inside Mozilla,
it's actually an a nonprofit

9
00:00:35.853 --> 00:00:40.598
organization that is trying to, let's say,

10
00:00:40.598 --> 00:00:46.560
fill the gap in the lack of
documentation for the web.

11
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.287
So it's trying to be the official
documentation for the web, and

12
00:00:50.287 --> 00:00:54.355
they hire people that are typing and
creating all the recommendation,

13
00:00:54.355 --> 00:00:57.230
not just for Firefox,
it's for every platform.

14
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.200
Okay, so it's like the official
recommendation for the web.

15
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.415
caniuse.com, in Can I Use you will
typically have a good understanding

16
00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:10.814
of which property is available on each
browser from which version, okay?

17
00:01:10.814 --> 00:01:14.395
We will see later some examples of that.

18
00:01:14.395 --> 00:01:17.155
Web.dev, a lot of capability APIs.

19
00:01:17.155 --> 00:01:23.316
You have the spec, but reading the spec
from the W3C as a web developer,

20
00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:27.861
it's kind of difficult
sometimes because the spec is

21
00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:32.230
typically targeting browser vendors.

22
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.209
So it explains how to implement the API,
not just how to use it.

23
00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:41.102
So web.dev includes a lot of
examples on capabilities,

24
00:01:41.102 --> 00:01:44.926
with code examples,
with explanations, real world.

25
00:01:44.926 --> 00:01:47.104
It's from the Google Chrome team, but

26
00:01:47.104 --> 00:01:50.471
the text that they're writing
is not really Google Chrome.

27
00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:54.328
And I know that because I published that
book that I mentioned before there, and

28
00:01:54.328 --> 00:01:57.161
there is no restriction,
everyone is publishing there.

29
00:01:57.161 --> 00:01:59.058
I'm not from Google and I publish there.

30
00:01:59.058 --> 00:02:03.722
And what you publish there
shouldn't be just Chrome

31
00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:07.644
documentation, so it's just for the web.

32
00:02:07.644 --> 00:02:13.026
For specifics on Safari for
iOS, Mac OS, and iPad OS,

33
00:02:13.026 --> 00:02:17.596
so we don't have
an official documentation.

34
00:02:17.596 --> 00:02:21.440
The closest thing that we
have is the webkits blog.

35
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.543
I would argue today that they're doing

36
00:02:26.543 --> 00:02:31.647
a pretty good job today from 2023,

37
00:02:31.647 --> 00:02:39.240
in creating at least,
let's say, good documentation.

38
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.325
They're doing a good effort.

39
00:02:41.325 --> 00:02:44.926
In the past 10 years or
15 years, it wasn't the case.

40
00:02:44.926 --> 00:02:50.801
In fact, my website or my blog for the dev
sometimes was the only resource to find

41
00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:56.501
what's new on Safari for web developers,
because I was doing a lot of tests,

42
00:02:56.501 --> 00:03:01.980
because they didn't document new APIs and
things like that.

43
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.342
Fortunately, they're doing that, so
I don't need to do that job anymore for

44
00:03:06.342 --> 00:03:07.410
free, by the way.

45
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.636
So the last one is chromestatus.com.

46
00:03:11.636 --> 00:03:15.895
Chromestatus.com is a place
where you will know which

47
00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:20.072
APIs are shipped with Chrome
on each version, okay?

48
00:03:20.072 --> 00:03:23.749
So you will know if Bluetooth API
is available from which version,

49
00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:26.980
if it's stable,
know which is in trial, okay?

50
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.687
Let me show you that one.

51
00:03:28.687 --> 00:03:32.179
Not everyone has experienced
working with that.

52
00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:36.617
So you can see at the time of
creating this video, this workshop,

53
00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:38.969
we are in stable in Chrome 113.

54
00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:43.741
And here you have things that were
deprecated, new APIs that were

55
00:03:43.741 --> 00:03:48.790
enabled by default, not just APIs,
also small features on CSS new.

56
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:57.066
What things were added in developer trial,
that's behind the flag, or origin trial.

57
00:03:57.066 --> 00:04:01.063
And here you can see the next version
that is currently in beta, or

58
00:04:01.063 --> 00:04:04.270
the other one that is currently canary,
the alpha.

59
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.083
And you can go back and check here.

60
00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:11.662
And also if you have a question on one
particular API, you go to All Features,

61
00:04:11.662 --> 00:04:12.870
and you can filter.

62
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.829
For example, you can say,
okay, let's say Bluetooth.

63
00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.090
And here you have Bluetooth sorts of API.

64
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.212
You can open the Web Bluetooth API.

65
00:04:22.212 --> 00:04:26.889
And you will see here, let me
increase the font size a little bit,

66
00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.115
some information about that.

67
00:04:29.115 --> 00:04:34.099
For example, in Chrome 56 this was on
Android, and Chrome OS, and Mac OS.

68
00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.870
And in Chrome 70,
it was added to Windows 10.

69
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.745
And you can see that today it's enabled
by default with some links samples for

70
00:04:41.745 --> 00:04:44.898
every API for
everything that they are shipping.

71
00:04:44.898 --> 00:04:49.789
So when you have a question, when you
have a problem, here you will typically

72
00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:55.520
find a lot of information, technical
information about that capability.

73
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.554
And of course, you and your friends
in this video, okay, this course,

74
00:04:59.554 --> 00:05:02.344
this workshop,
cuz we will cover a lot of API's.

75
00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.360
We also have Baseline.

76
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.988
So what's Baseline?

77
00:05:05.988 --> 00:05:10.247
Well, actually,
it's a multi-vendor new effort.

78
00:05:10.247 --> 00:05:14.648
It's originally from Google,
but it's multi-vendor, so

79
00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:17.441
it's actually also adding Mozilla and

80
00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:22.024
Apple to define a list of stable
capabilities for all browsers.

81
00:05:22.024 --> 00:05:26.580
So we weren't being seen as
the green list of ability.

82
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.879
So if an ability is green,
it's because it's safe to use today,

83
00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.959
because it's available on every
browser on every platform.

84
00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:40.760
Of course, that's never 100%, but
it's 99%, which is typically good enough.

85
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.902
So it's kind of a stable
version of the web.

86
00:05:44.902 --> 00:05:48.540
And we have one list per year,
starting with 2023.

87
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.487
And the idea is that every
year we'll have a new one,

88
00:05:52.487 --> 00:05:56.274
such as Baseline 2024, Baseline 2025.

89
00:05:56.274 --> 00:05:58.115
At the end of every year,

90
00:05:58.115 --> 00:06:03.043
we will have the list defined by
all the browsers for the next year.

91
00:06:03.043 --> 00:06:07.326
So by the end of 2024,
we will receive the list of Baseline 2025.

92
00:06:07.326 --> 00:06:12.557
And today, you're gonna start finding
baseline, for example on MDM,

93
00:06:12.557 --> 00:06:17.187
that website that we mentioned before,
where you see that, for

94
00:06:17.187 --> 00:06:22.060
example, in this case,
the grid CSS capability is Baseline.

95
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.490
So it's widely supported
on all the browsers.

96
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.220
Also, web.dev is listing
the Baseline features in many of

97
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.110
its articles talking
about many capabilities.
