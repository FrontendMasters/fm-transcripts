WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.238 --> 00:00:03.965
We also have, so
actually it's the same API,

2
00:00:03.965 --> 00:00:09.905
it's called Web Speech that has two parts,
recognition and synthesis.

3
00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:16.642
With synthesis,
we can make the web app speak, okay?

4
00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:20.279
It's not actually an AI voice or
something like that.

5
00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.966
It's the synthesis that
you have on your device.

6
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.044
It can be pretty good or pretty bad.

7
00:00:26.044 --> 00:00:30.322
It depends on the phone that you have and
the voices that you have installed there,

8
00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:31.323
but we will try it.

9
00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:34.584
But in this case, the web app will speak.

10
00:00:34.584 --> 00:00:38.410
We give the web app the text, for
example, in this case, that's Spanish.

11
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.700
And I can even specify I
want Spanish from Argentina.

12
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.570
es is Espanyol, Spanish,
AR is the Argentinian country.

13
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.250
Or you can say US with a Canadian
accent or with a British accent.

14
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.650
So you can specify that, the right volume,
and you say, hey, go and speak.

15
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.190
So the API is also pretty simple.

16
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.330
The part that is a little bit more
complicated is the selection of voices.

17
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.184
By default here, it's going to select
the closest voice for what you're asking.

18
00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:12.793
For example, maybe some devices that
don't have an Argentinian voice,

19
00:01:12.793 --> 00:01:16.451
they will take a Mexican one or
Spanish from Spain, okay?

20
00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:19.366
But it's Spanish at least,
it will take the closest one.

21
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:23.199
But also, we have an API to query
about the available voices,

22
00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:25.202
I will show you that in a second.

23
00:01:25.202 --> 00:01:29.301
And the voice depends on the device,
depends on the operating system,

24
00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:30.677
the voices available.

25
00:01:30.677 --> 00:01:35.050
So you can select a female voice or
a male voice, but

26
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.155
not by properties,
by just picking one from a list, okay?

27
00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:44.791
Well, I have a demo here that
we can see directly in action.

28
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:50.920
In fact, it was here,
the Web Speech Synthesis demo,

29
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.897
that one, where I can-
&gt;&gt; Call me Ishmael.

30
00:01:54.897 --> 00:01:57.439
Some years ago,
never mind how long precisely,

31
00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.041
having-
&gt;&gt; That's-

32
00:01:58.041 --> 00:01:59.168
&gt;&gt; Call me Ishmael,

33
00:01:59.168 --> 00:02:02.364
call me-
&gt;&gt; Come on, Samantha, stop.

34
00:02:02.364 --> 00:02:04.075
That's Samantha, okay?

35
00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:09.002
But here,
we have all the other possible, Alice,

36
00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:12.102
no, that's Italian, Boing.

37
00:02:12.102 --> 00:02:12.927
&gt;&gt; Call me, Ishmael.

38
00:02:12.927 --> 00:02:15.811
Some years ago,
never mind how long, precisely.

39
00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:17.750
&gt;&gt; Come on, that's Boing.

40
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.660
Anyway, you have for example a lot
of Spanish, Spanish Argentina,

41
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.937
Spanish Mexico.

42
00:02:23.937 --> 00:02:29.050
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] This is just
an API working with that.

43
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.716
And if I try this on Safari,
you will see different voices.

44
00:02:34.716 --> 00:02:40.131
The list of voices is different,
because it's a different browser.

45
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:41.997
Okay, let me see, yeah.

46
00:02:41.997 --> 00:02:47.462
&gt;&gt; So then on iOS, is it gonna be the same
across all of those browser platforms?

47
00:02:47.462 --> 00:02:50.192
&gt;&gt; Yeah, on iOS, yeah,
because it's the same browser.

48
00:02:50.192 --> 00:02:50.833
&gt;&gt; Okay.

49
00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:54.482
&gt;&gt; Remember that on iOS, every browser
is just Safari with a different scheme.

50
00:02:54.482 --> 00:02:56.030
So yeah, that's correct.

51
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.221
We have Flo
&gt;&gt; Call me Ishmael.

52
00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:03.406
So many years ago, never mind how long
precisely, having little or no money in-

53
00:03:03.406 --> 00:03:05.292
&gt;&gt; That sounds a little weird anyway.

54
00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:08.761
I know,
I think that the pitch here is by default.

55
00:03:08.761 --> 00:03:10.100
We can change this, okay?

56
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.254
&gt;&gt; Call me Ishmael.

57
00:03:11.254 --> 00:03:13.580
Some years ago,
never mind how long precisely,

58
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.922
&gt;&gt; So you can play with that,

59
00:03:14.922 --> 00:03:17.420
because it can sound better.

60
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.560
In our Cooking Master,
we already have that.

61
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.000
I'm not sure if you saw that.

62
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.997
It's that little icon that we have there.

63
00:03:26.997 --> 00:03:29.444
&gt;&gt; Thinly slice the red onion and
set aside.

64
00:03:29.444 --> 00:03:35.120
&gt;&gt; All right, and
also I think I have it with,

65
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.974
hey cooking, next.

66
00:03:37.974 --> 00:03:40.601
Was is it connected?

67
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:44.654
Let me check, hey cooking, next.

68
00:03:47.974 --> 00:03:52.962
This one is also replying my phone because
it says hey, but I didn't say hey, Google.

69
00:03:52.962 --> 00:03:55.420
I know why you are trying to speak.

70
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.351
Let me see.

71
00:03:57.351 --> 00:03:59.859
Hey cooking repeat.

72
00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.146
&gt;&gt; Add the sliced onions to
the pickling liquid and let sit for

73
00:04:02.146 --> 00:04:03.830
at least 30 minutes.

74
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:04.870
&gt;&gt; So now you're cooking.

75
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.167
What was the step again?

76
00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:07.150
Hey, cooking and repeat.

77
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.380
That's kind of the idea.

78
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.050
Anyway, so this is also pretty simple.

79
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.459
You don't need any permission.

80
00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.400
It will just use the speaker,
that's so easy.

81
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.424
The speaker is mute,
you won't hear a thing, okay?

82
00:04:22.424 --> 00:04:25.443
You can play a little bit with the audio.

83
00:04:25.443 --> 00:04:30.067
Of course, compared with the tools that we
have today where you can clone your own

84
00:04:30.067 --> 00:04:32.051
voice, yeah, it's not so good.

85
00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:35.546
For that, you have to call an API,
pay for it, and

86
00:04:35.546 --> 00:04:38.979
get in result on audio file that you play,
okay?

87
00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.560
But this is free, and
it's available there, okay?

88
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.396
That's speech synthesis, any question?

89
00:04:47.396 --> 00:04:51.195
Cut the fish fillets
into 2-inch wide strips.

90
00:04:51.195 --> 00:04:56.173
&gt;&gt; And by the way, if you try this
on Safari, let's try just for

91
00:04:56.173 --> 00:04:59.004
seeing, or an iPhone or Android,

92
00:04:59.004 --> 00:05:04.779
that you will see a different voice,
better or worse, I don't know.

93
00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:07.395
&gt;&gt; Thinly slice the red onion and
set aside.

94
00:05:07.395 --> 00:05:08.415
&gt;&gt; Looks better, right?

95
00:05:08.415 --> 00:05:11.445
The Safari one looks, let's try that one.

96
00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:16.640
&gt;&gt; In a small saucepan, combine the water,
vinegar, sugar, and salt.

97
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.113
Bring to a simmer, then remove from heat
&gt;&gt; Sounds better.

98
00:05:20.113 --> 00:05:21.779
So the voice on Safari sounds better.

99
00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:26.535
So if you try on the iPad,
it sounds like this one, like this voice.
