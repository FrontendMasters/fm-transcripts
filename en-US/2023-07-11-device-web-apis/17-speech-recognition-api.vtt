WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.153 --> 00:00:04.027
So now we are going to get into speech,
voice, and camera.

2
00:00:04.027 --> 00:00:07.051
So here we have the example on the camera.

3
00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:10.302
So let's start with a speech recognition.

4
00:00:10.302 --> 00:00:14.568
So I'm not sure if you know that,
but you can talk to websites.

5
00:00:14.568 --> 00:00:19.999
So there is an API that is green,
so it's available everywhere,

6
00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:26.142
that allows her to listen for the user's
voice and get a text transcript.

7
00:00:26.142 --> 00:00:30.457
Today, it works at least on Safari
only after a user gesture, and

8
00:00:30.457 --> 00:00:35.492
you will need microphone permission
because it will open your microphone.

9
00:00:35.492 --> 00:00:40.426
So you start a new speech recognition, you
can specify if you want continuous or not.

10
00:00:40.426 --> 00:00:45.158
If you say not, it will give you
the first phrase, and that's all,

11
00:00:45.158 --> 00:00:48.741
continuous will continue
giving you the answers.

12
00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:53.349
Also, sometimes you can even ask for
getting partial results,

13
00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:56.506
because when the voice is being processed,

14
00:00:56.506 --> 00:01:02.070
there are several steps going on that
is not completely useful, but anyway.

15
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.080
And when you get a result,
an event is going to be fire, and

16
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.798
you will get the text with
a percentage of confidence.

17
00:01:11.798 --> 00:01:15.242
So the API will tell you, well,

18
00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:19.973
I think that this is what he said or
she said.

19
00:01:19.973 --> 00:01:26.864
And I'm using this API in my cooking app,
because hey, we wanna go hands-free.

20
00:01:26.864 --> 00:01:29.473
So let's see it and then analyze the code.

21
00:01:31.813 --> 00:01:34.236
So going back to, do I have it now?

22
00:01:34.236 --> 00:01:37.174
Let me load that again, Cooking Masters.

23
00:01:37.174 --> 00:01:42.948
So I will actually get into
one of the things here and

24
00:01:42.948 --> 00:01:47.254
it will say, let me open the console.

25
00:01:47.254 --> 00:01:51.725
And before doing that,
within Capabilities,

26
00:01:51.725 --> 00:01:57.772
there is a section that's bluetooth,
we haven't seen that yet.

27
00:01:57.772 --> 00:02:01.458
We have a section here for
microphone, okay?

28
00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:05.036
Well, I will show you this
code in a minute, but

29
00:02:05.036 --> 00:02:09.975
here I already have a console.log,
so we can see this in action.

30
00:02:09.975 --> 00:02:14.570
And by the way, here are the keywords
that I'm looking for, hey cooking next,

31
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.951
hey cooking previous.

32
00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:19.737
By the way, I don't need hey cooking,
I can just say next.

33
00:02:19.737 --> 00:02:23.943
But just because I'm also
speaking here to you, okay,

34
00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:26.548
I don't want the app to get crazy.

35
00:02:26.548 --> 00:02:33.390
So let's see, let me open the console so
we can see the output of this.

36
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.261
So let's start cooking,
it's full screen but

37
00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:40.853
the DevTool is still there, which is okay.

38
00:02:40.853 --> 00:02:45.780
Safari doesn't have that option,
when Safari goes fullscreen, the DevTools

39
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.794
goes to a different desktop, which is
complicated for presentation purposes.

40
00:02:50.794 --> 00:02:52.772
So how to enable that?

41
00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:55.044
Well, there is a microphone icon there.

42
00:02:55.044 --> 00:03:01.774
So if I click there, it first ask me for
microphone permission.

43
00:03:01.774 --> 00:03:02.984
Can you see that at the top?

44
00:03:02.984 --> 00:03:05.283
I will say Allow, okay?

45
00:03:07.618 --> 00:03:09.065
And now, it's listening.

46
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.152
Can you see down there,
okay, in the console?

47
00:03:16.048 --> 00:03:22.130
And I can say, again, hey cooking next,

48
00:03:23.571 --> 00:03:28.053
Hey cooking next, hey cooking exit.

49
00:03:30.411 --> 00:03:33.634
It works, and it works pretty well, okay?

50
00:03:33.634 --> 00:03:37.611
[LAUGH] So for a cooking app,
it works pretty well.

51
00:03:37.611 --> 00:03:41.266
So the only thing you need
is you need to enable that.

52
00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:45.930
And then you can continue listening
forever while your fish is there,

53
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.550
can still hear in the user and the text.

54
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.393
And it also can receive texts
in different languages.

55
00:03:51.393 --> 00:03:54.498
Right now, it's English,
I'm not going to change everything here.

56
00:03:54.498 --> 00:04:00.107
But if I try it here and change that to
Spanish, that's the only language I know.

57
00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:03.259
So it's not gonna change anything,
but at least,

58
00:04:05.396 --> 00:04:11.886
[FOREIGN]
That's right, by the way.

59
00:04:11.886 --> 00:04:17.399
[FOREIGN] It works.

60
00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:21.118
By the way, how many languages,
which languages?

61
00:04:21.118 --> 00:04:26.338
Actually, that's not up to the spec,
that's up to the browser.

62
00:04:26.338 --> 00:04:29.697
And some browsers are reliant
on the OS services for that.

63
00:04:29.697 --> 00:04:32.658
So it's up to the browser,
up to the operating system.

64
00:04:32.658 --> 00:04:38.501
What you can know, you can get the list
of all the available languages as well.

65
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:43.012
So you can try different languages.

66
00:04:43.012 --> 00:04:47.903
Also in the list of options
that we have here in

67
00:04:47.903 --> 00:04:54.344
github.io/capabilities, if
you wanna play with this,

68
00:04:54.344 --> 00:04:58.745
we have this Web Speech Synthesis demo.

69
00:04:58.745 --> 00:05:02.952
Now, Speech Synthesis,
not yet, Recognition demo.

70
00:05:02.952 --> 00:05:07.118
Well, you can try also not just English,

71
00:05:07.118 --> 00:05:14.391
English from Nigeria with different
accent, or, no, Filipino.

72
00:05:14.391 --> 00:05:19.074
So those are all the languages that
are supported by this browser,

73
00:05:19.074 --> 00:05:20.923
that is, Chrome, okay?

74
00:05:20.923 --> 00:05:28.211
Yeah, I don't know, for Francois,
the only thing I know is [FOREIGN].

75
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:31.732
Yeah, that's the only French
you will get from me.

76
00:05:31.732 --> 00:05:34.147
But you can see, it works, right?

77
00:05:34.147 --> 00:05:38.591
So it works,
I know a little bit of Portuguese from,

78
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:43.898
[FOREIGN] Well,

79
00:05:43.898 --> 00:05:48.478
I think I need to restart, I don't think
it's, when you change that, this web app.

80
00:05:48.478 --> 00:05:52.186
Anyway, you got the idea, I don't know
Klingon, should try Klingon here.

81
00:05:52.186 --> 00:05:57.796
Anyway, say [FOREIGN],
that's thank you very much.

82
00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.088
Any question on speech recognition?

83
00:06:03.088 --> 00:06:07.357
I will show you the code, you have
it also, but let's review the code.

84
00:06:07.357 --> 00:06:12.039
It's not really complicated once
you understand what it's doing.

85
00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:19.644
The only warning here, I will go with that
in a second, is that it needs a prefix.

86
00:06:19.644 --> 00:06:21.902
That looks from the past, actually,

87
00:06:21.902 --> 00:06:25.795
I'm not sure if you have ever
encountered a prefixed API before.

88
00:06:25.795 --> 00:06:28.695
It was pretty common a few years ago.

89
00:06:28.695 --> 00:06:34.284
Today, we are going to see probably two
APIs that are still prefixed with WebKit.

90
00:06:34.284 --> 00:06:37.082
And by the way, I mean,
Chrome, is Chrome WebKit?

91
00:06:37.082 --> 00:06:41.692
Not or not anymore, but
it's still using that.

92
00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:45.560
So instead of creating
a new speech recognition,

93
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.527
we need to create a new
WebKit speech recognition.

94
00:06:49.527 --> 00:06:52.734
Then I'm saying, continuous true,
the language that I'm expecting.

95
00:06:52.734 --> 00:07:00.127
And then addEventListener for result,
another one for a start, stop, and error.

96
00:07:00.127 --> 00:07:04.939
So if you have a permission issue or
something happen, you will get into error.

97
00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:09.588
Start means we are ready to
start listening to the user.

98
00:07:09.588 --> 00:07:12.853
A stop is,
it's a stop because you have stopped it or

99
00:07:12.853 --> 00:07:17.620
because the user went to permissions,
stop the microphone, or whatever.

100
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.746
I don't know, but
you won't receive any more results.

101
00:07:20.746 --> 00:07:25.182
And then you have result,
when you check if it's a result,

102
00:07:25.182 --> 00:07:30.075
you get an array of results because
it's accumulating the text.

103
00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:33.826
So I'm always getting the last one,
that is, the new one,

104
00:07:33.826 --> 00:07:36.989
because in my case,
I'm looking for the phrase.

105
00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:42.727
Then I'm getting the confidence as
an attribute and the text, that's all.

106
00:07:42.727 --> 00:07:46.661
And in this case,
I'm removing a possible dot at the end and

107
00:07:46.661 --> 00:07:50.212
also trimming this because
sometimes it has spaces.

108
00:07:50.212 --> 00:07:54.703
And because it's a phrase, it's a
sentence, sometimes it ends with the dot.

109
00:07:54.703 --> 00:07:57.680
So in case you have a dot,
I'm removing the dot.

110
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.254
This depends on the browser
if it adds a dot or not, and

111
00:08:02.254 --> 00:08:06.841
then I'm checking based on what I hear,
I do things.

112
00:08:10.026 --> 00:08:12.783
And that's kind of all the API,

113
00:08:12.783 --> 00:08:17.699
it works on mobile devices,
iPhone, Android, iPads.

114
00:08:20.284 --> 00:08:23.028
Do you have any question?

115
00:08:23.028 --> 00:08:25.063
&gt;&gt; In regards to changing the language,

116
00:08:25.063 --> 00:08:28.758
is it still gonna work with if you
do Spanish while speaking English?

117
00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:32.412
It was have like-
&gt;&gt; Use the both at the same time or?

118
00:08:32.412 --> 00:08:36.751
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so if you have Spanish as
your designated language in the code but

119
00:08:36.751 --> 00:08:38.613
then you're speaking English.

120
00:08:38.613 --> 00:08:44.026
&gt;&gt; So if you set up their English and
then you speak in Spanish,

121
00:08:44.026 --> 00:08:49.563
it will take probably some words
with a very low confidence.

122
00:08:49.563 --> 00:08:54.026
Unless you are kind of doing,
instead of saying holla, you say holla.

123
00:08:54.026 --> 00:08:57.999
That is kind of an Englishy
version of holla.

124
00:08:57.999 --> 00:09:02.574
But if you don't do that kind of weird
part, yeah, it's not gonna work.

125
00:09:02.574 --> 00:09:06.748
So it's not multilanguage, you have to
specify to the API that you're switching

126
00:09:06.748 --> 00:09:10.270
languages to actually get the right
text with the right confidence.
