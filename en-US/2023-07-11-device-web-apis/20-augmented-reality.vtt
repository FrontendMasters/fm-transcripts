WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.977
Now, looking around the camera,
the next topic,

2
00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:08.832
that is a huge topic, so I'm just
going to take the most simple part

3
00:00:08.832 --> 00:00:13.270
is Augmented Reality that also
mixes with virtual reality.

4
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.840
So, Augmented Reality, AR or XR.

5
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.190
Today for the web, for web developers or
for web app developers,

6
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.410
there are many ways that we can use.

7
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.960
We can use WebXR, that's an API available
today on Chromium-based browsers,

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.850
but in Safari,
it's actually an experiment.

9
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.430
Let me prove that.

10
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.470
An experiment that is still not working.

11
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.929
When you walk through
experimental features,

12
00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.850
at the bottom, you have WebXR,
okay, a lot of WebXR experiments.

13
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.650
Why is that?

14
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.230
I mean, it's not 100% confirmed, but

15
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.960
we know that Apple is working
on some kind of headset.

16
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.080
So they're preparing Safari for
when that's ready, right?

17
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.562
That's kind of why it's coming.

18
00:01:00.562 --> 00:01:08.590
So with WebXR, it's a low-level API.

19
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.470
I will show you how it works in a second.

20
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.343
But instead of doing that, something
that is probably more straightforward Is

21
00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:20.207
to use a high-level solution for
augmented reality content.

22
00:01:20.207 --> 00:01:21.810
I will show you one in a second.

23
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.492
Talking about WebXR, the low-level API,
actually how the API is designed,

24
00:01:29.492 --> 00:01:35.440
is pretty similar to the Gamepad API
because it was designed at the same time.

25
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.665
In terms of how it looks like, I'm not
saying it's the same, but how it looks

26
00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:44.040
like, how the terms used within the API,
is pretty similar to the Gamepad API.

27
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.190
You can query about the devices available.

28
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.010
What's a device?

29
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.780
It can be a headset, or it can be
a headset where you put your phone in,

30
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.277
that they're kind of dead today, okay?

31
00:01:58.277 --> 00:02:01.360
Daydream, there were a lot
of projects around that, but

32
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.440
today no one is using those.

33
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.212
But on computers,
if you have a VR headset connected,

34
00:02:07.212 --> 00:02:10.410
then you can detect that
you have a VR headset.

35
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.550
You can also detect on
compatible devices 3D space.

36
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.024
So it can let you analyze
your space around you and

37
00:02:18.024 --> 00:02:21.450
give you a 3D model in JavaScript.

38
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.640
The pose of where you're looking at within
that virtual environment, depth sensing.

39
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.168
Again, this relies on the hardware
that you might have, or software,

40
00:02:32.168 --> 00:02:37.390
because I will show you that you can use
this even without devices with the camera.

41
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.800
And the API will also create vectors
representing movements of input controls.

42
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.501
So if you have an input control
where you were supposed to move into

43
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:52.347
a virtual environment,
it will give you the backdoor so

44
00:02:52.347 --> 00:02:56.553
you can apply that into your web GL or
web GPU environment.

45
00:02:56.553 --> 00:02:59.644
But that's complicated,
you need to get into VR.

46
00:02:59.644 --> 00:03:01.490
It's really complicated.

47
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.020
And also something, that's the last thing
they have added, lighting estimation.

48
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.374
So based on the real lighting,

49
00:03:07.374 --> 00:03:10.457
it can estimate the light that you
need to apply to virtual objects.

50
00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:16.259
And hit testing is for example, if you're
walking around and you have elements,

51
00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:20.895
if those elements will hit real tables,
real chairs, and so on.

52
00:03:20.895 --> 00:03:27.290
So working with the WebXR,
we're not going to get too deep with this.

53
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.231
I will show you something I think that is
simpler for the first approach to this,

54
00:03:33.231 --> 00:03:37.420
but you just called
navigator.xr.requestsession.

55
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.180
And there are three kinds of sessions
today available, it depends on the device.

56
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.602
Immersive-vr, that means you have
a headset for VR, immersive-ar,

57
00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:54.460
you have a headset that can also look
what is your real environment or inline.

58
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.230
Inline can be used with your phone
without any device attached.

59
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.180
Just using the camera and
sometimes some sensors from the camera,

60
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.810
it's actually a hardware.

61
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.296
So Apple has created a format
that is called AR Quick Look,

62
00:04:12.296 --> 00:04:19.181
Augmented Reality Quick Look,
I'm not sure if you have seen this before.

63
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:24.391
Where you create an anchor,
so a link with the rel ar and

64
00:04:24.391 --> 00:04:30.168
you point to a usdz file,
that is a 3D model with metadata for

65
00:04:30.168 --> 00:04:34.928
augmented reality such as
how that element fits in

66
00:04:34.928 --> 00:04:40.138
the real world,
such as the real size of that element,

67
00:04:40.138 --> 00:04:44.980
that 3D model doesn't count for
the real world.

68
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.156
Well, this is a 3D model
with more metadata.

69
00:04:49.156 --> 00:04:55.882
On Android and Chrome, instead of applying
this non standard way of doing things,

70
00:04:55.882 --> 00:05:00.120
they have created something
known as model viewer.

71
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.920
Model viewer is a web component
that you can add to your website.

72
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.023
And internally,
it will use the apple's implementation or

73
00:05:12.023 --> 00:05:14.930
WebXR to offer the same solution.

74
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.330
So it's a library, okay?

75
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.366
But internally,
it makes the same code compatible,

76
00:05:21.366 --> 00:05:24.140
the same model compatible with iOS and
Android.

77
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.688
Probably you don't understand
what that means yet, so

78
00:05:28.688 --> 00:05:31.130
let me show you what this is.

79
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.418
I have here the modelviewer.dev website,
let me refresh.

80
00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:38.944
So you see the experience.

81
00:05:38.944 --> 00:05:43.491
So the right experience is that
I am seeing that arm chair, and

82
00:05:43.491 --> 00:05:46.000
I can view that in my space.

83
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.420
Can you see that View in your space?

84
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.586
So View in your space,
see if though I'm in the Chrome, yeah,

85
00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:56.070
I'm in Chrome,
because I already granted permission.

86
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.810
I wanted to show you the permission for
that.

87
00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.220
Yeah, can you see that Permissions,
Augmented Reality is already allowed.

88
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.460
Let me reset it so
you see it from scratch.

89
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.106
So this is what you see,
that this website, so

90
00:06:11.106 --> 00:06:16.450
it's a capability that lets me
create a 3D map of my surroundings.

91
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.214
And we'll say, Allow.

92
00:06:20.293 --> 00:06:23.724
And now, probably you've
seen this on iPhone as well,

93
00:06:23.724 --> 00:06:27.374
where it's asking me to move around so
it can actually put,

94
00:06:27.374 --> 00:06:32.130
this is our real environment here in
front of the mouse parts, it looks nice.

95
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.110
It's actually pretty similar to
the real one you have there.

96
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.448
I can even rotate it, okay?

97
00:06:38.448 --> 00:06:42.957
And I feel is a real size of
that particular thing, okay?

98
00:06:42.957 --> 00:06:44.320
Pretty cool.

99
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.113
So well, this lesson,
it's Augmented Reality, but

100
00:06:48.113 --> 00:06:52.572
you don't need any device,
just a website pointing to a model.

101
00:06:52.572 --> 00:06:56.010
Also it depends on the phone,
it might have or not hit test.

102
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.480
If you have hit test, you will know
when you are hitting another element.

103
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.040
Not in this one, for example,
you can see it's hitting, but

104
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.902
it's not really hitting that.

105
00:07:04.902 --> 00:07:10.468
But anyway, you can try the different
examples here, go back.

106
00:07:10.468 --> 00:07:15.110
There are more elements that you can try,
and also you can see this.

107
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:20.310
That's if you go to AR,
I can put an astronaut here as well.

108
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:26.860
He can continue the workshop or
maybe he is a she, I don't know.

109
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.661
There you have it.

110
00:07:30.877 --> 00:07:34.520
This option can only be viewed in
true scale, it's too big.

111
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:41.530
Anyway, for that, that's a capability and
it's available on iOS and Android as well.

112
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.552
To make it compatible with both platforms,

113
00:07:44.552 --> 00:07:48.430
the simplest way to do that
is to use this library.

114
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:54.560
Internally, it will use WebXR ON Android
or the Safari solution for iPhone.

115
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.900
And you can reuse the same model,
the same file.

116
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.990
These things are really nice for
something really quick.

117
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.795
But having your phone like this,
like with this pose for a while,

118
00:08:06.795 --> 00:08:09.170
it's a little bit annoying.

119
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:15.070
So it works, it's nice, but
no more than one minute doing this.

120
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.090
So you don't wanna do that.

121
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.110
For that, you wanna a headset.

122
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:22.236
So if you have a headset, yeah, that's
much better because you don't need to

123
00:08:22.236 --> 00:08:27.298
have your hand like this or with an iPad
with two hands doing this all the time.

124
00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:29.400
You will get tired pretty easily.

125
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:34.837
So it looks nice, I mean, it's a geeky
thing, but then when you try it,

126
00:08:34.837 --> 00:08:38.689
it's just for
a couple of seconds and that's all.

127
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.352
A headset will change the landscape a lot.

128
00:08:43.352 --> 00:08:47.773
Here you have another example
I did a couple of months ago.

129
00:08:47.773 --> 00:08:51.790
I don't know which country, it was
a hotel, that's the only thing I remember.

130
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.870
But it works pretty well.

131
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.990
As you can see, it looks really well.

132
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.773
That was iPhone I think,
and that's an animation, so

133
00:09:02.773 --> 00:09:05.744
everything can be moving, as you can see.

134
00:09:07.174 --> 00:09:10.438
So it can be an animation
on the fly that you

135
00:09:10.438 --> 00:09:15.374
receive from the network that
is created by another user.

136
00:09:15.374 --> 00:09:17.044
So technically, everything is there.
