1
00:00:00.205 --> 00:00:02.268
So we were talking about like green API's.

2
00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:06.200
That I was saying that most of
those API's are chromium based.

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.758
So Google Chrome and
Microsoft Edge mainly, okay?

4
00:00:10.758 --> 00:00:13.730
There are one or two that are Safari only.

5
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.944
But it's just the exception, not the rule.

6
00:00:15.944 --> 00:00:18.596
There we have yellow API's.

7
00:00:18.596 --> 00:00:21.949
In this case,
these API's are not yet mature.

8
00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.938
That means that, for example,
they might change in the future.

9
00:00:24.938 --> 00:00:26.649
I mean, the API itself.

10
00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:30.400
The name of the function,
how you use the API might change.

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.068
And sometimes even today you have
to enable a flag, developer flag,

12
00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:40.580
or subscribe into something
known as an origin trial.

13
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.893
By the way in the web dev,
then this free book for you there

14
00:00:45.893 --> 00:00:53.103
is a section on experimental feature
that explains more on on origin trials.

15
00:00:53.103 --> 00:00:55.218
Here you have this.

16
00:00:55.218 --> 00:01:00.592
But actually I want to show you this
Origin Trials for Chrome and for Edge.

17
00:01:00.592 --> 00:01:02.545
This is an idea on Chromium, actually.

18
00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:04.217
So it's not on Safari.

19
00:01:04.217 --> 00:01:11.371
On Safari, what you have, both Safari
on iPhone and Safari on the Mac.

20
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.757
If you go to the Develop menu,

21
00:01:13.757 --> 00:01:19.777
there is an Experimental Features
sub-menu, for those of you on the Mac.

22
00:01:19.777 --> 00:01:25.849
Here, you can enable some features or
some APIs that are still experimental.

23
00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:31.033
So if you want to experiment with them,
you can you go and enable that, okay?

24
00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:34.629
So you are you if you want to use it in
your website, your users have to go and

25
00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:35.558
enable that okay.

26
00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:40.570
So it chat for playing just for
fun, not yet for production.

27
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.215
But origin, trials on the other on
the other hand, is a different idea.

28
00:01:45.215 --> 00:01:47.672
Of course of chrome also have flag.

29
00:01:47.672 --> 00:01:51.755
So you can go to Chrome flags or
edge flags, and

30
00:01:51.755 --> 00:01:56.804
also you can enable experimental
features using a flag.

31
00:01:56.804 --> 00:01:59.628
This is like the Safari version.

32
00:01:59.628 --> 00:02:05.263
But something that is more interesting
from the Chromium team is origin trials.

33
00:02:05.263 --> 00:02:06.079
Why?

34
00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.926
Because sometimes testing
your APIs in the lab, so

35
00:02:09.926 --> 00:02:13.334
in your computer, If it's not good enough.

36
00:02:13.334 --> 00:02:18.966
You actually need real users to use
the feature to see how that works.

37
00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:24.622
If it's working properly or not,
an origin trial is a way to do that.

38
00:02:24.622 --> 00:02:28.636
They do for you in trials,
when you can, for example,

39
00:02:28.636 --> 00:02:31.180
in the Chrome or even trials link.

40
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.308
You can subscribe to an origin trial.

41
00:02:36.308 --> 00:02:42.631
Firefox also has origin trials now,
that's kinda new, they don't have a lot.

42
00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:44.270
But what's the deal?

43
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.905
You actually need to take
part in an origin trial.

44
00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:48.844
What's that?

45
00:02:48.844 --> 00:02:50.968
You need to subscribe with a form.

46
00:02:50.968 --> 00:02:55.802
So you need to go to this
website of active trials.

47
00:02:55.802 --> 00:03:00.349
And you will see all the APIs
that are available for trial.

48
00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.229
For example, let's say I will pick
just one that we can understand.

49
00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:06.897
The Popover API.

50
00:03:06.897 --> 00:03:11.379
This is an API that can be used to build
UI elements that are displayed on top of

51
00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.002
all the other web app APIs.

52
00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:18.128
It's like a pop-up, but
instead of using a div Like an API that

53
00:03:18.128 --> 00:03:24.052
will offer us like a pop-up within
the same window, but more natively.

54
00:03:24.052 --> 00:03:25.281
It's new.

55
00:03:25.281 --> 00:03:29.599
It's until August 2023, the trial.

56
00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.319
So if you want to try this with your
users, of course, your Chrome users.

57
00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.636
You have to go here and register.

58
00:03:36.636 --> 00:03:41.703
So you select that one again,
pop over API register,

59
00:03:41.703 --> 00:03:44.861
and what you need is your origin.

60
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:46.414
What's your origin?

61
00:03:46.414 --> 00:03:48.777
Briefly, your domain.

62
00:03:48.777 --> 00:03:50.530
So I can go here and say.

63
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.238
I want this from front and masters.com.

64
00:03:53.238 --> 00:03:56.892
If you have subdomains,
you need to enable this.

65
00:03:56.892 --> 00:03:58.241
How many pageviews?

66
00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:01.450
This is just for stats, so
it's not going to make any difference.

67
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.239
When you register this, you need to be
logged in with your Google account.

68
00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.914
You will receive a token.

69
00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:10.338
I can even try this.

70
00:04:13.674 --> 00:04:19.503
I have an error,
I need to add the HTTPS thing, register.

71
00:04:19.503 --> 00:04:22.113
And what I have is a token.

72
00:04:22.113 --> 00:04:24.557
What do I need to do with that token?

73
00:04:24.557 --> 00:04:30.594
You can add a meta tag in your HTML or
an HTTP header for your HTML.

74
00:04:30.594 --> 00:04:33.602
So from now on, if I add that meta tag,

75
00:04:33.602 --> 00:04:39.343
here you have a learn more to that
explains how to add the meta tag, okay?

76
00:04:39.343 --> 00:04:43.937
So users on Chrome,
that they have a version supporting

77
00:04:43.937 --> 00:04:48.249
that origin trial,
they will be able to use the API.

78
00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:53.859
So when those those user will get
into your website into your origin,

79
00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:56.090
the API will be available.

80
00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.341
So that's an origin trial is a way to
test on with real users, your API's.

81
00:05:02.341 --> 00:05:04.545
But the original trial has an end date.

82
00:05:04.545 --> 00:05:09.105
That means that at that point,
that API will not be there anymore.

83
00:05:09.105 --> 00:05:12.077
There are two possibilities,
actually, three possibilities.

84
00:05:12.077 --> 00:05:17.699
The API after the trial ends may
be shipped as an stable API.

85
00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:24.455
Maybe they're going to iterate on that,
so they will change the the spec.

86
00:05:24.455 --> 00:05:27.848
They will change the API and
they will create another origin trial.

87
00:05:27.848 --> 00:05:29.448
Or maybe they say, you know what?

88
00:05:29.448 --> 00:05:31.971
It doesn't work with a lie kid.

89
00:05:31.971 --> 00:05:34.134
We didn't have enough feedback.

90
00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:35.521
So we're going to remove that.

91
00:05:35.521 --> 00:05:38.657
So that API will never reach stable.

92
00:05:38.657 --> 00:05:43.827
Okay, but have in mind that if
you want to be on the edge of

93
00:05:43.827 --> 00:05:51.320
capability API's ,you can always get
into this website and see what's there.

94
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.844
And by the way, as I mentioned,
it's not just Chrome.

95
00:05:55.844 --> 00:06:04.159
You also have Edge that are doing a lot
of ocean trials on mostly for Windows.

96
00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:08.518
So they are focusing on adding
more features on desktop.

97
00:06:08.518 --> 00:06:10.049
On desktop PWA, so

98
00:06:10.049 --> 00:06:15.612
they have some specific origin trials
that are just for Edge as well.
