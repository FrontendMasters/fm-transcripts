1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.700
So let's start with
the category of APIs now,

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.970
talking about sensors,
geolocation, and input devices.

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.790
So this is a suite of APIs
that we will cover now.

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.780
Let's start with sensors.

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.990
So first, what's a sensor?

6
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.806
A sensor is a chipset that is available
in one particular device that

7
00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:25.790
is measuring something, okay?

8
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.070
So we have different kinds of
sensors today on different devices.

9
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.800
But talking about the API first, we will
have different APIs and different sensors.

10
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.650
So mostly on mobile devices,
we have a lot of sensors.

11
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.550
Typically, we have
an accelerometer on three axes.

12
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.090
The accelerometer is a sensor
that is sensing acceleration.

13
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.170
Question for you.

14
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.220
Do I have acceleration right now?

15
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.833
In this phone?

16
00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:54.782
&gt;&gt; Yes.

17
00:00:54.782 --> 00:00:55.700
&gt;&gt; Yes.

18
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.260
Which acceleration?

19
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.474
&gt;&gt; Down.
&gt;&gt; Gravity.

20
00:00:58.474 --> 00:01:00.060
Down on one axis.

21
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.230
If I have the phone upside down.

22
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.690
It's on the same axis but negative value.

23
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.380
And based on where I am,
that's acceleration.

24
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.940
Sometimes you can ask for
acceleration, removing the gravity.

25
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.500
So sometimes some API's
will let you do that.

26
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.386
So you can get the gravity or not, but
you can also go over the gravity so

27
00:01:22.386 --> 00:01:26.584
you can actually move it harder,
you can apply more force to it, and

28
00:01:26.584 --> 00:01:28.930
you can read that with JavaScript.

29
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.820
That actually was, after geolocation,
probably the next API that

30
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.050
appear in history on the web,
how to read the accelerometer.

31
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.220
So why do you wanna use the accelerometer?

32
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.580
We will see some examples in a minute.

33
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.390
But typically some effects to know
how the user is using the phone.

34
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.290
Because you can know, for
example, if you are like this,

35
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.390
you can know if you are maybe laying
down a bed looking at the phone because

36
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.290
the gravity is different on different axes
based on how are you using your phone and

37
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.610
based on that you can
change something in your app.

38
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.810
Gyroscope that's another sensor I think on
the iPhone, it was the iPhone 4 or 3GS.

39
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.915
I don't remember now,
the first one that added gyroscope.

40
00:02:25.915 --> 00:02:30.690
With gyroscope we can know how
do we have the phone like this?

41
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.492
In this case, the force is the same
on one axis, the same force, but

42
00:02:35.492 --> 00:02:37.870
I'm changing the angle, okay?

43
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.070
Something that I'm simplifying this.

44
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.690
But with gyroscope we can
also read the values.

45
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.750
On accelerometer,
we get three axes, X, Y, and Z.

46
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.342
And the current value of
acceleration on each axis.

47
00:02:51.342 --> 00:02:56.390
On gyroscope, we typically get alpha,
beta and gamma.

48
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.710
Also three values for gyroscope.

49
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.670
We also have magnetometer
that is kind of the compass.

50
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.540
Okay, so it's also a sensor.

51
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.300
It's not typically something that comes
with a GPS or something like that.

52
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.780
It's a different sensor.

53
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.290
Okay, so if you have a compass app in
your phone, it's using the magnetometer.

54
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.670
And you can read that
also in your website.

55
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.490
Proximity sensor.

56
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.880
A proximity sensor will detect if
you have the phone like this, or

57
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.980
if I have the phone like that,
it knows proximity to the user.

58
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.243
Because, I mean, if it's a game, and then
you realize that the user is doing this,

59
00:03:44.243 --> 00:03:46.370
you should pause the game probably.

60
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.619
It depends on the game but
that's the proximity sensor.

61
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.370
Light sensor.

62
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.999
So the light sensor will
measure the light in looks and

63
00:03:55.999 --> 00:04:00.090
it will detect how much light
do you have in the room.

64
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.064
So based on that, for example,
you can change the theme color,

65
00:04:04.064 --> 00:04:05.690
okay, things like that.

66
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.300
So you can swap from dark to light or

67
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.900
something like that
because you can read that.

68
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.560
And there are more, so more are applying.

69
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.250
These are the ones that are currently
available on the web, but

70
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.970
now you have humidity sensors as well,
okay?

71
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.460
On some devices, on Samsung devices,
they have a humidity sensor.

72
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.980
Altimeter, the iPhone has an altimeter,
also the watch.

73
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.513
That's how we can measure if you're
using a stairs, if you're climbing.

74
00:04:38.513 --> 00:04:44.395
So those are the sensors and you need
to pick which sensors do you want,

75
00:04:44.395 --> 00:04:51.230
do you need and there are typically
two ways to consume them on the web.

76
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.640
So we started with the first API.

77
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.619
This is kind of the weird,
because we have two ways not one.

78
00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:04.880
We have all API's that actually
were kinda created by Apple.

79
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.180
Okay, and
the rest Chrome basically cloned them.

80
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.032
So Safari was the one that was
pushing the boundaries are the time.

81
00:05:12.032 --> 00:05:15.907
I'm talking about 2009
something like that and

82
00:05:15.907 --> 00:05:19.087
in this case we are talking
about DOM APIs.

83
00:05:19.087 --> 00:05:21.618
I will show you the code in a minute and

84
00:05:21.618 --> 00:05:25.879
this is the only API available
still today on iPhones, okay?

85
00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:30.774
So if you wanna do this on iPhones,
you'd still need to use the old API's.

86
00:05:30.774 --> 00:05:35.862
But also we have another API called
sensor or generic sensor API

87
00:05:35.862 --> 00:05:40.854
that is a new API promise based so
it's not just the DOM event,

88
00:05:40.854 --> 00:05:44.793
the global DOM event but
it's not yet in Safari.

89
00:05:44.793 --> 00:05:45.774
Will it be?

90
00:05:45.774 --> 00:05:48.064
Who knows, okay?

91
00:05:48.064 --> 00:05:53.312
It's not today,
I didn't see it in the words, right?

92
00:05:53.312 --> 00:05:58.710
They should implement because if they have
the old API, I mean, they're close to that.
