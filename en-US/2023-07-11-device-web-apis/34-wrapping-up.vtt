WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.053 --> 00:00:06.734
Well, that's the end of the 36 APIs
that I wanna cover as capabilities.

2
00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:10.931
But there are still more capabilities
that we are not covering today.

3
00:00:10.931 --> 00:00:13.043
But I wanna mention them as well,

4
00:00:13.043 --> 00:00:17.201
in case you wanna get more
information later after the workshop.

5
00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:22.789
That there are more experimental or
really new, for example, EyeDropper.

6
00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.789
With EyeDropper you can actually
let the user pick a color

7
00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.547
from the screen, there is an API for that.

8
00:00:31.547 --> 00:00:34.412
Compression Streams, so you can zip and

9
00:00:34.412 --> 00:00:38.886
unzip content client-side
without any additional library.

10
00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:43.493
WebGPU, that will let you
talk directly to your GPU and

11
00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:47.399
create really high
performance 3D content or

12
00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.119
2D content, more performant than WebGL.

13
00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:56.476
View Transitions API,
this one is really cool.

14
00:00:56.476 --> 00:01:01.473
One of the problem of multi-page
applications, so having different HTMLs,

15
00:01:01.473 --> 00:01:04.501
is that when you pass from
one HTML to the other,

16
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:08.002
you don't have a nice
transition like on native apps.

17
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:13.327
When you pass from one view or one screen
to another one, you don't see a page load.

18
00:01:13.327 --> 00:01:19.046
You see an animation,
it can be this animation from here.

19
00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:23.774
Well, the idea is to bring
something similar to the web.

20
00:01:23.774 --> 00:01:31.776
Compute Pressure, that will detect when
your JavaScript is actually on compute.

21
00:01:31.776 --> 00:01:32.360
In fact,

22
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.481
it's actually telling you when the CPU of
that computer is getting into pressure.

23
00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:41.964
Say, hey, be careful,
because the CPU, I mean,

24
00:01:41.964 --> 00:01:48.448
we are rendering an 8K video, so
then you can decide not to do some stuff.

25
00:01:48.448 --> 00:01:53.132
Popover, we already mentioned
that as our example for,

26
00:01:53.132 --> 00:01:58.118
remember origin trials,
we were using that one, Popover.

27
00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:01.550
Digital Goods API, this is for PWAs.

28
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.196
PWAs on Android that you publish
in the App Store can use

29
00:02:06.196 --> 00:02:10.338
that API to charge users for
subscriptions or for

30
00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:14.592
additional content using
in-app purchase API.

31
00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:17.956
So using the money that
you have on the store.

32
00:02:19.674 --> 00:02:22.833
Web Transport is another
transport protocol.

33
00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:28.645
Picture in Picture, so for video,
you can continue rendering content and

34
00:02:28.645 --> 00:02:34.652
the video in Picture in Picture even if
the user is getting out of the browser.

35
00:02:34.652 --> 00:02:38.850
The Presentation API,
that will help, for example,

36
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.512
making a presentation in
an external display or an Apple TV.

37
00:02:43.512 --> 00:02:48.193
Screen Recorder, and there are more.

38
00:02:48.193 --> 00:02:52.216
So you can see it's an infinite
list of capabilities.

39
00:02:52.216 --> 00:02:57.641
So today we've covered the basics
of what the web capability is,

40
00:02:57.641 --> 00:03:01.498
the idea of the most
important capabilities.

41
00:03:01.498 --> 00:03:06.306
The basic ones that we didn't cover,
I gave you links to continue your training

42
00:03:06.306 --> 00:03:10.845
on different capabilities and
other workshops here at Frontend Masters.

43
00:03:10.845 --> 00:03:13.705
We've seen how permission and
security works.

44
00:03:13.705 --> 00:03:18.721
Compatibility, that for a lot of
APIs that we have mentioned today,

45
00:03:18.721 --> 00:03:22.710
it works on Safari, on Android,
on iOS, and Chrome.

46
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.344
For others, it depends.

47
00:03:25.344 --> 00:03:30.938
Then we get into API for sensors,
location, and input, such as multi-touch.

48
00:03:30.938 --> 00:03:34.848
Then speech, voice, and
camera, hardware and devices.

49
00:03:34.848 --> 00:03:38.407
And finally integration with
the operating system, and

50
00:03:38.407 --> 00:03:41.235
some of them are actually
PWA capabilities.

51
00:03:41.235 --> 00:03:45.317
So I hope it was useful for you and
you can use at least one or

52
00:03:45.317 --> 00:03:48.566
two of the APIs of the 36
that we mentioned.

53
00:03:48.566 --> 00:03:51.709
And now you know the power of the web,
okay?

54
00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.228
That there are a lot of things that
you can do with a web that maybe you

55
00:03:56.228 --> 00:03:59.229
didn't know before, okay, so thank you.

56
00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:04.065
