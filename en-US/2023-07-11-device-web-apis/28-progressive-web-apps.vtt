WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.956
I'm going to talk about OS integration.

2
00:00:02.956 --> 00:00:07.748
Not about hardware,
it's more about how we can integrate and

3
00:00:07.748 --> 00:00:13.090
make things better from our website or
web app to the operating system.

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.820
So first, we're going to start
talking about how to manage Windows.

5
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.306
And by the way,
some of the things that we will see here,

6
00:00:22.306 --> 00:00:28.340
if not most of the things,
are suitable for installable PWAs.

7
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.280
So web apps or websites that you
install and then when you install them,

8
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.450
they look and
act like any other app in the system.

9
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.176
So just quickly,
in case you haven't played with that,

10
00:00:45.394 --> 00:00:50.362
You have a full workshop,
a full course here at Frontend Masters

11
00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:55.158
that I delivered on PWAs,
goes from a scratch a progressive web app.

12
00:00:55.158 --> 00:01:00.950
But just to show you one in action,
let me try for example a Squoosh.

13
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.235
So when I'm going through Squoosh,

14
00:01:03.235 --> 00:01:08.100
Squoosh is a web app that will let
you convert images between formats.

15
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.590
You can drag and drop an image in JPEG or
PNG or pick one of these images from here.

16
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.610
And it's an editor where
you can compress these and

17
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.580
convert these even to new formats such as
WebP or AVIF, and then you download this.

18
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.590
And here you will see how much how much
space did you save from the original one.

19
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.940
And you can see here the quality,
if it's the same or not.

20
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.180
Anyway, it's a web app, it's pure
JavaScript, and everything is client side.

21
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.430
It's not like it's uploading
the images to a server.

22
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.369
Everything is JavaScript.

23
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.659
And all the codec and
decodec part is web assembly natively,

24
00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.310
but there is something different here.

25
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.970
We have that icon in Google Chrome and
also I have an install in Squoosh menu.

26
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.204
So if I click on both,
I can install an app.

27
00:02:05.204 --> 00:02:07.260
Is it coming from the Store?

28
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.410
Nope.

29
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.490
If I install the app, now I have
an Squoosh app directly in my computer.

30
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.540
It has its own title bar.

31
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.360
It appears in the operating
system as Squoosh not as Chrome.

32
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.930
And the Alt tab as was well,
and it appears here.

33
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.782
On Windows, it's in the Start Menu or

34
00:02:31.782 --> 00:02:36.340
Start Screen, and
it looks like any other app in the system.

35
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.390
And it's not just on desktop,
it also works on mobile.

36
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.020
So I can open an iOS simulator.

37
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.350
So for example, I'm here, On iOS,

38
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.219
I will go to a squoosh.app, and

39
00:02:54.219 --> 00:03:00.190
I can install on iOS through
the Share screen, add to Home Screen.

40
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.690
And now I have an icon on
the Home Screen that I can open.

41
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.120
And it's full screen.

42
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.100
I'm not in Safari anymore.

43
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.140
And it looks like this Squoosh app,
not Safari.

44
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.730
Did it come from the App Store?

45
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.020
No.

46
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.782
In fact, I can publish apps for iOS or

47
00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:23.430
iPad iOS, they're not following
the rules of the App Store.

48
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.220
That they don't need to follow the rules,
such as business rules, okay?

49
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.291
It's just a website with some kind
of asteroids that was installed,

50
00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:35.910
it can work offline.

51
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.940
And now at the OS level,
it looks like any other app in the system.

52
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.570
Something similar for Android.

53
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.600
Let's go to Squoosh.

54
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.946
The same app, the same PWA.

55
00:03:47.946 --> 00:03:53.112
When I'm here, first, you can see there is
an Install button directly in the HTML.

56
00:03:53.112 --> 00:03:58.816
I can click the Install button and
I have a very nice install dialog,

57
00:03:58.816 --> 00:04:03.570
I can see the screenshots,
and I can hit install.

58
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.440
And now it's installing the app.

59
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.500
This is actually compiling an APK,
an Android package on the Cloud for me.

60
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.240
And when it's done,
I will get the notification that is done.

61
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.350
And I will receive the Squoosh
app installed there.

62
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.410
I can search for Squoosh.

63
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.990
It's there, and I can open the app.

64
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.790
And it's an Android standalone
application now, as with iOS.

65
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.340
It looks like the Squoosh app.

66
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.524
That's a progressive web app, okay?

67
00:04:35.524 --> 00:04:40.326
It's a website that is using other
capability API's that we didn't

68
00:04:40.326 --> 00:04:42.574
go over today to make that work.

69
00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:46.490
Do you have any quick question
on that before moving on?

70
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.225
&gt;&gt; There's a lot of apps that sometimes
are not available on the Apple App Store,

71
00:04:54.225 --> 00:04:59.244
why do you think they're,
they don't have an APK like this if it's,

72
00:04:59.244 --> 00:05:03.095
this looks like a simple thing for
users to do as well.

73
00:05:03.095 --> 00:05:08.425
&gt;&gt; So [COUGH] the question is around
why don't we see more pWS out there.

74
00:05:08.425 --> 00:05:11.995
I think you have to do a lot there,
I think there are two reasons.

75
00:05:11.995 --> 00:05:15.170
The first one is that,
it's a business decision.

76
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.420
So a lot of people,
they can get more business,

77
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.280
let's say more bad business
from the App Store.

78
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.586
So they can track you more, okay?

79
00:05:24.586 --> 00:05:31.070
The thought they prefer, I mean,
TikTok has a PWA, Twitter has a PWA.

80
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.612
But they also have the native apps, and
they promote the native apps not the PWA.

81
00:05:35.612 --> 00:05:40.408
And the PWAs are pretty good, they're pretty
performant, they have the same services,

82
00:05:40.408 --> 00:05:44.348
but, yeah, they cannot listen in
the background what you're doing,

83
00:05:44.348 --> 00:05:47.255
there are a lot of things
that they cannot do as a PWA.

84
00:05:47.255 --> 00:05:50.928
So it's there, they're pretty good,
but from a business decision,

85
00:05:50.928 --> 00:05:54.130
they prefer to promote
the App Store version.

86
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.610
And that's not for all the companies.

87
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.820
There were also problems with PWAs and
Apple.

88
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.594
By the way,
Apple kind of invented the PWA idea, but

89
00:06:04.594 --> 00:06:07.380
that was before they
created the App Store.

90
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.034
Steve Jobs promoted
the idea without that name,

91
00:06:11.034 --> 00:06:16.400
it was called Home Screen web apps,
but it was just the same idea.

92
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.291
In fact, Chrome cloned that idea and
improved that idea, but

93
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:25.713
Apple for a while, for
many years, maybe the last six,

94
00:06:25.713 --> 00:06:29.970
seven years,
they didn't promote that a lot.

95
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.661
It was very buggy, and they were
not implementing some API such as

96
00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:37.577
Web Push that was kind of must for PWA.

97
00:06:37.577 --> 00:06:40.809
A lot of us were saying,
if I don't have push on iOS,

98
00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:44.830
then I'm not going to spend
too much time on that.

99
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.804
So I think that that's another reason
because a lot of companies didn't make

100
00:06:49.804 --> 00:06:52.560
the decision to go fully on PWA's.

101
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.260
Now we have Push on iOS, and
now the engine is becoming better.

102
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.110
And Apple is like working on the problems.

103
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.870
We'll see, okay.

104
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.609
But, yeah, it's more around business,
it's not a technical decision.

105
00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:10.231
But it's also true that users
sometimes don't know about this.

106
00:07:10.231 --> 00:07:12.578
Maybe they shouldn't care, okay, but

107
00:07:12.578 --> 00:07:16.040
they don't know that you can
install an app from a browser.

108
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.970
Okay, well now you know.

109
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.368
And now we are going to see,
most of the time,

110
00:07:24.368 --> 00:07:28.574
is our advantages that
we have when we are PWA.
