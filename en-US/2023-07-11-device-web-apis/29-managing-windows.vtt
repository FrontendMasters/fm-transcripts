00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.995
But because now when we are a PWA,
now we have our own window,

2
00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:08.190
we're not in a browser tab.

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.560
So, we can manage Windows
in a different way.

4
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.268
I'm not sure how many of you were on
the web when that browser was there,

5
00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:18.087
that's Netscape 1.0.

6
00:00:18.087 --> 00:00:20.329
I actually started with Netscape 2.0.

7
00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.470
So I'm not so well.

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.530
On that time, we didn't have tabs.

9
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.880
Everything was a window.

10
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.860
And from that time and even IE, that's
IE3, there was a way to move windows.

11
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.160
Window.moveTo, resizeTo, open, and
the two, they are kind of dead.

12
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.970
You cannot move the window from JavaScript
because you don't own the window.

13
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.310
There are other tabs in the window,
in the Chrome window or the Safari window.

14
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.205
So if you try to use those
old APIs from the 90s,

15
00:00:54.205 --> 00:00:57.250
they don't work unless you are a PWA.

16
00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.473
So when you start a PWA,

17
00:00:59.473 --> 00:01:02.469
you have your own window and you can
create more windows of the same app.

18
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.720
So here,
I have a demo that I did with a PWA.

19
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.917
So you install the PWA, and
then those buttons are just executing

20
00:01:12.917 --> 00:01:18.110
JavaScript, they can open
more windows of the same app.

21
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.531
You can see the same orange on
the title bar, and you can resize them,

22
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:30.170
move them around,
talking to the OS directly, okay?

23
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.550
So it's a very simple API, moveTo,
resizeTo, it works over the window.

24
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.010
And also, we have new APIs.

25
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.380
For example, there is one known as
multi-screen windows placement API.

26
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.860
That can also work with websites,
not just with installed PWAs.

27
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.590
In this case, you can actually
get information about screens and

28
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.960
screens in plural.

29
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.407
Because now you can connect more than
one screen to a computer to display, so

30
00:02:00.407 --> 00:02:02.730
you can get how many screens do we have?

31
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.645
And you can even pick, if you wanna move a
window from your PWA to another screen and

32
00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:11.502
you can get details about that, okay?

33
00:02:11.502 --> 00:02:15.080
Another API, windows-controls-overlay.

34
00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:20.585
This one is brand new,
I haven't seen so many PWAs using them.

35
00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:24.215
The idea is that you change
the property in the manifest.

36
00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:30.725
For those of you without experience yet
in PWA, now you have a homework.

37
00:02:30.725 --> 00:02:34.222
After this course,
you need to go and take the PWA1.

38
00:02:34.222 --> 00:02:37.516
But, there is a file known
as the manifest file and

39
00:02:37.516 --> 00:02:43.500
the manifest file will give you metadata,
will give the OS metadata about your app.

40
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.970
Well, that's changing that metadata.

41
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.210
When you set that property,
now you can do things like this.

42
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:56.152
Your own window will
let you render HTML and

43
00:02:56.152 --> 00:03:01.281
CSS content in the title bar, okay?

44
00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:03.850
So this is a Wikipedia PWA and

45
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.420
you can see there is a search bar
directly in the title bar, okay?

46
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.300
So that's a new API and it's currently
available in Chrome and Edge on desktop.
