WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.570
This is the new API, remember,
not available on iPhone, and iPad.

2
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:10.330
We need to use a constructor,
a constructor differs per sensor.

3
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.310
For example, in this case,
we can read the magnetometer,

4
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.008
we can select the frequency,
the frequency is in seconds, and then,

5
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:23.380
you listen for
the reading event over that object.

6
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.760
And in this case, we are getting
three values for the magnetometer.

7
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.650
And then you start reading, you can
start reading, you can stop reading.

8
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.270
Make sense?

9
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.385
The old API, you just read the values and

10
00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:40.693
you can stop reading the values
because for the old API,

11
00:00:40.693 --> 00:00:47.500
your API was only supporting magnetometer,
a gyroscope, and accelerometer.

12
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.960
And all those three sensors
are typically always on.

13
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.264
Actually, most of the sensors are always
on because those sensors are being used,

14
00:00:57.264 --> 00:01:00.838
for example,
to change the orientation of your phone.

15
00:01:00.838 --> 00:01:08.143
When you are in one specific app and
you go landscape, it uses those sensors.

16
00:01:08.143 --> 00:01:12.614
So the sensors are on, so using those
sensors don't have a cost in battery, for

17
00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:13.700
example.

18
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.742
Because they're always on anyway, you're
just reading the value for your own app.

19
00:01:19.742 --> 00:01:25.097
So these are the sensors available and
the constructors available today on

20
00:01:25.097 --> 00:01:31.047
this generic sensor API, the one that is
now working on iOS and that's a permission

21
00:01:31.047 --> 00:01:35.990
policy in case you wanna enable or
disable that from the HTTP header.

22
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.766
So you have an absolute orientation
sensor, linear acceleration sensor,

23
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:48.420
gyroscope, ambia line sensor, magnetometer
accelerometer Okay, make sense?

24
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.310
And do we have any Android
user here in the room?

25
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.890
Okay, four.

26
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.370
Well, because on Android,
we can use this API on Chrome and Android.

27
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.133
So that's my Android, okay?

28
00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:06.060
So you you can see I have my Android here
and you're seeing a mirror of the screen.

29
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.875
So on this is
fairman.github.io/capabilities,

30
00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:13.960
the URL for these workshops.

31
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.130
And they're cool, they must try, okay?

32
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.524
So if you have an iPhone, those demos,

33
00:02:19.524 --> 00:02:23.810
the first demo one work because
they're using the generic sensor API.

34
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.379
So for example, orientation phone.

35
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.698
In this case,
you can see I'm moving my phone and

36
00:02:30.698 --> 00:02:35.312
it's applying CSS 3D
transformations based on that.

37
00:02:35.312 --> 00:02:37.750
Is that useful?

38
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.004
Again, it depends.

39
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:41.810
It's a nice effect for a website.

40
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.230
By the way,
did you see any permission dialog?

41
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.190
No.

42
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:53.530
So on this API, on Android, we don't get
any permission dialog, you just read this.

43
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.130
So you can apply CSS effects to
your websites right away, okay?

44
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.147
For your titles, you can do a little game,
a gravity game, or

45
00:03:02.147 --> 00:03:04.560
things like that without any issue.

46
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.070
Then I can try the 360 degree.

47
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.400
This is cool as well,
so I can move my phone.

48
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.499
And this is a built on
window into another,

49
00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:20.296
it's like a portal into another dimension,
okay?

50
00:03:20.296 --> 00:03:24.191
Like in I'm wearing the beach right now,
okay?

51
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:29.270
So, and you can see it works pretty good.

52
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.580
Every axis, okay?

53
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.446
Those are open source by the way,
so if you wanna check the code and

54
00:03:36.446 --> 00:03:37.960
use them, you can.

55
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.770
These demos are coming from Intel.

56
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.800
And also you can get the raw data.

57
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.274
So I have here a sensor info where you
can actually add different observers

58
00:03:48.274 --> 00:03:54.114
like sensor observers, so I can add,
for example, which sensor do you want?

59
00:03:54.114 --> 00:03:55.766
Let's try accelerometer.

60
00:03:55.766 --> 00:04:03.130
The frequency, I can use 16 and
then I can turn it on.

61
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.420
And now you can see the raw values
that the phone is giving that API.

62
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.120
So you can even check,
okay, where are the values?

63
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.130
You can see that you
won't get integer values.

64
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.255
So typically,
when you're using the sensor APIs,

65
00:04:19.255 --> 00:04:23.029
you don't need to check absolute values,
just check ranges.

66
00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:26.765
Between -0.1 and 0.1, don't ask for

67
00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:31.380
zero because it's difficult
to get really zero.

68
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.642
So you can see, by the way,
why it's nine dot something close to 10?

69
00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:37.244
Can you.

70
00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:38.980
&gt;&gt; 9.8 meters per second squared.

71
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.340
&gt;&gt; 9.8, that's gravity, Earth gravity.

72
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.246
Of course, we can talk with Elon Musk and
try these on Mars, okay?

73
00:04:49.246 --> 00:04:51.768
And see, yeah, it will change, right?

74
00:04:51.768 --> 00:04:56.420
So we would see a different value
here in JavaScript on Mars.

75
00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:02.515
Anyway, of course he if I turn
the phone down, you will see -10, okay?

76
00:05:02.515 --> 00:05:05.230
On different axes, it depends on the axis.

77
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:11.260
So that's the accelerometer and
you can try all the other as well.

78
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.816
I don't wanna try all of them but
I know the gyroscope, okay?

79
00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.466
And now you can see the bias and

80
00:05:18.466 --> 00:05:21.569
gyroscope based on your
thought on what you're doing.

81
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.857
Let's write another one
such as ambient light.

82
00:05:27.385 --> 00:05:31.216
So, what you see there
is that it says error.

83
00:05:31.216 --> 00:05:36.975
So what's going on with ambient light?

84
00:05:36.975 --> 00:05:41.493
Ambient light also used
to have an old API, okay?

85
00:05:41.493 --> 00:05:42.435
An old API.

86
00:05:42.435 --> 00:05:45.605
So classic API not using
the generic sensor API.

87
00:05:45.605 --> 00:05:50.909
In fact, if we go to kind of use, though
this is the first time we're going to kind

88
00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:56.072
of use, this is a website where you can
check if you can use one particular API.

89
00:05:56.072 --> 00:06:01.777
So I can check, for example, sensors or
sensor, orientation sensor and

90
00:06:01.777 --> 00:06:06.481
we have ambient light sensor,
you can see it's pretty red.

91
00:06:06.481 --> 00:06:10.619
There are some greens there and
then there is a fly,

92
00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:13.420
let me increase this a little bit.

93
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.470
So what's going on here?

94
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.040
It's under a flag on Chrome or Firefox.

95
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.740
It was green between some versions,
but then they removed that.

96
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.939
Why?
Because they realized that it was

97
00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:31.889
triggering some privacy issues.

98
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.520
It's weird,
that's why we can't have nine things.

99
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.908
So, someone realized that
when you have a tab, okay?

100
00:06:40.908 --> 00:06:45.503
And let's say you open an app
that is using this API to

101
00:06:45.503 --> 00:06:49.054
read the current light on your room, and

102
00:06:49.054 --> 00:06:54.990
then you open another tab and
you open Tiktok or Tinder, okay?

103
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.306
Someone realized that the brightness
of your screen is also

104
00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:03.160
affecting the light around the sensor.

105
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.017
And someone could actually get what
are you seeing another taps or

106
00:07:08.017 --> 00:07:13.326
in which websites where you,
just by reading, light changes, okay?

107
00:07:13.326 --> 00:07:14.920
Makes sense?

108
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.772
So because of that they say,
we have a privacy issue here,

109
00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:24.840
so let's remove it and
it's still there under a flag.

110
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.767
So we can still work with it, okay?

111
00:07:27.767 --> 00:07:30.480
If we enable a flag, it's experimental.

112
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.618
I think on Chrome, for example, I think
the flag is for generic sensor extra

113
00:07:35.618 --> 00:07:40.530
classes, but you can still go and
enable generic sensor extra classes.

114
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:46.495
So for example, I can go to Chrome here,
go to Chrome or

115
00:07:46.495 --> 00:07:51.167
add other flags and
enable extra search for

116
00:07:51.167 --> 00:07:56.510
sensor generic sensor extra classes,
enable.

117
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:02.220
So this will add ambient light sensor and
magnetometer on Mac, Windows.

118
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.930
I can relaunch this.

119
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.415
So now I can try this on
my desktop computer, but

120
00:08:07.415 --> 00:08:10.530
also I can enable that here as well.

121
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:16.005
So I can go to Chrome,
flags on my Android,

122
00:08:16.005 --> 00:08:22.546
search for
the same generic sensor extra classes,

123
00:08:22.546 --> 00:08:29.560
enable that, relaunch Chrome and
now it should work.

124
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:36.198
We can try, I can go back and
use my real phone for that, let's see.

125
00:08:36.198 --> 00:08:43.000
Oops, add sensor, ambient light,
frequency, 60, add.

126
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.799
Okay, so now it's getting me 0 for

127
00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:53.610
some reason, and only 0,
so it's not changing.

128
00:08:55.170 --> 00:09:03.160
But it's an experimental, let's try
it on desktop to see if that works.

129
00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.170
Do I have it here?

130
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:04.710
I do.

131
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:09.920
We are talking about the sensor info,
that's the link.

132
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.330
So we're going to try, ambient light 16.

133
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:18.860
Let's see, let's activate the sensor.

134
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.310
No, not readable.

135
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.220
Why is not readable?

136
00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:26.540
Probably my Mac is not sending the
information to Chrome, that's one reason.

137
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.180
You can try it on your Mac,
depends on the Mac, I'm on an M1.

138
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.360
So it depends on that.

139
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.722
You can read that,
you can try it in Firefox, but anyway,

140
00:09:34.722 --> 00:09:39.370
you know that that sensor is there but
it's still really experimental.

141
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.960
So that's actually the yellow side.

142
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.806
In this case, it's not the API, it's just
that one, and by the way do you have

143
00:09:46.806 --> 00:09:50.780
accelerometer on a computer on
a desktop computer and a laptop?

144
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.598
&gt;&gt; I mean, I know that the old ones,
&gt;&gt; The old ones have,

145
00:09:57.598 --> 00:10:02.610
which ones the ones with just with
a hard drive, not with an SSD.

146
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.093
Because the hard drive on the max,

147
00:10:05.093 --> 00:10:10.228
they used to have an accelerometer
to know if your computer is dropped,

148
00:10:10.228 --> 00:10:15.260
so they can look or actually,
yeah, lock the hard drive.

149
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:22.499
Anyway, so today, those sensors are more
optimized for tablets and phones, okay?

150
00:10:22.499 --> 00:10:23.410
Makes sense?

151
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:27.180
And the ambient light, yeah,
we're not there yet, okay, to use.

152
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.140
Okay, what about the iPhone?

153
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.158
So as I mentioned, that API is
not available on the iPhone, but

154
00:10:36.158 --> 00:10:41.270
you still can read accelerometer,
gyroscope, and magnetometer, how?

155
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:45.515
Just adding an event listener to
the window object, so global events,

156
00:10:45.515 --> 00:10:46.820
just that.

157
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.850
Add event listener, device motion,
device orientation.

158
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.780
And you will get the same
values as with the other API.

159
00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.313
So you can do the same effects, okay?

160
00:10:58.313 --> 00:11:00.610
The same effect with the phone that moves.

161
00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:06.175
Or even you can do the same
birtwell door portal

162
00:11:06.175 --> 00:11:10.782
to another dimension,
it's possible in iOS.

163
00:11:10.782 --> 00:11:15.529
There is a however, since iOS 13,

164
00:11:15.529 --> 00:11:20.736
that's a few years ago, Apple realized

165
00:11:20.736 --> 00:11:26.569
that they also have
privacy issue with this.

166
00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:31.564
There were arts, iframes that were reading

167
00:11:31.564 --> 00:11:37.530
your sensors to try to fingerprint you,
okay?

168
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:42.165
Because of that,
they created a permission dialogue

169
00:11:42.165 --> 00:11:45.570
that they didn't document anywhere.

170
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.980
You can go and search for that,
you will find my blog post on that.

171
00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:57.850
So and I got it looking at
the WebKit source code actually.

172
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:02.380
And then someone from the WebKit
team confirmed that on Twitter.

173
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.900
So at that point,
they were not documenting anything.

174
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.733
So actually, if you wanna use this on iOS,

175
00:12:07.733 --> 00:12:12.320
you need to request permission and
the user will see a dialog, okay?

176
00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:17.220
So then no one will do that
it doesn't make any sense.

177
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.783
So if you have a game or
an immersive experience on iOS,

178
00:12:20.783 --> 00:12:25.240
you have to request permission
on device motion event.

179
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.190
And if it's granted, it will give you
a response as a string, granted or denied.

180
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:33.280
If it's granted, then you can
start listening for these events.

181
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.810
If not,
it's not going to call your events.

182
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:41.620
In fact, there were a lot of websites and
games using this.

183
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:46.296
And from one version of iOS from the other
one, everything has stopped working and

184
00:12:46.296 --> 00:12:47.259
no one knew why.

185
00:12:47.259 --> 00:12:51.494
It's because Apple added
that permission dialog as

186
00:12:51.494 --> 00:12:54.486
a requirement to use the API, okay?

187
00:12:54.486 --> 00:12:54.986
Make sense?

188
00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.719
So, again, the sensors that you
wanna use are accelerometer,

189
00:13:00.719 --> 00:13:05.110
gyroscope, and magnetometer,
the rest are very experimental.
