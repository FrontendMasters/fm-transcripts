WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.350
So there is another API known
as WebHID that is not available

2
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.840
today on Safari,
that's why it's light green.

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.584
It can work on Chromium based browser.

4
00:00:12.584 --> 00:00:16.560
In this case HID is
Human Interface Device.

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.625
You can use this to access device
connected also through USB or Bluetooth,

6
00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:28.760
but they are using a standard
protocol on hardware known as HID.

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.652
So it's a device to communicate
with the user input or

8
00:00:33.652 --> 00:00:37.800
output, they can be both,
that it's not standard, okay?

9
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.089
So in this case, developers,
so we can control

10
00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.870
devices and applications, but low level.

11
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.690
In this case, users must grant
permission through a browser dialog.

12
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.591
So in this case is different, okay?

13
00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:01.898
It's not like you have access immediately,
no,

14
00:01:01.898 --> 00:01:06.320
the user must granted you permission
to use that specific device.

15
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.102
And this is also useful for
non-standard input devices,

16
00:01:11.102 --> 00:01:14.615
not just the game pad with superpowers or
with asteroids,

17
00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:18.066
they can be something really weird or
really different.

18
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.970
I have some examples in a second.

19
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.410
And it's a low-level API.

20
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.454
That means that you have a lot of power,
but also you have a lot of work.

21
00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:32.424
You need to understand how to talk to that
particular device, you need the manual or

22
00:01:32.424 --> 00:01:35.690
you need to somehow get the information on
how, what,

23
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.470
which instructions do you need to
send to that particular device.

24
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.385
So examples of devices you can talk
to with stream decks from Elgato.

25
00:01:45.385 --> 00:01:50.050
So for streamers, it's pretty common
these days to have these devices.

26
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.910
I'm talking about that one.

27
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.160
In that case,
you can send images to each button.

28
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.070
You can receive clicks from the buttons.

29
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.973
And also there is a display here,
And analog controls.

30
00:02:02.973 --> 00:02:09.757
So with web human interface devices API,
you can actually talk to that device or

31
00:02:09.757 --> 00:02:14.020
with a pedal for cooking,
that's good, right?

32
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.777
So with your feet you can touch,
it depends on how you are touching or

33
00:02:19.777 --> 00:02:24.000
how many times you can
do the several things.

34
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.620
You can use game pads
that are not standard.

35
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.588
You can talk to a mouse with
a screen if you want to.

36
00:02:32.588 --> 00:02:35.332
I'm not sure who wants to use
a mouse with a screen inside.

37
00:02:35.332 --> 00:02:40.881
That's the, or
LED lights that you connect through USB.

38
00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:42.720
That's an output device, not an input.

39
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.120
So, HID is not just for input.

40
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.880
So that's WebHID, but
it's a very low-level API.

41
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.550
This is how that works.

42
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.150
You await for navigation hid.getDevices.

43
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.660
In this case, the browser will render
a browser selection dialog where

44
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.880
the user will need to pick one,
and then you can show information.

45
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.562
Because it's a very low level, we're not
gonna waste too much time because I don't

46
00:03:08.562 --> 00:03:11.518
know if you're going to use that,
but we have a couple of examples.

47
00:03:11.518 --> 00:03:16.130
In the examples we have WebHID demo and
a demo for DualShock4,

48
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.400
that is exactly this gamepad.

49
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.210
So, with this one, with the first
one I can click Connect Device and

50
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.080
you will see the dialog.

51
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.100
You must run these on Google Chrome or
Microsoft Edge.

52
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.049
So in the dialog it says,
which device do you want to use?

53
00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:42.975
And in this case it will show you
more information about the device.

54
00:03:42.975 --> 00:03:48.000
And the other one, Dualshock4,
I'm going to connect the controller.

55
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.401
And you can see that now my controller
appears there, wireless controller,

56
00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:53.950
connect.

57
00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.852
And now I have full
control of the LCD color.

58
00:04:00.852 --> 00:04:05.272
I'm not sure if you can get that on
the camera, but it's changing the colors.

59
00:04:05.272 --> 00:04:11.177
The rumble, You will hear that
on the microphone probably.

60
00:04:11.177 --> 00:04:13.238
The strongness, can you hear it?

61
00:04:13.238 --> 00:04:16.279
It's actually rumbling the inside.

62
00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:22.147
And also here of course you can also
get all the information on the buttons,

63
00:04:22.147 --> 00:04:23.277
everything.

64
00:04:23.277 --> 00:04:26.549
But you can get that from
the gamepad API as well.

65
00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:30.504
But here you can touch with
a device that's a low level and

66
00:04:30.504 --> 00:04:32.573
do whatever you want, okay?

67
00:04:32.573 --> 00:04:33.642
So that's cool.

68
00:04:33.642 --> 00:04:37.863
And also it has accelerometer and
gyroscope.

69
00:04:37.863 --> 00:04:41.698
And by the way, it's not just that, for
example, I have another example here.

70
00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:46.031
This little guy that I have
here is a pointer, okay?

71
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:50.667
So yeah, it's a pretty cool pointer,
you can go forward, move forward, but

72
00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:52.369
it also has accelerometer.

73
00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:56.207
So I can also read that
as a WebHID device, and

74
00:04:56.207 --> 00:05:00.156
know if I'm pointing, where I'm pointing.

75
00:05:00.156 --> 00:05:05.666
So I can read everything from
the device using WebHID.
