WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.711
So we are here for
a tour of web capabilities.

2
00:00:03.711 --> 00:00:05.523
My name is Maximiliano.

3
00:00:05.523 --> 00:00:07.993
I know it's a long name ,11 characters.

4
00:00:07.993 --> 00:00:12.279
Typically I have problems with my
boarding passes, because it doesn't fit.

5
00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:13.890
But anyway, Max is fine.

6
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.999
I can go by Max.

7
00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.500
Really quickly,
I'm a mobile web developer.

8
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.899
So I have been doing websites and
web apps since 1996.

9
00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:28.070
So a few years after that, I have
started doing JavaScript, of course.

10
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.815
Initially, it was just HTML,
pure HTML without server-side.

11
00:00:33.815 --> 00:00:38.573
Of course, then,
I started doing backend, full stack,

12
00:00:38.573 --> 00:00:42.564
and I've seen all
the different front end eras.

13
00:00:42.564 --> 00:00:45.128
And I'm also a mobile developer.

14
00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:49.160
So I've always been focusing
on the mobile space.

15
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.207
I always liked the mobile space when it
was really weird, like blackberries and

16
00:00:54.207 --> 00:00:59.040
Nokia devices, Scindia and I'm not
sure if anyone remember that that one.

17
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.926
But anyway, during during those times,

18
00:01:01.926 --> 00:01:07.210
I have created a lot of web apps using
a lot of API's that we will cover today.

19
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.807
Of course,
a lot of things have changed since then.

20
00:01:10.807 --> 00:01:16.243
But we will still see some API's that has
been in a while for a couple of years.

21
00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:20.290
So I'm an author, so
I have author 13 books.

22
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.252
You can see there my shelf with a lot of
translations, so there is a trick there.

23
00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:26.908
That's why you see more books,

24
00:01:26.908 --> 00:01:30.658
because there are translations on
languages that I don't understand.

25
00:01:30.658 --> 00:01:33.527
And I have offered a lot
of courses as well,

26
00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:36.653
online courses in the past 12, 13 years.

27
00:01:36.653 --> 00:01:42.077
And here, at Front End Masters, you
will find a lot of courses from myself,.

28
00:01:42.077 --> 00:01:43.806
And I'm Firt on Twitter.

29
00:01:43.806 --> 00:01:49.994
Firt.Dev, my personal website where
you can see articles, my books,

30
00:01:49.994 --> 00:01:56.703
and YouTube videos and sessions that
I've been doing over the past few years.

31
00:01:56.703 --> 00:02:03.475
But we're not here to talk about me,
we're here to talk about capabilities.

32
00:02:03.475 --> 00:02:09.335
And the last piece of, let's say,
text that I have authored,

33
00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:14.763
it's not really a printed book,
it's an e-book on PWA.

34
00:02:14.763 --> 00:02:19.548
Learn PWA that was published by
the Google Chrome team and web.dev, and

35
00:02:19.548 --> 00:02:22.300
there is a full chapter on capabilities.

36
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.487
So later today, we'll get into there,

37
00:02:25.487 --> 00:02:30.476
because we have a lot of links,
nice links that I have created.

38
00:02:30.476 --> 00:02:34.148
By the way, that open source and
it's a creative common, so

39
00:02:34.148 --> 00:02:35.806
it's free license to use.

40
00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:40.208
And if you are interested in
PWAs here at Front End Masters,

41
00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:44.357
I also offer a course on that,
Build PWA from a Scratch.

42
00:02:44.357 --> 00:02:50.559
But also you have text-based information
with examples here and web.dev.

43
00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:54.757
So today,
we're going to cover capabilities.

44
00:02:54.757 --> 00:02:57.895
We're going to define what
the capability is in a minute.

45
00:02:57.895 --> 00:03:03.010
But let's say, for now that this
workshop is going to be a tour.

46
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.040
And as a tour, we are not going to
code everything from a scratch.

47
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.828
The idea of this workshop is for you to
understand all the capabilities of the web

48
00:03:11.828 --> 00:03:16.849
these days, to understand what you can do,
how, and to test those capabilities.

49
00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.227
Sometimes, we will code that,
sometimes it goes right there, and

50
00:03:20.227 --> 00:03:21.603
we will try to understand.

51
00:03:21.603 --> 00:03:24.257
So we will talk about permissions and
security.

52
00:03:24.257 --> 00:03:25.623
We're going to start with that.

53
00:03:25.623 --> 00:03:28.230
So how permissions and security work,

54
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.076
compatibility that is typically an issue
when we're talking about web capabilities.

55
00:03:34.076 --> 00:03:38.125
Then we'll get into sensors,
location, geolocation.

56
00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:41.979
And input devices, speech,
voice, and camera,

57
00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:45.668
hardware and, let's say, external devices.

58
00:03:45.668 --> 00:03:48.638
So how can we get out of the screen,

59
00:03:48.638 --> 00:03:53.872
get out of the current user device and
do something outside?

60
00:03:53.872 --> 00:03:56.302
How to integrate with
the operating system.

61
00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:59.882
So we're going to see
different new APIs and

62
00:03:59.882 --> 00:04:05.024
abilities that we have to act like
a native app in several ways.

63
00:04:05.024 --> 00:04:10.607
And on that sort of things,
we will get into PWA capabilities as well.

64
00:04:10.607 --> 00:04:13.913
So I have a couple of gadgets
here that we will use later.

65
00:04:13.913 --> 00:04:18.112
On top of one app that I will
give the URL in a minute so

66
00:04:18.112 --> 00:04:22.899
you will be able to test that
app It's just an example on how

67
00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:27.590
you can integrate several
capabilities in one real app,

68
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.133
not just to see each
capability one by one.

69
00:04:31.133 --> 00:04:37.843
Prerequisites, that's the URL
firtman.github.io/capabilities.

70
00:04:37.843 --> 00:04:42.997
There you will find just
a repository with some links.

71
00:04:42.997 --> 00:04:45.887
And there is a folder
where you have the slides,

72
00:04:45.887 --> 00:04:49.366
a copy of the slides in PDF in
case you wanna follow along.

73
00:04:49.366 --> 00:04:54.497
And also you have a folder with source
code that is plain vanilla JavaScript.

74
00:04:54.497 --> 00:04:58.054
So you don't need any framework,
npm, install, or anything.

75
00:04:58.054 --> 00:04:59.939
But it's called CookingMaster.

76
00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:04.551
So we will get into that
project later today.

77
00:05:04.551 --> 00:05:08.035
Nothing really fancy, but
it's not about how it looks like,

78
00:05:08.035 --> 00:05:09.783
it's about what we have here.

79
00:05:09.783 --> 00:05:14.235
So we have a lot of links that we
will see over the rest of the day.

80
00:05:14.235 --> 00:05:20.158
And if you go to the repo,
github.com/firtman capabilities,

81
00:05:20.158 --> 00:05:25.543
you have that CookingMaster
folder that we will use later,

82
00:05:25.543 --> 00:05:29.110
not now, okay, but later if you want.

83
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.658
It's just plain Vanilla JavaScript
using a lot of capabilities.
