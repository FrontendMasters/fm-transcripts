00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.635
Well, something less cool but
important, screen wake lock.

2
00:00:06.635 --> 00:00:10.772
And this is important for
our cooking application.

3
00:00:10.772 --> 00:00:14.450
So let's say you are on iPad,
you are cooking with your iPad.

4
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.688
What happens with the screen
of your iPad after one minute,

5
00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:21.923
two minutes, that you're not touching it?

6
00:00:21.923 --> 00:00:24.202
It locks down, and I'm cooking.

7
00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:27.798
I don't wanna use my finger
Touch ID to open it up.

8
00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:32.125
Well, for that we have screen wake lock.

9
00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:37.420
That was not available on Safari
until this year, but now it's there.

10
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.083
So we can use it in Safari as well.

11
00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:44.172
In this case, we can request a wakeLock.

12
00:00:44.172 --> 00:00:49.759
In this case, we're asking the browser,
hey, browser, please ask the OS to

13
00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:54.937
not lock the screen while this web
app is running, is in the foreground.

14
00:00:54.937 --> 00:01:00.503
And we have an event that we
can listen to that is 'release'.

15
00:01:00.503 --> 00:01:05.322
They will tell us when that event was
released by the OS for some reason,

16
00:01:05.322 --> 00:01:07.777
maybe the user went to another page.

17
00:01:07.777 --> 00:01:12.600
If that happens, then it's released,
you can retake it if you want

18
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.612
when the user goes back,
you can apply for it again.

19
00:01:16.612 --> 00:01:19.182
In our example, we do have it.

20
00:01:19.182 --> 00:01:23.454
So there is a capability
in Cooking Masters.

21
00:01:23.454 --> 00:01:25.435
One of the ability here is Wake Lock.

22
00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:27.989
So I can request Wake Lock.

23
00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:31.209
We don't see anything actually.

24
00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:36.869
What I have here for the Wake Lock,
I did this icon, this emoji.

25
00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.829
So if I click there, if you see the icon,
it's because it was granted.

26
00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.840
It is difficult to test this
naturally [LAUGH], right,

27
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.938
you need to trust me that it will work.

28
00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:49.306
But if not, you'll need to try this.

29
00:01:49.306 --> 00:01:53.463
We need to set up the machines,
then wait one minute,

30
00:01:53.463 --> 00:01:55.886
then go to lock, but it works.

31
00:01:55.886 --> 00:02:02.289
So this was actually important for a lot
of apps because it was a big problem that,

32
00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.563
I mean, things like even, well,
not Netflix, because when a web

33
00:02:07.563 --> 00:02:12.579
app is playing video,
there is a wake lock of automatic there.

34
00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:17.787
But it was a problem for other kind
of apps that are not using video,

35
00:02:17.787 --> 00:02:21.893
it can be a game, or
an immersive game in metaverse.

36
00:02:21.893 --> 00:02:25.439
But it's not video, or
maybe you're not playing,

37
00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.559
you're watching something,
and then the screen goes off.

38
00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:31.878
Well, now you can request,

39
00:02:31.878 --> 00:02:37.297
that while the page is there on
the screen, please don't do that.

40
00:02:37.297 --> 00:02:42.115
But have in mind that using this
API will have a cost for the user.

41
00:02:42.115 --> 00:02:47.152
So be a good citizen and release
that when you don't need it anymore.

42
00:02:47.152 --> 00:02:52.013
So if I'm getting out of the full screen,
right now I'm releasing the wake lock,

43
00:02:52.013 --> 00:02:55.330
because now I don't need to
keep the screen on anymore.
