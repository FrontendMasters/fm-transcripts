1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:08.700
NFC is another cool API that is
also compatible only with Chrome.

2
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.550
NFC is Near Field Communication.

3
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.000
It will let you access to Tap to Pay,
Tap to Share, or to whatever.

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.048
You can be here and we can have
an NFT tag near the wall, and you,

5
00:00:25.048 --> 00:00:31.165
on a web app, you put your phone near
the wall, and you can get information.

6
00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:35.980
Something that you can also get with a QR
code, or you can actually change data.

7
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.480
Because the API gateway you are
technically and you know more about this.

8
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.560
The web NFE API is just a subset of
everything that can be done with NFC.

9
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.200
You can only access tags
that are close to you.

10
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.688
There are many technologies when this
case tags are really less than 10

11
00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:58.370
centimeters or 4 inches.

12
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.780
And is limited only to
an aspect known as NDEF,

13
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.700
that is NFC data exchange format.

14
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.694
That is like the simplest protocol
that we have on NFC that will

15
00:01:11.694 --> 00:01:15.929
let you read data from a tag and
write data to add tag.

16
00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:21.098
So we can read tags,
we can write tags on compatible browsers,

17
00:01:21.098 --> 00:01:27.547
because some browser will tell you,
no, no, only read, only write,okay.

18
00:01:27.547 --> 00:01:32.549
So and then you can if you want
to do low-level IO operations

19
00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.652
like execute code that sometimes
is available on some tags,

20
00:01:37.652 --> 00:01:40.780
that's not possible with the spec.

21
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.000
I know it sounds abstract,
so we can try this.

22
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.285
So I have some ways to try this.

23
00:01:49.747 --> 00:01:52.920
I have here with me two NFC tags.

24
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.890
This one is an NFC tag, and this one you
may know, that's an air tile from Apple.

25
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.150
It has many things, and
one of the things, it's an NFC title.

26
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.300
Can we read that?

27
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.270
Yeah, we need Chrome on Androids.

28
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.040
So this doesn't work on iOS yet.

29
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.599
So if I open my code here,

30
00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.520
my browser, we have here web NFC.

31
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.580
So you can see I can write
a read I want I'm going to scan.

32
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.780
So if you see the scan, you can see
a scan has started, scan started.

33
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.130
Do we see any massage any permission?

34
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.664
No, now this is my NFC tie.

35
00:02:38.664 --> 00:02:44.900
I'm going to do this and
you can see it read a serial number.

36
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.550
Let's do it again.

37
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.260
Also the phone vibrates when that happens.

38
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.997
So I also have one record that
you can read if you want now with

39
00:02:55.997 --> 00:03:00.936
the year tie,
I'm going to do this come on their time.

40
00:03:03.226 --> 00:03:07.970
It was working before just
in case this can end.

41
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.490
Yeah, there we are,
it says cannot read data from the NFC tag.

42
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.369
Let me refresh of maybe I'm
moving too fast, there we are.

43
00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.220
Yeah, I was moving too fast.

44
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.050
So I'm bringing the serial number.

45
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.690
Okay, that's the airtime.

46
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.850
That's the other thing I have.

47
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.390
So, that's the first
thing that you can do.

48
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.510
Those tags those serial
numbers are unique.

49
00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:44.055
So, worldwide, right?

50
00:03:44.055 --> 00:03:46.680
So, the idea is that,
what do you wanna do with that?

51
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.840
Well, at least you know
where the user is tapping.

52
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.200
So, if you have a database
of serial numbers,

53
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.330
you know where the user is tapping, and
then you can start something in your app.

54
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.000
You can unlock a feature.

55
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.780
It's a treasure hunt.

56
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.550
So then you go and
you know where the user is.

57
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.980
So apart from breeding, just the serial
number that's the first step.

58
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.430
You can read other data
that title might contain.

59
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.560
But for that you need to understand
the tire in the case of Apple,

60
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.470
you won't be able to read anything from
Android or from an external device.

61
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.370
The only thing you can read the serial
number but with that, that's enough.

62
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.250
Because you know the tag,
okay, makes sense.

63
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.042
So, by the way,
you can also read the phone number and

64
00:04:40.042 --> 00:04:44.570
information from that the owner
can register from Android.

65
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.526
But in terms of what I can do with
an air tag from WebNFC typically it's

66
00:04:49.526 --> 00:04:54.110
just the serial number to use
as a way to detect where we are.

67
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.725
There are cheaper things like
this is cheaper than an air tag.

68
00:04:58.725 --> 00:05:01.230
And basically that's all.

69
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.250
The idea is tap to pay,
tap to activate things.

70
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:13.302
It can be in a museum and tap near places
where it will give you more information or

71
00:05:13.302 --> 00:05:19.950
it can start an audio transcript of
what's going on, okay, makes sense?

72
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:20.770
An audio tour.

73
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.250
So the API is not complicated,
we can see it here.

74
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.975
So we create a new MDAF reader,
we start on a scan, and

75
00:05:31.975 --> 00:05:37.120
then we have two event listeners,
reading error.

76
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.768
For example, when I was passing
the air tag too fast, it was actually

77
00:05:41.768 --> 00:05:46.018
executing the error reading error and
then you have reading and

78
00:05:46.018 --> 00:05:50.370
you will get a message and
then say we see that the serial number.

79
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.457
And after that you can also start
a read operation over services or

80
00:05:54.457 --> 00:05:59.450
you can start the write operation in case
the hardware allows you to write data.

81
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.660
That's all for webinar NFC.

82
00:06:04.562 --> 00:06:08.909
Today it's working on Android mainly
because you don't have an NFT reader

83
00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:13.532
around your computer and you won't use
your computer to touch, I don't know,

84
00:06:13.532 --> 00:06:15.680
on the metro, something like that.

85
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.190
But it works on the phone.

86
00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.436
Have in mind that,
if you wanna write data,

87
00:06:19.436 --> 00:06:22.710
you need to understand what
you're writing and how.

88
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.889
For example, it can be a hotel key,
like the hotel room key.

89
00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.390
If it's too old system,
maybe it's easy to hack.

90
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:36.113
You can read the tag and
write the same tag on another thing, but

91
00:06:36.113 --> 00:06:40.290
the most modern system,
they have security in place.

92
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.700
So there are some encryption going on.

93
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.039
So it's not gonna work, so simple.

94
00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:50.023
Sometimes there is an encryption
over the serial number so

95
00:06:50.023 --> 00:06:55.108
when you try to just clone
the information to another device

96
00:06:55.108 --> 00:07:00.820
does work because it's failing
in the valuation process, okay.

97
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.642
But if you know NFC and if you are on that
field You can do that from the web now.
