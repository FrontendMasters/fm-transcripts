00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.600
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Another powerful tool.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.144
Like, once you have that all set up and
we've got the plan modes and

3
00:00:06.144 --> 00:00:09.932
we talked about that, there is one other
mode that is the secret mode, which I

4
00:00:09.932 --> 00:00:14.160
shouldn't tell you about, but you're going
to find out anyway and you're adults.

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.648
So if you start Claude and

6
00:00:18.648 --> 00:00:25.280
let's say dash, dash, continue.

7
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.120
So it picks up the last session because
otherwise that will be lost to time.

8
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.610
Or I can hit resume and you do this one.

9
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.610
What do you think that one does?

10
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.530
Now you get this and
you can Shift+Tab to turn that on and off.

11
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.250
It just gives you kind of
a fourth mode in there.

12
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.540
That one, I played with that one before.

13
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.140
Hackathon mode.

14
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.180
That's why I was in a bad mood on Friday.

15
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.500
Real bad mood on Friday.

16
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.580
That's the one I get reset hard and
rewrote all by hand on Monday.

17
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.580
I flew a little too close to the sun.

18
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.940
So don't do that one.

19
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.140
But the nice part is when I did that,
dash continue, I jumped right back in.

20
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.100
And it has the to do list.

21
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.200
It stores that to do list in those
JSON L files in your home directory.

22
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.320
So you're not necessarily
gonna lose anything.

23
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.600
It knows where it was.

24
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.113
Previously, it didn't have this mode up
until a month ago, two, three weeks ago,

25
00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:35.800
I don't really remember when.

26
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.154
And I used to do this as markdown
files and markdown checklists,

27
00:01:38.154 --> 00:01:40.960
which were nice because sometimes I would
do a few of them and check them off.

28
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.119
And that's kind of cool.

29
00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.720
But you can just at this point
use it like this as well.

30
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.278
So you can say continue and
it will continue down that checklist,

31
00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:53.810
finagling so on and so forth.

32
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.530
While that does its thing,
let's talk about commands.

33
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.810
We saw that it was an add dir model.

34
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.930
You can make your own.

35
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.250
You remember when we did
notepads with cursor?

36
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.370
Same basic idea.

37
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.730
So you can take any common.

38
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.685
If you find yourself typing
the same thing over and over again,

39
00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:18.090
make it a command file.

40
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.090
I'll show you how to do that in a second.

41
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.410
I'll show you the ones I have in
the repo that I'm currently working on.

42
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.050
But any of these, it's just a shortcut for
what you want to do.

43
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.677
And so the actual things
you might want to trigger,

44
00:02:34.677 --> 00:02:40.450
you do in commands, the actual roles
you put in the commands files.

45
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.050
Let's take a look at what that looks like.

46
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.330
Commands, we saw notepads.

47
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.046
We've seen enough markdown files in our
life to Kind of get the gist of what's

48
00:02:49.046 --> 00:02:50.040
going on here.

49
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.440
Commands are just things very
much like the notepads in cursor,

50
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.200
things that you might find
yourself repeating often.

51
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.080
And so they're accessible.

52
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.160
Just doing like lint in this case.

53
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.920
And effectively what that will do is it
will put this body of text into my prompt.

54
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.430
That's it.

55
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.070
In this case, run the following commands.

56
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.670
Make sure that everything passes
successfully, yada yada yada.

57
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.632
Ignore the warnings,

58
00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:22.470
because I have some of those file
length ones I showed you earlier.

59
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.790
Set to warn, not error, but
you must address all the errors.

60
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.910
And where do you think
this extra line came from?

61
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.350
Shockingly pretty good.

62
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.190
I'll show you another way that
you can handle that in a second.

63
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.700
Another one that I get
a lot of use out of is.

64
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.863
And again, whatever you type theoretically

65
00:03:52.863 --> 00:03:57.180
comes after the end of the prompt.

66
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.700
So I am still probably putting a rando
paragraph of my thoughts and feelings.

67
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.627
I usually I use TextMate, which is
just an old text edit from whatever,

68
00:04:08.627 --> 00:04:11.507
which I constantly have
1000 windows open where

69
00:04:11.507 --> 00:04:14.410
I've typed all sorts of
random scratch pad stuff.

70
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.850
So a lot of times I have.

71
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.614
While I was fixing the lint rules,
I was like brainstorming some thoughts and

72
00:04:20.614 --> 00:04:22.529
feelings and stuff like that.

73
00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:25.446
And sometimes I was doing it in Gemini or
with chatgpt and

74
00:04:25.446 --> 00:04:27.130
bouncing stuff back and forth.

75
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.050
So I got thoughts.

76
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.115
And so
a few things in this one is anything with

77
00:04:35.115 --> 00:04:39.100
a exclamation point in front of it.

78
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.460
It will run as a BASH command, so you
can interpolate BASH commands in there.

79
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.398
I'll show you another one in a second,
which is cool because it has a web

80
00:04:48.398 --> 00:04:53.257
search and you put the MCPC things
with documents and you can reference

81
00:04:53.257 --> 00:04:58.720
a bunch of files that you already
have if you want to synthesize stuff.

82
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.449
And so I'll kinda use that
to kind of build some of

83
00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.120
those files you saw on there.

84
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.200
And then a lot of times I will be
sitting there and editing them.

85
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.257
The other one that I think that I'll use
a lot, which is I have this shell script

86
00:05:13.257 --> 00:05:19.200
is all it's really doing is running git
status and finding my uncommitted files.

87
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.619
It's like review all the following rules
and make sure all the important function

88
00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:26.296
classes and methods have JSDOC
documentation explaining what they do and

89
00:05:26.296 --> 00:05:28.670
their purpose so
we can understand them later.

90
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.110
And then it will interpolate
all of these files.

91
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.769
I think I have the script might make
it a bolded markdown list because

92
00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:34.710
it doesn't need that.

93
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.288
But I am who I am.

94
00:05:37.288 --> 00:05:41.364
If you could put whatever you type will
be at the end of the file unless you put

95
00:05:41.364 --> 00:05:42.788
dollar arguments in it and

96
00:05:42.788 --> 00:05:46.190
then you can kind of interpolate
it in there somewhere else.

97
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.950
And again if you ention files
they'll get pulled into the context.

98
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:56.028
So I believe goal is literally
review productsummary markdown and

99
00:05:56.028 --> 00:06:01.140
I will pull that entire file
into context immediately.

100
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.180
So I have a few of my own rules that are
ridiculous but I don't wanna type that.

101
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.940
I don't wanna remember that.

102
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.660
I just know that I would do goal.

103
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.380
It will go pull in that file into context.

104
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.860
We talked a lot about keeping stuff
we don't want out of context.

105
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.268
This allows me to pull files
I do want into context and

106
00:06:19.268 --> 00:06:22.760
just run common commands
that I might otherwise use.

107
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.000
This is like a copy of my claude MD file.

108
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.704
It was an experiment but
I will kind of have a bunch of these

109
00:06:29.704 --> 00:06:33.920
that I will kind of just
trigger at any given point.
