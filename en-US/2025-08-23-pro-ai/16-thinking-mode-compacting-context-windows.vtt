00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.360
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: But
they also have this interesting thing.

2
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.480
This is actually true of
the anthropic API as well.

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.200
It just happens to work in Claude code.

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.774
In fact,
they mentioned the cloud code docs, but

5
00:00:09.774 --> 00:00:13.164
they kick you off to the regular
anthropic SDK docs at this point.

6
00:00:13.164 --> 00:00:18.573
Till I talk about this, which is, you
can use this thing called thinking mode,

7
00:00:18.573 --> 00:00:22.960
because we saw like 03 and
01 and 04 are reasoning models.

8
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.320
They engage in thinking.

9
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.840
Any of the anthropic models can engage
in thinking if you compel them to do so.

10
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.240
Which mechanism puts them
to extended reasoning?

11
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.024
They'll spend more time thinking
about what they're going to do and

12
00:00:40.024 --> 00:00:41.600
alternatives before they even try.

13
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.440
They'll think about what they
do before they do it again.

14
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.480
We all aspire to that.

15
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.532
Sometimes it's tricky,
obviously thinking cost tokens,

16
00:00:50.532 --> 00:00:56.673
but like, so does throwing away what
it just did because it was garbage and

17
00:00:56.673 --> 00:01:01.290
asking it to do it again,
it becomes a fine art.

18
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.970
So how do you do it?

19
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.730
You just use the word think in the prompt.

20
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.530
You just say, think about.

21
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.817
Think this through.

22
00:01:10.817 --> 00:01:17.630
If you say the word think, it will use
about 4,000 tokens of reasoning, right?

23
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.221
Like I said before, if you think about
the context window of Gemini and Opus,

24
00:01:21.221 --> 00:01:22.283
they're 2 million.

25
00:01:22.283 --> 00:01:26.790
So, it's not nothing, right?

26
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.310
That is like, 16,000 characters, right?

27
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.070
Like, Think Hard will
go up to 10,000 tokens.

28
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.848
I didn't know about Mega Think until I
reread the docs I like because I know that

29
00:01:41.848 --> 00:01:44.150
Think Harder and
Ultrathink do the same thing.

30
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.160
Which one do you think I use?

31
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.840
Ultrathink.

32
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.240
I have seen some people
use the ultrathink.

33
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.000
I don't believe that does anything.

34
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.320
Try it out.

35
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.103
Because like, Ultrathink maxing out at

36
00:01:58.103 --> 00:02:03.360
31,999 seems awfully specific to me,
right?

37
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.960
I cannot imagine.

38
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.774
Like, the rest are like around
10,000 tokens, around 4,000 tokens,

39
00:02:09.774 --> 00:02:11.160
31,999 tokens.

40
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.760
And I cannot believe that
ultrathink does anything.

41
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.260
Maybe I'm wrong, but
that seems oddly specific.

42
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.780
Now keep in mind,
all of those tokens cost more with Opus.

43
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.516
I would love to tell you there
is an answer of does Opus

44
00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:38.020
without Ultrathink outperform
Sonnet with Ultrathink?

45
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.110
And does the amount like, maybe.

46
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.750
I don't know.

47
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.070
I couldn't tell you, I am trying them all.

48
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.990
I'm getting a feel for it.

49
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.790
Like, and like, I don't have a.

50
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.270
This always works like this.

51
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.990
I'm like, you do start to
develop a sixth sense of like.

52
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.390
And then when I'm angry,
it's opus ultrathink.

53
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.670
And then I run,
I blow through my limit and I'm sad.

54
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.020
But like, it's a thing.

55
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.500
But it is worth thinking about again.

56
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.380
Reddit comment I posted before,
a good plan will save you tokens.

57
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.300
And so do you use the token
to come up with a good plan?

58
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.220
Do you write the good plan?

59
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.030
Do you sit there in Gemini in the chat
window and come up with a good plan and

60
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.420
paste it into the markdown thing and
not use any of these tokens?

61
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.990
I have done all three in
the last three days, yes.

62
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.670
I don't know.

63
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.390
I'm figuring it out.

64
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.030
This is the lint rules definitely work.

65
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.573
How do you jockey between and divide up
like the thinking times the model plus

66
00:03:48.573 --> 00:03:51.590
the tokens,
plus which rate limits apply where.

67
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.108
I mean, how I behave when I get the
warning that I'm approaching my rate limit

68
00:03:57.108 --> 00:04:00.110
is different than how I
behave at 8am in the morning.

69
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.950
So yeah, extended thinking could waste
tokens, it could save you tokens,

70
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.830
it could rewrite the whole thing in elm,
we don't know.

71
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.719
But yeah, okay, so, and we'll pull this
up in there in a second, but I think

72
00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:18.851
this is worth talking about before we jump
in is it has this notion of compacting

73
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:24.350
context windows, which I think has some
ergonomics that we need to think about.

74
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.150
And so cursor will just say you need
to start a new window now, a new chat.

75
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.177
Now Claude will do this thing of like
approaching context window limit.

76
00:04:37.177 --> 00:04:38.311
We're gonna precompat.

77
00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:40.110
We're gonna compact soon.

78
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.718
It's gonna happen where all compaction is,

79
00:04:42.718 --> 00:04:46.510
is it looks at the giant
summary of everything, right?

80
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.620
And it says,
it sends it back to the model.

81
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.900
That's why it needs some space to do it.

82
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.592
It says,
summarize this into a smaller thing,

83
00:04:56.592 --> 00:05:00.340
which you will lose some fidelity, right?

84
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.758
And so
if you're in the middle of a big thing,

85
00:05:04.758 --> 00:05:08.500
okay, you have no choice, right?

86
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.198
But what you don't want to have is, then I
started talking about something else, and

87
00:05:11.198 --> 00:05:12.903
then I went to this other task
because that's going to get

88
00:05:12.903 --> 00:05:13.740
summarized to your thing.

89
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.451
You're going to lose fidelity of the thing
you cared about to keep context of

90
00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:22.170
the thing you stopped caring
about hours ago, right?

91
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.690
And so yeah, shrinking it down, take
a bunch of tokens, make it less tokens,

92
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.410
not that hard to think about.

93
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.970
You can call compact anytime you want,
right?

94
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:41.850
And one belief system is you should do
it like whenever you're between a Task.

95
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.360
I would argue there's also clear,
which is like starting a new chat.

96
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.960
And if you're truly switching tasks,

97
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.040
I don't even need to
compact it at that point.

98
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.320
You know what I mean?

99
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.320
That's a, you know, your mileage may vary
kind of thing, but you can trigger one.

100
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.606
If you don't, it will do it right,

101
00:05:59.606 --> 00:06:04.280
but you're probably better off having
some control in when you do it.

102
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.876
So switching tasks, any kind of
natural stopping point you call

103
00:06:07.876 --> 00:06:12.668
compact it will take your long context
window, smush it, that's a technical term,

104
00:06:12.668 --> 00:06:13.820
into a smaller one.

105
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.980
Yes, you lose words.

106
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.540
Hopefully, it does it well.

107
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.992
You can like, if you do it yourself
though, you can also give it a prompt in

108
00:06:22.992 --> 00:06:26.180
a few words of like, hey,
this is what I care about.

109
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.420
And it will take that into consideration.

110
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.186
If you don't do that, and
it does it automatically,

111
00:06:31.186 --> 00:06:33.826
because it's hit the point
where I gotta compact,

112
00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:38.110
I'm gonna blow through the context window,
it's gonna yolo it, right?

113
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.550
And you might get the thing you want.

114
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.470
You might get the thing,
not get the thing you want.

115
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.630
So like, generally speaking,

116
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.430
compacting it down or
clearing it out is the path forward.

117
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.694
And again, if you do it yourself, you can
at least give a summarization of like,

118
00:06:52.694 --> 00:06:56.910
only keep the to do items or summarize
it down to just the things about this.

119
00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.030
And it will do that.

120
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.876
If you don't do it yourself,
you're rolling the dice and

121
00:07:00.876 --> 00:07:02.510
hoping it makes good decisions.

122
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.910
Alternatively, this is the same as
quitting it and starting it again,

123
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.839
which I did for the longest time until
it encouraged me to hit slash and

124
00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:11.320
see what the other commands were.

125
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.320
That works as well.

126
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.120
It's great.

127
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.200
It will totally wipe it out.

128
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.280
There is possibly one reason why
you wouldn't want to use this.

129
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.440
And I'll show you this in a second.
