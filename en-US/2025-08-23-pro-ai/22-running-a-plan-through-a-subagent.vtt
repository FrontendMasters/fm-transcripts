00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.120
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's try it out.

2
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.640
I might have to like.

3
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.611
It'll probably take a while.

4
00:00:03.611 --> 00:00:06.320
So let's kick it off and we'll kind
of check in on it in a little bit.

5
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.520
Where's my terminal?

6
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.440
Did I make it small?

7
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.003
We're not in the right app.

8
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:14.400
All right, let's make that big.

9
00:00:17.156 --> 00:00:18.731
Look, it thinks it's ready to do it.

10
00:00:18.731 --> 00:00:24.610
Let's make it, I'm just

11
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:31.299
gonna clear this real quick.

12
00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:32.926
I'm gonna grab another one of those plans.

13
00:00:32.926 --> 00:00:34.570
Let's say.

14
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.970
Doesn't really matter which one we pick.

15
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.130
Let's actually pick that same TRPC one.

16
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.010
Just for funsies.

17
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.140
I'll actually open up another window.

18
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.194
We'll make an agent as well.

19
00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:07.195
But we'll kick this off so
we can go check,

20
00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:12.700
provide answers to those questions and

21
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.703
write both the questions and

22
00:01:16.703 --> 00:01:21.470
answers to I don't know TRPC md.

23
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.768
This is why no one would like
to share Git Repo with me.

24
00:01:25.768 --> 00:01:28.190
Cool, so it's gonna go read that.

25
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.070
You should see some colors in
a second where it passes off.

26
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.550
There's junior engineer JavaScript yellow.

27
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.950
Felt good.

28
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.710
I forget what color I picked for
the other one.

29
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.590
Doesn't matter.

30
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.910
Junior Engineer is going
to read all of it.

31
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.585
You can see that only Junior Engineer is
going to do that at first and then it's

32
00:01:42.585 --> 00:01:45.070
going to pass it over to the other one and
then we'll see what comes out.

33
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.310
I don't know.
Well, anything could happen.

34
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.430
It could be a waste of everyone's time.

35
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.910
Or not.

36
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.739
In the meantime,
we're going to open up a second

37
00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:55.989
one of these just to show you
how we can make one of these.

38
00:01:55.989 --> 00:02:01.750
So do cod and
I'm gonna say /agents, plural.

39
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.676
So here you can see all the agents that
you have and you can say create new agent.

40
00:02:09.676 --> 00:02:13.320
And we can say project or
in my home directory, let's say project.

41
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.397
In this case, generate with Claude and

42
00:02:16.397 --> 00:02:21.760
you kind of just get a sense of
what we might want to build.

43
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.643
Does anyone have any ideas?

44
00:02:24.643 --> 00:02:26.068
Otherwise we're doing DevOps agent.

45
00:02:26.068 --> 00:02:27.520
No one's gonna like that.

46
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.440
Be a non technical user.

47
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.440
Non technical user.

48
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.240
A non.

49
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.891
What do I have to do that's

50
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:46.671
testing the app or something.

51
00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:47.610
All right, let's do it.

52
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.819
So then it will go ahead and
generate the agent configuration.

53
00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.008
And so one of the things you can do.

54
00:02:57.008 --> 00:03:02.255
So for instance, I'm thinking
that our non technical user and

55
00:03:02.255 --> 00:03:05.225
we can actually get more granular,

56
00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:10.640
should not be able to write or
edit any files, right?

57
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.400
Maybe they could read plans.

58
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.640
They should not be able to
get us out of plan mode.

59
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.048
Honestly, a non technical user shouldn't
be able to do a lot of things.

60
00:03:20.048 --> 00:03:25.838
Maybe give it web fetch.

61
00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:27.080
No, you're not a product manager.

62
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.160
You can do web search.

63
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.980
You can't do execute code.

64
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.748
No, you cannot.

65
00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:38.860
You can give it kind of a set of tasks
that you think it should be able to do.

66
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.272
And then the most important
part is the color.

67
00:03:46.272 --> 00:03:51.177
So yeah, it will kind of give you a draft
and I'll show you the one thing that I

68
00:03:51.177 --> 00:03:54.950
think is a little squirrely
about this in a second second.

69
00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.590
But you can kind of,
let's actually just look at the file.

70
00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.270
So hit enter to save it and

71
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.150
then over in agents you can see we
have a new one not checked into git.

72
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.390
So let's go take a look at that.

73
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.700
And I don't know why it decides for a YAML
front matter description this is where it

74
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.710
should shove the bulk of the content.

75
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.470
I don't make the rules around here.

76
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.407
That seems like a lot of extra stuff that
I can barely read because of the way they

77
00:04:20.407 --> 00:04:21.430
chose to format it.

78
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.835
But like I don't make
the rules around here.

79
00:04:25.835 --> 00:04:31.374
And then it Claude generated its Persona.

80
00:04:31.374 --> 00:04:34.680
Like this always frame feedback
in terms of user impact.

81
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.680
Users might get confused because
this could frustrate user trying to.

82
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.770
And it gives it a nice set of constraints
to kind of come in there as well.

83
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.420
And now you have access and all you have
to really do is mention it by name and

84
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.580
then the main agent will
farm something out of it.

85
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.860
Just as we saw junior agent was engaged
in that terminal window we had earlier.

86
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.940
And then we probably will see if
we go back our friends are done.

87
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.860
So again to be clear,
I don't know how this is going to go.

88
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.592
I'm interested.

89
00:05:10.592 --> 00:05:13.380
I've done this before and
I've been pleased.

90
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.786
But I can't promise you I'm going
to like what I see in here.

91
00:05:16.786 --> 00:05:20.820
For a feature that came
out a few days ago,

92
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.207
those are all my crazy
tool uses from before.

93
00:05:25.207 --> 00:05:28.950
Let's close that,
buy ourselves some space.

94
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.322
Okay.

95
00:05:31.322 --> 00:05:33.366
I'm kind of into it, right?

96
00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:37.109
Obviously like you know,
one needs to look at this a little closer.

97
00:05:37.109 --> 00:05:41.927
So like I said before, the test that we
gave our sub agent earlier was the junior

98
00:05:41.927 --> 00:05:46.380
engineer was told to question everything
as the person who's gonna be on

99
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.109
the hook for doing it and
clarify anything that was unclear.

100
00:05:50.109 --> 00:05:54.968
And then theoretically the front end
architect answered the questions.

101
00:05:54.968 --> 00:05:58.233
Now I think this is useful for
me to figure out where.

102
00:05:58.233 --> 00:05:59.527
My own thinking is unclear.

103
00:05:59.527 --> 00:06:01.202
I wouldn't just feed this in somewhere.

104
00:06:01.202 --> 00:06:05.156
This is like the next step is for
me to read it.

105
00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:10.331
The current auto generated tool system,
which I built with eight content tools,

106
00:06:10.331 --> 00:06:13.262
poses significant integration challenges.

107
00:06:13.262 --> 00:06:15.943
How do we maintain the current bundle and
generate tools?

108
00:06:15.943 --> 00:06:20.422
Blah blah, blah, blah blah blah.

109
00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:24.509
Create a hybrid approach, extends your
tool system rather than replacing it and

110
00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.381
suggests what that code looks like.

111
00:06:26.381 --> 00:06:30.892
And again, if you've never seen my code
base or TRPC before, don't worry about it.

112
00:06:30.892 --> 00:06:35.593
But the interesting part is
this is like I've said before,

113
00:06:35.593 --> 00:06:41.517
I think generating code with AI is
interesting and makes some cool demos and

114
00:06:41.517 --> 00:06:47.179
I think it's definitely take some of
the side projects and do it for me.

115
00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:52.373
The interesting part has been one
questioning my own thinking because when

116
00:06:52.373 --> 00:06:57.815
I sit down and read this later, I will
either be like absolutely not or yeah,

117
00:06:57.815 --> 00:07:02.777
or I'm missing something here and
I will integrate that into the plan.

118
00:07:02.777 --> 00:07:07.193
Like I said before, when I wanted to
learn more about how Claude code works,

119
00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:10.436
I grabbed the minified code,
tossed it into a model that

120
00:07:10.436 --> 00:07:14.789
had a giant context window like Gemini or
03 and it was the minified code.

121
00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:18.537
I'm like, I can't tell you everything,
but I'm like,

122
00:07:18.537 --> 00:07:21.378
what is the moving pieces and
shape of this?

123
00:07:21.378 --> 00:07:24.290
Or some library that you
don't fully understand.

124
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:28.368
I'll show you an interesting way to get
a synopsis of a library to do this super

125
00:07:28.368 --> 00:07:29.890
easily in about one second.

126
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.533
But like, or like even just like,
hey, given this thing,

127
00:07:36.533 --> 00:07:43.020
what are the trade offs of each and what
is the best fit for this situation, right?

128
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.775
And then like sometimes that will
inspire a question for me of like, or

129
00:07:45.775 --> 00:07:48.700
should I just use postgres like
a normal person, you know what I mean?

130
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.743
Or something along those lines.

131
00:07:49.743 --> 00:07:53.820
And for
me a lot of times asking about things or

132
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.362
trying to understand how stuff works,

133
00:07:57.362 --> 00:08:01.885
has been even sometimes my own code base,
right?

134
00:08:01.885 --> 00:08:04.390
Like, you know, in this case,
like this is my own code base.

135
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.350
This is a plan that I kind of like,
you know,

136
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.676
I did this full stack type safety
thing where we did a lot of TRCs.

137
00:08:11.676 --> 00:08:14.263
I was like, I never thought about
using it for Chrome's messaging.

138
00:08:14.263 --> 00:08:16.768
I was talking about HTTP,
I was like, would this work?

139
00:08:16.768 --> 00:08:20.407
Is this a thing or
am I like overthinking this?

140
00:08:20.407 --> 00:08:22.420
And so
that's where this whole thing started.

141
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.106
And so I can now read this and
kind of like go through it later.

142
00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:29.085
I know it seems like a lot but
like, look at that.

143
00:08:29.085 --> 00:08:33.696
The question Service worker lifespan like,
hey, manifest V3 service workers

144
00:08:33.696 --> 00:08:37.709
can't maintain persistent connections and
do the stuff TRPC needs.

145
00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:39.289
How are we gonna deal with that?

146
00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:44.051
Fun fact, I knew about the fact that
they don't stay alive in V3, and

147
00:08:44.051 --> 00:08:48.030
I never thought what that means for
a TRPC server, right?

148
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.830
Like, that's a pretty good idea.

149
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.974
I don't know that I love this answer.

150
00:08:51.974 --> 00:08:55.455
And so maybe I abandoned this entire plan,
right?

151
00:08:55.455 --> 00:09:00.368
We can argue that generating code makes
you faster, but also even tools that

152
00:09:00.368 --> 00:09:04.822
help me consider the implications
of what I was considering doing and

153
00:09:04.822 --> 00:09:09.353
abandoning a plan makes me way faster
because it's slow getting three

154
00:09:09.353 --> 00:09:14.465
quarters of the way through a plan and
then having to throw it all away, right?

155
00:09:14.465 --> 00:09:19.220
And I think that there's a lot of
power in using these tools that

156
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:24.170
effectively have a shocking amount
of information at disposal.

157
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.010
Some of this might be hallucinated,
I don't know.

158
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:31.450
But I can at least go ahead and
continue thinking about it.

159
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:32.170
I'm already.

160
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:32.756
I don't know.

161
00:09:32.756 --> 00:09:33.530
I love this plan.

162
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:36.161
Now granted,
as you saw just the demo before,

163
00:09:36.161 --> 00:09:39.890
I used probably a ton of sonnet tokens,
so opus tokens to planet.

164
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.342
So yes,
I would do this beforehand normally, but

165
00:09:44.342 --> 00:09:47.525
these are good questions, right?

166
00:09:47.525 --> 00:09:50.623
What do you do with CSP, right?

167
00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:53.510
And the content script boundary and
how they, again,

168
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.542
if you haven't been working on a Chrome
extension, don't worry about it.

169
00:09:57.542 --> 00:09:59.463
But I'm like, yeah.

170
00:09:59.463 --> 00:10:02.152
And so sometimes just
understanding the problem and

171
00:10:02.152 --> 00:10:04.719
thinking about it from
different angles is wild,

172
00:10:04.719 --> 00:10:08.463
especially because I don't have a full
team to just riff with right now.

173
00:10:08.463 --> 00:10:13.303
And I think if you're newer in your
career, being able to just either

174
00:10:13.303 --> 00:10:18.310
analyze existing code bases or again,
even if you read through this and

175
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:22.251
going like,
I don't understand what that word means.

176
00:10:22.251 --> 00:10:23.775
I don't understand what that word means.

177
00:10:23.775 --> 00:10:25.098
I don't understand what that word means.

178
00:10:25.098 --> 00:10:27.535
Amazing, cuz you know
what you can do next?

179
00:10:27.535 --> 00:10:29.702
Go in and
figure out what those things mean.

180
00:10:29.702 --> 00:10:34.195
Either use deep research or some of those
things and actually get a sense and

181
00:10:34.195 --> 00:10:38.973
prompting technique that doesn't that
works in any case, both in this tool and

182
00:10:38.973 --> 00:10:40.139
everything else.

183
00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:43.211
Explain it to me like I'm five.

184
00:10:43.211 --> 00:10:47.138
Use [LAUGH] metaphors and pictures.

185
00:10:47.138 --> 00:10:50.735
You know, like I did this course
like a while back where like,

186
00:10:50.735 --> 00:10:55.231
I know all the JavaScript we're playing
with Arduinos and occasionally I can

187
00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:59.673
remember the difference between voltage,
like amperes and like wattage.

188
00:10:59.673 --> 00:11:04.554
Occasionally I'm like, explain it to me
like I'm five with metaphors about how

189
00:11:04.554 --> 00:11:06.800
water flows through a pipe, right?

190
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.703
And it works just as well for
this shockingly well,

191
00:11:09.703 --> 00:11:11.870
which I think is totally worthwhile.
