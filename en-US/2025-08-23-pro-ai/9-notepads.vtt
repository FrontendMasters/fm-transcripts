00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.130
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You could probably guess
what a notepad is just from the name.

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.040
It's a place where you keep notes.

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.240
The reason that I don't use these as often
anymore is that they are a cursor feature.

4
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.119
There's nothing wrong with that.

5
00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.125
Cursor is great, we like Cursor,
we're looking at Cursor right now.

6
00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:23.120
And cursor features
are available to Cursor.

7
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.770
However, let's say I wanted to use that.

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.770
OpenAI codecs.

9
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.670
Ain't no notepads there.

10
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.430
Let's say I want to use Claude code.

11
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.370
No notepads there.

12
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.930
Do you know what works everywhere?

13
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.970
Markdown files.

14
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.987
Lot of markdown files.

15
00:00:40.987 --> 00:00:46.035
But there are some nice things
you do in your notepad and

16
00:00:46.035 --> 00:00:52.864
then you can just include that body of
text and then you just reference it.

17
00:00:52.864 --> 00:00:55.441
Like you could reference a file,
but it's not on your file system.

18
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:58.601
Effectively, I like markdown files
cuz they're on my file system.

19
00:00:58.601 --> 00:00:59.566
I can check them to version control.

20
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.301
I can share between tools.

21
00:01:01.301 --> 00:01:03.254
Nice part about these is
they're not on my file system.

22
00:01:03.254 --> 00:01:04.800
Not checked into version control.

23
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.760
Figure out what you need.

24
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.487
I these days tend to use
more of the markdown files.

25
00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:14.409
But like, I also work on
a project by myself these days for

26
00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.061
the last three months.

27
00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:19.499
And I think that if I was checking
in random markdown files into git

28
00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:21.760
all the time, my teammates would kill me.

29
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.019
So your mileage may vary.

30
00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:27.555
There are good parts or
there are bad parts.

31
00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:30.640
There are bad parts, are there good parts?

32
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.650
You can add them and
include them in the context.

33
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.913
You can edit them.

34
00:01:34.913 --> 00:01:37.600
You can also do Cmd+Shift+P and add more.

35
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.120
You give them a good name.

36
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.432
You can pull them into the context.

37
00:01:41.432 --> 00:01:44.392
They are ephemeral to your environment.

38
00:01:44.392 --> 00:01:46.608
A lot of these tools have, again,

39
00:01:46.608 --> 00:01:50.898
we saw those user rules versus
project rules and all those things.

40
00:01:50.898 --> 00:01:53.964
There's a lot of things that you want
checked and shared on your team, but

41
00:01:53.964 --> 00:01:55.700
sometimes you need your personal space.

42
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.651
Sometimes you need just the things.

43
00:01:57.651 --> 00:02:02.784
It's like the debate that has
raged on in every engineering

44
00:02:02.784 --> 00:02:08.340
team that I've ever worked on is,
do you check VS code into git?

45
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.620
Not here to answer it.

46
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.780
I've been on both sides.

47
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.500
I've not even been
consistent over the years.

48
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.015
It's like, if I like the settings,
yes, put them in there.

49
00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:18.845
If I don't like the settings,
they better not be in there.

50
00:02:18.845 --> 00:02:22.639
So it's basically, am I the boss or not?

51
00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.077
So some best practices
use descriptive names.

52
00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:27.510
It's got the same rules for
everything else.

53
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.670
Because again, managing the context
window is the Name of the game.

54
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.550
Rules are always on.

55
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.712
Notepads effectively are ephemeral.

56
00:02:38.712 --> 00:02:40.086
They're not stored in git.

57
00:02:40.086 --> 00:02:43.940
You can pull them in when you need, but

58
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.130
only when you need,
because tokens aren't free.

59
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.541
Again, even if you think you're
on a plan where they're free,

60
00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:55.139
you are rate limited in some way,
shape or form.

61
00:02:55.139 --> 00:03:02.610
So we can say notepad create and
open a new notepad.

62
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.462
We can argue that you never even have
to reference this one to the AI agent.

63
00:03:06.462 --> 00:03:11.056
This is also nice because if you're not
checking that markdown file into git

64
00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:13.711
because you don't want everyone to see it,

65
00:03:13.711 --> 00:03:18.228
we all know you left it on your desktop,
we all know your desktop is a mess and

66
00:03:18.228 --> 00:03:22.210
you might as well at least have it
in the project or in your editor.

67
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.170
So there's that too.

68
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.658
But again, where I think what's really
important here and where I would say that

69
00:03:29.658 --> 00:03:34.278
using notepads, and we'll see you can do
this with commands in cloud code as well,

70
00:03:34.278 --> 00:03:35.680
is you can ention files.

71
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.280
So let's say, hey, for this one feature,
we've got a reducer over here,

72
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.600
we've got a context API over here,
we've got the test file here, and

73
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.315
maybe we've got a markdown file that
has again, the product requirements for

74
00:03:46.315 --> 00:03:47.520
what we're working on.

75
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.760
You do not want to keep typing that.

76
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.578
If you said something like

77
00:03:54.578 --> 00:03:59.396
look at use calculator and

78
00:03:59.396 --> 00:04:04.214
before doing anything has

79
00:04:04.214 --> 00:04:09.251
the utilities that you need

80
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:13.850
before making new ones.

81
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.970
You can mention other rules,
you can mention other files.

82
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.462
And now let's give this thing a name.

83
00:04:23.462 --> 00:04:27.684
Where'd it go on my tiny screen?

84
00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.017
There it is.

85
00:04:29.017 --> 00:04:36.848
I can do it here we'll say like.

86
00:04:36.848 --> 00:04:42.959
And so now, let's say you have,

87
00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:48.420
and I guess also look at math.

88
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.801
And now you can just do calculator notes,
which you pull in this file and

89
00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:55.153
it will then pull in the other pieces.

90
00:04:55.153 --> 00:04:58.638
So if you have a reusable set of prompt.

91
00:04:58.638 --> 00:05:02.893
Sometimes the Notepad file, again,
advantages, it's not in version control,

92
00:05:02.893 --> 00:05:04.432
it's not on the file system.

93
00:05:04.432 --> 00:05:07.300
Disadvantages, it's not in version
control, it's not in file system.

94
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.140
Hey, today I am working on this thing with
these files I'm prompting all the time.

95
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.500
I'm getting tired of writing this.

96
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.890
You can go ahead and make a note and
then you don't have to keep it.

97
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.562
The other one,

98
00:05:26.562 --> 00:05:31.929
here's one that I have

99
00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:38.144
this as a claude command,

100
00:05:38.144 --> 00:05:42.663
but here's one for

101
00:05:42.663 --> 00:05:47.747
you you can argue this

102
00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:53.700
should be a rule format.

103
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.860
Having it fix your lint errors and
your type check errors.

104
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.280
You can get to the point where it gets
reliable will save you hours a day.
