00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.348
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Well, now if I leave
this file in here and it's open and

2
00:00:02.348 --> 00:00:03.842
all of a sudden, it's fair game.

3
00:00:03.842 --> 00:00:07.975
And so if you start getting results
that you don't want, look inward and

4
00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:10.160
ask yourself like, is this my fault?

5
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.139
Sometimes it's not.

6
00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.360
Sometimes again, there are good Claude
days, there are bad Claude days.

7
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.675
So we'll delete that file.

8
00:00:16.675 --> 00:00:20.960
And now let's try progressively
move up to wilder modes.

9
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.246
We're in agent mode here and

10
00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:28.818
we are going to say, and

11
00:00:28.818 --> 00:00:34.540
I'm going to say I can make a new file.

12
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.466
I don't trust it all the time.

13
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.737
So we're going to make.

14
00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:43.300
Okay, I'm not gonna waste your
time with the small brain version.

15
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.121
We're going to move to at least
the medium sized brain version.

16
00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:51.286
It is one thing to say
build me a calculator,

17
00:00:51.286 --> 00:00:55.009
that could go one of many ways, right?

18
00:00:55.009 --> 00:01:01.630
What I want to say is in calculator tsx,
right?

19
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.750
Build a calculator component.

20
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.002
Now if I do that, I will probably
get something that resembles

21
00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:20.105
a calculator component, but
I can get a little bit more specific.

22
00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:25.400
Put that component in @application.tsx.

23
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.786
Now it's going to read Calculator TSX,

24
00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:28.920
which at this point doesn't
really have anything in it.

25
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.640
It's going to look at application tx.

26
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.640
So we're getting more specific
about then what do I want it to do?

27
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.996
We'll say I want you to use

28
00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:46.190
usereducer to handle the logic.

29
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:56.323
The actual math should be
done in a separate utility so

30
00:01:56.323 --> 00:02:02.970
I can test it with 100% test coverage.

31
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.294
The calculator should be accessible and

32
00:02:09.294 --> 00:02:14.850
use tailwind to style it, right?

33
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.891
The more specific you get, the more
predictable your outcome is going to be.

34
00:02:17.891 --> 00:02:18.450
Mark.

35
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.353
&gt;&gt; Mark: Shouldn't you create a new chat?

36
00:02:20.353 --> 00:02:20.853
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I should.

37
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.878
So honestly, if you're in the chat window
and let's say ask me how I know this

38
00:02:26.878 --> 00:02:31.090
because Mark hit on why I know this,
which is I get distracted.

39
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.558
Let's say you typed all this command N,

40
00:02:35.558 --> 00:02:42.300
it moves it to a new chat with
the current contents in there.

41
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.913
You can even see the things
that I've brought into

42
00:02:45.913 --> 00:02:49.020
context are also referenced here as well.

43
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.779
Do I need big brains for this?

44
00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:55.020
I don't need big brains for this.

45
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.700
Go ahead.

46
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.549
And now we are effectively in agent mode.

47
00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.046
And for
some of this it's kind of like makes,

48
00:03:06.046 --> 00:03:10.000
on one hand it's amazing because it
will do this faster than I can do it.

49
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.112
On the other hand we will sit here and
watch this thinking, right?

50
00:03:13.112 --> 00:03:16.356
And I'm gonna scroll up and we're going to
look at some of its thinking for a second.

51
00:03:16.356 --> 00:03:20.964
Great, I can see the Tailwind CSSV4 and
VITest are already set up now create

52
00:03:20.964 --> 00:03:25.789
a comprehensive calculator and I talked
about that to do list feature, right?

53
00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:28.393
So it starts to if first of all,

54
00:03:28.393 --> 00:03:34.540
we'll try to at least tell you that
it understood what you asked for.

55
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.780
Again, ignore this at your peril.

56
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.870
But then don't be surprised that
it did something you didn't like

57
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.874
accessible design.

58
00:03:40.874 --> 00:03:42.940
Cool, we'll use Tailwind styling.

59
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.660
I forgot to mention responsive design.

60
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.660
So thank you for that.

61
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.780
And then it creates a to do
list you can go ahead and see.

62
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.380
And so in this case we are phase where we
are kind of approving this step by step.

63
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.586
So we've got calculator error like okay,
maybe that's slight over engineering but

64
00:04:05.586 --> 00:04:11.460
it's a good pattern as it's starting to
build this feature out for me right now.

65
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.263
Granted one even in this simple
example that was trying to walk that

66
00:04:16.263 --> 00:04:21.300
fine line of live typing English
is harder than live coding.

67
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.510
It wasn't so boring to watch me write.

68
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.830
Was still not build me Excel.

69
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.379
It was still like hey, here's what I want.

70
00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:32.729
Here are the initial rules and

71
00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.708
you're gonna see I would get real
bored typing those every time.

72
00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:39.134
So we'll deal with that momentarily.

73
00:04:39.134 --> 00:04:44.126
But you can kind of see that
the better you can explain what

74
00:04:44.126 --> 00:04:48.915
you want to do,
the better it is going to be at doing it.

75
00:04:48.915 --> 00:04:54.035
Is having some issues finding a thing but
a lot of times it will figure out

76
00:04:54.035 --> 00:04:59.643
I have some problems because again we're
getting that feedback loop in this case.

77
00:04:59.643 --> 00:05:02.972
Cool, cannot find what's your issue.

78
00:05:02.972 --> 00:05:04.640
Can't see in that giant font.

79
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.542
But it seems to continue going
as it's navigating that.

80
00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:14.050
Okay, now you can see it's doing
all the steps as we think and

81
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.045
we start to get something
that we can at least review.

82
00:05:18.045 --> 00:05:24.229
What I want to show you is the UX for
doing so right now the lazy and

83
00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:29.948
dangerous thing to do is just
slam on the keep all button and

84
00:05:29.948 --> 00:05:36.135
move on with your life and
like follow the vibes where they go and

85
00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:42.351
yeah, that's a thing you can do it and
sometimes I do it right.

86
00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:47.195
The other option is one you can
first of all see the manifest of all

87
00:05:47.195 --> 00:05:49.001
the things that it did.

88
00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:52.083
Here's all the files that I made and

89
00:05:52.083 --> 00:05:56.740
changed almost like a git diff,
like pre git.

90
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.325
You can see that it actually pulled in
some terminal commands into context as it

91
00:06:01.325 --> 00:06:03.344
was fighting with the type setup.

92
00:06:03.344 --> 00:06:05.540
Cuz literally didn't use this repo for
anything.

93
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.876
Don't know anything about it.

94
00:06:07.876 --> 00:06:10.130
And you can see all the files,
you can go ahead.

95
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.530
And more importantly, in a given file,
now, these are a lot of new files.

96
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.450
So there's one change.

97
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.410
It is the contents of a file.

98
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.977
But if it was like changing a bunch
of functions in line somewhere,

99
00:06:20.977 --> 00:06:23.970
you could jump down and
across through all of them.

100
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:30.580
The other important one is going
across the different files.

101
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:37.320
You can also use option L for that as well
and go through and see each one, right?

102
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.572
And we know that there are some issues
that we're gonna have to deal with here,

103
00:06:40.572 --> 00:06:42.715
which is like,
there are some red squiggly lines.

104
00:06:42.715 --> 00:06:45.867
So I know typescript is angry with us, so

105
00:06:45.867 --> 00:06:50.245
it clearly didn't,
we gotta see when we commit it all.

106
00:06:50.245 --> 00:06:53.600
But I have reason to believe that it
made at least some mistakes, right?

107
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.400
Like, did I want all this?

108
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.440
Did I ask for this little banner?

109
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.840
I did not.

110
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.670
So you can just go ahead and be like, no.

111
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:06.867
Like, you're still like.

112
00:07:06.867 --> 00:07:12.182
The nice part about cursor, as opposed
to some of the other tools is that,

113
00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:17.239
like, at least where you are still
in the driver's seat, if you get to

114
00:07:17.239 --> 00:07:22.727
the point where you have, like, tests and
eslint rules and cursor rules and

115
00:07:22.727 --> 00:07:27.759
all of these other things,
maybe you can get a little nicer about it.

116
00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:31.584
Right now I can name you a whole bunch
of things I don't like about this, and

117
00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:32.995
a lot of them are nitpicky.

118
00:07:32.995 --> 00:07:37.920
I like hyphens, which,
whatever, that's the thing.

119
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.584
And we'll talk about how to set up those
rules, both in terms of cursor rules, but

120
00:07:42.584 --> 00:07:46.722
also in terms of eslint rules that
enforce it, so on and so forth, Mark.

121
00:07:46.722 --> 00:07:50.857
&gt;&gt; Mark: Adam in the chat said,
my agent wrote tests, the test failed,

122
00:07:50.857 --> 00:07:54.620
and now it's just stuck looking
at the test and loading.

123
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.488
Do you know how to resolve?

124
00:07:57.488 --> 00:08:01.700
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, so a lot of times
you should have some kind of stop button

125
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.940
where it's time to yell at it to stop,
right?

126
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.854
Which at one point you need to step in and

127
00:08:06.854 --> 00:08:10.235
arguably take a look at it and be like,
what is the actual issue here?

128
00:08:10.235 --> 00:08:13.810
Because a lot of times it will
keep spinning and cursor,

129
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.397
each one of these actions is
what's called a tool call.

130
00:08:17.397 --> 00:08:22.675
It will give up after 25
tool calls because both like

131
00:08:22.675 --> 00:08:27.854
their money and your money,
effectively, right?

132
00:08:27.854 --> 00:08:30.646
At which point that is when we do
have to kind of like, step in and

133
00:08:30.646 --> 00:08:32.300
a lot of times give it some guidance.

134
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:39.495
Like I said before, the better you
can express the problem or the issue.

135
00:08:39.495 --> 00:08:40.235
It can help you.

136
00:08:40.235 --> 00:08:43.112
But it will a lot of times get
stuck in these loops, right?

137
00:08:43.112 --> 00:08:47.332
So arguably, and we'll see it,
there should be a stop button here.

138
00:08:47.332 --> 00:08:52.143
I'm obviously stopped, so

139
00:08:52.143 --> 00:08:56.552
it's hard for me to see if I

140
00:08:56.552 --> 00:09:01.170
just have it do something.

141
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.211
All right, then you got a stop button and
you can kind of like step in.

142
00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:06.785
This is not only important for
when it gets caught in a loop, but

143
00:09:06.785 --> 00:09:09.571
sometimes because it's telling
you everything it's going to do.

144
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:12.713
Like, sometimes you can see
it going down a dark path.

145
00:09:12.713 --> 00:09:17.373
Like, I'm going to skip all these tests.

146
00:09:17.373 --> 00:09:18.350
I normally do this one.

147
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.593
It's Ctrl+C.

148
00:09:19.593 --> 00:09:23.570
I'm very used to hitting the escape key
in Claude code, which we'll see later.

149
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:24.970
My hand hovers over it.

150
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.650
It's even hovering over it
as I stand at this podium.

151
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.810
Even though it's not the right
keystroke for this one.

152
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:31.680
But I think we'll see how
some of the rules can.

153
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.322
We'll look at cursor rules and then we'll
look at some draconian eslint rules and

154
00:09:36.322 --> 00:09:40.170
we'll see how do we build the framework,
the Iron man suit around.

155
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.637
This doesn't look right metaphor for
managing some of this, but you can see

156
00:09:43.637 --> 00:09:47.580
that it will do some stuff that I don't
hate, but I didn't necessarily ask for.

157
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.860
Okay, so we've seen what agent mode is.

158
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.140
We've seen what that surgical mode is.

159
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.740
We've seen what the tab mode is,
we've seen what the chat mode is.

160
00:09:54.740 --> 00:10:01.580
I feel like we can not follow
my advice for a moment.

161
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.700
Just kind of see it in place.

162
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.540
We can see that we have
some of these rules.

163
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.420
And you can see, once again,
this is again, an empty project.

164
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.695
And I will show you a project I
have in a second where I've like,

165
00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:17.712
progressively clamped down on things,
which is, did it do what I asked?

166
00:10:17.712 --> 00:10:24.925
Technically, I said I want all the files
to be kebab case instead of camel case.

167
00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:28.314
It spiritually did what I asked it to do.

168
00:10:28.314 --> 00:10:30.898
You know what I didn't ask it to do?

169
00:10:30.898 --> 00:10:34.582
Remove the old ones, right?

170
00:10:34.582 --> 00:10:36.635
And so we'll see how to deal
with that rules in a second.

171
00:10:36.635 --> 00:10:41.623
But again, it's like one of those things
where it's that joke that I said earlier.

172
00:10:41.623 --> 00:10:45.992
The person writes the test and
then you try to do the most subversive

173
00:10:45.992 --> 00:10:51.313
implementation you can, except you're
paying this person and it's not real.

174
00:10:51.313 --> 00:10:54.201
So we've got those pieces in place.

175
00:10:54.201 --> 00:10:58.650
Which point we should talk about
how to start expressing our intent

176
00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.623
about the way we want things
done around here to cursor, and

177
00:11:02.623 --> 00:11:05.810
that involves this thing
called cursor rules.
