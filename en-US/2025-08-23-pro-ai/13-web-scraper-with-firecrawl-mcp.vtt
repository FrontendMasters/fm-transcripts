1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.042
&gt;&gt; Stee Kinney: So you go into Cursor.

2
00:00:01.042 --> 00:00:02.868
We saw those Cursor settings earlier.

3
00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:07.359
You go into tools integrations, you can
hook up GitHub, you can hook up Slack and

4
00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:09.155
you can also say add custom mcp.

5
00:00:09.155 --> 00:00:11.420
Cursor has some functionality
now where the web.

6
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.220
You can have a button
called Add to Cursor.

7
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.740
You can click on it,
it will do all this for you.

8
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.784
But if you wanted to pull in one because a
lot of them could just be NPM packages or

9
00:00:19.784 --> 00:00:23.220
you can write your own that has
like some bespoke functionality and

10
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.068
like hook it into your own systems,
so on and so forth.

11
00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:28.643
I think the power is
probably building your own.

12
00:00:28.643 --> 00:00:31.020
But yeah, you go hit that add custom mcp.

13
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.596
There is some configuration that I didn't
want to show you on mine because I had API

14
00:00:35.596 --> 00:00:36.471
keys in there.

15
00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:39.024
So this is one for Firecrawl,

16
00:00:39.024 --> 00:00:44.248
which is like that web scraper
that I told you about earlier.

17
00:00:44.248 --> 00:00:47.820
And now it has access to all
the tools of that web scraper.

18
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.385
So we're gonna use a very,
very practical example.

19
00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:59.315
I'm sure you had those course
notes before on my website.

20
00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:00.720
I'll show you again.

21
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.160
All the notes from our courses are here.

22
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.479
There's also like the previous courses
which as you can tell is way out of date

23
00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.560
for the number of courses that I do.

24
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.240
Could I update this by hand 100%?

25
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.160
I could, I think I'm missing like five
courses at this point and I haven't.

26
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.970
So what we could do is
we can go to Cursor.

27
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.450
Let me just go into my website repo.

28
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.770
Open that up in Cursor.

29
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.383
I like when Electron apps decide they are
only going to open the background of other

30
00:01:36.383 --> 00:01:38.730
apps if your computer's been open for
too long.

31
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.970
That's a thing that they choose.

32
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.060
All of them choose to do at some point or
another anyway.

33
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.500
So we can go into the settings.

34
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.340
As you can see, I actually want the Cursor
settings which don't have a shortcut.

35
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.460
Tools and integrations and
I have a few of these.

36
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.620
But Fire Crawl has a bunch of tools.

37
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.380
Firecrawl Scrape, Map.

38
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.140
I don't even know what they do,
it doesn't really matter.

39
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.103
Let's do, let's see, I wanna make.

40
00:02:07.103 --> 00:02:10.742
Doesn't really matter where I do this
cuz I'm not actually going to keep it

41
00:02:10.742 --> 00:02:11.333
right now.

42
00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:15.466
Cuz I'm definitely not deploying something
to my own website that I live coded with

43
00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:16.890
an MC server in front of you.

44
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.820
I will be reviewing it beforehand.

45
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.340
I'm just going to find a file and
we'll make one

46
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.320
called Could I tell the LLM Make
a file in this place.

47
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.840
I could totally do that, I don't trust it.

48
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.784
Take that for whatever you will.

49
00:02:34.784 --> 00:02:40.116
Then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

50
00:02:40.116 --> 00:02:45.280
go to frontend Masters teachers.

51
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.351
There we go, look at that handsome devil.

52
00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:50.421
Grab that URL.

53
00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:55.479
And I'm gonna say for

54
00:02:55.479 --> 00:03:00.538
all of the courses and

55
00:03:00.538 --> 00:03:07.002
workshops, for each one,

56
00:03:07.002 --> 00:03:11.217
I want the title,

57
00:03:11.217 --> 00:03:17.130
the thumbnail picture.

58
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.177
I'll just say the image and the link.

59
00:03:21.177 --> 00:03:26.837
If I was smarter,
Dustin sent me an affiliate code,

60
00:03:26.837 --> 00:03:32.370
I'd be like and
append my affiliate code to each and

61
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.430
every one of these links and
write it to a JSON file in at.

62
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.930
I just made a new one in routes.

63
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.233
Hopefully, I picked the right one cuz
I used my handwritten one as well.

64
00:03:48.233 --> 00:03:50.701
Write it to a JSON file in Svelte.

65
00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:51.571
Cool, cool,

66
00:03:51.571 --> 00:03:56.287
cool, now my LLM has superpowers because
I put in that Firecrawl MCP server.

67
00:03:56.287 --> 00:04:03.244
So now it knows it has
the tools to scrape a webpage.

68
00:04:03.244 --> 00:04:09.360
You'll notice though,
there is a little bit of hope here.

69
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.656
Probably could have mentioned Firecrawl,
but you can see that it chose

70
00:04:14.656 --> 00:04:19.960
this new tool that it has because
it's the one that Firecrawl created.

71
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.342
And you can see that it is going to
that page, it is scraping that page and

72
00:04:25.342 --> 00:04:28.680
it is starting to put
together my JSON file.

73
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.341
And I could save this
to use on a notepad or

74
00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:36.669
I'll show you a Cursor command later and
I could run that and I could literally get

75
00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:42.260
an updated JSON file of the courses that I
could then use for the Svelte site, right?

76
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.304
Those are the things where it's like,
do you want to say, build a SaaS for

77
00:04:46.304 --> 00:04:47.557
me in a weekend maybe?

78
00:04:47.557 --> 00:04:50.740
Again, people are doing it,
I believe them that are making money.

79
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.096
However, writing a scraper was
a Saturday that I did not want to spend,

80
00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:57.140
clearly because I didn't do it.

81
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.757
And then pulling in some of these tools
takes things that are not necessarily

82
00:05:02.757 --> 00:05:07.990
Writing a scraper is not necessarily
like a big brain activity.

83
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.270
It's tedious.

84
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.830
And if you've never done it before,
totally do it, cause it's fun.

85
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.230
You'll find out all the ways
different websites try to stop you.

86
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.430
Real estate websites.

87
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.830
Yeah, ask me how I know.

88
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.927
But that stuff where you can start
to make progress and move stuff.

89
00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:30.688
Cuz again, there is the stuff we do for
pride as software engineers and

90
00:05:30.688 --> 00:05:34.985
the fact that most of us work at companies
and we need to ship shareholder value.

91
00:05:34.985 --> 00:05:39.161
And being able to pull in one MCP server,
add this functionality and

92
00:05:39.161 --> 00:05:43.040
do something that I've
been putting off forever.

93
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.080
Pretty powerful, right?

94
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.346
That said, like I said before the joke
we said earlier, the S in MCP is for

95
00:05:49.346 --> 00:05:50.560
security.

96
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.440
Thank you everyone in the chat
who donated that gem.

97
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.567
That's not leaving my lexicon for a while.

98
00:05:57.567 --> 00:06:02.109
And this is one, it's using mpx,
so it's pulling it from npm,

99
00:06:02.109 --> 00:06:06.500
which is a supply chain nightmare
waiting to happen, right?

100
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.515
So you could clone it down to at least
have a known go one and audit the code.

101
00:06:10.515 --> 00:06:13.557
You can also there are some
that are remote servers

102
00:06:13.557 --> 00:06:18.337
now you're playing with extra fire,
you know, and there's a lot of trust but

103
00:06:18.337 --> 00:06:21.830
verification where it's like,
there's like go find.

104
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.630
There's like G Drive.

105
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.365
And you know it's not made by Google,
if they call it G Drive, by the way,

106
00:06:28.365 --> 00:06:30.798
there's like five of
them made by just randos.

107
00:06:30.798 --> 00:06:33.670
And I'm sure you have to
put in an access token.

108
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.123
I'm not installing one,
so I couldn't tell you.

109
00:06:35.123 --> 00:06:41.289
But I am sure that you have to give them
an access token to your Google Drive.

110
00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:43.208
Absolutely not, right?

111
00:06:43.208 --> 00:06:49.778
So keeping that in mind, don't be,
wow, he just scraped a page.

112
00:06:49.778 --> 00:06:53.355
And that was so cool as a permission
slip to be irresponsible, but

113
00:06:53.355 --> 00:06:56.152
understand that especially
if you are willing to,

114
00:06:56.152 --> 00:06:59.481
if you write your own to extend something,
I think that's.

115
00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:06.753
Obviously, I can create my
own security bugs, trust me.

116
00:07:06.753 --> 00:07:09.479
Or known vetted ones.

117
00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:12.902
I think the amount of trust you can
give to the official GitHub one is

118
00:07:12.902 --> 00:07:13.891
probably higher.

119
00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:19.800
Now, no company has never not been hacked.

120
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.776
So understand that there
are risks in this.

121
00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:24.039
It is an emerging protocol.

122
00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:27.701
It has its rough edges,
but there is power.

123
00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:31.640
And also know that for everyone you add,
you are effectively paying a tax.
