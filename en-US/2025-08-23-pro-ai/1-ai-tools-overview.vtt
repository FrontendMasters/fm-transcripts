00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.361
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We are going to, like I
said, a few other mini tools will make

2
00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:08.000
appearances, but we're going to talk
about two tools in particular today.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.268
They are the hot ones right now, for

4
00:00:12.268 --> 00:00:19.360
lack of a better term,
which is Cursor and Claude code.

5
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.610
We're going to look at some other ones
because there's a bunch of different

6
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.440
paradigms in which you
see these tools work.

7
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.080
If you're going to ask me
the question right now, which one,

8
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.413
I will tell you that I use both.

9
00:00:32.413 --> 00:00:38.963
Cursor is if it looks like VS Code,
that's a decent thought.

10
00:00:38.963 --> 00:00:43.868
It is effectively a fork of VS Code
insofar that if I think if you pull in

11
00:00:43.868 --> 00:00:48.776
the GitHub extension and you try to
OAuth in to GitHub, it'll be like

12
00:00:48.776 --> 00:00:53.876
would you like to give VS Code
permission to connect to GitHub, right?

13
00:00:53.876 --> 00:00:57.473
So it is effectively
a superset-ish these days.

14
00:00:57.473 --> 00:01:04.072
VS Code has increasingly more and
more of these features built into it.

15
00:01:04.072 --> 00:01:07.639
But we'll use Cursor because I think it
is still the one that most people go to

16
00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:08.150
for this.

17
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.955
A lot of this comes down to UX paradigms.

18
00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:15.562
Cursor, what's really great about it
is you are, again, in your editor.

19
00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:19.922
You've got that side panel that
kinda looks like ChatGPT, right?

20
00:01:19.922 --> 00:01:23.623
In your code, you can kinda see
the changes it wants to make, accept and

21
00:01:23.623 --> 00:01:26.413
you can highlight pieces of code and
ask to do things.

22
00:01:26.413 --> 00:01:29.929
You kind of in there, right,
versus some other AI tools we see.

23
00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.601
Sometimes it's like go off and do a thing
and come back to me, like Deep Research or

24
00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:37.600
OpenAI's Operator or
Codex, as we'll see later.

25
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.882
And so there's a lot of really
great things about having a kind of

26
00:01:41.882 --> 00:01:43.715
an immersive experience.

27
00:01:43.715 --> 00:01:47.930
Claude Code, on the other hand,
is a terminal app.

28
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.126
So all you vim users can rejoice and
it runs in your terminal and

29
00:01:52.126 --> 00:01:55.596
kind of you're kind of again,
you're there, but

30
00:01:55.596 --> 00:02:01.100
you're not necessarily in the code
at the same time as the agent is.

31
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.899
Again, there are advantages to that too,

32
00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.132
because you're not tied to what thing
are you looking at at this moment either.

33
00:02:09.132 --> 00:02:14.181
Now, which one do I use?

34
00:02:14.181 --> 00:02:18.035
Well, Cursor is like
a VS Code kind of thing, and

35
00:02:18.035 --> 00:02:23.220
Claude Code runs the terminal and
VS Code has a terminal built in.

36
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.041
The answer to which one I use
is yes to various degrees,

37
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:30.100
depending on what I want to do.

38
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.617
If it's like, hey, I'm staring at
a function that I need to refactor,

39
00:02:33.617 --> 00:02:35.380
I'm probably doing it in Cursor.

40
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.020
If I've got, hey,
I need to change the arguments of every

41
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.580
iteration of this function
across the entire code base.

42
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.780
I'm probably doing that from cloud code.

43
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.660
There are other paradigms, as we'll see.

44
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.296
This is OpenAI's codex, which takes
a totally different approach to accomplish

45
00:02:54.296 --> 00:02:59.700
the same thing, which is you point it at
a git repo and you tell it what you want.

46
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.691
You can chat with it a little bit, you can
see what it's thinking and then guide it.

47
00:03:03.691 --> 00:03:08.116
And it comes up like, here's my plan and
you can kind of approve it or not.

48
00:03:08.116 --> 00:03:10.540
And if you approve it,
it will open up a PR.

49
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.909
So now you're taking a different approach,
which is more of that traditional

50
00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.093
code reviewer kind of piece where
you're commenting on the pull request.

51
00:03:19.093 --> 00:03:22.614
And again, the answer is yes, right?

52
00:03:22.614 --> 00:03:25.010
I mean, this is incredibly
powerful because if I have.

53
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.204
Because for a lot of these tools, we think
a lot of these in terms of generating

54
00:03:29.204 --> 00:03:31.849
the code because that's
where we see the memes,

55
00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.450
the people smiling with
money bags on YouTube.

56
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.570
But I think writing code is important.

57
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.760
But understanding code bases is
sometimes an interesting part too.

58
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.753
And all these tools a lot of times
understand they've indexed the entire code

59
00:03:44.753 --> 00:03:46.480
base, they can get a sense of it.

60
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.672
And so for a tool like this, a lot of
times I'll have spent the day coding and

61
00:03:51.672 --> 00:03:55.960
then I will walk away from
the computer as I promised my wife and

62
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.103
then I will pull out my phone and

63
00:03:58.103 --> 00:04:02.819
I got some questions about the overall
architecture or some ideas.

64
00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.083
I can kick some of these things off
remotely and then come back and

65
00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:07.964
look at them in the morning, right?

66
00:04:07.964 --> 00:04:11.491
So the answer of which one is
sometimes like it depends,

67
00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:16.660
or yes, depending on how much kind
of firm pieces you want in there.

68
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.780
But quick disclaimer just to
kind of set expectations.

69
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.460
Best things in life are free.

70
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.140
These apparently are not
the best things in life.

71
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.180
So Cursor does have a free 14
day trial of the pro plan.

72
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.170
There's some other plans too, but

73
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.070
everything we care about today
is at least in the pro plan.

74
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.051
After you get moved down to the hobby
plan where you still have most kind

75
00:04:42.051 --> 00:04:46.359
of purposely, we'll touch on
some of the things that are not

76
00:04:46.359 --> 00:04:50.430
totally in the hobby plan,
but you just have less of it.

77
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.083
And then there's some other stuff that is
in the fancy plan, which is the stuff you

78
00:04:55.083 --> 00:04:59.535
would never expect to be in a free plan
and you probably don't care about unless

79
00:04:59.535 --> 00:05:04.054
you work in corporate it, which is SSO and
SAML and enterprise grade privacy and

80
00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:08.639
all those which you should care about but
you don't care about right now with your

81
00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.850
little fun project apps that
we're going to play with.

82
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.094
That said,
our buddy Claude Code on the other hand,

83
00:05:18.094 --> 00:05:21.877
at this moment does not have a free plan.

84
00:05:21.877 --> 00:05:25.597
Now, the way we're gonna handle today
is we're gonna talk about cursor first.

85
00:05:25.597 --> 00:05:29.093
We are then gonna kind of have
a blended portion of the show and

86
00:05:29.093 --> 00:05:30.747
then things that you could.

87
00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.793
If you want to flip over to Claude Code
and get that experience too, you can,

88
00:05:33.793 --> 00:05:35.521
you wanna stay in cursor, you can as well.

89
00:05:35.521 --> 00:05:42.065
That said, if you wanna get a feel for
kind of the terminal-based approach,

90
00:05:42.065 --> 00:05:46.694
Google has a Gemini CLI,
which other than missing a few

91
00:05:46.694 --> 00:05:51.546
features which again might
very much have at some point.

92
00:05:51.546 --> 00:05:56.444
As long as you have a Google account
is free within certain amounts too, and

93
00:05:56.444 --> 00:05:58.251
so that will apply as well.

94
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:00.653
So if you wanna get a taste of that,
that is an option for you.

95
00:06:00.653 --> 00:06:04.596
So there's various ways to
kind of play along with this.
