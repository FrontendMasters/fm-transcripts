00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.826
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Like I said before,
I open up Cursor and

2
00:00:02.826 --> 00:00:07.552
then in the terminal tend to open
up Claude code simultaneously.

3
00:00:07.552 --> 00:00:13.178
And some of the workflow is I'll have
Claude code executing one of the plans

4
00:00:13.178 --> 00:00:18.089
while I'm talking on that sidebar and
coming up with new plans and

5
00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:21.768
writing them down into markdown files,
right?

6
00:00:21.768 --> 00:00:27.165
100%, but cloud code, again,
lives in the terminal.

7
00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:31.637
It's like either I'm in an echo chamber or

8
00:00:31.637 --> 00:00:36.743
whatever one until they
fully nerf the max plan.

9
00:00:36.743 --> 00:00:39.911
The fact that you don't pay per token,

10
00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:45.779
because I will show you why that's
important in a little bit, is great.

11
00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:50.057
And it is wildly powerful,
I get better results from it

12
00:00:50.057 --> 00:00:54.893
right to the point when Ryland
was running up those bills, and

13
00:00:54.893 --> 00:00:58.430
I told him he had to switch,
he was resisted.

14
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.328
And then like two days was like, I'm sold.

15
00:01:00.328 --> 00:01:04.030
So I think there's a time and a place for
both, for the interaction pattern.

16
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.790
I use both simultaneously to install.

17
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.641
You can just do it from npm.

18
00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:12.126
There is also, I haven't used it yet.

19
00:01:12.126 --> 00:01:14.522
You can also just install as a package and

20
00:01:14.522 --> 00:01:17.990
it has an SDK where you can
like programmatically call it.

21
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.123
And like, I think that there's something
there that is cool to do in terms

22
00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:24.067
of orchestrating a bunch of work.

23
00:01:24.067 --> 00:01:25.430
I know that there's there.

24
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.070
I just haven't figured it out yet.

25
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.270
So stay tuned on that one.

26
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.772
Once you have it,
you want to make sure it works.

27
00:01:31.772 --> 00:01:35.180
These are things I can't really truly
simulate because I was not going to break

28
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.777
my Claude installation before
doing a workshop on Claude.

29
00:01:37.777 --> 00:01:42.565
So you get slides, but you can run
Claude doctor which will make sure

30
00:01:42.565 --> 00:01:45.677
everything's set up correctly and use it.

31
00:01:45.677 --> 00:01:48.702
And then in any given directory that's it,

32
00:01:48.702 --> 00:01:52.557
type that you don't even need
the period like a cursor.

33
00:01:52.557 --> 00:01:56.751
I do have, I did like break it
previously and take the screenshots so

34
00:01:56.751 --> 00:02:00.150
you can see what the installation
process looks like.

35
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.002
But then I unbroke it
because I need to use it,

36
00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:09.790
and I was not willing to take that risk.

37
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.830
So it's got some basic settings like
color, which I'm like, whatever.

38
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.998
Just use whatever my terminal uses.

39
00:02:14.998 --> 00:02:18.340
It gives you nice ASCII art,
which Gemini does as well.

40
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.524
I think after the first time, you never
see that again though so whatever.

41
00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:23.620
And then you have two options.

42
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.844
You can either a,
if you've got a max account, $20 for pro,

43
00:02:29.844 --> 00:02:35.703
and then either $100 or $200 a month for
max predictable pricing

44
00:02:35.703 --> 00:02:40.907
with rate limits that they change
on whenever they feel like it.

45
00:02:40.907 --> 00:02:43.095
We'll talk about that in a second.

46
00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:46.302
Or you can put in your API key.

47
00:02:46.302 --> 00:02:50.578
I will give you a cautionary
tale about that in a second.

48
00:02:50.578 --> 00:02:52.063
Two ways that you can pay for it.

49
00:02:52.063 --> 00:02:56.530
May I recommend the one that you
know what the bill is going to be.

50
00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.207
I don't care if you choose the $201,
the $101, or the $21, but

51
00:03:01.207 --> 00:03:04.290
at least what those 200100 like whatever.

52
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.754
Claude can make mistakes.

53
00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:09.650
Only use the code you trust.

54
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.953
That's the extent of the security notes.

55
00:03:13.953 --> 00:03:20.170
Yes User recommended Settings
option Enter for new lines.

56
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.370
Rylan did a thing.

57
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.433
We have shift enter now, which I
need to figure out what he did, but

58
00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:29.210
I've now gotten used to option enter,
so I don't really care.

59
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.490
A few things.

60
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.689
One is literally I took these
screenshots this morning and

61
00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.120
there was a new version
out with new features.

62
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.160
Mostly the one that is important
is the session start hook.

63
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.360
We'll talk about hooks in a second.

64
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.875
Yeah, maybe that sign for
custom agents anyway, but

65
00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:53.320
the sign we'll see later works
exactly like it does ish in cursor.

66
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.560
Works enough that you don't need to
think about how they're different.

67
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.560
And yeah, you have some other slash
commands that we'll see in a second.

68
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.093
And you have this one other mode
that I use once, just so I could.

69
00:04:05.093 --> 00:04:07.349
If you give it -p it'll like, do what?

70
00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.229
Like we said before, like one shot where
it'll like go do a thing without dropping

71
00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:13.010
you into an interactive terminal.

72
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.850
This could be great.

73
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.476
This means in a CICD process you
could say like, hey, if the lint

74
00:04:17.476 --> 00:04:22.330
errors failed in CI cd, you could either
say fix them, which I don't know, I trust.

75
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.300
Or like, hey, write to the GitHub issue
a synopsis of why this is breaking and

76
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.200
what they should do.

77
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.568
Because it'll just run one command,
just like ESLint,

78
00:04:32.568 --> 00:04:35.480
just like vtest, so on and so forth.

79
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.800
Run at one off, great.

80
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.399
So the nice part is there's a lot
to talk about with Cloud Code.

81
00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:46.282
The other side of it is some of it we
already have hooks into because we

82
00:04:46.282 --> 00:04:47.960
talked about it with cursor.

83
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.400
So there is model selection.

84
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.860
Remember we went through okay Anthropics,
got these models, and

85
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.280
Google has these models and GPT,
and I didn't get to all of them.

86
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.980
There's like deep SEQ and a whole
bunch of other ones I just ran out of.

87
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.340
Like, I got tired of making those slides.

88
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.980
Nice part about callgoat
is you've got Three models.

89
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.700
Two really, because one you don't use,
which is Sonnet and Opus.

90
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.888
Sonnet is the daily driver.

91
00:05:16.888 --> 00:05:20.199
Opus is I would like to burn through
my rate limit as quickly as possible,

92
00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.060
which sometimes you would like to burn.

93
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.616
Like which one to use is really tricky
because if Sonnet cost four times

94
00:05:27.616 --> 00:05:33.820
as many tokens, four times as much per
token, but can get it done in 1/8.

95
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.340
I don't know.

96
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.740
Like the math is tricky, right?

97
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.940
Like maybe it's worth it.

98
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.180
Like should you fight all day with Sonnet
versus when you could add Opus to it?

99
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.680
I don't know.

100
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.460
I just like in my.

101
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.700
I spent a decent amount of
time just taking screenshots.

102
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.940
Not all of them made it into the stock.

103
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.020
But I like this one.

104
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.190
I do believe this one a lot.

105
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.550
But you have two choices.

106
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.598
If you are just on the $20 a month plan,
you don't have two choices,

107
00:06:01.598 --> 00:06:02.710
you have one choice.

108
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.710
So it's even easier.

109
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.598
My general thing and the 68,
I'm doing this from memory,

110
00:06:08.598 --> 00:06:13.870
they changed some of the rate limits,
and in the email, they're like, yeah.

111
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.076
Now on top of every five hour rate limits,

112
00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:18.609
you also have weekly rate
limits on top of that.

113
00:06:18.609 --> 00:06:23.646
And there was something like
that's 240 to 480 sonnet

114
00:06:23.646 --> 00:06:28.690
requests per 5-hour window or
40 to 60 opus requests.

115
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.712
That math doesn't fully
align up completely, but

116
00:06:32.712 --> 00:06:34.930
it gives you a hint of
the order of magnitude.

117
00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:39.570
I'll show you how to switch back and forth
on the command line, stuff like that.

118
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:45.097
What I tend to do is jockey back and
forth between them.

119
00:06:45.097 --> 00:06:48.610
Am I writing a plan and coming up with
a bunch of research, so on and so forth?

120
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.707
I will use Opus.

121
00:06:49.707 --> 00:06:54.174
And is that then if I have a good enough
plan in place that steps out exactly what

122
00:06:54.174 --> 00:06:59.680
I need done, where the files are, what
the architecture is, so on and so forth.

123
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.520
Let's use the cheaper one, right?

124
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.400
Like I put in the guardrails,
I held this hand like a small child.

125
00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:07.440
If that fails, so on and so forth.

126
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.175
And then it creates this
weird incentive structure

127
00:07:15.175 --> 00:07:20.929
which is it's just your
anthropic Claude rate limits.

128
00:07:20.929 --> 00:07:26.123
Which, if somebody's asking what
the real reason why I'm like,

129
00:07:26.123 --> 00:07:30.855
I have Anthropic write the code
while I'm brainstorming and

130
00:07:30.855 --> 00:07:33.192
talking with O3 and Gemini.

131
00:07:33.192 --> 00:07:36.550
Because I'm protecting my
precious rate limits, right?

132
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.209
And so it's like I only got so

133
00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:44.010
many tokens that I can use in
a five hour window with these.

134
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:48.762
So I'm going to go talk to ChatGPT not
talking to Opus while Opus is writing code

135
00:07:48.762 --> 00:07:49.850
absolutely not.

136
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.992
So that's part of my philosophy on
why I talk to different models too,

137
00:07:54.992 --> 00:07:57.290
which is like protecting my rate limits.

138
00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:04.650
So yeah, keep that in mind as well, and
we'll see some strategies around this one.

139
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.770
At a given point, you can do model,
you'll get a menu.

140
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:12.011
The third option is Haiku which even
they're like maybe editing comments and

141
00:08:12.011 --> 00:08:15.666
docs or something like you know like
Sonnet is your daily driver for

142
00:08:15.666 --> 00:08:16.940
most things.

143
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.020
Opus for the big brain activities.

144
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.660
There's also Haiku you can do model and
change it.

145
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.980
You can also at any given point
switch between the two of them.

146
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.500
So like I will usually use all three.

147
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.550
You can also start it up in a given
mode with a command line flag right?

148
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:40.044
So this if you want to put in a given
mode before you do something,

149
00:08:40.044 --> 00:08:41.030
I do this as well.
