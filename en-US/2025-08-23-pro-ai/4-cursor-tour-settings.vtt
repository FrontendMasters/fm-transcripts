00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.614
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Like, my encouragement is
if you have some code to play with that

2
00:00:04.614 --> 00:00:07.368
exists, like I think like seeing it in,

3
00:00:07.368 --> 00:00:12.720
like having using Cursor in a code base
that you can index and do stuff with.

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.000
Useful if you don't.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.732
We have this course webpage
which is all of my various notes

6
00:00:18.732 --> 00:00:21.909
that if I'm going to write them,
might as well put them somewhere,

7
00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:25.030
as well as some stuff that I have
no intention that we'll ever get to

8
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.180
down at the bottom here and
some of the links.

9
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.809
So you're like, he showed me
a screenshot of a thing, cool.

10
00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:36.471
But also here is a little template
library which is vite, TypeScript,

11
00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:41.366
some Es, like all of the, like baseline
stuff that like, some git hooks,

12
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:44.729
stuff that we might need or
want at various points.

13
00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:48.977
So if you're like, I don't got anything,
you can go, I'm gonna jump in here and

14
00:00:48.977 --> 00:00:51.260
like kind of go tabla rasa a little bit.

15
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.920
So you can do the traditional way,
which is kind of go find cursor,

16
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.890
hit like open a project or
clone a repo, so on and so forth.

17
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.689
You can see my embarrassing
project names or

18
00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.282
as I usually use it from the command line,

19
00:01:11.282 --> 00:01:17.010
navigate into a folder cursor,
same way as you do in VS code.

20
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.012
And as I think I joked before to you
earlier, if it looks a lot like VS code,

21
00:01:22.012 --> 00:01:26.857
that's cuz it's a fork of VS code
with the one questionable decision of

22
00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:31.650
putting those sidebar icons along the top,
which I do not agree with.

23
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.730
And they only did that like
a month ago and I don't like it.

24
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.050
All right, so let's take a tour
of our friendly little tool here.

25
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.930
So again,
some of it needs no introduction.

26
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.823
If you would like to hear me ramble
about VS code for hours on end,

27
00:01:49.823 --> 00:01:51.010
that is available to you.

28
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.220
But let's talk about the things
that make Cursor cursor.

29
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.302
Most notably is we've got this sidebar and
I'm aware there is a version

30
00:02:01.302 --> 00:02:06.100
that looks shockingly similar in VS
code these days for Copilot, but

31
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.220
this is the one in Cursor where
we've got a few things going on.

32
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.688
Let's start with the main
chat window which

33
00:02:16.688 --> 00:02:23.940
does what we think what is
the tech stack of this code base?

34
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.686
All right, so figured out the question,
you gonna analyze this,

35
00:02:29.686 --> 00:02:31.460
you can kinda see what it's doing.

36
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.940
Now I'm going to argue to you
that this might look boring.

37
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.260
And for reading,
you could probably walk away and

38
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.970
get a cup of coffee when you're writing,
you probably want to watch this, right?

39
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.410
Because yelling at it to stop might
be a thing that you want to do.

40
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.530
Because yeah,
obviously if you have good discipline and

41
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.450
there is this idea of checkpoints
in cursor, you can roll stuff back.

42
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.199
But again, I will remind you,

43
00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:01.237
you are either playing with the rate
limits on whatever plan you are on or

44
00:03:01.237 --> 00:03:05.530
I'll show you, you can put in your
own API keys and pay by token, right.

45
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.258
And when it is your money or you're
worried about getting cut off for the day,

46
00:03:10.258 --> 00:03:12.584
the week, the month or even the year,

47
00:03:12.584 --> 00:03:17.130
like you care a lot more about the rabbit
holes it goes down to goes down.

48
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.490
So I would argue that like taking
a look at this probably makes sense.

49
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.699
So you can kind of get a sense where
it's gone through the code base and

50
00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:35.448
like, okay, this is a relatively simple
app, but like you can see that it's

51
00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:41.310
got a general shape of the things involved
and knows roughly what's going on.

52
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:43.470
Cool.

53
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.668
And you get a sense of how
much of the context window for

54
00:03:46.668 --> 00:03:49.310
the given model you
are using at this point.

55
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.993
So there's a way to get a sense
because if it runs out of context and

56
00:03:53.993 --> 00:03:57.315
we'll see different ways for
handling that,

57
00:03:57.315 --> 00:04:01.575
it's going to start dropping packets and
losing context,

58
00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:07.310
which increases the likelihood that that
it's going to start making stuff up.

59
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.430
So you have this idea of add context,
which you can click and I will.

60
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.883
Because we're all here together where
you can kind of pull in any docs you've

61
00:04:15.883 --> 00:04:16.510
given it.

62
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.830
This case, it doesn't necessarily
have one, but you can add a new one.

63
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:19.950
We'll take a look at that.

64
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.344
I predominantly use it almost all the time
for files and folders, which is like,

65
00:04:28.344 --> 00:04:33.180
hey, these are the related files for
this thing that we're doing.

66
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.152
I need you to go look at this one file
that's fetching the data from the server

67
00:04:38.152 --> 00:04:42.890
and this other file where we have
the component that's displaying it and

68
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.500
the CSS file and
we need to do such and such.

69
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.540
I almost never click this button.

70
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.100
You're welcome to.

71
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.086
It's also nice,

72
00:04:51.086 --> 00:04:54.980
especially when you're first learning
to go see any of these things.

73
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.560
This is also a relatively empty project,
I'll pull up another one in a second.

74
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.544
You can get a sense of all those things,
but then the other way to do it is just to

75
00:05:04.544 --> 00:05:10.222
hit the symbol and you do something like,
I don't know, just easily App application,

76
00:05:10.222 --> 00:05:14.440
which is not the file that I'm in
presently, but now it will go and

77
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.400
it will read application TSX and
have the contents of that file in place.

78
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.480
And what's nice about that is
not just reading that file.

79
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.720
Let's say that file import stuff.

80
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.370
It can follow the breadcrumbs.

81
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.690
You don't necessarily have
to be exhaustive about this.

82
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.866
You just want to get the general shape
of the files that you think might be

83
00:05:34.866 --> 00:05:36.290
relevant.

84
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.345
More importantly, we've got this
model toggle where you have auto,

85
00:05:41.345 --> 00:05:44.610
where it's like cursor, you figure it out.

86
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.323
Most of the time this probably changes,
but

87
00:05:50.323 --> 00:05:55.820
I think most of the time it's
either like 4.0 or Sonnet 3.5 or

88
00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.280
you can turn that off and
you can pick which model.

89
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.440
If your list looks different than my list,

90
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.640
I will show you how to change
this list in one second.

91
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.280
Probably, yeah,
you just go down there and change it.

92
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.840
But that's fine, don't worry about it.

93
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.840
You don't have a different
cursor than I do.

94
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.440
I mean, I pay for it, so
I do have a different cursor than you.

95
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.720
Then you also have max mode,

96
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.370
which is I will spend money
to make this problem go away.

97
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.490
And trust me, you will spend money.

98
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.410
These are the kind of different
modes that you can put it in.

99
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.434
This one you will not
have on the hobby plan or

100
00:06:31.434 --> 00:06:33.250
maybe if you don't have a credit card.

101
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.450
But we'll talk about that in a second.

102
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.744
The two that we really
care about are agent,

103
00:06:37.744 --> 00:06:40.771
which is go build a thing or
change code or

104
00:06:40.771 --> 00:06:46.820
ask which is the safer one of like can
we just talk about the code base, right?

105
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.780
And you're like, no, I'm here to make it.

106
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.438
Write code for me one thing and

107
00:06:50.438 --> 00:06:53.700
we'll talk about ways you can
run parallel agents again.

108
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.500
I thought it was really cool when
I first saw that you could do it.

109
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.180
I now don't do it because I
have to review all that stuff.

110
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.251
And I'm always like, you know how in
JavaScript there's one main thread,

111
00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:08.005
you are the main thread, right,
you can spin off other web workers and

112
00:07:08.005 --> 00:07:11.140
stuff like that, but
ultimately you are the main thread.

113
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.884
And I tend to not paralyze too
much work anymore because I still

114
00:07:14.884 --> 00:07:19.460
like when I wasn't reviewing anything
that felt cost free and great.

115
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.160
And then I learned my lesson and
now I review everything and

116
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.700
I don't do that anymore.

117
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.898
But ask mode is really cool because a lot
of times while if you're working on just

118
00:07:27.898 --> 00:07:32.094
one branch, while if Claude code or a
cursor agent is going and changing stuff,

119
00:07:32.094 --> 00:07:35.979
having two things change the file system
at the same time it's gonna be bad

120
00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:39.500
cuz it's like this file has
changed the last time I read it.

121
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.420
They'll get into a loop.

122
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.660
Things will end poorly.

123
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.687
But what I will do a lot of times is
either a switch it into ask mode on

124
00:07:45.687 --> 00:07:48.618
a separate one and
just start brainstorming and

125
00:07:48.618 --> 00:07:50.460
talking about the code base.

126
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.460
I'm like, which components don't
have good enough accessibility?

127
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.900
Which components don't have test coverage?

128
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.380
Where am I not where do
I have a memory leak?

129
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.340
Because I'm building a Chrome
extension right now.

130
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.620
I've got memory disks all over the place,
constantly.

131
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:13.820
I can go ahead and ask these questions
while I have an agent doing something.

132
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:14.980
Or if I am in agent mode,

133
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.100
it's like I've got something working
on some code while I'm watching it.

134
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.740
And then I'm like, let's write
a plan down to a markdown file.

135
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.340
It's the only thing
the other agent is doing.

136
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:31.569
But I'll show you how you can get four of
these running at once at your own peril,

137
00:08:31.569 --> 00:08:34.790
and I do it still, I did it this week.

138
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.798
You've got that here.

139
00:08:37.798 --> 00:08:40.152
Background agents, we'll talk about
chat history, so on and so forth.

140
00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:42.963
Let's go into these settings.

141
00:08:42.963 --> 00:08:47.749
You can go either going into this
more models will get us there.

142
00:08:47.749 --> 00:08:49.430
Or cursor settings.

143
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.310
Cursor settings.

144
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.990
You can see VS code settings.

145
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.110
Those are what you think they
are because it's VS code.

146
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.750
Really cool.

147
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.230
And so here's some important things to
configure that are cursor specific.

148
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:06.372
I'm not going to go into the VS code
stuff because that's been covered by me

149
00:09:06.372 --> 00:09:07.970
previously.

150
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.930
You can import all your
settings from VS code.

151
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.890
If you are opening cursor for
the first time, it prompted you to do so.

152
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.010
Would you like to port in everything
from VS code and leave pass behind?

153
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.250
Sure, go for it, so on and so forth.

154
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:25.319
The interesting one here is in chat where
you can tweak a few things based on your

155
00:09:25.319 --> 00:09:26.370
preferences.

156
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.370
We've got what mode do
we want to start out in?

157
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.100
Up to you.

158
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.180
I'm usually writing plans.

159
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.460
I'm still asking questions.

160
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:41.260
And let's write this down to
a markdown file, so on and so forth.

161
00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.179
Should it auto clear the chat
after periods of activity?

162
00:09:45.179 --> 00:09:46.540
Because you will not.

163
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.460
Maybe you're a better person than me.

164
00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.258
I don't have the discipline to remember to
clear it out when I have a grand idea that

165
00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.500
I want to talk about.

166
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.940
So letting it clear out is good.

167
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.893
This idea, like we talked about
before both Cloud Code and

168
00:09:59.893 --> 00:10:02.550
Cursor have this ability to
come up with to do lists and

169
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.760
show you the to do list of what
it's going to do before it does it.

170
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.880
And I keep track of a multi step thing.

171
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.000
That's a great feature.

172
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.520
I don't know why you would turn it off,
but if you wanted to, you could.

173
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.946
And queue messages is that you can keep
stacking up more things that you wanted to

174
00:10:18.946 --> 00:10:19.880
do afterwards.

175
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.156
You know,
it's good in the ways you think it's good,

176
00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:25.900
it's bad in the ways you think it's bad,
which is like.

177
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:30.828
Then you gotta clear that queue if you
wanna interject something in the middle.

178
00:10:30.828 --> 00:10:34.924
Yeah, so the interesting ones that we
care about, this one, I toggle on and

179
00:10:34.924 --> 00:10:39.940
off depending on whether I need it, which
is you can reference a full folder, right?

180
00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.017
Which is if it is like I
need to do everything,

181
00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:44.900
I need you to have all of the files
in this folder's context.

182
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.660
You want that on.

183
00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.660
But again, the name of the game
is context management.

184
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.330
Up to you.
This one's good.

185
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.256
Unless you want to turn it off for
a specific reason, but leave it on,

186
00:10:56.256 --> 00:11:00.410
which is dot file protection,
don't touch any of my dot files.

187
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.370
You're like, hey, yeah,
Gitignore, that seems important.

188
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.250
Don't touch that.

189
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:05.273
Or hey, cursor,

190
00:11:05.273 --> 00:11:09.520
don't change your own rules cuz that
goes into a dot file as well, right?

191
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.770
So that one stays on most of the time.

192
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.480
Even if you thought you needed it for
a given reason, you leave it on.

193
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.400
You know, don't leave the folder.

194
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.000
We'll see.

195
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.982
For all these tools,
like especially Monorebo situations,

196
00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:25.720
there is a time these switches exist for
a reason.

197
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.468
That doesn't mean you
should turn them off,

198
00:11:27.468 --> 00:11:29.360
it just means that they're
there if you need it.

199
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.520
The other one that we care about
here though is the models.

200
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.320
You can just kind of choose
what's in that list.

201
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.029
Again, you will be billed at API
pricing for the fancy ones, which for

202
00:11:39.029 --> 00:11:42.850
stuff like Opus and
O3 just got a big discount, right, but

203
00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:45.230
it used to be O3 was very expensive.

204
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:51.670
You can also, if you do not want
to pay Cursor or you can't or

205
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:56.270
you have some reason where you
have a key from your company,

206
00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:01.390
you can actually put in your API keys for
any of these services.

207
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.840
And instead of going through Cursor,
because effectively when you use Cursor,

208
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.137
any of these models, you're going to
Cursor, Cursor is hitting the model,

209
00:12:08.137 --> 00:12:09.830
Cursor is paying OpenAI or Anthropic.

210
00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:14.967
You are paying cursor, you can cut
out the middleman if you need to.

211
00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:19.591
Obviously don't like it when you do
that cuz I'm sure they're taking a cut.

212
00:12:19.591 --> 00:12:22.010
I know they're taking a cut,
but you can put in these,

213
00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.910
especially if it's something like both.

214
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.462
I think AWS bedrock and

215
00:12:25.462 --> 00:12:30.210
other stuff are kinda ways to have
corporately managed ones as well.
