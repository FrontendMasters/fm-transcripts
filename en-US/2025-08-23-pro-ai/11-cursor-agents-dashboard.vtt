00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.565
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
let's go take a look at it real quick and

2
00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:06.320
kind of see what that looks like,
how do you get to it?

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.057
You got a few options
which slightly in here,

4
00:00:11.057 --> 00:00:14.922
that's the one that's running, so

5
00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:20.920
I can also make a background
agent here where you can see.

6
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.379
You select the branch and
you can say okay,

7
00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:27.840
on main I will probably go to a code base
that has something a little bit more.

8
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.804
I'll show you in the UI
in a second as well, but

9
00:00:30.804 --> 00:00:35.070
you can effectively set one of
these to go, so let's actually go.

10
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.735
Is it the fastest way?

11
00:00:38.735 --> 00:00:41.246
I don't know, my good Lord,

12
00:00:41.246 --> 00:00:46.270
I have opened too many windows in
my tiny screen Manage account.

13
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.520
That's what I want, and
we'll pull that tab up, and

14
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.250
I will show you that second
dashboard in a second.

15
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.210
But you have these background agents and
you can kind of set them up,

16
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.570
you say default model, do auto.

17
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.916
As you can see,
all the thinking models in O3,

18
00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:12.154
the fancy models are your choices,
so on and so

19
00:01:12.154 --> 00:01:17.170
forth for setting that up,
and go to agents over here.

20
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.844
If you ever want to use OpenAI Codex,

21
00:01:20.844 --> 00:01:25.690
I will show it to you in another window
in a second, you'll have to squint hard.

22
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.120
I think the only difference is
Cursor's UI is always dark and

23
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.211
Codex's is only dark in
the evening on my computer, so

24
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:36.290
they will look wildly different
because of dark mode and light mode.

25
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.994
But it's the same basic idea where
you've got effectively this prompt,

26
00:01:41.994 --> 00:01:47.238
and I'm going to select Repo,
it's every frontend master's repo

27
00:01:47.238 --> 00:01:53.190
I have ever worked on in my life,
like thousands of to-do lists.

28
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.998
So let's actually grab this one, and

29
00:01:57.998 --> 00:02:04.009
I can pick a branch,
we'll just choose main and

30
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.818
let's say like audit all of the Svelte

31
00:02:08.818 --> 00:02:14.790
components for any accessibility issues.

32
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.702
And this is going to run in the background
and again, like for some of these,

33
00:02:18.702 --> 00:02:22.004
like I would not have it built a new
feature without having lots of

34
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:24.350
documents of reference
being very hands on.

35
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.624
But get an audit or with some of these
you can just ask questions about it or

36
00:02:28.624 --> 00:02:33.249
something like that, where I'm gonna
look at the PR and approve or reject it,

37
00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:34.670
I feel good about that.

38
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.117
So at that point you can kick it off,
to be clear,

39
00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:43.775
it's kind of like a talk show where
they throw a turkey in the oven,

40
00:02:43.775 --> 00:02:48.620
I don't know how long it's going to take,
it's somewhat unclear.

41
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.699
Like we'll let it go while we
talk about other things and

42
00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:53.500
then we'll check on it to see if the
turkey's ready to come out of the oven.

43
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.943
So you can kick one of these off again, it
runs in the background, I can have it open

44
00:02:57.943 --> 00:03:00.740
a pull request, I'm going to stop talking,
talk about something else.

45
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.002
We'll go check on it a little bit because
otherwise it's just going to be a spinning

46
00:03:04.002 --> 00:03:06.700
thing for an indeterminate amount of time.

47
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.205
Let's talk about the other
part of the dashboard,

48
00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:10.900
most importantly the cost piece.

49
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.223
As you can see,
you can have a subscription, but

50
00:03:14.223 --> 00:03:20.320
there are still stuff like fast prompts or
elevated prompts using different models.

51
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.237
Most of the time,
anytime you deviate from auto,

52
00:03:23.237 --> 00:03:26.720
you are playing a game of you
will probably pay per request.

53
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.465
You can set budgets for
how much you're willing to spend and

54
00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:37.285
you can get a sense of what that is,
I think if I'm not mistaken,

55
00:03:37.285 --> 00:03:43.020
I don't know what I was doing on July 1st,
but July 1st was a big day for me.

56
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.780
In Cursor, no idea, I don't remember
what happened the other day.

57
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.270
I could look at my calendar and
see what I was up to that day, but

58
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.180
July 1st was a big day and make
the rest kind of like rounding errors.

59
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.783
But you can kind of get a sense of
lines of agent edits, and again,

60
00:03:58.783 --> 00:04:03.491
the more important part is like
setting that budget if you need to.

61
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:07.844
There is,
I'm trying to remember where it is usage,

62
00:04:07.844 --> 00:04:13.262
where you can see then like roughly
like what model calls you made,

63
00:04:13.262 --> 00:04:17.050
how many tokens were used,
what it cost you.

64
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:23.050
If you blow past, I think like $25,
it'll like mid-July charge or

65
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.650
whatever, and so like that's where
the budget stuff gets handy.

66
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.007
I will warn you, they are welcome to
capitalism, they make it very easy for

67
00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:38.088
you to approve upping that budget,
and it is the danger,

68
00:04:38.088 --> 00:04:43.500
everyone's like, I'm vibe coding and
I get into a flow state.

69
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.676
I got real spendy in those flow states,
we're doing great things and

70
00:04:47.676 --> 00:04:52.664
then when I get reset hard a day or
two later, it's a humbling experience.

71
00:04:52.664 --> 00:04:57.309
Look at this, it's done,
it's almost like I planned it and

72
00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:01.500
I think what's interesting is
I can zoom in a little bit

73
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.220
here is it kind of does give
you the prompt and the summary.

74
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.169
I got a 7 out of 10,
which is I'm not entirely sure I left

75
00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.724
the state of the code before I flew
out here and I think I just pushed

76
00:05:16.724 --> 00:05:21.980
up because it's not live code,
and so it'll give me a sense.

77
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.422
I was definitely working on that
on Monday, of what those are and

78
00:05:25.422 --> 00:05:29.651
the steps that it took and this is very
similar to the chat that you saw earlier.

79
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:32.954
Where you can see all the stuff
that was in there as well, and

80
00:05:32.954 --> 00:05:36.620
kind of the steps that it took and
kind of get a look at all of that.

81
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.750
This is the OpenAI version, which,
if my browser was in dark mode,

82
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.540
would look suspiciously
like the other version.

83
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.380
Here you can pick which repo, here you
can pick which branch you wanted to do.

84
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.076
Actually, this is what we talked about
before without the git work trees,

85
00:05:55.076 --> 00:05:58.950
because making multiple other directories
and deleting them on my computer,

86
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.140
I see the power in that.

87
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.311
And I was compelled to do it because I was
like, I have other thoughts of things that

88
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:07.513
I want to do and so then I would
make all these extra work trees and

89
00:06:07.513 --> 00:06:09.931
the ergonomics of that didn't feel great,
and

90
00:06:09.931 --> 00:06:13.320
there's a tool that made it
somewhat better, but not really.

91
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.297
But you can do the same idea here with
Codex, where you can say, one, two,

92
00:06:18.297 --> 00:06:21.800
three or four versions and take a look.

93
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.714
Then you can see in the archive,
you can go into

94
00:06:26.714 --> 00:06:31.890
one of these, and
it'll show you effectively.

95
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:37.363
And again, there's two modes to this one,
which is either request

96
00:06:37.363 --> 00:06:43.570
changes in the very beginning,
you set between agent, or ask in Cursor.

97
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.974
Hey, I have questions, or
I would like you to do a thing,

98
00:06:45.974 --> 00:06:49.080
if you start out with questions,
you can always switch into, all right,

99
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.210
I've asked enough questions,
I'm ready for you to do a thing.

100
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.012
But this one, I've done a thing,
and this is a merged PR, but

101
00:06:56.012 --> 00:07:00.860
you can see it will go through, it will
kind of like propose a bunch of changes.

102
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.145
And then in my case, there is a button
here to open up a PR that goes to

103
00:07:05.145 --> 00:07:08.020
the regular git process as well.

104
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.440
Let's go ahead, let's do the same thing
in here, because then hopefully I'll

105
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.340
show you something else, which is
audit all of the Svelte components.

106
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.226
This is like, again, we see the things
on YouTube, let me type this,

107
00:07:25.226 --> 00:07:28.490
and then I'll talk that
way that at least goes.

108
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.315
So in this case,
we've got ask, we've got code,

109
00:07:31.315 --> 00:07:35.930
I'm gonna say code because we can roughly
guess what Ask does, and it will show up.

110
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.337
And this is the thing that
I tease the people who

111
00:07:40.337 --> 00:07:45.427
are talking about,
they started a SaaS in a weekend.

112
00:07:45.427 --> 00:07:52.007
And good, I'm sure they did, but
I think, hey, audit my components for

113
00:07:52.007 --> 00:07:57.650
accessibility and tell me about it,
is incredibly powerful.
