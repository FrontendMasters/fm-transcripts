00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.980
Now what I'd like you to do, is I'd
like you to open up your application and

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.270
run the profiling tool, and
see the memory allocations.

3
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.700
See the memories not being cleared,
run a timeline on your application,

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.950
and see if you can find your way
down into that ad render function.

5
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.420
And if you can, see if you can
spot where the memory leak is,

6
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.240
inside of that advertisement
render function.
