00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.560
So, what I wanna talk about today
is I wanna talk about how to squash

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.880
JavaScript bugs.

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.990
Because JavaScript can be hard,

4
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.780
it can be quite painful to
work with a lot of the time.

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.850
There's so
many different things that can go wrong.

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.290
Your code itself layered on top of
the asynchronous nature of JavaScript

7
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.050
being pushed across networks we don't
control and don't understand into

8
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.040
browsers that might operate differently
than the ones that we develop our site on.

9
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.560
But I don't want it to be painful.

10
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.540
I want JavaScript, it starts out so
wonderful and hypnotic and

11
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.990
then as you're going it
just seems to get worse and

12
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.620
worse and you end up with this
disaster of an application.

13
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.350
Instead, it needs to be wonderful.

14
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.160
It needs to have a great user experience.

15
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.640
So many of the web applications that we
all interact with on a day-to-day basis

16
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.120
are buggy and frustrating.

17
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.170
And I don't want our
applications to be that way.

18
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.999
So here's what we're
gonna talk about today.

19
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.625
First, we're gonna start
out with a little game,

20
00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:08.694
where we're gonna talk about JavaScript,
and how weird and bizarre it can be.

21
00:01:08.694 --> 00:01:15.170
And then we're gonna talk conceptually for
a minute about how to fix bugs.

22
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.346
What is the process that we need to
go through in order to find, fix and

23
00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:21.226
prevent bugs from happening?

24
00:01:21.226 --> 00:01:25.010
And then we're gonna get
into the real meat of this.

25
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.680
And we're gonna talk about an application,
we're going to debug it together.

26
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.580
I have a bunch of different
classifications of bugs

27
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.830
that we're gonna
collaboratively go through.

28
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.730
We're gonna do that again after lunch.

29
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.700
We'll close out the day with some ideas
on how to design our applications

30
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.070
with debuggability in mind, so
that when bugs inevitable happen, so

31
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.020
that we can pull them back
out of our code easily.
