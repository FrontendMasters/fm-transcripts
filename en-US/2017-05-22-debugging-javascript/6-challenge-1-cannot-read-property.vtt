00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.670
So now I'm gonna turn it over.

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.620
There's a second part of this book.

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.410
Actually fixing that book.

4
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.340
So we're gonna take ten minutes and
do an exercise.

5
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.860
This is exercise number 1
in the exercises folder.

6
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.260
If you haven't already,
it'll show you how to make the changes

7
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.430
to add workspaces and
add the prevent default.

8
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:29.200
And then figure out why are we getting
cannot find whatever the error was.

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.280
Cannot read property destroy of undefined.

10
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.400
Let's take ten minutes,
see if you can figure it out.

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.900
After that, we'll come back together and
we'll solve it together.
