1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.960
I'm going to introduce our application
that we're gonna use today.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.705
How many of you use Twitter?

3
00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:08.090
I use Twitter a lot, probably too much,

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.082
the worst part about
Twitter is probably this.

5
00:00:15.987 --> 00:00:21.460
It's when you see some some
engagement happening on your feed and

6
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.859
they're obviously wrong.

7
00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.367
They're just so wrong that you
need to take time out of your day,

8
00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:30.037
time out of your sleep,

9
00:00:30.037 --> 00:00:35.230
time away from work to instruct them
on how wrong they are about the world.

10
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.087
I think this is a big mess for Twitter and
so I have this application that I think

11
00:00:41.087 --> 00:00:45.857
I'm willing to totally disrupt the Twitter
market and it's called getRANTr.

12
00:00:45.857 --> 00:00:48.200
You wanna see getRANTr?

13
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.155
I think everybody signed their non
disclosure agreements as everybody was

14
00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:56.410
coming in, so we should be good to go.

15
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.324
So getRANTr, Is a lot like Twitter,

16
00:01:02.324 --> 00:01:05.639
it's got your profile,
you can upload a picture.

17
00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:09.506
Here's a picture of me back when
the hair was still on top of my head and

18
00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:13.392
on the bottom of my head and
I've been ranting since May of 2015.

19
00:01:13.392 --> 00:01:17.784
So I have that information,
I can say new things,

20
00:01:17.784 --> 00:01:24.278
I can rant about anything I want to say,
Frontend Masters is in the house.

21
00:01:24.278 --> 00:01:25.968
I don't know what that means,

22
00:01:25.968 --> 00:01:29.816
I have a timeline of all the different
things that I've ranted about.

23
00:01:32.831 --> 00:01:36.227
This is one of my favorites the years
2017, Donald Trump is President

24
00:01:36.227 --> 00:01:38.858
the primary resistance leaders
are Teague Teen Vogue and

25
00:01:38.858 --> 00:01:42.164
Merriam Webster online dictionary,
it's one of my favorite tweets.

26
00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:45.750
And I even have an awesome monetization
model in place where I have

27
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.249
all of this awesome JavaScript tracking
code following me around the Internet and

28
00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:53.180
it knows exactly the kind
of ads that I want.

29
00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.573
Things David Hasselhoff and bacon, and
Crocodile Dundee and bears as right on.

30
00:02:00.573 --> 00:02:04.905
But getRANTr leaves out
that most irritating

31
00:02:04.905 --> 00:02:08.440
part about Twitter, other people.

32
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.320
Because we getRANTr it's all about you,
only you can write on your timeline.

33
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.160
Only you can see your timeline and

34
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.620
no two getRANTr users can ever
interact with each other.

35
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.063
It's brilliant,

36
00:02:23.063 --> 00:02:28.936
it totally destroys all of the problems
of online social media with Twitter.

37
00:02:28.936 --> 00:02:32.240
So clearly,
clearly this is gonna be awesome.

38
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.840
After the day, there's anybody who know
moonlights as a venture capitalist.

39
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.642
I'll have some term sheets ready,
we can get this thing started.

40
00:02:39.642 --> 00:02:44.390
But getRANTr written
with a lot of JavaScript,

41
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.370
so it's got some bugs, so
we're gonna fix those bugs here together.

42
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.710
Now, getRANTr uses Track:js which
is this other tool that I work on.

43
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.095
And as part of that,
I've helped fix over 37 billion bugs.

44
00:02:58.095 --> 00:03:03.000
And we're on a whole bunch of awesome
sites including Frontend Masters.

45
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.609
Lonely Planet, Atlassian, Xamarin,
AdRoll, 3M, Thomson Reuters, dozens and

46
00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.220
dozens and dozens of others.

47
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.700
And so we're gonna use a little
bit of this to help us understand

48
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.020
where our bugs coming from.

49
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.675
And so now is the time, if you haven't
already to get everything set up.

50
00:03:20.675 --> 00:03:24.810
GetRANTr is available as
a semi open source model.

51
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.959
You can pull it down off of GitHub
slash Todd H gardener slash getRANTR.

52
00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.810
So online real dependency is node, so

53
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.633
you should be able to pull it down
npm install and get it started.

54
00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.305
There should be instructions out there.

55
00:03:38.305 --> 00:03:43.044
Why don't we take just a quick 10 minute
break, make sure everybody has it going,

56
00:03:43.044 --> 00:03:45.800
and then we'll move on
with our first exercise.
