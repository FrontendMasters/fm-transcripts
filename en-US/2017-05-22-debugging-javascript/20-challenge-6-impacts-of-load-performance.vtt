00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.651
So here's where I wanna
turn it over to you.

2
00:00:01.651 --> 00:00:06.743
Set up your network throttle
to be good 3G or worse,

3
00:00:06.743 --> 00:00:11.040
something real that real people would use.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.569
Go to your timeline and turn off
memory and turn screenshots on, and

5
00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:17.085
just reload the page.

6
00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:22.299
And what I want you to do is I want you
to look through this load timeline and

7
00:00:22.299 --> 00:00:27.361
try and understand what are the biggest
impacts of load performance.

8
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:30.559
You don't need to know how to fix them,
find out what they are.

9
00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:35.150
Look through this and say, what are the
things that are slowing my page down?
