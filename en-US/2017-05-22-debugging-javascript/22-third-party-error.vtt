00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.600
Let's go right on into our next book.

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.140
So this one came in from monitoring.

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.840
We see this new air coming in,
form.submit is not a function.

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.990
Particularly, we're getting
this on our signup page,

5
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.950
which is scary because
that's how we get new users.

6
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.750
And if our signup page isn't working,
we're not gonna get new users.

7
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.040
This has happened about 300 times,

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.870
happened all of a sudden,
like it just started happening one day.

9
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.801
And we didn't release our code.

10
00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:33.980
Like it, there was no changes
to our stuff the day before.

11
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.900
And so, I don't know why this would
just start happening when we haven't

12
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.220
made any changes to our code.

13
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.219
So let's see if we can
figure some of that out.

14
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.420
If we pop back over into getRANTR,

15
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.660
we need to remember to turn off
our network throttle, all right?

16
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.230
Because we're done with that.

17
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.074
We don't wanna go slow for
no reason at all.

18
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.550
And so this error itself is not on our
main page, it's on our signup page.

19
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.190
So I'm gonna navigate from the root of

20
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.126
getRANTR to getRANTR/signup.html.

21
00:01:16.032 --> 00:01:19.936
And we have a super awesome
little sign up form here,

22
00:01:19.936 --> 00:01:22.973
to get a 30 day free trial of getRANTR.

23
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.794
And if I look at this page and pop over
to my console, I don't see any errors.

24
00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:36.703
If I fill out my form.

25
00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:47.330
And try and start a trial,
it doesn't do anything.

26
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.750
When I click the button, and
I'm getting errors in my console.

27
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.263
Trackjscode.form.submit is not

28
00:01:57.263 --> 00:02:02.080
a function on analytics js line 25.

29
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.040
Now, analytics js is an interesting thing.

30
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.140
Analytics js is coming from a vendor.

31
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.500
It's not my script.

32
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.610
I load it from a third party.

33
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.340
Analytics provides me with
some analytic services.

34
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.780
So I know how well my
application is doing.

35
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.150
But I didn't write this code and
I don't maintain this code.

36
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.760
And I can't change this code.

37
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.500
So even though this is the source of
the error, I can't change this file.
