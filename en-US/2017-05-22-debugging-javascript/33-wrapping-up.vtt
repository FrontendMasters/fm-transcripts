WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.380
So, that's what we did today,
played some games, talks about JavaScript.

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.110
We fixed a bunch of bugs made
fun of Trump a little bit.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.870
And then we talked about how
to make fewer bugs in the web.

4
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.720
That's really all I have.

5
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.040
So, this was squashing JavaScript bugs.

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.060
Hope you can all go back and
remove some bugs from your apps and

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.280
hopefully make the web
a little less buggy tomorrow.
