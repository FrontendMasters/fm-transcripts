00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.160
Here's a bug that our
monitoring actually caught.

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.344
And our monitoring is saying that,
a lot of our requests back to the server,

3
00:00:08.344 --> 00:00:13.530
are coming back with a 400 or
a 400 bad request, as the HTTP code says.

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.982
In fact this happened 200 times,
we've posted to /api/rants/, and

5
00:00:19.982 --> 00:00:21.620
we've gotten this 400.

6
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.310
And our server people,
they're not so happy with that,

7
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.060
they don't want us making these bad calls.

8
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.440
And we don't wanna waste a bunch
of network bandwidth and

9
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.640
transition time,
making calls that aren't gonna succeed.

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.780
So, let's see if we can understand why
these 400 bad requests are happening.

11
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.950
The other thing that we can tell from our
monitoring, is that, we have some context

12
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.710
about the timeline that's happened, based
on the monitoring tools that we're using.

13
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.500
And I know that before this Ajax happens,

14
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.820
there's two important events
that are always happening.

15
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.010
First, the user inputs zero
characters into that text area,

16
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.359
and then they click on a button.

17
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.190
And those two events are always
happening right before that 400.

18
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.555
So let's see if we can recreate that
with our own development environment.

19
00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:16.000
So I'm just gonna give this a reload,
make sure we're in a clean environment.

20
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.080
So I'm going to enter zero
characters into our text area, so

21
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.900
I'm not gonna do anything.

22
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.756
And I'm going to click
on the submit button.

23
00:01:28.694 --> 00:01:34.535
And the Chrome Console, nicely even
reports that to me, it shows me,

24
00:01:34.535 --> 00:01:41.368
hey, there was a post to this URL
www.getrantr.com port 9000/api/rants

25
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.856
I'm gonna leave it to you,
to take the next step after that, and

26
00:01:49.856 --> 00:01:53.430
figure out, why is that happening and
what can we do about it?
