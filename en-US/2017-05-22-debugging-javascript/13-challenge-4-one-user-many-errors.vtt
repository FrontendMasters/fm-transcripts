00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.510
Here we have another bug that
we caught by monitoring.

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.240
And this time we're seeing a single
user is just having a really bad time.

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.810
So we see only one user has
had an error 2100 times.

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.240
And they're having this error
cannot read substr of null,

5
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.420
you could argue that hey,
maybe it's just one user.

6
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.260
Maybe it's just one really annoying user,
maybe it's Phil in Accounting and

7
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.060
you just tired of dealing with him.

8
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.620
But you know, with getRANTR, I want all of
my users to have an excellent experience.

9
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.510
So if you have the ability to
impersonate individual users,

10
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.500
you can look at what is going on with this
particular user and see what's going on.

11
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.240
Fortunately, with getRANTR,
we have that ability, so,

12
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.220
the first step to taking a look at this
is we need to go into our console.

13
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.890
And we're going to stop the service from
running and I wanna switch my user again.

14
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.532
I'm going to switch using node
import 3 to switch to user 3,

15
00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:11.548
which happens to be the user
that was having a hard time.

16
00:01:11.548 --> 00:01:14.792
And we are going to
import user Alt Todd and

17
00:01:14.792 --> 00:01:18.974
then I'm going to restart
my server using npm start.

18
00:01:29.395 --> 00:01:36.378
Reloading the page,
I should see the AltTodd account.

19
00:01:36.378 --> 00:01:42.460
The AltTodd account does not seem to be
very healthy, there's nothing going on.

20
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.930
Maybe they've just never ranted,
maybe they've never done anything.

21
00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:54.920
So let's see if they can,
Or they can add a new one.

22
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.759
But if we reload the page,
it's gone again.

23
00:02:03.234 --> 00:02:07.769
We're getting some errors in the console
too, this sure looks like the error

24
00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:11.900
we are monitoring caught this,
cannot read property substr of null.

25
00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:18.187
The real problem with this error is that
it's a huge user experience impact for

26
00:02:18.187 --> 00:02:18.860
this user.

27
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.538
They think that their data is gone,
every time they visit getRANTR,

28
00:02:23.538 --> 00:02:25.408
their entire timeline is missing.

29
00:02:25.408 --> 00:02:30.206
And they can add some new stuff, but as
soon as they come back, it's gone again,

30
00:02:30.206 --> 00:02:32.650
so that's a really bad UX.

31
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.177
So let's use some of the tech tools and

32
00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:36.101
techniques that we've
already talked about.

33
00:02:36.101 --> 00:02:39.113
And see if you can take
a look using user 3,

34
00:02:39.113 --> 00:02:43.487
see if you can troubleshoot
what's going on with this issue.

35
00:02:43.487 --> 00:02:46.900
We'll take one more 10 minute break, and
we'll come back we'll solve it together.
