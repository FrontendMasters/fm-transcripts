00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.230
Now, there's another failure
happening in our monitoring.

2
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.340
Sometimes we're seeing
jQuery is not defined.

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.230
And so that's your turn.

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.061
Simulate the jQuery fails to
load just by commenting out

5
00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:17.706
the script tag in index.html.

6
00:00:17.706 --> 00:00:22.480
And then figure out how to do something
intelligent with that information for

7
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.170
the user.

8
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.230
Record an error that we've
had this failure and

9
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.150
do something intelligent to tell the user,
hey,

10
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.700
we know something broke,
we will deal with it.

11
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.735
Do something to improve the user
experience of jQuery failing to load.

12
00:00:40.735 --> 00:00:44.586
Let's take ten more minutes,
play around with it.

13
00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:46.609
There's notes in the exercise file and

14
00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.620
one possible solution at
the bottom of it if you get stuck.
