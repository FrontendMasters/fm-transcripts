00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.760
So let's do another bug.

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.080
So here I have a feature
that's blowing up,

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.778
here Rant text is remembered
after we delete it.

4
00:00:08.778 --> 00:00:15.320
And so a user reported this to us, which
is, the most expensive kind of issue.

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.420
So let's see if we can figure this out.

6
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:25.639
So the feature that I have here
Which I think is really cool,

7
00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:32.560
is that if your user is typing
some very thoughtful rant, and

8
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:39.753
they're just spending a lot of
time wordsmithing something,

9
00:00:39.753 --> 00:00:45.070
like front end masters is so
lame, fake news.

10
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.530
And then, I don't know how to finish that.

11
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.020
Later I can come back, and reload
the page, and it's still there, right?

12
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.740
I wanna pick up where I left off.

13
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.636
So, when I'm ready to pick up and
keep going and say, it's fake news, so

14
00:00:59.636 --> 00:01:04.233
sad, that's it.

15
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.880
But maybe now I reconsider and I say,
you know what, that's wrong and

16
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.740
inflammatory, and
I should really delete that.

17
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.860
So, I'm going to select all the text and
remove it.

18
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.250
But the next time I come back to
get ranter, it shows up again.

19
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.239
So why is it still there?

20
00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:30.046
So we're gonna turn this
over to you right away,

21
00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:32.150
to some of the same
techniques you already used.

22
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.200
I'd say,
take a look at the DOM inspector and

23
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.360
see what are the things that
are listening to that textbox.

24
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.760
And see if you can figure out,

25
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.450
why is this remembering the text even
though the user deleted everything in it
