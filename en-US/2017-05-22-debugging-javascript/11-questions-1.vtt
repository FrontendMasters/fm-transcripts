Henry asked about how you can remove
fade extra listeners added by frameworks

2
00:00:05.226 --> 00:00:08.830
like Angular and React?

3
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:09.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

4
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.190
&gt;&gt; In Chrome.

5
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.300
&gt;&gt; How you can remove them?

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.514
So-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

7
00:00:12.514 --> 00:00:16.430
&gt;&gt; When you're looking at a particular
space on a particular element, like when

8
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.350
we were examining this text area here,
and we're looking at the event listeners.

9
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.569
Now, there's two different
check boxes up here.

10
00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.230
The first one we already
talked about was Ancestors,

11
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.200
where you can look at what are the things
listening at a higher level?

12
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.929
The second one is
framework-based listeners.

13
00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:39.424
Now, this one 's not so much for removing
all the, the purpose of this is so

14
00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:45.020
that you can see your code
through the framework listeners.

15
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.956
So, a lot of frameworks will introduce
intermediary levels of event listening,

16
00:00:49.956 --> 00:00:56.376
and so by, By turning this on,
it's going to allow you to look through

17
00:00:56.376 --> 00:01:01.480
the code in a framework and see what parts
of your code are actually executing.

18
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.640
So for example, if I turn off Framework
listeners, the only thing that's actually

19
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.610
listening to keyup inside of
this text area is tracker.js,

20
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.890
which is a piece of our framework code.

21
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.950
But that's not very helpful.

22
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.760
If you turn this off,
a lot of your listeners might be jQuery or

23
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.110
Angular or whatever.

24
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.703
So by turning that checkbox on,

25
00:01:20.703 --> 00:01:24.310
it still shows the framework code
that is actually attaching the event.

26
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.690
But also showed you the actual event
handler that proxied through your code.

27
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.493
In just about every cases,
I imagine you want this turned on.

28
00:01:32.493 --> 00:01:37.339
Because you probably care about
what bits of your code are actually

29
00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:42.850
listening to an event,
not the intermediary framework layers.

30
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.754
Does that answer Henry's question, I hope?

31
00:01:45.754 --> 00:01:50.110
&gt;&gt; Patrick had a question about
a solution for the first exercise.

32
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.524
He tried
a localStorage.setItem('next-rant',

33
00:01:55.524 --> 00:02:02.310
text), localStorage.removeItem-
&gt;&gt; Here, let me go to this chat.

34
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kinda hard to read.

35
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.240
&gt;&gt; He created an else.

36
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So it-

37
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.464
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's an if-else statement.

38
00:02:07.464 --> 00:02:12.430
&gt;&gt; It checks text, and if that's false-
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a totally fine solution,

39
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.720
dude, that's fine.

40
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.531
I mean-
&gt;&gt; Why is he specific about the key?

41
00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:19.280
I think if he's trying-
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so

42
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.020
the idea that if there wasn't a truthy

43
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.310
value in text that you just cleared out,
I would say that's a fine solution.

44
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.000
There might be an edge case in that.

45
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.065
I mean, if we really wanna like split
hairs, there might be an edge case.

46
00:02:32.065 --> 00:02:37.668
Where if you've got an invalid event for
some reason, due to weird browser quirk or

47
00:02:37.668 --> 00:02:42.164
whatever, you might clear out
a valid value with a garbage event.

48
00:02:42.164 --> 00:02:45.356
But I can't think of a particular
case where that would happen, so

49
00:02:45.356 --> 00:02:46.440
it's probably fine.
