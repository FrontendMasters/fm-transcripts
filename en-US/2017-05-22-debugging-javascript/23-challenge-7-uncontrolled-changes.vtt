00:00:00.214 --> 00:00:03.670
So that is your exercise,
debug this error.

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.278
Why are we getting form.submit
is not a function?

3
00:00:06.278 --> 00:00:12.825
And how can we go about fixing this
error without changing analytics.js?

4
00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:17.410
Because we'll all be in situations
where there'll be things happening

5
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.217
because of third parties that you can't
ask Stripe to change their code, or

6
00:00:22.217 --> 00:00:25.088
Twitter to change their code, or whatever.

7
00:00:25.088 --> 00:00:28.945
Any questions before we get started, yeah?

8
00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:33.180
&gt;&gt; There's a question from Alex and

9
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.868
Karina online about, first of all,

10
00:00:37.868 --> 00:00:45.441
does HTTP/2 eliminates some
of these threading issues?

11
00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:48.201
&gt;&gt; Maybe, all right, so the question is,

12
00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:52.355
does HTTP/2 eliminate some
of these performance issues?

13
00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:56.441
Yes, HTTP/2 handles the the streaming of

14
00:00:56.441 --> 00:01:01.087
network of subresources
differently than HTTP.

15
00:01:01.087 --> 00:01:05.218
If possible, it's going to set up
a more stateful connection and

16
00:01:05.218 --> 00:01:07.780
start streaming multiple assets down.

17
00:01:09.842 --> 00:01:14.358
The optimization steps that
you will take to optimize for

18
00:01:14.358 --> 00:01:18.132
HTTP/2 versus HTTP are slightly different.

19
00:01:18.132 --> 00:01:22.791
However, not all of the web
has converted to HTTP/2 and

20
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:25.515
probably won't for a while yet.

21
00:01:25.515 --> 00:01:27.722
And so
you're gonna have clients on both sides.

22
00:01:27.722 --> 00:01:30.162
So which one do you want to optimize for?

23
00:01:30.162 --> 00:01:33.290
What I had optimized for
was nothing at all.

24
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.293
So it was not going to be good for either.

25
00:01:35.293 --> 00:01:39.485
Because even if it was HTTP/2, I still
would have gained a bunch of advantages on

26
00:01:39.485 --> 00:01:42.846
compressing the assets and
setting the proper caching headers.

27
00:01:42.846 --> 00:01:46.650
But I might not get as much from
combining them all together.

28
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.984
Look at your asset payload and
target what your browser clients are going

29
00:01:51.984 --> 00:01:57.331
to be communicating with, and
tailor your app to be best suited to them.

30
00:01:57.331 --> 00:01:59.791
That's a really good question.

31
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:00.555
Anything else?

32
00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:07.207
All right, so
this next exercise is Exercise 7.

33
00:02:07.207 --> 00:02:09.721
So this is a third party error.

34
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:16.448
So go to the signup page, try and submit
the form and troubleshoot the error.

35
00:02:16.448 --> 00:02:22.250
But you cannot change analytics.js or any
JavaScript file in the vendor directory.
