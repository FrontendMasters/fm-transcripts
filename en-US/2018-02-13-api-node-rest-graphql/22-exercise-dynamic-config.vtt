00:00:02.962 --> 00:00:06.520
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, so I basically
showed you what needs to happen here.

2
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.370
But in order for me to explain it,
I pretty much had to show you.

3
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.640
There's no test associated with this, and

4
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.330
the exercise is really just
to create a configuration.

5
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.670
It doesn't even have to look like mine.

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.000
You can create it however you want.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.270
I just want you to create a configuration

8
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.438
that has a default,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And

9
00:00:26.438 --> 00:00:31.360
it extends based off
environment variables.

10
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.240
So if you wanna look at mine,
again, I have a default here.

11
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.550
I'm requiring the one that has
the appropriate environment.

12
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.420
So if it's development or
dev, I'm requiring this file.

13
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.830
If it's testing or test,
I'm requiring this file.

14
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.250
And then I merge it.

15
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.440
So that's step one is create
your system for that.

16
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.118
You can piggyback my system,
that's totally fine.

17
00:00:53.118 --> 00:00:57.620
Then the next thing is go replace
those places that we saw.

18
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.960
So for instance, inside of index.js,
replace this with your configuration.

19
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.260
So in my case,
it would be something like this.

20
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.057
I would import config here,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: config

21
00:01:11.057 --> 00:01:15.953
from,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: config,

22
00:01:15.953 --> 00:01:17.820
it's the index, so
that's all I've gotta do.

23
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.611
And instead of putting 3000,
I would put config.port.

24
00:01:25.178 --> 00:01:28.058
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Boom, and now whatever
my configuration says the port is,

25
00:01:28.058 --> 00:01:31.180
depending on my environment,
it's gonna be that now, right?

26
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.290
And I'll also get rid of this.

27
00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:42.100
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go.

28
00:01:44.247 --> 00:01:45.390
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So that's one place.

29
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.720
Like I said, the other place you
would want to do this is in db.js,

30
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.320
you don't wanna hard code.

31
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.280
Mine's already changed.

32
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.722
So yeah, you don't wanna hard code
that URL in, you just wanna do that.

33
00:01:54.722 --> 00:01:56.568
I would say for now,
you probably only want,

34
00:01:56.568 --> 00:01:59.151
there's probably only two
databases you really should have.

35
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:00.751
You'll have one for testing and
one for development,

36
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:01.740
you should make those separate.

37
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.450
That way, cuz at testing, the database
gets wiped out every time, right?

38
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.025
So if that's wiping out
your development database,

39
00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:09.880
you'll probably aggravated when you
actually go to your app and you're like,

40
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.560
where is the C data that I put in there?

41
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.610
It got wiped out cuz
you used it in testing.

42
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.750
So whenever you make these configuration
files, you can see right here

43
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.040
I have a different database for
testing than I do for development.

44
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.710
Development actually just
defaults to this one.

45
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.820
All right, the way my system works is,
if I don't pass anything onto these files,

46
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.450
it's totally fine, because the index
has defaults for everything.

47
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.750
So whatever's not there,
it just won't override it.

48
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.270
So your system can be as naive,
as simple as you want.

49
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.466
It doesn't matter, as long as
you have the port, the database.

50
00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:46.582
And then for extra credit,
you can go ahead and

51
00:02:46.582 --> 00:02:49.947
put in the,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: auth JWT_SECRET,

52
00:02:49.947 --> 00:02:50.750
right here.

53
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.362
So instead of hard coding
the secret that was right here,

54
00:02:54.362 --> 00:02:57.003
you can use the configuration to do that.

55
00:02:57.003 --> 00:02:59.233
That secret would probably be injected
in with an environment variable.

56
00:02:59.233 --> 00:03:01.056
And then for super extra credit,

57
00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:04.270
you can also have your
configuration disable auth or not.

58
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.170
So I'm like, I wanna run in dev mode.

59
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.227
And then for dev mode,
I'm gonna say, what is it?

60
00:03:12.227 --> 00:03:13.380
Let me go back to it.

61
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.557
For dev mode, I'm gonna turn off auth, so

62
00:03:16.557 --> 00:03:20.100
I can not deal with logging
in a user every time.

63
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.110
So this one is called disableAuth.

64
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.091
So if I were to say disableAuth,
and I go back to my config for dev,

65
00:03:27.091 --> 00:03:29.457
and I put disableAuth: true.

66
00:03:29.457 --> 00:03:37.124
And then now, when I run my server,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool,

67
00:03:37.124 --> 00:03:39.129
so if I run my server now,
I try to hit it.

68
00:03:41.064 --> 00:03:45.689
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: 3000/api/notes.

69
00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:51.060
It still breaks because I turned off auth,
but I think it's still looking for a user.

70
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.060
Yeah, so I turned off auth, but

71
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.190
it's still doing the other middleware,
which is this one right here.

72
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.290
It's still doing this.

73
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.870
This is undefined right here, so
it's still breaking right here.

74
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.462
So maybe I'll extend it
to also not do that.

75
00:04:04.462 --> 00:04:05.022
Let's see.

76
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.201
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go.

77
00:04:11.513 --> 00:04:12.210
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Let's try it again.

78
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.960
There we go, yeah, that was totally it.

79
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.184
So that's extra credit,

80
00:04:16.184 --> 00:04:19.640
is just turn off authentication with
that configuration that's there.

81
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.062
So you can see the power of this.

82
00:04:21.062 --> 00:04:25.870
You can just come in like, yeah, for
testing, turn off authentication.

83
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.560
Or for development, turn it on,
however you wanna do it.

84
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.985
But yeah, make a system like that.

85
00:04:30.985 --> 00:04:33.090
It doesn't have to be intricate,
it doesn't have to be perfect.

86
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.871
I just want you to get in the habit of
building your own configuration thing.

87
00:04:35.871 --> 00:04:39.730
I'm gonna leave mine up,
this one's not gonna take too long.

88
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.671
Let's say, it's 3:52 now,
let's come back at 4:15.

89
00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:49.595
And we'll talk about implementations that
you might have done, any fallacies that

90
00:04:49.595 --> 00:04:54.120
you might have figured out, or any
other optimizations we could have done.

91
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.775
And then we'll go from there.

92
00:04:56.775 --> 00:04:59.743
&gt;&gt; Student: So you wanna hit just
dev.js or prod, or something like that,

93
00:04:59.743 --> 00:05:01.387
to show us the example?

94
00:05:01.387 --> 00:05:03.030
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, sure.

95
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.860
prod, nothing,
cuz I didn't do anything for prod.

96
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.031
dev, I just put an expireTime for the JWT.

97
00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:10.852
&gt;&gt; Student: Okay.

98
00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:14.410
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I put in secrets,
here's my JWT_SECRET.

99
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.730
And I disabled auth.

100
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.500
For testing, I'll just add
a database URL that's different.

101
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.990
So basically, if you wanna know
how it works in my system,

102
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.610
you basically create this base config,
right?

103
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.048
But every single file is
the same shape as base config,

104
00:05:31.048 --> 00:05:34.280
minus the properties they
don't wanna override.

105
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.279
So if my dev file,
all I wanted to do is overwrite the port,

106
00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:38.700
that's all it would have.

107
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.190
It would have a port,
it wouldn't have anything else.

108
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.759
Because the way it merges is,
this overrides this.

109
00:05:47.832 --> 00:05:49.182
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: You can
also do a dynamic require,

110
00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.800
although I don't recommend doing that,
you can totally do that.
