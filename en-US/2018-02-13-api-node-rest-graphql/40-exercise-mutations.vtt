00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.080
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, so
if you check out to lesson 12,

2
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.290
you're gonna be tasked with creating
mutations for the song and the playlist.

3
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.250
So I should be able to create,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Update, and

4
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.190
remove songs and playlists with mutations.

5
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.470
And I should be able
to see them in my doc.

6
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.590
So let's go here.

7
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.470
Or actually,
you can just focus on create and update.

8
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.330
If you want some extra credit,
you could do delete.

9
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.360
But you know how to do delete.

10
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.890
Only if you want to feel challenged.

11
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.969
So if you go look at the docs.

12
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.500
Eventually you should see some
mutations in here like this.

13
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.460
So you should see new song, update song,
new playlist, update playlist.

14
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.090
And if you went further you would
see remove song or remove playlist.

15
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.730
So what I want you to do is one, look
at what I'm doing in the user mutation.

16
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.450
Two, look at what we just did.

17
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.870
And three, If you get lost and
like how do I do this in Mongo.

18
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.710
Well, we already did it in
the controllers from yesterday.

19
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.930
So go look at the controllers
to see how we did it there.

20
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.830
It's more or less the exact same thing.

21
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.740
If that's the block is like I
don't how to do this in Mongo and

22
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.380
you can figure everything else
out in graphql, that's awesome.

23
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.070
Just go look at the controllers and
you can see how we're doing it there or

24
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.420
I can walk around and help you but

25
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.030
the important part here is like
how do I do this in GraphQL?

26
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.460
How do I get to the point where I'm
only stuck on the actual database part?

27
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.800
Which is pretty simple,
because that means GraphQL did its job.

28
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.190
It's not worried about the database.

29
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.130
Cool, any questions?

30
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.169
So let me pull up the test.

31
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.490
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So again the remove
ones are for extra credit.

32
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.760
Once you create those, you shouldn't
have to link up any files or anything.

33
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.350
It should automatically
just reload your graphical.

34
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.990
You should see them.

35
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.550
Everything's already linked up,
so you should be good to go.

36
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.210
And so remember you need to scope your
mutations in a mutation object like that.

37
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.970
Very much like we're doing a query,
you need to put them in mutation.

38
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.330
These are going to be merged
together eventually, so

39
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.810
it's totally fine to do a mutation.

40
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.440
Put your functions on there,
be done with it.

41
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.200
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool.

42
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.836
Any other questions?

43
00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:18.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Lesson 12 then?

44
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.066
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This is lesson 12.
