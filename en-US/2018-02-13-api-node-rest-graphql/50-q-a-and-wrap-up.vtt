00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.230
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay,
that is actually the end of the road here.

2
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.600
I'm leave the floor open now for

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.360
anyone to ask questions about any
advanced stuff we didn't get to.

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.800
There's so much stuff that's out
there that we didn't get to.

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.320
Like I said, we have fragments,
we have persistent queries, we have

6
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.860
interfaces enums, there's so many
different things that GraphQL can also do,

7
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.500
it can accomplish that we didn't get to.

8
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.520
We didn't talk about fetching data from
different sources inside of a resolver and

9
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.360
strategies for that, caching,
using data loader, tons of stuff there.

10
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.280
So if you always ask about
that let me know because if

11
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.080
you think about using GraphQL I can help
answer some of those questions that you or

12
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.680
your company might be having.

13
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.900
And then there's also different ways you
can deploy GraphQL servers where there's

14
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.190
a traditional server
like we built today and

15
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.490
there's different strategies
associated with that.

16
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.330
So there's some trade-offs,
there's some technologies involved.

17
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.230
There are different things
you can use on the client.

18
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.150
Different third party tools out there that
you can use to build stuff right now,

19
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.920
without having to build your own thing.

20
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.690
So this is your chance,
if anybody's got anything.

21
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.106
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you use Apollo for
most of your projects?

22
00:01:17.106 --> 00:01:18.346
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I use Apollo for
everything.

23
00:01:18.346 --> 00:01:20.540
I use the Apollo for the backing.

24
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.970
I use Apollo for the client.

25
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.010
It's just, to me, personally,
it's just the best thing so far.

26
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.080
They have, for the clients,
they have implementation every where from

27
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.120
React Native all the way
to view on the front end.

28
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.020
Whatever you can think of they have
some type of implementation for

29
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.660
it and it's pretty good.

30
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.770
And they just released 2.0,
where it's even faster now.

31
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.720
And it's only getting better.

32
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.510
They're literally dedicated just for that.

33
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.670
They also have like a tool
where it's like analytics and

34
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.110
performance measurement built
into your GraphQL service.

35
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.240
So you can see like on what resolvers,
what's taking forever, what's doing,

36
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.980
what on that level.

37
00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.850
So it's really good.

38
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.425
I would say they're close as you can get
other than being a creators of GraphQL

39
00:02:01.425 --> 00:02:02.198
that yourself.

40
00:02:07.571 --> 00:02:08.456
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Anything else?

41
00:02:12.378 --> 00:02:14.150
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No,
do we have any questions online?

42
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.650
Mark?

43
00:02:17.588 --> 00:02:19.386
&gt;&gt; Mark: I don't know,
I wasn't really paying attention.

44
00:02:19.386 --> 00:02:20.083
I can take a look.

45
00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:24.687
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right,
let's make sure I get those.

46
00:02:24.687 --> 00:02:25.496
&gt;&gt; Mark: No, looks good.

47
00:02:25.496 --> 00:02:26.072
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No?

48
00:02:26.072 --> 00:02:26.700
Okay, cool.

49
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.280
No questions online.

50
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.360
I will say going for it, try GraphQL.

51
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.390
It's really easy to get started.

52
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.920
Give it a try, build a simple to do
app with it or whatever you wanna do.

53
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.430
But I will say definitely try it out,
get lost in it.

54
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.750
Try it out with your favorite database.

55
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.070
You don't have to use
Mongo as you can tell.

56
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.240
You can use whatever you want.

57
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.270
You don't even have to use the database.

58
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.310
You can use like something
hosted somewhere else.

59
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.000
GraphQL doesn't care where
the data's coming from.

60
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.410
You can do it from memory if you want.

61
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.710
But just try it out.

62
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.250
I recommend it.

63
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.250
And see where it goes.

64
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.370
My opinion is that GraphQL is sort,

65
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.080
or graph API's in general are just
gonna completely wipe out REST.

66
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.910
GraphQL is the leading graph API.

67
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.220
There's also other graph APIs
out there that are like, okay.

68
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.990
One of them was one that was created
by Netflix, it's called Falcore.

69
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.750
It's been in developer preview for
like, two years.

70
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.810
I'm actually a contributor to it, me and

71
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.560
my friend Patrick, but
it's not really moving anywhere.

72
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.720
So, but it's proved that there
are other graph API's out there.

73
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.990
And I think that approach
is a lot better to building

74
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.560
the applications that we build today
using components and stuff like that.

75
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.070
So I will highly recommend like at least

76
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.560
getting your feet a little
more wet with GraphQL.

77
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.340
Building out some really
cool stuff with it.

78
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.450
Maybe even contributing to some stuff,
because you can pretty much do anything.

79
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.690
Like I said there's a plug in called
GraphQL anywhere that literally allows you

80
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.360
to use GraphQL queries to build anything,

81
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.150
you can generate a whole React
app with a GraphQL query.

82
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.060
Its kinda ridiculous
if you think about it.

83
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.500
There's also like a static
site generator called, men,

84
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.850
why can't I remember the name of it.

85
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.900
It's based on React, but

86
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.600
they basically use GraphQL to build
a static site, which is pretty crazy.

87
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.020
So there's a lot of stuff out
there you can do at GraphQL.

88
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.620
I recommend getting involve in
the community, building some stuff.

89
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.620
There's way more in there,
there's directives.

90
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.710
How much other stuff you can check out.

91
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.500
So I recommend getting into it.

92
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.580
And just having fun.

93
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.200
If you have any questions,
you guys can hit me up.

94
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.713
You can find me here on the Twitter's.

95
00:04:33.141 --> 00:04:34.360
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: @scotups.

96
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.860
So there you go.

97
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.190
You can find me right there.

98
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.210
And yeah, you can see up on there.

99
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.360
I'll probably respond.

100
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.320
If I don't just hit me up on GitHub.

101
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.380
I'll probably respond on there as well.

102
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.640
Other than that, thanks for coming.

103
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.180
Thanks, Frontend Masters.

104
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.280
Thanks, Mark.

105
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.866
I really had a good time
teaching this class.

106
00:04:50.866 --> 00:04:54.053
This is something I'm really passionate
about, with GraphQL and backend.

107
00:04:54.053 --> 00:04:56.587
Even though people know me for
doing front end stuff,

108
00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:59.430
I'm usually like on
the backend like all the time.

109
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.960
I just really like doing animations and
stuff.

110
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.900
But I also like working on the backend.

111
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.760
So I had a blast doing this.

112
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.498
Thanks.
