00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.110
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: If you
run the test on this,

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.790
if you check out to this
branch less than three, and

3
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.740
you run the test,
the tests are gonna hang.

4
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.480
Just like the stuff hung
when you wrote the code.

5
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.290
We see right now it's failing,

6
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.610
it's hitting Moca's time out limit of ten
seconds and it's just failing, right?

7
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.650
So your objective is to get these
tests to one, not only not hang, but

8
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.140
two, if you can get them to pass,
that'd be great too, so try to do that.

9
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.070
The command for that is MPM test or

10
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.950
yarn test, you should be able
to run those pretty easily.

11
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.980
You can also,
if you're using yarn you could do --watch.

12
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.210
If you're running MPM you
gotta do --space--watch and

13
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.050
then, you could watch them.

14
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.490
It's pretty fast.

15
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.330
The test had to compile in Webpack,
so it could take a minute, but

16
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.080
it's still pretty fast.

17
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.680
So I'm gonna go to the exact
challenge is what we're doing.

18
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.008
So basically right here,
complete controllers on query.js.

19
00:00:54.837 --> 00:00:57.010
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Get the route
api specs to pass.

20
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.050
They're probably hanging right now.

21
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.520
And ignore the model specs.

22
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.070
There will be some other tests in here
that are failing that has to do with

23
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.220
models, ignore those.

24
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.905
Don't even care about those.
