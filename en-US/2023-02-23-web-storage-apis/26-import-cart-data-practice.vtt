WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.229
Well then, to import is kind
of the reverse operation,

2
00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:10.369
okay, so we need to use the other handle,
the other way.

3
00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:18.340
The other, let's say, await window, is
the showOpenFilePicker without metadata.

4
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.010
The only difference is that
here it returns an array.

5
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.570
Why?

6
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.540
Not pocker, picker.

7
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.895
So, it returns an array, so

8
00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:31.080
I'm going to take the first one
because I'm expecting only one file.

9
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.404
Because the user, if I said so,
through properties, through options,

10
00:00:35.404 --> 00:00:37.580
the user can pick more than one file.

11
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.156
Can be a multi-selection.

12
00:00:39.156 --> 00:00:44.069
But if I don't say anything,
it's always one.

13
00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.606
Okay, so

14
00:00:44.606 --> 00:00:49.130
that's why I'm using this shortcut to
actually get the first element, okay?

15
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.130
So that's ES6.

16
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:58.520
From here, then I'm going to
take a file from that handle.

17
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.030
The handle is kind of a pointer
to the dialogue, okay?

18
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.170
And then, okay, give me the file.

19
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.050
But if here,
it doesn't feel like it has a meaning.

20
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.960
Why do we have a file and
a handle if it's just the same thing?

21
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.190
But remember that we
have a directory as well.

22
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.480
In a directory, it makes more sense
to have a handle to the folder.

23
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:29.250
And then I have files, okay, separate
files that I have over that handle.

24
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.070
The handle is where the permission lives,
okay?

25
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.440
So you need that handle every time
you want to save on that folder.

26
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.770
You don't wannna get rid of that handle.

27
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.205
If you do that,
you will need a new permission, okay?

28
00:01:42.205 --> 00:01:43.570
Make sense?

29
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.380
Well, so
then here I need to try to read the file.

30
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.766
So for example,
I can create the text of the file.

31
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:55.656
It's await file dot and

32
00:01:55.656 --> 00:02:01.147
here is where you can do array buffer,
okay,

33
00:02:01.147 --> 00:02:06.504
text or you can do a stream or
slice and so on.

34
00:02:06.504 --> 00:02:11.535
And when you have the text,
I could try to parse

35
00:02:11.535 --> 00:02:16.835
this as JSON,
JSON.parse of that text, okay?

36
00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:23.840
And before actually doing something,
well, anything can fail here, right?

37
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.037
So maybe it's not a JSON,
maybe the user has just picked a PNG file,

38
00:02:28.037 --> 00:02:31.260
you don't know,
the user is picking a file.

39
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.870
So it's completely out of your
control what's going on here.

40
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:44.207
So maybe we must use a try catch cuz
we are completely out of control.

41
00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:50.670
Like so
we'll handle the error in a minute.

42
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.010
And also, we should check
what's in that JSON object.

43
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.906
For example, I could check if it's
an array, if it's in an array

44
00:03:01.906 --> 00:03:07.110
because maybe it's a JSON but
completely different from my structure.

45
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.775
I can check also for example,
if the length is greater than zero, and

46
00:03:13.775 --> 00:03:19.013
I could even check even if the scheme
of the JSON matches what I'm expecting,

47
00:03:19.013 --> 00:03:20.680
I should do that.

48
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.627
If everything is correct,
then here, I could say,

49
00:03:24.627 --> 00:03:28.580
okay, well now I have that thing here.

50
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.844
If not, like here, I could make an alert,
don't do alerts anymore but yeah.

51
00:03:33.844 --> 00:03:38.538
I have the power of being the trainer so
I can do alert like the file is invalid or

52
00:03:38.538 --> 00:03:39.921
something like that.

53
00:03:39.921 --> 00:03:43.035
When something happens here like for
error reading file real, okay,

54
00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:44.048
something like that.

55
00:03:44.048 --> 00:03:50.090
Makes sense?

56
00:03:51.940 --> 00:04:01.025
So, I think everything looks good.

57
00:04:01.025 --> 00:04:06.664
So, I can refresh here,
I can delete my cart, okay?

58
00:04:06.664 --> 00:04:10.568
I can try to add something like there,

59
00:04:10.568 --> 00:04:15.574
I can try to import another
one from card.json.

60
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.940
And of course it didn't work.

61
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.948
Why?

62
00:04:21.948 --> 00:04:25.229
What do I need to do
after changing my card?

63
00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.231
&gt;&gt; You need to render.

64
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:27.935
&gt;&gt; We need to render.

65
00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:30.514
Re-render it.

66
00:04:30.514 --> 00:04:36.310
Also we could check also indexV if
it's changed there, but anyway.

67
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.407
So we go re-render, so
after doing that, render,

68
00:04:44.407 --> 00:04:50.100
remember this is not reactive programming.

69
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.951
So this is classic
programming event based.

70
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:58.032
So we need to call when we
wanna change something, okay?

71
00:04:58.032 --> 00:04:58.640
Makes sense?

72
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.500
So, actually,
what else do we have in the API?

73
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.144
We have all the management of
directories like creating files,

74
00:05:10.144 --> 00:05:15.100
new files in the director renaming files,
deleting files.

75
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.490
That is not a big deal.

76
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.480
It's very niche also.

77
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.300
Okay, if you need to manage a directory,
and that's all.

78
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.848
So yeah, we could manage binary files,
but yeah,

79
00:05:27.848 --> 00:05:32.760
it depends on the file you're,
parsing to see what you do, okay?

80
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.412
But the API is pretty simple.

81
00:05:34.412 --> 00:05:39.915
It's not really complicated, okay,
to read file or to write files.

82
00:05:39.915 --> 00:05:45.138
Just remember these happens
completely out of the quota, okay?

83
00:05:45.138 --> 00:05:51.499
So if you wanna use a terabyte, you can,
the user granted you permission.

84
00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:54.162
So over that folder, you can, okay?

85
00:05:54.162 --> 00:05:57.890
But just remember,
it's a public file system.

86
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.776
So anything can happen
outside of your web app.

87
00:06:01.776 --> 00:06:04.182
Make sense?

88
00:06:04.182 --> 00:06:09.738
Any question on the file
system access API?

89
00:06:09.738 --> 00:06:14.390
Remember for now is chromium desktop.

90
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:20.353
So that's Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge.

91
00:06:20.353 --> 00:06:21.580
Sorry what?

92
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.039
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Brave.

93
00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:25.790
&gt;&gt; Brave, Opera and many others.

94
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.800
But anyway, I'm not sure about Brave,
we should check.

95
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:38.101
Actually, I'm not sure because Brave
disables many APIs from Chromium.

96
00:06:38.101 --> 00:06:42.169
A lot of APIs that have to
do with privacy and things,

97
00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:46.710
so there is a good chance that
Brave has disabled that API.

98
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.065
I don't know, I don't have the answer,
but it's possible.

99
00:06:50.065 --> 00:06:55.029
There are many API's
like example Bluetooth or

100
00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:59.629
USB, Web USB, they are disabled on Brave.

101
00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:01.837
&gt;&gt; I also do not know [LAUGH].

102
00:07:01.837 --> 00:07:03.189
&gt;&gt; That's fine.
