00:00:03.924 --> 00:00:09.760
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Today we're gonna be
diving into building APIs with GraphQL.

2
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.910
In the previous course we did it
with REST, today's gonna be GraphQL,

3
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.060
so there will be some similarities
if you've taken the REST course,

4
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.880
as far as resources we use but it's a
whole different paradigm we'll using that.

5
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.980
So, first thing first is let's go
over the course in the curriculum.

6
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.820
So, if you head over to GitHub you
can go ahead and clone this repo

7
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.330
which will be intro to GraphQL,
so go ahead and clone that.

8
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.960
And as far as dependencies, it's very
much like the API design with the REST,

9
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.460
you're just gonna need at least
Node version six, MongoDB, and

10
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.390
Git, that's basically it
that's all you're gonna need.

11
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.980
So if you have all those, you're
good to go, if you don't have Mongo,

12
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.580
I do recommend installing it you can
install it from the MongoDB website.

13
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.430
They have installation instructions for
all different platforms you can also use

14
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.030
mLab to use a hosted one,
they have a pretty easy setup.

15
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.470
You can use one for free and
the third option is just use MongoDB

16
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.230
server, which is an MPM packaged.

17
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.840
And yeah, this is a MPM packaged
that you can use that will,

18
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.080
basically, spin up in in-memory
MongoDB server for you to use,

19
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.570
if you don't want to download it but
I highly recommend downloading it instead.

20
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.560
So once you have all that you should be
good to go, so I'm just gonna go ahead and

21
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.210
kick it off,
jump into some of these slides.

22
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.120
The link to the slides are gonna
be in the Read Me of the repo, so

23
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.200
if you scroll down you'll see a resources
section and right there there are slides.

24
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.230
You can click on that and
that'll take you to the slides or

25
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.472
you can just follow along with me.

26
00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:55.990
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So like I said, this is
gonna be an introduction to GraphQL.

27
00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.290
GraphQL is very complex and

28
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.420
the reason it is is because it
makes things simple for you.

29
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.413
So I can talk about GraphQL for a month,
and I'm learning new stuff every day, so

30
00:02:06.413 --> 00:02:09.820
this is gonna be an introduction,
and it'll give you just enough for

31
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.313
you to create your own APIs and
work with other existing GraphQL APIs.

32
00:02:16.212 --> 00:02:18.030
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, so
intro to some of the tools.

33
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.367
So some of the familiar tools that
we're gonna be using like I said,

34
00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:22.220
we're gonna be using the Node.js for
the run times.

35
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.970
So that's we're gonna actually create
an APIs in node, which is a JavaScript.

36
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.270
MongoDB for our database,
you could use any database for GraphQL,

37
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.030
it doesn't have to be a graph database,

38
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.430
it could be whatever database you want,
it doesn't even have to be a database.

39
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.940
You can use GraphQL for
retrieving data for anything, I mean

40
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.540
you use GraphQL to write CSS queries if
you want it doesn't have to be a database.

41
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.364
We're gonna use Mongoose for
interacting with our database and

42
00:02:48.364 --> 00:02:51.920
then we're gonna be using Jest for
testing everything.

43
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.885
So those are some of the familiar
tools that having nothing to

44
00:02:53.885 --> 00:02:56.220
do with GraphQL that we'll
be using in this course.
