00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.950
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And the only thing
we're missing now is that a cat

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.970
also has an owner and an owner has a cat.

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.430
So, how do we resolve those?

4
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.780
Well we're gonna delegate to
the resolution of the types for them.

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.610
So how do we do that?

6
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.910
Well kind of the same things, so for
the owner what we'll do is we'll say,

7
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.810
we'll just return an empty
object like this.

8
00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:28.926
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And I'll tell you why
this should work and then for the cat,

9
00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:31.920
we'll also just returning an empty object.

10
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.580
Reason this should work is because we
know that owner.cat is a cat type, so

11
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.480
when this values returned, graph field's
gonna say, cool, this is a cat type.

12
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.330
I didn't check it yet, but I'm sure
it's a cat type, but you've already got

13
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.750
some stuff registered for the cat type,
so let me resolve those fields.

14
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.470
So this is going to send these back for
each one of those fields and

15
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.186
it's going to keep going
if I keep asking for it.

16
00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:56.920
So I'm gonna put some logs in
here because I see a lot of

17
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.150
confused faces because this part is really
confusing, but logging definitely helps.

18
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.027
So we'll say log in cat query and

19
00:01:06.027 --> 00:01:10.183
then we'll come in here and

20
00:01:10.183 --> 00:01:14.164
say, in cat name, oops.

21
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.367
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: In cat age.

22
00:01:20.774 --> 00:01:25.367
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then, in cat owner.

23
00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:30.754
So we'll do that and
then we'll come down here for

24
00:01:30.754 --> 00:01:36.407
owner and we'll say,
in owner name, in owner cat.

25
00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:44.911
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So again these revolvers
have no idea how they are going to be

26
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:48.230
queried, they have no idea
they're just resolving a type.

27
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.630
A name knows it has to return a string so

28
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.410
it returned a string, an age knows it has
to return a number it returns a number,

29
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.130
a cat knows it has to return a name,
age, owner so it returned that.

30
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.160
That's it they have no idea how they're
gonna be queried because it doesn't know.

31
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.720
The query determines what is not happening
to it until it actually comes to

32
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.440
the server right so
we're gonna write that query down.

33
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.960
So we'll refresh it, so
now let's just do, without the owner,

34
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.140
let's just see what happens.

35
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.660
So if I just do name,
you can see I get Daryl.

36
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.709
So if we go look at the logs for
the server, you can see it fired

37
00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.461
off in cat query first, and
then it fired off in cat name,

38
00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:30.020
so that means I ran the cat
query resolver in cat query.

39
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.912
It returned this blank object and
because this blank

40
00:02:34.912 --> 00:02:39.813
object returns this query,
cat returns a cat type.

41
00:02:39.813 --> 00:02:43.176
It then looked up to see that I actually
had resolvers for the cat type,

42
00:02:43.176 --> 00:02:46.311
it was like you asked for a name and
there is a resolver for it so

43
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:48.120
let me run that function.

44
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.350
So it ran this function because I
asked for it, if I didn't ask for

45
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.270
it it wouldn't run this function.

46
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.710
If I go back and instead, as you can
see the age function didn't run.

47
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.957
We didn't see in cat age anywhere because
I didn't ask for an age, if I'd asked for

48
00:03:01.957 --> 00:03:03.730
an age it would run this function.

49
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.364
The resolvers only gets triggered
when the query says so.

50
00:03:07.364 --> 00:03:12.560
All right, so if I go back and
I add age, and I run this query,

51
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.800
I get two and you can see that it says
it's in cat age now because I asked for

52
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.200
it so it actually ran this resolver and
it actually logged it in there.
