00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.180
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So some of the other
cool stuff I wanted to talk about,

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.020
definitely gotta give a shout out
to some of my favorite tools.

3
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.557
Prisma, highly recommend
checking them out.

4
00:00:07.557 --> 00:00:12.380
So if you've ever heard of a company
called Graphcool, they pivoted to this.

5
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.802
Basically what they do is if
you give them a database,

6
00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:23.999
they will create a GraphQL server for you,
with TypeScript bindings and everything.

7
00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:25.790
I mean, they basically
create you a GraphQL server.

8
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.680
It's pretty legit, so
I highly recommend checking them out.

9
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.810
They're adding new different
databases all the time.

10
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.547
Yeah, it's basically trying to
replace ORMs, like Mongoose, so

11
00:00:35.547 --> 00:00:38.080
you can just query everything
with GraphQL instead.

12
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.307
So it's pretty cool.

13
00:00:39.307 --> 00:00:42.400
I've used it before,
it's a really nice product.

14
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.420
So that one's good.

15
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.017
Another one is Hasura,
which is very similar to Prisma.

16
00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:54.070
Yeah, it's very similar to Prisma, as in
you give them a Postgres database, and

17
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.243
they just spin up a RESTful GraphQL API,
complete with searching, and filtering,

18
00:00:58.243 --> 00:00:59.915
and querying, and everything.

19
00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:01.680
They'll even deploy it for you.

20
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.361
And it has realtime as well,
so they have sockets.

21
00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:05.506
This one's really cool, too.

22
00:01:05.506 --> 00:01:08.000
I know the founders of both of
these companies, they're really,

23
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.970
really good people.

24
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.160
This one's also open source, for sure.

25
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.360
I think Prisma is also
open source as well.

26
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.050
So they're both really good to
contribute to, both really good teams.

27
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.313
Another product that's really
cool is GraphQL-Anywhere.

28
00:01:28.786 --> 00:01:32.528
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It got moved
to the public client.

29
00:01:32.528 --> 00:01:33.878
I see, okay, yeah.

30
00:01:33.878 --> 00:01:36.917
So basically, GraphQL-Anywhere basically
allows you to run GraphQL anywhere.

31
00:01:36.917 --> 00:01:40.010
So you can just run GraphQL
literally anywhere you wanna run it.

32
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.373
I run it on a client sometimes to do, like
I keep saying, making CSS, querying a DOM.

33
00:01:45.373 --> 00:01:47.960
You can do whatever you want
because you can run it anywhere.

34
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.250
You don't need a database or
anything like that.

35
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.660
You could literally run GraphQL
against anything anywhere.

36
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.910
Is it a good idea to do that?

37
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.790
No, probably not.

38
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.740
But it basically allows you to
tie into GraphQL's query language

39
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.770
to resolve whatever you want, right?

40
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.060
You can resolve, like I said,
there's querying a DOM,

41
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.860
you can resolve to spitting out SAS,
you can resolve to making animations.

42
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.813
I wouldn't be surprised if I googled
GraphQL animations, they would be a thing.

43
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.384
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Maybe not,
maybe somebody needs you to make that.

44
00:02:20.384 --> 00:02:21.223
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Not yet.

45
00:02:21.223 --> 00:02:23.440
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, not yet,
they're not there yet.

46
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.234
But yeah, so
GraphQL allows you to do that, or

47
00:02:25.234 --> 00:02:26.900
GraphQL-Anywhere allows you to do that.

48
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.498
Other cool stuff is,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: GraphQL CLI.

49
00:02:37.612 --> 00:02:41.520
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Which is exactly what
it sounds like, it's a CLI for GraphQL.

50
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.700
And it just helps you get started,
create schemas,

51
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.680
launches that playground
that we used today.

52
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.950
All types of GraphQL-related things.

53
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.104
So check it out, it's really cool.

54
00:02:55.104 --> 00:02:59.740
And then the last thing is,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: That's it.

55
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.400
I already showed you GraphQL playground.

56
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.000
Yeah, that's the only cool
stuff I can think of.

57
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.407
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The last thing is Tipe.

58
00:03:06.407 --> 00:03:07.782
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, yeah, so yeah.

59
00:03:07.782 --> 00:03:09.781
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, my company.

60
00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:13.949
Yeah, so Tipe, basically, I've been
working on Tipe for about a year, me and

61
00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:15.020
my two cofounders.

62
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.080
And basically what we're doing is
we're trying to be the next content

63
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.450
management system out there.

64
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.827
So you've got the WordPresses
of the world.

65
00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:25.643
What we're doing is we'll allow
you to create a schema file,

66
00:03:25.643 --> 00:03:29.502
whether it's in GraphQL, TypeScript,
JavaScript, doesn't matter.

67
00:03:29.502 --> 00:03:33.490
You create a file on your project, you
send one command with a CLI up to us, and

68
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.820
we generate a dashboard,
a API, and a schema.

69
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.905
And basically what we do is we allow
you to give that dashboard to your

70
00:03:39.905 --> 00:03:43.160
non-technical people on your team so
they can manage content on their own.

71
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.113
So they can change images, links, copy,

72
00:03:46.113 --> 00:03:50.830
anything that's content on your website,
or any app that you have.

73
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.240
They can change it with a generated
dashboard that's based on the rules, and

74
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.650
types, and schemas that you created.

75
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.631
And then that's it, and

76
00:03:57.631 --> 00:04:00.680
then they can change it on the fly,
you integrate it once, and you're done.

77
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.960
So that's basically what we do.

78
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.980
So we're pushing for that, we're
releasing our next version really soon.

79
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.520
You can watch the video if you'd like to.

80
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.448
Sign up for beta, just put your
email address in there and sign up.

81
00:04:11.448 --> 00:04:13.380
We've got a long list.

82
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.660
And, yeah, we use GraphQL,
we also use REST.

83
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.251
We also do a whole bunch
of other crazy stuff.

84
00:04:19.251 --> 00:04:21.325
So yeah, that's Tipe.

85
00:04:24.162 --> 00:04:24.694
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

86
00:04:24.694 --> 00:04:25.270
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right.

87
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.254
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Thank you.

88
00:04:26.254 --> 00:04:30.928
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [APPLAUSE]
