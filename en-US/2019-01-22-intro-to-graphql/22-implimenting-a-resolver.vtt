00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.170
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: That's like
the basics of resolvers.

2
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.060
Now we're actually gonna write some so
we can see how they work.

3
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.980
So what I'm gonna do is get rid of that.

4
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.850
I'm going to just do a quick one here, and

5
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.460
I'll just go back to what we had in
serverJS, and I'll do some stuff here.

6
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.211
So I'm gonna just clean this stuff up so
it's not getting in the way and

7
00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:21.620
breaking our stuff, so.

8
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.860
What I'm gonna do is,
I'll go back and I'll make a type.

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.330
And I really like cats,
[LAUGH] I'll make a type called Cat.

10
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.600
Name is String.

11
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.580
And let's put the age back here again.

12
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.060
Cool, so we got that.

13
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.455
And then what I'll do is I'll make
another type called Owner, and

14
00:00:43.455 --> 00:00:45.220
its name is a string.

15
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.080
We'll also get a cat and
allocate it a name.

16
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.670
And it has a cat.

17
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.850
And its type is gonna be a cat.

18
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.390
And then cat also has an owner.

19
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.300
And its type is gonna be an owner,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So we got that.

20
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.580
Let me get rid of this mutation here.

21
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.780
And then for our query type,
let's go ahead and do that.

22
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.970
We'll make some queries.

23
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.850
We'll say,
get a cat by a name which is a string.

24
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.736
And that's just gonna return a cat.

25
00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:29.330
And then we'll say,
get an owner by a name, which is a string.

26
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.170
That's just gonna return a owner.

27
00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:42.185
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So now that we have that,
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna go

28
00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:45.236
ahead and write a resolver so
this thing actually works.

29
00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:52.662
So what do I absolutely have to write
resolvers for in this scenario?

30
00:01:52.662 --> 00:01:53.752
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The two queries.

31
00:01:53.752 --> 00:01:57.115
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Right, the two queries, Cat
and Owner, I have to write resolvers for

32
00:01:57.115 --> 00:01:59.740
those, otherwise this
stuff's just not gonna work.

33
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.203
So to do that, remember, I gotta write
query, cuz they're on the query type.

34
00:02:05.203 --> 00:02:08.879
And then the name of the queries I want
is gonna be cat, so that's one there.

35
00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.060
And the other one is gonna be owner,
so there's one there.

36
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.170
So I have to do those.

37
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.460
So we'll do that, and then we'll
see what other ones we can write.

38
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.850
So for cat, if we look at the cat query,

39
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.210
we know it takes a name which is a string,
so we'll do that.

40
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.050
So the first argument,

41
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.278
like I said, it's almost always
gonna be null once you set it.

42
00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:28.659
So I'm just gonna put a placeholder there.

43
00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.190
The second argument is gonna be args
which we know is gonna be a name

44
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.480
property in there.

45
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.530
And then we have context which
literally is nothing, so

46
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.760
I'm not gonna even account for it.

47
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.210
So then I'll just say,
given this name of a cat,

48
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.700
I'll just return a cat that has that name.

49
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.785
So I'll just do that,
I'll say return a name, and

50
00:02:46.785 --> 00:02:51.455
I'll just give the name that
you passed me, args.name.

51
00:02:51.455 --> 00:02:58.535
We'll do that, and
then we'll set an age of three.

52
00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:01.087
And then for owner, we don't have that yet
so we'll come back to it,

53
00:03:01.087 --> 00:03:02.244
we'll just put empty object.

54
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.730
So we got that query, and then for
owner, we have a name which is a string.

55
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.490
And it also takes an argument,
so we'll do the same thing.

56
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.830
So placeholder, nothing is gonna there.

57
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.040
Arg, we know it's gonna be a name.

58
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.870
So now we'll just return name.

59
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.430
I'll give it the same name
that you passed me, args.name.

60
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.381
And then cat, we don't have that yet
so we'll get back to it.

61
00:03:30.842 --> 00:03:35.753
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So what I'm gonna do now is
I'm just going to run some logs in here so

62
00:03:35.753 --> 00:03:39.460
you can see in what order
stuff is happening.

63
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.552
So console log and cat resolver.

64
00:03:45.365 --> 00:03:52.442
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then in owner resolver.

65
00:03:52.442 --> 00:03:56.170
Okay, everybody following me so far?

66
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.110
Okay, so let's start the server.

67
00:04:07.098 --> 00:04:11.530
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, so 3,000,
head back over here, refresh.

68
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.150
Get a new schema, cool, so
we got our cat and our owner.

69
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.550
So let's go ahead and
make some queries here.

70
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.771
So I'm gonna go ahead and
do the cat query.

71
00:04:19.771 --> 00:04:24.412
I have to pass in a name, so you can
see that passing a variable inside of

72
00:04:24.412 --> 00:04:28.760
playground, you can just write
them in line like I'm doing now.

73
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.275
So I can give a name like Timmy,
like this.

74
00:04:34.275 --> 00:04:39.412
I could also add them here, but
we'll talk about that when we

75
00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:46.110
get to the mutation stuff in a minute
because it makes more sense there.

76
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.350
It goes away, there it is.

77
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.040
Okay, so we will just write it in line.

78
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.800
So cat, watch for the name,
make sure that works.

79
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.710
And that looks good,
got the name, got the age.

80
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.530
And then if I ask for

81
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.430
owner it's going to error out here
because owner is an object type.

82
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.740
So what fields on the owner do you want?

83
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.570
That's what it's asking for right now.

84
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:11.060
It's freaking out, so these are scholar
type so you don't have to expand them.

85
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.170
This is an object type, so
what do you want back from the owner?

86
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.980
You can't just ask for the owner and
get back the whole object.

87
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.990
That's not graphically aware, so you
have to be explicit about what you want.

88
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.370
Owner dot what, what do you want?

89
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.580
So that's why it's freaking out right now.

90
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.096
If I try to run this, actually
think Playground will automatically

91
00:05:27.096 --> 00:05:28.900
expand this for me and add fields.

92
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.284
I think that's what it will do, let's see.

93
00:05:31.284 --> 00:05:32.021
No, it doesn't.

94
00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:33.848
Yes, so you'll tell me field,

95
00:05:33.848 --> 00:05:37.200
owner of type owner must have
a selection of sub-fields.

96
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.080
Did you mean owner...something here?

97
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.980
So it's telling me you've got
to put something here cuz

98
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.110
I don't know what you want from owner.

99
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.110
And I can't give you
back a whole lot of it.

100
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.841
So we gotta put something here.

101
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:49.120
In this case, let's just say, name.

102
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.260
But because we didn't really write
a resolver for that, it gets null, right,

103
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.000
cuz we didn't put anything in that object.

104
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.740
So it's gonna be null.

105
00:05:59.829 --> 00:06:03.932
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So if we go back and
we look at our server output,

106
00:06:03.932 --> 00:06:05.476
you can see that.

107
00:06:05.476 --> 00:06:07.793
I'll just clear it, run it one time.

108
00:06:07.793 --> 00:06:08.770
I'm just gonna run it once.

109
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.150
You can see that it only went into
the cat resolver, just one time.

110
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.945
It didn't do anything else.

111
00:06:14.945 --> 00:06:20.290
Did anybody expect it to do anything else,
right?

112
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.959
Maybe, yeah, okay, yeah.

113
00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:25.476
You've might have expected for me to go to
the owners arg cuz it asks for an owner,

114
00:06:25.476 --> 00:06:27.675
but remember,
this is just a query called owner.

115
00:06:27.675 --> 00:06:28.793
I didn't run this query.

116
00:06:28.793 --> 00:06:32.891
I ran this query, and I asked for
a cat which is this entire object, and

117
00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:38.070
then I asked for the owner field on
this cat, which is just this object.

118
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.594
So it went here, and then because there's
no name probably on it, it nulled out,

119
00:06:42.594 --> 00:06:43.260
all right?

120
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.645
If I put a exclamation point here,
it'll break

121
00:06:47.645 --> 00:06:52.700
because I'm asking for
a name and it's null, right?

122
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.606
So if I restart this.

123
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.100
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And I go back.

124
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.416
And then I run this, it'll say,
no, you can't do it.

125
00:07:03.416 --> 00:07:05.010
owner.name is non-nullable.

126
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.470
You have to have a name there.

127
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.526
So it's starting to freak out, right?

128
00:07:08.526 --> 00:07:10.530
So that's why I didn't do that
cuz I knew that was gonna happen.
