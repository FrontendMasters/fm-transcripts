&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: One quick thing I wanted to
show that we didn't get to is that when

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.472
you do these queries like this, so
if I have animals, like species.

3
00:00:10.472 --> 00:00:14.900
And the reason I needed to show this
is cuz, we're not focusing on queries,

4
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.130
we're focusing on server.

5
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.420
But on the query side, as if we're doing
clients, you can make another query,

6
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.750
you can do multiple
queries in one request.

7
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.360
So if you wanted to say I'm gonna
do another animals query, but you

8
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.170
can't call it animals because that one's
already taken,, so I'm gonna say species.

9
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.640
Not only can you do another
query inside of one request,

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.320
I can alias this to be otherAnimal.

11
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.945
Or I did it the other way around,
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:46.945 --> 00:00:50.635
OtherAnimcal.

13
00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:55.026
So now I'm aliasing this animals
query to be called otherAnimals, but

14
00:00:55.026 --> 00:00:57.600
they're both running to animals query.

15
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.710
And I run two of them at the same time.

16
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.658
So I send one request over two queries,
so to execute two queries on my GraphQL

17
00:01:03.658 --> 00:01:06.964
server at the same time, and
I'll get back two results.

18
00:01:06.964 --> 00:01:10.040
These are still working, so I'm not
gonna hit play yet, obviously, it died.

19
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.820
But you can run multiple
queries at the same time.

20
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.450
I can put a third one here if I want.

21
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.310
I can run multiple mutations
at the same time if I want to.

22
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.970
So you can do that.

23
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.045
The reason we talk about that, cuz again,
this is on the query side of things from

24
00:01:21.045 --> 00:01:24.005
the client perspective, whereas we
talked about the server side of things.

25
00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:28.625
Th query side of things, there's a lot
of stuff there that it's a whole nother

26
00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:31.285
thing, that's just a whole nother course.

27
00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:35.700
But there's a lot of stuff you can do
over here that we did not talked about.

28
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.700
Named operations,
all different kind of stuff, so,
