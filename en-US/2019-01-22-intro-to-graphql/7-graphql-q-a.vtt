00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.410
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: As far
as VS code extensions,

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.280
do you use the GraphQL extension?

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.350
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No,
I don't use a GraphQL extension.

4
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.430
I think that GraphQL extension is
really cool, the ones that they have.

5
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.120
I just don't use it because lately,
the type of GraphQL servers

6
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.040
I've been making couldn't take
advantage of the extensions.

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.485
As in what the extensions do,
at least the ones that I've seen,

8
00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:26.460
they basically look at
your GraphQL schema and

9
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.680
they allow you to get all to get
all to complete in your schemas.

10
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.340
If you have schemas spread
across different files,

11
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.560
they might interact with type script and
give you some typing stuff there.

12
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.200
I haven't had a product that was
traditionally set up to do that.

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.730
Most of the GraphQL stuff that I've
been working on has been dynamic

14
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.520
Graph QL schemas on the fly so
it's just like AST lower level stuff, so

15
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.786
I couldn't take advantage of them.

16
00:00:45.786 --> 00:00:49.660
The only GraphQL plug in that I
say that I'm using is just one for

17
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.590
syntax highlighting.

18
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.290
So if you were to open up a GraphQL file,
it'll look pretty.

19
00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.210
But yeah, I will say the really
good GraphQL extensions for

20
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.440
VS code are the ones we're going
to use on our front end app.

21
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.700
Whereas you can give it your service
GraphQL file and it will give you

22
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.120
all the complete insight of your React
app or your Vue app, or your Angular app.

23
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.810
Those are the best.

24
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So would it be safe to
say that a schema defines the structure

25
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.460
of valid queries for the client side?

26
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.060
And resolvers are the functions
which names match the schema

27
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.620
that actually do the work
of querying the database?

28
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.390
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: That's exactly right,

29
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.404
whoever that is should just
come teach the course.

30
00:01:32.083 --> 00:01:35.191
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is Apollo server
an alternative to Express or

31
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:37.819
is it an extension, are both needed?

32
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.280
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So
if you go look at Apollo Server,

33
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.120
if you look at the source code it
actually does use Express, underneath it.

34
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.710
This is like their second
version of Apollo Server,

35
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.880
this is like Apollo Server two.

36
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.910
Before this, you had to download
the accompanying Apollo Server for

37
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.840
your server framework, so you had to
either get Apollo Server Express or

38
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.370
Apollo Server Happy,
whatever your favorite was.

39
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.280
Now they just simplified it.

40
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.310
We're just going to make our own
server and encapsulate Express.

41
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.150
But they also still support
if you have Express.

42
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.820
For instance if you have a REST API or
something else that you're doing and

43
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.600
you want to add GraphQL to it, you can
still dial it Apollo Server Express and

44
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.590
you can basically add your GraphQL server,

45
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.850
your Apollo Server as little ware to
your server that you already have.

46
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.170
So they do work hand in hand,
because at the end of the day,

47
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.790
Apollo Server is just Express.
