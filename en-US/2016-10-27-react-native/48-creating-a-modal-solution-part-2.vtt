00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.920
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So
let's look at that workout list.

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.155
All right, so
I'm using a couple things here.

4
00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:07.850
I got this button.

5
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.700
I got the React Native vector icons here,
a lot of stuff going on.

6
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.270
If we look and
see what's actually happening,

7
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.570
it's actually just
a small little view here.

8
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.430
So it's just a view that has a text
that says add some exercises and

9
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.824
it has a button that when you press it,

10
00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:28.090
it just calls
this.props.setModalVisibility to true.

11
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.470
So enable the modal when
you click that button.

12
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.970
That's it.

13
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.690
That's all it's doing and I added
a icon in the button which is a plus.

14
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.630
I didn't do anything else.

15
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.202
I'm not checking to see if the current
workout has items in it yet

16
00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:42.204
to render a list.

17
00:00:42.204 --> 00:00:44.337
We're gonna do that after the solution, so

18
00:00:44.337 --> 00:00:46.767
that's pretty much all
that's happening here.

19
00:00:46.767 --> 00:00:48.717
It's literally just calling this prop.

20
00:00:53.814 --> 00:00:56.833
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Any questions here?

21
00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:57.530
No, all right.

22
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.270
And then let's look at the exercise modal.

23
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.890
So this one's a little more beefy.

24
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.775
So the exercise modal is using,
did I get rid of?

25
00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:14.247
Wait.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Looks

26
00:01:14.247 --> 00:01:19.040
like I got rid of the actual modal code
in the modal, so we can do it live then.

27
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.041
So the exercise modal
is actually just going

28
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:25.052
to launch the modal
itself when clicked on.

29
00:01:25.052 --> 00:01:27.660
It looks like for
some reason I erased it somehow,

30
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.153
I don't know how, this is exercise list.

31
00:01:30.153 --> 00:01:35.657
That's why.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: One second.

32
00:01:35.657 --> 00:01:38.304
We'll speed this up so
we don't have to watch me do this again.

33
00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:44.402
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go,

34
00:01:44.402 --> 00:01:50.982
there's the modal, super easy.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So here we go.

35
00:01:50.982 --> 00:01:58.118
This is the ExerciseModal.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We

36
00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.351
don't need to list right now,
we'll just put a View here.

37
00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:07.723
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And a Text.

38
00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.792
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, so

39
00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:26.830
the ExerciseModal is literally just
going to take in the visible property.

40
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.954
So if we go back and look at the current
workout, it has a visible property.

41
00:02:29.954 --> 00:02:31.310
That's gonna be true or false.

42
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.444
That's gonna be bound to
the props.exerciseModal that's

43
00:02:34.444 --> 00:02:35.495
coming from React.

44
00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:38.700
So it's gonna take that, and
it's also gonna take a method or

45
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.313
function called closeModal.

46
00:02:40.313 --> 00:02:43.010
So if we go back and look at that.

47
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.319
Here we go.
So we're binding to the visible

48
00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.360
property on an actual Modal component
provided us from React Native.

49
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.032
We're binding straight to that.

50
00:02:51.032 --> 00:02:52.379
I'm gonna put a slide animation on.

51
00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.770
And then onRequestClose,
this is specifically for

52
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.242
Android to send props.closeModal.

53
00:02:58.242 --> 00:03:03.044
For iOS, you don't have to put this, for
Android this is required so clean up,

54
00:03:03.044 --> 00:03:04.848
and that's about it for now.

55
00:03:04.848 --> 00:03:09.188
Eventually we'll have some other stuff
in here in the modal but for right now,

56
00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:17.025
this is it.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Any questions on this?

57
00:03:17.025 --> 00:03:17.770
I'm gonna run it.

58
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.335
I think it's gonna break
cuz I forgot to do RNPM.

59
00:03:20.335 --> 00:03:21.878
Any questions so far before we run it?

60
00:03:21.878 --> 00:03:26.810
And then we'll go through the Redux thing
and we'll see where the modal's opening

61
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.065
and how that stuff is working so
we can actually see it.

62
00:03:30.065 --> 00:03:30.715
No questions?

63
00:03:30.715 --> 00:03:33.861
Okay, let me just restart it.

64
00:03:33.861 --> 00:03:36.508
Pretty sure I got to run rnpm but
let's just see.

65
00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:43.973
I want the binaries already
linked from last time, yeah.

66
00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:44.925
Let's see here,

67
00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:52.167
main.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This

68
00:03:52.167 --> 00:03:57.116
thing's freaking out on.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah.

69
00:03:57.116 --> 00:03:58.335
It's in a container now.

70
00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:12.713
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: From CurrentWorkout,

71
00:04:12.713 --> 00:04:13.497
there we go.

72
00:04:13.497 --> 00:04:21.682
So let's refresh that.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We are in containers.

73
00:04:21.682 --> 00:04:26.876
There we go.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No,

74
00:04:26.876 --> 00:04:27.998
it is not attached to parent.

75
00:04:27.998 --> 00:04:30.773
Okay, so you just gotta reload it, cuz
you don't know what you're talking about.

76
00:04:30.773 --> 00:04:35.789
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go.

77
00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.874
All right, so it looks like we've got
some styling issues going on with

78
00:04:40.874 --> 00:04:45.900
this current workout thing like this
top bar taking up the whole page.

79
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.840
So if we go to currentWorkout
we can kind of fix that.

80
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.035
Why is that thing freaking out?

81
00:04:51.035 --> 00:04:56.315
It's because,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So

82
00:04:56.315 --> 00:05:03.479
let's give it a height of 40.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Wow,

83
00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.075
why is that still so big?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it cuz

84
00:05:07.075 --> 00:05:10.495
you have another flex 1 down below?
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, but

85
00:05:10.495 --> 00:05:13.320
I thought I took the flex off of it.

86
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.471
All right, that's what I'll do,
I think the default flex for

87
00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:22.390
that top bar should just come off.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: You don't flex.

88
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.513
No default flex for you.

89
00:05:26.513 --> 00:05:27.582
There we go.

90
00:05:27.582 --> 00:05:31.250
And then we'll put 60 back here.

91
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.329
There we go, sweet.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right, so now

92
00:05:36.329 --> 00:05:41.432
we've got this button here, if we click
it, the modal pops up and it says modal.

93
00:05:41.432 --> 00:05:43.500
So what we'll do is we'll just
run through this right quick.

94
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.350
I can't close it cuz I didn't
put the close thing in there.

95
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.620
But we'll just run through and
see how all that is working, yeah?

96
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.700
All the way, yeah.

97
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.890
So you can't see the menu
if the modal is up.

98
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.830
I forgot about that.

99
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.590
So let's actually just add the button
to close it right quick, yeah.

100
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.780
So we'll say import Button from,

101
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.990
what's that button thing that I use?

102
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.556
That's this person.

103
00:06:11.556 --> 00:06:14.215
People always try to namespace
their packages with weird names.

104
00:06:14.215 --> 00:06:21.262
APSL, I'm not sure what that means,
but that's their namespace, Button.

105
00:06:23.596 --> 00:06:28.798
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then we'll say onPress

106
00:06:28.798 --> 00:06:34.228
just props.closeModal and

107
00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:41.022
then children, we'll say close.

108
00:06:41.022 --> 00:06:44.041
There we go, so now if I close it,
it should close, sweet.

109
00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:45.098
All right, so let's actually look at this.

110
00:06:45.098 --> 00:06:46.154
Let's go to debugger.

111
00:06:46.154 --> 00:06:50.926
Let's turn this on,
it's already on, sweet.

112
00:06:50.926 --> 00:06:56.482
Let's go to debugger, go here, open this
up and let's set up some breakpoints so

113
00:06:56.482 --> 00:06:59.879
we can follow along what's
actually happening.

114
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.480
So the first thing we wanna do is let's
go look inside of the containers and

115
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.004
currentWorkout.

116
00:07:10.004 --> 00:07:13.840
So currentWorkout, you can go away.

117
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.690
We want to take a look at when we click

118
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:23.500
to open the modal so
that's gonna be this method right here.

119
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.750
So let's take a breakpoint there.

120
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.095
So I'm gonna dispatch this action.

121
00:07:27.095 --> 00:07:30.645
We're gonna dispatch this function, this
action creator which takes a Boolean and

122
00:07:30.645 --> 00:07:32.145
that's gonna dispatch an action.

123
00:07:32.145 --> 00:07:35.972
So then what that's gonna run
if we head over to actions,

124
00:07:35.972 --> 00:07:40.214
it's then gonna run inside of
actions this method right here.

125
00:07:40.214 --> 00:07:42.550
So then we'll put a breakpoint here and
we should see this happen.

126
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.570
So this is just gonna return
an object with the payload on it.

127
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.291
And when that dispatches,

128
00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:55.376
it should run this reducer
right here inside of UI,

129
00:07:55.376 --> 00:08:00.600
which it's going to hit right here,
or right here.

130
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.503
Okay, I guess it'll be right there.

131
00:08:02.503 --> 00:08:04.523
Cuz it won't let me go anywhere else,
sweet.

132
00:08:04.523 --> 00:08:08.123
And then once that happens,
then the modal will open up.

133
00:08:08.123 --> 00:08:11.010
Because when this happens right here,
when this new state happens,

134
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.660
it's gonna come full circle back
around a current container.

135
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.509
And it's gonna be like, all right,
update this state right here which is

136
00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:22.751
gonna update this prop,
which is gonna cause this to rerender.

137
00:08:22.751 --> 00:08:27.813
And when it rerenders the thing
that changed is this.

138
00:08:27.813 --> 00:08:28.700
This will now be true.

139
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.284
It was false, but
after we ran through Redux and

140
00:08:34.284 --> 00:08:40.480
did all that stuff inside the reducer,
we changed it to true on this payload.

141
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.580
So that's the only thing that's
gonna change on a rerender.

142
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.140
So let's check it out.

143
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.190
So if we hit that, looks like it stops.

144
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.850
If we go back, boom.

145
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.004
So yeah, it stopped right here first,
and if we look,

146
00:08:54.004 --> 00:08:58.210
the thing that we passed invisible
is just a Boolean that says true.

147
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:02.026
That's it, we passed that into
setExerciseModalVisibility and

148
00:09:02.026 --> 00:09:06.410
we can look, the modal hasn't
opened up yet, still closed.

149
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:14.374
We hit play, we walk through it some more.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Did it stop?

150
00:09:14.374 --> 00:09:15.837
What happened?

151
00:09:15.837 --> 00:09:16.812
Okay, it just went on.

152
00:09:16.812 --> 00:09:21.550
Anyway, now it stopped over here.

153
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:22.490
Then it stopped here.

154
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.880
Wait, did I take the breakpoint off?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's false.

155
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.706
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,

156
00:09:29.706 --> 00:09:32.325
cuz I just hit closed.

157
00:09:32.325 --> 00:09:36.075
It should stop right here.

158
00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:37.097
I guess it just didn't feel like it.

159
00:09:37.097 --> 00:09:41.532
Let's,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Play right quick.

160
00:09:41.532 --> 00:09:42.844
There we go.

161
00:09:42.844 --> 00:09:43.726
All right, let's try that again.

162
00:09:43.726 --> 00:09:45.816
So we hit open, it'll stop right here.

163
00:09:45.816 --> 00:09:51.984
All right, so now we're dispatching
setExerciseModalVisibility

164
00:09:51.984 --> 00:09:55.394
from '../actions/actions'.

165
00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:56.694
Cool, so yeah, it should stop right here.

166
00:09:56.694 --> 00:09:57.832
I don't know why it didn't stop.

167
00:09:57.832 --> 00:09:59.133
That's weird.

168
00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:07.805
Let's play it again.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: What?

169
00:10:07.805 --> 00:10:10.986
So it's not stopping here,
but it's actually working.

170
00:10:10.986 --> 00:10:12.577
It's kind of crazy.

171
00:10:12.577 --> 00:10:14.574
Maybe I'll just do a refresh right quick.

172
00:10:14.574 --> 00:10:15.839
Let's try that.

173
00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:32.941
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Reload, there it is.

174
00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:37.747
[LAUGH] Now it just comes in here somehow.

175
00:10:37.747 --> 00:10:39.617
There it is.

176
00:10:39.617 --> 00:10:42.298
Okay, thank you.

177
00:10:42.298 --> 00:10:43.935
Okay, let's try that again.

178
00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:50.042
So now we'll hit that.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There it is.

179
00:10:50.042 --> 00:10:53.966
So this time it stopped right
here on the createAction,

180
00:10:53.966 --> 00:10:58.901
which is going to just set the type
to SET_EXECERCISE_VISIBILITY.

181
00:10:58.901 --> 00:11:02.442
And then set the value of true, right?

182
00:11:02.442 --> 00:11:07.405
And if we hit hit Play again.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Did I not

183
00:11:07.405 --> 00:11:08.351
set up the reducer one?

184
00:11:17.488 --> 00:11:18.633
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go.

185
00:11:18.633 --> 00:11:20.217
It moved it.

186
00:11:20.217 --> 00:11:21.273
Cuz I totally put it right there.

187
00:11:21.273 --> 00:11:23.479
Look, it's trying to move it.

188
00:11:23.479 --> 00:11:27.508
Right there, thank you.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Hit close.

189
00:11:27.508 --> 00:11:28.290
Hit Play.

190
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:31.280
There we go.

191
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.880
So this time I closed it, but
you can see it now it actually hit it.

192
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:38.233
So the breakpoint's in the right place and
it just set the type, same type that we

193
00:11:38.233 --> 00:11:41.705
dispatched and the payload in this
case is false cuz I hit close.

194
00:11:41.705 --> 00:11:45.221
And once I hit Play, this should close and

195
00:11:45.221 --> 00:11:49.432
it closed.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So

196
00:11:49.432 --> 00:11:53.408
let's actually run it
through smoothly this time.

197
00:11:53.408 --> 00:11:53.930
There we go.

198
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:54.873
So it stops right here on

199
00:11:54.873 --> 00:11:58.646
the createAction.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And

200
00:11:58.646 --> 00:12:01.210
then stops right here on
the reducer with the payload true.

201
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:07.186
And then once this reducer is done,
state is updated, modal is open, and

202
00:12:07.186 --> 00:12:12.570
it does the same thing going backwards,
except for now the visible is now false.

203
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.925
Well it's exactly the same thing,
we're just changing the value.

204
00:12:14.925 --> 00:12:19.616
Reducer picks it up, switches it to false,
and now it's closed.

205
00:12:22.425 --> 00:12:24.631
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Everybody follow that?

206
00:12:24.631 --> 00:12:26.240
And the reason that works is remember,

207
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:31.448
cuz we're binding in the currentWorkout,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Set

208
00:12:31.448 --> 00:12:37.010
this.props.setModalVisibility, which
we're getting from Redux is, I'm sorry.

209
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:41.944
We're binding to this.props.exerciseModal
which we're getting from Redux

210
00:12:41.944 --> 00:12:44.780
with is state.ui.exerciseModal.

211
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.295
That's the thing that
we're setting right here.

212
00:12:46.295 --> 00:12:51.239
When we pass in this visible character,
we're overriding this value right here.

213
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.230
And when it re-renders through the props,

214
00:12:55.230 --> 00:13:00.950
this gets called again with the props
changed, of this now being true or false.

215
00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:02.430
And that's what toggles the visibility.
