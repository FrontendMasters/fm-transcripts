00:00:00.364 --> 00:00:04.236
&gt;&gt; Scott: [SOUND] So
now we have our actions now all

2
00:00:04.236 --> 00:00:09.076
we have to do is wire these
up to our component and

3
00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:13.806
we can actually use them and
modify the state.

4
00:00:13.806 --> 00:00:16.090
So there's a few ways we can do this.

5
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.660
What we're going to do is use the best
way it's a little more set up but

6
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.500
it's definitely the best way to do it.

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.736
We need to head over to our
root component which is

8
00:00:26.736 --> 00:00:31.370
either an index to enter digests or
index the iOS.

9
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.780
Either one of which I wonder using or both
and instead of just returning to do here.

10
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.760
We actually have to return.

11
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.095
We have to import.

12
00:00:39.095 --> 00:00:43.693
{ Provider } from 'react-redux'; so

13
00:00:43.693 --> 00:00:49.058
provider pretty much just
provides in the store to

14
00:00:49.058 --> 00:00:56.560
all of our components that way you
can subscribe to state changes.

15
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.660
It does all that for us and
we can set it up manually, do context but

16
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.310
providers is gonna do it for us.

17
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.200
So now we want to return this provider.

18
00:01:09.223 --> 00:01:12.431
&gt;&gt; Scott: And inside of the provider,
we're going to place in,

19
00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.570
our application like that.

20
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.160
So to do, or whatever and

21
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.960
that's actually what I want to
do is I want to put a view here.

22
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.950
There we go.
No, let's not do that.

23
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.090
We'll say Todo, there we go.

24
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.468
And then we just need to provide
the provider with a store.

25
00:01:31.468 --> 00:01:34.935
So now we'll say,

26
00:01:34.935 --> 00:01:39.921
import store from our store

27
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:45.571
which is in src/app/store.

28
00:01:47.804 --> 00:01:49.386
&gt;&gt; Scott: And
we'll just pass the store here.

29
00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.269
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go.

30
00:01:59.407 --> 00:02:00.200
&gt;&gt; Scott: So now.

31
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.620
All the child components of Todo and todo
itself is actually is going to have our

32
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.550
access to the store and
we can do things with that.

33
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.180
So I'm moving kind of fast,
I'm doing it on purpose.

34
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.091
Don't worry, I'm not meant for you to
keep up and tag along right now, promise.

35
00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.454
&gt;&gt; Scott: So now what we're going to do is
we're going to head back over to Reddit

36
00:02:19.454 --> 00:02:21.720
and now we're going to tie
this stuff up all together.

37
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.990
But before I go head into
it any question so far?

38
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.906
We just covered a lot.

39
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.308
&gt;&gt; Scott: I went like
full steam into Redux.

40
00:02:32.953 --> 00:02:34.250
&gt;&gt; Scott: You guys said you wanted Redux.

41
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.070
You voted.

42
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.680
There was a vote.

43
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.720
People vote Redux.

44
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.275
No questions everybody understands this.

45
00:02:47.328 --> 00:02:49.523
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right cool.

46
00:02:49.523 --> 00:02:55.010
Okay, so now what we do is we need
to use a few things we need to do

47
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.250
we need to wrap this Reddit component.

48
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.140
We need to connect it to redux and

49
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.990
say hey this is the state that I want to
be the actions that I want to perform.

50
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.260
So we have to do that first move
because Reddit is not a child of todo

51
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.420
we also have to like place it inside
the child or whatever the root is.

52
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.040
And the root is in this case to do So
we have to place it to be

53
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.440
a drive Todo in order to get access
to redux store and what not.

54
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.520
So there's a lot of stuff
that we have to do here,

55
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.680
I don't really want to cover all that
stuff because it's kind of complicated.

56
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.330
So probably we're take a quick shortcut to
get it to work, and it will go from there.

57
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.428
So what we wanna do is import,

58
00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.032
&gt;&gt; Scott: From, let's do connect react,

59
00:03:49.772 --> 00:03:51.552
&gt;&gt; Scott: redux, there we go.

60
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.100
And then all we have to do now is the
point of redux is like now this component

61
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.230
like hey redux this is
the state that I want.

62
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.130
And when it changes, I want you to
rerender or render my render function.

63
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.460
So in a state that I want to describe
when it changes, call render again.

64
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.490
So all the status is updated.

65
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.920
Does that make sense?

66
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.710
So what that looks like is this.

67
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.360
So instead of binding to like
this local state, this post here.

68
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.010
What we're going to do is we're going
to have redux store this post for us.

69
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.230
And we're going to get it from redux
from as a prop, a property coming in.

70
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.766
And then all we have to do is we're
going to take this function right here.

71
00:04:31.766 --> 00:04:35.740
And we're going to actually use that
we're going to create an action instead.

72
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.338
And that action is going to go ahead and
change the state for

73
00:04:39.338 --> 00:04:42.215
us in the post is going
to pass on as a property.

74
00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:46.950
&gt;&gt; Scott: It's kind of harder than
you are so the way it works is right.

75
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.930
You're inside of a component and
it's like I need some post and reddit.

76
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.070
So what you do is you click a button.

77
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.652
That button fires off an action.

78
00:04:54.652 --> 00:04:59.686
That action is nothing but
object that has a type which is this.

79
00:04:59.686 --> 00:05:01.660
You know fire of action as a type and

80
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.969
then when action is fired
is dispatched by reddits.

81
00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:09.130
Reddit is going to start running
all the reducer functions.

82
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.160
So the reducer functions
come in like okay,

83
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.540
you dispatched something of type fetch
post complete says no come I am I okay.

84
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.140
Execute this and
what this is is hey just take the payload

85
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.470
property of the action that you dispatched
and make that be the new state.

86
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.870
And that's going to the new state for
Reddit.

87
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.800
So now all we've got to do inside
the read a component is described to

88
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.120
the Reddit State.

89
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.089
So there are the state changes by
an action to Reddit component re renders.

90
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.190
You see that it's like a unit
directional data flow you fire it goes

91
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.760
all the way up and then comes right down.

92
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.370
It was always the reduction it comes right
down versus right now it's just a local

93
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.650
it's stuck inside here.

94
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.390
It's like yup it's back and forth.

95
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.830
Whereas with a redux is going to go
out go to redux go there reducer and

96
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.010
come back down to the properties
to the pair of components.
