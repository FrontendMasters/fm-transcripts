00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.975
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:05.784
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So
the first thing we need to do,

3
00:00:05.784 --> 00:00:09.067
is we need to actually create
an action type, an action and

4
00:00:09.067 --> 00:00:13.625
we need to make sure the state and the
reducer's gonna handle it appropriately.

5
00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:16.520
So let's go ahead and
we'll create an action type.

6
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.590
So all ready have one right
here called ADD_EXERCISE.

7
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.213
So we'll just use that one, you can use
whatever action you want I'm going just

8
00:00:24.213 --> 00:00:27.600
gonna use ADD_EXERCISE, cuz that's what
we're doing, we're adding an exercise.

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.140
So I'll say ADD_EXERCISE that's gonna
be our type and then I'll go and

10
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.720
make sure we actually have an action for
it.

11
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.690
So right here we'll create an action for
that.

12
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.150
So I'll say export const I'll give
it the same name addExercise.

13
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.280
I spelled it right.

14
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.840
And that's just gonna take an exercise and
you know what it's going to do.

15
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.620
It's just going to return a new action,
so we'll say create action

16
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.670
of the types .ADD_EXERCISE and

17
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.940
the payload is going to be the exercise.

18
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.380
How many times am I gonna say that?

19
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.500
I sound like Michelle Obama, telling
everybody to exercise, there we go.

20
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.845
Cool, so there's our action creator.

21
00:01:13.845 --> 00:01:18.135
This is gonna return this great action
that takes the type ADD_EXERCISE with

22
00:01:18.135 --> 00:01:20.251
the exercise as the payload, sweet.

23
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:21.719
So now we need to hook this up.

24
00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.508
Actually let's double check our reducers
and of make sure it's gonna handle that.

25
00:01:25.508 --> 00:01:29.039
So let's check the current work out and,
actually I'm not even handling it.

26
00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.340
I'm only handling ADD_EXERCISE_COMPLETE.

27
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.350
So let's just change this over
to ADD_EXERCISE right quick.

28
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.621
There we go, so
that's got to be ADD_EXERCISE.

29
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:38.232
And all we're doing is,

30
00:01:38.232 --> 00:01:43.020
we're spending over the original state
with the new exercise at the end.

31
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.720
If you want you can pop it
to the front if you want,

32
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.190
if you want to put this
on top of the list.

33
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.120
It's totally up to you.

34
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.155
Let's put on the top so we can see it,

35
00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:54.713
there we go.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Any questions so

36
00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:55.529
far about what we did?

37
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.830
So we have an action type ADD_EXERCISE.

38
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.770
We created an action for

39
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.150
that that dispatches an exercise and then
we made sure our current workout reducer

40
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.260
which is the state that we want to
add to has a case to handle that.

41
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.502
Follow me so far?

42
00:02:13.502 --> 00:02:17.470
All right, so next thing we wanna do is
head over to our container that has all

43
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.818
this stuff hooked up,
which is the CurrentWorkout container.

44
00:02:20.818 --> 00:02:23.675
The CurrentWorkout container is
the parent of the Exercise modals.

45
00:02:23.675 --> 00:02:26.147
This is where we're going to
get the state and the actions.

46
00:02:26.147 --> 00:02:28.482
So we head up to where we
are getting the state.

47
00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:34.583
So mapStatesToProps, and
we already have exercises there.

48
00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:38.004
So we're good to go.

49
00:02:38.004 --> 00:02:42.392
currentWorkOut, I don't think
we need that right now, but

50
00:02:42.392 --> 00:02:47.308
what we do need is to add a new
action here to the mapActionsToProps.

51
00:02:47.308 --> 00:02:49.054
And we'll call this,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [COUGH]

52
00:02:49.054 --> 00:02:51.341
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Bless you, addExercise,

53
00:02:51.341 --> 00:02:54.528
and it's gonna take in the exercise.

54
00:02:54.528 --> 00:02:56.154
And what is it gonna do?

55
00:02:56.154 --> 00:03:01.354
It's gonna return dispatch and
we need to bring in that

56
00:03:01.354 --> 00:03:07.134
function which is called
addExercise from actions action.

57
00:03:07.134 --> 00:03:12.135
It's going to dispatch that
function with the given exercise.

58
00:03:17.366 --> 00:03:18.245
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right, so

59
00:03:18.245 --> 00:03:22.352
dispatch this function with the given
exercise which is just gonna

60
00:03:22.352 --> 00:03:23.538
return an action.

61
00:03:23.538 --> 00:03:28.158
With a type of ADD_EXERCISE with a payload
of the given exercise which is going

62
00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:31.315
to run the reducer which is
going to update the state.

63
00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:37.970
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, so we've got that.

64
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.241
We've got the exercises here and
we just need to add the action here.

65
00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:49.010
So addExercise and we're just
gonna say this.ppops.addExercise.

66
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.336
There we go.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So we pass that in,

67
00:03:57.336 --> 00:04:01.305
everything's wired up from Redux all
the way to here, so all that's good.

68
00:04:01.305 --> 00:04:04.139
All we do now is actually
called this method on a tab.

69
00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.659
So we head over to the Workout or
the Exercise

70
00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.558
modal which is where we
pass in addExercise to.

71
00:04:13.558 --> 00:04:18.068
If we head over to the modal, we actually
abstracted out the actual ListView

72
00:04:18.068 --> 00:04:21.104
through another component
called ExerciseList.

73
00:04:21.104 --> 00:04:22.288
And here's a short cut.

74
00:04:22.288 --> 00:04:25.748
What this means is I wanna take all
the props of this component and

75
00:04:25.748 --> 00:04:27.600
pass it on to this component.

76
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.630
That way I don't have to like one for
one name them.

77
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.090
So just spread all the props here.

78
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.196
Whatever props this has,
I want this to have to.

79
00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:38.610
That doesn't mean you have to use them,
doesn't mean you have them, right.

80
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.430
And so now because this has a property
called addExercise, so does this one.

81
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.784
So we head over to ExerciseList,

82
00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:50.840
which is our ListView with our search
bar and all the stuff that we made.

83
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.705
This is the road that's gonna be
rendered for the exercises, and

84
00:04:55.705 --> 00:04:57.308
let's just look at that right quick.

85
00:04:57.308 --> 00:05:04.405
So if I say I, O still have that,
where is that at?

86
00:05:04.405 --> 00:05:09.610
Where am I doing that?
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I'm

87
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.039
doing that in currentWorkout,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah I'm

88
00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:17.227
doing that right there.

89
00:05:17.227 --> 00:05:22.467
That's next lesson.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool,

90
00:05:22.467 --> 00:05:24.855
so if we click add some exercises.

91
00:05:29.244 --> 00:05:32.247
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Is the debugger open?

92
00:05:36.154 --> 00:05:38.305
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay.

93
00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:40.920
Let's reload it right quick.

94
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.810
There we go.

95
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.161
There we go.
Go away.

96
00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:45.420
There we go.

97
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.452
So now if we type if we say like
flat dumbbell bench or whatever.

98
00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:55.108
This fuzzy search returns
all the exercises.

99
00:05:55.108 --> 00:05:56.202
So these are the exercises.

100
00:05:56.202 --> 00:05:58.694
This is the result of that
fuzzy search that I created.

101
00:05:58.694 --> 00:06:01.380
So if we click on it,

102
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.260
what we want to be able to do is
have this add to our exercises.

103
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.230
And right now it's not doing anything,
we can't really click on anything.

104
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.996
Nothing's actually happening.

105
00:06:09.996 --> 00:06:12.384
We can click this X and it'll close, but

106
00:06:12.384 --> 00:06:17.106
we wanna be able to click on the exercise
and have it add to our list of exercises.

107
00:06:17.106 --> 00:06:19.799
So what we need to do is in our

108
00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:25.208
lists,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Around

109
00:06:25.208 --> 00:06:28.562
the View right here that's being rendered.

110
00:06:28.562 --> 00:06:33.602
So again if I start typing,
again if I say like squat or

111
00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:39.685
squat I know that's there,
maybe it's not there, whatever.

112
00:06:39.685 --> 00:06:45.464
So each one of these is this
code right here, is this view.

113
00:06:45.464 --> 00:06:47.705
So when I tap on this view,
I wanna be able to add exercise.

114
00:06:47.705 --> 00:06:54.079
So what I'm gonna do is just wrap
this inside of TouchableOpacity.

115
00:06:54.079 --> 00:07:00.837
There we go, we'll do that.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So

116
00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:03.814
wrap those in a TouchableOpacity.

117
00:07:03.814 --> 00:07:08.354
Or actually let's do a touchable without
feedback which means it's like a button

118
00:07:08.354 --> 00:07:12.716
but there's like no visual feedback on
it at all, because this is a list item.

119
00:07:12.716 --> 00:07:21.957
So we'll do that instead.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go.

120
00:07:21.957 --> 00:07:24.694
And then on press,
what method do I want to run onPress?

121
00:07:29.245 --> 00:07:30.966
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Anybody know?

122
00:07:30.966 --> 00:07:33.706
So what method is passed in-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [INAUDIBLE],

123
00:07:33.706 --> 00:07:38.243
createExercises or addExercise?
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: addExercise, yeah.

124
00:07:38.243 --> 00:07:44.138
So it's gonna be this.props.addExercise,
yep,

125
00:07:44.138 --> 00:07:50.280
so.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go.

126
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.670
So we'll say this.props.addExercise which
is gonna add the exercise to it but

127
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:59.150
that's really not gonna be any help to us
because the modal's still gonna be up and

128
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.690
this is still gonna be there.

129
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.100
But it will add it the exercise but

130
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.500
we won't see any visual
clues of that happening.

131
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.712
So what we really want to do is
not onPpress is just do this.

132
00:08:09.712 --> 00:08:13.003
We wanna abstract this out and
call a method that we have instead.

133
00:08:13.003 --> 00:08:22.709
We'll call this.handle.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: handlePress.

134
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:28.663
So we'll call it handlePress which
needs access to the current exercise.

135
00:08:28.663 --> 00:08:33.480
So it'll invoke an anonymous
function here which

136
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.961
gets access to the exercise
that we tapped on.

137
00:08:37.961 --> 00:08:42.511
And we'll say handlePress.call(this).

138
00:08:42.511 --> 00:08:45.098
And we'll pass in the exercise.

139
00:08:45.098 --> 00:08:54.134
So now we need to make handlePress
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Which

140
00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:56.429
is gonna get the exercise.

141
00:08:56.429 --> 00:08:59.477
And then what we want to do
is now we'll call this.props

142
00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:06.480
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: .addExercise with the given

143
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:12.503
exercise and
then we'll also say this.props.closeModal.

144
00:09:12.503 --> 00:09:13.460
So close the modal too.

145
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.190
So that's why we added this extra method
because we want to close the modal,

146
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.980
which is gonna bring us back to our
currentWorkout which we will then populate

147
00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.340
with the currentWorkout.

148
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.531
So we'll save that.

149
00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:30.865
We'll get rid of this person and
now we just need to make sure

150
00:09:30.865 --> 00:09:36.860
our addExercises is gonna be
subscribing to that state.

151
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:41.571
So when we addExercise to
the currentWorkout it will

152
00:09:41.571 --> 00:09:43.610
populate here right.

153
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:50.445
So we head back over to the ExerciseModal,
we have this.

154
00:09:50.445 --> 00:09:55.059
Right no.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Is it ExerciseList?

155
00:09:55.059 --> 00:09:55.898
Yeah there we go.

156
00:09:55.898 --> 00:09:58.533
So right here.

157
00:09:58.533 --> 00:09:59.714
Actually no not this one.

158
00:09:59.714 --> 00:10:02.760
What we want is the WorkoutList,
there we go.

159
00:10:05.078 --> 00:10:08.816
So the WorkoutList is actually just gonna
be if we go look in currentWorkout is what

160
00:10:08.816 --> 00:10:12.025
we made whenever we made the workout
list and we're going to get to it.

161
00:10:12.025 --> 00:10:13.562
So this is the WorkoutList.

162
00:10:13.562 --> 00:10:14.720
It's this right here.

163
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.580
It's the add some exercises,
just with a plus.

164
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.610
And it has a SetModalVisibility
with the current workout.

165
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.940
We added that on the last walkthrough.

166
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.451
But this is actually what
it really looks like.

167
00:10:25.451 --> 00:10:27.000
It itself is just a ListView.

168
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:33.902
It's just a list for you that is gonna
iterate over the currentWorkout array.

169
00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.020
And then it has a footer, which is this.

170
00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.190
This is the footer right here, so
this is always on the list for you.

171
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.130
Regardless if there's anything in
the list or not, this adds some

172
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:47.640
exercise with a plus will always be there,
because I rendered it as a static foot.

173
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.150
So it'll always be there.

174
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:54.962
But if we do have workouts it'll render
them with this View right here renderRow.

175
00:10:54.962 --> 00:10:57.570
So styles.workoutText, exercise.name.

176
00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.680
So now I'm gonna add our exercise, we
should actually see it pop up right here.

177
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:07.215
So if I say bench I click that,

178
00:11:07.215 --> 00:11:13.827
looks like it added something there we go.

179
00:11:13.827 --> 00:11:19.440
But it didn't actually add in the name.

180
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.220
Let's try that again,
let's see what's happening.

181
00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.824
So let's add in another one, lunges, cool.

182
00:11:25.824 --> 00:11:26.963
So it's adding something.

183
00:11:26.963 --> 00:11:30.010
It looks like I just got
the properties mixed up.

184
00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:31.646
So let's do the debugger right quick.

185
00:11:31.646 --> 00:11:32.745
Any questions so far?

186
00:11:32.745 --> 00:11:34.380
This code right here we didn't talk about.

187
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.497
Because I wanna get to async and
we're getting close on time and

188
00:11:39.497 --> 00:11:44.680
it's literally the same thing as the
ExerciseList just with different styles.

189
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.340
So it's not a new concept but anything
about like the actions and Redux and

190
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.514
stuff cuz now we're about
to convert it to async.

191
00:11:52.514 --> 00:11:55.138
And it's just an extra
step on top of this.

192
00:12:03.419 --> 00:12:04.908
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It's crazy how much

193
00:12:04.908 --> 00:12:08.506
I use a debugger in React Native but
never in web.

194
00:12:08.506 --> 00:12:13.330
Maybe now I'll use it in web,
no I'm still not

195
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:18.648
gonna use it.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right.

196
00:12:18.648 --> 00:12:22.926
So let's go into our reducers which is if
that fires you know everything is good.

197
00:12:22.926 --> 00:12:27.558
So currentWorkout should
get updated rate here.

198
00:12:27.558 --> 00:12:28.850
So let's check it out.

199
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.240
So if we look,
now we just hit a breakpoint right here.

200
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.384
We should see currentWorkout get updated,

201
00:12:38.384 --> 00:12:43.213
so.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay,

202
00:12:43.213 --> 00:12:47.425
paused, if you go look, yup.

203
00:12:47.425 --> 00:12:48.980
There it is.

204
00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:53.700
So the payload is something different.

205
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.677
That's why it's freaking out.

206
00:12:54.677 --> 00:12:57.635
It's not, I don't even know what that is,
what is that?

207
00:12:57.635 --> 00:13:03.463
What, I have no idea what that is?

208
00:13:03.463 --> 00:13:06.905
All right, so what we wanna do instead,

209
00:13:06.905 --> 00:13:09.845
I think I know why, I know why.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Are you not

210
00:13:09.845 --> 00:13:12.474
passing in your action?
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I think I actually passed

211
00:13:12.474 --> 00:13:13.913
in an event on the tab.

212
00:13:13.913 --> 00:13:16.750
That's what I did,
that looked like an event.

213
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:21.390
So if you go back to
the ExerciseList down here,

214
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:25.567
this right here I grabbed the wrong thing.

215
00:13:25.567 --> 00:13:27.270
I put exercise.

216
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:32.461
That's the event from this press.

217
00:13:32.461 --> 00:13:33.506
That's what that was.

218
00:13:33.506 --> 00:13:36.730
I want this exercise from the renderRow.

219
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.310
So now it'll work.

220
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.859
That's why it was freaking out.

221
00:13:41.859 --> 00:13:47.506
So let's just refresh this.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay and

222
00:13:47.506 --> 00:13:50.697
take off those there we go.

223
00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:58.141
So now if you do this.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go lunges.

224
00:13:59.888 --> 00:14:09.560
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And flat barbell bench.

225
00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.610
So there are exercise that we added and
this is always gonna be on the footer.

226
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.190
So now what we're gonna do is we're
gonna convert this over to async.

227
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.920
But I'm gonna show you how
to do this in the Todo app

228
00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.110
because I'll show you here then it will
be done and there's no fun in that.

229
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.380
So let's do this in the Todo app.

230
00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.190
Any questions on this?

231
00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:30.355
No, all right let me
push this up real quick.

232
00:14:30.355 --> 00:14:34.677
Man, so let me put this in on my pocket.

233
00:14:34.677 --> 00:14:38.474
There we go, so

234
00:14:38.474 --> 00:14:44.024
git add- b we'll call

235
00:14:44.024 --> 00:14:48.708
this list-view.

236
00:14:51.982 --> 00:14:53.293
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: solution.

237
00:15:07.864 --> 00:15:09.188
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go.

238
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.962
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, okay, so

239
00:15:21.962 --> 00:15:25.180
now we're gonna do some async stuff.
