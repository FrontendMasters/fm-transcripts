1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.746
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.746 --> 00:00:07.340
&gt;&gt; Scott: Was everybody able to convert
the web app over to a native app?

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.180
Yeah, some small things?

4
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.450
Or is anybody confused on?

5
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.380
And maybe you didn't finish, but maybe you
were confused on what had to be done or

6
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.750
some bugs or anything like that.

7
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.839
Anybody, any blockers?

8
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, passing, value of
text input to this starts to ask I just

9
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.710
because getting a no that's
the no is not an object

10
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.790
this not status task but it seemed
pretty some like as far as transferring.

11
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.290
&gt;&gt; Scott: I think you forgot to
do the binding on the method,

12
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.240
because I said this is an old
saw it as a foreign see that

13
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.350
this context which doesn't belong to
the component, is part of the binding.

14
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.430
That's what it sounds like.

15
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.890
But with this next one you go to figure
out real quick what was wrong with it?

16
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.519
Any other blockers?

17
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I was just
trying to get myself setup for

18
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.610
Android side of development and
I got at least running.

19
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.790
But how do you make your refresh
after you change your code?

20
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.090
&gt;&gt; Scott: Thatâ€™s what
we're about to talk about.

21
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yep.

22
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I was just wrestling layout.

23
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.430
&gt;&gt; Scott: Is it a layout tough?

24
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah.

25
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I tried to move
the todo class into another file.

26
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.501
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: And it's like, [SOUND].

27
00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:24.510
&gt;&gt; Scott: It blew up?

28
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.800
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Scott: [LAUGH] All right, so

29
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.260
I'll make sure I do that on the solution,
then.

30
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.970
Okay, any other blockers
before I get into it?

31
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.680
No?
Okay, cool.

32
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.920
So we will just live code this.

33
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.450
So what I'll do is,

34
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.643
I'm just going to reset my Android to
be exactly what the iOS is right now.

35
00:01:43.643 --> 00:01:47.051
There we go.

36
00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:50.484
There we go.

37
00:01:50.484 --> 00:01:55.100
And, wait, how did it know it was?

38
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.130
How did it do that?
Wait does that say Android?

39
00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.060
They both say Android, okay.

40
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.010
I will say what okay so now what we do is
we'll go through the go this illusion but

41
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.010
I'm gonna make it so
that it works on both platforms.

42
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.740
So I'm just putting it instead of putting
an index I enjoyed and in exile as you

43
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.610
know separate I'm going to make a new fall
inside a source make a new folder here.

44
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.358
Call app and we'll put.

45
00:02:19.358 --> 00:02:23.900
To do .js just like we did on the web.

46
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.510
So we got that.

47
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.830
So protip,
you always have to import react.

48
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.823
That's top of your file even
though we're not using it for

49
00:02:34.823 --> 00:02:38.880
this not global so react, from react.

50
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.650
And then some of the elements
that we're going to use.

51
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.829
From react native which include the View,
the Text,

52
00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:53.779
the TextInput,
&gt;&gt; Scott: And also do TouchableOpacity,

53
00:02:58.962 --> 00:03:03.820
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go, from react Native.

54
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.450
There we go.
And then we're going to go to export

55
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.330
a class called

56
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.350
todo that extends component.

57
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.400
I don't know why I keep
typing in the [INAUDIBLE].

58
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.020
There we go.
And then what we're going to do is go

59
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.310
ahead and
set up the render method right quick.

60
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.990
So we can just make sure it's actually
rendering and we'll just return

61
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.710
a text, that says hello, so there we go.

62
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.970
So we got hello here,
if we head back over to Android I

63
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.850
could just get rid of pretty much
all of this except for app registry.

64
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.554
And I want to do is import, from,
we want to import our to do,

65
00:03:51.554 --> 00:03:59.760
from source slash app,slash to do so
we have us to do here.

66
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.310
And this is not going to be
caught to do any more,cause

67
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.990
it already have been called to do so
this group and post it is going to call.

68
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.120
I'm going to call it me.

69
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.214
And then inside of Main,
all you want to do

70
00:04:14.214 --> 00:04:19.280
is just return todo that looks like this.

71
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.500
Because it's just self-closing, so
we're just going to just put that there.

72
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.540
Yeah, I know you can't find stylesheet.

73
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.890
I know I took you out.

74
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.390
Okay.

75
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.410
I'll put you back I'll put style sheet
back cuz it's using it for styles.

76
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.770
Great so that's what we have there and
then I'm also just gonna go ahead and do,

77
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.440
I'm gonna copy this the exact same
code and place it in iOS one too.

78
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You didn't change
the registry, registry component.

79
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.346
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah and
I didn't change the registry component.

80
00:04:46.346 --> 00:04:49.426
To main,

81
00:04:49.426 --> 00:04:55.210
also an Android.

82
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.290
There we go, great.

83
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.630
And actually because this is literally
just doing, this returning this.

84
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.259
We don't even need to do this.

85
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.400
We can just and react now you can do this
you gonna say constant equals function,

86
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.040
is a stateless function and
it's just got to return to do.

87
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.010
We get to do that now
work exactly the same,

88
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.820
cause you are not doing
anything there was a shortcut.

89
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.870
Probably should just wrap that so
it's not, there we go.

90
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.190
So we could just do that and

91
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:39.120
I was going to go back to my
app todo here, there we go.

92
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.680
So todo app still works.

93
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.130
We still get this warning here.

94
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.520
Actually this is a refresh.

95
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.720
So if you want to do a refresh we're
gonna get into this at the dissolution.

96
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.870
And you just need to bring up
the developer menu and Android emulator.

97
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.340
There's a button down here,

98
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.670
little arrow you can click that and you
can hit the settings button right here,

99
00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.350
the hardware settings button and
that's gonna bring up this developer menu.

100
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.660
And you can just hit reload.

101
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.510
And it'll reload and
there we go we have hello to do that.

102
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.190
I just made and I last you had
that you can shake your computer.

103
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.290
No it's a computer you can shake
your phone with command D.

104
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:20.670
Or there is at the top you can
go to the hardware sake and

105
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.000
it will bring up the menu as well you
can type really you can hit reload.

106
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.180
There's also a shortcut for

107
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.040
reload which I think iOS is actually
just come in are, to reload.

108
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.980
And Android depending on what you're
using the motion or whatever,

109
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.000
and see if you command him.

110
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.046
No, no that doesn't work.

111
00:06:37.046 --> 00:06:39.850
I don't know the shortcut for Android,
I just come in here and reload.
