00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.964
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.964 --> 00:00:07.060
&gt;&gt; Scott: So we head over to
the Reddit stuff right here.

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.350
What we can do is, where we're passing
this null here, you can pass in another

4
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.840
function that will map actions to
the properties that we can call, so

5
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.660
let's do that.

6
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.786
So we'll say, const map.

7
00:00:23.987 --> 00:00:27.577
&gt;&gt; Scott: Action to props,
and we'll do that.

8
00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:31.215
And what we'll do is we'll get access
to this thing called dispatch,

9
00:00:31.215 --> 00:00:33.200
which is how we can dispatch actions.

10
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.545
And we just need to return an object here,
and

11
00:00:36.545 --> 00:00:41.068
we'll create an action called add,
&gt;&gt; Scott: Reddit.

12
00:00:41.068 --> 00:00:46.391
addRedditPost.

13
00:00:46.391 --> 00:00:51.210
And what that's going to do is it's going
to be a function that takes in a post.

14
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.150
And all it's going to do
is dispatch an action,

15
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.950
we'll just write the action
in line right here.

16
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.490
So the type, we need to give it a type.

17
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.040
So if we go over to our reducers.

18
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.340
We'll just make another
one called const ADD_POST.

19
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.550
And we'll say ADD_POST.

20
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.707
So we'll have that.

21
00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:14.680
And we'll export it.

22
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.548
We'll import that type.

23
00:01:19.548 --> 00:01:20.830
All it is is a constant.

24
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.540
So you wanna keep those
constants the same.

25
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.470
Otherwise you'll run into some stuff
like why is that not reducing?

26
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.163
Or something like that.

27
00:01:29.163 --> 00:01:31.490
So ADD_POST.

28
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.875
Oops, not from ADD_POST.

29
00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:39.320
[LAUGH] From reducers.

30
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.203
There we go.
So ADD_POST from reducers, and

31
00:01:42.203 --> 00:01:44.236
now the type is ADD_POST.

32
00:01:47.593 --> 00:01:48.358
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go.
And

33
00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:52.950
then the payload is going to
be the POST that we sent in.

34
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.000
So we'll say post.

35
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.192
In this case, we'll just go ahead and
hard code one,

36
00:01:56.192 --> 00:01:58.480
because we have a stateless component.

37
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.290
I don't wanna change it to do that.

38
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.966
So we'll just hard code this POST to be,

39
00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:07.544
we'll just set a default one right here,
like name: 'new post'.

40
00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:10.690
That's what we'll do, cool.

41
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.450
So we'll do that.

42
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.441
So the payload is Post, dispatch in that.

43
00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:14.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You have a typo.

44
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.860
&gt;&gt; Scott: Where at?

45
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.944
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: AddRedditPost.

46
00:02:16.944 --> 00:02:18.549
&gt;&gt; Scott: Thank you.

47
00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.810
So now we have,
on this props in this view right here,

48
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.842
we also have props.addRedditPost,

49
00:02:25.842 --> 00:02:30.483
which is going to dispatch
this action called ADD_POST,

50
00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:34.910
with the payload of an object
with a name on it, right?

51
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.449
So now what we gotta do is inside
of our reducers, is listen for

52
00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:40.730
this action to happen, so ADD_POST.

53
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.700
Let's get rid of this stuff.

54
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.242
We'll listen for
that action to happen, and we'll

55
00:02:46.242 --> 00:02:51.660
say when that action happens
it's going to be a new post.

56
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.520
We just want to go ahead update
our state with a new post.

57
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.940
So what we do is we'll say, all right,

58
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.230
now just return a new array
with the state in it.

59
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.059
The old state that's already in it, plus
the new post which is payload., I'm sorry,

60
00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:07.182
action.payload.

61
00:03:07.182 --> 00:03:09.929
You see that?

62
00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:12.648
This is almost like what
we did with the todos,

63
00:03:12.648 --> 00:03:15.738
where we created a new array
before we did set state.

64
00:03:15.738 --> 00:03:19.963
It's the same thing,
as if I'm grabbing the original state,

65
00:03:19.963 --> 00:03:23.959
actually I should just put this
at the top, and doing that.

66
00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.630
And then we need a default.

67
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.716
Cool, so that's the ADD_POST.

68
00:03:29.716 --> 00:03:31.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [INAUDIBLE]
comma [INAUDIBLE].

69
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.637
&gt;&gt; Scott: Comma, there we go, there we go.

70
00:03:33.637 --> 00:03:34.137
Thank you.

71
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.753
Sweet, so now we head back over here.

72
00:03:37.753 --> 00:03:38.885
This is being dispatched.

73
00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:42.830
All we have to do is just like
add a button that does that.

74
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.303
Touchable opacity.

75
00:03:52.964 --> 00:03:56.570
&gt;&gt; Scott: And we'll say add, or text.

76
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.292
Add.

77
00:04:06.515 --> 00:04:14.308
&gt;&gt; Scott: And onPress, It's just
going to say props.addRedditPost.

78
00:04:14.308 --> 00:04:17.970
And we're not gonna pass anything in,
cuz the default's that one that we had.

79
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.630
So there we go.

80
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.041
We'll just do that, and
then we'll refresh this.

81
00:04:25.487 --> 00:04:28.900
&gt;&gt; Scott: Reducers three,
looks like I got an error.

82
00:04:31.998 --> 00:04:32.508
Yeah I guess I need that.

83
00:04:39.385 --> 00:04:44.040
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go.
All right, so now we have this button Add.

84
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:50.199
If we click it,
looks like we had something go wrong.

85
00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.938
Now let's just do a debugger here and see.

86
00:05:08.761 --> 00:05:10.731
&gt;&gt; Scott: So
if we come in here into our reducer,

87
00:05:10.731 --> 00:05:13.360
you can see what's happening here.

88
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.130
Let's just reduce, or I said reduce.

89
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:22.020
Let's just break,
&gt;&gt; Scott: Up here.

90
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.790
Not here, but here.

91
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.860
Cool, there we go.

92
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.360
So we'll break there.

93
00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.680
&gt;&gt; Scott: Okay, you're fine, there we go.

94
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.180
Now we'll just refresh this.

95
00:05:37.615 --> 00:05:40.303
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go, and
then we'll click this again, and

96
00:05:40.303 --> 00:05:41.561
we'll see if it broke.

97
00:05:45.358 --> 00:05:50.245
&gt;&gt; Scott: Nope, so it didn't get here,
and, I think I know I why.

98
00:05:50.245 --> 00:05:56.750
It's because we forgot
to add it to down here.

99
00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.880
So we got to get rid of this null and
say, map actions to props.

100
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.380
There we go.

101
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:10.150
Now if we refresh and we say add,
it looks like it broke this time.

102
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.170
Yeah, so great thing I have this debugger.

103
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.330
So look, when I clicked Add,
it fired off that action.

104
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.490
The action came right into this reducer,
and hit the case of ADD_POST.

105
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:27.327
And that's because if we go look at that
action, it's just a payload and type.

106
00:06:27.327 --> 00:06:30.147
It's the exact same
thing that we fired off,

107
00:06:32.768 --> 00:06:36.010
&gt;&gt; Scott: Here, the payload and the type.

108
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.807
That's the action that came in.

109
00:06:36.807 --> 00:06:39.766
And then we have that reducer that
does a switch statement on the type.

110
00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:44.990
And when it sees it, it's just gonna grab
this payload and add it to the state.

111
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.987
And it's going to send it back down,
and then that state,

112
00:06:47.987 --> 00:06:50.924
which we're subscribing to
here is going to be updated,

113
00:06:50.924 --> 00:06:53.760
which causes this to re-render,
with the new state.

114
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.452
Whenever the props change, or
whenever we call this.set state in React,

115
00:06:58.452 --> 00:06:59.188
it re-renders.

116
00:06:59.188 --> 00:07:00.730
And the props changed here.

117
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:08.152
So now if we just hit play,
we should see the other one.

118
00:07:08.152 --> 00:07:11.183
Okay, I think I got to get rid
of that pause, it's killing us.

119
00:07:11.183 --> 00:07:13.183
Go.

120
00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:16.621
There we go.

121
00:07:16.621 --> 00:07:17.734
All right.

122
00:07:17.734 --> 00:07:18.717
Now let's refresh this.

123
00:07:18.717 --> 00:07:24.974
There we go, it added it, but
for some reason we can't see it.

124
00:07:24.974 --> 00:07:25.922
It's like there.

125
00:07:25.922 --> 00:07:27.170
I saw it bump down.

126
00:07:34.404 --> 00:07:39.470
&gt;&gt; Scott: I don't know where it went,
but it added it there somewhere.

127
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.550
Anyway, it's still adding it,
like invisible somewhere.

128
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.158
Don't like debugging that though,
that will take all day.

129
00:07:49.158 --> 00:07:53.900
All right, any questions on a Redux?

130
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.125
This is your time.

131
00:07:55.125 --> 00:07:59.070
We just went through a lot of Redux.

132
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.140
And I was trying to skip a lot
of stuff because we're actually

133
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.220
going to more advanced stuff tomorrow,
where I get more in depth on it.

134
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.011
This is just more like,
hey this is the intro to Redux.

135
00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:09.300
We are actually really going to
get really hard into it tomorrow.
