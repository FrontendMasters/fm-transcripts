00:00:04.036 --> 00:00:05.110
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Now we're gonna convert.

3
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.340
The reason we did that,
cuz I wanted to refresh you on React.

4
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.140
And I wanted to show you how simple it
is and how to compare it to a web app or

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.610
a native app.

6
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.472
So now we're gonna talk about the
foundational components in React Native.

7
00:00:18.472 --> 00:00:21.243
So there's tons of them that
React Native provides and

8
00:00:21.243 --> 00:00:25.850
then there's tons that other people
made or you probably made yourself.

9
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.323
Some are JavaScript implementations,
some are actual native UI things,

10
00:00:30.323 --> 00:00:34.441
but some of the foundational ones
that you'll see in React Native and

11
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:38.760
that you'll probably use a lot is View,
with a capital V here.

12
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.177
And almost all the components
are capitalized like that, so

13
00:00:42.177 --> 00:00:44.932
you see View which is
equivalent to a div in HTML.

14
00:00:44.932 --> 00:00:47.848
It's not the same thing,
you pretty much have to use the View for

15
00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:51.430
almost everything, whereas a div you
don't have to use a div for everything.

16
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.094
But it's pretty much the equivalent.

17
00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:56.642
It's like a container element that we're
gonna use for the rest of our page.

18
00:00:56.642 --> 00:00:59.215
It's just a view,
that's why they call it View.

19
00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:00.810
So that's the equivalent of that.

20
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.783
Text is the equivalent of all the text
elements you would use, so like H1s,

21
00:01:05.783 --> 00:01:08.358
all the header elements, ps, aside.

22
00:01:08.358 --> 00:01:10.859
All the text elements you would use,

23
00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:15.790
that's when you would actually use
the Text component in React Native.

24
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.133
And then you have TextInput,

25
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:23.025
which is equivalent to input.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then TouchableHighlight

26
00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:26.611
and all the other touchable
components that are in React Native.

27
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:30.790
This is gonna be equivalent to things that
you click on or tap on, so like a button,

28
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.618
anchor tag or something like that.

29
00:01:32.618 --> 00:01:35.483
Something that you click on and
and have some interaction,

30
00:01:35.483 --> 00:01:38.189
that's gonna be a TouchableHighlight or
a touchable.

31
00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.556
And there's so many other ones,
but that's the main one.

32
00:01:42.556 --> 00:01:44.653
So all this doesn't really
make sense right now, but

33
00:01:44.653 --> 00:01:46.290
you're gonna see this stuff in a minute.
