[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:08.524
&gt;&gt; Scott: What I want to do for
a quick exercise is apply a gradient

3
00:00:08.524 --> 00:00:13.760
to the welcome page and
also the current workout page.

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.850
We will use the same gradient cuz it's
a color picker and to the colors but

5
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.360
I minimum do that and then for
extra credit, there is a react native

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.810
vector icons plugin,
if you just Google, you'll find it.

7
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.290
Use the icons for
this plus button right here, and

8
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.170
that the icon plugin is also a native UI,
it's not just JavaScript.

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.890
Yes.

10
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.350
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Question from
the chat room off topic.

11
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.600
What is the difference between
importing react versus component?

12
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.845
In the import statement above you got
components in the braces and run.

13
00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:49.700
&gt;&gt; Scott: Right.
So the difference is, so

14
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.380
this React module right here,
with a string right here,

15
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.810
it exports a default whose
value we're calling Reacts.

16
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.270
But it also exports a named
export called component.

17
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.310
So that's the difference.

18
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.430
So we're importing the default export and
naming it reacts.

19
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.050
And then were also importing a named
export, what the name of component.

20
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.820
So it's just like right here we have
this named export called _Todo.

21
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.210
We could also export a default.

22
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.973
Like Indie objects or whatever.

23
00:01:28.967 --> 00:01:31.210
&gt;&gt; Scott: And then yeah,
they can import that whatever they want.

24
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.730
So that's all that is.

25
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.350
Giving the default name it that and
give me this name export.

26
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.880
Cool, so yeah but the gradients on there.

27
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.890
If you look.
I'll just show you because there's like

28
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.070
actually two icons of was what they're
specifically what I want you to look at.

29
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.670
React native vector icons,
this is the one.

30
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Jesse's one step ahead and
already did this.

31
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.110
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah.

32
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: He built the menu
with the criteria icon.

33
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.330
&gt;&gt; Scott: Nice,
that's what I'm talking about.

34
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.697
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: He posted it 11 minutes ago.

35
00:02:00.697 --> 00:02:06.423
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Scott: That's what I'm talking about.

36
00:02:06.423 --> 00:02:11.230
So yeah, use this, follow the same step to
link it, and then you can use whatever.

37
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.902
This was really cool because it actually
like includes like every icon package that

38
00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.045
you've ever used.

39
00:02:17.045 --> 00:02:23.917
Material icons- [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

40
00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:27.306
&gt;&gt; Scott: Probably [LAUGH].

41
00:02:27.306 --> 00:02:28.726
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Well,
that's a great thing about native.

42
00:02:28.726 --> 00:02:30.020
&gt;&gt; Scott: Well that's
a good thing about native.

43
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.320
Whatever it's all a device
right talking to the Internet.

44
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah it include it all.

45
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.980
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah.
They're gonna download

46
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.050
it from the App Store anyway
wants a few more icons.

47
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.950
Yeah.
Yeah.

48
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.640
That's no a big deal.

49
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.050
I think they're all namespace so

50
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.900
when you import it you're
not importing all of them.

51
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.000
You're only importing
the one that you need.

52
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.450
So I think you're fine there because going
above the no margin above or below so.

53
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.710
Use some icons and add a plus there and
then for extra, extra credit,

54
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.160
if you really wanted to, you're probably
not gonna have enough time to do this.

55
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.360
Or you probably time till the next one.

56
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.620
You're probably have to
wait til the next one.

57
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.370
I was gonna say for the tab bar here,
put some icons on the tab bar.

58
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.410
But this is actually a little trickier
because this component won't let

59
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.690
you stick in a component for
the label you can only stick in text.

60
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.550
So you have to render your own tab bars.

61
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.210
So you gonna make a new component to be
the tab bar and have that render the icon.

62
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.420
So that was kind of tough but
very possible.
