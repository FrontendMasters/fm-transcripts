[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:07.760
&gt;&gt; Scott: Did anybody like do some
incredible things over lunch with the app?

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.010
As far as like styling.

4
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.010
Anybody try to do like any of
the gradients that are there?

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I have to use a plugin but.

6
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.640
&gt;&gt; Scott: React linear gradient?

7
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Nice.

8
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.450
Okay, were gonna go over that.

9
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I load online.

10
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.142
Anybody do the gradients online?

11
00:00:21.142 --> 00:00:23.440
&gt;&gt; Scott: Anybody do the gradients online?

12
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.884
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Who is with us online,
let's see some thumbs up.

13
00:00:25.884 --> 00:00:26.751
&gt;&gt; Scott: Give me some thumbs.

14
00:00:26.751 --> 00:00:29.012
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We haven't been
hearing much from you guys.

15
00:00:29.012 --> 00:00:31.647
&gt;&gt; Scott: I wanna see this computer
shake from all the thumbs.

16
00:00:31.647 --> 00:00:32.877
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

17
00:00:32.877 --> 00:00:34.774
&gt;&gt; Scott: I want this computer to
shake off this podium right here.

18
00:00:34.774 --> 00:00:35.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Break the chatroom.

19
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.685
There's like nobody in there.

20
00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:38.888
&gt;&gt; Scott: Nobody, okay.

21
00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:39.603
They all got the call.

22
00:00:39.603 --> 00:00:41.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: 40 users, 39 users.

23
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, it says 39, but.

24
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.620
I guess we just came back from break.

25
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.850
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, everybody is just
weaking from that nap, that food nap.

26
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.926
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

27
00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:53.433
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Here it comes.

28
00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:56.297
Charles and Jesse, Mike.

29
00:00:56.297 --> 00:00:56.832
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Wake up.

30
00:00:56.832 --> 00:01:00.060
&gt;&gt; Scott: [LAUGH] All right.

31
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.326
Sweet.
So we left off,

32
00:01:01.326 --> 00:01:04.006
we went over the solution for
the for the tab view.

33
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:09.125
Now we're gonna get into
let's do third party lib and

34
00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:13.040
then we'll get an UI up on to that.

35
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.260
So we're a third party native lib
versus third party JavaScript lib.

36
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.501
So we already use a third party JavaScript
lib, or UI compile which is tab view.

37
00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:26.030
This is 100% JavaScript based.

38
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.230
But then,
there are other ones that require

39
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.130
dependencies on Native UIs,
in Android and iOS.

40
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.660
But, we can also use those too.

41
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.430
The down side is there's
a process you must do to actually

42
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.260
get these set up in your application.

43
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.140
Because, they are native UIs and
you have to tell your iOS and

44
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.290
Android products about them.

45
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.850
The good side is there's a tool
that does it for you automatically.

46
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.517
So you don't have to do it in most cases.

47
00:01:51.517 --> 00:01:56.946
We're going to walk through installing
a native UI component, using a native

48
00:01:56.946 --> 00:02:02.142
UI component, using this tool that's
gonna help linking it much easier.

49
00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:06.796
And steps from there, and how to determine
if something is native versus just pure

50
00:02:06.796 --> 00:02:09.124
JavaScript, so you're not confused.

51
00:02:09.124 --> 00:02:11.560
Cool, let's do that.

52
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.750
So, I'm back in the todo app, and
if you go look at the designs for

53
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.290
our app, we have these gradients here,
pretty legit.

54
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.926
This isn't something we've done with
the stylesheet, you can't really do.

55
00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:23.968
You have any question?

56
00:02:23.968 --> 00:02:26.063
I thought you were raising your hand,
sorry.

57
00:02:26.063 --> 00:02:28.980
So, we can't really do this with
a stylesheet but, Android and

58
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.017
iOS natively have support for
gradients, which is pretty legit.

59
00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:35.684
So we can tap into that with the native
over the JavaScript plugin as wrapping

60
00:02:35.684 --> 00:02:39.690
the native implementation,
likely somebody already created one.

61
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.929
So if you go look there is one right here
called react native linear gradient.

62
00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:47.843
If you'd google react native linear
gradient you would have missed it.

63
00:02:47.843 --> 00:02:51.293
That's literally what it's called.

64
00:02:51.293 --> 00:02:55.147
But, if you were to read the docs here
it says something about setting up

65
00:02:55.147 --> 00:02:59.774
the cocoa pods and great old build filesm
if you've never done native develop you're

66
00:02:59.774 --> 00:03:01.750
probably like what, what is that?

67
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.890
That's not NPM, but the cocoa pods It's
you can think of is like the NPM for iOS,

68
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.130
and then the great abilities like
the grope or the web package for

69
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.730
androids the built system.

70
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.760
So they're saying is because
this is actually using

71
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.280
some Native UI Components from Android
iOS, you must tell your product about it.

72
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.636
So you have to go in these files and

73
00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:24.725
update these every single
time you wanna use them.

74
00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:30.211
But that's not fun so somebody created
to a call RNPM, or which is short for

75
00:03:30.211 --> 00:03:34.670
React Native Package Manager,
which does all this for us.

76
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.215
Was pretty legit, so
let's walk through actually adding that.

77
00:03:37.215 --> 00:03:41.468
The first thing you need
to do is in your terminal,

78
00:03:41.468 --> 00:03:44.810
if you need to NPM installed globally,

79
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.504
RNPM Reactor Native Package Manager,
make sure it's globally.

80
00:03:50.504 --> 00:03:53.897
So you install that and
there's a few ways you can use it,

81
00:03:53.897 --> 00:03:58.870
we can use RNPM directly to install and
link the dependencies in one swoop.

82
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.380
Or if we already have dependencies and
we just need to link them.

83
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.879
We can do that as well.

84
00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.972
I'm actually gonna do it one soup and

85
00:04:04.972 --> 00:04:08.900
install the reactor native later
gradient and link at the same time.

86
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.762
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: This is
included in rec [INAUDIBLE]

87
00:04:11.762 --> 00:04:13.322
&gt;&gt; Scott: I think it is always just before

88
00:04:13.322 --> 00:04:17.582
use it, I always use implement install-g
to make sure it's up to date, just in case

89
00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:21.640
it's outdated just make sure you got
the latest thing like for me like it.

90
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.300
It cached it and
downloaded it pretty fast, so, yeah.

91
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.280
It's always a good practice to make sure,
at least for me for

92
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.050
my global stuff,
always make sure it's up to date.
