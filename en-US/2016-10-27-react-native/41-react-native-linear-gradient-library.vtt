00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.277
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.277 --> 00:00:08.593
&gt;&gt; Scott: And then, what we're gonna do is
we're gonna say RNPM install just like we

3
00:00:08.593 --> 00:00:11.370
do in NPM, and
that's the name of the package.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.530
In this case,
it's react-native-linear-gradient.

5
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.720
So, let's copy that, and we're just
gonna install it, and I hit Enter.

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.950
So, this is gonnainstall it in our Node
modules folder because technically,

7
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.270
it is a Node module that has
dependencies on the Native UI.

8
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.000
So, it's gonna install,
it just like any other Node module.

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.942
But then, you notice,

10
00:00:31.942 --> 00:00:35.021
this output right here at the bottom
which is different than any NPM package.

11
00:00:35.021 --> 00:00:38.165
It says, RNPM link, and
if you read the description, it says,

12
00:00:38.165 --> 00:00:41.730
Linking react-native-linear-gradient
android dependency.

13
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.010
Cool, we linked it to
android successfully.

14
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.420
Linking to iOS, cool,
we linked it successfully.

15
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.400
And that was great,
the entire module is now linked.

16
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.310
So, if you go read the instructions,
what is linked actually mean?

17
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.615
Everything that I just said about here.

18
00:00:55.615 --> 00:00:59.444
Adding it to the Cocoapods, and
downloading it, and adding it to

19
00:00:59.444 --> 00:01:05.220
the gradle build, to the dependencies,
and actually setting up this class here.

20
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.200
So, I did all that for us and
we could see to do that.

21
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.727
Now, if you already installed
reacts-native-linear-gradient via NPM

22
00:01:12.727 --> 00:01:14.910
because it is a Node module.

23
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.220
But you need to link it,
you can just run RNPM link and

24
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.020
it will go through your
note modules folder and

25
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.460
find any that anyone has native
dependencies and link them for you.

26
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.310
So it's like yeah everything's
already got to go.

27
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.280
We're good.

28
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.150
So what I've been doing
is a good practices.

29
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:38.061
I would go into my package.Jason, Every
recess scripts I had in the scripts or

30
00:01:38.061 --> 00:01:42.340
post install

31
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.282
every post install I would say
react native package manager.link.

32
00:01:47.282 --> 00:01:52.060
So what this is gonna do is whenever
you run in PM install after everything

33
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.230
installs then it's gonna run whatever is
in post install which is this command

34
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.949
that way it always names every
time I install something.

35
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.150
Cool any questions on that?

36
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.510
All the installation
part of these native U.I.

37
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.890
components and this is for
any native library we wanna use.

38
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.600
And how do we determine if it's
native will over the doc says so but

39
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.160
another way to find out is if
you just look at the good of you

40
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.160
look at the source code like Java,
Objective C.

41
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.960
Scott's or Ruby seven are obviously this
is and was gonna work in JavaScript.

42
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.650
There and if it is easier so
if this isn't just all yellow,

43
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.000
then this is not all work pretty much.

44
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.900
Whereas if you go look at the tab
one that we had the Reacts Native

45
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.690
linear scrolling Tab view so

46
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.821
you look at that and
you hope it's 100% JavaScript.

47
00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:49.620
All right,
there's no blue there's no brown there.

48
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.080
So that's all we know and again hopefully
it's in the docs that view pretty

49
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.010
messed up for someone to make a native
thing and not tell you that is native.

50
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.700
So yeah, Mayo uses native,
Is pretty good as you like and

51
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.850
I mean in all types of crazy stuff here.

52
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.250
So let's head back and
let's see how we can actually use it

53
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.150
now because it actually is just really
just a job as your package using it is

54
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.820
literally just like I was your package so
this case.

55
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.880
Let's let's actually run
this out right quick.

56
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.460
Right now there are and are.

57
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.960
Also nothing thing you can do is like if
you go to your package.Jason pro tip you

58
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.170
can take, get out of here, you can
take advantage of these scripts here,

59
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.060
so the scripts are just MPM
scripts that you can do

60
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.570
that you can run I'll
show you how to run them.

61
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.660
So if you just run in MPM start
then it will run this command

62
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.350
which is just gonna start to put
the reactor native server for

63
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.420
you that little thing that pops this thing
right here, that's what NPM Star does.

64
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.450
But you can you can write
whatever command you want

65
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.030
inside of NPM If you're
not familiar with Node.

66
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.610
So for instance,
I can say I want a command called Android.

67
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.688
And it's going to run React,

68
00:04:00.688 --> 00:04:04.283
Native, run, Android.

69
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.150
And you may know if I'll
actually do whatever you want and

70
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:14.770
then now as I did terminal shut this
down show you are going to run and

71
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.070
go where I could say N-P-R runs
followed by the name of that script

72
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.780
which in this case was called Android and
it was just right under it.

73
00:04:29.651 --> 00:04:33.959
&gt;&gt; Scott: So you can do IMPM so you can
make whatever what you want MPM Android,

74
00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:37.738
and then for every script that
you have you can make a post and

75
00:04:37.738 --> 00:04:39.510
pre version for that.

76
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.500
So now I can make preandroid.

77
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.450
And this will run whenever
I call the Android command.

78
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.850
I can make a post and write was a run
after the Android command runs and

79
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.000
all types of stuff.

80
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.840
You do all types of things.

81
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.790
So that's running.

82
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.406
Let's head back over to our todo,
&gt;&gt; Scott: Cannot read index

83
00:05:03.406 --> 00:05:09.480
of What are you talking.

84
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:11.400
I got this stuff here.

85
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.010
Cool.
So let's add a linear gradient

86
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.100
to this area.

87
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.720
So the way this will work is let's
actually add one to this to do here.

88
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.420
So I head over to to do.js And
we'll import.

89
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:39.135
If we look at the docs
&gt;&gt; Scott: Go to old docs,

90
00:05:39.135 --> 00:05:42.119
we'll import, where is that?

91
00:05:45.994 --> 00:05:50.854
&gt;&gt; Scott: I guess it's that
it was a good example is to

92
00:05:50.854 --> 00:05:55.714
be sure that he doesn't
want to put his docs

93
00:05:55.714 --> 00:06:00.180
there it is correct natively are good.

94
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.780
And it's just a default export
cool always got to doublecheck.

95
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.050
So we'll say from That and

96
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.470
this is a default export we
can call it whatever you want.

97
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.140
I'll just call it linear gradient.

98
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.580
There we go.

99
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.450
So we have a linear gradient.

100
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.470
And then I was going to go ahead and
make this the root

101
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.110
of our Of our view here and I'm pretty
sure linear gradient is just a wrapper for

102
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.970
a view so that means we don't
really need this view or

103
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:36.670
we could just say linear gradient
instead of this root view.

104
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:45.510
And that's probably going to break
as I don't put in the colors on it.

105
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:46.030
Exactly.

106
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.242
So now what I need to do
is add some color to this.

107
00:06:52.242 --> 00:06:57.580
So I think the syntax is colors,

108
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.590
and it's just an array of,
let's just put two colors here.

109
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.770
Let's just do black and white.

110
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:08.622
We'll just say So, there's zero and ff,

111
00:07:08.622 --> 00:07:14.934
save that
&gt;&gt; Scott: And it broke.

112
00:07:18.548 --> 00:07:21.354
&gt;&gt; Scott: There it was, there we go So

113
00:07:21.354 --> 00:07:26.722
that made a nice layer greater
albeit never that nice

114
00:07:26.722 --> 00:07:31.846
because black white men
are good as a look that good

115
00:07:31.846 --> 00:07:36.730
is actually use something
like iOS gradients.

116
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.170
They're like his website it's got
all these gradients, there you go.

117
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:41.640
Look at that.

118
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.070
Is that fancy?

119
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.685
Let's pick Let's pick this one.

120
00:07:47.685 --> 00:07:50.010
We'll have some orange.

121
00:07:51.572 --> 00:07:53.170
&gt;&gt; Scott: I forgot I had that.

122
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.530
Look at that.

123
00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:59.428
What.
So that too that.

124
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.050
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go.

125
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.370
Gradient so
now we've a nice little gradient.

126
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:14.580
So that's a native element running
the JavaScript in our reaction point.

127
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.330
That's pretty amazing
if you think about it.

128
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.170
Also note that when you download a native
UI let's say you already run emulator

129
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:26.419
you run your app you react need a package
manager install linear gradient

130
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.230
You link it and then you imported and
you try to use it and it breaks.

131
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:34.930
That's because you just linked a new
native package you have to stop

132
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.490
the react native server and
build it again.

133
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.730
It's not gonna find those native
dependent because it already built so

134
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:44.300
you got to stop everything ability again
you can keep on but you got to stop.

135
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.660
React native server and

136
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.720
have it bundle your app again in order to
pick up those new native dependencies.

137
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.020
Whereas if you just don't like a regular
node module, It'll probably just work.

138
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.970
That's only because
convenance pretty much.
