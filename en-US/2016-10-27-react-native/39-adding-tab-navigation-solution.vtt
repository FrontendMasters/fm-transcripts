[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:08.425
&gt;&gt; Scott: And now we're just gonna
go over right quick the solution for

3
00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:09.990
the tab navigation.

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.540
So did anybody figure that stuff out?

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.566
How to navigate from
the non-tab to the tab?

6
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.272
Yeah.
What did you do?

7
00:00:17.272 --> 00:00:21.719
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: On my kinda my root
component I have a Boolean property that

8
00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:27.164
is like show the current workout and
then whenever I in my welcome gear,

9
00:00:27.164 --> 00:00:30.521
my home view, whenever I click the button,

10
00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:34.558
I just trigger an action
up that flips that Boolean.

11
00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:40.927
Then I use that Boolean to either render
my home or walk on or current look.

12
00:00:40.927 --> 00:00:41.541
&gt;&gt; Scott: Nice.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Or lay out

13
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:42.502
the current work out.

14
00:00:42.502 --> 00:00:46.007
&gt;&gt; Scott: Nice yeah that it's pretty
much what I did too except for

15
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:48.700
I just didn't go through Redux to do that.

16
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.067
I just did it locally in a state.

17
00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:51.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah that's what I did too.

18
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.660
&gt;&gt; Scott: Nice.

19
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.040
So the way that looks is if we head
over to our index inside of our

20
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.830
welcome which was my root component,
actually, no not here.

21
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.006
It's actually in that index.JS,
here we go.

22
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:08.337
So in the root what I did was it was
it looks like I need components here.

23
00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:16.409
&gt;&gt; Scott: So what I did was I made
a new state here in the component.

24
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.170
And in that state I just have a property
called started, this is a boolean.

25
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.925
So start is default to false and
then I have a method right here called

26
00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:30.890
startWorkout so notice I'm using
this new syntax to create a method.

27
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.308
And that's because I don't
want to do.bind any more so

28
00:01:33.308 --> 00:01:35.070
if I just do this arrow function here.

29
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.862
I can just skip the dot bind and just use
this arrow function and don't have to that

30
00:01:39.862 --> 00:01:44.090
bind but you can still do it and
do that bind it's up to you but anyway.

31
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.100
This method all it does is when
called is just set started to true.

32
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.010
That's it.

33
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.925
So I'm just toggling a Boolean,
set it to true defaults to false.

34
00:01:50.925 --> 00:01:53.370
And here's where
the interesting part comes in.

35
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.323
So we pretty much have two entry points
to our application we have this welcome

36
00:01:58.323 --> 00:02:02.210
screen and then we have the rest of
our app which is a tabbed app right?

37
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.910
So it's like two trees almost where this
actually this is like the root and then we

38
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.100
have the two leaves but we want both of
those to have access to redux just in

39
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.730
case on the start screen we wanna like I
think we on the designs we have access to.

40
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.040
If we go back like the last workout.

41
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.697
So that means you probably
need access to Redux here and

42
00:02:21.697 --> 00:02:22.940
that's where it's gonna be stored.

43
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.550
So we wanna,
this to be in the provider as well.

44
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.120
So what I did was I just created
a method called render root which takes

45
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.515
any component and it's just going
to return a is gonna return

46
00:02:36.515 --> 00:02:40.110
that component that was passed in wrapped
inside the provider with the store.

47
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.730
And then this is gonna pass in
a prop called start workout which

48
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.990
is just a function that we set up here
that's just setting the state to true.

49
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.910
And then down below, all I'm doing here is
like okay, if this .state started is true

50
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.500
then all I want to do is render the main
which is gonna be the tabbed interface.

51
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.900
So if started it's true
render the tabbed interface.

52
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.974
If started is false render the welcome
interface and in the welcome interface.

53
00:03:09.974 --> 00:03:16.660
We're gonna be using this prop
to set started to true right?

54
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.160
So now.

55
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.760
Let's actually run this so we can see.

56
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.550
Think I already got it running.

57
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.060
Looks like I broke it.

58
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.660
Let's try it again.

59
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.440
So basically all I'm doing
is I just have a Boolean

60
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.600
on this index root component that's
being toggled by the welcome screen and

61
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.900
when the welcome screen sets it to true.

62
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.890
That's going to change the state in this
root which is going to call the render

63
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.560
function again, and the render
first is like started is true now.

64
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.460
So now I'm gonna render
the tabbed app now, that's it.

65
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.109
Just a simple Boolean, any other
approaches that people came up with?

66
00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.970
I'm curious.

67
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.141
No, no other approaches?

68
00:03:57.141 --> 00:04:00.410
Okay so right now started is false.

69
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.200
So I rendered the welcome screen and

70
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.350
if we go look back at the welcome
screen here on this button press.

71
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.280
I'm doing props.startWorkout.

72
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.100
I'm not doing this.props because I have
a stateless function that just receives

73
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.560
props if you have a class, then that will
be this.props this is just a stateless

74
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.130
function so I guess the props,
some same props.startWorkout which again

75
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.850
is passed in to whatever
component is here.

76
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.600
Component to render.

77
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.160
StartWorkout.

78
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.736
And component to render's either
gonna be Main or the Welcome.

79
00:04:32.736 --> 00:04:33.380
Doesn't matter.

80
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.025
Right.
So I want the welcome one so

81
00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:39.450
it does have a prop called startWorkout so
on press call that.

82
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:45.371
So if I press this it should set the state
to true, the started state to true on here

83
00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:51.315
which will then re-trigger a re-render
which will then render this Main here.

84
00:04:51.315 --> 00:04:52.620
Everybody follow me there?

85
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.868
Okay cool let's try it.

86
00:04:54.868 --> 00:04:55.991
Cool and it did it so

87
00:04:55.991 --> 00:05:00.285
now we're on the tabbed interface
which is just these two screens here.

88
00:05:00.285 --> 00:05:04.781
And now we can't hit the back button and
go back because that's not part of this

89
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:08.790
app and the back button Android
doesn't do that by default anyway.

90
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.850
It's crazy.
You've got to set that up yourself and

91
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.560
then as far as what
the tabbed app looks like or

92
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.590
looks like it is just a stateless
app again I just have a view here.

93
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.030
I put my tab at the bottom.

94
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.012
And I set it to overlay so
it's transparent.

95
00:05:26.012 --> 00:05:30.420
I bumped up the font size and I was
added to texts for the actual tabs and

96
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.261
that's it.

97
00:05:34.345 --> 00:05:35.296
&gt;&gt; Scott: Any questions on this?

98
00:05:38.193 --> 00:05:40.903
&gt;&gt; Scott: And I made it a overlay because
in the designs it's actually transparent

99
00:05:40.903 --> 00:05:42.380
so I just made it transparent here too.
