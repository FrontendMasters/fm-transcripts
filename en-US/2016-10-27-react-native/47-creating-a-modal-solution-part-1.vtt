00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.482
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:05.740
&gt;&gt; Scott: Anybody launched the Modal?

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:12.908
No, nobody got to the Modal?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: My screen looks like this.

4
00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:14.664
[CROSSTALK].

5
00:00:14.664 --> 00:00:15.625
I got that Modal.

6
00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:20.082
Some, what was happening.

7
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.885
The vector icon library was trying

8
00:00:26.885 --> 00:00:32.250
to override itself because I guess

9
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.980
when you run RNPM Link.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Link.

10
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: it just keeps adding

11
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.480
imports to the main activity dot Java.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Did

12
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.630
you run that while the app is running?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Did I?

13
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.900
Maybe.
&gt;&gt; Scott: That's probably why.

14
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.950
Just stop it and then do that part for go.

15
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.760
Alright, so let's go through here.

16
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.210
That's not been my life broken too but
will fix it along the way.

17
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.580
So this is why I did.

18
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.570
The first thing I did was actually move
current work out of the container because

19
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.710
I started work on Mars like this actually
makes more sense to be a container and

20
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.640
now you are component.

21
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.650
So I did that because it is a container.

22
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.470
So take a look there.

23
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.850
It's kind of beef you know.

24
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.530
So we need to connect this to redux.

25
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.010
So we could open up.

26
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.140
The modal and then we also needed to add
like a little area some little component

27
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.020
thing to that's kind of
like display our list and

28
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.330
then also allow us to
open up the modal Yeah.

29
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.170
So a few things here.

30
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.720
So the first thing I did was I import
a connects To connect to redux

31
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.800
here on the side of this component and
then, actually we don't need that.

32
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.700
We don't need both of those so

33
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.380
then what I did was I created
a new action called setExercise.

34
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.690
Modal visibility and
were gonna look at it in minutes.

35
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.320
It sounds fancy but
is not really doing anything.

36
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.210
Actually This is now we gonna know.

37
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.050
So this is all it's doing.

38
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.460
I think this is already here.

39
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.710
I think we went over this.

40
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.910
It just takes it it's visible not true or
false it just recreates it action And

41
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.940
returns that action.

42
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.270
This is going to be an object
with a type of this and

43
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.310
a payload of whatever boolean this is.

44
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.460
It's just toggling a boolean.

45
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.880
And then I'm getting the states states of
props in the state that I want for this

46
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.360
screen is going to be the current workout
which is going to be an array because

47
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.570
eventually we're going to put Current work
out on the current work out component.

48
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.030
So we need the current work out state and
then also need to exercise modal state so.

49
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.870
So, the Modal be open.

50
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.564
Yes or no.

51
00:02:43.564 --> 00:02:45.090
So, those are the two things
that I need here for now.

52
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.260
And then, for the props, so, the actions
that I need is that only one for

53
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.010
Nonis to set the Modal visibility,
just what I decided to call it,

54
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.620
you can name this whatever you want.

55
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.090
I just called it that.

56
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.420
that takes in a billion.

57
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.110
That is going to dispatch that
action created we just saw.

58
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.830
So this is going to dispatch
this function which takes of

59
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.400
a billion which returns in actions
is going to spend action and

60
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.310
then actually if you look at the reducer
inside the current workout reducer or.

61
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.980
I'm sorry, in the UI reducer,
it's gonna hit right here.

62
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.160
This is going to toggle this
exercise Modal to be true or false.

63
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.750
And because we're subscribing to
the exercise Modal right here, we have it.

64
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.170
So, now we just gonna bind
this straight to the Modal.

65
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.050
So then I covered this over to a class,
set up some default props here.

66
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.640
Current workout, we actually
don't need exercises right now.

67
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.040
And the render function we have the top
bar like we've always like we have before.

68
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.570
We had that over that and

69
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.700
then here I actually broke out
to a few other components.

70
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.820
So the first component I
made was work out list.

71
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.900
And we'll go, look at that, and
then, I made one for exercise Modal.

72
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.940
So, I made those two separate
opposers they have their own logic.

73
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.210
I just don't wanna stuff it in here.

74
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.740
So I broke those out to
2 separate departments.

75
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.300
Workout lists is going
to be this right here.

76
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.000
So right now it's not really a list
because we don't have a workout but

77
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.420
if you give it some workout
it will render a list.

78
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.420
That's not at all render
as an exercises for

79
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.050
the plus but,
that's why I call a workout list.

80
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.070
And then, exercise Modal is that,
a Modal like there.

81
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.540
So, let's look at some of that stuff.

82
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.460
Any question so far and like why I
decided to do some of the things I did or

83
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.076
if you lost anything.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Does

84
00:04:35.076 --> 00:04:37.740
this make a sense, why did this.

85
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.470
Well that was, let's not make a sense?

86
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.922
I still don't have my head wrapped
around Redux, but that's okay [LAUGH].

87
00:04:44.922 --> 00:04:47.048
Okay, just think about it like this.

88
00:04:47.048 --> 00:04:50.162
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: No it's it's really

89
00:04:50.162 --> 00:04:51.960
okay.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah,

90
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.140
you've got to think about it like this.

91
00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.730
So we have a single state tree, right?

92
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.480
We have a store.

93
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.280
That's just one store in our entire
application this function is saying hey

94
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.600
this component wants access to this
state on that store that sort of saying.

95
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.940
I want to get the current
work out state and

96
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.140
I wanna get the state.exercise
Modal state.

97
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.660
And I want to merge it on a property
called current workout and

98
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.120
a property caught exercise Modal.

99
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.520
On to the props of this component.

100
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.540
So now we have prop dot current work out
props dot excise moto which are always

101
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.430
going to equal the new value of
these state properties here, and

102
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.970
then for the actions we're literally
saying the same thing I want to make

103
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.960
an action that dispatches or I want to
make a property that dispatches an action.

104
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.570
That's it.

105
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.180
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So I'm Charles.

106
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.530
in general are usually using dispatch in
your map actions to props functions or

107
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.270
will you use that tool to
bind dispatch to your action

108
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.400
creators?
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah.

109
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.690
So there's a tool you can use bind an
action creators which does it for you but

110
00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.660
I wanted to be explicit
about what's happening.

111
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.330
So I'm not high in the magic.

112
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.680
So you can use there's another tool And
like reactor,

113
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.140
where is it or react to react has
an bind action creators which will

114
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:18.350
pretty much just take all the actions that
you want and so you don't have to do this.

115
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.139
It'll just do this part for
you are pretty much.

116
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.110
I'm just writing it all out so
we can see it.

117
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.670
I don't want to hide the magic because
yeah, you can do that as an abstraction

118
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.500
but it's nice to understand what's
happening before you do the abstraction.

119
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.640
Typically I always just write
it out like this anyway so

120
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.700
I can just look at the file
like yo what's going on.

121
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.210
That's just me.

122
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.420
Sweet so yeah that's that's redux it's
just like merging the props it's like give

123
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.360
me this state give these actions attach it
to the problem and the reason we do that

124
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.630
is because this state is going to change,
And when the state changes it's going to

125
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:57.120
update the prop which is going to rerender
the method here rerender the component.

126
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.960
So that means the component is
always going to fresh state.

127
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.030
Whenever an action is fired.

128
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.350
That's pretty much what's happening.

129
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:10.750
So any other questions on that?
&gt;&gt; Scott: No?

130
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.970
All right,
let's hop into this WorkoutList.

131
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.660
So the WorkoutList has two props on it,
setModalVisibility,

132
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.690
and that's just going to be a boolean.

133
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.120
And that's bound to
this.props.setModalVisibility.

134
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.970
Which is also bound to this method right
here which is going to dispatch so

135
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:32.500
that's a function so now the Modal can
determine if it wants to close itself or

136
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:37.180
not that's why I passed out it so
if you go look at the designs.

137
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.600
There's an X on the modal.

138
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.510
So that's what that function will
be called when you click the X

139
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.350
is to control the visibility of the motile
so if you click the x it closes.

140
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.670
Also if you click a workout it'll
close but add the workout too.

141
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.570
So that's what that function is to
control the visibility of itself and

142
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.590
then the current workout.

143
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.350
So this is going to be the array
of the current workout and

144
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.330
the reason we put this here.

145
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.530
it is because or actually no wait.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Is that the modal?

146
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:05.580
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah this is not the modal I put

147
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.690
this on the wrong property sorry.

148
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:08.950
I'm like wait that doesn't make any sense.

149
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.350
No wait actually no we do want this
here we do want this here too.

150
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.700
We definitely want this here.

151
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.560
The reason we want this here is because
when we click this pause button,

152
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.450
this pause button is
gonna launch the Modal.

153
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:21.920
So we put that there.

154
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.260
But we also want to put that
on the modal itself too.

155
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.300
But the modal only closes so
only put closeModal on that.

156
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.150
The modal can't open itself
if it's already open.

157
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.980
So it only can close itself so
I put that there.

158
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.610
Yes so the WorkoutList definitely
wants to be able to open it or

159
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:37.890
close it or whatever.

160
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.385
And then the currentWorkout which is
going to be a list of workouts And

161
00:08:41.385 --> 00:08:44.109
there is no workouts in that list,
just render this.
