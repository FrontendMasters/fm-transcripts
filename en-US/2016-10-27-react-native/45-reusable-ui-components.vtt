[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.840
&gt;&gt; Scott: How do you
make reusable components?

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.340
Let's just make one right quick.

4
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.600
Let's make a generic reusable component
that we can pass props to and

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.136
change how it works, and then I'll show
you how to use the children property on

6
00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:20.890
a component to completely change
the template or whatever.

7
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.750
So let's do that.

8
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.230
Let's go down to UI and
we'll make a new component and

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.000
what we'll do is let's make a button.

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.610
No, buttons are lame.

11
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.060
Let's just make this nav bar thing,
let's just do that.

12
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.580
So we'll do a new file and
I will call this one, it's called

13
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.960
the top bar cuz it is not really
a navigation bar, not navigating with it.

14
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.723
So let's say top bar and we'll just go
ahead and head over to our index and

15
00:00:50.723 --> 00:00:59.940
export it before we forget to.
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go.

16
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.930
So we haven't made that yet,
it's gonna break probably.

17
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.230
I would do, very surprising.

18
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.340
So now,
we're gonna import reacts from react,

19
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.990
we might need to make this a component
depending on how we make this or not.

20
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.339
They will import,
I know we don't need view and

21
00:01:21.339 --> 00:01:26.208
Stylesheet.
&gt;&gt; Scott: But

22
00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:28.010
you probably think we
might need more than that.

23
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.750
Looking at the designs, like if you
go look, there's a text in here so

24
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.030
I should probably import text too.

25
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.582
But the way we're going to set it up,

26
00:01:33.582 --> 00:01:36.000
this component's not even
going to know about the text.

27
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.270
It doesn't really care,
doesn't care about the text.

28
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.160
So we have that.

29
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.229
And then, where you at, here we go,

30
00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.330
from reacts-native.

31
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.350
Cool, so first thing we'll do is
we'll export the const Top bar.

32
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.170
Any props that may or
may not come in here.

33
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.727
And it will just render a view here,
just like that,

34
00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:07.418
and I will say style=styles.container,

35
00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:12.220
and we haven't make that yet,
so let's just make that.

36
00:02:15.731 --> 00:02:17.099
Men, I gotta turn that toggle off.

37
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.470
It's crazy.

38
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.330
There you go,
cost styles = StyleSheet.create,

39
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.299
and then container.

40
00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:39.262
All right so for the nav bar,
I'm just gonna guess like,

41
00:02:39.262 --> 00:02:43.590
let's just say height of 60.

42
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.900
We'll play with it, so
height of 60, flex one.

43
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.350
There we go.

44
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.370
There's the container.

45
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.790
So now what we wanna be able to do is,
a few things we wanna be able to do.

46
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.950
Is we want who's ever using this top bar

47
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.670
to decide what the style of it is, they
should be able to overwrite the style and

48
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.840
they should be able to put
whatever content they want in it.

49
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.690
On this screen,
we have just text that's purple.

50
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.920
But on this screen, we have a linear
gradient that's going left to right

51
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.810
with a search bar in it
with a close button.

52
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.390
So that means who's ever using this top
bar should be able to do whatever they

53
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.835
wanna do with it.

54
00:03:23.835 --> 00:03:26.750
Two things we gotta do,
one we're gonna pass in props.

55
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.519
So what we can do is,
you can say you know what,

56
00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.418
if you want to override the default styles
here, all we gotta do is say we're gonna

57
00:03:34.418 --> 00:03:38.114
pass in an array and
then we're gonna pass in props.styles.

58
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.255
So now when you pass in styles on this
component, because we're adding it second,

59
00:03:45.255 --> 00:03:47.100
it's going to overwrite whatever is here.

60
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.090
So if you pass in a props,
if you pass a styles object thathas

61
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.210
a container property,
it's gonna overwrite this container style.

62
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.260
And whatever other style you want.

63
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.440
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You always use prof stuff

64
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.502
style or props stuff style?
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah you can put style, my bad.

65
00:04:03.502 --> 00:04:06.320
So props.style.

66
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.910
Yeah that's better because I
think that's the convention.

67
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.970
So we'll put style here.

68
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.210
So this will give you
a chance to override.

69
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.190
So we can put any default stuff
that we want here and overwrite.

70
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.970
And if we decide to do like more style,
like Francis was like,

71
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.480
yeah you know what, this has padding too.

72
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.430
So we'll put some padding of like ten and
so forth.

73
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.560
So you can do other stuff so
this will overwrite the style.

74
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:36.460
The next thing is we don't know what
the content of this is going to be.

75
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.320
Anybody know how to receive that and

76
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.970
react if you just don't know what it is?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Props.something.

77
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.980
&gt;&gt; Scott: Props.something.

78
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.060
That's the only thing we got,
got to be props.something.

79
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Default props.

80
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.090
&gt;&gt; Scott: Not default props.

81
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.416
It's props.children.

82
00:04:54.416 --> 00:04:58.240
So probs.children gonna be
whatever you pass in as a child

83
00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.940
component to this component.

84
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.060
This is like just put it here.

85
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.330
That's where that's gonna go.

86
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.770
So you can do that.

87
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.420
So now what that means is,
they can style this whatever they want.

88
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.080
Now the top bar doesn't really
care what exactly this is at all.

89
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.440
It's just props.children.

90
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.119
That's a basic top bar of course,
let's actually bring that in and

91
00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:20.810
see how that works.

92
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.861
So if we go to current

93
00:05:25.861 --> 00:05:31.212
work out and we import

94
00:05:31.212 --> 00:05:36.580
topbar from topbar.

95
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.237
Then what we can do is,
we can put our topbar here.

96
00:05:41.237 --> 00:05:47.080
You can say topbar, there we go, and
then we can overwrite the style here.

97
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.680
So let's say style, and it will say
this is gonna be styles.topbar,

98
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.050
we'll write that in a minute, and then
now this is where we add the children.

99
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:02.169
So, the children we want here is actually

100
00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:08.328
just the texts node that
says current workout.

101
00:06:08.328 --> 00:06:15.680
That will give us a style of
styles.textbar or whatever.

102
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.640
So we also need to go ahead and

103
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.087
bring in the style sheet there.
&gt;&gt; Scott: And

104
00:06:20.087 --> 00:06:21.529
then we're gonna go ahead and
make those styles.

105
00:06:30.775 --> 00:06:32.484
&gt;&gt; Scott: So we've got topbar and

106
00:06:32.484 --> 00:06:36.771
if we look at the designs,
the topbar is, what color is it?

107
00:06:42.755 --> 00:06:45.426
&gt;&gt; Scott: Anybody know where color is?

108
00:06:45.426 --> 00:06:46.584
It's a trick question.

109
00:06:46.584 --> 00:06:48.940
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It's transparent.

110
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.896
&gt;&gt; Scott: It's transparent, yeah.

111
00:06:50.896 --> 00:06:52.560
[LAUGH] Color is transparent.

112
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.970
Our background color is transparent.

113
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.420
Yeah, you can do that now.

114
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.930
So background color is transparent,
so we're gonna override that there.

115
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.150
So actually we're gonna mix it in.

116
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.160
So we're not gonna overwrite
anything because topbar doesn't have

117
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.340
a background color to begin with.

118
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.820
But just to show you,
it's a little default to one and

119
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.900
we'll see how it overwrite
background color white.

120
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.110
So, this should overwrite it.

121
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.676
So then we'll come back here, transparent.

122
00:07:21.676 --> 00:07:25.329
And let's say we want to add more padding,

123
00:07:25.329 --> 00:07:30.198
we can do that but
let's see what that looks like now, and

124
00:07:30.198 --> 00:07:34.082
they will say the textbar
is gonna be a color.

125
00:07:34.082 --> 00:07:38.970
I got something like a purple thing,
there wasn't but white for now, but

126
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.600
I also wanna do justify content center.

127
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.080
And align items center on this component.

128
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.104
So it centers the text.

129
00:07:49.104 --> 00:07:50.680
There we go.

130
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.160
So there we go.

131
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.400
So there we got the bar right there.

132
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.550
So let's actually just
make a little better.

133
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:05.533
We'll say with font size of like 40,
that's a little big,

134
00:08:05.533 --> 00:08:09.690
30, and it's like a border right here.

135
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:15.814
Almost like a pretty solid border, so

136
00:08:15.814 --> 00:08:21.198
we'll say borderBottomWidth of like two.

137
00:08:21.198 --> 00:08:29.490
And then borderBottomColor

138
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.610
of white.

139
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:33.110
There we go.

140
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:38.420
Now we have a topbar and
it's a reusable UI component that you can

141
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.910
pretty much pass anything to and
over right at the same time.
