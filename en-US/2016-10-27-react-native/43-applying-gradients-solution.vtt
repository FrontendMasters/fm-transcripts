[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:08.550
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right, so this is what
I have right here, which is this.

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.290
So I put the gradient.

4
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.390
I got the same colors,

5
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.430
you could a color tool and
figure the colors if you look at designs.

6
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.770
And I kinda make a lot closer to it.

7
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.507
So what's actually happened here is I
imported the linear gradient that we

8
00:00:20.507 --> 00:00:21.290
talked about.

9
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.020
I brought it in, here the color codes for

10
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.449
those two colors from this purple
to this magenta pinkish color.

11
00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.939
But then I also installed this other thing
that I didn't tell you about which is

12
00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:33.565
a button.

13
00:00:33.565 --> 00:00:35.294
So we don't have to use
touchable pass anymore.

14
00:00:35.294 --> 00:00:39.945
There's this button component that you
can install with this command right here.

15
00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:42.657
APM install apsl-react-native-button.

16
00:00:42.657 --> 00:00:45.500
If you was to Google React Native button,
I'm sure you'll see a lot of them.

17
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.820
This is just one of my favorite ones.

18
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.176
There's tons of them out there.

19
00:00:48.176 --> 00:00:50.450
So I'll just use the button for
the start work out here.

20
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.619
And that's basically it for this one,
and we'll build the main one together,

21
00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:56.490
just to show you.

22
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.198
Any questions on this one?

23
00:01:00.198 --> 00:01:03.814
And I changed the styling around to put
everything in the middle because remember,

24
00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:05.111
everything is flex, right?

25
00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:10.154
So I got these containers, my convention
for the styling was, so I have this huge,

26
00:01:10.154 --> 00:01:15.360
I have the overall container which is the
root, which is the layer gradient, right?

27
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.070
So that gets a flex one.

28
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.580
And then what you can do is you can
just put a line item center on that

29
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.590
container and all of its children's
gonna be centered automatically.

30
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.724
But you can also individually
wrap everything in its own view,

31
00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:36.794
which also will take a line items and
justify content to center vertically and

32
00:01:36.794 --> 00:01:41.870
horizontally for those specific views,
which is what I'm doing right now.

33
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.500
So this title is wrapped, this text for
Sweat Book, right here, is wrapped

34
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.330
in its own view which is justifying
its content and centering its content.

35
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.850
And the same thing for the text below it.

36
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.172
So it's flex boxes,
in flex boxes, in flex boxes.

37
00:01:58.172 --> 00:02:00.750
So everything is a view here.

38
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.350
So we got one view, two view, three view,

39
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.558
four views with all text and
stuff in them.

40
00:02:04.558 --> 00:02:06.190
So that was my philosophy on it.

41
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.830
But again, you can just put, you can just
center it from the root and just kinda go

42
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.720
from there too but I wanted a little more
control over, over the stuff on the page.

43
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.660
So I wrapped it in views.

44
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.070
This makes it easy too, to break this
stuff out to other components too.

45
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.393
Cuz it's just in the view,
just snap it out,

46
00:02:22.393 --> 00:02:24.790
put in another component,
we're good to go.

47
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.848
Okay, so let's just head over
to this page where it's nothing.

48
00:02:30.848 --> 00:02:35.500
And we'll just convert this
over to use some gradient too.

49
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.817
So let's head over to,
in my case I think it's Main,

50
00:02:40.817 --> 00:02:45.071
and we'll import that gradient here, and

51
00:02:45.071 --> 00:02:49.580
we'll just change this to linear gradient.

52
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.250
And then your gradient.

53
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.460
There we go.
And then for the colors,

54
00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:01.940
&gt;&gt; Scott: I have the colors right here.

55
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.550
Let's see what the colors are.

56
00:03:08.235 --> 00:03:09.480
&gt;&gt; Scott: Where are you, color?

57
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.130
No, it's somewhere else.

58
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.247
This one, there we go.

59
00:03:14.247 --> 00:03:17.083
These colors.

60
00:03:21.025 --> 00:03:22.353
&gt;&gt; Scott: Just gonna
add these colors here.

61
00:03:22.353 --> 00:03:24.815
There we go, hit save.

62
00:03:24.815 --> 00:03:30.315
There we go, and talk about those
lines here, it's killing me,

63
00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:37.110
go away
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go, sweet.

64
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.260
So now we have the linear gradient
right here on just this one tab.

65
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.040
If we swipe over,
actually I put it on both tabs, nevermind.

66
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.380
So they're on both tabs right now,
but you can put them on one tab.

67
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.077
For instance, right now just a text but

68
00:03:50.077 --> 00:03:53.430
this was another component which we're
about to do then you will put it here.
