00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.074
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.074 --> 00:00:07.039
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So React components, a lot
of people said they never used React, so

3
00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:09.389
we're just gonna go over
React components briefly.

4
00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.900
I'll get into some live examples and
then I'm gonna set you free on a exercise.

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.115
So React components, who here is
hasn't heard of web components before?

6
00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:24.067
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Everyone knows
what web components are,

7
00:00:24.067 --> 00:00:27.167
it's like this new standard
that's come in to the browser.

8
00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:31.552
It's like a widget for the web, pretty
much, it's like a new API for widget for

9
00:00:31.552 --> 00:00:32.090
the web.

10
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.803
So React components and other frameworks
who also have components, it's just their

11
00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:40.812
philosophy to bring that same widget
system to JavaScript frameworks.

12
00:00:40.812 --> 00:00:41.424
Yes?

13
00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:45.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's
a question on the line.

14
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.190
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I use a lot of React for
web, still getting used to style,

15
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.180
I wonder how different are the two worlds?

16
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.608
They're very similar, React for
the web and React Native,

17
00:00:57.608 --> 00:01:02.100
I would say are probably
at least 75% the same.

18
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.404
So it's pretty close.

19
00:01:04.404 --> 00:01:05.720
It's gonna be nice.

20
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.910
So React brings into view encapsulation
with their React components.

21
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.940
So that means every single thing,

22
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.610
your whole application is
just a tree of components.

23
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.100
Like if you open the DOM,
you see a tree of elements.

24
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.510
Your application is going
to be just like that.

25
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.200
So we're going to do these
components that you made or

26
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.760
you downloaded somewhere else and
that's what React components offer.

27
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.820
So separation of concern, so
we can separate different functionalities,

28
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.090
different parts of our UI
into different components and

29
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.870
then we can compose those components
together to create our application.

30
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.166
And because of that, it's modular so

31
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:41.380
if we separate everything out like
that then it's completely modular,

32
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.680
we can stick this component here,
we can share with this person.

33
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.927
We can test it, isolate it for the rest
of the application, all types of stuff,

34
00:01:47.927 --> 00:01:48.760
it's pretty cool.

35
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.401
And it uses JSX.

36
00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:56.961
I remember when React was first
announced they got booed off stage,

37
00:01:56.961 --> 00:01:59.128
forgot what conference it was.

38
00:01:59.128 --> 00:02:02.944
I can't remember but they got booed off
stage cuz people's like, it's gross,

39
00:02:02.944 --> 00:02:06.601
you got XML in your JavaScript, that's
terrible like they got booed off stage but

40
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:08.890
now it's like JSX is like the best thing.

41
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.847
People are like, man,
I can't live without JSX.

42
00:02:11.847 --> 00:02:16.574
I think it's just funny, but I do love JSX
because it's like writing JavaScript in

43
00:02:16.574 --> 00:02:19.343
your HTML instead of
writing string templates so

44
00:02:19.343 --> 00:02:24.220
you get the syntax highlighting, you can
just do regular JavaScript stuff like map.

45
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.317
You'll see it's pretty simple
if you never used React,

46
00:02:27.317 --> 00:02:31.202
it's literally just JavaScript for
your templates which is amazing.

47
00:02:31.202 --> 00:02:32.396
Any questions on this stuff?

48
00:02:34.802 --> 00:02:36.036
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's
a question in the line,

49
00:02:36.036 --> 00:02:37.991
I'm not sure if you answered it yet
though.

50
00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:38.791
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Which one?

51
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:43.651
Does React Native actually
compiles native code?

52
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:48.550
Yeah, we'll get into exactly
how React Native works.

53
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.470
Yet you will have native code on your app.

54
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.960
Yes, it is not some web view like Ionic.

55
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.500
Like, you're gonna bring up a web view and
if it's gonna run your code in there.

56
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.060
There's no DOM in React Native.

57
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.522
There's no DOM and
that's the beauty of React.

58
00:03:00.522 --> 00:03:05.342
React itself is not, the React components
itself are not attached to the DOM.

59
00:03:05.342 --> 00:03:06.670
They're completely separated from the DOM.

60
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.100
In fact, there's React and then there's
React Dom because they separated the two.

61
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.600
So we're gonna be using the part of React
that has nothing to do with the DOM in

62
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.530
React Native which is just
how you define components.

63
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.030
That's pretty much it, it has
absolutely nothing to do with the DOM.

64
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.820
So yeah,
this isn't tied to the web at all.

65
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.040
It's just a way to create components,
to create UIs, that's it.

66
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.750
And in those UIs are then converted to
native UIs by the React Native platform.

67
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.569
So that make sense?

68
00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:35.565
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Follow up.

69
00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:36.065
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yes?

70
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.270
If your JSX on web compiles JavaScript
which injects things into the DOM,

71
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.630
then what does JSX
compiles on React Native?

72
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.580
So we're gonna get into that on the next,
after the first exercise.

73
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.611
Good question though, yeah, there's no
DOM, so like what the hell is it, yeah,

74
00:03:53.611 --> 00:03:54.209
we'll see.

75
00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.309
Cool, any question on this so far?

76
00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:59.400
No, no,
you can just stop working down there.

77
00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:03.475
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Getting close.

78
00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:05.518
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: You're getting close, okay.

79
00:04:05.518 --> 00:04:07.961
So, React Native.

80
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:11.890
React Native, bridges native in
JavaScript development, literally.

81
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.010
It's literally a bridge,
that's what React Native is.

82
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.820
There's a bridge that sits there and

83
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.010
it runs your JavaScript code on
the JavaScript VM on the mobile device.

84
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.918
So on iOS that's what JavaScript
core on Android, that's V8.

85
00:04:25.918 --> 00:04:29.904
So it's gonna run your JavaScript on that
VM there and there's a bridge that where

86
00:04:29.904 --> 00:04:33.199
is asynchronous communications
happen between the native code and

87
00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.373
your JavaScript code.

88
00:04:34.373 --> 00:04:37.665
Whether that's you develop some native
module that you wanna use in JavaScript or

89
00:04:37.665 --> 00:04:39.718
some JavaScript that
you're gonna use natively,

90
00:04:39.718 --> 00:04:42.370
it just talks asynchronously like that.

91
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.726
You can also expose native modules
to JavaScript like I just said.

92
00:04:45.726 --> 00:04:49.150
So React Native shifts with
tons of APIs and UI and

93
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.880
stuff that you can use in React Native but
you can also create your own if you know

94
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.660
mobile development and there's tons
of examples on how to do that.

95
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.870
We're not gonna get in that cuz I don't
think anybody raised their hand when

96
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.820
they said they knew native development, so
it's no point of even getting into that.

97
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.100
It's cross platform so

98
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.020
we can, all right, React Native
is gonna run on Android and iOS.

99
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.440
It started off at just iOS but

100
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.769
then they got it working on
Android which is pretty legit.

101
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.340
And it also brings over some
other good parts of the web.

102
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.580
So it's not just the React
component syntax like JSX and

103
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.470
all the other awesome stuff, but
things like flex boxes and some CSS stuff.

104
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.150
All that stuff comes over to React Native,
which is pretty dope in my opinion.

105
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.703
So yeah, any questions on that stuff?

106
00:05:36.375 --> 00:05:38.518
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, all right, so

107
00:05:38.518 --> 00:05:44.030
now what we're gonna do is
let's hop in to some React.

108
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Before you jump in.

109
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.026
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yes
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Couple more questions

110
00:05:47.026 --> 00:05:47.767
on the line.

111
00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:48.506
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay.

112
00:05:48.506 --> 00:05:51.672
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The one that
actually Charles' question,

113
00:05:51.672 --> 00:05:57.140
do you use tools like redux in
React Native to manage state.

114
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.540
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yes, you can.

115
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.230
So the only thing that's
gonna be specifically for

116
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.510
React Native are going to be
the components that we use.

117
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.930
As far as like the application logic,

118
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.880
you can use whatever you want as
long as it's not attached to DOM.

119
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.770
So redux is a great example of a state
management solution that is not attached

120
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.760
to the DOM.

121
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.000
And in fact, we're gonna be
using that today and tomorrow or

122
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.750
you can roll your own.

123
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.620
So pretty much any flux implementation
you want to use that isn't attached to

124
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.290
the DOM, which is pretty much all of them,
you can use in React Native.
