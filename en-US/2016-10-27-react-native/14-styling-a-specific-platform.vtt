[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.624
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: The other thing you can get
around with this making styles as far as

3
00:00:06.624 --> 00:00:10.127
organization is if, let's say, because
this isn't gonna look the same on iOS.

4
00:00:10.127 --> 00:00:12.430
And iOS isn't gonna look
the same on Android, right?

5
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.290
So what you can do is you can move these
styles into a different folder, or

6
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.576
a different file.

7
00:00:18.576 --> 00:00:22.411
For instance we can say,

8
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:28.808
we'll call this styles.android.js.

9
00:00:28.808 --> 00:00:34.452
And then we'll call
another one styles.ios.js.

10
00:00:34.452 --> 00:00:39.029
And what we'll do is we'll go to Fancy,
we'll grab these styles.

11
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.130
We'll put them in Android.

12
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.328
We'll make sure to import stylesheet,

13
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.843
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: From react native,

14
00:00:53.843 --> 00:00:54.630
we'll save that.

15
00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.217
And then now inside of our component,
all we have to do is,

16
00:01:00.217 --> 00:01:04.104
we don't need the style sheet any more.

17
00:01:04.104 --> 00:01:08.607
All we have to do is just
import the styles that I

18
00:01:08.607 --> 00:01:13.100
should be exporting, export styles.

19
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.674
So all we have to do now is
just import those styles.

20
00:01:15.674 --> 00:01:17.858
And the pad that we want
to import them from,

21
00:01:17.858 --> 00:01:21.479
we don't have to include the platform
we don't include Android, iOS.

22
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.112
React Native will pick it up for
us at runtime.

23
00:01:25.112 --> 00:01:28.051
And for Android,
we're gonna give you the Android version.

24
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:29.719
For iOS,
we're gonna give you the iOS version,

25
00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:31.944
just based off the file extensions.

26
00:01:31.944 --> 00:01:34.330
So that way,
we can declare different styles for

27
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.650
the same component in two files for
two different platforms.

28
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.620
So for Android we obviously want
the styles, so we'll say styles.

29
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.130
And now that's going to
give us the Android one.

30
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.938
And this should still work,
I might have to reload it.

31
00:01:48.938 --> 00:01:52.550
Yeah, yeah, I didn't do this right.

32
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.438
Let's bring this over there too.

33
00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:02.622
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go.

34
00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:09.110
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool and
it still looks exactly the same.

35
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.077
Now for iOS, now if we copy this and
we put this in iOS.

36
00:02:13.077 --> 00:02:17.837
And then we change something like,
let's change this to be blue so

37
00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:22.690
we can see that it's different and
we'll change this to be orange.

38
00:02:25.397 --> 00:02:27.365
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And if I run this in iOS,

39
00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:32.158
react-native run,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I

40
00:02:32.158 --> 00:02:33.571
don't think I had a shortener for that.

41
00:02:36.351 --> 00:02:40.020
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So we run this in iOS,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And

42
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.631
we should see some different styles here.

43
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:50.972
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This one
actually feels kinda fast.

44
00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:00.433
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Little
splash screen action.

45
00:03:03.763 --> 00:03:08.581
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And we get an error
because I didn't update the index to iOS,

46
00:03:10.606 --> 00:03:11.887
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: With whatever is in here so

47
00:03:11.887 --> 00:03:13.292
let's do that right quick.

48
00:03:16.286 --> 00:03:17.677
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go.

49
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.843
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Debug,
Window, Hardware, Shake.

50
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.820
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go, so
now different styles, right.

51
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.748
Cuz we did the .iOS extension
vs the Android extension.

52
00:03:37.748 --> 00:03:40.330
That's pretty clutch, I think.

53
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.040
And that works for
any file you put that extension on.

54
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.830
If you import it, it'll take the extension
off and use it in that specific platform.

55
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.646
So that's another way for
you to do different styles.

56
00:03:50.646 --> 00:03:54.879
And the other way I told you guys
where is you can use, for instance,

57
00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.191
if we were inside these styles here.

58
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:00.800
Let's say this is a generic one and
not just for Android, we can use Platform.

59
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.410
And then platform has a .os,
or maybe its capital OS,

60
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.260
or lowercase, I don't know one of these,
and that's gonna say iOS or Android.

61
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.593
So you can like if Platform.OS
triple equals iOS,

62
00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:21.326
then here are the styles.

63
00:04:21.326 --> 00:04:23.058
If Android, here are the styles,

64
00:04:23.058 --> 00:04:26.780
you can do that too if you just want
it in one file, so that's another way.

65
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.080
And then if you are on Android,
you also get access to version.

66
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.748
So you can see what version of Android
you're on, it'll give you the API level.

67
00:04:33.748 --> 00:04:39.230
So for instance, if this was 21, I think
that's Lollipop or something like that.

68
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.230
So you know what version
of Android you're on.

69
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.460
So you get access to all this stuff, which
is another way for you to create dynamic

70
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.030
properties, dynamic components,
dynamic all types of stuff based on that.

71
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.680
You can also, for instance, for
this component, this Fancy component.

72
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.250
When we brought it into the index here,

73
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.080
we could of used the platform to say hey,
here's the path for

74
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.780
the Fancy component for Android, here's
the path for the Fancy component for iOS.

75
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.610
Bring in the appropriate one
depending on the platform, and

76
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.070
the platform would do that for us.

77
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.000
So you can also do that as well.

78
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.603
So there's so many ways you can
create the different types,

79
00:05:16.603 --> 00:05:18.090
depending on the on the platform.

80
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.184
Any more questions on the styling?

81
00:05:25.184 --> 00:05:26.997
Yo?

82
00:05:26.997 --> 00:05:30.893
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What do you find
the differences to be the most between

83
00:05:30.893 --> 00:05:35.830
Android and iOS as far as do you
generally use the same components and

84
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.868
different style sheets or
same style sheets different components?

85
00:05:40.868 --> 00:05:45.670
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I typically use the same
style sheet cuz it's usually just some

86
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.765
small thing.

87
00:05:46.765 --> 00:05:50.005
It depends on what components you're
using but most of it's just one or

88
00:05:50.005 --> 00:05:51.143
two that's different.

89
00:05:51.143 --> 00:05:56.401
For instance, you saw the text input
needed a default height on iOS.

90
00:05:56.401 --> 00:06:00.159
So I typically just use one style sheet
because the way I think of it is I don't

91
00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:03.000
want my apps to look exactly
the same on both platforms.

92
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.350
I want an Android app to look and
feel like Android app and

93
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.154
I want iOS app to look and
feel like iOS app.

94
00:06:07.154 --> 00:06:10.071
So if I styled them both the same,
then there's gonna be some compromises.

95
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:13.284
So I leave it up to React Native to be
well, this is what the input should look

96
00:06:13.284 --> 00:06:15.739
like on iOS, this is what it
should look like on Android.

97
00:06:15.739 --> 00:06:17.602
And then I'll maybe do
some small overrides,

98
00:06:17.602 --> 00:06:19.780
which only leads me to only have one file.

99
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.490
But if you want the same
experience in everything.

100
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.870
Or if you want two completely
different experiences.

101
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.720
I guess that it all depends.

102
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.970
I like to leave it up to whatever the
platform decides what it should look like.
