00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.408
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.408 --> 00:00:06.590
&gt;&gt; Scott: So
now we need to do a few things.

3
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.710
We need to add a ListView.

4
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.168
I didn't tell you how to make a ListView,
but I wanna make one ListView and

5
00:00:11.168 --> 00:00:14.260
then it's gonna be up to you
to make another ListView.

6
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.260
So the first ListView we need to make
if you look at the designs here are

7
00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:27.168
&gt;&gt; Scott: Sweet, so we look here,

8
00:00:27.168 --> 00:00:31.720
we have this input at the top
with x box here, Xbox [LAUGH].

9
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.860
And then a ListView of
different exercises.

10
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.020
So you can click the exercise and
that's gonna add it to your workout.

11
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.260
So I'm gonna make this ListView and then
the exercise you guys are gonna be doing,

12
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.715
you're gonna do the ListView and
then we'll hook it up to the API.

13
00:00:45.715 --> 00:00:47.770
So let's just do that.

14
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.850
Let's talk about ListViews and
why we need them.

15
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.100
So what we'll do now is we'll
head over to the ExerciseModal,

16
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.780
which is where we'll do the ListView.

17
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.350
And what we want is so right now,

18
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.540
in the modal, all we have is all
those things are still broken.

19
00:01:10.683 --> 00:01:11.410
&gt;&gt; Scott: Go away, go away.

20
00:01:13.926 --> 00:01:15.430
&gt;&gt; Scott: Cool, okay.

21
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.789
So what we want right now,
all we have is a button here, but

22
00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.170
we wanna see what our Topbar
where the input and x, right?

23
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.924
So we wanna put that inside of our modal
first instead of just this button and

24
00:01:25.924 --> 00:01:27.184
then we want a ListView.

25
00:01:27.184 --> 00:01:28.650
So let's just do that.

26
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.816
So we'll put,
we'll lead this view here and

27
00:01:34.816 --> 00:01:40.818
then I will bring in our
Topbar that we made,

28
00:01:40.818 --> 00:01:43.750
I will put that here.

29
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:51.340
&gt;&gt; Scott: And
the Topbar is gonna have an input in it.

30
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.990
So we'll bring in TextInput.

31
00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:15.595
&gt;&gt; Scott: And we'll say TextInput.

32
00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:18.319
Actually now I'm thinking this is
gonna take a while to style and

33
00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.090
I don't really wanna focus on this part.

34
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.117
I really wanna focus on the ListView.

35
00:02:21.117 --> 00:02:26.747
So I'm actually just gonna [COUGH],
I just gonna copy this over, so

36
00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:31.790
we can save some time and
get to the actual important stuff.

37
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.385
So I'm just gonna copy this person here,
search bar, there we go,

38
00:02:37.385 --> 00:02:43.392
so I'm gonna make a new component
right-click called Searchbar.js.

39
00:02:43.392 --> 00:02:47.877
So I'm just going to paste
this stuff right here and

40
00:02:47.877 --> 00:02:53.940
Searchbar is literally just that
component I was just about to make.

41
00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:01.490
It's just a text input in
the Topbar that we're gonna use.

42
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.726
So SearchBbar, export SearchBar

43
00:03:06.726 --> 00:03:12.870
from './SearchBar'; there we go.

44
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.390
And then we'll head back
over to the ExerciseModal.

45
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.860
And we can just put here in
this Topbar what we really

46
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.430
want if you look at the designs.

47
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.350
Is actually there's like a linear gradient
right here with the SearchBar in it.

48
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.824
So let's just do that.

49
00:03:29.824 --> 00:03:34.710
So we'll import the linear gradient
which looks like, where is that?

50
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:44.596
Grab that person, head back over to
a ExerciseModal, import that and

51
00:03:44.596 --> 00:03:49.780
we'll put a linear gradient
right here inside the Topbar.

52
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.031
Cuz remember we can use
all the children here and

53
00:03:53.031 --> 00:03:56.939
this is gonna have the colors
that we'll use in a minute.

54
00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:05.170
&gt;&gt; Scott: And I will go over
the SearchBar right here, there we go.

55
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:12.330
And the SearchBar takes in any properties
you wanna pass to the TextInput.

56
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.520
So whatever you wanna
pass at the TextInput.

57
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:22.280
You just passed there and
that's about it, cool.

58
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.980
So we got that.

59
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.605
Where did it go?
There we go.

60
00:04:27.605 --> 00:04:29.462
So we'll save it and then for the colors,

61
00:04:29.462 --> 00:04:32.020
looks like there's like some
light green to dark green.

62
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.390
I have the exact colors right here

63
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.850
inside of the finished app
on ExerciseModal or no,

64
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.460
ExerciseList, I broke that out so
many abstractions.

65
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.480
I want to get that right there.

66
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.220
So left to right.

67
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.892
There we go.

68
00:04:56.892 --> 00:05:00.284
So LinearGradient allows you to say how
you want the gradient to be left or

69
00:05:00.284 --> 00:05:01.515
right or stuff like that.

70
00:05:01.515 --> 00:05:02.360
So this is breaking news.

71
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.123
I need to do our NPM link.

72
00:05:03.123 --> 00:05:06.620
So let's shot you down.

73
00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.172
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right, so
while this is linking, that was fast,

74
00:05:17.172 --> 00:05:18.340
that was really fast.

75
00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.194
&gt;&gt; Scott: Cool.

76
00:05:25.194 --> 00:05:28.424
So we got this Topbar, we're at the
LinearGradient, we got a SearchBar here.

77
00:05:28.424 --> 00:05:33.110
And now what we want is
when we type in the search.

78
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.370
We want a list of exercises to pop up,
so we can tap on those exercises and

79
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.410
add them to our current workout.

80
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.110
So that's what we wanna do.

81
00:05:47.977 --> 00:05:51.170
&gt;&gt; Scott: SearchBar is not defined,
so I forgot to import it.

82
00:05:58.168 --> 00:06:01.910
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go.

83
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:02.480
Yes?

84
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Whenever you're importing
another file in the same folder,

85
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.790
is there a way to use index?

86
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:09.410
&gt;&gt; Scott: No.

87
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.248
I mean you could go direct
like I say /index and

88
00:06:16.248 --> 00:06:23.213
get it within,
you're already in this folder, so yeah.

89
00:06:23.213 --> 00:06:27.370
Okay, what's going on?

90
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.020
What's going on?

91
00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:31.489
&gt;&gt; Scott: More errors we got.

92
00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:37.884
&gt;&gt; Scott: Let me refresh very quick.

93
00:06:41.393 --> 00:06:42.150
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go.

94
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.800
Okay, cool.

95
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.290
SearchBar is broken because I didn't pass
in the handle text and all that stuff.
