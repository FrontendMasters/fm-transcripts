00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:04.354
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yes, so

3
00:00:04.354 --> 00:00:09.300
like I said there's a ton more different
types of style that you can do.

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.740
So what I want to do for the next exercise
is to actually just style our to do so

5
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.450
it's not unusable,
make it actually usable.

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.380
You know like make a touchable button and
stuff like that.

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.360
Again, I didn't go over
like the styles for

8
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.680
the touch of the highlights like that
because they just inherit from the view,

9
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.870
they're literally just a view, with some
extra stuff so I want to be I want to text

10
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.000
that's pretty much only two things you
need to notice to style that to do that.

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.420
So just how to do outside actually looks
like something you would actually use.

12
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.950
Whatever that looks like and

13
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.640
then we'll go over a solution of how I
might style it and we'll go from there.
