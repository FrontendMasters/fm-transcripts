00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.825
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:05.484
&gt;&gt; Scott: So, by now, this is just a text.

3
00:00:05.484 --> 00:00:08.109
This is just a little text,
this action needs to be another component.

4
00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.470
It's gonna be the current
workout component.

5
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.188
So, what I'm gonna to do is we're
gonna work to build an app, and then,

6
00:00:13.188 --> 00:00:14.450
we're gonna look at the design.

7
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.150
We're gonna look at some of the UI
components that we need to create.

8
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.000
And then, it's gonna be your mission
to create those UI components,

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.250
knowing what you know so far.

10
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.750
So, things like search boxes, and

11
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.560
nav bars, maybe your own buttons if
you want to create those things.

12
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.816
So, first, let's get rid of this text and
instead, we'll use,

13
00:00:32.816 --> 00:00:34.869
we'll come over to our source.

14
00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:36.506
And everything that I'm doing right now,
I'm gonna push up, so,

15
00:00:36.506 --> 00:00:39.290
you'll will be able pull down, and
that's where you're gonna start from.

16
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.560
So, we'll go to our source here,

17
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.128
we'll create a new folder right here
on source, and we'll call it UI.

18
00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:49.227
And then,
we'll also just create a index.js, so,

19
00:00:49.227 --> 00:00:52.427
we can put everything there eventually.

20
00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:55.830
And then,
let's create our first UI component.

21
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.380
I mean, yes, technically, this is
a container, others make it UI for now.

22
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.380
I think it could be either or.

23
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.475
So, I'll say this is gonna be our current

24
00:01:07.837 --> 00:01:12.670
&gt;&gt; Scott: workout.js.

25
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.638
And we'll import reacts, and right now,

26
00:01:17.638 --> 00:01:21.374
we'll just make it stateless.

27
00:01:21.374 --> 00:01:26.207
I will just import

28
00:01:26.207 --> 00:01:30.398
View and Text.

29
00:01:30.398 --> 00:01:35.600
So, View and Text from react-native,
there we go.

30
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.936
And then what I wanna do is just export.

31
00:01:40.936 --> 00:01:47.049
cont current work out which

32
00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.150
is going to be props.

33
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.302
If we can use them right now and was say
it's going to be a view with the text.

34
00:02:02.385 --> 00:02:07.280
&gt;&gt; Scott: This is Current work out.

35
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.280
There you go.

36
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.950
Well it's just plan.

37
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:12.450
Equals.

38
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.180
Sweet.

39
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.300
Is now we have that.

40
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.046
I'm just gonna export a radio index so
I can import it easily.

41
00:02:19.046 --> 00:02:22.700
So exports Current

42
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.450
workout from current workout and
now when I

43
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.960
import I can just import from this UI
folder versus the current workout file.

44
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.648
I'll head back over to
containers to main and

45
00:02:36.648 --> 00:02:41.600
I'll import current workout from UI.

46
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.840
There we go.

47
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.841
And now I just put current work
out here with the tab label.

48
00:02:54.137 --> 00:02:57.070
&gt;&gt; Scott: Plus whatever.

49
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.615
Cool.

50
00:02:57.615 --> 00:03:04.330
So now we're in the current workout.
&gt;&gt; Scott: See that?

51
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.890
Okay, cool.

52
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:06.670
Any course on that.

53
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.140
Why I did that?

54
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.870
I did I was I don't want to just,
this gonna be a big component.

55
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.450
I didn't wanted do inline
inside this template.

56
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.340
Because what if we have
other tabs in here?

57
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.120
And so that means all the JSX [INAUDIBLE]

58
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.280
is gonna be in here along
with all their state.

59
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.100
That's not the whole point.

60
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.650
So let's break that out into
something else, which is what I did.

61
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.080
So if you go look at that
page on current work out.

62
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.900
Here it is right here.

63
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.020
It just says, add some exercises with a
plus So actually a lot more going on here

64
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.150
than just it looks pretty simple but
actually there's a lot of stuff going on.

65
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.800
Once we have a tab, so
we already have that, we're good to go.

66
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.190
Where the tabs or the top of the bottom.

67
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.590
That's a row of it is
a property to change that.

68
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.510
I decided to put on the bottom and
if you want to do that.

69
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.050
I'm sure you looked already used but
tab are positioned and

70
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.789
used but bottom up an overlay
bottom to make it transparent.

71
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.020
So overlapBottom places it on
the bottom and transparent.

72
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.940
But anyway, lots of going to our first.

73
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.660
There's this little navigation bar,
header bar that we don't have here.

74
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.160
This is not here.

75
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.560
So we're going to make that and

76
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.620
the reason we need to make that is because
we're also gonna to have it here as well.

77
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.280
There it is again, this time it
has a search bar inside of it.

78
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.750
So we need to make sure it really
gonna use it in two places

79
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.830
perfect example of a UI components.

80
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.530
You will be making that.

81
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.470
The second thing here is it says as
an exercise and there's a plus sign.

82
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.270
So what that means is with
there were exercises.

83
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.510
This probably won't show up or

84
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.410
maybe exercise will be above it in
this will just show beneath it.

85
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.990
So I need this need to know about
the current work out somehow And

86
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.820
then render them and
if not have a way for you to add them.

87
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.160
Right?
So that's what we need to do and

88
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.180
if we go look what we did a long
time ago when we first set up we

89
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.500
already got a reduce everything set up for
the work out pretty awesome.

90
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.430
We already have this stuff set up
to get the work out and stuff and

91
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.930
there's already an API db.jason
that has a current work out

92
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.590
We gonna o use to store
the current work out of fetch it.

93
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.080
So what we need to do now is find a way to

94
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.750
put that all up before we do that we need
to go ahead and create those components.

95
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.060
That's going to be on the page when we do
have that A-P-I So with those components

96
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.150
are going to be again if you look
at the U-I just one more time/

97
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.200
We need a component that's going to say
you know when you add some exercises and

98
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.400
when you click on it,
It's gonna to do something.

99
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.970
What that something is
that's a relevant yet,

100
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.640
we'll hook up that later it's
just gonna launch this Moto here.

101
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.250
If you wanna look ahead the docs and
figure out how to launch that mode,

102
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.950
you can totally do it but
we'll do it later.

103
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.240
We also need to make this little bar at
the top that just says current work out,

104
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.120
and we need to bring that in and make
it always on top And again it needs to

105
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.640
be pretty reusable because we wanna be
able to use it here but you see now

106
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.910
this one has like a left or right gradient
on it with a nav bar inside of it.

107
00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.670
So how would you make
a composer that's reusable?

108
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.070
We'll go over that in just a second.

109
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.490
And then we also need to have like,
I'm gonna leave this part up to you your

110
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.570
imagination the actual lists Of
the workouts after you add them.

111
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.980
So what they're gonna look like.

112
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.460
So basically if you go look here.

113
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.440
There's a list of workout
some similar to this.

114
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.950
However you want that
to look like we need to

115
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.460
if we tap on a workout it needs to be
added to the list here and that's it.
