00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.922
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.922 --> 00:00:08.864
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'm kinda interested in more
like the big picture for React Native and

3
00:00:08.864 --> 00:00:10.380
history with React.

4
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.860
So I'm just wondering,
how is Facebook involved and

5
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.700
what's the big picture surrounding these
technologies of React and React Native?

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.805
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Who's involved and all that?

7
00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:26.934
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So Facebook made React and
they also made React Native.

8
00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:28.644
So React was their solution for

9
00:00:28.644 --> 00:00:31.680
their web problems that they
were facing on Facebook.

10
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.490
They needed something fast so
they made React.

11
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.422
A few years later, they were like, wait,
you know what, React is actually really

12
00:00:37.422 --> 00:00:41.030
cool how to make components, what if
we could make mobile UIs like that too?

13
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.520
That would be great but
we want them to be native.

14
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.550
So they made React Native for iOS,

15
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.100
which just took the syntax of making
components and converted it over to iOS.

16
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.700
And they built their Facebook Ads
app with it or Facebook Groups.

17
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.020
One of those apps they built with
React Native, so they're all behind it.

18
00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.940
It's their baby.

19
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.190
It's open source though,
anybody can contribute to it.

20
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.600
But most of the heavy hitters
on React are at Facebook, and

21
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.060
if not they're probably trying
to hire them right now.

22
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.870
Like the guy who made Redux,
they hired him.

23
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.252
Like come over here,
come over here and work with us.

24
00:01:11.252 --> 00:01:13.639
So yeah, it's all Facebook's thing,

25
00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:17.653
I think the big picture is they want
to spread this React ecosystem.

26
00:01:17.653 --> 00:01:21.097
They are truly invested in how
React builds components, and

27
00:01:21.097 --> 00:01:23.404
they think it's the best way out there.

28
00:01:23.404 --> 00:01:27.018
And they want to get it available
on every platform possible, and

29
00:01:27.018 --> 00:01:29.660
it's a really good way
to build applications.

30
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.310
A lot of frameworks today
are influenced by React,

31
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.610
like Angular 2 is heavily
influenced by React.

32
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.648
React came out with this virtual
DOM thing and changed the game, and

33
00:01:37.648 --> 00:01:41.680
people were just like wow, why did we
not think of that, that's amazing.

34
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.414
So they're just trying to get that
on many places as possible, and

35
00:01:45.414 --> 00:01:48.481
Facebook tried to do the hybrid
web approach before and

36
00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:52.160
Mark Zuckerberg was like no,
this is actually horrible.

37
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.726
So they wanted go back to native and
this is what their solution was.

38
00:01:55.726 --> 00:02:01.009
So the big picture is, let's get React
to be the universal language for

39
00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.630
building UIs,
that what they're trying to do.

40
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.802
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So would you call React and
Angular competitors?

41
00:02:09.802 --> 00:02:10.335
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Actually,

42
00:02:10.335 --> 00:02:14.341
I wouldn't say they're competitors because
they actually work together pretty well.

43
00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:17.474
They meet all the time and
they learn from each other.

44
00:02:17.474 --> 00:02:22.393
But you could, actually Angular is more
of a platform than it is a framework,

45
00:02:22.393 --> 00:02:27.480
whereas React is more like, here's
a view library, create some components.

46
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.141
Angular is like you can create your
components, here's your HTTP library,

47
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:34.818
here's your testing framework,
here's every single thing else you need.

48
00:02:34.818 --> 00:02:36.610
You don't have to install anything,
here's your animations.

49
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.800
What else do you need?

50
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.600
We have it.

51
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.970
Whereas React is not that,
itâ€™s just a view library.

52
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.346
So Angular to me, Angular 2 at least,
to me is more like React Native.

53
00:02:45.346 --> 00:02:48.239
Whereas React Native is a platform,
it gives you everything,

54
00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.470
Angular 2 is like that,
it's a platform that gives you everything.

55
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.894
Whereas React for the web is actually
just more like a library to me.

56
00:02:54.894 --> 00:02:57.260
It's just like here's
a way to write components,

57
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.110
figure everything else out yourself.

58
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.775
And that's it.
Yeah.

59
00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:05.908
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Anything else?

60
00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:11.811
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No, anything else, so
was this stuff pretty simple today,

61
00:03:11.811 --> 00:03:13.575
as far as like the components,
React Native?

62
00:03:13.575 --> 00:03:18.457
People who knew React, was it pretty
simple coming in to just doing this or

63
00:03:18.457 --> 00:03:22.408
was it like wow,
this is completely different than React?

64
00:03:22.408 --> 00:03:24.424
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think it's a game changer.

65
00:03:24.424 --> 00:03:27.950
I think if you wanted to,
you could write an app a day.

66
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.928
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Exactly, it's again, when I
first started writing native, I was like,

67
00:03:30.928 --> 00:03:31.839
I didn't believe it.

68
00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:33.740
I thought,
I was like something's not right.

69
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.557
Like this isn't happening,
I didn't just make this.

70
00:03:36.557 --> 00:03:37.330
It felt weird.

71
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.269
I thought it was like a cat like
I'm waiting for them to say, but

72
00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.875
you can't publish these apps on apps.org
cuz they won't, I was waiting for

73
00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:47.050
them to say something like that but
no, it's really that simple.

74
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.566
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And the legitimacy there is
like that, yeah, Facebook Ads Manager and

75
00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:55.030
some big Facebook apps
are actually on React Native and

76
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.100
they've been in React Native for
a long time.

77
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.800
So if they would have hit major hurdles,
they would have rolled it back.

78
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.810
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And bring something

79
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.570
different but they're still on it for
quite a while.

80
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.330
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, that's definitely the
big thing, knowing that a big company like

81
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.692
Facebook is using this in
production themselves is like whoa,

82
00:04:10.692 --> 00:04:13.470
okay, this is actually something and
they've been doing it for a while.

83
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.270
Actually, if you go look
at their showcase page,

84
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.496
there are tons of actually really good
apps on the React Native Showcase,

85
00:04:20.496 --> 00:04:26.900
some really, really, really, really
good stuff for some top name companies.

86
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.160
So here's all the Facebook stuff.

87
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.803
These are all really good.

88
00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:31.550
There's actually
a tutorial how to do this.

89
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.200
There's a virtual reality
app built in React Native.

90
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.040
So this shows you what's possible there.

91
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.891
SoundCloud.

92
00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:44.839
There was actually this one that does,
yeah,

93
00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:48.063
this one right here which I
was really impressed by which

94
00:04:48.063 --> 00:04:53.110
does Snapchat-like filters and
stuff, and this is in React Native.

95
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.318
So they had to use Web GL
to do this stuff but

96
00:04:56.318 --> 00:05:00.008
still, like amazing, in React Native, wow.

97
00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:01.310
Okay, that's pretty.

98
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,
there was like Web GL bindings.

99
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.828
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
they have Web GL bindings and

100
00:05:04.828 --> 00:05:07.059
stuff where you can really do
everything in React Native.

101
00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:08.953
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Would that be in
a web view or is it in some?

102
00:05:08.953 --> 00:05:10.490
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No, no, it's native.

103
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.626
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's native.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It's native, yeah,

104
00:05:11.626 --> 00:05:13.140
they got the native GL bindings.

105
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Open GL, I'm sorry.

106
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.440
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, Open GL, yeah, yeah.

107
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.190
Open GL, yeah.

108
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.534
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
it will use the virtual DOM kind of

109
00:05:20.534 --> 00:05:25.346
thing approach with Web GL objects or
components.

110
00:05:25.346 --> 00:05:25.874
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah.

111
00:05:25.874 --> 00:05:27.459
So it's pretty legit.

112
00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:31.508
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So would something
like 3JS be able to wrap that or.

113
00:05:31.508 --> 00:05:34.073
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Actually, I'll show you.

114
00:05:34.073 --> 00:05:37.527
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, 3 is Web GL so
that would be in a web view.

115
00:05:37.527 --> 00:05:38.181
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah.

116
00:05:38.181 --> 00:05:42.784
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But yeah,
Open GL, React Native so.

117
00:05:42.784 --> 00:05:44.033
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So this one.

118
00:05:46.737 --> 00:05:50.875
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And this is all just the,
he's doing filters right here,

119
00:05:50.875 --> 00:05:53.230
it's ridiculous.

120
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.740
And it's all just React Native.

121
00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.054
So, yeah, stuff like this is just
like what, what, this is crazy.

122
00:06:00.054 --> 00:06:02.240
But yeah, they got a lot of
cool stuff on the showcase.

123
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.202
Now a lot of these actually, some of them
are open source, you can go look like,

124
00:06:06.202 --> 00:06:08.865
the Facebook team actually
open sourced its F8 app,

125
00:06:08.865 --> 00:06:10.624
you can go look at the source code.

126
00:06:10.624 --> 00:06:13.735
I actually learned a lot about
React Native by looking at this code,

127
00:06:13.735 --> 00:06:16.180
cuz this code was written by
the people who made React Native,

128
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.370
so they knew all types of stuff that
I didn't know about, really good.
