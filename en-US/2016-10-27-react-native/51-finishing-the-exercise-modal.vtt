00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.877
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.877 --> 00:00:05.908
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So now we actually
go ahead and provide the props and

3
00:00:05.908 --> 00:00:07.450
hold all this stuff up.

4
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.800
So when we start typing and
we'll see some stuff pop up.

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.580
So the first thing is
the search bar on text change.

6
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.300
So this is going to be
like a fuzzy search so

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.420
as we're typing, we wanna be able to
see the different exercises show up

8
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.000
From this initial state.So we
have all these exercises here.

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.230
And as we start typing, we wanna see
which ones we type with a fuzzy search.

10
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.700
So what we can do there is actually just
make a quick search implementation for

11
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.010
us and
we're going to use that right quick.

12
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.200
Let's head back here.

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.520
I'm just gonna copy it because
it's implementation detail.

14
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.060
If you wanna look at it it's
in the it's in the source.

15
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.500
So it's really not going to
really cover over really quick.

16
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.550
So what to do this and
we'll make a new folder

17
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.748
called services and
I'll make a new file called fuzzy.

18
00:00:59.748 --> 00:01:01.084
Not that.

19
00:01:01.084 --> 00:01:05.780
[LAUGH] that was paste around there.

20
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's really fuzzy.

21
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.700
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: That was really fuzzy.

22
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.910
See, so this is gonna take a predicate a
list of terms you want to search over and

23
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.910
then a property on those terms and
its gonna do a fussy search.

24
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.964
So we say we got that.

25
00:01:20.728 --> 00:01:27.430
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So head back to the current
or I'm sorry the exercise model.

26
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.930
There we go.

27
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.004
So now that we have that what we can do is
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We just want to go ahead

28
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:35.532
and include that fuzzy search in here.

29
00:01:45.528 --> 00:01:47.600
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go.

30
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.800
And then now what we're gonna
do is when we pass in the text

31
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.830
what the exercise is that we wanna search
on this is gonna pass back a new list of

32
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.984
exercises that we can pass in.

33
00:01:56.984 --> 00:02:00.330
So with that being said is we just
need to actually do a connect.

34
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.300
So we can connect here or
we can connect and current work out.

35
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.900
Looks like we're already connected and
current work out.

36
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.360
Let's go ahead pick back off this and pass
in the supply details to exercise model.

37
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.649
So I exercises modal
also needs the exercises.

38
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.110
We'll just imagine that if there
was a to stop prop start exercises.

39
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.022
So let's go ahead and do that and
do that it's actually really

40
00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:32.650
easy to come up to this function
here a map state of props and

41
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.353
we say exercises and
we want state exercises.

42
00:02:36.353 --> 00:02:40.180
That's it we know that's there
every go look at the reduce or.

43
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.940
There is exercises which is
the initial state which is this file.

44
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.890
So there's exercises
already there done and

45
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.920
all we have to deal with this say that and
pass it.

46
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.740
Now we have exercises we can come
back over here and we can say cons.

47
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.563
Found or actually to do a state.

48
00:03:16.923 --> 00:03:20.080
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Foundexercises,
let's make that an empty array.

49
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.910
and it will do is we'll say so on text
change every time we type will say this

50
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:32.430
dot set state of found
exercises to be the fuzzy.

51
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.920
Search and fuzzy search takes and
the predicate which is the text The list

52
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.557
you wanna search over which
is this dots are the props,

53
00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:49.310
exercise and then the property of
those objects which is a name.

54
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.410
So let's return a new or a force
that we're gonna set the state with.

55
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.120
So we got that and we need to have a-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Paperback obit of

56
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.270
exercise this month.

57
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.590
Constructor Exercises.

58
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.570
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: foundExercises.

59
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.530
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Exercises is spelled wrong.

60
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.160
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Dang.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's spelled

61
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.860
wrong both places.

62
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.518
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Two c's.

63
00:04:09.518 --> 00:04:12.786
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: They should just change it.

64
00:04:12.786 --> 00:04:13.700
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: They should
just change the name.

65
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.010
They should put a C there.

66
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.570
Exercises.

67
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You're missing an S too.

68
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.078
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Exer, exer,

69
00:04:21.078 --> 00:04:25.513
so this is wow

70
00:04:25.513 --> 00:04:30.870
that was hard.

71
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.370
Sizes.

72
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.720
Why is that word so hard, is it just me?

73
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.812
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No no,
that thing don't seem to work.

74
00:04:37.812 --> 00:04:40.390
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: [LAUGH] My God
like what is, this is hard.

75
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.420
Okay.

76
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.770
There we go.

77
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.318
So how do we do is,

78
00:04:46.318 --> 00:04:50.816
we pass in exercises,

79
00:04:50.816 --> 00:04:56.261
this gonna do this dot state

80
00:04:56.261 --> 00:05:01.749
dot file exercises quote.

81
00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:05.230
So let's run this And
no creeping around out.

82
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.130
Don't launch.

83
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.393
Please don't launch.

84
00:05:08.393 --> 00:05:09.251
Okay.

85
00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:16.080
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It's coming.

86
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:24.430
That's low this thing Other debugger is
still active things probably pause and

87
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.450
everything have been saving so
many errors about is so broken right now.

88
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.170
I guarantee this thing has a look at it.

89
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.090
Yeah it's over.

90
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:37.630
Okay let's quit that.

91
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.014
We are getting deep.

92
00:05:46.742 --> 00:05:47.833
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Into list views.

93
00:05:59.978 --> 00:06:00.478
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Stop.

94
00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:10.321
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right, so let this
build again then we'll hop back in it.

95
00:06:10.321 --> 00:06:19.973
And we'll let it booting up
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It's coming.

96
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.670
So any question on a list
view while we're here at all.

97
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.521
We went over it super fast, but I'm
gonna put this up so you can look at it.

98
00:06:27.521 --> 00:06:31.079
Because I didn't wanna stress
on like how different it is.

99
00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:34.295
I just wanted to be simple,
cuz it really is a sum.

100
00:06:34.295 --> 00:06:40.112
We just got a modify the data source,
was just there.

101
00:06:40.112 --> 00:06:40.808
That's all you gotta do.

102
00:06:43.165 --> 00:06:46.795
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There's tons of other
project passing over optimizations, but

103
00:06:46.795 --> 00:06:49.109
this is pretty much it past a data source.

104
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.160
And how to render the row you can but
you can do like a sticky header or

105
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.730
a sticky footer.

106
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.130
Pretty pretty cool stuff.

107
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.091
But for
right now this is all we're going to do.

108
00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:05.780
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right.

109
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.519
Looks like that's running so
let's boot this up again.

110
00:07:12.792 --> 00:07:15.400
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I wanna turn
out the remote to bugger.

111
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.050
And then it's gonna break
I'm actually gonna need it.

112
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.746
[LAUGH]

113
00:07:32.583 --> 00:07:34.073
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go,

114
00:07:34.073 --> 00:07:37.199
dataSource, there we go.

115
00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:42.484
Okay, stop

116
00:07:42.484 --> 00:07:47.770
all right.

117
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.030
Let's only decide it into expressions and

118
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.800
exercise most of us I forgot to put
something and there they are text changed.

119
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.168
So we want to say
the start had no texting.

120
00:07:58.168 --> 00:08:03.130
There we go.

121
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.740
What else you got.

122
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.320
Okay exercise list.

123
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.540
I expect it's okay if I turn.

124
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.390
What the response.

125
00:08:23.463 --> 00:08:25.018
Hm.

126
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:35.120
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I don't know
what they're talking about.

127
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.850
Wow.
[LAUGH] Another silly moment.

128
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.037
Okay, let this thing render it.

129
00:08:53.938 --> 00:08:54.785
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Come on.

130
00:08:58.279 --> 00:08:59.336
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay.

131
00:09:08.902 --> 00:09:12.646
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Not sure why that's
not rendering or throwing an error or

132
00:09:12.646 --> 00:09:13.429
anything.

133
00:09:13.429 --> 00:09:22.703
Let's just stop it started there,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There

134
00:09:22.703 --> 00:09:24.470
we go now there an error.

135
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.180
I can't find components.

136
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.860
Whenever I switched to a new components
I forgot to put component guarantee.

137
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:33.950
Probably an exercise list.

138
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.852
No probably ExercizeModal.

139
00:09:36.852 --> 00:09:37.502
Yeah.

140
00:09:47.289 --> 00:09:48.910
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
I know I just fixed you reload yourself.

141
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:54.800
Now it's stuck in a loop.

142
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.300
No.

143
00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:02.360
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: My God.

144
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.160
It just killed itself.
