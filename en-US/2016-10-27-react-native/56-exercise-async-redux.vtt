[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:07.185
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So now what you're gonna do
inside the app, if you pull it down from

3
00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:13.396
the branch that I pushed up, which was
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: What was it?

4
00:00:16.235 --> 00:00:16.973
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah.

5
00:00:16.973 --> 00:00:20.510
If you put on the list-view-solution,
which is the solution we just did,

6
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.880
right now we took that action to
add exercise and it is just static.

7
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.143
You need to switch it over to where
it actually talk to the server.

8
00:00:26.143 --> 00:00:30.440
And then there's already a db.json,
just do json server db.json, and

9
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.083
start that port 3000.

10
00:00:32.083 --> 00:00:36.390
And you need to actually create exactly
what we did it, create if you go to,

11
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.210
let's just go look at it, I'll show you.

12
00:00:48.227 --> 00:00:51.332
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So,
if you go to ActionCreators, dang,

13
00:00:51.332 --> 00:00:53.387
did I leave those in there?

14
00:00:54.728 --> 00:00:56.970
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Looks like I left
them in there already for you.

15
00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.710
But you still got to use them.

16
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.980
Okay, so already in there, [LAUGH] but

17
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.940
I'm actually using this
really cool abstraction.

18
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.320
That's really cool, you can check it out.

19
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.240
It's in services/AsyncCreators.

20
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.864
So I made it a generic function that will
take a starting action and in the action,

21
00:01:16.864 --> 00:01:20.202
and then async function, and
it will dispatch it for you.

22
00:01:20.202 --> 00:01:24.133
It'll dispatch the startAction then
it will run the async function,

23
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:28.797
then it'll get the result of the async
function, and it'd dispatch the EndAction

24
00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:33.120
with the result of that async function and
also any possible errors.

25
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.300
So it's very generic.

26
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.401
So I use that inside the AsyncCreators
to just create AsyncCreator, like that.

27
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:42.702
Start action, into action,
function to run.

28
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.960
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: But
I'm actually just gonna get rid of this.

29
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.845
So you can't use it.

30
00:01:49.845 --> 00:01:52.916
[LAUGH] No, I'm not gonna do that.

31
00:01:52.916 --> 00:01:58.425
Yeah, totally use this and what you need
to do now is actually bring this into,

32
00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:00.530
if you go to CurrentWorkout.

33
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.130
Right now those methods right here,
addExercise, it's static.

34
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.883
So instead of dispatching the static at
exercise method, you need to dispatch

35
00:02:09.883 --> 00:02:14.530
the async at exercise.1 which is
called addExerciseToCurrentWorkout.

36
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.635
So you need to dispatched that and
then you also need to go ahead and

37
00:02:17.635 --> 00:02:20.460
fetch the current workout too
when the app first loads up.

38
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.517
Cuz right now when it first loads up,
it's not gonna do anything,

39
00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:24.290
it's like there are no workouts.

40
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.420
So you need to fetch the current workout.

41
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.100
So that means you need to go back
into current workout here and

42
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.230
somewhere in here,
looks like it's already commented out.

43
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.680
You just need to fetch
the current workout.

44
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.650
So you need to add that action
to your map to action props.

45
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.916
And then somewhere like componentDidMount,

46
00:02:41.916 --> 00:02:44.597
you want to call that action
to fetch all the workouts.

47
00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:49.008
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So convert the addExercise
to use the async version and

48
00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:52.450
then refresh the current workouts when
current workout component loads up.
