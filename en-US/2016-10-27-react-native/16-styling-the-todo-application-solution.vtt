00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.878
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.878 --> 00:00:07.460
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So let's just walk
through how I might style this thing.

3
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.371
So what we'll do first is,
we'll head over to Android and

4
00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:15.791
iOS and we'll change this back to Todo.

5
00:00:15.791 --> 00:00:17.552
And we'll do the same thing in iOS.

6
00:00:21.264 --> 00:00:24.270
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Todo, okay, cool.

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.706
So we got that, let me just reload this.

8
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:32.252
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: What?

9
00:00:32.252 --> 00:00:35.925
I still have that error up in Todo, do I?

10
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:39.118
Yeah.

11
00:00:46.318 --> 00:00:47.900
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go, okay, sweet.

12
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.950
So we have our Todo here, which yours may
or may not look similar starting off.

13
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.190
So let's just walk through
some of this stuff.

14
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.501
So I'm thinking it probably
makes sense to put the input and

15
00:00:56.501 --> 00:00:58.101
the button on the same line.

16
00:00:58.101 --> 00:00:59.400
So let's just do that.

17
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.090
And what we can do is, we can wrap the
button and input inside of another view.

18
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.490
And we'll put those in there.

19
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.362
And what we can do is,
we can style this view as a form.

20
00:01:13.362 --> 00:01:14.826
So that's what I'll call it.

21
00:01:14.826 --> 00:01:18.545
We'll say styles.form.

22
00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.339
And then what that's gonna look like is,
first,

23
00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:22.010
we actually need to create some styles.

24
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.165
So I'll say const styles =.

25
00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:31.708
Actually, let's just keep the same thing
we had with the two different files here,

26
00:01:31.708 --> 00:01:32.660
actually.

27
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.223
No, no, no, we'll do it right here,
we'll do it here.

28
00:01:35.223 --> 00:01:39.939
So const styles = StyleSheet.create.

29
00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.516
And I need to make sure I
got StyleSheet up here.

30
00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:46.005
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go.

31
00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:49.907
And then for the form, because
everything is flexed by default, but

32
00:01:49.907 --> 00:01:52.040
I want it to be on the same row.

33
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.450
So I will have to say flexDirection.

34
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.440
Did anybody else use this, flexDirection?

35
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.168
And change it to row, cuz by default,
flexDirection is a column, so

36
00:02:01.168 --> 00:02:02.820
everything stacks up.

37
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.426
But if I go to row,
it'll go to horizontal.

38
00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:09.160
So flexDirection: 'row'.

39
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.830
I'll save that.

40
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.040
And now they're on the same row.

41
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.530
So this is here, this is here.

42
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.040
But they're actually not quite
exactly like I want them to.

43
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.375
So what I'll do now is, I want the text
input to be about, I don't know,

44
00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:26.661
70% percent of the row and
the button to be the rest.

45
00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:32.489
So what I can do now is,
I'll give this one a style of,

46
00:02:34.227 --> 00:02:38.520
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: styles.input.

47
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.650
And I'll give, no, that's the button.

48
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.712
I'll give the input
the value of styles.input.

49
00:02:45.712 --> 00:02:50.315
And then the button will be styles.button.

50
00:02:50.315 --> 00:02:54.071
So we do that, and then I'll come
out here and I'll say input.

51
00:02:56.413 --> 00:03:00.368
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
we could say a flex: 0.7.

52
00:03:00.368 --> 00:03:05.513
And then button:

53
00:03:05.513 --> 00:03:10.317
flex: 0.3.

54
00:03:10.317 --> 00:03:12.263
And there we go.

55
00:03:12.263 --> 00:03:16.367
So now this is flexed about 70%
instead of the rest of the 30%.

56
00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:21.100
This is too far on the edge here, so
let's just give this some padding.

57
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.610
So we'll make a container here.

58
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.512
So we'll say styles.container.

59
00:03:29.512 --> 00:03:31.860
And for the container,
we'll just add some padding.

60
00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:38.529
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We'll say a flex: 1 first,
and

61
00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:43.254
then some padding of like 20.

62
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.719
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go, a lot better.

63
00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.231
So now we got some padding.

64
00:03:48.231 --> 00:03:50.409
This is starting to look a lot better.

65
00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.283
This button doesn't really
look like a button.

66
00:03:52.283 --> 00:03:55.920
Looks like some word that's just floating,
so let's fix that.

67
00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.996
So what we can do for that is,
let's give it a borderWidth: 1.

68
00:04:01.996 --> 00:04:05.473
And then a borderColor of,

69
00:04:05.473 --> 00:04:10.620
let's just go with a lightgrey for now.

70
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.151
Or let's do a blue.

71
00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.180
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So we got that.

72
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.423
So that's blue, still not there yet.

73
00:04:18.423 --> 00:04:22.350
Let's do a borderRadius: 3.

74
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.460
And then we'll also
justifyContent: 'center'.

75
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.740
And alignItems: 'center'.

76
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.850
So that'll center the word in there for
us.

77
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.890
There we go, so we got that.

78
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.098
Button's looking more like a button.

79
00:04:40.098 --> 00:04:48.031
Let's give it a height: 30.

80
00:04:48.031 --> 00:04:51.577
No, that's too low, more like 50.

81
00:04:51.577 --> 00:04:54.060
There we go, sweet.

82
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.640
So it's getting a lot better.

83
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.370
Now let's actually style
the text in the button.

84
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.582
So what we can do is,
you can go that TouchableOpacity or

85
00:05:00.582 --> 00:05:02.381
whatever touchable element you have there.

86
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:06.435
And we'll give it a style of

87
00:05:06.435 --> 00:05:11.554
styles.text, or a buttonText.

88
00:05:13.795 --> 00:05:15.665
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go,
and then we'll come down here.

89
00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:17.489
And we'll say buttonText.

90
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.296
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
we will make this a fontSize: 24.

91
00:05:28.085 --> 00:05:31.769
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
we'll say fontWeight: 'bold'.

92
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.750
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool,
I guess that's a button.

93
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.356
So okay, there we go.

94
00:05:43.356 --> 00:05:44.980
The input, let's look at the input now.

95
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.020
Input's kinda small, so
we'll change that, too.

96
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.070
So we'll give this the same
fontSize: 24 as the button does.

97
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.574
There we go.

98
00:05:58.436 --> 00:06:03.273
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: That will just

99
00:06:03.273 --> 00:06:04.330
work for now.

100
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.304
Great, and now, if we actually type
some stuff in and we hit Enter,

101
00:06:09.304 --> 00:06:12.376
we'll see that it just pushes over here.

102
00:06:12.376 --> 00:06:14.830
What is this, did I say that somewhere?

103
00:06:16.897 --> 00:06:18.435
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Where is that at?

104
00:06:24.214 --> 00:06:27.602
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: sd,
it's just a module reloader.

105
00:06:27.602 --> 00:06:29.676
It's got old state.

106
00:06:31.878 --> 00:06:34.574
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Just sometimes,
you just gotta reload it.

107
00:06:34.574 --> 00:06:35.410
[LAUGH] There we go.

108
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:40.464
Okay, so now, when we add some stuff,
it's right here.

109
00:06:40.464 --> 00:06:46.107
It's kinda gross, so what we'll do now is,
let's add some padding on.

110
00:06:46.107 --> 00:06:48.841
Or actually, let's add some
margin on this view right here,

111
00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:51.160
which is the view that's
gonna have the list.

112
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:58.540
So we'll call this one
style={styles.todos}.

113
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.633
That'll be our todos.

114
00:07:00.633 --> 00:07:01.873
We'll come down here.

115
00:07:05.882 --> 00:07:11.068
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: todos,
and we'll just give it

116
00:07:11.068 --> 00:07:16.257
a marginTop: 30, or more.

117
00:07:16.257 --> 00:07:20.946
How about 60, something like that?

118
00:07:20.946 --> 00:07:23.153
Yeah, that'll work, so there we go.

119
00:07:23.153 --> 00:07:25.335
And then, while we're down here,
we'll just make another one for the todo,

120
00:07:25.335 --> 00:07:26.209
what that's gonna look like.

121
00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:30.643
And that's just gonna have

122
00:07:30.643 --> 00:07:35.847
a borderBottomWidth: 1, and

123
00:07:35.847 --> 00:07:41.051
then a borderBottomColor, and

124
00:07:41.051 --> 00:07:46.461
we'll just put 'lightgrey'.

125
00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:47.720
So we'll do that.

126
00:07:50.429 --> 00:07:57.938
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then now, on this text
right here, we can put style={todo}.

127
00:07:57.938 --> 00:07:59.790
Actually, this isn't gonna work on a text.

128
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.020
It's gonna break, actually,
because we can't put borders on text.

129
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.187
But let's just check it out.

130
00:08:04.187 --> 00:08:09.470
Yep, probably gotta wrap this in a view,
which is probably more appropriate.

131
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.410
Wait, I think I did do it, that's cool.

132
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.160
No, wait, I didn't do a border.

133
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.647
Yeah, so what I'll have to do is,
I'll have to wrap this in a view itself.

134
00:08:17.647 --> 00:08:22.603
So we'll say View and
then put that in there.

135
00:08:24.151 --> 00:08:25.691
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And this will be a style.

136
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:33.231
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: sytles.todo,
and this'll be todoText.

137
00:08:33.231 --> 00:08:36.951
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go,
so we got that.

138
00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:38.651
And we can head back down here.

139
00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:43.535
And for todo, let's do a marginBottom: 10.

140
00:08:45.848 --> 00:08:50.228
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then for the todoText,

141
00:08:50.228 --> 00:08:55.757
well let's do a fontSize: 24.

142
00:08:55.757 --> 00:08:58.207
There we go.

143
00:08:58.207 --> 00:09:01.951
So now we actually have a not so
ugly-looking,

144
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:07.160
still would never use this or
launch it in the App Store.

145
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.527
But it's not so bad now,
compared to what it used to be.

146
00:09:12.628 --> 00:09:15.054
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool,
any questions on styling?

147
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:23.386
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Who thinks they had a
really legit-looking todo app that's ready

148
00:09:23.386 --> 00:09:24.449
for funding?

149
00:09:24.449 --> 00:09:26.923
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: [LAUGH] Uh-huh, yeah, and

150
00:09:26.923 --> 00:09:29.268
this is just freaking out, obviously.

151
00:09:29.268 --> 00:09:34.917
Cuz I didn't put the key back on
the the root that's being iterated over.

152
00:09:34.917 --> 00:09:39.720
So the key belongs on the view now and
not the actual text.

153
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.160
So that's why that was freaking out.

154
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.294
But you could just dismiss that.

155
00:09:43.294 --> 00:09:48.051
If you don't wanna see those, another
shortcut is, you can just come in here,

156
00:09:48.051 --> 00:09:50.757
in Dev Settings, and
just turn Dev Mode off.

157
00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:52.949
It'll get rid of it.

158
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:54.430
But I'm gonna keep it on.

159
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.500
Cool, any other questions on styles?

160
00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.360
Obviously, that's not all the styles.

161
00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.637
But you can get away with about
80% of styling with just view and

162
00:10:01.637 --> 00:10:03.135
text inside of React Native.

163
00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:08.877
The other stuff is specific to
the components, but mostly view and text.

164
00:10:08.877 --> 00:10:13.557
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What about making stuff look
like native, controls and stuff like that?

165
00:10:13.557 --> 00:10:16.510
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, so if you want stuff
to look like native, there's two ways.

166
00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:22.024
One, hopefully,
the React team will compile just the base,

167
00:10:22.024 --> 00:10:26.985
like, for instance, what's a good version?

168
00:10:26.985 --> 00:10:31.051
Yeah, so if we use Switch.

169
00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:33.889
So we use Switch here.

170
00:10:33.889 --> 00:10:36.845
Come here, get out of there.

171
00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:40.657
And you put a Switch, let's say, here.

172
00:10:44.754 --> 00:10:46.737
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I knew
it was gonna do that.

173
00:10:51.496 --> 00:10:54.768
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So we put a Switch in here.

174
00:10:54.768 --> 00:10:56.950
See, it's the native Android Switch.

175
00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.477
This is not the native iOS one.

176
00:10:59.477 --> 00:11:02.288
This is a Material Design Switch
native for Android, all right?

177
00:11:02.288 --> 00:11:05.443
So most of the components that
React Native provides for you,

178
00:11:05.443 --> 00:11:10.009
the UI components, are gonna be the native
implementation with some small difference.

179
00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:11.249
Like, for instance, the input here,

180
00:11:11.249 --> 00:11:12.910
the input in iOS doesn't
look like this at all.

181
00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.648
This is definitely the Android input,

182
00:11:14.648 --> 00:11:18.770
it's a Material Design input, whereas
the iOS input looks completely different.

183
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.113
But then you have things like
TouchableOpacity that is nothing,

184
00:11:22.113 --> 00:11:23.640
you gotta style it yourself.

185
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.710
Now, if you wanna make it look like that,

186
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.260
a lot of people have made a lot of
libraries that just give you all

187
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:35.050
the styles to make it look just
like iOS 9 or Android Lollipop.

188
00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:39.472
I think, when it comes down to that, you
just need to design a really nice global

189
00:11:39.472 --> 00:11:43.900
theme and figure out if you want things
look different on different platforms.

190
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.296
And maybe you don't, maybe you do.

191
00:11:46.296 --> 00:11:48.590
You can, like I said,
leave it up to React Native to do it.

192
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.091
But ultimately, you're just gonna
have to style it yourself or

193
00:11:51.091 --> 00:11:54.100
find some other implementation
that does it for you.

194
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.780
And there really isn't
a better solution than that.

195
00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.380
But React Native is
pretty good about using

196
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.330
the native versions of the UI
components themselves.

197
00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.652
Which is why Android took a while, cuz
they wanted to get all the stuff in there.

198
00:12:06.652 --> 00:12:07.840
So yeah, that's pretty much it.
