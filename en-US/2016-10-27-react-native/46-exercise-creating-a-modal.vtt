00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.083
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:07.190
&gt;&gt; Scott: What I want you
to do now is a few things.

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.695
I want you to create a component
right here that has a button,

4
00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:12.360
something you can click on.

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.555
And when you click it, I guess we could
jump right in since this is an async.

6
00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:23.666
When you click it, if you have my changes,
then you have this UI reducer here.

7
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.029
Or where is it at?

8
00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:31.960
There you go, you have this UI reducer
here that sets the modal's visibility.

9
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.540
So when you click it, you should make
an action that sets this visibility.

10
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.316
And then what I want you to do is, and
I didn't show you this component because

11
00:00:40.316 --> 00:00:47.598
actually, you can just read it..
&gt;&gt; Scott: If

12
00:00:47.598 --> 00:00:49.692
you go to the React Native docs and
you look for

13
00:00:49.692 --> 00:00:55.373
modal.
&gt;&gt; Scott: When you click it,

14
00:00:55.373 --> 00:00:58.980
it should open up a modal, that's it.

15
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.275
The modal is actually really easy to use.

16
00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:04.650
You just use modal and
you just say if it's open or not.

17
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.300
Don't worry about closing it right now.

18
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.010
Just try to get the modal to open
when you click the button, that's it.

19
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.390
But you should definitely make
it go through redux though.

20
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.070
So when you click the button, fire off
an action of the type, if you're using

21
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.690
the stuff that I put down, the type
should be SET_EXERCISE_VISIBILITY.

22
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.241
The payload should be true.

23
00:01:25.241 --> 00:01:29.949
And then that modal which is bind right
to that state where it says visible,

24
00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:32.200
that's where it's gonna bind to.

25
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.296
So that's the thing that's changing,
whether it's a visible or

26
00:01:34.296 --> 00:01:38.120
not.
&gt;&gt; Scott: And that's it,

27
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.610
that's all you gotta do.

28
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.510
If you get that far and you still need
something else to do inside the modal,

29
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.035
if you look at the design,
&gt;&gt; Scott: Here,

30
00:01:48.035 --> 00:01:52.310
there's the same topbar
component that we just made.

31
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.680
Bring that topbar component in.

32
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.137
But instead,
put a input bar inside of it and

33
00:01:58.137 --> 00:02:01.650
style it to make it look like that.

34
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.520
So we know how to input cuz that's
the first thing we did yesterday with

35
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.250
the Todo app.

36
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.149
So you could bring that in and
try to style it a little like that.

37
00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.770
I can promise you it's gonna
be a little difficult, yes.

38
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.451
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Question,

39
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:14.970
should we be concerned
that the React Native

40
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.686
modal is deprecated?
&gt;&gt; Scott: No, you shouldn't be concerned

41
00:02:17.686 --> 00:02:22.368
because it still works great.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yes, yeah,

42
00:02:22.368 --> 00:02:29.207
it's fine.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Unless

43
00:02:29.207 --> 00:02:34.330
you have a better modal solution,
then I would just use that one, yeah.

44
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.620
And actually,
I'm pretty sure it's not deprecated.

45
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.649
Where did they see deprecated?

46
00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:42.260
The only thing that's deprecated
is this animated property.

47
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.530
The modal itself is not deprecated.

48
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.790
Yeah, if it was deprecated,
you'd actually get a warning right here.

49
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.620
Like a yellow warning that pop,
this thing is deprecated in this release.

50
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.240
Next release, we just won't use it at all,
I'll tell you that.

51
00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.550
Yeah, the animated property is
deprecated in favor of animationType.

52
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.194
So instead of just put animated true or
false, it allows you to say, hey,

53
00:03:03.194 --> 00:03:05.090
what type of animation do you want,
slide or fade?

54
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.071
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, so

55
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:09.629
this is fine.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I have

56
00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.200
a question about sizing things.

57
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.980
What's best practice?

58
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.773
Say you make a design for
the small iPhone, or

59
00:03:20.773 --> 00:03:23.510
make one for the big iPhone, right?

60
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.040
And pack as much as you fit on there,
like that.

61
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.144
&gt;&gt; Scott: Right.

62
00:03:29.144 --> 00:03:30.127
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: How is it gonna look in

63
00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:31.600
practice on the small one?

64
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.484
Do you have to make separate style?
&gt;&gt; Scott: No,

65
00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:35.670
because everything's flex.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yes.

66
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.255
&gt;&gt; Scott: So it should be fine,

67
00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:41.520
yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So like the unit, say

68
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.881
if you make it 60 unit.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Okay, so now if you do all

69
00:03:44.881 --> 00:03:49.317
the units, then yeah, you're gonna
have to do the conversion yourself.

70
00:03:49.317 --> 00:03:51.959
I wouldn't just put it on there and
expect it to be okay.

71
00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.170
There's gonna be some big differences
where you have to change some things.

72
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.950
I mean, it's the same thing with the web.

73
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.799
If you have, first done about
display versus 11-inch MacBook Air,

74
00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.640
things are gonna look different.

75
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.750
So, you should know how to look for
it and change it yourself.

76
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.391
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Probably a good reason

77
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:14.532
to like back in the percentages.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah,

78
00:04:14.532 --> 00:04:17.949
you can do them instead of just things-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It makes wonder why you have

79
00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.391
to go out of your way to do that.
&gt;&gt; Scott: I don't know,

80
00:04:21.391 --> 00:04:24.598
that's a good question.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Right.

81
00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:26.160
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, I wonder why they do that.

82
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.600
I actually think that they
scale the stuff for you.

83
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.970
Because I think the units
are relative to the screen in fact.

84
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.550
So if you just use the units, I think
you're actually fine, to be honest.

85
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.233
We can try it on-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Depending on the,

86
00:04:38.233 --> 00:04:41.793
I don't know, the aspect ratio, right?
&gt;&gt; Scott: Right,

87
00:04:41.793 --> 00:04:43.511
the aspect ratio of the device.

88
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:46.398
So if unit's 6 Plus and
you say this is 60 units,

89
00:04:46.398 --> 00:04:50.030
I think that's gonna look
different in 60 units on a 4S.

90
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.922
It's not gonna be the same value.

91
00:04:50.922 --> 00:04:54.156
I mean, it's not gonna be the same,
what am I looking for?

92
00:04:54.156 --> 00:04:58.900
Yeah, it's gonna be different
relative to that screen.

93
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.322
I believe that's the way they do it.

94
00:05:00.322 --> 00:05:03.294
Otherwise, you wouldn't know what
device you're on, so it would be crazy.

95
00:05:03.294 --> 00:05:04.410
So yeah,

96
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.003
I think that's how they handle that.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Cool,

97
00:05:10.003 --> 00:05:12.550
yeah, cuz it's density pixels,
so yeah they do.

98
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.270
That's how it works, it's the density.

99
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.162
Yeah, so the screen density pixels,
yeah, that's definitely how it works.

100
00:05:18.162 --> 00:05:21.030
So yeah, you should be fine there.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah,

101
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.470
do they each have the same
number of density pixels?

102
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.820
That probably varies from device to

103
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.990
device.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, it varies.

104
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.004
What I'm saying is if you had
60 density pixels on the most

105
00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:41.635
high resolution iPhone 6 Plus,
it might be this big.

106
00:05:41.635 --> 00:05:46.518
But if you do the same 60
density pixels on a 4S,

107
00:05:46.518 --> 00:05:50.720
it won't be the same
size it is on a 6 Plus.

108
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.190
So it's not gonna be huge on the phone,
it'll just be smaller.

109
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What I mean is,

110
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.790
I don't know, say it's 100.

111
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.990
The screen has 100 density pixels wide.

112
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.150
So, you make some element that's 100,

113
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.490
maybe another device would have 80.
&gt;&gt; Scott: I see what you mean, yeah.

114
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is there is any

115
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.750
rule of thumb?
&gt;&gt; Scott: I think once you max

116
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.549
out, you max.

117
00:06:15.549 --> 00:06:18.616
The other one can only go to 80 and
you put 100, then it's just max.

118
00:06:18.616 --> 00:06:20.540
You just hit 80 and there's nothing more.

119
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.380
I don't think it'll draw off screen.

120
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.731
I think you're fine, but we can test it.

121
00:06:23.731 --> 00:06:26.157
We'll do that after the workshop and
see what happens.

122
00:06:26.157 --> 00:06:27.388
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Well, it won't get cut off,

123
00:06:27.388 --> 00:06:29.213
right?
&gt;&gt; Scott: I'm not sure actually,

124
00:06:29.213 --> 00:06:30.230
I don't know how they do it.

125
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.928
I think they do handle it
where it doesn't get cut off.

126
00:06:32.928 --> 00:06:34.755
I'm not too sure, actually.

127
00:06:34.755 --> 00:06:39.000
I've read it on Android, but
I can't say the same for iOS.

128
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.899
That's why I'm not sure.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Cool, so

129
00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:45.753
any questions on what
we're gonna be doing?

130
00:06:45.753 --> 00:06:49.030
So remember, we're doing two things.
&gt;&gt; Scott: Create this,

131
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.698
where I can click on something.

132
00:06:53.698 --> 00:06:57.496
Which you need to create an action
that when clicked is gonna dispatch.

133
00:06:57.496 --> 00:06:59.680
So you just gotta do a couple of things.

134
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.321
It means you need to connect this
CurrentWorkout, this UI thing,

135
00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:04.626
you need to connect it.

136
00:07:04.626 --> 00:07:06.925
Or actually, not even the CurrentWorkout.

137
00:07:06.925 --> 00:07:11.670
I think you can probably
just connect the Main.

138
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.240
Or CurrentWorkout,
whichever one you want to connect.

139
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.000
You just need to connect one of them.

140
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.680
And you can pass in the actions.

141
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.808
And on click in the CurrentWorkout,
we wanna click something and

142
00:07:22.808 --> 00:07:28.544
have the modal launch up.
&gt;&gt; Scott: That's it,

143
00:07:28.544 --> 00:07:29.590
and have it go to redux.

144
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.845
So let me push this stuff up and
you can start here.

145
00:07:46.301 --> 00:07:48.970
&gt;&gt; Scott: So it's on a 3rd-party branch.

146
00:07:50.034 --> 00:07:51.806
&gt;&gt; Scott: With a 3, and yeah,

147
00:07:51.806 --> 00:07:55.942
again if you get really far with that,
go ahead and

148
00:07:55.942 --> 00:08:02.490
try to style the input box inside
that modal according to the designs.

149
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:03.930
You can't really just style
the input box like that.

150
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.260
You have to wrap it in a view.

151
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.910
You have to do some other stuff.

152
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.298
It was a little more challenging
than I thought it was, but

153
00:08:11.298 --> 00:08:12.780
it's totally possible to do that.

154
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.712
And in the next exercise,
we'll actually add

155
00:08:18.712 --> 00:08:23.213
this fuzzy searching and
stuff like that in.

156
00:08:23.213 --> 00:08:23.713
And we'll add the API, stuff like that.
