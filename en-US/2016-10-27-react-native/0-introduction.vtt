00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.121
&gt;&gt; Scott: So we're just gonna
jump right in this because I'm so

3
00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:47.760
excited to talk about react native,
it's pretty dope.

4
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.290
So you're like, Mark said I'm Scott.

5
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.440
Currently, I don't have a job,
just work for myself.

6
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.820
And I do things like and
hack open source for my homies.

7
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.730
And that's pretty much it I'm in
San Francisco, I do a lot of traveling and

8
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.400
stuff like that.

9
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.410
So this is gonna today of
course in React Native.

10
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.920
So I don't wanna kind of go over the
format of how I like to do the workshops

11
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.720
and just give everybody the letter
I know how that's gonna work.

12
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.150
So for
me like I don't really like slides but

13
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.560
I have slides here that
maybe the last minute.

14
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.190
For me, not for everybody else.

15
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.190
I just hate slides,
doesn't do a lot of live coding.

16
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.140
And a lot of back and forth discussion so
I see a lot of questions.

17
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.890
Try to stump me.

18
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.970
I want opportunity to learn
as much as I'm teaching you.

19
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.580
So a lot of back and
forth tons of questions being asked but

20
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.500
that being said you're gonna be
building an app, actually two app.

21
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.850
We're building two apps,
one today and one tomorrow.

22
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.890
I will be live coding on a separate
app to teach you the concepts and

23
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.548
then you'll apply to your applications
that you'll do on your own machine.

24
00:01:48.548 --> 00:01:49.678
Cool?

25
00:01:49.678 --> 00:01:56.390
All right, so I sent a link to the slides
in the chat if you wanna follow along.

26
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.110
But again mostly for
me I'll also, I'll actually

27
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.570
the other reason I want to do the slides
that I put the exercises on there.

28
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.560
Because I notice a lot of people actually
know what I'm supposed to do next.

29
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.106
Well the exercise will be over.

30
00:02:08.106 --> 00:02:12.017
So you're just gonna look and see exactly
what you're doing on a current exercise.

31
00:02:12.017 --> 00:02:14.640
Cool, any questions before
we get started just come in.

32
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.773
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just a comment.

33
00:02:15.773 --> 00:02:20.654
you have a super fan and
said in that attended all three courses.

34
00:02:20.654 --> 00:02:24.235
&gt;&gt; Scott: Dope.
That's what I'm talking about then I can

35
00:02:24.235 --> 00:02:26.801
number this instead of a cookie.

36
00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:28.307
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott: All right.

37
00:02:28.307 --> 00:02:30.986
Let's us just get started
let's get right into it.

38
00:02:30.986 --> 00:02:32.670
Okay.

39
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.550
Actually before we get started.

40
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.910
Has anybody had trouble with the hello
world tutorial on React Native?

41
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.160
It is imperative that you get that up and
running.

42
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.340
Like if you don't have that up and
running,

43
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.550
you're gonna run this, you just can't,
you can not do the course.

44
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.350
You can't do the course if you
don't have it pretty much.

45
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think I
have everything installed.

46
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.650
I'm just not sure where to
like see the hello to see the.

47
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.570
&gt;&gt; Scott: Are you running on the emulator?

48
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.000
Do you have an emulator open?

49
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What?

50
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.590
No, I'm not sure.

51
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.280
&gt;&gt; Scott: Okay.
So you just run these commands whenever

52
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.600
you want, and it'll create that directory.

53
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.240
Got it. Yeah. Got it.

54
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.590
And then I can just see it.

55
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.710
Then you can see into that
directory in a little while.

56
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.270
Got it.
Okay.

57
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.849
All right, sweet.

58
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.883
I was let's start it so React Native.

59
00:03:22.883 --> 00:03:28.570
So the whole premise of React Native and
this is from the react native team is that

60
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.030
they want you to be able to learn once and
build everywhere.

61
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.660
So that means is if you
know Reacts on the Web, you

62
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.580
can take what you know about Reacts and
apply it here to the Native.

63
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.700
It's not like build once,
have a word, they don't expect you to

64
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.000
like build one codebase in a word
there is not their philosophy.

65
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.220
They're just saying you
know react already so

66
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.040
building it again on native
is going to be different.

67
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.120
So it's not exactly going to be like I can
transfer my entire codebase over from my

68
00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.420
react web app and place in React
native it'll just work not entirely.

69
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.920
Not the U I maybe some of the logic stuff.

70
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.780
So I think that's a really good approach
because your knowledge is transferable.

71
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.850
And you feel pretty powerful.

72
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.090
So react native is a platform.

73
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.470
It's not like a framework really, really
is a platform that allow you develop

74
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.630
native modules or
native applications using React.

75
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.420
So it's a pretty sweet platform.

76
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.170
Build native UIs with React components.

77
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.007
Who here has never used React?

78
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.090
&gt;&gt; Scott: Nice.

79
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.534
You gotta have a of learns today.

80
00:04:34.534 --> 00:04:37.060
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott: [LAUGH] A lot of learns.

81
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.580
Yeah ,so we're going to build native user
interfaces with react components which

82
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.130
you'll see.

83
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.010
If you ever develop natively with
like Objective C, Java or even Swift.

84
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.080
Yeah it's great but then like they
just don't compare to like react

85
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.430
components or- Many people aren't even
native developers Just one, all right.

86
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.352
Everybody here knows JavaScript though,
yeah?

87
00:05:00.352 --> 00:05:02.407
Okay, all right.

88
00:05:02.407 --> 00:05:03.092
Cool.

89
00:05:03.092 --> 00:05:06.356
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott: Gotta check.

90
00:05:06.356 --> 00:05:08.020
All right, so yeah,

91
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.120
we're gonna be building native
UIs with the React components.

92
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.190
But creating the application logic
is literally just JavaScript,

93
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.120
just like we do on the Web.

94
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.700
So all this stuff you do on the Web as
far as Head of HTTP state management.

95
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.470
Mostly all the other stuff is literally
just going to record JavaScript and

96
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.190
I'd need another change.

97
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.720
So that's the code where
you probably could share

98
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.760
between environments between the web with
tween desktop if you use like electrons

99
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.930
between mobile web if you have a different
mobile website and also the native.

100
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.240
So that's the stuff that is going to be
sharable because it's just JavaScript.

101
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.530
It's not most of it's not tied to
the platform unless using like platform

102
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.420
specific API stuff we'll get into later.
