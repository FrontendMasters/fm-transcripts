[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.944 --> 00:00:06.970
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We're gonna
also do things like padding.

3
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.840
So it works pretty much similar to CSS.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.520
If you can't do the shortcut and
declare padding for

5
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.220
all four directions in one line.

6
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.819
So if I just put padding,
it's for all of them.

7
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.023
And the unit here is not pixels,
so I don't have to say 10 pixels.

8
00:00:21.023 --> 00:00:26.047
It's not pixels, it's gonna be the same
units that you would use natively.

9
00:00:26.047 --> 00:00:31.850
So what do they call it, density units?

10
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:32.426
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Points.

11
00:00:32.426 --> 00:00:34.897
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Density points, yeah,
whatever, so that's what it is.

12
00:00:34.897 --> 00:00:38.163
So it's not gonna be 10 pixels,
it's just gonna be, let's say 10.

13
00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:41.526
So 10 density points.

14
00:00:41.526 --> 00:00:45.869
And that wasn't that big enough to
see the effect, let's put 40 and

15
00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:47.865
we should see this fancy thing.

16
00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:49.171
There we go, right there.

17
00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:51.723
So we've got some padding,
you can also do margin.

18
00:00:51.723 --> 00:00:53.333
It doesn't make sense to put margin
on this container though, so

19
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:53.987
we're not gonna do that.

20
00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:57.167
And that's some of the stuff
you can do with the View.

21
00:00:57.167 --> 00:01:00.364
When I say the View,
I'm talking about the View component.

22
00:01:00.364 --> 00:01:01.922
But there's tons more.

23
00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:03.970
The View component can do a lot of things.

24
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.532
For, instance because this is flex, let's
say that we want to center everything and

25
00:01:07.532 --> 00:01:08.427
put it in the middle.

26
00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:13.257
So we can say, justifyContent, which is a
flexbox thing, and then we can say center.

27
00:01:13.257 --> 00:01:17.035
And then now,
it puts it in the center vertically.

28
00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:22.304
But now if we want to do
it horizontally we can say,

29
00:01:22.304 --> 00:01:25.951
alignItems, also to the center.

30
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:28.594
And now it's in the middle, pretty dope.

31
00:01:28.594 --> 00:01:31.028
And that's just flexboxes, so, yes?

32
00:01:31.028 --> 00:01:38.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you include styles in
the top level of this style sheet layer,

33
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.993
or does it have to be
a collection of objects?

34
00:01:43.993 --> 00:01:45.542
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Can I just
put inline styles in here?

35
00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:50.806
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So could you just put,
instead of having styles.container,

36
00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:56.679
just have styles there and
then down below, just take out container.

37
00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.380
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I see what you mean.

38
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.690
Not if your using the StyleSheet
to create it, no.

39
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.597
If you just use your own object,
you could.

40
00:02:04.597 --> 00:02:06.749
But then again, you're not using
the validation from the StyleSheet.create.

41
00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:08.340
But if you want to use your own object,
you could.

42
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.370
That's like the equivalent.

43
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.000
So let's bring this to the next point.

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.279
So in style,
you can pass in an array, like this.

45
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.770
And you can pass in more styles and
they will override each other.

46
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.000
So now you can pass in a bank object
here and be like, you know what,

47
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.218
I want the backgroundColor
to be yellow now.

48
00:02:24.218 --> 00:02:26.220
So this should overwrite what I have.

49
00:02:29.127 --> 00:02:30.248
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
it's just a blank object,

50
00:02:30.248 --> 00:02:31.980
I didn't do StyleSheet.create
to make this.

51
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.269
Just a blank object, so yeah,
you could totally do that.

52
00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.870
So what most people I see are doing,

53
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.877
they're creating global
styles in a file somewhere.

54
00:02:40.877 --> 00:02:44.676
And then they'll just merge the objects
together to create the styles for

55
00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:47.196
their components,
cuz it's just JavaScript.

56
00:02:50.424 --> 00:02:53.287
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, so yeah, that's how
you would center something using CSS.

57
00:02:53.287 --> 00:02:56.230
I think that's pretty cool,
just relying on flexboxes.

58
00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.270
Every situation that I've come across in
most apps could be handled using this.

59
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.050
There are some times where I'm just like,
I don't know how I would handle this.

60
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.122
I wish I had a layout system more native,
like Android or

61
00:03:08.122 --> 00:03:13.628
iOS where you have stack layouts and
absolute layouts and stuff like that.

62
00:03:13.628 --> 00:03:16.180
But you can do the same thing,
it's just a little harder,

63
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.460
for instance,
absolutely positioning things.

64
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.438
For instance,
let's say we have this text here,

65
00:03:20.438 --> 00:03:24.552
and actually let's make another View,
this is a better example.

66
00:03:24.552 --> 00:03:26.458
So we'll make another View here, and

67
00:03:26.458 --> 00:03:30.539
we'll call this one,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Box, so

68
00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:35.276
we'll make a box and we'll give

69
00:03:35.276 --> 00:03:40.193
it a backgroundColor of yellow.

70
00:03:40.193 --> 00:03:42.521
We'll also give it a width,
so we can do width here.

71
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:46.815
So we'll give it width a 30 and
a height of 30.

72
00:03:46.815 --> 00:03:49.033
And we'll just put that there.

73
00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:51.012
There we go, so we have this.

74
00:03:51.012 --> 00:03:54.365
But, let's say we want to
absolutely position this box.

75
00:03:54.365 --> 00:03:59.370
We can come down here and
we're gonna say position: 'absolute',

76
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.283
just like we would in CSS.

77
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.620
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So
we change that to absolute,

78
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.719
you see it automatically got
pushed out of the flow there.

79
00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:14.944
And then you can do the same stuff
you do so top: 20, left: 30.

80
00:04:14.944 --> 00:04:20.586
There we go, absolutely positioned,
just like you would in CSS.

81
00:04:20.586 --> 00:04:24.628
So you can do the same stuff, it's just
they try to bring it over to CSS and

82
00:04:24.628 --> 00:04:26.896
sometimes it just doesn't feel right.

83
00:04:26.896 --> 00:04:31.397
Sometimes, I feel like the layout
systems in Native work better.

84
00:04:31.397 --> 00:04:34.948
But at the same time, they want you to be
able to learn once and use everywhere, so

85
00:04:34.948 --> 00:04:36.898
it makes sense when they
bring it over here.

86
00:04:36.898 --> 00:04:39.180
Any questions on this stuff so far?

87
00:04:42.713 --> 00:04:43.825
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No?

88
00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:47.573
So some of other things you can
do on View is like borderRadius.

89
00:04:47.573 --> 00:04:54.620
Right, you can say,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: 3 and

90
00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.679
we get a nice borderRadius right there.

91
00:04:57.679 --> 00:05:01.480
And we can make it a circle if we do,
what is it, 30?

92
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.811
Or no, half of 30, 15.

93
00:05:03.811 --> 00:05:06.017
There we go, so now it's a circle.

94
00:05:06.017 --> 00:05:09.181
So same thing as CSS,
pretty easy to do there.

95
00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:12.948
And like I said, there's tons of
other stuff you can do on the View.

96
00:05:12.948 --> 00:05:19.355
But then we get to things like Text, each
component has different ways to style.

97
00:05:19.355 --> 00:05:21.128
Most of them are based off either View,

98
00:05:21.128 --> 00:05:26.080
Text,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: That's basically it.

99
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.871
Almost every component that React Native
gives you are based off those two

100
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:30.052
different types of elements.

101
00:05:30.052 --> 00:05:32.700
Either there's some type of View or
there's some type of Text,

102
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.966
and those are really the only
two different Text ones.

103
00:05:34.966 --> 00:05:39.978
So for Text, let's give this one a style,

104
00:05:39.978 --> 00:05:44.998
we'll say style=styles.text, sure.

105
00:05:44.998 --> 00:05:49.704
And this one is actually pretty familiar,
or pretty similar to with CSS as well, so

106
00:05:49.704 --> 00:05:50.453
we say text.

107
00:05:50.453 --> 00:05:54.504
We could do things like color,
and that'll change the color.

108
00:05:54.504 --> 00:05:58.283
And it's the same type of value that
you can pass to backgroundColor.

109
00:05:58.283 --> 00:06:02.798
So white, fontSize,

110
00:06:02.798 --> 00:06:06.130
say 34 units.

111
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.322
You can even do fontFamily and
if you have that fontFamily

112
00:06:12.322 --> 00:06:16.189
loaded up on your device,
then it will use it.

113
00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:18.015
I think by default this is using Roboto,
so

114
00:06:18.015 --> 00:06:20.310
I don't thinnk this is even
gonna make a difference.

115
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.990
It's already Roboto, yeah,
well let's see if we wanted to do.

116
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.490
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: That didn't change.

117
00:06:33.078 --> 00:06:35.626
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I guess this is just like,
whatever, we're gonna use Roboto anyway,

118
00:06:35.626 --> 00:06:36.223
we don't care.

119
00:06:36.223 --> 00:06:37.286
But yeah, you do stuff like that.

120
00:06:37.286 --> 00:06:42.394
LineSpacing, I think you can do,
yeah, what is it?

121
00:06:42.394 --> 00:06:48.370
FontWeight, so if you wanted to
do some weight here like bold and

122
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.804
stuff like that, you can do that,
if I can spell it right.

123
00:06:56.588 --> 00:06:59.014
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Like let's say
we wanna make this say 200.

124
00:07:02.664 --> 00:07:06.726
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It's gotta be a string,
even though it's a number, okay, okay,

125
00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:07.735
okay, I got it.

126
00:07:07.735 --> 00:07:10.196
Let's reload.

127
00:07:14.177 --> 00:07:16.405
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go or
you can do bold.

128
00:07:16.405 --> 00:07:21.760
There we go, and now it's bold.

129
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.772
So those are some of the Text properties,

130
00:07:23.772 --> 00:07:26.800
there's too many to go list
in every single one of them.

131
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.066
But if you look, this is one of
the rare times I'll say, yeah,

132
00:07:31.066 --> 00:07:31.860
just look at the docs.

133
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.050
But yeah, if you do look at the docs for
those two components like View.

134
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.010
And you just look at all the styles
that you can do, right here.

135
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:45.340
There's tons of them, like borders,
overflows, opacities, all types of stuff.

136
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.668
And then they inherit other styles
from flexboxes, shadow properties,

137
00:07:49.668 --> 00:07:50.724
stuff like that.

138
00:07:50.724 --> 00:07:54.630
So if we look at the flexbox, you'll see
all the stuff that we're using, align,

139
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.455
flex, flex wrap, justify content.

140
00:07:56.455 --> 00:07:59.101
All the margin and padding,
all that stuff, yes?

141
00:07:59.101 --> 00:08:04.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Question about
are percentages possible with these stats?

142
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.045
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No,
percentages aren't possible, but

143
00:08:06.045 --> 00:08:09.680
that brings us to our next point, of how
we can actually use percentages anyway.

144
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.377
So the way we would do that
is to get away with it is,

145
00:08:14.377 --> 00:08:18.506
we can't come down here and
let's make this box 30%.

146
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.860
Because it would actually break,
we could check it out, if we do that.

147
00:08:26.988 --> 00:08:29.710
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
invalid prop width, just doesn't work.

148
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:34.522
And we're getting that because,
that StyleSheet thing, so go back here.

149
00:08:34.522 --> 00:08:39.398
Okay, but what we can do is we

150
00:08:39.398 --> 00:08:43.675
can import dimensions.

151
00:08:43.675 --> 00:08:45.900
Dimension or dimensions?

152
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.056
Let's see which one it is.

153
00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:50.772
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I already refreshed you.

154
00:08:50.772 --> 00:08:53.360
Okay, so this is where hot module
loading gets kinda crazy sometimes.

155
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.522
Okay, now it's bringing up the debugger.

156
00:08:57.522 --> 00:09:01.141
I didn't even tell it to do that,
it just did it.

157
00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:06.111
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So
I'm gonna exit out of this app.

158
00:09:09.273 --> 00:09:11.870
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I know you stopped.

159
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:15.986
Thank you, thank you.

160
00:09:15.986 --> 00:09:17.175
All right, let's go back.

161
00:09:20.805 --> 00:09:23.470
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool,
so if we get dimension,

162
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:27.067
what we can do is we can access the, what?

163
00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:29.560
Why is this thing still freaking out?

164
00:09:33.822 --> 00:09:36.885
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Got it, great.

165
00:09:36.885 --> 00:09:39.360
So now if we get dimension,

166
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:45.387
what we can do is we can access
the dimensions of the actual device,

167
00:09:45.387 --> 00:09:49.597
and we can use that to
base percentages off of.

168
00:09:49.597 --> 00:09:54.986
So if we wanted to get the dimensions

169
00:09:54.986 --> 00:10:04.149
we can say const screen =
Dimension.window().width,

170
00:10:04.149 --> 00:10:07.211
I think that's it.

171
00:10:07.211 --> 00:10:08.509
Let's check it out.

172
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:12.112
So we'll call that width.

173
00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:13.216
So we can get the width like that.

174
00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:23.922
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay,
maybe let's look it up right quick.

175
00:10:23.922 --> 00:10:24.645
I think they changed it.

176
00:10:28.325 --> 00:10:29.065
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's Dimensions.

177
00:10:29.065 --> 00:10:32.493
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Dimensions, man, I knew it.

178
00:10:32.493 --> 00:10:33.935
And it's get window, got it.

179
00:10:37.042 --> 00:10:42.118
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So we can say
.get('window'), which is gonna give

180
00:10:42.118 --> 00:10:48.493
us an object with the height and
the width, so I'll just go ahead and.

181
00:10:48.493 --> 00:10:49.175
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Dimensions.

182
00:10:49.175 --> 00:10:49.950
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Thank you.

183
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.790
I'll just go ahead and de-structure those,
so now we can get the height and

184
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:59.715
the width and I'll save them in variables,
load this thing back up, great.

185
00:10:59.715 --> 00:11:02.778
So now we can come out here and
we can do percentages, so

186
00:11:02.778 --> 00:11:05.786
I want this box to be like
half the width of the screen.

187
00:11:05.786 --> 00:11:09.693
I could just say width / 2.

188
00:11:09.693 --> 00:11:14.823
And now it's half the width of the screen,
all right?

189
00:11:14.823 --> 00:11:16.195
Same thing with height, so.

190
00:11:16.195 --> 00:11:20.533
Yeah, you'll have to play with it like
that to figure out how to do percentages

191
00:11:20.533 --> 00:11:24.034
but you couldn't pass in
the percentages as a value like that.

192
00:11:24.034 --> 00:11:25.440
So you gotta do a little bit of math.

193
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.821
Any other questions on this stuff?

194
00:11:31.221 --> 00:11:35.202
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: When you change
your orientation, how is that?

195
00:11:35.202 --> 00:11:39.238
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, when you change
the orientation, it'll change too.

196
00:11:39.238 --> 00:11:42.158
So we're gonna get into how you
listen to do things orientation so

197
00:11:42.158 --> 00:11:43.333
you can do things as well.

198
00:11:43.333 --> 00:11:45.492
But let's try it out.

199
00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.375
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, it changes.

200
00:11:51.375 --> 00:11:55.082
It's still half, half or half and then.

201
00:11:55.082 --> 00:11:56.436
It says not a third, let's see.

202
00:11:56.436 --> 00:12:00.584
Yeah, it's still it.

203
00:12:00.584 --> 00:12:01.650
Where did it go?

204
00:12:08.529 --> 00:12:09.216
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right,

205
00:12:09.216 --> 00:12:12.665
now I lost the menu to switch
back to the orientation thing.

206
00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:16.719
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's not
a third of the height.

207
00:12:16.719 --> 00:12:18.511
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, it's wrong.

208
00:12:18.511 --> 00:12:20.474
It's still the same as it was.

209
00:12:20.474 --> 00:12:25.553
Still a third to the right and
a half down.

210
00:12:25.553 --> 00:12:27.336
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So you have to
call that in your render, right?

211
00:12:27.336 --> 00:12:30.539
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, or
actually, I think the better.

212
00:12:30.539 --> 00:12:31.198
Really, dude?

213
00:12:31.198 --> 00:12:33.814
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I don't like that.

214
00:12:33.814 --> 00:12:34.413
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Better be quick.

215
00:12:34.413 --> 00:12:35.935
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I'm just
gonna have to close it down.

216
00:12:35.935 --> 00:12:37.232
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Shut it down.

217
00:12:37.232 --> 00:12:42.212
[LAUGH] Don't ever switch
orientations in that thing again.

218
00:12:42.212 --> 00:12:44.822
Yeah, I think what you have to do is you
have to listen for when the orientation

219
00:12:44.822 --> 00:12:47.252
changes and then you would have to
change the style probably yourself.

220
00:12:47.252 --> 00:12:50.726
Because it looks like
it didn't update there.

221
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:53.656
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Any other question?

222
00:12:53.656 --> 00:12:54.230
You had one, yeah?

223
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.202
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well, the same.

224
00:12:55.202 --> 00:12:55.974
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So the same thing?

225
00:12:55.974 --> 00:12:56.546
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Same thing basically.

226
00:12:56.546 --> 00:12:57.330
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, we're in sync.

227
00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.873
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I was wondering cuz I was

228
00:13:01.873 --> 00:13:06.457
reading about dimensions.

229
00:13:06.457 --> 00:13:09.348
And they recommend calling that in render,
but

230
00:13:09.348 --> 00:13:12.102
then how does that work
with the StyleSheet?

231
00:13:12.102 --> 00:13:15.487
I can see how it works
within inline styles but.

232
00:13:15.487 --> 00:13:19.166
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Calling methods from render-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But you have a StyleSheet

233
00:13:19.166 --> 00:13:24.825
that's outside of render, it's defined.

234
00:13:24.825 --> 00:13:26.494
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay,
I see what you're saying.

235
00:13:26.494 --> 00:13:28.206
So you want to call a method
inside of render that's going to

236
00:13:28.206 --> 00:13:29.794
change the StyleSheet,
is that what you're saying?

237
00:13:29.794 --> 00:13:30.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

238
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:35.038
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
how would you do that?

239
00:13:35.038 --> 00:13:39.969
I think the way you would do that is
you would probably have to have like

240
00:13:39.969 --> 00:13:43.556
a styles functions that
took in some parameters.

241
00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:46.840
And then that would create the StyleSheet
for you, dynamically, yeah.
