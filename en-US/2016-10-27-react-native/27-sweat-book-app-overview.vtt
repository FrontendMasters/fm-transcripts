2
00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:05.990
&gt;&gt; Scott: So
yesterday we ended with a bang.

3
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.360
Lightning fast talk through Redux which
probably confused more than it helped.

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.540
So today we're actually
gonna start with that and

5
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.190
a better example is gonna make more sense.

6
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.580
So, along with going over what
we're going to be doing today.

7
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.251
So, here is the app that we're
gonna be making, actually and

8
00:00:24.251 --> 00:00:26.803
the links for
it is actually in the slides.

9
00:00:26.803 --> 00:00:30.786
If you go to the slides, you click on this
link and it will take to what I'm looking

10
00:00:30.786 --> 00:00:37.672
at here
&gt;&gt; Scott: Which is this design here.

11
00:00:37.672 --> 00:00:41.080
So the app that we're gonna be making
today's is called Sweat Book and

12
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.610
this is a fitness app that you can
use to track your stuff in the gym.

13
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.580
So basically that's it, but it's gonna
cover a lot of things that we didn't talk

14
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.138
about yesterday some different APIs and

15
00:00:50.138 --> 00:00:52.570
some different components that we're
gonna use in [INAUDIBLE] native.

16
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.400
So if you look at this design here,
we notice we can see a few things and

17
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.410
the design is important because
it's gonna help us figure out one

18
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.680
how to style the app to
how to set up the routing.

19
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.390
What type of navigation
system we're gonna use and

20
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.000
also how to set up our state
management locally would like Redux.

21
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.350
And so that's what the design does.

22
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.530
So if we look at it, we know that
we have like this one page here,

23
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.010
which is like you can think of it like the
home page of splash screen or whatever.

24
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.720
And it is just talking about the last
time you worked out the day it was on and

25
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.432
you can just click this button
here that says Start Workout.

26
00:01:27.432 --> 00:01:29.368
What that does is it brings
you to this screen, and

27
00:01:29.368 --> 00:01:34.930
I intentionally left the tabs at
the bottom here with no icons,

28
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.430
no text on to leave it up to you,
whatever you want to put on them.

29
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.770
But this is just saying this is gonna be
a tab interface and we want to be able to

30
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.780
slide between these tabs or also tap the
icons at the bottom to go to those tabs.

31
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.160
So we wanna go to do that.

32
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.585
But right now we have this little
nap bar at the top that just says,

33
00:01:49.585 --> 00:01:50.830
Current Workout.

34
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.100
And then because you don't have any
exercises in your current workout,

35
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.470
you can just hit the plus.

36
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.250
But just by looking at this you can see
that we need a few things other than tabs

37
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.100
I just talked about, we also need things
like track in the current workout,

38
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.550
exercises being added.

39
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.960
So you can kinda think of
this stuff as you go and

40
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.471
we build out our app and
in this state stuff with Redux, so

41
00:02:11.471 --> 00:02:14.930
you can think about what reducers and
stuff we might need for this application.

42
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.740
So we click this, we get a modal that
slides up, and then here it's immediately,

43
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.200
it's gonna have this
search bar up at the top.

44
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.179
And you can start typing and then
there's gonna be a fuzzy searcher there.

45
00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.760
I'm gonna have build out for you.

46
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.560
But if you're feeling awesome, you can
build out that fuzzy searcher yourself

47
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.086
too, it's not that complicated,
but that's gonna be built for you.

48
00:02:35.086 --> 00:02:36.727
You just have to build the components, but

49
00:02:36.727 --> 00:02:39.106
as you type this is gonna be a list
of exercises that you can do.

50
00:02:39.106 --> 00:02:43.332
The app is already, gonna be populated
with some exercises there for you.

51
00:02:43.332 --> 00:02:45.468
So you don't have to hard
code these exercises in,

52
00:02:45.468 --> 00:02:47.017
they are already hard coded for you.

53
00:02:47.017 --> 00:02:50.862
And then after that, you can select an
exercise or click this x button here and

54
00:02:50.862 --> 00:02:52.341
let's select an exercise and

55
00:02:52.341 --> 00:02:55.795
it'll bring you back to the screen
where it will list your exercise.

56
00:02:55.795 --> 00:02:57.638
I did make a design for
that cuz I wanna leave it up to you,

57
00:02:57.638 --> 00:02:59.217
how you want to display
them on the page as well.

58
00:02:59.217 --> 00:03:01.690
I think your eyes are gonna
be a little different there.

59
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.140
But that's basically it.

60
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.182
So you can hit x as well and
it'll drop down a modal.

61
00:03:05.182 --> 00:03:08.840
So you can think of other possible screens
as being a few swipes at a right it will

62
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.734
show the history of all
the exercises that you've ever done.

63
00:03:11.734 --> 00:03:12.525
&gt;&gt; [SOUND].

64
00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:17.007
&gt;&gt; Scott: Or if you go to the right even
more, maybe there's a settings page where

65
00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:21.192
you can change units from pounds to
whatever else you want to use and

66
00:03:21.192 --> 00:03:22.500
stuff like that.

67
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.106
So there's a tons of
options you can do that,

68
00:03:24.106 --> 00:03:26.180
we're just gonna do the basic
thing to get started.
