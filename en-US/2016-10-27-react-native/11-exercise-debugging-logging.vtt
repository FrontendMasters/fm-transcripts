2
00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:08.252
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So the next exercise
is actually to connect to the Chrome

3
00:00:08.252 --> 00:00:12.964
debugger, get familiar with
the dev flow and debugging.

4
00:00:12.964 --> 00:00:14.751
Okay, this is the one I
forgot to talk about.

5
00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:19.104
Yeah, and if you're on Android, you can
actually type this command in right here.

6
00:00:19.104 --> 00:00:22.175
Let me copy it.

7
00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:29.831
Yeah, if you're on Android you can type
in this command inside the terminal,

8
00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:35.058
and it will give you the output
of the logs right here.

9
00:00:35.058 --> 00:00:39.351
So if we have the app running,
we can type in that command, and

10
00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:41.673
we'll see the logs right there.

11
00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:47.444
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So again that was, this.

12
00:00:47.444 --> 00:00:50.151
As soon I typed in, it evaluate it.

13
00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:54.831
So the command is right here.If
you type that command in,

14
00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:57.895
you can access to all your logs, yes?

15
00:00:57.895 --> 00:01:03.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Question online,
when you adjust the connection setting

16
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.013
bandwidth offline mode in Chrome,
will they reflect on the device?

17
00:01:10.013 --> 00:01:11.924
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No, I don't think so, and

18
00:01:11.924 --> 00:01:15.980
that's because I think that
depends on the emulator.

19
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.820
I think you can do that in emulator.

20
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.900
So I don't think that's gonna work.

21
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.820
Cuz I'm pretty sure that's not gonna work.

22
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.800
But maybe it will.

23
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.040
I don't want to say 100% sure, but
I don't think that's going to work.

24
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.940
I think that's a device thing.

25
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.550
So I know in Genymotion,
you can do all that.

26
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.500
You could adjust all that stuff.
