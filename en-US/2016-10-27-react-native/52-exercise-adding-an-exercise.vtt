00:00:03.773 --> 00:00:08.059
&gt;&gt; Scott: So based on what we have here,
so on this ExerciseList,

3
00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.578
when it renders it's gonna
have a list of exercises.

4
00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:14.574
I wanna be able to tap
on that exercise and

5
00:00:14.574 --> 00:00:18.061
have it add the exercise that I tapped
on to the current workout array.

6
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:22.549
So you need to make another action
that when clicked is gonna add

7
00:00:22.549 --> 00:00:24.400
the current exercise.

8
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.660
So if you go look in
the ExerciseList here,

9
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.660
the current exercise would
be this exercise right here.

10
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.780
So you'd probably do like a button or
highlight opacity or

11
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.092
something like that to
be able to on-press.

12
00:00:37.092 --> 00:00:41.056
So, on-press, we want to fire off
an action that we need to create.

13
00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:43.316
And we can call that addExercise.

14
00:00:43.316 --> 00:00:48.870
And we want that action to add
exercise to the current workout.

15
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.735
So on our current workout reducer,
it's actually already here.

16
00:00:51.735 --> 00:00:53.358
ADD_EXERCISE_COMPLETE.

17
00:00:53.358 --> 00:00:57.920
And that's because it's gonna be async,
but we're gonna do async after we do this.

18
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.300
So if you could just make an action,
whatever you wanna call it.

19
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.877
Mine is called ADD_EXERCISE_COMPLETE.

20
00:01:01.877 --> 00:01:05.611
And it's just gonna add it to the
addExcercise array, just push it in there.

21
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:06.862
And that's it.

22
00:01:06.862 --> 00:01:09.380
And that's all you gotta do.
