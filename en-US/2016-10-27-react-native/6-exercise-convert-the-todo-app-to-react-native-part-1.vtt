WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.712
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.712 --> 00:00:04.446
&gt;&gt; Scott: Exercise two,

3
00:00:04.446 --> 00:00:07.502
we're just gonna convert the web
Todo app to a React Native app.

4
00:00:07.502 --> 00:00:11.184
So let's actually just walk through
setting up a React Native app and

5
00:00:11.184 --> 00:00:12.207
getting started.

6
00:00:12.207 --> 00:00:15.390
And some clues on how to
transfer that stuff over.

7
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.785
So what we'll do is we'll
just make a new repo.

8
00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:24.282
I think I already have it here, Todo.
&gt;&gt; Scott: What's in here?

9
00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:26.895
I don't know what’s in there,
let's just make a new one.

10
00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:29.521
I know that's going to
take forever NPM install.

11
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:35.031
So yeah, let's just walk a new one,
let’s do that.

12
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:38.655
So the first thing we'll do is navigate to
somewhere on your computer where you want

13
00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:39.342
to make an app.

14
00:00:39.342 --> 00:00:42.050
And he's gonna run the command and

15
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.476
react-native init followed by
the name of the app you wanna create.

16
00:00:47.476 --> 00:00:50.436
So in this case,
I called mine Todo with a capital T.

17
00:00:50.436 --> 00:00:55.183
So this is gonna create the directory for
you.

18
00:00:55.183 --> 00:01:01.758
It's gonna create the Android and
iOS app for you with the same name.

19
00:01:01.758 --> 00:01:04.002
So that's why I capitalized it here.

20
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:06.455
That's gonna be the name of the app, Todo.

21
00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:09.285
You can change it, but
by default that's what it's gonna be.

22
00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:11.194
You can put whatever you want,
it's totally up you.

23
00:01:11.194 --> 00:01:13.226
But that's the directory name and

24
00:01:13.226 --> 00:01:17.638
the app names.
&gt;&gt; Scott: So once you have that,

25
00:01:17.638 --> 00:01:19.179
it's gonna take a minute to install.

26
00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.317
Don't worry about
following along right now,

27
00:01:21.317 --> 00:01:24.376
I'm gonna set you guys loose on
an exercise to continue doing this.

28
00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:28.803
Otherwise, that's there,
you can go into that and

29
00:01:28.803 --> 00:01:33.442
you'll see what it creates is,
let me get rid of this.

30
00:01:33.442 --> 00:01:34.641
By the way I'm using Atom.

31
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:40.622
I've been switching editors for the last
week between VS code, Sublime, Atom.

32
00:01:40.622 --> 00:01:43.910
They all have tradeoffs,
like when I use Angular2, I use VS code,

33
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.443
cuz it's got like great type of script
support, but then it looks ugly.

34
00:01:47.443 --> 00:01:51.756
So I could back to Atom, cuz Atom looks
good with an Atom's slow so you Sublime.

35
00:01:51.756 --> 00:01:58.042
But in Sublime, doesn't have good via,
it's like man, it's not a perfect one.

36
00:01:58.042 --> 00:02:01.070
I don't know if I'm ready to go to
the dark side with WebStorm yet.

37
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.375
To much configuration for me, but I know
it will do everything I need it to do.

38
00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:06.999
It's just like,
do I really wanna set all that stuff up?

39
00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.899
Maybe I will, maybe I might have to do it.

40
00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.568
We'll see, one weekend.

41
00:02:12.568 --> 00:02:14.320
Sweet, so now let's open that up.

42
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.358
But so far, I mean I've been pretty calm,
but with Atom, it's just slow sometimes.

43
00:02:22.358 --> 00:02:23.652
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I miss the command to create

44
00:02:23.652 --> 00:02:27.944
a new project, can you show it again?
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah, the command for

45
00:02:27.944 --> 00:02:32.558
the new project is just
gonna be react-native

46
00:02:32.558 --> 00:02:37.209
init followed by the name of the project.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Thanks.

47
00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.718
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yep, so it's gonna like download

48
00:02:38.718 --> 00:02:39.295
some stuff.

49
00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:42.176
It's gonna take a minute,
depending on who's all downloading.

50
00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:44.492
But once it's done,
it's gonna create this for you.

51
00:02:44.492 --> 00:02:46.592
It's gonna create all
this good stuff here.

52
00:02:46.592 --> 00:02:48.580
So let's just walk through
this directory very quick.

53
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.759
So notice the package.json.

54
00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:52.958
Boom, that means this
is a node application.

55
00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.880
So that means,
we can use no modules, awesome.

56
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.055
So it's just JavaScript,
that's a key indicator right there,

57
00:02:57.055 --> 00:02:57.930
I think that's amazing.

58
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.354
And if you're looking at package.json,
you'll see the name, it's called Todo.

59
00:03:01.354 --> 00:03:03.908
It starts off as private and
it gives you the start command.

60
00:03:03.908 --> 00:03:06.409
And it already has react, and
react-native downloaded for you.

61
00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.786
No react doms,
cuz remember there's no dom here.

62
00:03:09.786 --> 00:03:14.803
And then if we head over,
you'll see there's index.android and

63
00:03:14.803 --> 00:03:17.408
index.ios, and we look at them.

64
00:03:17.408 --> 00:03:22.246
They're actually the exact same,
pretty much.

65
00:03:22.246 --> 00:03:26.166
And the reason they have these two files
is these are the entry files to the two

66
00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:27.468
applications you want.

67
00:03:27.468 --> 00:03:31.269
If you're gonna be building for Android
and iOS, they give you the opportunity to

68
00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.865
have two entry files to your application,
so that you can have differences.

69
00:03:34.865 --> 00:03:39.568
So maybe the index.android is gonna be
pulling modules in from a different

70
00:03:39.568 --> 00:03:41.744
party or app specific to Android.

71
00:03:41.744 --> 00:03:45.010
And indexed.ios is gonna pull
the modules and specifically for iOS,

72
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.067
because it's gonna build it differently.

73
00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:49.609
So this is how you can set of
differences between two applications.

74
00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.404
This is one approach the other approach,
the other approach is will get into later,

75
00:03:53.404 --> 00:03:56.720
is you can actually react-native will
give you a module to determine what

76
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.130
platform you're running on.

77
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.770
And then you can just use that as
conditionals everywhere in your code.

78
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.912
If platform Android render this,
if platform iOS render this.

79
00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:10.687
See, that's another way to do it too,
or a combination of the both.

80
00:04:10.687 --> 00:04:15.814
So once we have all that, you probably
wanna do is make a new folder somewhere,

81
00:04:15.814 --> 00:04:18.080
call a source or app or something.

82
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.290
And that's where you gonna write your
code, so your code is gonna go in there.

83
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.501
So once all that's done, all you can do
is now, you can just run react-native.

84
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:33.057
Actually, can just run npm start,
but for me, sometimes it breaks,

85
00:04:33.057 --> 00:04:34.395
let's see what happens.

86
00:04:34.395 --> 00:04:38.383
So if you are in npm start,
let's actually just look at the command.

87
00:04:38.383 --> 00:04:41.391
Yeah, it's gonna start to see like,
this actually breaks to me sometime,

88
00:04:41.391 --> 00:04:42.668
because of permission errors.

89
00:04:42.668 --> 00:04:45.892
So instead what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna run react-native,

90
00:04:48.903 --> 00:04:52.126
&gt;&gt; Scott: Run-android.

91
00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:54.325
So I'm mainly gonna be
running this on Android.

92
00:04:54.325 --> 00:04:55.333
We gonna iOS too, but

93
00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:58.979
once we go both of them, I'm just gonna
stick with Android and go from there.

94
00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.225
It's just been easier for me as far as a
far as developing with gene motions stuff.

95
00:05:02.225 --> 00:05:05.879
So when you want t run Android what's
gonna do is going to look for a device by

96
00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:09.939
Android device on your computer simulated
or a device that you have plugged up right

97
00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:13.651
now I'm not writing in later I don't have
a device plugged up so once all this

98
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:18.020
builds and it starts the is going to
crash because it can't build something.

99
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.820
So before you run this, you wanna make
sure you actually have your device.

100
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.590
And if you run on iOS, you have a Mac,

101
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.100
just have Xcode download it with
the simulator set up and you're fine.

102
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.830
You don't have to do anything else.

103
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.120
But for Android, what you want to do is,
you could check, if you run adb

104
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.470
devices here, it'll list all the devices
that you do or do not have attached.

105
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.590
And you can see right now,
I have no devices attached.

106
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.770
If I plug my phone up right now,
and I'll put debugging on it.

107
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.920
It'll show up here.

108
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.710
I'm not going to do that.

109
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.760
I'm actually just going to
use Genymotion instead.

110
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.640
And it already configured a Nexus 5X here,
so I can just start that in Genymotion.

111
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.550
That's just going to start
up this virtual device here.

112
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.580
So we'll let this build.

113
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.932
And also, the emulators for android studio
2 is actually pretty fast now.I don't

114
00:06:03.932 --> 00:06:06.630
know&amp;nbsp;if anybody's ever checked it
out but they're actually pretty good now.

115
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.480
I think they're actually even faster
than Genymotion which is crazy

116
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.780
because they used to be horrible, like
the worst, and now they're pretty good.

117
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.790
But I didn't feel like setting all
that stuff up because I only have like

118
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.850
three gigs left my computer so couldn't
afford to download all those images.

119
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.380
[LAUGH] I know I need to
do something about that.

120
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.360
Anyway, let's bring this,
we'll keep it here for now.

121
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.970
And what we'll do is,
I've got so many things open.

122
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:32.470
Let's do that.

123
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.530
So what we'll do now is,
I'll bring this over here side by side, so

124
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.640
we can see what's happening.

125
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:41.440
There we go.

126
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.020
Cool.
Okay.

127
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.320
So I got my Android phone running.

128
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.490
It's a full Android phone.

129
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.640
You can do everything but
make calls and use the camera.

130
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.170
It's pretty dope.

131
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.650
And now what I want to do is
actually run that command.

132
00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:03.890
So if you head back here I can
run react-native run android.

133
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.270
And remember, if you're running on iOS,
just do run iOS.

134
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.750
I'm doing Android.

135
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.840
Actually, let's just check and
make sure the devices are set up,

136
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.640
adb devices, there it is.

137
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.720
There's our device that we just started.

138
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.300
It's good to go.

139
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.888
So we can just go ahead and
run react If I can type,

140
00:07:22.888 --> 00:07:26.640
native run Android.

141
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.430
Yeah I have an alias for
this cuz it's just so much to type.

142
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.130
So this is going to build
our Android application

143
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.830
using Gradle which is the build
system that Android opted into.

144
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.810
And the first time it's gonna
take a little longer than it

145
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.710
normally would after that because
of caching absentization for

146
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.800
the first I was going
to take a little bit.

147
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.910
So once this bill there's a few
things that's happening here.

148
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.430
You saw that it popped up in this
window over here this new terminal.

149
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.420
This is what's called the reactor
native packager or so

150
00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.420
this is literally just
a server that's running.

151
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.210
That's watching our files using watchman.

152
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.660
Actually that built pretty fast.

153
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.390
I guess I must have cached already.

154
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.990
This is watching our files and this is
going to trance polities and babble just

155
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.090
like we have with out react web app, it's
doing the same thing on another server so

156
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.860
this is just a light service trance
polygraphs watching the files for us.

157
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.100
That's it.
And that in

158
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.830
here you can see it actually built the
application they did all this great stuff.

159
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.420
This is all the great will build
stuff install this case on.

160
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.170
On this device.

161
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.570
BUILD SUCCESSFUL.

162
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.380
So now if we go back and look,
you'll see boom, it went ahead and

163
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.230
it launched the app for us on the device.

164
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:42.710
Let me scoot this over just a little bit.
&gt;&gt; Scott: There we go.

165
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.840
So there is our app.

166
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.850
And we can confirm it's our app because
if we go look at the index.android.js,

167
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:52.390
we'll see the same stuff
inside of the template here.

168
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.150
We'll see, Welcome to React Native,
there it is.

169
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.980
To get started, and all that good stuff.

170
00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.260
Now let's actually take a look at what's
going on in this file really quick.

171
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.140
So we just made a React web app.

172
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:07.140
And we talked about how to use a class and
extend the component.

173
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.200
I mean, this looks exactly the same.

174
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.290
We're making a class called Todo.

175
00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.260
It's actually the same class that we made,
the same name.

176
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.560
We're extending a component here.

177
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.150
We have a render method.

178
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.400
And it's just returning some JSX.

179
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.600
The only difference here is that we're
using these things called views and

180
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.820
text that we didn't use before, instead
we used devs an input that is the only

181
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.610
difference here and I just told you
guys views is literally like a dev and

182
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:37.990
a text is like a some text element like
H1 or P tag that is only difference

183
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:42.040
everything else exactly the same.I
think that's pretty amazing.

184
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.636
So now that we have that,
any questions on this stuff so

185
00:09:47.636 --> 00:09:53.210
far?
&gt;&gt; Scott: No.

186
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:58.190
So those components that we're using
that's what react native provides for us.

187
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:04.230
So we actually import those components
from react native whereas React itself and

188
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.950
the Component class that we're
extending comes from React,

189
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.780
the exact same react we just used on
the web, it's the exact same react.

190
00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.950
The only difference here is where as
on the web we were using react-dom,

191
00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.829
in native we're using react-native.
