00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.742
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.742 --> 00:00:06.547
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So
actually I do a few more things there,

3
00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:09.858
mainly because our
actions are asynchronous.

4
00:00:09.858 --> 00:00:13.939
Actually, I think we're gonna
have a serious actions tomorrow.

5
00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:15.650
This is too complicated.

6
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.065
So we're gonna get into this asynchronous
actions as we will be doing if it will

7
00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:19.748
do instead is.

8
00:00:19.748 --> 00:00:24.960
We'll just do a quick example of like
redux of data state on Reddit here.

9
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.356
So what we'll do is,
first thing is, I'll go ahead and

10
00:00:29.356 --> 00:00:35.444
make Reddit actually a lot more simpler,
and not doing like async stuff now.

11
00:00:35.444 --> 00:00:40.050
It was make it super simple,
and it's really just going

12
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.889
to
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Get a view here, and

13
00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:52.114
it's just going to render this dot
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Props.items.

14
00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:54.835
So we haven't talked about items yet,
because we hadn't made anything, but

15
00:00:54.835 --> 00:00:55.711
I was gonna render that.

16
00:00:55.711 --> 00:01:00.781
And this just going to say, item here.

17
00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.409
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right,
let's start prop stuff post, there we go.

18
00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:14.791
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
all it's gonna do is to create a text,

19
00:01:18.108 --> 00:01:23.795
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: With a posts.name.

20
00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:25.665
That's it, that's all this is gonna do.

21
00:01:25.665 --> 00:01:29.847
It doesn't need a state,
it doesn't even need a constructor.

22
00:01:29.847 --> 00:01:32.433
And in fact,
it doesn't even need to be this.

23
00:01:37.816 --> 00:01:41.201
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Just this now.

24
00:01:47.444 --> 00:01:49.731
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: That's it,
it's just a view.

25
00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:51.810
It's what we call a dumb component.

26
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.341
It doesn't know anything,
it just takes some props which

27
00:01:56.341 --> 00:02:00.785
are gonna be passed in here,
and it's got a return view.

28
00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:06.248
So now we have props, that's it.

29
00:02:06.248 --> 00:02:07.528
So these props are to be passed in.

30
00:02:07.528 --> 00:02:12.658
So now we can take this Reddit thing here,
and we can bring it into our Todo.

31
00:02:12.658 --> 00:02:17.638
And we'll just say, imports Reddit

32
00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:24.021
from,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Reddit,

33
00:02:27.618 --> 00:02:28.887
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And now we can go ahead and

34
00:02:28.887 --> 00:02:31.013
throw this Reddit thing here somewhere.

35
00:02:31.013 --> 00:02:34.729
Let's just throw it, let's get rid of
this Switch, I wrote the Reddit here.

36
00:02:37.162 --> 00:02:38.179
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go.

37
00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:44.118
Ctrl+E,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go.

38
00:02:44.118 --> 00:02:46.599
So now, we have this Reddit thing,
and then now for

39
00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.467
the actual props that we want to pass.

40
00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:51.680
We get them from redux, so
we head back over to Reddit.

41
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.410
We have this connecting right here.

42
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.956
So connect is going to allow us
to connect to the redux store and

43
00:02:56.956 --> 00:02:58.536
get the stuff that we want.

44
00:02:58.536 --> 00:03:00.636
So it's really just a higher
order component, so

45
00:03:00.636 --> 00:03:02.940
we're just gonna go ahead and
wrap this Reddit thing.

46
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.777
So I was gonna call this like,
let's just call this,

47
00:03:08.777 --> 00:03:13.851
we'll call this, I'll just call it Reddit.

48
00:03:13.851 --> 00:03:18.505
And what we're really
gonna export is this,

49
00:03:18.505 --> 00:03:24.511
export this new Reddit not underscore,
equals connect.

50
00:03:24.511 --> 00:03:27.306
So connect is gonna take some other stuff
we're gonna talk about in a minute.

51
00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:31.158
We're gonna pass in Reddit here.

52
00:03:31.158 --> 00:03:34.429
So what we wanna do is we want to
tell connect what state that we want.

53
00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:40.394
So we'll make a function
called mapStateToOrops.

54
00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:44.091
And this is literally gonna map the state
from redux to the properties of this

55
00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:45.090
Reddit component.

56
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.340
And it's just gonna be a function
that returns an objects,

57
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.171
and a function gets access
to the state here like that.

58
00:03:55.171 --> 00:03:56.933
So now we have the state, and

59
00:03:56.933 --> 00:04:01.353
all we can do is we can say the state
that we want in this case is the posts.

60
00:04:01.353 --> 00:04:08.130
So we'll say, post and
it's gonna be state.post.

61
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.931
Actually, it's actually

62
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:19.232
called state.reddit.

63
00:04:19.232 --> 00:04:20.877
It's a lot of follow, I know.

64
00:04:20.877 --> 00:04:24.811
It's [LAUGH] yeah,
this is why I wanted do RXJS, but

65
00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:27.840
we have to set this up like this.

66
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.716
This is all the set up for redux.

67
00:04:30.716 --> 00:04:39.159
It's a lot, but now what we do
is we pass in mapStateToProps.

68
00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:43.020
And we pass in null,
cuz we don't want any actions right now.

69
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.396
And now all the properties I'm sorry,
now that when this state changes,

70
00:04:48.396 --> 00:04:52.714
it's gonna create a property
caught posts on this component,

71
00:04:52.714 --> 00:04:55.338
which we are expecting props.post.

72
00:04:55.338 --> 00:05:01.230
So this prompts.post is this post, which
is the Reddit state that's in the store.

73
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.014
That's gonna change whenever
an action is fired.

74
00:05:05.014 --> 00:05:05.972
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You got a typo in connect.

75
00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:12.903
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Connect, connect,
connect, connect, thank you.

76
00:05:12.903 --> 00:05:14.652
Sweet, so all that's good to go.

77
00:05:14.652 --> 00:05:16.742
So now,
what we'll do well just go ahead and

78
00:05:16.742 --> 00:05:19.300
populate the store with
some default stuff.

79
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.766
So we had over to the reducer,
we'll put in some default stuff in here.

80
00:05:24.766 --> 00:05:29.710
Like name, demo, name, hello, so

81
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.338
we have that, that's good to go.

82
00:05:34.338 --> 00:05:39.731
We got the provider, we got the store,

83
00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:46.935
the reducer, let's refresh this,
wrong button.

84
00:05:46.935 --> 00:05:54.947
Cool, looks I got error on
Reddit JS 16 right here.

85
00:05:57.551 --> 00:05:58.794
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, export const.

86
00:05:58.794 --> 00:05:59.969
There we go.

87
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.963
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Expected
reducer to be a function.

88
00:06:08.963 --> 00:06:12.041
I must have messed up.

89
00:06:15.483 --> 00:06:17.630
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
this should be reducer.

90
00:06:25.622 --> 00:06:31.050
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Const will say,

91
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.542
imports.

92
00:06:34.542 --> 00:06:39.289
The other import distinct redux
got combine reducers redux.

93
00:06:46.886 --> 00:06:48.834
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Redux, there we go.

94
00:06:48.834 --> 00:06:53.411
So we'll combined reducers export const.

95
00:06:53.411 --> 00:06:57.441
Combine reducers, that takes an object and
we've got to Reddit here.

96
00:06:57.441 --> 00:07:02.805
And I was make a new one called like

97
00:07:02.805 --> 00:07:07.410
data that's like nothing.

98
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:12.105
There we go, there we go.

99
00:07:12.105 --> 00:07:14.212
All right, so we got that.

100
00:07:14.212 --> 00:07:18.847
And now all we have to

101
00:07:18.847 --> 00:07:23.482
do is refresh this,

102
00:07:23.482 --> 00:07:27.852
and see what else.

103
00:07:30.458 --> 00:07:33.253
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay,
it's like caught them, was broken loose,

104
00:07:33.253 --> 00:07:34.946
when I restart this thing now.

105
00:07:49.564 --> 00:07:56.393
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Should
be export const reducer

106
00:07:56.393 --> 00:08:01.387
= combineReducers.

107
00:08:01.387 --> 00:08:08.664
So let that build again,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: A lot

108
00:08:08.664 --> 00:08:12.778
of moving pieces here.

109
00:08:12.778 --> 00:08:18.979
While we wait for this to build,
questions on redux.

110
00:08:18.979 --> 00:08:23.585
You know why we even need in
the first place and why the hell,

111
00:08:23.585 --> 00:08:28.212
why do you need it and
why you can ask that the reason that it?

112
00:08:28.212 --> 00:08:28.767
Well go ahead.

113
00:08:28.767 --> 00:08:34.907
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Define our x,
I feel like redux is kind of heavy.

114
00:08:34.907 --> 00:08:36.450
There's just so
many places if that there's so

115
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:37.657
many places that you have to update.

116
00:08:37.657 --> 00:08:39.402
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There's too much
boilerplate for me, right?

117
00:08:39.402 --> 00:08:40.764
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I like the result this

118
00:08:40.764 --> 00:08:42.441
is a lot of boilerplate, you saw.

119
00:08:42.441 --> 00:08:45.308
We only have 1 reducer,

120
00:08:45.308 --> 00:08:50.230
I have 30 reducers, it's ridiculous.

121
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.628
But yeah, I mean.

122
00:08:52.628 --> 00:08:56.905
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Also it's kind of like
you kind of just search around for

123
00:08:56.905 --> 00:08:58.909
what's consuming what?

124
00:08:58.909 --> 00:09:00.208
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Right, yeah.

125
00:09:00.208 --> 00:09:04.114
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Reducers could be all
over the place listening to one

126
00:09:04.114 --> 00:09:05.234
endpoint
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah.

127
00:09:05.234 --> 00:09:07.027
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And action.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I always mess up on typos

128
00:09:07.027 --> 00:09:08.379
with the action types.

129
00:09:08.379 --> 00:09:09.960
So then I gotta go back and change a bit.

130
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.838
Yes?

131
00:09:10.838 --> 00:09:12.354
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Careful, things in there.

132
00:09:12.354 --> 00:09:14.788
Charles M, has a comment on why we use it.

133
00:09:14.788 --> 00:09:18.460
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This kind
of like event emitters.

134
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:23.500
No, not really, no they're not really,
so much as event emitters.

135
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.258
It's more like a single store,
so you have a single store and

136
00:09:28.258 --> 00:09:35.456
you're not really emitting events, you're
actually subscribing to one state changes.

137
00:09:35.456 --> 00:09:37.723
Instead of admitting any event and
like hey,

138
00:09:37.723 --> 00:09:40.177
I just wanna do this when
this event is admitted.

139
00:09:40.177 --> 00:09:44.948
It has really not a lot, I mean there
are events in the Redux system.

140
00:09:44.948 --> 00:09:48.280
But you, as a consumer of the Redux API,

141
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.202
you're not actually
tying into those events.

142
00:09:52.202 --> 00:09:56.247
You're just saying, hey, when a state
changes just rerender yourself and

143
00:09:56.247 --> 00:09:57.400
that's it.

144
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:02.742
But you could do the same thing with
event emitters like Angular 2 does,

145
00:10:02.742 --> 00:10:05.028
with event emitters and RxJS.

146
00:10:05.028 --> 00:10:08.020
Does the reducer name
need to match the state?

147
00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:13.450
Yes, the reducer name needs to match

148
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:18.890
whatever you combine, where is at?

149
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:24.545
Yes, it needs some,
wait where, there we go.

150
00:10:24.545 --> 00:10:26.917
It needs to match whatever
you put into combine reducer.

151
00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:32.049
So now I have a state card Reddit and
then if I made another one,

152
00:10:32.049 --> 00:10:35.129
let's make another one real quick.

153
00:10:35.129 --> 00:10:41.392
Let's just say, const data,
this one also has to stays the same thing.

154
00:10:41.392 --> 00:10:47.153
It was a state is an object and an action,

155
00:10:47.153 --> 00:10:52.579
and I'm not gonna say that right now.

156
00:10:52.579 --> 00:10:56.484
All we do is we'll just say, return state.

157
00:10:56.484 --> 00:11:01.219
So now that we have two reducers,
what we would do, oops, wrong syntax.

158
00:11:01.219 --> 00:11:05.382
Now we have two reduces,
what we would do is,

159
00:11:05.382 --> 00:11:08.898
if I come down here and put comma data.

160
00:11:08.898 --> 00:11:13.045
Now there's gonna be a state tree
inside the redux store that has Reddit

161
00:11:13.045 --> 00:11:15.060
property and then data property.

162
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.096
And they're both gonna be name space
of these two reduces right here.

163
00:11:19.096 --> 00:11:21.627
The data reducer and a Reddit reducer.

164
00:11:25.938 --> 00:11:28.119
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, okay,
I think that was only two.

165
00:11:28.119 --> 00:11:31.186
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: To define Rx
to be like lighter weight.

166
00:11:31.186 --> 00:11:33.904
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
Rx is definitely lighter weight, and

167
00:11:33.904 --> 00:11:37.632
you can do all this in like five
lines of code, it's like one.

168
00:11:37.632 --> 00:11:40.571
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: The first code, but
the libraries office weighed more, right?

169
00:11:40.571 --> 00:11:42.408
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
the library itself is huge.

170
00:11:42.408 --> 00:11:45.628
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Redux is like a 100 line and

171
00:11:45.628 --> 00:11:48.347
Rx is like 1,000s of lines.

172
00:11:48.347 --> 00:11:50.913
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, that's also true.

173
00:11:50.913 --> 00:11:53.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you
ever played with cursors?

174
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.121
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No, I haven't.

175
00:11:54.121 --> 00:12:00.114
I never play with that, I've got a chance,
I heard crazy things about it though.

176
00:12:00.114 --> 00:12:01.711
Yes, so where were we?

177
00:12:01.711 --> 00:12:05.151
Yes, so we've got that, next thing we
need to do is we've got the story.

178
00:12:05.151 --> 00:12:09.945
Let's run this,
looks like my simulator ran, but

179
00:12:09.945 --> 00:12:14.975
didn't run as I tried to
start it while I was running.

180
00:12:14.975 --> 00:12:17.917
So I got it start it again,
it's really annoying.

181
00:12:17.917 --> 00:12:19.658
Man this is eating up into the time.

182
00:12:19.658 --> 00:12:26.836
I might be wanna get to the thing
that I really want to get it today.

183
00:12:30.845 --> 00:12:35.589
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, this is building
again, this is sometimes this happens.

184
00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:38.997
It just crashed, and you got to start
emulator up again, but I promise this is

185
00:12:38.997 --> 00:12:42.629
actually fast compared to what it used to
be a couple months ago, it was horrible.

186
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:46.986
Not react native, but just like
emulator stories in general, great.

187
00:12:46.986 --> 00:12:53.828
So now we can run this again,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Let that build,

188
00:12:53.828 --> 00:12:55.938
now let's double check our stuff here.

189
00:12:55.938 --> 00:13:01.909
Let's head over to our Todo, we have the
Reddit thing in here, or here at the top.

190
00:13:01.909 --> 00:13:06.338
And insdie our Reddit,
it's just subscribing to it's own stuff,

191
00:13:06.338 --> 00:13:07.978
like this posters here.

192
00:13:07.978 --> 00:13:10.130
Cool, all right, so
it didn't break this time.

193
00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:14.121
Looks good, some promise stuff going on,
that's fine.

194
00:13:14.121 --> 00:13:15.570
The Reddit stuff, so

195
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:20.572
the Reddit stuff is rendering those
names in our store right now, right?

196
00:13:20.572 --> 00:13:24.923
Cuz we look, we're saying,
props.postop.map Text post.name.

197
00:13:24.923 --> 00:13:28.837
If you're gonna look in reducer,
there they are, demo and hello.

198
00:13:28.837 --> 00:13:30.530
It's going ahead and it's doing that.

199
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:35.848
So now, if I create an action that adds
to that, you'll see that it all updated.

200
00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:37.620
So let's create an action that does that.
