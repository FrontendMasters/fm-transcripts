00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.967
All right now we are going
to remove this and

2
00:00:04.967 --> 00:00:09.035
we are going to go to the next exercise.

3
00:00:09.035 --> 00:00:13.690
And so you're going to see
a few things over here.

4
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.064
And so what we want to do is,
we want to use data attributes to

5
00:00:19.064 --> 00:00:24.119
conditionally have this go
between different states.

6
00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.013
So, let me just show you the end result.

7
00:00:28.013 --> 00:00:32.861
And if you do wanna see
the end results at any time,

8
00:00:32.861 --> 00:00:37.029
you could also go to indec.final.html.

9
00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:40.705
So what we want to happen is,
of course when you type

10
00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:45.594
in an email then you click Subscribe
it's gonna go to subscribing.

11
00:00:45.594 --> 00:00:47.856
And then it's going to
go to the interstate and

12
00:00:47.856 --> 00:00:49.654
then it's gonna shake a little bit.

13
00:00:49.654 --> 00:00:54.299
So you want to define that shaking
animation only for the error state.

14
00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.480
And again, you're going to use data
attributes in order to do that.

15
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.361
So we click again.

16
00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:01.765
And it goes to success.

17
00:01:01.765 --> 00:01:04.104
And it's actually going
to do that randomly, so

18
00:01:04.104 --> 00:01:05.764
it might keep going back to error.

19
00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:08.331
In this case, we got lucky and
went to success.

20
00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:17.061
So, yeah, remember we're adding these
animations to each of the specific states.

21
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:19.378
And yeah, have fun.
