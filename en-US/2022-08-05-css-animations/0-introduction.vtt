00:00:00.064 --> 00:00:02.131
Hi, my name is David Khourshid, and

2
00:00:02.131 --> 00:00:06.953
I'm really excited to give this workshop
on Frontend Masters about CSS animations.

3
00:00:06.953 --> 00:00:10.143
So I've been a web developer for
over ten years.

4
00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:14.407
And I've been actually really
passionate about CSS animations,

5
00:00:14.407 --> 00:00:18.376
frontend technologies, and
cutting edge user interfaces.

6
00:00:18.376 --> 00:00:23.424
So one of my favorite things to
do is actually take dribbles and

7
00:00:23.424 --> 00:00:26.054
recreate them in just pure CSS.

8
00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:30.187
And that's something that I did a long
time ago right when I was starting to

9
00:00:30.187 --> 00:00:33.318
learn JavaScript, but
I was still pretty new to it, and

10
00:00:33.318 --> 00:00:35.268
I really wanted to get good at CSS.

11
00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:39.982
So here's an example of a CSS-only weather
app concept that I did a few years ago.

12
00:00:39.982 --> 00:00:46.424
You could see we have clouds moving,
rain falling, snow falling as well.

13
00:00:46.424 --> 00:00:50.600
And so I basically took a dribble
that I really liked, and

14
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.002
there's a ton of animations that
are just really, really interesting.

15
00:00:56.002 --> 00:01:01.868
And I challenged myself to see how
I could do this with just CSS or

16
00:01:01.868 --> 00:01:05.754
CSS and only a sprinkling of JavaScript.

17
00:01:05.754 --> 00:01:09.945
And so
it's been a really fun hobby of mine.

18
00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:12.470
I tried to take it to the extreme,

19
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.174
even doing things like creating
a calendar app with only CSS.

20
00:01:17.174 --> 00:01:20.083
So I continued on this journey.

21
00:01:20.083 --> 00:01:24.350
And the more I learned about
JavaScript and how it could be used and

22
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.394
sprinkled onto these animations,
the more creative potential that I saw for

23
00:01:29.394 --> 00:01:32.514
the types of animations
that you could create.

24
00:01:32.514 --> 00:01:35.607
So I also really got into state machines.

25
00:01:35.607 --> 00:01:38.750
And I do have some courses on
Frontend Masters about X-state and

26
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.542
state machines that I really
encourage you to check out,

27
00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:45.286
because state machines are actually
really related to animations as well.

28
00:01:45.286 --> 00:01:49.903
Take this choose or
design your week example.

29
00:01:49.903 --> 00:01:53.571
We could select the days of the week,
throw them away.

30
00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:56.122
I could extend Sunday
to as long as I want.

31
00:01:56.122 --> 00:02:01.589
And so doing this with just CSS,
of course, is pretty much impossible.

32
00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:04.499
And even doing it with
JavaScript is pretty hard,

33
00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:08.939
unless you understand the techniques
of doing state-based animations and

34
00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.318
modeling your states and transitions.

35
00:02:11.318 --> 00:02:14.893
So that you could cleanly
define the animations between

36
00:02:14.893 --> 00:02:19.771
states in a way that's actually easily
maintainable and understandable.

37
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:22.710
So I will be going over
that in this workshop, and

38
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.879
we're gonna be going over
a lot of things actually.

39
00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.540
One of the things we're gonna be going
over is also layouts animations,

40
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.574
which are actually pretty common, but
they're not the easiest to implement.

41
00:02:33.574 --> 00:02:38.916
So I'm really excited to talk about
techniques that we could use for

42
00:02:38.916 --> 00:02:39.953
doing that.

43
00:02:39.953 --> 00:02:41.914
And at the end of the workshop,

44
00:02:41.914 --> 00:02:46.002
we're also going to be talking
about reactive animations too.

45
00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:51.637
So this is a more advanced concept that
leans more on JavaScript rather than CSS.

46
00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:55.589
But we are going to be learning principles
of how we could use JavaScript and

47
00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:59.104
CSS together, so that they're not
fighting with each other, but

48
00:02:59.104 --> 00:03:00.944
rather they're collaborating.

49
00:03:00.944 --> 00:03:05.734
So that we could share these dynamic
values between both realms, and

50
00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:09.132
create some really cool
animations as a result.

51
00:03:09.132 --> 00:03:13.898
So for a while, I've been actually doing
a live stream called the keyframers

52
00:03:13.898 --> 00:03:18.686
about every week or every other week
with my friend, Steven Shaw, in Texas.

53
00:03:18.686 --> 00:03:23.183
And so on the keyframers,
we make animations from dribbles,

54
00:03:23.183 --> 00:03:28.547
basically, that we just find really
interesting, like I talked about.

55
00:03:28.547 --> 00:03:30.569
And so we would take these animations.

56
00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.375
And in a one to two-hour stream, we would
try to recreate them from scratch, and

57
00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:38.783
that's basically going to be
the feel of this workshop.

58
00:03:38.783 --> 00:03:43.606
We're going to be just working
on the animations with HTML,

59
00:03:43.606 --> 00:03:47.021
CSS, and just a little bit of JavaScript.

60
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:50.234
There's gonna be no frameworks in here,
and

61
00:03:50.234 --> 00:03:53.447
we're actually also
going to be using SCSS,

62
00:03:53.447 --> 00:03:58.871
which is a Sass preprocessor language
that really looks and feels like CSS.

63
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.781
If you don't know SCSS, then don't worry,

64
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:06.695
because you could use normal CSS in SCSS,
and it's going to work just fine.

65
00:04:06.695 --> 00:04:13.158
But we'll explain some of the SCSS
specific things in this workshop.

66
00:04:13.158 --> 00:04:16.403
So why are CSS animations important?

67
00:04:16.403 --> 00:04:20.367
It seems like something that we
could just sprinkle on to websites.

68
00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:26.062
And it always seems like an afterthoughts
too, just because CSS animations and

69
00:04:26.062 --> 00:04:30.992
animations in general aren't really
often talked about when we're

70
00:04:30.992 --> 00:04:35.931
talking about designing websites or
implementing functionality.

71
00:04:35.931 --> 00:04:38.355
But they're actually really important.

72
00:04:38.355 --> 00:04:42.850
In general,
animations bring user interfaces to life.

73
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.419
And that's why I really enjoy
when I see a website or

74
00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.488
a web app with some thoughtful,
meaningful animations.

75
00:04:50.488 --> 00:04:54.366
And that's important,
because animations need to be subtle.

76
00:04:54.366 --> 00:04:58.990
But they also need to be meaningful,
in that they guide the user to doing

77
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.614
something, or to indicating what can
be done, or to telling the user,

78
00:05:03.614 --> 00:05:06.180
this is something that just happened.

79
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.278
And so this is important for
the explainability aspect.

80
00:05:10.278 --> 00:05:14.980
When a user is using your application,
they want to understand in

81
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.688
an intuitive way just what is
happening in the app or the website.

82
00:05:19.688 --> 00:05:23.724
And so there is a lot of examples of
websites that really do this well.

83
00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:27.155
I really like Linear,
both their landing pages.

84
00:05:27.155 --> 00:05:29.944
And also the actual web
app has some really

85
00:05:29.944 --> 00:05:34.807
nice subtle animations that really
clue in onto this just disappeared,

86
00:05:34.807 --> 00:05:39.126
this just appeared, this came from here,
this is going there.

87
00:05:39.126 --> 00:05:44.488
It really brings that extra layer
polish to the user interface,

88
00:05:44.488 --> 00:05:47.477
and to the user experience as well.

89
00:05:47.477 --> 00:05:49.739
Stripe, of course,
is another great example.

90
00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:54.350
Of course,
their menu is just beautiful to look at.

91
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.482
And also they have nice subtle
animations on things like buttons,

92
00:05:58.482 --> 00:06:02.192
where you could see the arrow
is sort of moving to the right.

93
00:06:02.192 --> 00:06:07.090
And so this is the kind of thing that
really makes you trust the software that

94
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.589
you're using and
also brings delight to the user, so

95
00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:15.756
that they're encouraged to use the
websites and the applications a lot more.

96
00:06:15.756 --> 00:06:18.309
And you could get really
whimsical with this.

97
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:20.562
So this is the Superlist website,

98
00:06:20.562 --> 00:06:24.691
where it's having a lot of fun
with some reactive animations.

99
00:06:24.691 --> 00:06:29.357
And it also indicates what this
app is about in terms of feel.

100
00:06:29.357 --> 00:06:34.229
So we could see that this app is
just something like a notepad,

101
00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:39.024
where we have these pen marks,
and these are even animated.

102
00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:44.647
So if we scroll down, you could see
just different things being highlighted.

103
00:06:44.647 --> 00:06:49.628
And yeah, so
this is a great example of animation too,

104
00:06:49.628 --> 00:06:54.518
where it doesn't have to be sterile or
super subtle.

105
00:06:54.518 --> 00:06:57.961
It really depends on what kind
of design you wanna go for.

106
00:06:57.961 --> 00:07:02.283
But the main point is that I
really want you to make designs or

107
00:07:02.283 --> 00:07:07.827
animations that are meaningful and
delightful and also not too obtrusive.

108
00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:12.769
And one of the biggest reasons I'm giving
this workshop too is because animation and

109
00:07:12.769 --> 00:07:15.901
motion design, in general,
should be part of the way

110
00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:19.884
that you think about designing and
implementing user interfaces.

111
00:07:19.884 --> 00:07:24.759
And in fact, a lot of the techniques that
we're gonna talk about apply to just

112
00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:29.496
better CSS techniques in general,
even if you're not using animations.

113
00:07:29.496 --> 00:07:32.650
So let's talk about what we're
going to be working from.

114
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:40.033
The repo is at
github.com/davidkpiano/frontend-masters--

115
00:07:40.033 --> 00:07:40.628
CSS.

116
00:07:40.628 --> 00:07:43.835
So you could find it on my GitHub, and

117
00:07:43.835 --> 00:07:48.081
this is a basic HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript app.

118
00:07:48.081 --> 00:07:51.546
Of course,
we're using Sass as a preprocessor, but

119
00:07:51.546 --> 00:07:55.860
you could use CSS if you want to,
it's going to work just the same.

120
00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:01.226
To get started, you just run npm
install in the root of this repo,

121
00:08:01.226 --> 00:08:02.990
and then npm run dev.

122
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:09.044
So what this is going to do is it's going
to start our app at localhost:3000,

123
00:08:09.044 --> 00:08:14.680
where there's a bunch of lessons in here,
and also an in-flight example.

124
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.020
So this is what it's going to look like.

125
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.802
We have all the lessons on the main
page over here, and a ball over here,

126
00:08:21.802 --> 00:08:24.929
and this is going to be
useful as a scratchpad.

127
00:08:24.929 --> 00:08:30.117
So in case you want to try any of the
animation techniques that we talked about,

128
00:08:30.117 --> 00:08:34.203
go to index.html or
style.scss on the root of this repo, and

129
00:08:34.203 --> 00:08:36.186
you could animate this ball.

130
00:08:36.186 --> 00:08:40.003
And we're gonna be working
from this scratch pad,

131
00:08:40.003 --> 00:08:42.584
index page a lot in this workshop.

132
00:08:42.584 --> 00:08:45.403
So we're going to be
making a few examples.

133
00:08:45.403 --> 00:08:50.286
One of them is this signup form,
where we're going to be adding some subtle

134
00:08:50.286 --> 00:08:54.096
animations to it,
including state-based animations.

135
00:08:54.096 --> 00:08:57.073
And of course,
you could get as whimsical as you want.

136
00:08:57.073 --> 00:09:00.736
We're also going to be talking
about layout animations too.

137
00:09:00.736 --> 00:09:06.214
So things such as when you don't have
a defined position or size, and you need

138
00:09:06.214 --> 00:09:11.720
to read that from JavaScript and smoothly
animate from one state to another.

139
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.747
We're gonna be talking about
techniques for doing that.

140
00:09:14.747 --> 00:09:20.020
We're also going to be talking, of course,
about reactive animations, such

141
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:24.994
as this one that uses the lerp technique
to follow the mouse cursor around.

142
00:09:24.994 --> 00:09:29.548
And then finally, we're going to be
seeing how we could apply these kinds of

143
00:09:29.548 --> 00:09:33.197
animations to a real world app,
or at least, a shell of one.

144
00:09:33.197 --> 00:09:37.785
So this uses state-based animations,
transitions, and

145
00:09:37.785 --> 00:09:42.844
things like that, in order to give
this app a nice, smooth feel.

146
00:09:42.844 --> 00:09:46.618
So I just want to remind you
that this workshop, of course,

147
00:09:46.618 --> 00:09:51.084
is about CSS animations, which means
that it is a creative workshop.

148
00:09:51.084 --> 00:09:52.998
There's no right or wrong answers.

149
00:09:52.998 --> 00:09:57.761
And the main points in this workshop
that I want you to take away is all

150
00:09:57.761 --> 00:10:01.621
the different animation techniques and
principles.

151
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:07.085
Including how to do transitions,
animations, how to use a JavaScript

152
00:10:07.085 --> 00:10:12.646
to communicate with CSS in order to
create any animation you would like.

153
00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:16.756
And the exercises we're going to be
doing in this workshop, like I said,

154
00:10:16.756 --> 00:10:18.361
there's no wrong answers.

155
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:21.234
So I really encourage you to be creative,
and

156
00:10:21.234 --> 00:10:25.247
add whatever kinds of animations
that you would like in there.
