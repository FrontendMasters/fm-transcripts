00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:02.759
As an exercise what I want you to do,

2
00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:07.323
now that we solved the problem
of the parents being flipped and

3
00:00:07.323 --> 00:00:12.796
unintentionally stretching the child
by using before pseudo elements.

4
00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:17.314
I want you to apply the same flip
technique to this caption over here.

5
00:00:17.314 --> 00:00:21.494
So if you want it's pretty much copy and
paste code,

6
00:00:21.494 --> 00:00:24.819
where you could use
exactly what we did for

7
00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:28.820
these element and
just apply it to the second one.

8
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.840
Or you could turn this into a function,
which might be better.

9
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.713
And so if you want help doing that
just look at index.final.html and

10
00:00:35.713 --> 00:00:38.270
it should give you some ideas for
doing that.
