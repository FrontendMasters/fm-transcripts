00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:02.171
Now we're gonna be doing
a little bit of coding.

2
00:00:02.171 --> 00:00:06.054
And we're gonna be talking
first about CSS transitions and

3
00:00:06.054 --> 00:00:09.094
especially how they
differ from animations.

4
00:00:09.094 --> 00:00:16.148
So, in a general sense, a transition
is the in between, between states.

5
00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:19.760
So that's why,
with some animation libraries and

6
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.198
tools you've also heard of them?

7
00:00:22.198 --> 00:00:24.709
I'm referring to what are called twins.

8
00:00:24.709 --> 00:00:27.086
And so these twins are, like I said,

9
00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:32.624
the in between states of like you have one
discrete state and another discrete state.

10
00:00:32.624 --> 00:00:36.577
And he wanna you can just go
between those states over time.

11
00:00:36.577 --> 00:00:41.719
So you could transition and a lot of
things in CSS like we talked about.

12
00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.608
You could transition color,

13
00:00:43.608 --> 00:00:47.999
even things like font size which
again I don't recommend you doing.

14
00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.940
And things like transforms and opacity.

15
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.743
So you use transitions when
you wanna define a way like

16
00:00:55.743 --> 00:00:59.908
just it's not a strictly
defined animation,

17
00:00:59.908 --> 00:01:05.584
it's more like I am gonna say what
each of the states are in CSS.

18
00:01:05.584 --> 00:01:09.805
And I just want CSS to be responsible for
smoothly transitioning between

19
00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:14.800
those states and not really caring about
exactly what happens between those states.

20
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.672
But instead of saying, get me from point A
to point B in the smoothest way possible.

21
00:01:20.672 --> 00:01:26.897
All right, so to do CSS transitions, we're
gonna be working from this file over here.

22
00:01:26.897 --> 00:01:30.728
It's called 01_transitions.

23
00:01:30.728 --> 00:01:35.872
And so in the index.HTML we
have a simple form over here.

24
00:01:35.872 --> 00:01:39.119
And I'm gonna get rid of this on click.

25
00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.288
And so this form hasn't input any button.

26
00:01:42.288 --> 00:01:48.310
So this is the basic thing that we're
gonna be animating in this exercise,

27
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.612
but first we're gonna be of
course talking about what

28
00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:55.878
transitions actually look like in CSS.

29
00:01:55.878 --> 00:02:00.626
Okay so let me delete this.

30
00:02:00.626 --> 00:02:02.795
Let's go back to our scratch pad.

31
00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:08.810
Let's say that we wanna animate
this fall in different states.

32
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.126
So first of all,

33
00:02:10.126 --> 00:02:16.059
there's a lot of states in CSS which
are built into to each of the elements.

34
00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:21.531
And you could toggle these states
like by going over here and

35
00:02:21.531 --> 00:02:26.573
clicking this :hov which stands for
hover in styles.

36
00:02:26.573 --> 00:02:31.683
And so there's a few elements states that
you could toggle between such as active,

37
00:02:31.683 --> 00:02:35.917
focus, focus within, target,
hover, visited or focus visible.

38
00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:40.749
So we're gonna be using hover just
because that's an easy way to show

39
00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.848
the difference between different states.

40
00:02:43.848 --> 00:02:49.686
And I'm gonna be setting
a solid background color for

41
00:02:49.686 --> 00:02:52.545
this just to illustrate.

42
00:02:52.545 --> 00:02:57.633
And let's see that when we
hover over the ball, so, hover.

43
00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:00.089
We want the backgrounds
to instead be blue.

44
00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.677
So what's gonna happen right now
is that when I hover over it,

45
00:03:07.677 --> 00:03:11.098
it's gonna immediately transition to blue.

46
00:03:11.098 --> 00:03:15.470
And the reason is because there
is no transition to find.

47
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.528
No transition of any
length of time to find so

48
00:03:18.528 --> 00:03:21.429
it's just gonna immediately go to blue.

49
00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:27.104
So there's a few properties that we could
talk about to define how to smoothly

50
00:03:27.104 --> 00:03:32.181
transition between these two stats
from this reddish color to blue.

51
00:03:32.181 --> 00:03:36.535
And so
the first one is transition-property.

52
00:03:36.535 --> 00:03:40.651
And so this is gonna be the property
that we wanna transition.

53
00:03:40.651 --> 00:03:43.406
It's telling the browser, hey,

54
00:03:43.406 --> 00:03:49.107
this is what we wanna smoothly animate
from one state to another state.

55
00:03:49.107 --> 00:03:51.571
So I'm gonna set this to background, or

56
00:03:51.571 --> 00:03:56.570
you could even do background color because
background is actually a shorthand for

57
00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.441
various things like background color,
background, position, size, etc.

58
00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:05.444
But we'll just do background for now.

59
00:04:05.444 --> 00:04:09.428
And so this alone won't do anything.

60
00:04:09.428 --> 00:04:12.638
We're still gonna get it
immediately gonna blue.

61
00:04:12.638 --> 00:04:17.059
So we're also gonna set
a transition in duration.

62
00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:19.054
And just like we talked about,

63
00:04:19.054 --> 00:04:22.745
this is how long it takes to
get from one state to another.

64
00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:26.752
And so let's set this to one second.

65
00:04:26.752 --> 00:04:28.286
So now when we hover,

66
00:04:28.286 --> 00:04:33.161
it's actually going pretty smoothly
transition from red to blue.

67
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:35.007
It feels nice, it's not even linear.

68
00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:39.285
So let's take a look at
what's happening over here.

69
00:04:39.285 --> 00:04:41.916
We're gonna move this up a little bit.

70
00:04:41.916 --> 00:04:45.764
All right, so we have the transition
property and the transition duration.

71
00:04:45.764 --> 00:04:48.814
The default transition easing, or

72
00:04:48.814 --> 00:04:53.089
the transition timing
function is gonna be ease.

73
00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:56.291
This might be browser specific, but

74
00:04:56.291 --> 00:05:01.258
I believe that for Chrome it is and
so let's change that.

75
00:05:01.258 --> 00:05:06.798
So let's say transition timing
function and make it linear.

76
00:05:06.798 --> 00:05:10.915
Here you're gonna notice it's
not gonna be as smooth or

77
00:05:10.915 --> 00:05:14.330
it's sorta hard to tell
with with colors but,

78
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.548
you could see the transition
timing function over here.

79
00:05:18.548 --> 00:05:21.428
And that's another side note, by the way.

80
00:05:21.428 --> 00:05:25.967
When it comes to movement,
such as changing the transform and

81
00:05:25.967 --> 00:05:28.498
things such as color and opacity,

82
00:05:28.498 --> 00:05:33.054
your timing functions are gonna
feel a little bit different.

83
00:05:33.054 --> 00:05:39.034
Like for example, for the color it
might not even make sense to use

84
00:05:39.034 --> 00:05:45.139
in easing such as ease in or ease and
outer, a custom cubic Bezier.

85
00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.394
And you might wanna stick with linear or

86
00:05:47.394 --> 00:05:51.577
you might wanna stick with whatever
the browser the browser default is.

87
00:05:51.577 --> 00:05:57.032
So yeah, let's make a little
bit of a better example here.

88
00:05:57.032 --> 00:06:02.261
I'm actually gonna push this ball to
the left or to the right actually and

89
00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:05.872
just make it in the center,
or almost the center.

90
00:06:05.872 --> 00:06:09.323
Centering in CSS is hard,
actually it's not hard but

91
00:06:09.323 --> 00:06:11.401
like this is almost the center.

92
00:06:11.401 --> 00:06:16.226
And so what we're gonna do is we're
actually gonna change the size now too.

93
00:06:16.226 --> 00:06:21.979
Now, like we talked about, what you really
wanna do is animate the transform and

94
00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:27.152
opacity instead of doing things like
animating the width or the height.

95
00:06:27.152 --> 00:06:30.224
So, that's exactly what we're gonna do.

96
00:06:30.224 --> 00:06:35.541
We are gonna transform and
we are gonna use the scale

97
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:40.251
value to say hey I want
this to be twice as big.

98
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:43.829
So now when we hover over it's pretty big.

99
00:06:43.829 --> 00:06:46.167
But it's it's not animating yet.

100
00:06:46.167 --> 00:06:51.837
So does anyone know why it's
not transitioning smoothly?

101
00:06:51.837 --> 00:06:55.003
&gt;&gt; Because we only have
transition property on.

102
00:06:55.003 --> 00:06:58.000
We don't have transition
property on the transform.

103
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.539
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

104
00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:01.708
So we only have a transition
property on the background.

105
00:07:01.708 --> 00:07:06.134
So that's something really useful to know,
like when you define

106
00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:10.970
the property it's only gonna apply
that transition to that property.

107
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:17.894
Now, if you're lazy, short on time you
could do transition property all and

108
00:07:17.894 --> 00:07:24.513
so that is gonna transition basically
anything that is transition able.

109
00:07:24.513 --> 00:07:30.095
So when we hover over this, we see that
it's getting bigger and then smaller.

110
00:07:30.095 --> 00:07:35.870
But now, let's say, of course,
we only wanna transition.

111
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:41.258
Let's say we only wanna do the transform
so I could do that and so now you're gonna

112
00:07:41.258 --> 00:07:46.741
see that it's gonna smoothly expand but
it's immediately gonna change to blue.

113
00:07:46.741 --> 00:07:49.877
And immediately changed back to red.

114
00:07:49.877 --> 00:07:53.625
Now, if you have some other properties,
for example,

115
00:07:53.625 --> 00:07:56.670
let's say I add a opacity of 0.5 to hover.

116
00:07:59.222 --> 00:08:05.270
And now let's say that we do wanna
animate the background color and

117
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:12.621
the transition but we don't wanna animate
or sorry transition the the opacity.

118
00:08:12.621 --> 00:08:17.144
So if we do all it is gonna do
all three of those properties, so

119
00:08:17.144 --> 00:08:20.872
we're gonna have it a little
bit transparency and

120
00:08:20.872 --> 00:08:24.802
it's gonna smoothly animate
to everything there.

121
00:08:24.802 --> 00:08:26.998
But with transition property,

122
00:08:26.998 --> 00:08:32.292
you could actually specify specific
properties that you wanna transition.

123
00:08:32.292 --> 00:08:38.665
So we could say I only wanna transition
the background and the transform.

124
00:08:38.665 --> 00:08:45.224
So now you're gonna see that the opacity
immediately transitions to transparence.

125
00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:52.667
The color smoothly animates and
the transform smoothly animates as well.

126
00:08:52.667 --> 00:08:57.384
Now, additionally and so this is one of
the really interesting things about CSS.

127
00:08:57.384 --> 00:08:59.923
I'm gonna remove the opacity and

128
00:08:59.923 --> 00:09:05.192
we can also specify different
durations for each of the properties.

129
00:09:05.192 --> 00:09:11.770
So I can say that for the background, we
want that to transition over one second,

130
00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:17.699
but the transform, we might wanna
transition that over three seconds.

131
00:09:17.699 --> 00:09:23.531
So now the color has fully
transitioned after one second but

132
00:09:23.531 --> 00:09:28.205
the scale it takes about
three seconds to do it.

133
00:09:28.205 --> 00:09:33.802
Now same thing here if we're okay
with our background transitioning but

134
00:09:33.802 --> 00:09:38.388
we in a linear way but
we wanna change the timing function for

135
00:09:38.388 --> 00:09:42.715
the transform then we could
just change that over here.

136
00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:48.767
So again this is gonna match
up with transform and.

137
00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:53.726
And ease in out is also gonna
match up with transform.

138
00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:57.190
So it's dependent on the order.

139
00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:02.622
And so now,
we're gonna see that it's gonna scale

140
00:10:02.622 --> 00:10:08.318
smoothly over three seconds
from larger to smaller.

141
00:10:10.945 --> 00:10:16.245
So the last thing I wanna talk
about over here is that not only

142
00:10:16.245 --> 00:10:21.761
can you specify just the overall
transition for an element but

143
00:10:21.761 --> 00:10:27.191
you could also have it's
dependent on which state it's in.

144
00:10:27.191 --> 00:10:31.071
So, let's say that when I over out, I so

145
00:10:31.071 --> 00:10:37.132
actually I'm gonna move this over here,
just so that you see.

146
00:10:37.132 --> 00:10:41.372
And we're gonna say transition
duration 0 seconds.

147
00:10:41.372 --> 00:10:43.235
One other quick notes.

148
00:10:43.235 --> 00:10:47.279
You cannot do transition duration zero and

149
00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:51.218
that's because CSS at least for timing.

150
00:10:51.218 --> 00:10:56.142
So for both animations and
transitions it needs to know the unit.

151
00:10:56.142 --> 00:11:01.016
You might think that's a little bit silly
because zero milliseconds is the same

152
00:11:01.016 --> 00:11:04.362
thing as zero seconds but
your animation won't work or

153
00:11:04.362 --> 00:11:09.182
the zero second duration will not work
unless you specify the unit over there.

154
00:11:09.182 --> 00:11:14.900
So that's a code that I found many years
ago and it sorta broke all my animations

155
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:20.201
so I'm passing it on to you so you not
to make the same mistake that I made.

156
00:11:20.201 --> 00:11:23.456
All right, so
now let's look at what happens.

157
00:11:23.456 --> 00:11:27.372
When you hover over it,
it's gonna smoothly transition but

158
00:11:27.372 --> 00:11:30.917
when you hover out it's
gonna immediately snap back.

159
00:11:30.917 --> 00:11:36.655
And so that goes to show you that we
could actually change the different

160
00:11:36.655 --> 00:11:41.528
transition properties dependent
on which state it's in.

161
00:11:41.528 --> 00:11:43.509
So when we're hovering over it,

162
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:48.058
it's gonna be taking whatever transition
values you define in that state.

163
00:11:48.058 --> 00:11:52.976
And when it's not hovered,
it's gonna use this quicker duration.

164
00:11:52.976 --> 00:11:56.441
So hover, it's gonna take its time.

165
00:11:56.441 --> 00:11:57.745
I'm gonna help her out.

166
00:11:57.745 --> 00:12:01.007
It's gonna go really fast and snap back.

167
00:12:02.378 --> 00:12:08.205
Now, tying this all
together I always recommend

168
00:12:08.205 --> 00:12:15.179
especially to avoid confusion
to specify each property.

169
00:12:15.179 --> 00:12:19.620
Or yeah, so each declaration
over here transition property,

170
00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:25.675
transition timing function, transition
duration and also even transition delay.

171
00:12:25.675 --> 00:12:30.568
So if we have transition delay of 0.5
seconds, then you could see that when we

172
00:12:30.568 --> 00:12:34.731
hover, it takes half a second before
it actually starts working and

173
00:12:34.731 --> 00:12:37.305
then it's gonna immediately snap back.

174
00:12:37.305 --> 00:12:41.191
Okay, but there is a shorthand for
all of this.

175
00:12:41.191 --> 00:12:48.341
So I'm gonna use all for this and
we are gonna let's get rid of this.

176
00:12:50.214 --> 00:12:53.986
And so we're gonna say transition all.

177
00:12:53.986 --> 00:13:00.578
So these are the properties that you're
using and now the order is important here.

178
00:13:00.578 --> 00:13:04.460
We wanna specify the duration first and
then the delay.

179
00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.883
So the duration, we could say 2 seconds.

180
00:13:07.883 --> 00:13:11.751
The delay we could say is 0.5 seconds.

181
00:13:11.751 --> 00:13:15.213
And then we could add
everything else such as

182
00:13:15.213 --> 00:13:19.245
let's say that we just want
this to be ease and out.

183
00:13:19.245 --> 00:13:24.150
And so
what this is gonna be is a shorthand for

184
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:28.135
all of our transition properties.

185
00:13:28.135 --> 00:13:34.361
Now, if you wanna figure out
which properties this expands to.

186
00:13:34.361 --> 00:13:38.748
Then in the depth tools, you could
click this little carrots over here and

187
00:13:38.748 --> 00:13:41.809
you could see, okay,
we're doing property all.

188
00:13:41.809 --> 00:13:47.146
The duration is 2 seconds,
the timing function is ease-in-out and

189
00:13:47.146 --> 00:13:49.412
the delay is 0.5 seconds.

190
00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:54.414
Now, when I'm trying to remember this,
the most important thing is

191
00:13:54.414 --> 00:13:59.776
the order of duration then delay,
because CSS is actually pretty smart.

192
00:13:59.776 --> 00:14:03.619
So that if you put ease-in-out at
the beginning for whatever reason,

193
00:14:03.619 --> 00:14:05.420
it's still gonna work the same.

194
00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:12.999
So just keep the order of the duration and
the delay in mind any questions?

195
00:14:12.999 --> 00:14:17.593
&gt;&gt; What's the downfall of using all
versus naming each property individually?

196
00:14:17.593 --> 00:14:22.988
&gt;&gt; So the downfall is it's just a matter
of not being explicit if you use all then

197
00:14:22.988 --> 00:14:28.146
there are gonna be things that animate
that you might not wanna animate.

198
00:14:28.146 --> 00:14:30.912
And so we just saw a couple
of examples over here.

199
00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:34.800
So in terms of performance and
things like that, again,

200
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.093
if you're only changing things
like transform and opacity and

201
00:14:39.093 --> 00:14:44.360
maybe things like color, then it's not
gonna affect performance too much.

202
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.961
But then if you need to change to
things like left, or margin or

203
00:14:48.961 --> 00:14:53.492
padding, then those are gonna
fall into that all category.

204
00:14:53.492 --> 00:14:55.844
And now you're gonna run
into performance issues.

205
00:14:55.844 --> 00:15:00.212
So a good way to prevent yourself
from that foot gun is by specifying

206
00:15:00.212 --> 00:15:01.385
the properties.

207
00:15:01.385 --> 00:15:07.210
And also,
let's say that we do accidentally add,

208
00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:13.043
like a wonder how this is
gonna look padding 3rem.

209
00:15:13.043 --> 00:15:16.269
So now when we hover over it.

210
00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:18.309
It's actually gonna, wow.

211
00:15:18.309 --> 00:15:19.317
That was a little weird.

212
00:15:19.317 --> 00:15:21.122
So we might say like you know what,

213
00:15:21.122 --> 00:15:23.753
we actually didn't wanna
animate that padding.

214
00:15:23.753 --> 00:15:25.046
I'd like that that just
looks really weird.

215
00:15:25.046 --> 00:15:27.700
And you can also see some of
the janky happening there too.

216
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.897
So, not really too pleasant.

217
00:15:30.897 --> 00:15:34.185
What you could do is even
if you use the shorthand,

218
00:15:34.185 --> 00:15:37.253
you could specify
the properties after that.

219
00:15:37.253 --> 00:15:39.119
And because of how CSS works,

220
00:15:39.119 --> 00:15:43.830
you are overriding those the expanded
transition properties and saying.

221
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:50.032
I hate instead of transition all
we actually want these properties.

222
00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:50.768
So now.

223
00:15:54.392 --> 00:15:57.791
It's gonna apply
the padding immediately and

224
00:15:57.791 --> 00:16:02.941
it's gonna smoothly transition
the properties that you specified.

225
00:16:02.941 --> 00:16:07.432
And again if you look over here
we see that this transition

226
00:16:07.432 --> 00:16:11.653
property is being overwritten
by this one down here.

227
00:16:11.653 --> 00:16:16.439
Yeah, so the pretend this is all but
yeah it's overriding all

228
00:16:16.439 --> 00:16:20.960
in just transitioning the background and
the transform.
