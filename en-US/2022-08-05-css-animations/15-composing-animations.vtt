00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.169
Could you add a shake
animation to the button in

2
00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:07.271
addition with a slide up animation?

3
00:00:07.271 --> 00:00:09.685
&gt;&gt; At the same time, you cannot.

4
00:00:09.685 --> 00:00:14.165
And so the reason that you can't do
it at the same time is just like we

5
00:00:14.165 --> 00:00:18.810
talked about before, those are trying
to modify the same property.

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.159
So, let's actually try that,

7
00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:25.250
because I do want to provide
a solution for that as well.

8
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.350
Let's say that on the button.

9
00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:35.762
Yeah, so I'm just gonna copy
over this button thing.

10
00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:38.344
Actually, you know what,
I'll make it easy, I'll do it over here.

11
00:00:38.344 --> 00:00:42.026
All right, so
let's say that we want to slide up but

12
00:00:42.026 --> 00:00:44.175
we also want to shake as well.

13
00:00:45.595 --> 00:00:50.811
So the problem over here is it's going to
take the second one, and it's only going

14
00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:55.801
to shake because both of them are trying
to fight for that transform property or

15
00:00:55.801 --> 00:01:01.120
yeah, the transform property and those
are gonna be in conflicts with each other.

16
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.510
So how do you solve this?

17
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:12.340
Well, right now in CSS, you actually
have to wrap this in a wrapping class.

18
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.760
So, sorry, in a container elements.

19
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.385
So let me just put a div over here and

20
00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:24.520
we're gonna call this, div button-wrapper.

21
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.625
Again, call it whatever you want, but
now if I have button-wrapper, and so

22
00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:32.430
this is no longer the child.

23
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.645
So I'll just do that.

24
00:01:36.822 --> 00:01:42.525
Then what we could do is we could apply
the shake animation to the button-wrapper,

25
00:01:42.525 --> 00:01:45.549
and the slide-up animation to the button.

26
00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:53.559
So if I do that, Now.

27
00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:56.178
Interesting, so both should happen.

28
00:01:56.178 --> 00:02:01.945
We do have the slide-up,
I probably took the delay off or

29
00:02:01.945 --> 00:02:07.314
something like that, so
let's just remove that.

30
00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:08.580
Yeah, that is what I did.

31
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.210
So here we go.

32
00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:16.590
So, hopefully you saw that, and
this is why the Animation panel is really,

33
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.615
really useful.

34
00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:22.305
But the shaking is
happening at the same time.

35
00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:25.760
If I just reload this.

36
00:02:28.553 --> 00:02:32.853
The shaking is happening at
the same time as the sliding up or

37
00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:34.489
at least it should be.

38
00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.603
Yeah, so you see it's shaking a little
[LAUGH] as we're sliding up to.

39
00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:45.084
So yeah, the answer to that is if
you do wants nested animations,

40
00:02:45.084 --> 00:02:50.297
use a container elements unless you're
animating different properties,

41
00:02:50.297 --> 00:02:53.970
and in that case,
you could just use the same elements
