00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.309
So yeah, there's a lot here to
learn from just this alone.

2
00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:09.536
But another reason too is,
exactly for this reason.

3
00:00:09.536 --> 00:00:13.683
I don't know if you could see
anything wrong here but personally,

4
00:00:13.683 --> 00:00:17.472
if you look at the animation text,
it's a little bit weird.

5
00:00:17.472 --> 00:00:23.379
And again, we could go into our
animations, And we could investigate,

6
00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:27.744
what's so
weird about this if I could click it.

7
00:00:28.848 --> 00:00:32.252
Okay, let me click it there we go.

8
00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.207
So notice over here it's not doing it, but

9
00:00:39.207 --> 00:00:44.142
if I click this, okay so,
the problem is even worse there.

10
00:00:44.142 --> 00:00:49.595
You could see that the animation is
actually being really, really shrunken.

11
00:00:49.595 --> 00:00:52.761
You see that text, it's being shrunken.

12
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:57.046
So, this is not something that we want and
so on the way down,

13
00:00:57.046 --> 00:00:59.160
it's also being stretched.

14
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.493
And so the reason for this is because
we're doing a layout animation,

15
00:01:03.493 --> 00:01:04.969
on the parents itself.

16
00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:10.197
And so, because we're doing it on
the parent, this stretching and

17
00:01:10.197 --> 00:01:14.888
transforming, is going to affect
all the children as well.

18
00:01:14.888 --> 00:01:20.732
Thankfully there's actually
a pretty simple fix to this.

19
00:01:20.732 --> 00:01:25.927
And so the fix is that,
instead of applying these flip

20
00:01:25.927 --> 00:01:32.751
animations to the parent,
we could apply it, to pseudo-elements.

21
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:38.230
So if I do this to the before, Then,

22
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:46.258
hopefully, I get pretty much the same
effects without the text changing.

23
00:01:46.258 --> 00:01:52.637
And so all that's left to do is actually
use the same flip technique, for the text.

24
00:01:55.199 --> 00:02:01.541
All right so are there any questions on
the flip technique and layout animations?

25
00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:02.209
Yeah.

26
00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.083
&gt;&gt; Can you go a little bit more
into the request animation frame.

27
00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:10.113
I see that you have request
animation frame function and

28
00:02:10.113 --> 00:02:15.270
then there's another request
animation frame inside that function.

29
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.437
Is that kind of operating like hey,
this isn't the same scene and

30
00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:20.406
this will happen then that will happen?

31
00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:27.050
What happens if that request animation
frame is outside of that initial, call?

32
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.431
&gt;&gt; Well all right so let me show you
exactly what's happening over here,

33
00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:34.412
let's say that this is your timeline,
right?

34
00:02:34.412 --> 00:02:39.719
And that, here's one request
animation frame, or sorry,

35
00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:46.493
here's one animation frame here's
another one and, here's another one.

36
00:02:46.493 --> 00:02:52.451
So all the changes that we're making, are
actually happening, just ahead of time.

37
00:02:52.451 --> 00:02:59.254
So, where we're doing the setting up
the styles and everything over here.

38
00:02:59.254 --> 00:03:03.768
And this is where we're doing
the inversion of the x and

39
00:03:03.768 --> 00:03:08.102
the y position and the width and
the height, right?

40
00:03:08.102 --> 00:03:11.691
So the browser,
when it's doing transitions,

41
00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:15.112
it's reading between the animation frames.

42
00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:17.822
So, I'm not sure if this is why
you're asking but basically,

43
00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:19.469
it needs to have something over here.

44
00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:23.293
Let's say that this changed so
that it knows hey,

45
00:03:23.293 --> 00:03:27.948
there's a difference between,
what's calculated here.

46
00:03:27.948 --> 00:03:32.404
And what's calculated in this animation
frame, so I could transition.

47
00:03:32.404 --> 00:03:36.152
Now if we do those in the same
animation frame, you get this.

48
00:03:36.152 --> 00:03:39.800
Which means the browser is
only going to read this, and

49
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.702
it's not really going to know
that anything is changing.

50
00:03:43.702 --> 00:03:48.364
So that's why you basically have to
have them in separate animation frames.

51
00:03:48.364 --> 00:03:52.779
&gt;&gt; There's a person that asked,
I don't see why the rect bounding

52
00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:56.637
box changes between,
the first rect and the last rect.

53
00:03:56.637 --> 00:04:03.599
&gt;&gt; Okay so, here's why at least in here,
here's why it's changing.

54
00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.731
We have different styles, here let me
show you, for collapsed and expanded.

55
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:12.885
And so we could show that here,
when we do expanded,

56
00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:16.339
you could see that the styles
are completely different.

57
00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:20.125
And so the rects,
the bounding clients rects which measures,

58
00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:27.232
the dimensions of this rect,
that's what's changing, so, Yeah.
