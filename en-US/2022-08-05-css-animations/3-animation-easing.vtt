WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.294
Just so
that we could do a little bit of coding,

2
00:00:03.294 --> 00:00:08.793
we're going to animate this ball and
see what some difference is instilled.

3
00:00:08.793 --> 00:00:16.727
So I'm going to go into the root
of my directory, the style.scss.

4
00:00:16.727 --> 00:00:20.065
You can ignore this style.css,
we don't need it, but

5
00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:22.703
we're going to be working on style.scss.

6
00:00:22.703 --> 00:00:27.289
And so let's say that we want
to actually animate this ball.

7
00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.483
And what we're gonna be talking
about animations in a minute,

8
00:00:32.483 --> 00:00:36.899
but I'm just going to have
animation slide-right.

9
00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.739
Don't worry if you don't
know what this is.

10
00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.014
We're gonna have a go for one second, and

11
00:00:43.014 --> 00:00:47.314
we're gonna actually do a linear easing
just to show you what that looks like.

12
00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:52.603
And we're gonna have it go
on infinite number of times.

13
00:00:52.603 --> 00:00:58.167
Cool, so
we also need to find the keyframes for

14
00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:02.592
this slide-right from transform:

15
00:01:02.592 --> 00:01:08.449
translatex(0) to transform: translatex.

16
00:01:08.449 --> 00:01:12.857
Let's have it go halfway to the screen and
back, so 50 viewport width.

17
00:01:12.857 --> 00:01:18.114
Okay, so now you can see that this
ball is moving from left to right,

18
00:01:18.114 --> 00:01:21.998
but this animation feels really,
really rigid.

19
00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:28.766
And that's of course because
it is a linear animation.

20
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:33.162
So let's inspect this
element if we could catch it.

21
00:01:33.162 --> 00:01:34.093
So it's a bad idea.

22
00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:37.132
[LAUGH] Let's pause this for a minute.

23
00:01:37.132 --> 00:01:40.580
We're going to, by the way,
this V app hot reloads.

24
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.808
So when we add this animation back, we
should still have it selected over here.

25
00:01:45.808 --> 00:01:50.396
Now, I'm gonna bump the font size up
here too, so you can see everything.

26
00:01:50.396 --> 00:01:54.383
And so when you inspect this
elements in the DevTools panel,

27
00:01:54.383 --> 00:01:57.980
whether you're using Firefox,
Safari, or Chrome,

28
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.847
you're going to notice that in the styles,
or at least this is in Chrome.

29
00:02:02.847 --> 00:02:08.243
But we have this little open cubic
Bezier editor symbol over here.

30
00:02:08.243 --> 00:02:10.966
This is really useful, especially for

31
00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:16.504
when you're trying to learn about what
do the difference easings actually do?

32
00:02:16.504 --> 00:02:18.453
So right now, this is linear.

33
00:02:18.453 --> 00:02:23.103
And so you could see that it's
just maintaining the same speed

34
00:02:23.103 --> 00:02:26.688
from the beginning to
the end of the animation.

35
00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:29.397
So if we click something like ease and
out,

36
00:02:29.397 --> 00:02:32.710
which is a key word that you could use for
the easing,

37
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.699
you could see that it accelerates a
little, and then it decelerates a little.

38
00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.825
So we could play around with this.

39
00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:45.023
We could move it here, so
we could show it accelerating a lot and

40
00:02:45.023 --> 00:02:47.014
then decelerating a little.

41
00:02:47.014 --> 00:02:48.672
Or we could do it the other way around.

42
00:02:48.672 --> 00:02:53.184
So we can move this to the left and
we could see that it accelerates a little.

43
00:02:53.184 --> 00:02:58.189
And then it's spending most of
its animation decelerating a lot.

44
00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.797
So there's a plenty of
other ones over here, and

45
00:03:01.797 --> 00:03:05.589
I recommend that you just
try each one of these out.

46
00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:10.765
But again, it can seem random that
we have all these numbers and

47
00:03:10.765 --> 00:03:13.409
no clear idea of what they mean.

48
00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:20.009
But by dragging around these control
points and seeing the animation live,

49
00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:26.520
then you should be able to get a pretty
good idea of what the easing is doing.

50
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.333
Now, my recommendation is,
if we go back to the slides,

51
00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:35.493
is to always keep this number.

52
00:03:35.493 --> 00:03:42.111
So the y value, the first y value is 0,
and the second y value, 1.

53
00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:45.132
The reason that I recommend
this is because it

54
00:03:45.132 --> 00:03:49.515
becomes a lot less confusing to
figure out the other two numbers.

55
00:03:49.515 --> 00:03:51.332
Because when you do that,

56
00:03:51.332 --> 00:03:56.702
the other two numbers just become just
like something that you could adjust,

57
00:03:56.702 --> 00:04:00.767
and you could pretty much
describe most curves like this.

58
00:04:00.767 --> 00:04:06.566
So if I do this, I can have it pretty
much accelerate all the way through,

59
00:04:06.566 --> 00:04:09.336
or really accelerate if I want to.

60
00:04:09.336 --> 00:04:14.947
And so you don't have to really think
about moving this up here or down there.

61
00:04:14.947 --> 00:04:17.327
The reason that I like having 0 and

62
00:04:17.327 --> 00:04:21.522
1 as y values too is because it
really models the real world.

63
00:04:21.522 --> 00:04:26.129
When something starts moving,
it's going to start at a speed of zero.

64
00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:29.521
And when something stops moving,
you want it to, of course,

65
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:30.965
stop at the speed of zero.

66
00:04:30.965 --> 00:04:34.661
So if your y values are different,
then you're basically saying, hey,

67
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:38.238
this isn't exactly starting and
stopping at zero, it's starting and

68
00:04:38.238 --> 00:04:39.625
stopping from some speed.

69
00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:42.723
And personally,
that feels a little bit unnatural.

70
00:04:42.723 --> 00:04:49.314
So just to make things easy,
have those y values be 0 and 1.

71
00:04:49.314 --> 00:04:53.343
Of course, you could do whatever
you want there but, yeah.

72
00:04:53.343 --> 00:04:53.904
Question?

73
00:04:53.904 --> 00:04:58.275
&gt;&gt; Yeah, do you tend to mix different
easing types in a feature or

74
00:04:58.275 --> 00:05:02.153
use CSS variables or
SAS variables to kinda keep that.

75
00:05:02.153 --> 00:05:04.315
Or is there a benefit
to kinda keeping that,

76
00:05:04.315 --> 00:05:07.997
if there's an arrow animation on
the button and an arrow animation there,

77
00:05:07.997 --> 00:05:10.525
keep them both at the same easing for
consistency?

78
00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:13.677
Or do you tend to just kinda
each animation is kinda specific

79
00:05:13.677 --> 00:05:15.390
to what the animation is doing?

80
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
that's a really good question, and

81
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.695
we are gonna be getting into
CSS variables in just a minute.

82
00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:26.564
But as far as using different easings,
it is important that, if you can,

83
00:05:26.564 --> 00:05:32.070
define different easings for
three types of movements animations.

84
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.937
So there's entry,
which is when an element comes into view.

85
00:05:35.937 --> 00:05:41.079
There's movements, where an element
is moving from one place to another.

86
00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:45.749
And then there's exits, which, of course,
is an element moving out of view.

87
00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:50.644
Now, some animation principles
that Google's motion design,

88
00:05:50.644 --> 00:05:56.073
I believe they're called, have talked
about is that when you're doing

89
00:05:56.073 --> 00:06:02.143
an entry animation, or basically any
animation, you want it to not be too slow.

90
00:06:02.143 --> 00:06:07.845
You want it to feel like something that's
snappy, but of course not too snappy.

91
00:06:07.845 --> 00:06:11.636
And so the general guidelines they
have around this is between 200 and

92
00:06:11.636 --> 00:06:13.761
500 milliseconds for an animation.

93
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:15.907
Now, of course, this is up to you.

94
00:06:15.907 --> 00:06:19.944
You might have animations that are less
time to that or longer than that.

95
00:06:19.944 --> 00:06:22.753
And you could also make
animations feel longer or

96
00:06:22.753 --> 00:06:25.433
shorter, depending on
how you do the easing.

97
00:06:25.433 --> 00:06:29.672
But with that said, let's say that
you're showing a modal, right?

98
00:06:29.672 --> 00:06:32.735
When a user clicks something and
they want to see the modal,

99
00:06:32.735 --> 00:06:35.254
of course it's something big and
on the screen.

100
00:06:35.254 --> 00:06:36.857
You don't want it to be too jarring.

101
00:06:36.857 --> 00:06:41.395
So you might want to have a little
bit of a longer duration, and

102
00:06:41.395 --> 00:06:47.616
you might also want to adjust the easing,
so that it might decelerate a little more.

103
00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:54.421
So you can see that just coming into
view and then slowly fully appearing.

104
00:06:54.421 --> 00:06:59.312
Now, when it comes to an exit animation,
like you want the modal to disappear,

105
00:06:59.312 --> 00:07:04.276
one of the worst things I've seen on many
websites actually is the modal takes its

106
00:07:04.276 --> 00:07:05.959
sweet time disappearing.

107
00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:09.032
It's like okay, goodbye,
I guess I'll talk to you later.

108
00:07:09.032 --> 00:07:13.762
It's like no, I'm clicking the x,
because I really, really want you gone.

109
00:07:13.762 --> 00:07:20.914
And so in that case, you could either
make it disappear instantaneously,

110
00:07:20.914 --> 00:07:25.122
or you could just make
it disappear faster.

111
00:07:25.122 --> 00:07:29.203
So you could play around with
the easing there and say, okay,

112
00:07:29.203 --> 00:07:32.196
I want this to really
accelerate out of here.

113
00:07:32.196 --> 00:07:36.012
So you could do something like that.

114
00:07:36.012 --> 00:07:39.746
And so basically just making it go away,
because at this point,

115
00:07:39.746 --> 00:07:42.315
we really don't care about where it stops.

116
00:07:42.315 --> 00:07:47.173
This modal is supposed to disappear
completely, so you could just play around

117
00:07:47.173 --> 00:07:51.826
with the easing and make it so it's like,
okay, I'm rushing out of here.

118
00:07:51.826 --> 00:07:56.105
And I'm not going to be annoying or
disturbing the user.

119
00:07:56.105 --> 00:08:00.677
So yeah, in general,
I would recommend different easings for

120
00:08:00.677 --> 00:08:05.266
those three types, entry,
exit, and movement animations.

121
00:08:05.266 --> 00:08:09.070
And of course, you could play around
with them and see how you like each one.
