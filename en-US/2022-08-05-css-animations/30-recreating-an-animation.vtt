1
00:00:00.438 --> 00:00:02.422
All right, so just for fun.

2
00:00:02.422 --> 00:00:09.363
This is an example of a dribble
animation that we would take a look at,

3
00:00:09.363 --> 00:00:16.924
and try to recreate this animation using,
well, in this case, just CSS.

4
00:00:16.924 --> 00:00:20.336
But I'll also like to do is open
the video in a new tab [COUGH].

5
00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:28.058
And so this makes it a lot easier to just
grab through and see what I could build.

6
00:00:28.058 --> 00:00:33.562
So there is a few elements in here,
some of which we have talked about.

7
00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:39.003
There's that's over there
where we are showing the text.

8
00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:42.683
And then we are, hold on,
let me just try go back to it,

9
00:00:42.683 --> 00:00:45.810
wherever it is, yeah, so it's over here.

10
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.840
So we see the text pretty big,
and then it sort of zooms out.

11
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.203
So it's a pretty cool effect,
and so let's actually start

12
00:00:55.203 --> 00:01:00.245
there because we're doing
both our animation stuff and

13
00:01:00.245 --> 00:01:04.659
we're also doing a little
bit of choreography.

14
00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.898
So let's see, first things first,
I'm gonna get this color.

15
00:01:10.898 --> 00:01:15.161
And so we're going to go over here and
actually add a style tag.

16
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:19.763
So, link:css.

17
00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:23.205
And so this is completely
from scratch by the way.

18
00:01:23.205 --> 00:01:25.963
So you're seeing me do all this live.

19
00:01:27.542 --> 00:01:32.335
All right, so we're going to

20
00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:36.563
just import our base CSS.

21
00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:37.827
See how we did there?

22
00:01:37.827 --> 00:01:38.688
Okay, there we go.

23
00:01:41.407 --> 00:01:45.648
Okay, so now to get started
let's actually add some HTML.

24
00:01:45.648 --> 00:01:48.321
This is the first step when we're
working with any animation.

25
00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:51.653
So inside of our body we
gonna have two things.

26
00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:55.771
We gonna have this build your wealth
thing, and also secure your legacy.

27
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:59.699
So that looks like two h1 tags, so

28
00:01:59.699 --> 00:02:05.524
I'm just gonna call this
Build your animations and

29
00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:09.464
Secure your development skills.

30
00:02:09.464 --> 00:02:13.044
[LAUGH] Just changing
the words a little bit there.

31
00:02:13.044 --> 00:02:20.277
And let's also add the font family,
some sort of serif.

32
00:02:20.277 --> 00:02:24.099
Yeah, you know what, I'm just gonna do
serif let's hope for the best over here.

33
00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.521
So also the background we
wants to grab that color.

34
00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:33.770
And so that's gonna be background-color,
whatever that is, that dark green.

35
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.296
And so the color color is going to be?

36
00:02:36.296 --> 00:02:37.580
Let's find out.

37
00:02:40.183 --> 00:02:41.152
Almost white.

38
00:02:41.152 --> 00:02:43.872
So there's one little E over there, and

39
00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:49.003
I guess that's just to make it just
barely off white, which is cool I guess.

40
00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:52.639
And when we're looking
at the layout over here,

41
00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:57.972
we're not gonna do all of these
rectangles, maybe just three or four.

42
00:02:57.972 --> 00:03:03.929
But we see that it is aligned in the
center and it's also aligned in a column.

43
00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:07.830
And so
what that tells me is that we use Flexbox.

44
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.474
So display: flex, flex-direction column.

45
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.393
There we go.

46
00:03:15.393 --> 00:03:19.720
And align-items: center,
justify-content: center.

47
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.790
Okay, so let's see how that looks so far.

48
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.438
Let's see we're gonna go back here,
not there, and examples/dribble.

49
00:03:33.438 --> 00:03:35.881
Okay, good enough, good start, right?

50
00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:39.761
So now we want to just adjust
the font sizes over here.

51
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:43.595
So this is just going to be font-size.

52
00:03:43.595 --> 00:03:45.469
Let's do it based on the viewpoint width.

53
00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:51.073
So let's do maybe 5vw see how that looks,
looks pretty big.

54
00:03:51.073 --> 00:03:56.956
So maybe 8vw and margin 0, Way too big.

55
00:03:56.956 --> 00:04:01.644
So we'll just do 6vw, and call it a day.

56
00:04:01.644 --> 00:04:02.718
Okay, cool.

57
00:04:02.718 --> 00:04:07.916
So again, what's gonna happen is
at first it's going to zoom in and

58
00:04:07.916 --> 00:04:10.029
then it's gonna zoom out.

59
00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:14.263
So we're showing the first one, and
then we're both zooming out and

60
00:04:14.263 --> 00:04:15.805
showing the second one.

61
00:04:15.805 --> 00:04:20.649
So let me just grab the color
of this second one real quick.

62
00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:25.663
Okay, so we could do +h1 color, and again,

63
00:04:25.663 --> 00:04:30.685
this is sort of scrappy coding but
it's okay.

64
00:04:30.685 --> 00:04:36.547
And let me just bump
this back down to 5vw.

65
00:04:36.547 --> 00:04:39.686
Okay, so now let's do our animations.

66
00:04:39.686 --> 00:04:42.711
So when planning
an animation especially for

67
00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:46.698
a dribble app like, sorry,
a dribble design like this.

68
00:04:46.698 --> 00:04:50.002
It's useful to think in a series of steps.

69
00:04:50.002 --> 00:04:54.673
So the first step is the first
heading showing, and

70
00:04:54.673 --> 00:04:59.668
then the second step, so
one, two, the second step is

71
00:04:59.668 --> 00:05:04.789
zooming out or scaling down and
showing the second one.

72
00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:07.083
So let's go ahead and do that.

73
00:05:07.083 --> 00:05:11.993
Now since both of them are moving
together it sort of makes

74
00:05:11.993 --> 00:05:16.507
sense to wrap those both in the div,
just like this.

75
00:05:16.507 --> 00:05:21.350
And I think in terms of time we'll
just do the headings and show you, and

76
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.384
hopefully get that working.

77
00:05:23.384 --> 00:05:28.796
So I'm just gonna call
this class= "headings".

78
00:05:28.796 --> 00:05:32.621
There used to be a heading tag in HTML.

79
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:34.486
They got rid of it for some reason.

80
00:05:34.486 --> 00:05:38.015
I'm still really upset about that,
but yeah,

81
00:05:38.015 --> 00:05:41.909
you have div class= "headings"
[COUGH] to do that.

82
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.161
So okay, let's do our animation.

83
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:48.409
So first I'm gonna add keyframes for

84
00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:53.455
headings, yeah,
the whatever I call it headings.

85
00:05:53.455 --> 00:06:00.301
And so this is first going to be
translated down and zoomed in.

86
00:06:00.301 --> 00:06:02.307
I call it zoomed in, but it's scale.

87
00:06:02.307 --> 00:06:04.465
So when you think zoom, think scale.

88
00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:07.915
And so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go from,

89
00:06:07.915 --> 00:06:12.700
and we're gonna start at that scaled and
translated position.

90
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.252
So we're gonna say, transform: translatey.

91
00:06:16.252 --> 00:06:18.674
Let's just say a 100% for now.

92
00:06:18.674 --> 00:06:25.674
And we also want to scale 1.5.

93
00:06:25.674 --> 00:06:32.014
Then we have to add that animation, so
.headings, we have animation: headings.

94
00:06:32.014 --> 00:06:35.518
And it seems it happens over 4 seconds.

95
00:06:35.518 --> 00:06:38.235
So let's try that.

96
00:06:38.235 --> 00:06:41.148
First of all, let's see that looks, wow.

97
00:06:41.148 --> 00:06:47.660
Okay, so
that's something [LAUGH] it's working.

98
00:06:49.397 --> 00:06:51.764
Just make sure that they're centered.

99
00:06:51.764 --> 00:06:55.382
It all looks that Star Wars [LAUGH]
sort of thing, [LAUGH] yeah.

100
00:06:55.382 --> 00:07:00.172
So actually we're not going to
translate why they get you what,

101
00:07:00.172 --> 00:07:01.955
yeah, we'll keep it.

102
00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:07.523
So from to, and so
this is actually going to stay from,

103
00:07:07.523 --> 00:07:10.682
remember we have three parts.

104
00:07:10.682 --> 00:07:15.468
We have the beginning, that halfway
parts where we start scaling out,

105
00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:20.277
and then we have the end parts where
we're just in our normal position.

106
00:07:20.277 --> 00:07:27.034
So this is gonna be from 50%, and
then two we have a transform of none.

107
00:07:27.034 --> 00:07:31.070
So we also want to add in
the animation for the first heading.

108
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.734
So we're gonna do that right over here.

109
00:07:33.734 --> 00:07:38.811
Keyframes, I'm just gonna
call this first-heading.

110
00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:43.589
And so this one,
let's take a look at the video again.

111
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:50.128
So we are going to sort of do that
cool little wipe animation or

112
00:07:50.128 --> 00:07:55.528
swipe, and
then just let the container zoom out.

113
00:07:55.528 --> 00:07:58.741
So that's gonna happen in
the first half of the animation.

114
00:07:58.741 --> 00:08:05.262
So when you're doing this you want to keep
it in line with all the other animations.

115
00:08:05.262 --> 00:08:09.088
And this is something I didn't really
talk about earlier in the workshop but

116
00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:11.678
choreographing animations
is pretty difficult.

117
00:08:11.678 --> 00:08:16.054
It's pretty fun once you get
the hang of it but unfortunately CSS

118
00:08:16.054 --> 00:08:20.768
doesn't give you a lot of good
utilities to really reliably do that.

119
00:08:20.768 --> 00:08:25.575
So over here we're going to have from,
and this is going to be,

120
00:08:25.575 --> 00:08:30.761
let's see what opacity first just
to make sure that it's working.

121
00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:38.121
And then at 50% we want opacity: 1, and
we also want this for our ending state.

122
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:42.784
Okay, so here's what that looks like.

123
00:08:45.494 --> 00:08:47.806
It, well, we didn't add the animation.

124
00:08:47.806 --> 00:08:49.256
That's, oops.

125
00:08:49.256 --> 00:08:54.118
So h1:first-child, we are going to add

126
00:08:54.118 --> 00:09:00.205
the animation of first-heading,
4 seconds both.

127
00:09:00.205 --> 00:09:05.086
Okay, so
this is going to to be transparent and

128
00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:09.604
then it's going to come back in like that.

129
00:09:09.604 --> 00:09:12.403
So now we want one for the second heading.

130
00:09:12.403 --> 00:09:16.006
So keyframes second-heading.

131
00:09:16.006 --> 00:09:24.591
And so this one is actually going to have
opacity at 0 at the beginning, and at 50%.

132
00:09:24.591 --> 00:09:29.753
And it's not until the very end where
it actually becomes fully opaque.

133
00:09:29.753 --> 00:09:31.419
So that's second half of the animation.

134
00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:32.844
So we had this.

135
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.623
Again, I forgot to add it, here we go.

136
00:09:41.397 --> 00:09:44.271
Here we go, okay, come on.

137
00:09:47.047 --> 00:09:51.167
I forgot there is no second child,
there is, [LAUGH] child 2, okay.

138
00:09:51.167 --> 00:09:51.836
Here we go.

139
00:09:51.836 --> 00:09:57.018
So this does that, and then there we go.

140
00:09:57.018 --> 00:10:00.945
So the last part of
this is we want to have

141
00:10:00.945 --> 00:10:05.242
a different animation than that opacity.

142
00:10:05.242 --> 00:10:08.044
And so this is actually really cool.

143
00:10:08.044 --> 00:10:12.558
I really liked doing this but
you could add clip-path and

144
00:10:12.558 --> 00:10:14.826
you could give it a polygon.

145
00:10:14.826 --> 00:10:22.496
And so this, here let me just show you
this cuz it's really, really useful.

146
00:10:22.496 --> 00:10:26.482
There is a clip-path maker over here.

147
00:10:26.482 --> 00:10:33.582
And so basically for clip-path polygon you
are defining each of the points over here.

148
00:10:33.582 --> 00:10:37.173
So what I'm going to do is,

149
00:10:37.173 --> 00:10:42.495
actually let me look at the video again.

150
00:10:42.495 --> 00:10:44.936
Okay, so
we're going from the left to the right.

151
00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:49.228
And so the way that I'm gonna do
this clip-path is these four points

152
00:10:49.228 --> 00:10:52.315
are pretty much gonna be
all the way at the left and

153
00:10:52.315 --> 00:10:55.946
then those two points are going
to be moving to the right.

154
00:10:55.946 --> 00:11:00.836
So we're going to start
with these this first one,

155
00:11:00.836 --> 00:11:06.520
the second one, and
then the third one is at 0% 100%,

156
00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.285
and the fourth one is at 0% 100%.

157
00:11:10.285 --> 00:11:15.230
And so now we just make sure,
I mean this isn't doing the fade thing,

158
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:20.367
it's hard to do that in CSS,
it is possible but also pretty difficult.

159
00:11:20.367 --> 00:11:25.315
And now we're going to just make this
polygon expand from the left all

160
00:11:25.315 --> 00:11:26.861
the way to the right.

161
00:11:26.861 --> 00:11:32.357
So 100 0, 100 100, 0 100, all right?

162
00:11:32.357 --> 00:11:37.109
And then the last thing I want to do
is I want to just change how this

163
