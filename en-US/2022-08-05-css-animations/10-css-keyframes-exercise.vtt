00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230
Let's move on to our exercise now.

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.937
So we're going to be working
in keyframe animations, and

3
00:00:06.937 --> 00:00:09.063
that's at 0 to dash keyframes.

4
00:00:09.063 --> 00:00:13.287
What we want to do is add animations for
this entering in, so

5
00:00:13.287 --> 00:00:17.606
we want the form to sort of slide up or
whatever you want to do.

6
00:00:17.606 --> 00:00:21.362
But I think that that's a good
intro to just getting a feel for

7
00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:22.843
in meeting something.

8
00:00:22.843 --> 00:00:26.659
And we might also want
to add animation for

9
00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:31.029
each of the elements as
well when they enter in.

10
00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.903
So this would just be an animation
that you add directly to the elements.

11
00:00:34.903 --> 00:00:36.421
And when you load the page,

12
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:39.525
those animations are going
to be immediately applied.

13
00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:43.625
And so
the final thing I want you to do is to

14
00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:48.099
use transform to make a shaking animation.

15
00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:51.549
And we're going to be using
that in a later exercise.

16
00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:56.018
But shaking is just you're
transforming from a native translate X

17
00:00:56.018 --> 00:00:58.982
to a positive translate X, back and forth.

18
00:00:58.982 --> 00:01:03.357
So you could use some of the shorthand
techniques that we learned in order to

19
00:01:03.357 --> 00:01:04.890
create those key frames.

20
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.730
So have fun.
