00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.312
So let's add some choreography
to this animation over here or

2
00:00:04.312 --> 00:00:09.502
lack of animation, let's add some
animation and some choreography to that.

3
00:00:09.502 --> 00:00:14.094
So what we're gonna do is we're
going to jump into style.scss.

4
00:00:14.094 --> 00:00:16.877
And we already have
a few keyframes set up,

5
00:00:16.877 --> 00:00:20.601
of course we have the shake,
but we also have slide-up.

6
00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:25.289
So let's use that slide-up and
do a little bit of choreography.

7
00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.635
So, first of all, we have the form
sliding up, which is great,

8
00:00:30.635 --> 00:00:37.283
but now I want the input and the button to
sort of appear after the form slides up.

9
00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:42.803
So we can add that same animation
to the input in button,

10
00:00:42.803 --> 00:00:45.863
and let's see how that looks.

11
00:00:45.863 --> 00:00:48.983
So, now you see that they all
slide up at the same time, but

12
00:00:48.983 --> 00:00:52.563
we sort of wanted those to be a little
bit separate from each other.

13
00:00:52.563 --> 00:00:56.300
So, instead of this I'm gonna
separate this a little bit.

14
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.437
We're gonna say animation-name: slide-up,
we are going to give it the same duration.

15
00:01:03.437 --> 00:01:09.447
So in animation-duration,
var animation-duration,

16
00:01:09.447 --> 00:01:13.744
and we also wanna give it the same easing.

17
00:01:13.744 --> 00:01:18.849
Since this easing is already on the
parents, we could do this, we could say

18
00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:24.943
animation-timing-function inherit: and
it's just going to grab that same easing.

19
00:01:24.943 --> 00:01:29.659
Now we want these to appear after
this animation-duration which

20
00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.809
we've set in a CSS variable.

21
00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:36.952
So we could give this
input a delay of that

22
00:01:36.952 --> 00:01:41.946
duration, so animation-duration,

23
00:01:41.946 --> 00:01:46.198
and so let's see how that looks.

24
00:01:46.198 --> 00:01:49.430
Okay, remember we need to fill-mode both.

25
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.510
And I'd like to just use
fill-mode both as a default.

26
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.435
At least when something like this happens,
you know that we can adjust the fill-mode.

27
00:01:57.435 --> 00:02:03.630
So now, this is sliding up after
the entire form slide is up.

28
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.999
Okay, so now we have to do a little
bit of math here because the animation

29
00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:13.834
delay over here is going to be
that same animation-duration but

30
00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:17.880
we also want it to happen
a little bit after the input.

31
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.166
So, instead of doing a lot
of extra math here, again,

32
00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:25.255
you could hoist this up to the parents.

33
00:02:25.255 --> 00:02:30.071
So we could say that we had
the animation-duration over here, and so

34
00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:35.303
this is basically going to be the
animation-duration of both the input and

35
00:02:35.303 --> 00:02:36.230
the button.

36
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.420
So for now, I'm going to set,

37
00:02:41.754 --> 00:02:47.063
Input-duration, and this is just going to
be the same as the animation-duration.

38
00:02:50.562 --> 00:02:52.014
And so we could set that here.

39
00:02:54.557 --> 00:02:57.095
Input-duration.

40
00:02:57.095 --> 00:03:01.364
And so now instead of doing
animation duration times two or

41
00:03:01.364 --> 00:03:04.850
animation duration plus
animation duration,

42
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.443
we could do a little bit of math here and
just to calc the animation duration,

43
00:03:13.017 --> 00:03:16.612
Plus the input-duration.

44
00:03:18.457 --> 00:03:25.695
So now, This is going to appear
right after the input appears.

45
00:03:28.345 --> 00:03:33.536
Now, of could do a little bit
of staggering here as well,

46
00:03:33.536 --> 00:03:36.685
or we could adjust the durations.

47
00:03:36.685 --> 00:03:41.166
So, let's say I want this input-duration
to actually be half the length of

48
00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:43.835
the total sliding up animation-duration.

49
00:03:43.835 --> 00:03:50.774
So I could say calc,
animation-duration divided by 2.

50
00:03:50.774 --> 00:03:54.901
And now this will happen
a little bit faster, and

51
00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:58.434
the button will come in at the right time.

52
00:03:58.434 --> 00:04:02.368
So that's just one of the many examples
that you could do with choreography.

53
00:04:02.368 --> 00:04:05.167
And hopefully you all had
like a creative twist, or

54
00:04:05.167 --> 00:04:07.653
just something custom
that you wanted to do.

55
00:04:07.653 --> 00:04:13.140
But that's basically how you choreograph
animations, so any questions?

56
00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:19.377
Yeah.

57
00:04:19.377 --> 00:04:23.393
&gt;&gt; So on the form element after
our choreography has ended,

58
00:04:23.393 --> 00:04:26.915
you can do multiple keyframes
on the same object.

59
00:04:26.915 --> 00:04:30.219
Is can you do that in shorthand is that or

60
00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:34.339
can we do like longhand for
so on the UI dash form.

61
00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:40.276
Once everything is ended and we wanna do
a final like transformers scale up or

62
00:04:40.276 --> 00:04:44.170
is that better or
is that a shorthand with a comma or

63
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.741
just listing them out one after the other
&gt;&gt; Well let's do that as an example,

64
00:04:49.741 --> 00:04:53.957
so let's say that we wants to all right,
this will be silly.

65
00:04:53.957 --> 00:04:57.372
Let's say we want to shape the form
after everything is done animating.

66
00:04:57.372 --> 00:05:02.998
So what we could do is we could
separate these into animation name,

67
00:05:02.998 --> 00:05:08.532
comma, separate, we want slide-up and
then we want shake etc.

68
00:05:08.532 --> 00:05:13.319
Or what we could do is we could have
the longhand, also comma separated.

69
00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:18.533
So we could say we want to slide-up and
then we want to shake,

70
00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:25.407
but we want to shake, let's just use
the same animation duration so duration.

71
00:05:25.407 --> 00:05:29.604
But now we want to,
this is gonna get mathy,

72
00:05:29.604 --> 00:05:33.121
so I'm gonna calculate all of this,

73
00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:37.665
we're just going to call
this total duration.

74
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:46.194
And so this is going to be
the animation-duration.

75
00:05:46.194 --> 00:05:51.248
Plus the input-duration plus the button
duration which is the animation-duration

76
00:05:51.248 --> 00:05:55.469
and I'll just put that over here just
to make things a little bit clear.

77
00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:03.066
There button duration.

78
00:06:03.066 --> 00:06:07.969
And so now, we could and of course
you could rename these to whatever

79
00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.337
you want just to whatever makes sense for
you.

80
00:06:11.337 --> 00:06:17.761
And so for the animation,
I want to move this up to the top

81
00:06:17.761 --> 00:06:23.663
we could give it a delay
of that's total duration.

82
00:06:23.663 --> 00:06:27.302
And so we could have this for
same amount of time.

83
00:06:27.302 --> 00:06:29.203
All right let's see what happens.

84
00:06:29.203 --> 00:06:33.452
So it's gonna slide-up that's gonna
come in that gonna come in and

85
00:06:33.452 --> 00:06:35.024
then it's gonna shake.

86
00:06:35.024 --> 00:06:39.585
So the main points that I want
to drive home for all of this.

87
00:06:39.585 --> 00:06:43.703
Is that you really ought to use
CSS variables for doing this,

88
00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:48.470
because that's going to allow you
to manually adjust the duration and

89
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.668
delay of each individual part.

90
00:06:50.668 --> 00:06:52.897
And by using a little bit of math,

91
00:06:52.897 --> 00:06:56.410
you don't have to change
all the different values.

92
00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.583
And so also the animation panel,
someone did ask this in the chat, but

93
00:07:00.583 --> 00:07:05.253
you could press Cmd+Shift+P on the Mac,
or Ctrl+Shift+P on windows, and

94
00:07:05.253 --> 00:07:07.615
this will open up the command palette.

95
00:07:07.615 --> 00:07:12.692
You could type animations, or
what you could do is you could click

96
00:07:12.692 --> 00:07:18.430
the three dots over here, and
it should be in more tools, in animations.

97
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:25.593
So, if I reload this,
This is really cool because

98
00:07:25.593 --> 00:07:30.669
you could see each of the animations
happening in a choreographed way.

99
00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:34.822
So, let me see if I could
drag this column on, okay.

100
00:07:34.822 --> 00:07:37.773
So, we have the slide-up first, and

101
00:07:37.773 --> 00:07:42.490
then the input is sliding up,
then the button is sliding up.

102
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.759
And then we have our shake
animation right there.

103
00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:50.029
So they'll works pretty well.

104
00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:55.040
And we can inspect that, pretty cool.

105
00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.426
I would be pretty scared to put my
email in the signup form like this,

106
00:08:00.426 --> 00:08:04.030
but just for
explanation purposes it works.
