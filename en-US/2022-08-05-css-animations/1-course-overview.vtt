1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.770
I want to get into what this workshop
is actually going to be about.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.427
So of course we are going to be talking
about animation principles throughout

3
00:00:09.427 --> 00:00:14.225
the workshop, what you should animate,
what you shouldn't and just some nice

4
00:00:14.225 --> 00:00:19.402
subtle ideas for how to add animation into
your existing websites and applications.

5
00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:24.174
But I also really want to emphasize that
this is a creative workshop, so this

6
00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:29.172
workshop is going to be split into a few
sections starting with the fundamentals

7
00:00:29.172 --> 00:00:34.719
where we're gonna be talking about CSS and
also just different animation principles.

8
00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.498
Then we're gonna be going into
transitions, CSS transitions and

9
00:00:38.498 --> 00:00:41.870
then we're gonna be going into
the key frame animations and

10
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.262
then choreographing between
multiple things animating.

11
00:00:45.262 --> 00:00:49.799
And then we're gonna be talking about
states and state transitions and

12
00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:53.505
even state machines and
how those relate to animations and

13
00:00:53.505 --> 00:00:59.580
can help you think better about how you do
different animations on your applications.

14
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.397
We're also gonna be talking
about layout animations,

15
00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:08.090
which is a more advanced topic,
but it's very, very useful.

16
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.470
And then we're going to be talking
about reactive animations.

17
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.193
So this is actually going from
least amount of JavaScript and

18
00:01:15.193 --> 00:01:18.920
least efforts to most amount
of JavaScript and most effort.

19
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.330
With that, this is a creative workshop.

20
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.444
So every lesson that we do, there's going
to be a couple of opportunities for

21
00:01:25.444 --> 00:01:28.030
you to practice each of these techniques.

22
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.407
One of them is going to be in a simple
application where you are showing an email

23
00:01:33.407 --> 00:01:39.260
input and a subscribe button and you
have to just intimate that simple form.

24
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.048
And another one, we're actually going to
be building a sample in flight app for

25
00:01:44.048 --> 00:01:46.320
a fictional front end airlines.

26
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.490
And in that app, there's a lot of
opportunities for you to animate.

27
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.966
So the goal of each of these
sections in lessons is for

28
00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:59.210
you to actually apply these techniques
in whichever way that you want.

29
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.370
So there's no right or wrong answers.

30
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.710
It's just about, can I use this technique
to achieve whatever effect that I want?

31
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.778
And so my main goal in this workshop is
to provide you all the techniques for

32
00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:14.737
you to bring your user interfaces to life.

33
00:02:14.737 --> 00:02:18.554
So that you can know, okay,
if I want to add a transition here or

34
00:02:18.554 --> 00:02:22.316
add an animation there,
I know exactly how to do it using CSS.

35
00:02:22.316 --> 00:02:27.118
Or even if I want to add an interactive or
a reactive animation, I could do so

36
00:02:27.118 --> 00:02:30.260
in JavaScript before adding any libraries.

37
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.300
So that's the thing too.

38
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.650
We're not going to be using any
libraries in this workshop.

39
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.560
We're going to be using plain JavaScript.

40
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.603
In fact, we're gonna be putting it
in the script tag in our index, so

41
00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:42.010
our index.html page.

42
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.608
So we're going really,
really old school here, but the reason for

43
00:02:45.608 --> 00:02:49.271
that is because it should not matter
which framework you're using,

44
00:02:49.271 --> 00:02:53.480
which libraries you're using,
the same principles are going to apply.

45
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.510
And you could use the techniques that you
learned in this workshop in pretty much

46
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.689
any framework or even no framework at all.

47
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.666
For CSS, we are actually in this workshop
going to be using a pre-processor

48
00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:11.210
called SAS, and
we're going to be using the SCSS variance.

49
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.950
Now, if you don't know SAS,
then don't worry.

50
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.710
The SCSS variance is completely
compatible with the CSS.

51
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.853
So if you don't know some of
the helpful things that SCSS provides,

52
00:03:22.853 --> 00:03:27.190
just write normal CSS and
it's going to work exactly the same.

53
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.454
So, no worries about that.

54
00:03:30.454 --> 00:03:35.648
And if we have time at the end of
the workshop, we're actually going to

55
00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:40.752
be doing what I've done with the key
framers that we'd been doing for

56
00:03:40.752 --> 00:03:44.733
a few years,
which I'm going to be taking a dribble.

57
00:03:44.733 --> 00:03:48.499
And we could work on this together,
but we're going to be creating it and

58
00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:51.930
creating that animation
completely from scratch.

59
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.956
So much from scratch that I
had not even prepared it,

60
00:03:55.956 --> 00:04:00.100
I wrote zero HTML,
zero CSS, zero JavaScript.

61
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.220
And we're just going to
try to do it at the end.

62
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.060
So it's gonna be a nice fun exercise.

63
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.340
And we'll see if we could do it.

64
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.128
And so this is going to give you an idea
of what it's like to take an animation

65
00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:18.068
from scratch and actually implementing
it with all of the bumps in the road and

66
00:04:18.068 --> 00:04:19.588
all of the struggles and

67
00:04:19.588 --> 00:04:24.383
of course the reward of actually getting
the animation working at the end.

68
00:04:24.383 --> 00:04:27.394
So again, the workshop is at

69
00:04:27.394 --> 00:04:33.670
github.com/davidkpiano/frontend-masters--
css.

70
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.339
And once you get this installed,

71
00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:42.460
all you have to do is run npm run dev or
yarn dev.

72
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.606
And so, that's going to spin
up local host at port 3000 and

73
00:04:48.606 --> 00:04:51.220
that's where you could see this.

74
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.950
And so this is the index page.

75
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.110
In the index page,
actually there's not much of anything.

76
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.160
There's just basic HTML, and

77
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.570
there's also this little
ball here that I made.

78
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.059
There's some styling for this page, but
the reason I'm pointing this page out

79
00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:17.660
to you is because I actually want you
to use this page as your scratchpad.

80
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.543
So if you want to try anything
out with CSS animations or

81
00:05:20.543 --> 00:05:23.927
a little bit of JavaScript, or
even something with this ball and

82
00:05:23.927 --> 00:05:28.080
getting it to animate, this is the page
that we're going to be using for that.
