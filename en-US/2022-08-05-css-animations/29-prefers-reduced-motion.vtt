1
00:00:00.211 --> 00:00:05.418
So yeah, the other big point
is I know that this entire

2
00:00:05.418 --> 00:00:10.742
workshop is about just animations,
CSS animations,

3
00:00:10.742 --> 00:00:14.575
using JavaScript for CSS animations.

4
00:00:14.575 --> 00:00:19.478
But the fact of the matter is that
not everyone wants animations.

5
00:00:19.478 --> 00:00:24.374
So it is important to know
that there's this media

6
00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:29.282
query called prefers,
I have it somewhere here.

7
00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:33.355
Okay, media prefers-reduced-motion.

8
00:00:33.355 --> 00:00:35.734
And so
I have it in the base styles over here, so

9
00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:37.997
it's actually being inherited over here.

10
00:00:37.997 --> 00:00:41.321
And so the two options for this,
you might think true or false,

11
00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:43.602
it's actually not, it's really weird.

12
00:00:43.602 --> 00:00:49.152
So there's prefers-reduced-motion reduce,
which acts like a false.

13
00:00:49.152 --> 00:00:54.058
And that means that the person
using their computer or

14
00:00:54.058 --> 00:00:57.775
mobile device does not want animation.

15
00:00:57.775 --> 00:01:00.586
And so the reasons for this may vary, but

16
00:01:00.586 --> 00:01:05.059
it's usually because too much
animation might be nauseating.

17
00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.399
They might have a vestibular disorder, so

18
00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.825
it's important to include this media
query wherever you're using animation.

19
00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:18.900
The default value, which evaluates
to true, I guess, is no preference.

20
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.456
And so that means I don't care if
they're seeing animation or not.

21
00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:25.912
Unfortunately, there isn't a value for,
please animate all the things,

22
00:01:25.912 --> 00:01:29.054
although I don't see that
that would be too popular.

23
00:01:29.054 --> 00:01:35.364
So prefers-reduced-motion does not mean
just stop all animations on the sites.

24
00:01:35.364 --> 00:01:39.619
It might mean make
the animations less jarring,

25
00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.260
make the duration a little bit quicker,
make the movements less sudden, or

26
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.828
make the distance between where things
are moved just a shorter distance.

27
00:01:52.828 --> 00:01:56.189
So there's a lot of things that you
could do with prefers-reduced-motion.

28
00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.014
And so you could get creative with that,
but the main point is that

29
00:02:01.014 --> 00:02:05.865
prefers-reduced-motion, you
want to reduce the animation.

30
00:02:05.865 --> 00:02:08.663
Such that if your
animations are meaningful,

31
00:02:08.663 --> 00:02:11.675
you still want to portray
them in some sort of way,

32
00:02:11.675 --> 00:02:15.139
but not in a way where it goes
against the will of the user.

33
00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:20.096
Now, to test this, you could either
go into your system settings and

34
00:02:20.096 --> 00:02:23.434
change it over there,
but that's a bit much.

35
00:02:23.434 --> 00:02:27.877
So over here,
if you open the command palette again,

36
00:02:27.877 --> 00:02:33.501
which again is C+ Shift + P on Windows,
Cmd + Shift + P on Mac, and

37
00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:40.743
you type reduce, there's an option here,
Emulate CSS prefers-reduced-motion.

38
00:02:40.743 --> 00:02:46.376
And so when we do this,
now there's actually no animation.

39
00:02:46.376 --> 00:02:50.489
So, We could turn that off.

40
00:02:52.563 --> 00:02:58.005
And we could click Do not emulate
CSS prefers-reduced-motion.

41
00:02:58.005 --> 00:03:01.557
And so now,
we're gonna get our full animations.

42
00:03:01.557 --> 00:03:03.954
So that's a very important
thing to keep in mind.

43
00:03:06.246 --> 00:03:10.064
So any questions about that?

44
00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:14.456
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; On that topic of usability,

45
00:03:14.456 --> 00:03:20.836
how do animations affect accessibility?

46
00:03:20.836 --> 00:03:26.487
&gt;&gt; So that's a good question, because
accessibility is a very broad topic,

47
00:03:26.487 --> 00:03:29.549
and I'm definitely not an expert in it.

48
00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.266
As far as ARIA technology and
accessibility in the browser,

49
00:03:34.266 --> 00:03:37.603
it's not going to really be too relevant.

50
00:03:37.603 --> 00:03:42.180
Just because that's more to do
with things like screen readers,

51
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.348
keyboard accessibility instead of mouse,
vision impairments, and stuff like that.

52
00:03:48.348 --> 00:03:53.314
But in terms of just accessibility for
people who are able to

53
00:03:53.314 --> 00:03:58.380
use all of the devices and
have normal scene and everything,

54
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:05.456
it's accessibility on the level of helping
the user out and just letting them know.

55
00:04:05.456 --> 00:04:08.897
We talked about at the very
beginning what they could do.

56
00:04:08.897 --> 00:04:11.757
And so I feel like this is very important,

57
00:04:11.757 --> 00:04:17.497
because it's very commonplace on our
mobile phones, but not really on websites.

58
00:04:17.497 --> 00:04:22.738
And sometimes I'll go on a website and
I won't understand what's going on,

59
00:04:22.738 --> 00:04:28.482
because there is no indicator that,
hey, something's happening right now.

60
00:04:28.482 --> 00:04:32.751
Or you could click this, or you could do
that, or you could shift this over or

61
00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:34.029
something like that.

62
00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:38.692
One of the most common things that I've
run into is when I click a Submit button

63
00:04:38.692 --> 00:04:41.706
or a button that's supposed
to do something, and

64
00:04:41.706 --> 00:04:44.396
I get no indication of anything happening.

65
00:04:44.396 --> 00:04:50.018
There's no loading spinner, there's no
animation, there's no response that,

66
00:04:50.018 --> 00:04:55.650
hey, you clicked this button, so something
will happen, there's not even that.

67
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.919
So what do I do?

68
00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.491
I click that button again,
and again, and again.

69
00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:02.560
And so sometimes bad things
happen when you do that,

70
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.159
you might submit the form five or
six times.

71
00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:10.004
So yeah, it's important.

72
00:05:10.004 --> 00:05:13.114
But on the flip side,
animation can be overused,

73
00:05:13.114 --> 00:05:17.275
in which it does adversely affect
the accessibility of a website.

74
00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:20.788
Because you might have models
that are too flashy or

75
00:05:20.788 --> 00:05:25.035
just things that really get in
the way of the normal user flow,

76
00:05:25.035 --> 00:05:30.037
which make users want to just not use
your website or web app altogether.

77
00:05:30.037 --> 00:05:32.995
Okay, so one of the questions.

78
00:05:32.995 --> 00:05:34.928
In flip, so the flip technique,

79
00:05:34.928 --> 00:05:39.209
is it guaranteed that all the elements
would have moved to a new position in

80
00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:44.128
our next animation frame call where we get
the new bounding rectangle coordinates?

81
00:05:44.128 --> 00:05:47.247
What if the elements need multiple
animation frames to finally get

82
00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:48.813
painted to their new positions?

83
00:05:48.813 --> 00:05:50.925
Our flipped function would fail, right?

84
00:05:50.925 --> 00:05:55.579
And so, yeah, the answer is yes, but
if you are missing animation frames,

85
00:05:55.579 --> 00:05:58.296
then you definitely have bigger problems.

86
00:05:58.296 --> 00:06:02.392
So with that said, you need some
sort of way of indicating, hey,

87
00:06:02.392 --> 00:06:05.975
my layout has successfully
moved to its final position.

88
00:06:05.975 --> 00:06:09.121
Now, you could read the final rectangle,
and

89
00:06:09.121 --> 00:06:12.762
hopefully, that's the very
next animation frame.

90
00:06:12.762 --> 00:06:16.621
Otherwise, again,
you need some sort of indicator, but

91
00:06:16.621 --> 00:06:20.889
in that instance,
you're already missing animation frames.

92
00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:24.354
So flip is going to look really
weird cuz it's gonna go like this,

93
00:06:24.354 --> 00:06:26.314
and then it's gonna animate again.

94
00:06:26.314 --> 00:06:29.704
So, yeah, I would say use flips sparingly,

95
00:06:29.704 --> 00:06:34.079
and make sure that your layout
changes are performance and

96
00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:38.556
that they're happening within
a single animation frame.

97
00:06:38.556 --> 00:06:42.781
Someone else who asked,
once the ball catches my pointer,

98
00:06:42.781 --> 00:06:47.344
referring to the reactive animation
lesson, it is, I lost it,

99
00:06:47.344 --> 00:06:51.666
once the ball catches my pointer,
it just stays stuck to it.

100
00:06:51.666 --> 00:06:55.972
What should I do to slow it down so
that it follows after a delay?

101
00:06:55.972 --> 00:06:57.938
Transition delay seems jarred.

102
00:06:57.938 --> 00:07:04.589
Okay, so yeah, going back to that example,
I would say do not use transition delay.

103
00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:08.511
And so the reason for
this is because that transition delay is,

104
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:11.325
it's not really going
to do what you expect.

105
00:07:11.325 --> 00:07:15.325
And so that's why you can't
really use transition delay,

106
00:07:15.325 --> 00:07:18.210
in order to have the same
effect over here.

107
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.711
Yeah, so also easing gets
a little bit weird as well.

108
00:07:22.711 --> 00:07:28.577
So yeah, it's just something
you have to keep in mind.

109
00:07:28.577 --> 00:07:32.975
So this is one of those topics,
sorry, not topics, but

110
00:07:32.975 --> 00:07:37.464
one of these applications where
you don't use transitions,

111
00:07:37.464 --> 00:07:42.574
you don't use animation,
instead you use request animation frame.

112
00:07:42.574 --> 00:07:47.238
