1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.790
We have a form here that
we needed to animate.

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.150
So let's add some animations to this form
and make it look a little bit better.

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.533
So the first animation that I was thinking
that we could add is a nice slide up

4
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.840
animation, which is going
to do a couple of things.

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.723
It's gonna go from opacity 0 to 1 and
it's also going to translate

6
00:00:21.723 --> 00:00:28.710
it from via maybe negative a 100% or
so back to its resting position.

7
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.070
So we're going to do that at the bottom
over here and define the keyframes.

8
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.016
So if we remember our shorthands,
we could use from and so

9
00:00:38.016 --> 00:00:42.350
we could say, opacity is 0 transform none.

10
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.542
Again, if you want to you could say
translate y 0, but it's a lot easier

11
00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:52.922
to just say transform none if there
are no transformations being applied.

12
00:00:52.922 --> 00:00:59.427
And then we could go to in say
opacity 1 [COUGH] transform,

13
00:00:59.427 --> 00:01:06.079
translate by,
actually that'd be the other way around.

14
00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:11.412
So transform none and so
we're gonna put translate y over here so

15
00:01:11.412 --> 00:01:13.894
it's coming from 100%.

16
00:01:13.894 --> 00:01:20.649
So now we have to actually apply that
animation, so we're gonna do that here.

17
00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.830
We're gonna set the animation name to
slide up, I believe I called it, yep.

18
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.600
And then we need to add a duration,
so animation-duration.

19
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.974
Let's do this over one second or so, and

20
00:01:34.974 --> 00:01:38.713
then animation timing function.

21
00:01:38.713 --> 00:01:45.186
Let's just do ease in outs,
and let's see how that looks.

22
00:01:45.186 --> 00:01:49.879
So now I'm gonna reload and you can
see that it's smoothly animating up.

23
00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:54.158
Now the usefulness of it keyframes
here which you can play around with if

24
00:01:54.158 --> 00:01:59.440
you want, but it's if we want to actually
have things happen in different times.

25
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.660
For example, let's say that we
want it to be full opacity before

26
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.314
it reaches the top, so
we could say 50%, opacity 1.

27
00:02:09.314 --> 00:02:16.784
And so now it's going to be fully
opaque at that halfway point.

28
00:02:16.784 --> 00:02:22.611
Now remember as a shorthand we could
comma separate this and say at 50% and

29
00:02:22.611 --> 00:02:27.800
when we go to that opacity or sorry and
we go to the end of the animation

30
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.370
the opacity should be 1 and
it's going to happen the same.

31
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.602
By the way,
if you want to inspect these animations,

32
00:02:37.602 --> 00:02:41.963
like the timeline of these animations
in the Chrome Dev tools and

33
00:02:41.963 --> 00:02:46.833
I believe in the Firefox Dev tools
as well, there are animation tools.

34
00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:52.792
So I just press Command Shift P here in
order to open this command palette and

35
00:02:52.792 --> 00:02:59.460
if I type animations we have a drawer
here that is specifically for animations.

36
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.219
So if I were to reload this,
you're gonna see this line over

37
00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:09.085
here preview it and
it does actually show you the animation.

38
00:03:09.085 --> 00:03:14.400
And so now you have this nice timeline
where we could drag this around and

39
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.717
see the animation happening.

40
00:03:16.717 --> 00:03:20.633
So we have our 0% keyframe,
our 50% keyframe,

41
00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:26.310
where it's fully opaque, and
our 100% keyframe here as well.

42
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.570
Now, this is really useful,
like just scrubbing through the animation,

43
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.130
especially for debugging animations.

44
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.303
You could also change the speed
here if he really want to inspect

45
00:03:37.303 --> 00:03:41.812
the animation in detail,
10% a bit slow so we'll go the 25%.

46
00:03:41.812 --> 00:03:45.320
We could take that animation and
we could replay it.

47
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.518
And this is really, really useful when
you're trying to apply animations and

48
00:03:49.518 --> 00:03:51.590
tweak them a little bit.

49
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.743
So you could also change the duration and

50
00:03:54.743 --> 00:03:58.275
change each of the keyframes
on here like so.

51
00:04:00.104 --> 00:04:04.870
So yeah there's another animation that
we have to add too which is shake.

52
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.220
We're gonna be using this in
one of the future lessons.

53
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.820
And so shake,
we're going to move left and right.

54
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.827
So these starting and the ending position,

55
00:04:14.827 --> 00:04:18.840
so from to are not gonna
have any transform.

56
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.040
So we're gonna say, transform none.

57
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.950
And then, we could say like,
let's just say 25%,

58
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.218
or you know let's do 20%, 40%, 60%,

59
00:04:34.218 --> 00:04:38.988
80%, you could have some fun with this.

60
00:04:38.988 --> 00:04:42.973
This is going to be worth
goes to the right so

61
00:04:42.973 --> 00:04:47.193
transform, translate x let's say 10%.

62
00:04:47.193 --> 00:04:53.737
And then we could do the same thing for
the like in between those.

63
00:04:53.737 --> 00:04:58.768
So 10%, 30%, 50%,

64
00:04:58.768 --> 00:05:06.130
70 and 90% that's gonna go to the left.

65
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.743
So this is what our shake
keyframes looks like, and so

66
00:05:09.743 --> 00:05:13.680
let's just apply it,
just to see what it looks like.

67
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.195
So if I go, let me find it over here.

68
00:05:18.195 --> 00:05:22.183
And if I change this to shake,
see how it looks.

69
00:05:25.614 --> 00:05:31.140
Okay, so it's pretty slow, and
we could just change that to 0.3 seconds.

70
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.864
So the total duration of
the animation will be 0.3 seconds.

71
00:05:36.864 --> 00:05:41.030
And so we could tweak these values of
course, we could inspect these animations.

72
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.120
And you could see each of the shakes
happening over here, which is pretty cool.

73
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.929
And so this is useful for stuff like if
the form or parts of the form are invalid,

74
00:05:51.929 --> 00:05:55.552
so you know what if I change
that back to slide up.

75
00:05:55.552 --> 00:06:01.288
I just wanna show you something real quick
for our input there's something called

76
00:06:01.288 --> 00:06:07.485
an invalid attribute so invalid and then
we can could just apply that animation.

77
00:06:07.485 --> 00:06:11.435
And I'm actually gonna use
the shorthand here, so it's animation.

78
00:06:11.435 --> 00:06:15.164
We're gonna shake it for
three seconds, and

79
00:06:15.164 --> 00:06:18.609
just allow the default easing to happen.

80
00:06:18.609 --> 00:06:20.966
So now, if this is invalid,

81
00:06:20.966 --> 00:06:26.025
well [LAUGH] it shakes every
time which we don't really want.

82
00:06:26.025 --> 00:06:30.518
So if we do invalid and
if it's not focused then

83
00:06:30.518 --> 00:06:34.870
that's when we want the shake to happen.

84
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.697
So let's reload this is
really slow forgot to put it

85
00:06:39.697 --> 00:06:43.320
to 100% and this is not an email.

86
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.930
So now if I blur [LAUGH] So
it goes really fast.

87
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.460
So we should probably change
this to like one second.

88
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.960
So that's in email.

89
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.750
Yep, it's pretty angry at us.

90
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.590
So yeah, so those are some examples
of some animations you could add.

91
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.718
You could also apply animations
to the input in button and

92
00:07:07.718 --> 00:07:10.680
just do whatever you want in there.

93
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.993
You could also add animations
to input in button, so

94
00:07:13.993 --> 00:07:18.190
let's say I want to actually
have slide up happen here.

95
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:23.700
But I actually wants the delay for
them to happen after the form comes in.

96
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.813
So I could say,
animation delay, one second.

97
00:07:27.813 --> 00:07:33.200
And so now you see what happened,
what are we missing?

98
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.010
Let's see if anyone remembers?

99
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:38.730
&gt;&gt; Film mode.

100
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:44.984
&gt;&gt; Yes, okay, so
we also need animation film mode, both.

101
00:07:46.774 --> 00:07:50.832
So now, We have that,

102
00:07:50.832 --> 00:07:54.755
it's a little bit laggy just
because the animation panel is up.

103
00:07:54.755 --> 00:07:59.162
So if we reload it's smoother, and so

104
00:07:59.162 --> 00:08:03.857
yeah that's the animations exercise.

105
00:08:03.857 --> 00:08:10.762
So did anyone have questions about that
exercise or animations in general?

106
00:08:10.762 --> 00:08:15.236
&gt;&gt; How about animation?

107
00:08:15.236 --> 00:08:16.476
Please state as I was calm.

108
00:08:19.406 --> 00:08:23.220
Do you find yourself using that
a lot with interactions or

109
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.016
the kind of a property
you don't really use?

110
00:08:27.016 --> 00:08:29.861
&gt;&gt; Animation play state
is a pretty fun property,

111
00:08:29.861 --> 00:08:32.376
in fact I wanna just demo it real quick.

112
00:08:32.376 --> 00:08:35.390
So let's go into our style again.

113
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.080
Again, this is on the scratchpad.

114
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:44.640
So we are going to get rid of the currency
animations over here or actually we will.

115
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.104
Yeah, so let's just do that.

116
00:08:52.352 --> 00:08:56.947
All right, so at 50%,
let's make this transfer form scale 2, and

117
00:08:56.947 --> 00:09:01.488
let's make it infinite, so
it's going to keep going back and forth.

118
00:09:01.488 --> 00:09:04.686
So infinite.

119
00:09:06.891 --> 00:09:09.460
Okay, so here's what we're doing.

120
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.430
This is going to sort of pulsate.

121
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:17.052
So it's gonna go from scale 1 to scale 2,
so it's gonna be twice as big,

122
00:09:17.052 --> 00:09:19.230
go back and forth like that.

123
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:23.560
Now let's see that we don't want this
to happen when we're hovering over it.

124
00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:30.496
So in order to get rid of that animation,
let's do this,

125
00:09:30.496 --> 00:09:36.160
when we hover let's do animation none.

126
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:36.890
See what happens.

127
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:42.360
Okay, so it shrinks back down, but
you know that's not what we want.

128
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.430
We don't want the animation
styles to be removed completely.

129
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.970
We just want to pause it be like hey,
hold on.

130
00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:54.260
So this is where animation
play state comes in handy.

131
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.650
We could say animation play state paused.

132
00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:03.090
And so now, when we hover,
it's gonna stop at where you hover it.

133
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.932
So it's pretty cool.
