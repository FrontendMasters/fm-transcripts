00:00:00.202 --> 00:00:04.993
Okay great, so the very last thing
that I wanted to talk about was

2
00:00:04.993 --> 00:00:07.844
actually an example app that we have.

3
00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:11.080
So I wanted to show this to demonstrate,

4
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.993
what would it actually look like if we
used these animations in a real app?

5
00:00:16.993 --> 00:00:21.876
So this is sort of the fake/real
app that I made by sitting on way

6
00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:26.406
too many delta flights but
I didn't use delta in the name.

7
00:00:26.406 --> 00:00:30.822
We have a new airline called
Frontend Airlines which seems fun but

8
00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:35.891
also dangerous, I would not be in
a plane written by Frontend developers.

9
00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:40.194
But yeah, so the idea here is that
we have buttons that do things,

10
00:00:40.194 --> 00:00:42.011
it changes the data state.

11
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:48.290
So we have an opportunity to do these
state based animations over here already.

12
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.372
Just looking over here,
we could have this come in.

13
00:00:52.372 --> 00:00:59.160
When we do movies, we could have each
of these movies individually show up.

14
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.816
So that's also a possibility,
same thing with the music over here,

15
00:01:03.816 --> 00:01:05.996
just gonna move this over here.

16
00:01:05.996 --> 00:01:07.344
And then this.

17
00:01:07.344 --> 00:01:09.942
So this is an overlay that
happens when you click about.

18
00:01:09.942 --> 00:01:14.968
And there's a few of these on
the actual Inflight Delta app if you've

19
00:01:14.968 --> 00:01:20.613
played around with it, but this is
an example of a really jarring animation.

20
00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:23.842
So you have, or lack of animation really.

21
00:01:23.842 --> 00:01:29.211
You click this and the entire screen
changes so it's not obvious where

22
00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:34.139
this came from, and
it's just not a very good user experience.

23
00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:40.657
So if you want to play around with this,
this is in examples and it's in form.

24
00:01:40.657 --> 00:01:45.376
And so we have a few styles over here,
actually we have a lot of styles and

25
00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:48.850
we do have some animations and
transitions as well.

26
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.412
So let's start with
the transitions over here.

27
00:01:55.363 --> 00:02:01.587
If we could find them, wait, so
I'm in the wrong file, there we go.

28
00:02:01.587 --> 00:02:06.014
Okay, so we have some transitions.

29
00:02:06.014 --> 00:02:08.388
Let's see, this is one for the movies.

30
00:02:08.388 --> 00:02:12.473
So now the transition is
going to be on the opacity so

31
00:02:12.473 --> 00:02:18.087
that when we hover over it,
we're changing the opacity from 0 to 1.

32
00:02:18.087 --> 00:02:23.123
So, this is the very first lesson that we
talked about, where when we go the movies.

33
00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:29.737
Let's actually, okay, so,
we probably have to add

34
00:02:29.737 --> 00:02:33.872
our transition variables and
things like that.

35
00:02:33.872 --> 00:02:38.564
But yeah, let's go ahead and I'm actually
going to add all of these in just to show

36
00:02:38.564 --> 00:02:42.385
you what it looks like to actually
have some animation in this app.

37
00:02:42.385 --> 00:02:46.190
So I basically come to
add a bunch of things.

38
00:02:49.706 --> 00:02:54.093
And this brings me to another point
which I'm gonna talk about very soon,

39
00:02:54.093 --> 00:02:55.027
don't worry.

40
00:02:55.027 --> 00:02:56.844
So animation, okay, so

41
00:02:56.844 --> 00:03:01.439
right now we're just adding back
a lot of animation over here.

42
00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:07.124
And so we're going to see just the effect
of these animations and hopefully,

43
00:03:07.124 --> 00:03:12.997
give you some inspiration for how you
could use animations in your actual apps.

44
00:03:12.997 --> 00:03:16.942
So let's see if I forgot anything.

45
00:03:16.942 --> 00:03:20.684
No, I think we're good, okay.

46
00:03:20.684 --> 00:03:26.425
So [COUGH] here's our Frontend Airlines
app, now we have a nicer intro, so

47
00:03:26.425 --> 00:03:31.439
we could click get started,
that slides down, this slides up.

48
00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:37.667
And so you could see there's actually
an opportunity to do some choreography.

49
00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:42.347
Where instead of this sliding down and
the other ones sliding up,

50
00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:47.793
we could wait for this to finish sliding
down before the other one slides up so

51
00:03:47.793 --> 00:03:49.596
that's a possibility.

52
00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:51.110
Now when we go to movies,

53
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.512
we could see that each one of
these is sort of staggered.

54
00:03:54.512 --> 00:04:01.191
And so we're doing the same technique that
we talked about before where we are adding

55
00:04:01.191 --> 00:04:07.038
that that CSS variable to each one of
the movies for each of their indexes.

56
00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:10.769
And so because we're doing that,
we could stagger all of them,

57
00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.893
just without requiring
an extra animation library.

58
00:04:13.893 --> 00:04:17.813
So same thing with music,
we have it over here, and

59
00:04:17.813 --> 00:04:22.382
then the overlay that I showed you,
we have over there now.

60
00:04:22.382 --> 00:04:24.690
This animation is pretty fast so

61
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.710
you could definitely adjust
that to whatever you feel.
