00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.316
Yeah,
&gt;&gt; Clip path, that's pretty sweet.

2
00:00:03.316 --> 00:00:08.176
I've seen a lot of like,
a background color full div that kind of

3
00:00:08.176 --> 00:00:12.679
just moves out and
doesn't reveal as well for that effect.

4
00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.213
But I think that was pretty sure.

5
00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:19.078
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, that might be the more
performant way of doing it.

6
00:00:19.078 --> 00:00:24.050
But clip path gives you
a lot more freedom.

7
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.764
There's one thing that actually I don't

8
00:00:28.764 --> 00:00:33.343
know why I didn't show this before, but

9
00:00:33.343 --> 00:00:39.279
one of my pens uses clip path
in a very very crazy way.

10
00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:41.119
Here I'll show you what I mean.

11
00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.758
Yeah.

12
00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:45.045
So, actually I don't know if this uses.

13
00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:51.333
Yeah, so it's what if I turn
the shadows off, it is a lot smoother.

14
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.684
This one took a lot.

15
00:00:52.684 --> 00:00:57.070
[LAUGH] just because I
needed to also manipulate

16
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.901
the shadows on the different elements.

17
00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:05.020
So that was pretty fun.

18
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.780
Also this cat on the string.

19
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.242
So this is not SB or anything like that,

20
00:01:12.242 --> 00:01:18.044
each one of this is
actually a A just a div.

21
00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:21.434
And so basically,
you can think of a div inside of the div.

22
00:01:21.434 --> 00:01:25.067
And if you move that second div down and
then rotate it a little and

23
00:01:25.067 --> 00:01:27.630
then do the same thing
did rotate it a little.

24
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.086
&gt;&gt; You kind of did that with
the animation where it says animation or

25
00:01:33.086 --> 00:01:35.827
box the second last one you did.

26
00:01:35.827 --> 00:01:40.765
Where you would move the box and
an animation would come inside and then.

27
00:01:40.765 --> 00:01:45.677
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sort of but, so that one
actually works the opposite of this one

28
00:01:45.677 --> 00:01:49.853
because we don't want both of
them moving at the same time.

29
00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:52.748
Because we want to
individually control each one.

30
00:01:52.748 --> 00:01:57.170
&gt;&gt; Well yeah, there was a delay
between when animation came in.

31
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.696
Admitted it looked like the box
was pushing the writing.

32
00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:06.616
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I started off with,
SAS variables for doing things like that.

33
00:02:06.616 --> 00:02:11.781
Because what you could do is say like,
each one in it just add

34
00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:16.960
a certain value so that it looks
like it's sort of doing a delay.

35
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.054
CSS variables can do the same thing.

36
00:02:19.054 --> 00:02:23.731
So that's why the main points that I
wanted people to bring home from this

37
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:26.883
workshop are CSS variables,
data attributes.

38
00:02:26.883 --> 00:02:32.937
And just how you could use them to better
organize your styles into animations.

39
00:02:32.937 --> 00:02:36.406
&gt;&gt; So this is in HTML canvas, [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; No, this is a-

40
00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:39.548
&gt;&gt; Just doing like a Photoshop with layers

41
00:02:39.548 --> 00:02:42.884
basically yeah, that's great thanks.

42
00:02:42.884 --> 00:02:45.601
&gt;&gt; Okay, now I understand what
you're getting each layer and

43
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:48.275
kind of move it like he's
sitting behind and underneath.

44
00:02:48.275 --> 00:02:51.739
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is yep all all SVG Do, so,

45
00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.533
this one was fun to do too
win PokemonGo was the thing.

46
00:02:55.533 --> 00:03:00.605
I think it's a still thing,
people still do it,

47
00:03:00.605 --> 00:03:04.331
but like, yeah, so, [LAUGH] Yeah.

48
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:08.512
All right, so I hope that you all
enjoy the workshop and thanks for

49
00:03:08.512 --> 00:03:11.717
sticking around for
the impromptu dribble demo.

50
00:03:11.717 --> 00:03:13.554
[LAUGH] Thank you.

51
00:03:13.554 --> 00:03:15.846
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
