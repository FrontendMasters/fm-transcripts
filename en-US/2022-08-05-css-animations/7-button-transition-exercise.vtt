00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
Okay, so
now let's get into our coding example.

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.576
So what we're going to do is we're
going to go to transitions and

3
00:00:08.576 --> 00:00:12.189
you're going to see here
a very basic signup form.

4
00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:15.654
So, we have an input and
we have a subscribe.

5
00:00:15.654 --> 00:00:17.754
And we also have, yeah,

6
00:00:17.754 --> 00:00:23.164
we also have some styles changing
when you focus inside of here.

7
00:00:23.164 --> 00:00:27.252
So, I'll show you how
that looks in the CSS.

8
00:00:27.252 --> 00:00:31.417
So in the files, if you go to style.scss,

9
00:00:31.417 --> 00:00:36.393
we have a few colors over
here as CSS variables, and

10
00:00:36.393 --> 00:00:39.662
a few other things too to help us.

11
00:00:39.662 --> 00:00:47.048
There's this selector or pseudo selector
called focus-within, its really useful.

12
00:00:47.048 --> 00:00:51.946
It means if anything inside
this elements is focused,

13
00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:54.719
then apply these styles to it.

14
00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.481
And so
we have a CSS variable here called color,

15
00:00:57.481 --> 00:00:59.700
which is initially set to color gray.

16
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.644
So when we focus within,
it changes to color blue.

17
00:01:03.644 --> 00:01:07.736
And so we are setting the border
color of our input and

18
00:01:07.736 --> 00:01:12.211
the background color of our
button to that CSS variable.

19
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:15.788
However, the transition between
those is not very smooth.

20
00:01:15.788 --> 00:01:21.091
What I want you to do Is to smoothly
transition these elements so

21
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:25.892
that it goes from gray to blue
when you focus inside of it,

22
00:01:25.892 --> 00:01:29.813
instead of it just being
a direct transition.

23
00:01:29.813 --> 00:01:33.905
Now Furthermore, what you could
do is when the button is clicked,

24
00:01:33.905 --> 00:01:38.360
you could also transition the style there,
maybe give it some opacity,

25
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.353
maybe move it down a little bit.

26
00:01:40.353 --> 00:01:47.550
Remember, use transform and not the layout
properties, and play around with that.

27
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.500
If this is too simple to you then
we also have this inflight example

28
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.301
that I want to show you.

29
00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:57.619
Again, there's nothing
being animated over here,

30
00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.060
there's just a whole bunch of things.

31
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.541
And so
there are some good opportunities for

32
00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:07.249
you to practice these techniques that
you're learning in this little flight app.

33
00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:10.316
So you could maybe add
a transition to the button,

34
00:02:10.316 --> 00:02:14.123
maybe add a transition to the movies
when you hover over them.

35
00:02:14.123 --> 00:02:17.059
And some of them are applied for
you already,

36
00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:19.925
you just need to smoothly transition them.

37
00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:23.480
But yeah, just apply your
skills to either this app or

38
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.248
the smaller example over here, or both.
