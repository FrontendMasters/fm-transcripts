00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.360
So now we are going to get
into our next exercise.

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.660
We have an animation happening here for
this form.

3
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.855
What I wants to happen though, is and
of course you have creative freedom so

4
00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:20.884
you could do anything you want, but
it would be nice to have the inputs and

5
00:00:20.884 --> 00:00:24.570
then the subscribe up
here one after the other.

6
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.600
And if you want to do a stagger
then that would be fine as well.

7
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.809
But we want this whole feeling of when
this comes in, we have the input and

8
00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.450
then the subscribe.

9
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.451
So use CSS variables and

10
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:41.760
make these separate elements
choreographed with each other.

11
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.180
So have fun.
