00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.478
So let's talk about transitioning these
dials so that it's a little bit smoother.

2
00:00:06.478 --> 00:00:08.109
So like we talked about,

3
00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.548
these transitions are going to
happen when there is a state change.

4
00:00:12.548 --> 00:00:16.915
So we have this focus within
where we change the color, now,

5
00:00:16.915 --> 00:00:21.885
of course transitions are applied
to elements not to CSS variables,

6
00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:26.445
so we do need to do this within
the individual elements itself.

7
00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:29.259
So, for example, for UI input,

8
00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.091
we could set the transition
property to border-color.

9
00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:37.307
Again, you want to avoid
doing border because if

10
00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:41.935
you change the border width then
that's just going to cause layouts,

11
00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:46.735
it's going to trigger layouts, and
that's not gonna be performance.

12
00:00:46.735 --> 00:00:52.306
So we can also set the transition
duration to let's say 0.3 seconds.

13
00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:56.170
This is a nice defaults because
this is between that 200 and

14
00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.273
500 millisecond window where
just feels natural to the user.

15
00:01:00.273 --> 00:01:03.891
Any longer than that,
then it's gonna feel a little sluggish,

16
00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:07.309
any shorter than that it's
going to feel instantaneous, so

17
00:01:07.309 --> 00:01:10.269
you might as well not even
use an animation for that.

18
00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:14.157
And let's also,
we could add a transition timing function,

19
00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:16.565
but in this case it's not necessary.

20
00:01:16.565 --> 00:01:20.620
So even though the color is
changing within the parents,

21
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.000
because this color is
being applied over here,

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.323
this is going to pick up any
transitions with that property.

23
00:01:28.323 --> 00:01:33.993
So now you could see that the border,
now let me zoom in a bit there.

24
00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:39.107
The border is smoothly
transitioning from gray to blue,

25
00:01:39.107 --> 00:01:44.445
so to make it more visible let's
do it with a button as well.

26
00:01:44.445 --> 00:01:48.952
So I'm gonna copy this over to the button,
but instead of border color we're going to

27
00:01:48.952 --> 00:01:52.099
be animating the background color,
so background color.

28
00:01:54.797 --> 00:02:02.295
And now you can see that it
smoothly goes in and out.

29
00:02:02.295 --> 00:02:07.468
Now of course this is a creative workshop
you could play around with these styles.

30
00:02:07.468 --> 00:02:09.710
As a user focuses in the input,

31
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.812
you might want the subscribe transition
to happen a little bit later.

32
00:02:14.812 --> 00:02:18.702
So that they know that when they're
done filling out their email,

33
00:02:18.702 --> 00:02:23.576
they could see the subscribe button and
have their attention pulled towards that.

34
00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.631
So we can also add
a transition delay here.

35
00:02:25.631 --> 00:02:33.368
[COUGH] Let's just call it three seconds.

36
00:02:33.368 --> 00:02:36.489
And so now we're getting
a little bit creative over here.

37
00:02:39.816 --> 00:02:44.005
And there we go, but
I'll take that off for now.

38
00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:49.959
So within the button itself,
if you want to go even further, you could,

39
00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.417
for example, when the button is hovered,
we could have an opacity of 0.5.

40
00:02:56.417 --> 00:03:01.174
And so now, you see it's
immediately transitioning there and

41
00:03:01.174 --> 00:03:06.304
that's because we need to add
opacity to our transition property.

42
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.823
So now you can see it's pretty smooth.

43
00:03:11.823 --> 00:03:17.692
Change that to 0.7 and now let's
actually transform that [COUGH] and

44
00:03:17.692 --> 00:03:23.473
move it down a little, so
translateY and let's just give it 10%.

45
00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:28.573
By the way, if you're not familiar
with these translates and transforms

46
00:03:28.573 --> 00:03:34.346
in general, then the 10%, this is relative
to the size of the elements itself.

47
00:03:34.346 --> 00:03:38.792
It's not gonna translate 10% from
the parents or from the body, but

48
00:03:38.792 --> 00:03:42.644
rather it's going to take 10%
of what that, in this case,

49
00:03:42.644 --> 00:03:47.191
the height of that element is, and
it's going to move it down that much.

50
00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:54.071
So that's happening on hover, and
we had to also add that transform,

51
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:58.863
so it's smooth, but
let's add this to active.

52
00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:04.574
So we move transform to active.

53
00:04:04.574 --> 00:04:09.357
And now when we push down,
we can see that it's transitioning,

54
00:04:09.357 --> 00:04:11.136
just like we want it to.

55
00:04:14.048 --> 00:04:17.565
All right, so were there any
questions about this exercise?

56
00:04:20.062 --> 00:04:25.123
Did any of you do anything beyond
just transitioning these things or

57
00:04:25.123 --> 00:04:27.446
did you do anything creative?

58
00:04:27.446 --> 00:04:30.673
Someone in the chat said,
I have expanded the button,

59
00:04:30.673 --> 00:04:32.857
it didn't look as cool as I thought.

60
00:04:32.857 --> 00:04:37.197
I think that looks pretty cool like,
transform: scale, maybe 1.1,

61
00:04:37.197 --> 00:04:39.510
something really subtle, like just.

62
00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:48.194
That looks fun, I like that, so,
it's whatever you wanna do really.

63
00:04:48.194 --> 00:04:49.531
And of course, keep in mind,

64
00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:52.104
you could also change the easing
of each of these things.

65
00:04:52.104 --> 00:04:58.152
So we could say, transition timing,
function, maybe make that linear,

66
00:04:58.152 --> 00:05:04.114
linear, and ease-in-out, or
a custom cute buzzer if he wants to, so.

67
00:05:04.114 --> 00:05:06.982
&gt;&gt; Don't you normally with a link,
it changes to it,

68
00:05:06.982 --> 00:05:09.046
the cursor to do you like a hand?

69
00:05:09.046 --> 00:05:13.143
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's actually debate about
that, some people don't like that.

70
00:05:13.143 --> 00:05:18.007
Yeah, they say, the cursor pointer should
only be used for links, but there are so

71
00:05:18.007 --> 00:05:22.124
many websites and apps where they
use the pointer for buttons as well.

72
00:05:22.124 --> 00:05:28.371
I personally like cursor pointer,
so it feels more natural to me.

73
00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:32.103
&gt;&gt; Yeah, to me like that,
I always think that, it is nice like that.

74
00:05:32.103 --> 00:05:36.682
&gt;&gt; There are some purists though who say,
do not use it [LAUGH] but yeah.
