00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.330
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay, there are a few
ways of removing items from the list.

2
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.400
Be a little bit careful with the remove
method because just like insert it

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.650
only removes the first one.

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.530
So if I have a list of names,
Nina and Max.

5
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.160
And I call names.remove.

6
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.200
On max.
I'm just going to have a names list with

7
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.890
one item in it.

8
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.590
But if my names list has
a duplicate value in it,

9
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.610
and I call names.remove Nina.

10
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.251
Gonna see that it only removed that first
instance of Nina and not the last one.

11
00:00:54.505 --> 00:00:57.937
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: If we try to remove
something from the list that's not

12
00:00:57.937 --> 00:01:02.980
there,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: What am I gonna see?

13
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.740
I mean it's going to be an error,
but which one?

14
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.420
&gt;&gt; Student: Hex index not found or
something.

15
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.290
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: It's a value error.

16
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.000
Yeah.

17
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.230
Hex is not in list.

18
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.970
You can use the pop method
to remove the last item.

19
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.680
Or you can use my list of pop with

20
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.257
an index to remove an item
at a particular position.

21
00:01:32.257 --> 00:01:36.920
The nice thing about pop is that it
will also return the item that was just

22
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.360
removed in case you wanna do anything with
it, or save it or anything like that.

23
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.250
So if I call names.pop,

24
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.010
what will my names list look like?

25
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.430
Max, right?

26
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.630
And what will names.pop return?

27
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.270
&gt;&gt; Student2: Nina.
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Yeah, yep,

28
00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.846
exactly right
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Making

29
00:02:02.846 --> 00:02:06.623
a new slightly longer list of names.

30
00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:18.630
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I can call names.pop
and give this function an index.

31
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.867
So I'm gonna pop 1, it's gonna pop the
value Rose and remove it from the list.

32
00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:34.450
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So
now the length of names is 2, right?

33
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.798
What happens if I try to pop the item,
at index two?

34
00:02:40.798 --> 00:02:41.984
&gt;&gt; Student: Index error.

35
00:02:41.984 --> 00:02:43.170
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Index error.

36
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.620
Pop index out of range.
