00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.402
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: You should have had
this URL by now, get.io/python three,

2
00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:06.999
if you could all please open that up.

3
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.915
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: They should bring
you to this repository right here.

4
00:00:13.915 --> 00:00:20.003
The solutions for the exercises or
the exercise code is in this folder.

5
00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:23.799
But I'm gonna recommend that
you don't look in there,

6
00:00:23.799 --> 00:00:26.302
unless you really, really need to,

7
00:00:26.302 --> 00:00:31.745
because I think that the best way to learn
Python is to just type it along with me.

8
00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:35.996
And you'll get a lot more value out
of this class if you're typing with

9
00:00:35.996 --> 00:00:39.539
me versus copying and
pasting things from the exercises.

10
00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.577
So it's there if you need it,
but try not to peek.

11
00:00:42.577 --> 00:00:46.344
The most important link
here is this first one.

12
00:00:46.344 --> 00:00:47.713
It's the course website.

13
00:00:47.713 --> 00:00:50.334
I recommend going to the GitHub page for

14
00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:55.029
the latest URL because it might be
redeployed somewhere after class.

15
00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:59.881
So if you all could just click through
to that, you'll see the course web page.

16
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:04.265
The nice thing about this course website,
I've done Frontend Masters

17
00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:08.869
courses before and I made a lot of slides
like hundreds of pages of slides and

18
00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.687
they were awesome but
nobody got value from them afterwards.

19
00:01:12.687 --> 00:01:16.176
So the goal of this site
is to be a resource to you.

20
00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:19.959
There's probably a little bit more
information in here than you really need,

21
00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:23.074
but you can always go back and
look at it later, after the class.

22
00:01:23.074 --> 00:01:27.636
You can navigate with the left and
right arrows, which I'll show you,

23
00:01:27.636 --> 00:01:31.666
and I'll tell you a little bit
more about the website soon, but

24
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.818
first a little bit more about me.

25
00:01:35.627 --> 00:01:37.319
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: My
name is Nina Zakharenko,

26
00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:41.832
I've worked at some companies you
might have heard of, writing software.

27
00:01:41.832 --> 00:01:44.842
I've worked for Reddit, I've worked for
Medap, I've worked for HBO.

28
00:01:44.842 --> 00:01:49.517
These days I work as a Cloud Advocate
at Microsoft, focusing on Python.

29
00:01:49.517 --> 00:01:53.003
If you want to stay in touch
at the end of the class,

30
00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:55.163
I have a few links here for you.

31
00:01:55.163 --> 00:01:58.686
I'm pretty active on Twitter,
you can find me on LinkedIn, or

32
00:01:58.686 --> 00:02:01.482
you can follow me on GitHub
where you saw the code.

33
00:02:01.482 --> 00:02:06.917
I also have a few other Front End Masters
courses, Get In-Depth is my favorite one.

34
00:02:06.917 --> 00:02:11.102
And after the class if you'd like to
you can watch some of my Python related

35
00:02:11.102 --> 00:02:12.262
conference talks.

36
00:02:12.262 --> 00:02:14.883
There are links here at the bottom.

37
00:02:14.883 --> 00:02:17.133
Okay, navigating this course.

38
00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:21.093
You'll see,
he bumped the size up a little bit.

39
00:02:21.093 --> 00:02:25.514
You'll see here as I've been navigating
that these blue check marks have appeared.

40
00:02:25.514 --> 00:02:29.266
Those will tell you which pages you
visited and which you have not.

41
00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:34.368
If you'd like to clear that, there is a
button at the very bottom, Clear history.

42
00:02:34.368 --> 00:02:40.146
To copy code, all you have to
do is click on this little icon.

43
00:02:40.146 --> 00:02:44.720
This blue icon right here,
let's just copy to clipboard.

44
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.125
And it should copy that code for you.

45
00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:48.879
As we're going to go through
some code in the REPL,

46
00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.004
you'll see some control characters.

47
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:55.391
The nice thing about this copy and paste
is it'll copy the code without the control

48
00:02:55.391 --> 00:02:57.821
characters so
you can just paste it right in.

49
00:02:57.821 --> 00:03:01.137
If you feel like maybe you're
getting a little bit behind,

50
00:03:01.137 --> 00:03:03.937
that's a great way of
copying things piecemeal.

51
00:03:03.937 --> 00:03:08.397
The whole course is searchable via
the search bar on the top left here.

52
00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:13.490
So if I type pap8 you'll see all
the sections that mention that.

53
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.869
You can navigate via the left and

54
00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:20.908
right arrows where you can just head
left and right on the keyboard.

55
00:03:20.908 --> 00:03:29.121
There are also breadcrumbs between
each titles, so here on the top bar.

56
00:03:29.121 --> 00:03:32.935
You'll see if i mouse over
that table of contents,

57
00:03:32.935 --> 00:03:36.228
it will let me quick
through to any section.

58
00:03:36.228 --> 00:03:40.544
Lastly, sometimes will be
additional instructions where

59
00:03:40.544 --> 00:03:44.437
solutions exercises will
be in a collapsed section.

60
00:03:44.437 --> 00:03:48.026
So to expand it so just look for
an arrow that looks like this, and

61
00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:50.883
the course information is pretty heavy,
links and

62
00:03:50.883 --> 00:03:55.609
additions formations I really recommend
that you follow the links after the class.

63
00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.804
As a source of additional information so

64
00:03:57.804 --> 00:04:01.170
that you don't get distracted
from the important material.
