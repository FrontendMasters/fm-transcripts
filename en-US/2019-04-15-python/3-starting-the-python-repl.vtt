00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.484
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So once you have the
Python extension, a really nice thing that

2
00:00:03.484 --> 00:00:07.375
VS Code does is, it automatically
selects the correct interpreter.

3
00:00:07.375 --> 00:00:10.771
And you'll see that in the blue bar,
here at the bottom.

4
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:15.299
It'll say the correct version
of Python that we're using,

5
00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.377
which is Python 3.7.2, and
our virtual environment, venv.

6
00:00:20.377 --> 00:00:25.006
If you get a pop-up that says your linter,
pylint, is not installed, go ahead and

7
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:26.075
install that now.

8
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.220
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Now, the REPL, which
stands for the read-evaluate-print loop,

9
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.568
this is gonna be how we're interacting
with Python for most of the day.

10
00:00:39.568 --> 00:00:44.501
It allows us to interact with
the Python interpreter, so

11
00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:49.555
I'm just running a file in the,
containing Python code.

12
00:00:49.555 --> 00:00:54.658
The REPL allows you to type in commands,
and instantly see the output printed out.

13
00:00:54.658 --> 00:00:59.650
For those of you who use JavaScript,
you've probably seen a REPL already,

14
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.618
right, you're familiar with the concept.

15
00:01:02.618 --> 00:01:08.180
You can also use the REPL to print
out help and look at variables,

16
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.997
list out what methods are available, etc.

17
00:01:11.997 --> 00:01:17.780
So to open up the REPL,
all you need to do is type python in here,

18
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.958
and then select Start REPL, yes?

19
00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.286
&gt;&gt; Student: What is a REPL?

20
00:01:22.286 --> 00:01:26.035
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: It's
a read-evaluate-print loop,

21
00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:31.033
so it allows us to type
Python instructions into it,

22
00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:34.110
and instantly see the results.

23
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.607
It will make more sense in a second,
once we open it up.

24
00:01:38.607 --> 00:01:40.844
Okay, does everyone see the Start REPL?

25
00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:48.618
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Someone asked,
why do we use virtual environments?

26
00:01:48.618 --> 00:01:54.366
They'll make a little bit more sense when
we start working with external libraries.

27
00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:59.180
They're basically a self-contained
Python installation of the Python

28
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.972
version in the libraries.

29
00:02:00.972 --> 00:02:03.519
So once you start working
on bigger projects,

30
00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:06.666
you'll want to have a virtual
environment per project.

31
00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:11.515
But for the time being, it's just an easy
way for the instructions for Windows and

32
00:02:11.515 --> 00:02:15.320
for Mac to be the same, so
that we're typing in the same things.
