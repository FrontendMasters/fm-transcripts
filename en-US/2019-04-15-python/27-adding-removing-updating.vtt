00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.046
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: To add and
remove from sets,

2
00:00:02.046 --> 00:00:04.861
there are just a few methods
that we should look at.

3
00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:15.023
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Say I
have some colors here,

4
00:00:15.023 --> 00:00:18.900
red, green, blue.

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.310
To add to my set, I can call colors.add.

6
00:00:25.389 --> 00:00:28.169
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Let's take a look,
we'll see that our new value is in there.

7
00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.440
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: You can
remove items with discard.

8
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.641
So colors.discard, and pass in the value

9
00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:45.127
that you wanna discard from the set.

10
00:00:45.127 --> 00:00:50.508
I don't like the color green anyway,

11
00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:53.541
let's get rid of it.

12
00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:00.010
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: You
can also use remove.

13
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:04.111
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Like
we did with the list, but

14
00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:07.460
what happened with the list if we tried
to remove an item that wasn't there?

15
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.810
Got an error, right?

16
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.670
The nice thing about set discard is that

17
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.850
if you call it with an item
that's not in the set, no error.

18
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.830
So occasionally that's pretty useful.

19
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.550
Just like with a list, we can call remove.

20
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.805
So let's take a quick look at our colors.

21
00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:35.005
Call colors.remove on pink.

22
00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.920
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay, it's gone.

23
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.430
What happens if I try
to remove pink again?

24
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.460
Just like I did with the list.

25
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just ignore it.

26
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.900
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Or this time, because
I'm using remove I'm gonna get a key

27
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.930
error, that Pink is not in my set, okay?

28
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.400
So discard will get rid of
items in the set whether or

29
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.540
not they're present,
without complaining with an error.

30
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.210
Whereas remove will throw an error
if the item is not present.

31
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.457
So just two options,
and you might see both.

32
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:20.456
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Let's take
a look at updating the set.

33
00:02:20.456 --> 00:02:25.320
So,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: If I have my set

34
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.374
of colors, let's say I have another set of

35
00:02:29.374 --> 00:02:34.457
numbers
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: If I wanted to

36
00:02:34.457 --> 00:02:39.744
combine these two sets,
I could say colors.update(numbers).

37
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.922
So kind of similar like what you
did with a list using extend.

38
00:02:44.922 --> 00:02:47.952
And now,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Both sets

39
00:02:47.952 --> 00:02:48.850
are combined.

40
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.710
One of the quirks here is this update
function, it expects a sequence.

41
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.610
And If you don't pass in what
you think to be a sequence,

42
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.370
let's say you pass in a string.

43
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.690
We're gonna see something
interesting here.

44
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.060
All of a sudden we have
characters in there, right?

45
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.060
It's cuz the string is
actually a sequence, and

46
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.650
the update method went well, I expected
a sequence, you passed me in a string,

47
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.246
which is a sequence under the hood.

48
00:03:21.246 --> 00:03:24.680
I'm just gonna grab each individual
item from it and add it to the set.

49
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.040
Right?
It's probably not your intended result,

50
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.330
so it's something to look out for.
