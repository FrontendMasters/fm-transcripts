00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:03.731
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So we've been
working in the REPL this whole time, and

2
00:00:03.731 --> 00:00:07.070
the REPL is this incredibly useful,
powerful tool.

3
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.260
But sometimes we wanna save
our Python code, right?

4
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.740
We wanna run it again and again,
we wanna save it into a project.

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.698
We're gonna make files
with the .py extension and

6
00:00:19.698 --> 00:00:21.909
then we're gonna see how to run them.

7
00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:27.540
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So
just like variables in Python,

8
00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:32.875
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: The convention for

9
00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:36.020
naming your files is with all
lowercase and underscore.

10
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.880
We're gonna run our Python files from
VS Code, so let's create a new file.

11
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.000
On Mac that's Cmd+N,
on Windows it's Ctrl+N.

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.660
And we're going to put a little
bit of code in this file.

13
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.640
We're gonna say, we have a few greetings.

14
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.580
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And
we're gonna loop over these greetings.

15
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.582
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Oops, okay, so
you might be looking at this and

16
00:01:20.582 --> 00:01:25.138
saying, using an ID,
you promised me syntax highlighting,

17
00:01:25.138 --> 00:01:29.000
you promised me linting and
error checking.

18
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.510
This looks just like the REPL,
where is it, right?

19
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.690
So the key here is we need to save
our file with the Python extension so

20
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.130
that VS Code knows that
it's a Python file.

21
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.400
So I'll give you just a minute
to finish typing this in.

22
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.140
And then I'm gonna go ahead and
save this file as hello.py.

23
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.540
On Mac you just give it a .py extension.

24
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.780
On Windows you might have to select Python
file from the dropdown that appears.

25
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.950
So Mac Cmd + S to save,
Windows, CTRL + S to save.

26
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.450
We're gonna save this as hello.py and
there we go.

27
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.220
There is our syntax highlighting.

28
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.870
And look at that.

29
00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:17.750
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: It's a linter.

30
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.030
There's a red underscore here.

31
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.890
And it's giving us a hint that we
didn't type in something correctly,

32
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.200
that we have a syntax
error in our program.

33
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.130
Can anyone spot it?

34
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,
there's an extra quote.

35
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.780
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: That's right.

36
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.430
So now if we take out that extra quote and

37
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.240
we save our file,
that linting error will go away.

38
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.340
To run your Python code from the VS Code
terminal, you're gonna use that

39
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.430
command pallet that we learned
about earlier in the day and

40
00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.650
you're going to hit Run Python File
in Terminal, or narrow it down.

41
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.340
And you should see the results here.

42
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.180
Should say, hello world,
bonjour world, hola world.

43
00:03:14.328 --> 00:03:17.284
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Notice that VS Code
automatically picks up the virtual

44
00:03:17.284 --> 00:03:22.380
environment for us, that env environment
that we saw earlier in the class.

45
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.910
If we are in the right directory, so for

46
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.051
me, I'm gonna have cd into here.

47
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.109
If we wanna run our files from the
terminal outside of VS Code, if we're in

48
00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.054
our inner virtual environment, we can
just do that with the Python command.

49
00:03:40.054 --> 00:03:46.250
And then pass in the name of our
Python file and it'll run it.

50
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.428
Outside of the virtual environment
you'll need to specify

51
00:03:50.428 --> 00:03:52.690
the correct version of python.

52
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.770
And if you remember from the beginning,
we checked our python version.

53
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.114
That's the same command
that you would use to

54
00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:03.810
run your Python program
outside of the terminal.

55
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.100
So just a few tips here.

56
00:04:09.934 --> 00:04:14.813
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I'm gonna make a new
file and save it, called name.py, and

57
00:04:14.813 --> 00:04:17.630
I recommend you do as well.

58
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.420
By saving it as a Python file first, I get
the syntax highlighting right off the bat.

59
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.270
So I'm gonna add this in.

60
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.483
I'm gonna make a new variable with
my name and then in the repo we were

61
00:04:30.483 --> 00:04:35.710
able to just kind of write variables and
see the results right away.

62
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.550
If we run this,
we're not gonna see any output.

63
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.700
It's because the REPL and

64
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.780
running the Python programs
works a little bit differently.

65
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.950
So in your Python programs you have
to explicitly print things out

66
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.640
in order to see any output.

67
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.470
So once we make that change
we'll see the result right here.
