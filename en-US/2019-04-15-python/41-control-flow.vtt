00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.600
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: The if statement, the
contents of the if statement will only run

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.210
if the condition is true,
otherwise they don't.

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:15.232
So if 3 is less than 5,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: We

4
00:00:15.232 --> 00:00:16.440
should see that printed out.

5
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.924
If we do it the other way around,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: If 3

6
00:00:22.924 --> 00:00:32.789
is greater than 5,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: We won't see anything.

7
00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.956
You don't need parentheses in your if
statement here like you might in other

8
00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:39.508
languages, you just have
to put a condition.

9
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:45.310
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: If statements
also work with truthiness.

10
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.260
So let's say a is an empty list and

11
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.820
I say if a print("Hello"),
what am I gonna see?

12
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.692
Nothing, right.

13
00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:02.019
What if I had a variable b,

14
00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.463
a list that had some items in it,
and I say,

15
00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:13.077
if b print("Hello"), what will I see?

16
00:01:13.077 --> 00:01:14.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You'll see it.

17
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.590
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I'll see it,
yeah, it's truthy.

18
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.519
So,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: If statements have

19
00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:24.630
a few more components to them.

20
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.990
We know that the code in the if statement
only runs if the if statement is

21
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.200
true, right?

22
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.950
So I say a is true, if a print("Hello").

23
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.050
It'll run, right?

24
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.656
If we want something to
run in the opposite case,

25
00:01:44.656 --> 00:01:49.029
if a is not true, we'll say else, and

26
00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:53.571
use the colon and say Goodbye, right?

27
00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:59.865
So that prints out Hello if a was false,
and we wrote the same code,

28
00:02:07.513 --> 00:02:08.609
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: We'll get Goodbye.

29
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:14.190
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: One
other thing here is else if.

30
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.830
So let's say a is equal to true,
and b is equal to true.

31
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.900
So I can say, actually, sorry,
let's make a false, and b true.

32
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.890
So I can say, if a, right,
if a is true, we're gonna print out 1.

33
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.500
Otherwise, I will say that with else if or
in Python abbreviated to elif.

34
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.625
Also with a colon, oops.

35
00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:58.069
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: We
need a condition here, and

36
00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.670
else if is not an else statement.

37
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.840
So we'll check for something else.

38
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.605
We'll say, elif b is true, print("2").

39
00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:12.264
And then else means if neither
of those conditions are met,

40
00:03:12.264 --> 00:03:14.060
print this other thing.

41
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.970
And you can have as many else
ifs in your code as you want to.

42
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.776
So in this case, it'll print out two.

43
00:03:20.776 --> 00:03:23.888
a was not true, so we skipped this.

44
00:03:23.888 --> 00:03:26.799
But this condition was true and
so we went in here, and

45
00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.500
then we skipped the else because
we found a condition that matched.
