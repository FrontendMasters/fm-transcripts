00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.094
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Let's open up
our first project, let's change to

2
00:00:05.094 --> 00:00:10.974
our home directory, for
Windows that's cd space $home.

3
00:00:10.974 --> 00:00:15.618
And then enter the Py workshop
folder from the last step,

4
00:00:15.618 --> 00:00:18.742
the directory that you just created.

5
00:00:18.742 --> 00:00:24.497
We're gonna activate our virtual
environment, should already be activated.

6
00:00:24.497 --> 00:00:28.364
Now we're gonna open a project
from VS code in the command line.

7
00:00:28.364 --> 00:00:34.003
So from that project directory
we're gonna type code space dot,

8
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:38.832
this should open the project
in the current directory.

9
00:00:38.832 --> 00:00:42.997
And this is the last time we're gonna be
using the terminal outside of VS code for

10
00:00:42.997 --> 00:00:44.500
the duration of the course.

11
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.780
Now if for
some reason this isn't working for you or

12
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.070
you're getting a permission
denied error or

13
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.930
something like that, you can just open
VS code from wherever you installed it.

14
00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.190
Just double-click on the application and
then navigate to File,

15
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.590
Open, and open this PyWorkshop folder.

16
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.634
So there are two really important
keyboard shortcuts that you'll

17
00:01:09.634 --> 00:01:12.752
need to remember for
VS code and that's it.

18
00:01:12.752 --> 00:01:17.421
If you have Notepad open or
a piece of paper, I recommend just

19
00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:22.290
writing them down so
you have them handy, the command palate.

20
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.688
So on Mac, that's command shift p,
on Windows, control shift p.

21
00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:33.505
This is just your map to VS code,
you can type any command in here and

22
00:01:33.505 --> 00:01:36.103
it will just easily narrow it down.

23
00:01:36.103 --> 00:01:38.990
Anything that you might wanna do,
you'll find from the command palate.

24
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.450
The next is the open file dialog,
on Mac, that's command P, on Windows,

25
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.430
it's Ctrl P, and that will easily let
you open any file in your project.

26
00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:53.962
And as you type it'll narrow things down.

27
00:01:59.634 --> 00:02:02.524
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So
that's the basics of VS code,

28
00:02:02.524 --> 00:02:06.043
a little bit about working with Python.

29
00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:08.983
Where the first time that we
open a Python file in VS code,

30
00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:11.388
we're gonna get some
configuration pop ups.

31
00:02:11.388 --> 00:02:12.340
For the time being,

32
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.105
make sure that you don't dismiss them
cuz we're going to take action for them.

33
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.366
So let's make a new file called
project.py in the Py Workshop directory.

34
00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:29.213
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And
if we wanted to do that from VS Code,

35
00:02:29.213 --> 00:02:31.680
there is a built in terminal.

36
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.377
I know this via the keyboard shortcuts,
on Mac it's CTRL + backtick and

37
00:02:36.377 --> 00:02:38.920
on Windows it's CTRL + single quote.

38
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.110
So that should drop you
into the py workshop

39
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.780
directory right here in the terminal.

40
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.190
And on Mac,
we can just say touch project.py,

41
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.013
and that'll make a new Python file here.

42
00:03:02.153 --> 00:03:06.275
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Or you can make
a new file via this top left icon here,

43
00:03:06.275 --> 00:03:09.130
that's your explorer.

44
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:16.679
You can just select the right folder and
then hit this new file button.
