00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.533
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Let's
talk about mutability.

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:05.641
I feel like y'all have a pretty
clear picture of mutability, but

3
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:08.490
let's take a quick look
at this cheat sheet.

4
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.967
So mutability simply put is, can the
contents of a mutable object be changed?

5
00:00:14.967 --> 00:00:22.088
Yes, the contents of an immutable object
can't be after it's been created.

6
00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:25.677
So for the simple data types,
the ints, floats,

7
00:00:25.677 --> 00:00:30.390
strings, booleans,
those are all immutable objects, right?

8
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.576
We've seen numbers and
strings be used as keys in a dictionary.

9
00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:39.638
We've seen them be used in sets, right.

10
00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:43.590
For the container types,
is a list mutable?

11
00:00:47.385 --> 00:00:48.741
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Yes.

12
00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:51.523
Is a set mutable?

13
00:00:51.523 --> 00:00:52.608
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

14
00:00:52.608 --> 00:00:54.493
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Is
a dictionary mutable?

15
00:00:54.493 --> 00:00:55.559
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

16
00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.359
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Is a tuple mutable?

17
00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:58.158
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No.

18
00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:00.518
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: No,
you all get gold stars.

19
00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:01.590
I'm so proud of you.

20
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.233
Okay, that's a lot.

21
00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:06.128
This is kind of the longest chapter, but

22
00:01:06.128 --> 00:01:09.990
these are some of the most important types
that you'll be working with in Python.
