00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.679
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: We saw how to
import other kinda local files.

2
00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:12.181
If we want to use external libraries,
we need to use a tool called pip,

3
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:17.500
which will kind of go out into
the world past the standard library and

4
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.262
install an external
library that we wanna use.

5
00:00:21.262 --> 00:00:25.202
I'll talk more about
external libraries tomorrow.

6
00:00:25.202 --> 00:00:31.508
But for now, let's use pip to
install the request library.

7
00:00:31.508 --> 00:00:35.754
So everybody with your virtual environment

8
00:00:35.754 --> 00:00:40.810
activated type in python
-m pip install requests.

9
00:00:45.358 --> 00:00:46.220
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And once you hit

10
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.336
Enter,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I've already installed

11
00:00:51.336 --> 00:00:54.645
it before, but you should see that it's
kind of downloading and installing.

12
00:01:01.105 --> 00:01:03.590
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Once that's finished,

13
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.278
you can import requests just
like you imported nameweb.

14
00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:18.418
So,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I'm just

15
00:01:18.418 --> 00:01:23.684
gonna save those file, but,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: It's

16
00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:27.161
not kinda really necessary for you all.

17
00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:33.410
So I can just import a request here, and
that will import that external library.
