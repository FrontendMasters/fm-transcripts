00:00:00.043 --> 00:00:03.314
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So Python,
it's a programming language.

2
00:00:03.314 --> 00:00:06.948
You might be surprised to learn that
Python is actually 30 years old.

3
00:00:06.948 --> 00:00:10.507
It's probably older than
some of you in the room,

4
00:00:10.507 --> 00:00:12.978
it's been around for a long time.

5
00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:17.552
And during that time I feel like there
have been a couple of misconceptions that

6
00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:19.161
have come up about Python.

7
00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:22.736
Some people think that Python
is just a scripting language.

8
00:00:22.736 --> 00:00:28.083
It's not, it's used that company is
from Reddit, Netflix, Dropbox, Quora.

9
00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:33.136
There are tons of other companies
that make productive use of Python.

10
00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:37.284
Some people say that Python doesn't scale,
that's also not true.

11
00:00:37.284 --> 00:00:42.788
Instagram is the largest
installation of Django,

12
00:00:42.788 --> 00:00:46.756
which is a Python web framework, and

13
00:00:46.756 --> 00:00:52.265
they have 1 billion users,
is that number right?

14
00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:53.584
I believe it's 1 billion.

15
00:00:53.584 --> 00:00:55.716
Yep, they just hit the billion mark.

16
00:00:55.716 --> 00:00:59.826
So, you might hear a little bit
about Python 2 versus Python 3,

17
00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.714
you might hear a lot about it.

18
00:01:01.714 --> 00:01:06.355
This part's a bit of a stain on
the python programming language.

19
00:01:06.355 --> 00:01:11.289
Python 3 was released in 2008,
so it's 11 years old, and

20
00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:13.812
it's adoption was really slow.

21
00:01:13.812 --> 00:01:18.740
First and foremost because it took really
popular languages a fair amount of

22
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.446
time to port over their code,
but the debate is over now.

23
00:01:22.446 --> 00:01:26.042
Python 2 is gonna reach end
of life in 2020, meaning that

24
00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:31.037
important updates including maybe security
updates are gonna stop being released.

25
00:01:31.037 --> 00:01:37.607
So this course and your code going forward
should always focus on Python 3 only.

26
00:01:37.607 --> 00:01:38.780
Why Python?

27
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.361
Python is a language of open source,
and the language is open source.

28
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:47.998
You can look on GitHub right here.

29
00:01:47.998 --> 00:01:53.174
And if you'd like,
if you advance in your Python journey and

30
00:01:53.174 --> 00:02:00.291
you feel comfortable enough to contribute,
even to the documentation, you can.

31
00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:02.975
Which can't be said for
a lot of other languages.

32
00:02:02.975 --> 00:02:06.397
It also has a wide
variety of applications,

33
00:02:06.397 --> 00:02:09.178
like AIML we talked about earlier.

34
00:02:09.178 --> 00:02:16.091
There are tons of Python packages, SciPy,
NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, all very popular.

35
00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:22.371
Python has made the work that
scientists do so much easier.

36
00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:27.037
It's been instrumental in a number
of breakthroughs and discoveries.

37
00:02:27.037 --> 00:02:31.660
It can be used on hardware
microcontrollers.

38
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.569
Raspberry Pi started this at homemaker
movement of tinkering with hardware.

39
00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.574
There are MicroPython and CircuitPython,

40
00:02:41.574 --> 00:02:46.538
Python variance that can run on micro
controllers as small as a quarter.

41
00:02:46.538 --> 00:02:50.541
Which is one of my hobbies, I love playing
around with those types of things.

42
00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:53.274
There is web developments, so Django and

43
00:02:53.274 --> 00:02:56.327
Flask are two hugely
popular web frameworks.

44
00:02:56.327 --> 00:02:59.189
But then if you want to do scripting,
you can do that too.

45
00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.297
It's very popular for DevOps and
configuration scripts, etc.

46
00:03:03.297 --> 00:03:07.524
Python also has a really
rich standard library,

47
00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:12.898
as well as the PyPi package index for
third-party packages.

48
00:03:12.898 --> 00:03:19.068
In February of 2019,
it contained 167,000 of them.

49
00:03:19.068 --> 00:03:22.425
And Python is considered
a batteries included language,

50
00:03:22.425 --> 00:03:26.740
because the standard library also
contains a majority of the libraries and

51
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.183
packages that you might need
under standard application.

52
00:03:30.183 --> 00:03:35.889
People believe that that's why Python
became popular in the first place.

53
00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:42.819
And to me, one of the most incredible
thing about Python is the community.

54
00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.813
The biggest yearly conference is PyCon US,
there are approximately 4,000 attendees.

55
00:03:47.813 --> 00:03:53.035
There are lots of user groups worldwide,
a lot of them are listed, there's a wiki.

56
00:03:53.035 --> 00:03:55.801
There are also many supportive groups for

57
00:03:55.801 --> 00:04:00.314
women and nonbinary developers
such as PyLadies and Django Girls.

58
00:04:00.314 --> 00:04:06.394
And these organizations have chapters
in most major cities across the US and

59
00:04:06.394 --> 00:04:08.014
internationally.

60
00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:11.187
Let's quickly talk about conventions.

61
00:04:11.187 --> 00:04:15.848
So, in Python,
the most important convention is PEP8, and

62
00:04:15.848 --> 00:04:18.009
there's kind of a lot to it.

63
00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:22.300
So, we can look at this
site which is pep8.org,

64
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.786
it's a little bit of a standard on site.

65
00:04:25.786 --> 00:04:29.555
So PEP8 is a style guide for Python code,

66
00:04:29.555 --> 00:04:33.765
this is one of the nicest
parts of python code.

67
00:04:33.765 --> 00:04:36.836
There's just a kind of this
globally accepted style guide,

68
00:04:36.836 --> 00:04:41.116
if you have a link to it, it'll give you
suggestions when you're not following it.

69
00:04:41.116 --> 00:04:45.783
And that makes most good
Python code look very similar,

70
00:04:45.783 --> 00:04:50.164
makes it very easy to read,
you know what to expect.

71
00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:54.480
I worked on some Java projects where we
had a debate and we didn't have a style

72
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.930
guide and some people would put their
opening curly brace on the same line, and

73
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.504
some people would put it on their
new lion, and it would make for

74
00:05:02.504 --> 00:05:04.071
nightmare diffs, right?

75
00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:06.741
Python really minimizes that.

76
00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:10.711
So, I recommend looking
through this briefly.

77
00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:14.471
But in the meantime let's
look at a few of these.

78
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:18.049
Indentation, it's four
spaces per indentation.

79
00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:24.028
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Four spaces per
indentation level is the standard here.

80
00:05:24.028 --> 00:05:30.130
It'll tell you about tabs or
spaces, the maximum line length,

81
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.227
also comments, whitespace,
naming conventions.

82
00:05:35.227 --> 00:05:40.595
So here's there some descriptive
naming styles, for example,

83
00:05:40.595 --> 00:05:47.244
use lowercase with underscores,
capitalized words when using classes, etc.

84
00:05:47.244 --> 00:05:50.290
Cuz kind of a lot here,
we'll talk about it when it pops up, but

85
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.010
when you hear me say PEP8,
you're know what it means.
