00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.586
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: This REPL is
where we're going to live for class.

2
00:00:02.586 --> 00:00:07.117
It's where you're going to experiment,
answer your own questions, etc.

3
00:00:07.117 --> 00:00:11.648
There's only just a few don'ts
about variables in Python.

4
00:00:11.648 --> 00:00:16.699
The first is that they
cannot start with a number.

5
00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.773
So if I type 3x equals 4,
I'm going to get an error.

6
00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:24.448
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Let's
quickly talk about this.

7
00:00:24.448 --> 00:00:27.804
Syntax error, invalid syntax.

8
00:00:27.804 --> 00:00:30.626
So it sounds kind of really scary,
what's going on?

9
00:00:30.626 --> 00:00:34.230
the thing that you have to know about
tracebacks, when you're get an error,

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.125
when an exception is thrown,
you're gonna get a traceback.

11
00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:41.817
You wanna read them from the bottom
to the top, line by line.

12
00:00:41.817 --> 00:00:44.265
And then they'll make a lot more sense.

13
00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:47.697
So here we'll see,
we got a syntax error, invalid syntax.

14
00:00:47.697 --> 00:00:51.172
I just said variables in Python
can't start with a number,

15
00:00:51.172 --> 00:00:52.501
tried to do it anyway.

16
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:53.431
In the REPL,

17
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:58.767
we'll see this kinda handy arrow
pointing exactly where the problem was.

18
00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:01.432
Then it'll show you the expression.

19
00:01:01.432 --> 00:01:06.889
And once we start running Python code
from files, we'll see the file here.

20
00:01:09.114 --> 00:01:14.393
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Besides for this, and
a few other things, Python really doesn't

21
00:01:14.393 --> 00:01:19.303
stop you from doing a lot,
which can be problematic at times.

22
00:01:19.303 --> 00:01:22.766
So don't type in what I'm typing in.

23
00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:33.262
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So in Python we
have a built-in type called list.

24
00:01:33.262 --> 00:01:38.098
I can easily name my variable list, oops.

25
00:01:40.498 --> 00:01:45.327
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And
override the built in type.

26
00:01:45.327 --> 00:01:51.180
So don't do that,
cuz now if I try to make a new list,

27
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.105
it's gonna say int object is not callable,

28
00:01:56.105 --> 00:01:59.049
type error, why is that?

29
00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.370
Because I just set list to 1.

30
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.349
Okay so we're gonna talk about lists,
dictionaries, sets, integers.

31
00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:08.385
A few other data types.

32
00:02:08.385 --> 00:02:11.929
If you want to make a list you
can call it myList, right?

33
00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:17.040
Don't call your variable name list.

34
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.958
There's a trick to clear
out of this bad state.

35
00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.606
But I'm not going to show it to just yet.

36
00:02:23.606 --> 00:02:28.925
In the meantime, you can press,
hopefully none of you type this in.

37
00:02:28.925 --> 00:02:33.408
But I'm just going to exit out of my REPL,
and then start it back up again.

38
00:02:33.408 --> 00:02:36.528
This time I just pressed the up arrow and

39
00:02:36.528 --> 00:02:42.308
found this command that VS code auto
inserted, and got right back here.

40
00:02:42.308 --> 00:02:45.310
Okay, so-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I've got a question.

41
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.230
With the hashtag that you
did don't type this in.

42
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.547
Is that like a comment that
you can put into the REPL?

43
00:02:49.547 --> 00:02:50.544
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: It's a comment.

44
00:02:50.544 --> 00:02:51.365
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, thank you.

45
00:02:51.365 --> 00:02:54.934
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Yeah, you probably
won't be putting comments into your REPL.

46
00:02:54.934 --> 00:02:57.172
But you can if you want to.

47
00:02:57.172 --> 00:03:00.914
You just have to remember to enter
an extra space when you're done.

48
00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:04.973
I'm sorry, press enter an extra time
once you're done with a comment.

49
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.313
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay, so all of
you should have the REPL open by now.

50
00:03:10.313 --> 00:03:15.113
Just a heads up, the easiest way to save
the contents of your REPL after class if

51
00:03:15.113 --> 00:03:19.874
you'd like to, you can just right click
here, select all, copy and paste.

52
00:03:19.874 --> 00:03:23.961
You can do that at the end of the class.

53
00:03:23.961 --> 00:03:27.418
Unless you quit VS Code, or
hit this delete icon like I did,

54
00:03:27.418 --> 00:03:30.611
your REPL should be there
with all of its information.
