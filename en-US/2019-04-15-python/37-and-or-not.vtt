00:00:00.413 --> 00:00:03.680
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay,
lastly, and, or, &amp; not.

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.958
If you've done computer science,
you probably seen some

3
00:00:08.958 --> 00:00:14.789
truth tables in your day,
Python works a little bit different.

4
00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.622
Kind of,
the basic values evaluate the same,

5
00:00:18.622 --> 00:00:25.201
but,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: I

6
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:29.918
have a bit of cheat sheet here,
and this kind of comes into play

7
00:00:29.918 --> 00:00:34.840
when you're evaluating things
that have a truthiness to them.

8
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.288
If you're just kind of evaluating True and
False, the answer is obvious.

9
00:00:39.288 --> 00:00:42.019
Otherwise, you wanna take a quick
look at this cheat sheet.

10
00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:43.863
Let's just see this in practice.

11
00:00:50.412 --> 00:00:53.186
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Let's
say a is true and

12
00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:58.755
b is true,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: a and

13
00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:03.553
b, so and,
when you're comparing two true values

14
00:01:03.553 --> 00:01:08.349
in a truth table,
kind of know that both values a and

15
00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:12.720
b have to be true,
in order for True to return.

16
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.369
But because a is true here,
we're returning the value of b,

17
00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.750
which just happens to be True.

18
00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:25.064
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: This makes more sense,

19
00:01:25.064 --> 00:01:30.123
let's look at something
with a truthiness value.

20
00:01:33.763 --> 00:01:38.709
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: All right, so both of
these lists with items in them are truthy.

21
00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:44.453
When doing list 1 and list 2,
the first one is True,

22
00:01:44.453 --> 00:01:49.303
and so
we're gonna return the second one, so

23
00:01:49.303 --> 00:01:53.017
a little bit of a trickiness to it.

24
00:01:53.017 --> 00:01:57.357
Let's say a is False and b is True,

25
00:01:57.357 --> 00:02:02.745
if we do a and b, it's gonna return False,

26
00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:06.066
so that's the value of a.

27
00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:11.610
And then if a is False and
b is False, and we do a and

28
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.716
b, False is returned again,
that's the value of a.

29
00:02:17.716 --> 00:02:22.559
So if I had an empty list and
an empty dictionary,

30
00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.351
we would see the empty list returned.

31
00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:30.292
If I had an empty list, false-y value, and

32
00:02:30.292 --> 00:02:35.950
a set with one item in it,
it would still return that first one.

33
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.037
I still kind of forget this stuff, so
that's why the table is super helpful.

34
00:02:41.037 --> 00:02:46.491
Okay, so for or,
if a is True and b is True,

35
00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:51.048
a or b, that returns the value of a.

36
00:02:51.048 --> 00:02:55.292
So quickly, with truthiness,
that returns the value of a.

37
00:02:55.292 --> 00:02:58.853
If a is False and b is True, a or

38
00:02:58.853 --> 00:03:03.278
b will return the value of b, right?

39
00:03:03.278 --> 00:03:10.690
So if this is False and this is True,
it'll return the True item.

40
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.006
And if we look at the numbers,
remember, 0 is False, and

41
00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:21.443
any other number is True,
this will return the True value.

42
00:03:21.443 --> 00:03:26.400
And not is just the inversion,
and not will return True or

43
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.649
False, it doesn't return
any specific value.

44
00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:37.619
So not False is True,
not True is False, just the negation.

45
00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:40.619
Again, we can use bool to kind of check,

46
00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:44.519
we know that bool(1) is True,
so not 1 is False.

47
00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.947
bool(0) is False,
not 0 is gonna be what, not False?

48
00:03:50.947 --> 00:03:51.980
&gt;&gt; Student: True.

49
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.051
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: True, exactly right,
yeah, and you can kind of use these

50
00:03:57.051 --> 00:04:02.864
things in combination, so
there's an order of operations here.

51
00:04:02.864 --> 00:04:05.888
And if you want to kind
of be very specific,

52
00:04:05.888 --> 00:04:08.665
this is where you can use parentheses.
