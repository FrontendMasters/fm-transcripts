1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.970
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay,
a few requirements.

2
00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.620
So these are mandatory prerequisites for
successfully participating in this course.

3
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.750
You should have all done
them before the course.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.200
You're gonna need a Linux,
Mac OS, or Windows 10 machine.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.690
We're gonna be working
exclusively with Python 3.7, so

6
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.570
you're gonna need the latest version.

7
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.130
I'm gonna be using
the Visual Studio code IDE,

8
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.530
as well as the Python extension for
that IDE.

9
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.732
There are few additional instructions for
Windows users here,

10
00:00:30.732 --> 00:00:33.120
in setting the execution policy.

11
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.307
If you close this Powershell Window,
I recommend opening it up again because we

12
00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:39.754
will be using that for
the first few sections.

13
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.839
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Everyone is checked
for Python 3 on Windows with PY -3.7 or

14
00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:52.950
on Mac and
Linux you can type python3 --version.

15
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.740
We all wanna see version at least 3.71.

16
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.463
&gt;&gt; Student: Yeah, just a quick question
about the Python extension for

17
00:00:59.463 --> 00:01:00.450
Visual Studio Code.

18
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.500
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Yes?
&gt;&gt; Student: Which one is it?

19
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.015
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: It's just
the standard Python extension,

20
00:01:07.015 --> 00:01:09.630
I'll show it to you real quick.

21
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.320
If you go to this, if you open VS code and
you click on this square.

22
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.370
If you search for extensions and
just search for Python, it just this one.

23
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.291
There are 34 million downloads so yeah,

24
00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:29.030
that's the right one.

25
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.620
You could install it from
the link that I provided.

26
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.730
You can install it from
this square extensions tab.

27
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.762
Or the first time you open a Python file,
if you don't have installed yet,

28
00:01:39.762 --> 00:01:41.240
it will give you a tool tab.

29
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.121
So I wouldn't worry about
grabbing that just yet.

30
00:01:46.121 --> 00:01:49.271
Okay, so now that we've all
gotten to the same point,

31
00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:53.398
what we want to do is create a virtual
environment and a project folder.

32
00:01:53.398 --> 00:01:57.934
So Linux, Mac, Windows, the instructions
are going to be a little bit

33
00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:02.709
different here, so I recommend following
along from the course website.

34
00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:07.310
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Virtual
environments in Python,

35
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.940
they're like a self contained directory
that contains the Python installation for

36
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.760
a particular version of Python.

37
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.310
It's nice because we don't have to use
that py-3, we don't have to call Python 3.

38
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.763
Once we set up this virtual environment,

39
00:02:21.763 --> 00:02:26.120
our executable will just be Python and
it'll point to the right version.

40
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.249
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: So for
Windows, I have instructions here.

41
00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.416
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Open that same
PowerShell terminal from earlier,

42
00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:37.990
type in the commands.

43
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.720
I recommend looking at these from the
course website so that you get them right,

44
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.120
but the gist of it is we're going
to CD into our home directory.

45
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.796
We're going to make a new
directory called pie workshop.

46
00:02:49.796 --> 00:02:55.170
We're going to enter that
directory by CDing into it.

47
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.714
And then, on Windows we're
going to run this command.

48
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.290
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And that's going to
create a new virtual environment called n.

49
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.490
And then we'll activate it this way.

50
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.110
Once your virtual environment is
successfully activated on windows,

51
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.110
it's going to look like this.

52
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.800
There's going to be parentheses
end in front of your prompt.

53
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.860
Every time you close your terminal and you
get back into this project folder, you're

54
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.100
always gonna want to run this command
to activate the virtual environment.

55
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.440
Just the very last one.

56
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.681
So that while you're working
on your Python project,

57
00:03:33.681 --> 00:03:35.939
you'll see this end in parenthesis.

58
00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.080
For Mac and Linux, the instructions
are similar but a little bit different.

59
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.168
So you're going to CD
into your home directory,

60
00:03:44.168 --> 00:03:50.260
make the Python workshop folder,
make the virtual environment, etc.

61
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.535
Again on Mac, you'll see this kind
of parenthesis end in your prompt to

62
00:03:54.535 --> 00:03:57.614
indicate that the virtual
environment is active.

63
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.520
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Lastly, everyone sad
that they installed VS code already.

64
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.276
To double check that in Windows or
Mac just type code space dash

65
00:04:08.276 --> 00:04:12.950
dash version to make sure that
you are on the latest version.

66
00:04:26.418 --> 00:04:29.517
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay, moving on.

67
00:04:29.517 --> 00:04:32.669
Talked about VS code a little bit,
what is it?

68
00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.731
Visual Studio code is a free and
open source graphical co-editor.

69
00:04:37.731 --> 00:04:42.160
It offers plenty of extensions
to customize your experience.

70
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.840
We're gonna be using the really great
Python extension to edit our code.

71
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.730
It's jam-packed with a lot
of helpful features.

72
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.384
As you decide where you wanna
go on your Python journey,

73
00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:57.010
whether you wanna do web development,
AIML, data science.

74
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.090
Your tools might change, right?

75
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.610
But this is a good starting point for
most everybody.

76
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.430
To get started with VS Code, I have some
links here that you've already followed.

77
00:05:11.808 --> 00:05:15.970
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: For
a long time I was a Emax user, right?

78
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.350
And I I thought I didn't really need IDEs,
but

79
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.470
I've learned that there
are a few advantages.

80
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.279
I've been using VSCode for about a little
over a year now and I really like it.

81
00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:34.030
Your code editor let's you easily manage
projects with multiple files and modules.

82
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.010
The Python extension offers a built-in
rubble, which we're gonna use.

83
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:43.190
So that we can easily test our snippets of
Python code and instantly see the results.

84
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.380
Code editors also offer
syntax highlighting,

85
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.172
syntax checking,
auto completion and a lot more.

86
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.500
You can also if you're a VI user or
an Emacs user, you can download key map

87
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.940
extensions to make the keyboard short
cuts exactly how you'd expect them.

88
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.890
But you also have choices.

89
00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.780
We're gonna be using VS code for
this course, just so

90
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.220
that I can show your the ropes
it's across the platform, windows,

91
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.400
Mac, their instructions are the came.

92
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.850
After class, you're free to switch
over to any editor of your choice
