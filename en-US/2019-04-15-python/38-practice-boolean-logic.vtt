00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.450
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Let's go through
our exercise for boolean logic.

2
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.890
Taking a look at vs code.

3
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.120
Doing some comparisons,
comparisons with numbers.

4
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.699
You know, 5 &lt; 10.

5
00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.200
We kind of saw all of that.

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.740
The interesting ones here
are equality is 5 == 5, yes.

7
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.720
Is 5 != 5, false, right?

8
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.444
But there are truthiness values kind of

9
00:00:36.444 --> 00:00:41.780
underlying truthiness to
some of these numbers.

10
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.661
So kind of where this makes
sense is let's say we had a very

11
00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:51.520
simple if statement,
which we'll cover in a second.

12
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.890
But the truthiness of
numbers other than 0 is true.

13
00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.595
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And so using an if
statement, this will evaluate to true, so

14
00:01:03.595 --> 00:01:07.860
just kind of a quick and
handy way to check truthiness values.

15
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.070
Under the hood, true and
false are represented by 1 and 0.

16
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.961
So this is just kind of
an interesting factoid,

17
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:22.950
so 1 == True, 0 == False.

18
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.937
We'll talk about why that is tomorrow, but
somebody in the chat figured that out so

19
00:01:27.937 --> 00:01:29.371
I thought that was fun.

20
00:01:29.371 --> 00:01:32.710
For and operations, for X or Y,

21
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.160
if X is false,
then we're going to return Y.

22
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.789
So if I have an empty list or
a list with an item in it,

23
00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.724
so a falsey or a truthy, it will return

24
00:01:49.724 --> 00:01:55.150
the truthy value using the or statement.

25
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.175
Or if I use,
sorry that's not a good example,

26
00:01:59.175 --> 00:02:06.208
let's say it was a,
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Falsey or truthy.

27
00:02:06.208 --> 00:02:10.009
But then truthy or truthy,

28
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.570
it's gonna return that first true value.

29
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.249
For and, if the first value is false,
it's gonna return that.

30
00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.020
Otherwise it's gonna
return the other value.

31
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.350
So for empty list and empty set we
are gonna get back an empty OS.

32
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.900
So the first false value.

33
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.610
So False and True false.

34
00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:41.409
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: If
we do two true values.

35
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.180
And we and them together.

36
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.930
It's going to return the second one.

37
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.260
Not returns a Boolean true or
false depending on

38
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.380
the truthiness of
the variable in question.

39
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.769
So not false true, not empty list.

40
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.640
That's the same thing
going on under the hood.

41
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.030
What will not empty list evaluate to?

42
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.811
Empty list is falsy, not falsy,
true, exactly right.

43
00:03:18.451 --> 00:03:21.530
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And of course
with strings, strings are truthy.

44
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.219
So if we did this truthy string and
none which is a falsy type.

45
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.484
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: It will return none,
right, nothing.

46
00:03:37.755 --> 00:03:38.471
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Okay.

47
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.968
&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: And
you're not limited to two operations,

48
00:03:43.968 --> 00:03:48.880
let's say a was true,
b was true, and c was true.

49
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.940
You can do a and b and c, and these

50
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.440
conditionals will get more complicated
as your programs get more complicated.
