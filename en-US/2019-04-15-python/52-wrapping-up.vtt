&gt;&gt; Nina Zakharenko: Thanks for
joining me today.

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:06.800
I hope you all enjoyed this whirlwind
tour of the Python programming language.

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.090
It's gonna give you a great foundation,
a great head start,

4
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.590
all of the building blocks that you
need to build useful Python programs.

5
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.240
For some next steps after today,
take a look at Pap 8 for

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.109
some more best practices and
naming conventions.

7
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.270
Check out my course Intermediate Python,

8
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.680
where we're gonna be using all of this
knowledge in a really hands on way.

9
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.786
And don't forget to check the course
website on Gethub, get.io/python3 for

10
00:00:34.786 --> 00:00:40.549
the latest link to the resources,
the exercises, and the course website.

11
00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:43.654
Thank you so much for joining me.
