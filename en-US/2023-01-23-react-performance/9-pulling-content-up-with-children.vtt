00:00:00.107 --> 00:00:03.915
This is another version of that
original tree chart that we saw,

2
00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:05.332
nothing special here.

3
00:00:05.332 --> 00:00:08.727
But there's a counterintuitive edge case,
and

4
00:00:08.727 --> 00:00:12.634
I am spiritually prepared to
answer questions on this.

5
00:00:12.634 --> 00:00:17.966
Because when I first learned about this,
words have meanings, and

6
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:23.390
I'm about to use two of the same
word in totally different meanings,

7
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.743
but I'm here for it, right?

8
00:00:25.743 --> 00:00:30.280
I will repeat myself as many times as
I need to, cuz I needed it myself.

9
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.618
So this is what we think of,

10
00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:38.227
which is parent components
re-render their child components.

11
00:00:38.227 --> 00:00:41.046
I'm not using the plural on purpose,
right, which is here,

12
00:00:41.046 --> 00:00:43.335
we've got the parent one
that passes down props.

13
00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:46.700
And maybe that middle one doesn't
even care about the props.

14
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.713
I'm uninterested in them completely.

15
00:00:52.713 --> 00:00:55.379
Actually when I was working
on one of the apps I saw,

16
00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.309
I just left the bug in there, right?

17
00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.411
Some of these,
I just left them there because I was,

18
00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:04.306
that's the thing I talked about earlier,
and I see it re-rendering.

19
00:01:04.306 --> 00:01:06.258
But then it would pass to that child and

20
00:01:06.258 --> 00:01:09.625
then it would pass it down to the one
that actually cares about it.

21
00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:12.986
And that's what we've seen the whole time,
that's what we know and we love, right?

22
00:01:12.986 --> 00:01:18.294
But what if we parsed the gates, right?

23
00:01:18.294 --> 00:01:24.795
When a component takes children as prop,
those children,

24
00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:29.614
I understand what's about to happen here.

25
00:01:29.614 --> 00:01:35.236
When a component takes children,
those children are not as child, right?

26
00:01:35.236 --> 00:01:40.612
It's a slot where the parent component
can render stuff in the middle, right?

27
00:01:40.612 --> 00:01:44.207
So basically you can skip that
middle one in this case, right?

28
00:01:44.207 --> 00:01:47.215
You have some of that
intermediary component,

29
00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:51.286
the children slot,
which still belongs to the parent, right?

30
00:01:51.286 --> 00:01:53.722
And then you have the rest of it, right?

31
00:01:53.722 --> 00:01:57.425
So it doesn't trigger
the tree all the way down.

32
00:01:57.425 --> 00:02:01.141
So it's another way that we
have pushing our content down.

33
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:06.243
And there's also the ability to lift up
the thing that if the grandparent and

34
00:02:06.243 --> 00:02:10.388
the child care about something,
and the parent is in the way,

35
00:02:10.388 --> 00:02:15.331
you can use the children slot and the
parent to kinda just have a direct line

36
00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:18.549
of communication from
the parent to the child.

37
00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:19.570
&gt;&gt; Similar to a context?

38
00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:22.669
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; No?

39
00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:24.437
&gt;&gt; Who wants the context in here so badly?

40
00:02:24.437 --> 00:02:27.870
&gt;&gt; No, I'm just trying to understand.

41
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.174
&gt;&gt; We'll see it in an example in a second.

42
00:02:31.174 --> 00:02:35.738
But I might have to stop and pull up
a different branch in a second, but

43
00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:37.563
I can show it to you as well.

44
00:02:37.563 --> 00:02:42.174
But, Yeah, it's in the exercise,

45
00:02:42.174 --> 00:02:44.501
and I think I have another branch of
the packing list so I can show it.

46
00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:45.528
I just need one second to find it.

47
00:02:45.528 --> 00:02:48.499
But yeah, the idea is, so here,

48
00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:53.497
I have these reminders that
I put in the middle, right?

49
00:02:53.497 --> 00:02:57.693
They've nothing to do with the items, but
they show up in between the input and

50
00:02:57.693 --> 00:03:01.332
the rest of the packing list,
I just gotta switch over that branch.

51
00:03:01.332 --> 00:03:05.158
And so they got a rerender, because
you're like, they gotta be in the middle.

52
00:03:05.158 --> 00:03:08.773
What am I gonna do, right,
if the new item name,

53
00:03:08.773 --> 00:03:12.490
they got to have the highest
common denominator?

54
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.011
We can still actually pull up
the ability to put it in there as well.

55
00:03:17.011 --> 00:03:21.076
Let's look at it in code cuz saying
the word child and children 17 more times,

56
00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:24.366
I don't imagine it's gonna be
particularly helpful, right?

57
00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:25.574
So let's look.
