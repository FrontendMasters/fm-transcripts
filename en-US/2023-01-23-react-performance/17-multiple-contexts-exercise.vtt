1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.498
So we got this other app where I
did this already, it's all done.

2
00:00:03.498 --> 00:00:06.951
I did the thing, I did it.

3
00:00:06.951 --> 00:00:09.240
It's there, go take a look.

4
00:00:13.092 --> 00:00:15.020
Verify why it doesn't work.

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.068
[LAUGH] I did the thing,
it just doesn't work.

6
00:00:20.068 --> 00:00:22.730
Go spend ten minutes, we'll take a break.

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.677
And go look at why the thing that I
just showed you that totally worked, and

8
00:00:26.677 --> 00:00:29.811
you saw that it worked in a different app,
doesn't work.

9
00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:31.363
And then prepare to be sad.

10
00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:37.102
[LAUGH] It's the tagline of this workshop,
prepare to be sad.

11
00:00:37.102 --> 00:00:45.058
[LAUGH] Let's take a tour
of the code real quick.

12
00:00:45.058 --> 00:00:49.548
This one got a little bit more going on,
but not much, it's just got more models.

13
00:00:49.548 --> 00:00:50.704
So this one had only items.

14
00:00:50.704 --> 00:00:53.734
Yeah, so that's the kinda thing
where we start out slow and

15
00:00:53.734 --> 00:00:57.386
then we slowly escalate things until
it gets worse and worse and worse.

16
00:00:57.386 --> 00:00:59.071
So we have that in place.

17
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:01.642
And other than that, it's a CRUD app.

18
00:01:01.642 --> 00:01:02.816
Let's look at the UI.

19
00:01:02.816 --> 00:01:04.955
We'll look at the code.

20
00:01:04.955 --> 00:01:07.388
There is this concept of adding users.

21
00:01:07.388 --> 00:01:09.594
You can remove them, great.

22
00:01:09.594 --> 00:01:13.115
You can write a post, you can remove it.

23
00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:20.265
You can't edit anything, there'll be
editing in the next one, I promise.

24
00:01:20.265 --> 00:01:25.969
You can delete comments,
which is probably the best thing as well.

25
00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:26.791
Awesome, and

26
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:30.909
you can add a new comment as anyone
cuz there's no security on this app.

27
00:01:34.484 --> 00:01:36.212
That's interesting.

28
00:01:36.212 --> 00:01:39.569
Cuz I put it at the top because I
wanted to see the post at the top, so

29
00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:41.035
I turned them all on shifts,

30
00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:45.146
not realizing that I put the comments at
the bottom as I was moving stuff around.

31
00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:49.308
But generally speaking,
it all exists, it all works.

32
00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:49.881
Let's look at the code.

33
00:01:52.732 --> 00:01:57.540
And if we go, we've got a context.js,
that seems great.

34
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.844
Look at this, it's got a state context.

35
00:02:01.844 --> 00:02:04.758
It's got an actions context.

36
00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:06.374
It's got posts and users.

37
00:02:06.374 --> 00:02:10.381
So also comments are just
a sub-property on a post, right?

38
00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:13.818
And so a post has a comments
array just nested in there.

39
00:02:13.818 --> 00:02:16.973
So really, we got posts and users.

40
00:02:16.973 --> 00:02:20.821
I just lazily take all the action
creators and bind them on

41
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:25.723
to dispatch here using literally one
that I stole from Redux, it works.

42
00:02:25.723 --> 00:02:28.807
Sometimes you can grab some of
the helper utilities from Redux and

43
00:02:28.807 --> 00:02:31.120
not actually have to use Redux too,
if you want.

44
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.476
I'm doing the thing that I talked
about before, awesome, right?

45
00:02:35.476 --> 00:02:38.295
Other than that, it's a bunch of forms,

46
00:02:38.295 --> 00:02:42.093
it is a bunch of stuff like that,
everything's great.

47
00:02:44.545 --> 00:02:48.385
And so things should be good,
right, I should be able to go like,

48
00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:59.412
We can add a user, I can remove one.

49
00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:03.974
Everything flashed, right,
throughout everything, right?

50
00:03:03.974 --> 00:03:06.642
Some of that makes sense, right,

51
00:03:06.642 --> 00:03:11.343
cuz there is probably the list
of users and so on and so forth.

52
00:03:11.343 --> 00:03:12.342
What happens if I add a post?

53
00:03:16.183 --> 00:03:22.120
The user list flashed, they're not
even in any way related, that's weird.

54
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.433
Those seem extra things.

55
00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:27.587
But I did the thing, right?

56
00:03:27.587 --> 00:03:29.433
I did it.

57
00:03:29.433 --> 00:03:30.370
It should all be okay, right?

58
00:03:32.898 --> 00:03:34.197
What happened?

59
00:03:34.197 --> 00:03:35.330
Yeah.

60
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.795
&gt;&gt; Pieces of state, your posts, and

61
00:03:37.795 --> 00:03:43.664
users are still being provided to the same
context, but in a new object each time.

62
00:03:43.664 --> 00:03:44.166
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

63
00:03:46.448 --> 00:03:47.376
You know how to solve this?

64
00:03:50.472 --> 00:03:51.080
&gt;&gt; The third context?

65
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.524
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
[LAUGH] we just keep doubling down, right?

66
00:03:55.524 --> 00:04:00.030
And so this is one of the things to
think about when we come down to the,

67
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.318
should you always do a thing cuz one time
you watched a Frontend Masters course and

68
00:04:05.318 --> 00:04:09.075
a very charismatic human told you such and
such, right?

69
00:04:09.075 --> 00:04:13.176
Yeah, it's triggering rerenders, right?

70
00:04:13.176 --> 00:04:15.824
And it's worth considering, well,

71
00:04:15.824 --> 00:04:19.972
we're gonna do it,
because this is an academic exercise.

72
00:04:19.972 --> 00:04:24.196
Except one goes like, I don't think this
is gonna be how I make it big with where

73
00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:27.204
you could impersonate anyone
on a fictitious version of

74
00:04:27.204 --> 00:04:31.051
next door where it's all Lorem Ipsum,
I don't think this is it for me.

75
00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:35.966
So I think we should just learn from this
and how to get some hands-on experience.

76
00:04:35.966 --> 00:04:41.404
And so, yeah, the goal is basically this
pattern keeps working, but it also like,

77
00:04:41.404 --> 00:04:47.092
good news, the pattern keeps working, bad
news, the pattern keeps working, right?

78
00:04:47.092 --> 00:04:52.517
And so dealing with both of those starts
to create the issues for us, right?

79
00:04:52.517 --> 00:04:54.628
And so yeah, it's like nothing
that you wouldn't expect here.

80
00:04:58.774 --> 00:04:59.747
And you can go and create one.

81
00:05:03.025 --> 00:05:04.329
Change one of these.

82
00:05:22.316 --> 00:05:23.288
Get both of those in there.

83
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.830
This is where you watch me forget
which one I called which and

84
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.246
the one point in my set up.

85
00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:31.203
So it'll be the posts.

86
00:05:43.077 --> 00:05:43.920
I don't trust it.

87
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.586
And yeah, you have to ask yourself at a
certain point of like, when does this end?

88
00:05:55.586 --> 00:05:57.770
And I think it's a valid thing to ask.

89
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:04.638
So we've got that kinda in place,
I think I got everything in there.

90
00:06:04.638 --> 00:06:06.591
And then I gave myself these hooks.

91
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:09.239
So nice part is you see that
I like Visual Studio Code.

92
00:06:09.239 --> 00:06:14.389
I did f2 to rename something and
that did it across all the files,

93
00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:17.866
but did kind of move my
problem a little bit,

94
00:06:27.775 --> 00:06:34.639
Which giving yourself those abstractions
should be somewhat helpful, right?

95
00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.133
In this case, let's see.

96
00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.881
Use that map,

97
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:44.689
it's not a function probably cuz they're
pulling off an object in all those places.

98
00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:45.260
So there's a little bit of that.

99
00:06:48.637 --> 00:06:49.955
That was useUsers.

100
00:06:49.955 --> 00:06:52.577
&gt;&gt; I think context name.

101
00:06:52.577 --> 00:06:53.381
&gt;&gt; Where?

102
00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:54.749
&gt;&gt; In the context.js.

103
00:06:57.536 --> 00:07:02.104
Users context, line 27.

104
00:07:02.104 --> 00:07:04.246
&gt;&gt; Line 27, I missed one.

105
00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:10.780
Great, everything works.

106
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.045
Now, I can go ahead hopefully, right?

107
00:07:14.045 --> 00:07:16.409
You saw that we didn't flash over here,
right?

108
00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:17.981
And that is what we're looking for.

109
00:07:17.981 --> 00:07:23.152
So yeah, as I said before, there's two
major points I wanna make here as I run

110
00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:28.986
the profiler just to verify that it's not
something where I'm slowly losing my mind.

111
00:07:31.675 --> 00:07:35.158
Purposely why I don't clean
out these input fields.

112
00:07:35.158 --> 00:07:40.657
Great, we see the post flash, and
there's clearly more to do here, right?

113
00:07:40.657 --> 00:07:45.400
And we're gonna not follow this
necessarily all the way cuz I think I will

114
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.298
leave some of this as an exercise to
the reader, but individual posts are in

115
00:07:50.298 --> 00:07:55.491
there, The given keys, so on and so forth.

116
00:07:55.491 --> 00:08:00.691
But interestingly,
there are some interesting ones of adding

117
00:08:00.691 --> 00:08:05.706
a user shouldn't cause each and
every one of these, right?

118
00:08:13.924 --> 00:08:16.280
And then I think a post
is along those lines.

119
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.718
There are a few issues to find,
and there's I think five or

120
00:08:20.718 --> 00:08:22.268
six to find in here.

121
00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:25.644
But one of the ones I will point out,
cuz some of these I did on purpose, and

122
00:08:25.644 --> 00:08:28.444
I will leave them as an exploration,
kinda scavenger hunt.

123
00:08:28.444 --> 00:08:30.892
But there was an interesting one
that I didn't do on purpose.

124
00:08:30.892 --> 00:08:35.609
And that's the one I would like to draw
your attention to cuz I was just writing

125
00:08:35.609 --> 00:08:38.076
code, right, and just doing my thing,

126
00:08:38.076 --> 00:08:42.962
which I thought was kind of an interesting
one, which is if we look at the users,

127
00:08:45.186 --> 00:08:50.250
I pass in, I've got this map and

128
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:55.697
I go ahead and pass everything in.

129
00:08:55.697 --> 00:09:01.063
This here, having this as a function
I'm calling on the fly, and so

130
00:09:01.063 --> 00:09:06.065
there were little things in here
that were causing rerenders.

131
00:09:06.065 --> 00:09:10.494
And it's interesting to do the tools and
kinda look and play around, cuz there

132
00:09:10.494 --> 00:09:14.871
are ones that you will find that you
didn't intend to hide on purpose, yeah.

133
00:09:14.871 --> 00:09:19.562
&gt;&gt; But that particular function is passed
to the core, the leaf HTML element,

134
00:09:19.562 --> 00:09:21.850
right, so that shouldn't matter.

135
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.585
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm trying to think which,

136
00:09:24.585 --> 00:09:29.977
I think pushing it down actually
made more sense in this case, right?

137
00:09:29.977 --> 00:09:32.987
There were a few of them like this,
this one has the children in it.

138
00:09:32.987 --> 00:09:34.276
I'm trying to remember
exactly which one it was,

139
00:09:34.276 --> 00:09:35.268
cuz it was one of those I didn't plan.
