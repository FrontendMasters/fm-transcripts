&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Now, what you were tasked
to do is to get to the point where once we

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.800
create a new pet, it automatically shows
up in our new pets list without us having

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.530
to refresh the page using the update
function method on the use mutation.

4
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.680
So I think as a guide I can leave this up,

5
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.610
and as a guide here, because like I
said,it can get pretty complicated.

6
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.255
There's a lot you can do here, and
this is not the only way you can do it,

7
00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:32.230
there's other ways, this is
the recommended way, and go from there.
