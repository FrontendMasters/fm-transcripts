1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.240
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And now,
we're gonna go over, hopefully,

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.890
you had enough time to create
those optimistic responses.

3
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.360
If not, we're gonna do it right now, so

4
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.760
I decided to add the optimistic
response to the createPet.

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.580
So I have access to the input arguments,
which is gonna allow me to get as close as

6
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.540
possible to the result of the server,
which is gonna minimize

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.520
the interaction of the server data coming
in and replacing the hard coded data

8
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.860
that I'm about to write, because a lot of
that data's gonna be visually displayed.

9
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.770
So the closer I can get to it,
the less that effect is gonna be.

10
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.190
So I'm gonna choose to add my
to the createPet out of here.

11
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.412
So I'm going to say optimistic response,
which is an object.

12
00:00:44.412 --> 00:00:51.464
I'm gonna handle the type name for
the mutation.

13
00:00:51.464 --> 00:00:55.210
And then, I'm going to get the name of
the mutation, which is called addPet.

14
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.263
I'm going to add that there.

15
00:00:57.263 --> 00:01:01.111
And then, the type for addPet,
if you didn't know what that was,

16
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:03.948
you can go back to your
documents on Apollo Docs.

17
00:01:07.437 --> 00:01:09.965
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And you can look at
the schema, you can look at mutation,

18
00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:11.029
you can look at addPet.

19
00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:17.540
And then, you'll see, if I can scroll over
some more here, it returns addPet type.

20
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.020
So that's exactly what I wanna put for
the type name for

21
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.440
the addPet mutation, it's a pet type.

22
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.417
So I'll say typename, pet.

23
00:01:26.417 --> 00:01:29.130
And then, I just wanna get all
the fields from my mutation.

24
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.920
So I'm just gonna copy all these fields
here, make sure I got the exact ones, and

25
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.200
I'm gonna add them.

26
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.910
And here, it's not about
adding the type of the fields,

27
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.850
it's about adding values,
values you suspect the server to return.

28
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.880
So an ID, there's no way we know what
that ID is gonna be from the server.

29
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.100
So we'll just make one up.

30
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.590
We're gonna do something generic.

31
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.320
You can hard code something,
doesn't matter.

32
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.762
I'm just gonna do like rafta floor,

33
00:01:54.762 --> 00:02:01.238
flute rafta floor to a map
dot random times 1000.

34
00:02:01.238 --> 00:02:06.120
Plus a stream, maybe,
maybe, a bigger number.

35
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.900
So he's got a random number there, you
can do date.now, whatever you wanna do,

36
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.440
the name,
we actually get that from the input.

37
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.072
So we can just use input.name for that.

38
00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:18.651
And that's really good, because the names
do show up on that pet card, so

39
00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:21.520
that'd be really good to
not see that switch out.

40
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.590
The type, same thing, input.type,

41
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.190
and an image, right now, our servers
responsible for creating the images, so

42
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.870
we don't really know which one's gonna be,
so I'm just gonna add a placeholder, I got

43
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.200
one here, I'm just gonna add one from
placeholder.com with like the same with,

44
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.350
you can put whatever you want,
there's so many different strategies for

45
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.870
progressively loading in images,
there's literally not one way.

46
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.151
It depends on your UI.

47
00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:50.262
I was telling people you can have,
depending on the type you can load in

48
00:02:50.262 --> 00:02:54.970
a SVG that you have already built into
the app for a dog, or an SVG for a cat.

49
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.801
You can have a blurry image for a dog.

50
00:02:57.801 --> 00:03:01.849
There's so many ways that you can
load this in progressively, but

51
00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.020
there is no right or wrong way.

52
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.190
Just know that, because the images
are different that's the one transition

53
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.960
that you probably won't
be able to control.

54
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.420
So that's why there's a lot of creativity
around like how to solve this problem

55
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.210
with images.

56
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.510
But there's other data will be very close,
and

57
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.660
we're not showing the ID on the pet card.

58
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.680
So even though the ID is gonna be
different when it gets replaced,

59
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.300
no one's gonna notice that it's
happening in the background.

60
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.870
The input in the name do
show up in the car, but

61
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.170
they're exact ones that we sent up.

62
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.930
So unless the server modifies these to be
something different than what we sent up,

63
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.510
there and
look exactly the same as well, and

64
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.860
the image is the only one
that's gonna be different.

65
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.220
So if we didn't have any images,

66
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.980
you wouldn't even notice the change
at all after the mutation happened.

67
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.380
You wouldn't even see it, it would just be
there immediately, and then, that's it.

68
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.212
Nothing else would happen.

69
00:03:46.212 --> 00:03:47.870
I am going to save that.

70
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:54.220
Make sure we got our loading balloon
off of the mutation, save that.

71
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.080
And then, weâ€™ll go back and try it out.

72
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:05.000
So got a dog here, want to make a new cat,
and call it Carol.

73
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.200
Carol the cat.

74
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.560
And it showed up immediately, we saw
the placeholder image, and then, boom,

75
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.590
the cat popped in.

76
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.710
And the image was the only
thing that changed.

77
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.820
The word Carol and Cat didn't.

78
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.160
It stayed,
because it was exactly the same.

79
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.240
And that's the optimistic update,
which, again, is an alternative

80
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.390
to just showing a loaded screen every
time someone updates something.

81
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.677
Any questions on that?

82
00:04:26.677 --> 00:04:27.505
Yes.

83
00:04:27.505 --> 00:04:31.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If you find optimistic
response in those places, what's so other?

84
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.190
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: If you define them in both
places, then I believe the order's gonna

85
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.480
be the one that you pass in on
the invocation of the function.

86
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.980
So if I took this one here,
command button.

87
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.599
So I took this optimistic response,

88
00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:52.223
and I go up to here, and I add it here.

89
00:04:52.223 --> 00:04:55.900
And let's say, I change this to,
so we know the difference.

90
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.010
I'll give this a different name.

91
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.650
We'll say from mutation.

92
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.654
And we'll give this,
we'll always call this, well, yeah,

93
00:05:06.654 --> 00:05:08.930
we'll call this a cat always.

94
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:15.560
So we'll save that, go back here,
make sure that's good.

95
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.231
Cat,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Lilly,

96
00:05:21.231 --> 00:05:25.704
so you can see it took
the one from this one,

97
00:05:25.704 --> 00:05:32.210
because it had the name that I typed in,
this one override it.

98
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:38.250
Now, if I got rid of this one,
we should have the hardcoded one,

99
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.180
which is always a cat and
always have that name.

100
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.064
From mutations, there we go.

101
00:05:46.231 --> 00:05:48.521
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Any other questions?

102
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:50.952
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, what happens on error?

103
00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.000
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: What happens on error?

104
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.020
Good question, so let's see.

105
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.480
So if I add, let's make a error.

106
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.350
Let's put a j there, that's gonna cause
an error, cuz that's not a real field.

107
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.300
So we'll put a j,
they have an optimistic response.

108
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:15.940
Well, and a new dog, call it, yellow pet.

109
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.390
Your app just broken this case,
and that's because, we

110
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.510
have an error handler
here that breaks the app.

111
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.260
So it's just broken.

112
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.740
That's why you see that problem.

113
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.800
But I guess what you're asking is
like what happens to the cash?

114
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.140
If the air is out?

115
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.540
Well, if nothing ever comes back
from the optimistic response,

116
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.010
the caches is gonna keep that in there.

117
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.440
So yeah.

118
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.777
You'd have to get rid of it.

119
00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:47.150
[LAUGH] Basically, you'll have to
get rid of that thing yourself.

120
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.690
So account for those errors.

121
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:49.820
Errors are always use cases.
