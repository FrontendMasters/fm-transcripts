&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So for this exercise what
you're gonna be tasked with doing is

2
00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:05.922
creating a Optimistic response.

3
00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:11.520
So that our UI is going to update
immediately once we create a new path.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.710
So to do that,

5
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.310
you're gonna have to figure out where
you would add the Optimistic response.

6
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.990
Do you wanna add it on the useMutation
handler, after the update?

7
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.590
Or do you want to add it on the Create Pet

8
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.300
mutation in location itself
next to the variables.

9
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.700
The differences when you use Create Pet,
you'll get access to the actual variables.

10
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.050
Whereas inside the mutation handler
you won't, so pick and choose.

11
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.280
There's no right, there's wrong,

12
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.420
there's just different use cases
depending on what you're doing.

13
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.650
And just remember the optimistic
response object returns exactly or

14
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.740
pretty close to every single thing
that the mutation itself returns.

15
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.450
So in this case, an id,
a name, a type, a img.

16
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.077
And then it also returns these
hidden fields called _-typename,

17
00:00:56.077 --> 00:00:58.925
that we talked about, so __typename.

18
00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:03.014
So you have to return that __typename for
the mutation type, and

19
00:01:03.014 --> 00:01:06.748
then also the high level operation
which is also a mutation.

20
00:01:06.748 --> 00:01:09.930
So both of those type names there, and
then we'll come back and we'll finish it.
