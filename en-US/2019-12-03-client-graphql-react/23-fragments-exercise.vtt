&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I'm gonna set you off on
your last exercise, which is basically,

2
00:00:03.308 --> 00:00:05.055
you're gonna be doing two things.

3
00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:09.318
You're gonna extend the pet
type to have a new field on it,

4
00:00:09.318 --> 00:00:13.064
like vaccinated,
if the pet is vaccinated or not.

5
00:00:13.064 --> 00:00:16.171
And you're gonna resolve
it to some value and

6
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:19.286
make sure you add that
to your Apollo Client.

7
00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:23.657
And then you need to create some fragments
for all the pet types, just like I did,

8
00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:25.470
if you haven't done it already.

9
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.977
And update those fragments to exist
onto all pets and the new pet mutation.
