00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.501
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So
let's head into our client JS.

2
00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:05.061
And the objective was to
extend the pet type, so

3
00:00:05.061 --> 00:00:10.090
we can say extend,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: type Pet.

4
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.950
And we're gonna add a vaccinated,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Wait, it's vaccinated,

5
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:15.608
two Cs, right?

6
00:00:15.608 --> 00:00:22.952
Yeah, vaccinated and we'll say that's
a Boolean and we can say it's required.

7
00:00:22.952 --> 00:00:25.956
Then what we'll do is
we'll add a resolver for

8
00:00:25.956 --> 00:00:31.136
pet,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Vaccinated,

9
00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:34.552
and we'll just always return true for now.

10
00:00:37.348 --> 00:00:39.559
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So
that's as simple as doing that, and

11
00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.514
then we head into the pets query,
I already had the fragments on mine.

12
00:00:43.514 --> 00:00:48.426
But if you didn't have fragments,
just to go over it is you just

13
00:00:48.426 --> 00:00:52.966
need to make a new graph QL tag
using the fragment keyword,

14
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:56.876
name the fragment on
whatever type that you want.

15
00:00:56.876 --> 00:01:01.523
Add the fields that you're interested
in having this fragment encapsulate.

16
00:01:01.523 --> 00:01:07.775
And then you need to add those fragments
outside of an operation on a query or

17
00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:12.539
a mutation, and then use the spread,
which is dot dot dot

18
00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.616
with the name of the fragment,
and you'll be able to use it.

19
00:01:17.616 --> 00:01:18.781
So we got that.

20
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:23.701
I'm just gonna add one more field here for
the pet, which is vaccinated.

21
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:27.962
And I need to say @client
because it's from the client.

22
00:01:31.502 --> 00:01:34.167
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Go back,
looks like nothing is broken.

23
00:01:34.167 --> 00:01:39.210
Our pets are still good, nice and
cute animals there, and we're good.
