00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.689
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We're getting there,
right?

2
00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:07.650
We've seen couples, we've seen creative
store, combineReducers is a useful one.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.500
What it allows you to do is effectively,

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.279
you can you can imagine a world
in a large scale application,

5
00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.486
this function gets out of control, right?

6
00:00:21.486 --> 00:00:30.230
What combineReducers does is it
allows you to combine reducers right?

7
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.610
Yeah, right?

8
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.852
and you can basically take that large
tree and break it down to a series of

9
00:00:34.852 --> 00:00:37.896
smaller trees that becomes a little
bit more manageable, right?

10
00:00:37.896 --> 00:00:42.846
So like, all right, the context in
the marketing campaign said that might be

11
00:00:42.846 --> 00:00:44.990
one reducer for adding context.

12
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.503
Or like lists, we'll see it when
we build the compound board,

13
00:00:48.503 --> 00:00:51.884
we'll have lists, we'll have cards,
we'll have users,

14
00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:54.890
we'll kind of break those
out into separate pieces.

15
00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.641
So combineReducers is effectively,
we'll actually take this first reducer,

16
00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:07.610
just give it a better name,
we'll call it calculatorReducer, neat.

17
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.185
Let's change it over here,
so I don't break anything.

18
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.330
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll actually
get rid of this for now.

19
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.960
And what we'll say is,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Give

20
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.222
ourselves some space.

21
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.405
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll say
reducer = combineReducers.

22
00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:32.750
CombineReducers takes an object, right?

23
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.010
Because eventually we're
splitting up that tree.

24
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.364
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll say,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Calculator,

25
00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:47.927
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Is calculatorReducer.

26
00:01:51.237 --> 00:01:56.310
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, cool, and
then let's just cancel out that one.

27
00:01:59.136 --> 00:02:01.530
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, we haven't
hooked it up to a store or anything.

28
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.154
We're just taking a pure
JavaScript function,

29
00:02:04.154 --> 00:02:06.655
we're parsing it to those combineReducers.

30
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.320
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So there's a lot
of extra stuff in there, right?

31
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.350
But we get this function that
is a combination, right?

32
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.590
We've got some warning messages and
stuff along their lines.

33
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.990
And it basically allows us to create
sub-reducers in here as well, right?

34
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.150
And so the calculator one will get only
the calculator branch of the tree, right?

35
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.760
So our initial state might
now be something like,

36
00:02:40.476 --> 00:02:42.704
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Calculator 0,

37
00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:46.370
error is no error, right?

38
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.190
So, this reducer is only gonna
get this wing of the tree, right?

39
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.600
If we had an error reduce that we named
error, you get that wing of the tree.

40
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.553
So allows you to take this giant object
that Redux is holding on to, and

41
00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:01.300
breaking it up into manageable pieces,
right?

42
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.010
All right, we can deal with all
this stuff involve users over here.

43
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.230
All this stuff involves cards over here,
right?

44
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.660
And you can break this up
into as many as you want.

45
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.488
The really cool thing is that the actions

46
00:03:13.488 --> 00:03:18.110
still flow through all
of their reducers right?

47
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.990
So, if let say we've got a blog post and
comment, right?

48
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.305
We want to remove the comment completely
from the set of comments, and

49
00:03:29.305 --> 00:03:33.050
we also wanna remove the blog
post pointing to that comment.

50
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.890
That remove comment will flow
through both reducers, right?

51
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.224
And so you don't need to like,
fire off multiple actions or

52
00:03:40.224 --> 00:03:41.900
anything along those lines.

53
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.875
You can simply listen for the same
action in that payload multiple places.

54
00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:50.575
Yeah, because it's all it's
effectively one giant store.

55
00:03:50.575 --> 00:03:54.895
This is a big change from other database
management libraries like flux.

56
00:03:54.895 --> 00:03:57.633
Flux you might have all of
these different stores, right?

57
00:03:57.633 --> 00:03:58.345
That you'd keep it all separately.

58
00:03:58.345 --> 00:04:00.538
This is one giant object, and

59
00:04:00.538 --> 00:04:05.554
it gives us the ability to kind of
let them flow through each of them.

60
00:04:05.554 --> 00:04:09.454
So all combined producers does it's
effectively not unlike compose,

61
00:04:09.454 --> 00:04:10.760
completely separate.

62
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.182
We didn't actually make a store or
anything, it just takes multiple

63
00:04:14.182 --> 00:04:18.263
functions and pair them up with different
parts of this state object, all right?

64
00:04:18.263 --> 00:04:20.951
Super cool.

65
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:26.970
Replace reducer, I don't feel
the need to talk about [LAUGH].

66
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.980
It simply take that function and
swaps it out with another one, right?

67
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.945
I did mention this earlier,
I'll just say it again though, but

68
00:04:34.945 --> 00:04:39.940
you can theoretically use the spread
operator take what the current reducer is,

69
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.970
add another one with combineReducers,
right?

70
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.466
And then replace it.

71
00:04:44.466 --> 00:04:48.248
So you can kinda add more reducers as
you go along if you want to do some code

72
00:04:48.248 --> 00:04:51.230
splitting and lazy loading and
stuff along those lines.
