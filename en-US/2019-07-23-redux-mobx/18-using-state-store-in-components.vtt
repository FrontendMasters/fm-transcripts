1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.630
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
we did this before with the counter.

2
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.986
What we want to do is we want to,

3
00:00:03.986 --> 00:00:09.533
we're gonna need a list plural
container and a list container, right?

4
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:15.090
We have those IDs, and
we have that like individual like one.

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.500
And so what we'll do is
create those two components,

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.400
and then we'll kind of flush them out.

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.470
So this will be inside of containers.

8
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.960
I'll make a Lists, plural, Container, and

9
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.231
we'll make a List, singular, Container.

10
00:00:37.514 --> 00:00:38.805
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Great.

11
00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:43.680
Now in the ListsContainer,
we already have the actual component.

12
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.890
We don't need to write anything ourselves.

13
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.032
So we'll pull in connect from React-Redux,

14
00:00:51.032 --> 00:00:56.075
we'll pull in that Lists component.

15
00:01:00.158 --> 00:01:02.663
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So I have a components
directory and a containers directory.

16
00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:07.051
[INAUDIBLE] to go into components/Lists.

17
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:08.299
And now, okay, what do we wanna do?

18
00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.976
We know that there's gonna be cards,
we know that there's going to be users,

19
00:01:10.976 --> 00:01:13.140
we know that there's gonna be all
this stuff on the state tree.

20
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.539
What does Lists actually care about?

21
00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.614
It cares about just the lists [LAUGH].

22
00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:22.506
And it doesn't even care about,

23
00:01:22.506 --> 00:01:25.759
like the Lists plural doesn't
even care about the data.

24
00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.673
It just needs to know,
what are the IDs of this list, and

25
00:01:28.673 --> 00:01:32.530
then the individual list will be able
to figure it out, like, what list?

26
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.931
So what we're able to do here is,
we'll just make a mapStateToProps.

27
00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:44.200
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Function that's
gonna take all of our state.

28
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.657
Like that's going to be cards, it's going
to be users, it's going to be everything.

29
00:01:47.657 --> 00:01:52.300
And it's going to return a new
object which is just the list.

30
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.390
That's gonna be state.lists.ids, right,
so it's just gonna get that array of IDs.

31
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.600
What this means is that since that array
is not going to change, like we don't,

32
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.180
we're not going to implement
the ability to like rename a list.

33
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.710
But that would make us
make a new array of lists.

34
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.551
And then it would, like here,
that's not gonna change any IDs,

35
00:02:09.551 --> 00:02:11.820
which will save us a bunch of work.

36
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.460
So we'll make that.

37
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.956
And all we have to do is export default.

38
00:02:14.956 --> 00:02:16.377
I will take that mapStateToProps.

39
00:02:16.377 --> 00:02:20.416
I will take that Lists component.

40
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.450
And now we have this list
container that's automatically,

41
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.220
we can put it anywhere we
want in our application.

42
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.671
It doesn't care about
the component hierarchy,

43
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:29.923
it doesn't matter with any of that stuff.

44
00:02:29.923 --> 00:02:33.560
We take that List container component,
pop it wherever we want.

45
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.060
It is hooked up to Redux.

46
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.360
It will have the correct state.

47
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.116
We don't have to worry about any prop
drilling or anything along those lines.

48
00:02:40.116 --> 00:02:48.534
So let's go ahead and let's swap out
the Lists for the ListsContainer.

49
00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:50.610
So go to application.

50
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.425
So instead of Lists, we're gonna do Lists.

51
00:02:53.425 --> 00:02:56.147
The one thing you will catch me do, and

52
00:02:56.147 --> 00:03:00.327
someone needs to be on the hook for
this, is I will forget.

53
00:03:00.327 --> 00:03:03.728
First of all,
I'm writing in the wrong file.

54
00:03:03.728 --> 00:03:06.494
And then, I did export default, cool.

55
00:03:06.494 --> 00:03:08.066
So we'll export default.

56
00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:12.701
But I will forget to export
default at some point.

57
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:14.268
This ListsContainer,
we'll get rid of the Lists.

58
00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:19.285
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Now,
that's just gonna be an array of IDs.

59
00:03:19.285 --> 00:03:20.757
It's not gonna get us
all the way there yet.

60
00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:23.626
As we can see,
it's going through the list.cards,

61
00:03:23.626 --> 00:03:25.743
cuz the ID's don't have a cards on it.

62
00:03:25.743 --> 00:03:27.564
So we need to get
the individual list working.

63
00:03:27.564 --> 00:03:30.331
This is gonna involve
a slightly new concept for us.

64
00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:35.812
Because we're gonna receive a prop
that is telling us which list.

65
00:03:35.812 --> 00:03:40.766
Cuz while we have an array of IDs,
we've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

66
00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:45.326
If we need to go ahead and figure out
which list, then we're gonna need to like

67
00:03:45.326 --> 00:03:49.342
take that prop that get passed in and
then do it in mapStateToProps.

68
00:03:49.342 --> 00:03:53.656
So let's do that real fast.

69
00:03:53.656 --> 00:03:56.128
So we'll go and
we'll create that single List.

70
00:03:58.097 --> 00:03:59.137
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Container.

71
00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:09.837
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
we will import connect

72
00:04:09.837 --> 00:04:14.718
from react-redux.

73
00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:18.237
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll
import that individual List.

74
00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:26.291
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So mapStateToProps.

75
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:27.925
Here's a new concept for us.

76
00:04:27.925 --> 00:04:31.116
We need to figure out, all right,
so the props that this receives.

77
00:04:31.116 --> 00:04:33.081
We'll figure out which
list we need to grab.

78
00:04:33.081 --> 00:04:35.634
So it turns out mapStateToProps
takes a second argument.

79
00:04:39.616 --> 00:04:41.364
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It takes
the entire state tree,

80
00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:43.670
and it takes this thing called ownProps.

81
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.010
These are the properties passed to
the container when you use it, right?

82
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.560
So this is going to be in this case the ID
of the list that we're looking for.

83
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.700
So here we'll say return.

84
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.770
And we'll say, given list will be
state.lists, we have that entities.

85
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.051
And it will be ownProps.listId.

86
00:05:04.051 --> 00:05:09.223
So as long as we pass a listId as
a prop to this List singular container,

87
00:05:09.223 --> 00:05:12.130
it will go and figure out the right one.

88
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.585
We don't have to worry
about any of that stuff.

89
00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:20.886
And then all we need to do is export

90
00:05:20.886 --> 00:05:27.196
default that mapStateToProps.

91
00:05:27.196 --> 00:05:28.473
Cool.

92
00:05:28.473 --> 00:05:33.510
And now in our list, we'll just swap
this out for the list container.

93
00:05:37.401 --> 00:05:38.697
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This will
actually be a list ID now.

94
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:56.127
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We're gonna take out
this move card to List for a second,

95
00:05:56.127 --> 00:05:59.340
cuz it's still looking for the rest of
that, which we'll have to implement.

96
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.912
So we'll go ahead in a given.

97
00:06:04.944 --> 00:06:06.167
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Card, and
just comment this one out.

98
00:06:08.374 --> 00:06:10.893
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, so
you can see we have all of our lists.

99
00:06:10.893 --> 00:06:13.476
It's got some notion of cards.

100
00:06:13.476 --> 00:06:15.936
Right, but we had the same
problem that we had before,

101
00:06:15.936 --> 00:06:18.463
which is then trying to get
more properties off of that.

102
00:06:18.463 --> 00:06:21.835
So all of our lists exist,
you can see that they're the right lists.

103
00:06:21.835 --> 00:06:24.826
Because if we look, we have the IDs
list just has the array IDs,

104
00:06:24.826 --> 00:06:27.209
it's creating lists,
it's passing that ID in.

105
00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:31.122
And then Redux is doing all the work
to find out the data from that list.

106
00:06:31.122 --> 00:06:34.081
And creating the List singular component,
all right?
