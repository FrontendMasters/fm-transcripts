&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, so your
exercise, we have a card exercise branch

2
00:00:04.034 --> 00:00:08.662
that we'll start where, we just need
to finish wiring this up, right?

3
00:00:08.662 --> 00:00:11.520
Once we wire it up, we can get to
the point where we can create some items.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.097
And once we have that in place,

5
00:00:13.097 --> 00:00:15.834
that is when our user will
begin to change some state.

6
00:00:15.834 --> 00:00:17.810
And since the user can
begin to change state,

7
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.530
we can figure out how to optimize that.

8
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.991
But we just kinda need to
get the rest of it in place.

9
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:26.379
So your mission, your exercise now is
basically take the same concept we did for

10
00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:29.590
getting a list display and
give it a shot with cards.

11
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.885
And then we'll meet back and
we'll take a look at it.

12
00:00:32.885 --> 00:00:36.950
So what we need to do here is very
similar to what we did just previously.

13
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.821
We're gonna need to create a card reducer,
hook it into our combineReducers, this'll

14
00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:44.022
be the first time we actually really
get to truly take combineReducers for

15
00:00:44.022 --> 00:00:44.867
a spin in earnest.

16
00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:48.306
We'll actually see how
that affects our state.

17
00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:52.533
And then we will swap out the card
component with the card container

18
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:56.231
component that will be able to
reach into the Redux state,

19
00:00:56.231 --> 00:01:00.250
grab the data that it needs and
be able to display it on the page.
