00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.600
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
the Redux is really small.

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.330
And we're actually gonna pull
it apart in a second here.

3
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.660
It really only has about five functions,
all right.

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.980
And three of these are kind
of like helpers, right?

5
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.825
Compose is very similar to flow or
pipe from low dash.

6
00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:24.315
It's actually not related to Redux at all.

7
00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.992
It's just a helper that you can use for
things.

8
00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:30.274
combineReducers just lets you take
a big object in your state and

9
00:00:30.274 --> 00:00:31.624
combine it all together.

10
00:00:31.624 --> 00:00:35.670
And bindActionCreators is just another
helper function that you can use, right?

11
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.110
So there's not a lot to Redux, and we'll
actually see it as we play around with it.

12
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.020
So I'm gonna kinda go and we'll do
a little bit of live code together.

13
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.700
So here we've got, I've just pulled
off all these methods off of Redux.

14
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.840
So we can kind of see them all here.

15
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.135
And these are just some kind of
very basic functions, right?

16
00:00:57.135 --> 00:01:00.280
And so
we're gonna see how each of these work.

17
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.550
We'll start by the easiest one,
which is just compose, right?

18
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.520
What compose does is it takes
some number of functions,

19
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.340
right, one or more functions, and
it returns a new function that takes

20
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.330
a value and shoots it through
all of those functions, right?

21
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.810
So let's actually see that in action.

22
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.549
I've got three functions in here.

23
00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.646
We've got makeLouder,
which takes the string and

24
00:01:27.646 --> 00:01:30.606
makes it all uppercase
like you're screaming.

25
00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:34.670
repeatThreeTimes, I think
that's pretty straightforward.

26
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.210
And embolden, which apparently
I found this out just by taking

27
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.293
a string in the console and
seeing what methods were available,

28
00:01:43.293 --> 00:01:47.170
will wrap it in bold tags, right?

29
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.246
And so what we wanna do is create a new
function that we're gonna call it

30
00:01:51.246 --> 00:01:54.578
makeLouder, embold,and repeatThreeTimes,
right?

31
00:01:54.578 --> 00:01:58.130
And we'll use Redux compose to
kind of create that for us.

32
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.150
And we'll see that it's not really, truly
of the five functions that we need to

33
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.821
learn to truly understand Redux,
this one doesn't even really count.

34
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:10.318
But it is super useful, and
we'll use it when composing multiple

35
00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:14.593
middleware into one middleware and
stuff along those lines.

36
00:02:14.593 --> 00:02:22.580
So we'll just say const
makeLouderAndBoldAndRepeatThreeTimes.

37
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.849
It's very clear what this function does,
right?

38
00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.820
And so here, we'll just say compose.

39
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.834
And we'll take those three functions,
we'll say embolden.

40
00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:35.407
We'll say repeatThreeTimes.

41
00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:43.236
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll say makeLouder.

42
00:02:43.236 --> 00:02:45.621
Cool, and we'll grab this function,

43
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:50.700
which I don't feel like retyping cuz every
character I type has a chance for a typo.

44
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.869
And we'll just console log,

45
00:02:58.694 --> 00:03:00.860
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: hello, cool.

46
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.310
And so, you can see that it is all
capitalized, repeated three times, and

47
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.660
wrapped in B tags, which aren't even in
HTML5 or semantically correct anymore.
