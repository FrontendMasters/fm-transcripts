00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.725
&gt;&gt; Steve: Let's actually go
ahead over here and take a look.

2
00:00:04.725 --> 00:00:05.735
Because I just started it up.

3
00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:14.430
&gt;&gt; Steve: Sure.

4
00:00:21.668 --> 00:00:23.440
&gt;&gt; Steve: Module not found, reducers.

5
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.970
Let's see what we got here.

6
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.179
Where would I call the file?

7
00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:31.991
&gt;&gt; Steve: I made that folder, I need
to pull it into the source directory.

8
00:00:34.327 --> 00:00:37.230
&gt;&gt; Steve: That's gonna be true of
the folders that I tried to set up for us.

9
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.025
So I'll pull containers in as well.

10
00:00:42.237 --> 00:00:45.216
&gt;&gt; Steve: And actions,
just pulled up the wrong directory.

11
00:00:49.144 --> 00:00:51.230
&gt;&gt; Steve: So we gotta raise the QI now.

12
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.660
Now, we haven't really done anything here,
but

13
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.450
we can see everything's
kind of like put together.

14
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.790
What I wanna show you real quick is,

15
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.640
there are Redux DevTools
which are pretty wonderful.

16
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.180
If you have a Chrome extension
installed or a Firefox, and

17
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.680
once you have that place, you do need to
tell the Redux DevTools that they exist.

18
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.785
So what we'll do is we
will go into our index.js.

19
00:01:20.782 --> 00:01:25.407
&gt;&gt; Steve: And [BLANK-AUDIO] we can
pass it as we create the story,

20
00:01:25.407 --> 00:01:29.210
we can basically hook it
up into those DevTools.

21
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.567
Now, it's got a intentionally
terrible name.

22
00:01:35.452 --> 00:01:40.765
&gt;&gt; Steve: REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXENSION.

23
00:01:43.388 --> 00:01:45.180
&gt;&gt; Steve: So
we'll check to see if it's on a window.

24
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.520
You could also do if
environment is development and

25
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.333
do this as well if you wanna make
sure that no one can see it.

26
00:01:56.184 --> 00:01:59.080
&gt;&gt; Steve: So we'll see if this is
available on the window object.

27
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.066
And if so, we'll go ahead,
and we'll call it.

28
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.112
&gt;&gt; Steve: And
what this does is allows us to go in,

29
00:02:10.534 --> 00:02:11.829
&gt;&gt; Steve: These Redux tools.

30
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.590
And you can see, effectively
every action that comes through,

31
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.530
we were cancel logging this
in the very beginning.

32
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.810
We can see every action
that comes through,

33
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.670
the current state of our application,
so you can see those lists there.

34
00:02:25.548 --> 00:02:28.478
Differences between after
an action has happened.

35
00:02:28.478 --> 00:02:31.111
And you can see that there's
a rewind button, where you can like,

36
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:33.766
kind of as things happen in your
application, go through and see.

37
00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:37.273
So as if really great about seeing the
kind of state of our state, if you will.
