00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.480
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So let's look at
the data structure that we use.

2
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.730
This will involve a lot of the kinda
more complicated things that we saw

3
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.800
on the prequel, and make it so
we can more easily modify it.

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.650
So what we're gonna do is, let's get
some of this kinda up and running, and

5
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.340
wired up.

6
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.920
We're going to start by implementing
the ability to get all of the lists,

7
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.792
and the ability to kind of
create a new one, right?

8
00:00:24.792 --> 00:00:32.240
And then I'll give you a chance to then
implement the cards along the way, great.

9
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.130
So we look at the kind of
structure of our application,

10
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.920
I've made some new folders in here.

11
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.670
We've got actions, we've got card-actions,
list-actions, and user-actions.

12
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.980
We've got containers,
which we haven't made any of yet.

13
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.698
And we've got these reducers,
which is card-reducer, list-reducer,

14
00:00:50.698 --> 00:00:54.321
and user-reducer, and
there's gonna be an index.js.

15
00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:58.391
index.js is we're gonna put
our combined reducers, right,

16
00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:01.786
which we'll actually set
up in Redux at this point.

17
00:01:01.786 --> 00:01:05.568
So let's go ahead and
let's start with the list-reducer.

18
00:01:14.318 --> 00:01:15.274
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, and then here,

19
00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:17.156
we're just going to do a very
simple version of this.

20
00:01:17.156 --> 00:01:19.010
We'll import,

21
00:01:29.187 --> 00:01:30.320
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I believe
that's up a level.

22
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.424
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool.

23
00:01:36.707 --> 00:01:38.408
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And our list-reducer,

24
00:01:46.568 --> 00:01:48.020
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll actually call it,

25
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.056
just to make it clear, we'll call it
the defaultLists that we bring in.

26
00:01:52.056 --> 00:01:53.603
And we'll call it lists
inside the function,

27
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.433
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, and

28
00:01:56.433 --> 00:02:03.073
right now we'll just console.log,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The lists and

29
00:02:03.073 --> 00:02:05.640
the action, and
then we'll make sure we turn that list.

30
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.430
In the previous example,

31
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.720
I called this state,
we're gonna call it lists at this point.

32
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.343
Cuz that way, we know what we're working
with, it's just a little bit more clearer.

33
00:02:12.343 --> 00:02:19.318
But it's the same object,
it was state previously,

34
00:02:19.318 --> 00:02:27.384
we know in the list-reducer
that we're dealing with lists.

35
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.707
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, now we need to
combine it, and you might be like,

36
00:02:30.707 --> 00:02:31.890
combine it with what?

37
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.949
We're gonna add cards and users, but

38
00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:38.527
we're gonna combine it with just itself
right now, it'll be a combined set of one.

39
00:02:38.527 --> 00:02:45.052
So in here we'll do import,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: combineReducers

40
00:02:45.052 --> 00:02:47.233
from 'redux'.

41
00:02:49.742 --> 00:02:51.351
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll
import that list-reducer,

42
00:02:53.758 --> 00:02:54.375
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm just gonna

43
00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:54.993
call it lists.

44
00:03:00.402 --> 00:03:06.116
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll then,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: export

45
00:03:06.116 --> 00:03:10.940
default combineReducers with the lists.

46
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.555
So this is gonna give us one store.

47
00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:17.945
Immediately, it's gonna have
a key called lists, and

48
00:03:17.945 --> 00:03:20.551
that's gonna be all of our lists, right?

49
00:03:20.551 --> 00:03:24.451
And so when we eventually add users and
cards, and so

50
00:03:24.451 --> 00:03:29.326
we'll have a tree where there's
a branch for lists, a branch for

51
00:03:29.326 --> 00:03:32.894
cards, a branch for
users, we're good to go.

52
00:03:32.894 --> 00:03:39.506
So we've got that combined reducer,
let's wire it up to a React application.

53
00:03:39.506 --> 00:03:46.008
So we'll go up into our index.js,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,

54
00:03:46.008 --> 00:03:50.288
right now,
it doesn't know anything about Redux, so

55
00:03:50.288 --> 00:03:59.644
I'll import createStore,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: From redux,

56
00:03:59.644 --> 00:04:01.423
we'll import that provider.

57
00:04:01.423 --> 00:04:05.104
We don't need to import connect, cuz
we're gonna do that in the containers, so

58
00:04:05.104 --> 00:04:06.848
we're gonna make it separate files.

59
00:04:06.848 --> 00:04:11.186
Provider from 'react-redux', right,

60
00:04:11.186 --> 00:04:14.596
and we need to import our reducer.

61
00:04:14.596 --> 00:04:18.921
I'm gonna call it the rootReducer cuz
it's the combined list, cards, and users.

62
00:04:25.225 --> 00:04:27.804
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, so
we've got the ability to create a store,

63
00:04:27.804 --> 00:04:31.220
the ability to pass it to React,
we pulled in our reducer.

64
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.485
That's about everything
we need at this point.

65
00:04:33.485 --> 00:04:38.459
We'll do, as I'll say, const store,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Is

66
00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:42.939
based on this rootReducer, right, so now
we don't really have to touch this again.

67
00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:48.877
As we add the cards and the users reducer,
it's all gonna be combined for us.

68
00:04:48.877 --> 00:04:53.011
And finally, it's angry about this,
pull that up.

69
00:04:54.918 --> 00:04:55.930
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, and so

70
00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.243
we'll say Provider,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Put

71
00:05:01.243 --> 00:05:02.691
that around the application.

72
00:05:06.495 --> 00:05:13.008
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: store is our
store that we just made, great.
