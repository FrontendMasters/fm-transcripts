00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.880
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: But first, I'm gonna have
you kind of get your hands dirty, and

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.990
you're gonna implement
the ability to decriment.

3
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.635
Which is again you're gonna make create
a just kind of give you a tour of what's

4
00:00:11.635 --> 00:00:17.280
gonna happen, need to happen here
is in our map dispatched to props.

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.820
We're going to need another method.

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.750
Right?

7
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.500
We're gonna need another action creator.

8
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.760
And then we're gonna need
to add it to the reducer.

9
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.620
I'm gonna push this up as
a decrement exercise branch,

10
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.640
that you can be able to pull down and
kinda start from where I left off.

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.850
Let's implement decrement, right?

12
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.760
Tough to say.

13
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.320
Let's try it out.

14
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.550
So like we said before,
the few things we need to do,

15
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.380
I'll make another like action type.

16
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.150
Again, this is optional, but recommended.

17
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.960
We'll create the action creator,
optional, but highly recommended.

18
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.990
The parts that are not optional is
putting the logic and our reducer.

19
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.570
Right.
And

20
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.509
then passing the ability to dispatch the
action to a reducer, to a react component.

21
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.610
So let's do this.

22
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.390
Say, const decrement.

23
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.330
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool.

24
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.040
And then we'll make another one,
const decrement value.

25
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.310
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Just type decrement.

26
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.610
All right, so we've got,
we're halfway there.

27
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.260
This is noncontroversial here.

28
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.830
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll switch
this to decrement, nice.

29
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.870
Other thing about making the constants
is you get autocomplete.

30
00:01:40.743 --> 00:01:42.265
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And we'll subtract one.

31
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.190
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Finally,
we need to hook it up to our component.

32
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.010
So it needs to go into the mass dispatch
to props, which is where it take that

33
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.380
action creator, we're gonna figure out how
to pass as a prop to the react component.

34
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.079
And then once the react component has it,
we'll just add it to it on click.

35
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.070
All right, so let's go ahead and
we'll start by adding it here.

36
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.830
We're gonna refactor this a little
bit because this seems like,

37
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.010
one of my general rules is if it
feels bad, it probably is bad.

38
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.990
And this feels like a little bit much, so.

39
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.470
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Decrement value.

40
00:02:30.278 --> 00:02:32.250
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
then we'll go up to the props.

41
00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:48.430
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
we'll decrement it, sweet.

42
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.255
Let's just go verify that I haven't made
some terrible mistake as I was typing.

43
00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.290
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right.

44
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.970
It goes up, it goes down.

45
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.980
Let's refactor this a little bit.

46
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.660
Some of this is both for your convenience
and the other like will actually

47
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.860
help you a little bit with
some minor performance issues.

48
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.230
Some app, dispatch to pops can take
a function where it will pass in dispatch.

49
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.360
Right, but doing this for every single
one of them is kind of obnoxious.

50
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.960
Right?

51
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.810
If only we had a way to bind

52
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.710
the action creators to the dispatch.

53
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.070
Well, let's move along.

54
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.220
Well, turns out we do.

55
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.970
So yeah, you saw we implemented
our own bind action creators.

56
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.850
We are able to use and that's why
we could use something like this.

57
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.790
Where we said like,
I'm not gonna bother you with the input.

58
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.425
Our part is,
cuz I yelled at for leaving it.

59
00:03:49.425 --> 00:03:57.930
bindActionCreators, which will take then
increment value and decrement value.

60
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.450
And we can bind it to that dispatch so
we get passed in.

61
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.600
This will work.

62
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.900
The only change is these will get, these
props will get passed in as increment

63
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.550
value and decriment value
instead of increment detriment.

64
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.710
I named them differently cuz I
didn't want to confuse us, but

65
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.650
now it's going to be a problem.

66
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:19.150
So let's actually rename them.

67
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.240
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll
call this one increment.

68
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.220
And we'll go find this one here.

69
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.160
I'll call it decrement.

70
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.110
And now they'll be passed
in the exact same way.

71
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.370
But, you're like, well,
yeah, that's better.

72
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.480
But it also feels like, really,
I had to get that dispatch,

73
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.900
call this other thing and
bind the action crators.

74
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.090
Turns out,
in modern versions of react Redux,

75
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.930
you can actually just take this object,
not use a function and

76
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.160
just use the object like that, right?

77
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.010
Now, I mean theoretically,
since this is just an object,

78
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.510
you can even not store in a variable or
a constant called mapDispatchToProps,

79
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.860
you could literally just
paste it in right here.

80
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.090
And it will basically take those action
creators, will automatically bind them

81
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.080
to the store's dispatch method,
and handle all of it for you.

82
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.485
Let's verify that I haven't
made a terrible mistake.

83
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.625
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You see
everything's still works except for

84
00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:31.040
that I have imported I'm never using it.

85
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.820
But yeah.

86
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.530
So like, if you can get away with it,

87
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.100
if you do not need to take other data and
pass it in,

88
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.720
I would totally recommend doing this, cuz
these are referentially the same, right?.

89
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.840
If we think about when before when we
had that dispatch function which was

90
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.990
returning a new object every time, right?.

91
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.540
The new object, when react it gets,
this is a different set of functions.

92
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.290
We're defining those functions every
single time, this is all new, right?

93
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.630
This is, hey, I've seen these
functions before, cool, right?

94
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.750
And so not only is this cleaner for
us, it is cleaner for React.

95
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.970
Everyone wins,
when you can get away with it, right?

96
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.850
If you don't need to do other stuff.

97
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.580
Just take the functions as they are.
