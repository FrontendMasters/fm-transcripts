00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
I wanna show just kind of some of those

2
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.742
abstractions in action.

3
00:00:03.742 --> 00:00:06.340
I created just a quick utilities file,

4
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.870
which is taking all the parts that could
change in that set function, right?

5
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.300
Again, okay, what is the thing
that we're trying to set, right?

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.050
What is the property we need to go find?

7
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.468
And then what is the new
value of that property?

8
00:00:20.468 --> 00:00:22.976
So pipe is exactly same as redux.compose.

9
00:00:22.976 --> 00:00:27.553
In fact, I could've used redux.compose,
I just used another Lodash one.

10
00:00:27.553 --> 00:00:30.952
We know that they all have entities.

11
00:00:30.952 --> 00:00:32.285
And we know theyhave ids.

12
00:00:32.285 --> 00:00:36.605
So creating a new card, or creating a new
list involves putting that data onto

13
00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:39.674
the entities And
also adding the ID to the array of IDs.

14
00:00:39.674 --> 00:00:43.128
So now I can say add entity and
this will do it both places.

15
00:00:43.128 --> 00:00:45.122
I never think about
that abstraction again.

16
00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:48.832
I just say, all right, what state are we
using, what's the thing I want to put on,

17
00:00:48.832 --> 00:00:49.736
and what's the ID?

18
00:00:49.736 --> 00:00:56.630
And then basically solely for adding cards
to a list, I also have addIdToChildren.

19
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.160
Which is figuring,
it just does the same thing

20
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.810
we just implemented with adding
that card ID to list card array.

21
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.432
So now, if I go in here,
I can effectively just say, all right,

22
00:01:09.432 --> 00:01:16.640
if card create, addEntity to all of your
cards, this new card at the cardId, right.

23
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.404
If I go into listsReducer,

24
00:01:18.404 --> 00:01:22.249
these become one liners that
I can use both places, right.

25
00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:25.415
And so like that squirrelyness that we
saw that was a little bit confusing with

26
00:01:25.415 --> 00:01:26.301
setting that state.

27
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:28.737
I just have some helpers that I can use.

28
00:01:28.737 --> 00:01:33.220
There is a refactor that we can do and
that we should do.

29
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.630
And that is, if you remember
that create card container,

30
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.527
I made this big stink before about
how if we can just use an object for

31
00:01:40.527 --> 00:01:43.680
mapDispatchToProps that we
should totally do that.

32
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.599
And I made a big stink before about
like using strings everywhere.

33
00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:49.783
It's just asking yourself for
a typo to waste a morning of yours.

34
00:01:49.783 --> 00:01:51.961
Right, or worse,
it's like four o'clock and

35
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:55.719
you really just want to ship that thing
because the sprint ends tomorrow, right,

36
00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.910
and that's what I make
my stupidest mistakes.

37
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.510
Let's go ahead and
let's separate out the actions.

38
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.120
So I've got right now this
idea of card actions.

39
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.004
And I'm just going to, again,
the layout is all up to you.

40
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:13.622
But what I'll do is I'll
say const CREATE_CARD.

41
00:02:13.622 --> 00:02:16.256
And you can use ES6
symbols if you want to.

42
00:02:16.256 --> 00:02:17.226
I don't.

43
00:02:17.226 --> 00:02:22.532
I always think about it and
then I decide like, not today.

44
00:02:22.532 --> 00:02:27.460
And then what am I doing here
is kind of take the things

45
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.276
that I need out of that
function from card actions,

46
00:02:32.276 --> 00:02:35.531
or from the mapDispatchToProps.

47
00:02:35.531 --> 00:02:37.668
Create card container.

48
00:02:37.668 --> 00:02:41.110
And I'll take this.

49
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.536
And I'm going to pull it all out.

50
00:02:44.536 --> 00:02:46.070
Remember I said before.

51
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.060
Hey, you can totally use own props.

52
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.790
And I was like, you shouldn't.

53
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.645
And y'all just nodded and it was cool.

54
00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:55.232
You're like,
he must know what he's talking about.

55
00:02:55.232 --> 00:02:57.110
They let him sit up here.

56
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.240
Like, if you used the own props and
you have to do it in this function, right.

57
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.820
But in our component,
we let react hand us the list ID.

58
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.070
Right, we passed it through React,

59
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.250
which means that the function is
getting the list ID and the card data.

60
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.270
It doesn't need anything separate.

61
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.480
Which allows us to take this code and
do my favorite thing in the world,

62
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.120
which is copy paste.

63
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.220
But copy paste is only good if
it's followed by deleting, right.

64
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.550
You could argue, can't you just cut?

65
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.548
I don't need to hear it.

66
00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:34.156
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
we'll say export const createCard.

67
00:03:34.156 --> 00:03:38.130
So = just make this a function.

68
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.669
I need to get that default card data.

69
00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:44.529
We're gonna see a otherwise too

70
00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:49.755
big container get nice and small.

71
00:03:49.755 --> 00:03:51.860
Bring that here as well,
cuz it's just a thing that we need.

72
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.070
And then instead of dispatching,
because we don't have access to dispatch,

73
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.080
we'll just take this object and return it.

74
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.495
Now, remember, I said before, it's,

75
00:04:04.495 --> 00:04:10.710
React-Redux has a way to automatically
bind your action creators with dispatch.

76
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.825
So that's why we don't
need to worry about it.

77
00:04:11.825 --> 00:04:15.576
We just need to return the correct thing.

78
00:04:15.576 --> 00:04:18.260
And we'll go ahead and go back here.

79
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.110
Are you ready for it?

80
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.943
We will just do some deleting.

81
00:04:31.068 --> 00:04:31.568
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That feels good.

82
00:04:39.222 --> 00:04:43.498
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Actually,
I think I can do this auto import, cool.

83
00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:48.820
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Okay, so
I write it, createCard.

84
00:04:52.845 --> 00:04:54.195
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Look at that.

85
00:04:54.195 --> 00:04:55.679
I could even not store it in a variable.

86
00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:56.499
I could, watch this.

87
00:05:03.467 --> 00:05:05.905
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.

88
00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:09.690
Future me when I come across this
container is going to be pleased with

89
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.223
past me.

90
00:05:10.223 --> 00:05:14.804
Right, and future me is the most
important engineer that I know.

91
00:05:19.328 --> 00:05:22.626
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, and
we're adding it to the page.

92
00:05:22.626 --> 00:05:26.354
Great.

93
00:05:26.354 --> 00:05:33.380
All right, so we can assume that
adding users is not dissimilar.

94
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.640
So we'll kind of pull that out.

95
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.060
And what I want to talk about is, we have
one giant object that we're replacing.

96
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.980
Right, that doesn't mean that we
necessarily want to rerender stuff.

97
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.440
So we'll kind of go and
visit that in a moment.

98
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.530
I'm going to come right back
with another branch for us.
