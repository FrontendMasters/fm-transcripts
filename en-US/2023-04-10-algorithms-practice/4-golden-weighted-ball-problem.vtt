1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.328
I wanted to give you a visualization
of thinking through these

2
00:00:05.328 --> 00:00:10.154
different mechanisms,
these different techniques.

3
00:00:10.154 --> 00:00:14.410
There's a logic problem that I
was presented in a job interview

4
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.426
20-something years ago.

5
00:00:16.426 --> 00:00:18.721
And I, after being presented this,

6
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:23.089
almost immediately started using it
myself when I gave job interviews

7
00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.470
because I just loved the idea of this
problem and what it illustrates.

8
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.322
And so some of you may have heard it.

9
00:00:29.322 --> 00:00:34.330
Some of you may have never, it's
the problem of the eight golden spheres.

10
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.488
And we have eight golden spheres here and
we have a traditional balance scale,

11
00:00:38.488 --> 00:00:41.701
meaning that it is only balanced
when the weight on both sides

12
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:42.910
of the scale is equal.

13
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.994
What we're told about these golden spheres
is that they are identical in texture,

14
00:00:49.994 --> 00:00:55.370
size, shape, color, everything,
except one of the eight.

15
00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.500
We don't know which is imperceptibly
lighter than the other seven.

16
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.957
That's the only thing that
we know about the problem.

17
00:01:03.957 --> 00:01:08.907
We know that one of them weighs a little
bit less not enough that you could hold it

18
00:01:08.907 --> 00:01:10.345
in your hand and tell?

19
00:01:10.345 --> 00:01:13.533
But we know that one of them is less
than the problem is how do we find it?

20
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:14.716
How do we find the odd one out?

21
00:01:14.716 --> 00:01:17.591
How do we find the lighter one?

22
00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:20.760
There are multiple ways
to solve this problem.

23
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.691
But when presented in a job interview,
what they're kind of looking for

24
00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:27.408
is like how do you translate
a real world problem?

25
00:01:27.408 --> 00:01:32.283
Into an algorithm, into data structure and
algorithm approaches.

26
00:01:32.283 --> 00:01:35.658
So rather than put you on the spot,
some of you are still working through your

27
00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:37.939
first cup of coffee rather
than put you on the spot.

28
00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.855
I'm gonna walk you through three
different ways to solve this problem.

29
00:01:40.855 --> 00:01:43.044
We get three different answers to it.

30
00:01:43.044 --> 00:01:47.679
But the basic setup is how do
I use this balance scale to

31
00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.530
guarantee in the worst case
that I find the odd ball out.

32
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.686
And what's the minimum,

33
00:01:54.686 --> 00:01:59.693
worst case number of usages of
the balance scale to get that?

34
00:01:59.693 --> 00:02:04.468
So perhaps some of you
are thinking right off the bat,

35
00:02:04.468 --> 00:02:09.575
I'll stick one ball on either
side of the balance scale.

36
00:02:09.575 --> 00:02:11.016
And if they're equal,

37
00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:15.565
then I've eliminated those two because
neither one of them can be the one.

38
00:02:15.565 --> 00:02:18.070
If they're unequal, then I immediately
know which one was lighter.

39
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.310
It's the one that went up.

40
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.409
In the worst case, they were equal,
so I need to go on to two more.

41
00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.441
And in the worst case, those were
also equal, so I go on to two more.

42
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:30.810
And in the worst case,
I've eliminated six now.

43
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.880
Have used the balance scale three times.

44
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.823
And on this final fourth time,

45
00:02:34.823 --> 00:02:38.120
I'm guaranteed to know
which one was the lightest.

46
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.820
So in the worst case,
we used it four times.

47
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.540
And this is an iterative
approach to the problem.

48
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.760
We took two elements, we compared them.

49
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.255
We kept going until we had gone
potentially worst case through

50
00:02:49.255 --> 00:02:50.470
the entire data set.

51
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.793
And we have guaranteed ourselves that we
found it similar to a search algorithm,

52
00:02:55.793 --> 00:03:00.900
iteratively going through this is
effectively a search algorithm, right.

53
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.650
So a lot of times in a job interview,
somebody says, 4, that's the answer.

54
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.262
That's the minimum number of usages.

55
00:03:08.262 --> 00:03:11.160
And the interviewer might nod and
say, that's a good answer.

56
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.000
But if I told you that there's a way to do
it in fewer usages, how would you do that?

57
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.380
Okay, so
let's flip the script around a little bit.

58
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.133
Instead of starting with one on each side,

59
00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:23.990
let's start with more
than one on each side.

60
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.590
In fact,
let's start with four on each one.

61
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.910
Right, we've got eight balls.

62
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.719
Let's divide it in half.

63
00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.820
We'll put four on one side,
four on the other side.

64
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.578
Now, what this usage of the scale
is gonna tell me is that I know

65
00:03:38.578 --> 00:03:41.609
that the lighter one is in a set of four.

66
00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.920
It's on one side of the other.

67
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.120
But I don't yet know which one it is.

68
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.935
I've just narrowed my problem down.

69
00:03:47.935 --> 00:03:49.335
You follow me?

70
00:03:49.335 --> 00:03:53.155
So let's say it was the left
hand side that was lighter,

71
00:03:53.155 --> 00:03:57.890
then we take those four and we split
them in half and we put two and two.

72
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.648
Now I've eliminated two more,
I've eliminated a total of six,

73
00:04:01.648 --> 00:04:03.912
I'm left with only two balls for sure.

74
00:04:03.912 --> 00:04:07.573
I know it's one of those two,
I put them on the scale a final time.

75
00:04:07.573 --> 00:04:12.077
Now I've used the scale three times and
this is the binary search,

76
00:04:12.077 --> 00:04:14.980
it's recursive solution to the problem.

77
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.117
So when you're on a job interview and
somebody's asked you this, and

78
00:04:18.117 --> 00:04:20.206
you might jump immediately
to the recursive.

79
00:04:20.206 --> 00:04:22.492
But many people jump first
to the iterative, and

80
00:04:22.492 --> 00:04:25.300
then they realize,
I could have done it recursively.

81
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.731
And so they got it down
from four usages to three.

82
00:04:28.731 --> 00:04:31.882
We have a more optimal algorithm.

83
00:04:31.882 --> 00:04:36.108
But then the interviewer gets a little
glimmer in their eye and he says,

84
00:04:36.108 --> 00:04:39.429
what if I can tell you that it
can be done in fewer usages?

85
00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:41.118
How would you do it in fewer?

86
00:04:41.118 --> 00:04:45.509
We went from one and one all the way to
the other side doing it in four and four.

87
00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:46.070
We can't do more than that.

88
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.723
We can't do like eight and eight,
cuz there's only eight total.

89
00:04:49.723 --> 00:04:54.575
So by process of what we call discrete
math, there's only two other choices,

90
00:04:54.575 --> 00:04:55.096
right?

91
00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:57.008
We can't put an uneven number
of balls in the scale.

92
00:04:57.008 --> 00:04:59.739
That's not gonna tell us anything,
they have to be even so

93
00:04:59.739 --> 00:05:03.329
we can either put two and two and you
could run through that mental exercise.

94
00:05:03.329 --> 00:05:07.946
I didn't create that as a slide but
you could either put two and two or

95
00:05:07.946 --> 00:05:11.522
you could put 3 and 3 so,
let's just try 3 and 3.

96
00:05:11.522 --> 00:05:13.125
We're gonna put three on either side.

97
00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:14.140
Now, what's gonna happen?

98
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.489
There's two possible outcomes, either
we're going to see the balance scale

99
00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:24.445
completely balanced, which means we
have eliminated six of our balls.

100
00:05:24.445 --> 00:05:26.945
And in that case, we only have two left,

101
00:05:26.945 --> 00:05:31.300
we only need to use the scale one more
time to identify the odd ball out.

102
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.915
You follow me?

103
00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:38.950
But what if one side is uneven?

104
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.768
How many have we eliminated in that case?

105
00:05:41.768 --> 00:05:43.280
Let me see if you're awake.

106
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.203
If we put three and three on there and
the scale is not balanced,

107
00:05:47.203 --> 00:05:50.250
how many balls have we
eliminated by that usage?

108
00:05:53.862 --> 00:05:54.662
Five, good.

109
00:05:54.662 --> 00:05:57.580
Five because we have the three
that we know are heavier.

110
00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.632
And the other two that we didn't even try,
we know that they're not it.

111
00:06:02.632 --> 00:06:06.675
We know that the problem ball, or
the odd ball is in this set of three.

112
00:06:06.675 --> 00:06:08.130
But that's not an even number.

113
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.635
How are we gonna use the scale?

114
00:06:10.635 --> 00:06:12.753
Well, we've used it once.

115
00:06:12.753 --> 00:06:15.830
And now we've narrowed our
problem down to three.

116
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.183
Now you simply pick any two and
weigh them.

117
00:06:20.183 --> 00:06:24.640
If they are even, you know by process of
elimination it's the one you didn't try.

118
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.750
If they're uneven,
you know that it's the one that's lighter.

119
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.231
So in the worst case scenario,
we only had to use the scale twice.

120
00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:38.016
So what is this algorithm called I
call it the fuzzy search algorithm I

121
00:06:38.016 --> 00:06:43.062
don't know but can you see how we
thought a little bit outside of the box.

122
00:06:43.062 --> 00:06:48.753
We asked something more of our
problem which is it definitely

123
00:06:48.753 --> 00:06:53.783
true that I can only use
the scale with an even number.

124
00:06:53.783 --> 00:06:58.766
We understood something about the nature
of, again, what we call discrete math.

125
00:06:58.766 --> 00:07:01.042
You can't divide the balls, so

126
00:07:01.042 --> 00:07:06.365
we only have a fixed number of possible
balls to ever put into this problem.

127
00:07:06.365 --> 00:07:09.415
Now let us know that we have one on
either side, two on either side,

128
00:07:09.415 --> 00:07:11.546
three on either side,
or four on either side.

129
00:07:11.546 --> 00:07:15.006
That's our fixed problem space.

130
00:07:15.006 --> 00:07:17.705
So we could examine that in both cases.

131
00:07:17.705 --> 00:07:21.048
A lot of times when somebody's
faced with this on a job interview,

132
00:07:21.048 --> 00:07:23.746
they kind of tense up and
get a little bit frustrated.

133
00:07:23.746 --> 00:07:26.103
And something as basic as that,

134
00:07:26.103 --> 00:07:29.783
all you have to do is try
the four possible things.

135
00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:32.237
You don't have to solve for
millions of possible combinations.

136
00:07:32.237 --> 00:07:34.760
There's only four possible.

137
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.254
If you have a computer science background,
that immediately jumps out to you as

138
00:07:38.254 --> 00:07:41.030
a discrete math principle,
similar to the birthday problem.

139
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:46.835
If you heard the birthday problem,
which says that if you have 95% or

140
00:07:46.835 --> 00:07:50.330
if you have more than 30 people in a room.

141
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:58.227
There's a 95% chance that at least two
people in the room have the same birthday.

142
00:07:58.227 --> 00:08:00.046
And we actually solved that.

143
00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:01.135
I'm not gonna do it here for you.

144
00:08:01.135 --> 00:08:05.210
But the derivation of that answer
is actually discrete math.

145
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.196
So when you have a more formal background,
some of that might jump out.

146
00:08:09.196 --> 00:08:12.530
But even if you didn't have the formal
computer science background,

147
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.500
you can reason about the idea and ask the
question, am I allowed to divide the ball?

148
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.737
Am I allowed to divide the sphere?

149
00:08:18.737 --> 00:08:22.200
No, okay,
that tells me something pretty important.

150
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.150
What it tells me is that I can only
put even numbers of things on there.

151
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.880
I can't divide the balls into half and
half or whatever,okay?

152
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.625
So asking those questions and
understanding the answers to those

153
00:08:34.625 --> 00:08:39.636
questions will guide us to very
different solutions to the problem.

154
00:08:39.636 --> 00:08:43.648
In this case, four versus three versus
two not a big deal, but the principle

155
00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:47.362
underlying it is the principle that
as an algorithm and the engineer.

156
00:08:47.362 --> 00:08:48.790
We need to get comfortable with.
