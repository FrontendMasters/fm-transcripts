00:00:00.091 --> 00:00:03.871
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
we're on to our media queries, and

2
00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:09.305
one of the things is that when
these images are so nice,

3
00:00:09.305 --> 00:00:16.770
and they look really bad when we are at
750 pixels, when they get small.

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.100
So just to show you
what I'm talking about,

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.140
what I'm just gonna do here inside
of my 750 pixel media query,

6
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.568
let me just show you
what I'm talking about.

7
00:00:28.568 --> 00:00:34.376
So if I say, project and I say,

8
00:00:34.376 --> 00:00:39.516
grid template-columns,

9
00:00:39.516 --> 00:00:45.326
1fr 1fr, and I have my screen

10
00:00:45.326 --> 00:00:50.250
at 750 pixels, okay?

11
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.273
You'll see how small that image is,

12
00:00:53.273 --> 00:00:57.672
I actually like the way that
image looks here better.

13
00:00:57.672 --> 00:01:01.265
The images are really important
to this portfolio, and

14
00:01:01.265 --> 00:01:04.024
I actually wanna keep them big for longer.

15
00:01:04.024 --> 00:01:08.867
So one of the things that
I'm going to do here is,

16
00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:14.893
write a different media query just for
the project section,

17
00:01:14.893 --> 00:01:19.045
@media, min-width, 850 pixels.

18
00:01:22.526 --> 00:01:23.133
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

19
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:27.992
So now this image isn't
going to go to its smaller

20
00:01:27.992 --> 00:01:32.626
side by side until I hit 850 pixels, okay?

21
00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:36.567
So the the point of telling you
all of this is the following.

22
00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:41.273
Just because you have
a breakpoint at 750 pixels,

23
00:01:41.273 --> 00:01:46.816
does not mean that that is
necessarily the right break point for

24
00:01:46.816 --> 00:01:49.337
everything in your design.

25
00:01:49.337 --> 00:01:52.999
You are totally allowed to have
different break points for

26
00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.971
different elements and
images that are there on your Webpage.

27
00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:58.833
There's nothing wrong with that at all,

28
00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:01.759
it doesn't actually cost you
anything in terms of performance,

29
00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.650
media queries are really very
trivial in terms of performance.

30
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.101
And if the design is better,
why not do it?

31
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:12.115
So that's what we're going to do here.

32
00:02:12.115 --> 00:02:17.478
And I will show you the rest
of the things that we're

33
00:02:17.478 --> 00:02:23.114
going to put in here,
in my 850 pixel media query.

34
00:02:23.114 --> 00:02:29.600
We'll need to make sure that
our text is aligned left,

35
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.699
we'll put that in our main style.

36
00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:38.845
And let's see, what did I do for

37
00:02:38.845 --> 00:02:43.425
my project, style before?

38
00:02:43.425 --> 00:02:47.788
My project style before
had a gap of three realm,

39
00:02:47.788 --> 00:02:53.016
I'm gonna keep that,
I'm not gonna change that, okay?

40
00:02:53.016 --> 00:03:00.658
Then I'm going to add .project img.

41
00:03:00.658 --> 00:03:06.579
And I'm going to say, grid-row auto,
so that'll flip these back around,

42
00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:11.770
so that the image will wind up on
the right side, which is where we had

43
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.629
it in our original design here, so
they're now next to each other, right?

44
00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.975
It doesn't take us a whole lot of
code in order to get what we want.

45
00:03:21.975 --> 00:03:27.008
Now, the last part of this is,
these images down here, or,

46
00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:32.955
sorry, these tags down here on
the bottom that show us our technology.

47
00:03:32.955 --> 00:03:37.177
Right now those are aligned in the center,
so

48
00:03:37.177 --> 00:03:42.174
we'll want to align them to
the left side of the page,

49
00:03:42.174 --> 00:03:45.618
so this is gonna be .project ul, and

50
00:03:45.618 --> 00:03:50.641
we're gonna say,
justify content, flex-start.

51
00:03:50.641 --> 00:03:55.479
And that should push these over to
the left side of the page, okay?

52
00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:59.393
And then, as you make your screen bigger,

53
00:03:59.393 --> 00:04:03.870
those will flatten out into a single row,
okay?

54
00:04:08.046 --> 00:04:12.513
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And that's what it
will look like there on desktop,

55
00:04:12.513 --> 00:04:14.957
pretty good, yeah, yeah.

56
00:04:14.957 --> 00:04:17.540
And then when we go back
to a smaller screen size,

57
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.745
then they'll stack on top of each other.
