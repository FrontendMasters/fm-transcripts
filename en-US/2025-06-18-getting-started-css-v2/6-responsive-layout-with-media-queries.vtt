00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.147
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now that we have our mobile
layout complete for the bio section of our

2
00:00:04.147 --> 00:00:08.676
website, let's add a media query and
make this work better for desktop.

3
00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:11.522
So how many media queries do you need?

4
00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:12.823
Anybody have any idea?

5
00:00:12.823 --> 00:00:17.372
How many media queries should we add?

6
00:00:17.372 --> 00:00:18.556
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Maybe one for now.

7
00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:19.621
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: One for now?

8
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:22.756
Sure, we'll add one for
now, the right answer is,

9
00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:26.187
however many media queries it
takes to make it look good.

10
00:00:26.187 --> 00:00:29.972
Your graphic designer is probably going
to tell you exactly how many that is.

11
00:00:29.972 --> 00:00:34.808
They may be in different places, but in
this particular case, we're gonna put in

12
00:00:34.808 --> 00:00:39.872
our media query about 750px, and we're
going to change our layout at that point.

13
00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:44.280
So, I'm currently, once again,
look for the little number down at

14
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.153
the bottom of your screen here in CodePen
to tell you the size of your screen.

15
00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:53.740
And I am going to move mine to
just a little bit more than 750px.

16
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.103
This is your number one trip-up
point as you're working in CodePen.

17
00:00:58.103 --> 00:01:01.801
You start writing code and
it doesn't work.

18
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:06.816
That's because your display window
is smaller than your media query.

19
00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:10.393
Of course, it doesn't work, so
I like to set this first so

20
00:01:10.393 --> 00:01:12.810
that my code will work once I type it in.

21
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.350
And I'm gonna scroll down here to
the bottom and I will add my media query.

22
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.497
And so
my media query is going to be @media and

23
00:01:24.497 --> 00:01:29.645
I'm going to say my min-width is 750px,

24
00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:35.485
minimum width cuz we're
working on mobile first.

25
00:01:35.485 --> 00:01:40.883
So we wanna work with minimum width
media queries, our previous styles,

26
00:01:40.883 --> 00:01:44.989
everything we've written from line 96 and
going up.

27
00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:47.761
All of that will carry
into our media queries,

28
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:49.904
these will just be our overwrites.

29
00:01:49.904 --> 00:01:53.970
So here what I will do is say for
my .wrapper style,

30
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.415
all right, I'd like a little
bit more padding on this,

31
00:01:58.415 --> 00:02:01.934
especially to get it off
the top of the page.

32
00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:06.439
So maybe I'll say padding of 5rem.

33
00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.304
We had 1rem before on mobile so

34
00:02:08.304 --> 00:02:13.399
now I'm gonna give myself a bit more space
cuz I'm on a desktop configuration here,

35
00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.877
and then I'm gonna make some
changes to my main article.

36
00:02:16.877 --> 00:02:21.579
Remember, this is what we're
working with now for our design.

37
00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.540
We need to have how many columns of stuff?

38
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.513
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: 2 hind that.

39
00:02:27.513 --> 00:02:29.177
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now we
need 2 columns of stuff.

40
00:02:29.177 --> 00:02:33.122
So before we had 1 column with
everything stacked on top of each other,

41
00:02:33.122 --> 00:02:34.653
we need to go to 2 columns.

42
00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:38.666
So I'm going to say for my main article,

43
00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:43.397
we are going to go to our
grid template columns.

44
00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:49.047
1fr, 1fr or repeat 2 column 1fr,
however you wanna type it,

45
00:02:49.047 --> 00:02:53.273
this is shorter for
just 2 columns, all right.

46
00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:59.345
And then maybe I will, notice that
these are now top aligned here, okay.

47
00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:04.992
Maybe I want those
aligned on their centers,

48
00:03:04.992 --> 00:03:08.269
so align-items center.

49
00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.858
And then my text, of course,
is center aligned,

50
00:03:13.858 --> 00:03:18.924
so I wanna overwrite that text-align left.

51
00:03:18.924 --> 00:03:23.585
All right, and then for
the image itself looks a little bit odd,

52
00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:25.406
kind of cut off that way.

53
00:03:25.406 --> 00:03:28.205
Let us turn all of the things that

54
00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:32.981
we did to it off in order to
show us the full picture now.

55
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:40.113
So we can make changes
here to .main-article img,

56
00:03:40.113 --> 00:03:46.447
so I'm going to say max-height of 400px.

57
00:03:46.447 --> 00:03:50.110
This will prevent our image
from getting overly large.

58
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.278
So we'll just go by height,
the width will scale proportionately.

59
00:03:55.278 --> 00:04:00.280
For my margin, I wanna push this
all the way over to the right.

60
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.265
So what I can say is 0, 0, 0, auto.

61
00:04:06.265 --> 00:04:12.219
And what this will do,
remember those four numbers are top,

62
00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.034
right, bottom, and left.

63
00:04:15.034 --> 00:04:21.053
So we're gonna have no margin on all
of those until we get to the left side.

64
00:04:21.053 --> 00:04:25.076
The left side is auto that will push
it all the way over to the right.

65
00:04:25.076 --> 00:04:28.231
It won't really show so much at 750px.

66
00:04:28.231 --> 00:04:33.334
As the screen gets bigger, you may
see it push over more to the right.

67
00:04:33.334 --> 00:04:37.863
And again, on your larger screens at home,
as you're following along,

68
00:04:37.863 --> 00:04:42.551
you may see this a bit more dramatically
than we do here on my smaller screen.

69
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:48.476
Okay, and
then to turn off the other things

70
00:04:48.476 --> 00:04:54.070
that we did to this picture, to crop it,

71
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.338
we'll say our object-fit is none and

72
00:04:59.338 --> 00:05:03.799
our object-position is none.

73
00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:10.121
And our height is auto,
and our width is auto,

74
00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:14.836
and our overflow is auto, [LAUGH].

75
00:05:14.836 --> 00:05:19.127
So those are all the ways that you turn
off all of the things that you set before

76
00:05:19.127 --> 00:05:21.289
in order to get your basic image back.

77
00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.645
For object-fit and object-position,
they are not auto,

78
00:05:24.645 --> 00:05:26.302
you can go look them up on MDN.

79
00:05:26.302 --> 00:05:31.169
Auto is not a valuable or a valid
value for those particular properties.

80
00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:36.248
You need to use the word none, and
then auto works for everything else.

81
00:05:36.248 --> 00:05:41.050
Notice that you might have a max
height of 400px, but a height of auto,

82
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.614
how do those two things work together?

83
00:05:43.614 --> 00:05:45.284
Anyone have any ideas?

84
00:05:45.284 --> 00:05:47.584
Does that look weird to you?

85
00:05:47.584 --> 00:05:52.025
Okay, so what we're saying is that the
height, it can be automatically adjusting.

86
00:05:52.025 --> 00:05:56.114
All right, especially as we get smaller
and I can't make this much smaller.

87
00:05:56.114 --> 00:06:00.729
You can kind of see she's getting cut off,
like her hands, they are cut off,

88
00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.582
the laptop is cut off, right?

89
00:06:02.582 --> 00:06:06.903
But as the screen gets bigger,
there is a maximum point, and

90
00:06:06.903 --> 00:06:10.650
she doesn't get any bigger after that,
all right.

91
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.329
So that's the point of setting
this up that way, all right, so

92
00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:19.217
she can get proportionately
a little bit smaller and

93
00:06:19.217 --> 00:06:22.415
maybe cut off from
the bottom a little bit.

94
00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:26.523
So that's what that little
bit of code is doing.

95
00:06:26.523 --> 00:06:31.315
All right, and then the last thing that
we need to adjust here are our icons and

96
00:06:31.315 --> 00:06:34.581
currently those are set to
justify content center.

97
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:40.863
So we're going to just change or
justify content to flex-start, and

98
00:06:40.863 --> 00:06:48.008
that should push them over to the left,
and they should be lined up pretty well.

99
00:06:48.008 --> 00:06:52.456
All right, so a couple of other tiny
little things that we can do here.

100
00:06:52.456 --> 00:06:54.777
We're here at the start of my media query.

101
00:06:54.777 --> 00:06:58.328
Currently, my font size is 1rem.

102
00:06:58.328 --> 00:07:03.133
We set that back up at the beginning
of our style sheet up here and

103
00:07:03.133 --> 00:07:08.405
the body style somewhere here in
the beginning to our base font size.

104
00:07:08.405 --> 00:07:10.104
And our font size is 1rem.

105
00:07:10.104 --> 00:07:15.756
I would like my font size to be
generally bigger when I go to desktop.

106
00:07:15.756 --> 00:07:20.616
So here's one of the cool things that
we can do with our variables inside

107
00:07:20.616 --> 00:07:21.836
of a media query.

108
00:07:21.836 --> 00:07:24.930
We don't need to go back and
make our body style.

109
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:25.976
We don't need to do this.

110
00:07:25.976 --> 00:07:31.798
So, now my body style will be font-size,

111
00:07:31.798 --> 00:07:36.990
whatever, we don't need to do this.

112
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:42.779
And what we can do instead is simply say,
root style,

113
00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:48.580
we're going to instead
change our base font-size.

114
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.844
So we're just changing
the value of the variable,

115
00:07:52.844 --> 00:07:58.004
you're probably familiar with this,
to 1.1125rem,

116
00:07:58.004 --> 00:08:02.486
and that should scale
everything proportionately.

117
00:08:02.486 --> 00:08:06.180
So you see how everything on that
page scaled up just a tiny bit.

118
00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.074
The h2 scaled up a little bit,
the h1 scaled up a little bit,

119
00:08:08.074 --> 00:08:09.248
the paragraph scaled up a little bit.

120
00:08:09.248 --> 00:08:13.523
When you go back to your mobile dimension,

121
00:08:13.523 --> 00:08:20.549
everything scales down proportionately
to a slightly smaller size.

122
00:08:20.549 --> 00:08:23.109
How cool is that?

123
00:08:23.109 --> 00:08:27.809
Pretty fun and amazing, right?

124
00:08:27.809 --> 00:08:29.006
Very cool.

125
00:08:29.006 --> 00:08:30.338
Very cool, very cool.

126
00:08:30.338 --> 00:08:35.444
And then the last thing I'm going to do,
because I'm super picky,

127
00:08:35.444 --> 00:08:39.041
is my h1 here.

128
00:08:39.041 --> 00:08:43.387
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so if you take
a look here at the left side of the F in

129
00:08:43.387 --> 00:08:48.077
front going down to the B,
they don't quite line up in a perfectly

130
00:08:48.077 --> 00:08:52.967
straight line and the graphic
designer is screaming at me, right?

131
00:08:52.967 --> 00:08:54.663
We've all been there.

132
00:08:54.663 --> 00:08:57.344
So we can add this here
in our CSS as well.

133
00:08:57.344 --> 00:09:02.416
We could just say our margin-left is -3px,
and

134
00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:08.715
that will pull this over just
the tiniest little bit, [LAUGH].

135
00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:13.080
And now we have a nice
straight left side margin,

136
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.028
and our graphics designer is much happier.
