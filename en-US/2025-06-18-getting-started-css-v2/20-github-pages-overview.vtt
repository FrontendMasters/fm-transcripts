00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.992
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So,
let's talk about the next step.

2
00:00:02.992 --> 00:00:08.140
Once you have all of your website on
the computer that's there in front of you,

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.138
there are aproximately 5 million
different ways to get this up and online.

4
00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:15.286
And some ways are better than others.

5
00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:19.278
So, many of you who are watching
this are already website

6
00:00:19.278 --> 00:00:24.269
professionals You probably already
have all of the things installed on

7
00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.032
the command line in order to
send this on up to GitHub.

8
00:00:28.032 --> 00:00:34.651
And if you have all of that installed,
you should ignore me and just do that.

9
00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:37.927
There's a bunch of other ways that
you can get this stuff online.

10
00:00:37.927 --> 00:00:40.484
For example,
you can use the NetLify service.

11
00:00:40.484 --> 00:00:43.746
They have a whole way of taking
files from your computer and

12
00:00:43.746 --> 00:00:47.356
getting it up on their service and
displaying on their website.

13
00:00:47.356 --> 00:00:50.297
If you prefer that way of doing things,
you should do that.

14
00:00:50.297 --> 00:00:52.803
And by the way,
there are more ways than that.

15
00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:57.795
So all those ways, whatever you like,
go ahead and follow that.

16
00:00:57.795 --> 00:01:02.777
If this is brand new to you though, You've
never done this kind of work before.

17
00:01:02.777 --> 00:01:06.596
I am going to walk you through
how to do this using GitHub,

18
00:01:06.596 --> 00:01:12.180
which is an industry-standard place that
stores your programming and your work.

19
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.332
And we're going to then put
it up on GitHub Pages, and

20
00:01:16.332 --> 00:01:21.057
we're gonna do this using
the GitHub Desktop application.

21
00:01:21.057 --> 00:01:25.761
None of this is pretty standard for
a professional web developer, but

22
00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:28.242
it works great for all the rest of us.

23
00:01:28.242 --> 00:01:32.643
Okay, so you do not have to follow
my instructions on this part.

24
00:01:32.643 --> 00:01:36.744
This is probably one of the easier ways
to get something up online if you do not

25
00:01:36.744 --> 00:01:41.122
have a workflow that you already use to
get your info Information up on a website.

26
00:01:41.122 --> 00:01:45.107
All right, so at this point, then,

27
00:01:45.107 --> 00:01:49.349
if we take a look at my website here, for

28
00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:54.620
the course,
we have done the first part of this,

29
00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.562
which is we've moved this
all from CodePen to VS code.

30
00:02:00.562 --> 00:02:05.213
And then the next things that we're going
to do, I'm going to walk you through

31
00:02:05.213 --> 00:02:09.313
these steps first, just to give you
the overview of how this is done.

32
00:02:09.313 --> 00:02:12.397
So if you don't have an account on
GitHub yet, you can go sign up for one.

33
00:02:12.397 --> 00:02:17.181
They're free, so you'll sign up for
the GitHub account.

34
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:19.613
And while you're there in GitHub.

35
00:02:19.613 --> 00:02:22.308
You're gonna make what's
called a repository.

36
00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:27.064
This is basically a location where you
store code, and this one is going to

37
00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:31.052
have a name, something like your
username dot github dot io,

38
00:02:31.052 --> 00:02:35.828
I am aware that I think GitHub has
changed some of these rules a little bit.

39
00:02:35.828 --> 00:02:39.893
You can make any repository into
the one that displays on GitHub Pages.

40
00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:42.613
But I think this name still works,
because you know what it is.

41
00:02:42.613 --> 00:02:45.820
This is what's going to
display on GitHub pages.

42
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.304
So we're going to walk through
exactly how to do that.

43
00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:53.524
You're going to download Github desktop.

44
00:02:53.524 --> 00:02:56.628
Github desktop is again, a free product.

45
00:02:56.628 --> 00:02:59.166
You just install it on your computer.

46
00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:00.211
We'll configure.

47
00:03:00.211 --> 00:03:05.829
Github desktop to point to that repository
that you just created on GitHub,

48
00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.178
I'll walk you through
all of these screens.

49
00:03:09.178 --> 00:03:14.124
So we set all of that up,we'll
point it to our local

50
00:03:14.124 --> 00:03:19.308
path,and then we are going
to make the magic happen.

51
00:03:19.308 --> 00:03:23.692
Which will transfer the files that are on
the computer in front of you into your

52
00:03:23.692 --> 00:03:28.481
GitHub repo,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And publish it, and

53
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:31.411
then you'll look in your browser window.

54
00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:36.202
Very important, it's gonna take
a few minutes from when you upload

55
00:03:36.202 --> 00:03:39.999
things to GitHub to have
them display in GitHub page.

56
00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:41.742
always a bit of a lag.

57
00:03:41.742 --> 00:03:44.288
It can be up to, like, 15 minutes.

58
00:03:44.288 --> 00:03:49.696
So this is very commonly,
one of the points where students panic.

59
00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:51.050
They've put things up on GitHub.

60
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.778
It doesn't show up on GitHub Pages,

61
00:03:52.778 --> 00:03:56.537
and everybody freaks out because it's
not displaying the way that they think.

62
00:03:56.537 --> 00:03:59.532
You just have to wait,
just chill, give it 15 minutes.

63
00:03:59.532 --> 00:04:02.500
Go have a walk, get a drink of water,
you're going to be fine.

64
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.082
And then take a look, and
you'll see what happens.

65
00:04:06.082 --> 00:04:08.757
And then I've got a couple of tips for

66
00:04:08.757 --> 00:04:14.463
what you might do after that in terms of
making additional changes to the site.

67
00:04:14.463 --> 00:04:21.860
Okay, so that's the broad overview of
about what we're about to walk through.
