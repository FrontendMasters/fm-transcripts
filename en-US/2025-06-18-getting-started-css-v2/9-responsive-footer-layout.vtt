00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.099
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so
that takes care of our layout now for

2
00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:05.862
our mobile display.

3
00:00:05.862 --> 00:00:09.455
Let me make my window bigger,

4
00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:13.778
bigger than 750 pixels, okay?

5
00:00:13.778 --> 00:00:19.303
And now we can add to our media query in
order to change this to make this work for

6
00:00:19.303 --> 00:00:24.829
desktop, so I'm just gonna continue
adding styles down here to the bottom.

7
00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.072
You'll notice that our icon bars
already shifted off to the left,

8
00:00:29.072 --> 00:00:31.951
that's because we have
our icon style here,

9
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:36.224
it says our justify content is
flex start so that's already done.

10
00:00:36.224 --> 00:00:39.114
And then we can go back to footer,

11
00:00:39.114 --> 00:00:44.071
just regular old footer,
we can say text align left, and

12
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:49.151
that will shift everybody off
to the left side of the page.

13
00:00:49.151 --> 00:00:53.650
Then we can say our footer text,
our footer text,

14
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.151
this will be grid,
hyphen, template, hyphen,

15
00:00:58.151 --> 00:01:02.239
columns, and this will be repeat 3, 1FR.

16
00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.045
So that will give us our three

17
00:01:07.045 --> 00:01:12.864
columns here on the page, right?

18
00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:18.818
And then now, for
these icons down here on the bottom,

19
00:01:18.818 --> 00:01:22.194
they are looking good as well.

20
00:01:22.194 --> 00:01:25.602
All right, so everything looks great.

21
00:01:30.663 --> 00:01:32.435
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Looks like a footer there,
looks like a footer there.

22
00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:37.748
Our font size automatically bumps up,
because we already wrote that generically

23
00:01:37.748 --> 00:01:42.915
for the entire page, so we don't have to
write it specifically for the footer.

24
00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:47.627
You'll see that the font size is changing
from teensy tiny to slightly bigger.

25
00:01:47.627 --> 00:01:52.100
Remember, at this dimension,
the desktop dimension,

26
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.145
we changed our value of our
default text size to 1.125 rem.

27
00:01:57.145 --> 00:02:03.084
That'll be multiplied by 0.85, so whatever
math that comes out to be, it'll be

28
00:02:03.084 --> 00:02:08.708
slightly smaller text relative to the rest
of the page when we finish writing it.
