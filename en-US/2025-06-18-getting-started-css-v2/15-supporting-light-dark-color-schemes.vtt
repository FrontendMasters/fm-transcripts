00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.369
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The next thing that we're
going to do is the light-dark mode, and

2
00:00:04.369 --> 00:00:07.581
there are layers to how
light-dark modes work.

3
00:00:07.581 --> 00:00:12.617
If you have worked with light-dark mode
before, you've probably used JavaScript.

4
00:00:12.617 --> 00:00:17.182
And you use JavaScript to toggle
classes or toggle style sheets or

5
00:00:17.182 --> 00:00:22.245
something similar to swap your colors
between a lighter color scheme and

6
00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:23.916
a darker color scheme.

7
00:00:23.916 --> 00:00:28.788
But what we're going to do today is
we're gonna do this all with CSS,

8
00:00:28.788 --> 00:00:31.566
this is relatively new to the CSS spec.

9
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:36.090
And one of one of the interesting
things is that our web page can

10
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.918
actually tap into our
operating systems settings.

11
00:00:39.918 --> 00:00:42.735
So depending on how
your Mac is configured,

12
00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:46.315
depending on how your Windows
computer is configured,

13
00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:51.359
we can have your website look different
automatically without even a switch.

14
00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.160
So I wanted to demo that for you first.

15
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.717
And the way we're going to get
that started is right here,

16
00:00:58.717 --> 00:01:03.291
we're in 6b n your following along,
there's the beginning code pen, or

17
00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:06.428
you can continue on with
the one we've been doing.

18
00:01:06.428 --> 00:01:11.476
We have all of our sections all
together in the same web page.

19
00:01:11.476 --> 00:01:15.762
So what we're going to do
here to start with is,

20
00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:20.584
right here in our CSS,
on our HTML elements styling,

21
00:01:20.584 --> 00:01:24.141
we are going to add the following code.

22
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:31.247
We're gonna say color scheme light dark,
okay?

23
00:01:31.247 --> 00:01:36.097
So right there on the HTML,
we just say color scheme, light,

24
00:01:36.097 --> 00:01:39.841
dark, and then second part,
very important.

25
00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:43.913
On your body, we have already set
a background color and a color and

26
00:01:43.913 --> 00:01:47.783
this is gonna override any of
your operating system settings.

27
00:01:47.783 --> 00:01:53.259
So just for the moment, we're gonna
comment out our background color and

28
00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.155
our text color, so
this will now be white and black.

29
00:01:57.155 --> 00:02:02.493
So it looks very similar to what we
had before, but it's a different

30
00:02:02.493 --> 00:02:07.940
shade of white and a different
shade of black, basically speaking.

31
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.751
Okay, so if you are on a Mac,
you can now go to your system settings and

32
00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:19.218
under appearance,
there are some icons here

33
00:02:19.218 --> 00:02:23.819
across the top that say light,
dark and auto.

34
00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.687
And what I'm going to do is
switch mine over to dark windows,

35
00:02:26.687 --> 00:02:30.023
people hang on just a second,
I'll tell you how to do this on Windows.

36
00:02:30.023 --> 00:02:32.412
When I switch this over to dark,

37
00:02:32.412 --> 00:02:38.433
it automatically changes the colors on
my webpage, how amazing is that, okay?

38
00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:43.518
So if you're on a Windows computer,
go to your start menu,

39
00:02:43.518 --> 00:02:50.249
and then you're gonna go to settings,
then go to personalization and color.

40
00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:55.540
So for Windows once again it's
settings personalization or

41
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.903
start menu settings personalization and
color.

42
00:02:59.903 --> 00:03:04.523
And on that screen you should have similar
options to light, dark or auto, and

43
00:03:04.523 --> 00:03:08.585
you should be able to switch from
whatever you have on your computer,

44
00:03:08.585 --> 00:03:12.386
from lights to dark and
you should see the same color switching.

45
00:03:12.386 --> 00:03:15.525
All right, so that's really nice.

46
00:03:15.525 --> 00:03:20.110
Notice that the color scheme,
this item works really well up here for

47
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.508
our top part here in our bio,
but as we scroll down,

48
00:03:23.508 --> 00:03:27.087
like into our projects,
you may notice a few issues.

49
00:03:27.087 --> 00:03:31.704
Remember once again that our projects
had some text colors that were

50
00:03:31.704 --> 00:03:36.564
called out here, it does not necessarily
doing what we want it to do, so

51
00:03:36.564 --> 00:03:42.165
this is not a perfect solution, but
it's interesting that the solution exists.

52
00:03:42.165 --> 00:03:45.816
So if you were to build
a very basic webpage,

53
00:03:45.816 --> 00:03:48.887
this is one possible way of doing it.
