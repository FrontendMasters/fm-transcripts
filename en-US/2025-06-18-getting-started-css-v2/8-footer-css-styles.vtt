00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.441
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so
here in your course website,

2
00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:06.975
you'll see that I've
given you two looks for

3
00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:10.703
the way that this should look,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Because it's not very

4
00:00:10.703 --> 00:00:11.620
pretty to start with.

5
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.315
So we have our h2s.

6
00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:16.020
They're centered on the page.

7
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.392
We have our lists, then we've had
the bullets removed from the list.

8
00:00:19.392 --> 00:00:21.003
Our text is centered.

9
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:23.894
And then interestingly,
for whatever reason,

10
00:00:23.894 --> 00:00:26.441
our designer decided to take our icon bar.

11
00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:32.049
Instead of making these blue icons, they
are black icons down here on the bottom.

12
00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:35.939
So we're gonna need to restyle these
a little bit for this purpose.

13
00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:41.299
And then, on desktop, we're going to
have basically three columns of links,

14
00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:46.351
and there are other projects and
our contacts separated a little bit more.

15
00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:49.850
Okay, so let's code all of that up.

16
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.634
So we need to change our markup here for
our footer, and

17
00:00:53.634 --> 00:00:59.912
we're going to think about our markup for
that 750, pixel breakpoint for our footer.

18
00:00:59.912 --> 00:01:01.807
When we get to that point in time,

19
00:01:01.807 --> 00:01:05.211
we will have three different
columns here of information.

20
00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:10.476
And so we need to make sure that
we have grouped our H3 plus our

21
00:01:10.476 --> 00:01:17.719
lists such that we have three children in
order to make this layout work correctly.

22
00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:22.819
So what I'm going to do to get
that in place, here in my HTML,

23
00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:29.019
I will start here after the h2 for
other projects, but here at blogging.

24
00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:33.978
And I will add a div with

25
00:01:33.978 --> 00:01:39.990
a class of footer text box.

26
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.768
And then this is the blogging part of it.

27
00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:48.140
So we have an H3,
we have our UL, and then a /div.

28
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.674
So what you'll see here, format my HTML
is that that will give us a child.

29
00:01:55.674 --> 00:01:59.296
So we have other projects,
we have one text box here,

30
00:01:59.296 --> 00:02:03.573
we're gonna repeat this process here for
around open source.

31
00:02:03.573 --> 00:02:08.861
Again, div with a class of footer,

32
00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:13.974
text box and slash div after that,

33
00:02:13.974 --> 00:02:20.851
and then the same thing
third time around other

34
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:27.282
courses,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Slash div down there.

35
00:02:27.282 --> 00:02:32.706
And then what this is going to do now is,
you"ll see we have

36
00:02:32.706 --> 00:02:38.682
our three children here,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Which

37
00:02:38.682 --> 00:02:40.723
will wind up being our three columns, but

38
00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:43.650
now they need a parent in order
to get them in order, right?

39
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.844
We need a parent to
organize these children and

40
00:02:48.844 --> 00:02:53.905
so around the these
particular three items,

41
00:02:53.905 --> 00:02:59.914
I'm gonna give this a div
with a class of footer text.

42
00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:07.650
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And so that will give
us our parent of footer text and

43
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.278
they will give us our three children.

44
00:03:11.278 --> 00:03:13.733
Each child is called footer text box.

45
00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:16.316
So now we have a really
good structure here, and

46
00:03:16.316 --> 00:03:19.233
we're ready to apply a little
bit of styling to that.

47
00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:22.799
Down here for our contact, of course,
we already have our icons.

48
00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.098
The styling is good there except for

49
00:03:25.098 --> 00:03:29.474
the fact that we need to make them
black instead of making them blue.

50
00:03:29.474 --> 00:03:33.236
So we don't really have
any layout issues there.

51
00:03:33.236 --> 00:03:39.066
All right, so now I'm going to
apply some styling for mobile.

52
00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:45.414
And so just before my media query,
I'll add the styling here.

53
00:03:45.414 --> 00:03:49.161
Footer styling, okay?

54
00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:54.208
And I'm gonna start with my
generic footer HTML element,

55
00:03:54.208 --> 00:03:59.461
and I'll say text align center,
so just like we saw before,

56
00:03:59.461 --> 00:04:03.896
that will center our text
here on the page, great.

57
00:04:03.896 --> 00:04:11.879
Then inside of our footer text boxes,

58
00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.124
footer text box ul.

59
00:04:16.124 --> 00:04:19.476
So in other words, each of those little
sections there where you see the bullets

60
00:04:19.476 --> 00:04:22.645
hanging out over there on the left hand
side, we've got to get rid of that.

61
00:04:22.645 --> 00:04:28.043
So once again, list, style,

62
00:04:28.043 --> 00:04:35.319
type of none margin zero, padding zero.

63
00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:40.822
Okay, so we've killed all the spacing,
well done.

64
00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:46.557
And then to give us a little bit
more space there vertically,

65
00:04:46.557 --> 00:04:51.618
cuz now we've smashed
everything together really,

66
00:04:51.618 --> 00:04:56.566
really tight,
I will go to my footer text box li, and

67
00:04:56.566 --> 00:05:00.290
I'm going to say my line height is two.

68
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.306
And that will push things apart again, so

69
00:05:03.306 --> 00:05:08.842
that we have a little bit of
breathing room between everything.

70
00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:14.756
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I also wanna make
my font size a little bit smaller,

71
00:05:14.756 --> 00:05:21.646
so once again, on my UL,
I can say my font size will be calc.

72
00:05:21.646 --> 00:05:27.965
And then my base font size times 0.85,

73
00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:33.405
so in the case here of my footer text,

74
00:05:33.405 --> 00:05:39.385
this will make it about 0.8,5 rem.

75
00:05:39.385 --> 00:05:41.402
So it's 1 REM by default.

76
00:05:41.402 --> 00:05:45.790
We'll multiply that by point eight five,
so it'll become point eight five, and

77
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.361
the text size will be just a little
bit smaller all the way through.

78
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:52.758
All right, so
those take care of the footer text box.

79
00:05:52.758 --> 00:05:57.778
All right,
now I'm gonna go back to the footer

80
00:05:57.778 --> 00:06:03.204
text overall,
.footer text which is my parent.

81
00:06:03.204 --> 00:06:04.063
So remember,

82
00:06:04.063 --> 00:06:08.433
we have the parent up here controlling
all of the individual text boxes.

83
00:06:08.433 --> 00:06:14.443
We'll start here with our
line height of 1.5 and

84
00:06:14.443 --> 00:06:19.352
we're gonna say our display is grid and.

85
00:06:19.352 --> 00:06:25.013
And we're gonna say our grid
template columns is 1fr,

86
00:06:25.013 --> 00:06:28.264
and once again, a gap of 2rem,

87
00:06:28.264 --> 00:06:33.935
which will give us space
between the individual boxes.

88
00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:35.475
Nice, right?

89
00:06:35.475 --> 00:06:38.022
I'll push all of that apart.

90
00:06:38.022 --> 00:06:42.891
Now the spacing between the h2s and
everything else looks a little bit off.

91
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:48.215
So I'm going to add to my
H2s down here in my footer,

92
00:06:48.215 --> 00:06:52.813
a class, and I'm gonna call it Hh2 footer,

93
00:06:52.813 --> 00:06:56.323
cuz I'm super creative that way.

94
00:07:00.744 --> 00:07:04.054
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and
then we can style that.

95
00:07:08.019 --> 00:07:12.696
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: .h2-footer,

96
00:07:16.074 --> 00:07:18.655
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Margin of 2rem 0.

97
00:07:18.655 --> 00:07:22.673
So we're gonna have 2rems
of space on the top and

98
00:07:22.673 --> 00:07:27.588
the bottom that'll push
everything apart really nicely.

99
00:07:27.588 --> 00:07:32.363
And then the last thing I have to address
are these SPGs down here in the bottom.

100
00:07:32.363 --> 00:07:35.426
They're currently blue and
we want them to be black.

101
00:07:35.426 --> 00:07:42.405
So .footer text .social.

102
00:07:42.405 --> 00:07:49.039
So the social icons that are within
the footer text environment,

103
00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:54.103
which will override the blue
that we had earlier,

104
00:07:54.103 --> 00:08:00.149
which was just on .social,
we can say our fill is var Onyx.

105
00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:02.761
That doesn't seem to be working.

106
00:08:02.761 --> 00:08:05.793
Let me just double check my HTML here.

107
00:08:05.793 --> 00:08:10.538
So if I go into my HTML, well,
this is not inside a footer text.

108
00:08:10.538 --> 00:08:13.547
Footer text is up here.

109
00:08:13.547 --> 00:08:17.888
So this is actually the icons and
then socials inside of icons.

110
00:08:17.888 --> 00:08:20.270
So let me fix my class here.

111
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.138
Let's put this back to social.

112
00:08:23.138 --> 00:08:27.880
So we have .icons, and
then we have .social,

113
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.149
so this should be .icons, .social, and

114
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:38.076
then then we wind up with our
icons down here turning black,

115
00:08:38.076 --> 00:08:41.538
which is what we're looking for.

116
00:08:41.538 --> 00:08:47.582
And we can also set up
the additional state here.

117
00:08:47.582 --> 00:08:52.546
So this would be .icons

118
00:08:52.546 --> 00:08:56.770
.social: hover.

119
00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:01.496
And our fill color here

120
00:09:01.496 --> 00:09:05.732
will be var marina.

121
00:09:05.732 --> 00:09:11.667
And when we roll over our
icons down here on the bottom,

122
00:09:11.667 --> 00:09:15.680
boom, there we go, they turn blue.
