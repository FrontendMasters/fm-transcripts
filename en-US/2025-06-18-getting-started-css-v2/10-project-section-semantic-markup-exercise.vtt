00:00:00.245 --> 00:00:02.581
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
welcome everyone to chapter 5.

2
00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:04.569
We are flying through this material.

3
00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:07.418
We've created our about
section of the webpage.

4
00:00:07.418 --> 00:00:09.777
We've created the footer
section of the webpage.

5
00:00:09.777 --> 00:00:14.122
Now we're working in the middle part of
the page, which is on our project section.

6
00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:18.453
And on the website you'll see that we have
screenshots for how that should look,

7
00:00:18.453 --> 00:00:20.120
I'm just giving one project.

8
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.453
But all the projects will
look similar to this.

9
00:00:22.453 --> 00:00:25.085
So on mobile,
we've got our picture on the top.

10
00:00:25.085 --> 00:00:28.143
Underneath we have our text,
it should be centered and

11
00:00:28.143 --> 00:00:31.008
we have this series of tags
down here on the bottom.

12
00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:35.777
Notice that we've been consistent
with this interesting rounded corner,

13
00:00:35.777 --> 00:00:38.316
pointy corner thing that we're doing.

14
00:00:38.316 --> 00:00:42.001
So our images have the rounded
corner on the top and

15
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:45.172
the pointy corners on
the other side of it.

16
00:00:45.172 --> 00:00:49.553
We've kept that same kind of
feel into our tags, okay?

17
00:00:49.553 --> 00:00:51.460
And we kept that into.

18
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.322
Look at this little white
background we have going on here.

19
00:00:54.322 --> 00:00:58.164
So anytime you pick some sort
of little style like that,

20
00:00:58.164 --> 00:01:03.657
we're gonna round our images, round
quarters here, pointy quarters there.

21
00:01:03.657 --> 00:01:07.518
We're gonna continue that into some of
the other elements on the page too.

22
00:01:07.518 --> 00:01:09.735
That's a good design principle.

23
00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:14.223
And then after that, we're going to have
our projects and we're going to have

24
00:01:14.223 --> 00:01:18.779
things next to each other, kind of similar
to what you saw with the bio section of

25
00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:23.144
the website where we had the image on one
side and we had the text on the other.

26
00:01:23.144 --> 00:01:26.836
So that is what we're starting with.

27
00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:31.325
And you will be shocked to know
that the very first part of this

28
00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:34.594
process is marking up
our things with HTML.

29
00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:38.024
So let's take a look at
our beginning code pen.

30
00:01:40.326 --> 00:01:41.498
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Here we are.

31
00:01:41.498 --> 00:01:46.282
We've got a series of items here
on the page that are part of our

32
00:01:46.282 --> 00:01:47.949
project portfolio.

33
00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:56.387
And once again, I have given you all of
the starting text here on the page, okay?

34
00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:00.027
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And your job is.

35
00:02:00.027 --> 00:02:03.203
This is the same CSS
that we had here before.

36
00:02:03.203 --> 00:02:06.808
Your job is going to be to
try to mark all of this up.

37
00:02:06.808 --> 00:02:13.119
And so let's give you a little bit of
time to try marking all of this up.

38
00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:15.225
See what you can do with that.

39
00:02:15.225 --> 00:02:18.095
And I will go through
the answers here momentarily.

40
00:02:23.164 --> 00:02:24.780
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Welcome back, everyone.

41
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.602
Hopefully you were had a chance to try
a little bit of the markup here for

42
00:02:29.602 --> 00:02:30.683
our projects.

43
00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:35.053
And I am going to go through some
of that with you at this point.

44
00:02:35.053 --> 00:02:39.322
We start off our project
section with an H2.

45
00:02:39.322 --> 00:02:43.049
But because we're eventually going
to assemble this all into one page,

46
00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.956
we have an H1 elsewhere on the page.

47
00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:46.528
That was the name of our developer.

48
00:02:46.528 --> 00:02:51.319
And so
this section would start with an H2.

49
00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.645
Then the next part of that was the H3,

50
00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:57.152
which happens to be the name
of each individual project.

51
00:02:57.152 --> 00:03:00.703
So that should be an H3 to
keep our headings in order.

52
00:03:00.703 --> 00:03:03.651
And then we, of course,
we have a paragraph.

53
00:03:03.651 --> 00:03:08.437
For our different kinds of technologies
that we use to build each of

54
00:03:08.437 --> 00:03:09.727
these projects.

55
00:03:09.727 --> 00:03:14.798
There is an unordered list with each
one of those technologies inside of it.

56
00:03:14.798 --> 00:03:18.019
We'll style those up to look
pretty in a little while, but

57
00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.462
that's the kind of markup that
you're looking for for that.

58
00:03:21.462 --> 00:03:26.426
And then there's the image here at
the end with the description on it.

59
00:03:26.426 --> 00:03:31.330
So all of the other projects are going to
be similar to that in terms of their basic

60
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.926
markup.

61
00:03:31.926 --> 00:03:37.745
Then let's go through how we're going to
mark these up a little bit further for

62
00:03:37.745 --> 00:03:40.225
purposes of layout and so forth.

63
00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:44.534
So first of all,
around each group of text.

64
00:03:44.534 --> 00:03:49.391
So here we have an H3 and
a paragraph and our unordered list.

65
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:53.463
We are going to wrap a div
with a class of text.

66
00:03:53.463 --> 00:03:58.122
And the purpose of this is just
to group together all of our text

67
00:03:58.122 --> 00:04:01.627
into a single container for
layout purposes.

68
00:04:01.627 --> 00:04:04.090
So that's why that's there.

69
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.315
We also have an article around each
one of these particular items,

70
00:04:07.315 --> 00:04:11.130
because, again, each one of these
projects could potentially stand alone.

71
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.943
It's a self described web page.

72
00:04:12.943 --> 00:04:15.434
That's the definition of an article.

73
00:04:15.434 --> 00:04:20.782
So I've given that article with a class
of project, and that is going around

74
00:04:20.782 --> 00:04:26.231
our div with a class of text and all
the markup inside of that, plus the image.

75
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:30.956
Then, once we have our series of articles.

76
00:04:30.956 --> 00:04:33.225
Make this a little bigger.

77
00:04:33.225 --> 00:04:36.982
Once we have our series of articles,
then we're going to put a div around

78
00:04:36.982 --> 00:04:39.950
the whole thing and
I've given that a class of projects.

79
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.854
And that will be for layout purposes.

80
00:04:41.854 --> 00:04:45.866
So we have individual projects
with a class of projects singular.

81
00:04:45.866 --> 00:04:50.056
And we have a group of them together
with a class of projects plural.

82
00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:51.089
All right.

83
00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:56.419
I guess I missed one thing here, which
was, I put around the entire section here,

84
00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.508
this element,
which is the main HTML element,

85
00:04:59.508 --> 00:05:04.170
because this is the main focus of
the web pages, all of these projects.

86
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.628
So we have an article.

87
00:05:05.628 --> 00:05:08.041
That is our about section.

88
00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:08.915
We have a footer.

89
00:05:08.915 --> 00:05:10.078
That's our footer.

90
00:05:10.078 --> 00:05:13.533
And then this section is going to be
inside of the main element because

91
00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:15.213
it's the main focus of the page.
