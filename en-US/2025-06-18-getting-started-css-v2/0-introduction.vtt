00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.995
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Hello everyone,
my name is Jen Kramer,

2
00:00:02.995 --> 00:00:06.088
welcome to getting started with CSS v2.

3
00:00:06.088 --> 00:00:11.061
In this course, we're going to be
building a single page portfolio

4
00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:14.649
website from the ground up,
using HTML and CSS.

5
00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:19.324
We will be working on the content for that
particular portfolio, we are going to be

6
00:00:19.324 --> 00:00:23.391
building out the sections of that
page using a program called CodePen,

7
00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:25.589
I'll tell you more about that later.

8
00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.095
And then we'll move this into VS code,
which is a code editor, and

9
00:00:30.095 --> 00:00:34.374
we'll get this published online
via GitHub and GitHub pages.

10
00:00:34.374 --> 00:00:37.829
And for those of you who know
a little bit about HTML and CSS,

11
00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.785
one of the fun things that we'll
add to this is a light/dark theme.

12
00:00:41.785 --> 00:00:45.351
With a switch that's completely CSS
powered that'll switch us back and

13
00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:49.508
forth between two different color themes,
so that'll be a kind of fun thing to add.

14
00:00:49.508 --> 00:00:55.443
The website for this course is
gettingstartedwith.css.education,

15
00:00:55.443 --> 00:00:58.074
and we are ready to get started.

16
00:00:58.074 --> 00:01:02.246
So from the website that's here,
I'll just show you briefly,

17
00:01:02.246 --> 00:01:04.964
there is a link here to the finished site.

18
00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:09.173
If you take a look, this is the website
we'll be building today, and this is the,

19
00:01:09.173 --> 00:01:11.674
of course,
the desktop version of the website,

20
00:01:11.674 --> 00:01:15.098
you can make your screen smaller
to see the mobile version of this.

21
00:01:15.098 --> 00:01:19.672
So you'll see that we have a photo, we
have some information about this person,

22
00:01:19.672 --> 00:01:23.863
you'll see that we have links here
that go to various social media items.

23
00:01:23.863 --> 00:01:28.734
We then have a series of projects, those
projects consist of images, headlines,

24
00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:30.693
information about the project.

25
00:01:30.693 --> 00:01:35.522
And then tags at the bottom indicating
the kind of technologies that were used to

26
00:01:35.522 --> 00:01:36.761
put that together.

27
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:40.050
And then down towards the bottom
of the page here in the footer,

28
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.656
you can have simple links
that go to other places,

29
00:01:42.656 --> 00:01:46.133
other things that maybe you don't
wanna feature as prominently,

30
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:49.633
as well as your contact information
down at the bottom of the page.

31
00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:51.806
And then again, up here at the top,

32
00:01:51.806 --> 00:01:56.161
we do have the option of switching
over to a dark theme, how fun is that?

33
00:01:56.161 --> 00:01:58.215
Down here at the bottom
of the course website,

34
00:01:58.215 --> 00:02:01.218
this will give you information about
the background of the course or

35
00:02:01.218 --> 00:02:04.130
the kind of prerequisites that
we're going to be going through.

36
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.282
And I'm just going to start here right at
Chapter 1 if you guys are ready to begin.

37
00:02:09.282 --> 00:02:13.363
So a little bit about what you
should know coming into this course.

38
00:02:13.363 --> 00:02:19.311
And as I just said, we're gonna go through
and build a single page portfolio website.

39
00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:23.162
I strongly encourage all of you
to have your own information,

40
00:02:23.162 --> 00:02:28.355
use your own about information, use your
own photos, feature your own projects.

41
00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:32.276
I'm gonna go through with you how you
might think about that content and

42
00:02:32.276 --> 00:02:33.393
put that together.

43
00:02:33.393 --> 00:02:37.612
Of course, you can use the materials that
I have here for this course as well.

44
00:02:37.612 --> 00:02:41.773
You don't have to follow along exactly
the color scheme that I'm using,

45
00:02:41.773 --> 00:02:42.990
you can change that.

46
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.193
I recommend going to
a website like Adobe Color.

47
00:02:46.193 --> 00:02:50.012
I think Canva has got some color schemes
there's a whole bunch of places online you

48
00:02:50.012 --> 00:02:51.354
can go to get color schemes.

49
00:02:51.354 --> 00:02:55.547
If you're challenged when
it comes to color matching,

50
00:02:55.547 --> 00:03:00.465
you'll probably also wanna have
at least one font that you like.

51
00:03:00.465 --> 00:03:05.326
This course is gonna be using the Inter,
I-N-T-E-R, Inter font that's

52
00:03:05.326 --> 00:03:09.988
available through Google Fonts but
you can choose any font that you like.

53
00:03:09.988 --> 00:03:12.812
I recommend having a photo of yourself and

54
00:03:12.812 --> 00:03:18.149
I'll talk a little bit more about what
that photo should look like, ideally.

55
00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:21.835
And then maybe up to three examples
of your work if you want more,

56
00:03:21.835 --> 00:03:22.938
that's fine too.

57
00:03:22.938 --> 00:03:25.138
And then your social media links,
typically,

58
00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:27.669
you'll include something like LinkedIn and
GitHub.

59
00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.674
If you have other media that you
use in a professional manner,

60
00:03:31.674 --> 00:03:33.686
that's recommended as well.

61
00:03:33.686 --> 00:03:36.861
Once again, there's little screenshot
of the site that we're building.

62
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.820
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then,

63
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.117
in terms of what you should know
before you take this course.

64
00:03:43.117 --> 00:03:44.134
So first of all,

65
00:03:44.134 --> 00:03:48.425
if you do not know a whole lot about
how the internet works or clients and

66
00:03:48.425 --> 00:03:53.331
servers or if any of the terminology that
I talk about today are tripping you up.

67
00:03:53.331 --> 00:03:56.164
I recommend watching
the Internet Fundamentals course,

68
00:03:56.164 --> 00:03:59.344
this completely free course here
through Frontend Masters, and

69
00:03:59.344 --> 00:04:02.885
you can click that link and watch those
videos to come up to speed on that.

70
00:04:02.885 --> 00:04:06.454
I also recommend watching
the Frontend Masters boot camp.

71
00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:10.897
You'll get an introduction to HTML and
CSS there if you are coming into

72
00:04:10.897 --> 00:04:14.751
this with absolutely no background and
coding whatsoever.

73
00:04:14.751 --> 00:04:20.684
And that is completely free to watch as
well, so feel free to take a look at that.

74
00:04:20.684 --> 00:04:23.319
In terms of your technology requirements,

75
00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:28.527
there are very little you'll actually need
in order to follow along with this course.

76
00:04:28.527 --> 00:04:32.201
For our development portion of the course,
we'll actually work in CodePen a lot,

77
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:35.038
which is something that works
right inside of your web browser,

78
00:04:35.038 --> 00:04:36.472
there's nothing to download.

79
00:04:36.472 --> 00:04:43.090
Later on, we're going to go into VS Code,
which is an industry standard code editor.

80
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.713
If you have other code editors that you
prefer, totally fine to use those instead.

81
00:04:47.713 --> 00:04:50.462
And of course,
as always in web development,

82
00:04:50.462 --> 00:04:55.122
we recommend that you have a couple of
web browsers installed to follow along.

83
00:04:55.122 --> 00:04:57.931
And I've given you links to Firefox and

84
00:04:57.931 --> 00:05:01.855
Chrome as two that are compatible
on both Macs and PCs.

85
00:05:01.855 --> 00:05:06.484
And if you're on a PC, you may also
have Edge, if you're on a Mac,

86
00:05:06.484 --> 00:05:08.327
you may also have Safari.
