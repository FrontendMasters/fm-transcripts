00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.767
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So now what I'm going
to do is address those skills.

2
00:00:03.767 --> 00:00:09.529
Let's turn those into those interesting
little images that we had here.

3
00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:12.974
So it's that blue background
with the interesting corners and

4
00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:15.645
the names of the skills,
all next to each other.

5
00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:18.312
How do we make that magic happen?

6
00:00:18.312 --> 00:00:22.748
So we'll add some styling for that, and

7
00:00:22.748 --> 00:00:26.805
this is going to be our .project ul.

8
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:33.883
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
just as we always do, the very first

9
00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:39.400
thing that we do is we
turn off our margin,

10
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:46.194
our padding, and
our list- style-type: none.

11
00:00:46.194 --> 00:00:47.745
We turn all of that off,

12
00:00:47.745 --> 00:00:51.633
and now we have our skills just
stacked on top of each other.

13
00:00:54.173 --> 00:00:59.062
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then we
can style up our li's

14
00:00:59.062 --> 00:01:02.344
.project li
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

15
00:01:02.344 --> 00:01:05.544
the first thing we do here is
give them a background color,

16
00:01:08.895 --> 00:01:13.029
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Marina and then a text

17
00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:19.694
color: var[-white], okay?

18
00:01:19.694 --> 00:01:24.277
So we make sure that we have our
background color and our text color here.

19
00:01:24.277 --> 00:01:29.015
It looks like one giant block because
they're all right next to each other,

20
00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:33.014
and so it looks like that's
a continuous block, but remember,

21
00:01:33.014 --> 00:01:37.481
there's actually a background in
each one of those li's separately.

22
00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:40.681
The text is a little close
to the edges of that box.

23
00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:45.840
So let's give it a little
bit of padding: 0.Srum.

24
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.535
That will give us a little
bit of space there,

25
00:01:50.535 --> 00:01:55.231
and then we can give them a border radius,
and

26
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:59.699
a I'm gonna set up a new variable for
this.

27
00:02:02.584 --> 00:02:05.347
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
we had one here called corners.

28
00:02:05.347 --> 00:02:10.130
If we assign corners to these particular
items here, they're too small, and

29
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.951
that corner is kinda too big.

30
00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:16.532
So I'm gonna make a one
called corners-small, and

31
00:02:16.532 --> 00:02:21.956
this will be 10px 0,
which will look a little bitt better.

32
00:02:25.118 --> 00:02:26.408
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then we can apply it.

33
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.835
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Var[ -corners-sum].

34
00:02:36.542 --> 00:02:39.847
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So there we go,
now we have our individually styled tags.

35
00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:42.616
And it's probably getting a little
bit hard to see what's going on here,

36
00:02:42.616 --> 00:02:44.770
because these are still all
stacked on top of each other.

37
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.514
So how do we get them to go
horizontally across the page,

38
00:02:48.514 --> 00:02:50.994
so that they're next to each other?

39
00:02:50.994 --> 00:02:52.701
How would we go about doing that?

40
00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:53.941
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Flex.

41
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:56.149
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Flexbox, right?

42
00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:58.757
And we're gonna put that on the ul.

43
00:02:58.757 --> 00:03:05.396
So display: flex: flex-flow: row wrap.

44
00:03:09.207 --> 00:03:18.462
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then we can justify
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Content in the center,

45
00:03:18.462 --> 00:03:21.800
and we'll get that a gap of 1ram.

46
00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:26.672
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Boom.

47
00:03:30.411 --> 00:03:30.938
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

48
00:03:30.938 --> 00:03:32.366
If the font looks a little bit big, we can
always make that a little bit smaller.

49
00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:38.084
We can use our same technique
we've been using in this site.

50
00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:43.726
We can say our font- size is calc[].

51
00:03:43.726 --> 00:03:46.838
So we'll do a calculation,
inside of that calculation,

52
00:03:46.838 --> 00:03:49.704
we're gonna do exactly
the same thing we did before.

53
00:03:49.704 --> 00:03:56.771
We're going to have a [-base-font-size]

54
00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:59.780
times 0.85].

55
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.332
Just to make the font
a little bit smaller and

56
00:04:03.332 --> 00:04:07.940
everything will get a little
bit smaller with it, okay?

57
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.824
So now,
we should have our text here on the top.

58
00:04:11.824 --> 00:04:15.859
We've got our little tags here underneath.

59
00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:21.099
And as we scroll down,
you see that all of the projects

60
00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:27.170
have that same technique applied to them,
the same styling.

61
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.133
So back when we were looking at our
individual projects originally,

62
00:04:32.133 --> 00:04:34.699
we set this up with a display grid and

63
00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.336
we sent it up with a single column
with a gap of three ram, right?

64
00:04:39.336 --> 00:04:43.163
That gave us the space between
our tags and our image, but

65
00:04:43.163 --> 00:04:48.680
this also gives us the option now, because
this is a grid based layout that we can.

66
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.867
Using the individual properties,
we can now swap these very easily right

67
00:04:53.867 --> 00:04:59.655
here inside of our CSS, so that the image
is on top and then our text is underneath.

68
00:04:59.655 --> 00:05:01.588
And the way we would do that.

69
00:05:05.366 --> 00:05:12.443
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We can just add this style
right here in the bottom, .project img.

70
00:05:12.443 --> 00:05:16.340
So in other words,
the image inside of each project,

71
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.601
we are going to say grid- row.

72
00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:19.890
So we're witching the rows.

73
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.074
The rows are the ones that go across,

74
00:05:23.074 --> 00:05:28.531
we're switching one to the other,
and our grid row is 1/ 2.

75
00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:33.272
So we're moving our image to
the first position from the second

76
00:05:33.272 --> 00:05:37.670
position where it was, so
we're moving that up on a page.

77
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.492
The text will automatically shift down,
and

78
00:05:40.492 --> 00:05:42.875
now we have an image on top of our text.

79
00:05:45.813 --> 00:05:48.349
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Just like
the way we wanted it.

80
00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:54.933
So we have our image, practical CSS
layouts, our text and our tags.

81
00:05:54.933 --> 00:05:59.721
One of the things that I've noticed
here is that in particular, this one,

82
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:02.685
the ultimate CSS grid and
layout techniques,

83
00:06:02.685 --> 00:06:05.813
very cool image here with the planets and
moons.

84
00:06:05.813 --> 00:06:09.401
But it's very hard to see the edges
of this particular image,

85
00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:10.850
everybody notice that?

86
00:06:12.675 --> 00:06:14.558
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It kinda blends
into the background here,

87
00:06:14.558 --> 00:06:16.975
because it happens to have
a white background as well.

88
00:06:16.975 --> 00:06:21.179
So sometimes it's nice to add
a little bit of extra styling,

89
00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:24.239
when you notice little problems like this.

90
00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:28.478
This may not be something that affects you
in whatever you show on your portfolio.

91
00:06:28.478 --> 00:06:33.210
It didn't affect the original design
that the graphic designer gave me using

92
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.890
the images that it had, but I have that
problem with this particular image.

93
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:41.382
So how would I make the image stand
out a little bit more relative to

94
00:06:41.382 --> 00:06:42.344
the background?

95
00:06:42.344 --> 00:06:44.593
What could I do?

96
00:06:44.593 --> 00:06:46.456
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: We could border on radius.

97
00:06:46.456 --> 00:06:48.444
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We could
put a border on it, right?

98
00:06:48.444 --> 00:06:49.419
That would be great.

99
00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:51.785
If we put a little black border around it,

100
00:06:51.785 --> 00:06:54.564
it would help make the image
pop out a little bit.

101
00:06:54.564 --> 00:07:00.674
So to do that, let's go to,
it's our second project,

102
00:07:00.674 --> 00:07:04.314
and I'm gonna go to this image and

103
00:07:04.314 --> 00:07:09.395
I give it a class here of image,
img-border.

104
00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:14.758
So right inside of that image,
you can just give it a class,

105
00:07:14.758 --> 00:07:18.835
and I've given it a class
of image- border,

106
00:07:18.835 --> 00:07:23.369
and then in your CSS,
you can add .img- border.

107
00:07:23.369 --> 00:07:29.359
Then you could say
something like border:1px

108
00:07:29.359 --> 00:07:36.788
solid var [onyx]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

109
00:07:36.788 --> 00:07:41.452
then that should give you a lovely little
black border right around your image.

110
00:07:41.452 --> 00:07:43.886
It makes it pop right off the page.

111
00:07:43.886 --> 00:07:46.954
Isn't that better?

112
00:07:46.954 --> 00:07:50.671
Looks so much better than it did just
sort of blending into the background,

113
00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:51.384
are you okay?

114
00:07:51.384 --> 00:07:52.713
But it's not on every image.

115
00:07:52.713 --> 00:07:55.332
This image here, it's not on, all right?

116
00:07:55.332 --> 00:08:00.039
So look for those tiny little
enhancements, it doesn't take much.

117
00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:04.480
It's a line or two of code, and
just improve the look of things overall.

118
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.518
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Since this
layout is one column,

119
00:08:07.518 --> 00:08:12.738
why didn't we just use the order
property to order them?

120
00:08:12.738 --> 00:08:14.969
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You could do that,
if you were using Flexbox,

121
00:08:14.969 --> 00:08:18.014
you could use the order property,
but here we're using grid.

122
00:08:18.014 --> 00:08:21.150
And so since we're using grid,
we have to do it this way.

123
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.678
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Just some
alternate suggestions that you

124
00:08:23.678 --> 00:08:28.523
could always use drop shadows or box
shadows, making the images stand out too?

125
00:08:28.523 --> 00:08:32.065
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yep, yeah,
you could definitely put a drop shadow or

126
00:08:32.065 --> 00:08:37.201
a box shadow, which the difference is
subtle and slight, but it's a thing.

127
00:08:37.201 --> 00:08:40.795
You could try that, you could apply it to
all the images, or just the one image.

128
00:08:40.795 --> 00:08:44.435
Those would be great things to add as
well, in order to make that image come off

129
00:08:44.435 --> 00:08:46.972
the page a little bit and
make it a little bit clearer.

130
00:08:46.972 --> 00:08:49.080
So yeah,
those were great suggestions also.
