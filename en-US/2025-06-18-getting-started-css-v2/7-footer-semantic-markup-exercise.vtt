00:00:00.061 --> 00:00:03.287
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,
well then, congratulations,

2
00:00:03.287 --> 00:00:06.959
you finished chapter three
on setting up our bio.

3
00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:12.251
We are moving on to our next chapter,
which is looking at our footer.

4
00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:16.839
And I would like you guys
to take the lead in this.

5
00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:21.976
So we're going to start with the same
kinds of ideas that we did before.

6
00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:27.209
I'm gonna open up our
beginning markup here.

7
00:00:27.209 --> 00:00:30.569
This has all of the CSS
styles that we just wrote for

8
00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:34.171
the about me section
incorporated here into our CSS.

9
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:38.333
I've put in the wrapper
around the outside here, and

10
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:42.786
this is the text that we're
going to include on the page.

11
00:00:42.786 --> 00:00:46.412
We have other projects,
we have some blogging information,

12
00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:49.211
some other things here for
open source, okay?

13
00:00:49.211 --> 00:00:52.788
And we have another round of
icons down here at the bottom,

14
00:00:52.788 --> 00:00:55.709
which will eventually be here for
our contact.

15
00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:59.226
Make it small,
you're not supposed to make it pretty yet.

16
00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:04.406
What I would like for you to do,
is I'd like you to take,

17
00:01:04.406 --> 00:01:09.481
just go through the HTML and
see if you can semantically

18
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:14.687
mark up this footer context
based on what you see there.

19
00:01:14.687 --> 00:01:19.581
Just worrying about the HTML,
sound good, don't worry about CSS.

20
00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:24.253
Don't make it pretty, just see if you
can work on marking up some HTML here in

21
00:01:24.253 --> 00:01:27.833
the footer, and
then I'll go through my answer with you.

22
00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:34.974
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Welcome back, everyone.

23
00:01:34.974 --> 00:01:38.551
I hope you did well on that
little challenge and your markup.

24
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:41.130
Let's go through what I came up with for
an answer.

25
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.483
And, so here is what I've got,
the styling isn't going to be perfect.

26
00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:51.458
Don't let the styling bother you,
we haven't even tried that yet.

27
00:01:51.458 --> 00:01:55.715
This is taking in styling that we've
already written from our about page and

28
00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:57.522
applying it here to our footer.

29
00:01:57.522 --> 00:01:59.556
So we'll tweak that up here in a moment.

30
00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:03.167
So the way our HTML looks
should be something like this.

31
00:02:03.167 --> 00:02:05.622
We started with a div
with a class of wrapper.

32
00:02:05.622 --> 00:02:09.866
Ultimately, when we go to our final
website, we'll have the about section,

33
00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:13.232
the project section, and
the footer all on top of each other.

34
00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:15.374
The wrapper will go all
the way around everything.

35
00:02:15.374 --> 00:02:19.903
So I've roughed it in here for us.

36
00:02:19.903 --> 00:02:21.289
And then after that,

37
00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:26.147
I have a footer element that goes all
the way around everything here, why?

38
00:02:26.147 --> 00:02:30.370
Because this is the footer, and
that's what footer elements are for.

39
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.829
So we've identified this as
the bottom of our web page.

40
00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.031
Inside of that we have
the words other projects,

41
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:39.303
this should be marked up as an H2.

42
00:02:39.303 --> 00:02:44.155
Remember we only have one H1 per page,
we already take in that with Cedro,

43
00:02:44.155 --> 00:02:48.714
the name of the person's portfolio,
the site that we're building.

44
00:02:48.714 --> 00:02:53.009
So this is one of the second most
important things on the page,

45
00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:54.092
so it gets h2.

46
00:02:54.092 --> 00:02:57.699
After that, we have different
sections here in our footer.

47
00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:01.205
We have a section about blogging,
we have a section of open-source.

48
00:03:01.205 --> 00:03:05.966
And a section about other courses, so each
of those get the next level of heading,

49
00:03:05.966 --> 00:03:06.934
which is an h3.

50
00:03:06.934 --> 00:03:11.067
Remember that keeping your headings
in order is really important for

51
00:03:11.067 --> 00:03:12.712
accessibility purposes.

52
00:03:12.712 --> 00:03:16.631
We wanna make sure that those headings
make a reasonable scaffolding,

53
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:20.615
sort of outline of the page for
people that are using screen readers, and

54
00:03:20.615 --> 00:03:24.101
that they are always in order,
and that we don't skip levels.

55
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:27.093
That's what they mean by that.

56
00:03:27.093 --> 00:03:31.277
After that we have, the items inside
of this look like an ordered list,

57
00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:33.598
they're just a list of links, right?

58
00:03:33.598 --> 00:03:38.131
So we have our uls and lis for
each one of these items, and

59
00:03:38.131 --> 00:03:44.807
there are links associated with some of
these, not all of them, but some of them.

60
00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:47.242
So that is the markup that you see here.

61
00:03:47.242 --> 00:03:52.058
So we have that for blogging, we have
the same kind of thing for open source,

62
00:03:52.058 --> 00:03:57.656
although for whatever reason, open source
didn't have any links associated with it.

63
00:03:57.656 --> 00:04:00.875
And then we have that here for
other courses, okay?

64
00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:07.189
And then finally, when we get to our
contact section, that also gets at

65
00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:12.872
H2 because other projects in
contact are of equal importance,

66
00:04:12.872 --> 00:04:18.255
so they both get H2s, and
then we have a list of icons again.

67
00:04:18.255 --> 00:04:23.083
In fact, you probably could copy this very
easily from the top bar that we already

68
00:04:23.083 --> 00:04:25.355
coded from the about part of the page,

69
00:04:25.355 --> 00:04:28.496
you could just copy this
right on down to our footer.

70
00:04:28.496 --> 00:04:33.304
So this is exactly the same markup again,
this is the icons.

71
00:04:33.304 --> 00:04:38.018
And then remember that we have our
icons are in an unordered list,

72
00:04:38.018 --> 00:04:42.988
each of them getting a list item,
and remember that we have to include

73
00:04:42.988 --> 00:04:47.210
our title inside of our SVGs for
accessibility purposes.
