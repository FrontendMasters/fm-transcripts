00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.182
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We can get a little bit
more specific with our colors, and

2
00:00:03.182 --> 00:00:05.510
that is the next thing we're going to do.

3
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.295
The way we're going to start that
is here inside of all of our color

4
00:00:10.295 --> 00:00:12.299
variables here in our CSS.

5
00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.307
So we have called out a number
of colors here individually.

6
00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:21.482
Those colors are set to be the same no
matter how your computer is configured.

7
00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:25.269
Whether it's configured for light mode or
it's configured for dark mode,

8
00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.348
these are always going to be your colors.

9
00:00:27.348 --> 00:00:33.184
But now in CSS, we have the ability to
create new variables with a light and

10
00:00:33.184 --> 00:00:35.647
a dark option for every color.

11
00:00:35.647 --> 00:00:38.056
So I'm gonna show you how I set this up.

12
00:00:38.056 --> 00:00:44.215
So for example, by default,
let me go back to my body here,

13
00:00:44.215 --> 00:00:50.275
and let me take out the comment
that I have here in the body.

14
00:00:50.275 --> 00:00:53.236
So even though I'm still
in dark mode right now,

15
00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:55.775
it's gonna look like I'm in light mode.

16
00:00:55.775 --> 00:00:59.874
Because now I've actually called
out my colors of platinum for

17
00:00:59.874 --> 00:01:03.056
the background and
phonics for the text, okay?

18
00:01:03.056 --> 00:01:07.917
So what I'm going to do now
here in my CSS variables is

19
00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:11.561
I'm going to set up a new variable, and

20
00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:16.548
I'm gonna call it ld for
light dark, -background.

21
00:01:16.548 --> 00:01:19.083
So this is my light dark background.

22
00:01:19.083 --> 00:01:23.144
And I'm going to use
the light dark function.

23
00:01:23.144 --> 00:01:26.612
This is new in CSS,
if you go to Can I use,

24
00:01:26.612 --> 00:01:31.212
it's got about 86% support
as of this recording.

25
00:01:31.212 --> 00:01:36.327
Your mileage may vary,
you can check it up out on caniuse.com and

26
00:01:36.327 --> 00:01:41.358
inside of my light dark here,
I'm gonna call out my two colors.

27
00:01:41.358 --> 00:01:48.994
So I'm gonna say (var(--platinum),

28
00:01:48.994 --> 00:01:53.334
var(--charcoal).

29
00:01:53.334 --> 00:01:55.425
Charcoal, do I have a charcoal?

30
00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:59.839
I do have a charcoal, charcoal, okay?

31
00:01:59.839 --> 00:02:04.031
So that's gonna be my background colors,
either they're gonna be platinum or

32
00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:05.726
they're going to be charcoal.

33
00:02:05.726 --> 00:02:10.470
The way that I've set this up here in
my CSS you see that I have my light

34
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.062
color first, my dark color second.

35
00:02:13.062 --> 00:02:16.349
I'm working with CSS variables, so
that's the way they're written.

36
00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.135
But you could have two hex codes here.

37
00:02:18.135 --> 00:02:22.562
So you could have Of 000,
and FFF for black and white,

38
00:02:22.562 --> 00:02:26.539
that would be another way
that you can manage this.

39
00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:30.382
We're gonna take the same variable,

40
00:02:30.382 --> 00:02:35.064
copy this, and
I'm gonna just paste that in,

41
00:02:35.064 --> 00:02:39.763
I'm gonna change this name to --ld-text.

42
00:02:39.763 --> 00:02:44.664
Text, and I'm gonna swap these
two colors more or less.

43
00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:49.212
This is gonna be onyx,
will be the text color and

44
00:02:49.212 --> 00:02:53.887
then white will be the other text color,
right?

45
00:02:53.887 --> 00:02:55.207
So it makes sense, right?

46
00:02:55.207 --> 00:02:59.895
If I have a white background, I want
black text, if I have a black background,

47
00:02:59.895 --> 00:03:01.045
I want white text.

48
00:03:01.045 --> 00:03:03.633
So that's what I've spelled out here.

49
00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:04.653
All right, now,

50
00:03:04.653 --> 00:03:08.674
what I need to do is actually call
these variables that I've created.

51
00:03:08.674 --> 00:03:11.487
So, when I go to my body, here for

52
00:03:11.487 --> 00:03:17.012
the background color instead
of calling var(--platinum),

53
00:03:17.012 --> 00:03:23.651
I'm gonna call the one that I want,
switch, so I'm gonna say --ld-bkgd.

54
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:30.401
And for my text color, --ld-text.

55
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:34.657
And so, now that will flip
around my colors, again,

56
00:03:34.657 --> 00:03:39.008
we haven't finished calling
this out everywhere, so

57
00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:44.700
here in the projects, the text is there,
but you can't see it, okay?

58
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:52.207
But it is working in spots, it's
working down here in the footer, yeah?

59
00:03:52.207 --> 00:03:58.269
And in my settings,
I can switch back to light mode and

60
00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.191
my regular webpage is back again.

61
00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:04.104
So that's how we start off testing it.

62
00:04:04.104 --> 00:04:09.525
You can just switch your modes here
at the operating system level and

63
00:04:09.525 --> 00:04:12.390
see how things are working, okay?

64
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.240
How's everybody doing so far?

65
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.144
Relatively straightforward?

66
00:04:16.144 --> 00:04:22.413
Okay, now, I've kept all of my
regular old color variables here.

67
00:04:22.413 --> 00:04:24.275
If I call platinum directly,

68
00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:28.892
that would be platinum would be my
color no matter what color mode I'm in,

69
00:04:28.892 --> 00:04:33.520
whether I'm in light or dark,
it's always gonna be the platinum color.

70
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.867
It's the ones where I have two colors
called here that will be responsive to

71
00:04:37.867 --> 00:04:40.148
flipping between light and dark mode.

72
00:04:40.148 --> 00:04:44.438
So now I'm gonna set up two more of these.

73
00:04:44.438 --> 00:04:48.214
My colors need to switch a little
bit in a couple of other spots.

74
00:04:48.214 --> 00:04:55.984
So let me set up these
other additional variables.

75
00:04:55.984 --> 00:05:01.689
I'm gonna set up one,
I'm gonna call --ld-projects,

76
00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:08.661
and I think this one has to do with
the background colors on the projects.

77
00:05:08.661 --> 00:05:16.060
So I'm going to start with, [COUGH]
light dark with the white background.

78
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.590
And then the second color just
to show you that this works,

79
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.407
I have a color that I haven't used yet,
it's #2e313d.

80
00:05:25.407 --> 00:05:30.609
So I'm gonna switch my background to
that color and when we're in dark mode.

81
00:05:30.609 --> 00:05:35.611
And I'm also gonna set up --ld-blue.

82
00:05:35.611 --> 00:05:37.570
For accessibility purposes,

83
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.788
I have checked a lot of these
contrast in a color contrast checker,

84
00:05:41.788 --> 00:05:46.477
the blue doesn't quite work with both
the light and the dark background.

85
00:05:46.477 --> 00:05:51.379
So now I can modify my blue a little bit
to give me better contrast depending on

86
00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:52.998
which mode that I'm in.

87
00:05:52.998 --> 00:05:58.694
And so, to do that,
I'm going to do another light dark,

88
00:05:58.694 --> 00:06:02.622
and this one's gonna be windsurfing.

89
00:06:02.622 --> 00:06:06.722
Is the color that's giving me trouble,

90
00:06:06.722 --> 00:06:11.070
and better version here at #70DaDD0.

91
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:17.986
Okay, and then we just go and
we make these changes inside of our CSS.

92
00:06:17.986 --> 00:06:24.196
So for our projects, so
here for our background color,

93
00:06:24.196 --> 00:06:29.892
we're gonna go to --ld-projects,
all right?

94
00:06:29.892 --> 00:06:37.143
And then, if I remember correctly,
I think it was my SVG colors.

95
00:06:37.143 --> 00:06:41.631
Yeah, so instead of windsurfing here,

96
00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:45.459
I could do --ld-blue, right?

97
00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:48.459
So I just go and
I just make a few tweaks here and there.

98
00:06:51.593 --> 00:06:53.001
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: See how I'm doing that?

99
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:58.727
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So I'm just gonna make
a few of these changes, just show you how

100
00:06:58.727 --> 00:07:01.954
that's done, and then I'm gonna switch
over to my finished state here.

101
00:07:01.954 --> 00:07:06.723
Okay, so once I have those in place,
then I can go back to my,

102
00:07:06.723 --> 00:07:11.697
because, again, I don't have
any way of switching this yet.

103
00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:14.244
We're gonna code that, but
we don't have any way right now.

104
00:07:14.244 --> 00:07:19.983
I can switch over to dark mode once again,
and you see that.

105
00:07:19.983 --> 00:07:24.097
So, see how that blue is a better
contrast on that background?

106
00:07:24.097 --> 00:07:31.502
Yeah, so that was a good
improvement to make, all right?

107
00:07:31.502 --> 00:07:33.654
How amazing and fun is that?

108
00:07:33.654 --> 00:07:39.201
And when you're done,
it will look like this, [LAUGH].

109
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:41.834
Part of running the cooking
show that we're doing here.

110
00:07:41.834 --> 00:07:45.177
Put the raw turkey in the oven, and
we let it bake for four hours, and

111
00:07:45.177 --> 00:07:47.240
then we pull out the fully cooked turkey.

112
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.406
So there we go, here he is, after we've
done all those various changes and

113
00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:55.202
we've set up all of our various colors.

114
00:07:55.202 --> 00:07:58.305
And so, I thought this down here,

115
00:07:58.305 --> 00:08:03.663
there are a few changes I didn't
fix in my other code there.

116
00:08:03.663 --> 00:08:08.556
So, all right,
any questions on the concept of how this

117
00:08:08.556 --> 00:08:11.586
light dark thing works together?

118
00:08:11.586 --> 00:08:14.496
All right, so
the only thing that you need in order

119
00:08:14.496 --> 00:08:19.138
to get this magic working at the level
that we're at is configuring some of these

120
00:08:19.138 --> 00:08:23.247
variables using the light dark function,
that's one of the things.

121
00:08:23.247 --> 00:08:26.292
Then the other thing was here on our HTML,

122
00:08:26.292 --> 00:08:30.390
we added this property called
color scheme light dark.

123
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:34.362
That's it, then you just assign
your variables and it all works.
