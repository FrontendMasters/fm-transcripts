00:00:00.027 --> 00:00:03.180
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So let's talk a little
bit about developing materials for

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.152
your portfolio.

3
00:00:04.152 --> 00:00:08.923
Just recently, I went through the process
of hiring a new instructor to work with me

4
00:00:08.923 --> 00:00:11.320
at Annie Cannons, which is where I work.

5
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.417
I'm the director of learning design and
technology,

6
00:00:14.417 --> 00:00:18.860
basically the head of a boot camp,
which teaches human trafficking survivors

7
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.717
how to code and how to build Websites,
full stack web development.

8
00:00:22.717 --> 00:00:25.691
And I looked at about 80
different resumes and

9
00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:30.016
it was really shocking how every
single resume was exactly the same.

10
00:00:30.016 --> 00:00:33.070
There was very little that
made anybody stand out.

11
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.433
So I wanted to say a little bit about
developing portfolio materials and

12
00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:40.298
how to tell your story a little bit more
effectively than what I'm seeing out there

13
00:00:40.298 --> 00:00:40.876
right now.

14
00:00:40.876 --> 00:00:47.399
And I'm going to point out to you that
there is a link here to a Google Doc.

15
00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.045
I'll go through the information in
that some things to think about as you

16
00:00:51.045 --> 00:00:53.151
put together your portfolio materials.

17
00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:56.027
I'd also like to point to
Jerome Hardaway's course,

18
00:00:56.027 --> 00:00:58.715
getting a software engineering job,
which is also

19
00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:03.155
available here at Frontend Masters, which
has great information about resumes and

20
00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:06.549
LinkedIn and GitHub, AI interviewing and
all the rest of that.

21
00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:07.823
&gt;&gt; Mark: Also for free.

22
00:01:07.823 --> 00:01:09.159
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Also for free.

23
00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.331
Strongly recommend that you
take a look at that course if

24
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:15.582
you're serious about making
a real portfolio website.

25
00:01:15.582 --> 00:01:19.479
So let's take a quick peek
at my checklist here.

26
00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.450
I have a check list of things that you
might wanna think about in terms of

27
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.875
building this website.

28
00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:28.165
So first of all, what is your goal for
building this website?

29
00:01:28.165 --> 00:01:32.335
Typically, people are gonna think about,
I want a permanent job or

30
00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:34.319
I just wanna get some side work.

31
00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.985
I have a real job, but I want a little bit
of work on the side for my side hustle.

32
00:01:38.985 --> 00:01:43.045
Or maybe I'm at a transitioning from
one area of focus to another and

33
00:01:43.045 --> 00:01:46.123
I wanna demonstrate expertise
in a specific area.

34
00:01:46.123 --> 00:01:47.895
Maybe I'm looking for a promotion.

35
00:01:47.895 --> 00:01:52.126
All of that is gonna guide what you
wanna think about for your website.

36
00:01:52.126 --> 00:01:56.663
And I'm not gonna spend a whole lot of
time on looking at this cuz I think this

37
00:01:56.663 --> 00:01:59.185
is all relatively self explanatory, but

38
00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:03.167
here's some things to think about
if this is your very first job.

39
00:02:03.167 --> 00:02:08.105
First time that you're perhaps you've
just graduated from a boot camp.

40
00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:09.861
Perhaps you've graduated from college.

41
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:13.635
You've never had a job in the field
of web development before.

42
00:02:13.635 --> 00:02:16.595
These are some things that
you might think about.

43
00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:20.655
Thinking about your new permanent job,
thinking about side work.

44
00:02:20.655 --> 00:02:22.488
Demonstrating your expertise.

45
00:02:22.488 --> 00:02:27.302
This is not a comprehensive list, but
some things that you should keep in mind.

46
00:02:27.302 --> 00:02:31.808
You'll wanna create portfolio
artifacts in order to align your

47
00:02:31.808 --> 00:02:35.404
goal with what you're gonna
show on your website.

48
00:02:35.404 --> 00:02:40.320
Those two things should be in alignment,
and so the kinds of materials you

49
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.490
might wanna put together for your
portfolio would include a very good title.

50
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.917
So the title of each project should
clearly reflect the kind of work done.

51
00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:51.822
So, for example, a good title would be,

52
00:02:51.822 --> 00:02:56.565
using React.js to create an e-commerce
app with physical goods.

53
00:02:56.565 --> 00:02:58.761
I know exactly what that is now, right?

54
00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:01.803
I know exactly,
you're gonna have shipping issues.

55
00:03:01.803 --> 00:03:04.320
You're going to have inventory issues.

56
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.655
I know you're using React,
as opposed to flare website that

57
00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:12.405
doesn't tell me anything
at all about what that is.

58
00:03:12.405 --> 00:03:17.332
So unless you're working with
something that's very recognizable,

59
00:03:17.332 --> 00:03:22.595
like you're talking about Netflix or
McDonald's or IBM or anything else.

60
00:03:22.595 --> 00:03:26.081
It may be sufficient just to say
the name of the company, but

61
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:30.915
if it's not a recognizable name, you'll
want to describe a little bit further.

62
00:03:30.915 --> 00:03:33.018
You'll wanna have a few screenshots.

63
00:03:33.018 --> 00:03:35.625
Your screenshots are useful
as an eye catcher,

64
00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:40.060
even if you're working on something that
doesn't lend itself to a screenshot,

65
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.082
like you're a database developer,

66
00:03:42.082 --> 00:03:46.212
you may still wanna take a few screenshots
of where your data is being used.

67
00:03:46.212 --> 00:03:50.696
And then generally speaking, the way
that we talk about this kind of stuff is

68
00:03:50.696 --> 00:03:55.832
there's a problem, there's a solution, and
then you can spell out all the details.

69
00:03:55.832 --> 00:04:01.996
So the problem was somebody identified
a problem and gave you a problem to solve.

70
00:04:01.996 --> 00:04:04.972
Briefly, this was the solution
that we came up with, and

71
00:04:04.972 --> 00:04:08.816
then you can tell a detailed story about
why that was the right solution and

72
00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:10.865
how you went about solving it so forth.

73
00:04:10.865 --> 00:04:13.314
So I'll let you read a little
bit more about that.

74
00:04:13.314 --> 00:04:15.902
And then finally, a little bit about code.

75
00:04:15.902 --> 00:04:18.982
The easiest thing to do is
just to link to GitHub, but

76
00:04:18.982 --> 00:04:21.648
you can also focus on
smaller chunks of code.

77
00:04:21.648 --> 00:04:25.936
This was a really key piece of code
that made this whole situation work and

78
00:04:25.936 --> 00:04:28.621
this is how exactly that
kind of thing works.

79
00:04:28.621 --> 00:04:30.347
There's an about me section.

80
00:04:30.347 --> 00:04:32.174
In the about me section,

81
00:04:32.174 --> 00:04:36.879
you're going to make sure you have
a good head shot of yourself.

82
00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:41.039
Ideally, you're going to go to
a professional photographer with good

83
00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.895
lighting, you're gonna wear something
that's kind of professional looking and

84
00:04:45.895 --> 00:04:47.995
you'll have your headshot taken.

85
00:04:47.995 --> 00:04:52.073
All the things that apply sort of
generally between personal and

86
00:04:52.073 --> 00:04:54.273
professional photos apply here.

87
00:04:54.273 --> 00:04:57.894
So avoid things like strappy and
sleeveless tops,

88
00:04:57.894 --> 00:05:02.861
avoid your sunglasses, avoid those
blurry photos, or tiny photos or

89
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:06.162
glamour photos or
lots of people in the photo.

90
00:05:06.162 --> 00:05:09.073
You want the most boring
photo of yourself ever.

91
00:05:09.073 --> 00:05:15.020
Yes, your basic self smiling
with professional clothes, okay?

92
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.021
And I would actually argue that
no photo may be better than

93
00:05:18.021 --> 00:05:20.524
using things like cartoons or
illustrations,

94
00:05:20.524 --> 00:05:24.670
unless you are an illustrator and
that's the kind of work that you're doing.

95
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.409
I would also argue that no photo may
be better than anything that's weird,

96
00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:33.848
AI enhanced or generated kind of images or
anything that makes someone

97
00:05:33.848 --> 00:05:37.778
wonder whether you're a real person or
if this is a scam site.

98
00:05:37.778 --> 00:05:40.223
So that's something to think about.

99
00:05:40.223 --> 00:05:40.959
What to say?

100
00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:44.781
There's mostly three or
four sentences of identifying your name,

101
00:05:44.781 --> 00:05:48.336
your current position,
your current company, a few tools and

102
00:05:48.336 --> 00:05:52.627
techniques that you specialize in,
the kind of work you specialize in, and

103
00:05:52.627 --> 00:05:55.463
a word or
two about your educational background.

104
00:05:55.463 --> 00:05:56.692
Yes, Mark.

105
00:05:56.692 --> 00:06:03.930
&gt;&gt; Mark: Could you talk on the portfolio
piece on what projects you should display.

106
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:10.219
From your opinion, how big does a project
have to be in order to be featured?

107
00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:13.883
If it's a small open source contribution,

108
00:06:13.883 --> 00:06:18.345
I don't know,
kind of small versus large projects?

109
00:06:18.345 --> 00:06:20.916
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, so
it all depends, right?

110
00:06:20.916 --> 00:06:25.362
So if you say that you built the Amazon
website, I don't believe you for a second.

111
00:06:25.362 --> 00:06:30.134
You did not build Amazon, but you might
have built one tiny, small feature on

112
00:06:30.134 --> 00:06:34.926
the Amazon website, and maybe your
story focuses on that particular thing.

113
00:06:34.926 --> 00:06:38.053
If you're at boot camp,
maybe you did, in fact,

114
00:06:38.053 --> 00:06:42.669
build a whole entire application based
on your particular boot camp, and

115
00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:46.775
what's going on in the boot camp,
what you were demonstrating.

116
00:06:46.775 --> 00:06:51.490
So that might be something where it looks
like a bigger project than the one tiny

117
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.284
thing that you did in Amazon.

118
00:06:53.284 --> 00:06:55.775
So I wouldn't necessarily
think about scope.

119
00:06:55.775 --> 00:07:00.516
I would think about how well you can
tell the story of the problem that you

120
00:07:00.516 --> 00:07:04.310
were trying to solve,
the solution to that problem, and

121
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.597
any details that you have to say
about that particular problem.

122
00:07:08.597 --> 00:07:12.556
I would also say that you wanna
pick basically those portfolio

123
00:07:12.556 --> 00:07:16.603
items that would help you get
the job that you're looking for.

124
00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:21.488
So you're a full stack developer, but you
really wanna move into the frontend space.

125
00:07:21.488 --> 00:07:27.292
Go and focus on projects that demonstrate
your chops in terms of building UI,

126
00:07:27.292 --> 00:07:30.610
as opposed to building databases, right?

127
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.304
So that's another thing to think about
as you put together your portfolio,

128
00:07:34.304 --> 00:07:36.452
what skills are you trying to demonstrate?

129
00:07:36.452 --> 00:07:40.384
If this is your first job and
you're just coming out of boot camp,

130
00:07:40.384 --> 00:07:45.547
you may have all kinds of different things
inside of your portfolio and that's fine.

131
00:07:45.547 --> 00:07:48.656
That's absolutely fine to
do that kind of thing.

132
00:07:48.656 --> 00:07:53.538
What I would encourage you to do is get
away from all of the class assignments

133
00:07:53.538 --> 00:07:55.552
that your boot camp gave you and

134
00:07:55.552 --> 00:07:59.288
start to focus on maybe some
open source contributions.

135
00:07:59.288 --> 00:08:03.532
Maybe focus on some projects that you've
identified and built on your own, or

136
00:08:03.532 --> 00:08:07.856
maybe some side work that you've done
instead of just showing your classwork.

137
00:08:07.856 --> 00:08:11.663
Because, by the way, there'll be a lot
of people who come from your boot camp

138
00:08:11.663 --> 00:08:13.491
that'll be showing that same work.

139
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:16.588
And then finally, there may be
some other portfolio sections.

140
00:08:16.588 --> 00:08:20.335
These are not going to be on the site
that we're going to build today, but

141
00:08:20.335 --> 00:08:24.216
I just wanted to mention that these
are things that you may want to include.

142
00:08:24.216 --> 00:08:28.743
I'm not saying that my portfolio
design here is the perfect one.

143
00:08:28.743 --> 00:08:30.743
There may be more things
that you wanna show off.

144
00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:34.299
So those might include, again,
those open source contributions.

145
00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:38.724
Maybe you have some kind of formal
educational background that you wanna

146
00:08:38.724 --> 00:08:41.274
highlight or technical volunteer work.

147
00:08:41.274 --> 00:08:44.182
Maybe you want a hackathon,
you wanna talk about that.

148
00:08:44.182 --> 00:08:48.239
Maybe you have other kinds of
awards that you wanna highlight, or

149
00:08:48.239 --> 00:08:51.780
anything else that relates to
your work as a developer and

150
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.976
that will help you further your story and
get a job.

151
00:08:54.976 --> 00:08:56.087
Okay, by the way,

152
00:08:56.087 --> 00:09:00.468
this whole worksheet that I just gave
you could be a whole course by itself.

153
00:09:00.468 --> 00:09:02.719
But fortunately Jerome Hardaway
already made it.

154
00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:05.211
It's the getting a software
engineering job.

155
00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:08.393
So this is just to help
guide your thinking as you

156
00:09:08.393 --> 00:09:12.784
start putting together your own
material to build this website.

157
00:09:12.784 --> 00:09:15.871
And then I would recommend if
you're watching this course,

158
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:17.211
you may wanna pause here.

159
00:09:17.211 --> 00:09:21.972
You may wanna go spend some time
pulling that information together and

160
00:09:21.972 --> 00:09:24.563
then come back and code along with me.
