WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.812
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We finally
have our completed webpage.

2
00:00:02.812 --> 00:00:05.585
We've coded the whole
thing inside of Github and

3
00:00:05.585 --> 00:00:10.125
the next thing to do is actually get it
somewhere that the whole world can see it.

4
00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:12.145
Codepen is not the place for that.

5
00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.432
So that is the next thing that
we're going to walk through and

6
00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:17.310
we're gonna do this in two steps.

7
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.701
One is we need to take
everything out of Codepen and

8
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:26.030
set it up as individual files, which
we're gonna work with inside of VS code,

9
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.181
which is a typical editor that's used for
this kind of work.

10
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:34.953
And then the second part of it is we're
going to move it from our files that

11
00:00:34.953 --> 00:00:39.978
are here on our computer up to GitHub,
and then ultimately to GitHub pages.

12
00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:43.027
And I'm gonna talk about all
those steps in a lot of detail.

13
00:00:43.027 --> 00:00:47.517
But the very first thing that we're going
to do is take this out of CodePen and

14
00:00:47.517 --> 00:00:49.355
set it up as individual files.

15
00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:54.844
So to start with, you are going to want
the finished state of chapter six after

16
00:00:54.844 --> 00:01:00.672
we've gone through and we've put in our
switch and we have all of our tweaks done,

17
00:01:00.672 --> 00:01:06.102
everything is ready to go, this is
where we're starting from here, okay.

18
00:01:06.102 --> 00:01:11.417
All right, so the easiest way
to do this is the following,

19
00:01:11.417 --> 00:01:16.189
and the way that I usually do it,
what I'm going to do

20
00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.979
here is right on my desktop,
you can set up a folder.

21
00:01:22.684 --> 00:01:26.003
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And of course, this is
different on Windows than it is on Mac, so

22
00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:27.484
however you set up a folder.

23
00:01:27.484 --> 00:01:30.757
And you can just call it whatever,
website,

24
00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:33.263
some sort of original name for it.

25
00:01:33.263 --> 00:01:39.508
Inside of your website folder,
we can put in a couple of folders here.

26
00:01:39.508 --> 00:01:43.407
We're gonna want our images,
so I usually call mine img,

27
00:01:43.407 --> 00:01:45.882
you could call it images, the word.

28
00:01:45.882 --> 00:01:50.680
And then typically we also
have a folder for CSS.

29
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.491
So I'm gonna make a folder for
CSS as well.

30
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:58.022
And that'll just be sitting here on my
desktop right here, so there it is.

31
00:01:58.022 --> 00:02:03.436
You're gonna wanna work with a program
that will allow you to write HTML,

32
00:02:03.436 --> 00:02:08.434
CSS, off in JavaScript and
many other languages on your computer.

33
00:02:08.434 --> 00:02:15.372
The one that most people use
these days is Visual Studio Code.

34
00:02:15.372 --> 00:02:20.778
If we google for that,
this is at code.visualstudio.com.

35
00:02:20.778 --> 00:02:24.279
It is a free program,
you can download it right from here.

36
00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:27.838
Mine says, download for Mac because
I'm on a Mac, if you're on Windows,

37
00:02:27.838 --> 00:02:30.281
this will say, download for
Windows, all right.

38
00:02:30.281 --> 00:02:34.708
You can download this and
install it on your computer,

39
00:02:34.708 --> 00:02:38.566
this will allow you to
assemble your web pages.

40
00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:43.903
So I am going to open up my copy of
VS Code, and once you have it installed

41
00:02:43.903 --> 00:02:49.247
on your computer, you will see
something probably kind of like this.

42
00:02:49.247 --> 00:02:52.634
And the easiest thing to
do to get going is just to

43
00:02:52.634 --> 00:02:56.277
grab your folder right from
the desktop and drag and

44
00:02:56.277 --> 00:03:00.614
drop it over here in this left column,
we just drag and drop.

45
00:03:00.614 --> 00:03:02.486
It may give you an error like this,

46
00:03:02.486 --> 00:03:05.659
do you wanna save your workspace
configuration as a file?

47
00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.876
If you all know what you're doing,
you do you.

48
00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:11.926
For those of you who are new to this
process, I'm just gonna say don't save.

49
00:03:11.926 --> 00:03:17.892
Okay, so this is gonna give us our folders
over hereas, there's nothing in them yet,

50
00:03:17.892 --> 00:03:22.160
it gives me a folder for CSS and
it gives me a folder for images.

51
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.564
All right, I'm gonna start by creating
a new text file here inside of VS code,

52
00:03:28.564 --> 00:03:32.946
and it's gonna say,
select a language or whatever.

53
00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:36.676
So I am going to say File Save, and

54
00:03:36.676 --> 00:03:42.141
I'm gonna put this right
in my website folder and

55
00:03:42.141 --> 00:03:46.955
I'm going to call this file index.html.

56
00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:53.015
So this is really important,
you wanna call it index.html.

57
00:03:53.015 --> 00:03:57.004
That will be the page that
loads when your website loads.

58
00:03:57.004 --> 00:04:02.569
If you call it anything else, if you call
it gen.html, if you call it, whatever.

59
00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.793
It will not load automatically
when your website loads.

60
00:04:06.793 --> 00:04:10.884
This is what we wanna do,
it has to be called index.html.

61
00:04:10.884 --> 00:04:17.503
And we're gonna say Save, and it should be
there installed on your computer, okay?

62
00:04:17.503 --> 00:04:20.254
The next thing that I do,
let's give it a try.

63
00:04:20.254 --> 00:04:24.957
I'm gonna hit an exclamation point,
single exclamation point, and

64
00:04:24.957 --> 00:04:27.517
then click the tab key on my computer.

65
00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:33.329
So single exclamation point and
the tab key on the computer and

66
00:04:33.329 --> 00:04:38.468
this should give you all of your HTML,
both the head and

67
00:04:38.468 --> 00:04:42.627
the body of your HTML
here inside of VS code.

68
00:04:42.627 --> 00:04:47.674
All right, so now if you've gotten
this far, we are at the easy point.

69
00:04:47.674 --> 00:04:51.262
So what we're going to do now
is copy over our HTML, and

70
00:04:51.262 --> 00:04:56.181
then we're gonna copy over our CSS, and
then we need to work on our images.

71
00:04:56.181 --> 00:05:01.072
So I'm gonna go back to my window here,

72
00:05:01.072 --> 00:05:04.942
and I'm going to go to my HTML.

73
00:05:04.942 --> 00:05:11.314
And I'm just gonna do Control or
Command A to select everything here,

74
00:05:11.314 --> 00:05:16.930
Control or Command C to copy and
come here into index dot HTML,

75
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.073
and Control or Command V to paste.

76
00:05:20.073 --> 00:05:23.923
And so you'll see how all of our
HTML code will show up here.

77
00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:30.123
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If things are scrolling all
the way over to the side and that annoys

78
00:05:30.123 --> 00:05:34.409
you, you can always turn on your word
wrapping that's under view, word wrap.

79
00:05:37.114 --> 00:05:42.024
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then probably pretty
key here on line six is our title, or

80
00:05:42.024 --> 00:05:43.091
HTML title.

81
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:47.779
I'm gonna change that to be brissa

82
00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:52.629
is Sid rose website, or actually,

83
00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:59.913
I'll say portfolio react developer,
or whatever.

84
00:05:59.913 --> 00:06:04.864
You can put in, this is a place that
Google tends to look for keywords.

85
00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:07.376
So put in some keywords so
people can find you.

86
00:06:07.376 --> 00:06:10.418
So now that we've got that in place,

87
00:06:10.418 --> 00:06:14.353
the next thing we need to
do is copy over our CSS.

88
00:06:14.353 --> 00:06:18.238
And so once again,
we're gonna go back to our code pen.

89
00:06:18.238 --> 00:06:20.709
I'm going to open up my CSS.

90
00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:24.140
So I'm going to select everything,
copy it, and

91
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.973
I'm gonna go back to VS code, and
I'm going to create a new document.

92
00:06:28.973 --> 00:06:34.265
Just use the new document
button right here, and

93
00:06:34.265 --> 00:06:39.298
I can call this styles,
styles, dot css, and

94
00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:44.589
I'm gonna drag and
drop that into my CSS folder,

95
00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:47.324
yes, please move that.

96
00:06:47.324 --> 00:06:52.538
And then into this I can
paste all of my styles.

97
00:06:52.538 --> 00:06:57.485
All right, we'll save that.

98
00:06:57.485 --> 00:07:01.994
Okay, so
now I have an index.html that contains all

99
00:07:01.994 --> 00:07:06.820
the HTML from my code pen in
between body and slash body.

100
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.372
And I have all of the CSS that I've
created in a file called styles.css.

101
00:07:12.372 --> 00:07:14.534
And these two things
are hanging out there.

102
00:07:14.534 --> 00:07:18.914
Yay, they don't talk to each other, right?

103
00:07:18.914 --> 00:07:22.120
Now we need to link them together so
that they talk to each other.

104
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.910
To do that, we're going to add that right
here into the head of our document.

105
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:32.537
And this is going to be link href equals,

106
00:07:32.537 --> 00:07:40.490
we're gonna go to
css/styles.css rel=stylesheet.

107
00:07:43.441 --> 00:07:49.267
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So that will link the two
things together, that one line of code.

108
00:07:49.267 --> 00:07:54.168
Another extension that I have installed
is the ability just to view this

109
00:07:54.168 --> 00:07:56.463
HTML directly in my web browser.

110
00:07:56.463 --> 00:08:01.684
That is here, it's called Tech.

111
00:08:01.684 --> 00:08:04.723
I believe, is the name of the company, and

112
00:08:04.723 --> 00:08:09.210
the name of the extension is Open
in Browser right here, okay?

113
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:14.204
And what that will do is give
you the ability to right

114
00:08:14.204 --> 00:08:17.581
click on this, and I can say open.

115
00:08:17.581 --> 00:08:21.451
In my case, I'm gonna open it in Chrome,
and boom, there it is.

116
00:08:21.451 --> 00:08:23.144
Yes, so it's open in Chrome.

117
00:08:23.144 --> 00:08:27.995
Okay, now sharp eyes are gonna notice

118
00:08:27.995 --> 00:08:33.156
that this is actually not the same font.

119
00:08:33.156 --> 00:08:37.718
This is probably Helvetica, and
the reason why is because we haven't

120
00:08:37.718 --> 00:08:40.826
actually linked to our
font from Google Fonts.

121
00:08:40.826 --> 00:08:44.760
So let's get that done now.

122
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:51.637
If I go to fonts.google.com,
we are going to search for the Inter.

123
00:08:51.637 --> 00:08:55.598
Inter is the name of our font, okay?

124
00:08:55.598 --> 00:08:58.583
And that is the one that
we're going to wanna get.

125
00:08:58.583 --> 00:09:00.808
So we're gonna click on get font.

126
00:09:00.808 --> 00:09:03.047
There's a lot of ways you can do this.

127
00:09:03.047 --> 00:09:05.195
You can download it, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

128
00:09:05.195 --> 00:09:06.731
We're just gonna do the simple way.

129
00:09:06.731 --> 00:09:09.562
We're gonna get the embed code, and

130
00:09:09.562 --> 00:09:15.605
we're going to get the link here that that
is in the head of your HTML document.

131
00:09:15.605 --> 00:09:22.479
So I'm gonna just copy that embed code for
the head of your HTML.

132
00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:25.720
And I'm going to add that here.

133
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:31.423
I usually put it before my custom
style sheet, so there it is.

134
00:09:31.423 --> 00:09:35.605
If you're wondering where
that was in CodePen,

135
00:09:35.605 --> 00:09:40.909
this is a setting that you can put in so
here, under settings,

136
00:09:40.909 --> 00:09:45.499
under CSS, if you scroll down,
if you have the URL for

137
00:09:45.499 --> 00:09:50.293
your font, which case starts with fonts,
dot google,

138
00:09:50.293 --> 00:09:54.577
apis.com, you can copy and
paste this in here and

139
00:09:54.577 --> 00:09:59.286
you have linked to the Google
font that you want to use.

140
00:09:59.286 --> 00:10:04.907
In our case, so you never actually saw
that link here inside of this code pen,

141
00:10:04.907 --> 00:10:09.678
but that's not gonna help us when
we carry over here into VS code.

142
00:10:09.678 --> 00:10:13.975
So we need to make sure that we link to
our font here in the head of our document

143
00:10:13.975 --> 00:10:14.532
as well.

144
00:10:14.532 --> 00:10:17.444
Once that's done,
then that should be working correctly.

145
00:10:17.444 --> 00:10:23.000
Next thing we need to do is we
need to take a look at our images.

146
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.176
So right now, I have no images
here inside of VS Code, but

147
00:10:27.176 --> 00:10:30.405
I have images that
are inside of my CodePen.

148
00:10:30.405 --> 00:10:33.238
So I'm gonna go back to my CodePen.

149
00:10:36.976 --> 00:10:42.007
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Get VS Code
out of the way here.

150
00:10:42.007 --> 00:10:47.495
And inside of my website folder,
inside of my images folder here,

151
00:10:47.495 --> 00:10:52.199
I am going to, I can actually
do this right here on my Mac,

152
00:10:52.199 --> 00:10:57.491
I'm not sure if this is a Windows thing,
but you can just drag and

153
00:10:57.491 --> 00:11:02.983
drop these from here on your Mac,
drag them right into the folder.

154
00:11:02.983 --> 00:11:07.935
If that is not an option for you, then
you can right click on these images and

155
00:11:07.935 --> 00:11:11.706
there's probably like a save
image as kind of thing, and

156
00:11:11.706 --> 00:11:14.792
you wanna save those
into your images folder.

157
00:11:14.792 --> 00:11:17.758
So I'm going to pull down.

158
00:11:17.758 --> 00:11:20.431
There was the picture of Brissa.

159
00:11:20.431 --> 00:11:24.283
There's the picture of these projects.

160
00:11:26.437 --> 00:11:30.469
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Because we've have our
SVGs directly inside of our HTML.

161
00:11:30.469 --> 00:11:32.089
We don't need to pull those down.

162
00:11:32.089 --> 00:11:35.261
So I think there's just four images here.

163
00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:40.011
On the site,
do we have a place where we can copy that?

164
00:11:40.011 --> 00:11:41.566
That's a very good question.

165
00:11:41.566 --> 00:11:44.628
So where do images come from on CodePen?

166
00:11:44.628 --> 00:11:50.481
If you have a free account, you cannot
put your own images inside of CodePen.

167
00:11:50.481 --> 00:11:52.047
You actually have to have a paid account.

168
00:11:52.047 --> 00:11:55.828
If you have a paid account,
there is an option here for assets and

169
00:11:55.828 --> 00:11:58.502
you can upload your
images here directly in.

170
00:11:58.502 --> 00:12:03.052
So because I have a paid account,
and you forked a copy of my work.

171
00:12:03.052 --> 00:12:06.618
You have access to these images as well,
yeah?

172
00:12:06.618 --> 00:12:11.466
But you won't be able to add your own
images to CodePen without getting

173
00:12:11.466 --> 00:12:12.627
a paid account.

174
00:12:12.627 --> 00:12:17.915
You can use an absolute path to images
elsewhere on the internet though,

175
00:12:17.915 --> 00:12:18.878
if you want.

176
00:12:18.878 --> 00:12:22.772
Okay, so here then inside of VS code,

177
00:12:22.772 --> 00:12:30.200
you should have your images that you
just downloaded from your CodePen,

178
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.964
and now we just need to
find those images here.

179
00:12:34.964 --> 00:12:40.530
All right, so in line 56 I have noticed
that this is calling an absolute path.

180
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:45.306
So this is calling my image right from
CodePen and I don't wanna do that,

181
00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:48.296
I wanna call it from my
local copy of my image.

182
00:12:48.296 --> 00:12:53.055
So this is just gonna be img/brissa or

183
00:12:53.055 --> 00:12:58.569
fem frontend masters fem.brissa.jpeg.

184
00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:03.129
All right, and we'll just replace that for
our other items as well.

185
00:13:18.723 --> 00:13:22.943
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so that should
now be pointing to your local copy.

186
00:13:22.943 --> 00:13:28.871
[COUGH] And if we refresh,
we'll get the inter font and

187
00:13:28.871 --> 00:13:33.891
these should all be now local images,
okay.

188
00:13:37.106 --> 00:13:39.178
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How's everybody doing so
far?

189
00:13:39.178 --> 00:13:42.212
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do we have to
log in to get the images?

190
00:13:42.212 --> 00:13:45.230
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No,
you should be able to just right click,

191
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.196
right-click on any image.

192
00:13:47.196 --> 00:13:48.141
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

193
00:13:48.141 --> 00:13:50.246
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, and just save images.

194
00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:54.571
Yeah, okay, so briefly here,

195
00:13:54.571 --> 00:13:59.063
then we have done the following.

196
00:13:59.063 --> 00:14:04.200
We downloaded VS code,
we set up a folder that had folders for

197
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.634
CSS and images inside of it.

198
00:14:06.634 --> 00:14:11.596
We created a file, we copied our
HTML into that file, we added to it,

199
00:14:11.596 --> 00:14:17.587
we added our links to our Google font, and
we added a link to our custom style sheet,

200
00:14:17.587 --> 00:14:22.467
which we also created by creating
a separate document, copying and

201
00:14:22.467 --> 00:14:25.067
pasting over our CSS from CodePen.

202
00:14:25.067 --> 00:14:29.255
We downloaded all of the images
that were there on our design and

203
00:14:29.255 --> 00:14:31.792
we saved them into our images folder.

204
00:14:31.792 --> 00:14:34.767
So we're now completely
disentangled from CodePen.

205
00:14:34.767 --> 00:14:40.326
We now have a complete local website here,
living on our computer inside of vs.code
