WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.201 --> 00:00:04.432
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so moving on to
our next step, now what we need to have is

2
00:00:04.432 --> 00:00:09.131
we need the way to actually change
the color scheme on the web page itself.

3
00:00:09.131 --> 00:00:12.797
People aren't gonna know that the
different color schemes are available in

4
00:00:12.797 --> 00:00:14.464
your operating system settings.

5
00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:18.026
So, we need a way to change those
things on the screen itself.

6
00:00:18.026 --> 00:00:23.569
And there is something really important
to remember here as we go forward.

7
00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:25.446
If you are working in JavaScript,

8
00:00:25.446 --> 00:00:29.084
you are probably familiar with
the concept of a JavaScript event.

9
00:00:29.084 --> 00:00:33.220
When something is clicked, something
happens, when something is hovered,

10
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.422
when a key is pressed, so on and so forth.

11
00:00:35.422 --> 00:00:38.294
We have none of those things in CSS.

12
00:00:38.294 --> 00:00:41.434
All we have in CSS are states.

13
00:00:41.434 --> 00:00:43.451
This is the hover state.

14
00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:47.210
This is the state when a radio
button is checked, right?

15
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.772
This is what we have.

16
00:00:48.772 --> 00:00:53.769
So, in order for us to make a switcher
that will work in just CSS,

17
00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.319
we probably need to leverage
those particular features.

18
00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:04.724
And one of the things that we have is
a pseudo-class that's called checked.

19
00:01:04.724 --> 00:01:05.806
In other words,

20
00:01:05.806 --> 00:01:10.457
we can style things in a certain way
if something is checked on the page.

21
00:01:10.457 --> 00:01:12.493
But we do not have an unchecked.

22
00:01:12.493 --> 00:01:17.425
[LAUGH] So we have checked,
but no unchecked.

23
00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:20.876
So what we need now,
is we need two radio buttons.

24
00:01:20.876 --> 00:01:24.759
We can style a page one way if
one radio button is checked.

25
00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.828
We can style a page differently if
a different radio button is checked,

26
00:01:29.828 --> 00:01:30.849
makes sense?

27
00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:33.685
So, we need two radio buttons in
order to make that magic happen.

28
00:01:33.685 --> 00:01:37.916
So, let's walk through how we
would go about coding that.

29
00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:45.776
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So, here in our HTML,
just before our article,

30
00:01:45.776 --> 00:01:48.231
let's flatten these up.

31
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:53.915
I am going to add a header element,
because this is kind of a header for

32
00:01:53.915 --> 00:02:00.105
the web page, and then inside of that
header, I am going to add a field set.

33
00:02:00.105 --> 00:02:06.872
I'm gonna give it an ID of
mode switcher as one does.

34
00:02:06.872 --> 00:02:10.324
Field set is the box that goes
all the way around things, so

35
00:02:10.324 --> 00:02:13.160
you'll see the box up here,
there on the page.

36
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.062
And of course we end that
with a slash field set.

37
00:02:19.476 --> 00:02:21.949
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
then inside our field set,

38
00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:25.097
we can give that immediately a legend.

39
00:02:25.097 --> 00:02:31.727
And this is for accessibility purposes,
select a color mode.

40
00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:41.165
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
all that formatting happens automatically.

41
00:02:41.165 --> 00:02:43.993
That's what the raw HTML looks like.

42
00:02:43.993 --> 00:02:47.579
And then inside of this,
I'm gonna put in a div.

43
00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.066
I'm not even gonna give it a class
because I'm never gonna use it for

44
00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:52.115
any kinda styling.

45
00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:56.239
This is just to group two pieces of
information that we need in order to make

46
00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.045
this radio button accessible.

47
00:02:58.045 --> 00:03:00.576
Thing number one is the button itself.

48
00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:04.371
So I'm gonna say input type equals radio.

49
00:03:07.223 --> 00:03:11.237
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
I'm gonna give it an ID, and

50
00:03:11.237 --> 00:03:17.038
cuz I'm creative, I'm gonna call it light,

51
00:03:17.038 --> 00:03:22.093
and I'm gonna give it a name of mode, and

52
00:03:22.093 --> 00:03:28.528
I'm gonna give it a value,
value of light, okay?

53
00:03:28.528 --> 00:03:34.447
So, now we have one
radio button [LAUGH] And

54
00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:38.846
then I'll give this a legend or

55
00:03:38.846 --> 00:03:44.099
a label, sorry, a label for light.

56
00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.723
And this will be light.

57
00:03:50.723 --> 00:03:54.497
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so the reason
you do it this way, you connected

58
00:03:54.497 --> 00:03:59.580
the label, the word light, that you can
actually read on the screen via the for

59
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.895
attribute there, you're connecting
it to the radio button, and

60
00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:06.924
this makes this radio
button now accessible.

61
00:04:06.924 --> 00:04:10.925
Rather than just a radio button hanging
out in space, we know that the label

62
00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:15.193
is attached to that radio button, so
there's our label there, called light.

63
00:04:15.193 --> 00:04:20.667
And if you want to give this a value
of checked, by default you can do that.

64
00:04:20.667 --> 00:04:24.633
This is our default radio button, okay?

65
00:04:24.633 --> 00:04:28.071
I'm gonna copy and
paste all of that code that I just wrote.

66
00:04:32.386 --> 00:04:35.577
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And here,
I'm gonna make a few changes.

67
00:04:35.577 --> 00:04:40.830
So this one is going to have
the same input type of radio.

68
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.050
The ID here though, is going to be dark,
and the value is gonna be dark.

69
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.139
And it will not be checked, cuz that is
bad, you only want one checked at a time.

70
00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.579
And then the label for
dark will have a value of dark.

71
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:02.375
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so

72
00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:06.799
just a little field set with
a couple of radio buttons in it.

73
00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:09.972
Any questions on that?

74
00:05:09.972 --> 00:05:12.602
This is a piece of HTML,
it's pretty typical.

75
00:05:12.602 --> 00:05:16.486
You've probably run into it
somewhere along the way, okay?

76
00:05:16.486 --> 00:05:21.454
All right, now I wanna make these two
radio buttons go side by side, right?

77
00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:23.299
Always the next thing you wanna do.

78
00:05:23.299 --> 00:05:26.931
And so we wanna take a look
at our parents and children.

79
00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:30.006
Our field set goes all
the way around everything.

80
00:05:30.006 --> 00:05:33.916
The legend is coded by your browser
to appear where it does, actually,

81
00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:35.363
right on that line there.

82
00:05:35.363 --> 00:05:38.595
So we actually don't need to worry
about that in terms of our layout.

83
00:05:38.595 --> 00:05:43.026
So now what I'm going to do is use
Flexbox to put these two radio

84
00:05:43.026 --> 00:05:45.852
buttons side by side, horizontally.

85
00:05:45.852 --> 00:05:50.240
We can also make this not stretch
all the way across the page,

86
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.320
we can make it a smaller box.

87
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.771
We can have it center on mobile
instead of the way it looks now.

88
00:05:56.771 --> 00:05:59.181
So let's add some CSS to make that happen.

89
00:06:04.932 --> 00:06:08.050
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm gonna scroll
down to just before my media query.

90
00:06:11.974 --> 00:06:14.260
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Light/dark button.

91
00:06:17.268 --> 00:06:22.520
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so what I'm gonna
do here is I'm gonna add a fieldset.

92
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.315
So we wanna have on the page,
so I don't need a class.

93
00:06:26.315 --> 00:06:31.187
Display of flex, flex,

94
00:06:31.187 --> 00:06:34.667
flow, row wrap,

95
00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:41.630
justify-content center, yeah?

96
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.265
Super pretty.

97
00:06:44.265 --> 00:06:50.848
And then we give it a gap, 3rem.

98
00:06:50.848 --> 00:06:52.887
Pushes them apart, okay?

99
00:06:52.887 --> 00:06:59.063
And then we can give them a max width,
300 pixels,

100
00:06:59.063 --> 00:07:03.326
and a margin of 0, 0, 5rem auto.

101
00:07:03.326 --> 00:07:08.298
[LAUGH] Okay, so
that crazy thing there, the top is 0,

102
00:07:08.298 --> 00:07:11.766
the right is 0, the bottom is 5rem.

103
00:07:11.766 --> 00:07:16.938
So we've pushed down the text away
from the box, and then auto would

104
00:07:16.938 --> 00:07:22.400
push it all the way over to, is on
the left side, and push it over there.

105
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.624
For mobile purposes,
we can make this auto-auto,

106
00:07:27.624 --> 00:07:30.957
and that would center it, okay?

107
00:07:30.957 --> 00:07:35.791
Now comes the most amazing thing ever,
which is, we have these buttons here.

108
00:07:35.791 --> 00:07:38.951
They say light and dark mode, but
they don't do anything yet, okay?

109
00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:41.214
So we've coded them up.

110
00:07:41.214 --> 00:07:42.316
They're ready to go.

111
00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:46.299
Now we need to attach these radio buttons
to the code that says be in the light mode

112
00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:47.195
or the dark mode.

113
00:07:47.195 --> 00:07:48.926
How do we go about doing that?

114
00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:54.896
The most amazing two lines
of CSS you've ever seen.

115
00:07:54.896 --> 00:08:01.182
All right, so I'm gonna put that back
up here towards the top of my document.

116
00:08:01.182 --> 00:08:03.933
In fact, right after HTML.

117
00:08:03.933 --> 00:08:09.018
And the two most amazing
lines of CSS you've ever seen

118
00:08:09.018 --> 00:08:14.450
are as follows, HTML has,
always a good start, right?

119
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:21.377
We love the has selector, and
then we're gonna say our mode switcher,

120
00:08:21.377 --> 00:08:26.122
that's the ID of that box there,
the field set.

121
00:08:26.122 --> 00:08:29.354
And we're doing this for
purposes of the cascade,

122
00:08:29.354 --> 00:08:32.449
that's where we're working
with the IDs here.

123
00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:35.768
And then I'm going to
say the light button,

124
00:08:35.768 --> 00:08:41.342
remember our light radio button has an ID,
and we're gonna say checked.

125
00:08:41.342 --> 00:08:49.508
So, in other words, when the light radio
button is checked in that field set,

126
00:08:49.508 --> 00:08:54.581
if such a thing exists
anywhere here in our HTML,

127
00:08:54.581 --> 00:08:59.802
then we are going to say
the color scheme is light.

128
00:08:59.802 --> 00:09:02.618
Whoa, look at that.

129
00:09:02.618 --> 00:09:04.817
That's amazing, right?

130
00:09:04.817 --> 00:09:09.889
Okay, when I go back to my dark button,
it actually did switch back to dark.

131
00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:14.639
But we can also write that
selector as well, okay?

132
00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:18.803
And the reason the dark button
worked here, in my case,

133
00:09:18.803 --> 00:09:21.650
is because I have dark mode turned on.

134
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:25.877
So if I go back to light mode and
I switched to my dark button,

135
00:09:25.877 --> 00:09:28.340
it doesn't work anymore, okay?

136
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.702
And that's why that didn't work.

137
00:09:30.702 --> 00:09:35.711
The reason is, remember, in CSS,
we have a pseudo-class for

138
00:09:35.711 --> 00:09:40.829
checked, we do not have a pseudo-class for
unchecked, okay?

139
00:09:40.829 --> 00:09:46.451
So what we're gonna have to
do is duplicate the style,

140
00:09:46.451 --> 00:09:53.187
and this time we're gonna say
dark checked, color scheme dark.

141
00:09:53.187 --> 00:09:58.911
And now we have ability to toggle
between our two color modes.

142
00:09:58.911 --> 00:10:03.823
[SOUND] Yay, yay.

143
00:10:03.823 --> 00:10:05.236
Applause, everybody, right?

144
00:10:05.236 --> 00:10:06.594
Isn't that amazing?

145
00:10:06.594 --> 00:10:10.207
That's the most fun thing
we've done all day.

146
00:10:10.207 --> 00:10:12.477
All right, that's really amazing.

147
00:10:12.477 --> 00:10:14.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Chat says
it's a great use of has.

148
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.180
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It is an amazing
use of has, isn't it?

149
00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.586
Very, very cool stuff.

150
00:10:21.586 --> 00:10:25.097
And of course, then we can style
this up to work in responsive mode.

151
00:10:25.097 --> 00:10:26.726
Right now, it's just in the center.

152
00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:30.813
I'm actually not gonna spend any more time
styling this because the next thing I know

153
00:10:30.813 --> 00:10:32.728
you want is you want this to be a switch.

154
00:10:32.728 --> 00:10:37.147
[LAUGH] And it's not yet a switch.

155
00:10:37.147 --> 00:10:40.663
Are there questions as to why
this works with radio buttons?

156
00:10:40.663 --> 00:10:47.183
Why we needed two radio buttons and the
bits and pieces that make this all flow?

157
00:10:47.183 --> 00:10:51.300
Any questions on any of
that at this point, good?

158
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.867
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just impressed,
they're shocked.

159
00:10:53.867 --> 00:10:56.518
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,
it's so much fun, isn't it?

160
00:10:56.518 --> 00:11:00.683
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, I always thought this,
I did this before, but with JavaScript,

161
00:11:00.683 --> 00:11:03.431
I didn't know you can only
do with HTML and CSS?

162
00:11:03.431 --> 00:11:05.073
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's relatively new.

163
00:11:05.073 --> 00:11:09.857
So there's a bunch of things here,
the light dark function,

164
00:11:09.857 --> 00:11:12.068
the color scheme, and has.

165
00:11:12.068 --> 00:11:15.619
All of these things are relatively
new in the last couple of years.

166
00:11:15.619 --> 00:11:21.417
So it hasn't been possible until
just recently to do this with CSS.

167
00:11:21.417 --> 00:11:23.900
But it's a great technique, yeah?

168
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.855
We don't need to mess
with JavaScript anymore,

169
00:11:26.855 --> 00:11:29.024
we'll just do it in CSS now, yeah.

170
00:11:29.024 --> 00:11:31.171
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah,
introducing a lot of good things.

171
00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:33.531
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right, right?

172
00:11:33.531 --> 00:11:36.489
We're changing the color scheme,
that is inherently CSS.

173
00:11:36.489 --> 00:11:38.908
Why do we have to mess with JavaScript,
right?
