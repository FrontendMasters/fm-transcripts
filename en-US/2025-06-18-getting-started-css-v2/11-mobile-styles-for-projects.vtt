00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.542
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So, to this now,
we can work on our styling.

2
00:00:03.542 --> 00:00:08.200
And if we go to Part 2 here,
as it's gonna say we're gonna work,

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.313
of course, on our mobile dimensions and
then our desktop dimensions.

4
00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:15.042
And I will walk you through all of that.

5
00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:16.813
That's where you find the code pens.

6
00:00:16.813 --> 00:00:19.450
The images are up here at the top.

7
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.957
So we're gonna start by doing a layout
that looks like this for mobile.

8
00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:29.434
So we wanna have the image on the top,
we wanna have the text underneath.

9
00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:32.766
[COUGH] However,
if we take a look at our HTML,

10
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:38.555
you'll notice the way that our project is
set up is that the text is on the top and

11
00:00:38.555 --> 00:00:43.331
the images underneath,
we want the reverse for mobile, okay?

12
00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:46.904
Now, why did we do it this way?

13
00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:50.830
Couldn't we just take the image and
just cut the image?

14
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.723
We could take just like this, we could
drop the image right here inside of

15
00:00:55.723 --> 00:01:00.233
our code, and then definitely our
image will be on top of our text.

16
00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:02.329
We could do that.

17
00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.151
However, what we wanna do is
think about search engines and

18
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:07.993
accessibility once again.

19
00:01:07.993 --> 00:01:11.035
And in this case,
what I'd like to do is lead with

20
00:01:11.035 --> 00:01:15.356
all of the text that describes
the project and finish with the image.

21
00:01:15.356 --> 00:01:21.565
So, what I can do then is, using grid, I
can swap those to go in a different order.

22
00:01:21.565 --> 00:01:25.802
So, I've actually got the HTML
in the order that I want,

23
00:01:25.802 --> 00:01:30.481
which a screen reader or
Google will wind up reading this page,

24
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:33.600
it is in the order that I want it in,
okay?

25
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.142
So, just something to keep in mind.

26
00:01:36.142 --> 00:01:40.048
All right, so
let's write a little bit of CSS then, and

27
00:01:40.048 --> 00:01:45.968
I'm gonna scroll on down to just before my
media query, and I can add a comment here.

28
00:01:45.968 --> 00:01:47.783
This is my project section.

29
00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:55.964
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
then let's add some CSS.

30
00:01:55.964 --> 00:02:01.107
So, where I'm gonna start
is with my main element.

31
00:02:01.107 --> 00:02:04.170
And I'm going to give it
a little bit of margin and

32
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.443
align my content in the center once again,
cuz for mobile devices.

33
00:02:08.443 --> 00:02:13.564
So margin-top, 5rem,

34
00:02:13.564 --> 00:02:19.152
margin-bottom 3rem, and

35
00:02:19.152 --> 00:02:25.214
text-align center, right?

36
00:02:25.214 --> 00:02:27.401
So, that is starting us off.

37
00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:34.412
Just those three little styles starts
us off getting this all together.

38
00:02:34.412 --> 00:02:39.035
Now we can focus on each one
of the projects individually.

39
00:02:39.035 --> 00:02:44.209
And remember that our projects
have a class called project,

40
00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.563
that's for each individual project.

41
00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:53.356
So from practical CSS layouts to
the bottom of the image is our project.

42
00:02:53.356 --> 00:03:00.453
So we can give this
a background color of white.

43
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.608
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Because each
of our projects has a bit of

44
00:03:07.608 --> 00:03:11.542
a background color in our design here.

45
00:03:15.106 --> 00:03:18.386
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We'll give it some padding,
let's say 3rem.

46
00:03:18.386 --> 00:03:20.986
We'll give it our border radius.

47
00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:28.710
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Which, remember,
we had set up as a variable, corners.

48
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.783
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So that's a pretty
good start right there, yeah?

49
00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:40.755
We have our white background,
just take us many styles either.

50
00:03:40.755 --> 00:03:41.429
Look at that,

51
00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:44.924
we wrote main in project and a lot of
the styling is already there in place.

52
00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:48.574
So, our text is all centered.

53
00:03:48.574 --> 00:03:53.269
We, of course, need to spend some
time styling our techniques here, and

54
00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.629
we have the image right underneath.

55
00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.554
But what we don't have is we don't have
space in between each one of these

56
00:04:00.554 --> 00:04:01.374
projects.

57
00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:05.452
And the space in between these would
be helpful to give us a little bit of

58
00:04:05.452 --> 00:04:07.123
separation between those.

59
00:04:07.123 --> 00:04:09.952
Also, we'll need to give
ourselves a little bit

60
00:04:09.952 --> 00:04:12.853
of space in between our tags and
our image as well.

61
00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:16.909
So let's do that first
between our tags and

62
00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:21.198
our image,
let's add a little bit of space.

63
00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:26.284
And we'll do that with display

64
00:04:26.284 --> 00:04:32.350
grid, grid-template-columns,

65
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.466
1fr, and gap, 3rem.

66
00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:42.196
So, that'll give us now some space in
between all of our text and our image.

67
00:04:42.196 --> 00:04:46.895
So, next is our projects are all
a little bit close together, and

68
00:04:46.895 --> 00:04:51.004
I am going to give that a little
bit of separation as well.

69
00:04:51.004 --> 00:04:56.503
So that's our class of project,
and we'll give that,

70
00:04:56.503 --> 00:05:00.140
oops, sorry, projects, plural.

71
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.210
And here I'll give this a display,

72
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.257
flex, flex-flow.

73
00:05:08.257 --> 00:05:12.617
We'll put it in a column so
that they're stacked on top of each other.

74
00:05:12.617 --> 00:05:17.270
And I'm gonna say no wrap,
because I never want these to wrap.

75
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.094
I don't want the columns
to wrap next to each other,

76
00:05:20.094 --> 00:05:22.092
I want them to be in a column forever.

77
00:05:22.092 --> 00:05:25.079
And then finally,

78
00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:29.936
we can give them a gap of 3rem.

79
00:05:29.936 --> 00:05:34.092
So now we've got our little projects
all stacked on top of each other,

80
00:05:34.092 --> 00:05:35.438
looking pretty good.
