1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.085
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,
so I'm gonna go to Github.

2
00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:08.388
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And if this is new to you,
click the Sign Up button and

3
00:00:08.388 --> 00:00:09.768
go sign up for it.

4
00:00:09.768 --> 00:00:14.621
If you already have a Github account,

5
00:00:14.621 --> 00:00:20.240
then you can click on Sign In and
log in to it.

6
00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:26.871
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so
you're here inside of GitHub.

7
00:00:26.871 --> 00:00:29.979
You've created your account,
you've logged in.

8
00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:34.443
The next thing that you need
to do is create a repository.

9
00:00:34.443 --> 00:00:37.487
So we're gonna go to github.com/new.

10
00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:42.570
So I'm gonna go to github.com/new or
click the big green New button right here.

11
00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:49.588
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And at that point you are
going to, in the repository name field,

12
00:00:49.588 --> 00:00:55.962
enter your username, whatever the username
is that you created.github.io.

13
00:00:55.962 --> 00:00:58.723
So I'm Jennifer web on GitHub.

14
00:00:58.723 --> 00:01:01.472
So I'm gonna say Jenniferweb.github.io.

15
00:01:01.472 --> 00:01:09.485
So I would do something
like Jen4web.github.io.

16
00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:13.263
And it says that that already exists on
this account because it already does.

17
00:01:13.263 --> 00:01:16.006
It won't say that for
you [LAUGH] all right?

18
00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:20.895
So try creating that repository name with
your own username as the first part of it.

19
00:01:20.895 --> 00:01:23.251
All right, and
then down here at the bottom,

20
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:26.048
you feel free to do any of
the things that you wanna do.

21
00:01:26.048 --> 00:01:29.784
And then you're going to
create the repository, okay?

22
00:01:29.784 --> 00:01:34.657
So you should wind up with
a screen that looks like this.

23
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.120
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And I think that's
all we have to do at that point.

24
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.069
Now we're gonna download Github Desktop.

25
00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:49.745
This is at desktop.github.io.

26
00:01:49.745 --> 00:01:53.046
There should be a button
here to Download Now,

27
00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:57.798
if you've never done this before,
if you have, you're like me.

28
00:01:59.708 --> 00:02:01.266
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then you can open it up.

29
00:02:04.396 --> 00:02:04.978
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,

30
00:02:04.978 --> 00:02:10.221
then we're gonna go to set up
the repository in GitHub Desktop.

31
00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:12.683
So on the screen we were just on,

32
00:02:12.683 --> 00:02:17.170
there is a button right here that says,
Set up in Desktop.

33
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.592
So we are gonna click
that button right here.

34
00:02:21.617 --> 00:02:24.775
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
we're gonna open it up in Github Desktop.

35
00:02:24.775 --> 00:02:27.624
And it should do these things for you.

36
00:02:30.247 --> 00:02:32.596
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So it's going to say,
this is the repo name.

37
00:02:32.596 --> 00:02:34.546
This is what's on GitHub itself.

38
00:02:34.546 --> 00:02:37.018
That's the thing we just created.

39
00:02:37.018 --> 00:02:39.752
And then it's gonna ask,
where does this live on your computer.

40
00:02:39.752 --> 00:02:43.470
And so this is on my desktop that
there should be a folder called

41
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.339
gen4weblive.github.io.

42
00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:50.529
Great, we're gonna say clone.

43
00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.869
And this is what it's gonna
look like here, okay?

44
00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:57.884
And I will point out that on your desktop.

45
00:03:00.525 --> 00:03:02.912
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You now have
a folder here called jen4web.

46
00:03:02.912 --> 00:03:07.312
In my case, jen4web-live.github.io,
it's right here, and

47
00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:09.405
there's nothing in it, okay?

48
00:03:09.405 --> 00:03:12.034
And if you've never used
this product before,

49
00:03:12.034 --> 00:03:15.980
there may be some of these additional
configuration steps that you're

50
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.019
gonna have to go through to
do the thing that I just did.

51
00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.640
This is the screenshot of
the thing that I just did, okay.

52
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.089
So then you wanna make sure
that your GitHub folder has all

53
00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:30.802
of the things in it that
you want to post online.

54
00:03:30.802 --> 00:03:35.703
So what we're going to do is
we're going to look at jen4web,

55
00:03:35.703 --> 00:03:39.757
dash, live.github.io,
has nothing in it, and

56
00:03:39.757 --> 00:03:45.534
I have a folder here called website
that has all this stuff in it, right?

57
00:03:45.534 --> 00:03:47.776
This is the stuff I wanna post online.

58
00:03:47.776 --> 00:03:51.930
So I'm just gonna put it into that folder,
okay?

59
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.480
So that's the stuff that
I wanna post online,

60
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.040
and we can get rid of the website folder,
bye.

61
00:04:05.738 --> 00:04:08.642
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and as it says here,
make sure that one file,

62
00:04:08.642 --> 00:04:11.365
probably your home page
is called index.HTML.

63
00:04:11.365 --> 00:04:16.014
I really emphasize that your HTML
files should be called index.HTML.

64
00:04:16.014 --> 00:04:17.545
I emphasize it again here.

65
00:04:17.545 --> 00:04:21.595
All right, and
then if we look at our GitHub Desktop,

66
00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:24.753
you'll notice that something changed.

67
00:04:24.753 --> 00:04:29.657
Here's all of the things, so here's our
styles and our images and our index.

68
00:04:29.657 --> 00:04:32.154
All of that is all listed here.

69
00:04:34.868 --> 00:04:36.937
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Which is
exactly what we wanna see.

70
00:04:36.937 --> 00:04:41.515
As it says, you can make a commit note for
each file in the lower left hand corner.

71
00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:45.567
A commit note is very useful thing.

72
00:04:45.567 --> 00:04:48.177
As you are sending your
changes up to GitHub,

73
00:04:48.177 --> 00:04:52.644
you can make notes about what exactly
changed between this file and the ones,

74
00:04:52.644 --> 00:04:55.825
perhaps things that you've
sent up to GitHub before.

75
00:04:55.825 --> 00:04:57.836
That's what a commit note is.

76
00:04:57.836 --> 00:05:01.322
In this case, this is the first
time I'm setting anything up.

77
00:05:01.322 --> 00:05:08.753
So I'm just gonna call this initial
commit, because it's pretty, pretty basic.

78
00:05:08.753 --> 00:05:11.022
But we could say more about it.

79
00:05:11.022 --> 00:05:14.910
Perhaps you've been committing
through each chapter of this course,

80
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.248
you could say just the about part, just
the projects part after I assembled it,

81
00:05:19.248 --> 00:05:21.535
after I installed the light dark switch.

82
00:05:21.535 --> 00:05:25.111
And then we're gonna click
on commit six files to me.

83
00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:29.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: As a side note, if anybody
is new to Git or wants to learn more about

84
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.784
Git, Zachary Renko has a Git
in-depth course on our platform.

85
00:05:33.784 --> 00:05:34.892
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Amazing.

86
00:05:34.892 --> 00:05:37.747
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We also have a course from
the Primogen that goes a little deeper.

87
00:05:37.747 --> 00:05:40.771
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, because there's
like so much to know about this and

88
00:05:40.771 --> 00:05:43.990
we're doing the simplest version
that I know how right now.

89
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.772
But if you really wanna dig into this and

90
00:05:45.772 --> 00:05:49.608
how it works, there are other courses on
the front end master's platform for this.

91
00:05:49.608 --> 00:05:53.013
All right, so once we've committed it,

92
00:05:53.013 --> 00:05:58.090
then we are going to publish and
the publish button is up here.

93
00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.623
You can either click up here
in the upper right corner, or

94
00:06:01.623 --> 00:06:05.757
you can click right here where it
says Publish Branch, bye, bye.

95
00:06:05.757 --> 00:06:07.221
And off it goes.

96
00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:14.084
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so we did that.

97
00:06:14.084 --> 00:06:17.380
We clicked commit to master, and
we click the Publish branch button.

98
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.576
Then we should be able to
go into our browser window.

99
00:06:21.576 --> 00:06:23.554
And I think we're missing a step here.

100
00:06:23.554 --> 00:06:28.881
But let us take a look here at
the window that I have at GitHub,

101
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:32.446
it's Jeni4web-live.github.io.

102
00:06:32.446 --> 00:06:37.126
If I refresh this page, so
you should have files here, and if you do,

103
00:06:37.126 --> 00:06:38.758
then you are good to go.

104
00:06:38.758 --> 00:06:42.605
Now, if you called your
repository jen4web,

105
00:06:42.605 --> 00:06:47.513
that's my username.github.io,
what will happen is this

106
00:06:47.513 --> 00:06:52.627
will automatically turn into a place for
GitHub Pages to work.

107
00:06:52.627 --> 00:06:57.081
And all I need to do now
is enter a new tab and

108
00:06:57.081 --> 00:07:01.283
I can type in jen4web.github.io and

109
00:07:01.283 --> 00:07:06.264
my default index web
page should pull up here.

110
00:07:06.264 --> 00:07:09.617
This one says still working because
I used this for another project.

111
00:07:09.617 --> 00:07:13.038
[LAUGH] it actually isn't
showing right here.

112
00:07:13.038 --> 00:07:15.803
And I didn't use this for
the steps that I just showed you anyway.

113
00:07:15.803 --> 00:07:22.205
So that is how that would work if
you've used your username.github.io.

114
00:07:22.205 --> 00:07:27.862
And if you did not use username.github.io,
here are the extra steps you're going

115
00:07:27.862 --> 00:07:33.054
to need to take right now in order to get
this to work and get up to Github pages.

116
00:07:33.054 --> 00:07:36.210
So we are going to go to Settings.

117
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:43.046
And we are going to change the name of
this repository to just jen4web-live.

118
00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:48.832
So just make that edit and
then say rename,

119
00:07:48.832 --> 00:07:52.538
and then it should rename.

120
00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:56.182
So there we go, there's my repo,
it's called jen4web-live.

121
00:07:56.182 --> 00:07:59.473
And that is the first
thing that we need to do.

122
00:07:59.473 --> 00:08:02.001
The other thing we need
to do also in settings.

123
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:06.771
If we go to pages, we are going to need to

124
00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:10.827
now deploy this to GitHub Pages.

125
00:08:10.827 --> 00:08:16.396
And here under Branch,
we're going to change this to main and

126
00:08:16.396 --> 00:08:19.192
then we're going to say Save.

127
00:08:21.023 --> 00:08:25.121
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so
that sets it up as GitHub pages.

128
00:08:25.121 --> 00:08:28.971
So after you give us a few minutes,
now, as I said,

129
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:33.179
up to fifteen minutes,
looking at your repo page here,

130
00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:38.034
I'm in settings, and
we're just hitting the refresh button.

131
00:08:38.034 --> 00:08:43.625
You will see at the top of the page that
it'll come up and say your site is live,

132
00:08:43.625 --> 00:08:48.555
and it will give you the website
address for where your site is live.

133
00:08:48.555 --> 00:08:52.427
All you have to do now is
click on visit the site, and

134
00:08:52.427 --> 00:08:58.390
you should see the amazing, fabulous
website that you just built right here.

135
00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.108
And of course, it should be responsive.

136
00:09:01.108 --> 00:09:02.567
You should be able to make it small.

137
00:09:02.567 --> 00:09:05.248
Look at that, so cool.

138
00:09:05.248 --> 00:09:09.043
And your light and
dark switch should still work.

139
00:09:09.043 --> 00:09:13.811
And everything else you've all now
copied it all over from CodePen.

140
00:09:13.811 --> 00:09:18.529
You put it into VSCode and
you have deployed all of your work

141
00:09:18.529 --> 00:09:22.680
now into GitHub and
made a display on GitHub pages.

142
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.689
And that's pretty much it.

143
00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:26.048
That's how it's all done.

144
00:09:26.048 --> 00:09:31.297
Congratulations, yayy.

145
00:09:31.297 --> 00:09:32.025
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
