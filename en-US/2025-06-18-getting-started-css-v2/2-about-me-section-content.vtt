1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.807
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so

2
00:00:00.807 --> 00:00:05.250
now that you have done all of this work
pulling together all of your information

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.683
that you're going to want to
put on this portfolio website,

4
00:00:08.683 --> 00:00:12.483
we are going to start by coding
the about me section on the website.

5
00:00:12.483 --> 00:00:17.891
And I typically use a program
called CodePen while I'm teaching.

6
00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:20.466
I really love CodePen for
a couple of reasons.

7
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:23.932
It allows us to write our HTML and CSS and

8
00:00:23.932 --> 00:00:28.354
see it applied to the page
immediately in action.

9
00:00:28.354 --> 00:00:32.632
The other piece of it is that I don't
have to worry about files, folders,

10
00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:36.855
dependencies, or any of the other
things that go into web development.

11
00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:39.129
We can just get in and start coding.

12
00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.722
So I'm not suggesting that this is
a fantastic development workflow for

13
00:00:43.722 --> 00:00:48.477
a professional developer, far from it,
but this is great for education.

14
00:00:48.477 --> 00:00:51.690
So we are going to start
with this about me section.

15
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.283
So I'm here in chapter 3 on the website,
and

16
00:00:55.283 --> 00:00:59.361
we are starting with part 1,
marking up the HTML.

17
00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:05.630
And I as I say here, I've given you some
starter text, the SVG images and a photo.

18
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.658
We're gonna talk about how to mark it up.

19
00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:09.964
Your social media icons may vary,

20
00:01:09.964 --> 00:01:14.107
you can get social media icons
a lot of places on the internet.

21
00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:16.526
I actually went to Font Awesome.

22
00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:19.241
Let me just show you this real quick.

23
00:01:19.241 --> 00:01:24.617
If you go to Font Font Awesome,
let's say that you're looking for

24
00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:28.464
the GitHub,
we can just do a search for GitHub.

25
00:01:28.464 --> 00:01:33.927
And it will give you, here's a few
choices here for a GitHub icon.

26
00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:40.838
And if, say you like this one,
you can click on it and then scroll down.

27
00:01:40.838 --> 00:01:44.270
It will give you the option of including
this in a bunch of different ways.

28
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.103
The HTML version is if you've actually
linked to the font Awesome Font.

29
00:01:49.103 --> 00:01:53.769
The thing that I'm suggesting
here is you actually go to SVG.

30
00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:58.001
And if you just click on the code, that
will actually copy it to your clipboard,

31
00:01:58.001 --> 00:01:59.844
and you can drop it into your HTML.

32
00:01:59.844 --> 00:02:05.534
So Finalism has got tons of SVGs,
it was like 50,000 odd.

33
00:02:05.534 --> 00:02:08.264
And so your social media icons
are probably in here and

34
00:02:08.264 --> 00:02:10.215
they're probably free to download.

35
00:02:10.215 --> 00:02:14.262
But again, there's a lot of places
you can get SVG on the web.

36
00:02:14.262 --> 00:02:19.179
All right, so we're going to start
with the beginning CodePen here.

37
00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:22.286
And your screen probably looks like this,

38
00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:26.439
if this is the first time that
you've ever used CodePen.

39
00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.715
Make sure that you sign in.

40
00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:32.321
And the way I usually like
to work in CodePen is,

41
00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:37.029
up here in the upper right corner, there's
a button that kinda looks like a cupcake.

42
00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:41.372
Looks like three different boxes on
the top and a bigger one on the bottom.

43
00:02:41.372 --> 00:02:45.842
If you click that, it will give you the
option of putting your code on the side.

44
00:02:45.842 --> 00:02:50.299
I usually find this better for working
in HTML and CSS, because, of course,

45
00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.317
we like to change the size
of our display screen to see

46
00:02:53.317 --> 00:02:55.735
how things are doing in responsive view.

47
00:02:55.735 --> 00:02:59.733
So that's what I've done to set
up my coding environment here.

48
00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:03.035
And we are going to start with our HTML,

49
00:03:03.035 --> 00:03:07.048
because great code in
the web starts with HTML.

50
00:03:07.048 --> 00:03:11.237
And we don't care what it looks
like because this is HTML,

51
00:03:11.237 --> 00:03:13.552
CSS is what makes it beautiful.

52
00:03:13.552 --> 00:03:17.244
So let's just focus on it going from here.

53
00:03:17.244 --> 00:03:21.608
All right, so starting with this
particular text that you see up here on

54
00:03:21.608 --> 00:03:26.719
the page, what would be the most important
thing that you see here on this webpage?

55
00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:28.750
Anyone wanna take a guess?

56
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.465
Most important thing that you would see
here on this part of the web page, yeah.

57
00:03:34.465 --> 00:03:35.687
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The photo?

58
00:03:35.687 --> 00:03:38.174
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The photo is
definitely really important, but

59
00:03:38.174 --> 00:03:40.237
it may not be the most important thing.

60
00:03:40.237 --> 00:03:43.184
What would be the most
important piece of information?

61
00:03:43.184 --> 00:03:46.274
It's a portfolio website, yes.

62
00:03:46.274 --> 00:03:46.849
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Your name?

63
00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.826
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The name of the person
is the most important thing.

64
00:03:49.826 --> 00:03:53.919
So in this case, this is Brissa.

65
00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:58.811
And so therefore this gets our h11.

66
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:02.070
My goodness, yes,
that is the second line of text here.

67
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.424
And it is possible that this may,
in fact, happen,

68
00:04:05.424 --> 00:04:09.027
your h1 is not the very first
thing on the page, right?

69
00:04:09.027 --> 00:04:14.095
What is the second most important thing
here on this page that describes Brissa?

70
00:04:14.095 --> 00:04:14.649
Yeah.

71
00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:15.367
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Her title.

72
00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:17.453
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Her title,
front end developer.

73
00:04:17.453 --> 00:04:19.986
So we're going to give that an h2.

74
00:04:23.671 --> 00:04:26.835
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Perfect, okay?

75
00:04:26.835 --> 00:04:29.487
Once again,
we're not worried about how this looks,

76
00:04:29.487 --> 00:04:31.690
we just want to get
the right markup in place.

77
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.642
Then we're going to have some blah,
blah here, right?

78
00:04:34.642 --> 00:04:38.806
It's gonna talk all about this person,
that would be a paragraph of information.

79
00:04:38.806 --> 00:04:45.203
So shockingly, we'll mark that
up with a paragraph element.

80
00:04:45.203 --> 00:04:47.650
Okay, then we're gonna get to our SVG.

81
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.043
So this is basically how you copy
the SVG right from Font Awesome.

82
00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:55.545
And the one that I have here,

83
00:04:55.545 --> 00:05:01.495
it looks like I just put in a bunch
of SVGs without links around them.

84
00:05:01.495 --> 00:05:05.796
So we'll want to put in some
links around these SVGs and

85
00:05:05.796 --> 00:05:10.389
we'll also want to think about
the right markup for this.

86
00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:16.233
So in this particular case I've got,
I think this is blue sky,

87
00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:22.865
LinkedIn, GitHub and I think email,
was the order that I had these in.

88
00:05:22.865 --> 00:05:27.654
Yeah, the GitHub, LinkedIn, and
email, they're all outrageously large

89
00:05:27.654 --> 00:05:32.454
because we haven't styled them yet,
so nobody panic, it's totally fine.

90
00:05:32.454 --> 00:05:35.150
This is a list, right?

91
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.300
An unordered list of SPGs.

92
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.543
So we're going to mark
that up accordingly.

93
00:05:41.543 --> 00:05:48.810
And I will start with,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Our unordered list, right?

94
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.327
So we start with an unordered list.

95
00:05:53.327 --> 00:05:58.441
And because there's likely that we'll have
other unordered lists on this website,

96
00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:02.077
I'm going to give this a class,
just to keep things simple.

97
00:06:02.077 --> 00:06:08.484
I'm calling this icons because
I'm creative that way.

98
00:06:08.484 --> 00:06:14.111
Then I'm going to give this a list item,
which is our li,

99
00:06:14.111 --> 00:06:20.697
and I'll give it a link, a href =,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

100
00:06:20.697 --> 00:06:26.402
then maybe you have a blue sky link.

101
00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:32.257
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This happens to be mine.

102
00:06:32.257 --> 00:06:34.253
I'll have it open in a new window.

103
00:06:42.273 --> 00:06:45.668
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
then that link is gonna end after the SVG.

104
00:06:50.864 --> 00:06:56.135
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, all right, so
what we have here is an SVG, the picture.

105
00:06:56.135 --> 00:06:59.105
But we do not have any kind
of text explanation for

106
00:06:59.105 --> 00:07:01.793
someone who might be
using a screen reader.

107
00:07:01.793 --> 00:07:03.963
And that is very important to add.

108
00:07:03.963 --> 00:07:07.492
So there's a couple ways that
you could handle this with SVGs.

109
00:07:07.492 --> 00:07:11.082
You could use various
ARIA types of attributes.

110
00:07:11.082 --> 00:07:16.254
But one of the simple ways of doing this
is, believe it or not, with the title tag.

111
00:07:16.254 --> 00:07:23.083
And you can just use the title tag,
give it the name blue sky.

112
00:07:23.083 --> 00:07:28.415
Generally speaking, you're gonna want that
right after the SVG element name itself.

113
00:07:28.415 --> 00:07:33.249
You give it the title tag here,
and you'll see that the word

114
00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:37.417
blue sky does not display
over here on the web page.

115
00:07:37.417 --> 00:07:41.490
So title, then, is a word that will
be read by the screen reader, but

116
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:46.084
it doesn't actually display on the web
page, which is exactly what we want.

117
00:07:46.084 --> 00:07:49.967
There's all kinds of other ways, like I
said, you could use various ARIA elements.

118
00:07:49.967 --> 00:07:53.779
You could put in spans and
then visually hide them with CSS.

119
00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:55.656
There's all kinds of other
things that you can do.

120
00:07:55.656 --> 00:07:58.059
But honestly, this is very simple.

121
00:07:58.059 --> 00:08:00.752
So that is what I'm going to recommend.

122
00:08:00.752 --> 00:08:07.503
And the other thing that I'm going
to do while I'm here is to my SVG,

123
00:08:07.503 --> 00:08:11.779
I'm going to add a class of social, okay.

124
00:08:11.779 --> 00:08:16.275
And the goal of that will
be eventually we will wind

125
00:08:16.275 --> 00:08:19.929
up styling these as social media icons.

126
00:08:19.929 --> 00:08:21.177
All right, so,

127
00:08:21.177 --> 00:08:27.166
does anybody have any questions at this
point as to what I've done here and why?

128
00:08:27.166 --> 00:08:30.574
Started it as an unordered list,
we have individual list items.

129
00:08:30.574 --> 00:08:34.944
We have our SVG, we made it accessible,
and we assigned a class.

130
00:08:34.944 --> 00:08:36.129
Any questions?

131
00:08:36.129 --> 00:08:37.827
Yes.

132
00:08:37.827 --> 00:08:43.545
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Can we also use an alt
attribute in this context for SVG?

133
00:08:43.545 --> 00:08:47.060
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So an alt attribute in
an SVG, which is a great question.

134
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.961
If you are including your SVG
in the image element itself, so

135
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:55.952
you're pointing to a file that may have
the SVG in it, that certainly works.

136
00:08:55.952 --> 00:09:00.870
The problem with using the image
element that contains your

137
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.237
SVG is we cannot restyle it.

138
00:09:03.237 --> 00:09:04.873
Here, I can now give this a color,

139
00:09:04.873 --> 00:09:07.079
as you'll see when we get
to the CSS part of it.

140
00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:10.088
I can give my SVG a color,
I can give it a hover state,

141
00:09:10.088 --> 00:09:13.522
I can do all kinds of different
manipulations with it here.

142
00:09:13.522 --> 00:09:18.774
If I have my SVG coming into
an img element with the alt text,

143
00:09:18.774 --> 00:09:21.836
I can't manipulate it in any way.

144
00:09:21.836 --> 00:09:24.200
Great quesion, yes.

145
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.058
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: That social class,
is that your CSS class that you wrote, or

146
00:09:28.058 --> 00:09:29.581
is it some other class?

147
00:09:29.581 --> 00:09:33.772
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It is a CSS class that will
write, I haven't written it yet, but yes.

148
00:09:33.772 --> 00:09:36.841
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Cuz it looked like
the image shrunk a little, I'm not sure.

149
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:40.649
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Well,
it probably did shrink a little bit.

150
00:09:40.649 --> 00:09:44.363
You"ll notice right here, there's one
tiny dot, that is from my list item.

151
00:09:44.363 --> 00:09:49.322
[LAUGH] I haven't marked these other
ones yet to include my list items,

152
00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:54.465
and so it probably bumped over a little
bit from the side because of that.

153
00:09:54.465 --> 00:09:56.093
What I would do at this point now,

154
00:09:56.093 --> 00:09:58.836
rather than sitting here
watching me continue to type?

155
00:09:58.836 --> 00:10:02.153
I would continue to mark
up all of my links,

156
00:10:02.153 --> 00:10:07.498
I'm going to continue to add titles
to all of these differents SVGs,

157
00:10:07.498 --> 00:10:11.940
and I will continue to mark
these individual list items.

158
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.955
My list will end right down here.

159
00:10:15.955 --> 00:10:22.680
I will end by li and
I will end my ul down here at the bottom.

160
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.716
