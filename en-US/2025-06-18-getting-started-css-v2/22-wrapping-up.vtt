&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
congratulations everyone,

2
00:00:02.116 --> 00:00:04.993
you have created your
first portfolio website.

3
00:00:04.993 --> 00:00:06.728
Today has been a very busy day.

4
00:00:06.728 --> 00:00:11.226
We started with talking about all of the
information that you might wanna include

5
00:00:11.226 --> 00:00:12.681
on a portfolio website and

6
00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:16.535
things you might wanna think about
as you include that information.

7
00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:19.728
We then started to mark up
that information and style it.

8
00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:22.571
For the about me section,
the project section and

9
00:00:22.571 --> 00:00:25.631
the footer section individually
inside of CodePen.

10
00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:28.575
We then assembled those all into one page.

11
00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:29.250
We added a light,

12
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.690
dark color theme switcher that's
all completely CSS powered.

13
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.015
And then we took all of that information,

14
00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:39.670
dumped it over to VS code and
set it up online to GitHub, and

15
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.756
now you have a page that you can see
online and share with all of your friends.

16
00:00:45.756 --> 00:00:48.490
So congratulations on
getting all that done.

17
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.309
If you like me here,
you may like me elsewhere too.

18
00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.215
You might wanna check out some of my
other courses including the ultimate

19
00:00:56.215 --> 00:00:59.996
grid course, practical CSS layouts and
CSS projects,

20
00:00:59.996 --> 00:01:02.586
are three of my most popular courses.

21
00:01:02.586 --> 00:01:06.089
All of them will teach
you more about CSS and

22
00:01:06.089 --> 00:01:12.036
how to think about CSS layouts and
how to think about styling in general.

23
00:01:12.036 --> 00:01:14.651
So once again, congratulations.

24
00:01:14.651 --> 00:01:18.112
Hope to see you in another course,
real soon.

25
00:01:18.112 --> 00:01:18.612
