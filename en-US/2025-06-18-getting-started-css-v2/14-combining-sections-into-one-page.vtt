1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.993
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now that we have,
we have the about section written,

2
00:00:02.993 --> 00:00:07.462
we have our footer section written, and
we have our project section written, and

3
00:00:07.462 --> 00:00:09.499
they're all in separate CodePens.

4
00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:14.525
The next thing I wanna do is combine
all of those into a single page.

5
00:00:14.525 --> 00:00:16.707
So that is the next
thing what we wanna do.

6
00:00:16.707 --> 00:00:20.038
Here inside of your website, in chapter 6,

7
00:00:20.038 --> 00:00:24.946
we are getting ready to start on
our light dark theme switcher, and

8
00:00:24.946 --> 00:00:30.052
we're gonna start that by combining
everything into a single page.

9
00:00:30.052 --> 00:00:34.940
So what we're gonna need in order to
get this done is the project's pen that

10
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.191
we just finished.

11
00:00:36.191 --> 00:00:40.255
So the layout we just finished
in terms of our projects, and

12
00:00:40.255 --> 00:00:42.790
the mobile and the desktop version.

13
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.849
We're going to need to
open up the about page.

14
00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:51.676
So we wanna go back to this CodePen here,

15
00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:54.762
with the section that
we wrote on the about.

16
00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:57.519
And we wanna go back to our footer.

17
00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:03.937
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
all of that information here.

18
00:01:03.937 --> 00:01:07.543
And now we're going to combine
these all into one CodePen.

19
00:01:07.543 --> 00:01:10.537
So with the exception of that
switch up there on the top,

20
00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.906
this is the way the page
is supposed to look.

21
00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:17.081
We should have an about section,
on top of a project section,

22
00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:18.940
on top of a footer section.

23
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.606
So, does anyone have any
suggestions of how we should start?

24
00:01:24.606 --> 00:01:27.726
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Probably we can
create a single HTML page,

25
00:01:27.726 --> 00:01:32.418
and then copy each of those tags and
put them there accordingly.

26
00:01:32.418 --> 00:01:33.007
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Student 1: And

27
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:35.611
then the CSS consolidate
that together as well.

28
00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:38.883
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There we go, we should
just copy over each of our sections.

29
00:01:38.883 --> 00:01:41.952
So, the good news is,
with our projects markup here,

30
00:01:41.952 --> 00:01:45.910
all of the markup that we've written so
far is here inside of this pen.

31
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.617
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to start
with my about page here, and what I'm

32
00:01:51.617 --> 00:01:57.344
going to copy over is not the wrapper,
but just the article part of this, okay?

33
00:01:57.344 --> 00:02:01.816
And you can do that really easily
by working with your arrows here.

34
00:02:01.816 --> 00:02:04.005
So I've just flattened that up.

35
00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:09.139
This is lines 2 to 30, all in that
[LAUGH], and I can just copy that

36
00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:14.199
little bit of code and then come
back over to my Projects pen here.

37
00:02:17.527 --> 00:02:19.465
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
there's the main, right?

38
00:02:19.465 --> 00:02:21.305
So the article comes before the main.

39
00:02:21.305 --> 00:02:23.797
So I'll just hit return, and paste.

40
00:02:26.652 --> 00:02:30.903
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So there's my about
section, followed by my projects.

41
00:02:30.903 --> 00:02:33.202
Wait a minute,
why does this look different?

42
00:02:33.202 --> 00:02:35.325
This looks like the desktop version of it,
and

43
00:02:35.325 --> 00:02:37.235
this looks like the mobile version of it.

44
00:02:37.235 --> 00:02:38.303
What's going on here?

45
00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:43.052
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Media query
has not been copied.

46
00:02:43.052 --> 00:02:46.341
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's right,
we wrote a small media query,

47
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:52.172
a 750 pixel media query here for
the about page, but it's 850 pixels here.

48
00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:57.083
So we're somewhere between 750 and
800 pixels right now, okay?

49
00:02:57.083 --> 00:03:01.205
If I go back to smaller than 750 pixels,

50
00:03:01.205 --> 00:03:05.562
we have the mobile version for
both of these.

51
00:03:05.562 --> 00:03:11.921
And if I make it bigger, now I have
the desktop version for both of these.

52
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:14.180
Nice, okay?

53
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.552
So we have this interesting
little in-between layout, right?

54
00:03:19.552 --> 00:03:24.303
It's desktop there, but mobile here.

55
00:03:24.303 --> 00:03:25.968
Looks good, okay?

56
00:03:25.968 --> 00:03:28.918
And then, so that took care of that.

57
00:03:28.918 --> 00:03:32.072
Now we're gonna go to the footer,
we're gonna do the same thing.

58
00:03:32.072 --> 00:03:35.063
We'll just use our arrows.

59
00:03:35.063 --> 00:03:39.664
We're gonna go basically line 2 to 53 for
our footer.

60
00:03:39.664 --> 00:03:42.107
Copy that.

61
00:03:42.107 --> 00:03:44.383
And then here in our CodePen,

62
00:03:44.383 --> 00:03:50.037
once we get past our main portion of
the page, we'll paste in our footer.

63
00:03:53.622 --> 00:03:54.731
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And, sure enough,

64
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:58.140
down there at the bottom is
the footer portion of our webpage.

65
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.362
Look at that.
You've coded the whole thing.

66
00:04:01.362 --> 00:04:02.638
You're amazing.

67
00:04:02.638 --> 00:04:04.263
You're so good at this.

68
00:04:04.263 --> 00:04:05.608
Yay, all right.

69
00:04:05.608 --> 00:04:10.207
So, let me let me just point out to those
of you who are watching who may be feeling

70
00:04:10.207 --> 00:04:12.966
a little bit overwhelmed
at this point in time.

71
00:04:12.966 --> 00:04:16.003
You have a perfectly good
webpage just like this.

72
00:04:16.003 --> 00:04:19.935
You could launch this and
be very proud of this webpage.

73
00:04:19.935 --> 00:04:24.416
And if you're feeling like,
I've had enough in terms of code, and

74
00:04:24.416 --> 00:04:28.911
I'm ready to just get this up online and
not think about it anymore.

75
00:04:28.911 --> 00:04:31.710
I would encourage you to
skip forward to chapter 7,

76
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.272
where I'm gonna walk you through
how we take this out of CodePen and

77
00:04:35.272 --> 00:04:38.215
then get this up on the web so
that everybody can see it.

78
00:04:38.215 --> 00:04:40.644
And that's what we'll
be doing in chapter 7.

79
00:04:40.644 --> 00:04:44.762
However, if you're one of those people
who are like, yeah, that was really good.

80
00:04:44.762 --> 00:04:48.598
And now I want a little bit more,
I wanna have this light, dark color theme.

81
00:04:48.598 --> 00:04:51.900
Then we're gonna continue on with
here with that in chapter 6.

82
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.115
So, that is the next thing
we're gonna work on.
