>> Jen Kramer: So congratulations everyone, you have created your first portfolio website. Today has been a very busy day. We started with talking about all of the information that you might wanna include on a portfolio website and things you might wanna think about as you include that information. We then started to mark up that information and style it.

[00:00:19]
For the about me section, the project section and the footer section individually inside of CodePen. We then assembled those all into one page. We added a light, dark color theme switcher that's all completely CSS powered. And then we took all of that information, dumped it over to VS code and set it up online to GitHub, and now you have a page that you can see online and share with all of your friends.

[00:00:45]
So congratulations on getting all that done. If you like me here, you may like me elsewhere too. You might wanna check out some of my other courses including the ultimate grid course, practical CSS layouts and CSS projects, are three of my most popular courses. All of them will teach you more about CSS and how to think about CSS layouts and how to think about styling in general.

[00:01:12]
So once again, congratulations. Hope to see you in another course, real soon.
