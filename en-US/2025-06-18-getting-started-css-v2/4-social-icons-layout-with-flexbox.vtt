00:00:00.277 --> 00:00:04.662
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So now that we've got the
basic styling done here on this page so

2
00:00:04.662 --> 00:00:10.650
far, let's turn to these overwhelming SVGs
because, whoo, they are big and ugly.

3
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.516
So the first thing that we wanna do is
we wanna get these out of the list,

4
00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:23.784
1 and 2, or at least the list styling, and
2, we wanna make them a reasonable size.

5
00:00:23.784 --> 00:00:27.184
So remember that in our HTML,

6
00:00:27.184 --> 00:00:31.543
we have a UL with a class called icons.

7
00:00:31.543 --> 00:00:35.577
Then each of these items
is an individual list item.

8
00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:40.857
They have a link and then we have our
title and our path properties here,

9
00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:45.171
and the path property has a class
of social assigned to it.

10
00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:48.867
So it's always good to review your HTML,
remember what you wrote.

11
00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:56.066
So now let us write some code here,
I'm giving myself a comment.

12
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:59.718
I'm gonna call this
the SVG social icon bar.

13
00:00:59.718 --> 00:01:03.322
Refer there to our icons class, and

14
00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:07.772
I'm going to say my list
style type is none.

15
00:01:07.772 --> 00:01:11.566
That will get rid of the little
dots here next to these.

16
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:15.872
So our list item bullet icon goes away.

17
00:01:15.872 --> 00:01:18.402
We also set our margin to zero, and

18
00:01:18.402 --> 00:01:23.129
that will get rid of the little bit
of space by each of these SVGs.

19
00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:28.050
Sometimes some borders use padding,
so I usually do both margin and

20
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.998
padding here for this, zero those out.

21
00:01:33.745 --> 00:01:40.074
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now for
the svgs inside of our unordered list,

22
00:01:40.074 --> 00:01:45.592
I'm gonna set my width to 36 pixels and

23
00:01:45.592 --> 00:01:49.176
my height to 36 pixels.

24
00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:55.092
Phew, and
now they are no longer overwhelming,

25
00:01:55.092 --> 00:01:58.132
okay, [LAUGH] here we go.

26
00:01:58.132 --> 00:02:03.320
All right, now, I said earlier,
we didn't put these svgs inside

27
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.601
of an image element, because when
you put them in an image element,

28
00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:11.675
you cannot manipulate the svg itself.

29
00:02:11.675 --> 00:02:16.422
But here, since I've put
the actual svgs into my HTML,

30
00:02:16.422 --> 00:02:21.270
I can change their color, and
the way that I do that is with

31
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.512
the social CSS class,
and I'm gonna say, fill.

32
00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:29.530
So this is not background color, which
is what we use everywhere else in CSS.

33
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.245
This is a svg property
specifically called fill, and

34
00:02:34.245 --> 00:02:38.559
we can refer to our usual
CSS variables for this.

35
00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:39.837
So this is windsurfing.

36
00:02:39.837 --> 00:02:46.801
Once again, our blue, and
that will turn all of our SVGs blue.

37
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:50.375
We don't have to pre-color
them going into this.

38
00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:55.167
And what makes this wonderful
is that now we can also

39
00:02:55.167 --> 00:02:59.743
have a hover state, yay, so .social:hover.

40
00:02:59.743 --> 00:03:07.703
And we can have a fill
state of var('''marina).

41
00:03:07.703 --> 00:03:09.425
So now, as I roll my mouse over these,
now they change color on hover.

42
00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:10.970
How cool is that?

43
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.998
Great, we have a vertical
list of all of our links.

44
00:03:16.998 --> 00:03:19.733
The next thing we wanna do
is get them all in a row.

45
00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:22.815
How are we going to do that?

46
00:03:22.815 --> 00:03:24.406
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: On the other list.

47
00:03:24.406 --> 00:03:26.076
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We have an unordered list,
correct.

48
00:03:26.076 --> 00:03:28.573
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We can start
that class that we created.

49
00:03:28.573 --> 00:03:31.038
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We can use our
unordered list to style this.

50
00:03:31.038 --> 00:03:34.183
In order to set these up
to whatever layout we want,

51
00:03:34.183 --> 00:03:38.663
what would be a methodology that we
use in order to make it go horizontal?

52
00:03:38.663 --> 00:03:40.444
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Alice online says, Flexbox.

53
00:03:40.444 --> 00:03:41.513
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Flexbox.

54
00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:46.413
Flexbox is what we wanna use in order to
make this go horizontally across the page,

55
00:03:46.413 --> 00:03:47.627
you could use grid.

56
00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:50.048
The difference with grid is that,

57
00:03:50.048 --> 00:03:55.226
grid is probably gonna stretch the divide
this into four equal segments.

58
00:03:55.226 --> 00:03:59.780
The nice thing with Flexbox is that,
each of our boxes are flexible in size,

59
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.976
and so, they will be as big as the icon
itself going across the screen,

60
00:04:03.976 --> 00:04:05.846
which is exactly what we need.

61
00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:09.996
So back on our icons class here,

62
00:04:09.996 --> 00:04:14.914
we can add to this display: flex, and

63
00:04:14.914 --> 00:04:19.227
then say flex flow, row, wrap.

64
00:04:19.227 --> 00:04:23.858
Okay, so that puts it, boom,
two style or two properties there,

65
00:04:23.858 --> 00:04:27.509
it already goes horizontal
exactly the way we want.

66
00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:35.671
And then we could say something
like align items: flex end.

67
00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:41.775
All right, I am doing this to get
them all aligned on the bottoms.

68
00:04:41.775 --> 00:04:45.395
Yeah, and
then let's give them a gap of 2'rem.

69
00:04:49.403 --> 00:04:52.843
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Which looks nice,
that much gap is good, because, remember,

70
00:04:52.843 --> 00:04:55.785
somebody on a mobile phone
will be using their finger.

71
00:04:55.785 --> 00:04:59.307
We wanna make sure we have enough room
between each of those items in order for

72
00:04:59.307 --> 00:05:02.297
people to click without clicking
on its neighbors and so forth.

73
00:05:02.297 --> 00:05:04.524
So here we go.

74
00:05:04.524 --> 00:05:10.351
All right, all that code should be
pretty close to the screenshot that

75
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:15.898
I gave you for how we make this look,
and you are all done with that.

76
00:05:15.898 --> 00:05:16.925
How are people feeling?

77
00:05:19.758 --> 00:05:24.791
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yay [APPLAUSE] not as hard
and impossible as you thought, right?

78
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:27.807
Break it down into just
a piece of our design, and

79
00:05:27.807 --> 00:05:30.248
we just apply some basic styling to it.
