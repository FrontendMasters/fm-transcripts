00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.754
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So I know you're super
impressed by those radio buttons, but

2
00:00:02.754 --> 00:00:04.880
let's face it,
radio buttons are kinda ugly.

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.860
And what you really want is one of those
cool little switches that go back and

4
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.423
forth.

5
00:00:10.423 --> 00:00:12.494
Except those little
switches that go back and

6
00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:14.355
forth are usually done with a checkbox.

7
00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:17.205
So you take a checkbox,
you apply all the styling to it, and

8
00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:20.228
you're basically checking or
unchecking a single checkbox.

9
00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:23.274
Remember, we don't have
an unchecked state, so

10
00:00:23.274 --> 00:00:27.706
we have to still have two radio buttons
if we want it to look like a switch.

11
00:00:27.706 --> 00:00:29.182
How do we make that magic happen?

12
00:00:29.182 --> 00:00:32.665
So, enormous shout out to Scott O'Hara,

13
00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:37.910
who came up with a way of styling
two radio buttons into a switch.

14
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.933
And I'm going to show you that
code pen here really quickly,

15
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:48.663
because he figured this out,
not me so, and it's really well done.

16
00:00:48.663 --> 00:00:54.237
So here is the HTML, okay,
and he's got this set up.

17
00:00:54.237 --> 00:00:58.340
You can see that the switch isn't
really doing anything here.

18
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.031
The whole point is just to
show you this is on and off.

19
00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:07.747
And Scott O'Hara works for, I think it's
microsoft, and he's an accessibility

20
00:01:07.747 --> 00:01:12.826
specialist, so inherently,
these things are also accessible as well.

21
00:01:12.826 --> 00:01:18.312
He has a fully commented code pen here
that shows you all of the things and

22
00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:22.885
all the reasons he's made
the choices that he's made, and

23
00:01:22.885 --> 00:01:28.739
he also added this thing called focus,
within which is another pseudo class

24
00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:34.437
that we have inside of CSS at this point,
it's fairly well-supported.

25
00:01:34.437 --> 00:01:38.337
When he wrote this code pen, it was not
so, he actually wrote a polyfill for it.

26
00:01:38.337 --> 00:01:44.226
In JavaScript, you won't need this
polyfill at this point in time.

27
00:01:44.226 --> 00:01:46.350
But that is what we're
going to start with here.

28
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.315
All right, so we are going to start by,
go back over to my HTML here.

29
00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:57.273
And I don't think there's a whole
lot that's different here.

30
00:01:57.273 --> 00:02:00.128
I am going to add this field set.

31
00:02:00.128 --> 00:02:01.918
We have the idea of mode switcher.

32
00:02:01.918 --> 00:02:08.067
I'm also going to add to this
a class of radio-switch.

33
00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:09.795
This is going to make things faster for

34
00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:12.398
styling because that's what
Scott used in his code pen.

35
00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:15.635
So we're gonna copy that over.

36
00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.170
We have a legend.

37
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.878
We have our various radio buttons in
place, and the styling for those.

38
00:02:23.878 --> 00:02:27.583
He has called his by
slightly different names.

39
00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:30.866
So the thing we're gonna change here
is we are gonna call the name here.

40
00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:35.371
We're gonna call this color-scheme.

41
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:42.928
And we're gonna change the second
one down here, color hyphen scheme.

42
00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:46.740
And that's pretty much all the changes
that we're gnna make to our HTML.

43
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.741
Just a couple of little tweaks here, and

44
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:55.486
our HTML is similar enough to what he has
to make copying over his styles work.

45
00:02:55.486 --> 00:03:00.017
So here in our CSS,
what I'm going to do is,

46
00:03:00.017 --> 00:03:04.064
first, I'm going to copy all of this.

47
00:03:04.064 --> 00:03:08.944
Yee ha,
not the body down here at the bottom, but

48
00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:13.944
basically all the way down the line,
133, and

49
00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:19.062
then in my code, pen here,
one of the things that we

50
00:03:19.062 --> 00:03:25.403
can do To add this just after field
set I am gonna put in at layer.

51
00:03:25.403 --> 00:03:33.341
And I'm gonna call this switch CSS layers
have to do with the cascade and styling.

52
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:35.517
I'm gonna use it in this case,

53
00:03:35.517 --> 00:03:40.723
just to show that this is the code that
came in from Scott's code pen here.

54
00:03:40.723 --> 00:03:45.260
And just kinda group it all
together cuz there is a lot of it.

55
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.960
And what I can do at this point is I can
take out some of these comments, and

56
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.135
I can start making a few changes.

57
00:03:52.135 --> 00:03:56.979
So as you see,
we basically have two separate

58
00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:01.449
switches right now, which is kinda fun.

59
00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.917
We have to actually click
each one individually

60
00:04:05.917 --> 00:04:09.832
[LAUGH] In order to
make that work amazing.

61
00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:15.963
Okay, so let's go through and
get this together.

62
00:04:15.963 --> 00:04:19.747
So we have our radio switch,
border none, padding zero,

63
00:04:19.747 --> 00:04:21.843
white-space new wrap to this.

64
00:04:21.843 --> 00:04:27.554
I'm going to add display flex

65
00:04:27.554 --> 00:04:32.813
justify content, flex end

66
00:04:35.063 --> 00:04:40.689
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And margin-bottom 2rem.

67
00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:45.845
So this should, eventually,
if it doesn't immediately,

68
00:04:45.845 --> 00:04:49.998
will push it all the way
on over to the right side.

69
00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:54.265
We're gonna make the label
text a little bit smaller.

70
00:04:54.265 --> 00:04:59.171
Here, under radio-switch legend,

71
00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:02.848
I am going to add, or sorry,

72
00:05:02.848 --> 00:05:07.458
not legend I need to find the label.

73
00:05:07.458 --> 00:05:15.803
Under the label,
I am going to add a font size of 0.9 rem.

74
00:05:15.803 --> 00:05:20.874
You could certainly use the techniques
we have been using where

75
00:05:20.874 --> 00:05:26.521
we have worked with rescaling depending
on using the CALP function and

76
00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:29.979
so forth,
you could do all of that as well.

77
00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.287
And then I'm going to make
some changes to our colors.

78
00:05:36.247 --> 00:05:41.146
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And that's gonna be
down here under the focus within.

79
00:05:41.146 --> 00:05:45.532
So I'm just taking out these comments
just to have things take a little bit

80
00:05:45.532 --> 00:05:46.247
less room.

81
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.836
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There is
a polyfill class here.

82
00:05:54.836 --> 00:06:00.075
We don't need the polyfill class
because we don't need the polyfills

83
00:06:00.075 --> 00:06:04.781
changing our colors in the switch
radio focus-within label,

84
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:08.773
first of type after so
here in our box shadow for this,

85
00:06:08.773 --> 00:06:15.677
we are going to change this to,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Var(--white).

86
00:06:19.855 --> 00:06:24.371
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And var (--marina)
make it blend with our color scheme

87
00:06:24.371 --> 00:06:26.038
a little bit better.

88
00:06:33.904 --> 00:06:40.134
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We're gonna add
a little bit of a border var(--onyx)

89
00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:45.345
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,

90
00:06:45.345 --> 00:06:49.524
we're going to add in the labels,

91
00:06:49.524 --> 00:06:55.299
our background is gonna be var (--white).

92
00:06:59.347 --> 00:07:00.991
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Onyx.

93
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.994
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and then down

94
00:07:15.994 --> 00:07:22.493
here,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: First type

95
00:07:22.493 --> 00:07:31.083
checked after this is gonna be Marina,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

96
00:07:38.856 --> 00:07:39.681
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and

97
00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:43.729
I suspect I need to get rid
of my field set style here.

98
00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:46.851
So let me get rid of this.

99
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:49.371
And it may be that I left my divs in here.

100
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:56.261
I bet this is causing the problem,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Because

101
00:07:56.261 --> 00:07:58.751
we don't want those separated.

102
00:07:58.751 --> 00:07:59.796
There we go.

103
00:07:59.796 --> 00:08:02.821
Okay, you gotta take those
DIVS out in your HTML, and

104
00:08:02.821 --> 00:08:05.588
that will put the two things
on top of each other.

105
00:08:05.588 --> 00:08:09.375
So now we should have
a switch that is working.

106
00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:12.068
Yeah, whoo.

107
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:19.422
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How amazing is that, okay?

108
00:08:19.422 --> 00:08:25.218
And when we make the screen bigger,
it's in a good spot here too.

109
00:08:25.218 --> 00:08:28.151
So you could center that on
the page if you want, on mobile or

110
00:08:28.151 --> 00:08:30.277
if you like it where it is,
you can keep it.

111
00:08:35.267 --> 00:08:38.064
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If you want
it centered here on mobile.

112
00:08:41.095 --> 00:08:47.721
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's see, this would
be justify content center, right?

113
00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:49.196
There we go.

114
00:08:49.196 --> 00:08:54.062
And then in your media query for

115
00:08:54.062 --> 00:09:01.361
radio switch and
come down to our media query,

116
00:09:01.361 --> 00:09:06.229
we will add.radio-switch,

117
00:09:06.229 --> 00:09:12.794
then we'd say justify content flex end.

118
00:09:12.794 --> 00:09:17.604
So now when we go here
to our larger screen.

119
00:09:17.604 --> 00:09:19.482
There it is over there
on the right-hand side.

120
00:09:19.482 --> 00:09:24.316
Yeah, and now we have the ability
to turn it on and off.

121
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.188
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How many of you are ever
gonna write this again inside of

122
00:09:31.188 --> 00:09:32.152
JavaScript.

123
00:09:32.152 --> 00:09:34.890
Never, we're done, yeah.

124
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.928
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Are there any issues with
older browsers that allow that control,

125
00:09:38.928 --> 00:09:39.512
though.

126
00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:42.068
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, most likely, yeah.

127
00:09:42.068 --> 00:09:47.687
So the things that make this
work well would be focus within.

128
00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:49.819
That's that's a property here.

129
00:09:49.819 --> 00:09:54.947
Let's open up, can I use, and

130
00:09:54.947 --> 00:10:01.070
so focus within is one of the things.

131
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.073
Okay, so that has pretty good support.

132
00:10:04.073 --> 00:10:06.257
How far back are you guys supporting?

133
00:10:06.257 --> 00:10:10.408
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Gosh,
we're not even i.e.11 anymore.

134
00:10:10.408 --> 00:10:12.782
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: No, we don't no it's
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

135
00:10:12.782 --> 00:10:14.010
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: We're past ie 11.

136
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.670
So it's pretty new,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Pretty new stuff?

137
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.252
Yeah, so this is 95.95%.

138
00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:24.410
So this focus within is a really
helpful one for accessibility purposes.

139
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.944
So that's one of them.

140
00:10:26.944 --> 00:10:31.600
We have the has selector was one of the-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: That's the one I was mostly

141
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.894
wondering about.

142
00:10:32.894 --> 00:10:40.508
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Has is only at 92.88,
but, that's still almost everything.

143
00:10:40.508 --> 00:10:46.439
And then we had light dark, light dark.

144
00:10:46.439 --> 00:10:50.570
So this is a little bit lower
at 86.88 at this moment in time.

145
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.513
And of course, people are adopting
new browsers all the time.

146
00:10:54.513 --> 00:10:57.789
So those are some of the big ones.

147
00:10:57.789 --> 00:11:02.744
Yeah, of course,
when you're working in government,

148
00:11:02.744 --> 00:11:06.460
you do have to support older browsers, and

149
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.913
so some of the coolest stuff
takes a while to get to.
