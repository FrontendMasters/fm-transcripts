00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.880
So all of this boils down to is,
how do I basically differentiate?

2
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.210
How do I stand out from
the competitors in the marketplace?

3
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.699
And I can stand out with my features and
functionality by solving and

4
00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:17.439
addressing a problem that isn't
being addressed by the competitors.

5
00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.213
And market research and user feedback
can help you find problems with your

6
00:00:22.213 --> 00:00:25.063
competitors that they haven't solved, or

7
00:00:25.063 --> 00:00:29.780
that they're addressing
inadequately that you can address.

8
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.260
You can enhance existing features.

9
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.188
You can take something that is already
done by competitors and do it faster in

10
00:00:37.188 --> 00:00:41.890
a more user-friendly way or
with more powerful features built into it.

11
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.504
You could differentiate
with technology as well,

12
00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:50.545
using emerging technologies like
the AI example I gave or with offering

13
00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:57.724
better security than your competitors, or
improve performance over your competitors.

14
00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:01.190
You can differentiate with
user experience, right?

15
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.200
You can provide that better on-board
experience that I was talking

16
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.950
about earlier.

17
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.351
You can ensure that those repeat actions
that people are taking again and

18
00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:12.900
again in your app are not painful,
are not annoying.

19
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.732
You can ensure that your apps work
on the broadest range of devices and

20
00:01:17.732 --> 00:01:20.816
for the broadest possible
audience that you

21
00:01:20.816 --> 00:01:24.587
are targeting within
the context of your targeting.

22
00:01:25.687 --> 00:01:29.857
But the big one, of course,
is you can differentiate with pricing.

23
00:01:29.857 --> 00:01:33.037
And often it comes back to
a conversation around pricing.

24
00:01:33.037 --> 00:01:35.647
Pricing is one of
the hardest things to do.

25
00:01:35.647 --> 00:01:37.421
And there are lots of ways,

26
00:01:37.421 --> 00:01:42.591
although we'll talk about pricing many
times through this course, but you can

27
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:47.722
use pricing as a way of differentiating
yourself from the competition.

28
00:01:47.722 --> 00:01:52.859
So for example, you can use a one-off
payment for your product while everybody

29
00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:58.692
else does subscriptions, people are all
getting sick of yet another subscription.

30
00:01:58.692 --> 00:02:02.647
So maybe you could do
a one-off option instead.

31
00:02:02.647 --> 00:02:05.843
Maybe you could offer a freemium version,
right,

32
00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:08.741
there's a free trial that
can do the basics and

33
00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:14.067
it can be a great way of establishing
yourself in a crowded marketplace.

34
00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:16.047
You might wanna go entirely free, right?

35
00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:19.087
There is a place for that.

36
00:02:19.087 --> 00:02:24.476
And actually, there's some
interesting research that says,

37
00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:28.564
if you ask for tips or
for donations, actually,

38
00:02:28.564 --> 00:02:33.270
that can be a way of running
a smaller business, right?

39
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.733
I mean,
it wouldn't scale particularly well, but

40
00:02:36.733 --> 00:02:41.769
if you're just creating something for
a bit of fun and you wanna make a little

41
00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.664
bit of money off of it on the side, then
tips and donations could work for you.

42
00:02:47.664 --> 00:02:51.734
Or long side that I guess,
is the pay as much as you like

43
00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:56.274
option which is basically the same thing,
isn't it?

44
00:02:56.274 --> 00:03:01.201
And then there's the value added services
or value added features that you could.

45
00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:04.790
So the core offering might
be a very low price but

46
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.311
you charge for extras that get
added on to it in various ways.

47
00:03:10.311 --> 00:03:14.179
So there are ways of doing
pricing differently to

48
00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:19.751
your competitors that may appeal
to a certain market group.

49
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:24.176
So, one of the big things that you see
from well-established competitors in

50
00:03:24.176 --> 00:03:29.077
the marketplace, is they've added feature
after feature after feature over time,

51
00:03:29.077 --> 00:03:32.160
and they're charging for
all of this as a big bundle.

52
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.147
And from a user's perspective,
you go along and say, I wanna do that,

53
00:03:36.147 --> 00:03:38.020
but I don't care about the rest.

54
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.999
I don't wanna be paying for
all of the rest, right?

55
00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:43.808
And so there's an opportunity there.

56
00:03:43.808 --> 00:03:46.203
There are lots of different
ways of working with pricing.

57
00:03:46.203 --> 00:03:51.144
Pricing is a really complicated issue that
we will be coming back to because it is

58
00:03:51.144 --> 00:03:53.149
the trickiest thing to get right
