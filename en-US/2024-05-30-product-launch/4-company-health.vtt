1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
It may also be appropriate
to look at the company's

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.603
health in terms of how they're operating.

3
00:00:09.603 --> 00:00:14.396
So do they have funding and investment?

4
00:00:14.396 --> 00:00:17.889
And how recently have they got investment,
and

5
00:00:17.889 --> 00:00:23.579
how many rounds of investment have they
had if they have that kind of company?

6
00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.846
Now, the reason that I suggest this

7
00:00:28.846 --> 00:00:35.176
is because investors are very demanding.

8
00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:41.209
And there are a lot of downsides that
come with getting venture capital, and

9
00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:46.779
a company can very quickly implode
if it's taken a lot of investment.

10
00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:50.577
And that then opens up an opportunity,
right?

11
00:00:50.577 --> 00:00:52.758
So I can give you a real example of this.

12
00:00:52.758 --> 00:00:58.346
There's a budgeting app that I've used for
years called YNAB, You Need a Budget.

13
00:00:58.346 --> 00:01:02.971
I don't think it's ever taken investment,
I might be wrong, but

14
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:06.617
it's certainly not primarily
operated like that.

15
00:01:06.617 --> 00:01:12.788
And it's been the kind of minor player
in the market compared to Mint,

16
00:01:12.788 --> 00:01:16.563
right, which I'm sure you've heard of.

17
00:01:16.563 --> 00:01:21.970
And Mint was venture capital-based and
then imploded suddenly, and

18
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.213
YNAB have done an amazing job at basically
saying, hey, did you use to use Mint?

19
00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:32.422
This is how you move across to YNAB, so
there was a market opportunity there.

20
00:01:32.422 --> 00:01:36.690
So you can look at a kind
of competitor and go, well,

21
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.703
they've taken a lot of investment.

22
00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:43.210
And the last investment they
took was quite a long time ago.

23
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.143
They must be coming to
the end of their runway.

24
00:01:46.143 --> 00:01:50.954
There might be an opportunity here, right?

25
00:01:50.954 --> 00:01:55.282
And then growth metrics,
how much are they growing,

26
00:01:55.282 --> 00:02:01.065
are they expanding, and particularly
what areas are they growing in?

27
00:02:01.065 --> 00:02:05.172
So for example, geographic expansion,

28
00:02:05.172 --> 00:02:09.876
because, for example, what's the one here?

29
00:02:09.876 --> 00:02:13.453
FreshBooks, I don't know whether you've
heard it, it's like accounting software.

30
00:02:13.453 --> 00:02:16.312
Yeah, yeah, it's big over here, right?

31
00:02:16.312 --> 00:02:20.369
They've hardly got any footprint
in the UK because, in the UK,

32
00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:25.049
there's something called FreeAgent,
which is basically FreshBooks.

33
00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:30.606
Okay, so FreeAgent were able to say,
we're focused on

34
00:02:30.606 --> 00:02:36.296
the UK market with the UK tax,
the UK issues that we have.

35
00:02:36.296 --> 00:02:39.570
And so they have dominated
the market in a geographical area.

36
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.216
So you need to pay attention to where
competitors are operating, all right?

37
00:02:44.216 --> 00:02:47.061
&gt;&gt; Where do you get this information from?

38
00:02:47.061 --> 00:02:49.899
&gt;&gt; It's not hard to find, in fact.

39
00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:54.088
I mean, a lot of the time
it's on their website, right?

40
00:02:54.088 --> 00:02:57.966
If you dig into that About section
that nobody ever looks at,

41
00:02:57.966 --> 00:02:59.572
you can find it in there.

42
00:02:59.572 --> 00:03:04.900
You can also search for them information
on places like Crunchbase and

43
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.515
it'll tell you whether they've
had previous investment.

44
00:03:09.515 --> 00:03:14.240
A quick Google of the name of
the company and investment,

45
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.873
for example,
will often tell you what you need to know.

46
00:03:18.873 --> 00:03:21.432
So it's not actually as
difficult as you think.

47
00:03:21.432 --> 00:03:24.988
I mean, you might miss stuff,
right, and that's fair enough.

48
00:03:24.988 --> 00:03:27.530
We're not trying to be super thorough,

49
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.054
we're just trying to get
a picture of what's going on.

50
00:03:31.054 --> 00:03:34.330
And I know I'm throwing a lot of
different things to look at and

51
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.032
it might be a bit overwhelming.

52
00:03:36.032 --> 00:03:39.305
You can go as deeply or
otherwise into this,

53
00:03:39.305 --> 00:03:42.319
depending on how risk-averse you are.

54
00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.803
I'm very risk-averse as a person,
so I don't wanna waste my time and

55
00:03:46.803 --> 00:03:51.751
money, and so I tend to get quite into
the weeds of this kind of stuff, right?

56
00:03:51.751 --> 00:03:57.388
But you might be like, well, I'm half
doing this for fun anyway, so I'm willing

57
00:03:57.388 --> 00:04:02.467
to kind of not worry too much about
that side of things, and that's okay.

58
00:04:02.467 --> 00:04:06.352
As long as you're going into it
with your eyes open, it's fine.

59
00:04:06.352 --> 00:04:12.114
You could be as cavalier or
as risk-averse as you wanted.

60
00:04:12.114 --> 00:04:16.098
I look at innovation, so I tend to
keep an eye on what new features or

61
00:04:16.098 --> 00:04:18.602
products they've recently rolled out.

62
00:04:18.602 --> 00:04:24.582
A lot of apps have roadmaps on them of
what they've done and what they're doing.

63
00:04:24.582 --> 00:04:29.334
They've also often got newsletters,
where you could look through their back

64
00:04:29.334 --> 00:04:33.582
catalog and you'll see how often
they're releasing new features and

65
00:04:33.582 --> 00:04:36.180
how often they're rolling out new stuff.

66
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.174
A company that is very slow in
rolling out new features or

67
00:04:41.174 --> 00:04:46.170
improvements, not just features,
often tends to lose

68
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.078
customers over time because
we like the new and shiny.

69
00:04:51.078 --> 00:04:55.719
And the other thing is you might find
a company that has stretched itself too

70
00:04:55.719 --> 00:05:00.139
thinly, a quite small company that
started another app and actually,

71
00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.474
their attention is on the other app,
not on this one.

72
00:05:03.474 --> 00:05:05.528
Yeah, Mark, go for it.

73
00:05:05.528 --> 00:05:10.181
&gt;&gt; On the other end, I've seen over
the 12 years that we've been in business,

74
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:14.777
companies that are constantly launching
new thing, new thing, new thing.

75
00:05:14.777 --> 00:05:18.956
And you're realizing that they're
actually running out of steam.

76
00:05:18.956 --> 00:05:21.641
They don't have a solid business model,
and

77
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:24.192
they often go out of business right after.

78
00:05:24.192 --> 00:05:26.479
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no,
that is a fair point, actually.

79
00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.864
Yeah, I hadn't considered that, I agree.

80
00:05:28.864 --> 00:05:30.117
&gt;&gt; It happens all of the time.

81
00:05:30.117 --> 00:05:33.203
And the ones that kind of
focus on the core business and

82
00:05:33.203 --> 00:05:37.523
seem to just continue to add value to
that core thing are the ones that you can

83
00:05:37.523 --> 00:05:41.638
see that they actually have a real
business and they're succeeding for

84
00:05:41.638 --> 00:05:46.439
a decade plus, don't need to change as
much because they've really niched down to

85
00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:49.417
their market and
they're fulfilling it, right?

86
00:05:49.417 --> 00:05:50.163
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

87
00:05:50.163 --> 00:05:52.057
&gt;&gt; And so
that's the other end I've seen a lot.

88
00:05:52.057 --> 00:05:55.203
&gt;&gt; Listen to Mark.

89
00:05:55.203 --> 00:06:00.170
If I'm particularly caught up in
this rabbit hole of market research,

90
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.908
I'll also pay attention to things
like patents and technologies.

91
00:06:04.908 --> 00:06:08.894
Are they using any unique
piece of technology or

92
00:06:08.894 --> 00:06:15.283
they've got a particularly great tech
stack that gives them an advantage?

93
00:06:15.283 --> 00:06:20.247
But it's not really my area of expertise,
so I don't normally spend a lot of time

94
00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:23.246
on that, but
it might be of more interest to you.

95
00:06:23.246 --> 00:06:24.613
Talking of technology,

96
00:06:24.613 --> 00:06:28.785
there are some things I do pay attention
to from a technology side of things.

97
00:06:28.785 --> 00:06:32.884
I pay a lot of attention to performance,
does their apps run fast?

98
00:06:32.884 --> 00:06:35.156
Slow apps will drive people mad, and

99
00:06:35.156 --> 00:06:38.170
that can be another angle
you could get in there.

100
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:43.130
Reliability, is it like Twitter,
up and down, as it used to be?

101
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.995
No, that's just dating me,
that reference, isn't it, really.

102
00:06:45.995 --> 00:06:49.528
Twitter hasn't been up and down for years.

103
00:06:49.528 --> 00:06:53.447
Security, have they had really
any high-profile breaches?

104
00:06:53.447 --> 00:06:57.898
That can often be a good
opportunity to step in.

105
00:06:57.898 --> 00:07:00.879
Privacy, what are they
doing with customer data?

106
00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:04.758
Is that an opportunity to
differentiate yourself?

107
00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:10.103
So that's kind of how I look at
competitors, and I'll spend a little

108
00:07:10.103 --> 00:07:15.831
while picking over that stuff and
kind of gathering all the information.

109
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:17.452
But I mean, then it's really,

110
00:07:17.452 --> 00:07:21.367
well, what do you do with all this
information once you've got it, really?

111
00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:24.866
Cuz it's all well and good collecting it,
but if you don't do anything with it,

112
00:07:24.866 --> 00:07:26.056
you've wasted your time.

113
00:07:26.056 --> 00:07:28.138
So I primarily use it for

114
00:07:28.138 --> 00:07:33.461
spotting gaps in the market where
I might be able to sneak in.

115
00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:36.220
So I'm looking for feature gaps,

116
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.361
missing features that might
include things like integration or

117
00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:47.086
data privacy, things that they're
not handling particularly well.

118
00:07:47.086 --> 00:07:49.363
I look for experience gaps.

119
00:07:49.363 --> 00:07:53.980
In other words, their app's UI sucks,
or their customer service sucks, or

120
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.839
something along those lines.

121
00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:58.472
But my favorite of all is audience gaps.

122
00:07:58.472 --> 00:08:03.209
Is there a niche or a region that
the competitor has failed to target?

123
00:08:03.209 --> 00:08:10.447
For me, that's the strongest in is
when there is something like that.

124
00:08:10.447 --> 00:08:12.536
I also, yeah, go for it.

125
00:08:12.536 --> 00:08:17.653
&gt;&gt; So I'm just thinking that you've done
all this research and you find out that

126
00:08:17.653 --> 00:08:22.462
company X has some feature gaps,
experience gaps, and audience gaps.

127
00:08:22.462 --> 00:08:22.993
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

128
00:08:22.993 --> 00:08:28.766
&gt;&gt; What about just going to them and
pitching them your idea?

129
00:08:28.766 --> 00:08:33.289
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, if that's
something that you want to do and

130
00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:38.418
the way you wanna go, then by all
means do it, that's perfectly valid.

131
00:08:38.418 --> 00:08:42.770
It depends on what you wanna get out
of this at the end of the day, right?

132
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.943
If you're after income
that's not related to,

133
00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:53.147
that you can get a regular income,
if you like the idea of running an app,

134
00:08:53.147 --> 00:08:58.366
those kinds of things,
then maybe you don't wanna do that.

135
00:08:58.366 --> 00:09:03.332
But if you wanna, get then on board, and
you like the idea of having a big partner

136
00:09:03.332 --> 00:09:07.856
and you don't mind sharing ownership
over it and those kinds of things,

137
00:09:07.856 --> 00:09:10.180
then absolutely, it's an option.

138
00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.076
Yeah, go.

139
00:09:11.076 --> 00:09:14.871
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think what you're talking
about is channel partnerships, and

140
00:09:14.871 --> 00:09:17.432
it's a big way that we've
grown over the years.

141
00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:21.793
So in the early days, we licensed all
of our courses to Pluralsight, and

142
00:09:21.793 --> 00:09:25.453
Pluralsight was the 100 pound
gorilla in the early days.

143
00:09:25.453 --> 00:09:29.307
And so that's a channel partnership,
taking your product and

144
00:09:29.307 --> 00:09:33.247
putting it on a marketplace, or
whatever, getting fees back.

145
00:09:33.247 --> 00:09:35.724
And I think a lot of these apps,

146
00:09:35.724 --> 00:09:40.882
they also have channels like plug-ins or
something like that.

147
00:09:40.882 --> 00:09:44.487
And if you go into the plug-in marketplace
and you publish a plug-in there,

148
00:09:44.487 --> 00:09:47.386
that's a way that you can get
some distribution for your app.

149
00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:53.826
And so any time that large products
have these kind of marketplaces or

150
00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:58.823
plug-ins or whatever,
think about how can I somehow

151
00:09:58.823 --> 00:10:03.279
leverage the large thing
to get some traction?

152
00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:06.280
Yeah, you're not gonna make
as much money doing that, but

153
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.462
you're gonna at least get awareness
that then you can go off and

154
00:10:09.462 --> 00:10:11.761
build a sustainable
business in the future.

155
00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:14.741
&gt;&gt; And
I think that last part is the key part,

156
00:10:14.741 --> 00:10:19.424
because one of the big mistakes that
I see people make quite a lot is

157
00:10:19.424 --> 00:10:24.214
they build their business on
somebody else's business, right?

158
00:10:24.214 --> 00:10:27.844
And when you do that,
you are very vulnerable.

159
00:10:27.844 --> 00:10:33.336
So you see it all the time with people who
sell via Etsy or they sell via Amazon.

160
00:10:33.336 --> 00:10:35.726
Amazon is the worst for it, right?

161
00:10:35.726 --> 00:10:40.024
People sell on the Amazon Marketplace
cuz it's nice and easy to do.

162
00:10:40.024 --> 00:10:43.268
And then, Amazon are tracking
all the data and they go,

163
00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:46.871
well, this thing sells very well,
I'm gonna sell that now.

164
00:10:46.871 --> 00:10:50.819
And they just decimate other people's
businesses in the blink of an eye.

165
00:10:50.819 --> 00:10:55.517
Another really common one is people
that build their business on somebody

166
00:10:55.517 --> 00:10:56.433
else's API.

167
00:10:56.433 --> 00:11:00.019
For a long time, well,
Twitter was a great example of that.

168
00:11:00.019 --> 00:11:05.693
Remember Tweetbot was a far better Twitter
client than the Twitter client was and

169
00:11:05.693 --> 00:11:07.703
we all used that for a while.

170
00:11:07.703 --> 00:11:12.305
And then suddenly at some point Twitter
said, well, we're changing our API so

171
00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:16.026
you can't use it like that and
decimated their business again.

172
00:11:16.026 --> 00:11:20.890
So spotting gaps is obviously a big
part of what we get out of doing

173
00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:24.599
market research, but
it's not the only thing.

174
00:11:24.599 --> 00:11:28.306
I think also market research
can help us innovate and

175
00:11:28.306 --> 00:11:33.624
move a sector forward and move our own
product and service forward as well.

176
00:11:33.624 --> 00:11:39.042
So we can look at technology, for example,
cuz technology is evolving all the time,

177
00:11:39.042 --> 00:11:43.784
and a lot of competitors that kind of,
understandably, if their existing

178
00:11:43.784 --> 00:11:48.402
product's in the marketplace,
they're built on legacy technology.

179
00:11:48.402 --> 00:11:51.387
They don't get to use the new shiny toys.

180
00:11:51.387 --> 00:11:57.278
That's what you get to do, and they
might retrofit some of those things in,

181
00:11:57.278 --> 00:12:01.804
but that's not the same as
building them in from scratch.

182
00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:05.057
And we can see this at the moment with AI,

183
00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:10.143
every product you can possibly
imagine is cramming AI into it.

184
00:12:10.143 --> 00:12:14.394
But that's very different to building an
app that's got AI in from the ground up.

185
00:12:14.394 --> 00:12:17.603
So there are opportunities for
us to innovate and

186
00:12:17.603 --> 00:12:22.075
separate ourselves from the competitors
using new technologies.

187
00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:26.208
Values is another great way of innovating.

188
00:12:26.208 --> 00:12:32.440
So it doesn't apply in every situation,
but people's values change over time.

189
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.637
And so if you're launching an app today,
you can tap in more to

190
00:12:36.637 --> 00:12:41.186
the values that people have today,
rather than those in the past.

191
00:12:41.186 --> 00:12:45.869
So great examples are that
sustainability is very high on

192
00:12:45.869 --> 00:12:49.682
people's agenda these days, as is privacy.

193
00:12:49.682 --> 00:12:56.470
And so you can build an app with those
things baked in from the beginning, okay?

194
00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:01.574
And that gives you a story to tell in the
market, gives you a competitive advantage.

195
00:13:01.574 --> 00:13:05.337
You couldn't build a whole business
just around those things, but

196
00:13:05.337 --> 00:13:08.318
it's another aspect that
you can bring to the table.

197
00:13:08.318 --> 00:13:11.655
And then also, you can innovate
with business models as well.

198
00:13:11.655 --> 00:13:16.210
So there are alternative business
models that other people within

199
00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:21.098
the market might not be using,
the Freeman model or flexible pricing.

200
00:13:21.098 --> 00:13:24.557
There's lots of different
opportunities and, as I said,

201
00:13:24.557 --> 00:13:27.193
we'll get into pricing and
a lot more later.

202
00:13:27.193 --> 00:13:30.682
So there are, you can look for
gaps in the market, you can look for

203
00:13:30.682 --> 00:13:33.982
opportunities to innovate in the market,
and you can look for

204
00:13:33.982 --> 00:13:36.289
opportunities to optimize in the market.

205
00:13:36.289 --> 00:13:39.835
In other words, do it better
than the competitors are doing.

206
00:13:39.835 --> 00:13:42.631
So you can make it faster, right?

207
00:13:42.631 --> 00:13:45.992
Can you enable people to
achieve more in less time?

208
00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:49.496
That's always a big selling point for
a lot of people, so

209
00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:51.540
you can gain an advantage there.

210
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.141
You might just make it better.

211
00:13:53.141 --> 00:13:55.977
Can you offer the ability to do more or

212
00:13:55.977 --> 00:13:59.649
to a higher standard
than the competitors can?

213
00:13:59.649 --> 00:14:03.466
And the other one is the obvious one,
can you make it cheaper?

214
00:14:03.466 --> 00:14:07.315
Can you offer the same as competitors but
at a lower price point?

215
00:14:07.315 --> 00:14:12.093
So there are lots of ways that you can
take what you're learning about your

216
00:14:12.093 --> 00:14:17.181
competitors and actually apply that to
the direction you go with your own app or

217
00:14:17.181 --> 00:14:18.823
your own business idea.
