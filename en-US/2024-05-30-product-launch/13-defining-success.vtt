1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.106
Let's start with defining success, okay.

2
00:00:04.106 --> 00:00:08.004
How are we going to judge
the success of our campaign and

3
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:10.560
the validity of our business idea.

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.249
We have a lot of different options
of how we could do this, all right?

5
00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:20.107
And to a large degree, it's going to be
down to what your comfortable with and

6
00:00:20.107 --> 00:00:24.395
what you feel is appropriate to
your particular audience, right?

7
00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:30.794
So I'm gonna show you all the various
options that I've ever used doing this and

8
00:00:30.794 --> 00:00:37.301
I will leave it to you to make a judgment
call of what you feel is most appropriate.

9
00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:40.869
One approach is the stay
informed approach, right?

10
00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:45.231
So they head to the landing page and
they hit the landing page.

11
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:49.624
It tells them all about the product,
everything that you're gonna do,

12
00:00:49.624 --> 00:00:52.370
all the cool stuff that
it's gonna involve.

13
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.750
And then your call to action is follow for

14
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.553
developments of whatever
the product name is.

15
00:00:57.553 --> 00:01:01.457
And something like you'll get regular
updates you'll get early access and

16
00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:04.274
you'll get heavy discount
when the things launched.

17
00:01:04.274 --> 00:01:07.882
So our call to action is sign up for
a mailing list, right?

18
00:01:07.882 --> 00:01:12.306
Now, although this approach does
provide a general sense of someone's

19
00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:16.946
interest in the app, it obviously
doesn't indicate whether they actually

20
00:01:16.946 --> 00:01:20.155
would part with money if
push came to shove, right?

21
00:01:20.155 --> 00:01:24.507
We can put the price of what
the product will be on the page and so

22
00:01:24.507 --> 00:01:29.367
that will give you some indication
because if people aren't signing

23
00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:33.827
up even to find out about it,
then price might well be a factor.

24
00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:38.667
But it's got limits to
it fairly obviously.

25
00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:43.494
However, what it does give us is
an opportunity to nurture that lead

26
00:01:43.494 --> 00:01:46.880
that person that fills
in their email address,

27
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.804
hopefully to encourage them to
actually buy at the end of it, right?

28
00:01:51.804 --> 00:01:56.740
So it's kind of the worst option
from accurately giving you

29
00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.401
a sense of how much this could work,
right?

30
00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:04.499
But the almost the best
option in terms of nurturing

31
00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:07.558
an audience that we can sell to later.

32
00:02:07.558 --> 00:02:12.509
So typically, I would use this
approach if I had an audience that

33
00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:17.554
was hypersensitive to any kind of
feeling of being manipulated or

34
00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:20.048
were a super cynical audience.

35
00:02:20.048 --> 00:02:23.599
I'd probably use approach if I'm
being honest with developers, for

36
00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:24.570
example, right?

37
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.846
You guys are very savvy,
you're very switched on,

38
00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:32.760
you're very aware of things like dark
patterns and you're quite opinionated

39
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.347
about certain stuff and
how you feel the web should work.

40
00:02:36.347 --> 00:02:40.822
So it probably would be my preferred
approach with a group like you.

41
00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:44.852
There is a second approach, however, that
I would be willing to use with developers

42
00:02:44.852 --> 00:02:48.109
that I think would work which is
the waiting list approach, right?

43
00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:53.103
So in this case,
we are basically saying join the waiting

44
00:02:53.103 --> 00:02:56.858
list as we gradually roll out the product.

45
00:02:56.858 --> 00:03:03.178
Now, in truth that's creates this
high sense of demand, right?

46
00:03:03.178 --> 00:03:06.461
Makes you think that the product
has been super popular, so

47
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:10.662
they're having to roll out the design
slowly, which is, you could argue,

48
00:03:10.662 --> 00:03:14.883
a little deceptive as you haven't even
started to build it yet, all right?

49
00:03:14.883 --> 00:03:19.409
So as you can see, there is a moral
element here of what you feel you're

50
00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.811
comfortable with in the situation.

51
00:03:21.811 --> 00:03:25.821
But it does still allow you
to nurture the lead, right?

52
00:03:25.821 --> 00:03:29.936
Once someone signs up for the mailing
list, you can still follow up, but

53
00:03:29.936 --> 00:03:31.892
you could consider it, as I said,

54
00:03:31.892 --> 00:03:35.959
to be slightly less honest about
the state of the app and where it's at.

55
00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.086
Now, another option is what I call
the fake order approach, right?

56
00:03:42.086 --> 00:03:46.992
So in this scenario,
what we're gonna do is we're

57
00:03:46.992 --> 00:03:51.108
gonna show it as if it is a real app,
right?

58
00:03:51.108 --> 00:03:56.223
With a real product that's been launched,
and we'll have a message like buy

59
00:03:56.223 --> 00:04:01.180
today for X amount, access all
the features, secure early bird pricing,

60
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.529
buy now for 20% off all the normal
things you'd expect to see.

61
00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:09.533
And then when someone clicks
on that buy now button,

62
00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:14.902
it'll say something along the lines
of unfortunately this has not yet

63
00:04:14.902 --> 00:04:18.821
been completed and
we will be ready to launch soon.

64
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:23.508
And you may then want to continue
with follow up action of.

65
00:04:23.508 --> 00:04:28.481
But you can sign up to our mailing list to
be informed when it goes live if you want,

66
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:29.003
right?

67
00:04:29.003 --> 00:04:32.110
Now offering the user option to buy.

68
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.934
But then when you click yeah,
you can form to sign up instead.

69
00:04:35.934 --> 00:04:40.835
It gives the most accurate of the buying
experiences because someone is thinking

70
00:04:40.835 --> 00:04:45.662
they're actually really going to buy in
there clicking on a button that says I am

71
00:04:45.662 --> 00:04:46.757
buying, right?

72
00:04:46.757 --> 00:04:50.209
But obviously it could
alienate some audiences.

73
00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:55.502
It's like wow, I thought it was buying and
now it's I'm not and

74
00:04:55.502 --> 00:04:59.142
so you could pay people
off in that process.

75
00:04:59.142 --> 00:05:02.685
So it's a judgement call, it's difficult.

76
00:05:02.685 --> 00:05:06.745
You will have got to know your audience
by then and whether you feel that's

77
00:05:06.745 --> 00:05:10.165
appropriate and whether you
feel it's something you can do.

78
00:05:10.165 --> 00:05:15.710
There is a final option,
which in some ways is more honest and

79
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.657
straightforward with people.

80
00:05:18.657 --> 00:05:23.128
But you might be uncomfortable with it for
other reasons,

81
00:05:23.128 --> 00:05:26.329
which is the preorder approach, right?

82
00:05:26.329 --> 00:05:31.285
So in this, we say, preorder today and
save x amount to encourage people to do

83
00:05:31.285 --> 00:05:35.178
it and they actually enter their
credit card information and

84
00:05:35.178 --> 00:05:37.485
that they preordered the product.

85
00:05:37.485 --> 00:05:41.553
The money isn't taken just to be clear and
we would need to make this clear on

86
00:05:41.553 --> 00:05:45.377
the landing page, the money is not
taken from their account, right?

87
00:05:45.377 --> 00:05:48.379
It's literally preordered, okay?

88
00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:52.854
Gumroad, for example,
supports this functionality.

89
00:05:52.854 --> 00:05:57.652
So you're not taking money from people
because if you take money from people,

90
00:05:57.652 --> 00:06:02.247
then they'll start moaning if you're
not faster enough turning around.

91
00:06:02.247 --> 00:06:05.096
It turns into Kickstarter
basically in crowdfunding,

92
00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:06.862
which I will come onto in a minute.

93
00:06:06.862 --> 00:06:11.707
So I'm not suggesting that, but
what it does give you is a very

94
00:06:11.707 --> 00:06:16.472
accurate because they are committing
to a sale now, right?

95
00:06:16.472 --> 00:06:20.728
Now, yes, they could write to you and
cancel their preorder later and

96
00:06:20.728 --> 00:06:25.292
fair enough but essentially,
it's as realistic as you can possibly get.

97
00:06:25.292 --> 00:06:30.398
So you're allowing users to preorder
a product normally for a heavy discount.

98
00:06:30.398 --> 00:06:34.538
I think it, you've got to, in some way
offset the fact that they're not gonna get

99
00:06:34.538 --> 00:06:37.728
the product now in order to create
the most realistic results.

100
00:06:37.728 --> 00:06:42.715
So offering a heavy discount is a way
of kind of balancing that to get

101
00:06:42.715 --> 00:06:44.593
you a best idea of sales.

102
00:06:44.593 --> 00:06:47.671
So it offers an actual buying experience,

103
00:06:47.671 --> 00:06:53.055
although the level will probably be
a little lower than it would normally,

104
00:06:53.055 --> 00:06:56.395
depending on how big the discount is,
right?

105
00:06:56.395 --> 00:06:59.758
So you can see how there are kind
of different options of doing it.

106
00:06:59.758 --> 00:07:04.240
And there are pros and
cons to these different options.

107
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.336
I'm actually, I'm very torn over it.

108
00:07:09.336 --> 00:07:13.749
I can't quite work out how I feel about
this one to be entirely honest with you.

109
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:17.363
And every time I do this test,
I kind of go back and

110
00:07:17.363 --> 00:07:20.459
forth about what I'm comfortable with.

111
00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:25.213
Which is why I'm a bit reluctant to
give you my advice here because I'm not

112
00:07:25.213 --> 00:07:27.677
100% sure I'm sure of my advice.

113
00:07:27.677 --> 00:07:32.879
I think in many ways the preorder
option is quite a good one because

114
00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:39.046
it's upfront it says that it's not
ready yet doesn't claim anything else.

115
00:07:39.046 --> 00:07:47.093
It's probably the most accurate because
it most replicates a real sale.

116
00:07:47.093 --> 00:07:51.083
And so, it feels like the most honest
approach to me at the moment but

117
00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:54.584
ask me again tomorrow and
I might feel differently, yeah.

118
00:07:54.584 --> 00:07:56.085
&gt;&gt; I personally love preorders.

119
00:07:56.085 --> 00:07:57.054
&gt;&gt; Right.

120
00:07:57.054 --> 00:07:59.848
&gt;&gt; But I'm an early adopter.

121
00:07:59.848 --> 00:08:00.606
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; For me,

122
00:08:00.606 --> 00:08:02.362
I feel like I'm getting in on something.

123
00:08:02.362 --> 00:08:05.029
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Before everybody else does.

124
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:07.206
And yeah, sometimes I feel like God,

125
00:08:07.206 --> 00:08:10.553
when am I ever gonna get that
thing that I just preordered?

126
00:08:10.553 --> 00:08:11.606
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

127
00:08:11.606 --> 00:08:15.029
&gt;&gt; But I'm also wondering, are you
suggesting also you could test all of

128
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:16.807
these
&gt;&gt; You could do if you want to test.

129
00:08:16.807 --> 00:08:17.444
&gt;&gt; For each one of them?

130
00:08:17.444 --> 00:08:21.193
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it depends on how much effort
you wanna put into the test campaign, but

131
00:08:21.193 --> 00:08:23.219
you could, yeah, you can run the order.

132
00:08:23.219 --> 00:08:25.821
&gt;&gt; You could collect a lot of
information from all of them, right?

133
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:27.429
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

134
00:08:27.429 --> 00:08:30.557
&gt;&gt; So for the person like me who likes
preordering versus somebody else who is

135
00:08:30.557 --> 00:08:32.581
like, no,
I just wanna be on the mailing list.

136
00:08:32.581 --> 00:08:33.801
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You're still getting both.

137
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:36.801
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely snd that's up to you.

138
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:39.805
What you wouldn't be able to do is all of
those things on a single landing page.

139
00:08:39.805 --> 00:08:41.357
You'd have to have multiple landing pages.

140
00:08:41.357 --> 00:08:44.033
But yeah, absolutely.

141
00:08:44.033 --> 00:08:50.261
I mean, there is one other option,
of course, which is crowdsourcing, right?

142
00:08:50.261 --> 00:08:53.342
So you could use a platform
like Kickstarter or

143
00:08:53.342 --> 00:08:57.926
Indigo as an option, I'm not a fan
of that, if I'm honest with you.

144
00:08:57.926 --> 00:09:01.474
I'm not a fan of it for
a couple of reasons.

145
00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:06.317
Reason number one,
is that I don't like taking people's money

146
00:09:06.317 --> 00:09:10.814
before I've got something to
actually give them, right?

147
00:09:10.814 --> 00:09:15.447
And I've seen a lot of Kickstarter
campaigns go horribly wrong,

148
00:09:15.447 --> 00:09:19.240
because people felt like
they've been ripped off and

149
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.453
that it's been a con and
all of the rest of it.

150
00:09:22.453 --> 00:09:24.746
So personally, I'm not a fan
of it from that point of view.

151
00:09:24.746 --> 00:09:29.943
The other problem that
I've got with them is that

152
00:09:29.943 --> 00:09:35.030
it's not solving
the fundamental problem of,

153
00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:44.821
Having a sustainable way of
targeting your audience, right?

154
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:49.951
If you're using a crowdfunding platform,
you're primarily using

155
00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:56.155
that crowdfunding platform as your lead
generator, as your customer generator.

156
00:09:56.155 --> 00:10:00.093
Now, you can use other methods as well,
but

157
00:10:00.093 --> 00:10:05.628
it skews your results and
gives a bit of a false impression of,

158
00:10:05.628 --> 00:10:11.822
whether you've got a sustainable business,
in my opinion anyway.

159
00:10:11.822 --> 00:10:16.467
Finally as well, those platforms do
tend to be err towards physical products

160
00:10:16.467 --> 00:10:21.264
with manufacturing costs associated

00:10:21.264 --> 00:10:23.830
So I probably wouldn't recommend that.

162
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:28.424
But I'm not, if you could get it to
work for you, knock yourselves out but

163
00:10:28.424 --> 00:10:30.588
that's just been my experience.
