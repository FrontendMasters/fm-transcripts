00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.008
&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to this course
on creating your big idea and

2
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:06.923
ensuring it has its
best chance of success.

3
00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:10.847
You've had a big idea for
a digital service or

4
00:00:10.847 --> 00:00:15.400
maybe an e-commerce site or
an app you wanna build.

5
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.063
How do you give it the best
chance of getting successful and

6
00:00:19.063 --> 00:00:23.716
achieving what you want, and
that's what we're going to be looking at.

7
00:00:23.716 --> 00:00:28.634
But before we get into that, I just
want to very briefly introduce myself,

8
00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:33.550
so my name is Paul Boag, I've been
working in the industry for 30 years,

9
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.685
I know I don't look that old, but
just trust me, I have been and

10
00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:41.541
I've been mainly focusing,
On user experience design.

11
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:46.499
But I do a lot of work at that kind of
crossroads between user experience design

12
00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:48.024
and marketing as well,

13
00:00:48.024 --> 00:00:52.010
which is gonna be very relevant
as we get into this more today.

14
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.843
I've got extensive experience
in conversion optimization and

15
00:00:56.843 --> 00:01:02.033
the kind of marketing adjacent skills
that go along Beside that, and

16
00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:07.689
I've helped dozens or dozens,
hundreds of clients in dozens of sectors.

17
00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.689
But I've worked with a lot of SaSS
applications in both B2C and B2B,

18
00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.654
and my clients kind of range from the big,

19
00:01:15.654 --> 00:01:20.767
impressive ones that you're always
supposed to say things like this.

20
00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:24.905
The Pumas of this world,
the Shopifys, the UK Government,

21
00:01:24.905 --> 00:01:29.854
all that kind of stuff, all the way
down to smaller startups as well, and

22
00:01:29.854 --> 00:01:32.634
to be honest, I enjoy them just as much.

23
00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:37.361
But there is one thing above all else
that you need to know about me today.

24
00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:43.203
This is crucial for the rest of this,
I'm a grumpy old man, I am a cynic.

25
00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:47.610
The longer I've done this, the more
grumpy I've got over the years, and

26
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.747
you've also got to remember that I
lived through the dot com bubble.

27
00:01:51.747 --> 00:01:56.102
So I'm completely cynical about
any kind of start up idea or

28
00:01:56.102 --> 00:02:00.108
any kind of what we're going
to get Venture capital and

29
00:02:00.108 --> 00:02:05.615
we're gonna take over the world and
anything like that, I am just grumpy.

30
00:02:05.615 --> 00:02:08.415
And one of the areas that I'm most

31
00:02:08.415 --> 00:02:12.816
grumpy about is the idea
of passive income, right?

32
00:02:12.816 --> 00:02:13.424
I'm media.

33
00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:18.049
Do you notice how positive this
workshop is gonna be today?

34
00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.869
So I'm really grumpy about
the whole idea of passive income,

35
00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:27.598
that there is some magic solution
where you can build an app or

36
00:02:27.598 --> 00:02:32.528
a digital service or drop shipping or
any of that kind of stuff.

37
00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:36.244
And suddenly money's just
gonna spontaneously appear.

38
00:02:36.244 --> 00:02:41.543
Now I don't wanna speak on behalf of
Mark that founded Front end masters but

39
00:02:41.543 --> 00:02:46.336
I'm pretty confident from what
I've seen that he's not sitting on

40
00:02:46.336 --> 00:02:49.952
a beach the whole time with
money just pouring in and

41
00:02:49.952 --> 00:02:53.844
he's kind of slowly sinking
under this pile of money.

42
00:02:53.844 --> 00:02:56.828
He actually does do stuff.

43
00:02:56.828 --> 00:03:00.063
I don't know whether his employees
would agree, but he's sitting here, so

44
00:03:00.063 --> 00:03:01.318
that's gotta be something.

45
00:03:01.318 --> 00:03:02.985
&gt;&gt; I'm not on a beach, unfortunately.

46
00:03:02.985 --> 00:03:04.409
&gt;&gt; You're not on a beach.

47
00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.123
Definitely not on a beach.

48
00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:12.018
And so the truth is, that this idea of
passive income is a little bit misleading.

49
00:03:12.018 --> 00:03:16.734
Now, it's not to say there are benefits
to building your own app and

50
00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:19.237
your own SaaS service or whatever.

51
00:03:19.237 --> 00:03:23.713
But the truth is it's a lot
more complicated than money's

52
00:03:23.713 --> 00:03:27.743
just gonna flow in while I'm being grumpy,
right?

53
00:03:27.743 --> 00:03:29.699
I will get more positive in a minute,
I promise.

54
00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:35.722
While I'm being grumpy, it's worth
saying that 90% of startups fail, right?

55
00:03:35.722 --> 00:03:38.595
And that's just the ones
that we know about.

56
00:03:38.595 --> 00:03:44.042
Let alone all of the thousands and
thousands of ideas that a freelancer

57
00:03:44.042 --> 00:03:48.759
has or a small agency has about
how to launch an app or an idea.

58
00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:52.694
So there's an incredibly
high failure rate.

59
00:03:52.694 --> 00:03:58.627
Can you tell that before now I've tried to
build something and it's failed horribly?

60
00:03:58.627 --> 00:04:03.126
And I think I'm not alone in that and
oftentimes with these courses,

61
00:04:03.126 --> 00:04:07.550
it's like we're gonna get somebody
who's been wildly successful

62
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.735
to talk about this kind of thing.

63
00:04:09.735 --> 00:04:13.202
But if you think about it,
they've got lucky.

64
00:04:13.202 --> 00:04:15.810
Yeah, sure,
they might have done some things right.

65
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.532
But you learn so much from failures as
well, and the mistakes that you've made.

66
00:04:20.532 --> 00:04:23.030
So actually,
as I've worked with clients and

67
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.536
some clients I've helped
to really succeed.

68
00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:28.622
Others, I've tried to help and we failed.

69
00:04:28.622 --> 00:04:31.519
Sometimes I've built something
myself that's failed.

70
00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:34.845
Sometimes I've built something
myself that's succeeded.

71
00:04:34.845 --> 00:04:38.833
And there's so
much to learn through those experiences.

72
00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:43.839
And over the years I've kind of
began to build up a bit of a picture

73
00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:49.616
of why people's startups, why their
big ideas, fail to be successful.

74
00:04:49.616 --> 00:04:53.929
And I would say, I mean there's
obviously lots of different reasons, but

75
00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:56.884
there are kind of three that
really stand out to me.

76
00:04:56.884 --> 00:05:00.202
That were gonna be explaining
Exploring in a lot more detail today.

77
00:05:00.202 --> 00:05:03.958
One, is they don't really
solve a real problem, okay?

78
00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:08.339
Many SaaS startups struggle
because they fail to solve

79
00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:12.922
a meaningful problem for
a big enough audience, right?

80
00:05:12.922 --> 00:05:18.256
It may make sense to you,
it may solve a problem that you have.

81
00:05:18.256 --> 00:05:24.111
But it doesn't mean it solves a meaningful
problem for big enough group of people.

82
00:05:24.111 --> 00:05:26.533
So that's one aspect of it.

83
00:05:26.533 --> 00:05:31.941
The second reason that most SaaS
apps fail is poor marketing,

84
00:05:31.941 --> 00:05:36.101
that having a robust strategy for
acquiring and

85
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:40.266
retaining customers It is essential,
right?

86
00:05:40.266 --> 00:05:43.398
You can have the best idea in the world,
but

87
00:05:43.398 --> 00:05:47.241
it doesn't mean that you're
gonna be successful.

88
00:05:47.241 --> 00:05:53.102
This whole idea of, what is it,
the cream rises to the top is BS, right?

89
00:05:53.102 --> 00:06:00.124
Who is the world's most famous Scientist?

90
00:06:00.124 --> 00:06:05.094
You'll probably think of Einstein,
you'll probably think of Stephen Hawkins,

91
00:06:05.094 --> 00:06:06.233
people like that.

92
00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:09.505
But there are many other
scientists who have achieved,

93
00:06:09.505 --> 00:06:13.473
maybe not as much as Einstein,
that's probably a bad example, but

94
00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:18.085
have certainly achieved as much as
Stephen Hawkins, you've never heard of.

95
00:06:18.085 --> 00:06:22.695
So the reason you've heard of those two
over others isn't just because they're

96
00:06:22.695 --> 00:06:25.150
the best in the field, although they are.

97
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.792
It's not just because they're
incredibly bright, although they are.

98
00:06:27.792 --> 00:06:30.134
It's because they're out there.

99
00:06:30.134 --> 00:06:31.886
And it's the same with a product.

100
00:06:31.886 --> 00:06:37.262
Just because you create a great product
doesn't mean anybody's gonna care or

101
00:06:37.262 --> 00:06:37.836
buy it.

102
00:06:37.836 --> 00:06:43.430
And then the third reason is there's
no real differentiation, okay?

103
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:49.029
So one of the reasons that the big
ideas often come about Is because we

104
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:55.822
see another product and we go, it doesn't
work quite the way I want it to, right?

105
00:06:55.822 --> 00:06:58.204
And so we create our own version of it or

106
00:06:58.204 --> 00:07:00.967
start thinking about
our own version of it.

107
00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:05.830
But that might not be enough to clearly
differentiate it in the marketplace.

108
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.910
That might not be a benefit
that somebody else can clearly

109
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.951
understand in the same way.

110
00:07:11.951 --> 00:07:14.429
So there you go, that's me done.

111
00:07:14.429 --> 00:07:18.927
Thanks very much for coming, I hope
that left you with a clearer idea that

112
00:07:18.927 --> 00:07:22.191
you're wasting your time
working on your big idea.

113
00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:23.707
No, of course not.

114
00:07:23.707 --> 00:07:26.279
It is absolutely worth it.

115
00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:31.010
There are a lot of reasons why you
might be having this going around in

116
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.081
your head this app or
this digital service or

117
00:07:34.081 --> 00:07:37.077
whatever that you you
think you want to go.

118
00:07:37.077 --> 00:07:41.543
Create, and
there are benefits that can come from it.

119
00:07:41.543 --> 00:07:46.366
Many people want to create a digital
service or a SAS app because they want to

120
00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:51.281
escape the nine to five, you know,
they want to leave their corporate job.

121
00:07:51.281 --> 00:07:56.683
And this is one way you could do that and
that's a perfectly valid reason for

122
00:07:56.683 --> 00:07:59.871
wanting to build your own digital service.

123
00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:04.272
Second is you might just be sick of your
boss or sick of working with clients.

124
00:08:04.272 --> 00:08:09.279
I know a lot of agencies or freelancers
are just sick of dealing with other

125
00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:14.139
people's problems and ideas, and
they wanna shape their own thing.

126
00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:18.831
And you can absolutely do that
Creating your own digital service,

127
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:23.940
although don't get into your head that
you're not going to have a boss or

128
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.788
that you're not going to have clients,

129
00:08:26.788 --> 00:08:31.676
because every one of your customers
becomes the equivalent of that.

130
00:08:31.676 --> 00:08:36.517
And so you swap basically one boss or
a small number of clients with particular,

131
00:08:36.517 --> 00:08:40.856
potentially hundreds of customers
that have all got their opinions and

132
00:08:40.856 --> 00:08:43.618
all got different things
they want to build.

133
00:08:43.618 --> 00:08:49.062
Now that said, it's still very different
experience to having a boss or

134
00:08:49.062 --> 00:08:54.703
having a client's and it is a valid
reason for escaping that kind of cycle.

135
00:08:54.703 --> 00:08:59.657
Another reason that a lot of people
want to create a SaaS app is to

136
00:08:59.657 --> 00:09:02.657
escape that hourly ceiling, right?

137
00:09:02.657 --> 00:09:06.939
They feel that their income is capped
by the number of hours they can work.

138
00:09:06.939 --> 00:09:10.557
And a SaaS business
changes that dynamic and

139
00:09:10.557 --> 00:09:14.773
allows you to earn more for
the time that you put in.

140
00:09:14.773 --> 00:09:18.908
And that, again, is absolutely true,
it can do that and

141
00:09:18.908 --> 00:09:24.165
that is hugely liberating you know I'm
most of the work that I do is capped

142
00:09:24.165 --> 00:09:29.190
by how much I can charge an hour
because I'm primarily a consultant.

143
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.497
That's my primary income stream and

144
00:09:32.497 --> 00:09:38.468
talking of that a SaaS app can be
In an alternative revenue stream,

145
00:09:38.468 --> 00:09:44.333
it's an opportunity to maybe
supplement your existing income,

146
00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:49.342
whether that be your nine to five job or
whether it be your

147
00:09:49.342 --> 00:09:53.955
as a contractor or
a freelancer or an agency owner.

148
00:09:53.955 --> 00:09:56.297
It can be really useful and

149
00:09:56.297 --> 00:10:01.521
helpful to have additional
regular income that comes in.

150
00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:05.342
So it is absolutely worth doing and

151
00:10:05.342 --> 00:10:09.172
success is absolutely possible.

152
00:10:09.172 --> 00:10:15.447
And I've seen people with no
venture capital behind them and

153
00:10:15.447 --> 00:10:21.734
lots of experience behind them,
make a very good go of this.

154
00:10:21.734 --> 00:10:26.777
And so, there is no reason why you
can't follow this and pursue it,

155
00:10:26.777 --> 00:10:32.371
but you have to go into it with your
eyes open and aware of what's involved.

156
00:10:32.371 --> 00:10:37.683
So success is possible, but
only with careful planning and

157
00:10:37.683 --> 00:10:41.932
avoiding being impulsive in it and
just going,

158
00:10:41.932 --> 00:10:46.196
I'm gonna start building something, right?

159
00:10:46.196 --> 00:10:52.125
Now that said,
there are exceptions, right?

160
00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:58.954
Because there can be many reasons for
wanting to build a your own app,

161
00:10:58.954 --> 00:11:03.675
for example, or
your own SaaS service, okay?

162
00:11:03.675 --> 00:11:07.954
And some of those reasons, you don't
need to be all grown up about it, right?

163
00:11:07.954 --> 00:11:11.128
Some of those reasons, you don't
need to treat it like a business.

164
00:11:11.128 --> 00:11:14.289
You might be doing it just for fun, right?

165
00:11:14.289 --> 00:11:18.721
Secondly, it might be you
just wanna learn something.

166
00:11:18.721 --> 00:11:21.970
When you do some of these
courses on Friend and Masters,

167
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.608
there's amazing things that you can learn.

168
00:11:24.608 --> 00:11:29.088
And you wanna apply that to something
tangible and practical and so

169
00:11:29.088 --> 00:11:32.857
you decide to build your own thing,
and that's great.

170
00:11:32.857 --> 00:11:37.725
And you don't need some strategy or
marketing plan for that either.

171
00:11:37.725 --> 00:11:43.574
You might be doing it just to help out to
help some local community organization or

172
00:11:43.574 --> 00:11:45.646
a person or something else.

173
00:11:45.646 --> 00:11:50.479
But beyond that, if you want to turn
it into a business, if you want it to

174
00:11:50.479 --> 00:11:55.650
become a real thing, then we need to
treat it like a business from the start.

175
00:11:55.650 --> 00:12:00.449
And that is what we're exploring
in this session today.

176
00:12:00.449 --> 00:12:04.212
So let's run through the agenda
of what we're going to look at.

177
00:12:04.212 --> 00:12:07.675
We are gonna look at four things today.

178
00:12:07.675 --> 00:12:11.433
First of all,
we're gonna look at reviewing the market.

179
00:12:11.433 --> 00:12:18.060
So all of this is gonna happen before
we start coding anything, okay?

180
00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:23.676
Because I know that a lot of the people
watching this are gonna be developers and

181
00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:26.581
your skill lies in development, okay?

182
00:12:26.581 --> 00:12:31.753
The building the app is the easy bit
to you, it would be very hard to me,

183
00:12:31.753 --> 00:12:35.013
[LAUGH] and it would crash and
burn horribly.

184
00:12:35.013 --> 00:12:38.658
But in your case that is
gonna be the easiest bet.

185
00:12:38.658 --> 00:12:44.152
But nevertheless, it's time consuming,
you could pump in hundreds

186
00:12:44.152 --> 00:12:49.099
of hours into building something and
then it to fail horribly.

187
00:12:49.099 --> 00:12:54.406
All that we're gonna be talking about
in this is kind of validating the idea

188
00:12:54.406 --> 00:12:59.967
before we start investing a lot of our
time and energy into it unless of course,

189
00:12:59.967 --> 00:13:04.454
you're just doing it for
fun in which case knock yourself out.

190
00:13:04.454 --> 00:13:06.999
Number one, we're gonna review the market.

191
00:13:06.999 --> 00:13:12.371
We're gonna see what else is going on,
see what other people are doing and

192
00:13:12.371 --> 00:13:17.310
be really honest with ourselves
about whether there is a legitimate

193
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.622
gap in that market for
us and what we wanna do.

194
00:13:20.622 --> 00:13:25.644
Number two, we're gonna understand
our audience who we think

195
00:13:25.644 --> 00:13:31.721
this app is gonna appeal to, and
what they're really needing and wanting.

196
00:13:31.721 --> 00:13:36.647
I know that a lot of people
build their first app to

197
00:13:36.647 --> 00:13:41.462
meet their own needs or
needs they have, okay.

198
00:13:41.462 --> 00:13:42.806
And we're encouraged to do that.

199
00:13:42.806 --> 00:13:48.883
So build for what you know, build for
your own problems, and that's great.

200
00:13:48.883 --> 00:13:56.034
But is there enough people just like
you with exactly your problems?

201
00:13:56.034 --> 00:13:59.431
And do you actually know that or
are you just guessing about it?

202
00:13:59.431 --> 00:14:02.192
So we need to understand
our audience a little bit.

203
00:14:02.192 --> 00:14:08.202
We also need to define what we're gonna
build first, what's our starting point?

204
00:14:08.202 --> 00:14:12.201
And how are we going to kind
of imagine that before we

205
00:14:12.201 --> 00:14:17.132
just throw ourselves headlong
into code and then finally, and

206
00:14:17.132 --> 00:14:22.622
probably most importantly of
everything we're gonna look at today,

207
00:14:22.622 --> 00:14:26.809
we're gonna run a test
marketing campaign to find out

208
00:14:26.809 --> 00:14:30.274
whether people really will buy this thing.

209
00:14:30.274 --> 00:14:33.874
Because if you go to your friends and
family at least,

210
00:14:33.874 --> 00:14:37.485
unless you have really
horrible friends and family.

211
00:14:37.485 --> 00:14:41.599
And you say to them,
I've had this idea for an app.

212
00:14:41.599 --> 00:14:45.659
I want an app that does x,
what do you think?

213
00:14:45.659 --> 00:14:49.274
And they're gonna go, yeah,
that's brilliant, you go for it.

214
00:14:49.274 --> 00:14:51.871
And then you go, would you pay for that?

215
00:14:51.871 --> 00:14:54.079
Yeah, of course, I would.

216
00:14:54.079 --> 00:14:57.255
They're lying to you, right?

217
00:14:57.255 --> 00:15:00.778
They're lying to you because
they love you and they like you.

218
00:15:00.778 --> 00:15:04.624
And even if you run a bit of a survey,
right, if I said to you,

219
00:15:04.624 --> 00:15:07.198
do you want a nice new fancy shiny thing?

220
00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:11.151
You go, yeah,
I do want a nice new shiny fancy thing.

221
00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:13.635
But when I say, will you pay for that?

222
00:15:13.635 --> 00:15:15.195
Yeah, I'll probably pay for that.

223
00:15:15.195 --> 00:15:20.565
And then I say, can you give give me the
money now, No, I won't do that now, right?

224
00:15:20.565 --> 00:15:23.521
So there is a big difference
between what people say and

225
00:15:23.521 --> 00:15:27.647
what they'll actually do and we need
to get to the heart of that, all right?
