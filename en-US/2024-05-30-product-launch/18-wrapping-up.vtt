00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.949
So doing the testing gets
me kind of nervous because

2
00:00:04.949 --> 00:00:08.525
then what if someone steals my idea?

3
00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:11.890
&gt;&gt; I come across this all the time,
people go in, but

4
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.312
people say about sharing their idea,
sharing their knowledge.

5
00:00:16.312 --> 00:00:20.898
People say it to me, Paul, you give away
all the little secrets of how you do what

6
00:00:20.898 --> 00:00:24.422
you do on your website and
in your podcast and in your teaching,

7
00:00:24.422 --> 00:00:27.835
aren't you worried that people
are gonna steal your ideas?

8
00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:30.058
No, I'm not that important.

9
00:00:30.058 --> 00:00:35.614
And even if they do, they're always
only just gonna be copying me.

10
00:00:35.614 --> 00:00:38.068
They're always gonna be one step behind.

11
00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:43.181
And I think you need to have confidence in
yourself that you know what you're doing,

12
00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:46.566
you've got good ideas,
you're progressing things,

13
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.662
you're always gonna be one
step ahead of them, for

14
00:00:49.662 --> 00:00:54.007
all they know that test campaign
you're running might fail horribly.

15
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:58.018
And they're gonna copy you and
build an idea that's gonna fail.

16
00:00:58.018 --> 00:01:02.250
If they don't understand the processes
going on behind the screen, it seems,

17
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.842
they're not gonna succeed.

18
00:01:03.842 --> 00:01:06.815
That's the easy bit,

19
00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:12.300
the whole idea is
the ideas are to a penny.

20
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.693
I mean, you got, you showed me
a list earlier of dozens of ideas.

21
00:01:16.693 --> 00:01:20.112
We've all got ideas, so
I wouldn't worry about that,

22
00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:22.750
don't let that hold you back personally.

23
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.334
&gt;&gt; I appreciate that, thanks Paul.

24
00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:25.589
&gt;&gt; You had a question?

25
00:01:25.589 --> 00:01:29.110
&gt;&gt; How do you do multiple landing pages?

26
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.528
&gt;&gt; So with the multiple landing pages,

27
00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:35.040
you can be as clever as you
wanna be over this, right?

28
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.437
So, if you're a developer you will
probably build one landing page and

29
00:01:39.437 --> 00:01:44.861
then you'll have variables that swap out
different pieces of information for 10% of

30
00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:50.309
the audience will see this, 20% will see
that and they'll do all kinda clever crap.

31
00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:52.235
Yeah, right.

32
00:01:52.235 --> 00:01:56.850
We're simple, [LAUGH] what we
would do is literally just build

33
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.611
separate pages with separate URLs.

34
00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:03.832
And then when we do different
marketing activities, sometimes we'll

35
00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:08.487
give out one URL and sometimes we'll
give out another, simple as that right?

36
00:02:08.487 --> 00:02:12.881
There are also, it's worth saying
that there are, if you don't wanna

37
00:02:12.881 --> 00:02:17.278
actually build this page from scratch
cuz you don't know HTML and CSS or

38
00:02:17.278 --> 00:02:20.155
whatever, there are landing page builders.

39
00:02:20.155 --> 00:02:23.274
Unbounce is one, isn't it,
and there are others as well.

40
00:02:23.274 --> 00:02:26.645
But if you type in landing page builders,
there's loads of them.

41
00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:31.419
And they'll even do things like you can,
say, the more techie side of it

42
00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:36.137
like collecting email addresses or
the pre orders and stuff like that.

43
00:02:36.137 --> 00:02:39.365
A lot of them have got that
functionality built in as well.

44
00:02:39.365 --> 00:02:44.235
&gt;&gt; Hello, Paul,
I'm thinking about starting a design and

45
00:02:44.235 --> 00:02:48.297
CRO agency,
does all this still apply as well?

46
00:02:48.297 --> 00:02:51.238
&gt;&gt; Kind of yes, but better than that,

47
00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:55.762
he says plainly advertising
one of his other courses.

48
00:02:55.762 --> 00:02:58.196
I have a course on Frontend masters,

49
00:02:58.196 --> 00:03:01.728
be funnier if I was promoting
a course elsewhere, but

50
00:03:01.728 --> 00:03:07.556
unfortunately it is on Frontend Masters,
that is called Finding Clients, isn't it?

51
00:03:07.556 --> 00:03:08.849
I think that's what it's called.

52
00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.044
Having a great idea is brilliant.

53
00:03:13.044 --> 00:03:16.189
Having an application you
wanna build is brilliant.

54
00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.771
I love the fact that developers and
designers love to create stuff and

55
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:25.361
they love to play with different ideas and
explore different ideas.

56
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:30.393
And I hope that long may continue,
but that is different from thinking

57
00:03:30.393 --> 00:03:35.511
you're gonna build something that is
an app that is gonna earn you money

58
00:03:35.511 --> 00:03:40.542
over the long term, and I don't want
you to put a lot time and effort and

59
00:03:40.542 --> 00:03:45.004
get demoralized building
something that ultimately fails.

60
00:03:45.004 --> 00:03:49.952
So to give it the best chance of success,
do that work upfront.

61
00:03:49.952 --> 00:03:53.547
And if that idea doesn't work,
the next one might,

62
00:03:53.547 --> 00:03:57.961
just like Mark was talking about
with his experiences, he ran,

63
00:03:57.961 --> 00:04:02.704
he tried several different ideas
before frontend masters work, and

64
00:04:02.704 --> 00:04:05.587
that may well be what it's like with you.

65
00:04:05.587 --> 00:04:10.283
And just wanna save you as much time and
money on that journey as possible.

66
00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:14.377
So if you've got any questions about it,
and this is absolute genuine whether

67
00:04:14.377 --> 00:04:17.664
you're in the room today,
whether you're watching live, or

68
00:04:17.664 --> 00:04:20.473
especially if you're
watching the recording this.

69
00:04:20.473 --> 00:04:24.999
I'm happy to answer any questions,
any time, help in any way I can,

70
00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:28.136
just drop me an email
to paul@biogwill.com.

71
00:04:28.136 --> 00:04:30.295
But to recap what we've covered,

72
00:04:30.295 --> 00:04:34.023
we've looked at do your market
research before you start.

73
00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:39.156
Do your user research so
you can find the right audience for you,

74
00:04:39.156 --> 00:04:44.975
plan your MVP and prototype your MVP,
then test it with a test campaign.

75
00:04:44.975 --> 00:04:48.531
If you do those things,
you'll be in a really good state and

76
00:04:48.531 --> 00:04:51.246
be in a really good place for
moving forward.

77
00:04:51.246 --> 00:04:52.277
Thanks very much.

78
00:04:52.277 --> 00:04:57.938
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
