1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.777
With that in mind as we dive
into the first section,

2
00:00:03.777 --> 00:00:08.593
which is about reviewing the market
really, because you can have this

3
00:00:08.593 --> 00:00:12.691
brilliant idea and
you can have this really great concept.

4
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:17.570
But actually it can be quite hard
if it's already a very crowded

5
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.186
market in order to distinguish yourself.

6
00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:25.298
And I could give you
a real example of this,

7
00:00:25.298 --> 00:00:32.406
that I was working recently with a guy
that had built a VPN for people.

8
00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:36.611
And it was a really good VPN and it was
very, very fast and technically really,

9
00:00:36.611 --> 00:00:37.836
really good.

10
00:00:37.836 --> 00:00:42.528
But the VPN market is so
crowded and with other players that

11
00:00:42.528 --> 00:00:47.510
are just pouring millions into
marketing in order to increase

12
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.091
brand awareness,
he just wasn't able to compete with that.

13
00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:56.503
And of course with VPN,
a lot of it comes down to trust.

14
00:00:56.503 --> 00:01:00.929
Do you think that this is going to be a
VPN that is going to keep your data safe,

15
00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.899
is well known,
isn't some corn or something.

16
00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.559
So that brand awareness
was really important.

17
00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:08.511
And no matter how great his app was,

18
00:01:08.511 --> 00:01:11.719
he couldn't compete with what
was going on in the market.

19
00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:12.889
Yeah, go for it, Mark.

20
00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:14.171
&gt;&gt; Jesse online says, this so

21
00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:16.969
far sounds exactly what I've
been trying to figure out.

22
00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:21.540
I've had many ideas I know would be great,
but no clue how to review the market,

23
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.775
understand my audience and
how to really market in the slightest.

24
00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:26.975
&gt;&gt; Yes, perfect.

25
00:01:26.975 --> 00:01:28.640
Great, thank you for that.

26
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.745
That's encouraging.

27
00:01:29.745 --> 00:01:33.760
Because I was beginning, when you create
these workshops, you think, they're

28
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.295
actually people that are trying to do
this and you get stuck in your own head.

29
00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:38.475
So that's really nice to hear.

30
00:01:38.475 --> 00:01:38.985
Thank you.

31
00:01:38.985 --> 00:01:42.157
Okay, I'll keep going then,
that's encouraging.

32
00:01:42.157 --> 00:01:44.023
So why do we wanna do the market research?

33
00:01:44.023 --> 00:01:47.083
I mean, I think most of us know that
market research is a good thing.

34
00:01:47.083 --> 00:01:49.929
It's a thing you're supposed to do, but

35
00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.983
maybe you're a little bit kind of woolly
about kind of the real aims here.

36
00:01:54.983 --> 00:01:58.343
Cuz you've got to know your
aims before you go in.

37
00:01:58.343 --> 00:02:02.743
I'm not a fan of doing things
just because you're supposed to.

38
00:02:02.743 --> 00:02:05.950
If you've watched my course
on user research and testing,

39
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.839
I go on about, well, don't just do testing
because that's what you're supposed to do.

40
00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.977
Do testing because you're trying to
get to a particular objective or

41
00:02:13.977 --> 00:02:15.810
learn something in particular.

42
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.950
And the same applies here.

43
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.710
We need to know why we're doing research.

44
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.898
So the first thing is.

45
00:02:20.898 --> 00:02:22.767
We need to define our audience, right?

46
00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:27.706
Market research provides a deeper
insight into the exact niche

47
00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:31.999
that we wanna target because
we're terrible at that.

48
00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:38.089
Example that I've used before in other
courses is I wanna create a task gap,

49
00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.762
right?

50
00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:41.742
Because I don't like
the existing task apps.

51
00:02:42.792 --> 00:02:46.467
Now that's gray and
you might have a unique idea and

52
00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:50.485
angle on doing a task app, but
a task app could be aimed at

53
00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:55.551
a professional project manager
that's gonna want one set of things.

54
00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:59.446
A stay-at-home mom that's gonna
want another set of things or

55
00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:03.071
a busy CEO that's gonna
want another set of things.

56
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:05.933
So you have to really be clear
on who your audience is and

57
00:03:05.933 --> 00:03:09.501
we're gonna do a whole
section on that in a minute.

58
00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:14.274
But secondly, doing your market research
enables us to define the offering,

59
00:03:14.274 --> 00:03:19.461
get a clearer picture about exactly
what we're gonna build initially.

60
00:03:19.461 --> 00:03:24.435
Because again, what happens is we have
all these ideas going around in our head,

61
00:03:24.435 --> 00:03:28.237
or I could do this, or I could do that,
or I could do the other,

62
00:03:28.237 --> 00:03:30.360
and that's overwhelming.

63
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.065
And so we end up just picking the things
that we're most excited about,

64
00:03:34.065 --> 00:03:38.340
which may or may not be the things
that other people are excited about.

65
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.850
So we need to have a better idea of
what actually is worth creating and

66
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.663
market research helps us do that.

67
00:03:46.663 --> 00:03:50.646
It also is a bit of a kind
of wake-up call, really,

68
00:03:50.646 --> 00:03:54.352
to knowing what else is
going on in the market and

69
00:03:54.352 --> 00:04:00.024
identifying some challenges that
we'll face, because you will face.

70
00:04:00.024 --> 00:04:02.328
I remember building an app once and

71
00:04:02.328 --> 00:04:06.708
I honestly believed that there
was nobody else doing it, right?

72
00:04:06.708 --> 00:04:09.678
And that this was a completely new thing.

73
00:04:09.678 --> 00:04:13.579
And it was only,
as I started to talk about it publicly and

74
00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.128
put it out there, people started to go,
you mean like this?

75
00:04:18.128 --> 00:04:22.797
And it's like, yeah, do and then somebody
else goes, you'd be like this other app.

76
00:04:22.797 --> 00:04:24.923
And before I knew it, there was three or

77
00:04:24.923 --> 00:04:27.313
four other apps that
did exactly what I did.

78
00:04:27.313 --> 00:04:29.014
And it was like, no.

79
00:04:29.014 --> 00:04:33.527
And it's not like I hadn't Googled,
but it wasn't enough.

80
00:04:34.877 --> 00:04:39.005
And also it helps us to
establish our strategy.

81
00:04:39.005 --> 00:04:43.231
It'll help you to know how
you wanna get to market and

82
00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:48.418
how you're gonna reach people and
all of those kinds of things,

83
00:04:48.418 --> 00:04:53.509
because the scary truth is that
out of those 90% of companies

84
00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:59.784
of startups that fail, 42% of them
fail because there's no market need.

85
00:05:01.165 --> 00:05:03.987
Now, no market need is
a bit of a vague term.

86
00:05:03.987 --> 00:05:05.125
I mean, what does that mean?

87
00:05:05.125 --> 00:05:09.115
But basically it means not enough
people bought the thing, right?

88
00:05:09.115 --> 00:05:12.585
Or there wasn't enough
demand out there for it.

89
00:05:14.215 --> 00:05:18.060
So the big question is,
well, how do we do this?

90
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.831
How do we approach our market research?

91
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:25.124
Market research,

92
00:05:25.124 --> 00:05:30.106
yes, there are specialists who
specialize in market research.

93
00:05:30.106 --> 00:05:33.414
And I'm presuming within this course,

94
00:05:33.414 --> 00:05:37.791
that if you're sitting
watching a course like this,

95
00:05:37.791 --> 00:05:44.519
you're not trying to launch a product for,
I don't know, Amazon here, right?

96
00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:49.979
This is you with your big idea and you're
not backed with massive venture capital or

97
00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.484
a huge company or anything like that.

98
00:05:52.484 --> 00:05:56.294
So you're not about to hire a market
Rieseberg Search specialists.

99
00:05:56.294 --> 00:05:59.592
We wanna talk about stuff
that you can do it yourself,

100
00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:02.538
not have a whole organization do.

101
00:06:02.538 --> 00:06:05.328
So the advice I'm gonna give
is within that premise.

102
00:06:05.328 --> 00:06:10.064
So the very first thing I would encourage
you to do is very broadly define your

103
00:06:10.064 --> 00:06:11.548
niche.

104
00:06:11.548 --> 00:06:17.058
What that niche is, is gonna be kind
of defined by a couple of things.

105
00:06:17.058 --> 00:06:21.729
Firstly, the type of offering
that you've got, right?

106
00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:27.749
So obviously if you're creating a,
I don't know, a recipe app,

107
00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:34.107
then it's not gonna appeal to people
that never cook for themselves.

108
00:06:34.107 --> 00:06:40.170
So there will be some automatic
kind of definition going on there.

109
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:45.415
But also you might wanna think about
a particular audience that you

110
00:06:45.415 --> 00:06:51.330
want to initially focus on when you
initially launch your product, okay?

111
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.445
Now, I emphasize the word
initially several times there and

112
00:06:56.445 --> 00:06:58.550
there is good reason for that.

113
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.390
A lot of products or SAS apps or
whatever we wanna call

114
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:07.468
them could have quite broad appeal, okay?

115
00:07:07.468 --> 00:07:09.861
A task app is a great example of that,

116
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:14.906
there's pretty much all of us need
a task app to some degree, okay?

117
00:07:14.906 --> 00:07:17.962
But don't get into that
thinking to begin with and

118
00:07:17.962 --> 00:07:22.836
it's easy to do because you start
getting excited and you go, these people

119
00:07:22.836 --> 00:07:27.813
would find it really useful as well and
these people would find it really useful.

120
00:07:29.013 --> 00:07:30.763
And that is a problem.

121
00:07:30.763 --> 00:07:35.280
You want to avoid going too
broad with your audience.

122
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.031
The smaller your initial audience,
it feels counterintuitive.

123
00:07:39.031 --> 00:07:44.096
But the smaller your initial
audience within reason,

124
00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:50.679
the increasing likelihood of success and
I'll tell you why.

125
00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:55.779
You have a little pebble of marketing
effort that you can put in, right?

126
00:07:55.779 --> 00:07:58.898
You don't have a multimillion
pound marketing budget.

127
00:07:58.898 --> 00:08:02.379
This is tiny little pebble, imagine that.

128
00:08:02.379 --> 00:08:07.224
And if you throw it into
the ocean of everybody who might

129
00:08:07.224 --> 00:08:10.805
potentially be interested in your app,

130
00:08:10.805 --> 00:08:16.315
it'll disappear and
it won't leave a ripple, right?

131
00:08:16.315 --> 00:08:21.398
But if you take that same little pebble
and throw it into a tiny little puddle

132
00:08:21.398 --> 00:08:26.659
of a small group of people, it will create
a lot of ripples and a lot of effect.

133
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:32.825
So to bring that analogy down to
actually something practical is for

134
00:08:32.825 --> 00:08:37.222
somebody to express an interest
in your product or service,

135
00:08:37.222 --> 00:08:40.987
they can't just hear about it once, right?

136
00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:47.869
If you're subscribed to front end masters
which obviously you are if you're watching

137
00:08:47.869 --> 00:08:55.337
this, think about how many times you heard
about front end masters before you paid.

138
00:08:55.337 --> 00:08:58.537
The chances are it was more than once.

139
00:08:58.537 --> 00:09:02.996
You didn't just see it but maybe if you're
flush with cash or your boss pays for

140
00:09:02.996 --> 00:09:04.100
it, right?

141
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.875
But if you are paying for it yourself,
the chances are you saw it and

142
00:09:07.875 --> 00:09:10.902
thought, that looks quite interesting.

143
00:09:10.902 --> 00:09:14.931
Okay, I'll come, and you go away and
you think about it and

144
00:09:14.931 --> 00:09:20.109
then maybe you saw, I don't know,
some other person you respect was on it.

145
00:09:20.109 --> 00:09:24.891
Or maybe you saw an ad somewhere else,
or maybe you saw a blog post that they'd

146
00:09:24.891 --> 00:09:29.379
written, or a social media clip or
whatever else, and you heard about it

147
00:09:29.379 --> 00:09:35.249
a few times and then you thought that kept
reminding you and then you bought, right?

148
00:09:35.249 --> 00:09:37.482
Or maybe, you heard about it and

149
00:09:37.482 --> 00:09:42.549
did buy it the first time because
somebody recommended it to you, okay?

150
00:09:43.859 --> 00:09:47.199
And all of that happens
within a small community.

151
00:09:47.199 --> 00:09:52.129
So in other words, if Frontend Masters
tried to appeal to everybody and

152
00:09:52.129 --> 00:09:57.059
had every kind of course in the world,
it would need a massive marketing

153
00:09:57.059 --> 00:10:01.354
budget to reach all these
different audiences all the place.

154
00:10:01.354 --> 00:10:04.647
But because they just
focus down on developers,

155
00:10:04.647 --> 00:10:09.788
it means that they can make sure you've
heard of them multiple times because

156
00:10:09.788 --> 00:10:15.507
it's a relatively contained group of
people, which only go to so many places.

157
00:10:15.507 --> 00:10:19.617
But secondly, there's a good chance that
word of mouth will kick in cuz developers

158
00:10:19.617 --> 00:10:22.082
like to talk to one another or
recommend stuff, so

159
00:10:22.082 --> 00:10:24.387
it amplifies your
marketing message as well.

160
00:10:25.607 --> 00:10:28.157
So, does that make sense
of why you wanna go in?

161
00:10:28.157 --> 00:10:29.187
Yeah, go for it, Mark.

162
00:10:29.187 --> 00:10:33.695
&gt;&gt; Yeah, just comment that,
people think that the Internet is broad so

163
00:10:33.695 --> 00:10:36.180
I should go, I can reach anybody, but

164
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:40.638
really it's the ultimate like niche
machine if you think about it.

165
00:10:40.638 --> 00:10:45.683
It's like the more targeted,
if you're like, I'm going after

166
00:10:45.683 --> 00:10:50.830
this very specific person because
they have a very specific need.

167
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:56.166
And I know that the better audience,
you better the audience,

168
00:10:56.166 --> 00:11:01.311
the more you're able to speak
to their very specific needs.

169
00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:04.009
&gt;&gt; And
you might think the audience is too small.

170
00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:09.356
You might get into this mindset of like,
well, if I just go for,

171
00:11:09.356 --> 00:11:15.612
I don't know, Ruby on Rails developers,
that makes me really outdated.

172
00:11:15.612 --> 00:11:17.702
Is Ruby on Rails still trendy?

173
00:11:17.702 --> 00:11:18.619
No, it's all right.

174
00:11:18.619 --> 00:11:20.468
We'll go with Ruby on Rails there.

175
00:11:20.468 --> 00:11:24.608
If I just go, are there enough of those,
but yeah, of course they're, right?

176
00:11:24.608 --> 00:11:26.456
You can support business based on that.

177
00:11:26.456 --> 00:11:27.668
I should have gotten even more niche.

178
00:11:27.668 --> 00:11:29.028
Shouldn't I, really?

179
00:11:29.028 --> 00:11:30.526
Yeah, go for it.

180
00:11:30.526 --> 00:11:34.344
&gt;&gt; [COUGH] We're hearing that Sam Altman
would tell people at Y Combinator to now

181
00:11:34.344 --> 00:11:37.982
go for a large broad audience but
instead find a select group of people who

182
00:11:37.982 --> 00:11:40.945
are passionate about the product
that you are selling.

183
00:11:40.945 --> 00:11:42.211
&gt;&gt; Exactly yeah.

184
00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:43.685
&gt;&gt; They would help you do your marketing.

185
00:11:43.685 --> 00:11:45.794
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and they really will.

186
00:11:45.794 --> 00:11:48.608
If you can get a small group of
people that are really into it and

187
00:11:48.608 --> 00:11:52.346
you're listening to them and you're
interacting with them and stuff like that,

188
00:11:52.346 --> 00:11:55.235
they become your advocates and
they do a lot the hard work for you
