WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.714
But what you're then gonna need to do is
you're gonna need to build one banging

2
00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:08.030
landing page that really kind
of sells the product well.

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.875
And this is where we come to really
a course that I ran on conversion

4
00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:17.927
optimization that you can
find on Frontend Masters and

5
00:00:17.927 --> 00:00:22.175
I'd encourage you to check that out and
go through that.

6
00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:27.872
But I'll give you the highlights here just
to get you going with a basic landing

7
00:00:27.872 --> 00:00:34.782
page that you can use to sell your product
that doesn't actually exist yet, right?

8
00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:38.162
First of all,
you need your value proposition, okay?

9
00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:42.426
You need a value proposition, that
basically is a strapline that summarizes

10
00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:44.667
your application in a single sentence.

11
00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:48.724
Some benefits, how does it help
people achieve their goals or

12
00:00:48.724 --> 00:00:51.464
overcome their pain points, all right?

13
00:00:51.464 --> 00:00:54.052
And it's features, right?

14
00:00:54.052 --> 00:00:58.993
What are the features that you offer that
enable you to deliver the benefits that

15
00:00:58.993 --> 00:01:00.626
you have listed, right?

16
00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:03.031
So that's your value proposition.

17
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:05.971
So you'll need to bring some,
a list of features, a list of benefits and

18
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:06.561
a strapline.

19
00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:14.951
In terms of your calls to action, we've
talked about calls to action already.

20
00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:17.662
What your calls to action are,

21
00:01:17.662 --> 00:01:22.773
you can have a primary call to
action like preorder today,

22
00:01:22.773 --> 00:01:28.610
but it is okay if you want to also
have a secondary call to action of,

23
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.126
sign up to here when we first launch.

24
00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:35.096
So you might wanna do that
with the pre-order, right?

25
00:01:35.096 --> 00:01:39.923
So you can either pre-order or join our
mailing list, something like that, right?

26
00:01:39.923 --> 00:01:45.068
But no more than two calls to action,
don't get sucked into, follow us on social

27
00:01:45.068 --> 00:01:50.233
media and read our blog and 20 other
calls to action, right, keep it focused.

28
00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:57.196
Then I'd encourage you to brainstorm
some objections of why someone might not

29
00:01:57.196 --> 00:01:59.053
want to act, right?

30
00:01:59.053 --> 00:02:04.257
So, ask yourself,
what concerns might people have?

31
00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:06.517
What if they sell my email
list to a third party?

32
00:02:06.517 --> 00:02:08.881
What if their application's rubbish?

33
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:11.837
What if they make it hard to unsubscribe?

34
00:02:11.837 --> 00:02:13.478
What if they send me too many emails?

35
00:02:13.478 --> 00:02:14.730
What if they pressured me into buying?

36
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.908
What if I get hacked,
all of that kind of thing.

37
00:02:17.908 --> 00:02:21.926
Now, what you might wanna do
when it comes to objections.

38
00:02:21.926 --> 00:02:25.787
So initially, before you create
the landing page, brainstorm a load.

39
00:02:25.787 --> 00:02:30.211
But while your landing page is running,
okay, so you've got it up and running,

40
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:32.516
you are running your campaign.

41
00:02:32.516 --> 00:02:37.317
Also consider an exit intent survey,
so basically a survey that only

42
00:02:37.317 --> 00:02:41.469
appears as someone goes to
leave the landing page, right?

43
00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:45.592
And there are loads of services out
there that will create these for you.

44
00:02:45.592 --> 00:02:48.883
I think I use one called Getsitecontrol,

45
00:02:48.883 --> 00:02:52.836
which is a silly name for
a pop up app, but anyway.

46
00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:56.686
I see your ad, this only appears
if someone goes to exit, and

47
00:02:56.686 --> 00:03:01.910
you basically say, if you decided not to
act today, it will be useful to know why.

48
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.404
And then you give them some multi-choice
answers as reasons, it's too expensive,

49
00:03:05.404 --> 00:03:09.200
I didn't understand the value,
I didn't trust the company, whatever else.

50
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.421
And then another option, and that could be
a really useful way of learning whether

51
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:17.479
it's your pricing that's rubbish or
your call to action is not appropriate.

52
00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:21.655
Or you've targeted it wrongly,
you're not explaining the benefits or

53
00:03:21.655 --> 00:03:24.402
whatever else,
that is really useful to know.

54
00:03:24.402 --> 00:03:26.998
So make sure that's on there as well.

55
00:03:30.508 --> 00:03:35.458
Normally, if it was a full product, you'd
probably have some social proof on there.

56
00:03:35.458 --> 00:03:40.051
Obviously most of this social proof that
you can't really do because you don't have

57
00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:44.189
a real product yet, but what you might
wanna do is approach a few individuals

58
00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:46.020
that are excited about the idea.

59
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.777
It's preferably influences in
the sector where you give them a little

60
00:03:50.777 --> 00:03:55.708
demo of your prototype and ask if
they'd give you a little testimonial.

61
00:03:55.708 --> 00:04:00.444
But if you can't get testimonials or
anything like that then don't

62
00:04:00.444 --> 00:04:05.107
worry too much about social proof,
it's not the end of the world.

63
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:13.407
So once you've got your benefits,
you've got your features social proof,

64
00:04:13.407 --> 00:04:19.175
if you can, then what you wanna
do start creating content blocks.

65
00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:24.127
Every page on the web is basically
made up of a series of content blocks.

66
00:04:25.467 --> 00:04:28.204
And so for each benefit, each feature,

67
00:04:28.204 --> 00:04:32.887
each block has social proof you
wanna create a content block.

68
00:04:32.887 --> 00:04:36.205
And the content block normally
consists of a supporting image,

69
00:04:36.205 --> 00:04:38.717
although that's optional.

70
00:04:38.717 --> 00:04:43.385
A heading,
a little short description, right,

71
00:04:43.385 --> 00:04:46.723
and a link for more information.

72
00:04:46.723 --> 00:04:50.273
And again, that one's optional cuz you've
only got landing page at the moment, so

73
00:04:50.273 --> 00:04:52.183
you probably won't do a link, right?

74
00:04:52.183 --> 00:04:58.476
So for example, Frontend Masters
might have a content block for

75
00:04:58.476 --> 00:05:05.736
a benefit, the title read,
improve your career prospects, right?

76
00:05:05.736 --> 00:05:09.584
And the description that says underneath,
something short,

77
00:05:09.584 --> 00:05:14.603
only probably 150 characters, something
like that, kind of a tweet length.

78
00:05:14.603 --> 00:05:20.427
That would say something like,
learn the latest development

79
00:05:20.427 --> 00:05:25.138
techniques so
you can land that next job, right?

80
00:05:25.138 --> 00:05:28.015
And in their case they can afford
to put link in that goes off

81
00:05:28.015 --> 00:05:32.103
to more information cuz they've
got whole website we don't, right?

82
00:05:32.103 --> 00:05:34.910
And you might wanna have
a supporting image with that,

83
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.543
you might not whatever it's appropriate,
okay?

84
00:05:39.053 --> 00:05:44.180
You might also wanna then
scatter into that addressing

85
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.193
any objections that goes alongside that,

86
00:05:48.193 --> 00:05:52.551
particular thing you're talking about.

87
00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:59.051
So, improve your career prospects, despite
the current downturn in the industry,

88
00:05:59.051 --> 00:06:03.636
having the latest skills
will secure your next job.

89
00:06:03.636 --> 00:06:07.882
So I've acknowledged the objection there's
nothing good around in the industry at

90
00:06:07.882 --> 00:06:10.716
the moment,
I'm not gonna get a job, right?

91
00:06:10.716 --> 00:06:13.996
So I've dealt with
an objection in that as well.

92
00:06:13.996 --> 00:06:18.384
This might feel quite intimidating
if you're not a developer, no,

93
00:06:18.384 --> 00:06:23.224
if you are a developer because you're
not a writer, don't worry about it,

94
00:06:23.224 --> 00:06:24.754
and I'll tell you why.

95
00:06:24.754 --> 00:06:27.977
Just write any old rubbish, okay?

96
00:06:27.977 --> 00:06:29.937
That deals with it, right?

97
00:06:29.937 --> 00:06:32.645
So don't worry how bad your title is,

98
00:06:32.645 --> 00:06:37.216
don't worry about how bad your
grammar is or how persuasive is or

99
00:06:37.216 --> 00:06:41.383
anything like that,
cuz I have a magic tool for you right?

100
00:06:41.383 --> 00:06:45.749
There is a great app called Hemingway,
right?

101
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:47.777
It's free to use the basic version,

102
00:06:47.777 --> 00:06:52.097
I would highly recommend that just while
you're creating this landing page,

103
00:06:52.097 --> 00:06:55.975
you pay the however, it's a minuscule
amount to get the AI features.

104
00:06:55.975 --> 00:07:03.093
So by way of example, I have taken some
copy offer for the Frontend Master site.

105
00:07:03.093 --> 00:07:08.815
And that copy is terrible, sorry, right?

106
00:07:08.815 --> 00:07:09.788
So you can see it here,

107
00:07:09.788 --> 00:07:13.515
this is the first piece of copy on
the homepage of the Frontend Master site.

108
00:07:13.515 --> 00:07:17.595
It's reading level is postgraduate, right?

109
00:07:17.595 --> 00:07:21.538
So it is really hard to read all of
the sentences, look how it's made all

110
00:07:21.538 --> 00:07:26.148
the sentences red which basically
say these are bad sentences, right?

111
00:07:26.148 --> 00:07:30.015
But if you put it into
Hemingway what you can do,

112
00:07:30.015 --> 00:07:36.020
is you can go to their magic AI tool and
you can select Improve and clarify.

113
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.790
You can also select right at the bottom of
that list if you look under Tone be more

114
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:41.669
persuasive.

115
00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:46.773
Or you could even select the make
skimmable where allowed headings and

116
00:07:46.773 --> 00:07:49.854
bullets and bold and stuff, right?

117
00:07:49.854 --> 00:07:53.172
So if I run that bit of copy
through we end up like this.

118
00:07:53.172 --> 00:07:58.628
Now formatting-wise that might not
be great but at Frontend Masters

119
00:07:58.628 --> 00:08:04.285
we offer courses taught by experts
from top companies such as Netflix.

120
00:08:04.285 --> 00:08:07.102
We always update our curriculum
with the latest trends.

121
00:08:07.102 --> 00:08:10.739
This ensures our learners learn
industry standard practices and

122
00:08:10.739 --> 00:08:15.832
the latest techniques, and suddenly
the readability score of that is 8, right?

123
00:08:15.832 --> 00:08:18.272
Rather than Post-graduate, which is 16.

124
00:08:18.272 --> 00:08:22.968
So it's made it considerably easier to
read, easier to scan and I could also put

125
00:08:22.968 --> 00:08:28.118
it through the persuasive thing if I
wanted to to give it a bit more punch.

126
00:08:28.118 --> 00:08:31.818
So you don't need to be able to
write to create this landing page.

127
00:08:31.818 --> 00:08:37.518
Obviously, a professional copywriter
would do an even better job, right?

128
00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:42.666
I'm not in any way saying we don't need
copywriters anymore of course we do but

129
00:08:42.666 --> 00:08:45.320
it's good enough for this test, okay?

130
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.210
So that make your life a lot easier.

131
00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.000
And then it's just about
assembling your parts, right?

132
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.814
So you start off at the top of the page
with your summary, which is your

133
00:08:55.814 --> 00:09:00.391
strapline and maybe a sentence or
two says a little bit about you.

134
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:03.521
Then I normally go straight
in with a call to action for

135
00:09:03.521 --> 00:09:06.526
those people that just like to skim and
skip stuff.

136
00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:09.751
Wherever I have a call to action,
if I've got any social proof,

137
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:12.762
I like to put that as close to
the call to action as possible.

138
00:09:12.762 --> 00:09:17.796
Then we have a list of our benefits as
to how this is gonna change their lives.

139
00:09:17.796 --> 00:09:21.371
Then I tend to repeat the call to
action again because you can never

140
00:09:21.371 --> 00:09:23.588
have your call to action too many times.

141
00:09:23.588 --> 00:09:27.302
Then I show them the features and
I end the page with a call to action,

142
00:09:27.302 --> 00:09:28.750
it's as simple as that.

143
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:33.660
That is all you need to be
able to run this test, right?

144
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.680
If you're stuck on your strapline, right?

145
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.394
Take all of your benefits all of your
features that you've written, copy and

146
00:09:41.394 --> 00:09:42.999
paste them into ChatGPT.

147
00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:48.747
And say write me five straplines based
on this description of the product,

148
00:09:48.747 --> 00:09:52.407
and then just pick the one you like best,
yeah.

149
00:09:52.407 --> 00:09:55.838
&gt;&gt; You're using the word straplines, I'm
not really familiar with that, what is it?

150
00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:03.154
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I thought that was
apparently it's a British peculiarity.

151
00:10:03.154 --> 00:10:06.947
Just do it is Nike's useless one.

152
00:10:06.947 --> 00:10:08.121
&gt;&gt; Taglines?

153
00:10:08.121 --> 00:10:12.434
&gt;&gt; Taglines, that's what you call
them over here, then taglines, yeah.

154
00:10:12.434 --> 00:10:16.736
But preferably one that's more
descriptive than that, right?

155
00:10:16.736 --> 00:10:20.355
If you're if you're Nike or
you're McDonald's or whatever,

156
00:10:20.355 --> 00:10:24.006
you can get away with these
aspirational feely kinda ones.

157
00:10:24.006 --> 00:10:29.046
Your one basically needs to
say what it does on the tin.

158
00:10:29.046 --> 00:10:33.228
It needs to say,
a task app for young mums, or

159
00:10:33.228 --> 00:10:39.266
something like that,
something a lot more descriptive.

160
00:10:39.266 --> 00:10:43.054
Because you want people
to look at the page and

161
00:10:43.054 --> 00:10:46.948
know instantly what
the applications about.

162
00:10:49.901 --> 00:10:55.445
To be honest,
when it comes to the aesthetic side

163
00:10:55.445 --> 00:11:00.461
of things, look, do what you can, [LAUGH].

164
00:11:00.461 --> 00:11:05.178
If you're a developer,
I'd encourage you just to go and

165
00:11:05.178 --> 00:11:10.191
find maybe a template or
a design system or something that you

166
00:11:10.191 --> 00:11:15.521
like the look of that you feel is
appropriate for that audience.

167
00:11:15.521 --> 00:11:21.042
If you can afford to get a designer
to look at it, that's awesome too.

168
00:11:22.816 --> 00:11:25.856
I'm not expecting the world
from that side of things.

169
00:11:25.856 --> 00:11:29.596
We're only running at TED,
we'll do the best we can kind of thing.

170
00:11:29.596 --> 00:11:34.855
So yeah, basically but what I would
encourage you to do is at least

171
00:11:34.855 --> 00:11:40.130
before you start looking for
a template or something you can use.

172
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:44.700
Maybe have a little think about the kind
of words that you wanna communicate

173
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:45.652
through that.

174
00:11:45.652 --> 00:11:48.676
That you want it to be trustworthy,
you want it to be friendly,

175
00:11:48.676 --> 00:11:50.570
you want it to be positive, whatever.

176
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.106
So that when you search for
templates, you can use some of

177
00:11:54.106 --> 00:11:58.322
those words to hopefully help
you find a relevant template.

178
00:11:58.322 --> 00:12:02.582
So let's talk about, you can test your
landing page before Before you launch it.

179
00:12:02.582 --> 00:12:07.035
If you want to,
you can do a 5-second test that,

180
00:12:07.035 --> 00:12:13.304
I talk about all these tests in my,
user research and testing course.

181
00:12:13.304 --> 00:12:17.551
Where you can just see whether people
spot the key elements on the page.

182
00:12:17.551 --> 00:12:20.797
These are the same tests we were
talking about for the app itself,

183
00:12:20.797 --> 00:12:22.816
we can now run those on the landing page.

184
00:12:22.816 --> 00:12:27.711
We can run the first-click test,
we can run a short survey.

185
00:12:27.711 --> 00:12:32.065
One thing you might wanna do is,
is eye-tracking simulation to make sure

186
00:12:32.065 --> 00:12:34.887
people are seeing the right
things on the page.

187
00:12:36.817 --> 00:12:40.190
So for example,
are they seeing the call to action,

188
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:43.648
are they reading the strapline,
that kind of stuff.

189
00:12:43.648 --> 00:12:48.942
Now, eye-tracking simulation in case you
don't know basically takes thousands

190
00:12:48.942 --> 00:12:54.006
of hours of eye-tracking, and it predicts
where someone will look on a page and

191
00:12:54.006 --> 00:12:56.668
it costs like $19 for a month, right?

192
00:12:56.668 --> 00:13:00.308
So you can imagine when you when
you're building your landing page,

193
00:13:00.308 --> 00:13:02.954
you pay your $19 you run
it through this thing.

194
00:13:02.954 --> 00:13:10.378
And what it will do is this basically,
so this is a random page on the website,

195
00:13:10.378 --> 00:13:14.392
you upload this mock up to their website.

196
00:13:14.392 --> 00:13:18.419
It analyzes it and
you get something like this back, right?

197
00:13:18.419 --> 00:13:22.075
And as you can see the faces are pulling
attention there but people are still still

198
00:13:22.075 --> 00:13:26.052
reading the main strapline and they're
paying attention to the text underneath.

199
00:13:26.052 --> 00:13:30.192
They're not looking at the call to action
button, and that's a bit worrying, right?

200
00:13:30.192 --> 00:13:33.627
So you'll get that kind of
feedback on your landing page and

201
00:13:33.627 --> 00:13:35.138
help you to know whether or

202
00:13:35.138 --> 00:13:39.782
not it's working reasonably well before
we start spending any money, yeah.

203
00:13:39.782 --> 00:13:42.466
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can actually put your
competitor's webpage through this and

204
00:13:42.466 --> 00:13:44.583
then say, hey,
there's worse than weaknesses [LAUGH].

205
00:13:44.583 --> 00:13:49.321
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,
it's worth doing and I do that.

206
00:13:49.321 --> 00:13:53.824
When I do conversion rate optimization
work, I do that all the time.

207
00:13:53.824 --> 00:13:58.180
In fact, I even run usability
testing on competitors websites,

208
00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.724
because it's like a free prototype.
