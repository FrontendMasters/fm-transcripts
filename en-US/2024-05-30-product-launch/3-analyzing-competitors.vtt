1
00:00:00.556 --> 00:00:05.465
So, what are we looking for
in our competitors, okay?

2
00:00:05.465 --> 00:00:07.327
So I've said you wanna
look at their reach.

3
00:00:07.327 --> 00:00:11.423
I've said you wanna try their offering,
but let's actually dive into it in

4
00:00:11.423 --> 00:00:14.369
a little bit more depth cuz
that's a little bit vague.

5
00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.188
So first of all,
look at their features and functionality.

6
00:00:18.188 --> 00:00:20.485
Wow, that's blown your mind, isn't it?

7
00:00:20.485 --> 00:00:24.123
We would never have thought to do that.

8
00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:26.107
But pay particular attention
to certain things.

9
00:00:26.107 --> 00:00:29.148
First of all, what's their core offering?

10
00:00:29.148 --> 00:00:31.385
What's the focus of their app?

11
00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:35.824
Because a lot of apps will have
a lot of functionality, but

12
00:00:35.824 --> 00:00:40.366
there's normally something
that kind of sits at the core.

13
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:45.255
And what you wanna do is pay particular
attention to the ones that they focus

14
00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:49.457
on promoting the most cuz that
tends to be the heart of their app.

15
00:00:49.457 --> 00:00:53.921
And sometimes you can build a very
similar app to somebody else but

16
00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:56.286
with just a different core focus.

17
00:00:56.286 --> 00:00:59.081
And then you can begin to
differentiate yourself, all right?

18
00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:02.681
So you wanna know what
their core focuses are.

19
00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:07.658
You also wanna know what their unique
features are, what makes their app

20
00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:12.972
different from the other competitors and
potentially from your app as well.

21
00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:16.602
Are those things just nice to have things,
right?

22
00:01:16.602 --> 00:01:21.339
Or are they critical to the experience for
the audience you're trying to reach?

23
00:01:21.339 --> 00:01:25.317
If they're just nice to thing
to have things then really,

24
00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:28.738
they're not in a particularly
strong position.

25
00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:34.323
Because they're relying on the fact that
people want these things enough to be

26
00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:40.262
able to go with them over to a competitor
that doesn't offer those things, right?

27
00:01:40.262 --> 00:01:42.968
So they've got to be pretty essential for

28
00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:46.305
them actually to be a good
competitive advantage.

29
00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:49.528
But the same applies to you, right?

30
00:01:49.528 --> 00:01:53.170
So if you've got a unique
feature in your app, but

31
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.858
if it's just a nice to have feature,

32
00:01:55.858 --> 00:02:01.613
it's probably not gonna be enough to
make people move from competitor to you.

33
00:02:01.613 --> 00:02:05.191
So, it's gotta be something
that's a killer feature.

34
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:08.949
And then finally, in functionality and
features, look at their integrations.

35
00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.336
I mean, this doesn't apply to everything.

36
00:02:11.336 --> 00:02:13.982
It depends on what you're building and
what you're creating.

37
00:02:13.982 --> 00:02:15.265
But oftentimes,

38
00:02:15.265 --> 00:02:20.402
people care quite a lot about how
this works with other things, right?

39
00:02:20.402 --> 00:02:25.106
And that might be if you're creating
something like a no customer relationship

40
00:02:25.106 --> 00:02:29.741
management system, it is absolutely
essential that it works with everything

41
00:02:29.741 --> 00:02:32.499
else that you know where
things are coming in.

42
00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.441
If you're creating a task app,
well, maybe less so.

43
00:02:35.441 --> 00:02:40.435
But even so it'd be quite nice if
that syncs with my reminders app, for

44
00:02:40.435 --> 00:02:44.667
my iPhone or it, it worked with notion or
whatever else, so

45
00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:50.105
those kinds of integrations are a thing
that's worth paying attention to.

46
00:02:50.105 --> 00:02:53.446
So you wanna look at
the competitors features and

47
00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:58.347
functionality, you also wanna look
at their user experience, okay?

48
00:02:58.347 --> 00:03:00.008
How easy is the thing to use?

49
00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:04.356
Again, there are three main
areas that I pay attention to.

50
00:03:04.356 --> 00:03:06.440
The first is onboarding.

51
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.340
The first time you get into an app,
what is that first time experience like?

52
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.632
Is the app easy to pick up or
do I need support in order to get into it?

53
00:03:17.632 --> 00:03:20.217
That is absolutely crucial.

54
00:03:20.217 --> 00:03:25.046
Because a lot of apps just kind
of vomit people into the app,

55
00:03:25.046 --> 00:03:27.182
for want of a better word.

56
00:03:27.182 --> 00:03:29.954
And so people use it for five minutes and

57
00:03:29.954 --> 00:03:34.330
go, this doesn't do what I want,
and then they they cancel.

58
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.711
And so there's an opportunity there for

59
00:03:36.711 --> 00:03:39.377
you to give a better
onboarding experience.

60
00:03:39.377 --> 00:03:44.794
Often occurs competitor can have
the same features and functionality but

61
00:03:44.794 --> 00:03:49.685
if that feature and functionality
isn't obvious and easy to use,

62
00:03:49.685 --> 00:03:53.896
you can actually get a competitive
advantage from that.

63
00:03:53.896 --> 00:03:57.695
So oftentimes, you see in the UK at
least you see this with banking.

64
00:03:57.695 --> 00:04:03.553
They do advertising campaigns where
they'll say things like with our app,

65
00:04:03.553 --> 00:04:09.058
you can photograph your check and
not have to go and cash it in in person.

66
00:04:09.058 --> 00:04:12.842
Well, pretty much all UK apps or
banking apps do that, but

67
00:04:12.842 --> 00:04:17.322
some of them make it easier and
more obvious of how to do than others and

68
00:04:17.322 --> 00:04:20.747
they actually use that as
a competitive advantage.

69
00:04:20.747 --> 00:04:26.336
The other thing you've got to be pay
attention to with user experience and

70
00:04:26.336 --> 00:04:31.671
I mentioned this in the product design
course that I run is repeat use.

71
00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:34.486
With most apps, people are using
them again and again and again.

72
00:04:34.486 --> 00:04:40.434
So you're gonna need to use this app
a little while, give it a decent run.

73
00:04:40.434 --> 00:04:45.103
Because what you'll notice is that as
you try and use it for a little while,

74
00:04:45.103 --> 00:04:48.070
there'll be things that
start niggling you and

75
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.166
annoying you that you won't
necessarily notice the first time.

76
00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:55.290
So there'll be certain
actions that you do again and

77
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.136
again in the app that
maybe are a bit difficult.

78
00:04:58.136 --> 00:05:03.455
That's worth noting because those
kinds of things build up over time and

79
00:05:03.455 --> 00:05:06.332
can drive people away to competitors,

80
00:05:06.332 --> 00:05:11.491
especially if the competitor
explicitly says we solve this problem.

81
00:05:11.491 --> 00:05:14.164
And then accessibility is another one.

82
00:05:14.164 --> 00:05:18.616
And I don't just mean accessibility from
the kind of disabled user point of view,

83
00:05:18.616 --> 00:05:22.375
but does it work across different
platforms and different devices.

84
00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:28.578
So it's not unusual, for example,
to find a Mac only app, right?

85
00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:34.361
Well, they're not really a competitor
if I wanna go after the Windows users.

86
00:05:34.361 --> 00:05:38.981
So it can be quite useful to
know from that point of view.

87
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:43.009
So we've got features and functionality,
we've got user experience.

88
00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:47.789
We also wanna look at market position, how
they position themselves in the market.

89
00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:54.843
So what I mean by that is, who is the
primary audience that they're targeting?

90
00:05:54.843 --> 00:05:59.307
So there might be segments
that they're overlooking

91
00:05:59.307 --> 00:06:03.975
groups of people that they're
not trying to appeal to.

92
00:06:03.975 --> 00:06:06.675
We're not targeting that
maybe you could target, so

93
00:06:06.675 --> 00:06:08.717
you wanna know who their audiences are.

94
00:06:08.717 --> 00:06:13.550
And as we said in the chat room earlier,
you want someone to look at their pricing.

95
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.941
How are they?

96
00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:17.881
What tiers do they have,
what pricing model do they have?

97
00:06:17.881 --> 00:06:20.887
Do they have free trial or
premium options?

98
00:06:20.887 --> 00:06:23.977
All of that you wanna
make a note of as well.

99
00:06:23.977 --> 00:06:27.395
And then finally,
you wanna look at their brand, right?

100
00:06:27.395 --> 00:06:30.741
So this includes their value proposition,
so

101
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:34.517
specifically kind of how
they present themselves,

102
00:06:34.517 --> 00:06:40.370
what benefits that they provide to their
audiences, what benefits they claim.

103
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.453
The ones that they
highlight in particular.

104
00:06:42.453 --> 00:06:45.697
How is this app helping their users?

105
00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:50.422
That's at the heart of what you're
trying to understand, okay?

106
00:06:50.422 --> 00:06:53.577
So that's market positioning.

107
00:06:53.577 --> 00:06:54.986
You also wanna pay.

108
00:06:54.986 --> 00:06:57.742
There's quite a long list
of things to look for

109
00:06:57.742 --> 00:07:00.363
when you're looking at your competitors.

110
00:07:00.363 --> 00:07:05.072
You also wanna look at their strategy
when it comes to marketing, okay?

111
00:07:05.072 --> 00:07:08.772
So for example,
what's their digital presence like?

112
00:07:08.772 --> 00:07:11.022
What's their website like?

113
00:07:11.022 --> 00:07:12.175
What's their site like?

114
00:07:12.175 --> 00:07:15.589
Do they have lots of landing pages
aimed at different audiences?

115
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:19.334
How do they go about converting users,
right?

116
00:07:19.334 --> 00:07:24.194
What wording do they use,
what tone of voice do they use,

117
00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.436
what tactics do they use?

118
00:07:26.436 --> 00:07:28.971
What content marketing are they doing?

119
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:35.108
Do understand the kind of keywords
they're using on their blog posts.

120
00:07:35.108 --> 00:07:39.606
Are they targeting certain
audiences in their blog post?

121
00:07:39.606 --> 00:07:45.128
And how are they reaching people through
those kind of content marketing?

122
00:07:45.128 --> 00:07:47.814
So you look at something like HubSpot.

123
00:07:47.814 --> 00:07:52.920
And HubSpot have got a very
aggressive content marketing approach

124
00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:58.035
where they've got specific
keywords that they're going after.

125
00:07:58.035 --> 00:08:03.089
And they go off to them
aggressively through articles and

126
00:08:03.089 --> 00:08:06.255
help guides and that kind of thing.

127
00:08:06.255 --> 00:08:10.117
And then finally,
what are they doing with paid advertising?

128
00:08:10.117 --> 00:08:11.687
Are they using Google ads?

129
00:08:11.687 --> 00:08:14.609
Are they using social media advertising?

130
00:08:14.609 --> 00:08:18.970
So you could dive into it there as well.

131
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.835
Also pay good attention
to the customer feedback.

132
00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:25.576
So what reviews and
ratings are they getting?

133
00:08:25.576 --> 00:08:28.647
Platforms like G2 is
a great example of that,

134
00:08:28.647 --> 00:08:32.822
can provide you with lots of
insights into what clients like and

135
00:08:32.822 --> 00:08:36.315
what they dislike about
the company's solutions.

136
00:08:36.315 --> 00:08:41.166
And give you a sense of whether there
are weaknesses that you can exploit.

137
00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:45.018
And look at their case studies and
testimonials, okay?

138
00:08:45.018 --> 00:08:49.294
Because these will give you an idea
of the kind of use cases that their

139
00:08:49.294 --> 00:08:54.186
application is being used for and
the kind of sectors they're being used in.
