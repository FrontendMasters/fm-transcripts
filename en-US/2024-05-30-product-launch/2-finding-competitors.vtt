1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.061
And of course the other advantage of
going niche is that although there

2
00:00:05.061 --> 00:00:10.720
may be competitors, if those competitors
haven't gone as niche as you have,

3
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.870
you now to that niche look
even more valuable, right?

4
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.810
Because your product is tailored
specifically around them,

5
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.738
and their specific needs.

6
00:00:22.738 --> 00:00:26.718
And that brings me on to competitors and
finding out your competitors.

7
00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:32.799
And first thing you do really whenever
I have an idea is I find out,

8
00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:36.238
well who else has already done this?

9
00:00:36.238 --> 00:00:38.537
And there are loads of ways you can do it.

10
00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:41.917
It's not rocket It's science, and it
doesn't even take very long, to be honest.

11
00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:45.573
I mean, I'm sure you could do it
more thoroughly than this, but

12
00:00:45.573 --> 00:00:50.041
a reasonable good starting point is,
well, you start with a simple keyword,

13
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:51.819
[LAUGH] search, you Google it.

14
00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:56.605
But then I find sites like
product hunt and also G2.

15
00:00:56.605 --> 00:01:03.184
So these are reviews sites where people
comment on these kinds of things.

16
00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:07.094
Pierspot is another one.

17
00:01:07.094 --> 00:01:08.814
So there's quite a few of them around.

18
00:01:08.814 --> 00:01:11.051
And you can just have
a look on those sites and

19
00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:13.723
see whether you can find
anything that's similar.

20
00:01:13.723 --> 00:01:17.863
And then pay attention to what people
are saying about those competitors as

21
00:01:17.863 --> 00:01:22.411
well on those sites because you get
reviews and things which is great.

22
00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:25.011
Then of course, there's social media and
there's forums.

23
00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:28.581
If you're hanging out in the places
that your audience hangs out,

24
00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:32.531
they will mention products, right,
and they will mention things.

25
00:01:32.531 --> 00:01:35.979
And you can even ask in
these kinds of places,

26
00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.303
do you know of a good product that does
X because I could really do with it.

27
00:01:41.303 --> 00:01:45.763
And if X exists, then somebody often
will kind of suggest something.

28
00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:50.763
Also, you can get access to
a lot of industry reports.

29
00:01:50.763 --> 00:01:54.353
A lot of sectors have industry
reports that you can dig out.

30
00:01:54.353 --> 00:01:57.962
And they often mention the major
players in the sector, so

31
00:01:57.962 --> 00:02:00.634
that's worth checking as well.

32
00:02:00.634 --> 00:02:03.509
The other thing I use is
search engine optimization and

33
00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.644
search engine marketing tools as well.

34
00:02:06.664 --> 00:02:11.214
Because what you can do there is you can
research into keywords that are around

35
00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:16.104
your product and service, and it often
comes back with brand names as well.

36
00:02:16.104 --> 00:02:19.630
And then you can go check
out those brand names and

37
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.421
see whether they are a similar
competitor or not.

38
00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:25.274
Attending events is often good.

39
00:02:25.274 --> 00:02:29.536
If you can go to an event that
is related to your audience, so

40
00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:32.968
let's say you're creating
a Crocheting app.

41
00:02:32.968 --> 00:02:35.429
I don't know why crocheting,
[LAUGH] jumped into my mind.

42
00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:37.028
It's what my wife does.

43
00:02:37.028 --> 00:02:39.129
Let's say you're making a Crocheting app.

44
00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.216
Then there are crocheting meetups and
there are even crocheting events and

45
00:02:44.216 --> 00:02:48.665
things like that, very much at
my wheelhouse, but there you go.

46
00:02:48.665 --> 00:02:53.763
And it's worth going to those things cuz
there's often sponsors and there's people

47
00:02:53.763 --> 00:02:58.594
with stands and all that kind of stuff,
so you get to see what's in the industry.

48
00:02:58.594 --> 00:03:05.019
And then, this should be without saying,
but talk to your audience as well.

49
00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:11.795
And even if you are the audience, talk
to other people that are the audience,

50
00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:18.796
because you do not have a encyclopedic
knowledge of everything in your sector.

51
00:03:18.796 --> 00:03:21.618
Well, certainly I don't, there's so

52
00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:25.856
many apps these days that you
just can't cover everything.

53
00:03:25.856 --> 00:03:30.853
Couple of other places you can look for
competitors, news and

54
00:03:30.853 --> 00:03:34.804
publications is another
one that I look at a lot.

55
00:03:34.804 --> 00:03:41.949
So for example, there are tech blogs that
that just highlight new startups and

56
00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:47.374
those kinds of things can be
quite useful to look at as well.

57
00:03:47.374 --> 00:03:51.702
So once you've kind of
found your competitors,

58
00:03:51.702 --> 00:03:56.665
then the next step is really
to try out their offerings,

59
00:03:56.665 --> 00:03:59.742
see what they're actually like.

60
00:03:59.742 --> 00:04:05.165
I'm not saying you need to try
every competitor because you might

61
00:04:05.165 --> 00:04:11.278
be in a market with a lot of competitors,
but certainly try the big boys and

62
00:04:11.278 --> 00:04:17.604
try the ones that you think are most
similar to what you're gonna do, okay?

63
00:04:17.604 --> 00:04:21.792
And so as you begin to try and
explore their offerings,

64
00:04:21.792 --> 00:04:27.959
you're looking at their features,
you're looking at their usability.

65
00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:32.561
I almost always drop them
an email with a question so

66
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:35.782
I can test their customer support.

67
00:04:35.782 --> 00:04:39.995
Because you can have a product
that dominates the marketplace but

68
00:04:39.995 --> 00:04:42.599
if their customer support is terrible,

69
00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:47.285
that could differentiate you,
that could be an advantage that you get.

70
00:04:47.285 --> 00:04:51.149
So all of this will give you a better
understanding of what you're up against.

71
00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:57.355
And be honest with yourself.

72
00:04:57.355 --> 00:05:03.790
It's very easy in this kinda scenario
to just look at all their rubbish bits.

73
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.448
Yeah, they don't do this very well and

74
00:05:05.448 --> 00:05:08.430
they don't do that very well
it's human nature, right?

75
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.368
But equally write a list of the things
that you think they do really well

76
00:05:12.368 --> 00:05:12.910
as well.

77
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.181
Because otherwise you effectively delude
yourself into thinking that, yes,

78
00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:23.013
I could definitely compete with Amazon,
[LAUGH] can you?

79
00:05:23.013 --> 00:05:25.443
So yeah, do that a little bit.

80
00:05:25.443 --> 00:05:27.644
So you're trying the offering, but

81
00:05:27.644 --> 00:05:30.772
you also wanna pay attention
to their reach, okay?

82
00:05:30.772 --> 00:05:35.734
Because even if they've got an inferior
product, doesn't necessarily mean

83
00:05:35.734 --> 00:05:40.329
you can still compete with them because
they might have a massive reach.

84
00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:41.788
And what do I mean by reach?

85
00:05:41.788 --> 00:05:44.428
Well, I'm talking about
look at their advertising.

86
00:05:44.428 --> 00:05:46.478
Are they paying for
pay-per-click advertising?

87
00:05:46.478 --> 00:05:49.478
How often do they appear in
pay-per-click advertising?

88
00:05:49.478 --> 00:05:51.468
Are they appearing on relevant websites?

89
00:05:51.468 --> 00:05:52.589
Do they buy lots of banner ads?

90
00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:57.629
Are they throwing money at it basically,
which obviously you are gonna

91
00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:03.351
struggle to compete with unless you've
got some, you know, money behind you.

92
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:06.090
Social is another thing
to pay attention to.

93
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.257
How many followers do they
have on social media?

94
00:06:09.257 --> 00:06:10.548
And how often do they post?

95
00:06:10.548 --> 00:06:12.470
And how often do people reply to them?

96
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.738
And is the sentiment positive or
negative, all of that kind of thing.

97
00:06:17.738 --> 00:06:21.978
And there are tools out there
like BuzzSumo or Mention.com,

98
00:06:21.978 --> 00:06:25.085
which will help you do
those kinds of things.

99
00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:29.702
And that can be very useful because
it will give you a sense of whether

100
00:06:29.702 --> 00:06:34.645
they're papering over weaknesses in
their customer relationship with

101
00:06:34.645 --> 00:06:38.876
huge amounts of advertising cuz
some organizations do that.

102
00:06:38.876 --> 00:06:44.424
And so there may be an opportunity to get
in there, even if they're throwing a lot

103
00:06:44.424 --> 00:06:50.312
of money at it, because actually people
don't, [LAUGH] like them very much, right?

104
00:06:50.312 --> 00:06:52.830
And then the third thing
is look at the media.

105
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.657
How often they're
mentioned on media sites.

106
00:06:54.657 --> 00:06:58.016
Have they got good PR going on?

107
00:06:58.016 --> 00:07:01.282
So back pay attention to
all of that kind of stuff.

108
00:07:01.282 --> 00:07:06.572
Cuz I'll be honest with you, there
have been many times in my experience

109
00:07:06.572 --> 00:07:11.687
where with that VPN, I said,
I think you're gonna struggle to ever be

110
00:07:11.687 --> 00:07:16.650
anything more than a very niche
offering for a very small audience.

111
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.346
Because the biggest players who
just dominated they've got such big

112
00:07:20.346 --> 00:07:23.671
reach that I think you're gonna
struggle to get any further.

113
00:07:23.671 --> 00:07:24.819
Yeah, go for it Mark.

114
00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:29.988
&gt;&gt; Online, someone's asking,
what about instances where

115
00:07:29.988 --> 00:07:36.118
the competitors offer a free option and
have extremely large reach?

116
00:07:36.118 --> 00:07:39.965
And you're offering would have to be
paid but also not tried and true.

117
00:07:39.965 --> 00:07:43.711
Is there something that,
you should look forward to say,

118
00:07:43.711 --> 00:07:46.548
I should shy the away from this market,
or?

119
00:07:46.548 --> 00:07:50.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we're gonna talk
more about pricing models later.

120
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.382
So I won't get into that too much now.

121
00:07:53.382 --> 00:07:59.345
I mean, if I was confronted with
a someone that offered a free option,

122
00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:05.815
had big venture capital backing and
I was trying to bootstrap something up,

123
00:08:05.815 --> 00:08:10.382
if I'm honest in most cases
I'd probably walk away.

124
00:08:10.382 --> 00:08:16.907
And there's no shame in that, that's why
we're doing this, this process, right?

125
00:08:16.907 --> 00:08:20.553
If we're just gonna conclude at
the end of the time, we're gonna

126
00:08:20.553 --> 00:08:24.881
barrel on regardless, then why are we
even bothering with market research?

127
00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:28.672
So a lot of the time I'd walk away there.

128
00:08:28.672 --> 00:08:32.803
The other option is you just
go very niche in that and

129
00:08:32.803 --> 00:08:36.936
that you focus on doing
something very specific for

130
00:08:36.936 --> 00:08:41.280
a very specific audience and
you just do it very well.
