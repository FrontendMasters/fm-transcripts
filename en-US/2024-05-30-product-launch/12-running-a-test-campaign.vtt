00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.182
So we come now in many ways to the
critical moment of, well, let's find out

2
00:00:05.182 --> 00:00:10.227
whether this actually works or not,
whether we got a viable product here.

3
00:00:10.227 --> 00:00:16.038
And actually, when I first sat
down to create this workshop,

4
00:00:16.038 --> 00:00:19.855
it was this part that was the heart of it.

5
00:00:19.855 --> 00:00:23.445
For me because this is what I've been
doing with various startups that I've

6
00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:24.129
worked with.

7
00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:28.739
And it's turned into a very
good way of kind of getting

8
00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.538
a sense of whether an app has got legs or
not.

9
00:00:32.538 --> 00:00:37.421
Basically, what we're gonna do is
we're gonna run a test campaign as

10
00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:41.558
if this product was a real live breathy,
living thing, and

11
00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:45.898
we're gonna see whether anybody
is interested or not right?

12
00:00:45.898 --> 00:00:50.613
So it's kind of fake it till
you make it kind of scenario or

13
00:00:50.613 --> 00:00:56.240
it's all smoke and mirrors but
it'll teach us what we want to know.

14
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.788
So what we're gonna learn
from this campaign, right?

15
00:00:59.788 --> 00:01:04.582
One, we will find out whether we
have a plan in place that will

16
00:01:04.582 --> 00:01:08.248
actually consistently
drive leads whether we

17
00:01:08.248 --> 00:01:12.760
are capable of acquiring
people's attention, right?

18
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.328
Can we get their attention?

19
00:01:14.328 --> 00:01:19.095
Secondly, can we cause get
them to convert, right?

20
00:01:19.095 --> 00:01:24.217
We want to find out get an idea of
what our conversion rate will be.

21
00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:29.051
And then finally,
it's an opportunity to make some decisions

22
00:01:29.051 --> 00:01:33.347
around pricing and
how we're gonna model the pricing.

23
00:01:33.347 --> 00:01:36.793
So it might be that we don't
just run one campaign,

24
00:01:36.793 --> 00:01:41.135
it might be that we run multiple
test campaigns as we learn more.

25
00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:44.911
So we might try one with
certain tactics doesn't work.

26
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:47.207
So we'll try it with another
tactic doesn't work.

27
00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:48.243
Try it with a third tactic.

28
00:01:48.243 --> 00:01:49.545
Yeah, that was working better.

29
00:01:49.545 --> 00:01:53.104
Right now we'll see if we will
try it with a freemium model.

30
00:01:53.104 --> 00:01:57.970
Does that work and fiddle around
with different criteria until we've

31
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.282
got something we feel is robust.

32
00:02:00.282 --> 00:02:05.220
And then we can go full steam into
development because we're much more

33
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.655
confident about what can be done.

34
00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:11.474
So steps in running this campaign, okay?

35
00:02:11.474 --> 00:02:16.150
First of all, we're gonna agree
what success looks like, okay?

36
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.296
Because obviously,

37
00:02:17.296 --> 00:02:21.124
success can't look like we've just
earned a lot of money from people.

38
00:02:21.124 --> 00:02:23.310
Because we haven't built anything yet.

39
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.268
So that would be what is generally
classed as immoral, right?

40
00:02:28.268 --> 00:02:33.159
[LAUGH] so we don't want to do that or
perhaps we do, I'm not gonna judge.

41
00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.578
Second, we need to set our price, okay?

42
00:02:36.578 --> 00:02:40.703
So we're gonna put a price in now and
give an indication of price,

43
00:02:40.703 --> 00:02:43.705
even i we don't take money from people,
okay?

44
00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:49.024
Cuz price is a critical factor in
whether this is gonna succeed or fail.

45
00:02:49.024 --> 00:02:53.776
Third, we're gonna build a landing page,
which is gonna be

46
00:02:53.776 --> 00:02:58.820
the test bed of whether we can
convert people or not, all right?

47
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.558
And fourth, we're gonna drive
traffic to that page, and

48
00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:08.102
then we're gonna see if people convert,
but finally,

49
00:03:08.102 --> 00:03:11.794
we don't wanna waste those people, right?

50
00:03:11.794 --> 00:03:16.575
So because they can't actually buy the
product at the end of the day, but they've

51
00:03:16.575 --> 00:03:20.889
shown interest and we might have even
paid a bit of money to get them there.

52
00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.858
So we don't wanna waste them, so
we're also gonna look at nurturing that

53
00:03:24.858 --> 00:03:29.419
audience over the long term until we've
got an actual product to sell them, right?

54
00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:30.921
All make sense?

55
00:03:30.921 --> 00:03:32.474
Any questions about that?

56
00:03:32.474 --> 00:03:35.059
It's really important that
everybody's clear on this one.
