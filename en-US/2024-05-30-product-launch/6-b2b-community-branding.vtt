1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.465
I wanna say a little bit about
differentiating for different audiences,

2
00:00:04.465 --> 00:00:05.840
if that's all right.

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.220
There's the B2B audiences,
and there's B2C audiences.

4
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.573
So if you're targeting B2B, you,
I think, probably wanna slightly

5
00:00:14.573 --> 00:00:19.587
different approach than if you're
targeting two end consumers.

6
00:00:19.587 --> 00:00:23.799
It's very easy to think,
I'm building a SaaS app, so

7
00:00:23.799 --> 00:00:28.960
I'm targeting end consumers, but
oftentimes, that's not the case.

8
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.697
So B2B, there's kind of three ways
of of differentiating via audience.

9
00:00:36.697 --> 00:00:40.997
You could differentiate with verticals,
so can say,

10
00:00:40.997 --> 00:00:46.138
I'm going to build a product that
targets a particular sector and

11
00:00:46.138 --> 00:00:50.078
is going to accommodate
their particular needs.

12
00:00:50.078 --> 00:00:56.786
So for example, I am going to build a
content management system that is designed

13
00:00:56.786 --> 00:01:03.609
specifically to meet the content needs
of the higher education sector, right?

14
00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.638
And a product exists that's like that.

15
00:01:06.638 --> 00:01:12.124
And so they managed to thrive in a world
of big players like WordPress and

16
00:01:12.124 --> 00:01:17.063
Drupal, and stuff like that because
they meet the very specific

17
00:01:17.063 --> 00:01:19.638
needs of that vertical, right?

18
00:01:19.638 --> 00:01:23.513
Another one is to
differentiate based on size.

19
00:01:23.513 --> 00:01:29.233
So if your competitors are all focusing
at the enterprise level of the market,

20
00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:34.087
trying to sell to the the IBMs and
the Nike's and people like that,

21
00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:38.521
then you can focus on the SME
side of the market or vice versa.

22
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:42.000
So you can differentiate with size,
and then finally,

23
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.227
you can differentiate via region.

24
00:01:44.227 --> 00:01:49.515
Focus on a specific country or a specific
region to accommodate their unique

25
00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:54.653
situation, whether that be legal,
whether it be language, whatever.

26
00:01:54.653 --> 00:01:59.539
Now with B2C, it's slightly different,
but not dissimilar.

27
00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.141
So if you wanna differentiate from
your competitors in a B2C market,

28
00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:10.310
business-to-consumer, then you might wanna
consider focusing on different interests.

29
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.145
So you might be creating a app that

30
00:02:15.145 --> 00:02:20.673
allows you to organize information,

31
00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:24.829
right, a notion style app.

32
00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.428
And while notion has gone very broad and
have gone to everybody,

33
00:02:29.428 --> 00:02:34.369
you could say, well, I'm gonna
build an information organization

34
00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:38.815
app just aimed at people that
play fantasy football, right?

35
00:02:38.815 --> 00:02:42.274
Or do something, various other interests.

36
00:02:42.274 --> 00:02:46.902
So you can kind of segment
via the interest groups, and

37
00:02:46.902 --> 00:02:52.233
either hone in while your
competitors go broad, you go niche,

38
00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:59.087
or while they focus on one interest group,
you focus on another interest group.

39
00:02:59.087 --> 00:03:01.040
And then there's demographics.

40
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.267
If a competitor focuses on
a particular age group or

41
00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:08.100
a particular level of education,
you can focus elsewhere.

42
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.955
So there, they might be focusing on
the youth market, you might focus on

43
00:03:12.955 --> 00:03:17.900
the over 50s market, which by the way,
is the coolest market, right?

44
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.698
I just wanna say that.

45
00:03:19.698 --> 00:03:20.417
Gen X?

46
00:03:20.417 --> 00:03:25.321
Yeah, the Gen X market, we're
the people you should be focusing on,

47
00:03:25.321 --> 00:03:26.580
nobody loves us.

48
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.684
And then the third again,
you could do regions,

49
00:03:29.684 --> 00:03:32.267
that's the other way of doing it there.

50
00:03:32.267 --> 00:03:34.530
So she can differentiate via audience.

51
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.490
And actually,
audience is the way that I most like to

52
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.060
differentiate because
I like to niche down.

53
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.870
And a kind of related way to that is you
can differentiate through community as

54
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.718
well, and that kinda goes hand
in hand with audience as well.

55
00:03:48.718 --> 00:03:53.911
I find community building a really good
way of differentiating from competitors,

56
00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:56.727
cuz a lot of competitors,
in my experience,

57
00:03:56.727 --> 00:03:59.338
treat their customers like cash counts.

58
00:03:59.338 --> 00:04:02.193
They're just numbers that generate income.

59
00:04:02.193 --> 00:04:06.501
And the really successful businesses
are ones that try to build

60
00:04:06.501 --> 00:04:08.053
a sense of community.

61
00:04:08.053 --> 00:04:12.406
And, I'm sorry, I keep coming
back to Frontend Masters cuz it's

62
00:04:12.406 --> 00:04:17.241
obviously a common example that we all
share, is a great example of this.

63
00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:20.426
They're very good at engaging
with their community,

64
00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:25.076
they've got discord channels,
they've got blogs, they've got podcasts.

65
00:04:25.076 --> 00:04:29.841
There's a lot more than just their core
offering that exists to build a sense of

66
00:04:29.841 --> 00:04:30.642
community.

67
00:04:30.642 --> 00:04:33.673
They provide great support,

68
00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:39.011
which is a critical part
of any community building.

69
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:43.936
And they're listening to their customers,
they're getting feedback the whole time.

70
00:04:43.936 --> 00:04:47.509
But also, you can build
community in other ways as well.

71
00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:51.482
And this doesn't apply so
much to Frontend Masters, but

72
00:04:51.482 --> 00:04:56.945
you can allow people to create things
using your platform, using your thing,

73
00:04:56.945 --> 00:05:02.760
whether it be create templates or plugins
or build their own web apps on your thing.

74
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.003
Which is the kind of opposite of what
we were talking about earlier, and

75
00:05:06.003 --> 00:05:09.085
when we were talking about building
on other people's platforms,

76
00:05:09.085 --> 00:05:12.947
you can actually encourage people to make
use of your platform and theirs, as well.

77
00:05:12.947 --> 00:05:15.330
And then you can also build community,
and again,

78
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.056
Frontend Masters is a great example of
this one, through thought leadership.

79
00:05:19.056 --> 00:05:21.929
I hate that term was so,
such a passion, but

80
00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:25.203
I couldn't think of another
one that was better.

81
00:05:25.203 --> 00:05:28.365
Yeah, by basically providing advice and
articles and

82
00:05:28.365 --> 00:05:32.572
teaching people, which is what
Frontend Masters is all about, right?

83
00:05:32.572 --> 00:05:34.852
So there are lots of
ways to build community.

84
00:05:34.852 --> 00:05:38.745
I mean,
a great example of this is Figma actually,

85
00:05:38.745 --> 00:05:41.653
that Figma ticks most of those boxes.

86
00:05:41.653 --> 00:05:46.029
I don't think its customer support
is amazing, it's a write in it, but

87
00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:47.477
it's not incredible.

88
00:05:47.477 --> 00:05:51.709
But the other two areas, they do very
well, so they've got this whole community

89
00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:55.583
area where people can create plugins,
where they can create templates.

90
00:05:55.583 --> 00:05:59.406
There's a lot of sharing of
material that goes on there.

91
00:05:59.406 --> 00:06:02.436
There's also a lot of learning
material around Figma.

92
00:06:02.436 --> 00:06:06.376
It provides a lot of thought leadership,
that kind of stuff.

93
00:06:06.376 --> 00:06:12.897
But customer support is a great
way of differentiating itself.

94
00:06:12.897 --> 00:06:16.631
And there's loads of ways you can do that,
offering 24/7 support.

95
00:06:16.631 --> 00:06:21.175
And you might think, well, that's too
much for me to do of my lonesome, but

96
00:06:21.175 --> 00:06:25.932
it is possible to, there are services that
will provide that kind of thing if you

97
00:06:25.932 --> 00:06:28.786
feel you're gonna
differentiate in that way.

98
00:06:28.786 --> 00:06:33.595
Responding fast makes a huge difference,
just getting back to people quickly.

99
00:06:33.595 --> 00:06:36.878
Personalizing it, have you ever
written to a customer support and

100
00:06:36.878 --> 00:06:40.804
you get the result back, and it's like
you haven't listen to what I've said,

101
00:06:40.804 --> 00:06:42.817
you've just sent me a canned response.

102
00:06:42.817 --> 00:06:45.577
It's the most annoying thing in the world.

103
00:06:45.577 --> 00:06:47.416
There's multi channel,

104
00:06:47.416 --> 00:06:52.187
being able to contact people through
whatever channel you prefer.

105
00:06:52.187 --> 00:06:57.904
And then there's community driven support
where the community supports itself.

106
00:06:57.904 --> 00:07:01.631
Publishing your roadmap of what you're
planning to do next is a great way of

107
00:07:01.631 --> 00:07:05.136
engaging with your community and
showing support to your customers.

108
00:07:05.136 --> 00:07:09.571
And then offering self-service
support through help documents,

109
00:07:09.571 --> 00:07:11.522
knowledge base, et cetera.

110
00:07:11.522 --> 00:07:15.452
You can also differentiate
through flexibility.

111
00:07:15.452 --> 00:07:21.842
So allowing people to customize your
app in a way that the competition

112
00:07:21.842 --> 00:07:27.363
doesn't allow from what it
outputs to the user interface.

113
00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:34.182
Opening up APIs where people can basically
build whatever they want on your app.

114
00:07:34.182 --> 00:07:36.538
If your competition aren't
doing that very well,

115
00:07:36.538 --> 00:07:38.413
that could be a way of differentiating.

116
00:07:38.413 --> 00:07:42.752
Offering a plugin into architecture
can sometimes be appropriate,

117
00:07:42.752 --> 00:07:45.080
as well as ways of differentiating.

118
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.728
And you can differentiate
with branding as well.

119
00:07:49.728 --> 00:07:54.244
I know as an audience that's primarily
developers, you might poo poo that

120
00:07:54.244 --> 00:07:58.918
a little bit and think that that's all
just icing on the cake and prettiness.

121
00:07:58.918 --> 00:08:03.800
But branding is not more than just the
kind of pretty interface side of things

122
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.175
and the colors and stuff you choose.

123
00:08:06.175 --> 00:08:08.495
It's also your value of proposition,
right?

124
00:08:08.495 --> 00:08:10.154
How you explain your app and

125
00:08:10.154 --> 00:08:14.495
the benefits that it provides that
sets it apart from the competitors.

126
00:08:14.495 --> 00:08:16.833
It's the tone of voice that you use.

127
00:08:16.833 --> 00:08:21.272
While your competitors might be
super formal and enterprise, and

128
00:08:21.272 --> 00:08:25.168
you could be chatty and
humorous, right, or vice versa.

129
00:08:25.168 --> 00:08:27.763
You can pick a different tone of voice and

130
00:08:27.763 --> 00:08:30.749
you can also use a different
design language.

131
00:08:30.749 --> 00:08:35.943
Where maybe everybody else is really
formal and stuffy and you can come in as

132
00:08:35.943 --> 00:08:41.063
something that's more casual and
more approachable, yeah, go for it.

133
00:08:41.063 --> 00:08:44.763
I was just thinking about
liquid death is water?

134
00:08:44.763 --> 00:08:45.826
[LAUGH] Yeah.

135
00:08:45.826 --> 00:08:50.706
It's just water, it's liquid death and
it's looks like you're drinking a beer or

136
00:08:50.706 --> 00:08:52.778
something, but it's just water.

137
00:08:52.778 --> 00:08:53.293
Yeah.

138
00:08:53.293 --> 00:08:58.306
And somehow like a billion
dollar company or something.

139
00:08:58.306 --> 00:09:01.040
And we have some, I think,
in the fridge, whatever.

140
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.532
Yeah, but I mean,
that's a very extreme example of that.

141
00:09:06.532 --> 00:09:11.320
But you can do a more middle example,
I mean, I used to love Mailchimp.

142
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:17.524
They've lost a lot of it now, but they
really knew how to tailor their voice and

143
00:09:17.524 --> 00:09:22.882
their tone to their audience and
differentiate all themselves from

144
00:09:22.882 --> 00:09:28.898
all the other competitors in the market,
which were all kinda very staid and

145
00:09:28.898 --> 00:09:33.515
corporate and they had this
much more younger funky tone.

146
00:09:33.515 --> 00:09:36.969
But it was a tone that adapt based
on how people were feeling and

147
00:09:36.969 --> 00:09:38.570
what was going on in the app.

148
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:43.620
And they had little design delighters
like when they sent an email,

149
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.645
you had a little kind of high five to you.

150
00:09:46.645 --> 00:09:50.114
And you know that if you repeatedly
clicked on that high five,

151
00:09:50.114 --> 00:09:54.333
if you high-fived it back with your
cursor, the hand would slowly go red?

152
00:09:54.333 --> 00:09:57.775
[LAUGH]
It's just brilliant.

153
00:09:57.775 --> 00:10:02.095
So yeah,
those kinds of things add personality and

154
00:10:02.095 --> 00:10:07.731
connect in a way that maybe more
staid competitors aren't gonna.

155
00:10:07.731 --> 00:10:12.035
And before you say, there are some
people that will be sitting there going,

156
00:10:12.035 --> 00:10:15.206
well, I kinda wanna aim at
a corporate market, right?

157
00:10:15.206 --> 00:10:20.831
Just because you're aiming at a corporate
market doesn't mean you have to be boring,

158
00:10:20.831 --> 00:10:21.378
right?

159
00:10:21.378 --> 00:10:22.841
Because ultimately,

160
00:10:22.841 --> 00:10:26.847
every person that works in that
corporation is a human being.

161
00:10:26.847 --> 00:10:31.094
They laugh at fart jokes just
the same as everybody else, right?

162
00:10:31.094 --> 00:10:36.311
And the thing that I always say
is if the CIA was able to add

163
00:10:36.311 --> 00:10:43.199
humor into their Twitter stream,
then your corporate application can.

164
00:10:43.199 --> 00:10:48.112
The very first tweet that CIA ever
published was, we can neither confirm nor

165
00:10:48.112 --> 00:10:50.358
deny this is our Twitter channel.

166
00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:52.562
[LAUGH] Brilliant, right?

167
00:10:52.562 --> 00:10:55.694
And that's the CIA, so
you can always use humor.

168
00:10:55.694 --> 00:10:59.706
You can always add personality,
you can always be a human being.

169
00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:04.428
I work with people in
really large enterprise

170
00:11:04.428 --> 00:11:09.160
customers and
I'm like this the whole time.

171
00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:14.617
Sometimes people don't like me, but
people don't like me in real life as well,

172
00:11:14.617 --> 00:11:18.409
so it's nothing to do with
the corporate environment.

173
00:11:18.409 --> 00:11:23.789
So you do all of this market research and
I wanna say it, right?

174
00:11:23.789 --> 00:11:28.544
And I'm gonna keep saying it and
it does sound a bit negative,

175
00:11:28.544 --> 00:11:33.221
but it's okay to get to the end
of that and walk away, right?

176
00:11:33.221 --> 00:11:37.157
It's okay to say no this
isn't a valid idea, and

177
00:11:37.157 --> 00:11:43.301
it's hard to do that if it's been your
baby that you've got excited about,

178
00:11:43.301 --> 00:11:48.011
but you'll have another baby
that you get excited about.

179
00:11:48.011 --> 00:11:52.826
So just to wrap up this kind of
market segment part of it, basically,

180
00:11:52.826 --> 00:11:57.403
take the time to broadly define
your niche before you even begin.

181
00:11:57.403 --> 00:12:01.034
Otherwise, you're gonna have no
kind of structured work with him.

182
00:12:01.034 --> 00:12:05.343
Find the competitors in the niche,
review those competitors so

183
00:12:05.343 --> 00:12:09.810
you really understand them, and
then use that to identify gaps and

184
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:13.421
ways to differentiate
yourself in the marketplace.
