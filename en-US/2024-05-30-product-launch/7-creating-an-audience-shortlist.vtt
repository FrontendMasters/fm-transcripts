1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.504
So, that is reviewing the market and

2
00:00:02.504 --> 00:00:07.320
it is definitely the place that
I would encourage you to start.

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.356
But very quickly after that,

4
00:00:09.356 --> 00:00:14.170
you need to get into the idea of
understanding your audience, right?

5
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.140
And, this is a really interesting
balance that you need to find here,

6
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.131
because you don't just need
to find your audience,

7
00:00:25.131 --> 00:00:29.252
you also need to tailor
the app to the audience.

8
00:00:29.252 --> 00:00:32.172
So it's a symbiotic relationship.

9
00:00:32.172 --> 00:00:37.689
So if you've had an idea for an app,
the chances are there won't be the perfect

10
00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:43.662
audience out there for that app exactly
as you've got it in your head, right?

11
00:00:43.662 --> 00:00:47.272
Because it just doesn't work like that.

12
00:00:47.272 --> 00:00:51.856
Instead, you need to find that
audience and then allow what you learn

13
00:00:51.856 --> 00:00:55.662
about the audience to inform
the exact nature of the app.

14
00:00:57.432 --> 00:01:00.939
So just bear that in mind,
and that's why it's so

15
00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:05.199
important to really not just
kind of segment your audience or

16
00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.936
define your niche or whatever pretentious
marketing jargon you want to throw around.

17
00:01:11.936 --> 00:01:16.263
You also have to really understand
those people so that you can understand

18
00:01:16.263 --> 00:01:20.189
the unique things that they want
from the thing you're creating.

19
00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.807
Right, and now I think it's one of
the big mistakes again that I see is

20
00:01:24.807 --> 00:01:29.759
because we jump into developing it
because that's what we know how to do.

21
00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.879
And we build the thing and
then go and look for the audience.

22
00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:36.059
But it's not that binary.

23
00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:39.169
It's messier than that.

24
00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:42.492
So let's talk about a day adapting
your app for your audience just so

25
00:01:42.492 --> 00:01:44.829
you can see some ways that that is done.

26
00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:50.342
First of all, you will have to adapt
your features, what precisely the app

27
00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:56.589
will do needs to be tailored to the
audience that you are targeting, right?

28
00:01:56.589 --> 00:02:00.188
So it may be that some of the ideas
you've had are just not relevant for

29
00:02:00.188 --> 00:02:01.069
that audience.

30
00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.152
There may be things for

31
00:02:02.152 --> 00:02:05.459
features that you hadn't considered
that will need to be included.

32
00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.769
And then there's the top tasks.

33
00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.958
Depending on the niche that you've picked,
the audience that you've picked,

34
00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:16.098
there will be different features
that they care about more,

35
00:02:16.098 --> 00:02:18.399
things that they want to do more.

36
00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:23.200
And so we need to make sure that
those features are highlighted, and

37
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.772
what those features are will
depend on the audience.

38
00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:28.750
And then finally,

39
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.352
there's how we communicate with our
audience will depend on who they are.

40
00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:36.972
You need to talk to different
people in different ways.

41
00:02:36.972 --> 00:02:41.003
So we need to understand our audience,
and to do that, first of all,

42
00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:43.584
we need to pick our audience specifically.

43
00:02:43.584 --> 00:02:48.435
So the way that I tend to do this is I
identify all the possible audiences I can

44
00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:49.674
think of, right?

45
00:02:49.674 --> 00:02:54.923
So I'm just brainstorming lots and
lots of different audiences,

46
00:02:54.923 --> 00:03:00.646
then I shortlist those audiences into
ones that I think are most viable.

47
00:03:01.816 --> 00:03:06.528
I pick an initial target of an audience
that I'm initially gonna build for

48
00:03:06.528 --> 00:03:09.196
and then I dig deeper into that audience.

49
00:03:09.196 --> 00:03:11.296
Those are the steps.

50
00:03:13.046 --> 00:03:15.926
Now let's run through those
in a bit more detail.

51
00:03:15.926 --> 00:03:19.516
So step one is identify
your possible audiences.

52
00:03:19.516 --> 00:03:25.059
Again, this is gonna depend on
whether we're targeting B2B and B2C.

53
00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:27.399
But just to recap what I've
literally just said, but

54
00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:30.109
I'm gonna say it again just
because we're now at that point.

55
00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:35.149
If your B2B, look at different verticals.

56
00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:37.273
What are all the verticals that you could,

57
00:03:37.273 --> 00:03:40.223
all the different sectors that
you might be able to target,

58
00:03:40.223 --> 00:03:44.577
that might be interested in whatever
it is you're building, right?

59
00:03:44.577 --> 00:03:50.547
What are the different size of
organizations that you could target?

60
00:03:50.547 --> 00:03:55.735
Yeah, it's obvious, and what different
regions might you've target.

61
00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:59.403
Don't constrain yourself at this point,
just write everything.

62
00:03:59.403 --> 00:04:03.442
You don't need to write
every country on the planet,

63
00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:08.110
cuz I don't think anybody's
gonna buy it in Antarctica, but

64
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.251
anything that's reasonably sane,
put on that list at that point.

65
00:04:13.251 --> 00:04:15.903
So to give you some ideas of what
those different things mean,

66
00:04:15.903 --> 00:04:18.004
cuz it might not always
be immediately obvious.

67
00:04:18.004 --> 00:04:21.674
If you're talking about verticals,
some verticals might be health care,

68
00:04:21.674 --> 00:04:23.280
higher education, charities,

69
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.119
finance, technology, right, real estate,
as we were talking about earlier.

70
00:04:28.119 --> 00:04:32.328
And sizes might be based on revenue,
based on the number of employees,

71
00:04:32.328 --> 00:04:36.915
the market share they've got,
the assets they've got, their valuation.

72
00:04:36.915 --> 00:04:41.941
That's a way different ways
of sizing an organization.

73
00:04:41.941 --> 00:04:46.612
And region might be geographic region, it
might be country, it might be state, city,

74
00:04:46.612 --> 00:04:50.331
it might even be down a zip code for
crying out loud.

75
00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:56.077
I'm working on an app at the moment
that's intending to roll out nationally,

76
00:04:56.077 --> 00:05:00.950
but it's starting just on
the Lower East Side of New York, right,

77
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.839
in order to pick its initial audience.

78
00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:10.125
If you're working on B2C, as I said
earlier, its interests, its demographics,

79
00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:11.789
and its region.

80
00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.213
So to look at those in a bit more detail,
interest might be sports,

81
00:05:16.213 --> 00:05:19.737
hobbies, media, values, lifestyle.

82
00:05:19.737 --> 00:05:23.177
They're all different interests that
people have that you might be able to

83
00:05:23.177 --> 00:05:24.487
target around.

84
00:05:24.487 --> 00:05:29.248
Demographics might include age,
gender, education, income,

85
00:05:29.248 --> 00:05:33.167
family, and then regions again,
the same as before.

86
00:05:34.607 --> 00:05:38.087
And like I said, you can look at
your competition for inspiration.

87
00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:39.806
Who are they gonna target?

88
00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:44.994
Who follows them is always a good
starting point, but you could also look

89
00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:51.856
beyond that, who's talking about the pain
points that you're solving, right?

90
00:05:51.856 --> 00:05:54.232
So on social media, on the internet,

91
00:05:54.232 --> 00:05:57.592
who's moaning about the thing
that you're fixing.

92
00:05:57.592 --> 00:06:00.916
So I tend to use Buzzsumo
to help with that.

93
00:06:00.916 --> 00:06:03.826
Hootsuite is quite good for
helping with that.

94
00:06:03.826 --> 00:06:08.826
And mention.com are all good for kind of
analyzing what people are saying online.

95
00:06:10.276 --> 00:06:15.777
And like I was saying before,
I look at related SEO terms in

96
00:06:15.777 --> 00:06:20.941
order to give me a sense of
the different kind of apps and

97
00:06:20.941 --> 00:06:23.765
which is performing better.

98
00:06:23.765 --> 00:06:24.925
So let me give you an example.

99
00:06:24.925 --> 00:06:27.647
So if you're creating a task app and

100
00:06:27.647 --> 00:06:32.415
what are all the related phrases
associated with task apps?

101
00:06:32.415 --> 00:06:38.415
So project task management or
housework task app or that kind of thing.

102
00:06:38.415 --> 00:06:42.293
And then I'll actually compare paired the
levels with one another, which ones have

103
00:06:42.293 --> 00:06:45.972
got the biggest market associated with
them just to give me a kind of idea.

104
00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:50.973
So you can use things like keyword
manager, Google Keyword manager for

105
00:06:50.973 --> 00:06:55.720
that or Ahrefs or SMErush,
will all help kind of you understand what

106
00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.277
different terminologies
is being used around it.

107
00:07:00.277 --> 00:07:02.347
So once I've done that initial brainstorm,

108
00:07:02.347 --> 00:07:06.427
I've got massive big list of potential
audiences that that I like the look of.

109
00:07:06.427 --> 00:07:08.877
It's then time to shortlist them, right,

110
00:07:08.877 --> 00:07:13.407
to get them down to ones that would
actually make a feasible business, okay?

111
00:07:13.407 --> 00:07:20.865
What I do to do that is I start by just
removing the impractical options, right?

112
00:07:20.865 --> 00:07:25.901
So I can't speak Mandarin,
so probably that excludes

113
00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:30.826
a big Asian market that I
probably don't wanna look at

114
00:07:30.826 --> 00:07:36.421
initially because that's a bit
out my wheelhouse, right?

115
00:07:36.421 --> 00:07:38.761
Or I know nothing about crochet, so

116
00:07:38.761 --> 00:07:43.290
I probably don't wanna target
the crochet market and so on, right?

117
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:48.740
So I kind of just get rid of ones that are
pretty impractical for whatever reason.

118
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.658
And then from what's remain
is I prioritize them, right?

119
00:07:52.658 --> 00:07:57.458
So I now just start organizing them
based on some criteria to go with

120
00:07:57.458 --> 00:07:59.956
which has got the most potential.

121
00:07:59.956 --> 00:08:03.312
Now, obviously you need
to know how I prioritize.

122
00:08:03.312 --> 00:08:07.160
So I often start with stock
market size and growth potential,

123
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.600
it's not to say that always go with
the biggest cuz like I said earlier,

124
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.702
niching down is good,
but I do look at volume.

125
00:08:14.702 --> 00:08:18.457
Is the audience large enough to
sustain and grow my business?

126
00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:23.720
Or would I need to secondary audiences
to support it, and that's fine, right?

127
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.129
The app that I was talking
about a minute ago,

128
00:08:26.129 --> 00:08:29.030
which is starting on the Lower East Side,
right?

129
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.870
They know that it's not gonna be
sustained on the Lower East Side.

130
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.930
That's not gonna be enough.

131
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.640
That's just their initial audience.

132
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.320
But you kind of need to be
aware of that going in.

133
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.185
And then there's growth.

134
00:08:41.185 --> 00:08:44.355
Look for a market with growth potential.

135
00:08:44.355 --> 00:08:51.355
So maybe, it's a market that
you know is growing over time.

136
00:08:51.355 --> 00:08:55.855
So for example, baby boomers
are really getting old now, right?

137
00:08:55.855 --> 00:09:00.391
So if you were creating a care app,
for example, great,

138
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:04.563
there's a growth market
there until they will die.

139
00:09:04.563 --> 00:09:08.012
And then you've got Gen Xs to deal with,
who as we have established,

140
00:09:08.012 --> 00:09:09.327
are the best generation.

141
00:09:09.327 --> 00:09:14.062
So great market size and potential.

142
00:09:14.062 --> 00:09:17.102
Then there's market needs and
pain points as well.

143
00:09:18.932 --> 00:09:23.460
So does your product offer a compelling
solution to a specific need,

144
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.637
problem, or pain point for
your audiences in that list?

145
00:09:27.637 --> 00:09:30.205
If it's not a really compelling thing,

146
00:09:30.205 --> 00:09:34.157
then deprioritize that
as a potential audience.

147
00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:37.401
So you can really focus in on just
the ones that you've got something really

148
00:09:37.401 --> 00:09:38.027
compelling.

149
00:09:39.265 --> 00:09:41.245
But also consider underserved needs.

150
00:09:41.245 --> 00:09:45.759
So there might be some audiences that
maybe your offering isn't quite as

151
00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:49.575
compelling, but
nobody else is addressing that anyway.

152
00:09:49.575 --> 00:09:52.375
So it might be worth
considering a little bit more.

153
00:09:53.545 --> 00:09:55.085
Then there's product fit.

154
00:09:55.085 --> 00:09:59.977
Does your product features benefits and
user experience align with

155
00:09:59.977 --> 00:10:04.366
the the target audience's preferences and
requirements?

156
00:10:04.366 --> 00:10:05.796
Then there's adaptability.

157
00:10:05.796 --> 00:10:07.885
How adaptable will your product be for

158
00:10:07.885 --> 00:10:11.706
changes in what that audience
might need over time?

159
00:10:11.706 --> 00:10:13.946
Then of course there's
competitive landscape.

160
00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:19.363
How well does the competition meet
the needs, saturation in the market?

161
00:10:19.363 --> 00:10:22.343
How entrenched
are the existing competitors?

162
00:10:22.343 --> 00:10:26.399
So I look at that as well, and if it's
an over-saturated market with a lot of,

163
00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:28.873
it's gonna be hard to do, demote it.

164
00:10:28.873 --> 00:10:29.633
Don't wanna look at it.

165
00:10:30.833 --> 00:10:32.743
There's buying power, right?

166
00:10:32.743 --> 00:10:35.630
Can these people actually afford your app,

167
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:39.198
cuz why are you wasting
your time otherwise?

168
00:10:39.198 --> 00:10:42.039
And do they have the power
to make the purchase or

169
00:10:42.039 --> 00:10:46.528
is there another audience that is
influencing that purchasing decision.

170
00:10:48.418 --> 00:10:53.441
I do also think about things like
lifetime value, profitability for

171
00:10:53.441 --> 00:10:59.118
example, how much profit am I likely
to be able to make off this audience?

172
00:10:59.118 --> 00:11:01.938
Am I gonna have to keep it really cheap
for them to be able to afford it?

173
00:11:01.938 --> 00:11:04.748
So my margins are gonna be lower.

174
00:11:04.748 --> 00:11:08.158
How loyal are they likely to be to me?

175
00:11:08.158 --> 00:11:13.808
All of this is guesswork, right, but
it's just thinking through these things.

176
00:11:13.808 --> 00:11:16.911
And you can look at accessibility as well.

177
00:11:16.911 --> 00:11:19.135
Can you reach this audience?

178
00:11:19.135 --> 00:11:22.496
Are you gonna be able to get at them or
are they gonna be really hard to get at?

179
00:11:22.496 --> 00:11:26.516
And that actually is a really important
one that we will come on to later.

180
00:11:26.516 --> 00:11:28.093
And engagement,

181
00:11:28.093 --> 00:11:33.776
how willing is that audience gonna
be to engage with your brand?

182
00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:35.099
Are they gonna want to talk to you?

183
00:11:35.099 --> 00:11:38.771
And then sometimes you need to
think about regulatory stuff,

184
00:11:38.771 --> 00:11:43.234
which if you're working in the B2B sector,
are there compliance rules?

185
00:11:43.234 --> 00:11:48.222
That means that developing it for this
audience are gonna be a pain in the butt.

186
00:11:48.222 --> 00:11:53.094
For example, if you wanted to create
a banking app, right, do I really wanna be

187
00:11:53.094 --> 00:11:57.556
dealing with the banking sector and
all of the crap that comes with that?

188
00:11:58.686 --> 00:12:04.344
And some of these, obviously, that can
result in a very high barrier to entry

189
00:12:04.344 --> 00:12:10.106
because you gotta have certification and
regulation and blah, blah, blah.

190
00:12:10.106 --> 00:12:12.390
You also need to think about cultural fit.

191
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.888
It's a bit of an abstract thing, but
do you understand the values and

192
00:12:15.888 --> 00:12:18.672
preferences of the audience
you're trying to reach?

193
00:12:18.672 --> 00:12:22.005
Can you effectively communicate with them?

194
00:12:22.005 --> 00:12:24.647
I know that I'm very hip and trendy, but

195
00:12:24.647 --> 00:12:29.393
there are certain audiences that I
wouldn't be able to communicate very

196
00:12:29.393 --> 00:12:33.955
well with because I don't have
any shared values with them.

197
00:12:33.955 --> 00:12:37.915
And if I'm not intending
to hire a lot of staff or

198
00:12:37.915 --> 00:12:43.069
whatever else, I'll probably
wanna avoid them as a market.

199
00:12:44.089 --> 00:12:47.701
And then language and localization.

200
00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:52.219
Do I understand the culture
of the country?

201
00:12:52.219 --> 00:12:54.699
Do I know its languages, etc?

202
00:12:55.859 --> 00:13:00.298
We mentioned technical savviness already,
users proficiency in that.

203
00:13:00.298 --> 00:13:03.018
If they might struggle with your app,

204
00:13:03.018 --> 00:13:07.598
then we're gonna have to do
a lot of support and education.

205
00:13:07.598 --> 00:13:10.558
Do I wanna spend the time doing
all of that, blah, blah, blah?

206
00:13:11.948 --> 00:13:17.148
Now, not all of those things are equal.

207
00:13:17.148 --> 00:13:18.161
It's messy.

208
00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:21.881
I'd love to say, right, okay, first of
all, you're a prioritized audience and

209
00:13:21.881 --> 00:13:23.793
then you do this, and
then you do that, and

210
00:13:23.793 --> 00:13:25.564
now you end up with a prioritized list.

211
00:13:25.564 --> 00:13:29.813
And it's all very one step,
two step, three step, right?

212
00:13:29.813 --> 00:13:35.250
Unfortunately in the kind of world I
operate in, things are messier than that,

213
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:39.160
but have a go with those criteria
in the back of your mind.

214
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.754
Go with a gut reaction based on what
you've learned from your competitive

215
00:13:43.754 --> 00:13:47.088
analysis and
the research that you've done online,

216
00:13:47.088 --> 00:13:51.737
just write yourself a prioritized
list of what feels right, right?

217
00:13:51.737 --> 00:13:54.577
And that's better than nothing,
[LAUGH] okay?

218
00:13:54.577 --> 00:13:57.701
It's better than just kind
of picking one at random.
