1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.306
So once we've kind of decided,
okay, which of those four or all

2
00:00:04.306 --> 00:00:09.211
of those four we're gonna use, whatever
combination of different calls to action,

3
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:13.180
we've got a calls to action, so
the next big problem we got is price.

4
00:00:14.228 --> 00:00:20.170
Boy, this is a tricky one, so
let's run through some of the options

5
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.881
that are maybe available to you,
there's the freemium option, okay?

6
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:32.432
So you provide a free basic piece of
software with the option to upgrade or

7
00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:34.531
add additional features.

8
00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:40.967
Benefits, great for user acquisition
as it reduces the barrier to entry and

9
00:00:40.967 --> 00:00:43.842
lets you build a big
user base very quickly.

10
00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:50.517
Challenge, getting those people
to then become paying customers,

11
00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:55.638
and there could be obviously a big
overhead potentially to support

12
00:00:55.638 --> 00:01:01.166
those free customers and
without you making any money out of them.

13
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.900
So, freemium has got its
place without a doubt, but

14
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.276
it does come with its challenges.

15
00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:11.124
The subscription model is basically
a reoccurring fee, either annually or

16
00:01:11.124 --> 00:01:15.745
monthly, often tied in with tiered
pricing based on features, users,

17
00:01:15.745 --> 00:01:17.876
usage limits, etc.

18
00:01:17.876 --> 00:01:20.371
Benefits, as Mark said earlier,

19
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:26.122
predictable revenue that can scale
with the size of the your business.

20
00:01:26.122 --> 00:01:29.797
And it also encourages you to
commit to ongoing development and

21
00:01:29.797 --> 00:01:32.242
support which is a good thing.

22
00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:39.528
The challenges is that it can cause
problems with expectations and

23
00:01:39.528 --> 00:01:47.367
billing and unexpected billing and
unpredictable elements to it.

24
00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:50.937
So I don't know, let me give you
a good real example of this, Figma,

25
00:01:50.937 --> 00:01:53.958
has anybody ever found themselves
paying both monthly and

26
00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:58.357
annually because they've accidentally
added an extra person, an extra seat?

27
00:01:58.357 --> 00:02:02.180
I seem to do it all the time,
everybody's looking at me blankly,

28
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.811
obviously it's just me,
I'll shut up and move on now [LAUGH].

29
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:11.481
Then there's usage-based,
I feel silly now, charging based on usage,

30
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:16.019
pay-as-you-go models,
you know the kind of thing.

31
00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.252
Benefits, fair to users since
they're only paying for

32
00:02:19.252 --> 00:02:23.102
what they actually use,
can be a really strong selling point, and

33
00:02:23.102 --> 00:02:27.923
there is a direct relationship between
the cost and the value received.

34
00:02:27.923 --> 00:02:35.343
Challenges is that you have to continue to
provide value or you will see a big churn.

35
00:02:36.613 --> 00:02:41.277
And it can be important to have
clear tier differentiation and

36
00:02:41.277 --> 00:02:46.839
manage your features really well,
otherwise people don't necessarily

37
00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:52.148
see the value in going for the posture
service and moving up the chain.

38
00:02:53.838 --> 00:02:58.859
Per-User charging, this is often
used in B2B products quite a lot,

39
00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.838
easy for your customers to understand and

40
00:03:01.838 --> 00:03:06.868
scale well with the size of
the customers team, which works great.

41
00:03:06.868 --> 00:03:10.703
Bigger companies pay more,
it seems, works really well,

42
00:03:10.703 --> 00:03:15.920
it can discourage adoption within larger
teams because they don't wanna pay for

43
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.928
lots of different seats of it.

44
00:03:17.928 --> 00:03:21.466
And it can lead to things like account
sharing which reduces security and

45
00:03:21.466 --> 00:03:22.889
those kinds of stuff.

46
00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.815
Then there's feature-based, there's so
many ways of splitting this on there,

47
00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:29.209
more than you think, right?

48
00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.718
So, you pay for different features at
different levels and this is great cuz it

49
00:03:33.718 --> 00:03:38.449
allows customers to pick a plan that
fits their needs and their budget.

50
00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:42.849
But it has got the downside of it, can be
tricky to see how the tiers are different

51
00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.395
from one another and you risk
overwhelming users with too many choices.

52
00:03:47.395 --> 00:03:51.842
And then of course, there's a hybrid
of all of the above basically,

53
00:03:51.842 --> 00:03:56.292
where you can combine elements from
different ways of doing things,

54
00:03:56.292 --> 00:04:00.452
which is super flexible, but
can be difficult to communicate.

55
00:04:01.713 --> 00:04:05.975
So those are all the different types
of packaging, but I haven't answered

56
00:04:05.975 --> 00:04:10.033
the question well, how do you decide
on how much to actually charge?

57
00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:14.137
And obviously,
I can't give you a solid formula for

58
00:04:14.137 --> 00:04:19.172
that cuz I don't know what your
product is or anything else, but

59
00:04:19.172 --> 00:04:24.904
I can give you the factors that I
use to influence that decision.

60
00:04:24.904 --> 00:04:29.269
The audience, how much people are actually
willing to pay, [LAUGH] no-brainer,

61
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.844
really, that one.

62
00:04:30.844 --> 00:04:33.468
The competition,
what the competition charges and

63
00:04:33.468 --> 00:04:37.234
how they structure their pricing plans,
I often use that to influence me.

64
00:04:38.534 --> 00:04:43.282
Flexibility, does your pricing allow
enough flexibility to offer discounts or

65
00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:45.128
changes over time?

66
00:04:45.128 --> 00:04:51.600
So a regular thing that you see happen is
that people underprice the competitors and

67
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.484
then they've got very
little wiggle room to do a,

68
00:04:55.484 --> 00:05:00.810
I don't know, a Cyber Monday discount or
whatever else.

69
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.974
That can be very valuable in scenarios or

70
00:05:03.974 --> 00:05:08.060
offer a student discount or
things like that.

71
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.001
So you wanna leave enough legroom in your
pricing to be able to do some discounting

72
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:14.780
or to adapt over time.

73
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.688
Cuz it's a lot easier
to offer a discount and

74
00:05:17.688 --> 00:05:22.088
lower your prices at specific times
than it is to say, hey, guys,

75
00:05:22.088 --> 00:05:26.899
we're gonna charge more now,
things go bad at that point very quickly.

76
00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:33.759
And then, of course, there's costs,
will your price cover your cost?

77
00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:35.220
Shocking thing to consider, but

78
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.629
yes, you definitely need to
think about that as well.

79
00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:41.124
So, what your call to action is,

80
00:05:41.124 --> 00:05:45.361
you're gonna have a crack at a certain
pricing structure, and again,

81
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:50.307
you could run multiple different pricing
structures on different landing pages,

82
00:05:50.307 --> 00:05:54.707
either all at the same time or run one
campaign and then run another, etc.
