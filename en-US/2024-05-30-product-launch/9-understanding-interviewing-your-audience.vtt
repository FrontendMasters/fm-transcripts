1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.778
So we do need to dig a little bit
deeper into our audience once we've

2
00:00:03.778 --> 00:00:06.558
picked it even deeper
than we've already gone.

3
00:00:06.558 --> 00:00:08.830
I know we've looked quite
a lot at our audience, but

4
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.167
there's more that we wanna
know about our audience.

5
00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:12.719
So what is useful to know?

6
00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.082
Well, basically we wanna know
about their questions, right?

7
00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:19.018
What questions do they need answering?

8
00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:21.710
What questions would they likely
have around your product or

9
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.195
service that you're offering?

10
00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:27.949
What objections might they have
that would prevent them from

11
00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.936
actually giving your product to try?

12
00:00:30.936 --> 00:00:33.232
Why might they not wanna do it?

13
00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:34.169
Well, their goals?

14
00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:37.860
What do they ultimately wanna
achieve with your product?

15
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.687
What tasks are they trying to complete
using your product or service?

16
00:00:42.687 --> 00:00:45.010
What's their state of mind?

17
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.061
When they're using it,
what emotional journey are they going on?

18
00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:52.738
That all sounds a bit tree huggy,
I know, but

19
00:00:52.738 --> 00:00:55.639
it will affect how you
communicate with people.

20
00:00:55.639 --> 00:01:00.072
If somebody, for example,
if you're creating a fitness app,

21
00:01:00.072 --> 00:01:03.041
a fitness app has good times and
bad times.

22
00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:07.161
There are times when you achieve your goal
and lose your weight or whatever it is,

23
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:08.993
and you wanna celebrate with them.

24
00:01:08.993 --> 00:01:11.634
And there are other times when it's
blooming tough and you don't wanna do it.

25
00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:13.924
And your app needs to encourage them.

26
00:01:13.924 --> 00:01:17.704
So knowing someone's state
of mind is important.

27
00:01:17.704 --> 00:01:19.297
What influences them?

28
00:01:19.297 --> 00:01:22.355
Influencing their experience and
whether or

29
00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:26.950
not they might use your app, and
what challenge and it gets cut off.

30
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.136
What challenges are they facing?

31
00:01:29.136 --> 00:01:33.316
What pain points might they have using
the app that would put them off?

32
00:01:33.316 --> 00:01:38.518
So some things are more important
than others, so there's the stuff

33
00:01:38.518 --> 00:01:43.462
on the left Is the kind of primary
things we need to be focusing on.

34
00:01:43.462 --> 00:01:47.044
The stuff on the right is
maybe a bit more secondary.

35
00:01:47.044 --> 00:01:51.495
But really, we've got to kind of also
think about the touch points and

36
00:01:51.495 --> 00:01:55.872
interactions that we could be having
with our audience through all of

37
00:01:55.872 --> 00:02:00.260
these different platforms and
all these different opportunities.

38
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.010
How do they like to communicate?

39
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.693
How do they want us to interact with them?

40
00:02:04.693 --> 00:02:09.259
Because that will affect what kind of
marketing we do and how we approach it.

41
00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.363
So all of this we just
do some online research.

42
00:02:11.363 --> 00:02:15.765
Again, it's back to looking at
communities, it's back to reading related

43
00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:20.116
blogs, doing SEO research,
existing reports, looking at social media.

44
00:02:20.116 --> 00:02:24.220
How I even ask AI sometimes
about these things.

45
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.900
AI's are remarkably good at brainstorming
ideas so it can get you going.

46
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.682
But to be honest, by this stage,

47
00:02:30.682 --> 00:02:34.006
you probably got a fairly good
handle on a lot of these things.

48
00:02:34.006 --> 00:02:42.024
I talked earlier about identifying gaps
tonight in order to position our product.

49
00:02:42.024 --> 00:02:47.030
Well, now that we've gone
through this process and

50
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.882
gathered this information.

51
00:02:49.882 --> 00:02:53.013
We can also look for
gaps in what we know about users,

52
00:02:53.013 --> 00:02:57.854
in all of this research that we've done
is that, is there missing information or

53
00:02:57.854 --> 00:03:01.152
the things that we don't know or
we're unsure about?

54
00:03:01.152 --> 00:03:05.708
Some of the stuff that we've learned
about users a bit old and out of date or

55
00:03:05.708 --> 00:03:08.295
the stuff that we don't really believe.

56
00:03:08.295 --> 00:03:12.209
Because if we're feeling
unsure about our audience and

57
00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.539
we don't feel like we've got
a full picture of who they are and

58
00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:20.714
what we want, then we might
wanna do some surveys, right?

59
00:03:20.714 --> 00:03:25.290
Doesn't need to be rocket science,
but surveys are an excellent way of

60
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.266
finding out any specific information
that we wanna know about our audience.

61
00:03:30.266 --> 00:03:33.476
What would they likely use a task app for?

62
00:03:33.476 --> 00:03:35.555
What are they using currently?

63
00:03:35.555 --> 00:03:38.691
There's all kinds of
questions that we could ask.

64
00:03:38.691 --> 00:03:41.941
And there are some great services out
there, right, to do that kind of thing.

65
00:03:41.941 --> 00:03:46.917
So one that I talk a lot about this
in my course on user research and

66
00:03:46.917 --> 00:03:51.818
testing, but one that I particularly
that is called PogFish.

67
00:03:51.818 --> 00:03:55.869
Because they can even do
the recruitment of the audience for me.

68
00:03:55.869 --> 00:04:00.661
It's also worth if you do run
a survey have a final question that's

69
00:04:00.661 --> 00:04:02.637
says something like that.

70
00:04:02.637 --> 00:04:07.451
Would you be interested in doing
a follow up interview and ask them for

71
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:13.012
their email address if they would, because
then we can maybe do an interview and

72
00:04:13.012 --> 00:04:16.005
get to know some of
these people a bit more.

73
00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:19.658
This all feels like a lot of
work I know and do as much or

74
00:04:19.658 --> 00:04:25.142
as little as you feel inclined to do,
but it really is invaluable to actually,

75
00:04:25.142 --> 00:04:29.407
now you've picked your audience
to really get to know them.

76
00:04:29.407 --> 00:04:33.594
And I, in particular, for
example, love to do just two or

77
00:04:33.594 --> 00:04:37.952
three interviews with people
because it means when I sit down

78
00:04:37.952 --> 00:04:42.746
to write some copy that tries to
persuade them to sign up to the app.

79
00:04:42.746 --> 00:04:47.659
Or if I write maybe a blog
post that's supposed to appeal

80
00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:52.258
to this audience,
I can picture Janice or Nigel, or

81
00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:57.817
whoever in my head as I write and
that just makes it a lot easier.

82
00:04:57.817 --> 00:05:03.037
In terms of what kind of things that's
It's worth asking in these interviews and

83
00:05:03.037 --> 00:05:05.876
surveys if you want a bit
more of insights and

84
00:05:05.876 --> 00:05:10.582
things that might be missing from any
research that you did previously.

85
00:05:10.582 --> 00:05:14.235
I often ask people about their
background and their context.

86
00:05:14.235 --> 00:05:16.323
What are their pain points?

87
00:05:16.323 --> 00:05:17.753
What their goals?

88
00:05:17.753 --> 00:05:21.901
I ask them how they might use
any service that I create, or

89
00:05:21.901 --> 00:05:27.953
if they use one of the competitors, what
kind of challenges they might encounter or

90
00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:30.643
have encountered using those apps.

91
00:05:30.643 --> 00:05:33.536
I talk to them about needs and
opportunities,

92
00:05:33.536 --> 00:05:38.210
how satisfied they are with competitor
services that they're using, and

93
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.634
how they would like to see
those competitors improve.

94
00:05:41.634 --> 00:05:44.449
And also encourage open-ended feedback,

95
00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.545
where if there's anything that they wanna
talk about relating to the product or

96
00:05:49.545 --> 00:05:54.507
service that you're creating, get them
to share their thoughts and ideas.

97
00:05:54.507 --> 00:05:58.911
So I tend to pull these things
together into some kind of persona or

98
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:02.275
empathy map where I can then
refer to it quickly as I

99
00:06:02.275 --> 00:06:05.415
start doing other things
during the project.

100
00:06:05.415 --> 00:06:10.214
So I'll write that questions and
tasks on the persona and their pain points

101
00:06:10.214 --> 00:06:15.104
that they're they might be experiencing
and what goals that they've had.

102
00:06:15.104 --> 00:06:18.932
Maybe a bit about the journey they go
on and by journey makes it sound so

103
00:06:18.932 --> 00:06:23.224
pretentious, but why they're using
the app, what they were doing before,

104
00:06:23.224 --> 00:06:24.825
what they were doing after.

105
00:06:24.825 --> 00:06:29.884
How it fits into their life,
if that makes sense,

106
00:06:29.884 --> 00:06:35.430
what influences them, and
then how they tend to feel.

107
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.782
So all of it, I mean, if you're interested
in user research an understanding

108
00:06:40.782 --> 00:06:44.931
users better, I do have an entire
course dedicated to that.

109
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:50.607
But broadly speaking, it's about
identifying as many possible audiences

110
00:06:50.607 --> 00:06:56.017
as you can initially, then shortlisting
that down into a more viable and

111
00:06:56.017 --> 00:07:00.466
manageable list that,
that actually you could work with.

112
00:07:00.466 --> 00:07:04.047
And then picking initial
target to begin with, right?

113
00:07:04.047 --> 00:07:08.986
Who is it that you wanna target at
the beginning of all of this can expand

114
00:07:08.986 --> 00:07:13.942
out from that later, but start small and
then dig into that audience.

115
00:07:13.942 --> 00:07:19.375
And the reason that you do all of that
is so that now when you sit down and

116
00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:25.653
actually stop thinking about your MVP and
what you're gonna build initially,

117
00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:29.606
you've got a framework
within which to operate.

118
00:07:29.606 --> 00:07:31.635
You know what you shouldn't do,

119
00:07:31.635 --> 00:07:35.412
because the competitors are already
doing that really well.

120
00:07:35.412 --> 00:07:38.224
You know what the competitors
are doing really badly.

121
00:07:38.224 --> 00:07:40.004
You know what users really need.

122
00:07:40.004 --> 00:07:44.054
You know how your users think, you've
got all of the pieces in the puzzle,

123
00:07:44.054 --> 00:07:48.508
rather than you just sit down and say,
right, let's start building something.

124
00:07:48.508 --> 00:07:53.528
So that's what we need to look at like,
yeah, and next is I'm not gonna

125
00:07:53.528 --> 00:07:58.814
get into how to build an MVP, you guys
know all of that a lot better than I do.

126
00:07:58.814 --> 00:08:03.126
I'm not a full time developer like many
of the people watching this would be.

127
00:08:03.126 --> 00:08:07.047
But I can give you some advice about
what needs to go into your MVP and

128
00:08:07.047 --> 00:08:08.109
how to define it.

129
00:08:08.109 --> 00:08:09.701
And so we'll look at that next.
