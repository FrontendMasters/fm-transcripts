1
00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.391
So people have hit your landing page.

2
00:00:02.391 --> 00:00:03.801
You've driven a load of
people to the landing page.

3
00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:07.340
Maybe they've pre-ordered, maybe they've
signed up for a mailing list, whatever.

4
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.836
But you now know who these people are and
you wanna nurture them a bit.

5
00:00:11.836 --> 00:00:14.088
We wanna get them excited,
we wanna get them on board.

6
00:00:14.088 --> 00:00:16.436
So when we actually
wanna take their money,

7
00:00:16.436 --> 00:00:18.978
they still are willing to give it to us,
right?

8
00:00:18.978 --> 00:00:20.930
Now from running campaign in itself,

9
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.017
we're gonna have learned loads of things
about our audience who might have done

10
00:00:25.017 --> 00:00:28.928
multiple versions of the campaign with
slightly different landing pages.

11
00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:32.111
With different calls to action,
with different pricing.

12
00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:36.057
We can fiddle around with that as
much as we want to or otherwise.

13
00:00:36.057 --> 00:00:41.205
All the time we're doing those tests,
not only are we learning about

14
00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:46.995
what we'll work to build, but
we're also building up an audience, right?

15
00:00:46.995 --> 00:00:49.663
And we don't wanna loose that audience and

16
00:00:49.663 --> 00:00:53.228
we'll lose them if their
emails just sit there, right?

17
00:00:53.228 --> 00:00:56.276
How many times, I don't know,
I sign up for stuff, I'm like you,

18
00:00:56.276 --> 00:00:59.074
I'm an early adopter, so
I'll sign up for any old wet maids.

19
00:00:59.074 --> 00:01:01.191
And then I get this email through, say,

20
00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:03.630
you'll be excited to
hear we've launched X.

21
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.286
And I'm going X, X.

22
00:01:06.286 --> 00:01:07.582
What was that?

23
00:01:07.582 --> 00:01:09.390
Yeah, did I sign up for that?

24
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.754
I don't think I signed up for
that spam, right?

25
00:01:12.754 --> 00:01:14.205
I mean that's useless.

26
00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:17.057
You've got to nurture people you've
got to hear from you regularly.

27
00:01:17.057 --> 00:01:19.913
So, this is why I do.

28
00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:25.458
When people first sign up, I put them on
what I call an on boarding email series.

29
00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:30.098
So I plan a series of emails over
a number of weeks that talk them

30
00:01:30.098 --> 00:01:35.007
through the features and
the benefits that they will receive, or

31
00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:37.969
even go a little bit broader than that.

32
00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.777
You have a series of emails over
a series of weeks just to kind of get

33
00:01:41.777 --> 00:01:45.602
them on board, get them thinking,
get them a bit enthusiastic.

34
00:01:45.602 --> 00:01:47.885
Then after that, right?

35
00:01:47.885 --> 00:01:51.749
Because you might not necessarily
build the whole app in a few weeks,

36
00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:53.089
you're probably not.

37
00:01:53.089 --> 00:01:55.682
I expect you've got months
of work ahead of you.

38
00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:59.639
So once a month or so,
I would drop them an email,

39
00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:05.339
basically with a progress update IT
trying to keep them excited try and

40
00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:11.159
keep them engaged, talking about
the development, progress, etc.

41
00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:15.193
And what I tend to encourage in
those is a bit of feedback as well.

42
00:02:15.193 --> 00:02:17.744
Why don't you write me tell
me about your story and

43
00:02:17.744 --> 00:02:19.700
the challenges you've been facing?

44
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.699
Maybe you want to suggest to the feature,
right?

45
00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:28.113
And create a place where users can
submit ideas that they want to see in

46
00:02:28.113 --> 00:02:30.864
the application and vote them up and down.

47
00:02:30.864 --> 00:02:33.636
And we can use that poll
unit that we used for

48
00:02:33.636 --> 00:02:37.969
the top task analysis earlier to
collect those features, right?

49
00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.781
So that makes people feel kind of engaged.

50
00:02:40.781 --> 00:02:44.081
And then when the product maybe
is in a bit of a better place,

51
00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:46.859
then you can give them some early access,
right?

52
00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:51.259
You can encourage those on
the mailing list to use the app for

53
00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:55.395
free for a while to a,
get them hooked, hopefully, b,

54
00:02:55.395 --> 00:03:00.147
to get some useful feedback and
c, to encourage them interest.

55
00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:05.994
So there's lots of opportunities there as
well to really nurture that audience and

56
00:03:05.994 --> 00:03:07.255
make use of them.

57
00:03:07.255 --> 00:03:10.386
And that's basically it in terms
of that kinda test campaign.

58
00:03:10.386 --> 00:03:14.048
But that test campaign is by far
the most powerful thing, in some ways,

59
00:03:14.048 --> 00:03:16.195
out of everything that I've said today.

60
00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:21.183
Because it's an opportunity to
really find out whether this,

61
00:03:21.183 --> 00:03:26.181
anybody is going to buy this thing
at the end of the day, right?

62
00:03:26.181 --> 00:03:29.346
Now again, I'll go back to what
I said right at the beginning,

63
00:03:29.346 --> 00:03:32.450
if you're just doing this for fun or
is a bit of a side project or

64
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.957
to learn something, you don't need
to do any of this stuff, right?

65
00:03:35.957 --> 00:03:39.258
But if you're trying to build
a sustainable business,

66
00:03:39.258 --> 00:03:43.894
running a campaign that actually is
identifies whether or not your campaign,

67
00:03:43.894 --> 00:03:47.778
whether your product is gonna work,
is completely worth doing.

68
00:03:47.778 --> 00:03:52.430
And so, I'd encourage you if you're gonna
run a test campaign, start off by clearly

69
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.516
defining what your call to action is
going to be, what success looks like.

70
00:03:56.516 --> 00:03:57.911
Is it that pre-order?

71
00:03:57.911 --> 00:03:59.630
Is it signing up for a waiting list?

72
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.349
What is it then make the hard
decisions about price, right?

73
00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.595
And if you can't decide how to price it,
run multiple landing pages and drive

74
00:04:08.595 --> 00:04:12.929
different people at different landing
pages and see which one works the best.

75
00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:16.870
Then you build your landing pages out,
you drive traffic to them.

76
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.165
The drive traffic to them is the hard bit,

77
00:04:20.165 --> 00:04:25.060
I'll be honest with you there's
no way around it is our work,

78
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.599
and then you wanna also nurture
that audience over time.
