1
00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.058
We're all ready to go,
now we need to drive some traffic to it.

2
00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:08.165
So how do we do that?

3
00:00:08.165 --> 00:00:13.124
Well, we can start off with a bit
of community engagement, right?

4
00:00:13.124 --> 00:00:18.217
There are all those communities we talked
about where our audience hangs out.

5
00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:23.279
We can start posting on there and we can
be really honest and upfront and say,

6
00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.276
look, I'm thinking about building
this thing, love you to check it out.

7
00:00:28.276 --> 00:00:34.416
If you think it's cool, feel free to
pre-order or to join the mailing list,

8
00:00:34.416 --> 00:00:38.770
if you've got feedback, drop me an email.

9
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.768
Where you go will be somewhat
dependent on your audience,

10
00:00:43.768 --> 00:00:46.529
but those are the kinda places.

11
00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:49.948
You might be wondering, well,

12
00:00:49.948 --> 00:00:54.261
why don't I do a Product Hunt to launch?

13
00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:57.903
Because, couple of reasons.

14
00:00:57.903 --> 00:01:04.513
First of all, Product Hunt tends to favour
applications that got very broad appeal.

15
00:01:04.513 --> 00:01:08.512
There are certain types of people that
spend their lives on Product Hunt.

16
00:01:08.512 --> 00:01:14.042
And if that's not your audience is
probably not the best platform for you.

17
00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:19.197
It also doesn't address the issue of
generating traffic over the long term.

18
00:01:19.197 --> 00:01:24.630
So, give you a big spike of traffic,
because if you perform

19
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.186
well on Product Hunt,
you'll get a load of traffic from it.

20
00:01:30.186 --> 00:01:34.681
But that's not giving you any sense of
the sustainability of the business over

21
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:38.236
the long term, or whether people
will buy over the long term.

22
00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:42.366
So it's a kind of artificial thing.

23
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:45.409
I'm not saying you don't launch
on Product Hunt later, but

24
00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.527
I wouldn't run this test campaign, I would
wait till the products actually up and

25
00:01:49.527 --> 00:01:52.886
running before I consider putting
it anywhere like Product Hunt.

26
00:01:52.886 --> 00:01:55.391
So, yeah, just bear that in mind,

27
00:01:55.391 --> 00:01:59.077
it's not the time to do that
kind of thing right now.

28
00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:02.026
Now other option is Content marketing,

29
00:02:02.026 --> 00:02:06.720
I do a lot of that as a way of
drawing awareness to my landing page.

30
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.323
So there's no point of posting to
your blog cuz nobody's reading it.

31
00:02:11.323 --> 00:02:15.407
But you might wanna go and
blog on other people's sites and

32
00:02:15.407 --> 00:02:20.758
be a guest blogger, that can be an
excellent way of reaching your audience.

33
00:02:20.758 --> 00:02:25.985
So, I've blogged over the years
on all kinds of really dull blogs

34
00:02:25.985 --> 00:02:31.322
that like the institutional web
managers workshop blog, right?

35
00:02:31.322 --> 00:02:33.109
Sexy, that is, isn't it?

36
00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.583
But that was where my audience for
that particular campaign was.

37
00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:39.460
So that's where I went and blogged.

38
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.596
You go where your audience is and
contribute, and

39
00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:46.113
you talk about a subject that
surrounds whatever it is.

40
00:02:46.113 --> 00:02:50.279
The other one I do quite
a lot is podcasts.

41
00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:56.447
So, for example, appearing as a guest
on podcasts that audience is on.

42
00:02:56.447 --> 00:02:59.953
And again, it's the same principle,
you don't just go in there and

43
00:02:59.953 --> 00:03:02.252
sell the product because
nobody will care and

44
00:03:02.252 --> 00:03:05.292
they won't want you as a guest
on the podcast if you do that.

45
00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:08.593
But you can talk about some of
the pain points of your audiences and

46
00:03:08.593 --> 00:03:12.205
some of the ways they can deal with it and
how your app can help with that.

47
00:03:12.205 --> 00:03:16.811
And inevitably, a podcast host will always
say, where can people find out more

48
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:21.093
about you or something along those
lines and that's when you promote it.

49
00:03:21.093 --> 00:03:24.328
Then of course there's social.

50
00:03:24.328 --> 00:03:29.144
So, you can start posting on
social about the pain points and

51
00:03:29.144 --> 00:03:32.837
the questions and
the goals the audience has.

52
00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:38.762
And in your bio,
you link back to your landing page.

53
00:03:38.762 --> 00:03:43.698
Also, engaging with
influencers via social, right?

54
00:03:43.698 --> 00:03:46.625
Not in a, hey, will you check out my app,

55
00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:50.575
please you've no idea how many
of those I get every day.

56
00:03:50.575 --> 00:03:51.395
And I'm a,

57
00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:56.659
probably the worst influencer that you
can get out there in terms of status.

58
00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.459
But what you're doing is you build a big,

59
00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.908
to build a relationship
with some of those people.

60
00:04:02.908 --> 00:04:07.921
And don't go, I'm not talking
about massive influences here.

61
00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:11.238
I'm talking about influencers
with a small lie.

62
00:04:11.238 --> 00:04:17.853
There are key people in an industry who
aren't necessarily doing TikTok right?

63
00:04:17.853 --> 00:04:22.700
But are key people that a lot of people
know and chat with and stuff like that.

64
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:29.165
So, I remember once I was working
on a higher education campaign.

65
00:04:29.165 --> 00:04:33.448
And you remember I mentioned
institutional web managers workshop.

66
00:04:33.448 --> 00:04:36.967
Well, that was run by a guy called Brian,
right?

67
00:04:36.967 --> 00:04:41.502
And Brian just ran that mailing list,
but everybody knew Brian, right?

68
00:04:41.502 --> 00:04:47.288
And Brian was at every event, he was
always very chatty, everybody liked Brian.

69
00:04:47.288 --> 00:04:51.313
I became friends with Brian and
Brian ended up promoting my stuff.

70
00:04:51.313 --> 00:04:54.359
Now, would you call Brian an influencer?

71
00:04:54.359 --> 00:04:58.578
Well, he is, but he's not an influencer
with a big eye, so look for

72
00:04:58.578 --> 00:05:00.069
those kinds of people.

73
00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:02.369
The Brain's of this world, right?

74
00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:05.842
They don't get enough love
the Brian's of this world.

75
00:05:05.842 --> 00:05:09.542
So social is another and
then of course there's paid acquisition.

76
00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:13.488
So, you might want to put
a bit of money into it,

77
00:05:13.488 --> 00:05:16.943
doesn't need to be a lot, few $100,

78
00:05:16.943 --> 00:05:23.063
if you can afford it even less if you
can't just to put out some paid posts,

79
00:05:23.063 --> 00:05:28.627
maybe some sponsored posts on
certain well-regarded websites.

80
00:05:28.627 --> 00:05:33.203
Probably not as high on the agenda for
me, I would prefer to pay some money,

81
00:05:33.203 --> 00:05:37.273
maybe for some pay per click
advertising where I'm only paying for

82
00:05:37.273 --> 00:05:40.053
click-throughs on relevant search terms.

83
00:05:40.053 --> 00:05:41.882
Or maybe some social ads.

84
00:05:41.882 --> 00:05:46.488
But you gotta start thinking
about how are you going to be

85
00:05:46.488 --> 00:05:49.431
regularly driving your audience.

86
00:05:49.431 --> 00:05:51.651
And if you can't drive
them to the landing page,

87
00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:55.027
you're not gonna be able to drive them
to the product at the end of the day.

88
00:05:55.027 --> 00:05:59.875
So the key, you're gonna start
thinking about your ongoing

89
00:05:59.875 --> 00:06:05.493
marketing strategy and that landing
page is a test scenario for that.

90
00:06:05.493 --> 00:06:09.910
But it does all basically come
down to either organic or

91
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.808
paid acquisition and
is either kind of content marketing and

92
00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:19.240
getting out there where your
audience is or it's ads.

93
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.479
Those your two choices in a nutshell.

94
00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:28.355
Over time you can get more sophisticated,
for example, Frontend Master, they

95
00:06:28.355 --> 00:06:33.245
don't need to advertise to a lot of places
because they've built their name up.

96
00:06:33.245 --> 00:06:39.567
They've got podcast and they've got a blog
which you've got a good readership already

97
00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:44.795
so that, people are coming to them
rather than them going out to people.

98
00:06:44.795 --> 00:06:48.059
But you're not gonna have the luxury
of that to be in with, so

99
00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:50.503
you gonna have to go
where your audience are.

100
00:06:50.503 --> 00:06:54.371
So there's a lot of
legwork involved in that,

101
00:06:54.371 --> 00:06:58.348
and that's the thing
that most people forget.

102
00:06:58.348 --> 00:07:01.265
The marketing will take a vast
majority of your effort.

103
00:07:01.265 --> 00:07:04.675
I mean, I know lots of app owners and

104
00:07:04.675 --> 00:07:09.111
they spend most of their
time going to events,

105
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:13.003
going on podcasts, that kind of thing.

106
00:07:13.003 --> 00:07:14.609
So it's a big part of the job.
