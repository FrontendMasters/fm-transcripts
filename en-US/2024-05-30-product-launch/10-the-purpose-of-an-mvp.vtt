00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.934
So why is it really important that you
think in terms of a minimal viable product

2
00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:10.168
rather than, let's build everything,
let's get really excited and go off in all

3
00:00:10.168 --> 00:00:15.372
directions, well, doing a minimal viable
product will help define your scope.

4
00:00:15.372 --> 00:00:18.452
It prevents you from the build
dragging on forever and

5
00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:20.446
you never actually finishing it.

6
00:00:20.446 --> 00:00:24.564
Side projects are the worst for
this, right?

7
00:00:24.564 --> 00:00:28.596
Because there's no, especially if you
are used to working in a company with

8
00:00:28.596 --> 00:00:31.242
a boss or
if you're used to working with clients,

9
00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:34.272
the minute you sit down to
work on your own thing, right?

10
00:00:34.272 --> 00:00:37.201
Where there's no boss
telling you what to do, and

11
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:41.054
there's no client with a deadline,
you tend to fiddle, right?

12
00:00:41.054 --> 00:00:45.218
And you fiddle with it for ages and
you keep adding things to it and

13
00:00:45.218 --> 00:00:49.941
it loses any kind of scope and it drags
on and you never finish it, right?

14
00:00:49.941 --> 00:00:53.630
So it's the worst thing that can happen,
so by sitting down and

15
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.798
going right what's my MVP gonna be?

16
00:00:55.798 --> 00:00:59.364
Let's define it up front before
I start doing anything and

17
00:00:59.364 --> 00:01:04.186
then that is what I'm gonna build and
I'm not gonna get distracted from that.

18
00:01:04.186 --> 00:01:07.854
Things will progress
a lot faster as a result.

19
00:01:07.854 --> 00:01:09.008
So it defines your scope.

20
00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:10.833
It also reduces your costs.

21
00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:13.425
And your costs might be just your time,
but

22
00:01:13.425 --> 00:01:17.542
let's not build a load of stuff
that we don't need to, initially.

23
00:01:17.542 --> 00:01:19.840
Let's just keep it nice and focused.

24
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.470
And also having an MVP, and
knowing what your MVP is,

25
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.561
will allow you to launch faster and
with a better defined target audience.

26
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:33.514
And even the act of defining your MVP,
is gonna allow us to run

27
00:01:33.514 --> 00:01:38.002
a test marketing campaign
before you build anything.

28
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:43.457
So it might be, that if it'll prove
whether your marketing is working or not.

29
00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:46.486
And it will potentially
save you a lot of time and

30
00:01:46.486 --> 00:01:49.817
a lot hassle,
if it turns out it's not working, and

31
00:01:49.817 --> 00:01:55.304
you haven't built [LAUGH] the whole thing
only to discover it's not working, right?

32
00:01:55.304 --> 00:02:01.886
So, steps in defining an MVP, or at least
the steps I use in defining an MVP.

33
00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:05.371
First of all, I brainstorm as many
possible tasks and features and

34
00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:07.310
things that my audience might want.

35
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.047
I then identify which of those things most
matters to the audience with top task

36
00:02:12.047 --> 00:02:15.277
analysis, and
if you've watched my other courses,

37
00:02:15.277 --> 00:02:19.255
you're sick of me talking about
top task analysis at this stage.

38
00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:23.952
And then,
we're also gonna plan our launch features.

39
00:02:23.952 --> 00:02:26.743
So, what is out of all of
those things we could do,

40
00:02:26.743 --> 00:02:29.077
we're actually gonna launch with Mark.

41
00:02:29.077 --> 00:02:33.172
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just wanted to say,
a lot of times developers,

42
00:02:33.172 --> 00:02:35.711
myself included, thought okay.

43
00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:38.171
Building the product is
actually the thing, but no,

44
00:02:38.171 --> 00:02:40.203
building the product is the starting line.

45
00:02:40.203 --> 00:02:41.068
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

46
00:02:41.068 --> 00:02:47.007
&gt;&gt; And my shaping it around
the customer's actual needs is the actual,

47
00:02:47.007 --> 00:02:47.761
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

48
00:02:47.761 --> 00:02:48.613
&gt;&gt; Journey.

49
00:02:48.613 --> 00:02:53.538
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and what I'm trying to do here
is kind of maybe condense that a little

50
00:02:53.538 --> 00:02:58.147
bit and go instead of going through
the pain of building the product and

51
00:02:58.147 --> 00:03:00.119
then shaping it to the needs.

52
00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:04.944
If we've taken the time to understand
the needs a little bit more earlier,

53
00:03:04.944 --> 00:03:09.934
then it can be more shaped earlier on and
save yourself a little bit of hassle.

54
00:03:09.934 --> 00:03:12.044
It's always gonna need to
be shaped post launch,

55
00:03:12.044 --> 00:03:13.760
there's nothing you can do about that.

56
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.565
But the closer you can get it out of the
gate, the more time you ultimately save,

57
00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:20.376
but you're entirely right.

58
00:03:20.376 --> 00:03:25.871
It's very easy to get seduced into this
attitude of all I need to do is build it,

59
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:26.468
right?

60
00:03:26.468 --> 00:03:33.212
And that is such a tiny part of having
a successful startup or business.

61
00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:38.885
&gt;&gt; And the other thing is, if you give
a thousand people the exact same MVP,

62
00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:45.405
they'll probably come up with a thousand
different products at the end of the day.

63
00:03:45.405 --> 00:03:46.605
&gt;&gt; Yes.

64
00:03:46.605 --> 00:03:48.610
&gt;&gt; So, making it real as possible.

65
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.057
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like as soon as possible.

66
00:03:50.057 --> 00:03:52.481
&gt;&gt; Yeah
&gt;&gt; Becomes incredibly important.

67
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:56.931
&gt;&gt; And a lot of that is around
being extremely focused about who

68
00:03:56.931 --> 00:04:01.925
you're aiming at, and
the shape of that thing you're creating.

69
00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:07.400
And so one of the things I'm gonna talk
about is, everything in you will cry,

70
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.373
let's start coding something,
you're better off doing a little bit

71
00:04:12.373 --> 00:04:17.707
prototyping first, because that helps
give the shape to it that you need.

72
00:04:17.707 --> 00:04:22.041
So, I start with brainstorming
possible tasks and

73
00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:26.994
I just go for it,
everything that I could possibly think.

74
00:04:26.994 --> 00:04:30.290
Only for the initial target audience,
I don't go off and

75
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.184
start thinking what other
audiences would like.

76
00:04:33.184 --> 00:04:37.796
But in that existing target
audience that we're aiming for,

77
00:04:37.796 --> 00:04:40.555
just as many things as I can think of.

78
00:04:40.555 --> 00:04:43.733
And I look at the competition,
what's there,

79
00:04:43.733 --> 00:04:48.034
what tasks the competitors support,
all those get listed out.

80
00:04:48.034 --> 00:04:52.095
What they've got coming up soon that
I think is relevant to my audience,

81
00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:53.970
that all goes on the list as well.

82
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.387
What they've missed that I
think my audience really wants,

83
00:04:57.387 --> 00:04:59.069
that goes on the list as well.

84
00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:02.879
Also lemme refer back to that
user research that I've created,

85
00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:05.427
what have users requested that they want?

86
00:05:05.427 --> 00:05:11.252
What pain, what tasks could address
a pain point that the user want?

87
00:05:11.252 --> 00:05:15.902
What tasks could help a user
complete the goals that they want?

88
00:05:15.902 --> 00:05:20.885
And just keep putting them many out, get
them out of your head as many as you can.

89
00:05:20.885 --> 00:05:23.294
And then, don't stop there.

90
00:05:23.294 --> 00:05:27.289
And then move across into AI,
the large language model.

91
00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.472
And write something like,
I'm trying to build a SAS app for

92
00:05:31.472 --> 00:05:33.406
that enables them to goal.

93
00:05:33.406 --> 00:05:37.792
So far I've identified the following tasks
users will need to complete and I copy and

94
00:05:37.792 --> 00:05:39.042
paste my list in there.

95
00:05:39.042 --> 00:05:39.926
And then I say,

96
00:05:39.926 --> 00:05:44.482
what other tasks should I be adding to
this application to help people, right?

97
00:05:44.482 --> 00:05:47.085
And then it all suggests a load more and
some of them you'll go, no,

98
00:05:47.085 --> 00:05:48.469
that's rubbish, that's silly.

99
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:50.381
But there'll be some
nuggets in there as well.

100
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:52.521
So you add those in there, right?

101
00:05:52.521 --> 00:05:54.755
Get as many in there as you can.

102
00:05:54.755 --> 00:06:00.242
The truth is that about 20% of any
features that you create in your app,

103
00:06:00.242 --> 00:06:03.074
will be the 20% that something like

104
00:06:03.074 --> 00:06:07.606
80% of your users are actually
primarily interested in.

105
00:06:07.606 --> 00:06:12.244
In other words, you'll have a lot of
secondary tasks that people can do that

106
00:06:12.244 --> 00:06:14.284
aren't the main tasks, right?

107
00:06:14.284 --> 00:06:18.536
So, if we take our task list
app that I keep mentioning,

108
00:06:18.536 --> 00:06:24.143
the primary thing you wanna do is add
tasks, be able to review your tasks,

109
00:06:24.143 --> 00:06:28.411
and maybe organize those
tasks into projects, right?

110
00:06:28.411 --> 00:06:33.115
But then there's secondary things
like reoccurring tasks, or

111
00:06:33.115 --> 00:06:35.206
projects within projects,

112
00:06:35.206 --> 00:06:40.184
or having due dates and start dates
on tasks and reoccurring tasks.

113
00:06:40.184 --> 00:06:43.092
There's all kinds of secondary stuff, so

114
00:06:43.092 --> 00:06:46.096
you wanna know what
the core ones are first.

115
00:06:46.096 --> 00:06:49.461
And I'm not saying the secondary
ones aren't important, but

116
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:52.012
you need to know what
those top tasks are first.

117
00:06:52.012 --> 00:06:56.813
And there is a methodology for doing this,
that I am beginning to come across on

118
00:06:56.813 --> 00:07:01.542
front end masters, like the ultimate
fanboy for, and it just happens that,

119
00:07:01.542 --> 00:07:03.835
it's been relevant a lot recently.
