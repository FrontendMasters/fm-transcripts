1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.622
So once you've got a prioritized list,
you'll look at the first,

2
00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:10.360
I don't know, small number,
three to six side.

3
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.991
And what we're gonna do is
at that top three to six,

4
00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:18.232
we're only gonna prioritize one.

5
00:00:18.232 --> 00:00:23.729
We're only gonna look at, we're gonna
build our initial app around one,

6
00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:27.932
now, this might this
freaks people out a lot.

7
00:00:27.932 --> 00:00:31.272
The idea that we're gonna focus
on such a small niche, and

8
00:00:31.272 --> 00:00:35.635
one that maybe isn't sustainable for
the long term, and they really don't

9
00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:40.172
wanna do it, and everything about
them pushes back against this.

10
00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:46.000
But as I I touched on earlier,
with the pebble example that I gave,

11
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.142
you're gonna have a far greater
impact within the constraints of your

12
00:00:52.142 --> 00:00:59.446
limited time and budget if you concentrate
your marketing efforts on a small area.

13
00:00:59.446 --> 00:01:02.447
If you go too broad,
it'll come back to bite you.

14
00:01:02.447 --> 00:01:07.718
We can always add other audiences
later and expand out from it.

15
00:01:07.718 --> 00:01:10.297
And also,
it's gonna lower your costs as well.

16
00:01:10.297 --> 00:01:14.945
If you go for a small niche,
you will increase your word of mouth and

17
00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:19.427
you will lower any ad costs that
you eventually have to do because

18
00:01:19.427 --> 00:01:22.918
you're going for long tail keywords.

19
00:01:22.918 --> 00:01:25.598
So your overall marketing
expenses will be much lower.

20
00:01:25.598 --> 00:01:31.848
And everybody freaks out and goes, turning
away customers, and I totally get that.

21
00:01:31.848 --> 00:01:36.328
I even suffer from this as
an agency owner, right?

22
00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:41.110
Because I will tend to
target one sector at a time.

23
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.600
And it's like, but I don't wanna turn
away somebody from another sector.

24
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.600
And I don't, I'm not saying that, right?

25
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.622
So your website for
this app can still be fairly generic.

26
00:01:55.622 --> 00:02:00.362
So anyway, I wanted to move on to
the subject of how to actually pick that

27
00:02:00.362 --> 00:02:05.655
initial audience you're going after,
cuz we shortlisted it, and we got a load

28
00:02:05.655 --> 00:02:10.881
of information on them, and we've
prioritized them and all the rest of them.

29
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:16.120
It doesn't necessarily mean you should
go with the one at the top of the list,

30
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.343
because, yeah, sure potential does matter,

31
00:02:19.343 --> 00:02:24.099
which audience you consider to have
the most potential is an important

32
00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.938
reason to pick a particular group
of people to target initially.

33
00:02:28.938 --> 00:02:31.098
However, there are other considerations.

34
00:02:31.098 --> 00:02:34.871
Your experience matters as well.

35
00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:38.628
Are there particular audiences that
you've gotten inside a knowledge of?

36
00:02:40.068 --> 00:02:44.838
Or experience of working alongside,
that's a big,

37
00:02:44.838 --> 00:02:49.828
big bonus if you really
know your audience well.

38
00:02:49.828 --> 00:02:53.010
But also passion, and
this goes back to Mark and

39
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.246
his abandoning landlords, or
retailers, or whoever it was.

40
00:02:57.246 --> 00:03:00.873
If you don't care,
if you don't like the audience,

41
00:03:00.873 --> 00:03:05.305
if you don't wanna be working with them,
don't work with them,

42
00:03:05.305 --> 00:03:10.092
you're gonna run out of steam
real quick if you do that.

43
00:03:10.092 --> 00:03:13.653
And the final area I
consider is community,

44
00:03:13.653 --> 00:03:17.512
which audience is the most
vibrant community?

45
00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:24.279
Community makes a big difference because
it's easier to learn about the sector and

46
00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:28.029
their innate needs if they're
all talking to one another and

47
00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:31.248
already interacting with one another.

48
00:03:31.248 --> 00:03:35.878
Also, you're more likely to get
word of mouth recommendation.

49
00:03:35.878 --> 00:03:39.739
And your marketing efforts are gonna
go further if there's a community and

50
00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.472
also to be honest communities have fun.

51
00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:45.784
You know that they're normally good places
to get involved and meet people, I mean,

52
00:03:45.784 --> 00:03:48.092
you think about the development community.

53
00:03:48.092 --> 00:03:53.132
It's great meeting other developers,
and it's an enjoyable experience.

54
00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:58.863
So I would spend a bit of time researching
the community that your audience is in,

55
00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:03.092
the one that looks,
is the one that you wanna pick, right?

56
00:04:03.092 --> 00:04:06.640
So you've kind of decided,
based on those other criteria,

57
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.365
that you're gonna start
with this audience.

58
00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:13.818
But do a little bit of research into the
community that surrounds your audience,

59
00:04:13.818 --> 00:04:15.271
who are the influencers?

60
00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:21.811
Who are the individuals who engage and
nurture and promote the community?

61
00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:26.461
Because hopefully we'll be able
to engage with those people and

62
00:04:26.461 --> 00:04:30.346
encourage them to promote
our product along the way.

63
00:04:30.346 --> 00:04:32.273
What blogs are in the community?

64
00:04:32.273 --> 00:04:34.998
Where do people go to learn, and read, and

65
00:04:34.998 --> 00:04:38.953
become more knowledgeable within
that community of people?

66
00:04:40.675 --> 00:04:41.754
Because again,

67
00:04:41.754 --> 00:04:47.895
you could maybe contribute to that with
topics that are related to your product.

68
00:04:47.895 --> 00:04:51.503
What groups exist within that community?

69
00:04:51.503 --> 00:04:53.925
Are there mailing lists or forums?

70
00:04:53.925 --> 00:04:58.678
Are they all hanging out on a subreddit,
all on Facebook groups?

71
00:04:58.678 --> 00:05:03.967
Where are they and
how are they interacting with one another?

72
00:05:03.967 --> 00:05:08.805
And what events are going on
Crochet International Law or

73
00:05:08.805 --> 00:05:14.553
Toothpick Convention Worldwide or
there's always these weird and

74
00:05:14.553 --> 00:05:20.823
wonderful different kind of group
meetings where people come together.

75
00:05:21.894 --> 00:05:23.978
And these are, if you find yourself,

76
00:05:23.978 --> 00:05:27.235
you've got an audience which
has got a vibrant community,

77
00:05:27.235 --> 00:05:30.964
your job is gonna be a lot easier,
that's all I'm saying, right?

78
00:05:32.294 --> 00:05:36.250
So pick an audience, right?

79
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.846
Using all the advice that I've given you,
remember,

80
00:05:38.846 --> 00:05:41.286
you're not committing to
this audience forever.

81
00:05:41.286 --> 00:05:45.559
Remember, you're not turning away
people outside of this audience,

82
00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:46.992
you're just using it.

83
00:05:46.992 --> 00:05:50.218
You just wanna see whether
there's viability for

84
00:05:50.218 --> 00:05:53.222
your product with that
particular audience.

85
00:05:53.222 --> 00:05:57.119
And if there's not, you can either go,
well, this product isn't working or you

86
00:05:57.119 --> 00:06:01.202
can try a different audience, and rinse,
and repeat, you need to start somewhere.
