&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Great, so we had
a lot of problems here in class, and

2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.320
we had a lot of other issues online.

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.534
And so I wanna be sure to point you to
step 9, Waaa, it didn't work, okay?

4
00:00:13.534 --> 00:00:18.174
These are some fairly typical problems
you might find in this issue.

5
00:00:18.174 --> 00:00:21.849
As you're working with GitHub,
make sure that your folders and

6
00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.705
files are all in the right
place in the same order,

7
00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:29.070
the same structure that you had
been working with them previously.

8
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.760
Once you have published
them to the website,

9
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.540
you should be able to look in your browser
window, and you should be able to see your

10
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.040
webpage, and all the images,
all the CSS should show up there.

11
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.400
If it didn't work,
typical things that go wrong are,

12
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.650
you changed your file and
folder structure.

13
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.720
In other words you copied over the HTML,
you forgot the CSS, if you copy the HTML

14
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.470
and you forget the CSS, then lo and
behold you won't get your styling.

15
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.889
Okay, so you'll have an unformatted
HTML page that looks ugly, for example.

16
00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:06.450
Make sure that all of your images and
CSS uploaded.

17
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.227
That would be something
that's pretty typical.

18
00:01:08.227 --> 00:01:10.700
Maybe it didn't actually all upload.

19
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.664
Maybe you didn't have
a file called index.html.

20
00:01:13.664 --> 00:01:17.039
You had a file called something else,
in which case,

21
00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.094
you're gonna have to look at
that page instead of index.html.

22
00:01:21.094 --> 00:01:24.678
Make sure you click both the Commit
button and the Publish button,

23
00:01:24.678 --> 00:01:26.926
otherwise it doesnt work either, okay?

24
00:01:26.926 --> 00:01:31.458
So those are some of the typical things
that happen along the way that are pretty

25
00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:34.560
typical file management kind
of things that blow up.
