00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.525
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so

2
00:00:00.525 --> 00:00:03.748
a lot of you have been asking
me about how do you put a video?

3
00:00:03.748 --> 00:00:05.250
How do you put out audio?

4
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.094
How do I put my Twitter feed,
my Facebook feed?

5
00:00:08.094 --> 00:00:10.287
You're gotta to use this
exact same technique.

6
00:00:10.287 --> 00:00:12.672
I don't have time to go through
all those websites, but

7
00:00:12.672 --> 00:00:14.109
that is what you are looking for.

8
00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:18.036
You're looking for the button for
like sharing this on somewhere else and

9
00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:21.278
then you wanna look for
a link that's something like embed.

10
00:00:21.278 --> 00:00:27.482
So you can embed YouTube videos,
Vimeo videos, Facebook, Twitter feeds,

11
00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:32.933
Instagram feeds, pretty much
anything kind of along those lines.

12
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:36.693
Social media is really,
really big on sharing stuff and

13
00:00:36.693 --> 00:00:41.906
you can just go online and just grab that
code and and put it into your web page.

14
00:00:41.906 --> 00:00:44.101
Those of you who have your own videos.

15
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:48.813
So I went ahead and
I shot this video with my with my phone,

16
00:00:48.813 --> 00:00:51.279
I'd like to share it online.

17
00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:56.686
The best way to do that is to share
that video on YouTube or Vimeo.

18
00:00:56.686 --> 00:01:01.732
Go ahead and put it up there and
then embed that code

19
00:01:01.732 --> 00:01:06.667
from either YouTube or
video onto your web page.

20
00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:12.429
You can technically speaking put the video
on your own website and people have to go

21
00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:18.108
there to see it and play it, but there's
some big disadvantages to doing that and

22
00:01:18.108 --> 00:01:23.897
the big ones are your web hosting is gonna
come with something called a data limit.

23
00:01:23.897 --> 00:01:26.634
It's how much data can go
out over your website.

24
00:01:26.634 --> 00:01:31.399
If you put your own video up on your own
web hosting, every time somebody plays

25
00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.254
that video, there goes another many
megabytes of data off your hosting plan.

26
00:01:36.254 --> 00:01:39.463
And eventually your hosting
plan costs a lot of money or

27
00:01:39.463 --> 00:01:43.035
your website's gonna go down,
cuz you've run out of data.

28
00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:45.950
There's just a lot of
reasons not to do that.

29
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.010
So I strongly recommend putting
up all your videos up on YouTube.

30
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.040
You can always set them to be unlisted,
so no one else can see them and

31
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.043
then embed them on your web page.

32
00:01:56.043 --> 00:02:00.106
It saves you a lot of time and
you let YouTube pay the bills for

33
00:02:00.106 --> 00:02:02.062
all the data instead of you.

34
00:02:02.062 --> 00:02:03.027
They have lots of money.

35
00:02:03.027 --> 00:02:03.937
Let them pay the bill.

36
00:02:06.818 --> 00:02:09.474
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
any questions on the rest of that?

37
00:02:11.428 --> 00:02:15.349
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So when you do that and
someone clicks the video on your website.

38
00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.659
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do they go to YouTube or

39
00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.058
they can just watch it on the website?

40
00:02:18.058 --> 00:02:20.622
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: They watch it
just on your website right here,

41
00:02:20.622 --> 00:02:23.201
just the same way we can
see the map right here.

42
00:02:23.201 --> 00:02:25.671
You'll be able to watch
the YouTube video right here.

43
00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:30.848
If you have an audio file, SoundCloud is
really popular for sharing audio files.

44
00:02:30.848 --> 00:02:34.166
Other people will take their audio file
and add some pictures with it, and

45
00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:35.138
turn it into a video.

46
00:02:35.138 --> 00:02:36.603
That's another way to do it.

47
00:02:36.603 --> 00:02:39.034
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
you can customize the media blue.

48
00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:41.377
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes,
there's usually minimal customization.

49
00:02:41.377 --> 00:02:44.720
You can turn things on and
off whatever you wanna do.

50
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.875
Yep, so as I said, there were the web
fonts readings here on the web page.

51
00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:53.563
I talked to you about how
to embed maps right here.

52
00:02:53.563 --> 00:02:54.470
There you go.

53
00:02:56.483 --> 00:03:00.069
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The rest of the information
here that's on the forms page,

54
00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.020
there's some references
you can take a look at.

55
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.096
And then as I said last night,
you can plan your portfolio.

56
00:03:08.096 --> 00:03:12.460
[COUGH] There's some additional CSS
practice if you wanna go through and

57
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.005
take a look at some
practice with forms and

58
00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:18.728
then you can continue styling
your about page or hobby page.

59
00:03:18.728 --> 00:03:22.004
Creating a contact form for your website,

60
00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:27.830
include a map of your location somewhere
on your contact page if you want to.

61
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.674
And remember that if you don't
wanna include your exact address,

62
00:03:30.674 --> 00:03:33.630
you can always just include a map of
your city or a map of your country.

63
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.390
That's okay, too.
