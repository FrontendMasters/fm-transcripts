00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.470
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So congratulations you made
it through your first week of boot camp,

2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.010
yay!

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.810
Look how far you've come.

4
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.840
Look how many beautiful
things you've made.

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.370
So you're doing absolutely fabulous work.

6
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.773
So for your assignment for
the weekend, that is here.

7
00:00:21.222 --> 00:00:25.992
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: In the web page for today,
so scroll past all the GitHub stuff,

8
00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:28.810
all the way down to the bottom.

9
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.560
So, the big assignment is this,
building your portfolio.

10
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.310
So I want you to think about who
was gonna see this portfolio, and

11
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.440
what do they wanna know about you.

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.426
What kind of questions
do you need to answer?

13
00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:45.200
What kind of questions are the people
who are gonna visit your portfolio,

14
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.530
what do they need to know?

15
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.020
What do you need to tell them?

16
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.670
What kind of value can you provide, okay?

17
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.670
This is really the way that you start
thinking about building a website.

18
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.490
Who's coming to my website?

19
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.880
What do they want to know?

20
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.750
And what is my goal to get
out of this whole website?

21
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.430
Okay, so if your goal is to get a job,
great goal.

22
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.553
What are people coming to
the website want to know?

23
00:01:10.728 --> 00:01:11.760
&gt;&gt; Student1: Can you do the job?

24
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.890
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Can you do the job, right?

25
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.670
So you're gonna have to visualize
some kind of job that you want, and

26
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.630
then build a website designed to
get that particular job, right?

27
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.150
You may show examples of your work.

28
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.710
You might wanna talk about yourself.

29
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.960
Maybe you wanna post your resume.

30
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.280
Maybe you need a contact form.

31
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.529
There's a bunch of kind of things.

32
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.020
I also have some technical questions for
you to think about,

33
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.770
like what is your color scheme?

34
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.270
You might want to find a nice color scheme
out there on the Adobe Color website.

35
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.890
You want to make your pages look
consistent across your website,

36
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.710
make sure your links work.

37
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.600
That kind of stuff will get you not hired.

38
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.159
[LAUGH] Don't have broken links if you're
trying to get a coding job, pro tip.

39
00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.400
Okay, I'm happy to talk with you
individually more about your portfolios

40
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.940
but you're gonna want
to put this together.

41
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.730
I anticipate it will be something like,
three or four pages.

42
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.680
The first page will take you a long
time to code because you're gonna have

43
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.230
to do all the layout stuff, your logo,
your navigation, your footer.

44
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.760
But going on to your next page,
what do you do?

45
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.710
Copy your existing HTML page,
which is going to have your header and

46
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.350
your navigation in your
footer already right?

47
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.860
Change what's in the middle
to make your next page.

48
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.630
Link it all up in your nav bar.

49
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.360
Make sense?

50
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.170
If we need to make a video on this,

51
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.170
I'm more than happy to make a video on
how to put together multiple pages.

52
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.750
But I think if you think about it,
it should all make sense.

53
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.250
Okay?
