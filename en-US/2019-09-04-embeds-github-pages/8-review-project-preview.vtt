&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So going forward from this,

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:08.940
you can continue to put things up in
this particular repository in GitHub and

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.120
they will show up as a webpage
right there in your GitHub account.

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.960
What GitHub is primarily used for
is to show off your code.

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.780
So you can create other repositories and

6
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.850
you can post those repositories on GitHub,
but they will not show up as webpages.

7
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.760
You'll be able to go
to those repositories,

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.280
you can take a look at the HTML,
you can look at the CSS.

9
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.060
We've actually seen that in action
several times through the course, but

10
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.990
you will not be able to actually view
those documents as a webpage itself.

11
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.285
The only way to view documents on
GitHub as a webpage is using this

12
00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:48.290
github.io technique called GitHub Pages.

13
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.630
And why it's github.io and
why is it &lt;username&gt;.github.io?

14
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.780
That's all stuff that
GitHub established and

15
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.120
they're the ones that said that
this is the way that it works.

16
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.040
That's why we do it this way.

17
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.970
We do what they tell us to do and
magic happens.

18
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.790
We don't do it the right way,
then magic doesn't happen.

19
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.480
So the last part of this is that as
you continue on in the course one of

20
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.280
the things you're gonna be working
on this weekend is a portfolio.

21
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.100
You may very well wanna put your
portfolio up on GitHub pages.

22
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.820
And so you can continue to add to that
folder on your desktop, and synchronize

23
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.370
that then with your GitHub account and
all of that stuff will go live from there.

24
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.040
So, I've listed all those steps here for
you, just so

25
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.920
you have a little checklist to run through
as you want to put additional information

26
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.710
up on your GitHub Pages area.

27
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.220
And that's pretty much it.

28
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.770
That's how you get stuff
up online using GitHub.

29
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.770
The free way, right?

30
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.550
You happy?

31
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.300
Have you shared your cool new website page
with all your social media feeds and your

32
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.660
mom and your dad and your cousin and your
brothers and sisters and your best friend?

33
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.230
It's your very first webpage.

34
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.520
Put it out there and
let them be proud of you.

35
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.120
Go share it.
