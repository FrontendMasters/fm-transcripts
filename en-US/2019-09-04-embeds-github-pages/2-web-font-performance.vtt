&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I will say that Google
does not go down very often at all.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.470
And they are pretty good about
having redundant systems.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.550
And so generally speaking,
these web fonts aren't a problem.

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.250
They're used all over all kinds of
different websites with lots of traffic

5
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.600
and generally this works just fine.

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.710
Let me give you the one
other caution here.

7
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.240
The one other caution is this.

8
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.630
Take a look up here in
the upper right corner of this

9
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.400
window here in Google fonts,
see where it says load time is fast.

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.820
Okay.

11
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.590
Some of you are going to go
bananas with these fonts, right?

12
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.654
We're gonna say, ooh,
I want this one and I want this one and

13
00:00:40.654 --> 00:00:42.980
I want this one up here.

14
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.272
First of all, graphic design speaking,
it's kind of a fashion no.

15
00:00:47.272 --> 00:00:52.540
All right, not too many colors,
not too many fonts, generally speaking.

16
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.310
Generally speaking,
two fonts are really,really good.

17
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.940
Three start to get a little busy.

18
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.130
Four or five, it's kind of a disaster.

19
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.270
For those of you who are old enough to
remember when Microsoft Word came out and

20
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.360
that we could use any font we wanted,
and so we did.

21
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.440
Yeah, it was kind of a disaster that way.

22
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.710
So you can add all these fonts here,
but notice what's gonna happen.

23
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.570
The load time for your web page
is gonna continue to go down.

24
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.530
We're now down to quote, moderate, and

25
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.730
this is measuring a load time just for
our fonts.

26
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.510
Okay?

27
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.310
Remember also for your web page and
how it loads, we have an HTML page,

28
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.020
we have a CSS file, we have some
number of images associated with that.

29
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.140
You'll eventually have some JavaScript.

30
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.910
Now we have some fonts too.

31
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.910
This is how web pages grow in file size,
and they become, take a longer and

32
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.750
longer time to download.

33
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.150
I'm sure you've been on a website where
you just sat there and waited, and

34
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.180
waited, and waited for
a great big huge webpage to download.

35
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.250
This is also how webpages eat data
plans on your mobile devices.

36
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.960
So be nice to your visitors.

37
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.933
Don't go too bananas on the fonts.
