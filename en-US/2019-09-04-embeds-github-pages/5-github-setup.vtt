00:00:00.082 --> 00:00:04.116
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This next part that we're
going to work on is there's a very

2
00:00:04.116 --> 00:00:06.779
specific set of instructions I need for

3
00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.694
you to follow in order
to work with GitHub.

4
00:00:09.694 --> 00:00:13.042
And so we're gonna work through
these steps one by one and

5
00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:15.423
I've spelled them all out here for you.

6
00:00:15.423 --> 00:00:21.725
So first of all, let's go ahead and
download the ZIP of the files for today.

7
00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:25.700
So just as I've showed you over the last
couple of days, go ahead and download

8
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.320
the ZIP file and get it configured and
ready to look at on your desktop.

9
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.100
And what I'd like for you to do is we're
gonna start here at the beginning,

10
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.020
which is how we get our web pages online.

11
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.087
There are a lot of different
ways to get web pages online.

12
00:00:42.087 --> 00:00:44.237
Typically, what you're going
to do is the following.

13
00:00:44.237 --> 00:00:48.682
You're gonna need to purchase two things
and those of you out there online,

14
00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:51.612
don't panic,
we're gonna do this all for free.

15
00:00:51.612 --> 00:00:55.010
But typically, the way you get
a website online is the following.

16
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.130
One is you purchase the domain name.

17
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.310
One is you purchase web hosting.

18
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.571
You have to make these two
things talk to each other.

19
00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:06.749
You have to wait 48 hours for
that talking to happen, so that the domain

20
00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:11.064
name actually associates with the web
hosting and you can find it online and

21
00:01:11.064 --> 00:01:15.615
then you use something called FTP to move
all of those files on up to the server.

22
00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:20.260
When I used to teach this like 15
years ago, this was a 3-hour lecture,

23
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.082
[LAUGH] okay?

24
00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:24.370
Because it was a lot of stuff and
a lot of moving parts.

25
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:31.110
To keep things simple, what we're going to
do is use something called GitHub pages.

26
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.360
So this involves signing up for
a GitHub account and

27
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.390
then there is a way that you can go ahead,
and post your information up on GitHub,

28
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.140
and it will show up as a website as well.

29
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.200
You don't need to purchase a domain name.

30
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.132
You don't need to purchase web hosting.

31
00:01:46.132 --> 00:01:51.387
You can go ahead and get a very simple
site up relatively quickly, okay?

32
00:01:51.387 --> 00:01:55.713
So we're gonna go ahead and
follow these instructions along the way.

33
00:01:55.713 --> 00:01:56.893
So first of all and

34
00:01:56.893 --> 00:02:01.152
we'll take sort of a little minute
in between each one of these.

35
00:02:01.152 --> 00:02:03.777
So you guys on online who
are following along and

36
00:02:03.777 --> 00:02:06.409
I think most of the people
here have an account.

37
00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.130
But for those of you following along,

38
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.325
what we're gonna do is we're going
to first of all, sign up for GitHub.

39
00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:21.256
So the way that you're gonna go about
doing that, so if you go to github.com,

40
00:02:21.256 --> 00:02:26.086
you should see this screen
that looks just like this and

41
00:02:26.086 --> 00:02:31.354
you'll be able to pick a username and
email and a password.

42
00:02:31.354 --> 00:02:34.263
So go ahead and
fill out that form right now.

43
00:02:34.263 --> 00:02:38.831
Click on the sign up for GitHub button,
if you do not have an account.

44
00:02:38.831 --> 00:02:43.290
If you do have an account,
you can just go to the sign in button and

45
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.694
we're gonna go ahead and sign in.

46
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.539
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
you should see something like this.

47
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.833
Cool, once you've got that done,
we're on step two.

48
00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:04.758
Go ahead and download the GitHub Desktop.

49
00:03:04.758 --> 00:03:07.279
Now those of you who have
worked with GitHub before,

50
00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:10.446
you may be accustomed to working
with GitHub on the command line.

51
00:03:10.446 --> 00:03:15.512
That means that you have typically a black
screen with a little flashing cursor at

52
00:03:15.512 --> 00:03:20.517
the bottom and you type in obscure little
commands to make magic happen, okay?

53
00:03:20.517 --> 00:03:24.234
My experience is that working on
the command line just leads to tears,

54
00:03:24.234 --> 00:03:27.520
especially when people have been
coding for four whole days.

55
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.005
So what we would prefer to do is we would
like you to work with GitHub Desktop,

56
00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:35.760
which is gonna give you an interface.

57
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.352
It'll be much easier to work
with in this environment.

58
00:03:38.352 --> 00:03:41.355
If you already know how to work
with GitHub, you wanna go ahead and

59
00:03:41.355 --> 00:03:42.567
work on the command line.

60
00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:46.893
Feel free to do so, but
I'm gonna be doing the GitHub Desktop.

61
00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:52.415
So to do that, we're gonna go ahead and
go to githubdesktop.github.com.

62
00:03:52.415 --> 00:03:54.045
Go ahead and open that up.

63
00:03:58.636 --> 00:04:01.471
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And you'll have a button
right here in the middle of the page.

64
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:05.291
Mine says, download for Mac OS,
because that's what I'm using.

65
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:09.110
Yours may say, download for
Windows if that's what you're using.

66
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.120
Only for the desktop.

67
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.660
Okay, so this is gonna be only for
the desktop.

68
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.974
If they'd pick the wrong operating system,
there should be a link underneath.

69
00:04:16.974 --> 00:04:23.030
Go ahead and download this, and
get it installed on your computer.

70
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.670
If you already have it installed in
your computer, you can go ahead and

71
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:35.609
open it up
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

72
00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:38.844
I'll give you a couple minutes to
go on ahead and download this.

73
00:04:38.844 --> 00:04:41.346
Get it installed and get it open.
