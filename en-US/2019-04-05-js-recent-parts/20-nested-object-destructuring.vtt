00:00:00.038 --> 00:00:05.534
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay,
what if our object has a sub object in it?

2
00:00:05.534 --> 00:00:12.239
Like if I have an a1, and then I have b,

3
00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:17.739
includes my c and d properties.

4
00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:32.211
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Well,
what is B gonna point at here?

5
00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:35.524
It's gonna point at the whole object.

6
00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:41.562
If I wanted C to point at C,
then I would end up saying temp.

7
00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:44.154
I would end up saying b.c.

8
00:00:44.154 --> 00:00:46.969
And d = b.d.

9
00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.722
So if I had that same
kind of object structure

10
00:00:51.722 --> 00:00:55.833
being returned into my destructuring

11
00:00:55.833 --> 00:01:02.749
pattern,
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I'm

12
00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:07.227
going to say the source, the property
we're getting it from is called b.

13
00:01:07.227 --> 00:01:14.384
And what is my target,
it is another destructuring pattern.

14
00:01:14.384 --> 00:01:16.021
And what is in that destructuring pattern?

15
00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:22.062
It is that I want C to point at C,
which in this case,

16
00:01:22.062 --> 00:01:27.540
I can just list shorthand,
and D to point at D,

17
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.900
which in this case can
just be the shorthand.

18
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.979
And what happens if B doesn't exist?

19
00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.642
I have to make that default
to an empty object, and

20
00:01:42.642 --> 00:01:47.871
the same is true over here
in my destructuring pattern.

21
00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:52.791
I need a default for this position,
and that default is the empty object.

22
00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.615
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: It is extremely
easy to forget those defaults,

23
00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:00.952
especially on your nested patterns.

24
00:02:00.952 --> 00:02:06.523
And you'll get type errors blowing
you up when you forget them,

25
00:02:06.523 --> 00:02:10.750
and it is not gonna get
any easier to remember it,

26
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.001
at least in my experience,
I still forget them.

27
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:19.450
So I'm gonna strongly recommend you use
a lenting role to remind you to put

28
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.885
those defaults in, and

29
00:02:20.885 --> 00:02:25.859
ES lent has a lenting role that reminds
you need defaults on your nested patterns.
