00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.976
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: With
that as our introduction,

2
00:00:01.976 --> 00:00:05.353
let's talk about what we can
expect from this course.

3
00:00:05.353 --> 00:00:08.478
As I mentioned, this is the recent parts.

4
00:00:08.478 --> 00:00:12.849
And by recent we mean all those big
changes that happen in ES6 have started to

5
00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.084
settle down and there are a variety of
features that have, were easier for

6
00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:21.422
people to pick up on and some that were
more complex for people to pick up on.

7
00:00:21.422 --> 00:00:26.904
I certainly can't do all 300 plus of
those ES6 features in one course.

8
00:00:26.904 --> 00:00:28.573
We'd be here for weeks.

9
00:00:28.573 --> 00:00:33.631
But I've taken a small selection
of things from ES6, from ES 2016,

10
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:39.343
2017, 2018 and 2019 and woven them
together into this narrative of,

11
00:00:39.343 --> 00:00:43.112
these are the things I think
you should focus on first.

12
00:00:43.112 --> 00:00:47.131
Not the only important things, but
the things you should focus on first.

13
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:51.869
If you haven't learned some of these
things this is your to do list for

14
00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:56.947
what to get up to speed on what's been
recently happening in JavaScript.

15
00:00:56.947 --> 00:00:58.711
So what are some of those features.

16
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:03.390
Well we're going to look at templates
strings, string padding and also trimming.

17
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.509
Destructuring and fair warning,
destructuring's a big meaty topic.

18
00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.138
We're gonna spend a lot of
our time in this course,

19
00:01:10.138 --> 00:01:12.597
a significant amount of
time going through it.

20
00:01:12.597 --> 00:01:17.357
It is by far the most complex feature that
I've seen added to JavaSript maybe ever.

21
00:01:17.357 --> 00:01:21.949
And I wouldn't likely decide to
put something like that into

22
00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:27.001
a course unless I believe that that
extra complexity was worth it.

23
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:31.577
You will find I think that as you put in
the investment of effort to understand

24
00:01:31.577 --> 00:01:36.312
destructuring, you'll see how much more
it pays off in so many other places.

25
00:01:36.312 --> 00:01:40.281
So it's important even though it's gonna
be difficult and even though it's gonna be

26
00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:43.323
intimidating, that is a very
important feature to get a hold of.

27
00:01:43.323 --> 00:01:46.601
Instead of array features like find and
include, and flat, and

28
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:48.847
flatMap, we'll then look at iterators and

29
00:01:48.847 --> 00:01:52.140
generators which is a little bit
of a different way of thinking.

30
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.896
And we're gonna look at some
improvements to regular expressions.

31
00:01:55.896 --> 00:02:01.550
And then we're gonna be looking at
async await and async generators.

32
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.166
That'll round us out and so, that second
half of this, those last three or

33
00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:10.857
four items really sort of start to tell
a narrative of JavaScript maturing in

34
00:02:10.857 --> 00:02:15.843
the respect of asynchronous programming
and that's a big key thing that has been

35
00:02:15.843 --> 00:02:19.686
way behind quite frankly in JavaScript for
quite a long time.

36
00:02:19.686 --> 00:02:23.672
The management of parallelism or
of concurrency in our language,

37
00:02:23.672 --> 00:02:28.012
it's a critical thing, and only of
late did we get promises in ES6, and

38
00:02:28.012 --> 00:02:31.235
then some of these features
layered on on top of them.

39
00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:34.297
And JavaScript has a really
good healthy future now,

40
00:02:34.297 --> 00:02:36.823
as a result of a number
of these parameters.

41
00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:40.250
So that's an idea of what
to expect from this course.

42
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.669
We will go through a variety of these
different features and will pull out

43
00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:49.162
some exercises in bits and pieces to
play with these different features,

44
00:02:49.162 --> 00:02:53.159
to get a better understanding,
a deeper understanding of them.

45
00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:54.883
But that's certainly not exhaustive.

46
00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:55.754
The only way for

47
00:02:55.754 --> 00:02:59.993
you to really learn this stuff is to go
back to your own code bases and try it.

48
00:02:59.993 --> 00:03:03.542
Try some destructuring,
try an array.find, those sorts of things.

49
00:03:03.542 --> 00:03:07.872
You're going to have to do that if
you want to be able to keep up.
