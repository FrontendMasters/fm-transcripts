00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.567
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Here's another one,
and this is a bit more sophisticated.

2
00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:07.828
But this is a situation many of you
probably have been in at some point or

3
00:00:07.828 --> 00:00:08.488
another.

4
00:00:08.488 --> 00:00:13.370
You have an object that represents some
defaults, like you see here on line 3.

5
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.445
And these defaults,
in this case this is for AJAX, so

6
00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:22.624
I'm providing a default URL, and
a default method, and so forth.

7
00:00:22.624 --> 00:00:27.275
And I store those in an object
because I want to essentially mix

8
00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:32.296
those defaults with some settings
whenever I make an AJAX column.

9
00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:38.832
So here's some settings that I'm going
to try to mix in with the defaults.

10
00:00:38.832 --> 00:00:41.892
Which means if I provide
the URL like I'm doing here,

11
00:00:41.892 --> 00:00:45.507
that's gonna override that
default URL that's already set.

12
00:00:45.507 --> 00:00:49.449
But I'm not providing,
for example, the method.

13
00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.952
You'll notice down here that I'm
not providing the method, and so

14
00:00:53.952 --> 00:00:56.805
it would pick up of
default of method post.

15
00:00:56.805 --> 00:01:01.684
So I essentially have these two
separate objects that I want to mix

16
00:01:01.684 --> 00:01:04.888
together at the call site for
my AJAX call.

17
00:01:04.888 --> 00:01:08.228
The call site down here, as you can see,

18
00:01:08.228 --> 00:01:12.854
the call site is AJAX and
I'm using underscore extend.

19
00:01:12.854 --> 00:01:15.286
That's the underscore
libraries version of that,

20
00:01:15.286 --> 00:01:18.503
there's lots of libraries out there
that provide an extend method.

21
00:01:18.503 --> 00:01:23.644
But they essentially will give you the
ability to take several different objects,

22
00:01:23.644 --> 00:01:26.436
in this case like defaults and
settings, and

23
00:01:26.436 --> 00:01:29.374
it first copies the defaults
into the object and

24
00:01:29.374 --> 00:01:34.460
then it overrides anything that comes
through with the settings into the object.

25
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.442
Fairly straightforward, and many of you
have probably done the default in setting

26
00:01:40.442 --> 00:01:46.603
merging objects thing like this, at least
on a few occasions, if not more than that.

27
00:01:46.603 --> 00:01:51.436
The thing that bugs me about this is,
Number 1, this is very imperative,

28
00:01:51.436 --> 00:01:56.195
I'm relying upon some libraries
definition of how extending works, and

29
00:01:56.195 --> 00:02:01.365
it's not terribly obvious what happens
with nested objects or nested arrays.

30
00:02:01.365 --> 00:02:06.154
I have to go look at the documentation for
underscore extend to remember how to

31
00:02:06.154 --> 00:02:10.809
overwrite an array element that's
nested four levels deep or something.

32
00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:14.285
So I thought to myself when I
first saw the structuring and

33
00:02:14.285 --> 00:02:19.138
I was trying to come up with use cases for
it, the destructuring and the defaults

34
00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:23.339
that you can do inside of destruction
patterns was a great use case for

35
00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:27.999
replacing an API driven approach to
this to having a declarative approach.

36
00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:32.377
And I call this pattern destructuring and
restructuring.

37
00:02:32.377 --> 00:02:38.532
So first let me show you what it
looks like to define a function.

38
00:02:38.532 --> 00:02:42.348
We would define a function,
in this case for our AJAX options,

39
00:02:42.348 --> 00:02:44.876
I define a function called AJAX options.

40
00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:50.953
And you'll notice that AJAX options
takes an object as its input,

41
00:02:50.953 --> 00:02:57.589
and it has a whole set of properties
that it expects to see on that object.

42
00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:00.959
So it expects the see URLs, and
methods, and data, and callbacks.

43
00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.096
In any place where there's an applicable
default I just list it directly in

44
00:03:05.096 --> 00:03:06.747
the destructuring pattern.

45
00:03:06.747 --> 00:03:10.540
And then headers, and
I have another default, and I collect, and

46
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.859
I could have even listed a dot
dot dot of other properties,

47
00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.360
in case there were other ones being passed
along we could have gathered those.

48
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.148
But what I'm basically doing is you
pass in an object of your settings, and

49
00:03:23.148 --> 00:03:27.024
I'm using the default algorithm
to mix in any defaults where

50
00:03:27.024 --> 00:03:31.670
your settings are missing,
at any level of the declarative structure.

51
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.815
And what i end up with then is down at the
bottom I have a whole set of individual

52
00:03:38.815 --> 00:03:45.416
variables that i need to restructure
back into the new merged object.

53
00:03:45.416 --> 00:03:51.630
So destructuring happens at the top,
that's what all of this stuff is up here,

54
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.288
and then down here, we recreate
the object structure with all the new and

55
00:03:57.288 --> 00:04:01.688
mixed in values, and
that's the restructuring part.

56
00:04:01.688 --> 00:04:04.951
So in other words,
in any place where I'm going to,

57
00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:08.886
or would be inclined to use
something like underscore extend,

58
00:04:08.886 --> 00:04:12.169
I just define a function for
that specific purpose.

59
00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:16.989
And I give it a good semantic name like,
in this case, AJAX options, and

60
00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.363
instead of maintaining my defaults for
my AJAX in a default AJAX options object,

61
00:04:22.363 --> 00:04:26.236
I just have those defaults
right inside of this function,

62
00:04:26.236 --> 00:04:29.263
in its destructuring parameter signature.

63
00:04:29.263 --> 00:04:34.125
So you can see very clearly that
we default to the URL of this, and

64
00:04:34.125 --> 00:04:36.663
we default to the method of post.

65
00:04:36.663 --> 00:04:41.324
And I think this more clearly
communicates where my defaults are, and

66
00:04:41.324 --> 00:04:46.231
also how my mixing will happen,
I think it is more declarative approach.

67
00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:48.948
So the way you use an AJAX options,

68
00:04:48.948 --> 00:04:53.727
is if you need to get out an object
that only has the defaults,

69
00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:58.322
you just simply call the function
without any inputs, and

70
00:04:58.322 --> 00:05:02.284
you get back an object with
all the defaults in it.

71
00:05:02.284 --> 00:05:06.839
If you have a settings object,
like I have down here,

72
00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:13.536
you pass to AJAX the result of calling
AJAX options with your settings object.

73
00:05:13.536 --> 00:05:17.830
Your settings object goes in as the input,
it mixes with all the defaults,

74
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.077
you get a new mixed object back out, and

75
00:05:20.077 --> 00:05:23.170
that is now sufficient to
pass to your AJAX function.

76
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.521
I've started doing this in any place
where I used to do something like

77
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:28.880
underscore extend.

78
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.455
And I found it to be a lot easier to
maintain because I can go to one AJAX

79
00:05:33.455 --> 00:05:37.231
options function and
see where all my defaults are, and

80
00:05:37.231 --> 00:05:41.834
how all of my mixing happens and
tweak it if something's not right.

81
00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:48.543
So this is yet another sort of more
advanced usage of destructuring.

82
00:05:48.543 --> 00:05:52.811
Any questions about what we've
looked out with destructuring?

83
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:56.883
Reminder, it's gonna take practice,
so if it feels too unfamiliar to you,

84
00:05:56.883 --> 00:05:59.464
don't worry,
once you're practiced with it.

85
00:05:59.464 --> 00:06:02.863
And hopefully it won't take you three or
four weeks like it did me,

86
00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:06.080
hopefully I've taught you well
enough that within a few days of

87
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.011
practicing that you should start
to be able to pick that up
