&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: All right, let's try
to work on an exercise about these so

2
00:00:04.223 --> 00:00:09.981
called template literals or interval
literals, how we are on to refer to them.

3
00:00:09.981 --> 00:00:13.925
And specifically, we're going to
work with tagged interpret literals.

4
00:00:13.925 --> 00:00:18.093
So, here's you're going to be
building your own tag function.

5
00:00:18.093 --> 00:00:22.752
You'll see that it's called upper and
you're gonna be using upper to make sure

6
00:00:22.752 --> 00:00:26.784
that a string drops in these three
variables, the name, twitter and

7
00:00:26.784 --> 00:00:28.119
topic as you see here.

8
00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.282
But the purpose of upper is not
just to combine the string but

9
00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.454
to upper case the values only.

10
00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:38.574
So you can see that your console.log
statement here should end up printing true

11
00:00:38.574 --> 00:00:42.400
because your string should end up
equaling the string that you see there.

12
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.994
So in effect, that is your test case,
make sure the console.log prints true.

13
00:00:47.994 --> 00:00:54.318
Define your upper tag function and then
make sure to tag that interval literal and

14
00:00:54.318 --> 00:00:58.225
drop in the expressions as
you saw in the lecture.

15
00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:03.707
So we'll come back in a couple of minutes
and talk through the solution, if you get

16
00:01:03.707 --> 00:01:09.281
stuck on this, feel free to always take
