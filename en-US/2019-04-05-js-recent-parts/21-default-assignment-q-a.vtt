00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.643
&gt;&gt; Student: I've seen in the past
people use like a placeholder like

2
00:00:05.643 --> 00:00:09.145
default object that
includes the entire tree.

3
00:00:09.145 --> 00:00:10.817
Just to be more semantic about it,

4
00:00:10.817 --> 00:00:13.655
is that-
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Do you mean here they're

5
00:00:13.655 --> 00:00:14.900
using that?

6
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.636
&gt;&gt; Student: Yeah, yes,
it would be at the top level.

7
00:00:16.636 --> 00:00:19.332
Does that seem like overkill?

8
00:00:19.332 --> 00:00:21.000
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So
there is a little bit of a nuance here.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.190
Lemme jump into that when we talk
about defaults and destructuring.

10
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.537
So if I have, lemme see if I can
come up with a good example here.

11
00:00:32.537 --> 00:00:38.250
If I have an o,
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: That

12
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.576
has an a in it with a b 2 and

13
00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:48.463
a c 3,
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: We call this o1.

14
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:56.644
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And
I have another o2 which has an a in it,

15
00:00:56.644 --> 00:01:00.324
with an empty object, and

16
00:01:00.324 --> 00:01:05.356
then I'll say, o3 has no a at all.

17
00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:13.320
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And then we want to talk
about destructuring these three values.

18
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.070
So if I said something like var,
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Let

19
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.886
me be structured on the other side so that
we're not running out of room over here.

20
00:01:21.886 --> 00:01:24.993
So if I wanted to destructure the o 1,
the o2,

21
00:01:24.993 --> 00:01:27.969
and the o3,
I would say something like var.

22
00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:33.560
And then an object with an a property,
and then let's say that I wanted to

23
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.347
provide a b and defaulted to 10, and
then get a c and default that to 20.

24
00:01:42.103 --> 00:01:44.912
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And
I set that equal to o1.

25
00:01:44.912 --> 00:01:50.302
If I remove b here,
what is b end up getting?

26
00:01:50.302 --> 00:01:51.840
The value 10.

27
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.375
If I remove c here,
c ends up getting the value 20.

28
00:01:56.375 --> 00:01:59.469
What happens if I remove a here?

29
00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:06.999
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I'm gonna get a type
error, cuz I don't have a default for it.

30
00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.419
So I do need my default, right?

31
00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.022
But now, what happens if,

32
00:02:13.022 --> 00:02:18.503
in my default, I were to try to say b 10,

33
00:02:18.503 --> 00:02:23.222
and c 20, and not put those here.

34
00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:30.022
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: If I leave off b,
what is b gonna be?

35
00:02:30.022 --> 00:02:37.302
&gt;&gt; Student2: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: [LAUGH]

36
00:02:37.302 --> 00:02:38.572
&gt;&gt; Student2: Just undefined.

37
00:02:38.572 --> 00:02:42.759
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: It's gonna be just
undefined, because this thing doesn't even

38
00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.119
get involved in the case of o1,
since there is an a.

39
00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:49.711
What happens if I use o2,
what is b gonna be?

40
00:02:51.235 --> 00:02:51.786
&gt;&gt; Student3: 10.

41
00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:56.357
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Still undefined.

42
00:02:56.357 --> 00:03:01.398
The only time that b is gonna
end up with this default value

43
00:03:01.398 --> 00:03:05.926
of 10 is in the o3 case
where there was no a at all.

44
00:03:05.926 --> 00:03:07.469
You with me?

45
00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:11.845
So, the difference between putting
the defaults in a, as you said, a default

46
00:03:11.845 --> 00:03:16.156
object structure, and putting them
inline into your pattern, is whether or

47
00:03:16.156 --> 00:03:20.497
not it's resilient to the case that
the object is completely missing or not.

48
00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.163
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So it is a strong
recommendation that you do your defaults

49
00:03:26.163 --> 00:03:29.946
here, and then basically just
always use an empty object.

50
00:03:29.946 --> 00:03:35.295
I've never ever needed a case to have
my default be some non-empty object or

51
00:03:35.295 --> 00:03:36.726
non-empty array.

52
00:03:38.362 --> 00:03:41.136
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: It's always better
to put the defaults in the inline,

53
00:03:41.136 --> 00:03:42.591
it's more robust that way.
