00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.849
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: All right, well let's
talk about this destructuring exercise,

2
00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:07.540
we'll take a look at how to solve it.

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.086
We start with the defaults object, but

4
00:00:10.086 --> 00:00:13.875
our goal is to not have to manage
this in a separate object.

5
00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:18.068
Our goal is to have those values in
line into our destructuring pattern.

6
00:00:18.068 --> 00:00:20.871
So for now comment that object out and

7
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:26.213
then I'll make sure to use those
values in my destructuring pattern.

8
00:00:26.213 --> 00:00:31.183
Speaking of that destructuring pattern,
we want that to go here,

9
00:00:31.183 --> 00:00:35.905
and our destructuring pattern
needs to account for the topic.

10
00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:40.284
And it defaults the JavaScript and

11
00:00:40.284 --> 00:00:44.816
the format which defaults to Live.

12
00:00:44.816 --> 00:00:50.124
And also a slides object
which has a start that

13
00:00:50.124 --> 00:00:56.000
defaults to 0 and
an end of it defaults to 100.

14
00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:05.056
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So that is as breaking
down which means we end up creating four

15
00:01:05.056 --> 00:01:10.283
variables, the topic variable, the format
variable, and then start an end.

16
00:01:10.283 --> 00:01:15.391
And then all we should need
to do is restructure those

17
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:20.730
back together so we will add topic and
format back in and

18
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.673
then we will add a slides object
that includes start and end.

19
00:01:34.498 --> 00:01:39.323
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Now if you wanted to be
able to pass along any properties that

20
00:01:39.323 --> 00:01:43.184
you hadn't otherwise
already accounted for,

21
00:01:43.184 --> 00:01:48.508
you could use the object gather and
say ...otherProperties.

22
00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:53.243
And then you would simply do
an object spread by saying,

23
00:01:53.243 --> 00:01:58.523
...otherProps,
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: It's not needed for

24
00:01:58.523 --> 00:02:02.685
this particular example but just to give
you an idea of how your destructuring

25
00:02:02.685 --> 00:02:06.475
pattern can include anything else
that might have been passed along.
