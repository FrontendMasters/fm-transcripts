&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: All right, so

2
00:00:00.824 --> 00:00:05.379
we spend quite a bit of time digging into
all the ins and outs of destructuring.

3
00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:07.423
It seems like a really good idea for

4
00:00:07.423 --> 00:00:10.321
us to get at least a teeny
bit of practice with it.

5
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:13.935
So we're gonna look at that
example that I just showed you,

6
00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:18.640
which was the idea of using destructuring
and restructuring as a declarative

7
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.857
syntactic replacement for
something like the underscore extends.

8
00:00:22.857 --> 00:00:25.808
So here what you have is
a defaults object, and

9
00:00:25.808 --> 00:00:28.387
we're making this fakeAjax call here.

10
00:00:28.387 --> 00:00:33.837
And it's going to give us a response back,
which we are going to destructure,

11
00:00:33.837 --> 00:00:37.649
the code comment says where
your destructuring goes.

12
00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.187
And then we need to
restructure in the object

13
00:00:40.187 --> 00:00:42.937
that we passed along to
the test case function.

14
00:00:42.937 --> 00:00:47.461
And this should end up printing out true
if you've properly done the destructuring

15
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:48.634
and restructuring.

16
00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:51.008
So remember,
just like from the slides, and

17
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:53.761
refer back to the slides
if you need that reference.

18
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:58.426
But remember, we're gonna be restructuring
and including the defaults in line with

19
00:00:58.426 --> 00:01:02.132
our destructuring pattern here in
the handle response signature.

20
00:01:02.132 --> 00:01:07.252
And then once we have those individual
values assigned off, we're going to

21
00:01:07.252 --> 00:01:13.024
restructure the object that is expected to
be passed along to the test case function.

22
00:01:13.024 --> 00:01:18.193
So we will break for a few moments and
let you try your hand at destructuring.

23
00:01:18.193 --> 00:01:22.108
Remember, if you need any hints,
cuz you get stuck,

24
00:01:22.108 --> 00:01:25.857
just take a look at
the ex.fixed JavaScript file.
