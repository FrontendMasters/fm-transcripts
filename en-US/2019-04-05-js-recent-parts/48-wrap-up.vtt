&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I can tell by the looks
on your faces that you're swimming in all

2
00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:11.504
kinds of what on earth fatigue [LAUGH]
from all of these new things that

3
00:00:11.504 --> 00:00:13.142
have been layered on.

4
00:00:13.142 --> 00:00:18.007
Especially some of these last things,
which really kinda stretch your brain.

5
00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:21.377
These are not things that I
figured out in five minutes.

6
00:00:21.377 --> 00:00:25.003
It took days and weeks and
months to think about the grid and

7
00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:29.526
think about what's missing and
think about conceptually what we need.

8
00:00:29.526 --> 00:00:33.432
So don't feel bad if you are feeling that
fatigue or if you are feeling like the,

9
00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:36.075
I'm swimming and
I don't even know what I'm doing.

10
00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:38.745
That is entirely natural and okay.

11
00:00:38.745 --> 00:00:41.605
I wanna remind you that
what the mission for

12
00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:45.180
this course was is not for
you to walk away and be like,

13
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.366
certified I know everything about
the new JavaScript, recent JavaScript.

14
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:51.311
That isn't the mission.

15
00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:56.563
The mission really is to adopt
the mindset that this is a train ride,

16
00:00:56.563 --> 00:01:01.630
that you should hop on, hang on tight,
and enjoy the ride because

17
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.722
where we're headed with JavaScript
is a really amazing future.

18
00:01:06.722 --> 00:01:11.565
It's an amazing future that isn't held
back by all of the mistakes of the past

19
00:01:11.565 --> 00:01:14.558
where we have these long
periods of no updates.

20
00:01:14.558 --> 00:01:17.117
It's not held back by the,
we're just gonna dump so

21
00:01:17.117 --> 00:01:21.090
much stuff on you that you can't possibly
even learn it all, even in a few years.

22
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.779
Instead, we're going to have a regular
patterned release of results that little

23
00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:32.139
by little by little improve our ability
to write JavaScript programs not that

24
00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:37.270
just do x,y, and z but that communicate
well why we wanna do x, y, and z.

25
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.118
That's what makes me excited about
the stuff that's happened recently in

26
00:01:41.118 --> 00:01:44.121
JavaScript and
the things that are just over the horizon.

27
00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:48.834
And we'll definitely be talking about
those in the next version of this course.

28
00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:49.523
Okay?

29
00:01:49.523 --> 00:01:50.601
Thank you all for being here.

30
00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:54.651
I appreciate it and happy JavaScripting.
