00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.809
We do need to get some motion working for
our friend.

2
00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:09.286
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do
the basic setup of the left and right.

3
00:00:09.286 --> 00:00:13.622
And then I'm gonna have you just take
a second to get up and down working.

4
00:00:13.622 --> 00:00:17.280
And then we'll look at it together, but
I'll get us started with left and right.

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.409
Now, important note, I'm really
excited to start programming my hero.

6
00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:29.580
But if you look up here, there is a taco,
which means, what am I writing code for?

7
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.220
&gt;&gt; The taco.

8
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.701
&gt;&gt; The taco, so if I click on Dave, now I
can see that I'm writing code for Dave.

9
00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:40.016
So we'll do the basic setup
again just to kind of show you.

10
00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:44.666
When the green flag is clicked,
you can see that right now,

11
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.185
the go to x and y is set to 0, 0.

12
00:00:47.185 --> 00:00:50.510
Like I said before,
it is wherever Dave currently is.

13
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.880
I like that in this case,
so I'm keeping it, cool.

14
00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.183
So we'll say, when the game starts,

15
00:01:00.183 --> 00:01:03.007
we will go to x and y.

16
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:09.232
I don't know, I mean, I could point
them in a common direction, sure.

17
00:01:09.232 --> 00:01:14.049
Whatever else you think that really
needs to happen for this game,

18
00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.209
you can do right here as well.

19
00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:21.446
I think this is probably good enough for
now, if we need more, we'll add to it.

20
00:01:21.446 --> 00:01:24.610
And then we'll kick off the game loop,
like I said before.

21
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:32.180
I'm gonna say, if the right key
is pressed, we're gonna go right.

22
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.198
So I think this is gonna work basically
the same way where we point Dave in

23
00:01:37.198 --> 00:01:37.910
a direction.

24
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.465
We don't need to worry about the rotation,
cuz he should turn.

25
00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:42.992
He's not a left-right character,
he's top down, so

26
00:01:42.992 --> 00:01:44.888
the eyes will go the way
we want them to go.

27
00:01:44.888 --> 00:01:49.748
So if the right key is pressed,
then what we'll do is

28
00:01:49.748 --> 00:01:54.170
we'll just point him in
the direction of 90.

29
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.959
I will leave it to you if you want
the Pac-Man mechanic of holding on

30
00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:00.200
the key or not.

31
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.420
I'm gonna say that you press once and
Dave just starts going.

32
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.170
If you wanted Dave to
move as you hold the key,

33
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.700
then you could put the move block in here.

34
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.861
I'm gonna assume for this moment
that I want the Pac-Man dynamic,

35
00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:19.984
that's just how I feel right now.

36
00:02:19.984 --> 00:02:22.900
I don't even know what I wrote in the
notes, but that feels good, I want that.

37
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.166
And if I change my mind,
guess what I can do?

38
00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:26.850
I can change the code.

39
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.360
So that's fun, so do that,
I'll duplicate this, pop that right there.

40
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.165
We'll say left, Is -90,

41
00:02:40.165 --> 00:02:44.361
unless, can he go right and left?

42
00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:47.902
A pro tip, every little thing,
you probably just wanna test it.

43
00:02:47.902 --> 00:02:52.250
Cuz what you don't wanna do is get really
involved doing all four directions, and

44
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.708
then find out life is hard.

45
00:02:53.708 --> 00:02:55.582
So for instance, does anyone
wanna see my mistake right now?

46
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:02.810
He points in different directions,
but all the talking about him,

47
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.526
I'm gonna be moving later and not in
that block, he doesn't move anywhere.

48
00:03:06.526 --> 00:03:10.351
So let's go fix that.

49
00:03:10.351 --> 00:03:13.235
And we'll say,
I'm gonna have him move no matter what.

50
00:03:13.235 --> 00:03:17.971
If you wanted to move only when
the arrow is being held down,

51
00:03:17.971 --> 00:03:22.722
then you can just put it inside
these two if blocks, right?

52
00:03:22.722 --> 00:03:27.479
So Dave can go left and
right, which is really sad,

53
00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.919
because the taco is also up, right?

54
00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.659
And so we need to deal with that.

55
00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.078
But I will leave that to you for a few
minutes to just get the hang of that, and

56
00:03:38.078 --> 00:03:40.973
then we'll rejoin and
look at some different options as well.
