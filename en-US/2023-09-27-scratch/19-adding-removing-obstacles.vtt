1
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.622
So we can give them something to avoid, so

2
00:00:02.622 --> 00:00:06.930
we could have something like y'all
ever see when Chrome doesn't work.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.660
You can play the dyno game,
&gt;&gt; That happened to me earlier today.

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.550
&gt;&gt; Yep,
I think I will join you in this endeavor.

5
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.847
I'm going to try to make it right now
to kind of see one more mechanic, and

6
00:00:18.847 --> 00:00:21.680
now that we've got jumping
before we all had falling.

7
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.410
Now we got jumping.

8
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.050
This opens up a whole new range
of things that we could do.

9
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.511
Let's go ahead and make another sprite.

10
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:32.927
Is there a cactus?

11
00:00:32.927 --> 00:00:34.798
No.

12
00:00:34.798 --> 00:00:35.685
&gt;&gt; No.

13
00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:41.520
&gt;&gt; I'll make spikes for
felids at the bottom.

14
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.457
&gt;&gt; Maybe you could jump over a muffin.

15
00:00:42.457 --> 00:00:44.840
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] to the top.

16
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.230
&gt;&gt; We can have spikes.

17
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.618
You're saying if I personally
open the sprite editor right now,

18
00:00:50.618 --> 00:00:54.508
I will sit there for the next half hour
making a sprite and ignore all of you.

19
00:00:54.508 --> 00:00:57.581
And so we don't want that.

20
00:00:57.581 --> 00:00:58.840
&gt;&gt; I'm quick [INAUDIBLE].

21
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.962
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Maybe he could jump over trees?

22
00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:02.511
&gt;&gt; Do you want a tree?

23
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:03.559
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You can jump over tacos

24
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.710
&gt;&gt; You can jump over Withered Tacos.

25
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.090
You can jump over that crazy starfish.

26
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.660
&gt;&gt; Wait, tacos swoop down like birds?

27
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.050
&gt;&gt; I like this.
&gt;&gt; And then you have to jump over it.

28
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.980
&gt;&gt; You might want to make it smaller.

29
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.864
&gt;&gt; Well that's what we'll do, is we'll
start by making it, let's flip it.

30
00:01:34.836 --> 00:01:37.630
Flip it to negative 90,
let's make it a lot smaller.

31
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.124
The problem with this one is, I don't
know how this mechanic's gonna work, but

32
00:01:42.124 --> 00:01:43.040
that's not the important part.

33
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.280
You can adjust it later on.

34
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.754
That's a tiny snake I think
I like in the dynasty,

35
00:01:48.754 --> 00:01:52.360
they're kind of skinny and tall, not wide.

36
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.608
So I might regret the choice of a snake,

37
00:01:54.608 --> 00:01:59.320
but I'm pretty sure I can swap out
the Sprite later and life will be fine.

38
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.740
Cool, so we'll say 50, yeah.

39
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.662
We'll see if we regret that at some point.

40
00:02:04.662 --> 00:02:08.580
And we can,
I guess we can swap it out in a second.

41
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.930
So we'll go ahead and we'll give it
very similar to the recycled apples,

42
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.735
where we can go ahead and we'll say,
when the game starts,give it a game loop.

43
00:02:22.424 --> 00:02:26.015
And we'll say change x.

44
00:02:30.287 --> 00:02:32.380
And negative one so it goes to the left.

45
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.010
And again,
negative one was probably too little.

46
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.882
But let's just see if this
works at all and then.

47
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.841
What's the furthest it can possibly get?

48
00:02:47.956 --> 00:02:48.963
Let's see.

49
00:02:53.518 --> 00:02:56.547
Well past nano is, looks like 250, so and

50
00:02:56.547 --> 00:03:01.670
then if it's less than 250, we'll move
it all the way to the other side.

51
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.630
Okay, if it touches any of the spikes,
then,

52
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.860
&gt;&gt; We got spikes too.

53
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.068
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've got spikes and

54
00:03:11.068 --> 00:03:15.400
all the spikes will,
&gt;&gt; So then we need the operator.

55
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.779
So we'll say less.

56
00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:25.630
So then if the exposition,
That's a negative 250.

57
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.390
We thought we could get away with.

58
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.313
We'll set the x,

59
00:03:36.018 --> 00:03:39.373
To we want x position.

60
00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.070
Let's see if we can get away with 240 and
see how that goes.

61
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.840
So we should have endless
snakes on this plane.

62
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.891
That's far too slow, Nobody likes that.

63
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:00.219
Life, it's like a dungeon train of snakes.

64
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.870
All right, comes over it.

65
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.152
So the other thing we might wanna do is
we can have variables that like randomize

66
00:04:07.152 --> 00:04:10.136
the speed we could have different
costumes for different heights I mean

67
00:04:10.136 --> 00:04:12.920
I should probably use collision
detection at some point as well but

68
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.470
But we have a jumping motion.

69
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.970
We have a mechanic where
he is jumping over them.

70
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.073
We do need to do some kind of
variability at some point,

71
00:04:19.073 --> 00:04:20.590
like the game should get harder.

72
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.080
Some of that I am going to leave to you.

73
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:29.160
My basic goal here was to talk a lot
about, how do we do jumping, right?

74
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.580
And this is a pretty linear job.

75
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.410
We could have something
that tapers off too.

76
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.852
If you're playing an ice level
in Super Mario Brothers,

77
00:04:35.852 --> 00:04:37.870
it begins to slide and slow down.

78
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.062
This one is kind of like he's going,

79
00:04:40.062 --> 00:04:44.200
decelerating at a kind of decent
amount until he comes back down.

80
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.111
So we might want to also take
a look at how to run around and

81
00:04:48.111 --> 00:04:51.200
make have velocity that
tapers off as well.

82
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.137
But I will leave you with pieces
like the collision detection, and

83
00:04:56.137 --> 00:04:59.940
I'll show you an example,
and we'll take a look.

84
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.629
We can just use different costumes
that have different heights.

85
00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:06.666
And so every time you can pick
a random costume as well, or

86
00:05:06.666 --> 00:05:10.798
next costume, so that they're rotating
amongst a bunch of heights as well.

87
00:05:10.798 --> 00:05:15.659
So we could we say this quick,

88
00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:18.980
nano jump, right?

89
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.420
Same good West.

90
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.300
Nano Jump, good name.

91
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.269
Love it.

92
00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:29.821
We could also theoretically have
ones with different heights,

93
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.275
So this point where they're just going
to change costumes and speed every time.

94
00:05:40.275 --> 00:05:42.460
So you can kind of like
play around with this and

95
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.530
do various different mechanics
at different points.

96
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.582
This is what happens when
they let me make sprites.

97
00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:50.305
Terrible.

98
00:05:50.305 --> 00:05:57.166
&gt;&gt; Nano game for how far you go you score
your score to 500, I'm pretty sure.

99
00:05:57.166 --> 00:06:00.859
There's like kiradech goes that
&gt;&gt; Yeah Terry doesn't start

100
00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:01.420
a certain point.

101
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.215
So like in the game loop, you might have a
conditional where pterodactyls maybe only

102
00:06:05.215 --> 00:06:07.468
start one score is greater
than a certain amount.
