1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.614
So we want to do is try we
have a game of a screen.

2
00:00:04.614 --> 00:00:06.738
It'd be cool to also have
a game start screen or

3
00:00:06.738 --> 00:00:09.526
like something along the the ability
to restart the game.

4
00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:14.657
A big piece of that is just
separating out the logic for

5
00:00:14.657 --> 00:00:19.911
starting the game and
the actual start of the program.

6
00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:21.479
So we can pull this off.

7
00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:24.304
It's actually super simple,

8
00:00:24.304 --> 00:00:30.173
he says have never done it like
this version of this game before so

9
00:00:30.173 --> 00:00:34.640
say when i receive like
a new message game start.

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.095
Cool, and so that will go in, no,

11
00:00:38.095 --> 00:00:43.001
we don't want that,
where did my game start go?

12
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:46.711
Game, when I receive game start,
we'll go ahead and

13
00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:49.522
have that actually do the setup motion.

14
00:00:49.522 --> 00:00:55.279
So now, when we hit the green flag,
we'll just broadcast game start.

15
00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:57.785
&gt;&gt; And then you can add things to it.

16
00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:00.884
You can add things like starting things or
whatever.

17
00:01:00.884 --> 00:01:04.897
Like what the game's called or-
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

18
00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:07.102
you can have a start screen
that they see beforehand.

19
00:01:07.102 --> 00:01:09.185
&gt;&gt; Like how to play the game or something.

20
00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:09.805
&gt;&gt; Exactly, you have instructions.

21
00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:15.183
&gt;&gt; Just like what I did with
one of my games except at so

22
00:01:15.183 --> 00:01:18.184
many broadcasts It just got stuck.

23
00:01:18.184 --> 00:01:20.964
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,
you have performance issues.

24
00:01:20.964 --> 00:01:26.356
&gt;&gt; It was so complex that it
had trouble on performing it,

25
00:01:26.356 --> 00:01:30.313
it kind of just got stuck on things
&gt;&gt; There are,

26
00:01:30.313 --> 00:01:34.453
as a side note, there's the scratch
add-ons and the Chrome extension.

27
00:01:34.453 --> 00:01:38.983
And you could actually enable performance
tools and debugging and all bunch of other

28
00:01:38.983 --> 00:01:42.898
stuff in here as well and like modify and
get a whole bunch of other stuff.

29
00:01:42.898 --> 00:01:47.451
We could actually triage
those things as well.

30
00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:48.424
So let's see.

31
00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:53.917
We don't actually want it to,
Stop all just yet,

32
00:01:53.917 --> 00:01:57.526
because that will actually literally
stop the script, so get rid of that.

33
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:04.324
And what we can do is, we could say,
when everyone gets a game over,

34
00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:05.870
they all hide, right?

35
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.451
And so we've got a game start.

36
00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:14.744
And so now for everyone involved,
Pico knows about this already.

37
00:02:14.744 --> 00:02:18.440
And when he gets a game over,
we're going to hide him.

38
00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:25.810
When we get a game start,
we're gonna show him.

39
00:02:28.427 --> 00:02:30.594
Now, we could create clones and
stuff like that as well.

40
00:02:30.594 --> 00:02:35.370
I think this will get most of the trick
done without getting too in the weeds.

41
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.675
So game over will hide them,
game start will show them.

42
00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:40.306
Go to the snake.

43
00:02:40.306 --> 00:02:44.513
Start out by hiding the snake,
cause that's not playing yet either.

44
00:02:44.513 --> 00:02:47.008
And when the game starts, we'll show it.

45
00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:51.693
Actually, we can,
This part doesn't really matter

46
00:02:51.693 --> 00:02:53.123
'cause it's about when the game starts.

47
00:02:53.123 --> 00:02:55.695
So actually we'll see if I regret that.

48
00:02:55.695 --> 00:03:01.298
When I receive Game start, we'll show,

49
00:03:01.298 --> 00:03:09.476
and when I receive, Game Over, we'll hide.

50
00:03:13.088 --> 00:03:14.982
It might want to add a stop
the script in there as well.

51
00:03:14.982 --> 00:03:16.236
We'll find out in a second.

52
00:03:16.236 --> 00:03:19.171
Let's just get all the mechanics working.

53
00:03:19.171 --> 00:03:21.940
So we'll show the game over.

54
00:03:24.213 --> 00:03:25.895
Or hide it when the game starts again.

55
00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:37.974
And then we can wait for like an S key or

56
00:03:37.974 --> 00:03:40.495
something like that to
start the game over again.

57
00:03:40.495 --> 00:03:44.337
I can do that only one game over is
currently set, or I can just let them

58
00:03:44.337 --> 00:03:48.845
restart whenever in case they're like I
would like to start from the beginning,

59
00:03:48.845 --> 00:03:50.058
let's go with that.

60
00:03:50.058 --> 00:03:57.125
So let's see, We could do a loop in there.

61
00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:58.025
There's a bunch of ways I could do this.

62
00:03:58.025 --> 00:03:59.108
I'm going to try this out.

63
00:04:05.722 --> 00:04:07.898
Yeah, we could keep track of whether
the game has started or stopped.

64
00:04:07.898 --> 00:04:09.241
I'm not going to do any of that.

65
00:04:09.241 --> 00:04:11.625
We'll just say, if they hit the button,

66
00:04:11.625 --> 00:04:14.977
it will give them the ability
to start the game over again.

67
00:04:14.977 --> 00:04:17.239
I think I'm gonna keep it
as its own thing, though.

68
00:04:21.254 --> 00:04:22.642
Not space bar, though.

69
00:04:22.642 --> 00:04:25.676
When A key is pressed,
we're gonna broadcast Game Start.

70
00:04:25.676 --> 00:04:28.897
All right, let's try this out.

71
00:04:28.897 --> 00:04:32.361
I might have to debug a few seconds,
but let's see.

72
00:04:32.361 --> 00:04:36.769
All right, and so
hopefully he gets hit, game over.

73
00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:38.376
Everything vanishes, right?

74
00:04:38.376 --> 00:04:44.039
I could even change the backdrop if I
wanted to, to something that makes sense.

75
00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.483
Did we end up stopping all though?

76
00:04:47.483 --> 00:04:48.420
Let's see.

77
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.101
I think we gotta stop the script though.

78
00:04:54.826 --> 00:04:57.240
Because otherwise you see
that loop is still running.

79
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.170
So let's go ahead and stop all this,
also stop this script or

80
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.078
stop other scripts in this sprite.

81
00:05:05.078 --> 00:05:06.053
Let's go with that.

82
00:05:09.462 --> 00:05:11.263
Let's do that here as well.

83
00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:20.509
Let's see if that changes things for me.

84
00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:22.449
All right, get hit.

85
00:05:25.972 --> 00:05:28.279
When I hit game over, we'll show.

86
00:05:30.706 --> 00:05:32.993
Clear so far.

87
00:05:32.993 --> 00:05:37.345
I might have to debug it for a second but
we'll figure out can you start with Hi

88
00:05:37.345 --> 00:05:46.796
game over we receive, It worked.

89
00:05:46.796 --> 00:05:50.267
I was just hitting essence that because
I wasn't looking at my keyboard.

90
00:05:50.267 --> 00:05:53.165
So now we have the ability we could
put a message in there as well.

91
00:05:53.165 --> 00:05:56.596
So we get hit a will start
the game over again.

92
00:05:56.596 --> 00:05:59.661
So now you don't have to constantly go
the flag starting stopping start to put

93
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:01.372
different mechanics for levels in there.

94
00:06:01.372 --> 00:06:03.217
You could show different things so for

95
00:06:03.217 --> 00:06:05.994
instance I've got a backdrop
where the ground is black.

96
00:06:05.994 --> 00:06:10.919
I could theoretically switch
backdrops based on levels, right?

97
00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:15.263
You also in the dinosaur game after a
certain score 500 or so like pterodactyls

98
00:06:15.263 --> 00:06:15.785
&gt;&gt; 200.

99
00:06:15.785 --> 00:06:21.633
&gt;&gt; 200, but isn't there at a certain
point it changes tonight to?

100
00:06:21.633 --> 00:06:25.115
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there's like various
different things you can trigger so

101
00:06:25.115 --> 00:06:29.096
you're not just bound by the green flag
to start and the red stop sign to stop.

102
00:06:29.096 --> 00:06:30.784
You can just stop a loop.

103
00:06:30.784 --> 00:06:33.101
But then you can also use
the messages to restart it.

104
00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.340
You can do different stages.

105
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.563
Is and trigger stuff so
you can begin to like slowly build.

106
00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:40.345
That's why we're kind of going for
like a wide range of different techniques.

107
00:06:40.345 --> 00:06:44.285
And then depending on the game, you're
building the mechanic you want to do,

108
00:06:44.285 --> 00:06:48.240
you can kind of like snap different pieces
of this together in different ways.

109
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.505
For the most part, they're like,

110
00:06:49.505 --> 00:06:52.543
let's talk about ways we could extend this
way before like we have different costumes

111
00:06:52.543 --> 00:06:54.876
so every time it starts over,
it's maybe of a different height.

112
00:06:54.876 --> 00:06:58.567
I chose the snake which is there wasn't a
lot of options there, but I could choose,

113
00:06:58.567 --> 00:07:01.167
like, I could make a cactus
sprite of different heights.

114
00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:02.952
You saw my little angry,

115
00:07:02.952 --> 00:07:07.287
angry little stone things that
I was using in a previous one.

116
00:07:07.287 --> 00:07:10.383
You could have could rotate
a random costume every time.

117
00:07:10.383 --> 00:07:12.234
You could have it speed up over time.

118
00:07:12.234 --> 00:07:14.340
A lot of the mechanics that we've
done in the previous games...

119
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.192
I could redo them here.

120
00:07:16.192 --> 00:07:17.809
But you can sort of put them all.

121
00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:20.433
You could actually maybe at
some point have to show up.

122
00:07:20.433 --> 00:07:24.745
It's up to you, and you should play tests,
and you should figure out what works best

123
00:07:24.745 --> 00:07:27.800
for you and should definitely
explore some of that as well.
