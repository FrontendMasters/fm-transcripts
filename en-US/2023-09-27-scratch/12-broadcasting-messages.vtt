1
00:00:00.432 --> 00:00:04.114
We're gonna take a few different things
we talked about from the original link

2
00:00:04.114 --> 00:00:05.074
a little, I guess.

3
00:00:05.074 --> 00:00:08.954
The one we had with cheese puffs and
an apple, and a little bit with, like we

4
00:00:08.954 --> 00:00:13.465
saw the broadcasting before and messages,
we talked about that, and we saw a module.

5
00:00:13.465 --> 00:00:16.040
We're gonna kind of pull some
of those concepts together, and

6
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.313
let you play around with that.

7
00:00:17.313 --> 00:00:20.708
You can either go to that
very first thing we did with,

8
00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:23.128
in our case right now is cheese puffs.

9
00:00:23.128 --> 00:00:24.032
Could be anything.

10
00:00:24.032 --> 00:00:25.742
I have a version down here.

11
00:00:25.742 --> 00:00:29.832
In any given Scratch project,
we can go in and remix it as well.

12
00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:33.223
I'm gonna use just one that
we had earlier, but again,

13
00:00:33.223 --> 00:00:36.918
there is a starter here if you
don't have that one, either.

14
00:00:36.918 --> 00:00:39.683
So, this is again some of
the initial code that we had.

15
00:00:39.683 --> 00:00:42.796
What I want to do is, like I said before,
bunches of what you can make.

16
00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:45.774
You can make games, you could also
make full interactive stories.

17
00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:47.485
That when the green flag is clicked,

18
00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:50.850
it starts off a story where maybe one
character walks in says something,

19
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.850
the other character waits,
then does the other thing, right?

20
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.397
So there's gonna be a certain amount
of like notified, you can try to

21
00:00:57.397 --> 00:01:01.986
get the timing perfect, where everything's
always just the precise amount of time, or

22
00:01:01.986 --> 00:01:05.377
you can have various messages get
broadcast, so on and so forth.

23
00:01:05.377 --> 00:01:08.170
So if, for instance,

24
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.204
we wanted to have the cheese
puffs respond back.

25
00:01:14.204 --> 00:01:18.943
So let's say when I click Arnold,
he says something, right?

26
00:01:18.943 --> 00:01:22.599
And then, when Arnold responds,

27
00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:27.272
then I want the opposite to happen, right?

28
00:01:27.272 --> 00:01:27.897
And so, or

29
00:01:27.897 --> 00:01:32.426
like I want the cheese puffs to respond
after Arnold is done talking, right?

30
00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:35.154
But Arnold can't control the cheese puffs,

31
00:01:35.154 --> 00:01:37.820
all Arnold could do is
broadcast a message.

32
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.360
So, let's see how that plays out.

33
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.035
So we'll go over here, and we'll say,
we'll just throw at a different event.

34
00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:45.309
We'll say, when this Sprite is clicked

35
00:01:47.756 --> 00:01:52.827
We'll say, hello for two seconds.

36
00:01:52.827 --> 00:01:55.955
One Mississippi, two Mississippi great.

37
00:01:55.955 --> 00:02:00.983
But now I want the cheese puffs to
respond, because what's the point

38
00:02:00.983 --> 00:02:05.417
of talking to cheese puffs if
they don't talk back, right?

39
00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:10.133
So what we would do here is, we go ahead
and we go into these events, which is,

40
00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:14.138
say hello for two seconds,
then we gonna broadcast the message.

41
00:02:14.138 --> 00:02:19.919
And I'm gonna add a new message saying,

42
00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.816
Arnold said hello.

43
00:02:22.816 --> 00:02:24.609
You can call whatever you want, right?

44
00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.031
It doesn't matter.

45
00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:29.400
Cool, so then what we're gonna do is,
you're gonna say hello for

46
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.069
two seconds, and then we are going to
broadcast the message to the rest of

47
00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.079
the sprites that haven't said hello.

48
00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.933
Here's the thing that
broadcasts a message.

49
00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:41.772
If you broadcast a message and nobody's
listening, it doesn't matter, right?

50
00:02:41.772 --> 00:02:45.190
Our event's firing the DOM all the time.

51
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.137
So then, we need to program the opposite,
which is,

52
00:02:49.137 --> 00:02:53.893
when the cheese puffs hear the message,
they respond, right?

53
00:02:53.893 --> 00:02:58.589
What should the cheese puffs respond with?

54
00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:59.143
Yes.

55
00:02:59.143 --> 00:03:01.019
&gt;&gt; I'm Puffy.

56
00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.268
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I'm puffy, all right.

57
00:03:04.268 --> 00:03:08.833
The cheese puffs will respond with,
I'm puffy.

58
00:03:08.833 --> 00:03:14.517
Cool, so we'll go to the cheese puffs now,
and we'll say, when I receive,

59
00:03:14.517 --> 00:03:19.512
Arnold said hello, we'll have them
respond back, say, I am puffy

60
00:03:22.654 --> 00:03:26.798
For two seconds.

61
00:03:26.798 --> 00:03:28.934
Cool, so let's try it out.

62
00:03:28.934 --> 00:03:30.024
We'll click on Arnold.

63
00:03:30.024 --> 00:03:32.174
Hello?

64
00:03:32.174 --> 00:03:34.132
I am Puffy.

65
00:03:34.132 --> 00:03:36.963
Right, so it's a way to like create
interaction between two sprites by

66
00:03:36.963 --> 00:03:38.013
broadcasting a message.

67
00:03:38.013 --> 00:03:44.075
This could be, okay, if Evad catches Dave,
broadcast game over, right?

68
00:03:44.075 --> 00:03:47.543
And throw a game over screen, which is
a sprite that just overlays everything,

69
00:03:47.543 --> 00:03:48.750
it says game over, right?

70
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.436
Or if Dave eats ten tacos,
broadcast you win.

71
00:03:52.436 --> 00:03:55.670
You win sprite, placed over the cat, well,

72
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.261
I should do that in a later game,
so don't worry.

73
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:02.572
But there's various uses for
building a story.

74
00:04:02.572 --> 00:04:05.977
For maybe if you wanna have buttons
that do different things you can do,

75
00:04:05.977 --> 00:04:09.864
when the button is clicked, start the
game, instead of the green flag, right?

76
00:04:09.864 --> 00:04:12.746
So there's an initial screen, there's
all sorts of stuff that you can do.

77
00:04:12.746 --> 00:04:16.159
But to do this, you need to kind of
announce things to all the sprites, and

78
00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:19.314
they can listen for those things,
and react accordingly, right?

79
00:04:19.314 --> 00:04:21.812
But you both need to send a message, and

80
00:04:21.812 --> 00:04:24.937
you need sprites that
are ready to receive them.
