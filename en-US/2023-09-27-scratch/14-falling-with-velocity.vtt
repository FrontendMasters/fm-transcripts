00:00:00.541 --> 00:00:05.757
The other thing that we have
in a lot of games is some

2
00:00:05.757 --> 00:00:11.486
idea of what I will very
loosely call physics, right?

3
00:00:11.486 --> 00:00:15.870
Something that makes the game feel right.

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.382
So let's go ahead and make a new project.

5
00:00:23.486 --> 00:00:29.331
And in our new project, we're going to,
let's make a new sprite as well.

6
00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:31.733
We're gonna need something
that falls from the sky.

7
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:32.308
&gt;&gt; Apple.

8
00:00:32.308 --> 00:00:33.370
&gt;&gt; Apple, love it.

9
00:00:36.073 --> 00:00:39.278
Apple, big fans of the apples around here.

10
00:00:39.278 --> 00:00:44.674
Let's make this a little bit smaller for
reasons that you will see in a little bit.

11
00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:49.127
And so what we wanna make the apple do
is we wanna make it fall from the sky.

12
00:00:49.127 --> 00:00:52.123
Let's get Arnold out of here for
a little bit.

13
00:00:52.123 --> 00:00:55.054
Wanna make our apple fall from the sky,
and

14
00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:58.480
you could theoretically
do something like this.

15
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:06.571
So, When you say when it's clicked,
what we just wanna do is change forever.

16
00:01:09.682 --> 00:01:12.898
Or until it hits the ground, but
forever in our case, cuz Scratch won't let

17
00:01:12.898 --> 00:01:16.332
anything go into oblivion, it'll just
kinda stop it when it gets to the bottom.

18
00:01:16.332 --> 00:01:19.220
So forever,
what we wanna do is we wanna change why,

19
00:01:22.454 --> 00:01:26.342
By negative,
1 might be too slow, let's see.

20
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.804
Little bit too slow, right?

21
00:01:31.804 --> 00:01:36.484
Let's also have something where it goes
back to the beginning every time so

22
00:01:36.484 --> 00:01:38.801
I don't have to move it cuz I am lazy.

23
00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:43.577
And so we'll say,
when the green flag is 6,

24
00:01:43.577 --> 00:01:49.126
go back up to the top and
fall a little bit too slowly.

25
00:01:49.126 --> 00:01:52.256
We can give it full at 10 maybe, again,
it's negative if we want it to fall.

26
00:01:55.226 --> 00:01:57.614
And that works, right?

27
00:01:57.614 --> 00:02:02.836
But that's not how falling
works in real life, right?

28
00:02:02.836 --> 00:02:09.708
Generally speaking, on earth, at least,
we have this thing called velocity, right?

29
00:02:09.708 --> 00:02:11.522
Which is something starts falling,

30
00:02:11.522 --> 00:02:15.390
it's kinda like somebody who's probably
speeds up as he goes along, right?

31
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.335
That's to say if you were to get in a car
and put your foot on the gas pedal,

32
00:02:19.335 --> 00:02:22.784
the car starts at zero and
gets progressively faster, right?

33
00:02:22.784 --> 00:02:26.188
You can throw something up in the air,
when it hits the highest point,

34
00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:29.936
it will start to come down, but as it
falls, it speeds up faster and faster and

35
00:02:29.936 --> 00:02:31.859
faster and faster and faster, right?

36
00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.013
And so
we can do something like that as well and

37
00:02:35.013 --> 00:02:39.994
kinda create mechanics in our game
that feel a little bit more natural.

38
00:02:39.994 --> 00:02:44.194
To do that, we will need a variable, and

39
00:02:44.194 --> 00:02:49.149
let's change this, let's call it velocity.

40
00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:52.106
You can call it speed if you want to,
it's up to you, whatever you wanna type.

41
00:02:52.106 --> 00:02:54.180
&gt;&gt; Set variables.

42
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.286
&gt;&gt; What's that?

43
00:02:55.286 --> 00:02:59.639
&gt;&gt; Set variable to 10 to start?

44
00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.070
&gt;&gt; Sure,
let me just check something real quick.

45
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.928
I'm gonna make it, again, only for

46
00:03:04.928 --> 00:03:08.815
this sprite for
reasons that I will need later on.

47
00:03:08.815 --> 00:03:12.028
Future me, it's gonna want it only for
this sprite.

48
00:03:12.028 --> 00:03:14.840
Okay, so
now you can see this one's only for

49
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.170
this sprite cuz it's Apple: velocity,
right, which means it's for the apple.

50
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.763
And so when the game starts,

51
00:03:22.763 --> 00:03:27.963
we'll set velocity to 0 cuz
it's not falling just yet.

52
00:03:27.963 --> 00:03:33.760
And when we change it,
we wanna change by the velocity.

53
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.999
I could set it to 1,
you get the point, right?

54
00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:39.410
Something, right, some base amount.

55
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.366
We want -1.

56
00:03:45.383 --> 00:03:49.915
And it will fall, but we want this concept
of it getting faster over time, right?

57
00:03:49.915 --> 00:03:55.226
And so now that we can store the current
speed and we can change it, what we

58
00:03:55.226 --> 00:04:01.341
can do is say, okay, I change it but then
also change the velocity by another -1.

59
00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:06.274
So it starts out in this case as -1,
then it's become -2, -3,

60
00:04:06.274 --> 00:04:08.757
-4, so on and so forth, right?

61
00:04:08.757 --> 00:04:12.712
Could we implement the idea of terminal
velocity, which is eventually when

62
00:04:12.712 --> 00:04:16.930
things are falling, they get to a certain
max speed, they don't go any faster?

63
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.534
We could do that, we might do it.

64
00:04:19.534 --> 00:04:21.887
I was like we won't, but
I'm like maybe we will.

65
00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:27.746
So now, as you can see, it feels a little
bit more natural where it hits the bottom,

66
00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:30.362
but it starts to speed up as it falls.

67
00:04:30.362 --> 00:04:36.891
It looks all right, already a little
bit more normal in this case.

68
00:04:36.891 --> 00:04:41.558
And if you're too fast,
I could say -0.5, right,

69
00:04:41.558 --> 00:04:46.337
it'll still get that same effect,
but at a slower rate.

70
00:04:46.337 --> 00:04:48.182
And that number will keep going up,
but we don't really care.

71
00:04:51.137 --> 00:04:55.305
And so down it goes, over and
over and over again.

72
00:04:55.305 --> 00:04:57.688
But it does speed up along the way, right?

73
00:04:57.688 --> 00:05:02.177
And those mechanics work a lot, if you
play a game where the character is running

74
00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:05.929
forward, and as soon as you take
your finger off the right button,

75
00:05:05.929 --> 00:05:10.291
it comes to a complete stop, that doesn't
feel natural and normal in games.

76
00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:12.886
It's a lot of those things where we start
to feel it over time in these games.

77
00:05:12.886 --> 00:05:16.120
So having some of those kind of natural
physics that we come to expect, not only

78
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.568
from real life but also from every other
video game we've ever played in our lives.

79
00:05:19.568 --> 00:05:23.917
Trying to get some of those mechanics in
here as well will make our games feel

80
00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:26.140
a little bit more normal and natural.
