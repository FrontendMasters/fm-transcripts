1
00:00:00.148 --> 00:00:04.777
One of the things to keep in mind, I'm
gonna change the backdrop for one moment.

2
00:00:04.777 --> 00:00:08.627
I know we like the basketball, but
I'm gonna change it to make a point.

3
00:00:08.627 --> 00:00:13.174
And we're gonna change it to this X,
Y grid.

4
00:00:13.174 --> 00:00:17.016
This is how direction works in Scratch.

5
00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:22.032
So your Scratch, Canvas,
Stage, what have you,

6
00:00:22.032 --> 00:00:26.825
is 480, let's say, pixels, just 480.

7
00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:32.513
Doesn't matter what it is,
480 wide and 360 tall, right?

8
00:00:32.513 --> 00:00:36.827
And in the middle,
in the center, is location 0, 0.

9
00:00:36.827 --> 00:00:40.960
So X is horizontal, Y is vertical.

10
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.732
So if you wanted to, right now,

11
00:00:43.732 --> 00:00:48.159
you can see over here that
we are at x of 0 and y of 0.

12
00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:54.831
If I made this 100, and we zoom back out,
you can see that he moved 100.

13
00:00:54.831 --> 00:01:00.519
If I make this negative 100,
it's the other direction.

14
00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:06.858
So negative is to the left, positive
is to the right, 0, 0 is the center.

15
00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:11.466
The same is true of the y, which is up and

16
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:16.093
down, so 100y, it goes up 100.

17
00:01:17.723 --> 00:01:23.972
0 in the center, -100 is down.

18
00:01:23.972 --> 00:01:28.476
So for instance, if we wanna have some
idea of gravity, we want them to go down,

19
00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:31.728
so negative numbers, and
then positive numbers are up.

20
00:01:31.728 --> 00:01:34.882
We've got 180, so each direction.

21
00:01:34.882 --> 00:01:38.564
So 180 positive, 180 negative,
cuz that times 2 is 360.

22
00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:39.666
Yay, math.

23
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.635
And then 240 in each direction
gives you the 480, all right?

24
00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:47.158
And so just understanding how direction
works, if you needed to go diagonal,

25
00:01:47.158 --> 00:01:49.911
then you'd have to do up 100x, up 100y.

26
00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:54.872
So, we'll show how to use some of
the movement blocks in one second.

27
00:01:54.872 --> 00:01:58.215
Actually, let's put this back at 0,
0, and I'll show you.

28
00:01:58.215 --> 00:02:00.430
We could do something like-

29
00:02:03.408 --> 00:02:07.066
Throw the green flag in here,
zoom in just a little bit.

30
00:02:09.348 --> 00:02:14.212
When the green flag is clicked,
we can say, for

31
00:02:14.212 --> 00:02:20.156
instance, go to, 100,

32
00:02:20.156 --> 00:02:25.219
100, and then Arnold goes up 100,

33
00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:28.267
and to the right 100.

34
00:02:28.267 --> 00:02:34.034
If we wanted him to go backwards, we could
say, positive 100, but negative on the X.

35
00:02:34.034 --> 00:02:39.354
And so he's gonna end up in
that other corner, right?

36
00:02:39.354 --> 00:02:42.453
The other thing to kind
of keep in mind is,

37
00:02:42.453 --> 00:02:45.654
Arnold is facing the direction right now.

38
00:02:45.654 --> 00:02:50.592
If you look down here, if you know
degrees and angles, it's great,

39
00:02:50.592 --> 00:02:55.997
if you don't, you can just twist
this thing, and there he goes.

40
00:02:55.997 --> 00:03:02.365
I could do that all day, and I won't
because there's people watching me.

41
00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:04.410
Right now he's facing, 91 degrees.

42
00:03:06.514 --> 00:03:08.278
There we go, 90.

43
00:03:08.278 --> 00:03:14.271
And so move, in this case, there's a move.

44
00:03:14.271 --> 00:03:16.227
Where is it?
Move 10 steps will be,

45
00:03:16.227 --> 00:03:19.170
move 10 in whatever way Arnold is facing.

46
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.036
So right now he's facing right.

47
00:03:21.036 --> 00:03:26.997
So if I say go to -100,
x negative 100, y positive 100.

48
00:03:26.997 --> 00:03:29.057
We'll go there, and
then he will move 10 steps.

49
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.084
We got the basics of movement in place.

50
00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:38.964
So you have a bunch of different options.

51
00:03:38.964 --> 00:03:40.694
You can also say this is when
the green flag is clicked.

52
00:03:40.694 --> 00:03:43.650
Like I said before, you've got
these options for different keys.

53
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.910
So for instance, we could say, hey,
when the green flag is clicked,

54
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.524
we're gonna go to that initial position.

55
00:03:50.524 --> 00:03:55.380
And then every time they hit
the right arrow, that's gonna be-

56
00:03:58.144 --> 00:04:01.352
When we move our character, right?

57
00:04:01.352 --> 00:04:03.484
Green flag, he goes back, right?

58
00:04:03.484 --> 00:04:08.356
So whenever these events happen,
those pieces of code underneath

59
00:04:08.356 --> 00:04:12.102
the big yellow hat block will go ahead and
execute.

60
00:04:12.102 --> 00:04:14.960
So this is whenever the green flag is
clicked, moving back to restarted.

61
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.480
Whenever the right arrow key is pressed,
we'll move ten steps.

62
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.760
Start and move.

63
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.047
I'm gonna give you a second,
I'm gonna pause, and

64
00:04:26.047 --> 00:04:30.249
your job is to make Arnold
go the other way, right?

65
00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:34.559
Cuz right now,
he will run face first into the wall, and

66
00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:38.237
that's not gonna, you know, now he's hurt.

67
00:04:38.237 --> 00:04:39.908
Now his face is pressed
up against the wall.

68
00:04:39.908 --> 00:04:41.852
I can keep it in the right arrow,
nothing happens.

69
00:04:41.852 --> 00:04:45.397
So take a few minutes and let's try to
make him go left, just to kind of get

70
00:04:45.397 --> 00:04:48.668
a feel for everything, and
get our sea legs, you know what I mean?

71
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.613
Awesome, so our mission was, we got Arnold
going right, we wanna make him go left.

72
00:04:59.613 --> 00:05:04.293
And so let's find a bunch of ways that
this will technically do what we asked it

73
00:05:04.293 --> 00:05:08.544
to do, but possibly not in the way
that we intended it to do it, right?

74
00:05:08.544 --> 00:05:12.618
Because like I said,
they'll do what you want for now, but

75
00:05:12.618 --> 00:05:17.852
generally speaking, maybe not always
the way that you wanted it to happen.

76
00:05:17.852 --> 00:05:20.100
I think there's a life lesson in there,
somewhere.

77
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.277
So we'll say left arrow, and we will say,

78
00:05:24.277 --> 00:05:28.698
we'll go move negative 10 steps, right?

79
00:05:28.698 --> 00:05:31.751
Cuz that should be our
understanding of X and Y.

80
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:35.197
So negative will hit the green arrow.

81
00:05:35.197 --> 00:05:37.033
All right, he goes right.

82
00:05:37.033 --> 00:05:41.442
He moves left, but
this leaves something to be desired.

83
00:05:41.442 --> 00:05:43.851
It looks like he's moonwalking, right?

84
00:05:43.851 --> 00:05:46.529
Ideally, most of us do not walk backwards

85
00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:51.282
when we go in the other direction most
of the time, we tend to turn around.

86
00:05:51.282 --> 00:05:55.441
Otherwise there's great
risk to bodily injury.

87
00:05:55.441 --> 00:05:57.627
So we knew that we had direction before.

88
00:05:57.627 --> 00:06:04.647
So theoretically, I should be able to set
a direction if he turns around, right?

89
00:06:04.647 --> 00:06:06.837
So let's do that.

90
00:06:06.837 --> 00:06:11.333
And so we'll say point in direction.

91
00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:15.160
And if you don't remember the numbers,
if you just click on the number in

92
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.569
a direction block, you can go ahead and
you can turn it, right?

93
00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:23.645
So now, Arnold should turn the other

94
00:06:23.645 --> 00:06:28.728
way if and when we hit the left arrow.

95
00:06:28.728 --> 00:06:31.365
Everything's gonna go great.

96
00:06:31.365 --> 00:06:35.360
He walks right, haven't go left.

97
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.797
Well, okay,
first of all it looks like now,

98
00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:41.464
we need to move positive ten, but
that's not our biggest problem.

99
00:06:41.464 --> 00:06:45.212
So let's change that to a positive ten.

100
00:06:45.212 --> 00:06:46.735
What's the problem with Arnold right now?

101
00:06:46.735 --> 00:06:50.582
Can anyone- [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; He's standing on the roof, or on his

102
00:06:50.582 --> 00:06:56.489
head, it's unclear at this moment, cuz he
lives in a grid of emptiness and sadness.

103
00:06:56.489 --> 00:07:01.107
But that is probably not what we wanted,
and also, I'm hitting the right arrow now.

104
00:07:01.107 --> 00:07:03.668
You can see that the yellow
code is flashing.

105
00:07:03.668 --> 00:07:06.680
So it looks like I also need to put him
back, but we've got bigger problems.

106
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.315
The act of putting him back is not
gonna solve all my issues, but

107
00:07:09.315 --> 00:07:10.774
let's at least get that in place.

108
00:07:10.774 --> 00:07:12.787
We'll drag them in there.

109
00:07:12.787 --> 00:07:15.791
We'll hit the green flag to put him back.

110
00:07:15.791 --> 00:07:19.467
Everything's great,
everything's in topsy turvy world.

111
00:07:19.467 --> 00:07:23.178
There's an easy way to fix this,
which is, if we go and

112
00:07:23.178 --> 00:07:28.042
we have the direction, you can see
there's a bunch of different ways.

113
00:07:28.042 --> 00:07:30.288
There's like, yo,
don't let him turn it all.

114
00:07:30.288 --> 00:07:33.118
There's also left, right.

115
00:07:33.118 --> 00:07:36.870
And so now if we set it to left right,
we hit the green arrow.

116
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.790
He goes this way, he goes this way,
he goes this way, he goes this way,

117
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.442
everything is better.

118
00:07:43.442 --> 00:07:48.828
One of the things that you will commonly
see in a Scratch project though is,

119
00:07:48.828 --> 00:07:51.322
people can change stuff, right?

120
00:07:51.322 --> 00:07:56.195
And so a lot of times when the green flag
is clicked is a great time to set up your

121
00:07:56.195 --> 00:07:57.581
game again, right?

122
00:07:57.581 --> 00:08:01.990
And so, for instance, that's when we
put them at negative 100, positive 100.

123
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:07.491
We can also say,
set rotation style, left, or right?

124
00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:09.906
One of the things I
wanna point out too is,

125
00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:13.365
for a lot of these things which
makes the setup a lot easier.

126
00:08:13.365 --> 00:08:17.775
Notice I just moved him to
apparently 34 Negative 13,

127
00:08:17.775 --> 00:08:21.380
it's important, but
if you actually look at-

128
00:08:24.372 --> 00:08:30.189
You look at the blocks now that,
the default there is 34, -13, 34, -14.

129
00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:32.686
A lot of these will be set
to wherever he currently is.

130
00:08:32.686 --> 00:08:35.648
So a lot of times,
you don't necessarily need to remember.

131
00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:37.381
You're gonna put Arnold the way
you want him to be, and

132
00:08:37.381 --> 00:08:39.338
n the way you want him to be in
the way that you want them to be, or

133
00:08:39.338 --> 00:08:39.998
any Sprite really.

134
00:08:39.998 --> 00:08:43.733
And then all of these movement ones,
the defaults, now you can change it to

135
00:08:43.733 --> 00:08:47.904
whatever you want, but by default, they'll
be wherever the Sprite is right now.

136
00:08:47.904 --> 00:08:50.908
So, out of the box, we'll say,
when the green flag is clicked and

137
00:08:50.908 --> 00:08:54.235
gotta set up our project, we will set
the rotations of the left and right,

138
00:08:54.235 --> 00:08:56.509
we'll move them to where
they are supposed to go.

139
00:08:56.509 --> 00:09:01.439
So we have a little bit of confidence
that everything will behave

140
00:09:01.439 --> 00:09:03.184
as it's supposed to.

141
00:09:03.184 --> 00:09:07.611
The only thing that I would probably
change about this at this point would be,

142
00:09:07.611 --> 00:09:09.460
it'd be nice if the legs moved.

143
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.917
You know?

144
00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:12.746
So we can do that too.

145
00:09:12.746 --> 00:09:16.400
This is under Looks,
where we've got a whole bunch of options.

146
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.565
You can make them say stuff,
that is the visual say stuff,

147
00:09:19.565 --> 00:09:22.674
because as you know,
the one after that doesn't exist.

148
00:09:22.674 --> 00:09:26.026
That will, like, say, we'll just go
there forever, or you have it wait for

149
00:09:26.026 --> 00:09:26.863
like two seconds.

150
00:09:26.863 --> 00:09:30.742
You can also switch to a particular
costume, but in this case, what

151
00:09:30.742 --> 00:09:35.524
we're gonna do is just switch to the next
costume, cuz there are only two, right?

152
00:09:35.524 --> 00:09:37.263
One foot forward, the other foot forward.

153
00:09:37.263 --> 00:09:40.811
So if we just switch,
rotate to the next costume every time,

154
00:09:40.811 --> 00:09:44.021
we should be able to kind of
create a walking movement.

155
00:09:44.021 --> 00:09:45.608
And we've got a little
bit of animation now.

156
00:09:45.608 --> 00:09:48.424
If you wanted to,
if you're making your own Sprite,

157
00:09:48.424 --> 00:09:50.731
you might choose to have more than two,
right?

158
00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:52.710
There might like the more
you have in between,

159
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.448
the more fluid the motion is going to be.

160
00:09:54.448 --> 00:09:58.932
And for a lot of these things, we need to
do what's called play testing, which is,

161
00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.096
yeah, it's great.

162
00:10:00.096 --> 00:10:03.134
Which is, you have to play your game,
which makes this workshop very hard to

163
00:10:03.134 --> 00:10:05.902
prepare for because I don't want to
tell you how long I played Snake.

164
00:10:05.902 --> 00:10:09.831
It's not important, I had a high score.

165
00:10:09.831 --> 00:10:13.246
And so now he moves,
you can add more movements.

166
00:10:13.246 --> 00:10:14.796
Like I said, I'm gonna leave.

167
00:10:14.796 --> 00:10:18.297
There'll be one or two times when
we make our own Sprites today, but

168
00:10:18.297 --> 00:10:21.062
I know that I will spend
several hours tweaking them,

169
00:10:21.062 --> 00:10:24.021
and they'll each become more
horrifying than the last.

170
00:10:24.021 --> 00:10:26.704
So, a lot of times we'll
use bulk ones in there,

171
00:10:26.704 --> 00:10:29.788
but you can play without that
in between things as well.

172
00:10:29.788 --> 00:10:38.094
And so
now we've got the ability to move around.
