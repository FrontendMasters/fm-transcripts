1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.581
let's look at one more thing,
which is there.

2
00:00:06.581 --> 00:00:08.637
We saw variables before to
keep track of the score.

3
00:00:08.637 --> 00:00:09.950
There's this other one over here.

4
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.266
We'll talk about blocks in a little bit.

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:14.704
There's this other one
here called make a list.

6
00:00:14.704 --> 00:00:15.409
Right?

7
00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:20.162
And that is simply you know, for those,
for those of you who have dabbled in

8
00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:24.252
the JavaScript programming
language before An array, right?

9
00:00:24.252 --> 00:00:25.932
And those are useful.

10
00:00:25.932 --> 00:00:29.044
There's no objects, so
that'll bite us later, don't worry.

11
00:00:29.044 --> 00:00:33.005
We can make a list and
again, this can be for

12
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:38.193
this sprite only, or
it can be for all sprites, right?

13
00:00:38.193 --> 00:00:40.461
I'm gonna say for
this sprite only for now,

14
00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:43.169
and I'm doing this apparently
on the cheese buffs.

15
00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:44.338
Let's go for it.

16
00:00:44.338 --> 00:00:46.205
Why not?

17
00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:48.636
List name is catchphrases.

18
00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.338
Catchphrases, okay?

19
00:00:55.338 --> 00:00:58.460
So you can see I have these
cheesy puffs catchphrases.

20
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.616
There's nothing in there right now, right?

21
00:01:00.616 --> 00:01:02.290
There's a little plus sign.

22
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.931
What are some of the things
that cheese puffs say?

23
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:10.762
&gt;&gt; I'm cheesy.

24
00:01:10.762 --> 00:01:17.190
&gt;&gt; All right I am Cheesy.

25
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.625
Exclamation point or period?

26
00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:21.855
Is a statement.

27
00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:23.583
&gt;&gt; Exclamation [LAUGH].

28
00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:24.929
&gt;&gt; Exclamation, yeah, it's a good choice.

29
00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.616
&gt;&gt; But three of them.

30
00:01:26.616 --> 00:01:27.788
&gt;&gt; Three exclamation points.

31
00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:29.559
Okay, what else do cheese puff say.

32
00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.999
&gt;&gt; Hello.

33
00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:40.167
&gt;&gt; Hello,
I think with a period a very Hello.

34
00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:40.725
All right.

35
00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:42.729
Any other things that
cheese puffs might say?

36
00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:46.501
&gt;&gt; I am non sentient.

37
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:53.203
&gt;&gt; Okay, the like that they say that I am
non sentient that's not suspicious at all.

38
00:01:53.203 --> 00:01:54.886
No, I am not.

39
00:01:54.886 --> 00:01:59.766
I am totally non sentient about that like
just to make it very clear like in no

40
00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:00.933
way am I sent Dan.

41
00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:06.044
Do anything you want the team
loves to say Now okay,

42
00:02:06.044 --> 00:02:08.700
well three sayings.

43
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.172
But the cheese puff say
I will add one more.

44
00:02:13.172 --> 00:02:18.686
I am totally healthy food.

45
00:02:18.686 --> 00:02:23.977
As long as we got lion cheese puffs, they
might lie about lots of things, right?

46
00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:25.100
Cool.

47
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.508
So now what I want to have
happen when I click on it,

48
00:02:28.508 --> 00:02:32.496
I want it to rotate through
its various settings, right?

49
00:02:32.496 --> 00:02:37.015
So at this point, we're gonna need both
that idea of a modulo from before,

50
00:02:37.015 --> 00:02:39.043
just to get some extra practice.

51
00:02:39.043 --> 00:02:43.086
And then also this idea
of having this list.

52
00:02:43.086 --> 00:02:48.042
So, when we click on Arnold,
it will get the message to say I am puffy,

53
00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:52.074
but when we click on the cheese puffs,
then in this case,

54
00:02:52.074 --> 00:02:55.859
we want it to rotate through
one of his catchphrases.

55
00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.599
So we'll say,
we'll go to these events over here,

56
00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.409
I'll say when this sprite is clicked.

57
00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:03.674
Okay, now what do we do?

58
00:03:03.674 --> 00:03:07.628
How do we,
if I look inside my variables, and

59
00:03:07.628 --> 00:03:11.697
I go to the block,
I can add things to the list.

60
00:03:11.697 --> 00:03:14.378
I can delete one of the things and

61
00:03:14.378 --> 00:03:18.659
get the first thing off
the list to start with that.

62
00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.341
And so we'll say looks And we'll say.

63
00:03:22.341 --> 00:03:27.161
&gt;&gt; The one that you're going

64
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:32.199
to do you pick random one and

65
00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:40.316
the one put pick random
between one to four.

66
00:03:40.316 --> 00:03:40.878
&gt;&gt; Okay.

67
00:03:40.878 --> 00:03:43.467
&gt;&gt; Operators,
&gt;&gt; So we got operators and

68
00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:49.278
we'll say that we want to pick
random between one and four, right?

69
00:03:54.471 --> 00:03:57.610
Problem is, that sometimes I'm
gonna get the same one twice.

70
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.368
All right, so there's a good
good first step for us, right?

71
00:04:00.368 --> 00:04:02.222
But sometimes it's
clicking more than once.

72
00:04:02.222 --> 00:04:04.097
And I'm getting the same thing.

73
00:04:04.097 --> 00:04:06.795
We cool if we can get
it to rotate through.

74
00:04:06.795 --> 00:04:11.739
So the same basic idea, it's like we want
to be able to kind of go through the list,

75
00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:12.248
right?

76
00:04:12.248 --> 00:04:16.118
One of the things we might have to do here
is keep track of where we are, right?

77
00:04:16.118 --> 00:04:19.453
Unfortunately, friends,
there are no for loops.

78
00:04:19.453 --> 00:04:22.416
So we've got to basically
build our own for loop.

79
00:04:22.416 --> 00:04:24.379
The old-fashioned way.

80
00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:29.200
So one thing we can do is we can
say we have a variable here.

81
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.308
We say and we only want it for

82
00:04:31.308 --> 00:04:37.190
this sprite only the cheesy puffs care
about what catchphrase they're on.

83
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.497
What do I call this?

84
00:04:38.497 --> 00:04:43.336
We can call it current, current, current.

85
00:04:43.336 --> 00:04:46.704
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Okay, that doesn't mean anything.

86
00:04:46.704 --> 00:04:49.003
[LAUGH] That's a current.

87
00:04:49.003 --> 00:04:51.598
Current number that's on.

88
00:04:51.598 --> 00:04:54.575
We don't really have a green
flag in this case, but

89
00:04:54.575 --> 00:04:57.495
we need some way to like
set that to one by default.

90
00:04:57.495 --> 00:05:02.425
So we'll add a green flag for
our setup.And so we'll say let's just

91
00:05:02.425 --> 00:05:07.277
start at one, and we'll see why we
won't need this in a little bit.

92
00:05:07.277 --> 00:05:08.733
Set current to one.

93
00:05:11.595 --> 00:05:15.778
And then what we can do is say,
we'll go into these operators, and

94
00:05:15.778 --> 00:05:17.733
we'll do that modular again.

95
00:05:20.965 --> 00:05:25.695
We'll say the current.

96
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.411
No, it's current, module, and
then we have four in this case.

97
00:05:37.016 --> 00:05:38.565
And then we'll bump the current each time.

98
00:05:38.565 --> 00:05:40.577
We'll start out with just
seeing if it works for one.

99
00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.035
Say item current,
catchphrases so let's see.

100
00:05:50.035 --> 00:05:51.907
Well, that's going on.

101
00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:55.881
We got, say one.

102
00:05:55.881 --> 00:05:56.971
All right.

103
00:05:56.971 --> 00:05:59.688
Current was still set to zero
because I never hit the green flag.

104
00:05:59.688 --> 00:06:04.368
Yay, and the apple is lonely,
in this case.

105
00:06:04.368 --> 00:06:06.007
Cool, and so that's useful here.

106
00:06:06.007 --> 00:06:07.735
So current is now one.

107
00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:09.044
I am cheesy.

108
00:06:09.044 --> 00:06:09.974
I am cheesy.

109
00:06:09.974 --> 00:06:10.475
I am cheesy.

110
00:06:10.475 --> 00:06:12.528
So what we want to do is bump
the number up every time.

111
00:06:12.528 --> 00:06:14.851
He says the first thing
the first time he's clicked.

112
00:06:14.851 --> 00:06:16.784
Then we want to say the second thing.

113
00:06:16.784 --> 00:06:18.316
Then we want to say the third thing.

114
00:06:18.316 --> 00:06:20.676
So on and so forth, right?

115
00:06:20.676 --> 00:06:22.896
So even if we just put
the current in here for

116
00:06:22.896 --> 00:06:25.190
a moment we can kind of
see that mostly work.

117
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.461
So we'll say current, and

118
00:06:26.461 --> 00:06:29.950
then what we want to do is change current
by one after he said whatever it is.

119
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.835
So if you look here, it's one.

120
00:06:32.835 --> 00:06:36.230
Now it's hello.

121
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.564
Now it's I'm totally non-sentient.

122
00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:39.685
I'm a totally healthy food.

123
00:06:39.685 --> 00:06:41.691
It's currently five, so what happens next?

124
00:06:41.691 --> 00:06:42.659
It's outside.

125
00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:46.637
So that's why we use that module so
it keeps wrapping around,

126
00:06:46.637 --> 00:06:51.011
because it'll always be 0,
1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

127
00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:51.932
Right?

128
00:06:51.932 --> 00:06:55.762
Well, never before because
divided by 4 will be 0 again.

129
00:06:55.762 --> 00:06:57.343
We'll have no remainder, right?

130
00:06:57.343 --> 00:07:01.695
But you cut to the problem,
you figure out the problem already.

131
00:07:01.695 --> 00:07:07.664
So if we do that, we'll hit the green
flag, set it back to one I am cheesy.

132
00:07:07.664 --> 00:07:10.783
Hello, I'm totally non-sentient.

133
00:07:10.783 --> 00:07:11.390
Nothing.

134
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.358
&gt;&gt; You can also do it if it's greater
than, like, change current by one.

135
00:07:16.358 --> 00:07:22.766
After that, if it is greater than four,
then it will change it to one again.

136
00:07:22.766 --> 00:07:24.530
&gt;&gt; We could do that, right?

137
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.046
So, what Caleb said is, basically,
if at any point if it's less than one,

138
00:07:29.046 --> 00:07:30.610
bump it up to one, right?

139
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.237
And I am pretty sure that work.

140
00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:37.401
Let's try it out.

141
00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:41.963
So we'll say if the number keeps going up.

142
00:07:41.963 --> 00:07:45.384
The other thing we can do is if it's
always going to be 0, 1, 2 or 3 and

143
00:07:45.384 --> 00:07:48.605
we want it to be 1, 2, 3 or 4,
what can we always do this number?

144
00:07:50.922 --> 00:07:53.302
Just add 1, right?

145
00:07:59.307 --> 00:08:01.452
So this will either be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

146
00:08:01.452 --> 00:08:02.477
We want 1, 2, 3, 4.

147
00:08:02.477 --> 00:08:03.921
So we'll just take that number.

148
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:05.084
We'll always add 1.

149
00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:11.113
So now I'm cheesy.

150
00:08:11.113 --> 00:08:11.957
Hello.

151
00:08:11.957 --> 00:08:13.098
I'm totally non sentient.

152
00:08:13.098 --> 00:08:13.934
I'm a healthy food.

153
00:08:13.934 --> 00:08:14.534
I am cheesy.

154
00:08:14.534 --> 00:08:16.718
Hello, I am totally non sentient.

155
00:08:16.718 --> 00:08:18.202
I am totally a healthy food.

156
00:08:18.202 --> 00:08:19.087
I am cheesy.

157
00:08:19.087 --> 00:08:20.616
We rotate through.

158
00:08:20.616 --> 00:08:23.939
This works, and I think we got
the point of both broadcasting

159
00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:27.799
from the previous thing as well as
the idea of cycling through things.

160
00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:32.021
In fact,
we can actually move these together,

161
00:08:32.021 --> 00:08:35.715
which is now whenever Arnold is clicked,

162
00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:40.779
instead of the sprite itself,
Arnold will say, hello,

163
00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:46.389
and the cheese puffs will say
one of its catch phrases, right?

164
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:48.387
So now.

165
00:08:48.387 --> 00:08:51.549
Hello, two seconds, hello.

166
00:08:51.549 --> 00:08:55.337
Hello, I'm totally non sentient.

167
00:08:55.337 --> 00:09:00.113
Hello, I am a healthy food, right?

168
00:09:00.113 --> 00:09:04.977
This will break again in one case that
we just make this slightly better,

169
00:09:04.977 --> 00:09:07.700
which is if we add one more catchphrase.

170
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:16.594
[SOUND] What's this other catchphrase be?

171
00:09:22.346 --> 00:09:25.948
Pizza, there we go.

172
00:09:25.948 --> 00:09:27.164
So there's a break again.

173
00:09:27.164 --> 00:09:30.438
So the other thing we can also do just
to make this a little bit better.

174
00:09:30.438 --> 00:09:37.147
Totally not necessary, is we just do
it based on the length of the phrases.

175
00:09:37.147 --> 00:09:41.398
So it'll cycle through plus one and now
we can add stuff we can remove stuff we

176
00:09:41.398 --> 00:09:46.130
don't have, what's that for previously is
what in program we call a magic number.

177
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.579
It meant something to us.

178
00:09:47.579 --> 00:09:49.785
But now we just do it based on the length.

179
00:09:49.785 --> 00:09:52.864
So now I can rotate through, hello.

180
00:09:52.864 --> 00:09:55.222
I regret the two seconds on this,
I am cheesy.

181
00:09:55.222 --> 00:09:56.440
Hello.

182
00:09:59.841 --> 00:10:02.176
I am totally non-sentient.

183
00:10:02.176 --> 00:10:06.623
I'm healthy food And
now it cycles through our new one.

184
00:10:06.623 --> 00:10:09.796
And so we can add stuff,
we can remove stuff, and to Kayla's point,

185
00:10:09.796 --> 00:10:12.830
we can now hide this list because
we've got some of that in place.

186
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.314
So we can start to like snap all
these different ideas together,

187
00:10:15.314 --> 00:10:16.840
and add different For an interaction.

188
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.549
So you can create an entire like some
people aren't making games in scratch.

189
00:10:19.549 --> 00:10:23.438
What they're doing is making an entire
plays or stories that like play out or

190
00:10:23.438 --> 00:10:26.806
things that are actually scratch
ones we hit play the green flag.

191
00:10:26.806 --> 00:10:29.240
And it's like teaching you how to
do something in scratch, right?

192
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.578
By having Arnold say
the different instructions and

193
00:10:31.578 --> 00:10:33.073
it goes through an entire story.

194
00:10:33.073 --> 00:10:35.959
So you begin to tie all of
these things together and

195
00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:40.634
kind of create all sorts of different like
interactions like in our time together

196
00:10:40.634 --> 00:10:45.308
today we're gonna rather than go all the
way in so the weeds on one thing we'll try

197
00:10:45.308 --> 00:10:48.743
a few different things and
like you then you can kind of go and

198
00:10:48.743 --> 00:10:52.351
explore with whichever thing is
the most interesting to you.
