1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.043
All right, so
before we get to the solution,

2
00:00:03.043 --> 00:00:08.181
let's talk about some of the various
failure modes that we saw during this.

3
00:00:08.181 --> 00:00:12.393
So for instance,
one is to think, right now,

4
00:00:12.393 --> 00:00:17.046
the default direction of a sprite is 90,
right?

5
00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:22.087
And so
I made Dave point to about 90 degrees.

6
00:00:22.087 --> 00:00:25.773
Now, there is a world,
though, where for instance,

7
00:00:25.773 --> 00:00:31.225
you could theoretically, be like, yeah,
I'm gonna make a little character,

8
00:00:31.225 --> 00:00:34.670
and if he's pointing up,
you can see that we kind of

9
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.263
get an effect like we had with
Arnold in the very beginning, right?

10
00:00:39.263 --> 00:00:41.069
In this case-
&gt;&gt; The Arnold effect.

11
00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:43.805
&gt;&gt; The Arnold effect as it's known.

12
00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:47.023
So you could grab it and
just turn your sprite like this,

13
00:00:47.023 --> 00:00:49.356
you just wanna make sure you select all.

14
00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:54.671
The other thing you will notice,
if you selected all, is in the costume,

15
00:00:54.671 --> 00:00:59.835
it's really subtle on my screen here,
but there is little cross hair.

16
00:00:59.835 --> 00:01:03.503
That is the center point
of the sprite canvas.

17
00:01:03.503 --> 00:01:06.028
You can kind of see, it's probably
a little clearer on your screens.

18
00:01:06.028 --> 00:01:08.440
And also what I've selected
has a little plus sign.

19
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.105
If you go, you wanna snap the plus
sign to the center of your Dave,

20
00:01:14.105 --> 00:01:18.123
or whatever you've chosen
to call your Dave.

21
00:01:18.123 --> 00:01:20.358
And now that will be in
the center of sprite.

22
00:01:20.358 --> 00:01:24.345
Also if you had some extra little things
somewhere then the sprite will think it's

23
00:01:24.345 --> 00:01:25.280
bigger than it is.

24
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.112
So just make sure that any extra stuff,
so for instance,

25
00:01:28.112 --> 00:01:31.602
if I had a, I'll grab this real quick,
a tiny little thing over here.

26
00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:34.537
Dave is now this big,
which is more than I want him to be.

27
00:01:34.537 --> 00:01:38.203
And so a white eyeball or something
like that could be somewhat hidden.

28
00:01:38.203 --> 00:01:42.803
So we'll just go ahead and
delete that for now.

29
00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:44.316
So you can point there as well.

30
00:01:44.316 --> 00:01:48.379
The other thing, as I said earlier,
at one point, cuz it happens to me,

31
00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:50.724
you will write code in the wrong section.

32
00:01:50.724 --> 00:01:53.732
And so what happens,
in this case I wrote it all in Dave,

33
00:01:53.732 --> 00:01:57.007
but what happens if this was
code meant for the taco, right?

34
00:01:57.007 --> 00:01:58.848
That is easily fixed.

35
00:01:58.848 --> 00:02:02.641
You grab the code, you drag it over,
and it lives in taco.

36
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:05.072
Now it also lives in Dave,
this only copied it.

37
00:02:05.072 --> 00:02:08.570
So you go to a place where you don't want
that now, and drag it into the drawer,

38
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.320
and it's gone.

39
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.640
So you can move the code from one sprite
to the other when you make a boo-boo.

40
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.307
You just have to go move it over and
then delete it.

41
00:02:17.307 --> 00:02:20.592
Great, now I'm gonna do up and down.

42
00:02:20.592 --> 00:02:25.503
But before I do that, I'm gonna just kind
of demonstrate that there are other ways

43
00:02:25.503 --> 00:02:27.148
or other options in which.

44
00:02:27.148 --> 00:02:29.991
Actually let's do up and down and I'll
show you that there are other options and

45
00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:31.313
other mechanics that you could use.

46
00:02:31.313 --> 00:02:35.738
Again, there's not a right answer,
it's about what are you trying to build?

47
00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:41.948
So in this case, I will go ahead and
I will do, let's pull one of these out.

48
00:02:43.013 --> 00:02:44.146
Pop that back in.

49
00:02:44.146 --> 00:02:46.046
We'll go ahead and duplicate.

50
00:02:46.046 --> 00:02:54.472
I got two more, so now I say when
the up arrow is pressed, point up,

51
00:02:55.651 --> 00:03:00.543
When the down arrow is pressed,
point down.

52
00:03:00.543 --> 00:03:05.655
And you can put this all right back in,
and you can start and you can stop.

53
00:03:05.655 --> 00:03:09.889
Now, if I don't change that
from left arrow to down arrow,

54
00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.270
everything's all topsy turvy.

55
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.106
Again, it does what I told it to do.

56
00:03:15.106 --> 00:03:17.695
Not what I wanted to do, but
it did do what I told it to do.

57
00:03:17.695 --> 00:03:20.649
And now Dave is moving around,
he gets the taco,

58
00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:25.273
he doesn't even know he's on the taco
though and we don't have any of that.

59
00:03:25.273 --> 00:03:28.759
So we do wanna program that
kind of interactivity.

60
00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:33.547
But first, let's take an aside and talk
about if we wanted a different mechanic

61
00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:36.487
for the movement,
how we might do that, right?

62
00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:38.551
Because again,
depending on what you're trying to do,

63
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:39.756
different code paths will work.

64
00:03:39.756 --> 00:03:44.124
I chose to have a move no matter
what in a given direction.

65
00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:45.971
If you wanted to have to hold the key,

66
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:48.724
then you put the move block
inside every if statement.

67
00:03:48.724 --> 00:03:52.281
It's all depending on what effect you're
trying to get, what the right answer is,

68
00:03:52.281 --> 00:03:53.796
and so far there is no right answer.

69
00:03:53.796 --> 00:04:00.031
I'm gonna just detach this for
a moment so I can put it back.

70
00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:03.295
I'll actually duplicate it for a second.

71
00:04:03.295 --> 00:04:03.991
Just put it over here.

72
00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:07.126
Now this code will never run because
nothing kicks this code off,

73
00:04:07.126 --> 00:04:08.614
it's just hanging out there.

74
00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:12.573
It's not also gonna create a forever loop
just in general, nothing starts this.

75
00:04:12.573 --> 00:04:17.969
So it's just dead code hanging out,
it's called kids.

76
00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:20.692
Ask your parents about it.

77
00:04:20.692 --> 00:04:24.997
Okay, what I'm gonna do is, instead of
the right, and let me get rid of those,

78
00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:27.976
and I'm gonna create
a slightly different mechanic.

79
00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:32.295
Well here we're pointing in
the direction and we're saying go, but

80
00:04:32.295 --> 00:04:34.163
I could also get rid of these.

81
00:04:34.163 --> 00:04:38.387
Well, let's say we wanna make
a racing game instead, right?

82
00:04:38.387 --> 00:04:42.904
I could say, when the right arrow is
pressed, turn one degree clockwise,

83
00:04:42.904 --> 00:04:46.214
you can change these numbers
if it's too slow for you.

84
00:04:46.214 --> 00:04:50.203
And when the left arrow is pressed,
turn one degree counterclockwise.

85
00:04:50.203 --> 00:04:52.370
Let's look at the different
mechanic that we get.

86
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.618
You can see that maybe ten steps
is a bit too much at this point,

87
00:04:55.618 --> 00:04:57.505
let's go down to one at this point.

88
00:04:59.794 --> 00:05:03.998
So now, as I hit right and left, he turns.

89
00:05:03.998 --> 00:05:07.170
All right, ten was too fast,
this is why we play test.

90
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.803
Ten was too fast, one is egregiously slow.

91
00:05:10.803 --> 00:05:12.059
&gt;&gt; Try five.

92
00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:12.802
&gt;&gt; Try five.

93
00:05:12.802 --> 00:05:14.302
Let's try five.

94
00:05:15.874 --> 00:05:18.993
Right, and so you could choose that
you like this mechanic instead.

95
00:05:18.993 --> 00:05:22.093
Five also a little much,
crashes in the wall pretty quickly.

96
00:05:22.093 --> 00:05:25.758
And again, so you know what you do, you
play your game and you make adjustments.

97
00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:31.320
Two seems actually, I don't know, maybe
one and a half might be the right answer.

98
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.054
Or maybe he needs to turn faster, right?

99
00:05:33.054 --> 00:05:35.780
And so a lot of these things,
there's not necessarily a right answer,

100
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:36.512
you play the game.

101
00:05:36.512 --> 00:05:39.469
Let's have him turn at four
degrees instead of one degree.

102
00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:43.964
All right,
now we got something going on here, right?

103
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.390
So in this case now his turn
radius is a little bit better,

104
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.482
maybe I do want him to
go a little bit faster.

105
00:05:50.482 --> 00:05:52.778
You can adjust all
the different pieces and

106
00:05:52.778 --> 00:05:56.240
you get different effects depending
on what you're going for.

107
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.921
So if you like this better, this'll work.

108
00:05:58.921 --> 00:06:02.089
If you liked the up, down, left,
and right, that'll work too.

109
00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:03.609
You get to choose whichever one you want,

110
00:06:03.609 --> 00:06:05.833
I'm gonna go back to our
regularly scheduled programming.

111
00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:10.431
So now up, down, left, right, again,
you can use whichever one you like more.
