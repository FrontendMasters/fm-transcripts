1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.735
So now, we've got this dynamic of
increased difficulty, cuz if this game

2
00:00:04.735 --> 00:00:09.515
didn't get any harder and there was no
way to lose, sure a score is useful, but

3
00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:13.800
all of a sudden now you're like,
what's the highest score I can get?

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.460
Cuz there's a way that you can lose,
right?

5
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.710
There's a certain amount of engagement.

6
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.930
Sometimes we need life to be hard
in order for it to be fun, right?

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.412
So, we've got a decent dynamic,
but I heard what's the idea,

8
00:00:26.412 --> 00:00:28.660
what if we add enemies, right?

9
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:36.248
So, what if not only were you chasing
a taco, but there was someone chasing you.

10
00:00:36.248 --> 00:00:40.664
I might take out the speed for a little
bit until we get to the point where you do

11
00:00:40.664 --> 00:00:44.750
every five, because there's a lot
going on at that point in the game.

12
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.920
We'll put this aside for a moment.

13
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.850
We'll put it back in a second.

14
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.930
Cool, so, now the game won't go faster,
but the edges are still problematic.

15
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.999
So, we need an enemy,
we need an antagonist here.

16
00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:03.115
I don't wanna make a new sprite right now,
so

17
00:01:03.115 --> 00:01:06.490
what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna duplicate Dave.

18
00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.370
And that's gonna duplicate Dave's code.

19
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.569
I actually don't want Dave's code.

20
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.890
I just wanted Dave's sprite.

21
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.999
What is Dave's mortal enemy's name?

22
00:01:20.023 --> 00:01:21.120
&gt;&gt; Evad.

23
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.420
&gt;&gt; Evad?

24
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.060
&gt;&gt; Evad, cuz it's Dave backwards.

25
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.180
&gt;&gt; Okay, I like it, Evad.

26
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.120
And so, Dave is going to evade Evad.

27
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.040
I'm gonna say that 42 times fast.

28
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.110
And now, it's gonna be problematic if
Dave and Evad look exactly the same.

29
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.290
So, go to costumes.

30
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.020
Red?

31
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.579
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Red works bad guys, right?

32
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.482
Let's try those down.

33
00:01:50.482 --> 00:01:52.642
Yeah.

34
00:01:52.642 --> 00:01:56.152
There's one thing that
needs to change here,

35
00:01:56.152 --> 00:02:00.022
is if we go to this tool here,
you actually bend it.

36
00:02:02.047 --> 00:02:02.983
Yeah.

37
00:02:05.537 --> 00:02:06.727
&gt;&gt; He's angry.

38
00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:09.408
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I bend those circles a little bit.

39
00:02:09.408 --> 00:02:13.014
There we go.

40
00:02:13.014 --> 00:02:15.380
&gt;&gt; Now, he's angry.

41
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, now he's angry.

42
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.410
Evad is angry.

43
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.413
All right, so

44
00:02:22.413 --> 00:02:28.030
now I've got an angry Evad who should
chase Dave as Dave is chasing the taco.

45
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.030
So, we've got to figure out this logic.

46
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.980
And let's go ahead and see.

47
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.666
So, let's move Evad up to this corner so

48
00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:40.224
that they're not starting
right next to each other.

49
00:02:40.224 --> 00:02:41.390
He needs some setup space.

50
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.540
Otherwise, this could be like the last
place he was when the game starts.

51
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.409
So, we'll move him up there.

52
00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:51.490
So when the game starts, we'll do our
setup, which is go over there, Evad.

53
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.251
And then we'll put a game loop in.

54
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.860
And,
&gt;&gt; Make him glide to a random position.

55
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.410
&gt;&gt; So he just teleports?

56
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.430
&gt;&gt; No, just glide to a random position.

57
00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:08.430
&gt;&gt; Make it for 0.1.

58
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.110
&gt;&gt; Let's try it out.
&gt;&gt; Make it for 0.1 seconds.

59
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.970
&gt;&gt; All right, let's try it out.

60
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.513
&gt;&gt; And they'll be zooming around there.

61
00:03:13.513 --> 00:03:14.250
&gt;&gt; Let's try it out.

62
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.319
Glide to random position 0.1 seconds.

63
00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.420
&gt;&gt; Yes, 0.1.

64
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.599
&gt;&gt; All right.

65
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.879
&gt;&gt; Now just push go.

66
00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:26.951
&gt;&gt; That's terrifying.

67
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:31.070
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm getting.

68
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.440
&gt;&gt; Okay, then make it slower.

69
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.280
&gt;&gt; All right, slower.

70
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.830
Yeah, this is why we played it.

71
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:34.790
&gt;&gt; Make it 0.5.

72
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.630
&gt;&gt; 0.5.

73
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.513
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's-
&gt;&gt; Okay,

74
00:03:39.513 --> 00:03:43.200
maybe even one second
wouldn't be terrible.

75
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.580
It's just kinda hard cuz-
&gt;&gt; He's unfairly fast.

76
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH].

77
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.145
So [LAUGH] we might adjust it,
also, he is erratic.

78
00:03:52.145 --> 00:03:57.330
[LAUGH] All right, let's try this one out.

79
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.909
Let's say, point towards Dave.

80
00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:02.969
&gt;&gt; No.

81
00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:08.880
Right, and then we'll move 10.

82
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.420
&gt;&gt; So, he has to eat tacos to run away.

83
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.170
&gt;&gt; Okay,
he's a little bit slower than Dave.

84
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.240
Steve makes one wrong move and
game over for Dave.

85
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.602
All right, maybe Evad needs to move five.

86
00:04:26.173 --> 00:04:30.190
All right, the edges are bad and Evad
&gt;&gt; Five plus the score.

87
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.426
&gt;&gt; We'll get there.

88
00:04:31.426 --> 00:04:34.852
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Five plus the score,

89
00:04:34.852 --> 00:04:38.010
make him move along with Dave.

90
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.178
They keep up the speeds for
&gt;&gt; I

91
00:04:43.178 --> 00:04:45.159
think eventually let's try
something else first though.

92
00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:50.190
Actually, we can mix the having enemy and
speeding it up,

93
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.982
or what if the number
of enemies increased?

94
00:04:54.982 --> 00:04:58.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right, so first you got one Evad, but

95
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.510
then there's like a gang of
Evads chasing Dave down, right?

96
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.276
And so at that point,

97
00:05:05.276 --> 00:05:11.290
we need to figure out a way to do
some of these mechanics as well.

98
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:18.320
And so, how we're gonna do this, I'd say
we've got the taco, let's have the taco.

99
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.801
We'll do it like, again, I agree that we
need to do this maybe every few points,

100
00:05:21.801 --> 00:05:25.060
cuz otherwise it's going to get out,
or the game will just end fast.

101
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.706
The only thing that a sprite can do
that affects another sprite is we can

102
00:05:29.706 --> 00:05:32.714
do this thing called create a clone,
right?

103
00:05:32.714 --> 00:05:36.770
Which is basically instantiate
another version of that sprite.

104
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.629
That was adult words.

105
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:39.810
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's create a clone.

106
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.946
&gt;&gt; So with the taco,
as we're going to increase the score,

107
00:05:44.946 --> 00:05:52.341
let's also say that we're going to create
a clone, not of the taco, but of Evad.

108
00:05:56.718 --> 00:05:58.078
So as you can see, I have a problem here.

109
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.135
Which is we create clones,
but what do they do?

110
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.755
&gt;&gt; Stand.

111
00:06:08.755 --> 00:06:09.397
&gt;&gt; Just stand.

112
00:06:09.397 --> 00:06:12.890
&gt;&gt; They just stand there, right?

113
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.536
Also, I never put the logic in
where touching Evad is bad,

114
00:06:15.536 --> 00:06:18.130
is still just the edges
that ends the game.

115
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.449
So we need to do two things,
one we need to make it so

116
00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.758
that Dave evades Evad, and the edges and

117
00:06:27.758 --> 00:06:33.740
the game goes faster, and
it's really upsetting.

118
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.910
So, I guess I could do this in two angles.

119
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.240
Honestly it's up to you, we can say.

120
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.914
If Dave is touching Evad,
the game ends, or we go to Evad and

121
00:06:43.914 --> 00:06:47.170
say if he's touching Dave, the game ends.

122
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.970
It's up to you.

123
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.206
I feel like since the edge logic
is already in here as well,

124
00:06:52.206 --> 00:06:56.278
I might as well put it in here
that makes more sense to me.

125
00:06:56.278 --> 00:07:01.376
So if we are touching Evad,

126
00:07:01.376 --> 00:07:06.031
we have not evaded Evad,

127
00:07:06.031 --> 00:07:10.249
we will also stop all.

128
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.110
And now we will test to
make sure that works.

129
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.590
Okay, cool.

130
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.255
We ran into a Evad and we died.

131
00:07:19.255 --> 00:07:22.044
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; When you make a clone of something, it

132
00:07:22.044 --> 00:07:27.820
switches its name, so if you were to touch
Evad, his clones would be like Evad one.

133
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.730
So then, that name would no longer work.

134
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:30.230
&gt;&gt; Let's find out.

135
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.286
&gt;&gt; At least from my knowledge.

136
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.410
&gt;&gt; Still die, the clones count.

137
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:45.590
We've got enemies, but
they're kind of stone enemies, right?

138
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.550
They don't really do anything which,
I mean,

139
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.733
adds an element,
what you could do if we wanted to.

140
00:07:51.733 --> 00:07:55.950
Let's say we were done coding,
we didn't wanna change anything, right?

141
00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:00.578
You could have a second costume for
Evad, that was like an Evad

142
00:08:00.578 --> 00:08:05.211
statue that doesn't move, or
something along those lines.

143
00:08:05.211 --> 00:08:08.010
&gt;&gt; Could also make it where it's a statue.

144
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:13.208
And then when you touch the statue Evad,
then he is regular Evad.

145
00:08:13.208 --> 00:08:16.460
&gt;&gt; You could do all that too,
you could do that as well.

146
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.637
Let's talk about why Evad isn't moving,
which again falls into our principle

147
00:08:21.637 --> 00:08:26.440
of that's not what we wanted, but
that is what we told the computer to do.

148
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.923
So here we are, which is we said,
when the green flag is clicked,

149
00:08:31.923 --> 00:08:34.829
start this loop for Evad, right?

150
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.290
There's no more green flags being clicked.

151
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:42.587
Thereby those clones have no code, right?

152
00:08:42.587 --> 00:08:46.550
Cuz that green flag event never happened,
right?

153
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:51.210
So, there's a bunch of ways that we
can solve for this, a bunch of events.

154
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.480
We need some event to kick this off.

155
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.590
If we go into events,
we've got a few options.

156
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.490
When the green flag is clicked, okay?

157
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:03.670
We can make the player have to hit
the space key to get the Evads moving.

158
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.930
Doesn't seem like they're gonna do that.

159
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.790
We can make them click on the sprite.

160
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.280
Doesn't seem like they're gonna do that.

161
00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.684
When the backdrop changes,
maybe there's a mode where after 10

162
00:09:13.684 --> 00:09:17.099
points the backdrop changes, and
then all the Evads come to life.

163
00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:18.490
I don't hate that.

164
00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:23.854
When loudness is greater than 10,
well, there's no sound in this game.

165
00:09:23.854 --> 00:09:25.824
Messages, we haven't got to yet.

166
00:09:25.824 --> 00:09:30.545
There's this other one down here,
when I start as a clone.

167
00:09:30.545 --> 00:09:34.000
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Well, that seems good.

168
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:41.712
When I start as a clone, I'm gonna say,
do the same thing, okay?

169
00:09:41.712 --> 00:09:46.108
Chill, you could already see what
the problem's going to be here.

170
00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:53.779
So when I start as a clone, so
the clone starts in the same place,

171
00:09:53.779 --> 00:09:56.035
and they have the same logic.

172
00:09:56.035 --> 00:09:59.391
And so the game has gotten harder,

173
00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:04.732
it's just like they're
stacked on top of each other.

174
00:10:04.732 --> 00:10:06.273
He's just getting chunkier.

175
00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:11.212
&gt;&gt; Even that, that happened with the first
few, I don't even notice it anymore.

176
00:10:11.212 --> 00:10:12.772
&gt;&gt; He seems chunky now.

177
00:10:12.772 --> 00:10:15.078
&gt;&gt; So, we need to give it
slightly different logic, and

178
00:10:15.078 --> 00:10:18.280
this again is not a programming issue,
this is just a gameplay issue.

179
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.380
&gt;&gt; Make the clone teleport
to a random position.

180
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.360
&gt;&gt; I tried that, it goes really poorly.

181
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.621
Cuz all of a sudden it pops up and
the game ends and you're like,

182
00:10:26.621 --> 00:10:27.610
that's not fair, right?

183
00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.145
Let's try it, we can do it, but
you'll be as angry as I am.

184
00:10:30.145 --> 00:10:33.940
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Make it go into the corners.

185
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.255
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do let's do random,
let's try both.

186
00:10:37.255 --> 00:10:40.330
&gt;&gt; Make it at the edge.

187
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.506
&gt;&gt; Let's do both,
let's try that random one.

188
00:10:42.506 --> 00:10:47.298
That illustrate my point a little bit too
well, that the random position that I went

189
00:10:47.298 --> 00:10:49.975
to was directly over my player and
then I died.

190
00:10:49.975 --> 00:10:51.590
So, we know we don't like that mechanic.

191
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:56.697
I thought I was gonna do that several
times before we saw that, we're gonna

192
00:10:56.697 --> 00:11:01.412
have it go to the corner, which is
a good idea, and we'll see [SOUND].

193
00:11:01.412 --> 00:11:02.592
Where does that go to?

194
00:11:02.592 --> 00:11:08.340
Go to, and let's say 180,

195
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:13.570
that's backwards mode.

196
00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:18.640
240, 180 that should be
the upper right corner, right?

197
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.550
Oops.

198
00:11:24.314 --> 00:11:29.174
I didn't put the forever block back on,
my code did what I wanted it to,

199
00:11:29.174 --> 00:11:33.510
or it did what I told her to do,
does that what I wanna do?

200
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.660
So, this will work.

201
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.200
I guess I ate two tacos at that point.

202
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.827
The only issue that I noticed with this,
this actually works great,

203
00:11:40.827 --> 00:11:44.280
eventually they will converge and
we'll have the same problem.

204
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.140
It's just this game's too hard at this
point [LAUGH] can't get far enough.

205
00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.060
&gt;&gt; How about if they're
touching each other?

206
00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:53.684
Then they teleport to the edge again.

207
00:11:53.684 --> 00:11:55.960
&gt;&gt; Let's try it.

208
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.909
So then, what we'd have to?

209
00:11:56.909 --> 00:11:58.732
&gt;&gt; Make-
&gt;&gt; Well the problem is if two

210
00:11:58.732 --> 00:12:00.641
of them touch,
they teleport at the same time,

211
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:02.960
they'll be touching each other again,
they get stuck.

212
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.800
Let's try it out.

213
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.270
&gt;&gt; What if when they touch each other,
they bounce off each other?

214
00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:08.830
&gt;&gt; Yes.

215
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:09.399
&gt;&gt; Like this.

216
00:12:09.399 --> 00:12:11.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like ricochet off each other.

217
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:14.860
But they're also pointing
towards Dave every time.

218
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.599
So, we change the direction or
the other direction, and

219
00:12:17.599 --> 00:12:19.949
then they go immediately
back to pointing Dave.

220
00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:21.290
These are all options, right?

221
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:26.425
And these are where we play-test it,
we can try the teleporting.

222
00:12:28.115 --> 00:12:31.174
I have an option, it's not any
better than anyone else's option.

223
00:12:31.174 --> 00:12:35.055
This is the option I decided on at some
point after way too long doing this.

224
00:12:35.055 --> 00:12:42.125
&gt;&gt; Do it to the side for a move to
the side instead of straight forward.

225
00:12:42.125 --> 00:12:47.045
&gt;&gt; Let's say if they're touching another
Evad, we go back to the origin point.

226
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.090
The original, 240,
let's try it out, see how it feels.

227
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:58.152
All right, so if touching another,
can't touch yourself, okay,

228
00:12:58.152 --> 00:13:00.230
so we don't have that option.

229
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:04.694
&gt;&gt; It's touching the tacos and
the taco teleports away.

230
00:13:04.694 --> 00:13:06.282
&gt;&gt; I like all these mechanics,

231
00:13:06.282 --> 00:13:09.598
and like definitely we'll have
some time to explain that.

232
00:13:09.598 --> 00:13:12.461
&gt;&gt; And you can play a eating sound.

233
00:13:12.461 --> 00:13:14.071
&gt;&gt; Eating.

234
00:13:14.071 --> 00:13:15.840
&gt;&gt; Here's what I'm gonna try.

235
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.325
I'm gonna have them just behave a little
bit differently than the main one,

236
00:13:20.325 --> 00:13:21.950
cuz that's the nice part.

237
00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.950
It's like these are two different
kind of code paths, which is okay.

238
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.820
Forever point towards Dave.

239
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:33.357
However, this is most of the thing
demonstration sensing if,

240
00:13:33.357 --> 00:13:36.750
let's go to sensing, I got it.

241
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:37.720
So, we're gonna use the operator.

242
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.920
So, we got less than and
greater than two as well, right?

243
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.591
So, we'll say if The distance

244
00:13:46.591 --> 00:13:50.916
to Dave is let 's say less than a 100,

245
00:13:50.916 --> 00:13:54.879
move towards him, otherwise wait.

246
00:13:54.879 --> 00:14:00.007
So that way they are like
around the field waiting, and

247
00:14:00.007 --> 00:14:04.670
Dave gets close to one of the clones, then
&gt;&gt; They're chasing.

248
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.154
&gt;&gt; Then I'll chase him, otherwise I'll
stand and wait so it'll be spread around,

249
00:14:07.154 --> 00:14:08.243
and only when it gets close enough.

250
00:14:08.243 --> 00:14:10.746
I've chose 100, I don't know
what the right answer is here,

251
00:14:10.746 --> 00:14:12.533
which is why we're gonna
need to play-test.

252
00:14:12.533 --> 00:14:13.753
&gt;&gt; Do 50.

253
00:14:13.753 --> 00:14:14.347
&gt;&gt; 50?

254
00:14:14.347 --> 00:14:16.973
All right, so 50.

255
00:14:16.973 --> 00:14:20.803
So, only move if we're close.

256
00:14:24.023 --> 00:14:27.473
Cuz I'm never gonna get
that close to the corner,

257
00:14:27.473 --> 00:14:30.280
because the taco's never going there.

258
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.300
50 seemed a little small.

259
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:40.560
Let's just have it do right where
the other one started, Like we had before.

260
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.250
Let's try that out now.

261
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.693
Okay, so, we get taco,
too close to that edge,

262
00:14:44.693 --> 00:14:47.590
I don't know if I love that edge mechanic.

263
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:50.820
All right, so now he's waiting, he's
watching, 50 doesn't seem close enough.

264
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.299
Let's try 100.

265
00:14:54.299 --> 00:14:56.681
And it might not even be 100,
it might be 200.

266
00:14:56.681 --> 00:14:58.369
&gt;&gt; Maybe.

267
00:15:00.943 --> 00:15:03.810
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, let's try 200.

268
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.650
And again, it might be 150, who knows?

269
00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:10.689
&gt;&gt; Can we have the taco
clones right on them?

270
00:15:10.689 --> 00:15:11.730
&gt;&gt; 200 seems to be too much.

271
00:15:15.649 --> 00:15:19.520
&gt;&gt; Can the taco clones were Evad is?

272
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.340
&gt;&gt; You got close enough to get them away.

273
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.879
Now we got a game going, Mark.
