1
00:00:00.113 --> 00:00:03.336
So right now Pico can fall,
you know what Pico can't do?

2
00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:05.065
Jump, right?

3
00:00:05.065 --> 00:00:09.497
So let's figure it out, and we're
gonna do it in a separate project, but

4
00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:14.430
we're gonna figure out that mechanic where
we know how to make things go down, but

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.454
you know what they say,
what goes down must go up.

6
00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:18.069
&gt;&gt; Wait.

7
00:00:18.069 --> 00:00:22.274
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And then go back down again,
[LAUGH] right?

8
00:00:22.274 --> 00:00:25.201
it's a joke, [LAUGH].

9
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:28.251
So let's create a character.

10
00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:30.281
It can be Pico, it can be somebody else.

11
00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:34.736
Let's talk a little bit about how to jump,
cuz right now we only know down,

12
00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:37.084
we only know velocity that increases.

13
00:00:37.084 --> 00:00:41.494
Jumping is basically a combination
of velocity goes up and

14
00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:44.106
then velocity goes down, right?

15
00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:48.917
And so if you think about this, when you
throw a ball up into the air, it leaves

16
00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:53.825
your hand pretty fast and it slows down
until it doesn't have any more energy.

17
00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:57.896
And then it turns around and
gravity takes over and then it's falling.

18
00:00:57.896 --> 00:01:01.962
So what we need to do is have something
go up so that it then can go down.

19
00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:07.566
All right, let's look a little
at this idea of jumping.

20
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.977
Do we want another one or somebody else?

21
00:01:09.977 --> 00:01:11.291
&gt;&gt; Somebody else.

22
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:12.187
&gt;&gt; Somebody else.

23
00:01:12.187 --> 00:01:13.560
&gt;&gt; Try Nano.

24
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.111
&gt;&gt; Nano's not-
&gt;&gt; Or whatever his name is.

25
00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:15.818
&gt;&gt; Pico?

26
00:01:15.818 --> 00:01:18.074
&gt;&gt; No, Nano.

27
00:01:18.074 --> 00:01:20.639
&gt;&gt; Nano doesn't really
have a jumping motion.

28
00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:23.683
I mean,
that could be a jumping motion, right?

29
00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:26.709
All right, let's do it.

30
00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.573
&gt;&gt; That's what I used for the apple one.

31
00:01:30.573 --> 00:01:33.631
&gt;&gt; All right,
Nano's got some jump action here.

32
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:36.818
All right, so
have this concept of falling, and

33
00:01:36.818 --> 00:01:40.722
we have this concept of falling
with velocity, all right?

34
00:01:40.722 --> 00:01:42.124
So we wanna do a jump.

35
00:01:42.124 --> 00:01:46.097
There's two ways to think about the jump,
there is, like we saw before,

36
00:01:46.097 --> 00:01:49.318
have a known number where you
know where you start, right?

37
00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:53.935
And so right now, let's just make
Nano's life a little bit easier,

38
00:01:53.935 --> 00:01:56.494
let's say negative 100, right?

39
00:01:56.494 --> 00:02:01.356
So we know that the theoretical
ground that Nano stands on Is at

40
00:02:01.356 --> 00:02:03.511
negative 100, right?

41
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:09.195
And the things that we need to figure
out is how high can Nano jump, right?

42
00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:13.245
And then what we wanna do is
go determine that height,

43
00:02:13.245 --> 00:02:18.916
figure out how high that jump is, and
then go back down to that start point.

44
00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:24.102
And again, this will work when there's
a known ground that doesn't change,

45
00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:28.817
which is the first one to kinda do,
cuz it gets trickier after this, and

46
00:02:28.817 --> 00:02:32.844
we'll have to do some math to
get a real platformer working.

47
00:02:32.844 --> 00:02:37.172
Cuz you don't wanna run into walls,
you might have multiple floors.

48
00:02:37.172 --> 00:02:40.948
There will be some math, I'm warning you
all, but it's predominantly addition and

49
00:02:40.948 --> 00:02:44.575
subtraction with a little bit of division
and multiplication at various points.

50
00:02:44.575 --> 00:02:47.119
We will not go into trigonometry today,
friends.

51
00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.347
We'll save that exploration for
a different day.

52
00:02:50.347 --> 00:02:54.033
All right, so we wanna figure out how
to make a jumping motion because we

53
00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:57.550
know that shooting them up and
shooting him back down isn't great.

54
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.722
So we could just say,
let's try something like this.

55
00:03:03.722 --> 00:03:05.476
Let's say, when the green flag is pressed,

56
00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:07.590
it could be a different
button at some point.

57
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.025
Actually, we'll make it the space key,
how about that?

58
00:03:10.025 --> 00:03:11.680
But let's make a game loop once again.

59
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.253
And we'll say, so we're trying to see
if that space key is pressed, right?

60
00:03:22.581 --> 00:03:24.770
Cool, I will zoom in a little bit.

61
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.550
That's the wrong zoom in.

62
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.763
If the space key is pressed,
we could just simply have him go up and

63
00:03:31.763 --> 00:03:34.380
then go down, right, and it'll work.

64
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.800
&gt;&gt; Go down until it hit something, though.

65
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.288
&gt;&gt; Or eventually we'll do with
our ground detection first and

66
00:03:39.288 --> 00:03:41.388
then we'll do it with ground detection,
right?

67
00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.882
And so we could say something like,

68
00:03:43.882 --> 00:03:48.386
we'll do something very similar
to what we do with the falling.

69
00:03:48.386 --> 00:03:52.989
We'll say, hey, for 10 times,

70
00:03:52.989 --> 00:04:00.519
what we wanna do is change y by 1,
this is gonna feel okay.

71
00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:08.034
And then we will wait,
you like half a second, right, Caleb?

72
00:04:08.034 --> 00:04:08.734
Half seconds feels good?

73
00:04:08.734 --> 00:04:09.975
I'll just do it.

74
00:04:09.975 --> 00:04:11.856
&gt;&gt; You can't just jump to-
&gt;&gt; You can't just jump and

75
00:04:11.856 --> 00:04:13.200
shoot it right back down.

76
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.864
That doesn't work.

77
00:04:14.864 --> 00:04:17.056
And then we could say something like-
&gt;&gt; You can't double jump.

78
00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:21.037
&gt;&gt; At one point we will
be able to unfortunately,

79
00:04:21.037 --> 00:04:23.700
even though we don't want to.

80
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.763
So actually want to change y.

81
00:04:26.763 --> 00:04:33.220
Yeah, and then we will go ahead and
we will change y by negative 1.

82
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.352
And this is gonna have
our same velocity issue.

83
00:04:40.588 --> 00:04:42.860
That jump, that jump isn't much.

84
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.000
&gt;&gt; Use weak legs.

85
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.848
&gt;&gt; I mean, and
then we change the values, [LAUGH].

86
00:04:50.848 --> 00:04:52.975
We can change the values.

87
00:04:52.975 --> 00:04:57.839
So we can either have happened more,
which will be a bigger jump but slower,

88
00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:01.264
or we can have 10 but
by increments of 10, right?

89
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.211
I mean, that is a jumping mechanism.

90
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:12.542
&gt;&gt; Oops.
&gt;&gt; I don't feel good about it, but

91
00:05:12.542 --> 00:05:13.960
it exists, all right?

92
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.736
It works.

93
00:05:14.736 --> 00:05:15.810
It is a jump.

94
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.223
I think that we can do better.

95
00:05:18.223 --> 00:05:21.404
If we take in this idea of
velocity that we had before,

96
00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:25.365
then we could theoretically have
them start up high, slow down and

97
00:05:25.365 --> 00:05:28.165
then come to the ground
just like the falling.

98
00:05:28.165 --> 00:05:31.688
&gt;&gt; I think this should be point two.

99
00:05:31.688 --> 00:05:37.503
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I also agree with you that he was
hanging in the air a little bit too long.

100
00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:38.401
&gt;&gt; He was floating.

101
00:05:38.401 --> 00:05:41.042
&gt;&gt; He's floating for a second, right?

102
00:05:41.042 --> 00:05:44.720
I think we had some velocity,
it will be a little bit happier.

103
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.226
All right, let's trash that.

104
00:05:48.226 --> 00:05:53.000
Okay, before when we had that velocity,
we stored in a variable,

105
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.638
does that make sense?

106
00:05:54.638 --> 00:05:56.170
I'm just gonna rename this one.

107
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.372
Actually, I don't know if that's,
it could be for everyone.

108
00:05:59.372 --> 00:06:03.445
And so we'll go ahead and we'll call
this one, you can call it Velocity Y,

109
00:06:03.445 --> 00:06:04.750
you can call it Speed Y.

110
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.035
What do we like, Speed Y or Velocity Y?

111
00:06:07.035 --> 00:06:07.797
&gt;&gt; Can I call it jump?

112
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.263
&gt;&gt; Because it's gonna change, whether or
not he's jumping, you could call it jump.

113
00:06:17.634 --> 00:06:19.095
&gt;&gt; Speed, velocity.

114
00:06:19.095 --> 00:06:19.950
Speed, okay.

115
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.410
Let's pick speed.

116
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.477
Speed Y, cuz it's gonna be
the direction that we should go.

117
00:06:25.477 --> 00:06:27.340
So when the game starts,

118
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.870
we do wanna set Speed Y to 0 just
to set everything the way it was.

119
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.858
And then theoretically in our game loop,
we should be,

120
00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:46.327
Changing the y, By whatever that speed is.

121
00:06:46.327 --> 00:06:47.885
If it's positive, he goes up.

122
00:06:47.885 --> 00:06:52.080
It's negative, he goes down, right?

123
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:59.283
And so,
now what we could do is we could say.

124
00:06:59.283 --> 00:07:05.858
So, we changed every time and
then if the space key is pressed,

125
00:07:07.682 --> 00:07:11.081
I get error, let's put it over here.

126
00:07:11.081 --> 00:07:16.046
If the space key is pressed,
then what we'll do is

127
00:07:16.046 --> 00:07:20.195
we will set y to, let's start with 10.

128
00:07:20.195 --> 00:07:20.853
Let's try that one out.

129
00:07:20.853 --> 00:07:22.169
And again, we might need to adjust.

130
00:07:29.622 --> 00:07:31.820
Not changed by 10, no,
we wanna set it to 10.

131
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.760
&gt;&gt; Is it set or changed?

132
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:40.246
&gt;&gt; We wanna set it to 10 and
I'll show you why in a second.

133
00:07:40.246 --> 00:07:44.350
Now, immediately you're
gonna see what happens.

134
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.372
Let's just say I'm gonna put in the code
that puts Nano back to where he's supposed

135
00:07:48.372 --> 00:07:51.886
to go when I hit the green flag for
reasons that you will very quickly see.

136
00:07:51.886 --> 00:07:54.640
Hit the spacebar.

137
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.914
So it set my variable to 10, yeah.

138
00:07:59.914 --> 00:08:01.490
My variable, Speed Y.

139
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.726
And away we go.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

140
00:08:05.726 --> 00:08:06.534
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

141
00:08:06.534 --> 00:08:07.995
&gt;&gt; Not what we wanted.

142
00:08:07.995 --> 00:08:10.720
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH], like I said before,

143
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.728
what goes up ideally should
come back down, right?

144
00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:19.250
&gt;&gt; It's not what you said at first,
but okay.

145
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.794
&gt;&gt; I was setting myself up for the joke
of, yeah, we did down and then goes up,

146
00:08:23.794 --> 00:08:24.312
right?

147
00:08:24.312 --> 00:08:27.120
Okay, so we've got that.

148
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.944
So now what we probably need to
do is to have him come down,

149
00:08:30.944 --> 00:08:34.856
which is what we can do is over time,
decrease that speed.

150
00:08:34.856 --> 00:08:41.375
So we could, every iteration, We could
go ahead and we could then just change,

151
00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:44.810
let me get rid of my variable before
it messes me up one more time.

152
00:08:46.062 --> 00:08:50.457
&gt;&gt; Up to the moon.

153
00:08:56.702 --> 00:09:03.051
&gt;&gt; We can do it by, Negative 0.5.

154
00:09:06.614 --> 00:09:09.316
So he will fall to gravity,
he can jump, but

155
00:09:09.316 --> 00:09:15.330
he will, Fall to what seems like oblivion,
but Scratch will stop him.

156
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:20.289
But he's got a hopping motion, and
you could see that over time, so

157
00:09:20.289 --> 00:09:23.252
it is slowing down and then down he goes.

158
00:09:23.252 --> 00:09:27.577
Sets to 10, and that number will keep
going down, but it doesn't really matter.

159
00:09:27.577 --> 00:09:30.073
&gt;&gt; Why Nano is acting like flappy bird?

160
00:09:30.073 --> 00:09:31.860
&gt;&gt; I mean, that seems cool.

161
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.791
Also you can hit space multiple times and
he will-

162
00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:35.990
&gt;&gt; Like Kirby-

163
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.956
&gt;&gt; He will Kirby himself,

164
00:09:37.956 --> 00:09:40.321
Kirby flappy bird, right?

165
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:44.570
&gt;&gt; Not too much like Kirby,
Kirby falls down slower-

166
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:45.408
&gt;&gt; Kirby's got a little bit of a-

167
00:09:45.408 --> 00:09:46.016
&gt;&gt; He's a big balloon.

168
00:09:46.016 --> 00:09:49.027
&gt;&gt; He's a big balloon.
He's got a little bit air to him, right?

169
00:09:49.027 --> 00:09:53.959
So that could work, if we know the actual
amount to, so like in this case,

170
00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:58.892
what we could is we could repeat it
a certain amount of times slowing down as

171
00:09:58.892 --> 00:09:59.868
time goes on.

172
00:09:59.868 --> 00:10:04.785
So we could, for instance,
move this out for a second.

173
00:10:11.885 --> 00:10:13.200
We could set it to 10.

174
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.920
And then we could come back down, there
is a bunch of different mechanics here.

175
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.894
We could do a touching
color here though as well.

176
00:10:25.643 --> 00:10:26.338
We could say, let's try this out.

177
00:10:26.338 --> 00:10:27.920
I'm winging it for a second here.

178
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.357
&gt;&gt; If touching color-
&gt;&gt; Exactly, you read my mind.

179
00:10:31.357 --> 00:10:35.973
&gt;&gt; If touching color like black,
completely black.

180
00:10:35.973 --> 00:10:40.973
You could outline everything with black
no matter what color it would be.

181
00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:46.504
I know it'd always land on it, so
then you don't need to do multiple colors.

182
00:10:46.504 --> 00:10:47.832
Think that's smart.

183
00:10:47.832 --> 00:10:51.550
&gt;&gt; Unless he's got a black wall and
then he can't jump, [LAUGH].

184
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.780
Life's hard.

185
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:53.330
Let's start with this.

186
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:53.830
&gt;&gt; It'll work.

187
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:58.731
&gt;&gt; Let's try it, we're winging it now.

188
00:10:58.731 --> 00:11:02.161
We'll say if touching color,
what do we choose, black?

189
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:03.080
&gt;&gt; Black.

190
00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.410
&gt;&gt; Black.

191
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.730
If touching color, black.

192
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:19.350
I'm thinking we can, Set Speed Y to 0,

193
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:25.570
otherwise-
&gt;&gt; And make for he can jump again somehow.

194
00:11:28.309 --> 00:11:29.170
&gt;&gt; Put it there.

195
00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.101
We should probably give
ourselves some black, right?

196
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.603
Push that all the way down.

197
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.264
&gt;&gt; Then you can make
a nice platformer game.

198
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.530
Where did 1 go?

199
00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:56.750
&gt;&gt; Make for he can jump only when
he's touching the color black.

200
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.968
&gt;&gt; So we got a jumping motion.

201
00:11:59.968 --> 00:12:06.626
Again, he does fall a little
bit beneath the ground but

202
00:12:06.626 --> 00:12:12.930
it does for
the most part get us most of the effect.

203
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:16.833
We give him a general starting point
which might not be perfect anymore.

204
00:12:16.833 --> 00:12:18.687
So I look at where he is now,

205
00:12:18.687 --> 00:12:22.859
let's say negative 149-
&gt;&gt; And then we can make if he's touching

206
00:12:22.859 --> 00:12:27.701
a certain color, that can be like lava or
something or spikes, whatever you want.

207
00:12:27.701 --> 00:12:29.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can have red be lava.

208
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.795
That's a good color for lava and
you can say that will stop the game, or

209
00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:35.714
black x hits the ground, right?

210
00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:38.845
There's a bunch of tricks
that we can do here.

211
00:12:38.845 --> 00:12:40.575
And then we can combine this.

212
00:12:40.575 --> 00:12:42.249
So we've got a decent jumping motion now.

213
00:12:42.249 --> 00:12:45.980
All right, Ashley,
you wanna step through this code?

214
00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:46.532
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

215
00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:47.840
&gt;&gt; All right, let's step through it.

216
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.068
All right, follow along with me.

217
00:12:49.068 --> 00:12:52.332
When the green flag is clicked,
we give him some starting location,

218
00:12:52.332 --> 00:12:55.480
is that starting location
a good starting location?

219
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.094
&gt;&gt; It doesn't have a starting.

220
00:12:56.094 --> 00:12:57.090
&gt;&gt; Okay, perfect.

221
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.903
We set the y speed to zero just
as the initialization, all right?

222
00:13:00.903 --> 00:13:04.090
Go into the game loop.

223
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.555
By definition, he's not jumping, right?

224
00:13:06.555 --> 00:13:11.070
If the space key is pressed,
we set y to 10 and we start 10.

225
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:14.659
But then theoretically,
if he's not touching the color,

226
00:13:14.659 --> 00:13:17.763
then that becomes 9.5, then 9, then 8.5.

227
00:13:17.763 --> 00:13:21.640
He slows, he jumps less and
less and less and less and less.

228
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.281
&gt;&gt; The only thing we haven't
made is left and right.

229
00:13:24.281 --> 00:13:27.911
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, we're gonna make a game
where he jumps over things, whatever,

230
00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:29.840
we can let them do left and
right here too.

231
00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.944
&gt;&gt; And I just noticed you can hold
the space key to make him jump as high as

232
00:13:33.944 --> 00:13:34.597
you want.

233
00:13:34.597 --> 00:13:35.680
&gt;&gt; So how do we fix that?

234
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.110
How do we make sure he
can't rocket into oblivion?

235
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.740
&gt;&gt; We can still flappy bird?

236
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.062
&gt;&gt; You can still flappy bird.

237
00:13:43.062 --> 00:13:44.780
You want to fix that?

238
00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.453
I think we should fix that?

239
00:13:46.453 --> 00:13:51.107
Do we have any hypotheses how to-
&gt;&gt; You can still put black at

240
00:13:51.107 --> 00:13:53.366
the top of your screen?

241
00:13:53.366 --> 00:13:54.872
&gt;&gt; Well, that means he could hit his head.

242
00:13:54.872 --> 00:13:57.804
But what if I don't want to
even let him double jump?

243
00:13:57.804 --> 00:14:03.004
&gt;&gt; Just make only when,
so you can only press,

244
00:14:03.004 --> 00:14:10.520
only the space key works if
you're touching the color.

245
00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:15.396
Okay, so you know that if,
oops, Space key pressed,

246
00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:19.856
then you can do that and
touching the color black.

247
00:14:19.856 --> 00:14:24.590
&gt;&gt; So let's try that out.

248
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.480
&gt;&gt; So we'll do the-
&gt;&gt; That only works if he's touching black.

249
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:32.473
Cuz then he won't be able to go up anymore
unless he's still touching the color

250
00:14:32.473 --> 00:14:33.011
black.

251
00:14:33.011 --> 00:14:34.980
Yeah, so let's try it out.

252
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:40.228
So if this and that, so
Space key is pressed, and

253
00:14:40.228 --> 00:14:46.432
we are touching the color, Black.

254
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.557
This will be interesting because I think
we can also get to a point where we're

255
00:14:52.557 --> 00:14:54.724
also touching and setting it to zero,
but we'll find out.

256
00:14:58.810 --> 00:14:59.748
Yep, that'll work.

257
00:14:59.748 --> 00:15:03.440
Another way to do it is if you look,
that totally works.

258
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.386
Let's just talk about other ways, right?

259
00:15:04.386 --> 00:15:06.910
When he's not jumping, what's his y speed?

260
00:15:09.903 --> 00:15:15.860
Zero When he is jumping,
it is a number, right?

261
00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.940
And so you could try to see,
there is a slight moment in time at

262
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.981
the top of the jump where it
might also be zero, right, where

263
00:15:22.981 --> 00:15:27.120
you could theoretically pull off a rare
double jump, so this is probably better.

264
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.170
Another way is to go back on that number.

265
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.627
The other option is to have
a variable that you turn on and

266
00:15:31.627 --> 00:15:33.264
off when he's jumping, all right?

267
00:15:33.264 --> 00:15:35.560
So if currently jumping, ignore this.

268
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.784
It all depends on what you need to do.

269
00:15:36.784 --> 00:15:41.280
For this, I think we should keep
this cuz I think this works.

270
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.100
So let's go with this mechanic right now.

271
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:48.632
I do wanna have him next
costume if he's jumping for

272
00:15:48.632 --> 00:15:54.430
my own, I just wanna see
what it looks like honestly.

273
00:15:57.476 --> 00:15:58.600
Put in there.

274
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:04.383
&gt;&gt; I have him when you start he just
falls out of the top of the screen.

275
00:16:04.383 --> 00:16:06.876
&gt;&gt; This is his jump motion.

276
00:16:06.876 --> 00:16:10.632
&gt;&gt; When he starts he just falls
off out of the [INAUDIBLE].

277
00:16:10.632 --> 00:16:14.832
&gt;&gt; So we've got something here, he jumps,

278
00:16:14.832 --> 00:16:21.553
looks like he's eating a taco which
is I think apropos for the day.

279
00:16:21.553 --> 00:16:27.460
That's probably not what this Sprite was
necessarily used for but I appreciate it.

280
00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.257
&gt;&gt; I like it-
&gt;&gt; You were the one who said it was good

281
00:16:29.257 --> 00:16:29.999
for jumping.

282
00:16:29.999 --> 00:16:30.898
&gt;&gt; And I stand by that.

283
00:16:30.898 --> 00:16:34.178
[LAUGH] I think it was the right choice.

284
00:16:34.178 --> 00:16:37.060
I am here for it.
