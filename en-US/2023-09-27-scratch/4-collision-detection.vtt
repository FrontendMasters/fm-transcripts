00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.340
This game isn't great right now.

2
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.880
I don't even know what this is.

3
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.200
It's just not great.

4
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.285
It's not great because yes, Arnold can
move left and right, that is true.

5
00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:13.040
That's the entirety of our game right now.

6
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.600
That's it.

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.170
That's all that's happening.

8
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.420
So you can see why that leaves
something to be desired.

9
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.544
I'm gonna put on Arnold at -100.

10
00:00:21.544 --> 00:00:27.870
And let's say, I'm gonna drop
back to Wes's basketball court.

11
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.360
And yeah,
looks like that'll be where he starts.

12
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.114
In most games, you interact with
something at some point, right?

13
00:00:40.114 --> 00:00:44.520
Perhaps the floor is lava, perhaps
there are ghosts chasing you, right?

14
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.849
Perhaps you're hitting a ball back and
forth,

15
00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:49.359
perhaps you're running
after some kind of prize.

16
00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.700
Perhaps you're just trying to make it
through a maze and there are walls.

17
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.508
There's usually something else in the game
rather than you just wandering around

18
00:00:55.508 --> 00:00:59.100
in the void by yourself only on a left and
right direction.

19
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.377
And that's where we add additional sprites
and we can have a whole bunch of ways that

20
00:01:03.377 --> 00:01:06.388
they know about roughly where,
things about each other.

21
00:01:06.388 --> 00:01:10.722
So let's go ahead and
let's add a second sprite.

22
00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:13.962
Do we have any choices here?

23
00:01:13.962 --> 00:01:15.526
&gt;&gt; Apple.

24
00:01:15.526 --> 00:01:22.108
&gt;&gt; Something I can talk to like
think a bat or a monkey, bat, ghost.

25
00:01:22.108 --> 00:01:23.486
&gt;&gt; Cheesy puffs.

26
00:01:25.577 --> 00:01:26.818
&gt;&gt; You wanna talk to a bowl
of cheesy puffs, okay,

27
00:01:26.818 --> 00:01:27.790
we'll talk to bowl of cheesy puffs.

28
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.656
&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH].

29
00:01:28.656 --> 00:01:32.230
&gt;&gt; I don't know how this is gonna go,
but here we are.

30
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.367
Let's toss an apple in there as well,
for good measure, cuz.

31
00:01:37.162 --> 00:01:38.571
&gt;&gt; Apple's right there.

32
00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:43.472
&gt;&gt; All right, sweet.

33
00:01:43.472 --> 00:01:44.474
So we've got that in place.

34
00:01:44.474 --> 00:01:48.703
And we can go ahead now and say,

35
00:01:48.703 --> 00:01:54.560
Arnold can see, roughly in the game loop,

36
00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.440
we'll say if, And
this is where the sensing is.

37
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.940
If touching, you can see if it's touching
a certain color that could be useful.

38
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.580
It's like if it's looking for something
purple, you can say touching color.

39
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.237
You could also say if it's
touching another sprite,

40
00:02:11.237 --> 00:02:14.460
which is kind of what
we want in this case.

41
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.179
So if it's touching,
either the mouse pointer or sprite.

42
00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:18.950
We'll do, I got an idea.

43
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.550
So if touching the cheesy puffs,

44
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:33.860
Arnold's going to say,
Yum for two seconds.

45
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.117
So now the game loop is gonna kind of go
through, and it's going to say, okay,

46
00:02:38.117 --> 00:02:40.740
if we're touching the cheesy puffs,
say yum.

47
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.100
Otherwise, we've got
the controls in place.

48
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.180
Now I've got some logic to,
I won't use the word game.

49
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.470
Let's call it an experience, right?

50
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.620
We've got some logic for
our experience right now.

51
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.160
So we can go ahead and we'll move him.

52
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.270
Yum.

53
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.493
Let's say for two seconds he walks away.

54
00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:05.830
So we have that in place.

55
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.116
And then we can say if we want to program
a different sprite, let's say the apple,

56
00:03:10.116 --> 00:03:13.160
we could say, all right,
when the green flag is clicked,

57
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.950
we'll give it a game loop.

58
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.819
For most things that we're doing outside
of making a cool little art thing or

59
00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.680
a story,
we're probably gonna have a game loop.

60
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.610
We'll say forever.

61
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:30.818
And for the apple, we'll say if
it's touching the mouse pointer,

62
00:03:33.487 --> 00:03:40.130
Say, Actually, let's do an if
else this time, just for funsies.

63
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.800
Drag that, get rid of that.

64
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.420
We'll go ahead and we'll say if else.

65
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.828
If we're touching the mouse pointer,
we will go ahead and say,

66
00:03:54.784 --> 00:03:57.820
Hello, I am an apple.

67
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.369
Typically a good thing for
an apple to say, right?

68
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.108
Otherwise, if the mouse pointer
is not touching it, I am lonely.

69
00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:13.188
Right, and so as you can see, the code
that controls Arnold is in Arnold,

70
00:04:13.188 --> 00:04:14.800
which we called sprite1.

71
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.584
Let's call him Arnold instead.

72
00:04:17.584 --> 00:04:18.682
He deserves to have a name.

73
00:04:20.713 --> 00:04:23.510
There's no code in the cheesy puffs.

74
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.010
The cheesy puffs only exist for
Arnold to know about them.

75
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.975
All right, and then the apple has
its own code that also starts and

76
00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:33.600
executes whenever.

77
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.850
Now if we wanted the apple to be there,
even if somebody drags it,

78
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.770
we could do some setup code.

79
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.520
But it's got its own code that runs
independently, but both kick off when

80
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.170
the green flag is pressed, so now you
can see the apple says I am lonely.

81
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.290
I'm an apple.

82
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.310
I am lonely.

83
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.310
I'm an apple.

84
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.830
I'm lonely.

85
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.940
I'm an apple.

86
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.020
It's either an apple or it's lonely,
never both simultaneously.

87
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.921
And then as Arnold gets close, he says
yum when it gets to the cheesy puffs and

88
00:05:00.921 --> 00:05:04.150
then runs away he is no longer satisfied,
right?

89
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.300
So we've got this idea of interaction.

90
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.705
We've got this idea of separating
the different pieces of code,

91
00:05:11.705 --> 00:05:13.970
so on and so forth, right?

92
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.260
And so we're getting some of
the initial pieces for a game.

93
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.020
So I'm thinking we should
probably make one, right?

94
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.050
It's a good time to make a game.
