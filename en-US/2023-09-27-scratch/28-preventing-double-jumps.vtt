00:00:00.274 --> 00:00:03.465
So we've got most of it in place now,
other than my bad level design.

2
00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:06.297
The only thing we'd have to solve for
is double jumping.

3
00:00:08.583 --> 00:00:11.923
Easiest way to do that is just keep track
of whether or not you're jumping, right?

4
00:00:11.923 --> 00:00:15.620
When you leave the ground,
say you're jumping.

5
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.706
When you're back on the ground,
say that you're not jumping.

6
00:00:19.706 --> 00:00:23.998
We could do that, yeah, I think we talked
about other ways to do it before, but

7
00:00:23.998 --> 00:00:25.964
that was when we had a known ground.

8
00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:31.744
In this platform, again, we don't know
the ground is always at negative 147.

9
00:00:31.744 --> 00:00:34.119
We have no idea, right?

10
00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:38.328
So what we'd have to do is, say jumping.

11
00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:53.413
And when he leaves the ground,
We just say that he's jumping.

12
00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:57.752
&gt;&gt; Okay, so here.

13
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.147
&gt;&gt; So
always set jumping to 0 at the beginning,

14
00:01:03.147 --> 00:01:06.283
cuz we know I've made that mistake
enough times, same with x velocity.

15
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:21.635
And when he lands,
we'll also set jumping to 0.

16
00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:28.296
&gt;&gt; Change, this is a [INAUDIBLE].

17
00:01:29.697 --> 00:01:31.939
&gt;&gt; We gotta make sure he can't
jump when he is jumping.

18
00:01:36.215 --> 00:01:37.380
So we'll say,

19
00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:49.729
If-
&gt;&gt; And I wrote this y.

20
00:01:56.261 --> 00:02:01.090
&gt;&gt; Jumping is 0, then let him jump,
otherwise don't do anything.

21
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.456
Let's just make sure it works,
he can't double jump anymore.

22
00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:07.090
His jump isn't high enough
to get anywhere anymore.

23
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.635
Again, my game is not good, but it works.

24
00:02:09.635 --> 00:02:11.385
Let's go down and see what we got.

25
00:02:19.555 --> 00:02:23.786
The easiest mistake that I
would've made in this section is

26
00:02:23.786 --> 00:02:27.859
forgetting the ones where
there might still be a change.

27
00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:32.790
It's letting a y sneak into this x
block will be the source of your bugs,

28
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.019
or a common source of your bugs.
