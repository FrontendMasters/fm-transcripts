1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.555
As well, and so
these are kind of here as well.

2
00:00:02.555 --> 00:00:04.604
And then there's one point I make,

3
00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:08.924
possibly the most dangerous game of
Etch A Sketch, as I lost immediately.

4
00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:13.787
This snake will never
clean up after itself.

5
00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.477
So it's basically, you might wanna keep
a score, there's a timer function as well,

6
00:00:21.477 --> 00:00:25.338
to see how long you can survive
before it goes back on itself.

7
00:00:25.338 --> 00:00:28.034
And we've got actually how to
make a realistic game of Snake.

8
00:00:28.034 --> 00:00:31.812
We're not gonna build this whole way
through cuz it's actually a little bit

9
00:00:31.812 --> 00:00:32.412
involved.

10
00:00:32.412 --> 00:00:35.013
But we'll talk through it cuz I
think it's super interesting, again,

11
00:00:35.013 --> 00:00:36.004
you can explore it as well.

12
00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:39.799
If you go to this one in particular,
I've gone through and

13
00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:42.050
commented on all the code as well.

14
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.970
So it's kinda go step by step
about what each piece is doing.

15
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.495
And I'll kinda explain it to
you while we're here together.

16
00:00:49.495 --> 00:00:53.572
But let's kinda just take a tour of it,
and you can kind of follow along.

17
00:00:53.572 --> 00:00:57.132
Let me move my comments out of the way
from when I cleaned up my code.

18
00:00:57.132 --> 00:01:00.785
Whee, cool, so
we've got a few things that happen.

19
00:01:00.785 --> 00:01:03.449
I've got when the green flag is
checked we have this set up,

20
00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.968
cuz I didn't want to see that
all over my thing, right?

21
00:01:05.968 --> 00:01:12.025
Which is delete everything,
start it in the right place,

22
00:01:12.025 --> 00:01:17.109
erase the page,
put everything back to normal.

23
00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:21.027
Our controls are the controls you've
seen 1,000 times at this point.

24
00:01:21.027 --> 00:01:23.753
It's like the Pac-Man rules,
which is that we always move forward.

25
00:01:27.394 --> 00:01:32.099
Touching the color purple,
you're done, cuz the snake is purple.

26
00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:39.090
If touching the apple, get longer is
really the only thing, and move the apple.

27
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.442
The interesting part is that
basically the way this works is,

28
00:01:43.442 --> 00:01:47.301
if you look at it,
there are two lists happening here.

29
00:01:52.337 --> 00:01:56.077
I'm keeping two lists
before it gets restarted,

30
00:01:56.077 --> 00:02:00.986
which is for every segment of the snake,
where those go, right?

31
00:02:00.986 --> 00:02:03.886
So what happens is,
when the snake moves forward,

32
00:02:03.886 --> 00:02:07.469
it stores its last position,
very similar to the platformer.

33
00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.433
It moves one forward, right,

34
00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:14.276
draw all those previous positions,
I just go through the list of the x and y.

35
00:02:14.276 --> 00:02:17.392
Remember when we did that,
going through the catchphrases?

36
00:02:17.392 --> 00:02:22.971
It's the same idea, go through the list,
use the pen tool to draw those segments,

37
00:02:22.971 --> 00:02:27.128
then pop the last one off until
you eat another apple, right?

38
00:02:27.128 --> 00:02:31.580
If you have more segments than the number
of apples eaten, shorten it again.

39
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.142
And then, you'll always have
a number of trailing ones,

40
00:02:34.142 --> 00:02:35.883
Caleb was talking about this earlier.

41
00:02:35.883 --> 00:02:40.203
A number of trailing snake segments where
they were previously losing the last one

42
00:02:40.203 --> 00:02:44.146
every time, but adding the new head of
the snake onto the end as well, and so

43
00:02:44.146 --> 00:02:46.172
we draw the snake behind it each time.

44
00:02:46.172 --> 00:02:51.074
It uses the same thing we saw in
the platformer with that, I'll show you,

45
00:02:51.074 --> 00:02:52.985
where is the, draw a snake?

46
00:02:55.444 --> 00:02:58.364
Right, does it run without
screen refresh as well?

47
00:02:58.364 --> 00:03:01.657
Right, so the snake is getting drawn but
you don't see it getting drawn,

48
00:03:01.657 --> 00:03:04.005
you can turn it off and
kinda see it, I'll show you.

49
00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:13.293
Let's hide those, [LAUGH] this
list is taking up a lot of space.

50
00:03:16.278 --> 00:03:18.732
So that's what happens if you have
the screen refresh turned on.

51
00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:22.471
It is literally drawing those pieces
of snake behind it every time,

52
00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:23.658
that's obnoxious.

53
00:03:23.658 --> 00:03:27.184
So you don't wanna see that, all you wanna
see is the end result of figuring out

54
00:03:27.184 --> 00:03:29.277
where I should have put
the pen down each time.

55
00:03:29.277 --> 00:03:35.222
It's actually using stamp, which is
basically, again, I'm using everything

56
00:03:35.222 --> 00:03:40.486
you understand about a pen, that motion,
to make a stamp of the sprite.

57
00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:44.303
So unlike infinite snake that just goes on
forever, this one will draw all the pieces

58
00:03:44.303 --> 00:03:46.636
right behind it for
whatever the length should be.

59
00:03:46.636 --> 00:03:50.347
&gt;&gt; Well, you don't have a head,
it's headless.

60
00:03:50.347 --> 00:03:55.265
&gt;&gt; So, once upon a time, there weren't
iPhones, there were Nokia phones, and

61
00:03:55.265 --> 00:04:00.196
they only [LAUGH] had a certain number of
pixels on them, and this is all you got.

62
00:04:00.196 --> 00:04:04.047
You didn't even get a real-looking apple,
you just got a different dot that you were

63
00:04:04.047 --> 00:04:06.362
chasing down, and to text,
you only had numbers.

64
00:04:06.362 --> 00:04:09.607
And if you wanted to make an S,
you had to hit 9 like four times, or

65
00:04:09.607 --> 00:04:10.731
7 four times, okay?

66
00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:15.962
Life is hard sometimes, [LAUGH] I also
had to walk uphill to school both ways,

67
00:04:15.962 --> 00:04:18.269
I don't know how that happened.

68
00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.334
[INAUDIBLE]

69
00:04:21.334 --> 00:04:25.860
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's pixel style.

70
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.681
&gt;&gt; Really?

71
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:30.984
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; This is the snake I grew up with, okay?

72
00:04:30.984 --> 00:04:31.900
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Can you run into your tail?

73
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.942
&gt;&gt; This is your dad snake.

74
00:04:32.942 --> 00:04:36.093
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Can you run into your tail or no?

75
00:04:36.093 --> 00:04:36.886
&gt;&gt; No.

76
00:04:36.886 --> 00:04:37.548
&gt;&gt; Does it work that way?

77
00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:41.194
&gt;&gt; I had it set on Nokia Snake rules,
you cannot run into your own tail.

78
00:04:41.194 --> 00:04:42.618
[LAUGH] I followed Nokia Snake,

79
00:04:42.618 --> 00:04:45.806
Margaret, are you fact checking
whether it was true in Nokia snake?

80
00:04:45.806 --> 00:04:48.686
[LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; I am pretty sure

81
00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:52.202
that under official Snake rules
you cannot turn back on yourself.

82
00:04:52.202 --> 00:04:53.713
&gt;&gt; I don't think you can.

83
00:04:53.713 --> 00:05:00.145
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; I have the Snake game.

84
00:05:00.145 --> 00:05:02.725
&gt;&gt; You have the Snake game, okay?

85
00:05:02.725 --> 00:05:04.076
&gt;&gt; What?

86
00:05:04.076 --> 00:05:08.806
&gt;&gt; In Google Snake, if you turn
back on yourself, nothing happens.

87
00:05:08.806 --> 00:05:10.571
&gt;&gt; Correct.

88
00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:11.976
&gt;&gt; Did I get fact-checked?

89
00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:14.181
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm playing it right now.

90
00:05:14.181 --> 00:05:17.360
&gt;&gt; I am pretty sure I have played,
yeah, can you turn back or

91
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.825
you're just showing it?

92
00:05:18.825 --> 00:05:21.302
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just showing them
what it was like, but yeah.

93
00:05:21.302 --> 00:05:25.029
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is the-
&gt;&gt; The point of Snake is it gets harder

94
00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:26.823
when the tail gets longer.

95
00:05:26.823 --> 00:05:28.794
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think you can't double
back on yourself, cuz then-

96
00:05:28.794 --> 00:05:31.879
&gt;&gt; The hard part was not to bump into

97
00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:33.369
other snakes.

98
00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:36.438
&gt;&gt; The original Snake-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] OG Snake.

99
00:05:36.438 --> 00:05:40.810
&gt;&gt; You are the snake, you continue to grow
until you fill up the whole screen almost.

100
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.919
&gt;&gt; Do you see the technology
we were working with?

101
00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.945
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is basically inspired from

102
00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:52.266
a 1976 arcade game called Blockade,
you really wanna go deep.

103
00:05:52.266 --> 00:05:57.055
&gt;&gt; This is the version of Snake that we
are looking at, that snake can go through,

104
00:05:57.055 --> 00:05:58.446
I think it looks like.

105
00:05:58.446 --> 00:05:59.067
&gt;&gt; To the other side?

106
00:05:59.067 --> 00:05:59.762
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

107
00:05:59.762 --> 00:06:00.852
&gt;&gt; There's no walls?

108
00:06:00.852 --> 00:06:05.529
&gt;&gt; Well, it's like the old Pac-Man
where if you come out of one side,

109
00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:08.171
it comes out on the other side, yeah.

110
00:06:08.171 --> 00:06:12.432
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was thinking this is
what's gonna happen on my flight home,

111
00:06:12.432 --> 00:06:15.509
right now my snake does
not go through the walls.

112
00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:21.530
It might by the time [LAUGH] you
watch this, I'm like, that's cool.

113
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:27.031
But yeah, the pen tool, other than the
idea that I'm keeping track of two x's and

114
00:06:27.031 --> 00:06:31.036
y's simultaneously to kinda keep the x and
y coordinates.

115
00:06:31.036 --> 00:06:35.269
Cuz, for job descriptors in the room,
there is no objects or

116
00:06:35.269 --> 00:06:38.845
anything, you only have
arrays of single values.

117
00:06:38.845 --> 00:06:42.587
Other than that, it's like a lot of the
same concepts we've talked about in this,

118
00:06:42.587 --> 00:06:44.358
just with a pen tool drawing behind it.

119
00:06:44.358 --> 00:06:48.678
So I would check that out,
let me just show you one more

120
00:06:48.678 --> 00:06:53.586
cool thing that I would encourage
you on your explorations.

121
00:06:53.586 --> 00:06:56.808
And all of these are linked from
the website with how to do them and

122
00:06:56.808 --> 00:06:58.129
stuff along those lines.

123
00:07:00.601 --> 00:07:04.488
Check it out, there's a video sensing, and

124
00:07:04.488 --> 00:07:08.486
this is just the stupidest
thing in the world.

125
00:07:08.486 --> 00:07:13.712
I think I might have to, hold on,
let's go into my projects.

126
00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:20.559
Where's my video cat?

127
00:07:32.392 --> 00:07:39.800
When I, Touch the cat, it says hello,
so now I am the sprite.

128
00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:44.519
&gt;&gt; I didn't know you were a cat.

129
00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:49.384
&gt;&gt; I'm not the cat, I'm me,
the cat is the cat.

130
00:07:49.384 --> 00:07:52.590
Right, and so you can actually use
the webcam you can control stuff through.

131
00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.688
There's a bunch of really
cool extensions for

132
00:07:54.688 --> 00:07:56.471
how you can build on top of this as well.

133
00:07:56.471 --> 00:08:00.235
&gt;&gt; You can kind of try to,
can you do Fruit Ninja?

134
00:08:04.342 --> 00:08:05.978
&gt;&gt; Yo.

135
00:08:05.978 --> 00:08:09.592
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Very interesting to play on

136
00:08:09.592 --> 00:08:10.195
the ride home.

137
00:08:10.195 --> 00:08:13.255
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Boy, there went my weekend.

138
00:08:13.255 --> 00:08:14.395
[LAUGH]
