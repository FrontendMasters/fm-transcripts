00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.903
Cool.
So

2
00:00:00.903 --> 00:00:05.010
like we've got a bunch of
those kind of pieces in place.

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.460
And we can have that there.

4
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.750
Like there are other
ways that we can do this.

5
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.645
Now, we said before, what if the game
only got faster every like 10 points or

6
00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:19.620
something like that, or every five points.

7
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.290
Every three points, right?

8
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.830
And so we need a way to figure out.

9
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.940
What we should do in this case, right?

10
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.740
And so we need some math to be
like every three times, right?

11
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.740
And this is there is a thing that we
can use, and it's called the modulo.

12
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.240
Check this out.

13
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.612
And so modulo,
it's kinda like division, but

14
00:00:43.612 --> 00:00:47.990
it tells you how many
numbers are leftover, right?

15
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.410
So for instance,
how many times does three go into six?

16
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.200
Two.

17
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.110
What's the remainder?

18
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.470
&gt;&gt; Three [INAUDIBLE].

19
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.337
&gt;&gt; Right, cause it goes into
there's nothing left over.

20
00:01:00.337 --> 00:01:04.218
How many times does two go into seven or
three go into seven?

21
00:01:04.218 --> 00:01:05.629
&gt;&gt; Two.

22
00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:07.076
&gt;&gt; Two, and what's leftover?

23
00:01:07.076 --> 00:01:07.672
&gt;&gt; One.

24
00:01:07.672 --> 00:01:11.290
&gt;&gt; One and so
the module in that case would be one.

25
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.135
So we know that zeros every third time,
right and so we could say,

26
00:01:16.135 --> 00:01:19.690
for any of the logic here, right?

27
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.371
For like the creating a clone,
see I started writing code inside Evad.

28
00:01:26.621 --> 00:01:31.600
We could say only create a clone
every time the score had some

29
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.990
multiple of three right and
so we could do is I say if,

30
00:01:46.215 --> 00:01:53.559
Let's do equals, If the score,

31
00:01:56.601 --> 00:02:01.090
Module three, nope.

32
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.090
I put my module away.

33
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.535
It's a score, module three.

34
00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:15.691
Zero, which means it's either 3,
6, 9, 12, so on and so forth.

35
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.959
Then, we'll create a clone of Evad.

36
00:02:26.928 --> 00:02:27.480
Let's try it out.

37
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.490
I'm taking off that edge mechanic.

38
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.301
I'm not doing it anymore,
I'm not living like this.

39
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.558
Evad's the problem, not the edge.

40
00:02:43.953 --> 00:02:45.110
All right, so we got one taco.

41
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.305
We got two tacos.

42
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.748
We get three tacos.

43
00:02:52.545 --> 00:02:53.350
I don't see any Evad.

44
00:02:54.517 --> 00:02:56.505
&gt;&gt; Equals 50.

45
00:02:56.505 --> 00:02:59.330
&gt;&gt; Did I not change it cuz I was
too busy moving stuff around?

46
00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

47
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.730
&gt;&gt; So I had to get, equals zero.

48
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.590
It'll never equal 50 cuz you
will never get 50 left over.

49
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.890
Did my code do what I wanted it to?

50
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.300
No, did it do what I told it to do?

51
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.340
Yes, it did.

52
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.307
All right, one,

53
00:03:22.105 --> 00:03:25.063
So they chase only when they get close,
and

54
00:03:25.063 --> 00:03:28.230
they come in one every three times, right?

55
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.030
So we've got a game, this game works.

56
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.804
There's a ton of ways you can improve.

57
00:03:31.804 --> 00:03:34.050
You can have the speed
go on a module as well.

58
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.615
You can do a lot of things
like a little bit right here,

59
00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:40.208
there's a lot of ways that you can
expand this game and you totally should.
