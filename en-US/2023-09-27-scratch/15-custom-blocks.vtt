00:00:00.213 --> 00:00:05.333
Let's say I wanna have a game where
apples are raining from the sky, right?

2
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:09.011
And we have a character that
picks them up and catches them.

3
00:00:09.011 --> 00:00:13.991
Things I don't wanna do with my life
is have to make a whole bunch of

4
00:00:13.991 --> 00:00:16.177
different apples, right?

5
00:00:16.177 --> 00:00:21.474
Now, we saw with before,
we can use clones, right?

6
00:00:21.474 --> 00:00:25.568
But that's still, I could do that,
I could have an apple fall and

7
00:00:25.568 --> 00:00:28.335
then delete the clone,
we can try that out.

8
00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:33.945
The other trick that you use a lot
in games is when that apple's gone,

9
00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:38.422
when it's at the bottom,
I can just reuse it, right?

10
00:00:38.422 --> 00:00:42.125
Something, something,
garbage collection in JavaScript.

11
00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.383
Yes, you can create a bunch of objects and
have the garbage collector clean them up.

12
00:00:45.383 --> 00:00:49.811
Or you could just wait until it
leaves the screen, move it back,

13
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:54.003
something, something,
infinite scroll, I don't know.

14
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:55.401
So we can try that out.

15
00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:59.999
And so what we'll say is forever,
change it by that.

16
00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:06.364
And then what we wanna do is to,
basically, if it hits the bottom,

17
00:01:06.364 --> 00:01:12.063
let's see, it looks like it's
all the way down to 180.

18
00:01:12.063 --> 00:01:15.724
And sometimes going for strict equality
is a problem, but we'll try it out.

19
00:01:15.724 --> 00:01:17.690
We can always adjust it if we need to.

20
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.237
If, and
then we're gonna say the y position is

21
00:01:22.237 --> 00:01:26.791
less than 180 cuz it's a negative number.

22
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:32.296
So you drag in that,
we'll say less than, Equal,

23
00:01:32.296 --> 00:01:37.292
let's say less than 178 so we got
a little bit of wiggle room in there.

24
00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:40.237
And we can go into motion and
get the current y position.

25
00:01:42.377 --> 00:01:48.095
Right, if that is true,
Then I kinda want you

26
00:01:48.095 --> 00:01:54.034
to do this initial setup piece again,
so we'll grab that real quick.

27
00:01:54.034 --> 00:02:00.128
We'll duplicate it, say that and that.

28
00:02:00.128 --> 00:02:05.307
So fall, and
if you've fallen as far as you can fall,

29
00:02:05.307 --> 00:02:09.580
go back up at the top and
do it again, right?

30
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.635
And so now, Let's see.

31
00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:23.192
My code, y position, Change by velocity,

32
00:02:30.485 --> 00:02:33.141
Less than negative 178.

33
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:37.269
My code did what I told it to,
it falls, it falls.

34
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.770
There's a documentary with two
Norse gods where he has to fall for

35
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.247
half an hour repeatedly,
this is basically the same concept.

36
00:02:49.247 --> 00:02:51.332
The movie's called Thor: Ragnarok.

37
00:02:51.332 --> 00:02:55.139
This is basically the same idea where it
just keeps falling into the same hole,

38
00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.744
except this one the velocity
starts over every time.

39
00:02:57.744 --> 00:03:02.119
But we can use this mechanic to
create the simulation, even,

40
00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:04.232
of multiple apples falling.

41
00:03:04.232 --> 00:03:07.235
Which is kind of what's happening, but

42
00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:12.815
because it's happening in the same place,
it kinda feels a little weird.

43
00:03:12.815 --> 00:03:17.202
So what could we do to make it
feel a little bit more natural?

44
00:03:17.202 --> 00:03:20.430
If it's raining apples, do they all
come from the same place in the sky?

45
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.538
No, they come from all over the place,
right?

46
00:03:22.538 --> 00:03:25.321
You've been in an apple storm before,
right?

47
00:03:25.321 --> 00:03:29.809
So what can we do to simulate a little bit
more like they're coming from all over

48
00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:32.192
the place, by also using the same apple?

49
00:03:32.192 --> 00:03:36.626
&gt;&gt; Pick random position, so

50
00:03:36.626 --> 00:03:41.670
set x to pick random in there.

51
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.276
&gt;&gt; Yep, let's do that.

52
00:03:44.276 --> 00:03:50.330
Set x to pick random,
let's do the same thing we did the tacos,

53
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.515
somewhere between negative 160,
and was this 220?

54
00:03:56.515 --> 00:04:02.594
Negative 220 and 220, so it's not all
the way on the edge so we see it.

55
00:04:02.594 --> 00:04:06.722
We're gonna do that here.

56
00:04:06.722 --> 00:04:09.776
So here we'll go somewhere
between these two and the 176.

57
00:04:09.776 --> 00:04:13.403
So it falls in the middle the first time,
and over here.

58
00:04:13.403 --> 00:04:17.570
Next thing you know, all right,
it kinda feels like it's raining apples.

59
00:04:21.058 --> 00:04:22.343
I'm just gonna look at that for
a few seconds.

60
00:04:22.343 --> 00:04:27.241
All right, here's the thing that's
kinda bothering me is I kinda want

61
00:04:27.241 --> 00:04:29.293
that in the beginning, too.

62
00:04:29.293 --> 00:04:32.699
But you notice it's getting real tedious,
right?

63
00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.612
Let's say I want the first apple to
be somewhere in that random one too.

64
00:04:36.612 --> 00:04:40.737
I could duplicate this again and
put that there, and

65
00:04:40.737 --> 00:04:43.282
now it starts in a random place.

66
00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:45.682
But what if I wanna add even more logic?

67
00:04:45.682 --> 00:04:47.822
This is getting annoying, right?

68
00:04:47.822 --> 00:04:50.851
I'm getting tired of duplicating things.

69
00:04:50.851 --> 00:04:53.196
Is there a way that we
can make our own blocks?

70
00:04:53.196 --> 00:04:53.947
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

71
00:04:53.947 --> 00:04:55.348
&gt;&gt; Yeah, where?

72
00:04:55.348 --> 00:04:57.294
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you go down to My Blocks.

73
00:04:57.294 --> 00:04:59.111
&gt;&gt; My Blocks?
&gt;&gt; And click Make a Block.

74
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:03.767
&gt;&gt; Make a Block,
we're gonna call this one Reset Apple, or

75
00:05:03.767 --> 00:05:06.882
Put Apple at the Top, what do we like?

76
00:05:10.224 --> 00:05:12.726
Drop Apple.

77
00:05:12.726 --> 00:05:15.562
Cool, and that's it,
it doesn't need to take any arguments.

78
00:05:15.562 --> 00:05:20.523
So we'll define this idea
of dropping an apple,

79
00:05:20.523 --> 00:05:24.403
where we'll take this code here off.

80
00:05:24.403 --> 00:05:27.066
And we'll say, we've got this
new idea of dropping an apple.

81
00:05:30.576 --> 00:05:34.272
And now, when the game starts,
get ready to drop an apple.

82
00:05:34.272 --> 00:05:39.110
And every time that apple falls to
the ground, we'll just run this code.

83
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.912
Now, if we need to change any of
the mechanics of an apple dropping,

84
00:05:43.912 --> 00:05:46.455
we simply can edit this right here.

85
00:05:46.455 --> 00:05:50.015
So now it runs, it calls that again.

86
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.670
My randomness doesn't feel great,
but it is, As it goes over and

87
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.746
over and
it keeps moving that apple around.

88
00:05:58.746 --> 00:06:02.346
Awesome, so now anytime you find
yourself doing the same thing over and

89
00:06:02.346 --> 00:06:03.433
over again, right?

90
00:06:03.433 --> 00:06:09.300
You can make your own block and you can
have it set to drop the apple like that.
