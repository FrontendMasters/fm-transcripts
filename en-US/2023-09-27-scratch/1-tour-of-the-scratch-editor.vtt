1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.777
So let me give you a tour
of the scratch editor,

2
00:00:01.777 --> 00:00:04.549
we can see all the different pieces so
that we're familiar when I use terms or

3
00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.350
when I point at things or when I reference
something, we know what I'm talking about.

4
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.940
Over here we have the stage, this is where
all of our hard work becomes manifest.

5
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.212
If you need more room,
you can make it a little smaller.

6
00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:16.338
You can make it bigger.

7
00:00:16.338 --> 00:00:19.992
You can make it really big if you
just want to see the end result and

8
00:00:19.992 --> 00:00:23.350
just like revel in all
of your amazing work.

9
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.793
Then we have a bunch of sprites.

10
00:00:24.793 --> 00:00:26.590
Right now we have one sprite.

11
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.840
I had to look this up.

12
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.190
The cat's name is Arnold, okay?

13
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.990
He has a name.

14
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.820
It's Arnold.

15
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.890
That's his name.

16
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.140
Just sprites you program
each sprite independently.

17
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.598
If you want to make a new sprite,

18
00:00:38.598 --> 00:00:43.130
you can go over here where you can search
through the entire library of sprites.

19
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.510
With a whole bunch of different options.

20
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.515
You can upload one that you have,
or what I like, and I might spend,

21
00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:53.311
I will not do too much during this
workshop because let me tell you

22
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:56.824
the rabbit hole that I will go
into of you can kind of paint and

23
00:00:56.824 --> 00:01:00.920
draw your own sprite and
kinda create your own art as you go along.

24
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.370
On a given sprite,
they have multiple costumes.

25
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.340
Now if you can see, these costumes can
be used for a bunch of different things.

26
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.320
They can be totally different
looks if you're making a story.

27
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.080
In this case, the two costumes,
if you went back and forth real quick,

28
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.470
almost look like Arnold is walking, right?

29
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.304
So you might rotate between two different
costumes on a sprite to create the look

30
00:01:21.304 --> 00:01:23.120
that your sprite is walking.

31
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.968
On a sprite,
you can also just kind of go back and

32
00:01:26.968 --> 00:01:30.680
forth between these two tabs costumes,
code, costumes, code.

33
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.900
There is also a tab called sounds.

34
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.170
Now, I used to be a middle school teacher.

35
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.970
I know how this goes.

36
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.165
I'm going to act like
this tab does not exist.

37
00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:43.090
[LAUGH] At no point
are we touching this tab.

38
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.928
Because I know what happens.

39
00:01:47.928 --> 00:01:51.436
Cool, so we've got the code,
we got the costumes on a given sprite,

40
00:01:51.436 --> 00:01:52.961
you can switch between them.

41
00:01:52.961 --> 00:01:56.662
One way if you're in the code to see
what sprite you're working with is,

42
00:01:56.662 --> 00:01:58.675
doesn't really help with a blank one.

43
00:01:58.675 --> 00:02:02.684
But you can go ahead,
you'll see this sprite up in this corner.

44
00:02:02.684 --> 00:02:08.607
At one point today, either you or
me will add code to the wrong sprite and

45
00:02:08.607 --> 00:02:12.868
then wonder why our stuff isn't working,
right?

46
00:02:12.868 --> 00:02:16.338
At one point you could even
add some code to the backdrop.

47
00:02:16.338 --> 00:02:20.730
At one point I might look in
here which has fewer options and

48
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.622
wonder where my code is.

49
00:02:22.622 --> 00:02:24.258
Someone to remind me or
it might be you, but

50
00:02:24.258 --> 00:02:25.854
at one point you'll be in the wrong area.

51
00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:26.540
It's okay.

52
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.920
It happens to the best of us.

53
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.323
You can also click on the sprite itself,
double click on it,

54
00:02:31.323 --> 00:02:34.370
to switch over to that sprite as well.

55
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.620
All right, so
we talked about adding a sprite.

56
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.300
I'm going to get rid of this blank one.

57
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.630
We've got the code.

58
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.540
We've got the costumes.

59
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.740
We'll talk about the blocks in a second.

60
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.970
There's also the ability to add backdrops,
so you can choose a backdrop.

61
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.220
Do we have a favorite one right now?

62
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.750
Which one?

63
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.770
&gt;&gt; The basketball 1.

64
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.670
&gt;&gt; Basketball.

65
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.880
&gt;&gt; Which is right there.

66
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.752
&gt;&gt; Which is right there.

67
00:02:55.752 --> 00:02:56.815
There we go, cool.

68
00:02:56.815 --> 00:02:58.375
So now I can set the scene.

69
00:02:58.375 --> 00:03:00.095
Again, you can upload your own art.

70
00:03:00.095 --> 00:03:01.235
You can draw your own art.

71
00:03:01.235 --> 00:03:02.035
You can do whatever you want.

72
00:03:02.035 --> 00:03:04.355
We will do some of that
today when we need it.

73
00:03:04.355 --> 00:03:05.846
You can have multiple backdrops and

74
00:03:05.846 --> 00:03:09.585
switch between them the same way
that you switch between costumes.

75
00:03:09.585 --> 00:03:13.145
All right, we're almost, we got like
one or two more things left here.

76
00:03:13.145 --> 00:03:17.507
Next, we've got the main event which is
all the different code blocks that we can

77
00:03:17.507 --> 00:03:18.880
snap together.

78
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.101
Let's talk about some
of the categories here.

79
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:22.870
Motion, does what you think it does.

80
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.466
It moves your sprite a whole bunch of
different ways whether it's left and

81
00:03:26.466 --> 00:03:29.192
right and we'll talk about
what that means in a second,

82
00:03:29.192 --> 00:03:32.600
turning it in a given direction,
all sorts of different options.

83
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.027
Looks, this is useful if you want to make
it talk, you want to change the costume

84
00:03:36.027 --> 00:03:39.220
from one with the right foot forward
to the one with the left foot forward.

85
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.830
Or if you're writing a story,
if they want to change actual costumes.

86
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.580
You can do color effects,
which at one point you will do,

87
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.990
just because I can't stop you.

88
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.070
Sound doesn't exist.

89
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.694
Events, these are the main thing,

90
00:03:51.694 --> 00:03:55.470
which is something has to happen in
order to trigger your code to run.

91
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.840
The most common one is this
when green flag is clicked.

92
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.250
This is the green flag.

93
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.219
When you click the green flag,

94
00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:07.700
whatever comes after when green flag
is clicked is what happens next.

95
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.160
That's how this works.

96
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.279
You can also do stuff when
a given key is pressed.

97
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.020
You can do, when the sprite is clicked,
various things.

98
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.570
For my adult friends in the room, yeah,

99
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.730
it's kind of like events in JavaScript,
right?

100
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.650
Various things happen, you can have
a callback, same basic concept.

101
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.370
You might be like, well,
what happens if I have two green flags?

102
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.335
It's almost like there's an event loop
under the hood that is processing it with

103
00:04:33.335 --> 00:04:37.420
everything, the same way it works in
the browser cuz it's in the browser.

104
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.260
There's also this idea
to receive a message.

105
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.565
So any given event is a node,
any given sprite can trigger a message

106
00:04:44.565 --> 00:04:50.455
that gets broadcast and then any other
sprite that cares can listen to it.

107
00:04:50.455 --> 00:04:53.748
If that'll make sense to you,
we will talk about it in context later.

108
00:04:53.748 --> 00:04:59.680
Control, here we have a bunch of
different ways to rationalize our code.

109
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.600
We can say, like, hey,
if this, then do that.

110
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.800
Otherwise, do the other thing.

111
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.500
Or repeat this ten times.

112
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.310
Different ways to kind of have
control flow in our code.

113
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.680
Then we've got sensing, which is like,
okay, if it's touching the mouse pointer,

114
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.020
if it's touching this other sprite,
if a given key is being pressed.

115
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.727
A bunch of ways of like
what is going on in terms

116
00:05:19.727 --> 00:05:23.237
of the actual interaction with
other sprites in the game.

117
00:05:23.237 --> 00:05:27.960
Operators because it's summer
who doesn't love math, right?

118
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.234
At some point you might need to add
thing see if your health is less than 0,

119
00:05:33.234 --> 00:05:38.270
game over, right or your points
are more than 100 you win, right?

120
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.080
A lot of different kinds of ways to think
about the different values in your game.

121
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.553
If the word apple contains the letter A,

122
00:05:46.553 --> 00:05:50.640
various things you might slot into
the different control blocks.

123
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.353
Now, if you look, each one of these
has a different shape and at no point,

124
00:05:55.353 --> 00:05:59.570
if we look in the control section,
there's a diamond shape.

125
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.220
Guess what goes in the diamond
shape in the control blocks?

126
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.190
The diamond shaped ones here, right?

127
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.447
It's like Legos, if you try to put
the circle blocks into the diamond holes,

128
00:06:09.447 --> 00:06:12.280
it's not going to work super well for
you, right?

129
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.960
And yeah, it's okay.

130
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.771
We've got this idea of variables, which
is occasionally we need to hold on and

131
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:19.550
store information.

132
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.830
We'll talk about that in a little bit.

133
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.090
We can change them, stuff that.

134
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.948
And then blocks, which are the ability
make our own custom blocks

135
00:06:27.948 --> 00:06:30.786
that we might need at various points.

136
00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:32.305
Yeah Chloe.

137
00:06:32.305 --> 00:06:36.326
&gt;&gt; You can go to the bottom left corner-
&gt;&gt; Right here.

138
00:06:36.326 --> 00:06:38.000
&gt;&gt; And get more blocks.

139
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.631
&gt;&gt; Yep we will do that towards the end
there's also a bunch of extensions that

140
00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:43.210
you can install.

141
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.230
We will be using the Pen one today.

142
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.587
And I'll show you the video
sensing one cause it's cool.

143
00:06:49.587 --> 00:06:53.860
But you can also if you've got like Makey
Makey skills like this little controller,

144
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.668
you can hook up to a banana, or you
make your banana into a game controller.

145
00:06:57.668 --> 00:06:59.868
As well some Lego Mindstorms and

146
00:06:59.868 --> 00:07:03.621
some other hardware stuff
that you can plug in as well.

147
00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:06.854
You can also make music as if there
was sound supported on this, but

148
00:07:06.854 --> 00:07:08.080
I don't think there is.

149
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.010
There is.

150
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:13.930
And then lastly, down here very subtly
is this thing called the backpack.

151
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.528
The backpack is a way to transfer
stuff in between projects.

152
00:07:19.528 --> 00:07:24.779
&gt;&gt; If you go to search first right and
you're too lazy to type in donut,

153
00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:28.115
you can type homer and you'll get a donut.

154
00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:33.288
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Today I learned [LAUGH]

155
00:07:33.288 --> 00:07:39.633
today I learned bonus lesson
from my teaching assistant.

156
00:07:39.633 --> 00:07:41.948
You all saw the backpack.

157
00:07:41.948 --> 00:07:45.251
So a backpack is a way let's say you
made a bunch of really cool sprites for

158
00:07:45.251 --> 00:07:46.943
one game and you're making the SQL.

159
00:07:46.943 --> 00:07:50.847
Write the backpack is a way that you
can take stuff from one project,

160
00:07:50.847 --> 00:07:52.570
put in the backpack.

161
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.660
You can bring it to the next project,
right?

162
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.227
You can't really copy and
paste between projects, but

163
00:07:57.227 --> 00:08:00.128
you can move it into the backpack,
move it out of the backpack.

164
00:08:00.128 --> 00:08:04.205
You can take like common code
blocks that you might use.

165
00:08:04.205 --> 00:08:11.440
And put them in or out the backpack
various sprites so on and so forth.

166
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.974
So anything that you might be using more
than once, you can put it the backpack, or

167
00:08:14.974 --> 00:08:18.049
if you need to just move something
from one project to the next cuz yeah,

168
00:08:18.049 --> 00:08:20.480
I love this sprite that I made,
you put in the backpack.

169
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.140
You take it out of the backpack,
you're good to go.

170
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.773
The only other thing to kind of point
out is there's some zoom controls.

171
00:08:27.773 --> 00:08:30.166
We'll talk about some of the sprite
controls in a little bit.

172
00:08:30.166 --> 00:08:33.118
But also right clicking or
to finger clicking for

173
00:08:33.118 --> 00:08:37.663
most of us born in the modern era will
give you the ability to delete a block.

174
00:08:37.663 --> 00:08:39.960
The other way that is a lot easier.

175
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.390
Take it, you drag it back where you
got it from, it goes away, right?

176
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.090
That's the large amount of the editor.

177
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.230
You can save stuff.

178
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.773
You can make a new one.

179
00:08:49.773 --> 00:08:50.871
Other than that,

180
00:08:50.871 --> 00:08:55.861
I think we've got most of what we need to
kind of we understand the lay of the land.

181
00:08:55.861 --> 00:08:59.080
And we can go and
start to get our first sprite moving.
