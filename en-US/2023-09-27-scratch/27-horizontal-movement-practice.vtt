1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.823
I may give you the hypothesis
on how to do left and right.

2
00:00:03.823 --> 00:00:05.566
I'm gonna give you
a chance to try it out and

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:08.001
then catch up to this before I
keep talking and keep coding.

4
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.854
Here's how left and right is gonna work.

5
00:00:10.854 --> 00:00:14.989
Almost the exact same, right?

6
00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:20.057
Except we wanna check for
X first cuz we let them go in one way and

7
00:00:20.057 --> 00:00:26.024
then shoot up, don't go into walls
before we shoot you out of the walls.

8
00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:28.153
And so we wanna do a very similar thing.

9
00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:32.986
The only difference is we're
gonna do the same thing for x.

10
00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:37.933
But we wanna have the absolute value
of velocity y plus the absolute value

11
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:38.998
of velocity x.

12
00:00:38.998 --> 00:00:40.347
So I'll make those two variables for

13
00:00:40.347 --> 00:00:42.927
you and I'll show you what will pop
in there when we have them in place.

14
00:00:42.927 --> 00:00:49.354
But the same logic, we just wanna
do x first, do the xs, right?

15
00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:54.707
And then do the y's, and
this will end up being,

16
00:00:54.707 --> 00:00:59.809
let me make the two variables so
you can see it.

17
00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.583
We'll do last x and we'll do velocity x.

18
00:01:06.662 --> 00:01:09.699
The one part I'll leave on the screen for

19
00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:14.446
you just as a helpful cheat code,
is not that, not that at all.

20
00:01:14.446 --> 00:01:15.897
So we're going to plus.

21
00:01:19.993 --> 00:01:22.197
And what the end result is gonna be is,
okay,

22
00:01:22.197 --> 00:01:25.632
let's say we were supposed to move
5 steps forward and 10 steps up.

23
00:01:25.632 --> 00:01:28.085
So that's 15 altogether.

24
00:01:28.085 --> 00:01:32.632
Do spend 5 of them on the forward and
10 of them on the vertical.

25
00:01:32.632 --> 00:01:36.484
And then see when we should have
stopped at any given point.

26
00:01:36.484 --> 00:01:39.133
So effectively we'll have
the x before the y, but

27
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:43.244
let me just set up the end result piece
cuz you will forget, cuz I will forget.

28
00:01:43.244 --> 00:01:47.225
Cuz this is about you and
not about future me and what I need.

29
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:52.612
So when you get the x happening first, and
I will do it with you in a second, but

30
00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:55.571
this will give you a second to
catch up and then try it out.

31
00:01:55.571 --> 00:02:01.515
It will be the absolute value of both.

32
00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:06.941
Right, so basically we need a version
in here as well that does x.

33
00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:10.865
And I would do the sliding
motion from before, but

34
00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:14.330
you can just have it go
normal if you want to.

35
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.620
Up to you,
how far you want to take it, but

36
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.244
then we will do it all
together in 10 minutes.

37
00:02:19.244 --> 00:02:22.507
That way I can check on everyone, make
sure everyone's got something working.

38
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:28.526
All right, so
we wanna get the x part working.

39
00:02:28.526 --> 00:02:32.298
So we can start off by having
them move x and y first, right?

40
00:02:32.298 --> 00:02:34.632
That way it's easier test.

41
00:02:34.632 --> 00:02:39.038
So we can say

42
00:02:39.038 --> 00:02:44.782
if, Not there.

43
00:02:44.782 --> 00:02:49.614
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Yep, [LAUGH].

44
00:02:49.614 --> 00:02:54.764
If the right arrow is pressed, right?

45
00:02:54.764 --> 00:02:58.191
We want to, no, go back in there.

46
00:02:58.191 --> 00:03:01.740
I just wanna move the entire thing,
out of the way.

47
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:09.005
If the right arrow is pressed, then
let's go ahead and set the x velocity.

48
00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:11.949
We're gonna do the same drifting
motion that we had before but

49
00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.280
I liked it cuz it felt good and
I like to feel good.

50
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.814
We'll set that to, let's call it, 10.

51
00:03:17.814 --> 00:03:26.808
Not last X, we want velocity X to 10.

52
00:03:26.808 --> 00:03:30.377
If the Y key is pressed,
don't, you know what,

53
00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:34.133
we'll do it down here,
I'm not living like this.

54
00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:38.247
If the Y key is pressed,

55
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.237
Y key, left arrow is pressed.

56
00:03:43.237 --> 00:03:45.094
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I mean,

57
00:03:45.094 --> 00:03:48.214
I could have right be the right arrow and
left be the Y key.

58
00:03:48.214 --> 00:03:51.775
That's a thing that I could do if
I hate the person using my game.

59
00:03:53.693 --> 00:03:56.812
Let's go ahead, and

60
00:03:56.812 --> 00:04:01.500
we'll set the last x to -10.

61
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.778
And then what we'll have is on every,
take the same way we're slowing,

62
00:04:11.778 --> 00:04:15.990
maybe doing that up a top
wasn't my best move.

63
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.995
But whatever, every time around,

64
00:04:18.995 --> 00:04:24.816
we will do that same thing we said before,
we'll times it by 0.8.

65
00:04:24.816 --> 00:04:30.122
So we'll change.

66
00:04:30.122 --> 00:04:36.779
We'll set velocity x to, Operators,

67
00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:42.401
velocity x,
I think I grabbed multiplication

68
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:47.214
that time, we'll find out together.

69
00:04:47.214 --> 00:04:52.594
Is, 0.8.

70
00:04:58.323 --> 00:05:04.716
Do I want it before or after?

71
00:05:11.688 --> 00:05:12.430
What do we got?

72
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.053
Right now, we'll move them in there and
we'll see how this doesn't work and

73
00:05:16.053 --> 00:05:17.289
then we'll make it work.

74
00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:18.754
Cuz right now he doesn't move at all.

75
00:05:18.754 --> 00:05:26.645
So we'll then say,

76
00:05:26.645 --> 00:05:30.846
Change x, By velocity x.

77
00:05:30.846 --> 00:05:35.903
Again, I'm removing that one in a second
but right now, he doesn't move at all, so.

78
00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:40.704
Okay, so right now he goes through walls.

79
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.666
Interestingly, can't jump
while in the walls because my

80
00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:50.125
logic works cuz he's touching red.

81
00:05:50.125 --> 00:05:52.657
Which sets his as 0.

82
00:05:52.657 --> 00:05:55.735
And he can kinda move through a floor.

83
00:05:55.735 --> 00:05:59.476
Okay, so what we wanna do is,
when he goes face first into a wall, stop.

84
00:05:59.476 --> 00:06:03.333
And the reason we're gonna do x before y,
it gives you everything about if like

85
00:06:03.333 --> 00:06:06.089
Super Mario, or Sonic the Hedgehog,
or what have you.

86
00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:08.631
Jump into a wall,
they're still in the jump,

87
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:11.048
they're just not moving forward, right?

88
00:06:11.048 --> 00:06:13.234
They continue to fall in and
then they hit the ground,

89
00:06:13.234 --> 00:06:15.672
it's just one of the things
that happens before the other.

90
00:06:15.672 --> 00:06:17.516
So, we need something
very similar to this.

91
00:06:17.516 --> 00:06:19.908
Now you can do two things,
you can try to duplicate it,

92
00:06:19.908 --> 00:06:21.942
you will have to swap out
a lot of these blocks.

93
00:06:21.942 --> 00:06:25.693
I will say that in the scratch add ons,
there's an ability to right click and

94
00:06:25.693 --> 00:06:27.757
change blocks, which is super helpful.

95
00:06:27.757 --> 00:06:30.757
But I'm not going to assume that
you have that installed and

96
00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:34.608
as you watch me use power tools that
maybe you can't install on your Chrome.

97
00:06:34.608 --> 00:06:38.381
But there is a set of Chrome extensions
that makes this a little bit easier.

98
00:06:38.381 --> 00:06:43.485
Your choice, if you wanna play
the game of rebuilding some scratch or

99
00:06:43.485 --> 00:06:49.128
pun unintended, or if you wanna kind of
try to copy paste and swap stuff out.

100
00:06:49.128 --> 00:06:52.507
I'll duplicate it and live with the,

101
00:06:52.507 --> 00:06:57.794
cuz that's probably what you
probably tried to do as well.

102
00:06:57.794 --> 00:07:00.586
We wanted x to go first,
so we'll do that first.

103
00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:04.395
All right, so then we wanna set less x,
To the exposition.

104
00:07:09.182 --> 00:07:10.376
And then we wanna change x, there.

105
00:07:17.363 --> 00:07:22.650
And then we'll change x by
that new velocity x, right?

106
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.138
So, go, see if you were
allowed to go there at all.

107
00:07:28.078 --> 00:07:33.981
If not, change it to,
we'll set it to x to less x,

108
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:39.472
maybe rebuilding it from
scratch was easier.

109
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.373
We will set x to that last x.

110
00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:52.832
And we'll change the x velocity back to 0.

111
00:07:52.832 --> 00:07:58.988
All right, I think I got it, but now we
wanna do the, since we wanna check for

112
00:07:58.988 --> 00:08:04.783
the total number of y and xs,
we'll pop in this combination of the two.

113
00:08:04.783 --> 00:08:06.215
Get some stuff out of the way.

114
00:08:12.483 --> 00:08:14.940
And I can also hit cleanup blocks.

115
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.729
Okay, let's see if that did the trick.

116
00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:21.211
Have I missed something?

117
00:08:21.211 --> 00:08:24.499
He's a little fast at this point.

118
00:08:24.499 --> 00:08:27.810
So, we got something off here,
jumping works.

119
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.756
He can't still go through a wall,
all right, let's check it out.

120
00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:39.085
So we'll go through the steps, we will
try to deal with the ceiling first.

121
00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:43.848
I don't think we wanna do it,
all those in the same repeat block.

122
00:08:43.848 --> 00:08:45.560
All right, I got a,

123
00:08:50.458 --> 00:08:55.125
Little carried away in there.

124
00:08:55.125 --> 00:08:57.346
Let's see if that fixes it.

125
00:08:57.346 --> 00:09:00.589
No, he's still feisty.

126
00:09:04.398 --> 00:09:11.714
All right, let's see what we got, so,
I said expedition to last expedition.

127
00:09:11.714 --> 00:09:14.252
I use a wire in here
to really ruin my day.

128
00:09:14.252 --> 00:09:15.494
We need that division, right?

129
00:09:15.494 --> 00:09:16.920
We have a division here,
I didn't put it up here.

130
00:09:19.137 --> 00:09:20.491
So let's go ahead.

131
00:09:23.781 --> 00:09:26.259
Cuz otherwise,
we're not doing it by small steps,

132
00:09:26.259 --> 00:09:28.524
we're doing it literally
just too many times.

133
00:09:37.359 --> 00:09:40.223
Boom, it pushed through the wall.

134
00:09:42.077 --> 00:09:47.352
It does stop at the wall, it looks like
you can also still push through it.

135
00:09:53.903 --> 00:09:54.646
You know what it is?

136
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:59.493
We're also moving by x,
same problem I had before.

137
00:09:59.493 --> 00:10:03.165
At least I'm repeating, as I repeat
the process, I'm repeating my mistakes,

138
00:10:03.165 --> 00:10:03.978
that feels good.

139
00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:08.053
&gt;&gt; I know why he can't stick to walls,
he just bites the walls so hard.

140
00:10:08.053 --> 00:10:13.892
&gt;&gt; And he just chews through it
like he's got zombie powers.

141
00:10:13.892 --> 00:10:14.894
There we go.

142
00:10:17.051 --> 00:10:20.171
Oof, oof, jump!

143
00:10:20.171 --> 00:10:20.709
Look at that!

144
00:10:20.709 --> 00:10:23.418
He stops, I mean,
he's still got infinite jumping

145
00:10:23.418 --> 00:10:26.565
abilities, but-
&gt;&gt; If you hit the wall while you're in

146
00:10:26.565 --> 00:10:28.506
the air, will you stick to it?

147
00:10:28.506 --> 00:10:30.943
&gt;&gt; No, I mean, see that?

148
00:10:30.943 --> 00:10:35.039
The one place you might be able to pull
it is that little tiny ledge where I drew

149
00:10:35.039 --> 00:10:35.559
poorly.

150
00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:38.817
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Where, I guess, that it's technically,

151
00:10:38.817 --> 00:10:41.859
it's all about our rules and
where we allow him to stand and not stand.

152
00:10:41.859 --> 00:10:46.098
I would say that that's better
fixed by better level design,

153
00:10:46.098 --> 00:10:48.061
not necessarily by my code.

154
00:10:48.061 --> 00:10:50.459
But generally speaking,
if he hits a wall, right?

155
00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:53.179
You'll see,
if I can get him to hit that platform.

156
00:10:53.179 --> 00:10:56.331
See, he won't stop midair,
he'll just stop.

157
00:10:56.331 --> 00:10:59.693
That's why we checked all the x first
cuz then we set the x to 0, we don't.

158
00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:02.851
As soon as he hits a wall,
we're done checking x, right?

159
00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:04.058
And then we go back to falling.

160
00:11:04.058 --> 00:11:06.642
So he will he won't stop
falling till he's done.

161
00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:16.042
In there as well.
