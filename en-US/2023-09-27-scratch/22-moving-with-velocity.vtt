00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.329
Okay, so we have this concept
of jumping up and down.

2
00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:09.715
So first, we only went down,
then we went up and down.

3
00:00:09.715 --> 00:00:12.317
Which directions have we not traveled yet?

4
00:00:12.317 --> 00:00:13.101
&gt;&gt; Left and right.

5
00:00:13.101 --> 00:00:14.075
&gt;&gt; Left and right.

6
00:00:14.075 --> 00:00:16.539
&gt;&gt; I've traveled left and right.

7
00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.116
&gt;&gt; I've traveled the left and
rights before.

8
00:00:19.116 --> 00:00:21.864
[LAUGH] I know them well.

9
00:00:21.864 --> 00:00:26.639
And in doing that, let's look at like
a slightly different mechanic for

10
00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:27.586
that as well.

11
00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:30.619
And then again, you can combine any and
all of these as you want.

12
00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.112
You might choose to use all of them.

13
00:00:32.112 --> 00:00:37.093
There's going to be one shocker where
I started to pull them all together at

14
00:00:37.093 --> 00:00:37.892
one point.

15
00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:40.329
But, let's see what that looks like.

16
00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.949
So, go ahead I'm just gonna
make sure that's saved, and

17
00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.662
I'll publish it in a little bit,
and we'll go to a new one,

18
00:00:49.662 --> 00:00:54.871
just I'm gonna swap this out for,
I don't know something easy.

19
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.311
Okay, so, when we had our left and
right motion earlier,

20
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:06.250
we basically said,
if holding right, go right.

21
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.408
If holding left, go left, right?

22
00:01:08.408 --> 00:01:09.232
But there's no idea.

23
00:01:09.232 --> 00:01:11.372
You ever run really fast?

24
00:01:11.372 --> 00:01:13.592
You all have run before, right?

25
00:01:13.592 --> 00:01:15.930
You ever run really fast?

26
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.294
And then can you stop all of a sudden?

27
00:01:18.294 --> 00:01:19.741
No, right?

28
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:21.398
You gotta slow down, right?

29
00:01:21.398 --> 00:01:23.016
You can try to slow down real fast.

30
00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.659
If you hit the brake on a car,
you're not just gonna immediately stop.

31
00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.970
If somebody hits a brake too fast,
like how you feel it, but

32
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.558
most of the time you're running and

33
00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:37.401
then in the same way you accelerate,
you can decelerate, right?

34
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:42.252
And so we could have the same mechanic
where maybe whatever your character

35
00:01:42.252 --> 00:01:45.617
is running towards the edge and
they can slow down,

36
00:01:45.617 --> 00:01:50.718
especially like on ice levels where it
can get even a little bit more nuanced.

37
00:01:50.718 --> 00:01:53.698
But we can try that out as well.

38
00:01:53.698 --> 00:01:55.725
Inside this little ball,
cuz I'm gonna do left and right.

39
00:01:55.725 --> 00:01:56.417
I'm gonna have you up and down.

40
00:01:56.417 --> 00:01:57.858
Cuz remember our taco chaser?

41
00:01:57.858 --> 00:02:01.743
That wasn't necessarily a platform or
that was like top down, right?

42
00:02:01.743 --> 00:02:03.402
And we might wanna have
it go in every direction.

43
00:02:03.402 --> 00:02:05.968
So I'll do left and right,
you do up and down, and

44
00:02:05.968 --> 00:02:09.405
then we'll kind of take a look at
some other options there as well.

45
00:02:09.405 --> 00:02:14.942
So we'll go with this loop here.

46
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.930
Same thing we've seen before.

47
00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:25.136
I should put these in my backpack.

48
00:02:27.112 --> 00:02:31.796
Hint, hint, I'll say,
right arrow is pressed.

49
00:02:35.541 --> 00:02:40.069
We'll start by, and again, you could tweak
the mechanics to have an acceleration and

50
00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.008
a deceleration.

51
00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:45.306
Somebody earlier did a terminal velocity.

52
00:02:45.306 --> 00:02:49.251
You could start out by accelerate to
a certain speed and then decelerate.

53
00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:51.673
I'm just gonna show you deceleration and

54
00:02:51.673 --> 00:02:56.455
I'll leave you acceleration as sort of
play around with this the same basic idea.

55
00:02:56.455 --> 00:02:58.385
Maybe I'll do, it we'll see how I feel.

56
00:02:58.385 --> 00:03:03.400
And we'll say we'll start the same
thing we had before we'll start by

57
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.678
have a sprint gonna have an x speed,
we've got about velocity or y speed.

58
00:03:08.678 --> 00:03:11.395
Now we're gonna do x speed.

59
00:03:11.395 --> 00:03:20.673
So make a variable X speed.

60
00:03:20.673 --> 00:03:25.632
Cool, and when the game starts we'll set

61
00:03:25.632 --> 00:03:30.521
that to 0, great.

62
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:33.785
And when the right arrow is pressed,
we will set it to 1.

63
00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:42.095
Set to 1.

64
00:03:42.095 --> 00:03:44.859
Let me get rid of that my variable.

65
00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.530
All right, so we'll set it to 1.

66
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.046
What should we do in the left IRS press,
pop quiz?

67
00:03:52.046 --> 00:03:53.870
Negative one.

68
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.037
&gt;&gt; Negative one.

69
00:03:55.037 --> 00:03:58.730
&gt;&gt; Negative one for the win.

70
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.743
All right, we'll set it to negative one.

71
00:04:00.743 --> 00:04:03.242
Now that's not gonna do much
different than we've seen before.

72
00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:06.695
I mean, it will do something
that we don't want it to do.

73
00:04:06.695 --> 00:04:11.008
Prepare, so
we'll do change x by the speed so

74
00:04:11.008 --> 00:04:15.556
that's either 1 or
negative 1 as you can see.

75
00:04:15.556 --> 00:04:16.924
And away we go.

76
00:04:28.606 --> 00:04:31.601
So X speed, change X by X speed.

77
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:32.703
X speed is zero.

78
00:04:32.703 --> 00:04:34.901
I never put the ball back to
where it's supposed to go.

79
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:37.750
That'll do it.

80
00:04:41.457 --> 00:04:43.426
Zero.

81
00:04:45.526 --> 00:04:50.301
And so we go, this feels real sad, but

82
00:04:50.301 --> 00:04:53.296
I can't stop the ball.

83
00:04:53.296 --> 00:04:55.619
Once it's going, it's going, right?

84
00:04:55.619 --> 00:05:00.100
So let's actually set maybe these to
10 because that was like molasses.

85
00:05:05.033 --> 00:05:08.209
We back and forth kinda like Pacman.

86
00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:10.076
But what I wanna do is
I wanna hit the button.

87
00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:11.886
I want it to go, but
then I want it to slow down.

88
00:05:11.886 --> 00:05:16.597
So I go, and then, if they're not holding
it then I wanna do is like come to a stop.

89
00:05:16.597 --> 00:05:18.418
And that's not happening right now.

90
00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:24.431
So now it's time for
our good friend multiplication.

91
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:29.455
If you multiply by less than one,
you start to slow down slowly.

92
00:05:29.455 --> 00:05:34.860
So what we'll do is,
instead of at every loop,

93
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.248
we're gonna set the x-speed

94
00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:48.001
To the current x speed times, like 0.8.

95
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:49.395
So 80% is fast.

96
00:05:49.395 --> 00:05:52.547
So each each tick is gonna be 80% as fast,

97
00:05:52.547 --> 00:05:57.576
a little bit slower every time until
we get to zero and the nice part is we

98
00:05:57.576 --> 00:06:02.716
don't have to even check because
zero times 80% will give you zero.

99
00:06:02.716 --> 00:06:06.394
So we'll go ahead and we'll just pop in.

100
00:06:15.315 --> 00:06:20.034
What, negative 10, sorry.

101
00:06:20.034 --> 00:06:21.325
I used a plus.

102
00:06:21.325 --> 00:06:25.534
[LAUGH] So that's why I kept trying to
go always to the right, cuz I used plus.

103
00:06:25.534 --> 00:06:29.703
And I don't want to tell you how many
times, standing this far away from my

104
00:06:29.703 --> 00:06:32.941
screen, I can't see
the difference between those two.

105
00:06:32.941 --> 00:06:34.674
Maybe you're younger than me.

106
00:06:36.663 --> 00:06:37.970
All right, pop that in.

107
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.647
Now we should get the effect that we want.

108
00:06:42.211 --> 00:06:46.216
So I hit the button, it kinda come
you can see that I can hold it.

109
00:06:46.216 --> 00:06:47.951
It slows down a little bit.

110
00:06:51.466 --> 00:06:54.406
Now it feels a little bit more
natural in the way I would move

111
00:06:54.406 --> 00:06:55.974
a character in a game, right?

112
00:06:55.974 --> 00:06:57.135
Rather than just going one at a time.

113
00:06:57.135 --> 00:06:59.713
It kind of goes, slows down,
