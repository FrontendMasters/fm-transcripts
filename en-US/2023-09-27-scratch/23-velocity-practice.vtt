00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.018
For this character, can you take a second
and do the same basic mechanics,

2
00:00:05.018 --> 00:00:08.215
but for y speed, so
that we can move up and down.

3
00:00:08.215 --> 00:00:10.840
And it should slow down at around 80%.

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.042
And I'll take a look at it with you,
Wes, if you need help.

5
00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:13.868
&gt;&gt; What?

6
00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:15.021
&gt;&gt; You want me to take
a look at it with you?

7
00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:15.723
&gt;&gt; No.

8
00:00:15.723 --> 00:00:19.204
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'll keep that there,
see if you can get y going, and

9
00:00:19.204 --> 00:00:21.517
then you can kind of slide around in both.

10
00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:24.226
And it should feel a lot better than
even our taco chase game felt at

11
00:00:24.226 --> 00:00:25.319
the beginning of the day.

12
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:33.577
Cool, so yeah, oddly satisfying,
makes you feel good.

13
00:00:33.577 --> 00:00:37.028
Really, to do it for the y,
we do need to duplicate a bunch of this,

14
00:00:37.028 --> 00:00:39.573
cuz we can't store two
values in the same thing.

15
00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:42.145
And what we're doing with
x is not the same as y.

16
00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:48.201
So we kinda just need to do some
more of the same, in this case.

17
00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:52.364
So we've got, again, for
this sprite only, we got our y speed,

18
00:00:52.364 --> 00:00:58.618
which I've misspelled for
the second time, Go me.

19
00:00:58.618 --> 00:01:06.755
And so we'll set that y speed over
to 0 in the beginning as well,

20
00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:13.225
and, I'm gonna do some
duplication action here.

21
00:01:13.225 --> 00:01:16.877
I duplicated a little bit too much there,
but we'll get rid of some stuff.

22
00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:18.843
I'll have the y speed go -10, and

23
00:01:18.843 --> 00:01:22.278
then we just gotta make sure we
adjust everything accordingly.

24
00:01:26.715 --> 00:01:33.026
Change this one to y speed, y speed,

25
00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:35.934
and y speed, okay,
that should do the trick, we'll find out.

26
00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:41.061
No, if up arrow was pressed.

27
00:01:45.946 --> 00:01:49.240
Let's see, left and
right are the x speed, I'm changing.

28
00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:54.117
Obviously, change x by y speed
is not gonna work [LAUGH].

29
00:01:54.117 --> 00:01:55.983
I mean, the work does not what I wanted.

30
00:01:55.983 --> 00:01:59.838
&gt;&gt; You should make the ball
look like it's spinning.

31
00:01:59.838 --> 00:02:02.590
&gt;&gt; We don't want me opening the sprite
editor and playing with this.

32
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.271
I will lose seven hours of my life making
the most unhinged sprites you've ever

33
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:07.181
seen in your life.

34
00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:12.847
&gt;&gt; You can use this, but rotate it, but-
&gt;&gt; The problem is I know what I will do,

35
00:02:12.847 --> 00:02:15.803
[LAUGH] I will be a bad person [LAUGH].

36
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.941
Change y by the y speed, that's by the 10.

37
00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:25.918
[LAUGH] I probably should
stop my program from running.

38
00:02:25.918 --> 00:02:27.347
That's why we don't make
changes in production.

39
00:02:31.372 --> 00:02:34.482
And I can go diagonal as well,
it's got that nice.

40
00:02:34.482 --> 00:02:40.902
Really, I'm not gonna say that I was
in a meeting and I had this going and

41
00:02:40.902 --> 00:02:47.322
I was doing this as a fidget toy during
a meeting at any point in the last.

42
00:02:47.322 --> 00:02:51.082
This is kinda like that driving mechanism
that we had in the very beginning where we

43
00:02:51.082 --> 00:02:52.344
just had him turn, right?

44
00:02:52.344 --> 00:02:56.046
That was obviously he was always
moving and had to be the turn angle.

45
00:02:56.046 --> 00:03:00.726
Well, at this point, we could
theoretically, definitely try to avoid,

46
00:03:00.726 --> 00:03:03.859
so I could bring this
mechanic back to Taco Chase.

47
00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.539
&gt;&gt; Another thing,
you could use the pen tool to make

48
00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:12.904
a kind of trail behind it that disappears.

49
00:03:12.904 --> 00:03:14.798
&gt;&gt; We're going there, we're gonna.

50
00:03:14.798 --> 00:03:15.840
&gt;&gt; That'd be cool.

51
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.653
&gt;&gt; We'll use the pen tool a little bit,
the pen tool will be coming out.

52
00:03:19.653 --> 00:03:20.198
&gt;&gt; Yay.

53
00:03:20.198 --> 00:03:20.903
&gt;&gt; Yay!

54
00:03:20.903 --> 00:03:26.358
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Oddly satisfying, definitely

55
00:03:26.358 --> 00:03:31.575
not something I did during a meeting
at all, I sat there and fidgeted with.

56
00:03:31.575 --> 00:03:34.464
Definitely not buying time
right now as I sit here and

57
00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:36.904
also fidget with it cuz
I can't put it down.
