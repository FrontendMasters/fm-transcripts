1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.393
So, with the jumping,
we had this idea of acceleration, right?

2
00:00:03.393 --> 00:00:07.067
Kind of immediately going,
falling we had acceleration,

3
00:00:07.067 --> 00:00:11.351
jumping we had a mixture of, jumping
up until we hit that stopping point and

4
00:00:11.351 --> 00:00:13.744
then turning around and going back down.

5
00:00:13.744 --> 00:00:18.617
And now we have the idea of like, cool, we
hit, we start going at 10, it really ever

6
00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:23.108
only goes 8 if you look, because we're
already multiplying by that 0.8.

7
00:00:23.108 --> 00:00:26.097
So again, you might adjust
the numbers accordingly, but

8
00:00:26.097 --> 00:00:29.031
we've got this kind of idea
of resistance and friction.

9
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:30.630
Which is we push the ball,

10
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.285
the friction slows it down at
a constant rate at this point.

11
00:00:34.285 --> 00:00:37.769
But we get that kind of better feel
that we might be used to seeing in a lot

12
00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.728
of other games, and that feels a lot more
natural than just moving by one pixel,

13
00:00:41.728 --> 00:00:44.232
moving by ten pixels over and
over and over again.

14
00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:47.571
Yeah, those little things and
we'll add a lot to the value of it and

15
00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:51.569
they all have to do is just thinking about
what is the mechanic that you wanna do,

16
00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:53.913
and what is the feel that
you are trying to get.

17
00:00:56.265 --> 00:00:59.996
Okay, we're gonna do something here where
I'm gonna have to say this real quick,

18
00:00:59.996 --> 00:01:01.237
we'll call it Rolly Ball.

19
00:01:01.237 --> 00:01:06.656
That seems like a great name for
this, Rolly Ball.

20
00:01:06.656 --> 00:01:11.518
All right, we're gonna do something where
I'm gonna show you what we're gonna kind

21
00:01:11.518 --> 00:01:16.421
go towards, And
then we'll maybe look at how to do it.

22
00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:21.942
So don't bother with the code, in fact,
we're not even gonna look at the code.

23
00:01:23.252 --> 00:01:26.748
Well, the mechanic we kind of want to do,
so

24
00:01:26.748 --> 00:01:30.629
here's that drifting that we just did,
right?

25
00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:32.248
That we had before.

26
00:01:32.248 --> 00:01:35.394
Feels natural., feels good, right?

27
00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:38.206
This feels right.

28
00:01:38.206 --> 00:01:41.779
And then we can jump,
got that kind of jumping motion.

29
00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:47.420
But what we didn't have previously is one,
the ability to hit our head on things.

30
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:55.666
And then two, The idea of a floor
that could be somewhere else, right?

31
00:01:55.666 --> 00:02:01.176
And so we're gonna need one new trick,
and then we're gonna kind of need to pull

32
00:02:01.176 --> 00:02:07.035
together all the previous tricks if we're
gonna kind of get this mechanic working.

33
00:02:07.035 --> 00:02:08.177
I think this one still,
no, this one can't even.

34
00:02:08.177 --> 00:02:13.023
It's got a little thing with the jump
where we don't stop the jump if it's

35
00:02:13.023 --> 00:02:17.028
hit its head, so it can do that motion,
which we can adjust.

36
00:02:17.028 --> 00:02:19.684
I kind of like it.

37
00:02:19.684 --> 00:02:21.395
But, we want to start to pull
together all these things.

38
00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:25.815
We just need one or two more tricks that
I think are really useful when making

39
00:02:25.815 --> 00:02:30.608
a platform again that kind of ties a lot
of these epic pieces back into each other.

40
00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:35.186
I'm not going to keep playing this for
another ten minutes,

41
00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:37.531
that's not gonna be what I do.

42
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:42.254
All right, so with that, let's go
ahead and see how we might do that.

43
00:02:42.254 --> 00:02:43.971
Let's make a new game.

44
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:51.192
I don't wanna worry about,
if you haven't noticed about me,

45
00:02:51.192 --> 00:02:56.785
I get sad when I have a sprite that
looks like it should be running or

46
00:02:56.785 --> 00:02:58.838
jumping and it's not.

47
00:02:58.838 --> 00:03:03.678
So for my own sanity I'm gonna go make
myself something that doesn't look

48
00:03:03.678 --> 00:03:06.345
like it has to be moving in any given way.

49
00:03:06.345 --> 00:03:11.154
That's why there was a square there
before because otherwise I will

50
00:03:11.154 --> 00:03:16.228
spend the next two hours designing
a sprite that is not of any use to you.

51
00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:18.498
So, I'm gonna paint a new one.

52
00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:22.033
As you can see from
the thing I did before,

53
00:03:22.033 --> 00:03:25.174
I'm going to choose to use a square.

54
00:03:25.174 --> 00:03:28.946
You want to make something else,
you make something else.

55
00:03:28.946 --> 00:03:29.656
I'm going to make a square
because I am crazy.

56
00:03:33.064 --> 00:03:35.101
There is a square.

57
00:03:35.101 --> 00:03:36.470
Bigger, smaller, we like it?

58
00:03:40.341 --> 00:03:44.072
Nah, this feels right, feels good.

59
00:03:44.072 --> 00:03:45.160
Bigger?

60
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.868
Bigger, okay, we got, go big or go home.

61
00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:54.505
&gt;&gt; Better.
&gt;&gt; Better, okay.

62
00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:57.053
I'm just gonna make sure it's
in that middle point though.

63
00:03:57.053 --> 00:04:02.892
Yeah, otherwise, it's weird where your
sprite is like all the directions are off,

64
00:04:02.892 --> 00:04:04.280
slightly smaller.

65
00:04:06.034 --> 00:04:07.833
That feels good.

66
00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:13.422
All right,
we're gonna call this Epic hero.

67
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.229
And you know what?

68
00:04:27.897 --> 00:04:32.649
Even better, now it is an Epic Hero.

69
00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:36.246
&gt;&gt; He looks like he's got [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; He is, he had too much pizza at lunch.

70
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.620
&gt;&gt; That reminds you someone?

71
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.833
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; What are you talking about?

72
00:04:47.876 --> 00:04:50.459
This is what happens when we
lay open the sprite editor.

73
00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:52.561
Okay, we've got our hero.

74
00:04:52.561 --> 00:04:56.090
He looks heroic, ready to rock and roll.

75
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.117
&gt;&gt; His name is Bob.

76
00:04:57.117 --> 00:05:00.143
&gt;&gt; Name is Bob, okay, let's do that.

77
00:05:00.143 --> 00:05:01.699
Bob, how about this?

78
00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:08.179
Bob, the epic hero and also,
&gt;&gt; The builder.

79
00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:08.840
&gt;&gt; The builder.

80
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.397
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Today I learned that there's not

81
00:05:11.397 --> 00:05:16.151
really limits on the length of
a sprite name that I'm aware of.

82
00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:19.467
Maybe there is,
I didn't reach it in that moment.

83
00:05:19.467 --> 00:05:23.911
And then the backdrop let's go ahead,
someone give me a color.

84
00:05:23.911 --> 00:05:24.715
&gt;&gt; Red.

85
00:05:24.715 --> 00:05:26.222
&gt;&gt; Red.

86
00:05:26.222 --> 00:05:27.881
&gt;&gt; And green.

87
00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:30.140
&gt;&gt; And green.

88
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.509
&gt;&gt; All the colors.

89
00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.834
Clearly sparkles, neon beige.

90
00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:35.590
&gt;&gt; Neon beige.

91
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.628
&gt;&gt; Neon.

92
00:05:36.628 --> 00:05:37.814
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Do that.

93
00:05:37.814 --> 00:05:39.283
&gt;&gt; Those are two polar opposites.

94
00:05:41.564 --> 00:05:43.224
&gt;&gt; Let's get a cool little platform.

95
00:05:46.964 --> 00:05:54.153
Do something like that maybe,
just something for it to jump around on.

96
00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:55.842
That's a little off.

97
00:05:55.842 --> 00:05:57.722
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; And some neon beige.

98
00:05:57.722 --> 00:05:59.442
Well, so there's two things.

99
00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:03.129
If I'm doing a color detection,
I got to keep it all one color.

100
00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.100
If I change this at one point
to like sprite detection,

101
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.715
if instead of a backdrop,
I make the sprite like if touching this,

102
00:06:09.715 --> 00:06:13.288
then I can literally have all
sorts of different colors, right?

103
00:06:13.288 --> 00:06:14.720
So those are both options.

104
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.087
And it's kind of like why a lot of times
moving this to a sprite might be better

105
00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:21.350
for us, depending on what we wanna do.

106
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:27.709
Cool, so we've got this in place.

107
00:06:30.547 --> 00:06:36.155
And there's gonna be some trickiness here.

108
00:06:36.155 --> 00:06:40.834
Remember before when we did the dropping
kind of fell into the ground, right?

109
00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:43.958
What if I told you there was
a way to solve for that?

110
00:06:45.317 --> 00:06:49.601
Right, and
there's a bunch of ways to solve for this.

111
00:06:49.601 --> 00:06:53.288
So let's start with a basic
following mechanism here.

112
00:06:54.492 --> 00:07:01.460
So we'll go ahead and
we'll just start with the flag for now.

113
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.141
We'll make a, just delete this one.

114
00:07:04.141 --> 00:07:11.371
We'll make one called velocity y,
speed y velocity y.

115
00:07:13.592 --> 00:07:17.349
Again, I'm just picking names that work
for me, you can call it whatever you want.

116
00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:21.818
And we'll set that to zero in
the beginning and we'll say,

117
00:07:24.355 --> 00:07:31.139
Forever, And
we'll just do the simplest following ever.

118
00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:34.785
For a second, we'll say,
change velocity y by -1.

119
00:07:37.363 --> 00:07:43.137
No, don't pick that set one again, you've
already made a mistake with that before.

120
00:07:43.137 --> 00:07:49.815
So, change velocity by negative one,
they will change y by that velocity.

121
00:07:49.815 --> 00:07:52.417
This should look somewhat familiar, right?

122
00:07:52.417 --> 00:07:57.660
Because we're snapping everything
together that we've learned so far.

123
00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:02.111
And we'll go ahead and
we'll check touching color,

124
00:08:02.111 --> 00:08:06.553
Red.

125
00:08:06.553 --> 00:08:10.948
And if that is true,
we will set the velocity to zero.

126
00:08:12.483 --> 00:08:16.182
All right, let's try this out.

127
00:08:16.182 --> 00:08:20.240
That's a really long name.

128
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:29.304
Good bye now, okay, well that
doesn't really give us what we want.

129
00:08:32.327 --> 00:08:36.216
To do is set the velocity negative zero,
change y by velocity.

130
00:08:36.216 --> 00:08:40.866
Cuz we're doing it every
go around in here.

131
00:08:40.866 --> 00:08:44.297
So let's actually move this beneath,
that should do the trick.

132
00:08:46.312 --> 00:08:48.599
If not, I'll have to debug it.

133
00:08:51.607 --> 00:08:55.957
All right, so
there is our famous problem that we've had

134
00:08:55.957 --> 00:09:00.045
multiple times over and
over and over again, right?

135
00:09:00.045 --> 00:09:06.053
And it gets worse the higher we drop from,
right?

136
00:09:06.053 --> 00:09:11.500
Because it already moved,
I don't know what, it was like 23,

137
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.769
and so it could be anywhere from 22 over,
right?

138
00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:20.105
By the time it drops.

139
00:09:20.105 --> 00:09:22.942
It all depends on the mathematics.
And so that's not great.

140
00:09:22.942 --> 00:09:27.787
It'd be great if it always
dropped 22 because then you just

141
00:09:27.787 --> 00:09:31.872
make it look a little 3D and
move on with your life.

142
00:09:31.872 --> 00:09:34.562
The problem here is that
it is inconsistently,

143
00:09:34.562 --> 00:09:36.790
because if I drop it from here, right?

144
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:42.515
So a little bit, dropping here
it looks like almost nothing.

145
00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:45.624
Jumping from up here and
into the ground we go.

146
00:09:45.624 --> 00:09:48.817
So if we think about this,
this is where it just stopping,

147
00:09:48.817 --> 00:09:52.484
remember was in the beginning
where like somebody's gonna stop.

148
00:09:52.484 --> 00:09:54.644
You breathe for a moment,
you think about this,

149
00:09:54.644 --> 00:09:56.869
which is how would you get
him back up to the floor?

150
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.635
Yeah.

151
00:10:00.635 --> 00:10:07.773
&gt;&gt; If it would be like,
if the purple is touching red,

152
00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:15.586
then it sets the velocity to
positive one and it's not.

153
00:10:15.586 --> 00:10:18.552
&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?

154
00:10:18.552 --> 00:10:22.516
If our little character
is touching the red,

155
00:10:22.516 --> 00:10:29.560
what we'll do is we'll say,
Let's do repeat until, right?

156
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:36.967
Repeat until, We are not touching the red.

157
00:10:36.967 --> 00:10:42.967
[LAUGH] Same thing.

158
00:10:42.967 --> 00:10:47.960
Not touching the red,
I'll just move it up one.

159
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.315
Now, this will get us
most of the way there.

160
00:10:52.315 --> 00:10:55.534
You will notice a new problem
that we will have to solve for.

161
00:10:59.083 --> 00:11:01.396
&gt;&gt; That's pretty obvious.

162
00:11:01.396 --> 00:11:01.896
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

163
00:11:03.051 --> 00:11:05.529
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

164
00:11:07.845 --> 00:11:11.769
&gt;&gt; So it's kinda you can see the motion,

165
00:11:11.769 --> 00:11:16.195
I don't know how he's jumping like that.

166
00:11:17.913 --> 00:11:24.019
I think because I pick them up and I'm
not resetting this to anything, so like.

167
00:11:25.021 --> 00:11:28.787
Right, so like that's not great,
because we can kinda see it happening.

168
00:11:28.787 --> 00:11:33.806
So not our best yet, but there was also,
even if it wasn't vibrating,

169
00:11:33.806 --> 00:11:39.007
you would see that part of the problem
is that we see it happening, right?

170
00:11:39.007 --> 00:11:43.999
What we really wanna do is have a bunch of
stuff that can happen in our game without

171
00:11:43.999 --> 00:11:48.934
showing me everything, do a bunch of
stuff and show me the end result, right?

172
00:11:48.934 --> 00:11:54.013
That doesn't really happen here,
we can't do that here now.

173
00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:57.090
Hypothetically, this is
like a lot of weird code.

174
00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.171
I am gonna break it out
into its own like little

175
00:12:00.171 --> 00:12:02.798
helper-
&gt;&gt; Thing is if I put him inside a block

176
00:12:02.798 --> 00:12:04.777
then he just floats up to the top.

177
00:12:04.777 --> 00:12:05.764
&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?

178
00:12:05.764 --> 00:12:09.025
That's exactly what we saw before, right?

179
00:12:09.025 --> 00:12:12.222
Put him here and up he goes,
because that's our logic.

180
00:12:12.222 --> 00:12:15.931
That is our code is doing what we told
it to do not what we wanted it to do.

181
00:12:15.931 --> 00:12:19.854
&gt;&gt; You hang him off that block floating
then you just float up to the top.

182
00:12:19.854 --> 00:12:22.316
&gt;&gt; Yeah, he will float,
like [SOUND] up he goes.

183
00:12:22.316 --> 00:12:24.724
And I think he'll actually keep going.

184
00:12:24.724 --> 00:12:25.877
&gt;&gt; Until he's up to it.

185
00:12:25.877 --> 00:12:27.844
&gt;&gt; And then he would.

186
00:12:27.844 --> 00:12:29.616
Okay, that's not what we want.

187
00:12:29.616 --> 00:12:33.229
What we're gonna do,
let's take this out for a second,

188
00:12:33.229 --> 00:12:35.878
because I could see myself reusing this.

189
00:12:35.878 --> 00:12:39.107
Let's go make a block
called fixed landing.

190
00:12:39.107 --> 00:12:40.510
What's this over here?

191
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:47.709
Run without screen refresh, which means we
can go and move him up without seeing it.

192
00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:53.176
Let's do that and
we'll put all this code here.

193
00:12:53.176 --> 00:12:56.313
We'll actually have it
set to zero as well.

194
00:12:56.313 --> 00:12:59.891
So if touching a color, I can call fix
landing, I could go like adjust for

195
00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:00.431
landing.

196
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:03.240
I don't adjust for landing,
that sounds like a fight thing.

197
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.276
Let's see if I got it right.

198
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.737
Nope, did I hit the button?

199
00:13:12.287 --> 00:13:14.463
Run a screen refresh.

200
00:13:21.987 --> 00:13:23.343
There we go.

201
00:13:23.343 --> 00:13:23.843
Boom.

202
00:13:32.789 --> 00:13:33.661
There it goes.

203
00:13:33.661 --> 00:13:36.291
Yeah, the game is not meant for
me clicking and

204
00:13:36.291 --> 00:13:38.256
dragging my dude midway through.

205
00:13:38.256 --> 00:13:44.376
So now as he drops,
is technically dropping too far and

206
00:13:44.376 --> 00:13:47.179
moving back up, right?

207
00:13:47.179 --> 00:13:51.477
You're just blissfully unaware
that any of that happened, right?

208
00:13:51.477 --> 00:13:55.371
Because if I turn this off,
you can see it again.

209
00:13:56.501 --> 00:13:57.827
So we'll stop it.

210
00:14:01.479 --> 00:14:06.412
All right, he does that motion, but
because we're gonna do all this

211
00:14:06.412 --> 00:14:11.259
logic of moving them back up until
he's not touching the rat again,

212
00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:13.149
we don't see any of that.

213
00:14:13.149 --> 00:14:19.849
We're not doing a render,
until we're done with the logic.

214
00:14:19.849 --> 00:14:25.304
And so now, Or
if I drop him on the ground,

215
00:14:28.679 --> 00:14:32.430
We just put him in the right spot and
we don't worry about it, yeah.

216
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:36.890
&gt;&gt; Does that mean that you
can see him moving if he's in

217
00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:40.540
the ground when you're doing it, move?

218
00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.317
&gt;&gt; If he's in the ground,
I'll just move him above the ground again.

219
00:14:43.317 --> 00:14:46.192
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, but
if we add moving left or right,

220
00:14:46.192 --> 00:14:50.835
would that mean that we wouldn't see
him moving until he's above the ground?

221
00:14:50.835 --> 00:14:52.017
&gt;&gt; Let's add left and right.
