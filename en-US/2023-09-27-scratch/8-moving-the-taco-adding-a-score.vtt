00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.034
It'd be nice if something happened
when they've got the taco.

2
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:10.144
A thing about life,
sometimes you get what you want and

3
00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:12.481
then you just have to go
somewhere else get something else.

4
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:17.198
And so I'm thinking that mechanic for
this game like the game of

5
00:00:17.198 --> 00:00:21.830
snake is when Dave gets the taco,
we move to the taco, right?

6
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.171
Let's do it, so in this case,

7
00:00:24.171 --> 00:00:29.226
Dave can't move the taco because
Dave's code only affects Dave.

8
00:00:29.226 --> 00:00:32.033
There's exceptions to this, but
let's just pretend I'm right.

9
00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:35.931
So in this case,
we need to put this logic inside the taco.

10
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:41.858
And so we might say,
now I'm in the taco, don't be in Dave.

11
00:00:41.858 --> 00:00:44.904
Something for you in Dave.

12
00:00:44.904 --> 00:00:51.011
We'll say when the green flag is clicked,
we could just say go to a random position.

13
00:00:51.011 --> 00:00:53.349
There are reasons why this
might be problematic.

14
00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:56.451
We'll talk about how to fix it in
a little bit, but let's start with that.

15
00:00:56.451 --> 00:01:02.153
Go to a random position and
then forever, right?

16
00:01:02.153 --> 00:01:07.908
Just see, If we were touching

17
00:01:07.908 --> 00:01:13.198
Dave because we ever touching
Dave he is most likely eating us.

18
00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:15.764
And we'll do the simplest thing for now.

19
00:01:15.764 --> 00:01:18.312
We will just go to
a different random position.

20
00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:21.196
Dave has found us, move.

21
00:01:21.196 --> 00:01:23.254
Let's try that out and see how it goes.

22
00:01:23.254 --> 00:01:27.984
Cool, as soon as I get the taco,
the taco moves.

23
00:01:27.984 --> 00:01:34.289
And I guess I have
the beginnings of a game.

24
00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.325
Okay, I was gonna say it doesn't
feel great, but, oddly, it does.

25
00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:41.313
What are some other mechanics
that we see in games?

26
00:01:41.313 --> 00:01:44.535
What happens usually
when you catch something?

27
00:01:44.535 --> 00:01:50.322
What are some ways to like
make us feel good, yeah?

28
00:01:50.322 --> 00:01:55.117
&gt;&gt; You extend this snake.

29
00:01:55.117 --> 00:01:57.024
&gt;&gt; I guess, yeah,
it was a snake I would extend it and

30
00:01:57.024 --> 00:01:58.258
we will do that towards the end.

31
00:01:58.258 --> 00:02:02.092
So right, yeah, do your point like
something about the game changes, right?

32
00:02:02.092 --> 00:02:04.392
Maybe the difficulty increases, right?

33
00:02:04.392 --> 00:02:07.441
Maybe there's something that
makes the game compelling.

34
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:08.080
What's another option?

35
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.666
&gt;&gt; Score.

36
00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:13.162
&gt;&gt; Score, let's do score, we will actually
do all of these options, it's a fun fact,

37
00:02:13.162 --> 00:02:14.793
but let's start with a score.

38
00:02:14.793 --> 00:02:17.707
So it'd be nice to get
a little dopamine hit and

39
00:02:17.707 --> 00:02:22.655
be able to say have some kind of idea of a
score that might go up as we get the taco.

40
00:02:22.655 --> 00:02:28.111
So we can do that by going to a variable
where we keep track of the score, right?

41
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:29.885
And so
you can make any variables you want,

42
00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:31.819
they give you one for
free called my variable.

43
00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.478
You have two choices here.

44
00:02:33.478 --> 00:02:37.014
You can choose to make a new one or
you can right-click on it and

45
00:02:37.014 --> 00:02:38.175
rename it to score.

46
00:02:38.175 --> 00:02:41.869
I don't care,
you do whichever one you want.

47
00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:43.422
So I can rename this one to score.

48
00:02:43.422 --> 00:02:47.229
I'm actually gonna show you also,
I'm gonna delete this one.

49
00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:52.130
If you make one, you can see that you
can make it for all the sprites or for

50
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.027
this sprite only, right?

51
00:02:54.027 --> 00:02:57.131
So if you want a score that
only the Taco knows about,

52
00:02:57.131 --> 00:02:59.968
I don't know why you would
hit the sprite only.

53
00:02:59.968 --> 00:03:02.777
But if you want the current position of
this sprite if you're doing something with

54
00:03:02.777 --> 00:03:03.682
this particular sprite.

55
00:03:03.682 --> 00:03:07.587
Otherwise the score seems like
a global variable, right?

56
00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:10.266
So we'll call this score.

57
00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:12.228
And things that we need to do,

58
00:03:12.228 --> 00:03:15.615
I could spread this global
code all over the place.

59
00:03:15.615 --> 00:03:18.407
We're gonna let the taco
be the scorekeeper, right?

60
00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:23.092
Because it's gonna be the one that
knows when Dave has found it.

61
00:03:23.092 --> 00:03:26.421
So let's say when the game starts,
set the score to zero, right?

62
00:03:26.421 --> 00:03:28.650
We're resetting the game.

63
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.551
And then if it's touching Dave
changed the score by one and

64
00:03:32.551 --> 00:03:34.391
move to a random position.

65
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.607
Awesome, so now you can see the score
is going up, I feel great about life.

66
00:03:42.607 --> 00:03:45.166
You can see that score in
the upper right hand corner.
