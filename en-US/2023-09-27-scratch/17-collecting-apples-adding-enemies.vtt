1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.173
And so I guess this is very
similar to what we had before.

2
00:00:03.173 --> 00:00:07.173
We would say if now if the apples touching
pico, we probably also want to say that's

3
00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:09.814
the point but
it should vanish if he caught it, right?

4
00:00:09.814 --> 00:00:13.124
So we can go back to this apple.

5
00:00:13.124 --> 00:00:18.165
And what's cool about this is we already
gave ourselves a reusable code block,

6
00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:18.701
right?

7
00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:22.430
We have a concept here
about how to move it back.

8
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.261
And so we don't have to do it.

9
00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:25.272
Because imagine we did it once for
the setup.

10
00:00:25.272 --> 00:00:28.064
We did it twice when I hit the bottom.

11
00:00:28.064 --> 00:00:28.827
We did it three times.

12
00:00:28.827 --> 00:00:32.690
You can see how over time this gets out
of control, you want to change one place.

13
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.356
Now you would have had to change the three
places, but we don't have to do that.

14
00:00:36.356 --> 00:00:43.620
So what we can do is say,
If touching Pico,

15
00:00:52.874 --> 00:00:55.989
Then what we want to do is,
we want to go back to dropping the apple.

16
00:00:59.028 --> 00:01:03.642
We could, theoretically we could say,
we can make a for all Sprite score,

17
00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:11.760
So we could, change score by one,
so we can take that code, and

18
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.972
we can build on top of it,
and it will still all work.

19
00:01:14.972 --> 00:01:16.511
So we can change the score by one.

20
00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:19.596
We can drop the apple again.

21
00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:23.199
We could even, if we really
wanna get fancy with ourselves,

22
00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:29.698
we could broadcast, Apple caught.

23
00:01:32.648 --> 00:01:35.040
Right?

24
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.657
And then we could have them say yum or
something like that.

25
00:01:37.657 --> 00:01:42.589
So we can go back over to Pico and say,
&gt;&gt; Yum, 4.5 seconds.

26
00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:45.502
Yum
&gt;&gt; 4.5, we'll try it.

27
00:01:45.502 --> 00:01:47.308
I have this feeling that's
gonna be shockingly too long.

28
00:01:47.308 --> 00:01:50.723
&gt;&gt; No, just point, 0.5
&gt;&gt; 0.5, all right, I'm here for that.

29
00:01:50.723 --> 00:01:53.152
That's the correct number.

30
00:01:53.152 --> 00:01:54.094
Yum.

31
00:01:54.094 --> 00:01:57.706
Yum period.

32
00:01:57.706 --> 00:02:00.433
Yum, yum.

33
00:02:00.433 --> 00:02:02.500
&gt;&gt; Maybe we yum question mark?

34
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.365
&gt;&gt; Yum?

35
00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:04.570
&gt;&gt; Yum?

36
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.077
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yum.

37
00:02:07.077 --> 00:02:08.904
All right, so
we've got some some mechanics here.

38
00:02:08.904 --> 00:02:10.476
You know what this game needs?

39
00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:11.517
&gt;&gt; Sound?

40
00:02:11.517 --> 00:02:13.172
Nope, wrong answer.

41
00:02:13.172 --> 00:02:15.990
[LAUGH] Does not eat sound.

42
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.232
&gt;&gt; You need to make your
recording of you saying, yum.

43
00:02:20.232 --> 00:02:27.399
&gt;&gt; Yum, yeah, that is a really great
exercise when you get home at your father,

44
00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:31.940
all night, [LAUGH] and
for the next several days.

45
00:02:33.934 --> 00:02:41.319
So, what we could do is, there's sometimes
the concept of we had for EVAD, right?

46
00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.759
We wanted to make a clone, right?

47
00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:47.761
We could say that okay, maybe we want to
increase the number of enemies every time,

48
00:02:47.761 --> 00:02:50.618
we get one of these bombs but
maybe they don't or

49
00:02:50.618 --> 00:02:52.774
anytime we get one of these apples.

50
00:02:52.774 --> 00:02:55.944
But maybe we don't want them
to start off at all, right?

51
00:02:55.944 --> 00:03:01.697
And so that's a thing that we can do
as well let's make one more sprite.

52
00:03:01.697 --> 00:03:05.098
What should Pico avoid?

53
00:03:05.098 --> 00:03:06.654
&gt;&gt; Apple's hitting the ground.

54
00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:07.957
&gt;&gt; Watermelons.

55
00:03:07.957 --> 00:03:10.006
&gt;&gt; I don't know if I have watermelons.

56
00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:14.310
&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no avoid collecting.

57
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.764
&gt;&gt; Guitars.
&gt;&gt; Fine, good global.

58
00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:19.226
&gt;&gt; Globals falling from the sky?

59
00:03:19.226 --> 00:03:20.027
&gt;&gt; How about griffin.

60
00:03:20.027 --> 00:03:21.999
&gt;&gt; Hedgehogs, look at these, look at this.

61
00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:23.994
Yeah, we're doing hedgehogs.

62
00:03:23.994 --> 00:03:27.237
&gt;&gt; Make them spinning around real fast.

63
00:03:27.237 --> 00:03:28.458
&gt;&gt; I just like this view.

64
00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:31.680
Yeah, this is correct and
right and it really works for

65
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.897
a visual aesthetic with a Goldenrod
color up, Caleb, so I'm into it.

66
00:03:35.897 --> 00:03:38.845
These hedgehogs are a little bit too big.

67
00:03:38.845 --> 00:03:41.574
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Make it make it like spinning around.

68
00:03:41.574 --> 00:03:44.102
&gt;&gt; I like this idea.

69
00:03:44.102 --> 00:03:44.888
Give me one second.

70
00:03:44.888 --> 00:03:45.930
&gt;&gt; A little bit bigger.

71
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.416
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You can make it spin.

72
00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:52.937
&gt;&gt; Maybe it's 30.

73
00:03:52.937 --> 00:03:54.147
&gt;&gt; There it is.

74
00:03:54.147 --> 00:03:59.027
Okay, and so maybe we don't
want any of these originally.

75
00:03:59.027 --> 00:04:03.625
So the trick you'll see a lot of times is,
for a lot of times we've used clones but

76
00:04:03.625 --> 00:04:07.550
in this case we want the idea of I
have what we might in some programming

77
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.128
languages have as a class.

78
00:04:09.128 --> 00:04:14.001
I wanna make more of these but this one
in and of itself I'm never going to use.

79
00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:18.149
So what I might do in that case is,

80
00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:22.306
I'll say, when we start the game

81
00:04:24.402 --> 00:04:29.633
Hide my actual hedgehog, right?

82
00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:36.674
&gt;&gt; It needs to have a chance needs to be
picked random one to 10 and if it's 10.

83
00:04:36.674 --> 00:04:42.779
&gt;&gt; Random hedgehog attacks,
cloudy with a chance of hedgehogs?

84
00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:46.905
&gt;&gt; Like clone of itself 12 times.

85
00:04:46.905 --> 00:04:47.682
&gt;&gt; What we could say is,

86
00:04:54.875 --> 00:05:00.711
Let's see whenever we say
when apple cart is received,

87
00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:05.689
I'm going to create a clone of myself,
right?

88
00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:07.059
When I start as a clone,

89
00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:10.772
then we'll do very similar logic
to what we had with the apples.

90
00:05:10.772 --> 00:05:12.628
&gt;&gt; Except do it a little bit faster.

91
00:05:12.628 --> 00:05:15.955
&gt;&gt; I'm into it.

92
00:05:15.955 --> 00:05:17.903
&gt;&gt; There will be hedgehogs falling for us.

93
00:05:17.903 --> 00:05:24.296
&gt;&gt; We'll drag that to move
some of the code over.

94
00:05:24.296 --> 00:05:26.215
When I start as a clone.

95
00:05:26.215 --> 00:05:31.424
Go to one of these places,
sweet, and then, let's,

96
00:05:31.424 --> 00:05:35.854
when it starts to clone,
that should happen.

97
00:05:35.854 --> 00:05:36.481
It should fall.

98
00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:38.207
Nothing should happen if it
touches Pico yet, though.

99
00:05:38.207 --> 00:05:39.226
Let's try it out.

100
00:05:39.226 --> 00:05:40.169
Pico, you need to get an apple.

101
00:05:43.082 --> 00:05:44.151
Let's see.

102
00:05:44.151 --> 00:05:45.661
Set velocity negative one.

103
00:05:45.661 --> 00:05:49.716
We don't have a falling mechanism, right.

104
00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:51.210
Yap, not for the hedgehog.

105
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.201
&gt;&gt; Not for the hedgehog.

106
00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:53.225
So we'll copy that over too.

107
00:05:53.225 --> 00:05:54.834
&gt;&gt; Make edgehog defies gravity.

108
00:05:54.834 --> 00:05:56.549
&gt;&gt; Yeah, copy, copy.

109
00:05:56.549 --> 00:05:58.307
&gt;&gt; It's like gravity defying hedgehog.

110
00:05:58.307 --> 00:05:59.287
&gt;&gt; That's what I said.

111
00:05:59.287 --> 00:06:00.353
&gt;&gt; Grab the apple.

112
00:06:00.353 --> 00:06:01.075
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

113
00:06:01.075 --> 00:06:03.994
&gt;&gt; Grab the apple stuff and then-
&gt;&gt; We just want it forever it, right?

114
00:06:03.994 --> 00:06:07.950
For now, Hey, forever.

115
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.562
We just don't have a game loop in here.

116
00:06:10.562 --> 00:06:14.238
Ever this will fall once, right.

117
00:06:14.238 --> 00:06:18.146
I kind of like the two of you just get
every time we get an apple random hedgehog

118
00:06:18.146 --> 00:06:19.075
tries to attack.

119
00:06:19.075 --> 00:06:20.897
Alright, it's not showing up though,
so let's see.

120
00:06:20.897 --> 00:06:22.455
&gt;&gt; Just start again.

121
00:06:22.455 --> 00:06:25.486
&gt;&gt; Yep,
I have hidden secret hedgehogs, right?

122
00:06:25.486 --> 00:06:28.313
So we didn't want to begin
with that idea of a hedgehog.

123
00:06:28.313 --> 00:06:28.946
&gt;&gt; Ninja hedgehogs.

124
00:06:28.946 --> 00:06:33.802
&gt;&gt; Ninja hedgrhogs, so
we do need to show them.

125
00:06:33.802 --> 00:06:37.670
&gt;&gt; You should have when you get too high
of a score, then they become invisible, so

126
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:38.670
it's a lot harder.

127
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.971
&gt;&gt; You can't tell if you're touching them.

128
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:42.888
I like the idea of ninja hedgehogs.

129
00:06:42.888 --> 00:06:44.820
&gt;&gt; No, make them more like-
&gt;&gt; Boy.

130
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.700
&gt;&gt; Make them get lighter.

131
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.651
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; But we have a problem.

132
00:06:49.651 --> 00:06:55.848
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You don't have enough hedgehogs.

133
00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:58.611
&gt;&gt; Are you sure we'll
have enough hedgehogs?

134
00:06:58.611 --> 00:07:01.124
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

135
00:07:01.124 --> 00:07:03.323
&gt;&gt; It looks like a thundercloud
of hedgehogs [LAUGH].

136
00:07:03.323 --> 00:07:07.315
&gt;&gt; It's way too many hedgehogs.

137
00:07:07.315 --> 00:07:10.031
&gt;&gt; You should have,
if you get hit by a hedgehog, you get it.

138
00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:10.797
&gt;&gt; Let's look at this code.

139
00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:12.427
It makes total sense, right?

140
00:07:12.427 --> 00:07:16.540
Which is, we set the velocity to -1,
okay, we do that over and over again.

141
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.537
And that is, as far as I can tell,
that could possibly be the same hedgehog,

142
00:07:20.537 --> 00:07:24.786
moving at such an erratic rate that it has
the appearance of a storm of hedgehogs,

143
00:07:24.786 --> 00:07:27.240
without actually being multiple hedgehogs.

144
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.800
&gt;&gt; I don't think you added the falling.

145
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we didn't change the Y yet.

146
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.700
&gt;&gt; So it's a magical ninja hedgehog.

147
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.320
It's like a wizard ninja hedgehog.

148
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.535
&gt;&gt; It's like a wizard ninja hedgehog,

149
00:07:36.535 --> 00:07:38.590
because now We just have
one that'll just hang out.

150
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.889
Yep, see, now they just hang out.

151
00:07:42.568 --> 00:07:45.165
They do get a little out
of control every time.

152
00:07:45.165 --> 00:07:48.112
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Looks like the porcupine,

153
00:07:48.112 --> 00:07:51.585
I mean the hedgehog, for
pooping apples on you.

154
00:07:51.585 --> 00:07:53.830
[LAUGH] And then he eats them, yum.

155
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:54.980
&gt;&gt; Yum.

156
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:55.909
&gt;&gt; Yum.
&gt;&gt; Yum.

157
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.579
All right so we set the velocity negative
1 but we gotta move in by the velocity so

158
00:08:01.579 --> 00:08:02.670
we'll change that

159
00:08:10.999 --> 00:08:11.880
Will change

160
00:08:21.057 --> 00:08:22.440
We've got to move by negative one.

161
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.560
&gt;&gt; All the clones are gonna have that
message receipt or that broadcast.

162
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.260
&gt;&gt; Each one.

163
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.110
&gt;&gt; Receipt message, right?

164
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.050
That's why they're exponentially growing.

165
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
we might need to move this logic.

166
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:37.578
So I was like off roading a little bit you
get to watch me live figure stuff out and

167
00:08:37.578 --> 00:08:41.278
about I can't you know I don't
hate this mechanic [LAUGH].

168
00:08:41.278 --> 00:08:43.900
Like this game is going
to end very shortly.

169
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.623
Like I think he needs some kind of like
blasting mechanism yeah each one Each one

170
00:08:48.623 --> 00:08:52.720
receives this apple call,
which means each one triggers a new one.

171
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.260
So, I might have to move that logic.

172
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.290
Luckily, I can trigger the clone for
when the apple touches Pico.

173
00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:01.730
&gt;&gt; Hey, doc, you're at the bottom,
plotting your demise.

174
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:02.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

175
00:09:04.974 --> 00:09:07.970
So we've got a bunch of these here.

176
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.960
So, you'll notice that they didn't reset.

177
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.020
So, if I actually set the

178
00:09:18.395 --> 00:09:24.094
&gt;&gt; Whoo [INAUDIBLE]

179
00:09:24.094 --> 00:09:25.620
&gt;&gt; More.

180
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.330
&gt;&gt; More, don't make more hedgehogs.

181
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.117
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not like there is a clone
maximum at some point like this will

182
00:09:34.117 --> 00:09:35.980
like hit its natural conclusion and

183
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.350
it will not let like any more get
created is another part as well.

184
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.210
Yeah, I think we've hit the maximum
hedgehog at some point.

185
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.794
So we're gonna have various we can,
we might want to move this because this is

186
00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:51.011
not working for us
&gt;&gt; Okay, make it make it delete this clone

187
00:09:51.011 --> 00:09:54.227
when it hits the ground
&gt;&gt; That'll work right like but

188
00:09:54.227 --> 00:09:57.450
then all existing ones
will still make a new one.

189
00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.170
&gt;&gt; No.

190
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.140
&gt;&gt; Right so we'll we'll get a happy
medium between the two mechanics

191
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.240
&gt;&gt; Already been deleted.

192
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.610
&gt;&gt; No but if like they'll delete but
if there are two that will make four

193
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:08.830
&gt;&gt; 4 will make 8.

194
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.660
When they hit the bottom, they're gone.

195
00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.283
So yeah, it's about like, you almost
don't want to get too many apples until

196
00:10:13.283 --> 00:10:14.410
the hedgehogs have cleared out.

197
00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:15.180
I like it.
Let's try it out.

198
00:10:16.336 --> 00:10:19.770
So forever, and then we'll say...

199
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.690
&gt;&gt; Delete, like, when touching.

200
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.905
&gt;&gt; If and
then you get the color of the ground.

201
00:10:25.905 --> 00:10:29.697
[SOUND] Yeah, so
we can say if touching the ground.

202
00:10:29.697 --> 00:10:32.200
Let's do a little bit.

203
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.056
&gt;&gt; When you got a cold in the actual,

204
00:10:35.056 --> 00:10:39.450
you can code in stop all
touches the head hedgehog.

205
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah, or yeah
&gt;&gt; Or

206
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:48.070
you can make pico when
when you get smushed.

207
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.310
Like he gets smashed by
the hedge hog you can-

208
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.810
&gt;&gt; I can I gotta go home go to costumes-

209
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:53.899
&gt;&gt; You can go home go to

210
00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:57.530
the costumes you can make him
switch costume I haven't.

211
00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:58.710
&gt;&gt; A lattened one.

212
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:59.213
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

213
00:10:59.213 --> 00:11:00.470
there's a tonne of things we can do.

214
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:06.570
&gt;&gt; Ones that been exploded
that's what I did for everyone.

215
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:11.070
&gt;&gt; Or you can make him hurt.

216
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.470
You can make-
&gt;&gt; You can go out.

217
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:15.950
&gt;&gt; Or you can make him dead.

218
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.730
&gt;&gt; You can put needles in him.

219
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.994
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can have different costumes
that he switches to in various states of

220
00:11:22.994 --> 00:11:23.735
pain and agony.

221
00:11:23.735 --> 00:11:26.530
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that will do it.

222
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.041
Let's show that deleting the clone too,

223
00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:30.790
because there might be cases where
you might want to delete clones.

224
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.340
So we'll say if that Y
position gets less than 60.

225
00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:34.880
It will get deleted.

226
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.712
Normally I'd like to make them
behind the background but

227
00:11:37.712 --> 00:11:39.720
I like to just show it happened, right?

228
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.500
He is not accelerated false.

229
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.133
Yeah, he's going to velocity.

230
00:11:45.133 --> 00:11:49.020
He's got a velocity,
right and so he vanishes.

231
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.713
And so now but

232
00:11:49.713 --> 00:11:53.630
if there were two when I called another
apple if I can catch another apple,

233
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:57.530
each clone does get that message so
we might want to move that logic.

234
00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:02.716
We'll get rid of this and
we'll move that logic back to the apple

235
00:12:02.716 --> 00:12:08.110
where we could just basically say
create clone of something else.

236
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.633
The only thing that a sprite can do
that really affects any other sprite is

237
00:12:11.633 --> 00:12:12.160
cloning.

238
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.740
So here now we should fix that mechanic.

239
00:12:18.984 --> 00:12:22.700
So now it's two, it's three,
now we've got more of a sane number.

240
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.990
Now, as they drop, they will vanish.

241
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.355
So it all depends on what mechanic you're
going for, but sometimes it's about,

242
00:12:28.355 --> 00:12:32.150
there's unintensive consequences from
our code, depending on where we put it.

243
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.790
And like, this is why you kind of
need to like play test and debug and

244
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.480
see all those kinds of things.

245
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah, make them accelerate.

246
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:46.410
To make them have to make new packs or
just make them fall.

247
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:51.254
&gt;&gt; So we said the boss is zero, yeah,
we're not changing x, y velocity

248
00:12:56.325 --> 00:12:58.030
Initially was that let's say hedgehog.

249
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.890
&gt;&gt; You say velocity.

250
00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:01.539
&gt;&gt; Or I do it in every loop.

251
00:13:01.539 --> 00:13:05.880
&gt;&gt; You did set velocity instead
&gt;&gt; I did set instead of change.

252
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.710
I coded what I told it to and
not what I said to do.

253
00:13:10.696 --> 00:13:15.431
Change velocity by negative one.

254
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.640
Because all we're just saying, be
negative 1, be negative 1, be negative 1,

255
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.180
they're like cool,
be negative 1, it's cool.

256
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.320
Alright, so
now I should have a faster hedgehog.

257
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.320
Yeah, look at that hedgehog fall.

258
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.880
So every time we catch an ash,
there is some hedgehog that might, ooh.

259
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.320
&gt;&gt; There should be three
hedgehogs falling.

260
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:34.190
&gt;&gt; So we can do the repeat by three,
right?

261
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.930
And so we can do that,
that would have to go in the apple, right?

262
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.320
So there's lots of extensions we can do.
