00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.808
One thing you can do is if you don't wanna
see it anymore, you can see that checkbox,

2
00:00:04.808 --> 00:00:07.602
that's the worst score
in the left-hand side.

3
00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:12.302
You can uncheck that and then you
won't see it on the screen either.

4
00:00:12.302 --> 00:00:15.754
So as you can see, as I get the taco,
the score goes up, I feel great.

5
00:00:15.754 --> 00:00:19.976
I'm totally paying attention to
you all and not playing my game.

6
00:00:19.976 --> 00:00:23.025
Life is good, awesome.

7
00:00:24.835 --> 00:00:27.839
Cool, so we've got that in place.

8
00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.230
And this game has a score.

9
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.717
We talked a little bit about making
it harder, right, something, right?

10
00:00:35.717 --> 00:00:38.292
We will eventually have it be
a long snake that has a tail and

11
00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:39.460
stuff along those lines.

12
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.676
It's just a little involved, and
also math that we're not ready for

13
00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:44.344
this early in the morning, right?

14
00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:46.422
We'll have fun with math later,
don't worry.

15
00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:51.245
By the way, so we can do this, and
we'll take two different options.

16
00:00:51.245 --> 00:00:54.549
Maybe we won't do them both
simultaneously, maybe we will,

17
00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:56.333
see how we feel as the day goes on.

18
00:00:56.333 --> 00:01:01.062
One way the game here get harder or
what are some ways the game to get harder?

19
00:01:01.062 --> 00:01:03.622
&gt;&gt; We could add something
that's chasing you.

20
00:01:03.622 --> 00:01:05.346
&gt;&gt; Enemies, yeah.

21
00:01:05.346 --> 00:01:07.145
&gt;&gt; You could make the snake go faster.

22
00:01:07.145 --> 00:01:08.910
&gt;&gt; Yes, let's do both of those.

23
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.156
Let's do both.

24
00:01:10.156 --> 00:01:15.264
Let's do faster first because
it's the simpler of the two,

25
00:01:15.264 --> 00:01:22.095
and then we'll add some enemies and talk
about some of the nuances there as well.

26
00:01:22.095 --> 00:01:26.571
And so what's kinda cool
is I have a score, right?

27
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:29.337
So I know how the game is going, right?

28
00:01:29.337 --> 00:01:31.342
The score is zero.

29
00:01:31.342 --> 00:01:38.853
And so right now, Dave moves ten
steps no matter what, right?

30
00:01:38.853 --> 00:01:43.413
What could I do if I wanted the game
to get harder as he ate more tacos,

31
00:01:43.413 --> 00:01:46.457
which is not how tacos
affect me personally?

32
00:01:46.457 --> 00:01:50.895
&gt;&gt; As you collect more tacos, if you
click five tacos, you speed up a bit.

33
00:01:50.895 --> 00:01:54.245
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I can do it at five, and
we'll talk about how to do that as well.

34
00:01:54.245 --> 00:02:01.379
But even for the very beginning, I can
say, hey, move the score plus ten, right?

35
00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:03.887
We can see what actually in
a little bit with the enemies,

36
00:02:03.887 --> 00:02:05.935
we'll see how to do it every so
often, right?

37
00:02:05.935 --> 00:02:07.100
Let's start simple.

38
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.866
We can say move whatever
the score is plus ten.

39
00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:13.280
So when the score is zero,
he moves ten steps.

40
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.668
When the score is 1, he moves 11.

41
00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:17.314
You can see how this game goes, right?

42
00:02:17.314 --> 00:02:19.538
So what we can do here is
we go to operators, and

43
00:02:19.538 --> 00:02:22.003
this is where I told you we
get to have fun with math.

44
00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:25.798
Luckily, our math right now is addition,
right?

45
00:02:25.798 --> 00:02:28.233
I feel good about that.

46
00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:30.263
There might be an absolute
value in there at some point.

47
00:02:30.263 --> 00:02:33.116
Division might show up.

48
00:02:33.116 --> 00:02:34.370
We'll be okay.

49
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.452
And so what I'll do is I'll pop
this in here, and I'll say move.

50
00:02:38.452 --> 00:02:40.828
We're going to my variables.

51
00:02:40.828 --> 00:02:48.285
I will say whatever the score, get back in
there, whatever the score is, plus ten.

52
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:52.785
So now,

53
00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:00.784
Subtly, David's just getting
a little faster as time goes on.

54
00:03:00.784 --> 00:03:04.246
Okay, I like the idea of
maybe we do it every five.

55
00:03:04.246 --> 00:03:07.987
[LAUGH] This is unhinged.

56
00:03:11.036 --> 00:03:11.750
My Lord.

57
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.981
[LAUGH] And there's no way to lose this
game if touching the edges made you lose.

58
00:03:18.981 --> 00:03:23.488
Okay, well, so we can see our
code works at the very least.

59
00:03:23.488 --> 00:03:27.326
It got progressively
faster as time went on.

60
00:03:27.326 --> 00:03:28.989
It'd be great if there's some way to lose.

61
00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.578
Now, there is the ability.

62
00:03:30.578 --> 00:03:35.978
There's a sensing,
which is if we're touching the edge,

63
00:03:35.978 --> 00:03:43.006
right, then we could have it set so
that if touching edge, stop all, right?

64
00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:46.824
The problem we have that we had to fix
to do that, which I'm about to do,

65
00:03:46.824 --> 00:03:50.467
let's do it, is that the taco could
end up in a random positioning.

66
00:03:50.467 --> 00:03:59.548
If the taco ends up right here, Good
luck not dying trying to get that taco.

67
00:03:59.548 --> 00:04:00.546
Do you know what I mean?

68
00:04:00.546 --> 00:04:05.184
And so we would need to find a way to make
sure that the taco ended up somewhere that

69
00:04:05.184 --> 00:04:06.718
we could actually get it.

70
00:04:06.718 --> 00:04:10.654
So we could do that, let's do that.

71
00:04:10.654 --> 00:04:15.024
And so we say go to a random position,
and in this case,

72
00:04:15.024 --> 00:04:17.502
it's not really what we want.

73
00:04:18.652 --> 00:04:24.046
Which is we could, Pick a random number.

74
00:04:24.046 --> 00:04:30.029
Now we know that it's for 240 in each
direction, and then 180 in each direction.

75
00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:34.454
So what we could do is we could
theoretically say maybe not all the way on

76
00:04:34.454 --> 00:04:35.209
the edges.

77
00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:41.557
So instead of anywhere from negative
240 to 240 and negative 180 to 180,

78
00:04:41.557 --> 00:04:47.741
because they may be 160 and 220 so that
it will never be all the way to the edge.

79
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:50.699
And again, you would do play testing,
you would adjust this.

80
00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:56.794
So at this point, what we can do is we
can change this go to random position.

81
00:04:56.794 --> 00:04:59.392
Let's get rid of these for a moment.

82
00:04:59.392 --> 00:05:00.878
Snap those off, yeah.

83
00:05:02.813 --> 00:05:03.989
And I'll take that one out, too.

84
00:05:03.989 --> 00:05:09.017
And what we'll do is we'll say, go to,

85
00:05:11.495 --> 00:05:14.861
And we'll grab this pick random.

86
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:19.473
So x, like I said,
240 in each direction, so

87
00:05:19.473 --> 00:05:23.420
we'll say -220 to positive 220.

88
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:29.080
And then we'll pop another one in,
and we'll say somewhere between -160.

89
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.225
And if these are still too close,

90
00:05:32.225 --> 00:05:37.511
you just adjust the numbers,
right, and pop those in.

91
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:40.375
And we do need this twice,
so I'm gonna duplicate it.

92
00:05:40.375 --> 00:05:43.011
Later, we'll see how to not
have to duplicate code all

93
00:05:43.011 --> 00:05:46.813
the time because it's annoying and
I'm very lazy, but we're not there yet.

94
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.144
Okay, so I think this will work now.

95
00:05:55.766 --> 00:05:58.711
Maybe one, no,
it's not all the way to the edge.

96
00:05:58.711 --> 00:06:00.547
There's still an element of danger here.

97
00:06:00.547 --> 00:06:05.361
I could make it go more to the center,
but this feels a no point, is it?

98
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:11.266
Boy, still not an easy game,

99
00:06:11.266 --> 00:06:14.582
but [LAUGH] okay.

100
00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:18.667
So now we wanna say if Dave is
touching the edge, he dies.

101
00:06:18.667 --> 00:06:21.555
I don't know why, but that's a game.

102
00:06:21.555 --> 00:06:23.534
I would say I don't make the rules,
but we do, in fact,

103
00:06:23.534 --> 00:06:24.769
make the rules in this situation.

104
00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:30.709
So in our game loop, we will say,
if, we'll put this afterwards

105
00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:36.658
cuz it doesn't really matter where,
but feels right at the end.

106
00:06:36.658 --> 00:06:44.063
So if touching, yep, if touching edge,

107
00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:49.945
Then we will stop all,
which is under control.

108
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.069
Cool, so now if we're touching the edge,
the game ends.

109
00:06:57.069 --> 00:06:59.576
So now this game has some risks to it,
right?

110
00:06:59.576 --> 00:07:02.054
It gets harder and
there's a way that it goes poorly.

111
00:07:04.947 --> 00:07:06.229
Very quickly, yeah,

112
00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:09.744
we need to get to the point where
we can have to do it every five.

113
00:07:09.744 --> 00:07:12.456
[LAUGH] So now you see,

114
00:07:12.456 --> 00:07:18.500
it went to the stop sign
as soon as I hit the edge.
