1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.909
So we're gonna learn how to code
today using something called Scratch.

2
00:00:04.909 --> 00:00:09.303
Scratch is a project out of MIT and
it is effectively,

3
00:00:09.303 --> 00:00:14.284
it's a programming language,
but for the adults viewing,

4
00:00:14.284 --> 00:00:18.793
maybe not the same syntax
that you're used to seeing.

5
00:00:18.793 --> 00:00:24.052
And yet a whole bunch of things that,
will strike you as familiar.

6
00:00:24.052 --> 00:00:28.717
Some of them I'll call out, some of them
I won't, some you'll just suddenly know.

7
00:00:28.717 --> 00:00:31.374
It's got a lot of the kind
of same principles but

8
00:00:31.374 --> 00:00:36.159
instead of having to like remember a bunch
of squirrely syntax, you can snap together

9
00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:40.429
the pieces of your code like Lego blocks,
I think there's a fair metaphor.

10
00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:44.848
And begin to make all sorts of
fun little things like games for

11
00:00:44.848 --> 00:00:49.799
example, at one point towards
the end we'll look at making snake.

12
00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:55.333
Which is slightly trickier than it
seems but we'll be ready by the end.

13
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:58.300
Here's hoping, different kind of games.

14
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.033
You could also do stuff like making
interactive stories where it follows

15
00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:04.121
the script by kinda running through, like
do this and then move this thing there,

16
00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:05.273
and then do the other things.

17
00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:07.570
You can make an entire play if you want,
instead of a game.

18
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.000
And do interactive storytelling or
something where maybe they choose

19
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.857
an option and
different things happen along those lines.

20
00:01:13.857 --> 00:01:16.894
You can also use it to make art, right?

21
00:01:16.894 --> 00:01:20.828
And so this is just simply making various
different polygons until I run out

22
00:01:20.828 --> 00:01:21.334
of room.

23
00:01:21.334 --> 00:01:24.552
I think we get to like a 20
sided polygon in this one.

24
00:01:24.552 --> 00:01:26.615
And so there's all sorts of
different things you can do.

25
00:01:26.615 --> 00:01:30.450
A lot of what we'll look at today is
some of the different kind of making

26
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.445
game mechanics that as well
as making some art as well.

27
00:01:33.445 --> 00:01:35.963
And we'll kind of see all
the steps kind of build up.

28
00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:38.432
And the idea is that we'll have
a bunch of the fundamentals in place.

29
00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:44.031
And then towards the end, you should be
able to kind of have a bunch of ideas and

30
00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:49.391
go forth to make a bunch of cool stuff
that we'll all enjoy at a later date.

31
00:01:49.391 --> 00:01:52.806
The one thing that I will say now,
and I will probably repeat

32
00:01:52.806 --> 00:01:57.742
it about 15,000 times is like there's
good news and bad news about computers.

33
00:01:57.742 --> 00:02:01.751
At the time of this workshop,
computers do not think on their own,

34
00:02:01.751 --> 00:02:04.121
that could change at any given moment.

35
00:02:04.121 --> 00:02:06.987
But at this moment,
computers don't think on their own.

36
00:02:06.987 --> 00:02:11.752
Which means when your game or
your art project or whatever,

37
00:02:11.752 --> 00:02:18.441
it's not behaving as expected, computers
will always do what you tell them to do.

38
00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:21.382
This may not always be what
you want them to do, but

39
00:02:21.382 --> 00:02:24.828
they're always gonna do what
the code says to do, right?

40
00:02:24.828 --> 00:02:28.261
Sometimes that can be frustrating when
you don't know exactly what you told them

41
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:29.176
to do that was wrong.

42
00:02:29.176 --> 00:02:33.192
But normally they're not acting on
their own, if your games like network

43
00:02:33.192 --> 00:02:36.447
is something that you kind of
have to sit down and solve for.

44
00:02:36.447 --> 00:02:39.229
I say that because at one point,
I will forget that,

45
00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:43.226
we all forget that when we think it's
the computer that was wrong, not me.

46
00:02:43.226 --> 00:02:47.607
There's this various thing like
when you're teaching programming,

47
00:02:47.607 --> 00:02:51.769
where it's like you ask everyone
to write down the instructions for

48
00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.895
make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,
which, I'm not doing here for reasons.

49
00:02:56.895 --> 00:02:59.848
But they say,
put the peanut butter on the bread.

50
00:02:59.848 --> 00:03:02.954
You take the jar of peanut butter,
put it on the loaf of bread, right?

51
00:03:02.954 --> 00:03:06.382
There's a bunch of series of things of
how this can go entirely wrong to kind of

52
00:03:06.382 --> 00:03:09.463
teach that no, the computer will
literally do what you tell it to do.

53
00:03:09.463 --> 00:03:14.259
It's not gonna assume that you meant this
or figure out and take a context clue or

54
00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:16.130
something along those lines.

55
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.439
And that's, I think, an important thing to
remember, as we kind of jump into this and

56
00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.043
we're about to jump into this.

57
00:03:22.043 --> 00:03:24.240
But keep that in mind as we go along.

58
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.891
If something's not behaving properly,
it's time to take a pause,

59
00:03:28.891 --> 00:03:31.465
take a deep breath, look at it again.

60
00:03:31.465 --> 00:03:35.588
One of the greatest things I ever
learned when I was first starting out

61
00:03:35.588 --> 00:03:38.927
was at the time my son was like
a newborn or whatever, and

62
00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:41.579
I had this job where I had to go home,
right?

63
00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.729
And sometimes I would sit in front of the
computer and be like, this isn't working.

64
00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:48.404
Computers are terrible, they were possibly
a bad idea, and I would be frustrated,

65
00:03:48.404 --> 00:03:49.803
frustrated, frustrated, but

66
00:03:49.803 --> 00:03:52.736
I have to go home at some point at
around five now because I was a dad.

67
00:03:52.736 --> 00:03:56.695
And the act of walking home, and
getting away from the computer, and

68
00:03:56.695 --> 00:04:01.077
just thinking about the problem,
I go, and then it would solve for it.

69
00:04:01.077 --> 00:04:05.098
So sometimes there's a bunch of very human
strategies for working with computers

70
00:04:05.098 --> 00:04:08.537
like taking a break, taking a deep breath,
stopping and thinking for

71
00:04:08.537 --> 00:04:12.348
a moment because they will just run
through the thing as you said they won't.

72
00:04:12.348 --> 00:04:15.519
Sometimes you'll get a little
helpful like it'll blow up in a way.

73
00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.334
The best possible thing when something's
not doing what you want is that it does

74
00:04:18.334 --> 00:04:20.193
blow up because at least
there's an error message.

75
00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:22.875
So the worst is when it's just
subtly not doing what you want.

76
00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:25.559
In that art example you saw before,

77
00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:29.772
at one point I had a setup
where after 10 it was broken.

78
00:04:29.772 --> 00:04:34.018
What I forgot was it was hitting the top
and bouncing off, but it took me a good 10

79
00:04:34.018 --> 00:04:37.222
minutes to realize the error of
my ways and just move it down.

80
00:04:37.222 --> 00:04:40.648
Little stuff like that will be
the reason why stuff doesn't work so

81
00:04:40.648 --> 00:04:43.476
sometimes stopping and
thinking, super important.

82
00:04:43.476 --> 00:04:46.113
Everything we're gonna do today.

83
00:04:46.113 --> 00:04:49.368
You don't need to necessarily have
this open at this moment, but

84
00:04:49.368 --> 00:04:52.326
all the notes that I'm going to
kind of like, that I have for

85
00:04:52.326 --> 00:04:55.250
everything I'm saying is here
with fun little pictures.

86
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.709
I'll shows you, in a given point.

87
00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:02.754
So if you, there's something that
isn't on my screen at a given moment,

88
00:05:02.754 --> 00:05:06.949
you can see that for the most part,
I've tried to break this out into steps.

89
00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.981
So at a given section,
if there's something that you need,

90
00:05:10.981 --> 00:05:13.520
you can kind of see roughly where I am.

91
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.796
Now, granted, this is interactive and
we might get a great question and

92
00:05:17.796 --> 00:05:20.544
go off on a whim so
I might deviate a little bit.

93
00:05:20.544 --> 00:05:24.212
But generally speaking a lot
of the immediate steps and

94
00:05:24.212 --> 00:05:29.076
in a lot of cases there are built
versions of different things you can kind

95
00:05:29.076 --> 00:05:30.768
of take a look at as well.

96
00:05:30.768 --> 00:05:35.154
With that, what we're gonna do
is just kind of just look and

97
00:05:35.154 --> 00:05:39.033
get a tour of our little
Scratch editor in this case.
