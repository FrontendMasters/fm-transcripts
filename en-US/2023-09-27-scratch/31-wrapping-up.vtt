00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.264
Cool, yeah, so there's a bunch of really
cool ideas and ways to extend this.

2
00:00:03.264 --> 00:00:07.711
And the goal for today was kind of show
you a bunch of the kind of mechanics and

3
00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:08.710
common things.

4
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.374
We didn't go all the way into,
again, maybe we should have three,

5
00:00:12.374 --> 00:00:14.514
maybe you should spend, yes, right?

6
00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:18.714
Your job is to take these things and
build them out cause you've got

7
00:00:18.714 --> 00:00:23.218
a bunch of the concepts of how to do
collision detection against a wall.

8
00:00:23.218 --> 00:00:27.089
There's a bunch of ways to have movement
that makes sense to mechanics around

9
00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.733
cloning enemies or reusing objects so
the game doesn't slow to a crawl.

10
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:35.286
Broadcasting events so we can show
a screen or maybe change levels.

11
00:00:35.286 --> 00:00:38.906
All those different pieces are ways
that you can kind of dig in and

12
00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:40.056
follow more stuff.

13
00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:41.952
And the cool part is as
soon as you hit share,

14
00:00:41.952 --> 00:00:43.604
a lot of people hit share on a project.

15
00:00:43.604 --> 00:00:49.236
You can also in any project that
you see that you come across,

16
00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:54.212
if you look by going to
anything in the my stuff piece.

17
00:00:54.212 --> 00:00:56.950
If you go to the project itself,
there's like, see inside and

18
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.974
if it's not your project,
you can see remix.

19
00:00:58.974 --> 00:01:03.174
Where you can basically fork it,
as I say, and like be in change and

20
00:01:03.174 --> 00:01:05.724
tweak stuff and experiment on your own.

21
00:01:05.724 --> 00:01:08.963
So any of the projects for a lot of
the done stuff, and I'll take all the ones

22
00:01:08.963 --> 00:01:12.272
that we did today and also put them On
the site too, you can introspect them.

23
00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:16.047
Because a few times, we made choices in
the room together that are different than

24
00:01:16.047 --> 00:01:18.505
like the pre-baked ones,
which are totally fine.

25
00:01:18.505 --> 00:01:23.015
I'll take these, any of them you can see
inside, remix them, play around with them.

26
00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:26.809
And we'll put a studio there
where I have it set up.

27
00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:31.002
And we'll put all these links out later,
but, I set up a studio, for

28
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:35.199
Front End Masters where you can then
anyone can add their projects and

29
00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:38.619
share them all and
you all can kind of collaborate and see

30
00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:39.482
&gt;&gt; So I can share mine?

31
00:01:39.482 --> 00:01:40.024
&gt;&gt; Yes.

32
00:01:42.578 --> 00:01:43.285
Cool.

33
00:01:43.285 --> 00:01:44.075
&gt;&gt; Okay.

34
00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:45.749
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Join it.

35
00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:49.045
&gt;&gt; I believe as long as you have a scratch
thing, which you can talk to your dad

36
00:01:49.045 --> 00:01:52.126
about, then you should be able to like
add by the URL once you have it or

37
00:01:52.126 --> 00:01:53.373
browse your own projects.

38
00:01:53.373 --> 00:01:56.740
&gt;&gt; Okay, well, I'm gonna count.

39
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.250
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

40
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.276
&gt;&gt; Share stuff.

41
00:01:59.276 --> 00:02:00.429
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

42
00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.794
&gt;&gt; No, how I [INAUDIBLE] Cool, y'all.

43
00:02:05.794 --> 00:02:09.060
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; I'm really excited to see what

44
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.624
y'all make.

45
00:02:09.624 --> 00:02:13.659
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
