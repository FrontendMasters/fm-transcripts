00:00:01.491 --> 00:00:05.391
I just want to point out there's a whole
series on YouTube too around building

2
00:00:05.391 --> 00:00:08.811
a full platformer, which I think at
the end it becomes like a clone of

3
00:00:08.811 --> 00:00:12.307
Super Mario Brothers 3 towards the end,
or some along those lines.

4
00:00:12.307 --> 00:00:14.217
That's definitely worth
taking a look as well.

5
00:00:14.217 --> 00:00:17.556
It's ten hours of stuff.

6
00:00:17.556 --> 00:00:19.915
I want to show you about some
of the other things you can do.

7
00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:23.542
Some of these we'll just kind of
take a look at some of the code and

8
00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:25.086
all of this is available and

9
00:00:25.086 --> 00:00:29.723
will always be available both the full
working playgrounds, but then also some of

10
00:00:29.723 --> 00:00:33.848
the step by steps of some of the stuff
we also kind of talked about as well.

11
00:00:33.848 --> 00:00:38.684
Those sections are like if we go here,
check it out.

12
00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:40.549
These all live in the extensions part.

13
00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:42.802
So none of these are available normally.

14
00:00:42.802 --> 00:00:44.785
So I think it's fun to
treat them like extensions.

15
00:00:44.785 --> 00:00:49.114
There's this idea of a pen tool,
and let's actually do that.

16
00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:50.222
I'll show you an example.

17
00:00:50.222 --> 00:00:53.733
Pen tool is basically, there is a limit
to the number of sprites you can have on

18
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.689
a page of some kind of performance pieces.

19
00:00:55.689 --> 00:01:00.620
If you wanna literally just be able to
draw shapes and do graphics with vectors,

20
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.177
you can use the pen tool.

21
00:01:02.177 --> 00:01:07.540
And we've got some really kinda of
cool examples around that as well.

22
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.636
So we can take a pen and
it's basically you can

23
00:01:12.636 --> 00:01:20.162
erase stuff you can basically move
to a given point on your screen.

24
00:01:20.162 --> 00:01:23.591
So like we know the coordinate grid,
you can set the pen size and

25
00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:25.093
color you put the pen down.

26
00:01:25.093 --> 00:01:28.876
You move the pen, I'm explaining
how a pen works to you, right?

27
00:01:28.876 --> 00:01:31.472
Or a marker or anything along those lines.

28
00:01:31.472 --> 00:01:34.958
You move the pen, you pick it up.

29
00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.499
That's what picking up a pen does.

30
00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:39.335
You can move it somewhere else,
you can put it down,

31
00:01:39.335 --> 00:01:42.749
you can change the color of a pen,
but it opens up another hole,

32
00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:45.731
like before we've just
moved Sprite around, right?

33
00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:48.479
So I can take one where I,
put the pen down.

34
00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.520
I changed his color on every tick.

35
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.010
If you look at this,

36
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.382
we start when the green flag is clicked
erase all set the pen size to 10.

37
00:01:57.382 --> 00:01:59.139
Why not?
This is the setup.

38
00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.306
Set the pen color to red.

39
00:02:01.306 --> 00:02:05.590
Go to negative 40 y zero.

40
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.522
Put the pen down for 100 times move it
one step and change the pen color by one,

41
00:02:10.522 --> 00:02:11.043
right?

42
00:02:11.043 --> 00:02:15.859
And that will move across the color
spectrum and draw it onto your Canvas.

43
00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:20.968
And again you can get a little bit
crazier with the code where you

44
00:02:20.968 --> 00:02:26.561
can like set move go all the way to
the up upper left corner of the screen

45
00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:33.236
put you know put the pen down until you've
hit the one course of this y-position.

46
00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:36.737
So repeat until you hit the bottom, right,

47
00:02:36.737 --> 00:02:40.995
put the pen down repeat until
you hit the right side and

48
00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:46.778
then go ahead move it down and keep going,
so what you end up with is this.

49
00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:52.253
Right?
And that's kind of using code to make art.

50
00:02:52.253 --> 00:02:57.465
Obviously very simple art in this case,
but like that's all happening through

51
00:02:57.465 --> 00:03:02.158
programming the pen to kind of like
do the things that you want, right?

52
00:03:02.158 --> 00:03:05.637
So you could have it theoretically,
like make cool geometric shapes and

53
00:03:05.637 --> 00:03:07.244
stuff along those lines as well.

54
00:03:07.244 --> 00:03:08.042
In fact, I'll show you that.

55
00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:13.372
I think I have that ready to rock as well,
that you can see as well.

56
00:03:13.372 --> 00:03:16.174
So we go in here.

57
00:03:16.174 --> 00:03:20.600
I'll actually show you this one,
which is in the platformer,

58
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.858
we saw that we can actually have
those custom blocks take what

59
00:03:24.858 --> 00:03:29.719
in JavaScript we might call arguments and
Scratch call them inputs.

60
00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:33.706
Which is draw a polygon with how many
sides and how many lengths for each side.

61
00:03:33.706 --> 00:03:38.040
And all it does is divide 360 by the
number of sides and draw for that length.

62
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.665
Seems like a relatively
simple piece of code, right?

63
00:03:42.665 --> 00:03:48.094
I can, however, say, okay, do this seven
times or however many times, right?

64
00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:54.988
Do it for a three-sided polygon, also
known by some people as a triangle, right?

65
00:03:54.988 --> 00:03:59.112
Then go do it change the color go do it
for a four-sided one some people call that

66
00:03:59.112 --> 00:04:02.063
a square, all the way up to a pentagon so
on and so forth.

67
00:04:02.063 --> 00:04:04.310
And you draw something
that's a bunch of squares,

68
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.352
you can draw something like this as
well we saw in the very beginning.

69
00:04:07.352 --> 00:04:09.926
All right, and
that's all from like programming it.

70
00:04:09.926 --> 00:04:13.630
And again, that's simply a lot of
stuff we saw from the platformer, or

71
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.791
some of the previous games that didn't
go in up to a 20 sided polygon, right?

72
00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:22.347
You can go ahead and that's really just
you bump that number from seven to 20,

73
00:04:22.347 --> 00:04:23.718
you get the larger one.

74
00:04:23.718 --> 00:04:27.957
It will go through and
be able to like just draw those with,

75
00:04:27.957 --> 00:04:32.208
honestly, this code operate
this custom block, right?

76
00:04:32.208 --> 00:04:34.651
Just goes through draws each one over and
over.

77
00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:37.956
So not only can you make games,
you can make little art projects.

78
00:04:37.956 --> 00:04:42.095
There's a music extension in there as
well, where you can have a drum kit.

79
00:04:42.095 --> 00:04:46.311
Again, I don't believe this thing
actually supports sound while I'm around,

80
00:04:46.311 --> 00:04:49.539
but when you're along with your parents,
I'm sure it does.

81
00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:50.994
And you can do all of that kind of stuff.

82
00:04:50.994 --> 00:04:53.750
I've just gonna be blissfully
ignorant about all of that.
