1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.115
All right, so Caleb did this before,
and then Wes asked me,

2
00:00:04.115 --> 00:00:07.030
how would we do a Game Over screen, right?

3
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.563
Let's actually take some
things that we learned before,

4
00:00:09.563 --> 00:00:11.688
we learned about collision detection,
right?

5
00:00:11.688 --> 00:00:15.392
We know about broadcasting, and
we learned about showing and hiding.

6
00:00:15.392 --> 00:00:19.835
Let us pull together these
three ideas into having

7
00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:24.503
a Game Over screen that shows and
hides as we need it.

8
00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:25.314
All right, so

9
00:00:25.314 --> 00:00:29.919
let's go back over to the one that I was
making, you probably still have it open.

10
00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.380
So we need some amount of
collision detection here.

11
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.516
We should put that snake back
where it belongs when it starts.

12
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.875
And so, we'll say at the very beginning,

13
00:00:46.843 --> 00:00:54.344
We will go where we're supposed to go,
and we'll say in our loop here,

14
00:00:55.576 --> 00:01:01.996
If, Touching our good friend Nano,

15
00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:12.537
We wanna stop all, but we wanna
show that Game Over screen, right?

16
00:01:12.537 --> 00:01:16.783
So what we do is we add
an additional sprite.

17
00:01:16.783 --> 00:01:19.155
I'm gonna grab just
a text tool in this case.

18
00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:25.294
GAME OVER.

19
00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:31.179
Boy, what is the correct,
let's do Pixel, I like Pixel, GAME OVER.

20
00:01:36.154 --> 00:01:40.940
I think that that Game Over
is just a bit too subtle.

21
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:48.712
I think it needs to be, That feels better.

22
00:01:48.712 --> 00:01:50.991
Okay, maybe I got carried away.

23
00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:57.403
&gt;&gt; Make it red, too.

24
00:01:57.403 --> 00:01:58.554
&gt;&gt; Red?

25
00:01:58.554 --> 00:02:02.615
&gt;&gt; I think you should change
the style a little bit cuz it's

26
00:02:02.615 --> 00:02:07.552
not really an 8-bit game, so
I think it should be more of a, just-

27
00:02:07.552 --> 00:02:09.012
&gt;&gt; Here are your choices,

28
00:02:09.012 --> 00:02:12.005
you got Handwriting, Marker, Curly, Pixel.

29
00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:14.039
&gt;&gt; I think it should be Marker.

30
00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.861
&gt;&gt; Marker?

31
00:02:14.861 --> 00:02:16.777
&gt;&gt; And that'd fit-
&gt;&gt; Okay, I actually like, yeah, I'm here.

32
00:02:16.777 --> 00:02:19.052
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it fits the style the best.

33
00:02:19.052 --> 00:02:21.412
&gt;&gt; I'm here for it.

34
00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:27.727
All right, cool,
let's just put in the middle, 0, 0.

35
00:02:27.727 --> 00:02:30.922
And so, when the game starts,
it's not game over, so

36
00:02:30.922 --> 00:02:34.546
what should we do to the game
over sprite when the game starts?

37
00:02:34.546 --> 00:02:35.213
&gt;&gt; Hide it.

38
00:02:35.213 --> 00:02:36.594
&gt;&gt; Hide it.

39
00:02:36.594 --> 00:02:42.468
&gt;&gt; Show it when it receives
the message that it's time to show it.

40
00:02:42.468 --> 00:02:45.724
&gt;&gt; Hide it, and so how do we handle that?

41
00:02:45.724 --> 00:02:49.380
How does it receive the message?

42
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.706
&gt;&gt; Somebody broadcasts it.

43
00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:52.618
&gt;&gt; Okay, I think.

44
00:02:52.618 --> 00:02:55.202
&gt;&gt; The snake or Nano.

45
00:02:55.202 --> 00:02:57.524
&gt;&gt; Looks like the snake is
the one checking right now.

46
00:02:57.524 --> 00:03:04.865
So I agree, so
let's go over into our broadcast.

47
00:03:04.865 --> 00:03:06.820
Whenever it's touching Nano.

48
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.339
&gt;&gt; Is there a way to make it stop hiding?

49
00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:13.256
Because if there is, then you can
make it when Nano touches a snake,

50
00:03:13.256 --> 00:03:14.298
it stops hiding.

51
00:03:14.298 --> 00:03:16.100
&gt;&gt; Yep,
we can do when Nano touches the snake,

52
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.781
we happen to have the logic in
the snake when it's touching Nano,

53
00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:21.345
it's kinda same thing either way,
doesn't really matter.

54
00:03:21.345 --> 00:03:28.562
&gt;&gt; After broadcasting game over,
put a wait 0.00001 seconds.

55
00:03:28.562 --> 00:03:33.993
Because if you don't,
then they'll both happen at the same time,

56
00:03:33.993 --> 00:03:36.675
and the game over won't show up.

57
00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:40.229
I've done that with lots of different
game over, it doesn't work.

58
00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.414
&gt;&gt; So we do a bunch of thing,
we do a bunch of cleanup,

59
00:03:42.414 --> 00:03:44.036
we could choose to hide the sprites.

60
00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:45.908
Let's start by getting
the initial part in place.

61
00:03:45.908 --> 00:03:49.342
So when I receive game over,
that is gonna be when we show.

62
00:03:49.342 --> 00:03:51.447
Because yeah,
those events happen on an event loop and

63
00:03:51.447 --> 00:03:52.830
one could happen before the other.

64
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.356
The end of the game could happen
before the message gets received.

65
00:03:55.356 --> 00:03:57.424
The other thing we could do,
we can have it wait,

66
00:03:57.424 --> 00:03:59.249
we'll talk about two ways to handle this.

67
00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:01.349
Let's see the problem first so
everyone sees it, and

68
00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.131
then we'll talk about
two ways to handle it.

69
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:07.396
So when I receive the game over,
that will be when we show this one.

70
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.580
Right, now, Caleb's hypothesis is,
when broadcasting that message, for those

71
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.792
of us who like the JavaScript programming
language, will go to an event loop.

72
00:04:21.792 --> 00:04:24.958
But the stopping of the game will happen
before the broadcasting of the message.

73
00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.010
Let's verify that so
everyone can see what he's talking about.

74
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.696
That one actually does happen.

75
00:04:29.696 --> 00:04:30.899
&gt;&gt; It did?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

76
00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:32.463
&gt;&gt; All right, it worked.

77
00:04:32.463 --> 00:04:35.814
&gt;&gt; But
I'm surprised that it worked as you are.

78
00:04:35.814 --> 00:04:39.598
So let's talk about if it doesn't work,
cuz sometimes it's

79
00:04:39.598 --> 00:04:44.203
just luck [LAUGH] when dealing with
asynchrony, sometimes there's luck.

80
00:04:44.203 --> 00:04:45.412
So there's two ways to handle this.

81
00:04:45.412 --> 00:04:47.535
One would be to just wait, right?

82
00:04:47.535 --> 00:04:49.962
So wait before stopping the game.

83
00:04:49.962 --> 00:04:52.069
So broadcast a message,
give it some amount of time.

84
00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:56.531
So it would be going into the snake and
saying, broadcast game over, but

85
00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:58.959
give the game a second to figure it out.

86
00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:01.596
So we could say, wait one second,
but that feels a little rough.

87
00:05:01.596 --> 00:05:05.974
So we'll say 0.01,
something like that, well, whatever,

88
00:05:05.974 --> 00:05:08.483
0.1 is fine, just make our point.

89
00:05:08.483 --> 00:05:11.813
And so this will make sure that
the message gets the chance to go through,

90
00:05:11.813 --> 00:05:12.970
obviously same effect.

91
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.771
The other way that I might
consider doing it is,

92
00:05:15.771 --> 00:05:20.688
why is the snake stopping the game when
we're broadcasting the game over message?

93
00:05:20.688 --> 00:05:22.622
I'd rather have game over stop the game,

94
00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:24.903
cuz then I don't have to
worry about this at all.

95
00:05:24.903 --> 00:05:28.808
So I just say broadcast the message,
and let game over stop everything, and

96
00:05:28.808 --> 00:05:30.708
then I don't have to worry about it.

97
00:05:30.708 --> 00:05:33.154
&gt;&gt; Yeah, finishes it off.

98
00:05:35.552 --> 00:05:38.285
&gt;&gt; Boom, and
now we've got a Game Over screen, right?

99
00:05:38.285 --> 00:05:42.673
The other thing you could do is, and
I'll kind of leave this as an exercise for

100
00:05:42.673 --> 00:05:46.466
you, and I'll give you a little bit
of time to play around with it.

101
00:05:46.466 --> 00:05:51.850
Is you could theoretically
have the green flag

102
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:58.486
just broadcast a game start
that then hides everything.

103
00:05:58.486 --> 00:06:02.277
And then you can have a thing with,
game over, press S to continue, or

104
00:06:02.277 --> 00:06:03.641
press a key to continue.

105
00:06:03.641 --> 00:06:06.051
And then you could have the ability
to play the game over and over and

106
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:07.836
over again, and
you could break that logic out.
