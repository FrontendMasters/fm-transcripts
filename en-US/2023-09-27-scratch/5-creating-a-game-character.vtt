1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.130
We're gonna make a game.

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.969
We're gonna call it, I mean you can, for

3
00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:08.500
any of these,
I know that I can't stop you.

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.889
So you can take your own liberties for
whatever you wanna do here, but

5
00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.800
we're gonna make a game,
I am gonna make a game called Taco Chase.

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.610
Cuz I like tacos, if you prefer to chase
Cheesy Puffs, you can chase Cheesy Puffs.

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.720
If you would prefer to chase an apple,
you can chase an apple.

8
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.210
You can chase whatever you wanna chase.

9
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.970
But for me, I am gonna chase a taco.

10
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.480
So I'm gonna go ahead, and
I'm gonna make a new file.

11
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.100
And all of these are saved automatically.

12
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.323
And if you want to find them later,
you can go into my stuff and

13
00:00:43.323 --> 00:00:45.830
you will find your stuff in my stuff.

14
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.744
All right, so first of all,
in this one, what I'm gonna do is,

15
00:00:50.744 --> 00:00:55.258
I'm gonna have a little game where you can
kind of go up, down, left, and right, and

16
00:00:55.258 --> 00:00:57.487
you're just looking for a taco, right?

17
00:00:57.487 --> 00:01:02.278
And when you find that taco, it will move,
that is life summarized, right,

18
00:01:02.278 --> 00:01:03.465
it's exemplary.

19
00:01:03.465 --> 00:01:06.100
You saw I did the demo
at the beginning snake.

20
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.631
Imagine snake without a tail, right?

21
00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:13.032
And we'll add to it, we'll add some
game mechanics in a little bit.

22
00:01:13.032 --> 00:01:15.543
So the first thing I'm gonna do and

23
00:01:15.543 --> 00:01:19.265
I'm gonna give you all
a second do this as well, but

24
00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:24.566
I will just kind of show you just some
of the Sprite editing tools as well.

25
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:29.080
Cuz it's gonna be sort of a top down, this
part is not gonna do the trick for me.

26
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.181
So I can go ahead,
I'm gonna make a new costume first,

27
00:01:32.181 --> 00:01:34.840
I'm gonna get rid of the existing ones.

28
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.060
So I can go to this little Choose
a Costume, we're gonna paint.

29
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.836
You can make your own in a second,
but I'm gonna make mine and so

30
00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:46.980
I'm gonna make a circle, now pro tip.

31
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.730
You can hit the circle and
you can do this and

32
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.800
you can try to get a perfect circle and
maybe you can pull it off.

33
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.750
I don't know, maybe you're better than me.

34
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.649
You hit a Delete key or if you hold Shift,

35
00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.690
you automatically make a perfect
circle no matter what.

36
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.100
So I'm gonna make this little
perfect circle right here.

37
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.370
Looks pretty good.

38
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.040
You're gonna change things up for circle.

39
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.470
You can take this little mouse, you can
change this color to whatever you want.

40
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.800
You can even make it a gradient
if you want, that's horrifying.

41
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.490
You can change the color.

42
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.781
You can even select a color from
the somewhere in the screen,

43
00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:28.597
cool, make it a little darker.

44
00:02:32.293 --> 00:02:37.325
I think I need some personality though,
you know what I mean?

45
00:02:37.325 --> 00:02:39.530
So let's go ahead,
I'm gonna make some eyes.

46
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.720
I'm gonna make the thickness
a little less.

47
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.750
We'll make the fill of
this one a solid color.

48
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.400
Be nice if I can stop right
clicking by accident.

49
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.980
Cool, and what I'll do is, I will,
gotta hold shift, never mind.

50
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.100
Make an eye, and
then we'll change it to black.

51
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.130
Make a little smaller one, cool.

52
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.458
Change back to the mouse and
pop it in there.

53
00:03:16.235 --> 00:03:17.577
Let's make it look a little less crazy.

54
00:03:21.538 --> 00:03:23.293
There we go.

55
00:03:23.293 --> 00:03:26.500
If I wanna treat as one group, I can
group it and that I can just copy paste.

56
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.190
Selected everything.

57
00:03:31.766 --> 00:03:34.682
Now I got two eyes.

58
00:03:34.682 --> 00:03:39.840
Let's put them on our hero, awesome.

59
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.340
Does he need a mouth or
is that eyes are good enough, right?

60
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.240
Eyes are good enough?

61
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.640
Cool, so now we've got a little hero
ready to go and ready to eat some tacos.

62
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.492
Great, we can go ahead and
delete some of these old ones as well.

63
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.376
So he doesn't do anything yet.

64
00:03:58.376 --> 00:04:00.110
Does my hero have a name?

65
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.110
&gt;&gt; Dave.

66
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.610
&gt;&gt; Dave.

67
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.780
All right, we got Dave.

68
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.605
Dave's ready to eat some tacos
Now Dave needs a taco, right?

69
00:04:11.605 --> 00:04:15.530
[LAUGH] This game doesn't have a lot yet,
let's give Dave a taco.

70
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:16.870
So we'll go here, we'll choose a Sprite.

71
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.720
It's almost like I happen to know
there's a taco in here already.

72
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.580
As you can see, it has a second
costume where it is a wizard.

73
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.418
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I would resist every urge not to do

74
00:04:28.418 --> 00:04:31.130
something with that at some point.

75
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.360
All right is this taco is way too big.

76
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.220
You're like agree to disagree, but [LAUGH]
let's assume that the taco is too big.

77
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.552
Rather than adding a Sprite,

78
00:04:40.552 --> 00:04:44.449
what I'm just gonna do is I'm gonna say
the size is point let's say, let's try 30.

79
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.110
Too big?

80
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.100
Too small?

81
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.214
Just right?

82
00:04:48.214 --> 00:04:49.016
Let's try 25.

83
00:04:51.746 --> 00:04:54.765
That feels better.
It feels like relative, I mean,

84
00:04:54.765 --> 00:04:59.390
still a big taco for a hero,
but thank for us to see.

85
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.894
Pretty, pretty good.
