1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.613
What I want you to try out doing,

2
00:00:02.613 --> 00:00:06.680
is it would be nice if someone
could catch the apples.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.360
I'm gonna choose, and you can choose your
own character, you do whatever you want.

4
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.630
I'm gonna go with Pico
because he's very happy, and

5
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.890
it is the energy that I wanna embody.

6
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.530
So we're gonna have Pico and
we want Pico, if he is, for some reason,

7
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.523
he doesn't have to be
able to jump just yet.

8
00:00:26.523 --> 00:00:27.894
But if he is off the ground,

9
00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:31.780
we want him to fall to the ground might
have to sense something there, right?

10
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.636
We want him walk back and forth and

11
00:00:33.636 --> 00:00:38.560
ideally it'd be great if he could catch an
apple, but if not, don't worry about that.

12
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.562
But we want a Pico that can fall
to the ground on his own, but

13
00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:46.500
will stop falling to the ground
when he's on the ground.

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.063
Because these apples will
just keep falling, right, so

15
00:00:50.063 --> 00:00:52.376
we need some way to make that happen.

16
00:00:52.376 --> 00:00:55.473
But I'm gonna let you try that out for
a little bit and

17
00:00:55.473 --> 00:01:00.490
then we'll take a look at it together,
and we'll see how we can from there.

18
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.353
So our mission was,
we have these falling apples, right,

19
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.750
We would like somebody
to catch catches apples,

20
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.829
so we're gonna add a character,
I'm gonna go

21
00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.664
grab Pico, I like Pico, I like his energy.

22
00:01:20.664 --> 00:01:25.371
There's a different one that can do for
stories,

23
00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:28.508
we're gonna do the walking one,

24
00:01:28.508 --> 00:01:33.120
Pico is a little big,
I like a half-sized Pico.

25
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.726
So unlike the apples that fall
into oblivion and then go away,

26
00:01:37.726 --> 00:01:42.331
the new ones come, Pico,
we want it to fall to the ground, and

27
00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:45.010
we'll worry about jumping later.

28
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.194
So at this point, we're just practicing
our falling mechanic [COUGH] and

29
00:01:48.194 --> 00:01:50.880
eventually, we wanna have the right and
left so that.

30
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.682
Pico can theoretically run around and grab
these apples, the difference between Pico

31
00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:59.180
and the apple is that Pico has
got to fall to something, right?

32
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.872
Arguably the ground, because otherwise,
if it's just the apple Pico can also join

33
00:02:03.872 --> 00:02:09.110
the vortex of falling apples, but that's
not the mechanic I'm personally going for.

34
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.799
I mean you do you but so
we'll say Pico starting position,

35
00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:18.012
we'll have him kind of start in the air a
little bit, that way he does have to fall.

36
00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:21.252
And so we'll just go to that
position immediately and

37
00:02:21.252 --> 00:02:25.793
let's start with the following mechanism
and then we'll add the motion.

38
00:02:25.793 --> 00:02:29.726
So we'll add a game loop once again
as we are known to do and now,

39
00:02:29.726 --> 00:02:34.830
[COUGH] if we look at the apples,
they're falling, and then they start over.

40
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.400
Really, for Pico, what we wanna do is fall
until you hit the quote-unquote ground.

41
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.634
So we're gonna need to make ground at some
point, but let's get falling working, and

42
00:02:44.634 --> 00:02:48.370
then we'll worry about this concept
of ground, whatever that means.

43
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.271
So we'll go ahead and
Pico's gonna need, like, so for

44
00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:56.350
the apple, we said the velocity was for
that sprite only.

45
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.111
Because otherwise, Pico and the apple's
velocity, as the apple falls faster, so

46
00:03:01.111 --> 00:03:04.140
will Pico and
then Pico will also then iterate by one.

47
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.531
And so it means the two of
them will impact each other,

48
00:03:06.531 --> 00:03:08.300
which is not what we want.

49
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.986
So, as you notice, if I go to the apple,
I have velocity, if I go to Pico, I don't,

50
00:03:12.986 --> 00:03:15.000
because I did that on purpose.

51
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.077
It's for the sprite,
so I'll say, velocity,

52
00:03:19.077 --> 00:03:24.440
again, you can call it speed,
call it whatever you want.

53
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.290
So we'll start out by setting
the velocity all right

54
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.613
I did negative one before to make a point,
but what was zero?

55
00:03:30.613 --> 00:03:31.113
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] this Sprite.

56
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.960
&gt;&gt; This Sprite only.

57
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.540
&gt;&gt; Okay.

58
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.120
&gt;&gt; So we're doing it for this Sprite only
and then same mechanic as we had before.

59
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.170
We will change y velocity and

60
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.140
then we will change
velocity by negative 1.

61
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.256
One of the things was implemented
a terminal velocity, which is this concept

62
00:03:54.256 --> 00:03:58.830
of physics where things speed up and speed
up and speed up and then that's it, right?

63
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.884
They hit a maximum velocity, so
you could theoretically put just,

64
00:04:01.884 --> 00:04:04.530
it's as simple as putting
an if statement here.

65
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.486
If it's less than negative, whatever you
wanted to be ADA was the terminal velocity

66
00:04:08.486 --> 00:04:09.779
of a cat, is that correct?

67
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.163
Before, so then you can no longer
do it by one if you wanted to

68
00:04:14.163 --> 00:04:17.010
implement terminal velocity in your game.

69
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.313
We don't have a lot of pixels here, so I'm
not gonna worry about that too much for

70
00:04:21.313 --> 00:04:23.480
this mechanic in this game.

71
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.889
And so
that will do the trick where it'll fall,

72
00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.990
but clearly we would like to
have some concept of ground.

73
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.370
There's two ways to do this, I will show
you both and you can pick whichever one

74
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.910
you like more, which is we can
make ground part of the stage.

75
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.680
So I can literally just go to backdrops
here and what color should the ground be?

76
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.260
&gt;&gt; Yellow.

77
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.800
&gt;&gt; Obviously, yellow.

78
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.560
&gt;&gt; That's the color grass is.

79
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:59.410
&gt;&gt; Let's see, make it, like that shade,
like a solid goldenrod color.

80
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.737
Yeah, me too, so we'll do that,
and we want in this case,

81
00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:08.080
no outline, and we're gonna go,
and we're gonna make a.

82
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.220
Look at that, that's a nice background,
right, so we can do it with the backdrop.

83
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.865
And now what we can do with Pico is
basically say, hey, continue this until,

84
00:05:20.865 --> 00:05:25.990
or unless, yeah,
we can do repeat until, that'll work.

85
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.360
That's one option or
we can kind of just check every time.

86
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.891
So there's different tradeoffs to both
which is like the repeat until we'll have

87
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:38.050
to finish before we go back
into the forever loop.

88
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.689
Which for
this version of the game is fine, but

89
00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:41.720
we'll kind of talk about some
of the different options.

90
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.851
So we have repeat until,
and we can do sensing, and

91
00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:52.210
we'll say until touching color and
then I grab this little picker right here.

92
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.341
Until touching that color, have them drop,
so you ever see those games where first

93
00:05:57.341 --> 00:06:01.220
they kind of drop to the ground and then
they can play, that will be this mechanic.

94
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.545
I don't have right and left or
any controls just yet, but

95
00:06:03.545 --> 00:06:06.355
we'll say start the loop and
repeat it until he's touching yellow,

96
00:06:06.355 --> 00:06:08.450
which means nothing else
will happen in that loop.

97
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:14.590
We won't do the game loop again until he's
hit the ground, so let's try it out drops.

98
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.588
Now one thing that you might
suddenly notice is he drops and

99
00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:23.160
if we you can see he's a little low there.

100
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.840
&gt;&gt; I kind of like that.

101
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.210
&gt;&gt; So you could choose to
like that mechanic, right?

102
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.860
If you drop him a lot more, he drops,
this one he starts in the right place.

103
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.620
Let's start him, at 180,
and we'll start from there.

104
00:06:40.716 --> 00:06:44.259
So you can see he drops a lot more
based on how far it has he was going,

105
00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:48.628
cuz the more he's dropping, the faster he
is going, which means we overshoot and

106
00:06:48.628 --> 00:06:51.189
then we realize that
we've hit the condition.

107
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:54.034
Now there's different ways to handle this,
this is simple and easy.

108
00:06:54.034 --> 00:06:58.521
And so in this case, because, there's not
really any jumping or anything like that,

109
00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:01.010
there's no platforms, right?

110
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.157
We could choose to just
paint the background,

111
00:07:03.157 --> 00:07:05.260
like something that
would be okay with that.

112
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.304
So kind of make it look like
a road doesn't really matter

113
00:07:07.304 --> 00:07:08.890
where he lands on the road.

114
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.570
We could know that since
there's only one ground,

115
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:17.800
we know roughly where that ground is and
where we wanted to stop, right?

116
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.534
So we could say just repeat
until Pico current why and

117
00:07:20.534 --> 00:07:23.530
then he won't drop any further as well,
that'll work.

118
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.108
There's a bunch of options that work for
this game, the problem is that in

119
00:07:29.108 --> 00:07:32.990
a platformer, or something like
that we have multiple grounds.

120
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.168
We're gonna need something better,
but this will work for right now and

121
00:07:37.168 --> 00:07:38.550
we can do other things.

122
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:43.767
So we can do something like we can
repeat until, and we can update

123
00:07:43.767 --> 00:07:50.060
the velocity every time as long as it's
greater than whatever it ought to be.

124
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.454
And if it is not,
then we can just set it to that, so

125
00:07:54.454 --> 00:07:58.434
we can say something
like repeat until colo,

126
00:07:58.434 --> 00:08:03.806
touching yellow we're gonna
use like an all right?

127
00:08:03.806 --> 00:08:06.046
If the next step is gonna be too far,

128
00:08:06.046 --> 00:08:09.270
then we can just put him
where he's supposed to be.

129
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:13.838
So, we could say,

130
00:08:13.838 --> 00:08:19.838
if the current y position

131
00:08:23.843 --> 00:08:30.603
Current y position that's in motion So
we need to add stuff,

132
00:08:30.603 --> 00:08:34.941
so the current position plus where it's
about to go next is too far, we can just

133
00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:39.510
put them where it's supposed to be which
looks like about, I like it right there.

134
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:45.438
That seems right, that's 198,
so if y position plus

135
00:08:52.548 --> 00:08:57.012
The, Next velocity.

136
00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.468
So if that's negative 1,

137
00:09:00.468 --> 00:09:05.510
whatever plus another negative is
gonna be less than this, what was it?

138
00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:12.618
Negative 198,
you could do the logic the other way,

139
00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:16.861
put them where I'm supposed to go

140
00:09:21.929 --> 00:09:27.633
And we could just say,
set y, that was negative 44,

141
00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:30.890
sorry, I was looking at the x.

142
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:38.280
Negative 44, set y to negative 44,
otherwise do the thing we had previously.

143
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.184
So fall,
unless you're gonna fall too far, and

144
00:09:42.184 --> 00:09:44.785
then just end up where
you're supposed to go.

145
00:09:46.623 --> 00:09:48.100
And now he falls where
he is supposed to go.

146
00:09:51.585 --> 00:09:53.872
All right, that'll work,
it doesn't really matter for this game,

147
00:09:53.872 --> 00:09:55.010
there's different ways to do it.

148
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.070
This will work for a very simple
thing where there's only one floor,

149
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.580
like I said before,
in something like a platformer.

150
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.498
This won't work because like we've hard
coded in this negative 44 as the ground

151
00:10:04.498 --> 00:10:06.100
but there could be many grounds.

152
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:06.980
It could be platforms,

153
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.590
there could be moving floating islands,
it could be a whole bunch of stuff, right?

154
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.981
But you're not gonna really
need much more than that,

155
00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:17.420
in this case, all right,
so that will work.

156
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:22.163
We kind of choose what we wanna do
in that situation, now we talked

157
00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:27.660
a little bit before about walking,
and so we know how to do that right?

158
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.384
And that was your kind of mission,
we can say if,

159
00:10:32.991 --> 00:10:36.956
If the sensing here is.

160
00:10:40.217 --> 00:10:43.255
We there this is this key is pressed,

161
00:10:43.255 --> 00:10:47.864
if the right arrow is pressed,
point in the direction.

162
00:10:47.864 --> 00:10:50.527
And again, you could choose to have
moonwalk, you do whatever you want, again,

163
00:10:50.527 --> 00:10:51.311
it depends on the game.

164
00:10:51.311 --> 00:10:56.406
You set a point that direction,
and let us say move ten steps, and

165
00:10:56.406 --> 00:11:01.700
then we'll duplicate that, nope,
I wanna duplicate all of that.

166
00:11:04.533 --> 00:11:07.549
And we'll change it to the if,

167
00:11:07.549 --> 00:11:12.895
left arrow is pressed point
direction negative 90.

168
00:11:15.275 --> 00:11:19.708
Put that in there as well, cool, and if we
wanna make sure we have the right kind of

169
00:11:19.708 --> 00:11:24.690
left-to-right rotation style, just like we
saw before, we can put that all together.

170
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.084
We do need to do the next costume thing,

171
00:11:30.084 --> 00:11:33.720
although it looks like he floats
through reality, which is fine.

172
00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:39.905
So we're just grabbing looks for
next costume, we'll do that after we walk.

173
00:11:43.838 --> 00:11:47.820
There he is, he is running around,
so you do by testing color.

174
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.969
The other thing you could choose to do,

175
00:11:50.969 --> 00:11:56.606
I guess we should only do the next
costume if he actually moves, get off

176
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.308
Do that in both cases here,

177
00:12:04.308 --> 00:12:10.140
that way he doesn't, so
you can do it by color.

178
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.383
The other thing we could do is, you'll see
a lot of times, this is just actually do

179
00:12:13.383 --> 00:12:16.080
sprite collisions,
we saw that before with the enemies.

180
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:21.424
And so
what we might choose to do is just create

181
00:12:21.424 --> 00:12:27.472
a sprite that we call ground, backdrops,

182
00:12:27.472 --> 00:12:32.690
I'll just select all here, copy, paste.

183
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.787
So the only issue with this is that you
couldn't do the fall to a given amount

184
00:12:42.787 --> 00:12:47.381
right but the nice part if you choose
to go through the touching a different

185
00:12:47.381 --> 00:12:48.811
sprite we go through.

186
00:12:48.811 --> 00:12:50.286
Is that you can have it in front and

187
00:12:50.286 --> 00:12:52.939
so the apples look like they
kind of vanished into nothing.

188
00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.988
You can do the color of the sprite as
well, are you gonna have a touching

189
00:12:55.988 --> 00:13:00.030
Sprite, these are all different options
depending on the different mechanic.

190
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.093
I like this effect a lot,

191
00:13:01.093 --> 00:13:05.390
the color is still gonna work because the
backdrop is yellow, the sprite was yellow.

192
00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.488
I don't even need to worry
about the sprite collision but

193
00:13:07.488 --> 00:13:09.498
now I like the idea that it's
all the way in the front and

194
00:13:09.498 --> 00:13:11.650
the apples look like
they're falling behind it.

195
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:17.253
So I like the visual effect in this case
as well and can walk right and left.

196
00:13:18.891 --> 00:13:22.018
So we can't collect any of our apples yet
though, which is kind of a bummer.

197
00:13:24.042 --> 00:13:25.327
So we should fix that.
