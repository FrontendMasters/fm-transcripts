00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.830
Welcome to Angular 9 fundamentals.

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.510
I believe that this is probably my ninth
or tenth Frontend Masters workshop.

3
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.871
And I think Mark may be
cringing every time I do this.

4
00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:13.999
But I just am so impressed and

5
00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:18.640
amazed at just really
the platform that he's created.

6
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.730
And that it's such
an honor to be here today.

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.752
And not only today, but for anybody that
watches these courses in the future.

8
00:00:26.752 --> 00:00:29.938
I have made just an incredible
amount of friends.

9
00:00:29.938 --> 00:00:35.190
I've met some really, really bright
people as a result of this platform.

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.712
And connecting and the feedback that
I have gone from these courses.

11
00:00:38.712 --> 00:00:41.760
It touches my heart and
it makes it worthwhile.

12
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.710
And so I would say as well there's

13
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.460
just incredible amount of
content in Frontend Masters.

14
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.110
It's amusing to me that even though
I have content on the platform,

15
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.018
I still very much consume the additional
workshops as they come out.

16
00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:03.570
So Will Sentance is probably one of
my biggest heroes in terms of his

17
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.921
teaching style and
just his depth of knowledge.

18
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:09.750
The functional JavaScript stuff,
I love it all.

19
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.050
And so to be here and to be able to
talk about Angular is just really,

20
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.490
really exciting to me.

21
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.530
And so, let's talk about
what we're going to cover.

22
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.350
Let's set some expectations.

23
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.040
Let's talk about just kind
of some housekeeping stuff.

24
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.130
And what you can expect over
the course of this workshop.

25
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.000
So the agenda here is
going to be as follows.

26
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.451
So Hello Angular is just we're
gonna set some context here.

27
00:01:40.451 --> 00:01:42.805
We're going to talk about the Angular CLI,

28
00:01:42.805 --> 00:01:45.740
we're going to talk about kind of modules,
routers.

29
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.651
And just give us just enough of a picture
to understand kinda what's happening and

30
00:01:51.651 --> 00:01:54.630
so we don't feel completely lost.

31
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.263
And then, once we have that context set,

32
00:01:57.263 --> 00:02:00.813
then we're going to get into
component fundamentals.

33
00:02:00.813 --> 00:02:05.371
Talk about how component classes templates
work, and how they fit together or

34
00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:07.440
the purpose that they play.

35
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.082
And then we're going to talk about forms,
services, server communication.

36
00:02:13.082 --> 00:02:17.850
And then my all time favorite topic,
which is component driven architecture.

37
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.280
And from there, Angular routing,
and then unit testing fundamentals.

38
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.660
And this agenda, these modules
have been constructed in a way

39
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.790
that allows us to build something
very quickly and start to iterate it.

40
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.980
So in the first module,
we're gonna talk about the Angular CLI.

41
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.480
And we're just gonna build
an application very quickly.

42
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.620
And just to understand,
this is how you get up and running.

43
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.460
This is how you run
an Angular application.

44
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.560
These are the pieces.

45
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.360
Here's how you use the command line.

46
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.530
Once we have generated that, then we're
going to jump into a repository, a project

47
00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.110
that I've prepared for this course,
that is a fully functioning application.

48
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.410
And so we kind of had this end goal
with a bunch of kind of cool stuff.

49
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.790
But we're going to start at a starting
branch that's kind of a pared down

50
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.970
version of that.

51
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.710
And we're just going to code.

52
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.130
And so I'll talk a little bit of code,
and I'll check that branch in.

53
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.830
And I'll give everybody a challenge for
them to do some code.

54
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.240
And then we'll come back and
I'll show the solution.

55
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.170
We'll check that in and
then we'll go to the next concept.

56
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.387
So these modules were done in a very
specific way for us to get up and

57
00:03:34.387 --> 00:03:37.932
running and
start working with Angular very quickly.

58
00:03:37.932 --> 00:03:42.858
So in the first module,
we're going to talk about the Angular CLI.

59
00:03:42.858 --> 00:03:46.530
We're just gonna build something up and
we're going to see how that works.

60
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.380
But from there,

61
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.290
we're going to jump into a project
that I've prepared for this workshop.

62
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.440
That covers pretty much everything that
I want to talk about and then some.

63
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.601
And so, it's fully functional, you can
save it, it goes back to the server.

64
00:04:02.601 --> 00:04:07.220
There's a lot of kind of neat
things in here that are there for

65
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.250
reference and for us to explore.

66
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.041
And so this is going to be on GitHub,
you can pull this down.

67
00:04:16.041 --> 00:04:20.773
And from the master branch, that's gonna
be everything that we're gonna talk about.

68
00:04:20.773 --> 00:04:24.051
All the extra stuff that I just put in
there because I thought it would be

69
00:04:24.051 --> 00:04:25.100
helpful.

70
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.812
But then on the branches,
if you notice that we've created a branch

71
00:04:29.812 --> 00:04:33.541
one to start out with,
which is a pared down version.

72
00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:39.143
And then we have branches for
every one of the modules that

73
00:04:39.143 --> 00:04:44.290
we're going to cover with a branch for
the module.

74
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.330
But then at the end of that module,
we have a coding challenge and

75
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.570
we have the solution for
that challenge and that branch.

76
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.770
And so if for
some reason you need to skip a module or

77
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.570
whatever, you can just jump
into the appropriate branch for

78
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.740
that module and get caught right back up.

79
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.478
And so we have branches for

80
00:05:04.478 --> 00:05:09.382
every one of the modules with a solution
branch for the coding challenge.

81
00:05:09.382 --> 00:05:13.240
And so this is the application
that we're going to build.

82
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.060
And if I shut this down real quick,

83
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.430
I can just show you what
the starting branch looks like.

84
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.502
So I'll go git checkout

85
00:05:24.502 --> 00:05:30.720
00-start and this is going to
put us on the start branch.

86
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.341
And then I talk about this,
in the package.json you can see this.

87
00:05:34.341 --> 00:05:36.351
But we have a special command here,

88
00:05:36.351 --> 00:05:40.440
npm run server:all which is going to
spin up the front end application.

89
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.380
As well as a mock API that I've
created that we use when we get into

90
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.310
server communication.

91
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.240
So we'll just run this and
we'll let this compile.

92
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.410
And while that's generating and running
the other thing I want to point out is

93
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:02.280
that there is a PDF with a bunch
of slides that I've prepared.

94
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.829
And so just a bunch of stuff in here
that I don't necessarily use or

95
00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:09.242
I'm going to use in the workshop.

96
00:06:09.242 --> 00:06:13.940
But I still wanted to make it
available to you for reference.

97
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:19.070
And so this PDF is going to
be in the repo right here.

98
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.373
So when you pull this down,
you're gonna get this PDF.

99
00:06:21.373 --> 00:06:23.689
And as if I realized there's a typo or

100
00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:26.921
something I'll just post
a new version up to this.

101
00:06:26.921 --> 00:06:31.684
But I wanted to make this available,
even though we don't use slides a ton.

102
00:06:31.684 --> 00:06:35.671
I do think they're valuable for
kind of offline studying or for

103
00:06:35.671 --> 00:06:37.170
reference purposes.

104
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.220
And so back into the starter application,

105
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.930
this is what we're going
to be working from.

106
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.352
So it's a pared down Angular application.

107
00:06:46.352 --> 00:06:51.727
Because this is an Angular workshop and
not a typing workshop, I wanted to for

108
00:06:51.727 --> 00:06:56.606
the sake of time, I just go ahead and
generate some of the basic HTML and

109
00:06:56.606 --> 00:07:00.590
a CSS so
we could focus on Angular specifically.

110
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.043
One other thing that I want to mention,
in case this comes up,

111
00:07:05.043 --> 00:07:07.793
is Angular is written in TypeScript.

112
00:07:07.793 --> 00:07:10.504
And though I will be using TypeScript,

113
00:07:10.504 --> 00:07:14.780
I'm not going to be focusing
specifically on that.

114
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.230
And so really focusing on Angular
fundamentals for people to get up and

115
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.800
running in Angular.

116
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.150
And so
I'm not going to strongly type everything.

117
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.696
I'm not gonna use all of
the TypeScript tricks and

118
00:07:25.696 --> 00:07:29.251
kind of sugar that I like to
use in my day to day job.

119
00:07:29.251 --> 00:07:33.605
Is that I'm really being conscious
of what we're working through and

120
00:07:33.605 --> 00:07:38.380
focusing on the Angular portion, and
not so much the TypeScript version.

121
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:43.220
I love TypeScript, but I'm not going
to be as disciplined as I would be

122
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.720
is if I were doing this for
a production application.
