1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.568
And so I'm going to take this back out.

2
00:00:04.568 --> 00:00:09.628
And now let's step into

3
00:00:09.628 --> 00:00:14.182
our home component.

4
00:00:14.182 --> 00:00:18.057
So I'm gonna just close
some of this down and

5
00:00:18.057 --> 00:00:23.306
in our home component let's
look at these elements again.

6
00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:28.082
It's a class.

7
00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:30.328
It implements this interface.

8
00:00:30.328 --> 00:00:32.611
I'll talk about this in just a moment.

9
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:41.016
And it has properties and methods.

10
00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:47.105
As well as we're defining our selector,
template URL style URLs.

11
00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:54.381
So you're going to see again this
pattern over and over and over.

12
00:00:54.381 --> 00:00:58.846
And so now when you
are attaching [COUGH] in a way,

13
00:00:58.846 --> 00:01:03.210
I want small point to
make about the opponent.

14
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.860
But for the most part,
from a component class standpoint,

15
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.510
there's really not much to say
other than when you attack or

16
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.144
when you have a property or
method on your class.

17
00:01:19.144 --> 00:01:25.980
It is available to bind
to in your template.

18
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.616
And so
you'll notice here we have this course

19
00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:35.986
lessons array with just
a basic object with a title.

20
00:01:35.986 --> 00:01:41.747
And so, [COUGH] if we go into our HTML,

21
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:52.091
We have just a basic card here and
we're not doing anything yet.

22
00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:56.925
But what I can do, and I'm just gonna
start and I'm gonna show you probably

23
00:01:56.925 --> 00:02:00.788
one of my favorite debugging
tricks right out of the gates.

24
00:02:00.788 --> 00:02:06.248
So if you use a pre tag, you can then use

25
00:02:06.248 --> 00:02:12.058
these curly braces to bind to an object.

26
00:02:12.058 --> 00:02:18.940
So in this case, It is course lessons.

27
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.279
I think that's it.

28
00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:24.366
Let me double check.

29
00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:25.547
There we go.

30
00:02:25.547 --> 00:02:29.326
And then I'm gonna do a pipe and
I'm gonna do Jason.

31
00:02:29.326 --> 00:02:36.606
And so what's going to happen here, it's
going to take the course lessons array,

32
00:02:36.606 --> 00:02:44.000
and it's basically going to stringify and
it's just going to dump it into the page.

33
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.483
And so if I go back here,
refresh this, let me change my route.

34
00:02:49.483 --> 00:02:51.566
So we're actually on the home component.

35
00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:52.914
There we go.

36
00:02:52.914 --> 00:02:58.676
And so this is really, really handy
[COUGH] ,for if you are troubleshooting,

37
00:02:58.676 --> 00:03:03.197
like, I'm expecting this thing
to happen in my component or

38
00:03:03.197 --> 00:03:06.053
my template, and I'm not seeing it.

39
00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:11.693
Well typically the first thing that
I'll do is I'll just dump out an object.

40
00:03:11.693 --> 00:03:15.214
And so we kind of went straight for the,

41
00:03:15.214 --> 00:03:19.590
like let's bind to this
object in the stump out,

42
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.783
lemme elaborate on that
a little bit further.

43
00:03:23.783 --> 00:03:29.133
[COUGH] So, I'm gonna create
another property on here and

44
00:03:29.133 --> 00:03:32.594
I'm gonna call it welcome message.

45
00:03:32.594 --> 00:03:38.609
And I'm gonna just go Hello workshop,
okay?

46
00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.662
[COUGH] And now because that's a property,

47
00:03:43.662 --> 00:03:48.852
I can now bind to that and
so I'll just create

48
00:03:48.852 --> 00:03:53.780
an H3 tag and we'll go welcome message.

49
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.294
I'm gonna save this.

50
00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.249
You'll notice here it's
now rendering in the page.

51
00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:06.284
And so this is the simplest
form of binding in angular,

52
00:04:06.284 --> 00:04:10.881
which is your curly brace
binding is that there's

53
00:04:10.881 --> 00:04:15.368
something in your component
class that you wanna

54
00:04:15.368 --> 00:04:20.083
render in your template,
and it's just a string.

55
00:04:20.083 --> 00:04:25.762
So for instance,
I did have a workshop here,

56
00:04:25.762 --> 00:04:30.246
but what I could do is go back into our

57
00:04:30.246 --> 00:04:35.194
component and I could go title like so.

58
00:04:35.194 --> 00:04:40.713
And in the title here I could
just bind to it that way,

59
00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:47.879
I'll back in the code, and
you can see that it's still rendering.

60
00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:52.902
So in our component class
we have properties methods

61
00:04:52.902 --> 00:05:00.677
that are now available to us to then bind
to in our template and they're exposed.

62
00:05:00.677 --> 00:05:08.095
[COUGH] And so,
that is the simplest form of binding,

63
00:05:08.095 --> 00:05:12.150
is the curly brace binding.
