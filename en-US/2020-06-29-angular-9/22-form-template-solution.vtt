00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.709
Let's finish this template
form solution and

2
00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:09.480
add in the two controls for the,

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.860
to complete binding to a course object.

4
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.260
And so we have percent complete and
we have favorite.

5
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:27.686
So for something that's
a variable range of numbers,

6
00:00:27.686 --> 00:00:32.510
I think the appropriate control for

7
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.030
that is the, Slider.

8
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.450
So I'll just pull this up real quick.

9
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.005
And so anytime it's like, I'm this much or
I'm this much complete or

10
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:52.123
whatever it is,
that is I think the best control for that.

11
00:00:52.123 --> 00:00:55.366
For something that's Boolean, on or off,

12
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:59.030
you could have actually
chose a couple of them.

13
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.480
So you could have done a checkbox which
is good, as well as the slide toggle.

14
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.410
Now one thing I will point out
here since we're here is that

15
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.870
these components work really
well not only on desktop but

16
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.930
on mobile devices for
kind of like touch input as well.

17
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.220
So this is one of the reasons why I
really like not only material design,

18
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.030
but the angular implementation of it.

19
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.050
So with that said,
let's hop into our template and

20
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.300
let's build this out.

21
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.250
What I'm gonna do is I'm going
to just create a section.

22
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.610
So the map form field is designed for
really text fields, and so

23
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.470
for some of the material components you
won't wrap them in the mat form field.

24
00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.208
And so on this case we're just going to
wrap this in a session tag, do mat slider.

25
00:02:00.208 --> 00:02:06.040
It will be super amazing if my auto
complete would work, but no luck.

26
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.312
And let's start to add in
the attributes to make this work.

27
00:02:12.312 --> 00:02:17.900
So, Class full-width,
this is something that I added.

28
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.771
What this does is it just
forces your components or

29
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:26.901
your inputs to essentially
fill the width of the card.

30
00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:32.190
And then from here we
have min equals zero.

31
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.024
And because this is 0 to 100,

32
00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:41.868
we'll go max equals 100 and,

33
00:02:44.298 --> 00:02:49.543
The name equals percent complete

34
00:02:49.543 --> 00:02:54.412
and, Entry model.

35
00:02:54.412 --> 00:02:57.623
We're also going to bind that to,

36
00:03:01.446 --> 00:03:05.692
Selected, Course,

37
00:03:08.304 --> 00:03:11.440
Make sure I spelled that right,
percent complete.

38
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.959
And then one other thing I'm
going to do just because

39
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.596
it's a material thing or a control thing,
is we're going to add in thumb label.

40
00:03:26.596 --> 00:03:27.618
So let's go in here.

41
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.630
There we go.

42
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.930
So now if I select this,
notice that it just slid right over.

43
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.240
And when you install
Angular Material using energy add,

44
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.710
you're going to be prompted,
do you want to add in animations.

45
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.790
And the reason being is so

46
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.560
you get these nice movements when you
start to interact with these components,

47
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.270
so just that ease of use is just some
really nice right out of the box.

48
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.550
All right, so hopping back into our code.

49
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.249
What I am going to do is well,
we'll just add an h4 tag, and,

50
00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:16.134
We'll go selected course,

51
00:04:22.651 --> 00:04:24.470
Percent complete.

52
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.421
And so we're just going to display this,

53
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:34.230
give a little bit more of a cue for
the user.

54
00:04:35.365 --> 00:04:36.180
Make sure I got that right.

55
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.385
There we go.
So now as you can see, as I drag this,

56
00:04:39.385 --> 00:04:44.580
that somebody doesn't actually have
to click on this to see what this is,

57
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.022
but over queueing that in.

58
00:04:47.022 --> 00:04:53.339
Al lright, to finish this up,
let's do the check box.

59
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.989
And we will call it a wrap on this module.

60
00:04:59.989 --> 00:05:03.609
So section from here.

61
00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:14.104
We're just gonna do Matt checkbox,.and
within this we're going to NG model.

62
00:05:22.152 --> 00:05:22.920
There we go.

63
00:05:26.303 --> 00:05:31.110
And we're gonna bind to
select a course favorite.

64
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.530
Now one thing you'll notice here
is that when you use NG model,

65
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.820
you have to put name or
use the name attribute on

66
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.000
the element so that NG model
can hook into the form itself.

67
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.460
And so it's just one of these
things that happens under the hood,

68
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.060
it's just kind of the way it is.

69
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.400
But if you use NG model and it just
doesn't seem to be working, ideally

70
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.450
you would get a cue where it would kind of
prompt you like, hey, this isn't kosher.

71
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.620
Yeah, so you'll see here.

72
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.180
If NG model is used within a form tag,
the name attribute must be set.

73
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.480
And so just by default out of
muscle memory at this point,

74
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:28.530
anytime I'm using NG model I
add a name attribute to it.

75
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.934
So if we go here, now let's go back.

76
00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:39.970
And I select this, select this, cancel.

77
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.660
Good, There we go.

78
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.974
So let's make one small change, and
then I will check this code in,

79
00:06:55.693 --> 00:06:57.690
Up here.

80
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.010
Let's go with,
I'm gonna just put this in a span tag.

81
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.026
We're gonna go ngf.

82
00:07:10.542 --> 00:07:14.973
If there is a selected course,
then we're actually going to,

83
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:26.720
Show the selected course, Title.

84
00:07:30.731 --> 00:07:36.341
And then what we'll do we'll go else,

85
00:07:36.341 --> 00:07:41.960
we'll go no course, or no selection.

86
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.091
So I'm doing this off the top of my head.

87
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.150
There we go.

88
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.400
And this is why I start
making deals with God.

89
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.653
If this works,
I will never eat another carb ever again.

90
00:07:58.442 --> 00:08:03.564
Yeah, [LAUGH] don't make promises I

91
00:08:03.564 --> 00:08:09.206
cannot keep, and that is sage advice.

92
00:08:14.273 --> 00:08:16.582
All right, I'm rolling the dice.

93
00:08:21.898 --> 00:08:24.240
So kinda close.

94
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.830
Let's go and take one look at this.

95
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.180
I don't wanna get in the weeds here.

96
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.910
Else no selection.

97
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.285
Did I spell this wrong?

98
00:08:34.643 --> 00:08:36.106
I don't think I did.

99
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:44.440
Let me just look in the template real
quick, ngf else block, ng template.

100
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.852
I think I did it right.

101
00:08:54.502 --> 00:08:55.440
You know what?

102
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:03.080
My helpful live audience totally,
totally got it there.

103
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:08.600
So I always have a selected course
because, guess what, we're setting it to

104
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.630
empty down here, we're always resetting
it, but what we don't have is an ID.

105
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.119
So super big hug.

106
00:09:18.119 --> 00:09:22.182
All right, so here we are,
I feel good about this,

107
00:09:22.182 --> 00:09:28.150
I can fiddle with some styling a bit but
I think we're in a pretty good spot.

108
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.231
Cancel, we can submit,
and we now have a form.

109
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:40.441
So somebody looking at this,
this is kind of a semi functional,

110
00:09:40.441 --> 00:09:46.880
at least from the outside looking in,
a semi functional app.

111
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.980
And so generally when I'm working
with brand new Angular developers,

112
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.460
this is something that I have
them do what I call a 30 by 30

113
00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:01.200
where they do 30 apps in 30 days,
and they do this over and over.

114
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.770
And so this is kind of what they get into
kind of for the first ten applications.

115
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.910
And so if you're following along,
congratulations,

116
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.550
you're well, well on your way.

117
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:15.650
So this Apple keyboard is a mess.

118
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:20.724
All right, Hit checkout,

119
00:10:20.724 --> 00:10:26.474
dash B, and
we're gonna go template forms solution.

120
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.149
There we go.

121
00:10:43.737 --> 00:10:49.911
[LAUGH]

122
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:53.853
Wait for it.

123
00:10:57.128 --> 00:10:58.618
All right,
