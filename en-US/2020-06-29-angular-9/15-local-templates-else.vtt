00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.940
Let's go back here.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.649
And, what I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna put using ng-template,

3
00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:13.900
elseBlock, and I'll explain
what this is in just a moment.

4
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.482
And so, in here we'll go select a lesson.

5
00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:27.940
And then I believe it is elseBlock.

6
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:35.050
So let's just see this in action and
then I can explain what is happening.

7
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.890
So, now notice it's saying
current lesson does not exist.

8
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.776
So, instead I'm going to show
what's in the template here.

9
00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:47.920
And then you select it, and it shows it.

10
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.210
So, there's an interesting piece
here that I wanna call out.

11
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.930
And it's this right here,
what does this hashtag mean?

12
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.190
Well, this is essentially a way to
declare a local template variable.

13
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.780
And so by calling or creating this,

14
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.290
I can now reference this DOM
element in the rest of my template.

15
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.200
So I'm saying ngIf current lesson
show this else, render elseBlock.

16
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.096
Well what is elseBlock?

17
00:01:22.096 --> 00:01:27.570
Well, in this case because we're
using a local template variable,

18
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.090
is we're saying,
I want to create this DOM element and

19
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.323
I want to assign it this
variable elseBlock and show this.

20
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.870
One other thing, since we're here is,
you may have noticed this asterisk.

21
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.975
And the reason why this exist
is this is some sugar for

22
00:01:44.975 --> 00:01:47.694
what is happening under the hood.

23
00:01:47.694 --> 00:01:53.178
So under the hood,
Angular is actually generating

24
00:01:53.178 --> 00:01:58.661
some additional code that
you could if you wanted,

25
00:01:58.661 --> 00:02:01.731
you could do this longhand.

26
00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:08.400
But by using the asterisk,
you're simply signifying, like hey,

27
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:15.660
this directive is going to be modifying
the DOM, go ahead and do it for me.

28
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.260
Let me see if I can find that real quick.

29
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.599
And I think I actually just saw it.

30
00:02:23.284 --> 00:02:28.015
NgIf, And if they talk about it,

31
00:02:28.015 --> 00:02:31.690
great, if not,
I'm not going to worry about it too much.

32
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.220
Yeah, so the shorthand syntax is here.

33
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.737
But what really is happening is under the
hood is generating all these ng templates,

34
00:02:42.737 --> 00:02:46.170
which, I don't know why anybody
would really wanna do that by hand.

35
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.560
And now what's interesting as well is
under the hood, what's happening here?

36
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.050
It's just property binding.

37
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.900
So, again, as you just start to kinda
poke around in the docs, all the sudden,

38
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.270
things kinda started like, I see how
they're using this over here to do this.

39
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.920
And so that's where that's coming from.

40
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.495
So, we have ngIf and
if current lesson is not known,

41
00:03:13.495 --> 00:03:18.454
we're going to render
it else the elseBlock.

42
00:03:18.454 --> 00:03:24.950
Now we're just gonna dump it in, and then
the elseBlock is just select a lesson.
