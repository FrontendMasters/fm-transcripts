1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
And so, let's go ahead and
let's do just a real quick

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.130
challenge, and
we'll make this pretty easy.

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.462
What I wanna do for this,

4
00:00:14.462 --> 00:00:20.501
is I'd like you to
generate a new component.

5
00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:25.222
And then just create a route,
and then add it to the sidebar.

6
00:00:25.222 --> 00:00:30.062
So, not super complicated but again,
this will encompass most of what

7
00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:33.783
you do in your day to day work
using the angular router.

8
00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:39.313
So, the challenge is going to be,
Step One.

9
00:00:41.852 --> 00:00:48.362
Generate a new, or
let's say a user's component.

10
00:00:52.944 --> 00:00:55.188
Step Two,

11
00:01:02.903 --> 00:01:04.453
Create a new users route.

12
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.569
Then Step Three is, Update side nav,

13
00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:19.766
to route, to new users route, all right?
