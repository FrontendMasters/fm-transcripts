00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.611
Now what we can do is go and

2
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:09.760
set in our template.

3
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.470
I'll put this,
I'm going to create just another card.

4
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.052
Let me see if I do.

5
00:00:23.465 --> 00:00:27.525
I was hoping I could get
this to auto sense for me.

6
00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:29.686
Maybe not, well.

7
00:00:29.686 --> 00:00:32.370
Or maybe it's this one.

8
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.970
Yeah, man, I love it.

9
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.177
All right, so this is,
I'm just gonna do debug and.

10
00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.680
I'm gonna delete some of this.

11
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.010
Really, all I care about
is the card content.

12
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.870
And does everybody remember how we test,

13
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.650
or how we kind of trace
out something in the DOM?

14
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.900
Well, we'll use string interpolation.

15
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.110
We'll go current lesson.

16
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.323
And we'll just go pipe json.

17
00:01:12.323 --> 00:01:13.988
I'm going to save this.

18
00:01:13.988 --> 00:01:15.578
I'm going to go back.

19
00:01:15.578 --> 00:01:19.229
And we'll go here.

20
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.170
And hold on real quick.

21
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.050
I feel like I did something wrong.

22
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.522
Let me check my output,
compiled successfully,

23
00:01:30.522 --> 00:01:35.390
let me go back into my template.

24
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.750
I'm going to put this
terminal in this window.

25
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.100
Home component.

26
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.920
There we go.

27
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.730
I just needed to refresh.

28
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.120
So, it's null.

29
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.140
But then when I select this,
you can see down here, I can bump this up.

30
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.081
That as I select this,
it's capturing that event,

31
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:11.583
from the click event, and
it's saving it back into your,

32
00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:15.965
it's passing it into
your component class and

33
00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:19.697
we're saving it here current lesson.

34
00:02:19.697 --> 00:02:24.760
Which then we're using to
just dump here and to debug.

35
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.390
And so you start to do a lot
of different things with that.

36
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.870
But what I wanted to illustrate is we're

37
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.089
looping over and we're setting our list.

38
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.670
And then we're allowed.

39
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.170
We're attaching this event
handler to select the list item.

40
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.630
And then we're just servicing
what we've done over here in,

41
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.501
we're just dumping current
lesson into the state.

42
00:02:53.501 --> 00:02:55.160
So, we'll go here.

43
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.770
You can see,
we're just dumping this back out.

44
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.909
So now, what I want to do is
I want to talk about just

45
00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.909
a couple more pieces real quick.

46
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.672
So the one thing that we have here,
let me just refresh this page.

47
00:03:13.672 --> 00:03:20.490
And you'll notice it says null,
because we haven't selected anything yet.

48
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.237
And so what we can do is
we can actually say I would

49
00:03:27.237 --> 00:03:34.207
prefer to actually not show null,
if something does not exist.

50
00:03:34.207 --> 00:03:39.700
And in the DOM, like,
let's actually just not show anything.

51
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.583
And so what we can do here is
if we go back into our code.

52
00:03:44.583 --> 00:03:49.437
And I'm going to go,

53
00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:53.220
let's do this.

54
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.414
I'm gonna put this in a span tag.

55
00:03:55.414 --> 00:04:02.250
And this is just only, so
I have something to pin it to.

56
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.810
And I'm going to go ngif.

57
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.566
And I'm gonna essentially say.

58
00:04:15.018 --> 00:04:16.209
If current lesson.

59
00:04:18.834 --> 00:04:21.140
Show this, if not, do not show it.

60
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.870
So it's not going to add it to the DOM.

61
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.810
And so now you'll see, it's not here.

62
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:27.310
It's gone.

63
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.439
And so now that I select it,
then it shows how this works.

64
00:04:36.595 --> 00:04:40.070
And what you can also do, and
I'll show you one other piece real quick.

65
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:48.290
And I have this kind of on
speed dial is the API docs.

66
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.710
And so if you go to angular.io4/api,

67
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.720
this is kind of the equivalent
of like dial a friend.

68
00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.260
And you can just go and like,
how does this actually work?

69
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.550
You can go ngif, for instance.

70
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:12.494
And very quickly see like,
well, what's going on here?

71
00:05:12.494 --> 00:05:13.270
Like great.

72
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.240
Now what's interesting is
they also have not only ngif,

73
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.560
but they also have else.

74
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.200
And so
this is kind of what I wanted to pull out.

75
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.900
So you have then, you have else, but
else is really what we care about.

76
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:40.480
So kind of what I just wanted to pull
out here is that angular.io/API.

77
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.610
And I keep this on speed dial,
because it's like,

78
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.200
I don't remember how this one piece went.

79
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.628
And so it's really easy to just
jump in and very quickly, like,

80
00:05:51.628 --> 00:05:54.424
how does ngfor, what does ngswitch do?

81
00:05:54.424 --> 00:05:55.106
And so as well,

82
00:05:55.106 --> 00:05:58.160
somebody will use something maybe
you just don't know what that is.

83
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.818
And so this is a really good place.

84
00:06:00.818 --> 00:06:05.354
If you're trying to figure out
what a piece of angular does, and

85
00:06:05.354 --> 00:06:08.330
you're not clear, angular.io/API.

86
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.920
And that's, I think,
a really good place to go and jump.

87
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.720
So it's pretty helpful.
