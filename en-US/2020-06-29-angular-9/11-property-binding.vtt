1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.980
We have property bindings, event bindings.

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.720
And both of these are unidirectional,
meaning they go one way.

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.574
And so this is a pretty handy way to
think about this, is from our class,

4
00:00:14.574 --> 00:00:20.135
if we just want to put a value and
render it as a string, we can use it,

5
00:00:20.135 --> 00:00:25.725
just the the curly brace binding or
string interpolation binding.

6
00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:28.727
But if you want to pass,

7
00:00:28.727 --> 00:00:33.983
let's say an object into your template,

8
00:00:33.983 --> 00:00:38.051
then you use property binding.

9
00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:42.359
But what happens if something happens
in your template that you wanna surface

10
00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:43.627
back into your class?

11
00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:47.282
Well, that is event binding.

12
00:00:47.282 --> 00:00:53.830
Now, Property binding is
from class to template.

13
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.620
You're passing in essentially
data into your template.

14
00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.641
Event binding is from your
template to your class,

15
00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:06.439
and what happens if you
need actually be two way?

16
00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.530
Well, what happens when
you take two one-way

17
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.820
streets going the opposite direction and
put them side by side?

18
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.493
Well, now you have a two
way street basically.

19
00:01:19.493 --> 00:01:25.272
And so on the bottom here,
this is where you have

20
00:01:25.272 --> 00:01:30.930
kind of this two way
data binding via ngModel.

21
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.500
And so let's kind of expand
out on what these look like.

22
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.115
So I am just gonna move the slide
back over to the other monitor.

23
00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:44.558
And we'll, we can kind of
expand on this a little bit.

24
00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.288
All right, from here,

25
00:01:56.716 --> 00:02:01.503
Let's think of something
that we could pass in.

26
00:02:01.503 --> 00:02:05.129
This is gonna be a little bit contrived,
but

27
00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:08.660
it's gonna kind of get us started on this.

28
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.970
So I'm going to create a span tag, and

29
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:22.680
within this,
I'm going to bind to essentially color.

30
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.530
So I wanna set a color property on here.

31
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.980
So style.color =, and

32
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.590
which is called the themeColor.

33
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.790
This doesn't exist yet.

34
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.573
And we'll go, some colored text!

35
00:02:43.573 --> 00:02:49.091
Now what we need to do
is we need to copy this

36
00:02:49.091 --> 00:02:54.611
property into this and let's just go with

37
00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:59.869
blue, All right, let me save this.

38
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.700
And we'll go back into our browser.

39
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.868
And notice here we have some color text,

40
00:03:08.868 --> 00:03:12.825
and it's blue or shattering.

41
00:03:16.503 --> 00:03:20.170
So obviously,
we can change this to red or whatever.

42
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.832
Now, let's red, and, So

43
00:03:26.832 --> 00:03:32.800
what we're doing is we're saying
I want to bind this property

44
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.240
on this class to this attribute,
or this element in the template.

45
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.600
Now this in of itself
is not too impressive.

46
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.088
So let's go in and
we'll hop over to Angular Material.

47
00:03:53.278 --> 00:03:57.703
And I'm just going to grab a input.

48
00:03:57.703 --> 00:04:00.757
So here,

49
00:04:05.324 --> 00:04:08.264
We're just gonna copy this and
we'll go back here.

50
00:04:18.108 --> 00:04:19.650
We don't care about placeholder.

51
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.690
But what I want to do

52
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.030
is I want the ability to bind to

53
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.510
the themeColor and
I want to be able to update it.

54
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.283
So themeColor, I'm gonna save this.

55
00:04:45.232 --> 00:04:49.337
Theme color save this,

56
00:04:49.337 --> 00:04:52.985
then we go right back here and

57
00:04:52.985 --> 00:04:58.927
we check my bottom here,
did I throw an error?

58
00:04:58.927 --> 00:05:00.884
No, well, okay.

59
00:05:03.913 --> 00:05:09.201
Let's go back in here, And put ngModel.

60
00:05:09.201 --> 00:05:12.090
&gt;&gt; Perhaps the form module is necessary,
I don't know if that's-

61
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.560
&gt;&gt; Yes, yep, yep, yep,

62
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.060
yep, yep, there we go.

63
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.530
And so the form module was missing.

64
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.299
So you'll see here I'm actually
throwing these errors.

65
00:05:22.299 --> 00:05:22.880
This is why.

66
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.562
So this is actually a good
opportunity here is, what happened?

67
00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:34.384
So I'm trying to essentially do the forms.

68
00:05:34.384 --> 00:05:39.173
And if I had had my terminal up,
I would have seen this immediate,

69
00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:42.130
and like I can't buy the ngModel.

70
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.407
It's not a known property of input.

71
00:05:45.407 --> 00:05:53.580
And so how that happened is I am trying
to essentially add form functionality and

72
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.900
I have it imported, the form module.

73
00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.510
There we go.

74
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.490
So, forms module.

75
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.590
And what this does is now that I've
imported it coming from Angular forms,

76
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.530
let's go back and make sure,
so it's compiled successfully.

77
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.494
Let's hop back into the browser and

78
00:06:16.494 --> 00:06:21.468
let's make sure that it's there.

79
00:06:21.468 --> 00:06:29.280
So refresh, Double check,
And we'll go back in here.

80
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.732
Let's just restart the server.

81
00:06:38.352 --> 00:06:42.865
And one other thing that I may
be doing here, let me check,

82
00:06:50.382 --> 00:06:53.512
That module, forms module, we're good.

83
00:07:02.761 --> 00:07:04.537
All right, let's compile successfully.

84
00:07:07.754 --> 00:07:12.017
Input themeColor, themeColor, text,

85
00:07:12.017 --> 00:07:16.897
let me just move this off
to the side real quick.

86
00:07:16.897 --> 00:07:19.242
All right, let's go here.

87
00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:26.800
There we go, red, so
I feel like this could be a little bigger.

88
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.420
All right, let's put this back.

89
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.410
Whoever called out the forms module,
bless your heart.

90
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.026
I'm gonna save this.

91
00:07:35.825 --> 00:07:41.470
And, Austin, I heart you, I love you.

92
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:41.970
Thank you.

93
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.840
If I wasn't hanging with friends,
I would be really bothered right now.

94
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:52.944
But now what I can do is I'm
changing this from blue to

95
00:07:52.944 --> 00:07:58.070
black to, I don't know.

96
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.560
Let's me see that.

97
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.586
I was gonna do turquoise, but

98
00:08:04.586 --> 00:08:09.299
[LAUGH] I think I'm taking my life
in my hands at that point, magenta.

99
00:08:09.299 --> 00:08:12.294
And if we go back to here,

100
00:08:12.294 --> 00:08:17.011
let me do just the string binding here.

101
00:08:17.011 --> 00:08:21.261
So, ThemeColor here,

102
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:25.278
I'm gonna put a horizontal rule
just to kind of break this up.

103
00:08:25.278 --> 00:08:27.338
All right, save.

104
00:08:29.755 --> 00:08:30.821
Let's go back here.

105
00:08:32.783 --> 00:08:35.272
What I think I'm gonna do just
to make this a little easier,

106
00:08:37.795 --> 00:08:41.645
I'm gonna just put this in,
there we go, all right.

107
00:08:41.645 --> 00:08:45.586
And so now you can see I'm
doing string binding here, and

108
00:08:45.586 --> 00:08:47.650
it's just saying it's red.

109
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.370
We're binding this property
to the attribute and so

110
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:57.060
it's actually rendering as red, and

111
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.270
then in here,
it's putting it into the input.

112
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:06.200
So if I go here, notice that
when I type it, it's showing up

113
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:11.490
over at the top, just because we're
changing the property on the class.

114
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:17.140
And then the minute that it turns into
something that the template recognizes,

115
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.690
we are good to go.

116
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.859
So then if I go green, there we go.
