00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.078
So one of the big things
that I use modules for is,

2
00:00:05.078 --> 00:00:09.310
if you're looking like angular material,
so I'm just going to Google this.

3
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.449
Is every one of the angular
material components is

4
00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.671
essentially broken up into its own module.

5
00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:24.155
And the reason being is that,
if all you need is like autocomplete,

6
00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:28.100
well, you don't need to import
all the angular material.

7
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.702
And so what they've done is
they have broken this up so

8
00:00:32.702 --> 00:00:37.110
that you can just import
the stuff that you need.

9
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.140
Well, if you do the root level module,
it starts to get very, very large.

10
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.390
And so what I do is when, in

11
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.780
an application I'm using angular material,
which is probably 9.9 times out of 10,

12
00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.090
is I create a standalone material module.

13
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.180
And so what I do is I just
import all the material modules.

14
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.740
And then I just export it to the rest of
the application so that it is available.

15
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.908
And so if you go to the angular material
website, and you can look at the samples,

16
00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:20.077
there's just like this checkbox here,
and it'll send you out to a StackBlitz.

17
00:01:20.077 --> 00:01:23.950
And so StackBlitz is pretty phenomenal.

18
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.471
They got a ton of really
good working examples.

19
00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:32.980
And so sometimes if I just want
to play around with something,

20
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.550
I'll just do it right in the StackBlitz.

21
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.487
But you'll notice here, and
I apologize this is very, very small.

22
00:01:40.487 --> 00:01:43.050
I think I can probably bump this up a bit.

23
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.220
Is if I go over here, right in the app,

24
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.590
there's a material-module.ts.

25
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.730
And I'll bump this back down just a bit.

26
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.148
And if you look here, there's this huge,

27
00:02:01.148 --> 00:02:06.670
huge, Basically list of all the modules.

28
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.833
And so what I do is I just come in here,
I'll just copy this, and we'll go here.

29
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:22.630
And, Let me try something.

30
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.740
If I go ng g m for
module material -d for dry run.

31
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.718
So I'm trying to do this off the top
of my head, but see what happens.

32
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:40.994
All right, so you can see here,
it generated this module.

33
00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:45.510
It's putting it in a material folder,
I'm not gonna do that,

34
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.480
but you could put it there.

35
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.026
What I'll do is I'm just going
to come in here and in the app,

36
00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:56.410
new file, and
I'm gonna go just material.module.ts.

37
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.880
And I'm not gonna paste that in.

38
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.970
What I am gonna do is go back to my
StackBlitz, I don't know how I lost that.

39
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.160
Copy, let's hop back into VS code,
and I'm gonna paste this in.

40
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.110
And I'm going to call this MaterialModule.

41
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.080
And so now, what I'm doing is I'm just
importing all of these individual

42
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.659
components, and then I'm exporting them.

43
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.880
And so
I'm basically creating a barrel roll.

44
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.010
I'm saying roll these all up and make them
available to the rest of your application.

45
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.860
And so now, if I go to app module,
what I can do is

46
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.749
in the imports,
I can now import MaterialModule.

47
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.170
And what this does is it
now makes every single

48
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.890
material component available
to the rest of my application.

49
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.010
And I don't have to go and
import that over and

50
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.010
over and over, is I'll important
in the components themselves.

51
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.264
But this is a good example of,
I really wanna organize this group

52
00:04:07.264 --> 00:04:13.800
of dependencies into a single place, and
make it available to my application.

53
00:04:16.824 --> 00:04:23.930
And so this is a really nice way to
essentially group things up into a module.

54
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.890
And then now if I went
into like ItemsComponent,

55
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.870
or any of these components, I can now
start to add in these material components

56
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.360
without having to import them
one by one into the main module.

57
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.763
Another thing that I do, admittedly,

58
00:04:41.763 --> 00:04:50.454
is because I think it's impossible
to memorize an entire SDK.

59
00:04:50.454 --> 00:04:51.890
Let me just pull one here.

60
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.390
And so
I typically have this on speed dial.

61
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.260
I use cards a lot, and
we will actually see this in place.

62
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.020
So now what I can do is
we just use mat card.

63
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.291
And so this is actually a really
good segway to let me go to,

64
00:05:19.761 --> 00:05:24.490
In the appcomponent.html,
there's a lot of stuff happening here.

65
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.420
So I'm gonna just delete that, sorry.

66
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.710
Starter project, you're out here.

67
00:05:32.183 --> 00:05:36.530
You'll notice that as I start to type,
in my code here,

68
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.350
I'm starting to get these kind
of like autocomplete things.

69
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.970
So I don't know why they didn't complete,
it should have.

70
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.552
But if I go here, there we go.

71
00:05:48.552 --> 00:05:54.080
I don't want to mark our actions but
we'll do mat-card here.

72
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.558
Hello!

73
00:05:57.558 --> 00:05:59.850
So let me save this.

74
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:00.857
Let's go back here.

75
00:06:03.055 --> 00:06:04.595
Let's refresh this.

76
00:06:06.952 --> 00:06:08.400
Let me make sure this is still running.

77
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.400
I might have actually stuffed this,
No, there we go.

78
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.680
So we're gonna let this
compile real quick.

79
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.880
So kind of this first pass,

80
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.980
it has built out these modules so
it doesn't have to do it again.

81
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:29.390
So it's just optimizing the build and
then we will see this working.

82
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.420
So definitely if you feel like I've
kind of glossed over something, and

83
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.580
you want to see it, I welcome that.

84
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.750
Like, hey you showed how to
get material components in but

85
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.350
you didn't actually
show us how to use one.

86
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.050
And so we're letting this build here.

87
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.010
And this is, kind of, we're putting
everything in, at once, just for

88
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.840
convenience sake.

89
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.710
But again, if you're doing something for
production, what I do is I go through and

90
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.360
I prune out what I'm not using.

91
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.330
So we'll give this just a moment,
and while that's building,

92
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.510
what I will do is let's
just hop back here.

93
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:19.574
The one other piece that I wanna call
out since we're talking about material

94
00:07:19.574 --> 00:07:25.078
components is, you'll notice here if
you go to the angular material site,

95
00:07:25.078 --> 00:07:27.405
there are these components on.

96
00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:31.667
Or you have the components page and has
all these components that are available to

97
00:07:31.667 --> 00:07:33.620
use and there's a bunch of them.

98
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.150
It's really good.

99
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.315
But what you also have is if you
go up here, there is the CDK.

100
00:07:40.315 --> 00:07:42.801
And so the component dev kit,

101
00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:48.376
what they've done is they noticed
that across these components,

102
00:07:48.376 --> 00:07:53.600
there was a lot of functionality
that was being reused.

103
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.790
And so they separated out material
components, where that functioned out into

104
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:02.760
a component development kit
from the components themselves.

105
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.730
And so what this does is, it gives you for

106
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:14.920
instance accessibility, clipboard drag and
drop which I've used quite a bit.

107
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.140
So pretty easy, so there's also just,

108
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:23.550
again is a convenience when we talk about
angular being a batteries kind of included

109
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:29.310
framework is angular material is part
of angular, the cdk is part of angular.

110
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:34.650
And you have all these things here
that you can kind of just get for

111
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.540
free, you just have to add it.

112
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.330
And so for instance,
break points and stuff.

113
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.680
And so we're not going to get into
those step by exhaustively, but

114
00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:49.730
I do want to surface like you have all
these components that you click through.

115
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.770
Where actually when we get to forms we'll
talk about definitely input for sure.

116
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:59.690
And it's really easy to just come in,
grab this code, paste it over.

117
00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:04.560
Even as you saw, you can step into
a StackBlitz and do it that way.

118
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.190
So just a really, really convenient thing.

119
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.900
So I believe this is done.

120
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.784
I'm throwing some errors here, let's see.

121
00:09:16.395 --> 00:09:17.367
What I need to get.

122
00:09:17.367 --> 00:09:22.290
If this doesn't work, I may be
importing the wrong components here.

123
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:29.511
So what happened with angular 9
is you had a compile system that

124
00:09:29.511 --> 00:09:34.520
kind of the legacy compile system.

125
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.287
And now with angular 9, they introduced
IV, which I talked about that a little bit

126
00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:43.051
more, but it's a much much,
much, much more optimized build.

127
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:45.600
And that might have just been a hiccup.

128
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.340
So let's see here.

129
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.580
Refresh, oops, there we go.

130
00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.390
So I haven't put any styling.

131
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.110
But here's the card.

132
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.950
Now, let me add another one in.

133
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:02.104
So I'm just gonna copy this so we can see.

134
00:10:02.104 --> 00:10:03.253
We'll go into here.

135
00:10:05.091 --> 00:10:10.090
Save this, Compiled successfully, good.

136
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.020
We'll hop in.

137
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.510
And now you can see the form.

138
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:18.980
So what this looks like in the code, and

139
00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.990
without context they say yeah,
that's two form fields.

140
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.740
Is how you see or

141
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.730
how you leverage a component is
through kind of these selectors here.

142
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:34.830
So if you wanted to add another card,
it's this mat-card, and so

143
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:40.880
you can kind of see here that I'm getting
these hints of what is available.

144
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.250
And then I'll do a form field etc.

145
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:51.050
And one thing I will point out is if you

146
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:56.160
go to your plugins,
there's a bunch of really helpful ones.

147
00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:01.269
And the one that I like to
use is this Angular Material

148
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:04.820
2 Flex Layout, snippets thing.

149
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.365
And so I can even in the repository,

150
00:11:08.365 --> 00:11:11.710
I do some of the snippets
that I see is is helpful.

151
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:16.480
So you can see here, mat-tab-group,
you click and it just streamlines that.

152
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.100
So this is this is one plugin
that I use quite a bit, and

153
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.222
this is my one time technologies,
five stars.

154
00:11:25.222 --> 00:11:29.852
140,000 downloads,
I'd say that's probably pretty good.

155
00:11:29.852 --> 00:11:35.270
So this is again the name
of the game is efficiency.
