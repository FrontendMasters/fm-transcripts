00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.650
What we have here is essentially
the boilerplate starting piece.

2
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:14.023
Now I'm going to Talk
about a couple things.

3
00:00:14.023 --> 00:00:19.671
And I have to, I kind of have to
hint at a couple things initially,

4
00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:25.652
before we really get into a full
fledged kind of a standalone module.

5
00:00:25.652 --> 00:00:27.871
But there's a couple things
I'm going to touch on.

6
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:30.305
Just so we know what's happening.

7
00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:36.263
In our HTML,
you'll notice we have this router outlet.

8
00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:39.499
And if I take this away.

9
00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:43.320
Let me just go back to our html.

10
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.830
Notice that nothing is in here.

11
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.250
If I go back to my code,
and I put this back in, and

12
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.220
we refresh the page,
notice we now have a component here.

13
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.250
Well, what's happening?

14
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:06.588
So the other way to get a component
onto the page is via a route.

15
00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:13.653
And how this works is if we
look in our routing module,

16
00:01:13.653 --> 00:01:19.001
we have essentially this routes array.

17
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:23.490
And this has the simplest route.

18
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.420
And this is as far as we're going on this.

19
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.277
But I want to show how this is working,
is we have a path, it's home.

20
00:01:32.277 --> 00:01:33.986
We have a path courses.

21
00:01:33.986 --> 00:01:36.847
And we're attaching it.

22
00:01:36.847 --> 00:01:38.915
We're assigning it a component.

23
00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:42.581
So the simplest form of a route
is a path and component.

24
00:01:42.581 --> 00:01:43.978
And it's just an object.

25
00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:50.590
And what that's saying is,
when I go to this path in the URL,

26
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.320
take this component and
put it in the router outlet.

27
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.906
And so you'll notice here,

28
00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:04.526
if I go back to the browser it's saying,
okay we're at home.

29
00:02:04.526 --> 00:02:05.786
So it's examining the path in the URL.

30
00:02:05.786 --> 00:02:08.107
And saying I recognize that.

31
00:02:08.107 --> 00:02:12.213
And it's putting the home
component into the router outlet.

32
00:02:12.213 --> 00:02:18.667
If I go to courses, you'll notice
that it's saying I recognize this.

33
00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:26.579
And it's putting the course
component into the router outlet.

34
00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.804
And so this is how we
are rendering these components

35
00:02:31.804 --> 00:02:35.947
is we switch from kind of route to route.

36
00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.691
It's matching that path.

37
00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:42.378
And just dropping that component
into the router outlet.

38
00:02:42.378 --> 00:02:46.884
And so what I can do here is in the router
outlet, because it's just rendering,

39
00:02:46.884 --> 00:02:48.379
I'm just gonna do an h1.

40
00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.664
Hello workshop.

41
00:02:50.664 --> 00:02:51.789
There we go.

42
00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:53.155
I'm gonna save it.

43
00:02:53.155 --> 00:02:54.505
Hop back in.

44
00:02:54.505 --> 00:02:57.053
And you can see it's just rendering.

45
00:02:57.053 --> 00:03:01.569
So it's a router outlet is really
just another angular component

46
00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.434
that just receives a dynamic component and
renders it.

47
00:03:05.434 --> 00:03:08.150
And so that's how that is working.
