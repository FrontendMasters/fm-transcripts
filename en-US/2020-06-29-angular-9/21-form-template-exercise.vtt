00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.420
So if we look in the courses component,
you notice that

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.291
the object itself we have two

3
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:15.260
fields, one for title,
one for description.

4
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.960
But we have two more,

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.530
that we have not added into our form.

6
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.930
And so what I'd like to do,
is just do a real quick challenge,

7
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.580
where I would like
everybody to take a stab at

8
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.657
hooking these two remaining
fields into the appropriate,

9
00:00:38.657 --> 00:00:43.319
angular material component.

10
00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:49.175
And so just think about what
would be an appropriate control,

11
00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:54.620
for percentage, and
what would be another appropriate control,

12
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.530
for something that is Boolean,
like true or false?

13
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.820
And so we'll take just another 10 minutes,
and we'll do this small challenge, and

14
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.570
when we come back, we'll fill this form
out and then we'll talk about services.

15
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.957
So 3 2 1,
let's get the challenge completed.
