00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.231
Now one thing I'm going to show you here,
we'll hop back into the code,

2
00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:11.747
is there's another bit of I think
of sugar that you can use here,

3
00:00:11.747 --> 00:00:18.797
and that's router, LinkActive.

4
00:00:18.797 --> 00:00:22.684
Click on this, and what this does is,

5
00:00:22.684 --> 00:00:26.571
when you are on an active router link,

6
00:00:26.571 --> 00:00:31.150
it will detect that and
attach a class to it.

7
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.906
So we'll go back here, and
if we go to courses again,

8
00:00:35.906 --> 00:00:40.793
we can inspect this again,
and let me just close this.

9
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:47.937
You can see here that if we
follow this through on the class,

10
00:00:47.937 --> 00:00:49.511
there is the active class.

11
00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:52.053
So if I hopped into CSS,
I could say, for this,

12
00:00:52.053 --> 00:00:55.020
let's style this just
a little bit different.

13
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.531
And so, if you want to delineate,
I'm on this particular route or

14
00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:02.562
this button that's attached to this route,
you can do routerLinkActive.

15
00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:08.077
And then attach that class that you wanna
use to style that particular element.

16
00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:17.198
And so now that we've done that,

17
00:01:20.803 --> 00:01:26.293
We're basically just navigating
from one link to another.

18
00:01:26.293 --> 00:01:31.881
Let's go back and
let's look at the routing table itself.

19
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:36.092
So this was generated in the starting
branch, but let's just do a quick review.

20
00:01:36.092 --> 00:01:41.331
And then we'll go and we'll extend upon
this with a lazy loading route, so,

21
00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.786
When you set up your routing table,
typically,

22
00:01:48.786 --> 00:01:54.750
kind of best practice is to have
a separate routing module for your route.

23
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.911
So what that does is, that kind of is
a standalone module that contains just

24
00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:02.361
the routing table, and
all the functionality for the route.

25
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:05.344
So that's a good separation of concerns.

26
00:02:05.344 --> 00:02:09.714
Within that, you declare your route table,

27
00:02:09.714 --> 00:02:15.330
which is nothing more than
an array of route objects.

28
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.526
And so if we click on this,
you can kinda step into this interface,

29
00:02:22.526 --> 00:02:27.970
and kinda poke around and
see what is available.

30
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.841
I'm not gonna get too much into that.

31
00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:35.401
But I think the two things
that are the most basic

32
00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:40.823
piece of a route is the path and
the component.

33
00:02:40.823 --> 00:02:46.064
And so for the home path,
we're attaching the home component.

34
00:02:46.064 --> 00:02:50.909
For the courses path,
we're attaching the courses component,

35
00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.560
which goes into the router outlet.

36
00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.992
Now, let's talk about this
route here at the bottom,

37
00:03:00.992 --> 00:03:04.312
and so this is a wildcard route.

38
00:03:04.312 --> 00:03:09.590
And what this does is, if I were to go and
just put any route in there and

39
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.686
it doesn't match up,
what it's going to do is, it's gonna say,

40
00:03:14.686 --> 00:03:19.971
I don't recognize this route,
I'm just going to redirect to home.

41
00:03:19.971 --> 00:03:25.009
And so this is a way to essentially ensure
kind of some route safety around your

42
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:29.910
route, so somebody doesn't end up in
a broken state in your application.

43
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.877
The other thing that is worth
mentioning on the route table

44
00:03:35.877 --> 00:03:40.291
is that the order of the routes
in the array matters.

45
00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:45.289
And so for instance,
I've had essentially route

46
00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:50.049
conflicts because I put
a very specific route in

47
00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.816
the wrong order in relation
to a general route.

48
00:03:54.816 --> 00:03:58.859
And it was triggering the first route
before it could trigger the route that I

49
00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.262
actually wanted to go to.

50
00:04:00.262 --> 00:04:04.696
So if you find that you're trying
to route to a particular route, and

51
00:04:04.696 --> 00:04:09.433
it's going to a similar route, but
not where you wanna go, one thing that

52
00:04:09.433 --> 00:04:14.248
you can check, because route does order,
it's just gonna parse it down,

53
00:04:14.248 --> 00:04:18.023
top to bottom, is that you may
need to reorder your route.

54
00:04:18.023 --> 00:04:22.670
So for instance, if you wanna have
a route param, you wanna say,

55
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.459
I wanna route to this specific course,

56
00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:30.320
I would put that underneath
the the general courses route.

57
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.148
And so just to point that out,
if you start to see kind of that behavior,

58
00:04:36.148 --> 00:04:40.731
it's possible that your
routing order is not correct.

59
00:04:40.731 --> 00:04:45.171
And a route is being triggered before
the route that you actually wanna go to.
