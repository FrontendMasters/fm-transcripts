1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.868
The first step, display courses using ng4.

2
00:00:03.868 --> 00:00:06.922
So we'll hop into the template and

3
00:00:06.922 --> 00:00:13.020
I'm gonna go to the course list
container here at the div class.

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:20.472
And then within this card,
I'm going to do a mat-list.

5
00:00:20.472 --> 00:00:25.444
So let's see if I can get
this to generate since I was

6
00:00:25.444 --> 00:00:30.430
a little bit hit or miss,
but I at least want to try.

7
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.570
No, no luck.

8
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.620
So with that said,

9
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.600
I will just do this by hand mat-list.

10
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.320
And then within here,
we're gonna do a mat-list-item.

11
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.576
Let me try this again.

12
00:00:49.576 --> 00:00:53.660
Well, so mat-list-item.

13
00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.400
And within the mat-list-item,
we're going to loop over the courses.

14
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.120
So we'll go ng4.

15
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.177
And from here it's let course of courses.

16
00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:16.741
And this is just going to iterate.

17
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:22.333
So this is in its simplest form,
a functional for loop.

18
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:27.200
And then within this let's just go course

19
00:01:34.272 --> 00:01:37.260
Title, there we go.

20
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.474
All right, let's hop into our browser.

21
00:01:40.474 --> 00:01:43.432
And let me just change the route here, so

22
00:01:43.432 --> 00:01:48.052
we replace home with components or
courses, rather, sorry.

23
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.080
There we go, and
you can see that it is rendering.

24
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.650
Now, I saw somebody in chat say,
let me try this one more time.

25
00:02:04.058 --> 00:02:05.301
That they tried.

26
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.151
All I was looking for.

27
00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:12.840
All right, no worries.

28
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.330
Okay, so this is okay, but
I feel like it could be a little better.

29
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.150
So I'm going to just extend
a little bit on this.

30
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.300
And this is just merely from
perusing through the documentation.

31
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.690
But let's go h3 and
I'm going to attach matline.

32
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.810
And so what this does is it
just forces it into a line.

33
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.671
So again, this is just from
reading the documentation, and

34
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:42.316
just kind of understanding
what options are available.

35
00:02:42.316 --> 00:02:46.750
But then underneath of that,
let's do a p tag.

36
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.765
I'm also gonna make this matline and

37
00:02:50.765 --> 00:02:54.527
we'll do course.description.

38
00:02:57.085 --> 00:03:01.233
And I just caught a typo, all right?

39
00:03:04.477 --> 00:03:05.372
There we go.

40
00:03:05.372 --> 00:03:10.827
And let's save this and
see if this renders properly.

41
00:03:10.827 --> 00:03:11.780
I forgot something.

42
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.920
In my haste, I forgot to close that.

43
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.640
Let's go back here.

44
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.500
There we go, perfect.

45
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.610
All right, so now what we need to do is
we need the ability to select a course.

46
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.320
So I believe this is the second piece.

47
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.616
So the first thing I'm gonna
do here is I'm going to create

48
00:03:34.616 --> 00:03:42.460
a selectedCourse property, and
I'm going to set it to null.

49
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.400
Then from there just underneath to this,

50
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.440
so properties go on top
methods go on the bottom.

51
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.470
I'm gonna go selectCourse.

52
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.207
We'll pass in a course parameter and

53
00:03:55.207 --> 00:04:00.149
then we'll go this
selectedCourse = course.

54
00:04:01.681 --> 00:04:02.940
Okay?

55
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.210
Then from here,
let's hop back into our template.

56
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.100
And we will bind to the click event.

57
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.649
So put that in parentheses,
selectCourse and we'll pass in course.

58
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.250
And I believe this is working.

59
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.762
This is kind of, I have high
confidence but I'll just go ahead and

60
00:04:27.762 --> 00:04:32.890
we'll just log this out incrementally,
courseSelected,

61
00:04:35.524 --> 00:04:38.573
course, there we go.

62
00:04:38.573 --> 00:04:39.984
Let's hop into here.

63
00:04:39.984 --> 00:04:45.370
I'm gonna open up the console,
there we go.

64
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.165
So you can see course selected,
very good, okay?

65
00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:57.185
So the next step to complete our challenge

66
00:04:57.185 --> 00:05:01.829
is we need to render the selected

67
00:05:01.829 --> 00:05:07.420
course inside of the second column.

68
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.630
So pretty straightforward.

69
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.760
We're just going to do our
pre tag selectedCourse.

70
00:05:16.594 --> 00:05:19.667
We'll bind this here and
let's just see real quick,

71
00:05:19.667 --> 00:05:24.334
cuz we haven't really talked about this
is if you don't do JSON, what happens?

72
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.371
So we'll go back here.

73
00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:30.460
And notice it's just
saying it's an object.

74
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.130
And so it's just kind of like

75
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.880
a console log without actually
doing anything with it.

76
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.260
But when you add in the JSON pipe under
the hood, what it does is it pipes that

77
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.490
output into this pipe and
it converts it into JSON.

78
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.550
So back into the code or
back into the app.

79
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:59.335
We click on this and you can now see that
we have the ability to select a course.

80
00:05:59.335 --> 00:06:04.100
Now, just for the sake of continuity,
I'm going to add in

81
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.830
just a few more pieces to keep

82
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.560
this application in kind of a coherent
narrative arc as I would develop it.

83
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.350
So this is what we're trying
to balance here is kind

84
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.480
of these concepts in a sequential order,
as well as trying to capture kind of

85
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.580
some organic developments like
this is how I would code.

86
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.970
So within our matlist item,
I want to give the ability to not only

87
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.940
select a course, but also to delete it.

88
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.760
So I'm going to create a button and

89
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.580
I'm going to add mat-icon-button.

90
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.300
And so this is another
angular material component or

91
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.640
directive that we put on and so
I'm gonna give this a color of orne.

92
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.968
At first I thought that was warm.

93
00:06:58.968 --> 00:07:07.170
I realized not so much, and then within
the button, I'm going to put a map icon.

94
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.460
And I'm just going to put delete.

95
00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:14.630
All right, let's just save this to make
sure I haven't went off the rails.

96
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:15.480
No, there we go.

97
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.410
So you can click but
notice when I click the button,

98
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.300
that because we're dealing with native
DOM events, it's actually bubbling up.

99
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.310
And so we'll address that in just
a moment, so back into the code.

100
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.080
I'm going to add another click handler and

101
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.680
I'm going to say deleteCourse.

102
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.720
Now in this case, the only information
I need to delete the course is the ID.

103
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.640
And you notice because I have the angular
language service running that

104
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:53.510
it's not defined.

105
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.300
So this is really handy.

106
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.525
So I can hop back in here.

107
00:07:57.525 --> 00:08:04.096
And I can fill this out
real quick courseId.

108
00:08:04.096 --> 00:08:12.067
And, courseDeleted,

109
00:08:12.067 --> 00:08:15.977
we'll just log this out as well.

110
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.990
There we go.

111
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:27.410
And back into our application,
I'll pull up the console.

112
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:33.090
And this is going to be somewhat
interesting, is I clicked this.

113
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.727
Notice a couple things happened.

114
00:08:36.727 --> 00:08:40.918
The first one being that
I clicked the delete

115
00:08:40.918 --> 00:08:45.335
button which had fired the event handler,
but

116
00:08:45.335 --> 00:08:51.236
that event bubbled up and
inadvertently I selected a course.

117
00:08:51.236 --> 00:08:52.940
So, how do we handle this?

118
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:57.444
So back into the code, we'll go here and

119
00:08:57.444 --> 00:09:01.287
what we need to do is essentially,

120
00:09:01.287 --> 00:09:05.406
just to stop the event propagation.

121
00:09:05.406 --> 00:09:10.909
So what we'll do here is and I'm gonna
break this to a second line just so

122
00:09:10.909 --> 00:09:13.402
we can see this in its entirety.

123
00:09:17.238 --> 00:09:22.024
In a click handler or in an event handler,
you can put in more than one function,

124
00:09:22.024 --> 00:09:24.180
which is what we're gonna do here.

125
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.453
So, with every event handler,

126
00:09:26.453 --> 00:09:31.810
there is an event property a dollar
event that we have access to.

127
00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:40.530
And so
now I can go stopImmediatePropagation,

128
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:45.310
and this should do the trick.

129
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:52.498
So I'll save this, and
let's go back into our application.

130
00:09:52.498 --> 00:09:56.840
Notice it fired down here, but

131
00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.851
I did not select the course.

132
00:10:00.851 --> 00:10:04.785
So let's just do one more thing
real quick to just tie this up,

133
00:10:04.785 --> 00:10:07.150
make it nice and neat.

134
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:14.918
And that is, Here, what we'll do,

135
00:10:17.545 --> 00:10:21.952
Is we'll do ngIf and

136
00:10:21.952 --> 00:10:29.219
we'll just do selectedCourse.

137
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:35.364
So pretty simple, we're just gonna say
if it's not null, then we'll show it, or

138
00:10:35.364 --> 00:10:40.076
if it's not null, we'll show it, if it is,
don't show anything in this case.

139
00:10:40.076 --> 00:10:45.410
So we'll go back here into our app,
nothing here, I select it.

140
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:48.030
There we go.
