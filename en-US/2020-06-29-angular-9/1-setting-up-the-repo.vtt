00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.016
We're just gonna clone the repo.

2
00:00:02.016 --> 00:00:04.549
I will do this with everybody.

3
00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.835
So Get clone.

4
00:00:10.835 --> 00:00:18.320
We'll just pull this down and
we'll just step into this.

5
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.819
So NPM install.

6
00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:28.150
And while this is doing this.

7
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.570
The one thing that I will point
out is we're on the master branch,

8
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.660
which has pretty much a pretty
good place of where I wanna go.

9
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.692
By the end of the day if we are Within

10
00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:46.520
the neighborhood of the master branch,
I will be pretty happy.

11
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.520
To save everybody plenty of time,
because this is an Angular workshop,

12
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:58.420
not a typing workshop, I went ahead and
created a 00 start branch.

13
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.000
And I will show you what that
looks like in just a moment.

14
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.920
But what I've done is just some
of the HTML templating and

15
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.910
the styles and
different things I've went ahead and and

16
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.990
I've laid a foundation for us to just
kind of jump in and start building.

17
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.490
So I don't wanna spend two hours
just building up templates in HTML.

18
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.620
So there are two branches here and
then as we progress through the workshop,

19
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.650
we'll actually cut the branch and
save a backup, so

20
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.800
hopefully by the end of the day,
we have eight branches, whatever.

21
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.620
All right, so that is pushed up and

22
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.940
one of the things that I do want to point
out is, well, let's run this real quick.

23
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.520
And then then we'll get into
the angular CLI and what that does.

24
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.020
So there's a small caveat here.

25
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.150
So let me go, code,
let me hop into VS code.

26
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.770
And because we're going to be hooking
into a RESTful API later on today,

27
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.950
we are using a JSON server,
which is a really,

28
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.340
really nice way to create a mock REST API.

29
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.790
So we have two commands here.

30
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.490
If you just run NPM start, it's just
going to spin up the Angular server.

31
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.930
If you run NPM run server,
you're gonna spin up the JSON server.

32
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.580
What I've done is using concurrently

33
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.190
is I've just created another convenience
method to run them both at the same time.

34
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.436
Concurrently, surprisingly so.

35
00:02:38.436 --> 00:02:40.626
Let me just show you what that looks like.

36
00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:48.059
NPM run server all And so you can see

37
00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:53.470
here this spun up the JSON server, which
is just basically going to the JSON file.

38
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.760
And it's saying based on the JSON,
you have a courses endpoint.

39
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.020
And then it's going to compile he
Angular application into ES modules.

40
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.700
So this does take just a little
bit of time the first time around.

41
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.760
And but once this is done, I can show you
the app, we can kind of just click through

42
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:21.010
it, and
then we'll move on to the Angular CLI.

43
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.280
And one of the things that is
happening here that possibly in maybe

44
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.180
a production app or something is just for

45
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.100
convenience, I've imported all of
the kind of Angular material components.

46
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.470
But that's just for convenience probably

47
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.340
in, like in a production scenario,
I would definitely parse that down.
