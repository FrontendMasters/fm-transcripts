00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.530
So one thing that I did in
the interim is I went ahead and

2
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.840
checked in the code that I'd
been working on live coding.

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.950
So if you go back to the repo, you'll see
this 01 component fundamentals branch.

4
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.600
And so if you want to get caught back up
to where I am, I definitely recommend

5
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.860
you can do get fetch all on
the command line and pull that down.

6
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.899
So I'll just show you real quick.

7
00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:39.177
You'll get that get fetch -- all
It'll go and upload the branches so

8
00:00:39.177 --> 00:00:44.134
obviously because I had that branch
it was already on my computer, but

9
00:00:44.134 --> 00:00:49.006
if you don't, it'll pull that branch
down and then you can then, so

10
00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:51.380
I'm just gonna hop onto master.

11
00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:02.076
Oops, here you can go
just get checked out.

12
00:01:02.076 --> 00:01:09.390
01, component fundamentals, there we go.

13
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.280
And so this is pretty much right where
I left off before we went on break and

14
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.450
so what I'd like to do is I wanna
do a quick coding challenge.

15
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.340
So I wanna give everybody
an opportunity to reinforce What

16
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.640
they have seen in the previous module.

17
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.750
So it's going to be fairly simple,
and I'll explain it to everyone and

18
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.650
then we'll just do a quick break, maybe
ten minutes to the coding challenge, and

19
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.660
then we'll come back and
we'll get into forums.

20
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.960
So, in our home component we
spent quite a bit of time

21
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.640
iterating over this course
lessons displaying it in the DOM.

22
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.846
We also created some
additional properties.

23
00:01:56.846 --> 00:02:04.039
We display that via binding and then using
event binding we then from our template,

24
00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:10.202
when we selected a lesson, then we
pass that back into the component and

25
00:02:10.202 --> 00:02:15.670
then using this JSON pipe over here,
we were able to dump it in.

26
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.660
So what this looks like is if we hop
back here, you can see these lessons.

27
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.510
And let me just refresh.

28
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.700
There we go.

29
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.800
And as I select it down here, if there's
no lesson selected, then you get a prompt.

30
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.410
So what I would like everybody
to do real quick is to

31
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.910
if you open up the courses component.

32
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.066
And the courses component.html, so,

33
00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:49.980
courses component.ts,
coursescomponenthtml.

34
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.320
We are going to essentially flesh or
build this out.

35
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.030
So, in our courses component,
we have a single course.

36
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.290
What I would recommend, you do just
to make sure that ng4 is working

37
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.480
is you could, add another course in here.

38
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.534
So I'm just going to go 2 just

39
00:03:18.534 --> 00:03:26.230
go JavaScript The Really
Really Hard Parts.

40
00:03:31.231 --> 00:03:38.524
And Worship Will Sentence.

41
00:03:38.524 --> 00:03:41.215
We'll set percent complete to 50.

42
00:03:41.215 --> 00:03:45.558
I mean, so this is completely arbitrary.

43
00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:47.975
But, I'm just adding another one in here.

44
00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:53.374
And so take the courses array using ng4 in

45
00:03:53.374 --> 00:03:58.600
the courses component.html,

46
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:05.810
I would like for you to loop over and
display the courses in a course list and

47
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.730
then when you select a course,
then what you can do is just dump it out

48
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.360
in this course details caught over here.

49
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:24.150
So if you get stuck, everything you
need to know to complete this challenge

50
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.972
is over in home component.ts and
home component.html.

51
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.870
So the idea is to display the courses

52
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.700
In a course list using ng4 and
then, add an event handler

53
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.500
to the courses component,
that when you select it,

54
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.320
it creates a selected course and
then you just display that.

55
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.892
So what I'm going to do,
is I'm going to just add

56
00:04:59.892 --> 00:05:04.921
a couple quick notes here for
people to follow along.

57
00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:07.856
Challenge step one

58
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.486
Display courses In,

59
00:05:21.413 --> 00:05:25.065
Using ng4.

60
00:05:25.065 --> 00:05:31.380
Step two,
add event handler to select course.

61
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.847
And then step three Display

62
00:05:38.847 --> 00:05:44.130
raw JSON of selected course.

63
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.350
All right, so three steps.

64
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.730
I think that using home
component home component.ts,

65
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:57.350
this is probably 10 minutes worth of work.

66
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:05.750
And what I'm going to do is, I will also
just push this up real quick, git status.

67
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.670
Okay, so I've modified one course,
so git add,

68
00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:16.829
Challenge description.

69
00:06:23.977 --> 00:06:24.908
All right.

70
00:06:24.908 --> 00:06:27.440
So, this has been pushed up.

71
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.650
So if you wanna pull
this branch back down,

72
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.550
you can get the challenge
here of what we want to do

73
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.982
recommend that you reference home
component.ts home component.html
