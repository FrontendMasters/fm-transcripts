00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.560
Now, I want to show you

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.970
something interesting as it
pertains to state management.

3
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.793
Notice when I start typing
what's happening here.

4
00:00:28.764 --> 00:00:29.551
How is this happening?

5
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:34.294
Well, pretty simple object is, or

6
00:00:34.294 --> 00:00:39.353
JavaScript is object by reference and

7
00:00:39.353 --> 00:00:46.400
so Pointing to the same object
in three different places.

8
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.760
Remember what I said about
shared mutable state.

9
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.305
Now, I want to be clear.

10
00:00:51.305 --> 00:00:55.877
Shared state is okay.

11
00:00:55.877 --> 00:01:00.790
Obviously I mean,
what do you think is happening here?

12
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.756
I'm sharing state.

13
00:01:04.756 --> 00:01:08.162
Mutable state is okay of course,
you have to mutate state eventually,

14
00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:10.221
you have to allow
the user to make updates.

15
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:14.246
Shared mutable state is the devil.

16
00:01:14.246 --> 00:01:17.983
So what do you do about that?

17
00:01:17.983 --> 00:01:22.008
How do you handle shared mutable state?

18
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.580
So already I've mutated this and

19
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.500
the question is,
how do I go back and undo this?

20
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.510
Well, thankfully,
I didn't save it to the server.

21
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.270
But that's where state mutations
are really, really bad.

22
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.670
And so what you do in this case, I'm going
to show you how to solve this problem or

23
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.120
one way, is if you had shared
mutable state,what you have to do

24
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.830
is make your shared
mutable state not shared.

25
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.270
You have to break that connection so it's
no longer shared that it's standalone.

26
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.650
And so how you do that?

27
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.200
Is inside of your course
details component.

28
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.859
I'm going to Move this down,

29
00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:13.740
because we're gonna do some
a little bit of logic here.

30
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.680
I going to create Another
property called selected course.

31
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.709
And then, from here,
I'm going to set this as a setter.

32
00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.110
So set, I'm doing this from memory so
hopefully this works.

33
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.866
And you want to say if value exists
then We are going to do something.

34
00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:51.920
So as long as we are passing something in,
then we're going to do something.

35
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.605
And so here, we're gonna do this
selected course equals object.assign.

36
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.250
And we're going to create a clone of
the course object that we send in.

37
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.976
And so this is what object.assign is.

38
00:03:10.976 --> 00:03:14.629
So I could kind of get into some
immutable operations for time will,

39
00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.698
I'm going to defer that.

40
00:03:16.698 --> 00:03:20.870
But what object.assign does is it says,

41
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.370
take from right to left and
start assigning values.

42
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.540
Or rather I think it
does from left to right.

43
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.640
It does it kind of in order, so
it actually be from left to right as it

44
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.120
assigns any non or
any innumerable values to the new objects.

45
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.380
We're saying take value and
assign it to this object.

46
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.350
And so in this case,
it's going to be a course.

47
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.418
Now if I wanted to add even
another property is, so

48
00:03:48.418 --> 00:03:50.800
it does do it from left to right.

49
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.230
So left, left, left,

50
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.760
it's like it can say I want to
also set tittle to something else.

51
00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.960
And so I can overwrite this.

52
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.220
It's sort of applying copying things over
from the left side to the right side.

53
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.190
And, I don't need this but what this does
is that it basically creates a clone

54
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.240
of this course object
that we're setting in.

55
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.490
Now what I'm also going to do is just for
the sake of

56
00:04:28.832 --> 00:04:33.797
From a UX standpoint, so
we're still not modified a shared title.

57
00:04:33.797 --> 00:04:39.030
I'm going to go this.original

58
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.884
title equals value.title.

59
00:04:45.681 --> 00:04:46.765
All right.

60
00:04:49.675 --> 00:04:53.735
And notice it's complaining that
I'm not implementing in JSON in it.

61
00:04:53.735 --> 00:04:55.695
That's totally fine.

62
00:04:55.695 --> 00:05:01.815
Let's save this and
I am really hoping that this works.

63
00:05:01.815 --> 00:05:03.945
So TS let's throwing up let me save that.

64
00:05:05.415 --> 00:05:12.250
Let's hop in and of course,
I forgot to update my template.

65
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.415
So we go into the course
details component.

66
00:05:16.415 --> 00:05:24.310
We are no longer binding to course,
it's going to be selected course.

67
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.048
Now what I also want to do instead of the
title, we're gonna bind to original title.

68
00:05:30.048 --> 00:05:36.513
Because even though I've created a copy,
even if this was selected course,

69
00:05:36.513 --> 00:05:42.190
is I would start editing in the form and
it would still update there.

70
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:48.480
So I'm breaking all shared
kind of references.

71
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.381
So let me go here, Oops.

72
00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:05.687
Okay, let me save this.

73
00:06:05.687 --> 00:06:07.356
Hopefully this works.

74
00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:10.520
There we go.

75
00:06:12.986 --> 00:06:13.757
And I'll close this.

76
00:06:15.283 --> 00:06:21.710
Now if I start editing this Then
notice it didn't edit it up here.

77
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.990
Also, when I cancel, what happens?

78
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.240
Well, it just takes and

79
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.100
it throws away my clone object like I
haven't mutated into so I can go cancel.

80
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.330
Nobody is the wiser, and so
isolating state mutations at the component

81
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.726
level is really, really important
because you saw how that trickled up.

82
00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:45.600
And changing it here, and
it's changing it over here, which is bad.

83
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.535
And so
that's how you isolate state mutations.
