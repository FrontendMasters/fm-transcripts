00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.010
So let's do one more thing here and

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm gonna show you how to navigate
to a route using the router service.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.130
So occasionally, you need to perform
maybe some sort of business logic in,

4
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.680
you don't want to just attach the route
to an anchor tag and do that.

5
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.690
So how do you dynamically or
using the router service route

6
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.780
to a particular route versus having
to actually click on an anchor tag?

7
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.200
So if we go back to our app component and,

8
00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:47.835
Let's go to this login button here and
on the login button,

9
00:00:47.835 --> 00:00:51.930
I'm just going to attach a click handler.

10
00:00:53.651 --> 00:01:01.151
And we're just going to say logout, okay?

11
00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:05.080
So we've created this click handler,
attached the logout.

12
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:12.565
A logout does not exist on this app
component just yet, so we'll go logout.

13
00:01:14.605 --> 00:01:16.285
And from here,

14
00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:21.385
this is where we're going to use
the router service to navigate to a URL.

15
00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:26.146
So what we need to do is we need
to import the router service, so

16
00:01:26.146 --> 00:01:31.571
we'll go router And

17
00:01:31.571 --> 00:01:36.939
it would help if I could spell that,
there we go.

18
00:01:38.842 --> 00:01:43.440
So router from Angular router and
so now this is available to us.

19
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:53.030
And then we can go
this.router.navigateByUrl.

20
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.572
And from here, we'll just go login.

21
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:08.660
We'll just put a forward slash in here
just to be a little bit more precise.

22
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.050
And so if we go back into our application,
we'll go to Courses.

23
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.932
And then if I click on this, you'll notice
now that we're being redirected to login

24
00:02:19.932 --> 00:02:23.112
so we could definitely expand
on this functionality.

25
00:02:23.112 --> 00:02:27.183
But more importantly, is that here,

26
00:02:27.183 --> 00:02:32.520
we've kind of stubbed out our login route.

27
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.970
And then now using this logout button,

28
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.830
we're triggering the logout method
in our application component.

29
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.310
And then we're just calling
this.router.navigateByUrl, and

30
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.641
then we're redirecting it to login.

31
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:55.230
And so this is kind of the core
piece of Angular routing.

32
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.260
And when I think of fundamentals,
this is typically what I use,

33
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.090
I would say 95% of the time.
