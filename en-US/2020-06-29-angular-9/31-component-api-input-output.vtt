1
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.720
And then what we need to do is
I need to render some courses.

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.820
But you know what?

3
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.370
Let me go into my courses component or
my course list component .Ts, and

4
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.290
I'm just going to set this to
an empty array for right now just so

5
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.650
that we can see that it is
rendering them back here.

6
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.750
All right, so

7
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.300
all I've done is I've created a new
component, moved the template in.

8
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.030
Now it'd be really great if I could get
some courses in there to actually render.

9
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.440
Well, you are in luck.

10
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.831
So, we need to input or put the courses

11
00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:53.723
into the courses list component.

12
00:00:53.723 --> 00:00:57.701
We're going to do that via input, and so

13
00:00:57.701 --> 00:01:02.966
notice I've imported this
input from Angular core,

14
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:09.755
but remember if you're using
a decorator like this, it is a method.

15
00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:15.520
And so if you just do input without the
parentheses, it's going to be a problem.

16
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.250
It's not going to work.

17
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.990
So, I've also been bit by that.

18
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.861
So we're gonna go courses and
we'll just leave it here.

19
00:01:25.362 --> 00:01:30.904
So now, if I have an input of courses mean

20
00:01:30.904 --> 00:01:35.957
that I can put courses into this child

21
00:01:35.957 --> 00:01:41.356
component, how do I get them in there?

22
00:01:41.356 --> 00:01:44.973
Well, if I go to the courses list,
watch this.

23
00:01:48.673 --> 00:01:51.570
It's picked up courses as an attribute.

24
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.042
And so now I can say, this element
that's bound to this component

25
00:01:57.042 --> 00:02:02.820
has a custom

26
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.640
input called courses that I can then
bind to as an attribute on the template.

27
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.730
This, to me, is awesome.

28
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.030
So, here, my goodness, lo and behold,

29
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.140
I have now just taken the data
from the parent component,

30
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.751
passed it into the child
component via an input.

31
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:30.310
And let's take this a step further.

32
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.160
So those DOM events that I removed.

33
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.330
Now when somebody clicks on an element,

34
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.950
I don't want to handle that
in the child component.

35
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.840
I want to delegate it up, and so it's like
two small children, they get into a fight.

36
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.720
That typically, one runs to mom,
one runs to me and

37
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.090
they're like, hey, so and so hit me and
you need to take care of it.

38
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.334
Similar thing here where
it's this was selected,

39
00:03:04.334 --> 00:03:07.132
you do what you want with it,
I don't care.

40
00:03:07.132 --> 00:03:10.276
I just wanna let you
know that this happened.

41
00:03:10.276 --> 00:03:14.942
And so we signified these DOM events up to

42
00:03:14.942 --> 00:03:19.450
the parent component using outputs.

43
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.480
And so
if we go to the course list component,

44
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.850
we can generate these
custom events using output.

45
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.810
And so notice I've imported
this as well and I'm going to

46
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.140
create an output event or
an event called selected.

47
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.440
And now what I have to do here
is this is an event emitter.

48
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.088
And so I need to instantiate
it as an event emitter.

49
00:03:48.088 --> 00:03:54.750
So, I'm gonna show you something that
is embarrassed me many, many times.

50
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.729
Don't make this mistake.

51
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.920
If you hit event emitter, and

52
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.520
you get this auto import,
notice it's coming from protractor.

53
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.080
The reason being is event emitter
apparently exists in more than one place.

54
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.010
So let's try the next one.

55
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.240
Well this is from events.

56
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.720
I don't even know what that is.

57
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.237
And so
really be careful when you're using event

58
00:04:19.237 --> 00:04:23.023
emitter to get the event
emitter from Angular core.

59
00:04:23.023 --> 00:04:27.211
This bit of information did
not cost you anything, but

60
00:04:27.211 --> 00:04:31.852
it will save you a ton of pain
down the road when you're like,

61
00:04:31.852 --> 00:04:35.144
I have this output, it should be working.

62
00:04:35.144 --> 00:04:36.872
I don't understand, event emitter.

63
00:04:36.872 --> 00:04:40.630
Then you realize you've imported
it from somewhere else.

64
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.580
So selected and deleted.

65
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.680
Now what I can do is since I have these

66
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.710
event emitters or these outputs,
I can go back into my template.

67
00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:02.790
And what I can do now is I can convert
this method call to selected, emit.

68
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.876
And so now what I'm doing is
I'm emitting that event up.

69
00:05:06.876 --> 00:05:13.452
I can go deleted dot emit.

70
00:05:13.452 --> 00:05:15.780
There we go.

71
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.496
And so when somebody clicks,
selected emit, and

72
00:05:19.496 --> 00:05:23.700
it's emitting that event for
me to capture.

73
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.550
Now, how do I handle this
in the parent component?

74
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.100
Well, I go to the courses component.html.

75
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.750
And how do we bind to events?

76
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.330
Well, if you remember,
we put in these curly braces or

77
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.540
actually parentheses and
notice it picked up selected.

78
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:53.250
Now on selected,
what I can do is I can go select

79
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.590
course and what I have to do here is.

80
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:06.780
And this is just the way that Angular is,
is when you're binding to an output,

81
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.342
it has a single parameter, and
that is this event object.

82
00:06:11.342 --> 00:06:16.660
And now, in your component class,
you can call it whatever you want,

83
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.100
but just in the template,
it has to be event.

84
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.598
Because I believe it's doing
some mapping under the hood.

85
00:06:22.598 --> 00:06:26.843
I will do deleted, same thing,

86
00:06:26.843 --> 00:06:30.783
deleteCourse($event).

87
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.015
So let's hop over and

88
00:06:39.015 --> 00:06:43.331
see if this worked.

89
00:06:43.331 --> 00:06:49.655
I think it did, but
I really have no way of knowing.

90
00:06:49.655 --> 00:06:53.407
Well, what I could do is this, so

91
00:06:53.407 --> 00:06:57.300
let's go into AP course details.

92
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.232
Well, let me do something real quick.

93
00:07:04.672 --> 00:07:10.117
Here, I don't need an event hook and

94
00:07:10.117 --> 00:07:14.529
I don't need a constructor.

95
00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:19.636
And so
I want everybody to pay attention real

96
00:07:19.636 --> 00:07:25.640
quick to what is in this component class.

97
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.790
I have one input and I have two outputs.

98
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.320
This is a very, very thin component.

99
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.120
And so this is what we would
call a presentation component,

100
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.540
where all this does is
consume data via bindings.

101
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.730
And then if something happens, like
an event, it just delegates it back up.

102
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.497
And so the question that I have,

103
00:07:49.497 --> 00:07:55.364
being that this is fully functional,
How would you unit test this?

104
00:07:58.281 --> 00:08:03.452
Like, what logic in this
component would you test?

105
00:08:03.452 --> 00:08:08.576
And the answer is,
I personally would not unit test

106
00:08:08.576 --> 00:08:13.712
this component because
there's no logic to test.

107
00:08:13.712 --> 00:08:17.200
Now, I would definitely
end to end test it.

108
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:22.920
But what you're doing is by using
component driven architecture and

109
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:28.660
creating these components that all they're
doing is accepting input, emitting output.

110
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.213
Without zero logic,
they're delegating that backup.

111
00:08:32.213 --> 00:08:38.503
You create these ultra portable,
ultra stable components.

112
00:08:38.503 --> 00:08:43.183
And so I would say this is the difference
between like a platter hard

113
00:08:43.183 --> 00:08:45.953
drive versus a solid state hard drive.

114
00:08:45.953 --> 00:08:49.097
A platter hard drive,
you slam the table and your heads skip and

115
00:08:49.097 --> 00:08:50.532
you can ruin the hard drive.

116
00:08:50.532 --> 00:08:53.270
A solid state, that doesn't happen.

117
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.064
It's solid state.

118
00:08:54.064 --> 00:08:58.777
And so I see these as being
equivalent of solid state

119
00:08:58.777 --> 00:09:02.623
hard drives in the component ecosystem.

120
00:09:02.623 --> 00:09:06.345
It's really hard to break these
unless of course, Angular breaks or

121
00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:07.702
you put some bad data in.

122
00:09:07.702 --> 00:09:13.720
But assuming the data is correct,
this is a very stable component.

123
00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.950
And so if we now go into our
course details component,

124
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:27.020
let's create an input.

125
00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:31.485
And so from here,
input I'm just gonna call this course.

126
00:09:31.485 --> 00:09:35.416
Okay, from here,

127
00:09:35.416 --> 00:09:41.068
let me guess what I'm gonna

128
00:09:41.068 --> 00:09:46.255
do Course, of course I am.

129
00:09:48.453 --> 00:09:51.883
Gonna go to json, and

130
00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:57.982
then in our course component at HTML,

131
00:09:57.982 --> 00:10:04.060
I'm going to pass in, course.

132
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:08.730
And from here,
we're gonna do selectedCourse.

133
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.014
Oops, selected course.

134
00:10:13.762 --> 00:10:15.414
Very good.

135
00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:20.049
Let's hop into the app and
let's see if I broke something.

136
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.820
Nope, I didn't break it.

137
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.842
So let's step back into here.

138
00:10:27.842 --> 00:10:33.062
And let's do this just for fun.

139
00:10:33.062 --> 00:10:38.198
pre selectedCourse, and
so now you can see like,

140
00:10:38.198 --> 00:10:42.210
I don't know if this even got in here.

141
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:43.240
Let's just check.

142
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.064
So go here.

143
00:10:47.112 --> 00:10:48.010
Back to here.

144
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.630
That actually was working.

145
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.630
I don't think it refreshed.

146
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.342
So if I go here, save.

147
00:10:57.342 --> 00:11:01.086
There we go, no.
Now what's interesting is this component,

148
00:11:01.086 --> 00:11:04.418
even though you can't see really visually,

149
00:11:04.418 --> 00:11:10.270
this component has no idea what's
happening to this component over here.

150
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.830
They are completely
oblivious to each other.

151
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.672
And this is also really, really important.

152
00:11:16.672 --> 00:11:21.004
So let's complete or

153
00:11:21.004 --> 00:11:27.022
let's move this entire thing

154
00:11:27.022 --> 00:11:33.770
into the appropriate template.

155
00:11:39.561 --> 00:11:45.856
What I'm gonna do is,
It says selectedCourse,

156
00:11:45.856 --> 00:11:51.526
I'm going to just change
this to course for a minute.

157
00:11:51.526 --> 00:11:56.425
Now, notice it's saying,
I don't know what save course is, so

158
00:11:56.425 --> 00:12:01.427
I'm just gonna go save or
save courses so I'm just gonna go saved.

159
00:12:01.427 --> 00:12:05.694
Actually, we'll do saved.emit.

160
00:12:05.694 --> 00:12:11.626
And down here,
we're going to go cancel that emit.

161
00:12:11.626 --> 00:12:17.120
But those don't exist,
but they will exist.

162
00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.836
So we're gonna go here.

163
00:12:18.836 --> 00:12:24.089
Output, and we're

164
00:12:24.089 --> 00:12:29.342
gonna go saved = new

165
00:12:29.342 --> 00:12:33.977
EventEmitter and

166
00:12:33.977 --> 00:12:40.635
Output canceled = new.

167
00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:41.560
That's what I did there.

168
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:43.912
That's bad.

169
00:12:43.912 --> 00:12:46.845
That's how you get burnt cuz
that would have broken that.

170
00:12:48.753 --> 00:12:52.070
So there we go.

171
00:12:56.094 --> 00:12:58.478
All right.

172
00:13:02.316 --> 00:13:08.140
And possibly, this may work.

173
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.160
I hope it's canceled.

174
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.300
Let me iron that up.

175
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:16.430
I'm not seeing any red,
I'm feeling pretty good about this.

176
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:17.730
Let's give this a shot.

177
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.120
So at least the form is rendering.

178
00:13:23.916 --> 00:13:25.050
Look at this.

179
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.548
And if I go canceled,

180
00:13:28.548 --> 00:13:33.971
that didn't work because I
haven't hooked up the output yet.

181
00:13:33.971 --> 00:13:39.787
So let's go back here into
our course details component,

182
00:13:39.787 --> 00:13:47.156
or rather sorry, our course component and
let's wire up these outputs.

183
00:13:57.163 --> 00:14:01.084
So we'll go here, and, saved.

184
00:14:07.306 --> 00:14:10.925
Save course and
we're gonna do $event, just so

185
00:14:10.925 --> 00:14:13.765
we get the secret handshake correct.

186
00:14:13.765 --> 00:14:18.131
And we'll go canceled.

187
00:14:21.813 --> 00:14:24.981
We'll just do canceled, so

188
00:14:24.981 --> 00:14:30.010
you don't have to send
a parameter through.

189
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.349
All right, let's go back.

190
00:14:33.977 --> 00:14:37.547
Cancel, cancel, here, submit.

191
00:14:40.284 --> 00:14:41.586
Very good.
