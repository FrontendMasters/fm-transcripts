00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.290
Now the challenge that I would like for

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.040
everybody to do is,
if we go back to our home component.

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.380
What we have here is these
courseLessons array.

4
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.360
And so, what I wanna see happen is,
challenge.

5
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:32.650
Step one is, I would like you
to create a lessons service.

6
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.757
I'm gonna give you a hint, n gg,

7
00:00:38.757 --> 00:00:42.940
shared/services/lessons.

8
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.132
I will do that with the D flag for
a dry run.

9
00:00:46.132 --> 00:00:52.301
Step two is, add the lessons

10
00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:57.448
service to app module.

11
00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:05.190
Step three is inject lessons

12
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.332
service into home component.

13
00:01:11.332 --> 00:01:19.183
And then step four is, Consume or

14
00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:24.006
move lessons to service and

15
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:28.207
consume in component.

16
00:01:28.207 --> 00:01:32.185
All right, I'll push this back up as well.

17
00:01:35.937 --> 00:01:39.423
&gt;&gt; Since the generator
is provided in root,

18
00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:45.010
we shouldn't have to put the service
in the provider, should we?

19
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.660
&gt;&gt; I think you can get away with it.

20
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.930
So typically, I will just do that.

21
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.130
So, I think you should try it and
let me know.

22
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.020
&gt;&gt; The first one worked.

23
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.150
I don't know if there's a reason why.

24
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.520
&gt;&gt; So one thing that you can do is,
you'll notice when you generate it.

25
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.610
Yeah, so the question is,
when you generate your component,

26
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.365
it does provided for root.

27
00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:16.660
So, if we hop over to this component,
we'll see.

28
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.600
And so what this does is this will go
ahead and add it to your root module.

29
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.790
And so, you could get away,
without adding it to your module.

30
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.946
But typically, what I will do,
because there are cases where

31
00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:39.413
you don't wanna make a service
available to your root component.

32
00:02:39.413 --> 00:02:44.200
But you want to essentially keep it at,
maybe a lazy loaded module level.

33
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.140
And so, just for the sake of exercise,
because you could get away with it,

34
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.090
is I do want you to add
this to your app module.

35
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.520
So, if it's provided in route,
do you need to do it?

36
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.210
No, but in terms of,
sometimes in a subcomponent.

37
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.330
And so, this is where, for instance,
I'm on a very, very large application for

38
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.190
a Fortune 100 Company, and everything
is separated into lines of business.

39
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.990
And so, if I have a service that's
specific to that line of business,

40
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.050
I do not want to use provided in root.

41
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.060
Because I don't want to make it
available to everything else.

42
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.570
And so therefore,
I manually will add it into the provider.

43
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.720
So, that's a very good question,
is if you have provided in root,

44
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.220
do you need to add it into
the providers of the module?

45
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.930
The answer is no, but
I want to do it both ways.

46
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.370
So that you understand, or

47
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.142
that you see that, this is where you would
do it, if you're not providing root.

48
00:03:44.142 --> 00:03:47.240
Because there are going to be cases
you're not going to want to do that.

49
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.400
So, do you need to add this to providers,
not necessarily,

50
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.760
but for this case, I want you to
do it to get the muscle memory.
