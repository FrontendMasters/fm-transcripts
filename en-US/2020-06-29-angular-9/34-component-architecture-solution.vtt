00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.947
So welcome back.

2
00:00:01.947 --> 00:00:07.516
And let's see the solution for our
component driven architecture challenge.

3
00:00:11.338 --> 00:00:17.960
So let me hop into the command line and
what I'm going to do is,

4
00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.444
ng g c and,

5
00:00:27.814 --> 00:00:30.405
And I'm gonna call this lessons-list.

6
00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:34.643
Let's do, I think it's module,

7
00:00:34.643 --> 00:00:40.935
I'm just trying to remember
from memory .ts-d.

8
00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:44.169
There we go, so I'll just highlight this.

9
00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:51.985
So everybody can see this real quick,
ng g c lessons/lessons-list.

10
00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:55.491
The module is =app.module.ts,
and we did the dry flag,.

11
00:00:55.491 --> 00:00:57.071
I'm gonna push this up.

12
00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:57.802
Here we go.

13
00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:04.205
Boom, all right, so
if we hop into our code,

14
00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:08.810
now what I should have
is lessons/lessons-list.

15
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.900
So I went ahead and
did this as a subdirectory.

16
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.077
I imagine at some point somebody would
actually build out a lessons feature,

17
00:01:15.077 --> 00:01:15.729
all right?

18
00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.601
So from here,
the first thing that I'm going

19
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:25.729
to do is I'm going back
into my home component,

20
00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.517
the template and
I'm going to just chop this all out.

21
00:01:31.517 --> 00:01:36.124
And instead,
I'm going to just go app-lessons-list, and

22
00:01:36.124 --> 00:01:38.170
I'm going to render this.

23
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.110
Let me just save this real quick,
and let's see what happens.

24
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.920
All right, lessons-list works, ta-da.

25
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.869
Back into our lessons-list component here,
I'm just going to paste

26
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.420
the first card, and
I'm gonna delete the second one.

27
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.391
And what do we have here?

28
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:08.591
So we have title,
obviously that has nothing to do with

29
00:02:08.591 --> 00:02:13.692
our selected lesson, but
we do have courseLessons.

30
00:02:13.692 --> 00:02:17.904
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
change that to lessons, and

31
00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:22.020
now we have a couple things
that we need to add to this.

32
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.670
So again, if your brain is working
ahead of me, I applaud you.

33
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.710
We'll go here, we did an input.

34
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.070
First and foremost, we need lessons.

35
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.022
We also need an output.

36
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.833
Which is selected = new

37
00:02:41.833 --> 00:02:48.582
Event There we go.

38
00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:55.120
EventEmitter and this is a very, very,

39
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.500
very thin component.

40
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.685
One thing I do as well,
I feel like this might be a plugin, but

41
00:03:03.685 --> 00:03:09.105
a lot of times I'll just organize inputs,
organize imports.

42
00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:13.184
And I'll think about it
just kind of exist, but,

43
00:03:16.812 --> 00:03:20.900
The plugin for that,
I believe is, real quick,

44
00:03:25.824 --> 00:03:30.274
Have a Ts import, the ability to do that.

45
00:03:37.696 --> 00:03:42.495
Maybe not, so just chop out everything
I said in post, I take it back.

46
00:03:42.495 --> 00:03:43.815
That might be baked into VS code,

47
00:03:43.815 --> 00:03:48.635
but I like to organize my imports
to make it nice and tight.

48
00:03:48.635 --> 00:03:52.027
So back into the template,

49
00:03:52.027 --> 00:03:58.076
we're gonna go selected.emit and
there we go.

50
00:03:58.076 --> 00:04:02.850
So now what we need to do
is in our lessons-list,

51
00:04:06.294 --> 00:04:13.261
We need to bind to this, so
we'll put in courseLessons,

52
00:04:13.261 --> 00:04:21.113
and then from here we'll take
(selected) = we break this up.

53
00:04:26.186 --> 00:04:30.746
SelectLesson, and we'll go ($event).

54
00:04:36.932 --> 00:04:44.010
And, Again,
how do we know this is working?

55
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.136
Well, let me just,

56
00:04:55.946 --> 00:04:58.716
I think it is selectedLesson,

57
00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:03.942
I'll pull this down in just
a second out of the component.

58
00:05:03.942 --> 00:05:07.587
currentLesson, so there we go.

59
00:05:07.587 --> 00:05:12.395
Let me save this back into the template,
all right?

60
00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:17.633
Now we can see that we have inputs,
outputs, and it is rendering.

61
00:05:17.633 --> 00:05:20.117
There we go.

62
00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.680
So Ashwin had a really good question.

63
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.480
Instead of using object.assign in
the child component, can we use the spread

64
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.430
operator in the parent component
when setting data to the child?

65
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.155
That's kind of two questions actually.

66
00:05:46.155 --> 00:05:49.040
So one, can you use the spread operator?

67
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.960
Totally, so I've seen that,
occasionally I will use it.

68
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.120
What I do prefer, though,
is to encapsulate

69
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.355
that the copying or the cloning of
that object to the child component.

70
00:06:04.355 --> 00:06:10.290
And so what you wanna do is you don't
want to burden the parent component with

71
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.780
having to know the internal implementation
details of the child component.

72
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.370
And so the answer is, could you do it?

73
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.540
Yes, you could.

74
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.090
But I would say using the spread operator,
totally fine.

75
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.997
More importantly, though,

76
00:06:23.997 --> 00:06:27.822
I think you should clone
the object in the child component.

77
00:06:27.822 --> 00:06:29.394
Because if you don't,

78
00:06:29.394 --> 00:06:33.560
then any parent component that
uses that is now responsible for

79
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.996
knowing the internal implementation
details of how that child component works.

80
00:06:38.996 --> 00:06:43.689
And so you want to really kind of create
that nice encapsulation around that.

81
00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:47.060
And so that's why I would say,
those are kind of two separate things.

82
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.730
But remember, you wanna keep things in a
place that it doesn't create more work or

83
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.460
more questions down the road.

84
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.920
So hopefully, that made sense.

85
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.915
So this is the solution for
this challenge.

86
00:07:00.915 --> 00:07:06.040
Let me make sure I did not miss anything,
there we go, all right.
