&gt;&gt; Mike: Lets look at a short
exercise involving @extend.

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.595
Keep in mind, placeholders work very
similar to classes in terms of how

3
00:00:10.595 --> 00:00:16.560
@extend works and how it should work and
how you would think it works.

4
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.620
So we want to have a very
similar outcome as exercise one.

5
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.110
Except what I have done
here is I have placed

6
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.630
buttons at the bottom of the exercise.

7
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.360
One of which has just
the raw btn class on it, and

8
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.940
I want no styles that directly affect btn.

9
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.740
So what we want is to basically
end up with the primary and

10
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.910
secondary button classes,
being sort of free standing.

11
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.800
And their whole idea of being based
on this, like base button class,

12
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.550
that should be completely
handled in the SASS later or

13
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.480
it should never make its way into the CSS,
right?

14
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.650
So you're gonna start with
making btn a placeholder and

15
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.890
extend primary and secondary from that and
start to then get the test to pass
