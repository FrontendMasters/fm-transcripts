00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.753
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I'd like to now, kind
of jump into this project that I've had

2
00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:06.650
everyone check out, and
show you how it works.

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:13.258
So I'm gonna switch over to my code here.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

4
00:00:13.258 --> 00:00:18.242
let's see,
make sure we've got everything ready.

5
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.319
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So, what I've had you check

6
00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:30.580
out is a project that has
a folder in it called Exercises.

7
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.284
And if you open that folder up, you'll see
that we have, I believe, 11 folders here,

8
00:00:36.284 --> 00:00:41.627
each of which corresponds to like a little
task that we're gonna go through today.

9
00:00:41.627 --> 00:00:44.833
So these iter are basically
separate programs and

10
00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:48.569
the way that you'll fire them up is,
let me make sure I kill

11
00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:53.341
the one that's already running.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I should

12
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:54.730
refresh this, good.

13
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.227
So the way you'll fire
them up is we're gonna go,

14
00:00:58.227 --> 00:01:02.990
I'll get rid of my sidebar run -e,
and then you move the exercise.

15
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.871
And at the bottom at each of these
exercise instructions I'm gonna give you,

16
00:01:07.871 --> 00:01:12.226
there'll be a command at the bottom
that will start with run dash e and

17
00:01:12.226 --> 00:01:13.630
then a name.

18
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.216
So in this case we're
gonna start with nesting.

19
00:01:17.216 --> 00:01:21.036
And you'll see a banner that says,
we've started this exercise,

20
00:01:21.036 --> 00:01:24.610
and you can go and
view your app at localhost, colon 3000.

21
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.460
So if you go into a browser and
view that, you should start to

22
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.376
see something on the screen.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

23
00:01:34.376 --> 00:01:37.820
what you're gonna be left
with here are some tests.

24
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.099
I've written a mini CSS
testing framework for

25
00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:48.573
the purpose of this workshop and
it essentially finds the elements and

26
00:01:48.573 --> 00:01:54.280
asserts that the styles of
them are where they should be.

27
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.800
If you've followed
the instructions as appropriate.

28
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.601
Sometimes you'll find that
I don't explicitly tell

29
00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:02.521
you what to do in the instructions for
the exercise, but

30
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:05.710
you'll find that the styles
are asking you to do something.

31
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.590
Like the background of something
should be a particular color.

32
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.548
So if we look at the way this looks,
this is an example of a failing test.

33
00:02:14.548 --> 00:02:20.503
It's saying that Instead of in jQuery
select or style, it looked for

34
00:02:20.503 --> 00:02:26.562
this element and then expected it to
have a left padding value of ten and

35
00:02:26.562 --> 00:02:30.486
instead it found a left
padding value of six.

36
00:02:30.486 --> 00:02:34.133
So, what's you're gonna do
is work to pass these tests.

37
00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:38.145
If you look in the exercises folder and
open one of these up,

38
00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:42.490
let's open up nesting,
you'll see that you have two folders.

39
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.274
The public folder is what
your browser is reading, so

40
00:02:46.274 --> 00:02:51.420
that's gonna include an html file and
the css that your Sass generates.

41
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.527
The source file,
that's where you're gonna find your Sass.

42
00:02:57.527 --> 00:03:02.694
If you've installed the Chrome LiveReload
plugin, which is a really quick install.

43
00:03:02.694 --> 00:03:06.212
If you Google Chrome LiveReload plugin.

44
00:03:06.212 --> 00:03:12.830
If you have that installed, you should be
able to change your SAS and save the file.

45
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.730
And immediately see, those ramifications
pop up as you make those changes.

46
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.641
I had mine off, I'm gonna turn it back on.

47
00:03:23.641 --> 00:03:28.020
So I just saved and you can see that
it went green and here it goes back.

48
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.369
So this is a really nice way that
you can kinda have, the tests and

49
00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:35.648
the app running and just work on your SaS
and just be, every time you save the file,

50
00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:37.723
you'll see that more test had passed.

51
00:03:37.723 --> 00:03:42.579
Some of the colors that you've applied
have now been applied in the buttons

52
00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.130
that are here and so on.

53
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.630
Does anyone have a question
about how this works?

54
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.434
All right, feel free to put your hand
up if you run into trouble here and

55
00:03:52.434 --> 00:03:54.983
with that let's look at
the instructions for

56
00:03:54.983 --> 00:04:01.426
our first exercise
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So what we're

57
00:04:01.426 --> 00:04:05.380
trying to build is the thing I'm showing
you on the right hand of the screen here.

58
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.540
We're trying to build some buttons
where we have a primary button,

59
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.442
a secondary button that sort of
jumps out less in terms of color.

60
00:04:15.442 --> 00:04:19.190
And they both have styling for
their disabled states.

61
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.030
So, the buttons must have 10px
padding on left and right.

62
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.980
2 pixels on the top and bottom.

63
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.440
There's some requirements for
the colors of the border.

64
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.990
And the colors of the backgrounds.

65
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.972
These, so the way that the classes
should end up being applied,

66
00:04:36.972 --> 00:04:40.750
is you should have both the button
class and button primary.

67
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.887
So this is sort of following
the Twitter Bootstrap convention.

68
00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:49.371
Where button should have, teh btn should
have the structure of the button,

69
00:04:49.371 --> 00:04:51.782
the padding and stuff like that.

70
00:04:51.782 --> 00:04:54.492
And then button primary
should have colors,

71
00:04:54.492 --> 00:04:57.840
things that distinguish
primary from secondary.

72
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.424
They should go in the primary and
secondary classes.

73
00:05:00.424 --> 00:05:03.069
And then finally, just for now,

74
00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:08.740
when you disable a button using
the colon disabled pseudo-selector,

75
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.670
and you can search for
that if you've never seen that before.

76
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:21.060
The opacity of that button
should decrease to 50% or 0.0/5.

77
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.820
And all the tests that are in place they
should steer you towards this result so

78
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.005
you have a bunch of really
test waiting for you there.

79
00:05:28.005 --> 00:05:31.597
So I'm gonna give everyone
ten minutes to complete this,

80
00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:35.205
and please let me know if you
have problems with the setup.

81
00:05:35.205 --> 00:05:41.427
I will do my best to unstick you.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Like

82
00:05:41.427 --> 00:05:44.665
that plugin you were just talking about,

83
00:05:44.665 --> 00:05:48.564
was that the CSS triggers?
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Right, so

84
00:05:48.564 --> 00:05:54.250
let me be unambiguous about that.

85
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.214
So the CSS Triggers plugin
is a nice one to have.

86
00:05:58.214 --> 00:06:01.108
This is the one that I was
referring to specifically.

87
00:06:01.108 --> 00:06:03.490
It's called LiveReload.

88
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.470
It's a really popular plugin.

89
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.456
All it does is it sets up a web socket,
and whenever you save a file,

90
00:06:10.456 --> 00:06:13.770
the browser is told
that it should refresh.

91
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.870
This is optional.

92
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.630
It's what's gonna give you
the auto refreshing capability.

93
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.400
You don't need this, but
it is quite nice to have.
