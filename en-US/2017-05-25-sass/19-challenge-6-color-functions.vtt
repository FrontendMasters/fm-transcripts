00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.205
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We are going to use
mixins and passing arguments to

2
00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:10.020
mixins to build on our
idea of theming buttons.

3
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.300
But we're going to create a combination
of buttons that fit a particular theme.

4
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.265
So like, we want buttons that
go together in a particular way.

5
00:00:21.265 --> 00:00:25.754
Now one way of picking colors that
go together involves basically

6
00:00:25.754 --> 00:00:29.926
what looks like this peace sign
on the color that wheel here.

7
00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:31.510
Where we pick one color and

8
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.790
then go 180 degrees hue rotation across
the color wheel for a complimentary color.

9
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.880
And then we have sort of two
wings that spread out from

10
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.000
that 180 degree color
at a particular angle.

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.330
And those can either spread out,
or come back.

12
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.330
That is a parameter that we can tune.

13
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.580
So if you've ever gone to like
a color scheme generator,

14
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.390
oftentimes they'll give you an option for

15
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.860
a four point color scheme,
like four different colors to pick.

16
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.150
And this is essentially like the placement
of the various colors on the wheel.

17
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:09.710
So I want us to generate a mixin
that allows us to apply a class

18
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.429
around our group of buttons,
where that particular theme is applied.

19
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.776
And there are three arguments that
this mixin is gonna take in, and

20
00:01:19.776 --> 00:01:23.060
they there are the three
values you see on this.

21
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.030
Two of them are values you
see here on this color wheel.

22
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.850
One of them is that rotation away
from the primary color, right.

23
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.750
So that's gonna give you the color
from bottom primary to bottom other,

24
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.550
that's the hue adjustment there.

25
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.185
And same goes on the other side.

26
00:01:38.185 --> 00:01:40.124
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So fixed degree number?

27
00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:44.717
&gt;&gt; Mike North: It'll be a degree number,
but it'll be a variable, so

28
00:01:44.717 --> 00:01:48.349
you define that angle
as part of your theme.

29
00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:50.344
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: The primary color,

30
00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:56.630
that's essentially gonna rotate this
whole peace sign around the color wheel.

31
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.990
So we could start with like magenta
as a our primary color here.

32
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.380
Or we could rotate it up and
say like, red is our primary color,

33
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.830
that's gonna be a color,
that's the type of that variable.

34
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.274
And then, finally, one of the instructions
here is that the nonprimary buttons

35
00:02:10.274 --> 00:02:12.980
should, sorry about that,
the nonprimary buttons should

36
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.280
be darkened relative to the primary
button by darken percent.

37
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.967
So that is the third part of this theme.

38
00:02:22.967 --> 00:02:26.161
And I'll show you what that looks like but

39
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:30.186
all of the instructions
should be here on the slide.

40
00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:34.360
And they should all have accompanying
tests that you need to code to pass.

41
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.360
So I'm just gonna open up the starting
point for this exercise and

42
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.470
make sure that everyone's clear
as to where we kick things off.

43
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.797
So if we open up,
sorry what did I call this one?

44
00:02:47.797 --> 00:02:51.963
Functions, if we open up functions and

45
00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:59.546
look at the app.scss you can see
that I've created three themes here.

46
00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:03.680
And I'm using optional arguments here.

47
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.409
So I'm not always passing all
three values along, right.

48
00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.472
So in this case I'm specifying
a primary color and

49
00:03:11.472 --> 00:03:16.420
a hue rotation falling back
to a darkened percent of 20%.

50
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you
say that one more time?

51
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.780
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So this first theme here,
here's my primary color.

52
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:29.380
It's 399 here's the angle which the two
colors on the wings of the peace sign,

53
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.520
those are 100 degrees out from
the primary color on either side.

54
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.560
And then if we look at the theme mix
in here I'm falling back to a default

55
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.570
darken percent cuz I'm not passing
that third argument at all.

56
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.620
Right, so you've got some default
arguments to work with here.

57
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.400
What you're gonna end up with in
the end is if we look at our HTML.

58
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.255
We've got several buttons
here like four flavors and

59
00:03:55.255 --> 00:03:57.929
then two of them you have
your disabled variance.

60
00:03:57.929 --> 00:04:01.334
Just so that we don't go having
tons of buttons on the screen.

61
00:04:01.334 --> 00:04:05.230
But we're wrapping them in theme-1,
theme-2, and theme-3.

62
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.150
So you're gonna define rules that
are like for buttons inside theme-1,

63
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.330
they should be these colors, here's the
primary color, here's the secondary color.

64
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.460
And we wanna define them in such a way
that all of that work is done inside

65
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.375
these mixins.

66
00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:24.056
Keep in mind, just as we were doing
when we started working with mixins,

67
00:04:24.056 --> 00:04:28.354
anything that's sort of generalized,
that is not theme specific

68
00:04:28.354 --> 00:04:32.442
you're gonna wanna make sure you
keep it outside of the mixin.

69
00:04:32.442 --> 00:04:36.120
So that those rules which
are sort of non-changing,

70
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.690
non-dependent on the variables, those
are not repeated in the resulting CSS.
