00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.401
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We're going to
go through the solution, or

2
00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:08.503
a solution to the first exercise,
which involves nested selectors.

3
00:00:08.503 --> 00:00:11.260
So we're dealing with nesting and scoping.

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.390
So what I have here on my screen,
let me bump my font up just a little bit.

5
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.590
This is the starting point for
this exercise and

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.830
let me just refresh here cuz my
server is not running right now.

7
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.293
The way we would start this exercise up
and this is the same way we're gonna be

8
00:00:28.293 --> 00:00:32.297
doing things all day, just changing
the name of the exercise here.

9
00:00:32.297 --> 00:00:36.340
We're gonna do ./run-E,
E for exercise, and

10
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.620
then the name of the exercise,
so this one is nesting.

11
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.370
And you should get a little banner saying,
we're doing nesting in Parent Selectors.

12
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.090
And it's telling you that the app
is running on local host 3000.

13
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.860
So if we go to that URL
in our browser over here,

14
00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.980
we'll see the starting point for
our exercise is all ready waiting for us.

15
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.830
I have installed my LiveReload plugin.

16
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.240
And it's a little difficult to see.

17
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.283
But, there's a button in Chrome, where
this thing can be toggled on and off.

18
00:01:12.283 --> 00:01:17.859
So, if you've installed it, and
you're not seeing the refreshing behavior,

19
00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:23.189
It's the difference between the little
tiny box in the icon being outlined or

20
00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.661
filled in, that's on versus off.

21
00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:27.602
So I have mine on right now, so

22
00:01:27.602 --> 00:01:33.710
you're going to see me just saying my SCSS
file and then app should be reloading.

23
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.358
Just to recap as to how things work here,
the structure of the exercise.

24
00:01:39.358 --> 00:01:44.230
You should need to touch anything
in the public folder directly.

25
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.330
The useful thing to look at in here,

26
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.630
is you can take a look at
the CSS output from your Sass.

27
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.190
And in fact, I'm gonna a split screen
here so that we can write some Sass and

28
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.470
I don't need my terminal here anymore.

29
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.980
We can write some sass and see what the
resulting CSS looks like on the bottom.

30
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.803
So we'll just leave that down here.

31
00:02:07.803 --> 00:02:10.457
So I want to close my public folder and

32
00:02:10.457 --> 00:02:14.406
I'm gonna just be working in source,
sass app.css.

33
00:02:14.406 --> 00:02:17.230
This is a file that was
already there waiting for us.

34
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.948
So we can get started.

35
00:02:18.948 --> 00:02:22.257
And let me make sure
the live reload works.

36
00:02:22.257 --> 00:02:26.290
And it does, so we've gone to a different
red and back to a different one.

37
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.947
We can go white and make it disappear.

38
00:02:28.947 --> 00:02:30.668
Great.

39
00:02:30.668 --> 00:02:34.742
So, we'll just leave that there, and
start looking at the requirements.

40
00:02:34.742 --> 00:02:39.362
So the first thing is that my tests
are telling me that I want my left

41
00:02:39.362 --> 00:02:41.297
padding to be 10 pixels.

42
00:02:41.297 --> 00:02:47.920
And, I know that I want my
top-bottom padding to be 2 pixels.

43
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.590
On button, button primary.

44
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.405
And in this case,
we described the b t n class or

45
00:02:55.405 --> 00:02:59.970
the size of this button should be defined.

46
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.480
There are many ways to
solve this exercise.

47
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.550
I always forget which
order these things go in.

48
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.730
2 pixels, then pixels,
look like that took.

49
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.490
So this is the top bottom padding and
this is the left right padding.

50
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.108
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: Do you think
it's better to just declare

51
00:03:19.108 --> 00:03:22.950
them exclusively cuz you forget, I forget?

52
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.240
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yes.

53
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.950
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Personally,

54
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.370
I like them to declare them
specifically in my code.

55
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.890
I'm just short on vertical screen
real estate here and I wanna-

56
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.219
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: Okay Just wondering.

57
00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:37.520
&gt;&gt; Mike North: But you're right,
I do often do those rules one at a time.

58
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.305
As far as I know, there's no
detriment in terms of performance,

59
00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:47.970
there's no downside to doing it that way,
there's less of a guessing game.

60
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.700
So the next thing is we need
a border radius of 2 pixels,

61
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.839
that's what my next test is telling me,
it's saying currently it's zero pixels.

62
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:58.709
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Thankfully,

63
00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.324
we are in an age where we probably
don't have worry about vendor prefixes,

64
00:04:03.324 --> 00:04:07.370
doing them special in Mozilla and
WebKit and IE border radius'.

65
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.843
Border style solid, so we're gonna

66
00:04:12.843 --> 00:04:17.790
do a 1 pixel solid C46 border.

67
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.395
This is one that I can remember,

68
00:04:19.395 --> 00:04:22.380
because it's not sensitive to
the order of the arguments.

69
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.611
It just takes a list, and it knows
one of them is like a border type.

70
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:30.250
One of them is a number,
the one makes a lot the one of the color.

71
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.230
And they can sort it all out internally.

72
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.947
We'll look at how we can define
our own things to do it later on,

73
00:04:38.947 --> 00:04:43.846
Now, I have some errors that have
to do with background colours.

74
00:04:43.846 --> 00:04:49.072
So, I'm gonna start defining rules that
apply specifically to the primary and

75
00:04:49.072 --> 00:04:53.760
secondary button classes and
I'm gonna use the Parent Selector here.

76
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.010
Let me get rid of my sidebar here.

77
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.670
I'll use the Parent Selector, btn-primary.

78
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.080
So if I had done this, I would have been
describing styles that apply to things

79
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.504
with a button primary class that are found
inside things with a button class.

80
00:05:10.504 --> 00:05:13.365
That's not what I want.

81
00:05:13.365 --> 00:05:17.187
So here we're gonna say
background color C46,

82
00:05:17.187 --> 00:05:21.191
not a coincidence that I gave
you a hint up at the top,

83
00:05:21.191 --> 00:05:26.560
gave you that color so you don't have
to keep flipping back and forth.

84
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.359
We know there's a secondary color as well.

85
00:05:29.359 --> 00:05:32.469
This one I will have to flip back for.

86
00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:35.415
Keep forgetting that one.

87
00:05:35.415 --> 00:05:36.282
All right.

88
00:05:36.282 --> 00:05:41.993
And now we've got sorry, secondary.

89
00:05:41.993 --> 00:05:44.060
Now we should be on font colors.

90
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.924
So, it wants the button
primary class to have

91
00:05:48.924 --> 00:05:54.090
a white,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Background or

92
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.330
white font color.

93
00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:04.883
We can just do this and
then black for the other.

94
00:06:04.883 --> 00:06:06.222
And then finally,

95
00:06:06.222 --> 00:06:11.085
we have to deal with opacity in
the case of the button being disabled.

96
00:06:11.085 --> 00:06:15.072
So we're gonna use what's
called a pseudo selector here.

97
00:06:15.072 --> 00:06:16.940
And these all begin with a colon.

98
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:23.290
And this has to do with like a state
that this particular button is in.

99
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.001
So other pseudo selectors
include like hover,

100
00:06:27.001 --> 00:06:33.412
you can change the hover styling of a
particular thing if we'd done this, right?

101
00:06:33.412 --> 00:06:39.133
So we are gonna just deal with disabled
opacity, 0.5, and we should be done.

102
00:06:39.133 --> 00:06:41.948
And we are.

103
00:06:41.948 --> 00:06:48.431
So this is use of the parent selector,
little bit of use of pseudo selectors,

104
00:06:48.431 --> 00:06:54.146
and if we look at our resulting CSS I
wanna point out a couple things.

105
00:06:54.146 --> 00:07:00.012
First off, we've done a decent
job of not redundantly defining

106
00:07:00.012 --> 00:07:05.889
these styles in our button secondary and
button primary class.

107
00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:11.063
If we had done something like this,

108
00:07:11.063 --> 00:07:14.343
like that, and this.

109
00:07:14.343 --> 00:07:17.750
Our style sheet would in
fact be like a lot bigger.

110
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.790
Just because we end up with these rules
being defined over and over again.

111
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:27.825
We've got two places where we've got
a two pixel border radius, right?

112
00:07:27.825 --> 00:07:32.960
So when we're thinking about like
what belongs in that sort of base

113
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.369
class if you will versus what belongs
in those two specific primary and

114
00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:41.498
secondary sort of flags that we flip on.

115
00:07:41.498 --> 00:07:46.705
It's always going to be as
close as we can get to things

116
00:07:46.705 --> 00:07:53.780
that are strictly pertinent to
that particular state, right.

117
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.153
And nothing extra, so anything that's
redundant we try to move out, so

118
00:07:58.153 --> 00:08:00.750
that it's defined once in our output CSS.

119
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.440
And that's the solution to this.

120
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.032
Yes, questions.

121
00:08:04.032 --> 00:08:07.032
&gt;&gt; Audience 2: From online
there's a question from Ivan, and

122
00:08:07.032 --> 00:08:10.340
he used the Parent Selector
in the class declaration

123
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.849
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yes.

124
00:08:11.849 --> 00:08:15.310
&gt;&gt; Audience 2: And he's wondering,
is there any difference?

125
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.883
&gt;&gt; Mike North: There is no difference.

126
00:08:16.883 --> 00:08:21.610
I've been spoiling my magic reveal, which
is going to be happening later on today.

127
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:27.916
So, here's what Ivan may have done,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I've

128
00:08:27.916 --> 00:08:30.750
got some beach balling there.

129
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.038
[SOUND] Really fancy use
of the Parent Selector.

130
00:08:33.038 --> 00:08:37.153
Ta dah [LAUGH].

131
00:08:37.153 --> 00:08:41.537
So, we'll make great use of this
when we start working with Bem, but

132
00:08:41.537 --> 00:08:46.452
it's important to realize that you can
put that Parent Selector once in every

133
00:08:46.452 --> 00:08:47.985
selector, only once.

134
00:08:47.985 --> 00:08:50.990
So you couldn't do like this for
example, right.

135
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.770
See how all my styles disappear.

136
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:58.583
I do wanna point out a subtle
difference in the output CSS.

137
00:08:58.583 --> 00:09:01.316
You'll notice that button primary and

138
00:09:01.316 --> 00:09:05.388
secondary are no longer scoped
to that BTN class anymore.

139
00:09:05.388 --> 00:09:08.607
We lost the ability to do that, right?

140
00:09:08.607 --> 00:09:10.991
Now, this is really cool, but

141
00:09:10.991 --> 00:09:15.130
it is not exactly the result
that we were looking for.
