00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.330
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We've come so
far using nesting, the parent selector.

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.940
We've dealt with mixins,
default arguments to mixins.

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.570
We've looked at how we can
pass a block to mixins.

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.000
The next thing we're gonna add,
it's a brand new dimension to Sass, and

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.160
that is the idea of functions.

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.550
This is another thing that
It is not present in CSS,

7
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.250
in anywhere near the form
where we can use it in Sass.

8
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.410
So this is a link you're
gonna wanna bookmark.

9
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.110
And I didn't, it was not
constructive to screenshot every

10
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.880
possible function in Sass, and
to create slides for them.

11
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.190
We're gonna go over ones
that I expect you to use.

12
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.520
But the API docs are have a great
listing that looks just like this.

13
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.820
Where you can see you know what
comes with the language for free.

14
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.250
These are relatively high
performance because they're,

15
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.460
this function is evaluated inside the SASS
compiler which is written in C Right?

16
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.440
And so unlike some of the functions we'll
deal with later that we define ourselves,

17
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.080
these are quite performant and you should
feel comfortable using them broadly.

18
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.800
And just to go through what
these are here, rgb, that's

19
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.550
a color generation function, and this
is something we can already do in CSS.

20
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.750
So, great.

21
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.550
Same with rgba,
it just adds an alpha channel.

22
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.790
Red, green and blue.

23
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.490
Those are functions that will just return

24
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.410
the value of a single
channel of that color.

25
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.510
Only the r value, only the g value,
only the b value.

26
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.660
And we'll use that later.

27
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.049
And then here, we can mix two colors
together with a particular weight.

28
00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.619
And so that'd be like, 50% blue,
50% red equals purple.

29
00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.366
Right, tons of different colors, and

30
00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:55.580
let's go over a couple of
these functions in detail.

31
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.230
The ones that you're going to need for
the exercises you'll work on.

32
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.110
So here's one called adjust hue.

33
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.060
And we have already mentioned the use
of hue when we were doing like

34
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.070
the interpolation example,
where we said like let's output

35
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.360
the hue of green into a comment and
it was 120 degrees.

36
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.390
So what hue means is like
using a color wheel so

37
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.160
that zero degree hue is straight up so

38
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.410
you can see that 120 degrees which would
be sort of down and pointing to the right.

39
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.850
That is in the green area.

40
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.220
And what adjust hue does,
is it takes one color, preserves its

41
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.280
saturation, and its brightness, and
alters the hue by a specific angle.

42
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.580
So you can think of it like
rotating around the color wheel.

43
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.160
In this case, brightness would be going
towards the center of the circle or

44
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.750
away from the circle, right?

45
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.640
All the way in the center to white
no matter which angle you're at.

46
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.780
And then saturation would be a dimension
that's not represented on this

47
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.730
color wheel.

48
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.080
And we would treat the whole
space more like a cylinder or

49
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.270
saturation might come out of the page.

50
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.980
So this is actually a 100% saturation,
that's this slice of the cylinder.

51
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.700
So you see, here we can take 63F,
which is at 225 degrees, and

52
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.420
we can rotate it by 60 degrees, or
the number 60, that would be fine.

53
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.370
You don't have to write the number deg.

54
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.830
I like to, because it's very clear
to developers what's going on here.

55
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.076
Someone who comes across this,

56
00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:34.160
if they momentarily forgot
that this is about a rotation.

57
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.370
Now, that's a queue like that's
what we're dealing with.

58
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.764
And we essentially get something
that is just a circular arc just at

59
00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:47.252
a different angle.
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: Can you use a negative

60
00:03:47.252 --> 00:03:49.680
value for the degrees?
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I believe you can use

61
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.460
a negative value.
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: Right.

62
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.750
&gt;&gt; Audience 2: So it always by default

63
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.840
goes clockwise?
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yes.

64
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.910
&gt;&gt; Audience 2: So if you wanted to go-

65
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:56.500
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Positive values

66
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.480
are clockwise.
&gt;&gt; Audience 2: So

67
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.440
if you wanted to go counter-clockwise,
I was going to ask, negative numbers,

68
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.450
theoretically, how would that work if
you wanted to go the other direction?

69
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.670
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I am blanking as to whether

70
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.790
a negative value would work.

71
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.390
I would expect it to,
otherwise it's 360 minus whatever value.

72
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.130
And you'll need to do that for
this solution.

73
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.568
Either a negative value or a 360 minus.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Color functions we can

74
00:04:22.568 --> 00:04:27.180
build on top of those by darkening or
lightening a color by a percent.

75
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.130
So what I do want you to notice
here is that in this example,

76
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.780
we're taking a blue and
creating a darker blue from it.

77
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.750
The percent is not multiplicative.

78
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.780
So we're taking a color and we are
subtracting 20% from its brightness value.

79
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.261
We are not decreasing it's
brightness value by 20%.

80
00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:52.634
So if we were to start at 80 and
decrease the brightness by 20%,

81
00:04:52.634 --> 00:04:55.381
we would end up at 60, not 64.

82
00:04:55.381 --> 00:05:00.030
16% is 20% of 80.

83
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.132
So we are subtracting 20%.

84
00:05:03.132 --> 00:05:06.989
So if you subtracted a 100%,
you would be a black.

85
00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:12.570
I guess that example would [LAUGH] fit in
both multiplicative and additive cases.

86
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.300
But just keep that in mind that
its a 0 to a 100 scale and

87
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.699
this is subtracting or adding.

88
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:25.220
Same goes with saturation which is on
a 0 to 100 scale and add or subtract.

89
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.840
Saturation has to do with how much of

90
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.730
a color is, how much of a channel
is mixed into a particular color.

91
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.660
So full saturation would be
like very vivid colors, and

92
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.470
no saturation at all would be grey scale,
does that make sense?

93
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.695
You would have to talk to a designer
to get a more eloquent definition of

94
00:05:45.695 --> 00:05:46.200
that term.
