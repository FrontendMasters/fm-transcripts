00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.210
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I hope you had fun
refactoring the plain CSS for

2
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.350
this range selector, trying to get it,
not necessarily as small as possible,

3
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.340
but trying to bring some of the benefits
we get from sass into it so

4
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.920
that it's as maintainable and
as understandable and

5
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.150
concise as we can get it.

6
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.540
So I'm starting out here with all of
this text selected on the right side.

7
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.280
This is the full CSS to style
range components in all browsers.

8
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.290
You may or may not have started
with this already in your file, but

9
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.300
we're just gonna paste it in here so that
we've got the two imports at the top and

10
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.830
then all of that CSS Coming down after
it and then we can put this away.

11
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.300
Looks like I've got my old
solution running there,

12
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.289
we're just going to fire
the new one up with run-e

13
00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.880
range, and it's telling us that on
localhost:3000, we are good to go.

14
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.630
And there it is.

15
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.010
A nicely styled range component.

16
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.360
Now if we look through this,
we can immediately see that first of all,

17
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.150
all of our rules,
everything here is scoped to range.

18
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.300
So what we can do is replace this.

19
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.910
I'm just gonna do a quick find and
replace using an ampersand

20
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.259
here as what I'm replacing it with and
I'll just undo it in this one case.

21
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.750
And bring all of these other rules into
the scope of the range selector here.

22
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.169
It looks like it can't
auto format that's fine.

23
00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.990
All right, let me just fix my.

24
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.990
So we know what we're looking at and we
can see that nothing has changed here, I'm

25
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.030
just gonna make sure my works It in fact
does deliberately broken and fixed again.

26
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.384
So now I am going to start
looking through here for

27
00:02:01.384 --> 00:02:06.262
repeated pieces of code and
thanks for anime breaking my syntax

28
00:02:06.262 --> 00:02:12.080
highlighting that has caught my eye as
a value that is repeated a few times.

29
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.220
Let me get rid of this terminal
we do not need it any more.

30
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.290
And looking a little bit closer
if we collapse this here.

31
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.760
We can see that largely
these blocks are the same.

32
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.000
In fact,
it appears there exactly the same.

33
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.270
So this tells me that probably
want a Mixins or some SAAS.

34
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.790
We use of some sort here.

35
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.500
Just looking through,
this does not look like it's the same.

36
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.480
See all these transparent things here.

37
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.820
All right.

38
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.690
So the first thing we can do is
go to our mixin sections here.

39
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.600
I've got one here called the range thumb,

40
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.490
that might have been
the little hint Hint here.

41
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.810
Let's have a range-track first,
because that's this thing, range-track.

42
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.795
So we'll create that.

43
00:03:06.733 --> 00:03:09.677
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
this is just gonna take in,

44
00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:13.109
&gt;&gt; Mike North: A block

45
00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:17.290
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Something that

46
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.357
looks like this.

47
00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:22.200
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Here's the other one.

48
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.444
I'm not really interested in the content
here cuz I'm going to do this.

49
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.420
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I'm not interested in
the declarations inside these blocks.

50
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.190
Then what I can do is,

51
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.020
wondering what my syntax highlighting
is telling me something is wrong.

52
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.000
It is usual for highlighting to get
a little funky around the main,

53
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.860
I'm sorry vendor specific
pseudo selectors and

54
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.880
tags because they are not part
of the official CSS spec.

55
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.350
So if you've built something that plays
by the rules, sorry to break your hearts.

56
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.770
Browsers don't always play by the rules.

57
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.110
WebKit, in this case, is not.

58
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:15.840
And then now we can import range track and
pass in this whole chunk of style here.

59
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:30.680
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Getting rid of
the specific Mozilla and WebKit stuff.

60
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.820
We have to have parentheses here.

61
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.430
Sorry it's include that's my bad.

62
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.810
Include and where we should be back
to normal let's what's on here.

63
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.885
Let me save this make sure that

64
00:04:49.885 --> 00:04:55.010
everything is up to date.

65
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.680
There it is.

66
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.810
Okay, something's not quite right yet.

67
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.018
Let me look at the output CSS and
see what's wrong.

68
00:05:04.065 --> 00:05:05.650
So, there's our track.

69
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.183
That looks pretty similar to me.

70
00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.489
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let me just check for
an error of some sort.

71
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.560
Refresh.

72
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.856
So we've lost our button some how.

73
00:05:21.856 --> 00:05:28.840
[SOUND] I'm just going

74
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.053
to go back, save.

75
00:05:35.053 --> 00:05:35.553
Okay.

76
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.362
Here.

77
00:05:39.675 --> 00:05:41.203
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Break this stuff out.

78
00:05:43.812 --> 00:05:46.180
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I think I
know what the problem was.

79
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.340
I think I deleted a chunk I
wasn't supposed to delete.

80
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.090
So here is the other one to delete.

81
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.100
Save, alright, and
were exactly where we were.

82
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.750
So effectively we've taken the concept of
there being two bender specific prefixes

83
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.860
for this track, and we've moved it out
into a mix in that is using this content

84
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.170
thing twice, and our output CSS is
going to get the benefit of that.

85
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.510
We can set the width to 100,

86
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.360
that I would typically leave alone here.

87
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.780
Let's see, most range track, this looks
very similar to what we had in here.

88
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.780
I wonder.

89
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:33.100
I thought I had deleted that, I'm sorry
I'm looking at my, css, how to do that.

90
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.290
So, the next thing here is that we have
a color that's used over and over again.

91
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:45.200
This 307, 367 is here to be
used in a couple of places and

92
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.560
we can consider this to be like
dark blue and a right blue.

93
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.188
So, we can break those into variables And
we're actually not using any of these.

94
00:06:57.978 --> 00:07:00.442
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Dark blue is going to be,

95
00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:07.268
&gt;&gt; Mike North: This 307.

96
00:07:10.402 --> 00:07:12.328
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
then the light blue, sorry And

97
00:07:12.328 --> 00:07:16.590
the light blue is going to be this other
shade that's a little bit brighter.

98
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.360
Right.

99
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:31.436
And now we would wanna go through and
just replace this with light blue and

100
00:07:31.436 --> 00:07:39.171
then replace this one
&gt;&gt; Mike North: With darkblue.

101
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:46.800
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Save, and
everything continues to look as it should.

102
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.820
So let me get rid of this
in my terminal again.

103
00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:59.300
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So this box shadow
is popping up in a couple places.

104
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.590
One pixel three times, and

105
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:08.160
again here,
that's the exact same box shadow.

106
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.577
So we can refactor that into a variable
and just call it rain shadow.

107
00:08:17.752 --> 00:08:21.539
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
grab this whole value here.

108
00:08:24.598 --> 00:08:26.930
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Like that,
and then go here.

109
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.766
Do a replace.

110
00:08:34.376 --> 00:08:39.058
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay,
just scan it for other stuff.

111
00:08:41.788 --> 00:08:45.000
&gt;&gt; Mike North: The thumbs
are probably very similar.

112
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.700
So there is range_shadow,
36 pixel height, 16 pixel width,

113
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.720
this is starting to look very Interesting
like it is rather make sense so

114
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.408
we can start to refractor
this out as well.

115
00:08:55.408 --> 00:08:59.198
The content,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

116
00:08:59.198 --> 00:09:03.257
then the other one we'll
probably grab is web kit.

117
00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:06.545
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's see.

118
00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:11.773
Solid, looks like Microsoft
is playing nice with web

119
00:09:11.773 --> 00:09:17.010
standards here and
mirroring what Mozilla is doing.

120
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.710
I'm just eyeballing it here,

121
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:22.680
keeping an eye on the right side
to see if things start to diverge.

122
00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.980
Always good to start with
something that works.

123
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:33.041
And that gives you a chance to sort
of iterate and know if it breaks.

124
00:09:36.104 --> 00:09:39.109
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So range-thumb, and

125
00:09:39.109 --> 00:09:44.200
we'll pass in those as arguments.

126
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.953
So now we can get rid of this.

127
00:09:50.803 --> 00:09:55.410
&gt;&gt; Mike North: This border is used twice.

128
00:09:55.410 --> 00:10:00.260
Twice would not necessarily meet
my threshold for re-factoring out.

129
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.550
Here's a third time.

130
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.871
We could do that, so

131
00:10:06.871 --> 00:10:12.806
range Small border and grab that.

132
00:10:19.843 --> 00:10:23.560
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Room and
now we can go to a place that record.

133
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.954
It's just this repeating pattern over and
over.

134
00:10:29.654 --> 00:10:30.849
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Refactor &gt; Save,

135
00:10:30.849 --> 00:10:36.450
make sure that everything keeps working
the way it's supposed to work, and so on.

136
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:40.932
The slider thumb, I'm just gonna compare
that to the mixin that we have here.

137
00:10:43.848 --> 00:10:46.280
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Sorry,
the mixin that we're using elsewhere.

138
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.600
It doesn't quite look the same.

139
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.590
Yeah, so we could keep following this,

140
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:05.910
we don't have to and I don't want
to take too much time to go on.

141
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:10.500
I saw someone that got it
down to Here's another one.

142
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.550
This is another thumb here.

143
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.930
I'll bother to take this one out but

144
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.640
this qn iterative process that
we can go through for a while.

145
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.640
So we've called this like thumb two or

146
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.420
something and this is gonna be
the web kit and Microsoft flavor.

147
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:31.324
Ms thumb And the other one was up

148
00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:36.070
here we'll get slider thumb.

149
00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.920
Does look very similar.

150
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:46.627
Include range thumb two and use that and

151
00:11:46.627 --> 00:11:50.745
then we can get rid of This down here.

152
00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:01.770
&gt;&gt; Mike North: This right here, dark blue,
light blue, oop, we messed something up.

153
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:10.576
We messed,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yeah,

154
00:12:10.576 --> 00:12:12.890
move that last one didn't work.

155
00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:17.280
So did anybody like from seeing what
I have done so far anyone have other

156
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.380
tips that they did we can certainly
start refactoring variables out.

157
00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:26.969
But is there anything are you able to like
grab 3 or 4 or 5 instances something and

158
00:12:26.969 --> 00:12:34.986
bring it in to a variable
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

159
00:12:34.986 --> 00:12:38.260
I'll provide a couple different
examples of this online.

160
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.045
Oops, sorry.

161
00:12:39.045 --> 00:12:40.350
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE].

162
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.010
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I zoomed in somehow.

163
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:42.810
Thanks electron.

164
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.960
But it is typically an iterative
process that involves

165
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.340
Kind of did this refactoring and
breaking it out into mixins,

166
00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.870
trying to get away from vendor
prefixes as much as you can,

167
00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:02.900
especially when it comes to pseudo
elements and things like that.

168
00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.070
I hope you got to see the sort
of thresholds that I had for

169
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.110
breaking things out into variables.

170
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.240
Like I didn't,
this is a color this is used, but

171
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.900
I don't really see it used elsewhere.

172
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:17.140
So that I might leave as
a color literal in there.

173
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:22.390
I mean if we were planning for large scale
development maybe we would break that out,

174
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:27.210
and if the anticipation was that
this is a foundation we'll build on.

175
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:31.850
But just like Abstracting
too early in code is

176
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:35.390
add on necessary complexity,
same goes with SAAS.

177
00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.000
I should.

178
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Like auto pre-fixer?

179
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.430
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So, yes there's thing
called auto pre-fixer that will add

180
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:48.550
specific prefixes to things like
boarder radiance and stuff like that.

181
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.950
For what we're doing specifically here,

182
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:55.760
these are like, this is private
component DOM that we're styling.

183
00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.220
And so the auto prefixer wouldn't
necessarily help us quite as much here.

184
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:02.810
Yeah.

185
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.955
All right so
I'm gonna call this my solution.

186
00:14:05.955 --> 00:14:11.380
It's not dramatically better than
what we started with, but it is.

187
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:16.610
You can see that we got some of the
mysterious stuff sort of factored out and

188
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.270
we identified things that were shared and
so on.

189
00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.550
And for a complete solution to this,

190
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:25.925
you would want to definitely have
a Firefox that you potentially check.

191
00:14:25.925 --> 00:14:30.720
We're dealing across different browsers
here, so, browser stack might be

192
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.280
a good thing to use where you can see what
this looks like in a old version of IE and

193
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.430
some of these things you
even involve SSH tunneling.

194
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:43.460
Where you can point to local host
using the little browser stack UI and

195
00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:48.110
they'll be able to Access your local host
and don't show what's on your screen.

196
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:53.750
So, I will commit this and there was
no like finish line to the solution,

197
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:58.460
this is sort of a process that we go
through and it's just fun if we can get.

198
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:05.540
So, if you can do better like may be
open up a PR into this branch and

199
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:11.520
I would be happy to recognize those things
as further iterations to this solution.
