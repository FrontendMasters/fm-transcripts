&gt;&gt; Mike North: So, I'm Mike.

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.210
I train developers full-time.

3
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.270
Most of the time,
I am working at LinkedIn, where I am

4
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.040
just doing workshops all the time for
mostly their front end developers.

5
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.970
But, across a wide range
of modern Web topics,

6
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.580
including Sass, and Ember,
and JavaScript fundamentals.

7
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.129
And, soon we'll be getting
into things like TypeScript.

8
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.021
So it's really nice to be able to come
out here and to share some of what I've

9
00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:34.051
built to train these developers
with the broader community.

10
00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:39.280
And today,
we are going to be talking about Sass.

11
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.490
First off,
you're gonna want to download the slides.

12
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:50.350
It's bit.ly/sass-fundamentals just like
that link at the top of the slides there.

13
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.770
The reason is, when we go through
the exercises you will want for, for

14
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.710
back to things that are not
on the screen anymore.
