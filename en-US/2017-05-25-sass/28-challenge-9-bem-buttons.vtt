&gt;&gt; Mike North: So what we're gonna do,

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:07.370
is build upon our broad experience
of building buttons today.

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.730
And this one's a little different,

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.120
in that it has something more
than just text inside the button.

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.144
This is gonna have a price.

6
00:00:16.144 --> 00:00:20.512
And that price is gonna be wrapped
in its own DOM element and

7
00:00:20.512 --> 00:00:25.698
we're gonna consider that to be
an element in the BEM sense, right?

8
00:00:25.698 --> 00:00:30.670
It is a sub piece that has no meaning
outside the context of these one click

9
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.080
checkout buttons.

10
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.860
So what we're gonna do
is use BEM to create

11
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.020
buttons that pass the tests
that are waiting for you.

12
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.890
And make sure that you pay attention
to the fact that button Primary and

13
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.370
Secondary have been changed to class
names that align with the BEM convention.

14
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.090
Those are modifier classes, right?

15
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.640
And so you're gonna see that
the names are a little bit different,

16
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.640
the concepts should be very much the same
as what we've been working on all day.

17
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.070
Just because we've been
practicing this idea and

18
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.930
now we can practice
the convention as well.
