00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.960
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
here is the broad agenda for

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.980
the topics we're going to
cover as they pertain to Sass.

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.537
So first, we're gonna go over
the origins of the library.

4
00:00:13.537 --> 00:00:16.088
You know why it looks the way it looks?

5
00:00:16.088 --> 00:00:19.653
And we're gonna address the fact that
there are two different file types, and

6
00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:22.420
one that we're gonna focus on today and
one that we're not.

7
00:00:23.426 --> 00:00:28.190
And we're gonna go over the basics,
the very basics of how

8
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.110
you can start with a CSS file,
rename it, and

9
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.690
then start to layer on new
behavior as you improve the CSS.

10
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.530
Then we're going to dive
into variables and mixins.

11
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.420
So these are tools you can use
to parameterize your styles.

12
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.910
So if you have a button and you wanna
have like a red, a green, a blue, and

13
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.170
a yellow button,

14
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.280
you shouldn't have to define what that
button looks like over and over again.

15
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.636
In fact, we can kind of design what a
button looks like generically in terms of

16
00:01:01.636 --> 00:01:03.257
a color that we're handed.

17
00:01:03.257 --> 00:01:07.919
And then use that generic definition for
several colors in

18
00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:13.210
order to generate the CSS that
we're looking to generate.

19
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.150
And leave the door open for

20
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.680
generating more buttons of
different colors in the future.

21
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.120
We're gonna go over something
called control flow.

22
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.250
So, if you've done programming before.

23
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.432
If you've worked for
things like ifs, and for-loops, and

24
00:01:29.432 --> 00:01:32.830
iteration, and data structures.

25
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.536
There are these concepts in
the Sass programming language.

26
00:01:37.536 --> 00:01:39.390
In Sass script, right?

27
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.320
Which is what we call this imperative code
that we can write inside a style sheet.

28
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.710
And we'll look at kinda of
some practical use cases for

29
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.600
applying these concepts,
and some situations for

30
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.920
it might not be necessary to sort of jump
in to that extra level of complexity.

31
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.030
So once we kind of establish this baseline
here, we're gonna take a step back and

32
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.918
talk about CSS architecture.

33
00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:11.738
This doesn't retain to Sass directly,
but it is important to

34
00:02:11.738 --> 00:02:17.180
think about different patterns as
to how you can stay organized.

35
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.130
And the type of architecture we're gonna
talk about today is called BEM, B-E-M.

36
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.110
And it's a very popular way of
keeping yourself sorted out so

37
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.670
that you don't collide with styles
between different concerns in your app.

38
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.820
And then finally,
we're gonna finish out today with the most

39
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.780
advanced topic we're gonna cover which is,
defining your own functions in Sass.

40
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.410
So, what we're gonna end up with at
the end is defining a function for

41
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.940
something called relative luminescence.

42
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.680
And that has to do with determining
whether one color is gonna stand out

43
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.300
against another color effectively.

44
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.340
So we'll use that in order to determine,
given the background color of a button,

45
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.330
should the text on the button be black or
white?

46
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.870
Based on whether the visual contrast
is great enough for those two colors.
