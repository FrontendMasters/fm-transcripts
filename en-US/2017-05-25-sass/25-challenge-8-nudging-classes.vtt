&gt;&gt; Mike North: Here's what I
want to do with iteration.

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.090
So has anyone seen CSS classes like
what we have on the right side here?

3
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.570
Little mini, like nudging classes.

4
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.420
So we don't have to like, every time we
need to move a button down in a nav bar,

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.180
we don't have to go in and
explicitly specify the style there.

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.170
We can just declaratively say
bump this down ten pixels.

7
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.460
This is really repetitive CSS to write.

8
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.100
So I want us to see if we can build this

9
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.580
using lists and loops and
potentially maps.

10
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.940
The solution I came up
with Is less than 15 lines

11
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.470
to create what we need to create here.

12
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.419
Here is what I want.

13
00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:54.155
Both margin and padding in five pixel
increments starting at five ending at 25.

14
00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:58.868
That means like MT5,
MT10, MT15, MT20, MT25.

15
00:00:58.868 --> 00:01:02.043
Both for top, left, bottom, right,
and then do the same thing for

16
00:01:02.043 --> 00:01:06.351
padding.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Now this would be really,

17
00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:11.053
really tedious, except that we can
do it in sort of a general way

18
00:01:11.053 --> 00:01:15.492
where we use multiplication,
and iteration, and lists,

19
00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:19.500
and wraps to just build all
of these things as loops.

20
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.060
Probably loops within loops.

21
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.450
So I would advise,
if you're not an everyday programmer,

22
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.130
start with one loop and just try to get
like a set of comments to iterate out

23
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.450
just so you can tell that you're
going from five to ten to 15 to 20.

24
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.490
And then kind of expand on
that concept from there.

25
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.680
And we will get to the solution
in about 25 minutes.
