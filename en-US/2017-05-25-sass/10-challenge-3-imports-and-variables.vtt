&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's look
at our next exercise.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.297
So we're gonna extend upon these
buttons that we've been building, but

3
00:00:07.297 --> 00:00:11.156
what I've given you in this next exercise,
which is called variables.

4
00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:14.087
You're gonna do run-e variables.

5
00:00:14.087 --> 00:00:18.090
After you kill your existing server,
you'll restart it with that command.

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.530
You're gonna see that we have A variables

7
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.520
SaaS partial that you will
need to import and then use.

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.230
So this should be a pretty quick exercise,

9
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.240
cuz we've been working with buttons for
a while.

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.080
And this is sort of building on,
so you should have

11
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.079
something that resembles your solution
to the previous button exercise.

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.160
And what we're gonna do is consume
some variables after we input that

13
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.650
underscore variable's partial.

14
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.460
And code passed the tests.

15
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.900
So let's take another 12 minutes for

16
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.930
this, and
we will see you back here when we're done.
