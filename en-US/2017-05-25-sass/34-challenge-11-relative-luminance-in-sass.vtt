00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.270
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We're gonna fix a problem
that we ran into earlier that had to do

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.810
with colors standing out with
respect to other colors.

3
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.780
Before we ended up using brightness,
remember we said if the brightness

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.890
value is greater than 70, we don't want
to use white for the button text anymore.

5
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.520
The background is too bright for
us to use white.

6
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.300
So we'll use black instead.

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.960
But we noticed that blue, blue and black,

8
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.030
although that brightness
didn't meet the criteria,

9
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.600
there were something about it that made
it so it's still wasn't very visible.

10
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.240
So we're going to use this
concept of relative luminance,

11
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:45.390
which this expresses how visually bright
one color is relative to another color.

12
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.770
And this is sort of where we're closely
connected to how the human eye perceives

13
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.700
color and what we see as good contrast
of a foreground against a background.

14
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.050
So we're gonna begin by kind of
looking back at exercise six.

15
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.416
We're gonna start from the same
baseline that we did in exercise six,

16
00:01:05.416 --> 00:01:07.123
which was the if exercise.

17
00:01:07.123 --> 00:01:11.065
And we had that lightness check there.

18
00:01:11.065 --> 00:01:16.670
And we're going to try to build
something that works properly.

19
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.910
That uses this more complex
value instead of brightness.

20
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.060
It is a little bit of
a complicated formula here.

21
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.950
So part of what's complex
about this is that

22
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.840
we have to deal with something
called color spaces.

23
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.030
So we are RGB values,
at least as we're using them right now,

24
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.130
they're in what's called
a gamma compressed color space.

25
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.110
We need to move them into
a linear color space.

26
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.280
And this is what we're going to use as
the equation that helps us do that.

27
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.030
So you'll see on the top and by the way,

28
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.590
each of these, this is sort of
an equation that forks, right?

29
00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.360
It's gonna be a function that
if the channel value is below or

30
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.416
above this little threshold of 04045,

31
00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:08.780
we'll either follow the top path or
the bottom one.

32
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.216
On the bottom one, we're going to
need to use an exponent, right?

33
00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:19.898
And that does not come with SaaS, but
I have placed a pow function, right?

34
00:02:19.898 --> 00:02:23.661
So you are going to use an if for
the split between the two, top and

35
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:24.509
bottom half.

36
00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:29.730
And you're going to use pow to
get that base value, which is

37
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.914
just a fraction raised to the 2.4th power.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

38
00:02:34.914 --> 00:02:42.101
once we're done with this step, then we're
going to want to weight these colors,

39
00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:47.000
these linear RGB values
using this equation here.

40
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.900
And what we can see is that basically,
blue is very,

41
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.430
it's a little bit different than red and
green by an order of magnitude,

42
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.810
in terms of the ability for
dark colors to stand out against it.

43
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.835
And that is why our black text on
blue button background looked like,

44
00:03:06.835 --> 00:03:10.150
like I'm surprised people in
the room could see it at all, right?

45
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.270
It's quite difficult.

46
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.040
So we're going to work on this for
about 35 or 40 minutes.

47
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.350
And then we'll come back and
I will show you the solution.

48
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.645
So the difference you're looking for

49
00:03:24.645 --> 00:03:27.881
is a relative luminance
difference of about 0.7.

50
00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:31.380
That's the threshold at which you
wanna kick from white to black.
