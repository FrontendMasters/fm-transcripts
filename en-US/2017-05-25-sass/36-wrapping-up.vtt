&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Reason of using
extend instead of mixins?

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.030
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So what's the reason for
using extend instead of mixins?

3
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.294
He said that it might have
to do with CSS output and

4
00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:19.498
in fact that is one of the main
motivators for using extend.

5
00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:25.598
The idea that you can basically opt-in
to a class that's defined once,

6
00:00:25.598 --> 00:00:29.906
and add your selector to
that central definition.

7
00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:34.530
Versus mixins, which you can think of
those as like that function's evaluated,

8
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.690
that style's placed into your SaaS, and
then we start processing the rest of SaaS.

9
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.270
So like you will see that
every time you use a mixin,

10
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.530
you have those new rules brought in.

11
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.050
And again it's safer that
way because now like,

12
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.290
everything is independent but also
everything is repeated if that make sense.

13
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.896
Yeah, other than that,
I don't see any other questions there

14
00:01:00.896 --> 00:01:05.879
I do see a comment that when people solve
the equation, 20 folks dropped off online.

15
00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:08.487
So, I'm glad I put that at
the end instead of the beginning.

16
00:01:08.487 --> 00:01:12.890
[LAUGH] All right, well,
thank you all for coming.
