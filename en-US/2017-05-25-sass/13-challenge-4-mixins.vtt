&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's make
a rainbow array of buttons.

2
00:00:03.386 --> 00:00:06.222
I know, lots of buttons today,
it's fantastic.

3
00:00:06.222 --> 00:00:13.380
In your app.scss, you're already set
up to consume a mixin for this case.

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.823
It's just not doing anything.

5
00:00:14.823 --> 00:00:16.500
Your job is to fill in the blank.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.920
So I've already saved you the effort
of wiring it up yourself.

7
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.260
It's already included and
there should be an _mixins file,

8
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.850
like a partial, Sass partial
that contains this thing, right?

9
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.082
And it should take an argument as color.

10
00:00:35.082 --> 00:00:38.972
And so what we want to do is build
a mixin where we can define a button of

11
00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:41.190
an arbitrary color very easily.

12
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.570
And you should see in your app.scss
we're creating all seven of

13
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.720
these things with just one line each, for
each flavor of button that we have here.

14
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.530
So this would be great if we were
building a material design library or

15
00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.510
something like that where we want to allow
a very high degree of customization but

16
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.510
we don't want our Sass
to grow in complexity.
