00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.870
&gt;&gt; Mike: So we're gonna go through
the solution to this mixins exercise here.

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.020
Let me begin by kind of
resetting some stuff.

3
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.521
Killing my existing server,
and starting up the new one.

4
00:00:20.382 --> 00:00:22.842
&gt;&gt; Mike: Mixins, great.

5
00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:26.242
All right, so
there are the buttons that we have and

6
00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:29.480
you can see that we've
got a bunch of tests.

7
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.650
There's one test set,
one set of assertions per button color,

8
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.480
asserting that we have in fact
gotten the colors correct.

9
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.818
If we open the mixins folder and
look at our scss here.

10
00:00:44.818 --> 00:00:48.943
We've got app.scss, variables and

11
00:00:48.943 --> 00:00:53.070
mixins and if we look at app,
we've brought in the variables first and

12
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.060
then the mixins as I advised earlier
as we were leading up to this.

13
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.340
And you can see that

14
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.733
we've got some default stuff going
on here that applies to all buttons.

15
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:10.050
And then we are consuming a mixin for
each of these seven colors.

16
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.890
In one case we're using a variable,

17
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.930
in others we're using a color literal,
just a hex value for color.

18
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.930
And it's a little disappointing cuz
on the right everything is gray and

19
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.910
that's not we're aiming for.

20
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.837
So what I'm gonna do is
go to the mixins file and

21
00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:31.393
you can see here,
we've taken this variable color.

22
00:01:31.393 --> 00:01:34.874
So this is only available within
the context of this mixin and

23
00:01:34.874 --> 00:01:40.608
we can begin with,
&gt;&gt; Mike: Oops, background color

24
00:01:40.608 --> 00:01:46.287
of color.
&gt;&gt; Mike: All right, so this is great.

25
00:01:46.287 --> 00:01:51.510
Now if we look at our tests,
it's a subtle change.

26
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.460
They did change a little bit.

27
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.450
Let's see.
&gt;&gt; Mike: Maybe they didn't.

28
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.550
Well, they're complaining
about a font color now.

29
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.680
It may be that it's failing font color
before it even gets to background.

30
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.260
So it's saying that it expected to
find fff, it found 000 instead.

31
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.970
So let's try this, and the test passed.

32
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.820
So pretty simple to go through.

33
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.960
Now if we look at our CSS,

34
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.910
does anyone have a problem with
what we're looking at here?

35
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.940
Is there an improvement we can make?

36
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.410
If I required that we make this
file smaller, the CSS file smaller,

37
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.230
what could we do?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Could you define the text as

38
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.220
white as more of a global?
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yes, I could.

39
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.554
And so here we've used something in
the mixin that is not dependent on

40
00:02:49.554 --> 00:02:51.510
the variable being passed in.

41
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.090
It applies no matter what, right.

42
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.370
So the idea here is if I want to get
rid of this repeated style declaration

43
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.710
on a pro color basis,
we're currently at 53 lines.

44
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:13.590
And put that, we're failing now, put that
over here in the root button style block.

45
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.120
We end up cutting it down
pretty significantly.

46
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.990
This is what you wanna use whenever
you're creating these little

47
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.330
modifier flags like this.

48
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.840
You want them to be scoped to only
those things that variables pertain to.

49
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.570
And you want to move as much as possible
out into a single style declaration.

50
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.930
So that basically the cost of adding
additional button colors here

51
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.560
is significantly cheaper in terms
of the overall size of our SASS.

52
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.610
Now it may seem like just a few lines
here, but this practice in aggregate

53
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.690
can shrink the overall size
of your CSS by a lot, right?

54
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.450
Remember this is a very simple button and
a very simple,

55
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.820
like one line mixin,
two line or one line mixin.

56
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.500
In reality, it's likely that
these will be much bigger, right?

57
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.310
And so you will end up saving
proportionately much more.
