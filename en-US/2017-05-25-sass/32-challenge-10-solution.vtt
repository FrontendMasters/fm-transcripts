00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.310
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We're going to go through
the example where we're using extend

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.180
to create our primary and
secondary buttons.

3
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.500
So all I've done here is start the server
up and running in the background.

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.970
So you can see I've got the same
starting point that you should have had.

5
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.490
Take note that these are the way
my buttons look by default

6
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.650
in this particular browser with
these particular settings.

7
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.760
Your buttons might look different,
that's totally fine.

8
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.865
So what we're gonna do is go to our

9
00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:38.580
app.scss inside the extend exercise here,
that's the one we're working on.

10
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.430
And now we can get rid of this.

11
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.010
So, oops, that does not look right.

12
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.820
Let's see, extend, nope, apparently
that's what I left there, interesting.

13
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.090
So what we're gonna do, is we're going to
first create what's called a placeholder.

14
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.120
And this is gonna serve as sort
of the base for my buttons.

15
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.190
I'm gonna define some common styles here,

16
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.200
just like I was doing
before in exercise one.

17
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.610
But, in this case,
I'm going to end up extending from

18
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.222
this instead of using those secondary and
primary classes as modifiers.

19
00:01:18.222 --> 00:01:23.855
So, ultimately,
we're gonna end up doing this and

20
00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:27.062
give ourselves a secondary.

21
00:01:32.832 --> 00:01:35.735
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So what I can then do is
start to apply some of the rules here,

22
00:01:35.735 --> 00:01:38.071
like the padding that
we're supposed to have.

23
00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.830
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Probably,
nope, I got that wrong.

24
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.530
Padding top is supposed to be 2 pixels.

25
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.348
Border radius is supposed
to be two pixels.

26
00:01:55.364 --> 00:01:57.884
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
border style is suppose to be solid.

27
00:02:04.817 --> 00:02:06.520
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right,
now we're getting in the background color.

28
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.400
So the primary button is gonna
have a background of c49, I think.

29
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.390
Yep, and the color white,
this one is gonna have the color black.

30
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.740
And we're expecting to have this other
color, I'm just gonna grab it in RGB form.

31
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.670
You could copy it from excercise one
if you want, this will also work.

32
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.886
So, interesting, maybe it's c46.

33
00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:41.766
I think that's it, there we go.

34
00:02:41.766 --> 00:02:47.110
All right, so now we've extended from our
button, and we've added some of these.

35
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.650
We're starting to see our test pass.

36
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.990
I just wanna take a look at what
our CSS looks like at this point.

37
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.680
So you can see here, it's pretty simple.

38
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.700
We don't have a base button class,
but we have this

39
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.750
BTN placeholder that primary and
secondary both opted into sharing, right.

40
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.640
They want those styles,
so they also extend.

41
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.290
They add some styles of
their own on top of those.

42
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.850
And so what we get in the end is that
the commonalities are defined together in

43
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.140
a single style declaration
with two selectors.

44
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.170
And then each has their own
style declaration as well for

45
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.330
those things that make
these buttons different.

46
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.170
So we've still got that sort of
stuff that makes them safe and stuff

47
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.698
that makes them different, defined in
a way where we're minimizing redundancy.

48
00:03:33.698 --> 00:03:36.090
So we can keep going here and

49
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.874
add the opacity pseudo
selector here on the disabled,

50
00:03:40.874 --> 00:03:46.283
sorry, add the opacity style to
the disabled pseudo selector

51
00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:53.773
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And finally,

52
00:03:53.773 --> 00:03:59.000
button secondary still did not
like the background color there.

53
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.450
Hm, 200, c46 was found instead.

54
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.146
What's going on here?

55
00:04:16.358 --> 00:04:18.170
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I'm not sure
what's happening here.

56
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.805
So it says expected button
secondary to have value for

57
00:04:21.805 --> 00:04:25.293
background color this,
c46 was found instead.

58
00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:30.507
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I think
that's an error in my tests.

59
00:04:33.017 --> 00:04:34.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Background color?

60
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.167
&gt;&gt; Mike North: No,
I have the RGB values incorrect here.

61
00:04:39.633 --> 00:04:42.910
&gt;&gt; Mike North: There we go,
all right, so here we are at the end.

62
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.540
Let's take a look at our CSS.

63
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.320
You'll see that disabled that,
because that's another selector deep,

64
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.510
that got broken out into it's own role.

65
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.806
Again, consolidating the two
concerns into a single button.

66
00:04:55.806 --> 00:04:58.520
Now we could change it and
we can do this just as as easily.

67
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.090
Just changing our placeholder to a .vtn.

68
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.540
This would fail a test here,

69
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.470
because I've laid a trap where I am just
using the button selector by itself.

70
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.680
But you can see here,

71
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.850
now we've got this button base class
also as part of this thing here.

72
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.150
And you'd be at risk for someone saying,

73
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.430
well I created button other, which has
nothing to do with primary or secondary.

74
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.120
And I needed to make this
change to the base button.

75
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.650
And you could send ripple effects
through anything that extends from it.

76
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.210
So this is why I like to keep the idea
of extending from something and

77
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.090
using something directly in your
styles as separate concerns.

78
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.140
So this is the example for using extend.

79
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.050
And this, what we've done here, I don't
think you'd find people that would argue

80
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.150
that anything here is treading into
the unsafe use of extend territory.

81
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.840
So the only thing you could
object to is if, in principle,

82
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.110
you think it is dangerous enough to allow
the use of extend in your code base,

83
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.150
that you wanna avoid it entirely.
