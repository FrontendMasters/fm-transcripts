00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.960
&gt;&gt; Mike North: This was a challenging one
and let's go through the solution here.

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.970
All right, and
we have our little themes there.

3
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.952
So if we look at the HTML structure here,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Basically

4
00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:20.830
what we've got is,
a class that wraps a bunch of buttons.

5
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.350
So this is sort of a theme
applied from the outside, right?

6
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.310
And anything contained within this theme
should get it's colors by way of the fact

7
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.469
that, you know,
it is inside this thing with this class.

8
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.020
And you'll note that we have four types of
buttons and then primary and secondary,

9
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.340
again, are disabled.

10
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.430
Just to give you something visual,

11
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.700
some visual feedback as you
code to work on this exercise.

12
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.800
Furthermore, if we look in our
app as CSS file, you'll see that

13
00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.350
I am already kind of setting up the way I
would like this theme to be structured.

14
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:07.860
And that, I want to basically be
completely enclosed within a mixin.

15
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.588
Called theme, and this is gonna
take what looks to be a color and

16
00:01:12.588 --> 00:01:14.832
at least one other argument.

17
00:01:14.832 --> 00:01:20.290
If I go to the mixins file.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Where

18
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.411
our mixin is defined,
you can see that we've taken a color,

19
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:30.945
an angle of rotation, which has
to do with like the hue rotation.

20
00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:38.152
It was the angle on the slide between the
primary color and one of the other colors.

21
00:01:38.152 --> 00:01:41.081
And then finally,
a darken percentage that is used for

22
00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:44.210
the non-primary buttons to
kind of darken them a little.

23
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.400
So they're not as vivid, as the primary
which is designed to stand out.

24
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.380
And our goal here is to get something
where we can use this in a generic way.

25
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.400
Where we could use this mixin to
turn out another theme that has

26
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.930
yellow as its primary color,
very easily, just using this mixin.

27
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.622
So we've defined it once, and instead of
just getting one theme out of it, we've

28
00:02:08.622 --> 00:02:14.163
got something that builds a theme, in
terms of three things that we can adjust.

29
00:02:14.163 --> 00:02:17.470
And we can build arbitrary
themes using these things.

30
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.210
So let's get started.

31
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.220
I'm actually not gonna end
up working much in app.scss.

32
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.234
I'm gonna close that and we'll just
end up working in this mixins file.

33
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.030
So the first thing I want to
do is define my three colors.

34
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.410
These are the three colors that
are not given to me, I'm given one,

35
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.140
that's my primary color just to be clear.

36
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.870
I'm given this one here, right.

37
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.907
And I need to calculate the colors for
button other,

38
00:02:47.907 --> 00:02:51.600
button other two, button secondary, right?

39
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.070
So, let's go ahead and do that.

40
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.773
So, I'm gonna say,
other color is adjust to you and

41
00:02:58.773 --> 00:03:03.306
that takes in the primary color,
and a rotation angle so

42
00:03:03.306 --> 00:03:10.720
that's going to be rotate.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Other color, too.

43
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.760
Actually all three of these
are gonna use adjust here.

44
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.590
Other color too is straight across
the color wheel from primary.

45
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:27.214
So that's 180 degree rotation.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And then finally,

46
00:03:27.214 --> 00:03:32.613
the secondary color is going to be.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you need the deg?

47
00:03:32.613 --> 00:03:33.329
Sorry.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: No, you do

48
00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:34.038
not.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay

49
00:03:34.038 --> 00:03:34.908
&gt;&gt; Mike North: They're all numbers.

50
00:03:34.908 --> 00:03:35.952
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I know you said that,

51
00:03:35.952 --> 00:03:39.483
okay.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: No worries.

52
00:03:39.483 --> 00:03:42.530
So a number is a number.
Deg is a good indication to everyone who

53
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.740
read this that this a hue.

54
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.100
Alright, so now we've got some colors
defined and I don't like to go for

55
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.200
too long without showing something up on
the screen, so that I can know that I'm on

56
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.610
the right track and
get some sort of visual feedback.

57
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.530
So I'm gonna go ahead and
create some classes for my buttons.

58
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.549
Knowing that this is going to be
used like directly inside a theme.

59
00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.019
The parent selector isn't
really too valuable to me, so

60
00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.280
I'm just gonna define my
button classes right away.

61
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.063
Btn-primary.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

62
00:04:18.063 --> 00:04:26.048
btn-other2.

63
00:04:26.048 --> 00:04:28.814
And each of these is
gonna get a background

64
00:04:28.814 --> 00:04:34.567
color.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

65
00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:39.334
the first one, primary is just
gonna be the primary color.

66
00:04:39.334 --> 00:04:43.159
The second one here is
gonna be secondary color.

67
00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:45.100
The third one is other color.

68
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.751
And then other two color finally.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Clean

69
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:59.205
up our indents a little bit.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

70
00:04:59.205 --> 00:05:04.022
save it, and you can already see that
we're starting to get a semblance

71
00:05:04.022 --> 00:05:09.001
of a theme where we've defined once
like how this theme works in that there

72
00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:12.330
are four colors involved and at an angle.

73
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.300
Is part of how we calculate this.

74
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.990
Furthermore, if we go back to our app.scss
and we change this to 90 degrees,

75
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.340
I would expect the buttons
in the top row to change.

76
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.720
And they did.

77
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.530
It was subtle, but
let's go back to 10 degrees.

78
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.800
And they changed a lot.

79
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.577
They're now very,
very close to the primary color,

80
00:05:31.577 --> 00:05:34.820
right?
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We could go.

81
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.671
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is this the same file?

82
00:05:35.671 --> 00:05:37.877
What file is that?
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I'm in app.scss.

83
00:05:37.877 --> 00:05:41.430
So this is where we're using the mixin.

84
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.796
This is where we're including it.

85
00:05:43.796 --> 00:05:48.226
So if I go to 170 degrees,
you can see that I've got a green and

86
00:05:48.226 --> 00:05:51.526
a red that's straight
across the color wheel.

87
00:05:51.526 --> 00:05:56.350
And, sorry, it's a green and
a brownish thing.

88
00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.440
And then the other two colors, other and
other two in secondary, they're all

89
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.920
clustered pretty close together because
that angle's very narrow, right?

90
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.250
So this serves to kind of control where
those wings of this theme's color

91
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.896
end up being on the color wheel.

92
00:06:10.896 --> 00:06:15.250
So I'm gonna put it back to 100 and
we will keep on going.

93
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.800
So, that's step one, and

94
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.790
if I look here,
I'm gonna say that the border color,

95
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.110
I'm gonna work on these
requirements sort of in order.

96
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:31.810
So the border should be 20%
darker than the background color.

97
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.466
This should apply to all buttons.

98
00:06:34.466 --> 00:06:39.370
So here like whenever you have
something like this it is a requirement

99
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.230
that is in terms of what I have
in my mixin as a variable, right.

100
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.992
Background color is a variable because
all four of my buttons are different on

101
00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:50.309
a per theme basis, so

102
00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:55.274
we can just create another mixin.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: You don't have

103
00:06:55.274 --> 00:06:56.010
to do it this way.

104
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.720
You could have explicitly specified it.

105
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.540
So I'm just gonna call this bg.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You mean just in the theme

106
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.216
parentheses and just said border whatever?
&gt;&gt; Mike North: You could have just gone

107
00:07:06.216 --> 00:07:10.277
here and said border color,
and then something like

108
00:07:10.277 --> 00:07:15.150
this.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: That

109
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.430
would have been totally fine, right?

110
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.183
But I'm going to go ahead and
break this out a little bit

111
00:07:25.183 --> 00:07:29.986
more cuz we can.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

112
00:07:29.986 --> 00:07:32.799
mostly, because that's
an indication to me if it like.

113
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.330
It's valuable to sort
of refactor this out.

114
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.330
It is something that is dynamic and
it's depending on something dynamic.

115
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:47.500
And now we can do,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Like this.

116
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.845
We're basically gonna end up with this.

117
00:08:04.719 --> 00:08:05.622
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right, so

118
00:08:05.622 --> 00:08:07.656
our theme has not changed much,

119
00:08:07.656 --> 00:08:11.358
although you can see if I'm
looking closely at my screen.

120
00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:14.164
We can zoom in here, let's see.

121
00:08:14.164 --> 00:08:15.210
Come on browser.

122
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:19.590
So hopefully what we are in
fact seeing is a thin

123
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.460
dark green border around
a light green button.

124
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:28.084
So we have in fact used this background
as the border color and darkened it down.

125
00:08:28.084 --> 00:08:31.990
So we're still staying in the world where
we can create a button of any color we

126
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:37.160
want or a theme of any combination
of parameters that we want.

127
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.982
But starting to look
a little bit more rich here.

128
00:08:44.035 --> 00:08:44.904
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So then,

129
00:08:44.904 --> 00:08:50.080
what I want to do is read
my other requirements here.

130
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:55.540
So the hover background should be 20%
more saturated than 10% lightened.

131
00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.290
That is a terribly worded requirement,
I apologize for that.

132
00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:06.585
So here's what I'm looking for.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Background,

133
00:09:06.585 --> 00:09:13.141
so saturate,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

134
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:18.310
then take that and lighten.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: By 10%.

135
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.260
And I don't even think that tests for
this but this was sort of there for

136
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.810
people who cared to do it.

137
00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:27.890
And now you can see like when I hover over
this primary, that's a more obvious one.

138
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:31.550
Like that is a noticeably lighter
color there as I hover over it.

139
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.820
So now that's taking effect.

140
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:38.440
And I've reached the end of
the all button rows there.

141
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.429
Now I need to implement this,

142
00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:45.213
the non primary buttons end up being
darkened by a certain percentage.

143
00:09:45.213 --> 00:09:50.271
The way I am gonna address this,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I

144
00:09:50.271 --> 00:09:52.940
am just gonna have a slightly
different variable name.

145
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.101
So you can tell the difference
between what was defined where.

146
00:09:57.101 --> 00:10:00.170
So darken percent is going to default to

147
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:04.495
20.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: As part of this button

148
00:10:04.495 --> 00:10:05.047
base.

149
00:10:05.047 --> 00:10:09.130
And here, for the primary only,
I'm going to pass 0.

150
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:15.171
So I've effectively given myself
that in all cases except primary,

151
00:10:15.171 --> 00:10:20.099
20%.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And now I can use it here.

152
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:26.850
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right,

153
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.799
it looks like I have very
subtle color differences

154
00:10:30.799 --> 00:10:35.401
here.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Between what my

155
00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:39.300
tests are asking for here,
it's the secondary one.

156
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:44.576
It is quite possible that I
have a mistake in my tests,

157
00:10:44.576 --> 00:10:50.249
but let's see.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Just

158
00:10:50.249 --> 00:10:54.620
looking through this, yeah,
I'm gonna go with test mistake.

159
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.620
So I'm gonna update my tests,
I apologize for that.

160
00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.020
People who are watching the video
of course, your test will pass.

161
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.750
People who are attending the live
workshop or the live stream.

162
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:11.690
Sorry [LAUGH],
so I'm just gonna go in here and

163
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:16.160
say the secondary background color
is incorrect so that's here.

164
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:23.031
And you know what it was, we just changed
the color theme around a little bit.

165
00:11:23.031 --> 00:11:25.310
I'm just gonna compare that.

166
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:31.230
It's the same variables that we were using
in ap.scss that we're using down here.

167
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:36.010
So it was this one,
then this is for theme one,

168
00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:42.492
we'll copy this in.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

169
00:11:42.492 --> 00:11:46.574
other button background.

170
00:11:46.574 --> 00:11:48.952
Another slightly different
one by a very subtle amount.

171
00:11:54.787 --> 00:11:55.973
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Theme two.

172
00:12:00.223 --> 00:12:01.174
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So secondary,

173
00:12:01.174 --> 00:12:09.350
that's this one.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: This one.

174
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:15.958
And then this one here.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: This

175
00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.340
is why testing CSS, this way is not ideal.

176
00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:24.957
I was basically asserting that certain
color values were certain color values,

177
00:12:24.957 --> 00:12:27.607
and it's a bunch of copy paste stuff.

178
00:12:27.607 --> 00:12:29.197
All right, here we go.

179
00:12:29.197 --> 00:12:36.016
Wait, here we go.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Theme three,

180
00:12:36.016 --> 00:12:40.679
secondary.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

181
00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:46.384
these just got flipped.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: There we go.

182
00:12:46.384 --> 00:12:51.223
Not a dramatic reveal, but what we do have
here now, the end result is pretty cool,

183
00:12:51.223 --> 00:12:54.170
where we could do something like this.

184
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:58.856
Red, so now this red row here
that's the theme in terms of red.

185
00:12:58.856 --> 00:13:03.614
We can darken it or we could do like coded

186
00:13:03.614 --> 00:13:08.640
blue.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Now we're using that blue.

187
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.630
We could start with like an orange.

188
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:16.000
And we have a way of kind of defining
a theme of nice, complementary colors.

189
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.890
Because these angles around the color
wheel like, if you talk to someone who

190
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:24.660
knows a lot more about color theory
than I do, this is a good way to pick

191
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:29.130
colors that tend to go together, and
to contrast well against each other.

192
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:34.180
And now we have as if a Sass
mixin that we can use that will

193
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:39.350
give us a set of colors for
an arbitrary couple of combinations.

194
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:43.260
So if you're building a product and you
need to do something like white label it

195
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.980
and someone gives you the primary
color of their business.

196
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.570
Like this is our logo color, use this.

197
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:53.440
You could then generate a theme just by

198
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.780
creating a new one of these
things really easily.

199
00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:02.600
And this is a great example of one of
these complex, higher level mixins, right?
