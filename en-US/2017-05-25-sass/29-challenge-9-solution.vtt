00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.618
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We're going to
go through the solution here,

2
00:00:03.618 --> 00:00:06.195
to a building our buttons BEM style.

3
00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:09.295
So switching over to my code here.

4
00:00:09.295 --> 00:00:12.847
Let me just get rid of the last

5
00:00:12.847 --> 00:00:18.516
solution.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: That

6
00:00:18.516 --> 00:00:20.298
was an interesting literary strat there.

7
00:00:28.138 --> 00:00:30.090
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right, killall -9 node.

8
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.970
So if you get an error that a ports
already running, I saw a couple of people

9
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.350
with that it could be that one of the
exercises is running in the background.

10
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.980
And here we're gonna
run an exercise called

11
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.557
Bem.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

12
00:00:45.557 --> 00:00:48.260
what we have are basically the buttons.

13
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.870
They're sort of structured correctly,
they're just not styled the way we want

14
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.029
them to be styled yet.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So we'll open up our

15
00:00:57.029 --> 00:01:03.450
project here.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: My editor's

16
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.427
throwing some curve balls to me today.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Here we go,

17
00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:13.120
BEM, and here's our Sass, and
now we can get rid of our sidebar here.

18
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:22.760
So I do actually wanna see one thing.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's look at our HTML.

19
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.370
So I'd like to draw attention
to what's going on here.

20
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.250
This is our component and
what we have is the button has

21
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.970
a modifier on it called
button --mode-primary, right?

22
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.210
This is the equivalent of our
button-primary thing that we've been using

23
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.040
in several exercises today, and
inside, we've got an element and

24
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.580
that is this BTN underscore price.

25
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.250
Right, sorry BTN double underscore price.

26
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.840
This is the convention for
element that we have two underscores

27
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.069
between the block and
sort of the name of this element.

28
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.930
So let's get started here.

29
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.200
We've already got some basic styling
here and part of the instructions

30
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.180
involved following the color
schemes from Exercise 1.

31
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.700
So let's get started.

32
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.204
So we're gonna do btn--primary, and this,

33
00:02:22.204 --> 00:02:28.300
sorry it's not btn--primary,
it's btn-mode-primary.

34
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.330
You'll see modifiers
often come in the form of

35
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.180
collections of modifiers that all
are grouped by a certain theme,

36
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.710
like button size big, or
size medium, or size small.

37
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.230
And often times, you'll see families
grouped together in this way.

38
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.620
Families of modifiers.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And here we'll go button

39
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.876
mode secondary.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

40
00:02:56.876 --> 00:03:03.222
here we're gonna have background of c,
I think it's c49 or

41
00:03:03.222 --> 00:03:08.957
c69, let me just look at
Exercise 1 here real quick,

42
00:03:08.957 --> 00:03:15.190
which was nesting.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: c46,

43
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.918
close.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

44
00:03:19.918 --> 00:03:23.480
that should make the primary button happy.

45
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.454
I see that the button primary also
needs to have a good heading value,

46
00:03:29.454 --> 00:03:34.192
padding left is 10 pixel and
14 we said instead, so

47
00:03:34.192 --> 00:03:39.359
we can just fix that.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: What we've

48
00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.119
got now,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Is we're looking for

49
00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:45.660
changes in colors.

50
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.773
So now, we've got text color popping up as
the next failing task the primary button

51
00:03:49.773 --> 00:03:54.850
should have a text color of white.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

52
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.428
I know this one is gonna want black.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

53
00:03:59.428 --> 00:04:03.466
the background should be the same as what

54
00:04:03.466 --> 00:04:08.352
we used in exercise one so
just grab it from here.

55
00:04:18.393 --> 00:04:20.781
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay, and now opacity,

56
00:04:20.781 --> 00:04:26.923
it looks like when the button is disabled,
we need the opacity to

57
00:04:26.923 --> 00:04:34.846
be 0.5.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

58
00:04:34.846 --> 00:04:38.987
then finally, we have a test
that relates to the element,

59
00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.613
the price that is inside our button.

60
00:04:41.613 --> 00:04:44.400
So I'll define a selector for that.

61
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.610
Just a reminder that we
can just use __price,

62
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.660
here take advantage of the fact that
the .btn comes along for the ride.

63
00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:01.920
It is important to note that elements
will almost always begin like this.

64
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.093
Modifiers will often begin with like a&amp; so

65
00:05:07.093 --> 00:05:11.834
this will have a padding three pixels,

66
00:05:11.834 --> 00:05:17.593
I think it was one pixel and
I have that flipped.

67
00:05:17.593 --> 00:05:22.313
All right, now, finally button price
should have a background color

68
00:05:22.313 --> 00:05:28.200
of,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: 080.

69
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.240
But let's see and 08 was found instead.

70
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:41.200
This is really interesting because
I have what it's looking for.

71
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.727
I think that some of the color
can version stuffs in my test is

72
00:05:48.727 --> 00:05:51.567
&gt;&gt; Audience 1: What is words looking for?

73
00:05:51.567 --> 00:05:53.587
&gt;&gt; Mike North: 0008-

74
00:05:53.587 --> 00:05:55.007
&gt;&gt; Audience 2: And three zeros.

75
00:05:55.007 --> 00:05:56.727
&gt;&gt; Mike North: 000.

76
00:05:59.647 --> 00:06:01.007
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Interesting.

77
00:06:01.007 --> 00:06:05.940
And now, finally, we've got like when our
buttons disabled we want the price to no

78
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.500
longer be green, right?

79
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.010
We want that to fade out as well.

80
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.570
So important to know that
we're gonna have to break,

81
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.480
we're gonna have to express some
style about our element in here.

82
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.550
The reason I gave you this
little exercise is so

83
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.040
that you could discover that we can't
simply put our ampersand in here again.

84
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.760
That would refer to disabled,

85
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.980
like we're already another selector deep,
and you can't just double down on,

86
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.250
you can use that ampersand once
your another scope down the line.

87
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.462
So here we would have
to deal btn_price and

88
00:06:38.462 --> 00:06:44.664
then the background would be
again the same one I'm guessing.

89
00:06:48.766 --> 00:06:51.477
&gt;&gt; Mike North: No, it's aaa, there we go,

90
00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:56.810
and all tests are passing so
we could not do this I believe.

91
00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:02.739
Yep, see it doe not apply.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: In fact,

92
00:07:02.739 --> 00:07:05.880
I'm intrerested to see what CSS
this is gonna generate for us.

93
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.340
What is that gonna look like.

94
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.635
Yeah, see not good.

95
00:07:11.635 --> 00:07:13.182
Not good.

96
00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:19.312
[LAUGH] So,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: It's

97
00:07:19.312 --> 00:07:21.040
one of the limitations.

98
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.130
We don't quite have enough tools to
make that a really elegant thing,

99
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.160
but here you go.

100
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.800
This is a totally valid BEM component.

101
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.560
Low on the complexity side but
hopefully, you start to see

102
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.600
some of the best practices you
already kind of align with.

103
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.340
There's the formalized
in this methodology.

104
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.570
&gt;&gt; Audience 3: You're asking why

105
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.045
did you use BTN.

106
00:07:48.045 --> 00:07:54.036
--mode primary instead
of &amp;-- mode primary?

107
00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:57.028
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Here &amp;-- mode primary like

108
00:07:57.028 --> 00:07:58.320
this.

109
00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.500
Good question.

110
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:05.210
So let me fire up the exercise again.

111
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.970
So you'd find that this would work.

112
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.910
You'd find that this would work.

113
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.170
Here's the difference and
the out part of the CSS.

114
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:19.190
If we look up here, so I've actually
got two different ways of doing it.

115
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.270
This is perfect.

116
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.110
I've got one secondary.

117
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.870
It's using the wave that I
initially solved the problem.

118
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:30.040
I've set primary equal to the way
the person asking the question online.

119
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:39.190
Express it and
the resultant CSS looks like this.

120
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:43.740
So you see what I've done is I've
popped out of the scope of BTN

121
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.090
now my modifier is potentially
floating around and

122
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:53.420
it's applying its styles even outside
the context of the block element.

123
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:58.120
And although in this particular
case it couldn't cause trouble.

124
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:05.260
This is less specifically scoped
than the rule should probably be.

125
00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.470
If we were to kind of adhere to
the best practices that would,

126
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.420
it'll protect us from tripping over
our shoelaces as our app scales.

127
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.258
Good question though.

128
00:09:14.258 --> 00:09:19.342
I wish there was an elegant
way of expressing modifiers

129
00:09:19.342 --> 00:09:24.656
that matches how nice these
end up looking for elements.

130
00:09:24.656 --> 00:09:31.192
But I would sooner write these out
than like have those things floating

131
00:09:31.192 --> 00:09:36.410
around in the open outside
the context of the BTM class.
