&gt;&gt; Mike North: If you have an input
of type range, we get a slider.

2
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.840
We can have a horizontal slider and we can
define a min value and a max value and

3
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.150
even step values where we can go up
by increments or down by increments.

4
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.030
It's possible to style this slider,
so that it looks like this,

5
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.990
instead of what you will get,
which varies from browser to browser.

6
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.580
The browser defaults are not the same
on Safari, or Chrome, or Firefox.

7
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.490
There's an awesome article that
comprehensively deals with the aspects of

8
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.620
styling this input element so
that it looks nice like this.

9
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.310
But there's no example there for
how we do this using Sass.

10
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.860
What I would like you to do is start
by going to this URL, go to the end of

11
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.660
the article where you can grab his
complete solution, which is just pure CSS.

12
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.260
Then using this idea of Mixins and
the content directive and

13
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.840
parent selectors,
let's see how much we can clean it up.

14
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.880
We're gonna have an informal little
contest here to see who can shrink

15
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.810
this up into not the smallest number of
lines possible, but the most maintainable

16
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.930
form possible or we're repeating
ourselves the least we can get away with.

17
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.543
It should start with you pasting
stuff into your app.sess file and

18
00:01:28.543 --> 00:01:32.413
you should see something that looks
like this in the app immediately and

19
00:01:32.413 --> 00:01:37.080
then you're gonna want to start iterating
on it and cleaning it up a little bit.

20
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.990
Extracting things out into
variables until time is up and

21
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.960
just ensure that it keeps looking
that the way it is supposed to look.
