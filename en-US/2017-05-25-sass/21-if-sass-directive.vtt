&gt;&gt; Mike North: The next exercise is really
easy, cuz you guys slog through that one.

2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.414
We're gonna introduce one
little concept and then make

3
00:00:07.414 --> 00:00:12.382
a small tweak to an older exercise that we
completed that will make it really cool.

4
00:00:12.382 --> 00:00:17.400
So one of the things that SaaS adds,
which is really important

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.744
in terms of being able to
parametrize these things and

6
00:00:21.744 --> 00:00:26.183
deal with the kind of mixins
that we were working with,

7
00:00:26.183 --> 00:00:29.350
is we get a little bit of control flow.

8
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.400
We get, essentially, if.

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.830
If and else, right?

10
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.200
I don't actually have
an example of an else here.

11
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.070
You won't need it for your exercise, but

12
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.650
it's just @else immediately
following the close brace of an if.

13
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.980
And one thing to remember is that
this is not something that is

14
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.230
evaluated at like when your
CSS is read by a browser.

15
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.960
This is what is evaluated
as you build your CSS out.

16
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.795
So like whatever it is, that conditional,
that if is figured out and resolved and

17
00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:10.646
baked in to regular CSS when you're making
your browser consumable style sheet.

18
00:01:10.646 --> 00:01:14.778
And in this case, what we're doing is
we're saying that if the font size

19
00:01:14.778 --> 00:01:19.332
is greater than a certain amount,
we're gonna also increase the line height.

20
00:01:19.332 --> 00:01:20.486
Because potentially,

21
00:01:20.486 --> 00:01:25.110
we've hit some threshold where now we know
we need to accommodate some extra space.

22
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.920
And so here I'm passing in a pixel value
to both places and you can see that line

23
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.150
height is only added If that condition
meets the required criteria.

24
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.391
Now we could have done this
a null default value as well.

25
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:43.566
But if you imagine that it was a more
complicated set of styles, like if we had

26
00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:47.351
five or six different things that
need to be conditionally applied,

27
00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:51.030
you don't want to have to have
null values for all of those.

28
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.140
And furthermore, oftentimes,
you need to toggle between things.

29
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.640
And it starts to get to a point where
it's like yes, you could do it that way,

30
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.310
but oftentimes,
this is gonna be the neater way.

31
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.848
And it's also pretty readable.

32
00:02:04.848 --> 00:02:07.509
Because anyone who comes across this,

33
00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.467
it is they may be surprised
that it's possible to do this.

34
00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:15.253
But they will probably be able to make
a reasonable assumption as to what's

35
00:02:15.253 --> 00:02:15.924
going on here
