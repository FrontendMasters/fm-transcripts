00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.880
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We're going
to look at the solution for

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.330
this exercise here using a conditional
inside our style sheets.

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.260
Now where this began was a solution

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.550
to the previous exercise where we
had that the theme mixin, right?

5
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.316
And what we're trying to do just
to be clear is in the event.

6
00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:27.050
Oops, sorry I had a solution
on the board there.

7
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.155
In the event that the background
color is too light,

8
00:00:33.155 --> 00:00:39.414
we want to switch from white
text to black text right.

9
00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:42.866
And so, we want like white
text on things like this and

10
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.340
then to keep the black text over here.

11
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.560
So, the first thing I wanna do is make
sure that I define sort of a base button

12
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.740
text color and
I wanna do this in my app.scss file,

13
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.280
right in the button definition itself.

14
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.670
I'm gonna take this out of the mixin,
right?

15
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.070
And conditionally, we will apply
the other color when we apply the mixin.

16
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.800
So here we'll do color and
we'll say it's by default black.

17
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.070
So now, I can close this file and

18
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.110
we're gonna be inside
this mixin.scss file.

19
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.644
And where I wanna be working is within
this button base mixin that we created in

20
00:01:29.644 --> 00:01:31.054
the last section here.

21
00:01:31.054 --> 00:01:35.672
And if you have a different solution,
that's fine but this is another

22
00:01:35.672 --> 00:01:40.524
example of why having a button base
here is a kind of useful construct, and

23
00:01:40.524 --> 00:01:43.185
why when you see something like this, or

24
00:01:43.185 --> 00:01:48.354
you've got like a parameterization
within a parameterization it's like you

25
00:01:48.354 --> 00:01:53.860
have a variable within something that
is expressed in terms of variables.

26
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.970
You might wanna consider breaking
that out into it's own thing.

27
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.620
Because all we have to do here
now is if lightness of color,

28
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.820
I always get my signs flipped here, we'll
see if I get it right the first time here,

29
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:15.130
is greater than 70%, actually it would
be like less than 70% color is white.

30
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.530
Let's see if this works, ta-da.

31
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.440
Okay, I guess it does.

32
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.596
So, just to look at what we're
seeing in our solution here,

33
00:02:23.596 --> 00:02:26.213
theme three is sort of a darker theme.

34
00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:30.168
And I deliberately made it so, so
that we definitely have a couple data

35
00:02:30.168 --> 00:02:33.630
points on both sides of
this threshold we've set.

36
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.040
But we can see that like
other two in the theme two,

37
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.420
that yellow button that's black text
on yellow, we can see that really well.

38
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.380
In the row above where we're seeing that
like pink, where we see like the white and

39
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.010
the light pink.

40
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.530
That's still working pretty well.

41
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.750
I do want you to note that theme two's
primary buttons still looks pretty bad.

42
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.880
And the reason here and

43
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.620
we will address this problem in
the final exercise of this course.

44
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.750
Is that brightness is not
necessarily what you want to use

45
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.220
to make the kind of call
to we're making here.

46
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.410
It is something that it's closely
related to brightness but

47
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.730
brightness doesn't quite do it.

48
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.790
In fact, blacks and whites stand out
better against reds versus blues,

49
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.150
versus greens a little bit differently.

50
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.530
And we have a blue there that is 70% or

51
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.390
less, but
the black is hardly visible on it at all.

52
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.380
So we will look at that, at the color
theory sort of behind that, and

53
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.420
implement our own Sass function at the end
that deals with addressing this problem.
