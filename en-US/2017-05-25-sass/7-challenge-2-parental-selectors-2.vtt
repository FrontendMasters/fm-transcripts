&gt;&gt; Mike North: We have a second
exercise waiting for us.

2
00:00:02.341 --> 00:00:06.314
[LAUGH] So we talked about container
left with a left align nav, and

3
00:00:06.314 --> 00:00:10.170
then adding this right-nav
class to the container.

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.030
So what we wanna do is make
use of the parent selector.

5
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.310
So that we can actually get this result,
right?

6
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.360
So we talked about it
as an abstract example.

7
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.909
We never looked at the CSS
that would actually do it.

8
00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:28.132
But what you should have when
we start this example, and

9
00:00:28.132 --> 00:00:31.090
I'll give you your
instructions back in a second.

10
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.720
I'm just gonna show you
the code that you start with.

11
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.723
So I'm going to kill my server right now
cuz it was running the nesting exercise so

12
00:00:39.723 --> 00:00:42.562
we're going to stop it with Ctrl+C.

13
00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:47.421
And now we can run the next exercise and
its name is parent, for

14
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:49.810
the parent selector.

15
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:57.290
So what we have here, if we open up
the parent folder and look at the Sass.

16
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.350
You already have the code for

17
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.420
what makes this work
in a left aligned way.

18
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.446
So I want us to make it so
that when we add the right-nav case,

19
00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:16.081
like when we add the right-nav
class to the container,

20
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:18.370
you will have to go in here.

21
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.000
So right now it already has the class and

22
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.380
as you can see it's not doing anything,
right?

23
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.790
Our sidebar is still to the left.

24
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.476
So the class is applied, it's not doing
what it's supposed to be doing yet.

25
00:01:29.476 --> 00:01:35.350
So right Sass, that makes this work
the way it's supposed to work, right?

26
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.620
And the desired result, going back to
the slide here, is that when we have

27
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.760
the right-nav class added to the container
our side bar should go to the right.

28
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.650
And at the same time you should have all
of the same padding, all of the same

29
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.500
alignment that you do when we have it
in the conventional case on the left.

30
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.885
So you're gonna have to deal with
the borders switching sides and

31
00:02:00.885 --> 00:02:04.930
you're gonna have to figure out which
margins need to be defined where.

32
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.740
This is a good exercise in terms
of defining what some constructive

33
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.110
cascading rules, where you override
certain things strategically

34
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.710
as little as you can get away with
in order to get this desired result
