00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.470
&gt;&gt; Mike: And this is the smallest
exercise of the whole course here.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.420
We're still gonna take 12 minutes for

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.420
it, but
we're gonna build on the earlier example.

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.690
Remember we had the rainbow
list of buttons.

5
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.000
It was our first use of a mixin.

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.270
So you're starting with
a solution to that problem.

7
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.310
But what we wanna do is use
the lightness color function and

8
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.480
if to basically decide that
when a color is too light,

9
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.730
we want to change the text on
the button from white to black.

10
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.940
So that it pops out a little
more against the background.

11
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.060
So here if like the other two on
the yellow button in the middle,

12
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.540
if that were still white text you
wouldn't be able to see it at all.

13
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.120
So this is a really common use case,
you can imagine.

14
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.050
Our themes may have been
really interesting,

15
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.780
this function that we just built.

16
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.910
But there are certain color combinations
where it's just not useful.

17
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.720
It's not going to provide what we want.

18
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:05.030
So take the solution to the earlier
exercise as your starting point.

19
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.500
It should be like a three or
four line change.

20
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.060
Involving use of the lightness
Sass function and

21
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.870
an if to conditionally
change the background color.

22
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.144
So I change the text color if
the background color is too light.

23
00:01:21.144 --> 00:01:25.520
And the threshold that I'm testing for
is 70% or 0.7.

24
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.830
Sass does not care which one you use.
