00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.352
All right, so what have we learned today?

2
00:00:01.352 --> 00:00:03.332
We've learned time and space complexity.

3
00:00:03.332 --> 00:00:07.533
We learned about arrays, linear search,
binary search, two crystal balls, lists,

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:11.962
singly, doubly, queue, stack, ArrayList,
RingBuffers, recursion, maze solving,

5
00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:16.219
QuickSort, trees, traversals, pre order,
in order, post order, BSF traversals,

6
00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.342
comparing binary trees,
binary search trees, heaps, tries,

7
00:00:19.342 --> 00:00:22.995
graphs, BFS/DFS Dijkstra's shortest path,
map, and an LRU thus far.

8
00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:24.908
This is quite a few things to learn.

9
00:00:24.908 --> 00:00:29.605
Usually, again, a lot of these things
take 225 hours worth of effort.

10
00:00:29.605 --> 00:00:33.481
If you spend four hours for three hours a
week plus a one hour lab that takes about

11
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:37.240
five hours, this is what you would
effectively get to at the end of it.

12
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.635
There might be a couple more graphs,
probably not an LRU,

13
00:00:40.635 --> 00:00:43.180
just depends kind of on where you're at.

14
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.640
Implementing a map is
really not all that hard.

15
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.484
So that might have been a week in which
you only spent an hour in the lab,

16
00:00:49.484 --> 00:00:53.146
versus spending four hours,
five hours, eight hours in the lab.

17
00:00:53.146 --> 00:00:56.140
That was a lot, how does everyone feel?

18
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.770
Feeling pretty good?

19
00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.564
All right, so I am gonna do
something that's a little different,

20
00:01:01.564 --> 00:01:03.399
a little unexpected.

21
00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:04.881
Yeah, first, I gotta do this one.

22
00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:06.490
How many of you
are interested in using vim?

23
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.910
Come on, did you see how sweet?

24
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.780
&gt;&gt; I was interested in using vim
before I even saw you using it.

25
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.704
&gt;&gt; Nice, okay, so
you're cool before it was cool to be cool.

26
00:01:15.704 --> 00:01:17.665
I mean,
you're a cup of coffee at this point.

27
00:01:17.665 --> 00:01:19.959
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; But coffee's hot.

28
00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:20.505
&gt;&gt; It shouldn't be.

29
00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:22.348
&gt;&gt; Get it,
you drink it before it's cool, hipster.

30
00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:25.412
It's like, come on,
that's even your name, practically.

31
00:01:25.412 --> 00:01:27.404
It was the greatest pun in the universe.

32
00:01:27.404 --> 00:01:30.594
All right, so-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

33
00:01:30.594 --> 00:01:31.904
&gt;&gt; I really liked that.

34
00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:36.540
So anyways, you can always use it,
have a course on it, very,

35
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.476
very excited about that.

36
00:01:38.476 --> 00:01:39.824
What's next, really?

37
00:01:39.824 --> 00:01:44.398
There's a bunch of exotic sweep trees,
graphing data structures, implementing

38
00:01:44.398 --> 00:01:48.795
anything in Rust, always pretty much
an exercise in futility, using Neovim.

39
00:01:48.795 --> 00:01:52.424
There's all sorts of worlds out there
that can help improve your developer

40
00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:53.123
experience.

41
00:01:53.123 --> 00:01:55.178
And I'm gonna do this, okay?

42
00:01:55.178 --> 00:01:59.266
[SOUND] We're gonna do a hair reveal.

43
00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:00.722
So, first off, hair reveal.

44
00:02:00.722 --> 00:02:03.299
I do have hair,
it's not a skull in the back.

45
00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.287
Look at that, just a big thing of hair.

46
00:02:05.287 --> 00:02:11.087
But the reason why I do that is I did want
to say something more important than that.

47
00:02:11.087 --> 00:02:15.997
Which is that a lot of people don't
have awesome opportunities, right?

48
00:02:15.997 --> 00:02:19.658
In life, it is very, very hard to be
able to sit through these things,

49
00:02:19.658 --> 00:02:22.390
and to be able to have the time
to be able to do this.

50
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.920
I don't want you guys to waste it.

51
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.641
In other words, there's plenty of
people out there whose life is hard.

52
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:32.350
You guys have something awesome.

53
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.150
Don't just ignore this, go, that was cool.

54
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.070
Use it, become awesome.

55
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.376
Become something better than you are now.

56
00:02:41.376 --> 00:02:44.328
Because I didn't have,
[SOUND] I'm always so bad at this.

57
00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:46.797
It always takes a couple times.

58
00:02:46.797 --> 00:02:50.273
I didn't have a lot of these
opportunities growing up, and

59
00:02:50.273 --> 00:02:51.951
I want you guys to have them.

60
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:56.863
So that's why I get motivated
to make these things.

61
00:02:56.863 --> 00:02:59.560
It's not easy, it takes tons of time.

62
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.790
But I want you guys to be motivated,
to be excited like I am.

63
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.030
So, there you go.

64
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.843
As the ending,
I wasn't prepared to do that.

65
00:03:06.843 --> 00:03:08.830
I just felt like it was real.

66
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.720
There you go.

67
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.754
I'm sure I had more to say,
but I couldn't.

68
00:03:12.754 --> 00:03:15.257
For now, vim on and prosper.

69
00:03:15.257 --> 00:03:17.975
It's way cooler than all the rest,
and that's it.

70
00:03:17.975 --> 00:03:20.254
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; There you go.

71
00:03:20.254 --> 00:03:23.323
I'm trying not to cry, but
it always ends up happening.

72
00:03:23.323 --> 00:03:26.130
It's kind of hot in here,
little sweat, just a little bit.
