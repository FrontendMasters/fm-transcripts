1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.860
All right.

2
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.291
We are now gonna start this class.

3
00:00:03.291 --> 00:00:04.799
I'm pretty excited about doing this class.

4
00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.858
I had been preparing this for
the last couple months.

5
00:00:08.858 --> 00:00:11.524
This was my favorite
class I did in school.

6
00:00:11.524 --> 00:00:13.921
I still remember this very, very vividly.

7
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:15.832
When I first did computer science,

8
00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:19.528
I really actually kind of hated
the experience of it the first class of

9
00:00:19.528 --> 00:00:22.413
computer science just
learning how to program Java.

10
00:00:22.413 --> 00:00:23.991
Maybe it was just Java that I hated.

11
00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:27.835
I don't know what happened but it was
really boring it was really mechanical.

12
00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:30.340
I thought it was so
mechanical that I'd rather do mechanical

13
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.004
engineering I did a year of
Mechanical Engineering after that.

14
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:36.557
And realize the only thing I hate
more in the introduction to computer

15
00:00:36.557 --> 00:00:37.850
science are integrals.

16
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.679
And so, that made me change
back to doing computer science.

17
00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:45.773
And when I did, I went to the second
class, Ray Babcock was teaching it and

18
00:00:45.773 --> 00:00:47.235
we went over linked list.

19
00:00:47.235 --> 00:00:50.437
And I still remember like looking
at the screen just blown away.

20
00:00:50.437 --> 00:00:52.016
And I was like, this is awesome.

21
00:00:52.016 --> 00:00:55.483
I love this and
this is the coolest thing ever.

22
00:00:55.483 --> 00:00:58.744
And so, at that point I just
couldn't get it out of my head.

23
00:00:58.744 --> 00:01:03.597
I was so excited and so I've always really
appreciated specifically this topic it

24
00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:05.577
just is such a cool, cool topic.

25
00:01:05.577 --> 00:01:08.101
And so, I'm pretty excited to be here I'm
pretty excited to be able to teach this.

26
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.664
And so,
I hope everybody is also very excited.

27
00:01:10.664 --> 00:01:13.608
The last course you'll ever need
that does seem a bit much, right?

28
00:01:13.608 --> 00:01:17.228
Well, it is hopefully the last
algorithms course you'll ever need.

29
00:01:17.228 --> 00:01:20.552
But there is definitely an expectation
that you will have to go out and still

30
00:01:20.552 --> 00:01:24.212
continue to understand and learn these
things and actually apply what you learn.

31
00:01:24.212 --> 00:01:28.671
Cuz anything you do, what happens to it,
it atrophies super, super quick.

32
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:32.255
You're gonna lose it all in the next
six months if you don't think about it,

33
00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:33.212
if you don't do it.

34
00:01:33.212 --> 00:01:36.602
One of the benefits of going to school
is that you have the same stuff over

35
00:01:36.602 --> 00:01:37.914
the course of three years.

36
00:01:37.914 --> 00:01:39.296
So, it takes a lot longer for

37
00:01:39.296 --> 00:01:41.895
that to atrophy if you have
to keep on going back to it.

38
00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:46.574
Just like I still have silly doom
cheat code stuck in my head from

39
00:01:46.574 --> 00:01:50.122
20 years ago cuz I entered it in so
many times.

40
00:01:50.122 --> 00:01:53.355
All right,
these are the algorithms I did run into.

41
00:01:53.355 --> 00:01:56.229
So, over the course of my
either interviewing career or

42
00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.390
professional career, I have also tried to
hand select the ones that I've used at

43
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.431
least once in a professional setting.

44
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:03.984
One that I've had to build or

45
00:02:03.984 --> 00:02:07.299
had to understand the difference
of why use one or the other.

46
00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.279
I think that it's really, really good
to try to be as practical as possible.

47
00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:14.409
Cuz I think a lot of times you'll learn
about algorithms like Merkle trees, and

48
00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.194
you'll be like, wow, this is incredible.

49
00:02:16.194 --> 00:02:21.013
But then, you're never gonna be the person
writing a new crypto coin coming out.

50
00:02:21.013 --> 00:02:23.269
So, you're probably never gonna be able
to even use any of these sweet hashing

51
00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:23.928
algorithms, right?

52
00:02:23.928 --> 00:02:27.001
So, it's just like there's a point
where algorithms become unusable for

53
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:28.181
the average professional.

54
00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:31.576
But I think there's a huge amount of
algorithms that are super useful to

55
00:02:31.576 --> 00:02:32.942
the average professional.

56
00:02:32.942 --> 00:02:37.716
Even though they think they will never
run into them, you use them all the time,

57
00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:38.649
like nonstop.

58
00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:41.960
All right.
So, why should you care about them?

59
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.372
A lot of times you hear the phrase,

60
00:02:43.372 --> 00:02:46.262
it's kind of old-fashioned to
interview with algorithms, right?

61
00:02:46.262 --> 00:02:48.172
That's kind of like the twitter momentum.

62
00:02:48.172 --> 00:02:51.672
All right, now is that if you
do white boarding interview,

63
00:02:51.672 --> 00:02:54.476
the company's stupid
whatever twitter says.

64
00:02:54.476 --> 00:02:59.304
I do bad twitter impersonations or you
don't actually use any of them on the job.

65
00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:01.288
Well, the reality is that, sure,

66
00:03:01.288 --> 00:03:04.274
maybe algorithms aren't
the best way to interview.

67
00:03:04.274 --> 00:03:07.294
And sure, maybe you don't use a lot
of them on the job constantly.

68
00:03:07.294 --> 00:03:08.569
But the reality is that,

69
00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.741
there is a secret handshake to
get into a very good paying job.

70
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:13.016
Learn the handshake, right?

71
00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:16.607
Why fight the system when
it's just available and

72
00:03:16.607 --> 00:03:18.839
it's free online to go learn.

73
00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:20.244
And you get an opportunity
right now to learn.

74
00:03:20.244 --> 00:03:23.302
So, I always thought that was
kind of like a strange argument.

75
00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:25.629
So, here we go.
So, here's the big question I want to

76
00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:26.161
ask you.

77
00:03:26.161 --> 00:03:27.568
Is that in the array?

78
00:03:27.568 --> 00:03:29.721
What's used here?

79
00:03:29.721 --> 00:03:32.830
For those that I assume everybody
here is familiar with TypeScript,

80
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.501
I chose TypeScript intentionally.

81
00:03:34.501 --> 00:03:37.849
Because I want the broadest
audience possible.

82
00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.299
Is that an array,
would everyone say that's an array?

83
00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:41.636
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right, great.

84
00:03:41.636 --> 00:03:45.498
What if I told you that's not an array?

85
00:03:45.498 --> 00:03:46.177
Would you be shocked?

86
00:03:46.177 --> 00:03:49.165
Hopefully you'd be shocked because
you're like, wow, my life's lie.

87
00:03:49.165 --> 00:03:50.979
Also extremely old meme.

88
00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:55.147
Yes, I get it's a very old meme and guests
your life may or may not have been alive.

89
00:03:55.147 --> 00:03:58.717
Remember arrays are the simplest data
structure, you should be able to know,

90
00:03:58.717 --> 00:04:00.841
if you're looking at an array or
not, right?

91
00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:04.945
They're the most fundamental basics or
basic data structure.

92
00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:06.282
Well, let's find out.

93
00:04:06.282 --> 00:04:09.338
Next, we'll also cover time and
space complexity.

94
00:04:09.338 --> 00:04:11.009
There's not gonna be any proofs,

95
00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:14.880
I will do what's called solving of
an equation nothing really, really large.

96
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.678
But we're gonna try to keep it really
simple because for the most part in

97
00:04:18.678 --> 00:04:22.415
the professional world you don't
do a lot of time-space break down,

98
00:04:22.415 --> 00:04:24.717
you really only do it during an interview.

99
00:04:24.717 --> 00:04:28.383
And you don't even do best average and
worst case, you just do worst case.

100
00:04:28.383 --> 00:04:29.244
Like what's the running time?

101
00:04:29.244 --> 00:04:30.336
Well, actually,

102
00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:34.652
if you give this input you don't even
do that you're just like it's this.

103
00:04:34.652 --> 00:04:35.541
And why TypeScript?

104
00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:38.180
I chose it because it's the most
beginner friendly language,

105
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.329
even though it's actually kinda bad for
data structures and algorithms.

106
00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:45.117
Good example, you cannot use pure
type script to create a map.

107
00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:49.369
It's just you have to use C++ there's
no way to uniquely identify an object.

108
00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:53.376
So, if you just give me a POJO a plain
old JavaScript object with foo bar as

109
00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:57.142
the properties, I can't distinguish
two of them from each other.

110
00:04:57.142 --> 00:04:59.508
So, you can't even create
a map in actual JavaScript.

111
00:04:59.508 --> 00:05:03.461
So, there is this kind of uniqueness
with JavaScript that makes it kind of

112
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:05.133
a terrible language for this.

113
00:05:05.133 --> 00:05:08.557
It also doesn't have arrays in the
traditional sense there's a lot of unique

114
00:05:08.557 --> 00:05:09.353
things about it.

115
00:05:09.353 --> 00:05:13.400
So, by the way if you're also interested
in real languages such as Rust,

116
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.096
we just released this
course I think yesterday.

117
00:05:16.096 --> 00:05:20.560
I programmed in TypeScript and didn't go,
Graham over there saw this and

118
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.016
in Rust and I build the same
application at the same time.

119
00:05:24.016 --> 00:05:26.055
And all three languages help
you learn a different language.

120
00:05:26.055 --> 00:05:26.682
Who am?

121
00:05:26.682 --> 00:05:30.665
I am the CEO of the Startup,
please try harder.

122
00:05:30.665 --> 00:05:34.487
I do a YouTube channel I'm almost at
100,000 subs, that means I get a little

123
00:05:34.487 --> 00:05:37.617
plaque which means I get to lick
the plaque very excited about that.

124
00:05:37.617 --> 00:05:40.565
I stream a lot of live coding,
that's a lot of fun.

125
00:05:40.565 --> 00:05:45.421
And I poop post on the internet,
That's for you production team.

126
00:05:45.421 --> 00:05:48.896
And there you go, that's a great one,
no one can actually mention it.

127
00:05:48.896 --> 00:05:51.588
Anyway, so
I hope you guys are ready to get started.

128
00:05:51.588 --> 00:05:56.109
I intentionally tried to make this
introduction as short as possible because

129
00:05:56.109 --> 00:05:59.931
the main contents or the topic
we're covering is fairly large and

130
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:02.101
I want you to get the most out of this.

131
00:06:02.101 --> 00:06:02.988
So, there we go.

132
00:06:02.988 --> 00:06:07.035
And one last note, when I was at
university I did this two day courses

133
00:06:07.035 --> 00:06:12.078
approximately the second semester class
a little bit of the fourth semester class.

134
00:06:12.078 --> 00:06:16.007
And my second semester class math
three times a week for one hour,

135
00:06:16.007 --> 00:06:17.944
it's expected for 15 weeks.

136
00:06:17.944 --> 00:06:21.035
You're expected to do three hours
of study for every one hour or

137
00:06:21.035 --> 00:06:23.618
four hours of study for
every one hour of class time.

138
00:06:23.618 --> 00:06:27.245
Plus a one hour lab once a week,
which is five hours of preparing.

139
00:06:27.245 --> 00:06:31.065
So, that's equivalent of 225 hours
over the course of 15 weeks.

140
00:06:31.065 --> 00:06:34.637
And we're gonna try to do all that
in 16 hours, plus lunch breaks,

141
00:06:34.637 --> 00:06:36.677
plus bathroom breaks, plus all that.

142
00:06:36.677 --> 00:06:41.581
So, again, it's gonna take some
of your effort outside of this to

143
00:06:41.581 --> 00:06:44.662
really understand a lot of these things.

144
00:06:44.662 --> 00:06:45.226
Here you go.

145
00:06:45.226 --> 00:06:47.420
Here are two books that I have bought.

146
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.478
Minimum I have these two books I bought
at least four copies of them combined.

147
00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:54.770
So, I may or
may not have lost them over the years.

148
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.261
The first one is extremely academic.

149
00:06:57.261 --> 00:07:01.360
This Introduction to algorithms it's very
very academic it's gonna go over proofs.

150
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.084
But it is by far the most complete
book I've read on algorithms.

151
00:07:05.084 --> 00:07:08.613
Anyone who's in the chat who is
mildly familiar with algorithms or

152
00:07:08.613 --> 00:07:11.952
went to some sort of school will
probably could guess the book,

153
00:07:11.952 --> 00:07:14.172
guess what's on the cover the tree book.

154
00:07:14.172 --> 00:07:17.664
The second one is I named it this way cuz
I thought it was funny for programmers who

155
00:07:17.664 --> 00:07:20.916
don't know data structures and
we'd like to do other things as well too.

156
00:07:20.916 --> 00:07:25.210
So, that one is at the zoo and
reference for those who don't know.

157
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.465
But that one right there is
more of a very simple one.

158
00:07:28.465 --> 00:07:31.692
This course will cover about
maybe 75% of the book and

159
00:07:31.692 --> 00:07:34.310
then it kind of it
deviates in various areas.

160
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.634
But that one's a much more
beginner friendly one.

161
00:07:36.634 --> 00:07:40.067
The proofs are much smaller,
if there is really any proofs to it.

162
00:07:40.067 --> 00:07:43.708
The topics are a lot lighter,
they don't cover nearly as much in trees.
