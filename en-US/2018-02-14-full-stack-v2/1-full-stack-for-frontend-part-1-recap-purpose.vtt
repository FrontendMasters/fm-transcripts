00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.161
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Let's do
a recap of the first course.

2
00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:05.177
We learned how the internet works.

3
00:00:05.177 --> 00:00:08.137
We learned domains, and IP addresses.

4
00:00:08.137 --> 00:00:11.167
Domains are just a map to IP addresses.

5
00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:12.096
Yeah?

6
00:00:12.096 --> 00:00:15.345
All right, all right, okay,
haven't lost anybody yet.

7
00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:18.260
We also learned how to
love the command line.

8
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.730
We learned that terminals
aren't that scary.

9
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.223
In fact, you can just take your mouse and
just throw it out the window right now.

10
00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:24.870
I'll wait.

11
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.211
Alright, welcome back.

12
00:00:28.211 --> 00:00:32.423
Don't throw out your mouse, but we're
gonna do everything today in the shell.

13
00:00:32.423 --> 00:00:33.447
It's not sexy.

14
00:00:33.447 --> 00:00:36.337
It's not like,
look at this cool thing I built.

15
00:00:36.337 --> 00:00:39.151
But it's that deep satisfaction
knowing you built a server.

16
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:42.619
And you built something that can run
anything, cuz servers are the backbone of,

17
00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:44.406
well, most of the applications you use.

18
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.921
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: We also learned basic
commands like ping, traceroute, vi.

19
00:00:50.921 --> 00:00:52.496
Anybody, what does ping do?

20
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.823
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Sends a ping
request to the server?

21
00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.012
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Why do we use it?

22
00:00:58.012 --> 00:00:58.767
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: To see if it's up?

23
00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:00.402
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, perfect.

24
00:01:00.402 --> 00:01:02.520
Traceroute, someone remind me.

25
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.456
What does traceroute do?

26
00:01:06.456 --> 00:01:14.013
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It shows the path that your
request takes to get to the final server.

27
00:01:14.013 --> 00:01:15.848
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, excellent answer.

28
00:01:15.848 --> 00:01:19.722
Why do we use it?

29
00:01:19.722 --> 00:01:20.249
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I do not.

30
00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:23.194
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Speed of the connection.

31
00:01:23.194 --> 00:01:25.181
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Not really,
but it can help with that.

32
00:01:25.181 --> 00:01:27.325
You're on the right path.

33
00:01:27.325 --> 00:01:28.893
Anybody?

34
00:01:28.893 --> 00:01:30.167
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Like to see where your
outage is happening [CROSSTALK] down.

35
00:01:30.167 --> 00:01:31.776
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes.

36
00:01:31.776 --> 00:01:33.199
Great answer.
Yes, exactly.

37
00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:35.980
If your server is not responding or
you know your server is up but

38
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.706
you don't know why you're not connecting
to it, traceroute is an excellent tool in

39
00:01:39.706 --> 00:01:42.659
finding out which part of the layer,
of the network layer is down.

40
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.310
And vi, just want to remind me what vi is.

41
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Editor.

42
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Editor.

43
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.270
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Excellent, alright.

44
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.550
Someone got something.

45
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.820
Mostly with vi,

46
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.360
we learned what 1.2 million people
on the internet do not know.

47
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.710
We learned how to exit vi.

48
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.680
It's a very common like, it's a very
popular problem on Stack Overflow.

49
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.318
Someone remind me, how do we exit vi?

50
00:02:04.318 --> 00:02:06.308
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Saving or not saving.

51
00:02:06.308 --> 00:02:09.045
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Not saving, just exiting.

52
00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:09.725
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Colon q?

53
00:02:09.725 --> 00:02:12.081
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Colon q, excellence.

54
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:17.503
You're smarter than probably 1.3
million people now, so feel proud.

55
00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:20.534
We also learned how to create and
manage your own web server.

56
00:02:20.534 --> 00:02:24.470
Hopefully, everybody managed to bring
up the server in the first part.

57
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.821
If not we're gonna bring up another
one but, hopefully you did,

58
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:28.718
cuz that's kinda the whole
point of these classes.

59
00:02:28.718 --> 00:02:30.520
Servers.

60
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.860
And you learned,
you have your own sweet new server,

61
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.845
maybe with your own domain name,
maybe not.

62
00:02:34.845 --> 00:02:37.463
Maybe it's just a simple
node server sitting there.

63
00:02:37.463 --> 00:02:38.410
It doesn't matter.

64
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.391
Today we're gonna make it awesome.

65
00:02:40.391 --> 00:02:43.030
We learned how to create a deploy
system with a for Node app.

66
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.736
We used Gulp for that.

67
00:02:44.736 --> 00:02:47.548
But Gulp is just one of many tools
we can use, we can use scripts.

68
00:02:47.548 --> 00:02:49.278
We can use, hell, we can use Python.

69
00:02:49.278 --> 00:02:51.509
We can use anything we want to deploy,

70
00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:55.431
because deploys are just a way of
shipping code out into the world.

71
00:02:55.431 --> 00:02:59.103
We use Gulp because we do JavaScript,
JavaScript is great.

72
00:02:59.103 --> 00:02:59.859
All right.

73
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.181
We also built a very basic webpage.

74
00:03:03.181 --> 00:03:07.055
Very boring, there are at least 3 or 4
classes on Frontend Masters of people that

75
00:03:07.055 --> 00:03:10.666
are much smarter than me and much better
designers on how to build a webpage.

76
00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:14.658
So I encourage you to take those,
we learned how to put it in there, and

77
00:03:14.658 --> 00:03:16.500
just serve it down to the world.

78
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.268
Just a quick hello world.

79
00:03:17.268 --> 00:03:21.770
So why full-stack?

80
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.976
So in the year since my previous course,
I think I've gotten, I don't know,

81
00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:28.975
56 recruiter emails about
full stack specifically,

82
00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:30.845
even though that's not what I do.

83
00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:32.861
I am a UI engineer.

84
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:36.390
But we learn full stack, because it's
an important skill set to learn.

85
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.710
All the code you're gonna write,

86
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.500
especially if you're building a web page,
runs on a server, at some point.

87
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.440
So it's good to know
how these things work.

88
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.080
And it's not that I wanna teach you rote,
line by line,

89
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.430
exactly like how to think and what to do.

90
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.570
I wanna teach you why we're doing it,
that's much more important, the why.

91
00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.136
I wanna make you know, and
not just believe that this stuff works.

92
00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:02.360
Cuz a lot of stuff,
you can just copy paste.

93
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.270
You can Google, how do I do this?

94
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.171
Copy-paste it,
your server's up and running.

95
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:06.610
But you won't know how to fix things.

96
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.320
When you go off that paved road
of unknownness, you made a typo,

97
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.700
how do you know how to fix it
if you don't know what you did?

98
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.120
And that's what this course is all about.

99
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.920
So I'm gonna go nice and slow.

100
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.465
We're gonna start off fast,
cuz we're gonna build a server.

101
00:04:20.465 --> 00:04:24.335
Everything we did in the first one,
and then we're going to slow down,

102
00:04:24.335 --> 00:04:25.379
ask me questions.

103
00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:29.047
I promise you, I'm a UI engineer,
I don't know everything.

104
00:04:29.047 --> 00:04:30.780
Most of the things we're
gonna cover today,

105
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.429
there's entire careers dedicated to it.

106
00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:37.014
So application security, just writing
scripts and automating deployment,

107
00:04:37.014 --> 00:04:41.259
there's entire careers and
professions that do just these one things.

108
00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.175
And all the tools we're gonna
cover are fairly complex.

109
00:04:45.175 --> 00:04:48.504
If you want, in any given time, and
you see something of a command line,

110
00:04:48.504 --> 00:04:51.465
just type man, for the manual page,
we learned that last time.

111
00:04:51.465 --> 00:04:53.564
And you'll see, the myriad of options, so

112
00:04:53.564 --> 00:04:56.877
I promise I don't know what all
those things do, not many people do.

113
00:04:56.877 --> 00:04:58.676
But it's there if you need it.

114
00:04:58.676 --> 00:05:02.322
But again ask a lot of questions,
that's why you're here today.
