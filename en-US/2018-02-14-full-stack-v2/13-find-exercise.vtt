00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.830
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
let's do an exercise with Find.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.300
How, knowing the syntax, how do we
find all the log files in/var/log/?

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.044
Think about it,
you can even run the commands locally,

4
00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:14.160
it's not gonna break anything, hopefully.

5
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.355
How would I find all the log files?

6
00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:26.553
Well, I would use find,
the directory, the type, f is file.

7
00:00:26.553 --> 00:00:29.177
Otherwise I search file names and
directory names.

8
00:00:29.177 --> 00:00:30.649
We just want files.

9
00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.029
We give it a name, wildcard *.log.

10
00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:38.393
And if you run that, you might need
to see the command cuz /var/log/

11
00:00:38.393 --> 00:00:43.022
is not owned by you.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So let's go ahead and

12
00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:43.555
do that.

13
00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:47.465
find /var/log/, and

14
00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:51.560
I wanna say type is file and

15
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.212
name, say all the log files,

16
00:00:56.212 --> 00:01:00.987
*.log.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And

17
00:01:00.987 --> 00:01:03.483
there's a lot of log files.

18
00:01:03.483 --> 00:01:08.795
Now, if we wanna say, I wanna find all
the log files in my system in general,

19
00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:10.457
you can just say /var.

20
00:01:10.457 --> 00:01:13.010
Pretty fast, but most things are in /log.

21
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.773
If you're saying,
why are we getting permission denied,

22
00:01:15.773 --> 00:01:19.087
it's because we don't have as this
user permission to even read a lot of

23
00:01:19.087 --> 00:01:22.077
the files.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So

24
00:01:22.077 --> 00:01:24.389
if I run that again we see,
permission denied.

25
00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:27.255
Remember our old trend sudo bang bang?

26
00:01:27.255 --> 00:01:29.504
It means run the last command as sudo, and

27
00:01:29.504 --> 00:01:34.647
now we can read all the log files.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right.

28
00:01:34.647 --> 00:01:37.203
I feel like not enough people are,
their minds are being blown.

29
00:01:37.203 --> 00:01:41.010
I know, it's find, it's simple but
when you break down most computer science,

30
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.510
it's actually pretty simple.

31
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.652
It's finding things,
writing things, reading things and

32
00:01:44.652 --> 00:01:45.745
writing things to a database.

33
00:01:45.745 --> 00:01:47.867
It's kind of what it all boils down to.

34
00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:51.029
And the ability to quickly find things,
if you master find,

35
00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:54.388
you'll just impress your friends,
impress your colleagues.

36
00:01:54.388 --> 00:01:57.260
You're like, I know where that is,
cuz you can find things by modified time.

37
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.791
You can say,

38
00:01:57.791 --> 00:02:01.370
what are all the files in my system
that have been touched in the last day?

39
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.580
That's pretty useful.

40
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.300
Trying to do that with any other system or

41
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.590
any other like find command
would be pretty difficult.

42
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.950
It's hard to do it.

43
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.010
You can say, find all the files that
are modified by this user in the past week

44
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.170
in case someone broke into your system,
did something malicious.

45
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.419
That's pretty useful.

46
00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:20.687
Again, find and grep are two of the most
used command people know, other than vim.

47
00:02:20.687 --> 00:02:24.654
That's also useful too, and Nmap.

48
00:02:24.654 --> 00:02:30.198
So let's find all the empty files in /etc.

49
00:02:30.198 --> 00:02:36.008
How would we do that?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Size zero,

50
00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:39.037
size.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: That's a good point,

51
00:02:39.037 --> 00:02:40.220
size zero.

52
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.410
But remember back here,
we have an option that says empty.

53
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.940
So knowing what we know about find,
where in our options.

54
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.430
How do we find the empty files?

55
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.990
Just think about it mentally,
you can type it up.

56
00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.360
It's actually pretty straightforward,
find /etc -type

57
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.190
file -empty.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: That's useful.

58
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.020
You say, Jem, why would I need to
find the empty files in my system?

59
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.850
Well, let's say you have a bunch
of log files that are created by

60
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.320
some rogue process and
you wanna clean them up.

61
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.430
This is a great way of finding them.

62
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.620
Just like that, versus before,

63
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.290
think about trying to find an empty
file system without knowing about find.

64
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.510
You have to go through
all the directories,

65
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.000
you say, what's the file size?

66
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.070
We can do it with find with one command,
pretty useful.

67
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.580
If you don't think it's useful,
you will in the future, trust me.

68
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:40.148
All right, let's find all
directories with the word log in it.

69
00:03:40.148 --> 00:03:41.700
How do we do that?

70
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.692
So we say find /log,
so it's a directory, so

71
00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:53.100
we want type d, and the word log in it,
we just say name log.

72
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.104
Am I right?
Yes, I like when I'm right,

73
00:03:55.104 --> 00:03:58.825
because I don't remember all these
things off the top of my head.

74
00:03:58.825 --> 00:04:06.483
So just find, type, directory, name log.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: These are pretty useful,

75
00:04:06.483 --> 00:04:10.231
but again, think of all the scenarios
that you ever try to find something in

76
00:04:10.231 --> 00:04:13.104
your file system, and
I almost guarantee you can a find.

77
00:04:13.104 --> 00:04:15.943
It might take a bit more verbose typing,
but

78
00:04:15.943 --> 00:04:21.257
when you finally see the brilliance of it,
you're like, this makes sense.

79
00:04:21.257 --> 00:04:23.606
This is awesome.
