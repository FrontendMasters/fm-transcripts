00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:06.852
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Today we are doing Full
Stack for Frontend Engineers 2, part two.

2
00:00:06.852 --> 00:00:11.175
This is not an,
we won't say we're not going to

3
00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:14.970
rehash that much from Frontend part one.

4
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.141
This is more of an extension, a little bit
deeper dive, the good stuff, if you will.

5
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:23.502
So if you took part one,
which I hope you all did.

6
00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:27.189
I don't see everybody nodding, but
that's okay, took part one, that's good,

7
00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.307
you should know the stuff,
love it, learn it.

8
00:00:29.307 --> 00:00:30.647
If not, we are going to do a recap,

9
00:00:30.647 --> 00:00:32.835
we're going to cover the high
level things we learned.

10
00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:36.684
We're going to bring up another server,
configured just the way I like it.

11
00:00:36.684 --> 00:00:39.399
Because I don't know what you all did,
but it may not be right and

12
00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.422
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

13
00:00:41.422 --> 00:00:45.820
And then we're going to get to some,
the really, really fun stuff, well,

14
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.032
it's fun to me, it will be fun to you.

15
00:00:48.032 --> 00:00:51.852
My name is Jem Young, I am
a Senior Software Engineer at Netflix.

16
00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:55.811
I work on the UI team, so
I work on the website,

17
00:00:55.811 --> 00:00:59.175
a bit of the mobile app, this and that.

18
00:00:59.175 --> 00:01:01.813
Yeah, why do I do full stack?

19
00:01:01.813 --> 00:01:05.035
Everything I've learned today that I'm
going to tell you is things that I've just

20
00:01:05.035 --> 00:01:06.059
picked up over my career.

21
00:01:06.059 --> 00:01:08.555
They're things that I
think you need to know,

22
00:01:08.555 --> 00:01:12.535
full stack is a little intimidating
of a term because it's really broad.

23
00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:15.911
Anybody who remembers the first course
remembers we talked about networking and

24
00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:17.506
DNS and packets and all these things.

25
00:01:17.506 --> 00:01:19.803
It's a very, very broad topic.

26
00:01:19.803 --> 00:01:22.434
And I want to say,
anybody just starting out,

27
00:01:22.434 --> 00:01:24.736
here's all the things you need to know.

28
00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:28.329
Forget all that stuff,
forget all these low level nuances.

29
00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.757
These are the things
that you need to know,

30
00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:34.343
things that I've used in my day
to day at some point or another.

31
00:01:34.343 --> 00:01:37.278
Yes, and feel free to ask questions,

32
00:01:37.278 --> 00:01:41.976
that's why I'm doing this live and
not some v-log, vlog?

33
00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:46.047
See, you can tell I'm getting old,
I don't know the nomenclature anymore.

34
00:01:46.047 --> 00:01:52.612
Serious business, slides, part two,
jemyoung.com, Frontend full stack 2.

35
00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:55.637
The slides for
the original one are Frontend full stack.

36
00:01:55.637 --> 00:01:59.272
I will be referring back to my original
slides because I won't remember

37
00:01:59.272 --> 00:02:00.676
everything, no one does.

38
00:02:00.676 --> 00:02:05.574
But they're all there,
I try to link back, if at all possible,

39
00:02:05.574 --> 00:02:08.407
so we kind of close the whole circle.

40
00:02:08.407 --> 00:02:10.597
Today, we're going to learn a few things.

41
00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:14.238
I will not read all this because you've
probably seen an email at some point,

42
00:02:14.238 --> 00:02:16.772
but the high level,
we're going to learn some Node.

43
00:02:16.772 --> 00:02:19.555
We're going to learn some Bash,
create shell scripts, pretty awesome.

44
00:02:19.555 --> 00:02:23.414
We're going to tune our Nginx just
a little bit more, we set it up last time.

45
00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:26.742
We made some authorizations, but
today we are really going to make it much,

46
00:02:26.742 --> 00:02:27.367
much faster.

47
00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:30.985
In fact, I will probably blow your mind at
some point with how fast we are going to

48
00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:31.745
make the Nginx.

49
00:02:31.745 --> 00:02:34.902
Hopefully, hopefully at some point today,
I blow your mind with something.

50
00:02:34.902 --> 00:02:40.040
Thatâ€™s my goal, just for you to walk
out dazed, like wow, I learned a lot.

51
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.114
We are also going to learn
common server vulnerabilities,

52
00:02:43.114 --> 00:02:45.086
this is a whole field in and of itself.

53
00:02:45.086 --> 00:02:49.326
Application security, server security,
we're going to learn about some of those,

54
00:02:49.326 --> 00:02:50.672
kind of just easy gotchas.

55
00:02:50.672 --> 00:02:54.919
Just like in JavaScript, you're like,
I don't eval things, why do you do that?

56
00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:58.430
Because everybody knows not to, that's
the same thing we're going to learn today.

57
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.127
We're going to learn how to add HTTPS,

58
00:03:00.127 --> 00:03:02.298
I covered it briefly at
the end of the last course.

59
00:03:02.298 --> 00:03:05.937
But we're going to do it today in a much
simpler way because technology has

60
00:03:05.937 --> 00:03:07.710
come a long way since the first one.

61
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.506
It's only been a year,
we're going to understand databases a bit,

62
00:03:11.506 --> 00:03:13.411
what are they, why do I need them?

63
00:03:13.411 --> 00:03:16.131
How to install one,
how to pick the right one.

64
00:03:16.131 --> 00:03:19.418
Then we're going to understand
containers and automating deployments,

65
00:03:19.418 --> 00:03:20.207
that'll be fun.

66
00:03:20.207 --> 00:03:22.337
We're going to wrap up with that,
because it's a little more dense,

67
00:03:22.337 --> 00:03:23.140
a little more technical.
