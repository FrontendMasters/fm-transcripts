00:00:00.139 --> 00:00:05.219
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: We are all together, we have
the same server running Ubuntu 16.04.

2
00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:07.821
We all have node and
NPM installed properly.

3
00:00:07.821 --> 00:00:10.799
So, now let's get to server security.

4
00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.554
Two main parts to server security,
controlling access and

5
00:00:14.554 --> 00:00:16.514
securing your applications.

6
00:00:16.514 --> 00:00:19.666
Controlling access means
not letting people in.

7
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:24.500
That means strong authentication of login,
configuring your firewalls correctly,

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.961
configuring your permissions correctly.

9
00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:31.314
Securing applications it's a little bit
trickier because you don't know every line

10
00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:33.865
of code of every bit of
software you're running.

11
00:00:33.865 --> 00:00:36.927
So the best you can do is keeping
your software up to date and

12
00:00:36.927 --> 00:00:38.690
limiting your application use.

13
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.197
One of the most common server
vulnerabilities is just people

14
00:00:42.197 --> 00:00:46.469
running outdated copies of WordPress,
or outdated copies of PHP Admin.

15
00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.741
Or just software they don't even know what
it's running, because someone saw it at

16
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:53.401
one and is like, here's a cool tool, I'm
using it, they don't know what's going on.

17
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:57.669
So one of the easiest thing you can do
is just don't install too much software.

18
00:00:57.669 --> 00:01:00.363
Unless you explicitly
know what you're doing.

19
00:01:00.363 --> 00:01:01.787
That's a top tip.
