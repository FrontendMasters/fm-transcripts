00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.070
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Strong authentication,
let's add an SSH key.

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.570
We already did that actually,
we did it for the root user, but

3
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.920
we need to do that for
our current user that we just made.

4
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.667
So let's make an SSH directory in our
local directory, our home directory.

5
00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:17.500
And then we're gonna make
a file called authorized keys.

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.742
Then we're just gonna paste
our public key into that.

7
00:00:20.742 --> 00:00:21.807
This is all in part 1.

8
00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:24.785
If you're confused right now,
you didn't take part 1.

9
00:00:24.785 --> 00:00:27.055
Shame, shame, [LAUGH] no,

10
00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:32.097
I'll give you a minute to do that and
then I'll do it myself.

11
00:00:32.097 --> 00:00:35.425
Why do we have to make
.ssh/authorized_keys?

12
00:00:35.425 --> 00:00:38.666
Well, that's where the SSH domain
looks if you're trying to log in.

13
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:42.280
It says I'm gonna look for a public key
here, I'm gonna look for public key here.

14
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.399
We'd actually rename this to something
arbitrary and just change it, but

15
00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.418
this is a default configuration, and
I always say stick with defaults,

16
00:00:48.418 --> 00:00:50.266
unless you really know what you're doing.

17
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.187
But that's just all that's happening,
we're making a file,

18
00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:56.649
we're putting our public key in there,
so that when we wanna handshake with

19
00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.557
the server it knows where to look.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And this can be the same

20
00:01:01.557 --> 00:01:04.474
public key that we have for the user?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,

21
00:01:06.435 --> 00:01:07.647
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I have seen some people go

22
00:01:07.647 --> 00:01:11.399
a bit overboard, they create a server,
they create a new SSH key every time,

23
00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.539
you don't generally have to do that, and
it'll just get confusing in the long run.

24
00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:17.398
You can use one or two.

25
00:01:17.398 --> 00:01:21.603
I would encourage you not to use the same
SSH keys for say GitHub as your server,

26
00:01:21.603 --> 00:01:26.390
as if someone steals one they have access
to everything, generally a bad idea.

27
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.616
But for servers you can one or two and
you'll be okay, no need to go overboard,

28
00:01:31.616 --> 00:01:35.636
SSH is pretty strong particle,
as we learned in the first course.

29
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.677
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Okay,

30
00:01:41.677 --> 00:01:45.010
I am gonna go ahead and make this.

31
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.650
So PWD, print working directory,
make sure I'm in the right directory.

32
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.561
So I'm gonna mkdir -p,

33
00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:56.070
-p says create it if it doesn't already
exist, otherwise it will error.

34
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.447
I'm gonna say, .ssh.

35
00:02:00.447 --> 00:02:05.261
Well, let me use the same syntax I used.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Awesome,

36
00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:09.980
I'm just gonna cd in there.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Say,

37
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.469
vi, actually I copied this.

38
00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:14.952
I cheated, I cheated, I copied and paste.

39
00:02:14.952 --> 00:02:18.028
It's okay, authorize keys.

40
00:02:18.028 --> 00:02:19.629
So what do we put in here again?

41
00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.910
We put our public key.

42
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.800
Where do we get that from?

43
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.221
So let's just open up
a new terminal briefly.

44
00:02:27.221 --> 00:02:31.387
We won't be back on our home computer
that often, but we're just gonna do this,

45
00:02:31.387 --> 00:02:33.182
cuz we need to copy our public key.

46
00:02:33.182 --> 00:02:37.191
Let me make that extra big.

47
00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:40.731
And I'm just gonna cd, same spot, ssh,

48
00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:50.620
oops
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And

49
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.023
if you look at the speaker notes,
I try to put useful tips in there.

50
00:02:56.023 --> 00:03:00.487
So I'm gonna use a tool called PB Copy
which just takes the output of CAT and

51
00:03:00.487 --> 00:03:07.205
then copies it to your clipboard.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So pbcopy my public key,

52
00:03:07.205 --> 00:03:12.551
notice the .pub, not your private key,
just gonna copy that.

53
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:15.530
Plays away, insert, cool.

54
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.780
I'm just going to right quit on that.

55
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.320
All right, so what I did was,

56
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.442
I copied my public key into my clipboard,
I just pasted in this way.

57
00:03:26.442 --> 00:03:29.700
If you remember in part 1,
we did it a fancy command line way.

58
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.830
It's a bit more complicated.

59
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.100
This way is pretty straight forward.

60
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.900
It's bullet proof.

61
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.236
Command line way is way cooler.

62
00:03:35.236 --> 00:03:38.175
Impress your friends,
impress your grandma, but

63
00:03:38.175 --> 00:03:39.960
this way is a bit more simpler.

64
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.590
But if you understand the other
way [SOUND] do that way too.

65
00:03:45.597 --> 00:03:48.216
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Okay, now, another warning,

66
00:03:48.216 --> 00:03:52.872
make sure you log in with your
test user with your SSH key,

67
00:03:52.872 --> 00:03:55.250
just to make sure you can.

68
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.925
You never know.

69
00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:57.434
You might have mistyped something.

70
00:03:57.434 --> 00:04:00.674
So I'm gonna go ahead and
give that a shot.

71
00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:04.096
So I'm gonna exit, I'm gonna exit again.

72
00:04:04.096 --> 00:04:11.251
So I'm gonna say ssh-i my private key,

73
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:16.512
and I'm gonna say test my user

74
00:04:16.512 --> 00:04:23.540
at my IP.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And we're logged in.
