00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.281
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: For
our last section, more or less,

2
00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:06.121
on service security,
let's talk about automatic updates.

3
00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:11.388
Again, one of the biggest vulnerabilities
is the software you're running.

4
00:00:11.388 --> 00:00:14.628
So you say have most of your ports closed,
but

5
00:00:14.628 --> 00:00:19.250
you have a MySQL sever running,
you have a caching proxy setup.

6
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.127
What if one of the software
become vulnerable?

7
00:00:22.127 --> 00:00:24.406
What if someone can connect
to those without root access?

8
00:00:24.406 --> 00:00:28.443
So we always want to keep our software
up to date, because that is the biggest,

9
00:00:28.443 --> 00:00:32.807
probably one of the biggest things you do
about service security, mainly Windows.

10
00:00:32.807 --> 00:00:37.727
Windows is probably the largest offender
of people not keeping their software up

11
00:00:37.727 --> 00:00:38.312
to date.

12
00:00:38.312 --> 00:00:40.305
There's still lots of people
out there running Windows XP,

13
00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:41.330
which is no longer supported.

14
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.022
I was actually in, totally a personal
story, I was in Southern Africa on

15
00:00:45.022 --> 00:00:48.167
vacation a few weeks ago, and
I saw at the border of Botswana,

16
00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:52.223
they're still running Windows XP, and
I was just thinking, man, there's so

17
00:00:52.223 --> 00:00:55.768
many vulnerabilities on this, and
this is customs border control.

18
00:00:55.768 --> 00:00:59.158
So, yeah there's a reason why there's so
many botnets in the world,

19
00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:02.726
most of them are due to Windows, and
people not patching their software.

20
00:01:02.726 --> 00:01:03.415
But we're not going to do that.

21
00:01:03.415 --> 00:01:05.452
We're not going to make the same
mistakes that everybody else did.

22
00:01:05.452 --> 00:01:09.249
We're gonna automatically update
our software on our server.

23
00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:12.750
This can get a little bit complicated,
but it's the easiest way to do it.

24
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.790
Otherwise you have to manually go in,

25
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.050
set up some kind of reoccurring
job to do it for you.

26
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.008
So, there's even a package that do it for
you.

27
00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:24.947
If we apt install unattended-upgrades,
it'll start doing it for you,

28
00:01:24.947 --> 00:01:25.970
which is awesome.

29
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.490
It might already be installed actually,
if you're lucky.

30
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.370
Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't,
seems kind of random.

31
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.255
But if you're watching this in the future,
install unattended-upgrades, and

32
00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:40.759
then we're gonna configure it to
automatically patch our system for us.

33
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.478
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I'm just gonna go ahead and
run that.

34
00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:54.752
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Pseudo apt install.

35
00:01:59.231 --> 00:02:00.720
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,
I've already got it installed.

36
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.303
And most of you,
if you sprung up a new server,

37
00:02:03.303 --> 00:02:07.877
you probably already have installed which
is great, but just in case you don't,

38
00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:12.476
we don't install it as we do with most
packages, so now let's configure it a bit.

39
00:02:12.476 --> 00:02:18.699
So in etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades.

40
00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:19.463
Oops.

41
00:02:19.463 --> 00:02:20.923
File name up here.

42
00:02:20.923 --> 00:02:25.258
These are the defaults, but let's just
make sure, because again, not for

43
00:02:25.258 --> 00:02:29.727
people today people tomorrow and in the
future, this may not be set for you, so

44
00:02:29.727 --> 00:02:31.985
let's just go and make sure it's set.

45
00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:36.906
So add etc/apt/apt.conf.d/
follow upgrades,

46
00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:40.084
and I'm just gonna go and do that.

47
00:02:40.084 --> 00:02:49.363
So,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: 20.

48
00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.699
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, so I just cat
that file, I'm just taking a look.

49
00:02:55.699 --> 00:03:00.320
It's just saying update package list, yes.

50
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.560
Run Unattended-Upgrade, yes.

51
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.492
One is just yes,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right, not too bad,

52
00:03:07.492 --> 00:03:09.080
cuz that's default.

53
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.040
There's a link here to an
Unattended-Upgrades, the debian package.

54
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.631
You can look, there's a lot of
configurations you can do for it,

55
00:03:15.631 --> 00:03:17.530
how often you want it to run,
things like that.

56
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.090
Take a look.

57
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.300
I generally try to include links to
things that I think are interesting.

58
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.010
Maybe you won't think it's interesting,
but it's useful to know.

59
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.640
If you want just a little bit more detail.

60
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.675
So next, this looks complicated,
but these are the defaults.

61
00:03:31.675 --> 00:03:33.530
Let's just common out distro code name.

62
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.227
It just says,
we only want security patches, and

63
00:03:36.227 --> 00:03:38.679
we only want the extended
security patches.

64
00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:41.057
We don't necessarily want to
update our software all the time,

65
00:03:41.057 --> 00:03:42.962
because there could be
a breaking change in there.

66
00:03:42.962 --> 00:03:47.109
We only want security updates,
and that's in the same directory.

67
00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:54.056
So etc/apt/apt.conf.d/
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: 50unattended-upgrades,

68
00:03:54.056 --> 00:03:56.324
and I'm just gonna go ahead and
do that here.

69
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.359
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: [INAUDIBLE]
or at 50, and

70
00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:12.511
I'm just going to comment this line out.

71
00:04:12.511 --> 00:04:13.886
That's it.

72
00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:16.031
So what we're saying is we
want security patches and

73
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:18.520
the extended security maintenance patches,
that's it.

74
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.424
And that's pretty useful.

75
00:04:26.553 --> 00:04:28.840
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And as always,
well commented files.

76
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.804
You can see, you say, these are packages
that I've done something weird.

77
00:04:32.804 --> 00:04:34.099
I've tweaked them a little bit.

78
00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.079
I don't want these packages to be updated.

79
00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:40.726
You can do lots of things with unintended
upgrades, but for now let's just go

80
00:04:40.726 --> 00:04:45.538
the easy paved road, security updates
only, and right-click, that's it.
