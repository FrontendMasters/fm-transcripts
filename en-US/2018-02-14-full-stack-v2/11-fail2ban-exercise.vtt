1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.580
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Let's install Fail2Ban,

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.670
I mentioned that at the end
of class last time.

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.930
Fail2Ban, what it does is it scans your
offlog files, so everybody try to login.

4
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.358
It scans those with rules and
says, if you match this rule,

5
00:00:14.358 --> 00:00:18.541
as in you failed to login within x number
of times in x seconds or minutes or

6
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:21.436
something like that,
we're just gonna ban you.

7
00:00:21.436 --> 00:00:23.927
We're not gonna fail you,
we're not gonna let you log in.

8
00:00:23.927 --> 00:00:27.108
We're not even gonna read anything, we're
just gonna ban you, like ban your IP.

9
00:00:27.108 --> 00:00:30.055
Fail2ban is very useful software,
but it's very tricky,

10
00:00:30.055 --> 00:00:32.038
as you see with this warning right here.

11
00:00:32.038 --> 00:00:34.380
[LAUGH] Big warning.

12
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.050
I have almost locked myself
out of the server before.

13
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.682
So, let's install Fail2ban.

14
00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:42.226
apt install Fail2ban,
the two, the number two.

15
00:00:42.226 --> 00:00:49.732
So, sudo apt install.

16
00:00:49.732 --> 00:00:54.234
Fail2ban.

17
00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:55.740
Yes?

18
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.954
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Question in chat was
why commenting the first line?

19
00:01:01.374 --> 00:01:02.011
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Great question.

20
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:05.199
We're commenting out the first line
because we don't necessarily want all

21
00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.956
the updates that they're gonna
push with unattended upgrades.

22
00:01:07.956 --> 00:01:10.973
We only want security patches.

23
00:01:10.973 --> 00:01:13.006
So let's say nginx makes a change, and

24
00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.298
let's say it even runs
a little bit faster.

25
00:01:15.298 --> 00:01:18.292
We don't necessarily want that because
it could break our existing integration.

26
00:01:18.292 --> 00:01:20.168
That's unlikely, but it could happen.

27
00:01:20.168 --> 00:01:24.338
We only want security patches, so if there
is a vulnerability that exists within,

28
00:01:24.338 --> 00:01:28.210
say, your SH protocol, or something
like that, we want those patches, but

29
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.150
not necessarily all of the latest and
greatest versions.

30
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.622
Great question, though.

31
00:01:35.622 --> 00:01:39.744
All right, Fail2ban.

32
00:01:39.744 --> 00:01:43.794
So now we're going to copy
with the cp command, copy.

33
00:01:43.794 --> 00:01:46.380
We're going to copy the jail comp file.

34
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.855
Jail is just all of the offenders.

35
00:01:48.855 --> 00:01:53.202
It's all the people that tried to
log in when they shouldn't have.

36
00:01:53.202 --> 00:01:56.282
We're going to make a copy of that file
through our jailed.local because we don't

37
00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:59.050
want to change jail.conf,
if it has good defaults in it.

38
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.337
But if we wanna change something,
we do it in our local file,

39
00:02:02.337 --> 00:02:04.468
and those will override our defaults.

40
00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.697
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
I will go ahead and do that too.

41
00:02:13.316 --> 00:02:22.282
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: sudo
cp/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf.

42
00:02:22.282 --> 00:02:29.095
And we're gonna say, copy it to, etc,
fail2ban, we'll call it jail.local.

43
00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.569
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Excellent.

44
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.348
And now, let's just VI that file,
take a look at it.

45
00:02:55.832 --> 00:02:57.420
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Right,
everybody with me so far?

46
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.383
We're in our jail.local file for Fail2Ban.

47
00:03:02.383 --> 00:03:03.787
Excellent.

48
00:03:03.787 --> 00:03:09.140
And again, heavily commented, as a lot
of these files are, it's very useful.

49
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.660
Things we're gonna care about in here.

50
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.320
We're gonna care about ban time.

51
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.071
So 600 seconds is ten minutes.

52
00:03:19.071 --> 00:03:20.376
Yes.

53
00:03:20.376 --> 00:03:24.347
So we're saying, if someone is banned,
they are banned for ten minutes,

54
00:03:24.347 --> 00:03:28.632
where I've gotten myself into trouble
before is I've set the ban time too long,

55
00:03:28.632 --> 00:03:30.732
so some people started to say, a year.

56
00:03:30.732 --> 00:03:32.510
Like you're just permanently banned,
essentially.

57
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.465
Yes, some people just
permanently ban people.

58
00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:39.097
That's dangerous, because let's say you're
trying to log in with your ssh key, but

59
00:03:39.097 --> 00:03:42.149
it turns out you change that at some
point, and you just totally forgot.

60
00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:45.929
If you set, say your max retry to one,
so, you only have one chance to login

61
00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:48.210
correctly and
you set your ban time to a year.

62
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.920
Well, you just locked yourself
out of your server for a year.

63
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.274
You'd have to use a VPN or switch your IP,
somehow and try to login again.

64
00:03:55.274 --> 00:03:57.444
But, if you have the same problem, you're
just going to keep banning, banning,

65
00:03:57.444 --> 00:03:58.281
you're going to run out of IPs.

66
00:03:58.281 --> 00:03:59.500
So.

67
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.630
That's the reason for
the big giant warning here.

68
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.780
If you try to go overboard,

69
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.790
you try to be overzealous with your
security, you can lock yourself out.

70
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.140
Remember, people make mistakes.

71
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.220
You'll make mistakes.

72
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.040
Try to account for that.

73
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.270
So ban time 10 minutes is pretty fine,
is fine.

74
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.036
Max retry is the same.

75
00:04:18.036 --> 00:04:21.550
If you retry within this amount of time,
so, ten minutes, again.

76
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.650
You're going to be banned,
it counts towards your max retries.

77
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.320
And five is fine.

78
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.200
A lot of people said that three,
three is usually pretty good, but

79
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.086
we can leave this alone for now.

80
00:04:31.086 --> 00:04:34.236
If you want to play with it in the future,
feel free, but

81
00:04:34.236 --> 00:04:38.811
again don't be overzealous with your
security, you're gonna have a bad time.

82
00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:41.167
And we're good.
And if we want, for fun,

83
00:04:41.167 --> 00:04:46.543
let's go ahead and tail that Fail2Ban
log and see what's happening.

84
00:04:46.543 --> 00:04:47.925
See if anybody is trying to get in.

85
00:04:47.925 --> 00:04:49.813
Yes.

86
00:04:49.813 --> 00:04:53.291
So tail, Fail2Ban.

87
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:54.388
Oops.

88
00:04:54.388 --> 00:04:55.362
I forgot.

89
00:04:58.608 --> 00:05:00.520
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And
there's nothing really happening.

90
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.645
So later, for fun, if you wanna check your
Fail2Ban, you'll see how many people got

91
00:05:04.645 --> 00:05:08.370
banned, cuz there's bots just running
through, trying to log into your server.

92
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.130
Now we just ban them.

93
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What was that command again?

94
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.560
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: That was tail.

95
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: There it is.

96
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.260
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: dash f.

97
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.883
And fail2ban.log.

98
00:05:18.883 --> 00:05:22.707
Let me [INAUDIBLE].

99
00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:26.887
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: As we learned
in the last course,

100
00:05:26.887 --> 00:05:30.218
tailing your logs is one of the more
useful commands you'll ever know,

101
00:05:30.218 --> 00:05:32.847
because it's a realtime
stream of what's happening.

102
00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:41.836
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, heed my warnings,

103
00:05:41.836 --> 00:05:45.566
they're there because I've
made the mistake before.

104
00:05:45.566 --> 00:05:50.327
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We did have a question
in chat about why we need to copy

105
00:05:50.327 --> 00:05:51.960
a specific sudo.

106
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.390
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah.

107
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.580
Great question,
let me jump back a few slides.

108
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.710
So the question is,
why do we have to copy, back on fail2ban,

109
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.790
why do we have to copy our
jail.conf to our jail.local.

110
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.792
Jail.conf is the default, they're kinda
the default set Fail2ban is gonna use,

111
00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:12.271
we copy them to a local file so
we can modify them.

112
00:06:12.271 --> 00:06:15.312
So, if you start messing with defaults,
things might break.

113
00:06:15.312 --> 00:06:18.390
So, the best bet is always to
make a local copy of the file and

114
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.311
then change just the things we want.

115
00:06:20.311 --> 00:06:22.407
And that keeps everything else the same.

116
00:06:22.407 --> 00:06:25.055
That way, we don't override
any useful settings that we

117
00:06:25.055 --> 00:06:26.611
don't necessarily know about.
