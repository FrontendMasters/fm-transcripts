00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.481
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
we learned lots of things.

2
00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:06.657
We're onto part three, we learned
about server maintenance, updates,

3
00:00:06.657 --> 00:00:08.459
security passes, firewalls.

4
00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.657
Let's talk about shells for a bit.

5
00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:18.540
The shell is the thing we're running, this
is a shell, we're in a shell right now.

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.303
Some people think,
we're talking directly to our kernel,

7
00:00:21.303 --> 00:00:22.821
we're talking directly to our OS.

8
00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:27.185
Not true, we're talking through a series
of other applications that talk to our OS,

9
00:00:27.185 --> 00:00:29.016
because humans are not that smart.

10
00:00:29.016 --> 00:00:32.155
We just couldn't directly
talk to the kernel,

11
00:00:32.155 --> 00:00:34.671
we would mess things up very quickly.

12
00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:37.807
But before going to shells,
I'll cover that a bit later,

13
00:00:37.807 --> 00:00:41.584
let's cover some useful command
lines tools, like we did last time.

14
00:00:41.584 --> 00:00:46.535
We learned VI and ping, and traceroute,
and nmap, let's cover a few more things,

15
00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:48.576
probably the most useful things.

16
00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:51.583
I know I've said that for
every single command we've ever learned.

17
00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:53.437
Because they're all useful, but find and

18
00:00:53.437 --> 00:00:55.560
grep are probably the two
most useful commands.

19
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.628
Because they work on
your regular OSX machine,

20
00:00:58.628 --> 00:01:01.245
they work on most Linux installations.

21
00:01:01.245 --> 00:01:04.876
The two ways of finding
things are find and grep.

22
00:01:04.876 --> 00:01:08.760
Find, it finds file names.

23
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.785
Grep is for file contents.

24
00:01:11.785 --> 00:01:18.490
Some people get a little mixed up with
that, so, find, names, grep, contents.

25
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.480
Find, the anatomy of a find command.

26
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.784
And you're saying, Jem, you don't lay
out any other commands like this,

27
00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:26.394
this is because find is that useful.

28
00:01:26.394 --> 00:01:30.386
It's very fast, if you master find, you
will just be like, where is that one file?

29
00:01:30.386 --> 00:01:32.677
I can look it up because
it has a million options.

30
00:01:32.677 --> 00:01:35.653
But the breakdown of
a find command is find,

31
00:01:35.653 --> 00:01:38.959
the command,
the directory you want to look at.

32
00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:43.421
The option flags you want to pass,
generally name, then the file or

33
00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:45.078
folder you want to find.

34
00:01:45.078 --> 00:01:46.559
Not that tricky, but it's a lot,

35
00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:49.946
it's much more than people are used to
when they talk about searching things.

36
00:01:49.946 --> 00:01:54.911
You just want to search something, find is
a little bit more dense because it's very,

37
00:01:54.911 --> 00:01:55.874
very powerful.

38
00:01:55.874 --> 00:02:00.741
So for instance, if we want to find,
well, before we go to find,

39
00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:04.195
useful options,
right here the option flag.

40
00:02:04.195 --> 00:02:07.222
There's a lot of options you could find,
we could find something by name,

41
00:02:07.222 --> 00:02:08.386
we could find files of type.

42
00:02:08.386 --> 00:02:11.637
We could find empty files,
we could find files by permissions,

43
00:02:11.637 --> 00:02:12.914
which is really useful.

44
00:02:12.914 --> 00:02:17.590
We could say, these are all
the executable files on our file system.

45
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.817
We could find all the things
that are writeable, as in,

46
00:02:20.817 --> 00:02:24.057
these are not just read only,
you can write to them too.

47
00:02:24.057 --> 00:02:26.969
Find is extremely powerful, and
if you learn how to use find,

48
00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.210
you can actually do many,
many, many things.

49
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.176
And I added a link at the bottom to
Lifewire, just a lot of uses of find,

50
00:02:33.176 --> 00:02:34.601
because there are many.

51
00:02:34.601 --> 00:02:37.225
If you think, I'm just looking for
file names, it's way more than that.
