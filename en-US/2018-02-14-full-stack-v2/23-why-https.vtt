00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
next let's talk a little bit about HTTPS.

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.620
What is it?

3
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.424
Why do we care?
Well for the what is it,

4
00:00:09.424 --> 00:00:15.090
let's check out sweet jemyoung.com.

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.179
Wow, amazing, should be a designer.

6
00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.510
Look at that,
it doesn't even scale properly.

7
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.360
But we do have this nice certificate here,
it's HTTPS.

8
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.090
That just means I'm running a severe
connection, no one can man in the middle

9
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.550
attack me, or they can't man in
the middle and change the data outs.

10
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.133
What does man in the middle mean, anybody?

11
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:40.482
Surely you've heard this term
at some point in your careers.

12
00:00:40.482 --> 00:00:43.519
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Not actually going all
the way to the server you think you are,

13
00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.391
instead somebody's intercepting your
traffic and sending something back.

14
00:00:47.391 --> 00:00:51.100
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, that's half,
yes, but that's correct.

15
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.269
So man in the middle is just somebody
sitting in between you and the server.

16
00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.650
Generally in a man in the middle attack,
you read all their data, but

17
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.930
you don't send it back cuz if you do that,
you'll know something's wrong.

18
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.450
The best man in the middle attacks
just let traffic pass through and

19
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.627
they just make a copy of it all.

20
00:01:06.627 --> 00:01:08.176
That's what you can do with regular HTTP.

21
00:01:08.176 --> 00:01:12.322
And it's kind of silly that
the Internet used to be like that,

22
00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:16.486
we used to let credit cards and
things be sent over clear text.

23
00:01:16.486 --> 00:01:19.225
When we use HTTPS, that's all encrypted.

24
00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:23.829
So it's saying I go to jemyoung.com,
I have a certificate and it's signed.

25
00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.633
So think of a giant SSHD,
that's not correct, but

26
00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:29.253
think of it that way,
that giant block of code.

27
00:01:29.253 --> 00:01:32.734
I'm encrypting all my traffic
with that block of code.

28
00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:36.540
I send back a key to the client,
and the client saves that.

29
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.510
So everything then it just handshakes and

30
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.530
says, all right, you are who you say you
are and I can decrypt all this traffic.

31
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.345
And if you try to man in the middle
attack on a HTTPS connection,

32
00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:48.520
it's just gonna be gibberish
cuz it's all encrypted.

33
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.930
That's why we want HTTPS, but
that's the long and short of it.

34
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.520
The better way why you want
HTTPS is because you have to.

35
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.710
[LAUGH] All the good technology,
Web Bluetooth, service workers,

36
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.290
things like that.

37
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.260
Browsers all got together and
said, people need to be HTTPS.

38
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.132
How can we make them do it?

39
00:02:05.132 --> 00:02:07.360
We're just gonna put
the good stuff behind HTTPS.

40
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.320
So you can't run a service work on
your site without being secure.

41
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.840
You can't use Web Bluetooth
without being secure.

42
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.970
Most of the modern technologies
that are coming out now and

43
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.910
in the future, you have to use HTTPS,
so that's kind of why.

44
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.360
Second benefit is you get HTTP/2, which
we're gonna talk about in the end, and

45
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.775
we're gonna set that up as well.

46
00:02:24.775 --> 00:02:29.011
But too long didn't read,
didn't listen, you want HTTPS.

47
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:33.980
And now, it used to be much,
much harder, like months of work.

48
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.480
Now we can do it in not too long,
a few minutes.

49
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.480
It's awesome,
we've come a long from the old way.
