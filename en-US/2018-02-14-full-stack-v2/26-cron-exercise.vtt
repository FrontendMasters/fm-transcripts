00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.590
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So let's make a cron job.

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.580
So to edit a cron job, we open crontab.

3
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.320
Crontab is the file that
has all the cron jobs.

4
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.185
So if you sudo crontab -e,

5
00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:15.057
it's gonna open your cron jobs for

6
00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:20.110
the root users, where we wanna be.

7
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.457
Then in your crontab file if
you add oo 12 [COUGH] **,

8
00:00:25.457 --> 00:00:30.820
we are going to renew,
we want to make sure our, yeah.

9
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.316
Where to back up to.

10
00:00:39.316 --> 00:00:40.304
Yeah.

11
00:00:40.304 --> 00:00:41.580
We're going to make a cron job.

12
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.369
That's what we're doing.

13
00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:47.578
We want our certificate to auto-renew,
because I can't count on anybody to email

14
00:00:47.578 --> 00:00:51.376
me and let me know that my site is
broken and our certificate doesn't work.

15
00:00:51.376 --> 00:00:53.112
So let's just set up a job we let it run,
and

16
00:00:53.112 --> 00:00:54.810
we don't have to worry about it anymore.

17
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.181
That's the beauty of cron jobs.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So

18
00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:03.238
to edit a cron job, we open crontab,
which has our running cron jobs.

19
00:01:03.238 --> 00:01:05.765
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I got us to select

20
00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:06.986
an editor.

21
00:01:06.986 --> 00:01:08.213
I don't know if that
happened to anyone else.

22
00:01:08.213 --> 00:01:11.569
Does it matter, nano, vimbasic?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I'd use Vim,

23
00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:13.913
cuz that's one we've been using.

24
00:01:13.913 --> 00:01:16.797
I think the first time you edit crontab,
it's gonna ask you what editor.

25
00:01:16.797 --> 00:01:17.993
You can use nano.

26
00:01:17.993 --> 00:01:23.438
A lot of people like nano now I think
because it's slightly simpler to vim but,

27
00:01:23.438 --> 00:01:26.489
vim is a standard,
that I like to use so, but

28
00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:29.895
use whatever you're comfortable with,
yeah.

29
00:01:29.895 --> 00:01:33.945
All right so sudo crontab -e and

30
00:01:33.945 --> 00:01:39.200
easiest, even tells you it's easiest.

31
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.903
Say vim.basic.

32
00:01:40.903 --> 00:01:43.481
Cool.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And

33
00:01:43.481 --> 00:01:47.721
as always it has helpful comments to
tell you kind of what the heck you're

34
00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:50.320
doing.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But

35
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.145
I'm just gonna add a new line in here for
our cron job that I want.

36
00:01:55.145 --> 00:01:56.833
So what did I say?

37
00:01:56.833 --> 00:02:02.586
So, uh-oh, 12**1.

38
00:02:02.586 --> 00:02:03.635
Yeah.

39
00:02:03.635 --> 00:02:07.989
And we're gonna run certbot renew.

40
00:02:15.318 --> 00:02:16.691
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right.

41
00:02:16.691 --> 00:02:19.597
Everybody with me, we're understanding
cron jobs, things like that?

42
00:02:22.998 --> 00:02:27.471
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Cool, and let's just, oops.

43
00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:29.655
Let's exit out of here.

44
00:02:29.655 --> 00:02:31.205
Yeah, we're good to go.

45
00:02:31.205 --> 00:02:34.731
And now every Monday at,
what time did I say?

46
00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:36.854
At noon,
it's going to renew my certificate for me.

47
00:02:36.854 --> 00:02:39.776
If it doesn't need to be renewed,
it'll just say you'll need to be

48
00:02:39.776 --> 00:02:42.977
renewed,don't worry about, if it does,
it'll do it automatically.

49
00:02:42.977 --> 00:02:44.455
We don't have to worry about it.

50
00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:49.810
And because ran contabit sudo,
we don't have to sudo cert bot.

51
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.810
I believe, we have our own.

52
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.510
So I have my own cron tab
which runs as my user.

53
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.690
So we wouldn't wanna do that because
we'd have to sudo every single time.

54
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.338
If we did that, it has to refer
password and your jobs are gonna break.

55
00:03:04.338 --> 00:03:08.557
So know the difference between running
something as sudo and know the difference

56
00:03:08.557 --> 00:03:14.130
as running as your regular user.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Right.

57
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.460
We know cron jobs now.

58
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.960
Just think, in the beginning you
don't know what any of this meant and

59
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.950
now you do, it's not that strange.

60
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.640
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: We did have a questions

61
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.240
and shaft.

62
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.030
Is there a command to reset the UFW
backwards default settings to start over

63
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.590
with configuring the firewall.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Let's check.

64
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.863
Let's man UFW, see if there's a reset.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Dry run,

65
00:03:38.863 --> 00:03:43.614
dry run, dry run.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I

66
00:03:43.614 --> 00:03:46.230
saw a reset up top.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Is there a reset?

67
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.070
Actually yeah, why don't we just search.

68
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.680
Okay, yeah.

69
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.630
Sudo ufw reset should reset your firewall.

70
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.423
Great catch.

71
00:03:54.423 --> 00:03:56.348
That's why we use the man page.

72
00:03:56.348 --> 00:04:02.950
Also if you're on a man page if you type
slash for most things you can just search.

73
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.644
That's very helpful too.

74
00:04:04.644 --> 00:04:09.850
And to go next just lower case n,
to go up- upper case n.

75
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.967
You can't see that I'm doing it,
but its upper case and lower case.

76
00:04:13.967 --> 00:04:14.939
Great question though.

77
00:04:17.184 --> 00:04:20.200
All lright, so we have got a cronjob,
we have got our thing running,

78
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.830
we don't have to worry about it anymore,
it is done.

79
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.020
See if it is going to run, it's gonna
keep renewing for us, that's cool.
