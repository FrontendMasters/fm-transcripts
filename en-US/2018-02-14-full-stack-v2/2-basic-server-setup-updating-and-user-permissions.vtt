00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.323
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Everybody here should
have a way to SSH into a server, and

2
00:00:04.323 --> 00:00:06.675
hopefully you have an SSH key.

3
00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:09.525
If you don't, shame on you, you should
have done it for the first one, but

4
00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:11.164
you should have at least one lying around.

5
00:00:11.164 --> 00:00:13.564
So for the first part we're
gonna create a server.

6
00:00:13.564 --> 00:00:17.276
We're gonna do pretty much everything
we did in the first course, but much,

7
00:00:17.276 --> 00:00:17.971
much faster.

8
00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:19.678
Because I don't have to explain anything.

9
00:00:19.678 --> 00:00:23.000
And you'll see that once you do it,
it's actually really easy.

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.090
A few people here were saying, it was so

11
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.760
great bringing up the server, because
it was so much easier than I thought.

12
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.990
And it is, sort of, [LAUGH] as long as you
follow the paved road on how to do it.

13
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.297
So let's go ahead and bring up the server.

14
00:00:36.297 --> 00:00:40.480
So on DigitalOcean, or Amazon, or
whatever your preferred provider.

15
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.981
I like DigitalOcean, they have probably
one of the best user interfaces for

16
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:45.137
bringing up the server.

17
00:00:45.137 --> 00:00:49.869
Amazon is pretty ugly,
but use whatever you want.

18
00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:51.105
We'll be using DigitalOcean today.

19
00:00:51.105 --> 00:00:53.671
We're gonna create a new Ubuntu server.

20
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:58.267
Be sure to use Ubuntu 16.04 dot whatever,
doesn't matter.

21
00:00:58.267 --> 00:01:01.165
If you're watching this a year from now,
it doesn't matter,

22
00:01:01.165 --> 00:01:02.652
16.04 is the LTS version.

23
00:01:02.652 --> 00:01:04.669
That means it's gonna be supported for
at least two years.

24
00:01:04.669 --> 00:01:07.065
That's the version we're
gonna stick with today.

25
00:01:07.065 --> 00:01:09.376
We used 16.10 in the last class,

26
00:01:09.376 --> 00:01:14.229
only cuz the node set up was slightly
easier, but that's now been deprecated.

27
00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.398
So now we're all gonna use 16.04,
cuz I know it will be around for

28
00:01:17.398 --> 00:01:18.323
at least two years.

29
00:01:18.323 --> 00:01:21.157
And when you bring up that server
be sure to use an SSH key.

30
00:01:22.846 --> 00:01:27.361
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And I'll give you a minute,
and then I will go ahead and do that.

31
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:29.597
Just to make sure we are all
doing the same page, but

32
00:01:29.597 --> 00:01:31.781
it's fairly straightforward
in DigitalOcean.

33
00:01:31.781 --> 00:01:34.632
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can I use
a local server on my machine?

34
00:01:34.632 --> 00:01:37.271
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah totally, yeah.

35
00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:41.881
I found the satisfaction of creating
something that you can show your mom or

36
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:42.546
whoever.

37
00:01:42.546 --> 00:01:44.090
But, yeah you can use a local server.

38
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.162
You will run into trouble when
we get to the HTTPS part, so

39
00:01:47.162 --> 00:01:50.752
you won't be able to install
a certificate on your local machine.

40
00:01:50.752 --> 00:01:52.769
You can, but
it won't be a real certificate,

41
00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:54.443
it'll be kind of a fake certificate.

42
00:01:54.443 --> 00:02:02.876
So I would encourage you to bring up
a new server, but it's your call.

43
00:02:02.876 --> 00:02:07.739
If you've already brought up a server
before on 16.04 you can chill.

44
00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:09.829
I kind of encourage you
to bring up a fresh one,

45
00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.986
just in case you installed
something strange.

46
00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:14.406
Cuz again,
we're all following the same path, and

47
00:02:14.406 --> 00:02:16.007
I don't know what you did before.

48
00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:19.479
But if you have confidence that
I can fix it, that's cool too.

49
00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:20.890
I believe in independence.

50
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.098
You don't have to listen
to every word I say.

51
00:02:23.098 --> 00:02:24.119
Actually, you do.

52
00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:25.979
You're kind of stuck here [LAUGH].

53
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.520
And while that's happening, it takes
a few seconds to bring up a new server,

54
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.540
if you have a domain, if you've already
bought one, they're pretty cheap now,

55
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.440
there are some for like $1.

56
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.100
Point your domain to the new server.

57
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.340
We have to do it now ahead of time.

58
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.550
We're probably going to cover HTTPS
after lunch, but we want to do it now,

59
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.310
because the, yeah,
why do we have to do it?

60
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.558
I explained this on the first one.

61
00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:50.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It takes time to resolve
on the physical machine sync up.

62
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.000
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, DNS takes time to
resolve across the entire world, so

63
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.628
we're gonna point the domain
to a new server now, and

64
00:02:58.628 --> 00:03:02.993
there's a link to part one if you
need to remember how to do that.

65
00:03:02.993 --> 00:03:05.892
But we wanna do that now,
because we're gonna create HTTPS,

66
00:03:05.892 --> 00:03:09.202
we're gonna create that nice,
cool lock arrow for your domain name.

67
00:03:09.202 --> 00:03:10.782
But we have to do it now.

68
00:03:10.782 --> 00:03:17.108
Okay, just gonna do a quick
show of how we do that.

69
00:03:17.108 --> 00:03:21.382
So if anybody wants to bring up,
hopefully you follow the steps already.

70
00:03:21.382 --> 00:03:27.415
But you click Create Joblet in
DigitalOcean and pick your data center.

71
00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:30.130
Pick whichever one is closest to you,
naturally.

72
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.183
We're kind of in the middle,
so let's pick New York.

73
00:03:32.183 --> 00:03:34.844
It's probably slightly
faster than San Francisco.

74
00:03:34.844 --> 00:03:38.418
And if I want to add the ssh key,
we just click that and

75
00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:41.762
then you give it a name
which I've already done.

76
00:03:41.762 --> 00:03:45.138
I already have one that I brought
up earlier just to make sure.

77
00:03:45.138 --> 00:03:51.990
Actually, just like I point my IP
address to my new domain cuz I'm lazy.

78
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.790
Super lazy.

79
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.470
And once you're in your server as root,
you log in as root.

80
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.360
Let's give you a heads up.

81
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.570
Don't move on to the next step yet.

82
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.640
We will do it all together.

83
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.033
As you will probably remember when
you create the ssh key, there,

84
00:04:08.033 --> 00:04:10.159
why won't you go, there we go.

85
00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.380
If you say pwd,
that's print working directory,

86
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.336
this is all my local machine now,
I'm not logged in to a server yet.

87
00:04:15.336 --> 00:04:20.109
I always switch to the ssh folder because
it's slightly shorter for me to type.

88
00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.582
So to remember how to log
in is ssh -i to use my key.

89
00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:30.561
It's my private key I'm using,
and I'm gonna say root.

90
00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:33.515
Gotta remember what my server IP is.

91
00:04:33.515 --> 00:04:34.817
Just gonna copy that.

92
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.587
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Root at, [NOISE], and yes.

93
00:04:43.587 --> 00:04:46.130
Right, that was easy, right?

94
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.847
We spent so
much time setting up a server and

95
00:04:47.847 --> 00:04:50.676
talking about how to set up a server and
then you do it in three minutes.

96
00:04:50.676 --> 00:04:53.713
That's what it's all about,
it's getting faster and faster and faster.

97
00:04:53.713 --> 00:04:55.702
Everyone logged into their server?

98
00:04:55.702 --> 00:04:59.055
You will have a hard time if you're not
logged in to your server past this point.

99
00:05:00.792 --> 00:05:03.293
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Okay, no response is a yes.

100
00:05:03.293 --> 00:05:07.192
Let me make

101
00:05:07.192 --> 00:05:12.391
this bigger,

102
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:16.730
all right.

103
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:17.730
All right, can you see in the back?

104
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.825
All right, cool, perfect.

105
00:05:21.825 --> 00:05:24.330
All right, step 4.

106
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.161
Let's update our server,
how do we update our server?

107
00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:31.509
Remind me, I'm getting old,
I forget things.

108
00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:32.472
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Apt update.

109
00:05:32.472 --> 00:05:37.583
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, so we don't have
to sudo, because we're already

110
00:05:37.583 --> 00:05:43.800
as the super user, so we're just
gonna say apt update, all right.

111
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.125
Next, let's actually,
we just pulled down everything.

112
00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:50.312
Think of, the correct analogy
is think of like a get repo,

113
00:05:50.312 --> 00:05:53.904
we're just pulling it down but
we haven't merged anything yet.

114
00:05:53.904 --> 00:05:56.675
We just have references to
the things we want to do.

115
00:05:56.675 --> 00:06:00.399
So let's say apt upgrade.

116
00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:03.969
Yes, we're gonna upgrade
all of our local libraries.

117
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.530
Right now, you're sitting there thinking,
you're thinking, why am I here on Friday?

118
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.270
I could do like so much better things.

119
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.510
That's what you're thinking.

120
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.171
But, and the second thing you're
thinking is, why are we using apt and

121
00:06:16.171 --> 00:06:18.770
not apt-get,
cuz we've always used apt-get.

122
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.190
In fact all my slides, install this one,
doesn't really matter.

123
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.510
All of my slides on the last
one were all apt-get.

124
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.000
Well, I'm glad you were thinking that,
cuz I was thinking that too.

125
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.720
Apt-get is, think of it as the
programmer's way of updating a repository.

126
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.990
It's consistent,
it doesn't have any fanciness to it.

127
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.430
It's always gonna have
the same style of output, so

128
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.299
you can programmatically
create scripts against it.

129
00:06:42.299 --> 00:06:45.600
Apt is the friendlier user,

130
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.570
the friendlier user interface
way of creating your repo's.

131
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.870
They do the same thing,
except apt can change in the future.

132
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:52.750
It's just a little bit nicer.

133
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.460
It has those nice progress
bars that apt doesn't have.

134
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.861
That's pretty much the key difference, but

135
00:06:57.861 --> 00:07:01.094
I'm glad you were thinking that
cuz I was thinking that too.

136
00:07:01.094 --> 00:07:04.035
All right, let's add a new user.

137
00:07:04.035 --> 00:07:07.251
You can call it test, you can call it
friend or master, it doesn't matter.

138
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:11.707
I'm gonna say test, just for
the sake of simplicity.

139
00:07:11.707 --> 00:07:15.045
So adduser test.

140
00:07:15.045 --> 00:07:17.964
Let me give it a pretty simple
password for this time around.

141
00:07:21.937 --> 00:07:26.835
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Next, let's make sure that
our new test user has sudo permission.

142
00:07:26.835 --> 00:07:34.241
So we're gonna say, usermod -aG sudo test.

143
00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:38.209
Awesome, so
our test user now has sudo permissions.

144
00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:43.033
So let's switch over,
su, switch user, test.

145
00:07:43.033 --> 00:07:46.708
And I'm just gonna cd,
that's my home directory.

146
00:07:46.708 --> 00:07:50.716
I mean, /home/test, or slash home,
whatever you made your user.

147
00:07:50.716 --> 00:07:55.840
And I just want to check to
see that I have permission.

148
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.660
So I'm going to say /var/log/auth.log.

149
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.110
It's gonna ask for your password.

150
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.010
All right, so I can sudo things.

151
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.110
Pretty important.

152
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.860
Once we, we're gonna lock the root account
so you can't log in as root anymore.

153
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.120
So you wanna make sure
you have sudo access,

154
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.920
otherwise you're gonna have a bad time.

155
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.540
And you'll start over again.
