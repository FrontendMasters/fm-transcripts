00:00:00.171 --> 00:00:02.834
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Now let's talk about
something with a really cool name.

2
00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:05.635
Firewalls, that's a cool name.

3
00:00:05.635 --> 00:00:08.660
So what is a firewall?

4
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.879
Someone tell me other than
a cool sounding security name.

5
00:00:14.016 --> 00:00:15.120
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Nothing, nobody?

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.136
Nobody can tell me what a firewall is,
come on, people, you're engineers.

7
00:00:20.136 --> 00:00:21.376
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A layer of protection.

8
00:00:21.376 --> 00:00:22.119
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, [LAUGH],

9
00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.016
that's pretty good.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

10
00:00:24.016 --> 00:00:25.865
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: A firewall is just a way of

11
00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:27.545
blocking your ports.

12
00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:31.524
So on any given computer, you have ports,
ways of connecting into that machine,

13
00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:33.956
the OS, or the network layer,
things like that.

14
00:00:33.956 --> 00:00:36.891
Firewall just says, nah,
bro, I don't know you,

15
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:40.047
it just prevents people from
connecting to open ports.

16
00:00:40.047 --> 00:00:44.425
Right now we have probably about one open
port on our machine, that's port 22,

17
00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:45.195
the SSH port.

18
00:00:45.195 --> 00:00:46.817
We have that open through the firewall.

19
00:00:46.817 --> 00:00:49.858
If we close that port,
we would not be able to SSH because

20
00:00:49.858 --> 00:00:53.574
the machine's just going to reject
all the incoming connections.

21
00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:57.620
Firewall, can't believe you don't
know what a firewall is, man,

22
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.618
I'm embarrassed for you, no,
it's okay, we're here to learn.

23
00:01:01.618 --> 00:01:07.130
In a building, a firewall is the wall that
prevents a fire from coming through it.

24
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.219
Totally unrelated to this course
whatsoever, but firewall's a cool name.

25
00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:16.211
So we talked about blocking ports,
how do we know what ports are open

26
00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:20.600
on our machine right now,
what's the easiest way to do it?

27
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.072
It's a tool called nmap, and
nmap is a very useful tool.

28
00:01:24.072 --> 00:01:29.547
So on your local machine,
mind you, your local machine,

29
00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:34.700
not your server,
let's nmap against your server IP.

30
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.315
Everybody, local machine, not your sever,

31
00:01:39.315 --> 00:01:44.535
just in case, so
I'm going to switch to a new shell.

32
00:01:44.535 --> 00:01:49.951
First let me get my IP.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Bloop,

33
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:54.910
and we're on nmap.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And

34
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.072
we have one open port,
that's our port 22 or SSH port.

35
00:01:59.072 --> 00:02:03.048
That's great, that's the way it should be,
everybody with me so far?

36
00:02:03.048 --> 00:02:06.902
We ran nmap against our server IP.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: How can we install that

37
00:02:06.902 --> 00:02:11.009
command if we don't have it?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Try brew install if you have

38
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.792
Homebrew, nmap.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Did it find it?

39
00:02:17.792 --> 00:02:18.592
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's thinking about it.

40
00:02:18.592 --> 00:02:21.552
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: [LAUGH] Awesome.

41
00:02:21.552 --> 00:02:25.466
Yeah, if you have Homebrew on, and
you are running OSX, run nmap,

42
00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:27.471
Windows, I am not sure honestly.

43
00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:31.881
But there's probably a tool out there,
a port scanning tool, and

44
00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:36.159
this is always a useful tool,
it's more useful than you think.

45
00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.688
So why is it useful?

46
00:02:37.688 --> 00:02:40.878
I'm going to tell you
a tale from real life,

47
00:02:40.878 --> 00:02:44.167
this happened to me three or
four months ago.

48
00:02:44.167 --> 00:02:47.383
So I live in a big apartment
complex in San Francisco, and

49
00:02:47.383 --> 00:02:49.063
I have really fast Internet.

50
00:02:49.063 --> 00:02:51.671
But the problem is, my connection
will always be getting dropped,

51
00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.202
like all the time, I think there's
just too much interference.

52
00:02:54.202 --> 00:02:58.918
So I decided to get a new router, but
not just a new router, a new fancy,

53
00:02:58.918 --> 00:02:59.951
shiny router.

54
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:01.642
These plug into individual ports and

55
00:03:01.642 --> 00:03:04.269
they kind of broadcast signal
throughout my apartment.

56
00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.210
And they signal hop and
it's really, really cool.

57
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.246
But when I logged in, I first got
everything set up, it has an app,

58
00:03:12.246 --> 00:03:15.937
I logged in, I said,
it showed a weird device on my network.

59
00:03:15.937 --> 00:03:17.713
And I didn't know what that was.

60
00:03:17.713 --> 00:03:21.398
And honestly, if you note the time, it's
at 2:48 in the morning because I was that

61
00:03:21.398 --> 00:03:23.229
excited to get my Internet up and running.

62
00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:26.547
And then I see that there's
an IP camera on my network,

63
00:03:26.547 --> 00:03:30.166
and that kind of freaked me out,
because I'm like, what?

64
00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:31.062
What is happening here?

65
00:03:31.062 --> 00:03:36.189
Like, there's a camera in my, connected
to my home router, my encrypted network?

66
00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:37.821
So, what did I do?

67
00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:41.364
Well first I freaked out for a bit,
because I looked for a camera, but

68
00:03:41.364 --> 00:03:44.922
then I thought, no, I'm an engineer,
what kind of tools can I use?

69
00:03:44.922 --> 00:03:48.661
Well, I can get the IP address from my
app, it tells me the local IP address,

70
00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:51.184
because it's connected
to my network obviously.

71
00:03:51.184 --> 00:03:54.667
So I ran nmap against that IP address,
and in general,

72
00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:58.090
192.168 are almost always local addresses.

73
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.018
I think they're always local addresses,
so I ran it against that.

74
00:04:02.018 --> 00:04:06.090
It told me that there is two open ports,
8099 and 9080.

75
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.792
Those aren't very common ports
that I know about, but I thought,

76
00:04:09.792 --> 00:04:11.453
let's see what's going on.

77
00:04:11.453 --> 00:04:13.940
So naturally I tried to curl
into one of those ports,

78
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.024
just to see if it returns anything, maybe
it's a web server running, I don't know.

79
00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:20.112
Nothing, it didn't give me anything.

80
00:04:20.112 --> 00:04:26.499
So next I tried it on 9080, and it gave
me something back, which is interesting.

81
00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:31.588
This just gave me back a regular
200 response, standard HTTP, okay.

82
00:04:31.588 --> 00:04:34.958
Not really that useful, because I tried
connecting to my browser to see if it was

83
00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.586
going to give me anything, nothing.

84
00:04:36.586 --> 00:04:38.730
So what did I do next?

85
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.611
I ran nmap dash s, dash v, and
what that did is it showed me,

86
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:46.662
it's actually my smart TV that
was miscategorized by my app.

87
00:04:46.662 --> 00:04:51.386
It was actually just my Visio TV, but
again, because I knew these tools,

88
00:04:51.386 --> 00:04:53.382
it's just tales of real life.

89
00:04:53.382 --> 00:04:56.647
You never know when just knowing these
tiny little tools are going to help you.

90
00:04:56.647 --> 00:05:01.591
Nmap.s/v, this is just going to tell me
the software OS, if it can determine that,

91
00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:03.251
and just all the info it can.

92
00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:08.044
Pretty useful to keep me from freaking
out, I sent a very nasty email to them.

93
00:05:08.044 --> 00:05:11.794
[LAUGH] It's not cool saying there
is a camera connected to my network.

94
00:05:11.794 --> 00:05:14.761
But anyways, nmap, it's a useful tool,
not just for port scanning,

95
00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:17.190
if you just want to know what's
going on with the machine.
