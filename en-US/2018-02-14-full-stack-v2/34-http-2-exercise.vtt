00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.540
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So my list of lock,
I'm gonna edit my size available,

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.630
and add HB2 in there.

3
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:13.036
So, sudo vi slash
etc/nginx/sites-available/defaults.

4
00:00:20.797 --> 00:00:25.019
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Three, there we go.

5
00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.547
And send Http 2, cool.

6
00:00:31.547 --> 00:00:33.776
And, if you see the comments in here,
managed by cert bot,

7
00:00:33.776 --> 00:00:35.793
these are the automated
things that cert bot puts in.

8
00:00:35.793 --> 00:00:39.354
Remember, we said it does all this
hand shaking and things for you.

9
00:00:39.354 --> 00:00:40.282
That's for you.

10
00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:44.986
So if you see these lines, generally
try not to mess with it too much, but

11
00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:46.231
it should be okay.

12
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:49.996
And so,
I'm no gonna restart my server yet,

13
00:00:49.996 --> 00:00:54.466
because I wanna make sure
this is working correctly.

14
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:58.113
So if we say cats, because that's
the one with all those on it.

15
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.555
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It's cache from disk.

16
00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:07.045
So, let me disable cache, and
let's make sure the cache is empty.

17
00:01:09.447 --> 00:01:13.364
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So that's pretty good,
that's 1.12 seconds, that's not bad.

18
00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:15.313
Let's see if HTTP2 will speed this up a bit,

19
00:01:15.313 --> 00:01:18.139
because these are large files
being sent in multiple chunks.

20
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.000
And so,
sanity check myself in nginx dash t.

21
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.100
Looks good.

22
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.090
Sudo service nginx restart.

23
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.320
All right.
And, let's give this another whirl,

24
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.330
all right, slightly faster,

25
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.640
we shaved off maybe 0.2 seconds give or
take.

26
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.700
That is not bad, you're not going to
see monumental gains using HB2, but

27
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.570
it is marginally faster, and marginally
faster is better than not faster at all,

28
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.420
and it depends on what you are using.

29
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.827
In this instance,
when I was running it last night,

30
00:01:55.827 --> 00:01:58.138
I was able to shave off
like 600 milliseconds.

31
00:01:58.138 --> 00:02:00.534
For this instance, I don't know why,
but it's not going as fast.

32
00:02:00.534 --> 00:02:05.340
If you trying to tell
the protocol in tools.

33
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.310
You've said the protocol in there that
says H2, this means it's running HB2.

34
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.277
You may have to add things to the menu.

35
00:02:14.277 --> 00:02:16.092
Yeah you may have to add it
to the menu if you don't see

36
00:02:18.553 --> 00:02:20.506
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But that's HTTP 2.

37
00:02:24.576 --> 00:02:27.032
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Nice, so
that was faster, 800 milliseconds.

38
00:02:27.032 --> 00:02:28.655
That's about right.

39
00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:30.261
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Support HTTP 2?

40
00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:31.341
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes.

41
00:02:31.341 --> 00:02:33.019
They do now.

42
00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:33.938
Good question though.

43
00:02:33.938 --> 00:02:36.726
All right.

44
00:02:36.726 --> 00:02:37.304
Questions?

45
00:02:37.304 --> 00:02:41.153
That was probably the easiest
implementation we've done and

46
00:02:41.153 --> 00:02:42.268
we've paid off.

47
00:02:42.268 --> 00:02:46.341
Yeah, that's much faster now, 864.

48
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:51.185
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Where did
you put your 443 see that,

49
00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:58.150
mine is doing an error
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: It is in the this box,

50
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.780
so it is by the, it is within here,
same virtual host configuration.

51
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.650
It is probably at the bottom.

52
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.605
Here you should see managed by Certbot as,
I just saw a http2 in

53
00:03:09.605 --> 00:03:15.240
there.Yeah.

54
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.070
I just want to.

55
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.130
I don't think enough people believe.

56
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.110
Some of them take out HB2 and reload.

57
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.230
Just to make sure I'm right.

58
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.427
Gonna try this again.

59
00:03:27.427 --> 00:03:32.685
900, 700,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: it's

60
00:03:32.685 --> 00:03:38.242
way faster now

61
00:03:38.242 --> 00:03:42.876
[SOUND]
Two.

62
00:03:42.876 --> 00:03:46.792
Cool.

63
00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:47.414
All right.

64
00:03:47.414 --> 00:03:49.810
We are do well.

65
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.630
You now have as modern a website
as I know how to make it.

66
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.530
Sounds where bluetooth and
service workers.

67
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.200
You are on the cutting edge right now and

68
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.100
most websites are not even here so
good job everybody.

69
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.630
So now, yeah,

70
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.077
I'm just a service H2 as you're
saying the right particles at http1.1
