00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:01.952
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Okay, so
we're up and running.

2
00:00:01.952 --> 00:00:03.446
What was the next task?

3
00:00:03.446 --> 00:00:04.854
Add a domain name.

4
00:00:04.854 --> 00:00:08.084
Okay, I can do that.

5
00:00:08.084 --> 00:00:11.752
And we're adding domain name just to make
it easier cuz we're gonna use something

6
00:00:11.752 --> 00:00:13.784
called certbot to make a certificate for
us.

7
00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:16.496
And it does nginx configuration for
you, which is awesome.

8
00:00:16.496 --> 00:00:18.960
But first we need to
edit our nginx config so

9
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.960
it knows where to make a certificate for.

10
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.470
So I'm just gonna say oops,

11
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.501
sudo vi
/etc/nginx/sites-available/defaults.

12
00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:37.013
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: On the bottom and

13
00:00:37.013 --> 00:00:39.926
the top.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, we should be good, so

14
00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:45.815
let's edit the server name.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And I'm going to say,

15
00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:50.456
jem.party, yeah, www.jem.party.

16
00:00:50.456 --> 00:00:53.577
Obviously, use your own domain.

17
00:00:53.577 --> 00:00:54.300
If you're using jem.party, don't know why.

18
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.598
I love the party domain.

19
00:00:57.598 --> 00:01:00.211
I don't know why it's the real thing.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

20
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:00.912
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: I feel like it's the end

21
00:01:00.912 --> 00:01:01.444
of the Internet.

22
00:01:01.444 --> 00:01:04.123
We're just like, yeah,
let's ma domain to that, but whatever,

23
00:01:04.123 --> 00:01:08.330
jem.party.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Everybody with me?

24
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.670
I added the server name configuration.

25
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.520
It's usually just an underscore blank.

26
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.210
I think I have a slide for it.

27
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.621
I do.

28
00:01:15.621 --> 00:01:18.806
So just add a server name,
don't forget the semicolon.

29
00:01:18.806 --> 00:01:22.500
Don't know why I didn't put
a semicolon in there, semicolon.

30
00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:30.143
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right, cool.

31
00:01:30.143 --> 00:01:34.654
And let's go ahead and reload nginx again.

32
00:01:34.654 --> 00:01:37.466
And we're still good.

33
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:38.754
And what was the last step?

34
00:01:38.754 --> 00:01:42.308
It was open port 443.

35
00:01:42.308 --> 00:01:49.531
So let's say, sudo ufw allow 443.

36
00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:56.895
Cool.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Let's try to do the rules.

37
00:01:56.895 --> 00:02:04.553
Look at the man page.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Status,

38
00:02:04.553 --> 00:02:05.804
that's what I wanted.

39
00:02:05.804 --> 00:02:07.853
ufw status.

40
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:16.371
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And let's bring it up.

41
00:02:25.377 --> 00:02:26.958
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes.

42
00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:27.782
Aborted?

43
00:02:27.782 --> 00:02:33.446
Why?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Maybe I

44
00:02:33.446 --> 00:02:35.041
didn't add nginx rule.

45
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:38.895
sudo ufw allow ssh,

46
00:02:38.895 --> 00:02:43.516
yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Just

47
00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:48.590
make sure our firewall is properly config.

48
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:57.226
Binary set status, yeah.

49
00:03:08.378 --> 00:03:11.557
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Cool, so now should

50
00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:16.410
be,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right,

51
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.592
it's showing our open ports,
if you have sudo uwf status.

52
00:03:20.592 --> 00:03:27.310
If you haven't brought ufw up,
so sudo ufw enable to start ufw.

53
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.430
Otherwise, it's gonna fall back
to the default IP table rules.

54
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.730
Which are pretty good, but we wanna switch
over to the Uncomplicated Firewall.

55
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.610
And we see we have port 443,
which is HTTPS port.

56
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.950
We have port 22, it's SSH.

57
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.070
Then we have IPv6, the rules for

58
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.925
those as well.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right,

59
00:03:47.925 --> 00:03:49.950
we all good so far.

60
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.629
Any questions?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right,

61
00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.140
cool, and we added our server name.

62
00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.353
This will just make it easier in
the future when we add the certbot to it.
