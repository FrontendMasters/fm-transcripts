00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.947
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So I want to
Proxy Traffic Service to my Node Server.

2
00:00:02.947 --> 00:00:04.019
How do I do that?

3
00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.162
Anyone remember?

4
00:00:06.187 --> 00:00:11.438
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Nobody?

5
00:00:11.438 --> 00:00:12.566
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Default.

6
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:13.944
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, default.

7
00:00:13.944 --> 00:00:18.240
So say sudo, actually, I will just cd
into it, so you can take a look at it.

8
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.630
Sudo/etc/nginx, LS all configuration for
EngineX.

9
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.640
So, let's see into sites available
where the config file lies.

10
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.594
LS, there's only one file.

11
00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:29.856
Default.

12
00:00:29.856 --> 00:00:31.661
The default?

13
00:00:31.661 --> 00:00:32.564
Right.

14
00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:36.170
EngineX configuration.

15
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.610
So, I want a proxy traffic
to my node server.

16
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.620
So instead of location/.

17
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.220
So you bang.

18
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.010
I forgot the sudo that's.

19
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.540
So all the traffic coming to my root.

20
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.770
So just /akajem.party with
no extra path on there.

21
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.497
I just want to proxy that to node.

22
00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:07.840
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So that is proxy pass reset.

23
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.459
Proxy pass directive.

24
00:01:11.518 --> 00:01:15.380
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And I want to say,
you're running on localhost.

25
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.124
So, 127.0.0.1 Port 3001.

26
00:01:22.124 --> 00:01:24.302
That looks about right.

27
00:01:24.302 --> 00:01:26.760
Yeah, that looks right.

28
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.572
Oops.

29
00:01:27.572 --> 00:01:29.351
Not proxy directive.

30
00:01:29.351 --> 00:01:34.506
[SOUND] Proxy pass.

31
00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:35.627
Cool.

32
00:01:35.627 --> 00:01:40.176
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: In this case,
it is the set over on the digitalation.

33
00:01:40.176 --> 00:01:41.283
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: No.

34
00:01:41.283 --> 00:01:47.280
So, we're proxying to our local
server on your local box.

35
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.017
Also, right now you are on your server.

36
00:01:49.017 --> 00:01:51.193
We are editing the nginx configuration,

37
00:01:51.193 --> 00:01:54.685
on the server that we've been
working on for the past few minutes.

38
00:01:54.685 --> 00:01:56.744
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: No, I kind of stuck.

39
00:01:56.744 --> 00:01:57.627
But I'm not on the [INAUDIBLE].

40
00:01:57.627 --> 00:01:58.579
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Okay.

41
00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.955
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So
this address is Digital Ocean server?

42
00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:04.600
No this [CROSS TALK] address.

43
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.380
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So, you should be editing
the nginx configuration on your server

44
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.870
right now?

45
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I am doing
it on just the lotion.

46
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.600
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Your nginx configuration?

47
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

48
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.580
I installed nginx on digital lotion.

49
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.780
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Okay.

50
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: On the server.

51
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.910
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: The digital lotion server.

52
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah.

53
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.961
So, we are on digital lotion right now.

54
00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:23.919
Not our local Machine.

55
00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:25.466
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I think you
are on the same page.

56
00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:28.791
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Okay, yeah,
[CROSSTALK] saying different things.

57
00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:30.618
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So,
this local is the DigitalOcean local?

58
00:02:30.618 --> 00:02:31.184
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes.

59
00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:32.076
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

60
00:02:32.076 --> 00:02:35.153
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, sorry, when you say
DigitalOcean I'm like, how'd you do that?

61
00:02:35.153 --> 00:02:36.241
You are better than me.

62
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:41.541
Yes, and remember from the last course,
127.0.0.1 is just local host,

63
00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:44.277
which is the same as
the loop back command.

64
00:02:44.277 --> 00:02:46.132
So that iss just saying, whoever we are,

65
00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:49.052
we're just gonna point back to
our own port, which is 3001.

66
00:02:49.052 --> 00:02:51.805
That is our default port.

67
00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:52.606
Okay.

68
00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:55.180
Any questions so far?

69
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.367
Cool.

70
00:02:57.367 --> 00:03:00.605
And useful command to make sure
we typed everything right.

71
00:03:00.605 --> 00:03:05.583
If we say nginx -t
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Perfect, it is gonna

72
00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:08.649
run our configuration file, and
it is gonna just do a quick validation for

73
00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.120
us to make sure we did
not mistype anything.

74
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.620
Very useful command, because sometimes
you'll try to restart nginx, and

75
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.410
it just won't work.

76
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.475
So let me just make
a quick error to show you.

77
00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:24.419
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Let me just
comment out this block.

78
00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:30.354
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Oops, wrong syntax.

79
00:03:31.596 --> 00:03:39.036
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And nginx is telling me
that it's expecting a closing bracket.

80
00:03:39.036 --> 00:03:43.878
Pretty useful command,
if you ever make some changes to Nginx,

81
00:03:43.878 --> 00:03:46.486
which, we are about to make a lot.

82
00:03:46.486 --> 00:03:52.610
And this is not working and
the next very useful,

83
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.489
very nice Just going to
uncomment this again.

84
00:04:00.484 --> 00:04:05.458
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cool, so
now let us restart nginx sudo service.

85
00:04:05.458 --> 00:04:07.185
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Nginx restart.

86
00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:09.769
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right.

87
00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:16.053
But, right now we haven't
done anything yet.

88
00:04:16.053 --> 00:04:19.509
So, if you are trying to hit
it locally probably wont work,

89
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.664
because we haven't done anything.

90
00:04:21.664 --> 00:04:23.348
We haven't started our node server yet.

91
00:04:23.348 --> 00:04:24.639
So let's go ahead and bring that up now.

92
00:04:28.011 --> 00:04:31.380
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So to do that,
let's switch to our /var/www directory.

93
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.450
And lets cd fe.

94
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.110
Is everybody with me?

95
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.900
We are now on our get
repo that we just cloned.

96
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.490
Hopefully, it installed
all the node modules.

97
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.700
So, now let's use forever.

98
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.640
The very useful command.

99
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.540
We'll say forever start.

100
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.730
And our app is just called app.js,
and it's up and running.

101
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.550
Nothing to it.

102
00:04:59.068 --> 00:05:01.387
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Everybody with me so far?

103
00:05:01.387 --> 00:05:07.243
Yeah, so now let us go ahead and try to
hit our brand new server from our box.

104
00:05:07.243 --> 00:05:09.485
We are gonna have to use IP.

105
00:05:09.485 --> 00:05:12.050
Because we haven't hooked anything up yet.

106
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.465
Maybe we did.

107
00:05:14.465 --> 00:05:15.245
Let's give it a shot.

108
00:05:16.976 --> 00:05:17.989
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right.

109
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.791
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: We're up and running, and

110
00:05:20.791 --> 00:05:23.949
hopefully I pointed this to
the right address so, yes.

111
00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.737
jam.party is now pointed to my server.

112
00:05:27.737 --> 00:05:28.808
Is anybody lost so far?

113
00:05:28.808 --> 00:05:34.080
I notice some people having
some trouble setting

114
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.776
up their A records pointing to
their domains of their server.

115
00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:43.619
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: No problems?

116
00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:47.493
Wow,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Guy's we are on it.

117
00:05:47.493 --> 00:05:52.665
All right,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah,

118
00:05:54.952 --> 00:05:56.147
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Not, yeah,

119
00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:59.626
not a whole lot happened here yet, but

120
00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:06.680
soon we will make magic using just Nginx,
it's going to be great.

121
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.110
And remember if you're having
trouble how to set records,

122
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.230
how to point a domain to from an IP,
in A record,

123
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.738
we're gonna use host@, then we are going
to use that's gonna be jump a party,

124
00:06:18.738 --> 00:06:22.909
dub dub dub.jam that party, and we're
just pointing it out to an IP address.

125
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.790
And if you are thinking right now, hey,
the firewall's open, I didn't open it.

126
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.800
When you install EngineX,
by default it opens port 80 for you.

127
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.150
Very nice, it's very helpful.
