00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.839
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So
we can get to this exercise with MySQL.

2
00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:02.775
You don't have to do it,

3
00:00:02.775 --> 00:00:05.908
this is totally optional, because we are
not actually going to do much with MySQL.

4
00:00:05.908 --> 00:00:10.005
Again, SQL is a totally different class.

5
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:14.271
We could do a week on it and
not even touch much of it.

6
00:00:14.271 --> 00:00:18.459
But I want to make sure you know how to
install database with the same defaults we

7
00:00:18.459 --> 00:00:19.161
want to use.

8
00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:21.562
And if you are saying why am I
saying sequel instead of SQL,

9
00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:23.828
totally where you went to school,
where you are from.

10
00:00:23.828 --> 00:00:27.231
Some people say SQL, some people say
sequel, it doesn't really matter.

11
00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:29.242
I say SQL, that is just how I learned it.

12
00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:31.410
Just in case, some of you are confused,
like what about SQL,

13
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.296
I have heard about that.

14
00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:33.447
It is the same thing.

15
00:00:33.447 --> 00:00:39.980
So if you want to install SQL,
say apt install mysql-server.

16
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.266
Pretty standard.

17
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:45.665
The great thing is now SQL has
a script to do a secure installation.

18
00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:50.330
So you can say mysql_secure_installation
and it kinda runs through some

19
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.560
sane defaults, makes you pick
a root password, things like that.

20
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.324
A word on databases,

21
00:00:56.324 --> 00:01:01.818
databases are a common source of
vulnerability for most servers.

22
00:01:01.818 --> 00:01:05.170
Because at it's core that's
where all your knowledge is.

23
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.120
That's where all the data is.

24
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.120
That's where people wanna get into.

25
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.336
So there's some useful tips
that I put on the next slide,

26
00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:13.686
as soon as we're done installing MySQL.

27
00:01:13.686 --> 00:01:18.615
But in general, be very, very cagey with
your database, I see people install them,

28
00:01:18.615 --> 00:01:22.039
just kind of really nearly they
don't put a password on it,

29
00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:25.959
they expose it out to the Internet,
just bad practices all around.

30
00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:30.113
Just be very very careful cuz your
database is where like all your business

31
00:01:30.113 --> 00:01:34.473
logic lies, whether it's credit cards and
passwords and things like that.

32
00:01:34.473 --> 00:01:37.575
So be very cautious, so
I'm gonna go ahead and run this.

33
00:01:37.575 --> 00:01:41.358
Again, this is optional exercise just for
the sake of knowledge.

34
00:01:41.358 --> 00:01:43.406
But I'm gonna install SQL server.

35
00:01:43.406 --> 00:01:50.518
Says sudo apt install mysql-server.

36
00:01:58.304 --> 00:02:01.019
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right, and
as soon as secure installation for me,

37
00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:02.110
which is great.

38
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.560
So I'm gonna give the root password.

39
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.509
I'm just gonna give it a simple one.

40
00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:26.344
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right, we are good.

41
00:02:26.344 --> 00:02:29.021
I might run mysql_secure_installation, but

42
00:02:29.021 --> 00:02:32.747
I don't think we have to now with
this particular install of mysql.

43
00:02:32.747 --> 00:02:36.331
But if you're running this in the future,
some later date, if it didn't ask you for

44
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:39.828
a root password, you should just run
the mysql_secure_installation script.

45
00:02:39.828 --> 00:02:40.701
Just a FYI.

46
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:45.220
So let's go and log in to mysql just
to make sure it's up and running.

47
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.227
Say that, we just say mysql -u.

48
00:02:49.227 --> 00:02:51.698
Log in as roots -p.

49
00:02:51.698 --> 00:02:53.160
It's gonna ask me for a password.

50
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.670
And we're in mysql.

51
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.034
So I think we can say show databases.

52
00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.100
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Semicolon, and
just showing the databases we have.

53
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.338
Just some defaults in there.

54
00:03:14.911 --> 00:03:16.988
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But
we now how SQL up and running.

55
00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:19.119
We have a password on it.

56
00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:22.749
And after this, we're going to
run some standard, just set up,

57
00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:25.989
just standard checks to make
sure we know what is going on.

58
00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.717
And if you are in mysql console, you
have to end everything with a semicolon,

59
00:03:30.717 --> 00:03:35.373
otherwise, as I'm sure some of you just
learned you will not run anything,

60
00:03:35.373 --> 00:03:37.302
it will just kind of error out.

61
00:03:42.192 --> 00:03:46.598
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Exit and
I'm just gonna exit out of here.

62
00:03:46.598 --> 00:03:47.304
So everybody is good so far?

63
00:03:47.304 --> 00:03:51.651
We've got SQL running up and
nothing particularly special about this.

64
00:03:51.651 --> 00:03:53.740
This would be the same for post grads,

65
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.428
for any other kind of SQL
database you wanna run.

66
00:03:56.428 --> 00:03:59.889
The non-relational database will
be a little bit different, but

67
00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.323
the concepts still apply.
