00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.750
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So surely there has
to be a better way than iptables.

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.050
This is not the way to control
ports on your computer.

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.810
Yeah there is.

4
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.030
There's a little utility called
uncomplicated firewall ufw.

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.720
So now if we want to allow ports in
we can say sudo ufw allow ssh enable.

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.850
That's much better than this.

7
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:23.350
Isn't it?

8
00:00:25.576 --> 00:00:27.390
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes you can agree with me,
it's okay.

9
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.148
Yes, so we can use uncomplicated
firewall to do everything we just did.

10
00:00:36.018 --> 00:00:39.010
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Of course
you don't do this now.

11
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.900
For all the ports that we're gonna open, I
will tell you when we're gonna open them,

12
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.770
when we're gonna close them.

13
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.660
You don't have to worry about that for
this class too much.

14
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.550
But let's create a uncomplicated
firewall rule to block all outgoing HTTP

15
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.200
connections.

16
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.500
How do we do that with iptables?

17
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.191
We do it this way, not as pretty.

18
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:02.823
So if we wanna reject all,
we can just say ufw reject out http.

19
00:01:02.823 --> 00:01:05.690
Is that not uncomplicated?

20
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.207
They really know what they're doing
when they name things in Unix.

21
00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:12.421
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So don't do this.

22
00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:13.519
If you do this now,

23
00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:17.850
obviously I didn't put a dollar
sign on it saying like don't do it.

24
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.000
That's just an example.

25
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.230
Cuz if you block off your HP
connections later in the class,

26
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.990
you'll be like,
why isn't my web server working?

27
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.340
I'll be like, I don't know,
what'd you do, man?

28
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.090
So don't do that now.

29
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.710
But in the future,
if you need to open ports, close ports,

30
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.490
ufw is a much easier way to go.

31
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.140
But, even lazier, even lazier,
there is a UI for this.

32
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.852
So this is Amazon.

33
00:01:37.852 --> 00:01:39.768
This is EC2.

34
00:01:39.768 --> 00:01:45.131
You can just create security groups and
you say SSHP these custom rules.

35
00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:47.929
Much easier you don't even have
to do it on the server anymore.

36
00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.190
The way to do it in
dissolution if you go to.

37
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.607
Let's see if I can find it actually.

38
00:01:53.607 --> 00:01:55.418
Showing is better than telling.

39
00:01:55.418 --> 00:01:56.452
If we go to Networking.

40
00:01:59.192 --> 00:02:01.760
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Click the firewalls.

41
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.660
I don't have one yet.

42
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.560
So I can create a firewall.

43
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.787
I create all these rules,
inbound, outbound and

44
00:02:12.787 --> 00:02:16.623
this is much friendlier way to create
a firewall on your computer but

45
00:02:16.623 --> 00:02:20.546
again if you're not using dissolution
it's good to know about ufw.

46
00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:23.939
And if you don't have ufw installed
because you're using a different

47
00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.885
a distribution of Unix,
it's good to know about iptables.

48
00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:28.279
Those are pretty standard.

49
00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.949
But for now you can leave this alone.

50
00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:34.199
Your standard firewall just
allowing SHN for now is just fine.

51
00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:37.917
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But it's good to know that.
