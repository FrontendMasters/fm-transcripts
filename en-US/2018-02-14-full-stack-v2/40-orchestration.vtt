&gt;&gt; Jem Young: There's
something called Kubernetes.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.480
Kubernetes is the open source container
deployment strategy container management.

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.472
So we talked about orchestration, it's
a cool word and I'm jealous of dev ops

4
00:00:12.472 --> 00:00:15.080
people that be like, yeah,
we orchestrate all these servers.

5
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.800
What it is is a good example is Netflix.

6
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.209
Netflix, we have web servers, we have
API servers, we have video servers,

7
00:00:21.209 --> 00:00:22.158
we have log servers.

8
00:00:22.158 --> 00:00:23.523
We have all these things.

9
00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.191
But let's say our traffic is ramping up.

10
00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:29.390
It's a holiday season,
a lot of people are running Netflix.

11
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.390
I wouldn't just bring up one web server,
I'd bring up many.

12
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.893
But if you have one web server, you have
to bring up the equivalent of API servers

13
00:00:35.893 --> 00:00:38.471
and log in servers and
video servers and all these things.

14
00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:40.330
So that's what orchestration's about,

15
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.695
it's about bringing up all these services
at once so they all move together.

16
00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:47.370
Versus just like doing one, and
then two, and then three, and then four.

17
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.205
Cuz that wouldn't work.

18
00:00:48.205 --> 00:00:51.215
Cuz I'd have all these web servers and
they have no back end to support them.

19
00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:53.749
Well, I have all this back end,
but there is no traffic coming in,

20
00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:56.020
cuz I don't have the web
servers to support it.

21
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.036
And that's what when people say
orchestration, what they're talking about.

22
00:00:59.036 --> 00:01:03.555
Is bringing up a lot of different micro
services in containers at once to kind of

23
00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:05.272
just scale your web load out.

24
00:01:05.272 --> 00:01:08.220
Because nowadays,
we don't just add more servers,

25
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.436
we add applications and
containers and things like that.

26
00:01:11.436 --> 00:01:12.506
Cool.

27
00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:15.287
Kubernetes, it's a cool name,
it's open source.

28
00:01:15.287 --> 00:01:18.809
There's a link about board different
container organization tools,

29
00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:22.517
but Kubernetes is probably the biggest
one right now, but Amazon has one.

30
00:01:22.517 --> 00:01:25.169
Microsoft has one with Azure,
things like that.
