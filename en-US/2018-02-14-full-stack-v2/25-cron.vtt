00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.336
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: How do we do periodic tasks?

2
00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:05.976
This is a general problem when you're
running servers, you want to do things

3
00:00:05.976 --> 00:00:09.965
periodically like clean up your log files,
delete empty files, things like that.

4
00:00:09.965 --> 00:00:13.585
In our instance we want to make sure
our certificate gets renewed regularly,

5
00:00:13.585 --> 00:00:15.039
without us thinking about it.

6
00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.746
So you're thinking, unattended
upgrades when you're on that path,

7
00:00:18.746 --> 00:00:19.989
that's its own thing.

8
00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:23.690
It runs on its own, it runs its own
daemon, we don't worry about that.

9
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.130
In general, when we run periodic
task we want to use a cron job.

10
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.880
Cron, wait, I don't know what
cron stand for, but let's look,

11
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.810
see if it stands for anything.

12
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.761
Cron,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: No, a daemon to execute

13
00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:44.710
scheduled commands, that's Vixie cron,
what if they created it?

14
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.936
Maybe, cuz some of these like chown or
chmod kinda makes sense, chsh for change

15
00:00:49.936 --> 00:00:54.077
shell, cron doesn't really fit anything.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Chronologial if it had an h

16
00:00:54.077 --> 00:00:55.576
in there.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Maybe,

17
00:00:55.576 --> 00:01:00.751
maybe it says Vixie cron, person.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Originally

18
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:04.747
coded by Paul Vixie in 1987.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: But, it's a cron.

19
00:01:04.747 --> 00:01:08.986
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: [LAUGH] Well.

20
00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:10.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You know what, I found it.

21
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.616
The origin of the name cron is
from the Greek word for time.

22
00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:16.567
Awesome, So.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: That's pretty cool.

23
00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:19.281
Maybe it is chronological but
spelled differently.

24
00:01:19.281 --> 00:01:20.975
Anyways, [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]

25
00:01:20.975 --> 00:01:22.265
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: A bit of trivia, so

26
00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:26.218
a cron job is just a job that
runs periodically and it has a,

27
00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:31.726
it looks like a strange syntax, but when
you break it out it's not that strange.

28
00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:36.234
So it's minutes to hour,
day of month, month, day of week,

29
00:01:36.234 --> 00:01:38.849
and then the job you wanna execute.

30
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.476
It's strange cuz you see a cron job and
you're like, what does this mean?

31
00:01:44.476 --> 00:01:48.360
The star is a wild card,
it means anytime, so if I had star or

32
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.490
if I had 01**** it's gonna run every
minute of everyday of every month,

33
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.010
every hour and things like that so
on and so forth.

34
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.815
But a useful tool is crontab.guru,
that's really nice,

35
00:01:59.815 --> 00:02:04.983
it's very helpful.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So

36
00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:07.765
you don't have to think like,
what does this mean?

37
00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:14.235
Four or five on a Monday.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Day of month, Monday.

38
00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:20.706
Cron has a seemingly strange syntax but
as crontab.guru shows us,

39
00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:25.090
it's actually fairly, it makes sense.

40
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.828
It's strange to us, but when you think
about how you would structure how to

41
00:02:28.828 --> 00:02:32.096
build out a syntax that regularly do jobs,
this makes sense.

42
00:02:32.096 --> 00:02:35.080
It's kind of the beauty of Unix that,
cuz people have been doing this for

43
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.980
a long time.

44
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.770
They've kinda down it down
as simple as possible.

45
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.540
So let's make a cron job.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, I did make a cron job.

46
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.440
This is gonna echo, it's party time at
four o'clock on every Friday of the month.

47
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.350
Just to make sure people aren't
logged in and working too hard.

48
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.750
I'm not really gonna do that, but

49
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.089
you could.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And

50
00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:00.989
if you wanna say it's very,
very specific at a certain

51
00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.408
time on a day a month every year,
it's gonna execute some task.

52
00:03:04.408 --> 00:03:08.770
So you kinda get the gist of cron jobs,
it's a little funky, but it's not too bad.
