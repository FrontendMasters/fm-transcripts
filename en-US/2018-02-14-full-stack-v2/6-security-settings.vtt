00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.238
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: As long as everybody
can log in with their ssh key,

2
00:00:02.238 --> 00:00:04.920
with their new user tester,
whatever you wanna call that.

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.005
Let's go and add a password for root,
that's generally always a good idea.

4
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:18.027
So can I switch to root?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: No, I can't.

5
00:00:18.027 --> 00:00:21.131
Because you can't just switch back
to roots from your current user cuz

6
00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:22.614
it doesn't have a password yet.

7
00:00:22.614 --> 00:00:25.597
So the way we're gonna solve
that is we're gonna log out.

8
00:00:25.597 --> 00:00:27.123
Exit.

9
00:00:27.123 --> 00:00:33.532
Then I'm gonna log in as root for now.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And

10
00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:35.999
I'm just gonna use the password.

11
00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:37.588
Make sure that's right, yes.

12
00:00:37.588 --> 00:00:42.851
The password command.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Oops, did I misspell that?

13
00:00:42.851 --> 00:00:49.143
Pass, you know they took out the word,
the or, but not the pass part.

14
00:00:49.143 --> 00:00:51.785
All right, let's type it again.

15
00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:54.025
I am just off today, I apologize.

16
00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:56.414
Password, and I'm just gonna
make it something simple for

17
00:00:56.414 --> 00:01:01.222
now.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So

18
00:01:01.222 --> 00:01:05.484
we just ran the password command and
we added a password for the root user.

19
00:01:05.484 --> 00:01:09.348
By default it's blank, but ironically,
in the configuration by default,

20
00:01:09.348 --> 00:01:10.780
it says no blank passwords.

21
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.055
Which is why you can't
switch to root user.

22
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.883
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, it's tricky.

23
00:01:16.883 --> 00:01:21.718
That's the pros and cons of setting
something up with DigitalOcean or Amazon,

24
00:01:21.718 --> 00:01:23.603
is they have secure defaults.

25
00:01:23.603 --> 00:01:25.869
But you have to know what
those are ahead of time,

26
00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.595
lest you get yourself into a corner.

27
00:01:27.595 --> 00:01:29.998
Now if you wanna start this fresh,
like you have a home machine,

28
00:01:29.998 --> 00:01:31.212
you could do whatever you want.

29
00:01:31.212 --> 00:01:34.208
You'd say blank passwords are fine,
doesn't matter.

30
00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:38.556
But for now, it's probably a good idea to
always have a root password of some sort.

31
00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:40.430
So let's go ahead and exit.

32
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.211
And let's log back in as our test user.

33
00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:46.033
I just wanna make sure I can switch
the root just in case I need to.

34
00:01:48.286 --> 00:01:49.557
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Did it work?

35
00:01:49.557 --> 00:01:51.158
Did I put the wrong password?

36
00:01:51.158 --> 00:01:52.432
Maybe I did.

37
00:01:52.432 --> 00:01:56.109
All right, no, we're good.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: But

38
00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:58.830
in general you shouldn't
do things as root.

39
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.016
Why is that, from the first one?

40
00:02:00.016 --> 00:02:02.055
Someone remind me.

41
00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:04.788
Anybody?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You can do bad things

42
00:02:04.788 --> 00:02:05.972
without sudo.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes,

43
00:02:05.972 --> 00:02:09.193
yeah, you can do bad things without sudo.

44
00:02:09.193 --> 00:02:11.731
Sudo is just a way of saying,
are you sure?

45
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.473
Are you really sure?

46
00:02:13.473 --> 00:02:14.784
But if root, it won't tell you.

47
00:02:14.784 --> 00:02:18.810
You can say rm-rf/ delete your whole
directory, it will not give you a warning.

48
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.640
I think it might now, probably won't.

49
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.276
You could disable your firewall,
you can do also sorts of nasty things and

50
00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:25.459
you just won't know because
you're not paying attention.

51
00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.135
So you always wanna keep sudo cuz
it's just a quick safety check.

52
00:02:30.135 --> 00:02:33.929
And I'm just gonna exit, and
I'll be back to my test user

53
00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:38.307
shell.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right,

54
00:02:38.307 --> 00:02:40.995
now let's disable root login.

55
00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:42.521
How do we do that?

56
00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:47.563
Someone remind me.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Mash profiles,

57
00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:49.246
batch config.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Batch

58
00:02:49.246 --> 00:02:50.210
config, no.

59
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.492
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: SSH.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes.

60
00:02:51.492 --> 00:02:52.397
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: SSHD.

61
00:02:52.397 --> 00:02:55.110
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yes, so as a refresher,

62
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.255
because I honestly don't remember.

63
00:02:59.255 --> 00:03:04.657
So sudo vi /etc/sshd/config.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Make

64
00:03:04.657 --> 00:03:08.933
you a little bigger.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: If you just woke up,

65
00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:11.151
we are back on the slides
from the first course,

66
00:03:11.151 --> 00:03:13.096
cuz it has all the instructions already.

67
00:03:13.096 --> 00:03:14.743
Cuz you'll be like,
I don't see these in the slides.

68
00:03:14.743 --> 00:03:17.238
This is the first course, there's a link.

69
00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:23.731
So sudo vi I, edit your sshd_config.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Except for you.

70
00:03:23.731 --> 00:03:26.211
If you have not been able to
log in as your test user,

71
00:03:26.211 --> 00:03:27.719
do not disable root login yet.

72
00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:32.275
You will be locked out of your server.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And

73
00:03:32.275 --> 00:03:36.970
by default, DigitalOcean, if you use
SSH key, password authentication is no.

74
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.827
But just double check to
make sure that's set to no.

75
00:03:42.827 --> 00:03:47.613
All right, so I'm going to edit

76
00:03:47.613 --> 00:03:51.692
in mine, sudo/etc/sshd

77
00:03:51.692 --> 00:03:57.544
[INAUDIBLE].
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: That's

78
00:03:57.544 --> 00:04:03.837
without sshd.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: So

79
00:04:03.837 --> 00:04:11.860
the,
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And

80
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.384
we're disabling the permit.

81
00:04:13.384 --> 00:04:17.955
So, lazy way, permits, RootLogin,

82
00:04:17.955 --> 00:04:24.881
gonna say no.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And oops,

83
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:30.259
say password login,
currency passwords, no.

84
00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:32.928
And PasswordAuthentication
is set to no as well.

85
00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:36.938
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right?

86
00:04:36.938 --> 00:04:37.979
Good to go.

87
00:04:43.685 --> 00:04:46.992
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Actually show you this line.

88
00:04:46.992 --> 00:04:52.491
The great thing about a lot of Linux
defaults is it's pretty well commented.

89
00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:55.620
You can go through this file and you can
see different ways of configuring SSHD.

90
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.143
Remember earlier how we said
the authorized key files can be anything?

91
00:04:59.143 --> 00:05:01.191
Well we can just comment this line,
cuz this is the default.

92
00:05:01.191 --> 00:05:04.123
We can comment this and
change it to authorize users.

93
00:05:04.123 --> 00:05:05.244
We can change it to whatever we want.

94
00:05:05.244 --> 00:05:06.550
But we keep it as a default.

95
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.349
But in the future, if you ever wanna
just move where your public keys are,

96
00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:10.261
just change this line.

97
00:05:10.261 --> 00:05:11.612
Nothing to it.

98
00:05:11.612 --> 00:05:14.161
It's not that scary.

99
00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:21.585
And I'm just gonna write quit,
so sudo service, sshd, restart.

100
00:05:21.585 --> 00:05:23.855
It's gonna restart the daemon,
so we pick up the new config.

101
00:05:32.494 --> 00:05:33.195
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right.

102
00:05:36.016 --> 00:05:37.436
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Everybody with me?

103
00:05:37.436 --> 00:05:40.983
Now, if you want, you can test to
make sure you did things correctly.

104
00:05:40.983 --> 00:05:42.677
You can try to log in as root.

105
00:05:42.677 --> 00:05:44.679
It'll say permission denied (publickey).

106
00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:46.797
I know, not the most useful error.

107
00:05:46.797 --> 00:05:49.428
But it works.

108
00:05:49.428 --> 00:05:51.151
Now if you run into errors with ssh,

109
00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:53.694
which at some point in
the future you probably will.

110
00:05:53.694 --> 00:05:57.420
Let's run this with the v command for
verbose.

111
00:06:03.576 --> 00:06:04.833
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: [INAUDIBLE], and

112
00:06:04.833 --> 00:06:09.782
it tells you everything that's
happening with that handshake.

113
00:06:09.782 --> 00:06:12.404
[SOUND] And it tells you all
the files it's running through,

114
00:06:12.404 --> 00:06:14.884
all the keys it's trying to pick up,
things like that.

115
00:06:14.884 --> 00:06:16.708
So /v is pretty useful.

116
00:06:16.708 --> 00:06:19.828
In the future, if you have
an issue with SSH, I'm gonna say,

117
00:06:19.828 --> 00:06:22.471
run SSH with verbose and
tell me what's happening.

118
00:06:22.471 --> 00:06:25.329
And you could usually figure out
pretty quickly about what the issue

119
00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:28.641
is.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: And

120
00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:33.053
let's log back in.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: All right.

121
00:06:33.053 --> 00:06:33.889
Everybody with me?

122
00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:35.049
No one confused?

123
00:06:35.049 --> 00:06:37.287
We're all happy.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

124
00:06:37.287 --> 00:06:39.756
it shouldn't still be asking you for

125
00:06:39.756 --> 00:06:43.669
a password if you have enabled the sshd?
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: No, it should not.

126
00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.026
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It is.

127
00:06:45.026 --> 00:06:46.513
Do you have sense of
what might be going on?

128
00:06:46.513 --> 00:06:48.103
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Did you put password on your

129
00:06:48.103 --> 00:06:49.322
SSH key?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

130
00:06:49.322 --> 00:06:50.136
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Okay, that's what it's

131
00:06:50.136 --> 00:06:51.070
asking for.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Really?

132
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.296
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Yeah, so that's actually

133
00:06:52.296 --> 00:06:55.228
a pretty good authentication step
if you had a big secure server,

134
00:06:55.228 --> 00:06:57.327
is you can put a password
on top of your SSH key.

135
00:06:57.327 --> 00:06:59.188
That way, in case someone steals that,

136
00:06:59.188 --> 00:07:01.500
they still have to put in
a password to decrypt it.

137
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.161
That's smart.

138
00:07:02.161 --> 00:07:04.564
We didn't do it cuz I'm lazy and
I hate typing passwords every time.

139
00:07:04.564 --> 00:07:07.358
But you're much better
at security than I am.

140
00:07:07.358 --> 00:07:16.627
Shame on me, shame on me.
&gt;&gt; Jem Young: Oops, all right.

141
00:07:16.627 --> 00:07:21.055
And we disabled root login,
we disabled password login, excellent.
