WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.610
Last thing that we did was creating the
earth with the cloud texture on top of it.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.737
We are going to start from that.

3
00:00:07.737 --> 00:00:14.711
And you can copy and paste the whole
thing into the ar.ts file, if you like.

4
00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:18.031
So, you will have exactly
the same thing and

5
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:23.680
we will start from there and
create the experience here, cool.

6
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.490
Now, we have exactly the same
thing as we did before.

7
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.401
Number one thing that we are going
to do is have imports of VR button.

8
00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:38.950
VR button is going to do
a lot of stuff for us.

9
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.625
First of all, when we have a VR
experience, we have to start a session and

10
00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:51.064
we always have to ask users permission
before we go into an immersive experience.

11
00:00:51.064 --> 00:00:56.013
We never want to make anyone directly go
into universal experience when they're

12
00:00:56.013 --> 00:00:57.040
not expecting.

13
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.750
So, that is a requirement of the spec API.

14
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.550
We are going to do that.

15
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.808
And VR button nicely does that for us.

16
00:01:08.808 --> 00:01:15.581
I believe it's GSM web VR button.

17
00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:35.290
From expected [LAUGH]

18
00:01:38.842 --> 00:01:44.287
And we have the VR button
edits as an important.

19
00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:49.880
We also have to add it on to our
documents, we append it to our documents.

20
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.103
So, when we can do that
on our image function,

21
00:01:56.103 --> 00:02:01.150
document, body appendchild.

22
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.813
This is the AR button but
I'm going to do a VR, Create button and

23
00:02:04.813 --> 00:02:06.140
then give it a render.

24
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.654
And this requirements is for
Augmented reality, but for

25
00:02:10.654 --> 00:02:13.670
our case, the renderer is just fine.

26
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.596
If we go back to our experience and
refresh it,

27
00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:20.990
we should see the Enter VR button.

28
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.783
Now, the challenging part is
to see it in a VR experience,

29
00:02:27.783 --> 00:02:32.490
because here we won't
be able to go into it.

30
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.524
But if you already
downloaded the extension,

31
00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:43.330
WebXR extension,
then you can try to go into the VR and

32
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.460
move the headset to see around.

33
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.290
Let's see if we are having an issue here.

34
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.639
Okay, I'm going to exit there and
try to run it on my device.

35
00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:05.873
My Android device, I've already
enabled the developer mode and

36
00:03:05.873 --> 00:03:11.700
all I need to do is now
plug it into my computer.

37
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.780
And open up your developer tools.

38
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.420
And now, you can go to remote devices.

39
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.100
If you're not seeing remote devices,
it might be hidden over here, or

40
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.720
you can click on the hamburger menu and
go under more tools and find it here.

41
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.540
So, remote devices are here.

42
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.544
Or you can directly go
into inspect devices and

43
00:03:34.544 --> 00:03:36.862
open up the inspect devices panel.

44
00:03:39.228 --> 00:03:45.970
Right now, I have a browser open.

45
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.005
Chrome browser is open, so

46
00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:53.408
one thing I have to do is add the port
forward then if you already happens.

47
00:03:53.408 --> 00:03:58.220
Currently, our example
is running on port 3000.

48
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.655
So, you have to add both port 3000 and
then the IP address local hosts 3000.

49
00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:12.684
Once you've done that,
you have to just wait for

50
00:04:12.684 --> 00:04:16.300
device portal to find your device.

51
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.780
It should be under remote targets.

52
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.620
Let me refresh.

53
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.880
Here we go, now I have it.

54
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.043
I already have a local host 3000 open, but

55
00:04:28.043 --> 00:04:32.738
if it wasn't you can just copy and
paste it here, and

56
00:04:32.738 --> 00:04:36.926
it will open up a new tab for
you with your code.

57
00:04:36.926 --> 00:04:42.197
And I will share what I'm

58
00:04:42.197 --> 00:04:46.971
seeing, hopefully.

59
00:04:50.277 --> 00:04:52.222
All right, here.

60
00:04:52.222 --> 00:04:57.424
This is another tool that I'm using to be

61
00:04:57.424 --> 00:05:02.932
able to share what I'm seeing on my phone,

62
00:05:02.932 --> 00:05:06.462
and it's called YVWYSOR.

63
00:05:06.462 --> 00:05:09.583
If you are not able to
see things over here,

64
00:05:09.583 --> 00:05:13.070
that's also another option for
you to try out.

65
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.257
Usually, for
these things to work properly,

66
00:05:17.257 --> 00:05:19.420
you have to be on the same network.

67
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.432
Sometimes, you might be using a different
version of the same network, and

68
00:05:25.432 --> 00:05:27.150
you might run into issues.

69
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.027
If you are able to see your device here,
then,

70
00:05:32.027 --> 00:05:36.770
you can click on Inspect, and
this will open up the Inspect.

71
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.420
So, everything that happens here,

72
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:46.460
you can see the catalogs and
everything that we are doing.

73
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.850
Normally, the button got really,
really small here.

74
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:56.120
So, I'm gonna press it on my device but
you can actually see that it was pressed.

75
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.242
When I do that,
usually it stops refreshing,

76
00:06:03.242 --> 00:06:08.779
but hopefully we'll be able
to see it on the site.

77
00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.900
So, I have a two view.

78
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.660
I have two renders for two different eyes.

79
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.843
So, we are in a VR mode, basically,
but it's a little bit dark.

80
00:06:21.992 --> 00:06:26.987
If you have any thing like a Cardboard,
Google Cardboard, or

81
00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:31.405
Samsung device,
then you can put your phone into it and

82
00:06:31.405 --> 00:06:35.180
then you'll be able to
see the VR experience.

83
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.456
You should be able to see it but
just in case,

84
00:06:39.456 --> 00:06:43.154
what we can do is also check the flags,

85
00:06:43.154 --> 00:06:47.180
Current flags that you have for Chrome.

86
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.930
Are you using Chrome?

87
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

88
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.540
&gt;&gt; Okay.

89
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.689
So, you can type in chrome;//flags,

90
00:06:55.689 --> 00:07:01.180
and this will open up your Chrome flags.

91
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.210
And what you can do is enable
anything that's related to WebXR.

92
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.046
So, in my case, WebXR incubations enables.

93
00:07:11.046 --> 00:07:15.859
If it's a default, I would enable it too.

94
00:07:15.859 --> 00:07:20.310
And once we do that,
we have to restart our browser too.

95
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.271
Force WebXR Runtime and

96
00:07:23.271 --> 00:07:28.458
we can keep this as default and relaunch.
