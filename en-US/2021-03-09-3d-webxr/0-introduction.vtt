WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.067 --> 00:00:04.859
Thank you for joining me today at
the WebXR and 3-D on the Web workshop.

2
00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.555
Let me introduce myself,
my name is Aysegul.

3
00:00:07.555 --> 00:00:11.997
I'm a cloud developer advocate for
Azure AI and Mixed Reality,

4
00:00:11.997 --> 00:00:13.981
that's part of Microsoft.

5
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:18.060
I'm also the co-chair of
W3C Immersive Web Working Group, and

6
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.109
Google Developer Expert for
Web Technologies.

7
00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.187
And you can find me
everywhere with AysSomething.

8
00:00:25.187 --> 00:00:28.122
So few things that we
are going to cover today.

9
00:00:28.122 --> 00:00:33.110
Number one, what is 3-D on the web and
WebXR, and why they are good, and

10
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.748
what kind of applications
that you can create today?

11
00:00:36.748 --> 00:00:38.034
And afterwards,

12
00:00:38.034 --> 00:00:43.533
we'll create our first 3-D experience
in three most popular libraries.

13
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:49.222
One of them is Babylon.js, the other
one is A-Frame, and finally Three.js.

14
00:00:49.222 --> 00:00:53.600
Once we create those experiences,
we will dive into turning our

15
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.397
experiences to augmented reality and
virtual reality experiences.

16
00:00:58.397 --> 00:01:05.954
Along the way, we will discover some of
the WebXR capabilities, like Hit Test.

17
00:01:05.954 --> 00:01:10.562
We will see how we can load
models from 3-D files.

18
00:01:10.562 --> 00:01:15.105
And finally,
we can discuss all of your questions,

19
00:01:15.105 --> 00:01:20.269
including how to make your
applications more accessible,

20
00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:25.136
and what kind of features
are coming in the near future.

21
00:01:25.136 --> 00:01:29.899
My slides are here at bit.ly/WebXRSlides.

22
00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.657
You can also take
a picture of the QR code.

23
00:01:33.657 --> 00:01:38.034
There are lots of links on my slides,
and they're very helpful.

24
00:01:38.034 --> 00:01:41.475
So it would be really nice
if you could take a picture.

25
00:01:43.976 --> 00:01:48.567
One of the first things that I want to
start with is talking about the concepts.

26
00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:54.052
What is WebXR, and
what do we mean by 3-D on the web?

27
00:01:54.052 --> 00:01:56.991
When we talk about the 3-D on the web,

28
00:01:56.991 --> 00:02:01.445
we mean just a canvas rendered
with 3-D objects in it, but

29
00:02:01.445 --> 00:02:06.544
no immersive experience where you
could interact with your mouse.

30
00:02:06.544 --> 00:02:12.247
When it comes to WebXR,
it is the newer web API,

31
00:02:12.247 --> 00:02:15.676
replacing older WebVR API.

32
00:02:15.676 --> 00:02:19.361
And includes not only the WebXR for
VR, but also for

33
00:02:19.361 --> 00:02:22.372
augmented reality experiences as well.

34
00:02:22.372 --> 00:02:29.861
We are very used to acting in a 3-D world,
and seeing information in a 3-D world.

35
00:02:29.861 --> 00:02:34.600
When you take all of the information and
put it onto an Excel sheet, or

36
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.361
any 2-D representation of it,
it's really hard for

37
00:02:38.361 --> 00:02:41.408
people to understand the importance of it.

38
00:02:41.408 --> 00:02:46.129
But when you put the same data
on a context, when you see it,

39
00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.945
when you need it,
exactly in the right place and right time,

40
00:02:50.945 --> 00:02:53.702
it makes a humongous difference.

41
00:02:53.702 --> 00:02:58.981
For example, this one is
an augmented reality experience for

42
00:02:58.981 --> 00:03:04.578
HoloLens, where you are able to
look at the layout of an airport.

43
00:03:04.578 --> 00:03:07.076
And you can see the different layers and

44
00:03:07.076 --> 00:03:10.186
different information
layers at the same time.

45
00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:18.633
Let me show you what HoloLens looks like,
while this video is showing.

46
00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:22.713
I'll demo it a little later.

47
00:03:22.713 --> 00:03:27.717
This is an experience that the FDA

48
00:03:27.717 --> 00:03:31.653
approved for surgeries.

49
00:03:31.653 --> 00:03:35.233
When you go into surgery,
especially in US,

50
00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:40.698
it's really scary to be asked all
the time, where are we operating,

51
00:03:40.698 --> 00:03:44.302
and which part of your
body we are operating?

52
00:03:44.302 --> 00:03:50.585
Because the information that the surgeon
needs is not right in front of them.

53
00:03:50.585 --> 00:03:54.773
They are not able to touch anywhere, so
they can't really grab that information.

54
00:03:54.773 --> 00:03:59.500
But now with HoloLens,
they can take the information with

55
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.527
them to the surgery room,
without having to touch anywhere.

56
00:04:04.527 --> 00:04:08.859
One of the cool experiences
with HoloLens for

57
00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.534
the surgery room was
also using eye-tracking.

58
00:04:13.534 --> 00:04:20.607
Because having to use your hands
somewhere is, that you cannot take away,

59
00:04:20.607 --> 00:04:25.786
but you might still need to
interact with the UI and UX.

60
00:04:25.786 --> 00:04:30.786
In that case, we are able to
see where you're looking, and

61
00:04:30.786 --> 00:04:36.686
then you can detect, touch, or
select anything from the interface.

62
00:04:42.052 --> 00:04:46.994
Augmented reality is also very useful for
manufacturing, or

63
00:04:46.994 --> 00:04:53.467
any time you need expert knowledge on
something, and you need a lot of training.

64
00:04:53.467 --> 00:04:58.524
This is one of the Microsoft
applications called 365.

65
00:04:58.524 --> 00:05:03.510
And you are able to actually
pinpoint the information to

66
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.870
an exact location, or
pinpoint it to an object.

67
00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:14.208
And then if you are a new employee,
you can just come in and

68
00:05:14.208 --> 00:05:18.784
follow the instructions, and
be very productive right away.

69
00:05:18.784 --> 00:05:22.290
I actually did this and
fixed a motorcycle,

70
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.957
which I would never be able to do.

71
00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:29.948
Or if this information was given to me on
a paper, I would never understand what

72
00:05:29.948 --> 00:05:34.731
they're talking about, because I
wouldn't know the names of the tools.

73
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:43.038
This is another 365 application,

74
00:05:43.038 --> 00:05:47.906
where you are able to
call an expert online.

75
00:05:47.906 --> 00:05:53.289
And because you have the headset, and
they are able to see exactly where you're

76
00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:58.450
looking, and they can put extra
information on top of what you're seeing.

77
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.790
So in this case, the expert is saying,

78
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.058
you need to open here,
and drawing those arrows.

79
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.140
But thankfully,
it's not just headsets, and

80
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.286
we have these capabilities
on our phones today.

81
00:06:15.286 --> 00:06:20.188
And a lot of applications that
we use daily are implementing

82
00:06:20.188 --> 00:06:24.808
some augmented reality or
immersive versions of them.

83
00:06:24.808 --> 00:06:31.069
This is the augmented reality
experience of the Google Maps.

84
00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:36.442
When you come out of a train station
in a city that you don't know,

85
00:06:36.442 --> 00:06:43.005
it's really hard to read that data from
a 2-D map and know exactly where to go.

86
00:06:43.005 --> 00:06:48.655
And GPS doesn't really work
perfectly well in these situations.

87
00:06:48.655 --> 00:06:52.955
With the AR experience,
you're able to look around, and

88
00:06:52.955 --> 00:06:58.311
the computer vision looks around and
identifies where exactly you are,

89
00:06:58.311 --> 00:07:01.582
and then points you to
the right direction.

90
00:07:01.582 --> 00:07:08.145
And this little tiny dot that you see
is saying if things are behind you.

91
00:07:08.145 --> 00:07:14.772
It's telling you which way to turn,
which is a really cool application.

92
00:07:14.772 --> 00:07:18.817
And I'm a huge fan of
the augmented reality,

93
00:07:18.817 --> 00:07:22.445
but VR is a very important part of it too.

94
00:07:22.445 --> 00:07:26.890
And this one tweet made my day,
and also the article.

95
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:33.879
Where Russian, [COUGH], farmers were
using VR to make their cows happier and

96
00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:39.132
have more milk production,
which is very interesting.
