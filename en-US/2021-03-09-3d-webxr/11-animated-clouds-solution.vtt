1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.200
So one thing that we are going to do is

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.792
add a bigger sphere here, okay,

3
00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:15.204
one more mesh with the same geometry but

4
00:00:15.204 --> 00:00:18.156
a little bit bigger so

5
00:00:18.156 --> 00:00:22.912
we can actually duplicate this and

6
00:00:22.912 --> 00:00:30.667
say Cloud Geometry And

7
00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:34.710
translated a little bit bigger.

8
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.420
To be a little bit bigger, let's do zero.

9
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.756
Well, no 1.1, maybe 1.12 and

10
00:00:43.756 --> 00:00:49.939
then we can just create
using the same mesh.

11
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.404
Clouds equal new mesh

12
00:00:56.404 --> 00:01:01.830
material Cloud Geometry.

13
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.690
I don't want to mistype anything.

14
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.530
Copying and
pasting is going to work, okay.

15
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.050
Now we have the clouds.

16
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.420
We also have to add them to our scene.

17
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.510
Maybe I'll edit it right after the art.

18
00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:41.180
In class,
let's see what we are seeing now.

19
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.010
We are not seeing the clouds.

20
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.993
Let's see if there is any errors that

21
00:01:47.993 --> 00:01:53.046
I'm seeing So what we forgot is to move

22
00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:58.615
our clouds to the same location position.

23
00:01:58.615 --> 00:02:03.434
That z is equal to minus two squared to

24
00:02:03.434 --> 00:02:07.798
be exactly the same, all right?

25
00:02:07.798 --> 00:02:09.192
Clouds.

26
00:02:09.192 --> 00:02:12.676
Spelling mistake.

27
00:02:12.676 --> 00:02:14.070
Clouds.

28
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.935
All right.

29
00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:21.600
So be added all of the materials and
It is getting exactly the same one.

30
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.000
So let's not do that.

31
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.500
This is all to teach you what could
go wrong [LAUGH] Over and over.

32
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.110
And thank you so much for your help.

33
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.140
What did I do?

34
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.060
The Material that we created is refresh.

35
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.678
All right, I'm going to copy and
paste this one and

36
00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:04.992
call it material clouds with clouds.

37
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.710
We don't want a bump map here.

38
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.670
We don't want this here and
the texture is going to be also different.

39
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.430
So this time I'm going to load the clouds.

40
00:03:28.228 --> 00:03:32.011
So cloud map.

41
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.966
And this is, I think, Okay,

42
00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:46.390
let me double check the naming convention.

43
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.885
Assets, images, globe and
urge clouds for KPMG.

44
00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:55.380
This is the one that we
need to urge clouds 4k.

45
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.420
What we wanted to have is also
transparency for our clouds trends.

46
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.063
Pairen See,

47
00:04:15.063 --> 00:04:20.114
I believe and I'm true.

48
00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:26.260
Alright, let's see.

49
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.640
We have the material clouds that we

50
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.321
are going to give to our clouds mesh,

51
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:39.112
well make sure you all right.

52
00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:44.996
And also texture in our map for
the clouds,

53
00:04:44.996 --> 00:04:51.380
we have to change that to
clouds map here we go.

54
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.610
Let's see what is happening.

55
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.250
Earth has already been declared.

56
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.685
I knew I copied and pasted earth

57
00:05:13.162 --> 00:05:17.494
Yes, we do have transparency but

58
00:05:17.494 --> 00:05:24.190
we are missing one thing
which was opacity points.

59
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.817
08 and transparency is transparent true,

60
00:05:28.817 --> 00:05:32.500
which I wrote transparency.

61
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.260
Let's fix that.

62
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.680
All right, yes.

63
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.210
Now we have some transparent clouds but
they're way too big.

64
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.010
So let's fix that one.

65
00:05:55.011 --> 00:06:00.391
All right, where did we define the name,

66
00:06:00.391 --> 00:06:06.402
the width and height,
the radius, I put one.

67
00:06:06.402 --> 00:06:10.013
What I meant to put was 0.6, maybe,

68
00:06:10.013 --> 00:06:14.063
now we refresh it,
it's closer to earth but

69
00:06:14.063 --> 00:06:20.100
I think it needs to be a little
bit more close, maybe five, five.

70
00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:31.130
No all right I'm gonna go with that one,
so it's still could be but, and

71
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:36.450
now our earth is turning right
our clouds are not turning.

72
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:43.861
So I'm going to add clouds That rotation.

73
00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:49.172
It's going to be a tiny bit

74
00:06:49.172 --> 00:06:54.014
faster than the earth.

75
00:06:54.014 --> 00:07:01.420
So 0.202 maybe.

76
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.940
Yay.

77
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:07.173
Now our clouds are turning around
a little bit faster than our earth.

78
00:07:07.173 --> 00:07:11.820
We have a little bit more
realistic representation.

79
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.604
And at this point, if you want,
you can add any location data and

80
00:07:16.604 --> 00:07:22.730
map it to the sphere and simple sphere
can turn into a data visualization.

81
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.788
And if you would like to do that we're
not going to do that in this course but

82
00:07:26.788 --> 00:07:28.500
there's an example.

83
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.485
Called tweet migration on my GitHub repo,

84
00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:39.810
where I'm getting tweets with Web Sockets
and displaying them on the map.

85
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.170
So you can add that if you like.

86
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.059
Is there any questions or

87
00:07:47.059 --> 00:07:52.069
anyone who weren't not able to see
something similar to what we have.

88
00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:55.570
There's no bump map for
the cloud texture, right?

89
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.218
Yes on the only thing that we
want from the cloud texture is

90
00:07:59.218 --> 00:08:03.920
have some transparency as well as
some white cloud looking things.

91
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.160
So there's no need for.

92
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:10.260
If you want, you could add
that of course and give some.

93
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.900
Debts but
I'm not sure how much you would add.
