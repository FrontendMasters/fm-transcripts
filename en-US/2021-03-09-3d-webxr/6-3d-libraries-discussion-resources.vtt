1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.650
I actually have a question.

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.790
So there's, a famous Babylon and
there's three js.

3
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.920
Is there one you would
recommend focusing on?

4
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.550
I mean, I don't see a reason
why you'd use all three.

5
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.270
&gt;&gt; Exactly, that's true you can
use A frame and three JS together.

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.420
That will make sense.

7
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.380
But otherwise you wouldn't
use three of them because

8
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.430
these are engines that you
need to download just once.

9
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.600
You don't have to have all of them.

10
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.257
Well, it's up to you the reason I wanted
to show you both is because I just

11
00:00:41.257 --> 00:00:46.400
want you to see the different syntax so
you can compare.

12
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.550
It's basically under the hoods,

13
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.997
they're all doing the same thing
creating a theme creating a camera and

14
00:00:52.997 --> 00:00:57.680
objects and rendering the main
functionality works exactly the same way.

15
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.680
So, whichever syntax you find more
interesting, you should go with that one.

16
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.050
Or if you want.

17
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.390
&gt;&gt; The one that gives you more control.

18
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.368
&gt;&gt; No, they're pretty much the same
because it's JavaScript like you can

19
00:01:15.368 --> 00:01:17.050
control a lot of them.

20
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.130
The only difference I would point
out is the tooling, that's one.

21
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.389
Babylon J's is supported by Microsoft and

22
00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:29.990
three J's is supported
by Google at the moment.

23
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.190
But the person who wrote it,
which is his nickname is Mr. Doob.

24
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.455
He started working on it,
and worked on it,

25
00:01:38.455 --> 00:01:41.560
long long years before he joined Google.

26
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.702
There are still open source projects and
whatever happens,

27
00:01:46.702 --> 00:01:49.424
whatever decisions happens at Google or

28
00:01:49.424 --> 00:01:55.390
Microsoft is not going to affect how these
libraries is going to be available to us.

29
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.633
And in the future,

30
00:01:56.633 --> 00:02:02.350
there might be any other library that
comes up it's much more fascinating.

31
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.940
I would like to give you the idea
of it with the JavaScript library.

32
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.949
It is going to be the same thing with
different syntax that you're going to do.

33
00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:17.135
One thing that you can also
do is look at their example,

34
00:02:17.135 --> 00:02:19.960
and start playing with them there.

35
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.820
What you want to build with WebEx R or
TV on the web.

36
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.550
Just look at the examples.

37
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.233
They both have really good
example sites if you type in

38
00:02:33.233 --> 00:02:41.960
3js.org these are all of the highlighted
projects that are done with 3 js.

39
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:49.360
But also they have a really cool
searchable examples on one side.

40
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.308
One thing I have to say about Babylon js

41
00:02:54.308 --> 00:02:58.794
is the team is very good with fixing

42
00:02:58.794 --> 00:03:03.279
the bugs if you happen to find one,

43
00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:08.780
their goal is to fix it in 24 hours.

44
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.030
They're very dedicated and hopefully
they'll be able to do that forever.

45
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.110
I don't know how they
do it [LAUGH] honestly.

46
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.130
So that's one thing to consider.

47
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.889
One question is if you want to make
an interactive theme with 3D models,

48
00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:29.440
which will be easier and less code, there
are actually model loaders out there too.

49
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.487
There's a web component
that you can call model

50
00:03:34.487 --> 00:03:39.440
loader that you can
just load a model with.

51
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.580
If all you want to do is view a model,
model viewer is the name sorry.

52
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.900
This is something that you could do,
or there are also services.

53
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.040
Let's look at the glitch demo of it.

54
00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.110
So we have the model we have the capacity
to, turn it around, look at it.

55
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.069
And let's say if you
are a product company,

56
00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:10.960
then you want to just show everything
in 3D and don't want to deal with it.

57
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.040
This is one thing that you can do and
since this is a remix,

58
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.810
I don't know if you're familiar with it.

59
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.980
I'll paste it on the chat.

60
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.440
What you can do is say remix this and
then you can look at the code itself.

61
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.120
There are services that
does all of these as well.

62
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:43.190
So if your goal is to write no code,
you can actually do that, it is possible.

63
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.488
But if you want to have a little
bit more interactive experience,

64
00:04:47.488 --> 00:04:50.390
then you want to write
your own JavaScript.

65
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.100
In that case, the still the least
code would be using A frame.

66
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.134
The question was, is there any
asset stores that you can just

67
00:05:03.134 --> 00:05:07.980
download some applications I
mean some models and use it.

68
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.203
I have resources like GitHub repo for
you and all of the assets,

69
00:05:16.203 --> 00:05:21.340
libraries, I put them
together that are free.

70
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.185
Some of them are paid, but
most of them are free and

71
00:05:25.185 --> 00:05:28.490
the most exciting ones for me are museums.

72
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.256
I used to work at Autodesk
if you're not familiar or

73
00:05:34.256 --> 00:05:40.071
vest is the company that makes
most of the 3D tools like Maya and

74
00:05:40.071 --> 00:05:46.980
3Ds Max, as well as cat for architecture,
and there we worked on a tool for

75
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:52.250
Smithsonian, and
we have to scan their artifacts.

76
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.550
So they scanned almost everything and
they're all available to be downloaded.

77
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.870
So this was the tool
actually that we built.

78
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:08.110
Right now, I'm not sure if it's
still doing the same thing.

79
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.526
So you can download all of these
things and there are other cool

80
00:06:14.526 --> 00:06:19.313
stuff like protein data that
you can download and visualize,

81
00:06:19.313 --> 00:06:24.950
note NASA recently I have these
resources that you can download as well.

82
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.222
One warning I would give you
is when we were creating

83
00:06:31.222 --> 00:06:35.940
these experiences because we scan them.

84
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:42.692
The the polygon count, polygons are those
triangles that I was telling you about,

85
00:06:42.692 --> 00:06:47.902
was really high, and
when you scan things another thing that's

86
00:06:47.902 --> 00:06:53.596
different is sometimes you have one
that's just pointing outwards so

87
00:06:53.596 --> 00:06:57.480
you still have to go in and
clean it up yourself.

88
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.977
There are some free tools to do that,
blender is one.

89
00:07:03.977 --> 00:07:09.243
You can download it and
you can take a look at it but

90
00:07:09.243 --> 00:07:13.354
if you are not very familiar with 3D,

91
00:07:13.354 --> 00:07:18.365
that will be a thing to learn and
easiest one and

92
00:07:18.365 --> 00:07:23.507
the most performance
one is Poly.google.com

93
00:07:23.507 --> 00:07:28.020
these are usually low poly models.

94
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.934
Unfortunately, Poly announced
that they will be closing and

95
00:07:31.934 --> 00:07:36.550
we had something similar for
Microsoft that close down too.

96
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:43.934
But there's still lots of place that
says that you can find 3D assets,

97
00:07:43.934 --> 00:07:48.979
but just make sure that
you check the polygons and

98
00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:52.320
they are not humongous models.

99
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.547
So the question is,

100
00:07:54.547 --> 00:07:59.660
can we use anything other than JavaScript
to create WebEx our experiences?

101
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.241
You can actually write your own C code and

102
00:08:03.241 --> 00:08:07.710
then use web assembly to
translate it to the web.

103
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:08.606
That's one option.

104
00:08:08.606 --> 00:08:14.362
And you can use other tools as well like,
for example,

105
00:08:14.362 --> 00:08:20.680
unity does have a tool that translated for
you to WebxR.

106
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.020
How performances,
I'm not sure but it is possible.

107
00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:29.960
One question is is Polyclosing for
low demand?

108
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.405
I don't think so it might be.

109
00:08:32.405 --> 00:08:37.553
Google also close Daydream team,
which was their headsets,

110
00:08:37.553 --> 00:08:41.414
very cheap headset that
might be the reason but

111
00:08:41.414 --> 00:08:47.350
also saving all of these models 3D
models is a very expensive thing.

112
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.720
It's probably not cost effective.

113
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.620
One question is can we use same 3D
models for web as well as in unity?

114
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:59.620
Yes, you can, we have multiple
formats of 3D models which

115
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:05.630
we will cover in the section that
you're going to upload our own model.

116
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:11.020
GLTF is the most popular one and
the most efficient one and

117
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.960
that's the one that we recommend but
there are other

118
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:21.236
ones like OBJ that you can also
use both in other tools and

119
00:09:21.236 --> 00:09:26.175
as well as WebExR and
what if you want to translate one

120
00:09:26.175 --> 00:09:30.960
model format to another
blender is a great tool.

121
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.574
But there are other tools that
allows you to do that and

122
00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:36.910
export it as a different formats.

123
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.810
And OBJ and
gltf is pretty much very universal.

124
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.340
All of the 3D tools do support it.

125
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.620
Building a 3D model is
graphic work am I right?

126
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:55.970
It is a great question it is
a different job for sure.

127
00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:01.217
So and this is where I started
I used to create 3D models and

128
00:10:01.217 --> 00:10:05.609
3D animations using some
of the design tools but

129
00:10:05.609 --> 00:10:10.750
looks the people who are creating AR and
VR experiences,

130
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:16.610
designers and
developers are almost merged together.

131
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:21.882
Although I think creating the model
part is a totally different thing and

132
00:10:21.882 --> 00:10:23.890
it requires a lot of work.

133
00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:28.400
So I would definitely recommend
getting some cheaper models from

134
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.238
somewhere else instead of trying to
create it yourself because it will

135
00:10:33.238 --> 00:10:35.700
be a very time consuming thing too.

136
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.901
One thing that I've noticed for
HoloLens developers they

137
00:10:43.901 --> 00:10:49.103
are designers Have been architects
most of time because those

138
00:10:49.103 --> 00:10:54.303
are the people who are used to
working with these 3D models and

139
00:10:54.303 --> 00:10:58.230
are familiar with creating 3D experiences.

140
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:04.009
One question, do we have experienced
with Trimble SketchUp for

141
00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:06.907
architectural presentation.

142
00:11:06.907 --> 00:11:11.120
No, I don't have any experience.

143
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.900
I did work on a whole bunch
of tools at Autodesk,

144
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.610
which allowed you to do
something like that.

145
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:27.276
You could think of it as Word documents
for 3D, which was really exciting work.

146
00:11:27.276 --> 00:11:30.999
&gt;&gt; Sorry,
I one last question before you move on,

147
00:11:30.999 --> 00:11:35.748
is there maybe you mentioned it
the recommended poly size for

148
00:11:35.748 --> 00:11:42.379
each model like don't go over 5000
triangles or over 10,000 triangles.

149
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.083
&gt;&gt; It really depends if you
have a very simple object,

150
00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:52.900
like columns and spheres and
things like that.

151
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.608
You don't actually have to go big but

152
00:11:56.608 --> 00:12:01.631
if you have something
a little bit more detailed,

153
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:07.985
for example a architecture,
then you have to go way up.

154
00:12:07.985 --> 00:12:13.430
And one thing that is going to happen
in the future, it is happening for

155
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:19.635
native development is having services
cloud services like remote rendering.

156
00:12:19.635 --> 00:12:23.657
Right now, for
they're not supporting WebEx R,

157
00:12:23.657 --> 00:12:27.460
I'm sure they will be in the future.

158
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.070
What you can do with that is
if you have a much bigger and

159
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:37.296
in static model like a house you
can render it on the clouds and

160
00:12:37.296 --> 00:12:41.620
that would not use as much computer power.

161
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.510
Anything that you want
to have interaction.

162
00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:49.688
For example, if you want to
change the color of the walls or

163
00:12:49.688 --> 00:12:56.240
click something to change the design
then you have to add that on top of it,

164
00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.230
but still having static things
rendered will help you.

165
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.350
So the answer is unfortunately it depends.

166
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:11.980
If you just have a simple shape,
use the least amount of that looks good.

167
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.220
That's the basic idea.
