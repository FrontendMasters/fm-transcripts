00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.065
It is great that we have some
shapes that we are running,

2
00:00:06.065 --> 00:00:11.356
but more interesting things
to do is when you can import

3
00:00:11.356 --> 00:00:16.315
a model that is built,
maybe even with animation.

4
00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:22.968
On our slides, if you go to the project
section how to load 3D model,

5
00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:28.016
you can copy and
paste the code instead of typing it,

6
00:00:28.016 --> 00:00:34.930
that might be a better way since we
have been having issues with typing.

7
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.122
I already have the file
here with AR.model,

8
00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:47.750
pretty much everything that's
related to AR is exactly the same.

9
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.048
In the case that on select when
instead of creating a shape

10
00:00:54.048 --> 00:00:59.620
when we see the reticle,
we are loading the model.

11
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.900
So first thing that we do
is import GLTF loader,

12
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:13.220
and the model that we have should be
under your disks and assets and models.

13
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.022
And one last thing to check
in this case is your Ts

14
00:01:19.022 --> 00:01:23.485
config file should have the path for
assets.

15
00:01:23.485 --> 00:01:26.712
Here in our own select function,

16
00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:31.436
again we are checking if
the reticle is visible,

17
00:01:31.436 --> 00:01:36.060
but also we are checking
if the model is loaded.

18
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.307
So we set it to false at the beginning,
and then once we load it,

19
00:01:41.307 --> 00:01:46.420
we are going to set it to true so
that we don't load it twice.

20
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.415
This is kind of answering
the question we had earlier

21
00:01:51.415 --> 00:01:55.956
about having multiple
models in the same spot,

22
00:01:55.956 --> 00:02:01.990
if you are loading it just once,
then you get rid of that issue.

23
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.861
And for the models to be loaded
we have the model loader,

24
00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:09.971
and we initiate a loading manager,

25
00:02:09.971 --> 00:02:16.270
this is going to control the way
our loading is going to happen.

26
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.238
In our case, we have a GLTF loader,
and we pass in the manager and

27
00:02:21.238 --> 00:02:24.090
we set the path to the assets.

28
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:32.238
So in this case, I have the church
Ayasofia from my hometown and

29
00:02:32.238 --> 00:02:37.771
we are going to add that
model to our scene,

30
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:40.691
once we add the model,

31
00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:45.638
then we will set model loader to true.

32
00:02:48.252 --> 00:02:53.919
So as on select function,
we have the loader that loads,

33
00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.440
the name of the model itself.

34
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.020
And then the path where it
is going to be added to it,

35
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.649
the path that we gave to our GLTF loader.

36
00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:10.960
We've had a little fun,
we have a callback function,

37
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.271
when we have the GLTF,
we set the position of the GLTF,

38
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:23.370
the model itself from the matrix
position from the reticle matrix.

39
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.073
So, if you remember we were looking for

40
00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:31.788
the reticle and
anytime if we have both reticle and

41
00:03:31.788 --> 00:03:37.398
moral then we place it in
the exact location of the reticle,

42
00:03:37.398 --> 00:03:40.560
and set the model loader to true.

43
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.956
And we have a error function that
you can add, you can also add

44
00:03:46.956 --> 00:03:52.390
different on start, on load,
on progress functionality.

45
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.523
So if you want to for
example display a waiting wheel,

46
00:03:57.523 --> 00:04:01.058
then you can use these on progress and

47
00:04:01.058 --> 00:04:05.859
how much progress it is,
you can display it here.

48
00:04:08.558 --> 00:04:12.143
Okay, and let's try to run this one,

49
00:04:12.143 --> 00:04:17.968
now I'm going to change in my
HTML file under this index HTML,

50
00:04:17.968 --> 00:04:23.479
instead of the ar.js I'm going
to run the aAR model.js,

51
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:30.497
Okay, and let's see, it should work,

52
00:04:30.497 --> 00:04:39.527
I'm just going to restart my server just
in case because whenever you change,

53
00:04:39.527 --> 00:04:44.300
I forgot to say, whenever you change HTML,

54
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.730
it doesn't necessarily pick up,
NPM, run dev.

55
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.430
Okay, now we have the server
running on port 3000,

56
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.945
we should be able to inspect it, so

57
00:04:58.945 --> 00:05:04.670
I'm going to reload it here,
and let me open up my view,

58
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.562
I'm looking for a surface, once I find it,

59
00:05:20.562 --> 00:05:26.358
click on it, and voila,
my model is loaded.

60
00:05:32.756 --> 00:05:34.204
But it's frozen.

61
00:05:38.764 --> 00:05:43.193
All right,
this is a very pretty big model,

62
00:05:43.193 --> 00:05:48.583
this is from google.poly.org,
maybe that is why,

63
00:05:48.583 --> 00:05:54.840
maybe because we are doing a lot of stuff,
I'll try it again.

64
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:05.297
Please walk around, in my house I
was able to go from room to room and

65
00:06:05.297 --> 00:06:11.457
the model was still workable inside it,
which was really nice to see.

66
00:06:11.457 --> 00:06:16.743
And the scale of it, you can change it,
you can even put some controls so

67
00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:21.942
that people can have a smaller version
of it or a bigger version of it and

68
00:06:21.942 --> 00:06:26.110
see the difference between the outside and
the inside.
