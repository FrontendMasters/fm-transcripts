WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.509
Lastly, we have AFrame,

2
00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:07.570
which is another library that
is written on top of Three.js,

3
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:13.140
which gives you a more declarative
way of defining your 3D scenes.

4
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.910
And here is our scene,
that we can take a look.

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.356
So basically what it does is
creates these web components and

6
00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:30.106
gives you an opportunity to define
everything through their properties.

7
00:00:30.106 --> 00:00:34.547
So this is a really cool way
of creating an application and

8
00:00:34.547 --> 00:00:37.241
prototyping things really fast.

9
00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:41.790
But at the same time, I feel like it's

10
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.480
hiding what working in a canvas is, and

11
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.593
I find it a little confusing
because I have a totally

12
00:00:52.593 --> 00:00:59.910
different model of what HTML
is versus what's canvases.

13
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.110
And seeing things that are on canvas
as HTML is a little confusing to me.

14
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.780
But it is a awesome library.

15
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.460
And if you don't want to codes a lot of
things, don't wanna write all of those

16
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.330
functions, this is a easy and
fast way of creating the same scene.

17
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.355
So, as you can see here we do
have a scene object that is

18
00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:30.180
the container of our scene,
and everything in our scene.

19
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.276
And we have a box, sphere, cylinder, and

20
00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:38.266
all of the properties that we would
normally define in a JavaScript,

21
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:44.540
you can define it here with the position,
rotation, color, animation.

22
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.083
One cool thing about this is
you can start with a frame,

23
00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:55.503
but when you have hit a block
where you are not able to do

24
00:01:55.503 --> 00:02:01.090
what you want to do,
you can still use some Three.js.

25
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:09.930
The other really cool part of this is
that they have VR sets from the get go.

26
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.599
So you don't have to worry
about adding any VR checks or

27
00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.450
buttons, it's already there.
