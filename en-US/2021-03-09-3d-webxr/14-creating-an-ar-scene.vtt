00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.189
We are actually going to change
that now to an AR button in fact.

2
00:00:07.646 --> 00:00:12.444
So it's but
everything else will be the same, and

3
00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:17.367
only instead of the art we
are going to save it as AR.

4
00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:24.835
And because we already had,

5
00:00:24.835 --> 00:00:29.651
added the button now the button itself is

6
00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:35.050
going to just change to AR instead of VR.

7
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.215
We don't have to do anything differently,

8
00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:45.250
remember to run NPM run
NPM dev NPM run dev.

9
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.074
Also, sometimes the problem is when
we change anything on the HTML file,

10
00:00:53.074 --> 00:00:58.649
we have to restart our server because
those changes doesn't get picked up.

11
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.098
And if that's the reason why you should

12
00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:12.581
be able to solve it by
restarting your server.

13
00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:17.011
Right, again we are having
an issue with ARs.

14
00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.418
And ART is line 30.

15
00:01:40.451 --> 00:01:45.280
So, I was getting an error if
you just downloaded what I had.

16
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.230
One of the things that we were missing was
a comma inside our mesh Pong material.

17
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.914
We are still adding the VR button but
instead,

18
00:01:58.914 --> 00:02:03.553
I should add the R button and this time,

19
00:02:03.553 --> 00:02:10.170
I will add the optional feature,
which is the hit test.

20
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.860
Sorry, it was an optional feature,
it was a required feature.

21
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.614
So this demo itself is going
to require the hit test,

22
00:02:19.614 --> 00:02:26.400
which is when you see a surface and
you think you can put something on it.

23
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.170
We detect that surface with the hit test.

24
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.360
So that your objects
are not flying around, but

25
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.600
they look like they're in
the actual environments.

26
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.488
Once I fix the button issue now
are both in turn into AR and

27
00:02:41.488 --> 00:02:48.620
it's not supported on this device so
I'm not going to be able to see it there.

28
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.401
But if you go back to your,
devices, inspect devices,

29
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:57.280
I should be able to open it and
debug it there.

30
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.679
So, if you are able to see this
you few things that you could do,

31
00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:08.320
you can focus on this tab reloaded or
inspected.

32
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.974
It's going back to into a VR
environment although it has it says AR,

33
00:03:13.974 --> 00:03:18.156
so let's take a look at it
where we have the issue.

34
00:03:22.341 --> 00:03:27.644
First thing we did is to
download button which is good,

35
00:03:27.644 --> 00:03:32.142
and we requested attendance
create render and

36
00:03:32.142 --> 00:03:36.770
required feature hits us,
which is also good.

37
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.720
One of the things that we have to do for
AR and VR experiences is to

38
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.130
change request animation frame
to render a set animation loop.

39
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:56.250
So this is a special function, now 80
of the render for especially with xR.

40
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.990
Most of the normal animations on the web,
they have to run 60 frames per second.

41
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.814
But in the case of xR, usually that's much

42
00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:12.638
higher if you're on
a VR headset that could

43
00:04:12.638 --> 00:04:17.600
be 90 pictures per second or even higher.

44
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:26.424
So we have to make sure that we use that,
so let's go back to it and refresh it

45
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.783
All right now I am seeing
through the camera that

46
00:04:40.783 --> 00:04:45.065
means that this is an AR experience.

47
00:04:45.065 --> 00:04:50.109
But what is happening is that
my Earth is in this corner and

48
00:04:50.109 --> 00:04:54.560
when I move my camera it
moves with my camera.

49
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.950
So that's not what we want, so
this is where the hits us comes in.

50
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.271
Now we have to find a surface and
make sure that we

51
00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:08.360
are hitting that surface
before we place our 3D model.
