00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.727
If you are all caught up,
we have an exercise for you.

2
00:00:05.727 --> 00:00:11.276
Try other object types and loaders to
add different models to your scene.

3
00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:17.651
If you are looking for the models,
you can open up under your Node.js,

4
00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:22.337
you can open up
the three.js/examples/models.

5
00:00:22.337 --> 00:00:27.187
And you can see the models
that are available to you.

6
00:00:27.187 --> 00:00:30.749
And there are multiple types of objects,

7
00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.523
some of them are OBJ,
some of them are glTF.

8
00:00:34.523 --> 00:00:39.352
Depending on the type of
the model you have to download,

9
00:00:39.352 --> 00:00:43.784
I mean, you have to use
a different kind of loader.

10
00:00:43.784 --> 00:00:47.785
And with every loader,

11
00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:53.593
the setup might slightly change.

12
00:00:53.593 --> 00:00:58.785
Your parameters might change for
the meshes,

13
00:00:58.785 --> 00:01:04.773
and you can just search for
it on Three.js, loader,

14
00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:10.645
or maybe the documentation
might be a better place.

15
00:01:10.645 --> 00:01:15.442
Okay, loading a 3-D model,
and you can see all

16
00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:20.356
of the different kinds of
object loaders is here,

17
00:01:20.356 --> 00:01:25.505
glTF, and
some troubleshooting tips are here too.

18
00:01:25.505 --> 00:01:30.723
Here, there are some
examples with different

19
00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:37.426
model loaders as well that you can,
if you have FBX, glTF.

20
00:01:37.426 --> 00:01:42.736
You can click on the right bottom corner
of the examples, most of the time,

21
00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:47.136
and that will take you directly
to the example code on GitHub.
