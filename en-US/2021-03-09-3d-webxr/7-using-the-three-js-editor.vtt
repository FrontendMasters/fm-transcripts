1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.670
We are coming to the part that we
are going to create our local version.

2
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.810
But one thing I did not show
you was the three.js editor.

3
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.361
I just wanted to go
over it really quickly.

4
00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:26.790
So, like the playground of Babylon.js,
this is the editor of three.js.

5
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:33.079
And what you can do is create a new
file or start from something and

6
00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.570
you can add all of these shapes and
lights are over here.

7
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.455
Ambient lights, directional lights, point
lights, and you have different cameras.

8
00:00:46.455 --> 00:00:52.940
Let's choose a perspective camera and
add a sphere.

9
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.060
So I'm going to actually
move the camera towards me.

10
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.300
This is a good way of seeing, yeah,
everything is created right in the center.

11
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:15.200
So now I have the sphere,
but it looks really black.

12
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.220
And we have the mesh standard material.

13
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.065
So it does have a material but
it's not rendering well.

14
00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:26.535
The reason is we are missing the lighting.

15
00:01:26.535 --> 00:01:29.825
So I'll create a directional light.

16
00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:35.018
And as you can see, directional
light comes from one direction,

17
00:01:35.018 --> 00:01:38.420
and points to our object right here.

18
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.117
That means that it is going
to create some shadows for

19
00:01:43.117 --> 00:01:47.705
us and if you want to create
a more equalized light,

20
00:01:47.705 --> 00:01:52.250
hemisphere light will be a good option.

21
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.760
And point light is almost
like a candle light.

22
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.030
So the further you go away from the light
source you will have less power.

23
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.680
&gt;&gt; And, yeah,
it pretty much works like a candlelight.

24
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:15.940
So, [COUGH] on here we all we can
also just click on the object itself.

25
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.798
Again, it is grouped by the theme.

26
00:02:18.798 --> 00:02:22.711
And we can see all of its attributes and

27
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:26.508
then we can change them here as well.

28
00:02:26.508 --> 00:02:30.979
And one thing I wanted to show

29
00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:36.008
you is how to add a little bit more

30
00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:42.030
interest to our very simple sphere.

31
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.685
So since we were talking about
making the model's performance,

32
00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:56.236
one way is to cheat it using
some interesting textures.

33
00:02:56.236 --> 00:03:00.833
And instead of having
a detailed model of things,

34
00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:07.628
you can sometimes have the same effects
by using materials and bump maps.

35
00:03:07.628 --> 00:03:12.567
And this material is included in
the Github repository that we're

36
00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:13.898
going to work on.

37
00:03:13.898 --> 00:03:18.880
So sphere is not very interesting but
if we put an earth map on it,

38
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.760
and now you have to click it to see it.

39
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.290
So now we do have a earth, so you can add
even data visualization on top of it.

40
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.766
And for
the bump map this is going to describe

41
00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:42.204
how bumpy it looks without having
to add more vertices to our scene.

42
00:03:42.204 --> 00:03:46.840
So I have this bump map included.

43
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.450
So if we click on it, you can see that
it already looks a little bit more 3D.

44
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.381
This is very low quality but

45
00:03:56.381 --> 00:04:02.220
because of that it also
looks like it's out of box.

46
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:09.860
So I'm gonna increase
a little bit it's geometry.

47
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.415
If you look at for every sphere,

48
00:04:13.415 --> 00:04:17.900
one thing that you define is the radius.

49
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.711
So this is going to define how big it is.

50
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:24.753
But also we have the segments.

51
00:04:24.753 --> 00:04:28.183
So this is how many times
this is divided and

52
00:04:28.183 --> 00:04:32.090
it's going to affect the polygon count.

53
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:39.660
So I'm going to increase this to
maybe 12 and see how it looks.

54
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.151
I'm going to change
the height segments too.

55
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:49.820
So now because we have more geometry,
also we have a smoother model.

56
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.564
So if you're going for

57
00:04:54.564 --> 00:04:59.566
a stylistic thing you can still
have a smaller segment count.

58
00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:04.744
So, [COUGH] all right.

59
00:05:04.744 --> 00:05:09.675
And let's go back to our bump map, and

60
00:05:09.675 --> 00:05:12.900
it is defined as one.

61
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.090
And if you go minus, everything that is
supposed to be a mountain goes downwards.

62
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:25.310
So you're inverting
the bump map basically.

63
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.568
And once you are done,
what you can do is download it.

64
00:05:31.568 --> 00:05:35.410
You can publish it here.

65
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:43.430
And I think when you publish it downloads
automatically the end products.

66
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.134
I can now open this with an editor and
show you the code.

67
00:05:50.654 --> 00:05:56.193
We have a index HTML which
loads everything and

68
00:05:56.193 --> 00:06:03.480
I'm guessing it's the same for
any kind of experience.

69
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.481
But what you build on this experience
is going to be on the app.js.

70
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:13.329
So it defines a player that
creates the render, camera,

71
00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:16.570
scene and all of those things.

72
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.543
But what it does is it looks
at a configuration file,

73
00:06:21.543 --> 00:06:24.490
which is app.json over here.

74
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.715
And if you change any of the attributes,

75
00:06:28.715 --> 00:06:32.815
it will be reflected on app.json, and

76
00:06:32.815 --> 00:06:39.920
this will use that app.json to
create exactly what you created.

77
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.684
So this is great that you were
able to create downloads,

78
00:06:43.684 --> 00:06:46.900
a new experience and
you have a way of seeing it.

79
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.396
But at the same time,
it's not very readable code,

80
00:06:50.396 --> 00:06:53.904
because most important
parts are in the app.json.

81
00:06:53.904 --> 00:06:59.330
&gt;&gt; Can you round out the polygons,
a chamfer or chamfer mild perhaps?

82
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.217
Just to make it appear more rounded
without having to add more and

83
00:07:04.217 --> 00:07:05.490
more polygons?

84
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.855
&gt;&gt; The question is can
we make things smoother

85
00:07:09.855 --> 00:07:14.592
without having to add more and
more polygons?

86
00:07:14.592 --> 00:07:19.550
One way to do it is having a normal map.

87
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.884
What bump map does for
creating depth and height,

88
00:07:24.884 --> 00:07:30.472
normal map does something similar but
it adds some,

89
00:07:30.472 --> 00:07:37.584
if you have something that's very edgy,
it smooths out the edge.

90
00:07:37.584 --> 00:07:45.620
But it's a little bit more
complicated to work with normal maps.

91
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:52.009
So basically what a bump map is,
is a black and white representation,

92
00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:57.440
everything grey is going to be
between height or no height.

93
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.420
But with normal map,
it is a little bit more complicated.

94
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.620
That's one way.

95
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.761
Other than that, for the mesh itself,
there is no way of making

96
00:08:08.761 --> 00:08:14.310
it smoother without having to
add any polygons, unfortunately.

97
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.981
Before you create more polygons,

98
00:08:16.981 --> 00:08:23.055
you should definitely try to achieve what
you want to do with these bump maps.

99
00:08:23.055 --> 00:08:28.495
If you look at the corner, there's
actually nothing that is sticking out.

100
00:08:28.495 --> 00:08:33.442
It's still very rounded in the corners,

101
00:08:33.442 --> 00:08:37.835
but the look of it is not the same.

102
00:08:37.835 --> 00:08:40.515
It looks like we can
actually see the mountains.
