00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.190
But we have an exercise for the next one.

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.007
If you are able to run this and
if everything works,

3
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:11.266
then maybe you can
create another material,

4
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:16.620
another sphere, and
add a transparent material.

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.530
And I have the clouds material for
you that you can add

6
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.640
to create a cloud running
on top of the earth.

7
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.330
If there's anyone who is having a hard
time to run it, I'm happy to help now.
