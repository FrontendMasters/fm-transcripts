1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.054
And this is the fun part.

2
00:00:02.054 --> 00:00:05.990
We are going to add VR and
AR capabilities to our little project.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.327
To be able to do that and be able to debug
it, we have to turn on developer settings.

4
00:00:14.327 --> 00:00:17.380
And it is different for every device.

5
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.897
For example, for Android,
you have to go to About Page,

6
00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:28.480
click on the about device seven times,
which is like a secret handshake.

7
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.764
And I have the link for iOS, Android, and

8
00:00:32.764 --> 00:00:37.300
Samsung, and HoloLens, Oculus, and HP.

9
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.177
If you can enable whatever
device that you're using,

10
00:00:41.177 --> 00:00:44.780
it totally can be mobile device as well.

11
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.574
And while you do that,
I would like to show you some

12
00:00:49.574 --> 00:00:54.110
of the cool interactions with HoloLens.

13
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.760
First thing that HoloLens does is when
I put it on, it recognizes my eyes.

14
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.385
So I don't have to sign in.

15
00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:07.349
It automatically assigns
me into my account and

16
00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:10.337
there's a little lag.

17
00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:13.876
You might not see it but
the menu is on my wrists.

18
00:01:17.255 --> 00:01:19.368
I'm trying to make sure that you see it.

19
00:01:19.368 --> 00:01:21.630
So if you can see, that's the menu.

20
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.469
I tap on it, and
then the menu actually opens,

21
00:01:26.755 --> 00:01:31.325
Which is a really cool way of
hiding lots of buttons around you.

22
00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:34.764
And now I can choose the application.

23
00:01:41.185 --> 00:01:43.723
As you can see,
I can move things around with my hand.

24
00:01:43.723 --> 00:01:44.792
It's very intuitive.

25
00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:49.428
And unlike the first version of the
HoloLens, you don't have to remember any

26
00:01:49.428 --> 00:01:52.510
of the specific hand movements
to be able to use it.

27
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.306
So this is an application
that we created for

28
00:01:58.306 --> 00:02:05.310
making understanding 3D apps and
design a little bit better.

29
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.730
And we wanted to put
everything into context.

30
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:15.450
So we have an app that you can
actually see how things really work.

31
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.168
So all right, let's do the hand tracking.

32
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.970
I really like these 3D icons, if you will.

33
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.481
They're really so much fun.

34
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:37.830
As you can see-
&gt;&gt; Hand tracking is one of the core

35
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.050
features of HoloLens.

36
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.345
It allows the device to recognize your
hands and fingers and track them in space.

37
00:02:44.345 --> 00:02:46.477
&gt;&gt; I will make it less loud.

38
00:02:46.477 --> 00:02:51.599
So you can actually move anything with

39
00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.571
your hands from far away or close by.

40
00:02:56.571 --> 00:03:00.994
And if you are close, you can actually
pull and push from the corners and

41
00:03:00.994 --> 00:03:03.145
you can turn them from the middle.

42
00:03:04.465 --> 00:03:06.415
It's a really nice interaction.

43
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.170
And let's see what the field of view is.

44
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.257
If you remember in the section of cameras,

45
00:03:16.257 --> 00:03:21.167
we talked about the field of view.

46
00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:25.381
What you see is the field
of view of the camera.

47
00:03:28.767 --> 00:03:34.408
Okay, I'm having an issue with this one.

48
00:03:34.408 --> 00:03:39.711
Okay, And this is my friend, Dan.

49
00:03:39.711 --> 00:03:45.550
He went into a capture studio,
what we call Mixed Reality Capture Studio.

50
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.413
So we have a 3D moving version of him.

51
00:03:50.413 --> 00:03:54.295
So we can put it into an environment,

52
00:03:54.295 --> 00:03:58.933
which this whole
environment is digital but

53
00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:04.587
he is real in a green,
painted spatial capture studio

54
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.130
And we are seeing the field
of view interaction.

55
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.484
So one thing about HoloLens
is that it has extra cameras

56
00:04:21.484 --> 00:04:25.090
that are just to watch
your hands basically.

57
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.550
They are looking outwards and
it doesn't have to do anything inwards.

58
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.377
As you can see, this is my hands.

59
00:04:32.377 --> 00:04:34.958
My hands still exists out far.

60
00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.626
But what I see is
the middle section inside.
