WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.235
So I have a little exercise for you,
if you open the same playgrounds,

2
00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:09.494
and move your mouse around the box,
and click and drag and

3
00:00:09.494 --> 00:00:12.451
see if you are able to interact with it.

4
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:16.487
And afterwards uncomment line 5 and
save, or

5
00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:23.119
play the playground example just to get
you a little familiar with Babylon.

6
00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.293
And we have a question,
any thoughts on Babylon versus Three.js?

7
00:00:28.293 --> 00:00:31.575
And I do get asked this question a lot.

8
00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:34.058
We will cover Three.js, as well.

9
00:00:34.058 --> 00:00:36.293
I will show you three
different libraries actually.

10
00:00:36.293 --> 00:00:39.474
And the third one is a frame.

11
00:00:39.474 --> 00:00:44.528
And both Babylon and
Three.js are doing exactly the same thing.

12
00:00:44.528 --> 00:00:48.228
I am not aware of the differences,
there must be, but

13
00:00:48.228 --> 00:00:50.954
the tooling is a little bit different.

14
00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:56.523
That is one thing that might change your

15
00:00:56.523 --> 00:01:02.274
decision on using one versus the other.

16
00:01:02.274 --> 00:01:10.391
So Babylon.js has these really
interesting node-based editors.

17
00:01:10.391 --> 00:01:14.400
So if you have ever worked with Unity or
Unreal Engine,

18
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.936
you might be familiar with these.

19
00:01:16.936 --> 00:01:22.495
So you can plug different parts
of the codes into each other,

20
00:01:22.495 --> 00:01:27.509
and then something that would
take a lot of code writing

21
00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.200
would be much easier to do
with these node editors.

22
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.577
They also have particle editor that

23
00:01:38.577 --> 00:01:42.616
you can go into, and yeah, so

24
00:01:42.616 --> 00:01:48.280
those are the things that I really enjoy.

25
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.567
Three.js does have a editor as well, but

26
00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:56.487
I didn't find it as useful because for

27
00:01:56.487 --> 00:02:01.141
some reason when I
downloade it there was some

28
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:06.040
things that it was really
hard to understand and

29
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.712
the positioning was not working perfectly.

30
00:02:10.712 --> 00:02:13.510
And what about GreenSock?

31
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.109
I heard that one is really
popular among a lot of companies.

32
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.100
As far as I remember GreenSock
was a animation tool.

33
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.419
There are lots of paid tools as welll,

34
00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:31.310
kind of would be like GreenSock,
Etwall is one of them.

35
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.207
It allows you to do things that
are not currently very possible

36
00:02:38.207 --> 00:02:44.130
implemented in in WebXR APIs to
which is really, really neat.

37
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.970
But the cost is high as far as I've heard.

38
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.313
&gt;&gt; I have a question about Node Editor.

39
00:02:50.313 --> 00:02:53.752
Is it just for materials?

40
00:02:53.752 --> 00:02:59.138
&gt;&gt; No, the Particle Editor
is kind of similar to, and

41
00:02:59.138 --> 00:03:07.175
I believe the point is to make everything
possible with these Node Editors.

42
00:03:07.175 --> 00:03:09.876
And let's see the material literature.

43
00:03:14.404 --> 00:03:18.944
Okay, so yeah,
this is their new documentation page for

44
00:03:18.944 --> 00:03:23.360
Babylon.js, and
it's really nicely organized.

45
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.099
So if you go onto the tools,
you can see the asset libraries

46
00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.810
that you can use and
utility functions, and all tutorials.

47
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.792
And if you click on any
of the documentation,

48
00:03:38.792 --> 00:03:44.571
you also get the examples and
where you can see them.

49
00:03:49.257 --> 00:03:50.380
Well, maybe not in this one.

50
00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:58.086
So they have the Node Material Editor,
Particle Editor,

51
00:03:58.086 --> 00:04:00.939
Sprite Editor, Texture Inspector, and

52
00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:06.581
the new thing that they just released is
the Skeleton Viewer which is really neat.

53
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:10.652
So when you go to the documentation
on the right side,

54
00:04:10.652 --> 00:04:15.547
they have the examples that you
can click on and see how it works.

55
00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:22.509
For those of you who are not familiar
with what the skeleton will be,

56
00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:29.475
is when you're creating an animation
like this cool guy over here,

57
00:04:29.475 --> 00:04:34.849
the way you move things kind
of naturally is by adding

58
00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.766
some of the underlying
bone structure in a way.

59
00:04:39.766 --> 00:04:43.644
And you you would also
paint like how much that

60
00:04:43.644 --> 00:04:48.046
bone structure would move
some parts of the model.

61
00:04:48.046 --> 00:04:52.806
But if you have any issues
with this skeleton,

62
00:04:52.806 --> 00:04:55.988
it's really hard to debug it.

63
00:04:55.988 --> 00:05:04.461
You have to go back to the tool that you
created this animation maybe, and see it.

64
00:05:04.461 --> 00:05:07.642
But if there is something
specific to your application,

65
00:05:07.642 --> 00:05:09.639
it's really hard to figure it out.

66
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.407
So with this tool,
you can capture it, and debug it, and

67
00:05:14.407 --> 00:05:16.930
see all of the information over here.

68
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.306
So we have the skeleton group, and

69
00:05:22.306 --> 00:05:27.486
we can dive into specifics
of the Yeti over here.

70
00:05:27.486 --> 00:05:31.113
And then you can see
all of the information,

71
00:05:31.113 --> 00:05:35.044
transformations, and animations over here.

72
00:05:41.762 --> 00:05:47.648
So tooling is one and they are both
written with TypeScript right now,

73
00:05:47.648 --> 00:05:52.560
the Three.js and Babylon.js,
which I'm a huge fan of.

74
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.969
So there's no difference there too.

75
00:05:58.356 --> 00:06:03.228
Three.js has been around for
a little bit longer, I believe, and

76
00:06:03.228 --> 00:06:08.196
they have a little bit more resources
when you go to stack overflow.

77
00:06:08.196 --> 00:06:11.301
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I got too wrapped
up in what you were saying,

78
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:13.852
which line were we supposed to comment on?

79
00:06:13.852 --> 00:06:17.437
&gt;&gt; Line 5, I'm actually going
to do it here too, so [LAUGH].

80
00:06:17.437 --> 00:06:24.355
So before that line, as you can see I'm
trying to move it and it's not possible.

81
00:06:24.355 --> 00:06:27.000
I have no way of interacting
with the object.

82
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.169
And if I add this line and
then save it, and then run it,

83
00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:38.146
then now I can drag and
move the 3D objects.

84
00:06:38.146 --> 00:06:43.366
So this is attaching
to controls to camera,

85
00:06:43.366 --> 00:06:48.029
and allows you to do anything you like.

86
00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:53.451
The question was how to make
a material from scratch on Babylon.js.

87
00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:59.388
So let's take a look at what we have here.

88
00:06:59.388 --> 00:07:04.200
First, we have a Vector3 position which is

89
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.241
translated into the Word position.

90
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:12.505
World position is the relative
information actually.

91
00:07:12.505 --> 00:07:17.814
And we have the View X Projection,

92
00:07:17.814 --> 00:07:24.414
and we have some RGBA, and VertexOutput.

93
00:07:24.414 --> 00:07:25.362
Let's see.

94
00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:29.356
This is a very new editor
actually just came out last week.

95
00:07:29.356 --> 00:07:32.872
So I'm going to give it a try for
the first time too.

96
00:07:32.872 --> 00:07:37.697
And now we could see what is being

97
00:07:37.697 --> 00:07:42.523
displayed is using the material

98
00:07:42.523 --> 00:07:46.645
that we are creating here.

99
00:07:46.645 --> 00:07:55.235
There should be a place that we
create a new one, like this one.

100
00:07:58.977 --> 00:08:04.643
Actually, can we just get back to this
one because I haven't played with this,

101
00:08:04.643 --> 00:08:05.921
this is very new?

102
00:08:05.921 --> 00:08:07.972
I'll take a look, and
then maybe after the break.

103
00:08:07.972 --> 00:08:13.201
So the question was when we
are creating the box object,

104
00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:16.993
and if we give height -2 what happens?

105
00:08:16.993 --> 00:08:22.665
[LAUGH] That is a specific situation,
I've never tried to,

106
00:08:22.665 --> 00:08:27.096
let's put it to work here and
see how it looks.

107
00:08:27.096 --> 00:08:34.039
I'm going to close In spector Editor and
move this one a bit.

108
00:08:36.251 --> 00:08:43.696
So one of the exercise was to play with
the box and have a width and a height.

109
00:08:43.696 --> 00:08:48.054
But in this case,
our friend Patrick here decide to try

110
00:08:48.054 --> 00:08:52.760
the negative version, and
let's see what happens.

111
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.550
So it actually went the other way,
as far as I can tell.

112
00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:02.979
So if you ever worked with a 3D tool,
what you do is basically

113
00:09:02.979 --> 00:09:07.769
extrude an object on one direction,
and usually up,

114
00:09:07.769 --> 00:09:12.900
but in this case it's
extruding towards the bottom.

115
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.928
Lighting is a default lighting, but

116
00:09:15.928 --> 00:09:22.000
I think what it does is it took the
surface on one side and then pull it back.

117
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.725
That's why it looks hollow.

118
00:09:23.725 --> 00:09:28.332
And another question is where
do I get an XR add-on to Chrome?

119
00:09:28.332 --> 00:09:33.158
I have all of the things
that you will need for

120
00:09:33.158 --> 00:09:37.079
this section under the Resources.

121
00:09:37.079 --> 00:09:43.301
So one of the things that you would need
to have to run the server is Node.js.

122
00:09:43.301 --> 00:09:49.058
And if you are not working on a device,
there are a few tools that,

123
00:09:49.058 --> 00:09:55.132
well, there's one tool that you
could use which is WebXR Emulator,

124
00:09:55.132 --> 00:10:00.159
and you can find it for
from the Chrome extension store and

125
00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:03.013
add it to your developer tools.

126
00:10:03.013 --> 00:10:10.041
Then you might have this WebXR
device emulators available to you.

127
00:10:10.041 --> 00:10:16.786
And if you do Ctrl+Shift+J or Cmd+Shift+J,

128
00:10:16.786 --> 00:10:22.872
and open up your developer
tools on Chrome,

129
00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:26.993
you might see the WebXR here.

130
00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:31.327
If you're not seeing it, what you can
do is click on this hamburger menu

131
00:10:31.327 --> 00:10:35.818
on the right side and look for the more
tools, and it might be on that site.

132
00:10:35.818 --> 00:10:39.490
And possibly after you download it,

133
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:43.996
you might need to read
restart your browser.

134
00:10:43.996 --> 00:10:48.939
In this case, this experience doesn't
have any WebXR yet, but the idea is

135
00:10:48.939 --> 00:10:53.895
that without having to wear a headset,
you are able to move back and forth.

136
00:10:53.895 --> 00:10:56.522
You have the hand controls, so

137
00:10:56.522 --> 00:11:00.979
the experience should move
at the same time as well.

138
00:11:00.979 --> 00:11:06.295
And also, you have options for
different kinds of headsets that

139
00:11:06.295 --> 00:11:12.214
you can choose from, Google Cardboard
is one, Oculus is another one.

140
00:11:12.214 --> 00:11:15.775
But unfortunately there's
no AR version of it yet.

141
00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:20.232
And for
those of you who are using any iOS device,

142
00:11:20.232 --> 00:11:25.185
WebXR currently is not
available on the Safari.

143
00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:31.667
And what you can do is download this
application called the WebXR Viewer

144
00:11:31.667 --> 00:11:37.630
from the Apple store, so
you have the link on our Resources page.

145
00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:42.090
&gt;&gt; Sorry, did you say there's no WebXR for
augmented reality?

146
00:11:43.634 --> 00:11:48.780
&gt;&gt; There is, the extension is
not covering augmented reality.

147
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:54.840
Basically the way you move the headsets
like that it doesn't work for headsets.

148
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.490
And also there are not very many
augmented reality headsets out there.

149
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:02.340
That's one reason that
we don't have the tools.

150
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.589
But since you are a Unity developer,

151
00:12:07.589 --> 00:12:13.570
you can download the HoloLens 2
Emulator and use it with Unity.
