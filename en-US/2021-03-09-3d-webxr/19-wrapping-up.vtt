00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.445
There are some concepts that I answer in
the concept section of these courses.

2
00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:09.959
In the future, if you go and
get curious about any of the subjects,

3
00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:15.534
you can always use this resource, and I
will be keeping it up to date, hopefully.

4
00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:20.036
[LAUGH] Cool, and we just take a look at

5
00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:24.610
a lot of the three JS functionality.

6
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:31.990
I just want to touch a little bit of
the same thing doing it with Babylon.js.

7
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.352
And just want to tell you a little
bit about the other tools that

8
00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:37.400
are available to you.

9
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.921
At the beginning, I mentioned we have
some components libraries for a HoloLens,

10
00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:51.688
but you can use exactly the same
components with also Oculus for example.

11
00:00:51.688 --> 00:00:55.305
Because they have the same hand tracking,
and

12
00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:59.860
most of the components are very useful for
hand tracking.

13
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.056
And the good news is if you
are interested in developing with Unity,

14
00:01:06.056 --> 00:01:12.040
then you can change this, well,
render this as a very exciting experience.

15
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.789
But if you are not familiar with Unity,
let me warn you,

16
00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:23.410
developing with Unity is a much longer
process than working on the Web.

17
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.890
And this is one of
the advantages of the Web.

18
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.062
Every time you write your function and
press play,

19
00:01:31.062 --> 00:01:34.374
everything works, almost instantly.

20
00:01:34.374 --> 00:01:38.185
Whereas if you are on a Unity or
Unreal Engine,

21
00:01:38.185 --> 00:01:43.683
you have to build it, deploy it,
and it's a much longer process.

22
00:01:43.683 --> 00:01:46.345
But it is really cool to have this option.

23
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:52.420
So, let's talk a little
bit more about Babylon.js.

24
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.807
There's a new version of Babylon as
of last week or the week before,

25
00:01:57.807 --> 00:02:02.610
and there are lots of
really cool functionality.

26
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.568
One of the things that they
are working on is Native Support

27
00:02:08.568 --> 00:02:13.900
with Babylon Native and
Babylon Native React.

28
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.625
So basically,
you can write the same JavaScript file and

29
00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:23.150
be able to deploy it to an Android or
iOS device.

30
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.907
And whenever the WebXR
capabilities are not supported,

31
00:02:27.907 --> 00:02:34.910
then they will use the underlying AR core
or AR kits to render exactly the same.

32
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.286
So this gives us a little bit more
options, little bit more functionality,

33
00:02:40.286 --> 00:02:44.822
and the cool thing is the Native
version also works on HoloLens,

34
00:02:44.822 --> 00:02:47.015
I'm really happy about that.

35
00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:56.192
So Babylon Native is a the new
thing that is, we're trying and

36
00:02:56.192 --> 00:03:00.810
it's good to know that
you could write it once.

37
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.282
And the toolings that we mentioned,
a new material editor,

38
00:03:06.282 --> 00:03:12.614
and also particle editor where you
could create particles that kind of

39
00:03:12.614 --> 00:03:18.640
looks like simulations or
visual effects, which is really nice.

40
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.946
One thing that came with the new
release was hand interactions,

41
00:03:24.946 --> 00:03:27.360
which I'm so happy to see.

42
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.531
And now if you want to build for
Oculus or HoloLens,

43
00:03:31.531 --> 00:03:34.150
now you have a way of doing that.

44
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:43.340
Teleportation is the way we move from
one place to the other in a VR or

45
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.230
experience without having
to go the distance.

46
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.108
And this is one of the things that
got improved with the tooling.

47
00:03:55.626 --> 00:04:01.390
So I want to show you the basic
WebXR set up here as well.

48
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:12.420
First thing that we do is create
our scene and set it as usual.

49
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.915
One thing I want to point out here is
that our camera is not on the centre,

50
00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:20.952
in this case and looking at the centre.

51
00:04:20.952 --> 00:04:24.943
I recommend not to do this, instead,

52
00:04:24.943 --> 00:04:30.681
create the camera always in the centre,
just in case,

53
00:04:30.681 --> 00:04:35.045
in the future,
you might want to do that or

54
00:04:35.045 --> 00:04:39.948
other people can see it
if it's in a HoloLens.

55
00:04:39.948 --> 00:04:44.931
Or any other experience that uses
the center as the user camera app.

56
00:04:48.703 --> 00:04:54.793
If you remember hours ago, here, we have
the controllers attached to our camera so

57
00:04:54.793 --> 00:04:58.300
we can have interaction with our objects.

58
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.260
We have a light intensity,
everything is the same.

59
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:09.541
But one thing that we add for VR in our
experience is just one line of code.

60
00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:13.178
In this case, which is the helper, and

61
00:05:13.178 --> 00:05:18.260
that creates the default
experience async function.

62
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:25.412
What this does is everything
you need to do to have AR or

63
00:05:25.412 --> 00:05:30.009
VR capabilities almost automatically.

64
00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.659
It has some default values, and
if you're okay with the default values,

65
00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:38.810
you can just put one line of code and
then you have the option.

66
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.940
So it looks like it's just VR.

67
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.812
If you want to give some options to it,
you can do that, too.

68
00:05:48.812 --> 00:05:53.580
Or you can use the base
XR experience helper

69
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:59.210
instead of creating a default experience.

70
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.854
Based experience is what
this default experience

71
00:06:03.854 --> 00:06:07.810
async is also using under the hood.

72
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.429
It has more flexibility, and
with everything that has more flexibility,

73
00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:15.666
more responsibility comes.

74
00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:19.921
You have to make sure that
you create your session and

75
00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:22.536
you keep track of your session.

76
00:06:22.536 --> 00:06:28.566
And one good part of it is it has
observables of the XR states,

77
00:06:28.566 --> 00:06:30.870
which you can use.

78
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.495
If, like me, you are a big fan of RXjs or
any observable library,

79
00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:37.950
you can add that here as well.

80
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.536
I have some cool demo links for

81
00:06:40.536 --> 00:06:46.026
the Babylon.js functionality,
and some resources for you.

82
00:06:46.026 --> 00:06:52.844
One of them is Learn XR Reddits, if you
have any questions you wanna ask, join us.

83
00:06:52.844 --> 00:06:59.899
We have a few channels for
WebXR Babylon or XR in general.

84
00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:02.575
If you want to learn things or

85
00:07:02.575 --> 00:07:08.350
what is coming out with the new tools or
new hardware.

86
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:13.257
One other thing I want to mention again,
I think I mentioned it early on,

87
00:07:13.257 --> 00:07:16.020
is mixed reality resources.

88
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:21.518
Here, you can find all of the places
that you can you can get some assets and

89
00:07:21.518 --> 00:07:25.952
interesting blog posts about design,
developments, and

90
00:07:25.952 --> 00:07:30.160
also attending any of the meetups and
conferences.

91
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.473
This is a cool resource.
