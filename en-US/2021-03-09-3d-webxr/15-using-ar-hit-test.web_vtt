00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.080
By trying to type in copying and
pasting, I messed up a bit.

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.800
So we have the finished version
of it I made available.

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.146
You can find it on my GitHub repo
while at the works are finished,

4
00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:17.568
so you can clone this version and then.

5
00:00:17.568 --> 00:00:21.980
Run NPM install and NPM run Dev.

6
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.007
I'll just talk about what we have here.

7
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:32.485
One thing that we did is
to define vertical and

8
00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:37.610
we define a hitter source and
it has source requested.

9
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.020
up top, you can create it
in the render function too.

10
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.878
And we initialize while we initialize our

11
00:00:46.878 --> 00:00:52.570
module we enable xR and
appends the AR button.

12
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.467
We create a button and
Is a required feature we add hit

13
00:00:57.467 --> 00:01:01.150
test because we're going to use that.

14
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.494
We add the controller and
create a on select

15
00:01:05.494 --> 00:01:10.216
events add event listener
to our controller.

16
00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:17.010
In our on select function we are looking
to see if the reticle is visible.

17
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.018
If it's visible, we already
defined that there is a surface so

18
00:01:20.018 --> 00:01:22.020
we don't have to do anything.

19
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.210
If not, then we can create a geometry,
which is the reticle itself.

20
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.860
Well, sorry, create the geometry of the,
whatever we want.

21
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.890
In our case, it's the earth.

22
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.220
And sets the mashes position
from where the reticle is.

23
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.177
So set from matrix position and
reticle that matrix will take

24
00:01:47.177 --> 00:01:52.050
the exact position of the reticle and
assign it to the mesh.

25
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.290
And then finally we add
our mesh to our scene.

26
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.370
So basically what is going to happen
is first we are going to look for

27
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.600
the surface.

28
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.599
And if we can find the surface we
are going to create a new mesh and

29
00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:09.120
add that to our scene afterwards.

30
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:15.953
So It won't be flying on the air or
it won't be created right away.

31
00:02:15.953 --> 00:02:21.908
And in our render function
what we are doing is checking

32
00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:27.475
if we have xR session available
by checking to see if

33
00:02:27.475 --> 00:02:33.620
our render function has
the XR frame available.

34
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.032
If you are not in a XR session, what will
happen is you will have the time stamp,

35
00:02:39.032 --> 00:02:41.329
but you won't have the XR frame.

36
00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:49.736
So I'm not going to correct the spelling
of XR frame seems like it is

37
00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:52.230
working correctly.

38
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.237
So one thing I'm doing
in this specific case,

39
00:02:56.237 --> 00:03:01.270
first thing I created was an earth and
I want it to be visible

40
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.050
before a user gets into
any immersive experience.

41
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.906
The reason is that it's really annoying
to not know what you're going to

42
00:03:10.906 --> 00:03:14.790
see in an immersive experience
before you go into it.

43
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.868
So it's a better very way of
having a user interface is to show

44
00:03:19.868 --> 00:03:26.840
them what they will see first before
they go into the immersive experience.

45
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.649
So since I know that we are in
an immersive experience because of

46
00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:33.460
the wire frame.

47
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.100
I'm going to change the visibility
of the earth and to false.

48
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.386
I could also dispose this object so

49
00:03:42.386 --> 00:03:47.372
that I won't have anything
until I find a surface and

50
00:03:47.372 --> 00:03:51.352
then creates the object in that surface.

51
00:03:57.392 --> 00:04:02.226
One thing that we are checking
is our reference space.

52
00:04:02.226 --> 00:04:11.460
Reference space defines how are experience
are going to be used by our user.

53
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.428
For example, you one of your option
is to have your user sit down and

54
00:04:16.428 --> 00:04:20.090
just interact in this small environments.

55
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.349
The other one is standing up like this and

56
00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:28.980
not moving so much from where we are.

57
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.383
We also have an option to have infinite
amount of space which means that you

58
00:04:33.383 --> 00:04:37.872
can go from one room to the other and
your experience still will follow you.

59
00:04:40.484 --> 00:04:47.324
And then we are checking
the session getting the session,

60
00:04:47.324 --> 00:04:51.930
which will bring us the XR manager which

61
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.688
has some of the methods that we will use.

62
00:04:56.688 --> 00:05:02.506
And if the hit test source
request is equal to false,

63
00:05:02.506 --> 00:05:08.194
then we set the request
reference base to viewer and

64
00:05:08.194 --> 00:05:15.750
then request the hit test source
after that with that information.

65
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.202
And we add a end event, which is

66
00:05:22.202 --> 00:05:27.970
going to be the end of our session.

67
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.920
And we have to just clean
out our data source.

68
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.224
Finally, if we have the hitter source,

69
00:05:40.224 --> 00:05:44.970
we are getting the results
which is going to be an array.

70
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.929
And if we have anything in our array,

71
00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:55.699
we take the first which will be
the first place that we select and

72
00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:01.831
put our reticle there and
then get the position of the post

73
00:06:01.831 --> 00:06:06.850
to put the reticles matrix
to the right place.

74
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:15.320
Let's see what happens when we run it
seems like people are able to run it.

75
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.210
That's great.

76
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.460
If you're still having
an issue please let me know.

77
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.950
And we do have the port running.

78
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.940
And let's go do this.

79
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.670
Okay, good.

80
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:30.740
Click inspect.

81
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.240
So this is the earth.

82
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.256
It doesn't have [LAUGH]
The materials that we had.

83
00:06:35.256 --> 00:06:36.670
Sorry about that.

84
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:43.760
But this, I want it to be disappear
after I go into an immersive experience.

85
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:50.400
So I'm going to do that
I have the saturd And

86
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.800
I click on the AR session now.

87
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.764
I lost that one.

88
00:06:56.764 --> 00:07:01.932
Now I'm looking for a surface and
if you are not able to see

89
00:07:01.932 --> 00:07:07.548
any surfaces keep looking around and
finally you will hit it.

90
00:07:07.548 --> 00:07:13.294
And if you still can't find it,
one of the problems could be either

91
00:07:13.294 --> 00:07:19.460
you don't have a clean enough surface or
you don't have enough light.

92
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:27.460
So when I click it, there will be new
objects created in these locations.

93
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:34.187
So now, as you can see,
they are stable in their position and

94
00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:37.880
they are not moving with the experience.
