1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.920
So the question was how do you
do accessibility in WebXR?

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.070
It is a tough one.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.330
We are trying to figure
this out ourselves.

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.894
But with XR itself Is only a way for the
BPI to give you the sensor information for

5
00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:24.280
you to create a immersive web experience.

6
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.880
So basically, WebXR is not in itself
rendering anything on your screen.

7
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.700
You are doing that with WebGR or you're
doing that with Babylon or Three.js.

8
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.370
But you are having access to
it through the WebXR APIs.

9
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.042
So, since we have nothing
to do with the content,

10
00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:53.614
it is hard for us to have any
enforced way of having accessibility.

11
00:00:53.614 --> 00:00:57.660
But one of the things that is coming for

12
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.502
WebXR is layers which is a way of adding
a layer of HTML on top of the Canvas,

13
00:01:05.502 --> 00:01:10.710
and maybe that layer can
follow you everywhere.

14
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.980
Having layers allows you to
have some alt text as well.

15
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.939
So you could connect those
layers to maybe the objects and

16
00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.860
make it accessible that way.

17
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.109
But unfortunately,
that all depends on the developer itself,

18
00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.285
which is a hard situation
to be in because,

19
00:01:36.794 --> 00:01:41.771
It is already, you have to cover so
many situations with any AR or

20
00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:46.840
VR experiences, especially for
AR, you don't know the space,

21
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.270
you don't know any of
the needs of the user.

22
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.210
So that's a huge problem.

23
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.036
But having said that, there are really
cool things that you could do for

24
00:01:58.036 --> 00:02:00.940
accessibility, if that's your purpose.

25
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.576
One of them is, I'm going to search for

26
00:02:05.576 --> 00:02:10.880
is seeing AI from one of our coworkers.

27
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.190
And thank you for asking this.

28
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.260
I love showing this video.

29
00:02:17.963 --> 00:02:19.240
&gt;&gt; I'm Saqib Shaikh.

30
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.184
I lost my sight when I was seven,
and shortly after that,

31
00:02:24.184 --> 00:02:26.412
I went to a school for the blind.

32
00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:30.390
And that's where it was
introduced to talking computers.

33
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.276
And that really opened up a whole
new world of opportunities.

34
00:02:34.276 --> 00:02:38.540
I joined Microsoft ten years
ago as a software engineer.

35
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.480
I love making things which
improve people's lives.

36
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.721
And one of the things I've always dreamt
of since I was at university was this

37
00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:50.170
idea of something that could tell you at
any moment what's going on around you.

38
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.384
[MUSIC]

39
00:02:53.384 --> 00:02:56.425
&gt;&gt; I think it's a man jumping in
the air doing a trick on a skateboard.

40
00:02:56.425 --> 00:02:59.224
[MUSIC]

41
00:02:59.224 --> 00:03:03.220
&gt;&gt; I teamed up with like minded engineers
to make an app which lets you know who and

42
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.190
what is around you.

43
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.599
It's based on top of
the Microsoft intelligence APIs,

44
00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.020
which makes it so
much easier to make this kind of thing.

45
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.970
The app runs on smartphones but
also on the Pivothead smart glasses.

46
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.192
When you're talking to a bigger group,
sometimes you can talk and talk and

47
00:03:21.192 --> 00:03:25.367
there's no response and you think,
is everyone listening really well, or

48
00:03:25.367 --> 00:03:26.720
are they half asleep?

49
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.994
And you never know.

50
00:03:29.994 --> 00:03:31.067
&gt;&gt; I see two faces,

51
00:03:31.067 --> 00:03:36.450
40 year old man with a beard looking
surprised 20 year old woman looking happy.

52
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.844
&gt;&gt; The app can describe the general age
and gender of the people around me and

53
00:03:40.844 --> 00:03:43.810
what their emotions are,
which is incredible.

54
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.770
One of the things that's most useful about
the app is the ability to read our text.

55
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.340
&gt;&gt; Hello, good afternoon,
here's your menu.

56
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.320
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

57
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.972
I can use the app on my phone to
take a picture of the menu and

58
00:03:57.972 --> 00:04:01.960
it's gonna guide me on how
to take that correct photo.

59
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.241
&gt;&gt; Move camera to the bottom right and
away from the document.

60
00:04:05.241 --> 00:04:07.620
&gt;&gt; And then it'll recognize the text.

61
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.920
Read me the headings.

62
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.430
&gt;&gt; I see Appetizers, Salads,
Paninis, Pizzas, Pastas.

63
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.850
&gt;&gt; Years ago, this was science fiction.

64
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.760
I never thought it would be something
that you could actually do.

65
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.124
But artificial intelligence is
improving at an ever faster rate and

66
00:04:23.124 --> 00:04:25.610
I'm really excited to see
where we can take this.

67
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.318
As engineers, we're always standing
on the shoulders of giants,

68
00:04:30.318 --> 00:04:32.380
building on top of what went before.

69
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.153
And in this case,

70
00:04:33.153 --> 00:04:36.720
we've taken years of research from
Microsoft Research to pull this off.

71
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.030
&gt;&gt; I think it's a young girl throwing
an orange frisbee in the park.

72
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.690
&gt;&gt; For me, it's about taking that far off
dream and building it one step at a time.

73
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.002
I think this is just the beginning.

74
00:04:47.002 --> 00:04:49.517
[MUSIC]

75
00:04:49.517 --> 00:04:54.539
&gt;&gt; This is one of the applications
that shows the potential of AR and

76
00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.860
how useful it could be.

77
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.910
And anytime you build something
that is accessible and for

78
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.142
the purpose of accessibility,

79
00:05:03.142 --> 00:05:08.960
you are making your application much
more usable for everybody else.

80
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.860
Interestingly, for example, the typewriter
was invented for a blind person.

81
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.983
And there are all kinds of things
that we have in our life today that

82
00:05:19.983 --> 00:05:25.201
we use daily was created for
making somebody's life much better,

83
00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:28.950
someone who needs
the accessibility feature.

84
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.970
So that's something that I'm very
passionate about, so thank you for asking.

85
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:41.072
There's so much opportunity, but
in terms of tooling, we need a lot.

86
00:05:41.072 --> 00:05:46.689
One of the things as
the community group at W3C,

87
00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:51.347
we want to incubate these kind of ideas,

88
00:05:51.347 --> 00:05:58.069
these kind of resources to make
it much easier for people.

89
00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:02.951
And if you join our group,
you would end up getting the emails for

90
00:06:02.951 --> 00:06:08.287
our meetings and then maybe one day,
we'll just all come together and

91
00:06:08.287 --> 00:06:11.465
build great WebXR accessibility tools.

92
00:06:14.852 --> 00:06:19.812
One of the things that we have here is
a group that that we do is for example,

93
00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:25.950
the examples, Immersive Web Weekly is our
newsletter that we send out every week.

94
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.332
And you can submit your blog posts or

95
00:06:29.332 --> 00:06:35.546
your applications to be part of
the Immersive Web Weekly as well.

96
00:06:35.546 --> 00:06:40.390
And we also have tools
like WebXR input profiles.

97
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:47.463
This is one of the cool things
that we asked the manufacturers

98
00:06:47.463 --> 00:06:52.310
to have the input devices
like the hand controls.

99
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:59.047
And so, depending on your user's device,

100
00:06:59.047 --> 00:07:04.665
you can send some hand
input controller model,

101
00:07:04.665 --> 00:07:10.130
3D model that matches their device.

102
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.214
Patrick here said if you are someone
who is not able to move,

103
00:07:15.214 --> 00:07:20.750
it is really hard to have VR experiences,
which is true.

104
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.227
But at the same time if you give
your user the opportunity to have

105
00:07:25.227 --> 00:07:30.044
the same experience, for example,
standing up, moving around,

106
00:07:30.044 --> 00:07:34.944
plus sitting down and not moving
around and be able to, for example,

107
00:07:34.944 --> 00:07:40.606
transfer from one location to the other
without having to actually move those,

108
00:07:40.606 --> 00:07:44.100
maybe not all, but
some will benefit from that.

109
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.922
And for that, one thing I always
want to say is have as many

110
00:07:48.922 --> 00:07:52.058
options as possible for your users.

111
00:07:52.058 --> 00:07:56.538
For example, with eye tracking,

112
00:07:56.538 --> 00:08:00.399
you can help people to write or

113
00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:04.888
communicate a little bit better.

114
00:08:04.888 --> 00:08:09.722
And instead of having to walk a distance,
you can create movements

115
00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:13.880
with your controllers that
will help them to move along.

116
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:20.480
One other thing that is
possible is with spatial audio.

117
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.708
Saqib here created that app,
Seeing AI, and

118
00:08:25.708 --> 00:08:30.700
it's the most popular app for
visually impaired in US.

119
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.930
And last time I saw him,
he was adding some spatial audio.

120
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:39.279
So with spatial anchors,

121
00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:44.739
you are able to leave kind of
like breadcrumbs along the way.

122
00:08:44.739 --> 00:08:50.186
And people can listen to it and say,
okay, this is coming from this site and

123
00:08:50.186 --> 00:08:54.526
if I follow it, I end up going
to the location that I want to.

124
00:08:54.526 --> 00:08:59.920
And imagine for a person who is not
able to see going into a new building.

125
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.160
Saqib himself moved to
Seattle recently from London.

126
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.977
There's just so much to learn.

127
00:09:05.977 --> 00:09:10.190
And every time you go into a building,
where's the bathroom?

128
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.880
How are you going to figure
it out in a big place?

129
00:09:14.088 --> 00:09:16.682
With little things like that,

130
00:09:16.682 --> 00:09:21.479
we can create a much more
accessible world, hopefully.

131
00:09:23.993 --> 00:09:27.280
But the challenge is we have no text.

132
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:33.750
And we don't know the objects
that are going to be there.

133
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.565
So it's really hard to create
some spec around it to say,

134
00:09:37.565 --> 00:09:40.909
these are the rules that
you're going to follow.

135
00:09:42.952 --> 00:09:49.341
So, [LAUGH] if you're
interested in the subject,

136
00:09:49.341 --> 00:09:54.470
there's also this really great
organisation called XR Access.

137
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.521
They do a lot of research and
they have a lot of resources and

138
00:09:58.521 --> 00:10:00.600
also they are working group.

139
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.401
They come together and work on
different parts of the accessibility.

140
00:10:10.174 --> 00:10:15.585
Any other app ideas that is
inspired from today hopefully?

141
00:10:19.582 --> 00:10:24.022
And please do let me know
through social media or

142
00:10:24.022 --> 00:10:27.463
Twitter, wherever you would like,

143
00:10:27.463 --> 00:10:33.235
what did you think about Babylon
versus Aframe or Three.js,

144
00:10:33.235 --> 00:10:38.350
and what kind of Resources
that you are interested in.

145
00:10:44.015 --> 00:10:44.515
Cool.

146
00:10:47.286 --> 00:10:51.650
It looks like that's end of our questions.

147
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.850
Thank you everyone for your attention.

148
00:10:53.850 --> 00:11:00.230
Here is my Slides, WebXR slides, and
you can find all the repositories and

149
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:05.901
all of the resources that we covered
today, and hope to see you next time.
