00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.120
&gt;&gt; Jen: So first of all,

2
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.590
the number one question I'm getting
about images is the resizing question.

3
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.400
Can we just take an image and just drop it
into our web pages and then use HTML and

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.224
probably tomorrow you'll ask me about CSS.

5
00:00:14.224 --> 00:00:17.880
Can we use something to resize
those images once they're inside of

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.670
the Web page?

7
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.127
Yeah, just because you can doesn't
mean you should, all right?

8
00:00:24.127 --> 00:00:25.990
Tattoo that on your forehead.

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.100
So this is really a bad idea.

10
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.640
The reason why is because when
you have a great big huge picture

11
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.050
that looks great on your desktop
computer with its broadband connection,

12
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.360
you wind up with that same great big huge
honkin' picture of you mobile phone.

13
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.900
And it's going to eat
up your data plan and

14
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.760
it's going to take forever to download.

15
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.310
So it's just really bad form to do that.

16
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.310
It's way better to go ahead and get that
image resized in some way or another.

17
00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.220
And there are approximately five
bajillion different resize and

18
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.750
crop programs for pictures out there.

19
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.350
Some of them are already on your computer
because they came with your computer.

20
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.465
If you actually buy digital
cameras these days,

21
00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:11.105
you may have software
that comes with that.

22
00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:15.015
And if those don't work for you,
I just did a Google up here for

23
00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:19.675
free image resize crop software,
resize meaning actually just changed

24
00:01:19.675 --> 00:01:24.085
the size of the image, crop meaning
actually cut away parts of the image, so

25
00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:27.505
you have a smaller image and
you get rid of some extra stuff.

26
00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:30.560
So if you Google for that,
there'll be a ton of results here.

27
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.340
I haven't tried any of them.

28
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.000
You're welcome to go ahead and
give them a go.

29
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.820
There's other things that will work
just on your Mac, just on your PC.

30
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.010
So feel free to experiment and
find out what works best for you, okay?

31
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.364
But you should always resize that picture
before you put it in the Web page.

32
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.840
The corollary to that question,
how big should the image be?

33
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.175
And the right answer is?

34
00:01:53.175 --> 00:01:54.225
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It depends.

35
00:01:54.225 --> 00:01:55.715
&gt;&gt; Jen: It depends.

36
00:01:55.715 --> 00:02:00.108
[LAUGH] What is it exactly that you're
trying to do with that picture?

37
00:02:00.108 --> 00:02:04.892
So I think the real question
that you're asking with that is,

38
00:02:04.892 --> 00:02:10.607
how big should my picture be or how big
is the average picture on a Web page?

39
00:02:10.607 --> 00:02:15.381
Well, if you go back to that page that
we built earlier with the image from

40
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:20.314
Place Kitten, that picture was 200
pixels wide by 300 pixels tall,

41
00:02:20.314 --> 00:02:24.777
so that should give you a sense of
how big things are in pixels because

42
00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:29.203
you're probably not used to working
in pixels on a website right?

43
00:02:29.203 --> 00:02:31.790
So I'll give you a sense
of like how big that is,

44
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.257
whether you should be a little bigger or
a little smaller than those dimensions for

45
00:02:36.257 --> 00:02:38.734
whatever it is that you're doing, okay?.

46
00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:43.315
Do we have any lingering questions
on images here in the classroom?

47
00:02:43.315 --> 00:02:46.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: If we want to put like
a big image like add at the header,

48
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.657
is that something to do with CSS or?

49
00:02:48.657 --> 00:02:49.282
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yes.

50
00:02:49.282 --> 00:02:49.795
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

51
00:02:49.795 --> 00:02:53.072
&gt;&gt; Jen: You can do that with CSS and
make it a background image so

52
00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:57.059
you can put text on top of it,
if you wanna write something on it, or

53
00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:00.069
you could put it at the top
of your page as an image.

54
00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.342
You won't be able to squish it all the way
up into the edges of the browser yet.

55
00:03:04.342 --> 00:03:06.257
You'll need some CSS to help with that.

56
00:03:06.257 --> 00:03:09.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay, yeah, so depends.
