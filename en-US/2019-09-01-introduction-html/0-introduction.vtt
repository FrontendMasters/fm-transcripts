00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.495
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Hello
everyone around the world.

2
00:00:01.495 --> 00:00:04.860
My name is Jen Kramer and I will be
your instructor for this next week.

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.328
We are gonna be working on HTML and CSS.

4
00:00:09.328 --> 00:00:14.108
Next week starting Monday, we'll be
working on JavaScript with Brian Holt.

5
00:00:14.108 --> 00:00:16.501
So if you are here just for
the JavaScript part of this,

6
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:19.163
you don't need to be here this week,
you can come next week.

7
00:00:19.163 --> 00:00:23.963
However, having said that,
it's great to be here for both weeks.

8
00:00:23.963 --> 00:00:27.671
We're gonna be covering all
kinds of interesting stuff for

9
00:00:27.671 --> 00:00:32.875
HTML CSS in terms of page layouts, making
things pretty making cool kind of forms.

10
00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:36.071
We're going to work on
the right way of doing things.

11
00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:40.204
I know a lot of you have some
background already in HTML, CSS,

12
00:00:40.204 --> 00:00:41.883
maybe even JavaScript.

13
00:00:41.883 --> 00:00:44.838
You've probably worked
on some stuff before.

14
00:00:44.838 --> 00:00:46.152
But at the same time,

15
00:00:46.152 --> 00:00:49.888
you may not necessarily learn
the right way of doing things.

16
00:00:49.888 --> 00:00:52.199
And there is a right way to do this stuff.

17
00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.266
Especially HTML and CSS,
which tend to be ignored by a lot

18
00:00:56.266 --> 00:01:00.775
of the industry is the easy stuff
that it just comes naturally.

19
00:01:00.775 --> 00:01:03.451
You don't have to worry about it,
anybody can write it.

20
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:07.710
All of that is true, but learning how
to do it the right is really critically

21
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.459
important, because it will lead to really
good code, which is gonna get you jobs.

22
00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:13.605
It's gonna make your code efficient.

23
00:01:13.605 --> 00:01:14.799
It's gonna make it streamlined.

24
00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.155
It's gonna make it powerful.

25
00:01:16.155 --> 00:01:18.788
So that is what we're gonna
be working on this week.

26
00:01:18.788 --> 00:01:21.580
And I'm really glad to have you all here.

27
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.334
Some things that you're gonna need for
this class.

28
00:01:23.334 --> 00:01:26.885
Hopefully, you've all logged
into the Slack channels.

29
00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:30.693
So Slack is available,
hopefully you got an invitation for that,

30
00:01:30.693 --> 00:01:33.215
you have logged in, and you're part of it.

31
00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:38.075
Where you should be asking questions
today is on the HTML channel here,

32
00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:43.186
in Slack chat, because that's what
we're gonna be talking about today.

33
00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:46.247
Please use the general
channel that we have here for

34
00:01:46.247 --> 00:01:50.233
any questions that you have about
working with the live stream, or

35
00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:54.456
you wanna introduce yourself or
any other sort of general questions.

36
00:01:54.456 --> 00:01:59.322
But I will be closely monitoring the HTML
portion of this chat looking for

37
00:01:59.322 --> 00:02:02.450
questions on HTML, which is today's topic.

38
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.314
The other thing that you're
gonna need is this website, and

39
00:02:06.314 --> 00:02:08.055
let me once again put this,

40
00:02:08.055 --> 00:02:13.151
I'm gonna put this into the HTML channel
to make sure you're all looking at it.

41
00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:16.238
This is the website for the class,

42
00:02:16.238 --> 00:02:21.464
which is
@frontendmasters.gethub.io/bootstrap.

43
00:02:21.464 --> 00:02:24.375
And this is the website we're
gonna use for the next two weeks.

44
00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:28.900
It's got all the information in it
on HTML, on CSS, on JavaScript and

45
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.905
we're gonna be working
through it every day.

46
00:02:31.905 --> 00:02:35.330
So I'm gonna start here
in the Boot Camp website.

47
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.679
I'm gonna start at the setup and
prerequisites.

48
00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:40.636
So go on ahead and hop on into that.

49
00:02:40.636 --> 00:02:44.518
So first of all, hopefully all of you went
through my internet fundamentals course

50
00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:46.190
before you joined the class today.

51
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.259
If not,
you can find it internetfundamentals.com,

52
00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:51.604
we'll click on the link here from class.

53
00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:56.737
You can look at it after today's lesson,
that is gonna go through some basic steps,

54
00:02:56.737 --> 00:03:00.956
some terminology that we need just
to even start this conversation.

55
00:03:00.956 --> 00:03:04.525
That's gonna be covered in
the Internet Fundamentals course.

56
00:03:04.525 --> 00:03:06.410
And that is completely free, it's online,

57
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.701
you don't even have to register
in order to take that.

58
00:03:08.701 --> 00:03:14.502
Apparently, Internet Fundamentals class
was installing a program called VSCode.

59
00:03:14.502 --> 00:03:18.300
There are approximately five
bazillion code editors out there for

60
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.751
writing different kinds of code, right?

61
00:03:20.751 --> 00:03:25.654
The one we've chosen to use for this
course is called VSCode, and it stands for

62
00:03:25.654 --> 00:03:27.005
visual studio code.

63
00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:31.766
Its from Microsoft and we're not
saying it's the right one, it's not

64
00:03:31.766 --> 00:03:37.180
the perfect one, but it's the one that
a lot of people are using in the industry.

65
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.630
So we thought we'd start you with that,
okay?

66
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.540
So hopefully you already
have that installed.
