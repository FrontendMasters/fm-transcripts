1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.030
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now that we know how
to make paragraphs and headings and

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.070
lists, how about we make a link?

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.420
Whoo, how exciting.

4
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.380
Let's go to another web page, all right?

5
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.346
It's kind of one of the hypertext part
of the Hypertext Markup Language.

6
00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:18.437
Is all about links and being able to take
your web page from one place to another.

7
00:00:18.437 --> 00:00:22.280
So, let's go on ahead and
add some more code then.

8
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.597
So, after your list, let's go on ahead and

9
00:00:27.597 --> 00:00:31.767
let's add another heading here,

10
00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:36.390
this will also be h2, My Fine Links.

11
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.071
And we can say in a paragraph
My favourite website is,

12
00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:47.235
do you have a favourite website?

13
00:00:47.235 --> 00:00:49.092
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Reddit.

14
00:00:49.092 --> 00:00:54.279
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm gonna say Google
cuz it's work safe, easy, simple,

15
00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:59.800
universally admired,
all good reasons to use it in teaching.

16
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.930
So, my favorite website is Google.

17
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.800
And you can use your favorite website,
whatever it happens to be.

18
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.760
What we're going to do around the word
Google, or whatever you have for

19
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.870
the name of your favorite website,
we're gonna start it with an a tag.

20
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.674
A as in anchor, all right, a.

21
00:01:21.674 --> 00:01:28.570
That's followed by href,
as in hypertext reference, href.

22
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.070
So, we just open our tag,
start it with an a href=.

23
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.895
And then inside of the quote marks,
you're gonna need two of them,

24
00:01:38.895 --> 00:01:42.470
we're gonna put in the website address.

25
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.000
And since this website is not on our
current website, it's somewhere else out

26
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.727
there on the Internet, we need to
start it with http://, all of that.

27
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.089
Don't leave out the http://.

28
00:01:58.089 --> 00:02:02.056
Don't leave out any of the letters,
don't leave out any of the slashes.

29
00:02:02.056 --> 00:02:07.031
And then www.google.com,
which is the website.

30
00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:11.963
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
then you can close that.

31
00:02:15.298 --> 00:02:16.690
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: With your angle bracket.

32
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.100
We'll have the word Google, and
then we'll put in a /a, all right?

33
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.335
So, this is the whole link right here, so

34
00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:32.590
a href=http://www.google.com.

35
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.290
if you don't remember your
favorite website's name,

36
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.898
you can always go over
to your web browser.

37
00:02:40.898 --> 00:02:46.100
I'm gonna go to Google, google.com, and

38
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.940
pull up your website,
and you can copy, okay?

39
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.093
Highlight the website address up
there at the top, copy and paste.

40
00:02:59.294 --> 00:03:03.256
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sometimes it
will start with https, okay?

41
00:03:03.256 --> 00:03:08.382
Anyone have an idea of what
the difference is between http and https?

42
00:03:08.382 --> 00:03:09.645
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Dylan: It's the encryption

43
00:03:09.645 --> 00:03:10.349
between the two.

44
00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.210
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's right.

45
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.379
S stands for what?

46
00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:13.040
&gt;&gt; Dylan: Security.

47
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.186
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Secure, okay?

48
00:03:15.186 --> 00:03:19.530
So, if it's just http, it's insecure.

49
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.080
I mean, we can have a long
security discussion about that.

50
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.500
But it's nothing to get
all concerned about.

51
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.635
Or it can be https, like this.

52
00:03:27.635 --> 00:03:31.880
Either one of those is gonna work and
will take you to another website, okay?

53
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.170
So, hopefully, you did that.

54
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.170
Go on ahead and save your web page.

55
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.760
Whoops.

56
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.470
Save your web page and
take a look at it and your web browser.

57
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.847
And then down here you should see
My favorite website is Google,

58
00:03:50.847 --> 00:03:52.863
we'll make everything bigger.

59
00:03:55.325 --> 00:03:57.333
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Way down at the bottom now.

60
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.750
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There we go,
My favorite website is Google.

61
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.840
And if you click it, did it go somewhere?

62
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.543
&gt;&gt; Dylan: Jen, could you maybe stretch
out your screen just to show it all

63
00:04:09.543 --> 00:04:10.110
on one line?

64
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.891
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure.

65
00:04:17.944 --> 00:04:23.355
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So, notice how my a is
inside of my paragraph here, all right?

66
00:04:25.454 --> 00:04:28.290
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Notice how I put
my period outside of the link.

67
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.100
Remember, anything that's inside of
the link becomes whatever is clickable.

68
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.647
Normally the way you look at these links,
it's gonna be blue and underlined, right?

69
00:04:37.647 --> 00:04:40.900
But sometimes it looks purple.

70
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.550
Why does it look purple sometimes and
blue other times?

71
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.670
Dylan knows all the answers.

72
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.235
Does anyone else know any answers?

73
00:04:48.235 --> 00:04:49.910
&gt;&gt; Audience: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, Jenna?

74
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.575
&gt;&gt; Jenna: Is it because you visited it,
because you visited it before?

75
00:04:53.575 --> 00:04:56.420
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Correct,
because you visited it before.

76
00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.452
If it's your favorite website,

77
00:04:58.452 --> 00:05:02.671
it's probably in purple because
you visited it before, all right?

78
00:05:02.671 --> 00:05:05.080
So, if it's purple, that's cool, too.

79
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.810
That just means you've been to
that website sometime before.

80
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.518
Is anyone distressed by the fact that when
you click on the Google link, you get rid

81
00:05:11.518 --> 00:05:16.080
of your fabulous, amazing webpage that
you want everyone to look at forever?

82
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.950
Does anyone wanted this to open
up into a whole new window?

83
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.860
Okay, so there's a way to do that, too.

84
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.054
Right after your link,
put another space, and

85
00:05:27.054 --> 00:05:30.540
we're going to put in
here the following code.

86
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.203
It's target="_blank,

87
00:05:34.203 --> 00:05:39.310
that's where the _blank goes.

88
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.430
Target=_blank, make sure
that this goes in quotes.

89
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:52.090
So, you're starting to see now
another [COUGH] feature here of HTML.

90
00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:00.000
So, we have tags which you've seen these
h2s and the paragraphs and so forth.

91
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.330
And now we have these additional items
that are showing up inside of our tags.

92
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.050
These are called attributes.

93
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.270
So, these are called attributes.

94
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.080
You can think of them as descriptions,
right?

95
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.450
So, it's like the tags are nouns,
they're things, right, and

96
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.970
then these attributes
are descriptions of those things.

97
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:24.340
It would be no good to us if we just had
a link, it just had the a tag, right?

98
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.220
Make it a link.

99
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.782
But where are you going, right?

100
00:06:29.782 --> 00:06:32.880
We need to have an extra description
there to tell us where we're gonna go go.

101
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.340
So, that's what that is.

102
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.180
That's what that href is for.

103
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.580
And then this target_blank
will open it in a new window.

104
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.254
So, if we go ahead and
save that, and refresh one page,

105
00:06:44.254 --> 00:06:50.130
now when you click on Google,
it should open in a whole new tab for you.
