00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
&gt;&gt; off screen: What are the differences
if you're just writing HTML between

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.960
an unordered list and an ordered list?

3
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.755
Cuz obviously you are choosing
the order in this unordered list.

4
00:00:08.755 --> 00:00:12.680
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, and this is
just me trying to think of stuff and

5
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.950
I'm throwing things up there,
one after the other, okay?

6
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.681
But in an ordered list, we're gonna
make a list of how we do something, and

7
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:21.057
the order matters, okay?

8
00:00:21.057 --> 00:00:25.212
So actually why don't you go ahead and
take two minutes.

9
00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:27.361
I'd like you to do the following.

10
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:29.491
I'd like you to add to this page.

11
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:32.749
Now, I'd like you to add
a heading that says,

12
00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:36.606
how to make a peanut butter and
jelly sandwich, okay?

13
00:00:36.606 --> 00:00:39.940
And then I want you to
write an ordered list.

14
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.960
Remember ordered list is an OL, it's gonna
have exactly the same structure as what

15
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.150
we have here for our ordered list,
except it's OL instead of UL.

16
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.480
It's all gonna have all the same li's.

17
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.082
Go ahead and write an ordered list for all
of the steps to make a peanut butter and

18
00:00:57.082 --> 00:00:58.145
jelly sandwich.

19
00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:01.360
The order matters, right?

20
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.530
You can't spread peanut butter
before you get your bread.

21
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.630
Go ahead and try that now.
