WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.930
&gt;&gt; Jen: If we take a look at our
text up here in our web page.

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.700
What do you think
the function of that text is?

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.580
Describe it if you were, yeah?

4
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: An introduction?

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.360
&gt;&gt; Jen: It's kind of an introduction.

6
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.519
And those are two what's?

7
00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Paragraphs.
&gt;&gt; Jen: They are paragraphs, aren't they?

8
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.990
They're paragraphs,
we have a tag for that, okay?

9
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.820
So we need to mark this
up with the right tag.

10
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.580
So we're gonna go ahead and
we're gonna put in the tag and

11
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.360
that tag is called P, okay?

12
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.264
P for paragraph, so the paragraph starts
with the P, in the angle brackets,

13
00:00:37.264 --> 00:00:40.075
those angle brackets are on your keyboard.

14
00:00:40.075 --> 00:00:44.458
In my case they're next to the letter M,
and the question mark down

15
00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:49.250
there on the bottom row, and not to hit
the shift key in order to get them.

16
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.350
So that's paragraph,
and then you close it.

17
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.980
It's called closing a tag with the slash
sign in front of the paragraph

18
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.350
at the end, okay?

19
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.890
So as we put this in, our coded editor is
actually being very nice in helping us.

20
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.960
You see how it gives us
both the opening and

21
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.030
the closing tag together,
right next to each other?

22
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.726
Because, normally the way we'd write
this is we'd actually put in the tag and

23
00:01:14.726 --> 00:01:18.031
then we'd write our text,
in which case this would be nicely placed.

24
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:20.217
But since we already wrote our text,

25
00:01:20.217 --> 00:01:25.390
now what we're gonna need to do is we're
gonna need to move our tags around.

26
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.080
So that they properly go around
our code there, did it work?

27
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.660
Everybody good?

28
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.658
Okay, go ahead and
save your page and refresh.

29
00:01:41.068 --> 00:01:45.930
&gt;&gt; Jen: Now, I just said HTML stands for
the Hypertext Markup Language.

30
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.270
It stands for identifying
elements of our document, right?

31
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.550
So why did my browser put
a space in between here so

32
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.690
it looks like two paragraphs?

33
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.479
Anybody have any idea, yeah?

34
00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.496
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's because we
put separate tags on them?

35
00:02:02.496 --> 00:02:06.765
&gt;&gt; Jen: It's a great idea.

36
00:02:06.765 --> 00:02:09.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen: But no, actually not.

37
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.910
There's nothing in the world that says
the paragraphs should look this way.

38
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.490
That's 16 pixel size times new roman font,
because engineers

39
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.150
picked the ugliest version of fonts
that they can possibly pick, all right?

40
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.690
And it was the engineers who decided
that this is the separation of

41
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.520
the distance between these two lines.

42
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.390
And in fact,

43
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.430
your web browser has a style sheet of its
own, it's your browser's style sheet.

44
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.530
And so the formatting, formatting

45
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.280
that we see here in our web browser is
a figment your browser's imagination.

46
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.300
Okay, the actual HTML itself has no
formatting associated with it, but

47
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.800
this is what your browser thinks
that it should look like.

48
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Is it gonna put that space
only at the bottom of the paragraph or

49
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.850
at the top and the bottom?

50
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.920
&gt;&gt; Jen: It puts the space at the top and
the bottom of the paragraph which is,

51
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.410
we actually have, it's hard to see
here because on the projector, but

52
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.840
maybe on the screen in front of you,
you can see a little bit of space between.

53
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.970
That bar at the top of the page and
the rest of it, that little bit of space,

54
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.585
that's part of the paragraph,
great question, okay.

55
00:03:17.585 --> 00:03:20.793
You've learned your first tag, you've
built your first web page, great job.

56
00:03:20.793 --> 00:03:21.916
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yay.

57
00:03:21.916 --> 00:03:22.536
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yay.

58
00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:24.833
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen: Every page needs a title,

59
00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:25.426
doesn't it?

60
00:03:25.426 --> 00:03:30.206
Okay, so let's go ahead and
put in a title,

61
00:03:30.206 --> 00:03:33.576
and there is a tag for that too.

62
00:03:33.576 --> 00:03:38.400
This is the heading tag and
there are six of these.

63
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.840
The heading tag is h one, okay.

64
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.779
And of course there's h two,
h three, h four, h five, h six, and

65
00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:53.530
we can put up here, All About Me,
because it's always all about me, right?

66
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.880
Save that, refresh that in your browser.

67
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.684
Once again, the absolute
ugliest possible text possible.

68
00:04:05.684 --> 00:04:12.582
It's the way we roll, good.

69
00:04:12.582 --> 00:04:15.390
How about some of the things?

70
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.340
I'm going to make a list.

71
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.309
Okay, so there's couple kinds of lists.

72
00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:32.009
The one we're gonna look at first
is this one, which is ULUL.

73
00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.264
Anyone wanna take a guess
of what that stands for?

74
00:04:34.264 --> 00:04:38.208
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Jen: An ordered list, okay?

75
00:04:38.208 --> 00:04:42.840
In other words, this is a list
of stuff in no particular order.

76
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.770
You could take all of this stuff and you
could throw it up in the air and it comes

77
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.390
down and you pick it up again, and it
doesn't matter what order it's on, right?

78
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.550
It's not like say, a list of directions
and instructions in which case it matters,

79
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.230
what's first, what's second,
what's third, okay.

80
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.980
Anyone want to take a guess
at what that's called?

81
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Ordered list?
&gt;&gt; Jen: An ordered list.

82
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.438
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen: And guess what the tag is called?

83
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:10.530
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yeah, we're really lucky and
it's in English speakers for HTML.

84
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.840
Yeah, we're really lucky.

85
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.898
Okay, so this indicates that
this is going to be a list,

86
00:05:15.898 --> 00:05:18.254
inside of this we're going to have a what?

87
00:05:18.254 --> 00:05:19.912
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A list item?

88
00:05:19.912 --> 00:05:26.060
&gt;&gt; Jen: A list item, L-I, a list item.

89
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.830
Playing music, okay.

90
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.600
So that's one of my hobbies.

91
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.470
And maybe I should actually start
this off with a heading, right?

92
00:05:37.602 --> 00:05:41.181
Anyone wanna take a guess what
heading tag I should use to say?

93
00:05:41.181 --> 00:05:42.758
I'm gonna say something
like my list of hobbies?

94
00:05:42.758 --> 00:05:44.614
What should I use?

95
00:05:44.614 --> 00:05:45.807
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: H two?

96
00:05:45.807 --> 00:05:50.380
&gt;&gt; Jen: H two, yeah,
because I already have h one, right?

97
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.002
This is further down on the page.

98
00:05:52.002 --> 00:05:55.620
H one is the most important thing,
so it's the big one at the top.

99
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.174
There's only one of them,
typically, on a web page.

100
00:05:57.174 --> 00:06:01.528
There are some rules that may
change that a little bit, but for

101
00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:07.490
your purposes there's only one on the page
and we can then go into the next heading.

102
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.910
This is H2.

103
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.520
My fine hobbies.

104
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:19.296
Okay, so now I've got a UL,

105
00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:25.150
and I've got an LI playing

106
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.142
music, hiking,

107
00:06:29.142 --> 00:06:36.580
travel,
&gt;&gt; Jen: Like I said,

108
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.334
it's a very short list.

109
00:06:40.512 --> 00:06:45.439
&gt;&gt; Jen: Teaching, whoops, LI,
&gt;&gt; Jen: Teaching,

110
00:06:51.064 --> 00:06:51.921
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay, and

111
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:58.214
when you refresh the page, you should
see something like this, how's that?
