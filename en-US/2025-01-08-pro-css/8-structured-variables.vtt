1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
All right, now we're gonna talk a bit
about structuring custom properties.

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.105
And this is the part where it's
a bit more design systemy,

3
00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:09.769
cuz there's different types of
custom properties that you can have.

4
00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.139
And this is the one step I
debated including this or not,

5
00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.891
cuz it does take a little bit longer to
get into getting into our project still.

6
00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:22.002
But this is the one phase where I really
feel that idea of customization and

7
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:26.197
adaptability, this is the most important
step you can take along the way.

8
00:00:26.197 --> 00:00:31.905
In the design system world, what we've
created so far, they're called primitives.

9
00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:34.478
Where we have brown 400,
brown 500, brown 600.

10
00:00:34.478 --> 00:00:38.775
You're just saying it's brown, it's
lighter, it's darker, something like that.

11
00:00:38.775 --> 00:00:42.329
The next stage after that, and there's,
I think, three stages in real design

12
00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.315
systems, but we're just going to
be going to the semantic layer.

13
00:00:45.315 --> 00:00:49.617
So instead of having things and a semantic
layer's describing what it's being

14
00:00:49.617 --> 00:00:52.246
used for, and
it can feel setting all of this up,

15
00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:55.864
can feel like it's a lot of work to
be going through and doing this.

16
00:00:55.864 --> 00:00:59.610
But again, in the big picture,
on to make your project a little bit more

17
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.608
maintainable, I really do
feel like it's worth doing,

18
00:01:02.608 --> 00:01:06.292
where you have another set of custom
properties that are all looking at

19
00:01:06.292 --> 00:01:09.063
that original custom
properties that you created.

20
00:01:09.063 --> 00:01:13.710
And as much as possible, when you're using
your custom properties in your project,

21
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.372
you don't wanna use any of your primitives
you only wanna be using the semantic ones.

22
00:01:18.372 --> 00:01:21.306
And we'll sorta explain
explore why that is and

23
00:01:21.306 --> 00:01:23.810
how this makes life a little bit easier.

24
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.160
So this is at the stage where you
literally, if we go back to our you would

25
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.511
go into your Figma file, and
you would look at things.

26
00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:36.162
And so here, if I'm looking at this
design, I see I have this text color here,

27
00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:39.628
I have a white text, and
I have a bit more of a subdued text.

28
00:01:39.628 --> 00:01:43.303
The subdued text tends to be the one
that's being used most often through my

29
00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:46.100
project for paragraph text,
though, it does go back and

30
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.628
forth a little bit between that and
the pure white.

31
00:01:48.628 --> 00:01:52.621
So you could go either way with this, but
what I would do is by looking through this

32
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:56.440
and looking at all the different ways
things are being used, I could then come

33
00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.309
into my code, and this is where the syntax
highlighting breaks a little bit.

34
00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:05.189
If you go after this, which is what
I'd wanna do, if I come here and

35
00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.823
I start doing more custom properties,
so to say, I said text.

36
00:02:09.823 --> 00:02:12.865
And we'll do font size for a sec.

37
00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:13.744
No, we'll do color.

38
00:02:13.744 --> 00:02:17.661
So I can say, like text,
we'll just do regular for now.

39
00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:20.272
And then I would say, that's my var.

40
00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:25.112
And then I would choose,
that would be my brown 800, I think it is.

41
00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:28.320
So I would say that the regular
text should be the brown 800.

42
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.233
You'll notice this is just VS Code
not keeping up with modern CSS yet.

43
00:02:33.233 --> 00:02:36.355
So after the media query,
with nesting, for some reason,

44
00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:38.171
the syntax highlighting breaks.

45
00:02:38.171 --> 00:02:39.932
That bothers me a little bit.

46
00:02:39.932 --> 00:02:43.859
So it's easy enough to come in here and
make another root selector, and then just

47
00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.978
keep on going, and then it doesn't break
anything, it doesn't change anything.

48
00:02:47.978 --> 00:02:52.572
It won't cause any issues
whatsoever in your project.

49
00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:56.584
So you could have text regular, or text
base, anything like that, just to say,

50
00:02:56.584 --> 00:03:00.485
like this is the main text color, text
main, any name like that would be fine.

51
00:03:00.485 --> 00:03:04.641
You're just sorta saying this
is my body even if you wanted,

52
00:03:04.641 --> 00:03:09.295
come in with a name that signifies
to you how it should be being used.

53
00:03:09.295 --> 00:03:12.653
What's the purpose of this rather
than this is the color that it is?

54
00:03:12.653 --> 00:03:17.850
And then we could come and
have a text high contrast and

55
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.441
that one could be my var color white.

56
00:03:21.441 --> 00:03:25.111
So that way, we're, again,
this is high contrast text, and

57
00:03:25.111 --> 00:03:26.652
we're using it that way.

58
00:03:26.652 --> 00:03:29.187
And it's just a question
of going through and

59
00:03:29.187 --> 00:03:33.268
finding all the different ways
the different things will be being used.

60
00:03:33.268 --> 00:03:38.039
The background colors are another one,
and so I could come in with

61
00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:44.141
a background-color, we'll call it main or
bass, or whatever you wanna call it.

62
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:48.533
And in this case, I would look at my Figma
file and I would choose the color that I

63
00:03:48.533 --> 00:03:53.143
feel like is most commonly, probably the
one on my background, sorry on my body.

64
00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:55.417
What would the background
color on my body be?

65
00:03:55.417 --> 00:03:57.774
And when I look at this,
I just see at the top.

66
00:03:57.774 --> 00:03:59.638
I have this brown color coming through.

67
00:03:59.638 --> 00:04:01.586
It's the same brown color here.

68
00:04:01.586 --> 00:04:05.338
Now's are different, but
it's the same one here.

69
00:04:05.338 --> 00:04:10.495
So this color tends to be the one for
me that is the most commonly used one, but

70
00:04:10.495 --> 00:04:15.825
once again, I did give the versions that
I'll be using right there for those.

71
00:04:15.825 --> 00:04:20.316
So my main is the color that is the main
color, the one that I'll set in my body,

72
00:04:20.316 --> 00:04:24.079
and then I have a light and
extra light and a dark and an extra dark.

73
00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:27.842
And just makes it easy when I'm looking at
something I'm not trying to remember is on

74
00:04:27.842 --> 00:04:29.968
that other,
I need a darker background color.

75
00:04:29.968 --> 00:04:32.701
I don't remember if it was a 600 or
a 500 that I used, but

76
00:04:32.701 --> 00:04:34.866
I know I need something darker for
this section.

77
00:04:34.866 --> 00:04:37.013
I probably remember if it's my main or
my light.

78
00:04:37.013 --> 00:04:40.115
It's easier remembering sort of
keywords and numbers necessarily,

79
00:04:40.115 --> 00:04:42.331
especially if you have
these really big systems.

80
00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:47.093
Some of the really big systems you have,
you might have 20 versions of one color,

81
00:04:47.093 --> 00:04:51.123
and knowing which one to use for
a background color can be a nightmare.

82
00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:54.132
So by setting things up like this,
it just makes life a lot easier.

83
00:04:54.132 --> 00:04:57.281
So once again, if you want,
you can grab them all from here and

84
00:04:57.281 --> 00:04:59.109
it's just going through the text.

85
00:04:59.109 --> 00:05:00.753
Brand and brand light, as well.

86
00:05:00.753 --> 00:05:05.623
In that case, for these two, the reason
I chose brand and brand light is, well,

87
00:05:05.623 --> 00:05:09.365
I mean it's sort of describing
what they're being used for.

88
00:05:09.365 --> 00:05:12.644
I think it's actually pretty
straightforward for all of them.

89
00:05:12.644 --> 00:05:17.340
And then I'm doing the same thing for the
headings where we have the heading small,

90
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.918
heading regular, heading large, extra
large, and then the font size is here.

91
00:05:21.918 --> 00:05:23.479
So I'm doing it.

92
00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.600
If it's a font size, then it's just
my body text or paragraph styles.

93
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.516
And if I put heading, it means
it's gonna be used on my headings.

94
00:05:30.516 --> 00:05:34.045
And it just makes my life a little bit
easier than trying to remember the numbers

95
00:05:34.045 --> 00:05:35.607
that I'll be using along the way.

96
00:05:35.607 --> 00:05:39.587
And again, by having these two things as
separate layers, it makes the projects

97
00:05:39.587 --> 00:05:42.703
a lot more easy to make adaptable and
changeable along the way.

98
00:05:42.703 --> 00:05:47.348
The one thing I'll say actually a little
bit of inconsistency here that I had SM,

99
00:05:47.348 --> 00:05:49.682
LG and Excel, but I wrote regular here.

100
00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:53.840
If you'd rather come in with an RG or
just write the full name out, you can.

101
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.526
The other thing people might not like
here is that I'm using really long,

102
00:05:57.526 --> 00:06:00.210
descriptive names cuz people
like less keystrokes.

103
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.580
I like doing it this way,

104
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.515
cuz it separates my primitives from
the ones I'll be using my project.

105
00:06:05.515 --> 00:06:08.514
So I know that if I'm looking for
a font size, hyphen, hyphen,

106
00:06:08.514 --> 00:06:11.862
I write the word font, and then I'll
just see all my font sizes come up.

107
00:06:11.862 --> 00:06:17.051
And so that's the reason that I do it
with the longer version like this,

108
00:06:17.051 --> 00:06:23.036
rather than coming through and, yeah,
I prefer writing things out a bit longer.

109
00:06:23.036 --> 00:06:24.631
It takes a few extra keystrokes to do it,
but

110
00:06:24.631 --> 00:06:26.413
it makes it more clear
what it's being used for.

111
00:06:26.413 --> 00:06:30.145
I hate going into a system and then trying
to remember all the abbreviated versions

112
00:06:30.145 --> 00:06:32.685
of what things are, and
then you go into a new project and

113
00:06:32.685 --> 00:06:34.867
they decided to use
different abbreviations.

114
00:06:34.867 --> 00:06:35.846
It just drives me nuts.

115
00:06:35.846 --> 00:06:40.980
So I'm I'm a big fan of being verbose,
even if it takes a few more keystrokes.

116
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.413
It just makes it more
clear what everything is.

117
00:06:43.413 --> 00:06:48.000
So what I would actually suggest if you
want is to dive in, and if you wanna use

118
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.106
the same ones I'm gonna be using, they are
in the course portal that's right here.

119
00:06:53.106 --> 00:06:55.003
You might find other
things in the Figma file.

120
00:06:55.003 --> 00:06:57.910
There's other things we might have
to add as we're going through or

121
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.489
you might wanna come up with a slightly
different naming convention for yourself.

122
00:07:01.489 --> 00:07:03.810
These names might not be
names that resonate with you.

123
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.929
You might want shorter versions of
the names or other things along the way.

124
00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:09.204
There's the tags that are in there.

125
00:07:09.204 --> 00:07:12.447
You might think about how you'd set those
up cuz they don't have any colors for

126
00:07:12.447 --> 00:07:13.393
those as one example.

127
00:07:13.393 --> 00:07:16.334
So if you wanna poke around in the Figma
file for maybe about five minutes,

128
00:07:16.334 --> 00:07:18.612
come in, you can bring these in,
play around with them,

129
00:07:18.612 --> 00:07:21.221
use them a little bit, just to see
if it makes sense in how they're

130
00:07:21.221 --> 00:07:23.370
working with the current
content we have on the page.

131
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.895
We don't have a lot, but
at least you can experiment and

132
00:07:26.895 --> 00:07:30.195
play with it a little bit,
and then in five minutes,

133
00:07:30.195 --> 00:07:34.095
we'll move on and
start actually using some of these things.

134
00:07:35.604 --> 00:07:38.745
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: I'm just gonna
grab the ones that I had here for

135
00:07:38.745 --> 00:07:42.952
the sake of gravity, and
bring them into the root right here.

136
00:07:42.952 --> 00:07:48.281
Ooh, whoops, let's do that again, copy,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Select

137
00:07:48.281 --> 00:07:51.852
all of them and paste that in.

138
00:07:51.852 --> 00:07:54.806
There we go,
just to overwrite those other ones.

139
00:07:54.806 --> 00:07:58.980
And then this same thing,
I did provide the font sizes here.

140
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:03.010
And we talked with that a bit before,
so I'm just gonna grab those and

141
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:04.688
bring them into my project.

142
00:08:04.688 --> 00:08:08.433
And we wanna still be in
the root right there.

143
00:08:08.433 --> 00:08:13.346
And, again, the nice thing with Prettier
is it takes care of the indentation for

144
00:08:13.346 --> 00:08:14.441
us along the way.

145
00:08:14.441 --> 00:08:17.452
And with that done and
having all the custom properties in there,

146
00:08:17.452 --> 00:08:20.136
it's finally time to start
flying some of these styles and

147
00:08:20.136 --> 00:08:22.670
actually getting our site to
look the way we want it to.

148
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.156
So, I did mention looking around for
other things.

149
00:08:26.156 --> 00:08:29.011
There's one of the things that I
said that I would find useful.

150
00:08:29.011 --> 00:08:32.153
Or I think I would find useful here
would be for border radiuses as well

151
00:08:32.153 --> 00:08:35.467
just cuz there are consistent border
radiuses throughout the project.

152
00:08:35.467 --> 00:08:37.265
Sometimes they're very large,

153
00:08:37.265 --> 00:08:40.997
sometimes they're a bit small
sometimes they're a lot smaller.

154
00:08:40.997 --> 00:08:44.891
And so I came in with these a little
bit on the naming of these again, and

155
00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:47.666
the inconsistencies for
my own way of working is,

156
00:08:47.666 --> 00:08:52.110
I like numbering my border radiuses
instead of saying small, medium, large.

157
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.237
If you prefer small, medium,
large, or anything like that,

158
00:08:55.237 --> 00:08:58.253
by all means, come in with
the names that for you make sense.

159
00:08:58.253 --> 00:09:02.298
It probably makes more sense to use
those just because I've been using that

160
00:09:02.298 --> 00:09:03.075
naming here.

161
00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:05.431
But I'm stuck in my ways because
of how I've always worked.

162
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:10.276
So whenever I do border radius,
I always just think of a number.

163
00:09:10.276 --> 00:09:14.352
So that's why I'm doing it this way, cuz
I'm guessing that question would come up.
