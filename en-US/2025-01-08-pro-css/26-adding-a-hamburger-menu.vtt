1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.645
All right, so one of the things we wanna
do with this project is improve upon our

2
00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:04.651
mobile navigation.

3
00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:10.291
I'm still a fan of these very simple ones
that just work when we go into them.

4
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:15.004
So if you have an intrinsic one
like this that I'll be a fan of it.

5
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:18.887
But a lot of the time the design you
get will have a hamburger menu in it.

6
00:00:18.887 --> 00:00:22.939
So we need to do a little bit of work to
actually make that into an actual thing.

7
00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.904
And so at this stage to do this, because
it's a pretty big feature that we're gonna

8
00:00:26.904 --> 00:00:30.701
be implementing, I would actually suggest
in our source control creating a new

9
00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:33.955
branch instead of just working
directly from the files we have now.

10
00:00:33.955 --> 00:00:35.697
It does mean, if you blow things up,

11
00:00:35.697 --> 00:00:38.464
it's actually easy just to
revert back to where you were.

12
00:00:38.464 --> 00:00:41.347
And it's also a really
common way to work in.

13
00:00:41.347 --> 00:00:44.301
When you're doing an actual job,
you're given this one feature to work on,

14
00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:46.037
you'll make a branch
from the main project.

15
00:00:46.037 --> 00:00:48.756
You sort of work on that one feature,
and then when it's finished,

16
00:00:48.756 --> 00:00:50.344
you pull it back into the main project.

17
00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:53.656
So it's exactly what we're
gonna look at how to do.

18
00:00:53.656 --> 00:00:56.889
Since we're doing it all just with
the VS code options we have here,

19
00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.795
there's a couple of different
ways you can create a branch.

20
00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:04.195
One of them is going just in the menu,
in the source control here,

21
00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:06.919
branch, and you can do a create branch.

22
00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:09.105
Another way you can do it is
all the way at the bottom,

23
00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:12.188
there's a little button that says main
on it, and you can click on that and

24
00:01:12.188 --> 00:01:13.813
you get this new option that comes up.

25
00:01:13.813 --> 00:01:17.306
Or you can do a CTRL+SHIFT+P and
just write branch,

26
00:01:17.306 --> 00:01:20.186
and you'll see a get
create branch pops up.

27
00:01:20.186 --> 00:01:23.211
All of them are giving
you the same options.

28
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:26.941
One thing that's important is you get
a new branch or a new branch from.

29
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:28.536
In this case, we just want a new branch.

30
00:01:28.536 --> 00:01:29.737
We're working off of Main.

31
00:01:29.737 --> 00:01:32.054
If you had a whole bunch of
different branches going on,

32
00:01:32.054 --> 00:01:33.789
you might wanna pinpoint a specific one.

33
00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.219
In this specific case, we don't have any
sub branches or anything to worry about,

34
00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:38.346
nothing too complicated.

35
00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:41.849
So we can just do create new branch, and
it's gonna ask you for what the name is.

36
00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:46.097
I'm just gonna write hamburger menu.

37
00:01:46.097 --> 00:01:48.727
We wanna say what what we're building,
that's what it is.

38
00:01:48.727 --> 00:01:50.928
And then you get a nice
big publish branch button.

39
00:01:50.928 --> 00:01:55.698
So we can click on that, and
we now are working on a new branch.

40
00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:59.061
One thing VS code doesn't make super
obvious is what branch you're working on.

41
00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:01.355
So you do wanna pay attention
down here at the bottom.

42
00:02:01.355 --> 00:02:03.134
As you can see it says hamburger-menu.

43
00:02:03.134 --> 00:02:06.132
And if I click on it, now there's
those two branches that are there,

44
00:02:06.132 --> 00:02:07.642
my hamburger-menu and the main.

45
00:02:07.642 --> 00:02:10.110
So you just wanna pay attention,
don't forget,

46
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.118
you've made a new branch along the way.

47
00:02:12.118 --> 00:02:15.441
So we're gonna focus on this branch,
finish the work we're doing on it,

48
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:17.863
then go back to the main once
everything is done here.

49
00:02:17.863 --> 00:02:21.417
So now that we're in our new branch,
we wanna start updating our navigation.

50
00:02:21.417 --> 00:02:24.201
The first thing we need to think
about is what we have now,

51
00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:27.346
which is just something that looks
similar to what we have here.

52
00:02:27.346 --> 00:02:28.336
This is a simplified version.

53
00:02:28.336 --> 00:02:32.024
We have a wrapper, the site inner and all
of that, but these are the main pieces we

54
00:02:32.024 --> 00:02:35.351
have in there, which we have the logo,
we have our primary navigation.

55
00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:39.563
And we're going to need something
that is able to change that.

56
00:02:39.563 --> 00:02:43.850
We need a button to activate and we need
to be able to hide our navigation and

57
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.104
all of those things.

58
00:02:45.104 --> 00:02:49.955
So to do that, the first thing I'm
gonna suggest is we can come here,

59
00:02:49.955 --> 00:02:53.803
get out of our source control,
go back into our index,

60
00:02:53.803 --> 00:02:56.919
and go find that navigation, right there.

61
00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:01.625
So in between my nav that I have here and,
yeah,

62
00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:05.398
right before my primary navigation.

63
00:03:05.398 --> 00:03:11.606
So in between the image and the nav,
I'm gonna come in with a button.

64
00:03:11.606 --> 00:03:14.669
The thing with the button
is I've given you an image.

65
00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:18.728
So the image is the assets and
the hamburger, and

66
00:03:18.728 --> 00:03:22.195
we could save that, we can go take a look.

67
00:03:22.195 --> 00:03:25.408
We have a button, can't really see
it too well right now because it's

68
00:03:25.408 --> 00:03:28.090
a white hamburger, but
we have the button that's there.

69
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.369
Once again though, I do wanna just mention
that some people are gonna be using

70
00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:34.448
assistive technologies or other things,
and if they come across this,

71
00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:35.976
they don't really know what it is.

72
00:03:35.976 --> 00:03:38.787
They have a button and they have
no context to what this button is.

73
00:03:38.787 --> 00:03:43.553
It will say button to them, the screen
reader will tell them they're on a button.

74
00:03:43.553 --> 00:03:45.895
They'll say there's an image in here,
but it doesn't really do much.

75
00:03:45.895 --> 00:03:48.181
You could give some
context through the alt.

76
00:03:48.181 --> 00:03:52.453
What I see a lot of people do here
is hamburger or hamburger-menu.

77
00:03:52.453 --> 00:03:54.746
That also doesn't really
give much context.

78
00:03:54.746 --> 00:04:00.502
Imagine something's reading to you, and it
says button hamburger, image of hamburger,

79
00:04:00.502 --> 00:04:05.003
or image hamburger, you're gonna
think it's actually a hamburger.

80
00:04:05.003 --> 00:04:07.041
It's kind of useless.

81
00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:11.977
So I would actually suggest leaving this
alt blank, so we're saying that it's just

82
00:04:11.977 --> 00:04:15.672
a decorative piece of text,
or, sorry, a decorative image.

83
00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:18.980
And in that button, we could come in and

84
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.690
do our span with a class
of visually hidden,

85
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.728
which we've already used before, and
in there we can just write menu.

86
00:04:31.706 --> 00:04:34.197
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So
if an assistive technology comes along or

87
00:04:34.197 --> 00:04:37.494
if the hamburger menu fails to
load your CSS fails to load,

88
00:04:37.494 --> 00:04:40.817
your JavaScript probably
won't be working then either.

89
00:04:40.817 --> 00:04:44.400
So you have bigger problems, but we have
some context that's coming in there.

90
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.690
So if I take that class off,
you can see the word menus there.

91
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.263
So it's just this hidden
little piece of text, again,

92
00:04:50.263 --> 00:04:53.077
to give extra context to what
that button is actually doing.

93
00:04:53.077 --> 00:04:54.290
And it's very easy to put that in there.

94
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.293
The other thing that we wanna do is
actually add some context to what this

95
00:04:58.293 --> 00:04:59.835
purpose of this button is.

96
00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:03.419
Cuz right now, if they come across this
button, they know it's a menu, but

97
00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.230
there's no connection to
anything whatsoever right now.

98
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.595
We can connect this with JavaScript,
we're gonna have to do that anyway,

99
00:05:11.595 --> 00:05:15.437
but on this button,
we can also add an area controls.

100
00:05:15.437 --> 00:05:20.582
And on there, we can say that
this controls our primary-nav,

101
00:05:20.582 --> 00:05:25.049
I'm gonna do it shorter than
primary navigation, and

102
00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:27.961
to be able to make that connection,

103
00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:33.130
then I do need to come on the nav and
write ID is equal to primary.

104
00:05:34.456 --> 00:05:37.674
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Nav.

105
00:05:37.674 --> 00:05:39.944
So now,
from an accessibility point of view,

106
00:05:39.944 --> 00:05:42.168
we've connected button to the navigation.

107
00:05:42.168 --> 00:05:45.295
There's one more missing piece of context,
though, is by default,

108
00:05:45.295 --> 00:05:48.422
this is going to be a closed menu,
and then we're gonna be clicking and

109
00:05:48.422 --> 00:05:51.300
it's gonna be opening and
clicking and it's gonna be closing.

110
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.560
And we wannna be able to pass
that information through as well,

111
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.022
because if somebody's
keyboard navigating or

112
00:05:57.022 --> 00:06:01.097
using an assistive technology to read
the site to them and they get to the menu.

113
00:06:01.097 --> 00:06:05.279
If it tells them that it's open or closed
is a really important piece of information

114
00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:08.265
cuz then they know if they hit
if it tells them it's closed,

115
00:06:08.265 --> 00:06:11.509
they know if they hit tab again,
it's gonna go somewhere else.

116
00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:14.665
Whereas if it's open, they know it's going
to bring them inside the navigation and

117
00:06:14.665 --> 00:06:16.938
they're gonna be able to access
the links that are in there.

118
00:06:16.938 --> 00:06:20.539
So a very easy thing to
add while we're in here.

119
00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:25.446
Sorry, on our button,
we have the area controls primary-nav, and

120
00:06:25.446 --> 00:06:29.083
we're gonna do an area
expanded is equal to false,

121
00:06:29.083 --> 00:06:34.098
because by default the navigation
will be closed at smaller screens.

122
00:06:34.098 --> 00:06:37.554
So I'm just gonna put
that on multiple lines.

123
00:06:37.554 --> 00:06:38.827
Prettier might not like that.

124
00:06:38.827 --> 00:06:41.893
A lot of the time when we're doing
accessibility things, the best way to have

125
00:06:41.893 --> 00:06:44.885
good accessibility is just using
the correct semantic code along the way.

126
00:06:44.885 --> 00:06:48.773
So using your headings properly,
using your main, footer, nav,

127
00:06:48.773 --> 00:06:51.104
all of these different types of things.

128
00:06:51.104 --> 00:06:55.811
When it comes to interactive elements,
a lot of the time there are these

129
00:06:55.811 --> 00:07:00.754
extra steps that you do wanna be able to
take to or you will have to take just to

130
00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:05.400
make it accessible when those
interactions are actually happening.

131
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.211
Cuz just having the visual change
on the screen isn't always enough.

132
00:07:09.211 --> 00:07:11.784
It's not always easy to
find this information.

133
00:07:11.784 --> 00:07:16.796
But if you just look up a11y, which is the
short term for accessibility, and then put

134
00:07:16.796 --> 00:07:21.944
in the component you're building, if it's
tabs, if it's a navigation menu, if it's

135
00:07:21.944 --> 00:07:26.636
a carousel and you search for that just
a11y put in the thing you're building.

136
00:07:26.636 --> 00:07:30.121
You'll get a lot of guides that are giving
you best practices on how to build

137
00:07:30.121 --> 00:07:33.294
those and the types of things you'll
have to look out for with area.

138
00:07:33.294 --> 00:07:37.545
Cuz generally no area is the best area,
but with interaction and

139
00:07:37.545 --> 00:07:42.360
other things like that, you'll often
have to add a little bit in there.
