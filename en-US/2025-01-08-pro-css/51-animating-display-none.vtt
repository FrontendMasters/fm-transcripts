00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.010
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Another one of my
absolute favorite new things in CSS,

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.487
which is a perfect
progressive enhancement,

3
00:00:05.487 --> 00:00:08.230
is that we can now animate to and
from display none.

4
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.458
This is something that we've long wanted
and it was just impossible to do or you'd

5
00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:16.502
have to use JavaScript so you'd bring
the element in with an opacity of zero and

6
00:00:16.502 --> 00:00:19.284
then once that was there then
you'd add a class to it.

7
00:00:19.284 --> 00:00:20.269
It wasn't fun.

8
00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.347
And it's actually
relatively easy to do now.

9
00:00:23.347 --> 00:00:27.970
So the best case in this project, or the
best thing I think, to work on for that,

10
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.834
is with our mobile navigation.

11
00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:35.459
Because if we take a look at our
mobile navigation, it goes in and out.

12
00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:38.806
Works it's fine but a lot of the time
we have animations on these.

13
00:00:38.806 --> 00:00:40.600
They slide in, they slide down.

14
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.408
They fade in.

15
00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:42.732
There's different things
we can do with it.

16
00:00:42.732 --> 00:00:44.579
So we'll start with a fading animation,
but

17
00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.668
then we'll see how we can
step it up from there, and

18
00:00:46.668 --> 00:00:49.895
you can play around with it a little bit
and come up with some really fun things.

19
00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:52.387
So for this would be in our components.

20
00:00:52.387 --> 00:00:56.069
The stuff for
our primary navigation is here right now.

21
00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:58.186
And so this is my primary nav.

22
00:00:58.186 --> 00:00:59.441
No, that's not the primary nav.

23
00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:01.641
The primary navigation is right here.

24
00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:04.048
We only need to do this
within our media query,

25
00:01:04.048 --> 00:01:06.225
cuz this is where we're playing with it.

26
00:01:06.225 --> 00:01:09.817
So I'm gonna stick within this
media query that's here right now.

27
00:01:09.817 --> 00:01:10.744
I do apologize.

28
00:01:10.744 --> 00:01:15.923
This is like a placeholder for nothing.

29
00:01:15.923 --> 00:01:18.488
But I think it didn't work.

30
00:01:18.488 --> 00:01:23.270
Sometimes when you have something extra in
there, it fixes the syntax highlighting.

31
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.865
Let me just try again, li.

32
00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.028
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: It doesn't like
that there's no selector there.

33
00:01:32.028 --> 00:01:35.005
So I might do this just to fix
the syntax highlighting so

34
00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:36.636
it looks a little bit better.

35
00:01:36.636 --> 00:01:40.722
It might break some stuff along the way,
but we'll see what happens.

36
00:01:40.722 --> 00:01:41.754
Does it still work?

37
00:01:41.754 --> 00:01:44.539
Okay, so don't necessarily
repeat this in your own code.

38
00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.517
I'm just doing it so the syntax
highlighting looks a little nicer.

39
00:01:48.517 --> 00:01:50.624
So we have our display none,
that's perfect.

40
00:01:50.624 --> 00:01:56.050
And then we're going from the display
none to this display block right here,

41
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.314
display block when it comes in.

42
00:01:58.314 --> 00:02:03.575
The problem right now is if I came up on
here and maybe wanted to fade in, so not

43
00:02:03.575 --> 00:02:09.267
only is it gonna be a display: none, but
I'm going to put an opacity of 0 on here.

44
00:02:09.267 --> 00:02:12.490
And then I'm gonna come all
the way down for when it comes in.

45
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.276
And I want this to have an opacity of 1.

46
00:02:18.276 --> 00:02:20.963
Nothing, that's fine,
not expecting any difference.

47
00:02:20.963 --> 00:02:23.132
We can come back up here.

48
00:02:23.132 --> 00:02:24.341
I forgot that as well.

49
00:02:24.341 --> 00:02:25.892
That wouldn't have changed anything,
though.

50
00:02:25.892 --> 00:02:29.507
And then I can go transition opacity.

51
00:02:29.507 --> 00:02:30.905
Let's just say one second.

52
00:02:30.905 --> 00:02:35.165
It's way too slow, but let's say we did
that, and you'd expect it to transition,

53
00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:36.068
but it doesn't.

54
00:02:36.068 --> 00:02:40.754
The reason CSS doesn't transition in
this case is because display property is

55
00:02:40.754 --> 00:02:45.095
technically animatable, but
it's considered a discrete animation.

56
00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:48.863
And a discrete animation is something
that CSS can't really animate,

57
00:02:48.863 --> 00:02:52.066
because what's in between display none and
display block,

58
00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:55.288
there's nothing that makes
sense within those that range.

59
00:02:55.288 --> 00:02:57.658
If you did it within
a keyframes animation,

60
00:02:57.658 --> 00:03:01.319
what it would do is halfway between
the two keyframes you've done.

61
00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.527
It's gonna switch from one to the other.

62
00:03:03.527 --> 00:03:04.998
So that's the discrete animation.

63
00:03:04.998 --> 00:03:07.193
It's letting the animation happen, but

64
00:03:07.193 --> 00:03:11.269
it's just flipping a switch if you're
trying to transition something, and

65
00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.845
that item that you're transitioning
has something that involve,

66
00:03:14.845 --> 00:03:19.194
is involved in a discretionary animation,
or has is a discretionary animation.

67
00:03:19.194 --> 00:03:21.343
Your transition just won't work at all.

68
00:03:21.343 --> 00:03:24.709
This was the traditional problem
that we've had up until now.

69
00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.805
But luckily, we can actually come here and

70
00:03:27.805 --> 00:03:32.029
now say we're also gonna
transition display one second.

71
00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:34.592
I wish we only had to do that.

72
00:03:34.592 --> 00:03:36.090
It's still not gonna work.

73
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.139
But we only have one other thing.

74
00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.364
I'm gonna take a new line.

75
00:03:39.364 --> 00:03:43.316
This is the new thing we can
do transition,-behavior, and

76
00:03:43.316 --> 00:03:45.494
it's called allow-discrete.

77
00:03:45.494 --> 00:03:49.634
So anything that would have a discrete
animation, it's saying, you know what?

78
00:03:49.634 --> 00:03:50.815
We know that it's there.

79
00:03:50.815 --> 00:03:55.200
We're gonna allow it, and it's opt in,
or they've done this as an opt in, and

80
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.585
the reason they're doing it as an opt in
type of thing is just because there could

81
00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:02.679
be old websites that things
were set up in a certain way.

82
00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:05.662
And because of the way it worked,
everything was fine.

83
00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.758
And if they change the default behavior,
some animations or

84
00:04:08.758 --> 00:04:10.649
weird stuff might start happening.

85
00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:13.399
So instead of changing
the default behavior,

86
00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:15.592
they're giving us a one line opt in.

87
00:04:15.592 --> 00:04:18.065
And it sort of works because
you can see it fades out.

88
00:04:18.065 --> 00:04:22.141
Doesn't fade in but
it fades out halfway there, pretty good.

89
00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:25.942
It's already exciting that we
can do that in one direction.

90
00:04:25.942 --> 00:04:29.412
What it's basically doing at this stage
is when it goes from let's open it,

91
00:04:29.412 --> 00:04:31.159
because it's easier to understand.

92
00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:34.164
When we're here, we have display block,
we have opacity of 1 and

93
00:04:34.164 --> 00:04:37.116
I'm saying I want to transition
the opacity over one second, and

94
00:04:37.116 --> 00:04:39.387
I want to transition
the display over one second.

95
00:04:39.387 --> 00:04:41.656
Display doesn't really transition, though.

96
00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:44.962
So what it's doing is it's transitioning
the opacity for one second.

97
00:04:44.962 --> 00:04:48.597
And when that one second is finished, it's
instantly changing the display block just

98
00:04:48.597 --> 00:04:50.750
to get rid of it, and
it goes to the display: none.

99
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.518
So that's why when we go this way,
it works without any problems.

100
00:04:54.518 --> 00:04:57.603
When we're coming the other
way on the animation, though,

101
00:04:57.603 --> 00:05:01.780
that type of thing can't work because we
have to instantly change to display block

102
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.009
at the very beginning.

103
00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:08.257
And as soon as it gets display block
on it, it's rendering that on the page,

104
00:05:08.257 --> 00:05:12.120
and it's instantly jumping
to the styles we have here.

105
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.675
Because these are both true.

106
00:05:13.675 --> 00:05:17.948
It never had that opacity of zero, because
it's sort of that style never existed on

107
00:05:17.948 --> 00:05:19.975
that element cuz it was a display none.

108
00:05:19.975 --> 00:05:21.665
It didn't exist on the page.

109
00:05:21.665 --> 00:05:25.368
It's this weird sort of conundrum
type thing that we've run into.

110
00:05:25.368 --> 00:05:31.242
So to help with that, we have another
new property called @starting.style.

111
00:05:31.242 --> 00:05:35.632
So it's another at property VS code still
doesn't recognize it, but it works.

112
00:05:35.632 --> 00:05:38.255
And here you just put your
starting styles on there.

113
00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:42.071
So my starting style is
actually an opacity of 0.

114
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:47.247
And so now it will fade out and
it will fade in, because when it instantly

115
00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:52.103
switches that display to block,
it's going okay, it's block.

116
00:05:52.103 --> 00:05:56.727
But now I'm gonna start with an opacity of
0 instead of instantly just coming up to

117
00:05:56.727 --> 00:05:58.212
the styles that are here.

118
00:05:58.212 --> 00:06:02.838
There's one kind of strange thing I find
with this entire thing is just wrapping

119
00:06:02.838 --> 00:06:06.164
your mind around the order that
you have to put things in.

120
00:06:06.164 --> 00:06:11.109
You generally have your closed state or
your exit state first,

121
00:06:11.109 --> 00:06:14.665
then you have your
finished entrance state.

122
00:06:14.665 --> 00:06:18.573
And then you have this like
transition in from state at the end,

123
00:06:18.573 --> 00:06:22.996
if you bring this up here, it won't
work and not just 'cause the syntax

124
00:06:22.996 --> 00:06:27.749
highlighting is broken, so when I open it,
it's just opening instantly.

125
00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:31.166
The reason this is happening is
the same reason that if you have,

126
00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:33.781
it's just the order CSS
goes from top to bottom.

127
00:06:33.781 --> 00:06:37.741
So it sees the opacity 0 as a starting
style, but then it sees the opacity 1 and

128
00:06:37.741 --> 00:06:39.181
it just gets the opacity 1.

129
00:06:39.181 --> 00:06:43.256
This is the same as if you did a media
query first, like we could do it here.

130
00:06:43.256 --> 00:06:46.866
Let's just say the, I don't know.

131
00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:50.677
We'll say site,
we'll do primary navigation.

132
00:06:50.677 --> 00:06:54.216
Primary, navigation, background, red,

133
00:06:54.216 --> 00:06:58.787
important, just to make sure
it actually comes through.

134
00:06:58.787 --> 00:07:03.858
And then if I put a media query
underneath this at media width

135
00:07:03.858 --> 00:07:09.352
is bigger than 200 pixels, so
we know that it's gonna work.

136
00:07:09.352 --> 00:07:13.470
Background, green, important, and

137
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.338
I probably should have nested that,

138
00:07:17.338 --> 00:07:21.472
or we'll just do .primarynavigation

139
00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:31.490
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: That we're getting
the green because it does this.

140
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.741
Then it goes, okay,
this media query is overwriting it.

141
00:07:34.741 --> 00:07:39.800
But if I brought this media query here and
I bring it above that, it's gonna become

142
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.516
red, because this is if the width is
greater than 200 but this is always.

143
00:07:44.516 --> 00:07:47.748
So then the red wins over the media
query that we have there.

144
00:07:47.748 --> 00:07:49.952
So it's the same thing
with your starting style.

145
00:07:49.952 --> 00:07:52.997
The starting style gets disclaimed first,
then it sees opacity one,

146
00:07:52.997 --> 00:07:56.469
it just assumes that's the always style
for everything, and it doesn't win.

147
00:07:56.469 --> 00:08:00.174
So your starting style,
despite it being the starting thing.

148
00:08:00.174 --> 00:08:03.064
Does have to be the last
thing that's declared,

149
00:08:03.064 --> 00:08:07.373
which it takes a little bit of getting
used to, but it's just what it is.

150
00:08:12.247 --> 00:08:14.989
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Now,
there is one really nice advantage, and

151
00:08:14.989 --> 00:08:19.556
it feels a little bit weird, in a sense,
that you have an opacity 0 here, and

152
00:08:19.556 --> 00:08:23.098
the opacity 0 here, and
you need to have it in both places.

153
00:08:23.098 --> 00:08:25.779
But there's an advantage of
having this starting style and

154
00:08:25.779 --> 00:08:28.902
that we actually need it even if it
feels a little bit clunky at times.

155
00:08:28.902 --> 00:08:32.284
And the reason that that has
an advantage to it is because it

156
00:08:32.284 --> 00:08:37.196
actually enables a different entrance and
exit animation if that's what you want.

157
00:08:37.196 --> 00:08:40.369
Because this is,
let's do a quick one here.

158
00:08:40.369 --> 00:08:47.224
We're doing our opacity, our display,
and let's add a third one to our list,

159
00:08:47.224 --> 00:08:51.539
where I'm also gonna do
a translate of 1 second.

160
00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:56.234
While I'm here, just really fast,
the transition behavior allow-discrete,

161
00:08:56.234 --> 00:08:57.398
I'm doing it here.

162
00:08:57.398 --> 00:08:59.945
It could be included in
the transition shorthand.

163
00:08:59.945 --> 00:09:03.490
I just find it easier to do my transitions
and add that here, because then I know

164
00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:07.005
it's gonna get applied to everything,
and I don't have to stress about it.

165
00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:09.299
So yeah, that's just why I have
it as a separate property.

166
00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:12.323
It is included as part of
the shorthand if you want it, but

167
00:09:12.323 --> 00:09:14.471
I'm gonna do my translate right there.

168
00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:16.245
And this is when it's closed.

169
00:09:16.245 --> 00:09:18.448
So when my menu is closed,
let's move it up.

170
00:09:18.448 --> 00:09:23.157
So to move it up would be a translate
of I'm gonna get it wrong 01,

171
00:09:23.157 --> 00:09:26.956
100% it's probably gonna
go to the wrong place.

172
00:09:26.956 --> 00:09:30.480
Yes, it did -100 and it will go up.

173
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.388
So now, when I open it, we need it.

174
00:09:35.388 --> 00:09:40.768
When we open it, we need it to slide down,
so I can come here and

175
00:09:40.768 --> 00:09:47.405
I can say the translate is a 00, so
it will slide up and then it will appear.

176
00:09:47.405 --> 00:09:48.441
That's kind of interesting, right?

177
00:09:48.441 --> 00:09:52.376
It's already two separate animations,
and that's because our starting style,

178
00:09:52.376 --> 00:09:54.071
the only thing on it is the opacity.

179
00:09:54.071 --> 00:09:58.981
So I can have it slide up when it leaves,
but when it enters,

180
00:09:58.981 --> 00:10:03.906
maybe I'm gonna do a translate of 100% and
0 this way.

181
00:10:03.906 --> 00:10:07.585
So if I do that, when it enters,
it's actually entering from the side.

182
00:10:07.585 --> 00:10:11.034
And when it leaves, it slides at the top.

183
00:10:11.034 --> 00:10:13.457
I actually prefer it the other way around.

184
00:10:13.457 --> 00:10:18.594
So I think I'll do a 0-100 here,
and then all the way

185
00:10:18.594 --> 00:10:23.623
up here we can do this whoops
we can do this as the 100,

186
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:29.630
0 and I just remembered looking at
that this should be a negative.

187
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:34.112
And I think I did that wrong we'll find
out slides out slides down there we

188
00:10:34.112 --> 00:10:36.843
go slides that way and
then slides that way.

189
00:10:36.843 --> 00:10:40.459
Something fun you can definitely do lots
of really fun, cool stuff with this with

190
00:10:40.459 --> 00:10:43.559
different entrance, exit animations,
not just for navigations.

191
00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:46.512
It could be for if you have cards
that you click and it adds,

192
00:10:46.512 --> 00:10:49.238
like a to do list item,
you can have it transition in.

193
00:10:49.238 --> 00:10:53.441
And then when you close that or
finish that to do list item, it leaves in

194
00:10:53.441 --> 00:10:58.023
a different direction or has a different
animation on it, all really easily
