00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.601
If we take a look at our page now,
it's mostly coming together.

2
00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:04.699
Everything is actually
looking pretty good.

3
00:00:04.699 --> 00:00:05.725
It's following the layout.

4
00:00:05.725 --> 00:00:08.477
I think I chose the wrong font size here
because they're a little bit big, so

5
00:00:08.477 --> 00:00:09.595
we'll tweak that in a minute.

6
00:00:09.595 --> 00:00:12.383
But other than that, things
are coming together pretty nicely and

7
00:00:12.383 --> 00:00:13.342
matching the design.

8
00:00:13.342 --> 00:00:15.681
Other than we have the footer and
the buttons, so

9
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.345
we'll tackle the buttons first.

10
00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:19.197
There's nothing complicated with these.

11
00:00:19.197 --> 00:00:21.832
This is a situation where I'm gonna do it.

12
00:00:21.832 --> 00:00:23.602
We only have one style of button, so

13
00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:26.144
I'm gonna make the button
the way I need it to look.

14
00:00:26.144 --> 00:00:29.867
You could potentially use a lot of the
same approach that we did with our card to

15
00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:31.308
make things more adaptable.

16
00:00:31.308 --> 00:00:34.782
This would make a lot of sense if
you had lots of different buttons or

17
00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:37.837
coming in with different
modifier classes for it as well.

18
00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:41.509
But it's one of those things where I sort
of build it to work with what I need just

19
00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:44.973
with the eye on in the future, maybe
I'll need to tweak this a little bit.

20
00:00:44.973 --> 00:00:48.820
But yeah, we can just come in with
the buttons, how we need them to look.

21
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.478
There's nothing too complicated with them.

22
00:00:51.478 --> 00:00:55.013
One thing with the button,
I'm still in my components layer.

23
00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:58.887
We'd already put the button class on them,
if I find it.

24
00:00:58.887 --> 00:01:02.254
I already put the class of button
on there from the beginning.

25
00:01:02.254 --> 00:01:06.517
So, on that, one thing that I usually
do is a display of inline flex.

26
00:01:06.517 --> 00:01:09.024
In this case,
an inline block would work as well.

27
00:01:09.024 --> 00:01:11.543
Either one of them would
be completely fine.

28
00:01:11.543 --> 00:01:13.820
You can also do inline flex like that or
like that.

29
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.861
They both work.

30
00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:18.656
The reason for
that is inline is the outer version of it.

31
00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:22.149
The flex is the inner version of it,
will do this, but yeah,

32
00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.077
we now have a two syntax display.

33
00:01:24.077 --> 00:01:26.857
So you can declare the outer and
inner as two separate values.

34
00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:30.997
I just do that in this case, we don't have
any icons or other things, it's just text,

35
00:01:30.997 --> 00:01:34.627
but it's one of those things that if ever
you had a button that needs an icon,

36
00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:36.700
it's nice that it's already a flex item.

37
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.287
You could probably just do a display
flex 2, but I tend to do in-line flex,

38
00:01:41.287 --> 00:01:42.590
then nothing fancy.

39
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.165
We need a little bit of padding
which we're gonna do last, actually,

40
00:01:45.165 --> 00:01:46.399
I'm gonna take the padding off.

41
00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.537
But you will need a bit of padding or
we'll put it on there.

42
00:01:49.537 --> 00:01:53.957
But we'll have to adjust that
once we're looking at it,

43
00:01:53.957 --> 00:01:59.940
a background color which is the accent,
I think it's the main accent color,

44
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.639
we have the font families
actually different.

45
00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:11.021
The font family looking at it, it's the
font family of the font family heading.

46
00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:12.802
The font weights, looks like it's bold.

47
00:02:12.802 --> 00:02:14.789
I didn't create any customer
properties for the weights.

48
00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:18.168
If you have lots of weights
it can be useful, but

49
00:02:18.168 --> 00:02:21.971
in this project we decided to bold and
the regular, so

50
00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:26.969
it's easy enough just to declare
the one you need, where you need it.

51
00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:31.675
Let's go take a look to see if I,
one more thing, text decoration of none.

52
00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:36.857
And another thing that I tend
to do on all of my buttons,

53
00:02:36.857 --> 00:02:42.395
even though I don't need to
right now is a cursor pointer.

54
00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:43.435
It's a button class.

55
00:02:43.435 --> 00:02:46.809
It might get put on a button element or
on a link like we're doing now.

56
00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:50.891
There's already people who don't like
links that look like buttons, and

57
00:02:50.891 --> 00:02:54.779
there's people who don't like having
cursors on buttons either, but

58
00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:59.221
it just gives us the little hand pointer
regardless of what we're putting it on.

59
00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:02.356
So I'll always like having
the hand icon there.

60
00:03:02.356 --> 00:03:04.704
If you have opinions on that, that's fine.

61
00:03:04.704 --> 00:03:06.843
I'm gonna put it.

62
00:03:06.843 --> 00:03:10.943
Looking at it now,
I see I need a border radius.

63
00:03:10.943 --> 00:03:15.578
So border radius 2, I'm guessing.

64
00:03:15.578 --> 00:03:18.321
That looks pretty good and
looks like it matches it.

65
00:03:18.321 --> 00:03:21.818
The font size, I think,
right now the font size is inheriting, so

66
00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:25.453
it's kind of large, it's matching
this big font size we have here.

67
00:03:25.453 --> 00:03:32.166
So I'm actually going to declare
a font size on it as well,

68
00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:36.961
of a font size, probably the medium one.

69
00:03:36.961 --> 00:03:37.820
It's a little bit smaller.

70
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.746
And again, if we look at the Figma file,

71
00:03:40.746 --> 00:03:45.061
you'd be able to get the font
size that's being used on it.

72
00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:46.879
But I know just looking at it here,

73
00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.155
the font size is definitely
smaller than the paragraph here.

74
00:03:50.155 --> 00:03:53.505
This one's a large so
I'm just dropping down one to the medium.

75
00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:56.165
This could potentially be
something you have a modifier for

76
00:03:56.165 --> 00:03:58.889
where different buttons have
different font sizes on them.

77
00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.367
But in this case, we don't need that.

78
00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:02.920
So I think we can leave it just like that.

79
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.470
And then I wanna bring in the hover state,
just because I don't really like the text

80
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.943
just changing,
it looks weird for a button.

81
00:04:09.943 --> 00:04:16.268
You could use nesting here, but
I'm just gonna do button hover,

82
00:04:16.268 --> 00:04:20.995
button focus visible,
just like we did before.

83
00:04:20.995 --> 00:04:25.376
And on that the color can stay the same.

84
00:04:25.376 --> 00:04:29.194
So that was our high contrast.

85
00:04:29.194 --> 00:04:34.084
And then the background
can just get a bit later,

86
00:04:34.084 --> 00:04:38.025
background color, can be the accent.

87
00:04:38.025 --> 00:04:41.459
Green is accent and that should,

88
00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:46.619
let's just move this over so
you can see all of it.

89
00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.121
And there we go.

90
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.419
It's a nice, simple one.

91
00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:50.038
There's nothing fancy.

92
00:04:50.038 --> 00:04:54.767
This could be definitely something you add
some transitions to do something fancier

93
00:04:54.767 --> 00:04:59.162
with, but at least we can see it's being
highlighted, and if you tab over to it

94
00:04:59.162 --> 00:05:02.707
through keyboard navigation it
works perfectly fine as well.

95
00:05:02.707 --> 00:05:06.091
So nothing too fancy with our button, but
at least it's looking a little bit better,

96
00:05:06.091 --> 00:05:07.421
works in both cases right there.

97
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:09.439
So I think that's pretty good to go.
