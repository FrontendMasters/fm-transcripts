00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.022
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So instead of having this
here, we're gonna keep that there for

2
00:00:04.022 --> 00:00:07.533
a minute, we'll delete this
one cuz we don't need it.

3
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:11.933
Get rid of the console.log, and what we'll
do instead is, let's create a function.

4
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:15.721
So we're gonna say function, and
we'll call it updateFilter, and

5
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:19.769
we'll have the (e) right there,
cuz we want that effect to go through,

6
00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.817
here I was using the arrow function.

7
00:00:21.817 --> 00:00:26.783
If I'm creating a new function somewhere
else that's not just being used in

8
00:00:26.783 --> 00:00:29.962
a callback there,
I find just giving it a name and

9
00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:32.467
declaring it this way is a lot easier.

10
00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:35.078
I don't know, it's just the way I work.

11
00:00:35.078 --> 00:00:40.636
So we're gonna put that there and
then have our const

12
00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:45.822
filterType = e.target., actually target.

13
00:00:45.822 --> 00:00:48.656
We don't have a target, all right,
let's see what we have actually e.target.

14
00:00:48.656 --> 00:00:54.266
And let's do a console.log(e.target) to
see if there's something we can use or

15
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.086
if we need to make a change.

16
00:00:56.086 --> 00:01:00.909
So we have the updateFilter, what I'm
gonna do here, is every time that we

17
00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.752
change here, instead of having this
whole function here, what we can do.

18
00:01:05.752 --> 00:01:08.907
I mean, we can do this for
both of them now,

19
00:01:08.907 --> 00:01:12.511
is we can just do our
updateFilter as a callback.

20
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:16.860
And now, I can copy that and
paste that and do the seasonalFilter, and

21
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.454
I can also do this for my editableFilter.

22
00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:22.014
So we add the event listener
to both of them, but

23
00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:25.350
both of them are gonna use the same
filter to be able to change.

24
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.195
So if I go to my Spring, we can get
the id there, if I change this one,

25
00:01:30.195 --> 00:01:33.950
you can see my id is coming
right there with that one.

26
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.951
And if we go through edible spring,
summer cuz I didn't change.

27
00:01:38.951 --> 00:01:41.057
So we're getting the season,
coming up there.

28
00:01:41.057 --> 00:01:44.027
One thing I didn't give these
selects was a name, and

29
00:01:44.027 --> 00:01:46.073
I was planning on giving them names.

30
00:01:46.073 --> 00:01:51.491
So I'm gonna go and do that now, we
could actually grab the id as well, that

31
00:01:51.491 --> 00:01:57.429
would work but it's easy to come in here
and give this a name="season" as well.

32
00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:03.819
And I'm gonna come on the select and give
this a name is equal to edible, like that.

33
00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:09.038
And the advantage of having
the name on there is it's

34
00:02:09.038 --> 00:02:16.285
just really easy to get to cuz we can
.name and then season and my edible.

35
00:02:16.285 --> 00:02:19.526
So that's the one that's
coming through and

36
00:02:19.526 --> 00:02:23.874
either the filterType here is
either my season or my edible or

37
00:02:23.874 --> 00:02:29.853
getting the one that we wanna be using in
either one of those different situations.

38
00:02:29.853 --> 00:02:33.685
And now we can just be a little bit
more creative or not creative but

39
00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:36.340
a little smarter in how
we're doing things.

40
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.200
So instead of console logging that,
we wanna be able to change

41
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.857
the current filter based on
this filterType that we have.

42
00:02:43.857 --> 00:02:47.174
Do we have the seasonFilter or
do we have the edibleFilter?

43
00:02:47.174 --> 00:02:49.972
So for
this we're gonna do our currentFilters and

44
00:02:49.972 --> 00:02:52.444
we have to do things
a little bit different.

45
00:02:52.444 --> 00:02:55.422
Up until now I've always been
using the dot notation so

46
00:02:55.422 --> 00:02:58.023
that would be like the season
that I did before.

47
00:02:58.023 --> 00:03:02.010
The dot notation won't work in this
situation because of how I'm using it.

48
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.787
The dot notation would work with
the exact word of season or

49
00:03:05.787 --> 00:03:09.731
the exact word of edible, but
I don't have that exact word.

50
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:12.174
I have a variable of filterType instead.

51
00:03:12.174 --> 00:03:16.929
So because I'm using a variable,
it just means instead of the dot notation,

52
00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:19.942
we do have to use the brackets
like this instead.

53
00:03:19.942 --> 00:03:24.661
So filterType right there is

54
00:03:24.661 --> 00:03:29.778
equal to the e.target value.

55
00:03:29.778 --> 00:03:34.712
So, remember the value is the filterType,
so we're getting here,

56
00:03:34.712 --> 00:03:38.551
this should be .name,
I took it off for some reason.

57
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:42.929
The name is either season or edible,
and then the value that we're getting

58
00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:46.144
from that is the actual value
of what we've selected.

59
00:03:46.144 --> 00:03:49.230
So we're gonna update
the currentFilters[filterType], so

60
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.543
that's either we're updating either
the season or the edible, and

61
00:03:52.543 --> 00:03:55.526
we're gonna update it to
the value that's being used there.

62
00:03:55.526 --> 00:04:00.919
So if we save that, and we'll do
a console.log, so we can see it in action.

63
00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:05.925
Of our currentFilters, when I come here
and I change it to Spring, spring and

64
00:04:05.925 --> 00:04:10.787
all, if I come here and I do Edible,
we're getting spring and the edible.

65
00:04:10.787 --> 00:04:12.505
Edible I change it to Toxic,

66
00:04:12.505 --> 00:04:16.022
we can see we're getting
the toxic coming in right there.

67
00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:19.248
So it keeps track of both of them, and

68
00:04:19.248 --> 00:04:24.985
we're using one function to be
able to update both of them there.
