1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.272
All right, next up we're gonna look at
the landmark regions, which are things

2
00:00:04.272 --> 00:00:08.241
like our nav or header, footer,
article, section, aside, and so on.

3
00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:12.496
I think on this page, or no, I probably
did it earlier on where I linked to, no,

4
00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:16.235
right here, this link right here does
give you a bit more information.

5
00:00:16.235 --> 00:00:20.525
It's from the w3.org, just on what
being a landmark region even means, but

6
00:00:20.525 --> 00:00:25.012
they do help with assistive technologies,
where people can navigate directly to

7
00:00:25.012 --> 00:00:29.454
different landmark regions on a site, so
they can get through them a bit faster.

8
00:00:29.454 --> 00:00:33.480
Other than sections where I mentioned a
bit earlier that you have to do a bit more

9
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.652
work to get that to work,
the one thing where I already did it,

10
00:00:36.652 --> 00:00:40.629
where we had the site header earlier and
the site footer primary navigation.

11
00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.074
These types of things, I really do think
when you're using these landmark regions,

12
00:00:45.074 --> 00:00:49.210
you should give them a class and not just
style them based on the selector because

13
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.243
they can be, other than your main all of
them can be reused in different ways.

14
00:00:53.243 --> 00:00:57.568
So classes really help out just to
distinguish the different ways they can

15
00:00:57.568 --> 00:00:58.133
be used.

16
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:01.617
And so we're gonna get into some of
the more specific use cases for them, but

17
00:01:01.617 --> 00:01:04.184
there's one very generic one,
which is your section.

18
00:01:04.184 --> 00:01:08.557
And the section tends to be something
that's just more generic than

19
00:01:08.557 --> 00:01:09.794
everything else.

20
00:01:09.794 --> 00:01:14.045
So for the section, I do like actually
doing a section class, because there

21
00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:18.647
will be times you might have, like right
now, when we're looking at our design.

22
00:01:18.647 --> 00:01:22.694
We have these just sections of content,
but then you might, the client comes back,

23
00:01:22.694 --> 00:01:26.627
they want to blog, and there's articles,
and in those articles, maybe you have

24
00:01:26.627 --> 00:01:30.123
sections, and then those sections
need to be styled a bit differently.

25
00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:34.596
So using the element selector,
I'm always a little bit wary, even though

26
00:01:34.596 --> 00:01:38.643
it's kind of annoying sometimes to
just come in and have a section.

27
00:01:38.643 --> 00:01:44.577
I am, I do personally think that
putting it in the layout makes sense.

28
00:01:44.577 --> 00:01:47.278
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And coming in here and
just doing a section.

29
00:01:47.278 --> 00:01:52.027
For me, it's layout-ish because all
it's doing is creating some extra

30
00:01:52.027 --> 00:01:53.952
spacing every time I have it.

31
00:01:53.952 --> 00:01:57.214
And that's just because
every time I have a section,

32
00:01:57.214 --> 00:02:00.266
I need some space on the top and
the bottom of them.

33
00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:02.133
There's two different variations of this.

34
00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:05.179
You might have noticed it,
or you might not have, and

35
00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:07.886
if we look actually at
the smaller screens, and

36
00:02:07.886 --> 00:02:12.627
this is where you're just going back and
forth between figma, looking at things,

37
00:02:12.627 --> 00:02:16.650
how much space is there, grabbing,
and here you dive in deep enough.

38
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.864
You'll get it highlighting.

39
00:02:17.864 --> 00:02:22.577
And in there's like a padding section in
the UI that will show you how much padding

40
00:02:22.577 --> 00:02:24.114
is actually in that area.

41
00:02:24.114 --> 00:02:27.927
So you can grab those padding numbers and
use them.

42
00:02:27.927 --> 00:02:32.017
So yeah, we'd want to grab those
numbers and use them for there.

43
00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:35.643
And you'll notice in the mobile version of
it,if you go through and examine them all,

44
00:02:35.643 --> 00:02:36.496
you caneyeball it.

45
00:02:36.496 --> 00:02:40.418
Once you see the first one and then you
look through everything, the spacing is

46
00:02:40.418 --> 00:02:44.588
always the same, but when we get to the
desktop versions, there are differences.

47
00:02:44.588 --> 00:02:49.677
So in the desktop version here, this
one is a little bit narrower than here.

48
00:02:49.677 --> 00:02:52.748
This is big, this one's a bit tighter,
top and bottom.

49
00:02:52.748 --> 00:02:55.862
This one goes back to a larger space.

50
00:02:55.862 --> 00:02:58.639
And on the second page,
the hero is the same.

51
00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.534
Larger space,
I think these two are larger, and

52
00:03:01.534 --> 00:03:03.450
that last one is tighter again.

53
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.372
In general, you should see this
consistency between things.

54
00:03:07.372 --> 00:03:12.106
You might have these, a container,
a container narrow, container wide.

55
00:03:12.106 --> 00:03:15.627
You might have the same thing
with your section spacing, but

56
00:03:15.627 --> 00:03:20.197
you probably shouldn't see a different
value in every single one you go into.

57
00:03:20.197 --> 00:03:23.129
If you do that, your designer's not
doing a very good job as a designer,

58
00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.599
cuz designs should have some
consistency throughout them.

59
00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.478
So if you do see everything as different,
you can freelance it a little bit and

60
00:03:30.478 --> 00:03:33.192
just choose a value that you'd wanna use.

61
00:03:33.192 --> 00:03:35.729
Oops, just to know if you want to zoom in,

62
00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:40.513
the shortcut in Figma is space bar and
then command, or if you're on Windows,

63
00:03:40.513 --> 00:03:44.514
space bar then control, but
you have to push the space bar first.

64
00:03:44.514 --> 00:03:47.967
If you do Control or Command first and
then push space bar, it doesn't work.

65
00:03:47.967 --> 00:03:49.243
It's kind of frustrating.

66
00:03:49.243 --> 00:03:52.860
But space bar just so
you can zoom in, like that.

67
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.967
Now, because my UI is zoomed out so
much, I can't see my values here, but

68
00:03:56.967 --> 00:03:59.709
I would take the same
approach that we looked at.

69
00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.057
So in this case,
it's the top and the bottom.

70
00:04:02.057 --> 00:04:04.636
We know it needs to include
the background color.

71
00:04:04.636 --> 00:04:08.901
So I would do padding-block.

72
00:04:08.901 --> 00:04:12.532
Just like we were using our margin in line
before to add spacing on the left and

73
00:04:12.532 --> 00:04:16.617
the right, padding-block is only gonna add
the padding on the top and the bottom, so

74
00:04:16.617 --> 00:04:18.232
our block axis going up and down.

75
00:04:18.232 --> 00:04:20.195
Again its a logical property.

76
00:04:20.195 --> 00:04:25.660
It's, for me, nice to do that rather
than saying padding three REM zero, just

77
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.226
cuz then you might want to overwrite that
zero on one specific area or something.

78
00:04:31.226 --> 00:04:33.674
So padding block only, top and bottom.

79
00:04:33.674 --> 00:04:34.775
I forget what it is.

80
00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:38.094
I'm gonna put two numbers in here and
then verify them after.

81
00:04:38.094 --> 00:04:40.519
But we could have the padding
block like that, and

82
00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:43.248
then we need a media query
because we need larger sizes.

83
00:04:43.248 --> 00:04:46.737
And this, again, is where nesting
is my favorite thing in the world,

84
00:04:46.737 --> 00:04:49.930
because you can include the media
query within the selector, so

85
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.263
you don't have to repeat the selector,
which makes life easier.

86
00:04:53.263 --> 00:04:54.410
It just keeps organized.

87
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.116
Every all the code for my section is here,
I don't have to stress about scrolling

88
00:04:58.116 --> 00:05:00.259
down, finding a media
query somewhere else.

89
00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:01.110
Where is it?

90
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.611
It's all in one spot.

91
00:05:02.611 --> 00:05:05.819
The one thing people have asked me
about is by then you end up with tons

92
00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:10.117
of media queries, because every component,
every element, ends up with a media query.

93
00:05:10.117 --> 00:05:12.152
Does it bloat the code base?

94
00:05:12.152 --> 00:05:16.360
Basically every host now does compression
server side of your CSS file, and

95
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.990
the thing they're really good
at is compressing repeated code.

96
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.862
And I've done tests with media
queries like 10,000 media queries and

97
00:05:24.862 --> 00:05:29.730
I remember what but it was like 700 kb
file that turned into like 32 bytes

98
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.858
that was getting delivered to the user
just because the compression is so good.

99
00:05:34.858 --> 00:05:37.186
So if you're repeating media queries
really don't worry about it.

100
00:05:37.186 --> 00:05:41.785
If you're worried about optimization
of file size if your CSS file, it means

101
00:05:41.785 --> 00:05:46.810
you're pretty good, cause every compress
one of your images a little bit better and

102
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.763
you've probably saved more than you would
off of the compression of your CSS file,

103
00:05:51.763 --> 00:05:53.204
we're optimizing it.

104
00:05:53.204 --> 00:05:54.991
I think I did 760 last time.

105
00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:57.826
We're gonna talk more about breakpoints
once we get to the columns and

106
00:05:57.826 --> 00:05:58.893
deciding where they are.

107
00:05:58.893 --> 00:06:03.746
So I'm just using that number and
I'm using the range syntax once again.

108
00:06:03.746 --> 00:06:08.642
And here I would just say padding block
is I'm just gonna use six again I think

109
00:06:08.642 --> 00:06:10.338
these numbers are wrong.

110
00:06:10.338 --> 00:06:15.392
So I'll verify that in a minute but we'll
come and take a look at the website and

111
00:06:15.392 --> 00:06:19.142
then go back to my html and
I'm just gonna use Control + F,

112
00:06:19.142 --> 00:06:22.760
if you're on Command,
Command + F to open up the find.

113
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:28.771
And I'm just gonna look for all of my
sections so I can add that class to them.

114
00:06:28.771 --> 00:06:32.861
And again,
you could select in this project.

115
00:06:32.861 --> 00:06:36.479
If you did it directly on your
section element as your selector,

116
00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.031
you'd probably be fine, but
I'm just thinking big picture.

117
00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:44.062
It's not that hard to come in
with a class of section on there.

118
00:06:44.062 --> 00:06:46.116
If you want a different name for it,

119
00:06:46.116 --> 00:06:49.827
you could always do like padding
large something I don't know.

120
00:06:49.827 --> 00:06:52.210
I just like keeping these things simple.

121
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.679
So in each one of these,
I'm just going to add that on there.

122
00:06:56.679 --> 00:06:58.855
Use my search feature
to get to the next one.

123
00:06:58.855 --> 00:07:01.722
You could even do a find and
replace and do it quickly.

124
00:07:01.722 --> 00:07:03.692
You could end up with
all of these at once.

125
00:07:03.692 --> 00:07:08.196
There's a lot of different ways to speed
yourself up as you're using VS code if

126
00:07:08.196 --> 00:07:09.573
you're fancy with it.

127
00:07:09.573 --> 00:07:12.432
I use this all the time,
and I'm not a power user.

128
00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:16.952
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So I can see that
I brought some space in here.

129
00:07:16.952 --> 00:07:20.299
Now my content isn't all jammed
together and all touching each other,

130
00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:22.996
another space coming here,
another space coming here.

131
00:07:22.996 --> 00:07:24.039
So I've done something right.

132
00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:25.595
At least my styles are working.

133
00:07:25.595 --> 00:07:28.447
And when I increase the size of it,
there we go, you can see

134
00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:32.363
that the space got bigger because we're
hitting that media query breakpoint.

135
00:07:34.712 --> 00:07:37.657
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: The one thing,
as I mentioned, is in the Figma file,

136
00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:40.417
we do have the different
sizes that are coming in.

137
00:07:40.417 --> 00:07:43.418
So some of them are smaller and
some of them are bigger.

138
00:07:43.418 --> 00:07:47.138
So let's go get the actual
sizes that I did provide.

139
00:07:47.138 --> 00:07:50.730
So, 3.75 up to eight and a 4.5.

140
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.911
I'll try and remember that.

141
00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:57.196
So this should be a 3.75.

142
00:07:57.196 --> 00:07:59.239
This should be an eight,
which is very big.

143
00:07:59.239 --> 00:08:03.074
And if you got the sizes directly
from the Figma file and using pixels,

144
00:08:03.074 --> 00:08:04.442
it's that same debate.

145
00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:06.620
If the user did increase their font size,

146
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.555
do we want the font size to
increase this padding or not.

147
00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:12.571
Maybe you'd prefer to be coming in and
actually using pixel values here.

148
00:08:12.571 --> 00:08:16.564
Most of the time, users are zooming in,
but there are users who do change their

149
00:08:16.564 --> 00:08:19.608
size of their font, so
you do wanna take that into account.

150
00:08:19.608 --> 00:08:23.509
With nesting,
we do want to be a little bit careful, but

151
00:08:23.509 --> 00:08:26.248
we do want to modify our class here, and

152
00:08:26.248 --> 00:08:31.240
I don't mind coming in one more level
here and creating that modifier.

153
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.851
If you're doing it with the modifier
classes, rather than the data attributes,

154
00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:40.286
you would have to come outside and
do the section.

155
00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:44.124
I'm calling mine compact just because
we're compacting the padding on the top

156
00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:44.935
and the bottom.

157
00:08:44.935 --> 00:08:47.921
So you could create
a new selector here and

158
00:08:47.921 --> 00:08:52.451
then have the media query for
that one there and then change it.

159
00:08:52.451 --> 00:08:59.849
For me,
because I'm using the data attribute,

160
00:08:59.849 --> 00:09:07.246
I can include it right here and
do my ampersand and

161
00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:11.948
then data padding = compact.

162
00:09:11.948 --> 00:09:14.153
And then we could change
the padding on there.

163
00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:17.300
Whoops, sorry about that.

164
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.984
I didn't realize that put the variable.

165
00:09:18.984 --> 00:09:21.934
I think that was eight rem, there we go.

166
00:09:21.934 --> 00:09:25.457
In this case, I just realized I'm not
doing this with a custom property.

167
00:09:25.457 --> 00:09:29.174
I'm just changing the value of this.

168
00:09:29.174 --> 00:09:32.885
Why I did it here,
actually overwriting the property and

169
00:09:32.885 --> 00:09:34.903
down below with the wrappers.

170
00:09:34.903 --> 00:09:40.195
I did it with the custom property

171
00:09:40.195 --> 00:09:45.292
4.5, sorry, 4.5rem.

172
00:09:45.292 --> 00:09:47.927
I don't have a great answer for.

173
00:09:47.927 --> 00:09:53.085
So I think I'm actually gonna
change this to use a custom

174
00:09:53.085 --> 00:09:57.606
property to be more consistent, 3.75rem.

175
00:09:57.606 --> 00:10:00.441
You don't need to,
it's just a habit I really like having.

176
00:10:00.441 --> 00:10:04.668
This could even be padding block, but
that's the only value that would change or

177
00:10:04.668 --> 00:10:07.849
be the top and the bottom, so
I don't mind doing it this way.

178
00:10:07.849 --> 00:10:11.768
So that would be var padding.

179
00:10:11.768 --> 00:10:17.813
And then for each one of these,
we can switch that out right here.

180
00:10:17.813 --> 00:10:19.269
I'm gonna push Ctrl+ D.

181
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:20.589
If you're on a Mac, it's Command+D.

182
00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:26.006
it's gonna select both instances of it, so
I can just replace both at the same time.

183
00:10:26.006 --> 00:10:28.985
And so we have the padding that we
should have some larger ones and

184
00:10:28.985 --> 00:10:29.934
some smaller ones.

185
00:10:29.934 --> 00:10:32.874
We're gonna be coming with the background
colors soon, which is gonna

186
00:10:32.874 --> 00:10:35.814
make these a lot more obvious, but
I can see the compact one is already,

187
00:10:35.814 --> 00:10:39.097
I have a lot less space coming in here,
which I'm gonna have to verify cuz some of

188
00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:41.947
the spacing looks a little, no,
I think we're I think we're good.

189
00:10:41.947 --> 00:10:45.983
Yeah, we have less spacing there we have
more spacing on the other area, maybe.

190
00:10:45.983 --> 00:10:47.477
I might have to come in.

191
00:10:47.477 --> 00:10:51.130
I don't think I used that yet.

192
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:55.360
So all the way at the top,
we had the hero.

193
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.914
So the hero,
I am actually gonna add a section to that.

194
00:10:58.914 --> 00:11:02.899
We're gonna talk more about the hero
in choosing when something is gonna use

195
00:11:02.899 --> 00:11:05.760
a class like this,
which is more like a utility class,

196
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.581
versus when something would just get
styled on a selector like that one.

197
00:11:09.581 --> 00:11:13.501
But I think for the hero thing,
putting the section here makes sense,

198
00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:15.107
and then we can just come in.

199
00:11:15.107 --> 00:11:17.060
Let me just turn word wrap on for a sec.

200
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:22.055
So we can have our section
with the class on there, and

201
00:11:22.055 --> 00:11:26.721
then I could say that
the data padding = compact.

202
00:11:26.721 --> 00:11:31.748
And again, I just find it's more,
using the data attributes like this,

203
00:11:31.748 --> 00:11:34.992
is the alternative for
this would be section and

204
00:11:34.992 --> 00:11:39.453
then probably section compact,
which I find having section with

205
00:11:39.453 --> 00:11:44.270
padding compact is just a bit more
descriptive of what's happening.

206
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:48.239
You could, of course, do the padding
compact like that as well instead.

207
00:11:48.239 --> 00:11:51.138
I just find you don't really see
people doing modifiers that way.

208
00:11:51.138 --> 00:11:52.889
They usually try and keep them short.

209
00:11:52.889 --> 00:11:57.872
So with the data attribute, I find
that's one of the reasons I like it is

210
00:11:57.872 --> 00:12:02.770
I find I become more descriptive in
how I'm what things are doing, and

211
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:04.945
that's why I like using them.

212
00:12:04.945 --> 00:12:08.846
So we had that section, and
then we also needed it down on this one,

213
00:12:08.846 --> 00:12:10.740
start your forging adventure.

214
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.416
So I'm gonna look that up.

215
00:12:13.416 --> 00:12:19.480
Start your foraging adventure section

216
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:25.916
data padding = narrow compact, sorry.

217
00:12:25.916 --> 00:12:27.030
There we go.

218
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.117
And once we have the background colors and

219
00:12:29.117 --> 00:12:32.467
other things we should start seeing
these come through a lot more.
