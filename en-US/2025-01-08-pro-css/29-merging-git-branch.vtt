1
00:00:00.365 --> 00:00:03.288
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: All right, so we finished
that feature, it's completely working,

2
00:00:03.288 --> 00:00:05.277
but we've been on another
branch up until now.

3
00:00:05.277 --> 00:00:08.214
And that means that our code's
not live on our website yet, or

4
00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:12.017
anything like that even if we commit
those changes, we're not gonna see them.

5
00:00:12.017 --> 00:00:15.979
So we need to commit these changes to the
branch that we are working on, and then we

6
00:00:15.979 --> 00:00:19.848
need to merge this Branch with our main
branch now that everything is working.

7
00:00:19.848 --> 00:00:23.676
So the first thing we'll
do is commit those changes,

8
00:00:23.676 --> 00:00:27.673
so I can come here and
say functional hamburger menu, or

9
00:00:27.673 --> 00:00:32.027
added hamburger menu functionality,
put in what you want.

10
00:00:32.027 --> 00:00:34.983
I'm gonna click the + to
stage those changes, and

11
00:00:34.983 --> 00:00:37.822
I'm going to commit those
changes right there.

12
00:00:37.822 --> 00:00:43.613
And we can also sync the changes,
so those changes are in GitHub.

13
00:00:43.613 --> 00:00:47.134
But if you haven't done anything with
version control or branching before,

14
00:00:47.134 --> 00:00:50.016
as I've mentioned,
this is all on our hamburger menu branch.

15
00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:51.195
If I switch back now and

16
00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:55.302
look at my main branch, you're gonna
notice the hamburger menu disappears.

17
00:00:55.302 --> 00:00:59.492
We have two separate branches of code
right now, so our hamburger menu is only

18
00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:04.270
living in that hamburger menu branch, our
main branch doesn't see those changes yet.

19
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.198
And you can change between
the two of them down here, and

20
00:01:07.198 --> 00:01:09.269
then just select the one that you want.

21
00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:12.875
Be really careful if you're actively
working on a branch and then you go

22
00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:16.480
back to main cuz if you haven't
committed those changes that you made,

23
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.510
it'll basically think that
your then working on the main.

24
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.126
So if you're in a branch, work from
that branch until you're ready, or

25
00:01:23.126 --> 00:01:25.991
until you've committed
the changes that you've made.

26
00:01:25.991 --> 00:01:29.219
There is a way to merge branches
directly within VS Code, but

27
00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:33.523
I wouldn't really recommend doing it cuz
it's only gonna do it within VS Code and

28
00:01:33.523 --> 00:01:34.932
locally on your machine.

29
00:01:34.932 --> 00:01:38.483
We will have to delete our
Branch from here eventually, but

30
00:01:38.483 --> 00:01:43.098
what we'll actually do next is go over
to GitHub where our project is living,

31
00:01:43.098 --> 00:01:44.889
that was fem, from scratch.

32
00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:51.666
At the top here, I can see this
hamburger menu had one recent push,

33
00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:56.627
1 minute ago,
cuz I just pushed this change over

34
00:01:56.627 --> 00:02:01.730
to GitHub through my
COURCE CONTROL right there.

35
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.237
And I have this option to
compare &amp; pull request.

36
00:02:05.237 --> 00:02:08.486
So if I click that nice big button,
they make very easy to see,

37
00:02:08.486 --> 00:02:10.687
you can see it says, open a pull request.

38
00:02:10.687 --> 00:02:13.921
And the idea here is generally
speaking if you're on a solo project,

39
00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:16.452
it's a little bit different
cuz in the real-world.

40
00:02:16.452 --> 00:02:19.758
You'd open your pull request then
someone else would review it, and

41
00:02:19.758 --> 00:02:22.556
then someone else would probably
be the one merging it in.

42
00:02:22.556 --> 00:02:26.403
We're gonna be doing all of those steps
cuz we're the only one working on our

43
00:02:26.403 --> 00:02:26.951
project.

44
00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:31.148
So you can add a title, it's already gonna
put one there based on the name of it.

45
00:02:31.148 --> 00:02:35.239
So if you wanna change the title, you can,
you can add a description, solo project.

46
00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.457
You're probably not gonna be doing a lot
of descriptions, but it could be a really

47
00:02:38.457 --> 00:02:41.043
good habit to come in with a detailed
description of what you did.

48
00:02:41.043 --> 00:02:45.693
So we won't do it too much, but,

49
00:02:45.693 --> 00:02:53.679
added hamburger menu functionality for
small screens.

50
00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:56.950
And then I would even come in
with a bullet list, potentially,

51
00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.902
explaining the area hidden and a few of
the other things that are expanded and

52
00:03:00.902 --> 00:03:02.529
a few other things that we did.

53
00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:04.531
If someone else is gonna
be reviewing it so

54
00:03:04.531 --> 00:03:07.623
they know exactly the types of
things you did, why you did them,

55
00:03:07.623 --> 00:03:10.391
a bit of an explanation of
what's happening in the code.

56
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:15.951
And once you're finished with that,
you can create a pull request.

57
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:20.324
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: You're gonna get this
checking for availability to merge,

58
00:03:20.324 --> 00:03:23.769
you shouldn't run into any issues unless
you've done something on your main

59
00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:24.569
in the meantime.

60
00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.911
If you're doing solo things,
you're just creating one branch at a time,

61
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:29.937
you probably won't run into any conflicts.

62
00:03:29.937 --> 00:03:31.455
But if you're working in teams,

63
00:03:31.455 --> 00:03:35.528
there's potential that there's been other
merges that have happened in the meantime,

64
00:03:35.528 --> 00:03:38.421
and there's conflicting code,
that's a whole other story.

65
00:03:38.421 --> 00:03:42.645
Frontend Masters has a course on Git
that probably has a lot more information

66
00:03:42.645 --> 00:03:45.815
on that if you're interested
in learning more about it.

67
00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:49.503
You'll also notice, as I was talking
there, the screen changed a little

68
00:03:49.503 --> 00:03:53.086
bit just because we are on Netlify,
so GitHub did some initial checks.

69
00:03:53.086 --> 00:03:57.462
And then Netlify actually did a little bit
more here at the same time cuz it built

70
00:03:57.462 --> 00:04:00.333
the site, [LAUGH] or
it made a preview of the deploy.

71
00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:04.557
And what that means is you can actually
before you pull it into your main branch,

72
00:04:04.557 --> 00:04:07.977
you could go to the Netlify,
it's gonna have a random address.

73
00:04:07.977 --> 00:04:10.773
But you can check that
everything is working online,

74
00:04:10.773 --> 00:04:13.704
it'll have its own domain name,
everything is there.

75
00:04:13.704 --> 00:04:17.236
And you can preview it to make sure
everything is working before you actually

76
00:04:17.236 --> 00:04:20.730
pull it into the main code if you want to,
and you can see that is right here.

77
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.984
Or if I click on that link, we have,
no, okay, that brought me here, and

78
00:04:24.984 --> 00:04:29.836
then here I can do, Open deploy preview,
and it's going to be deploy-preview-1,

79
00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:33.374
and so it has its own domain name,
and this is the live version.

80
00:04:33.374 --> 00:04:37.562
Now, part of my main site yet, but it's
a nice thing with Netlify that you get

81
00:04:37.562 --> 00:04:41.897
to preview it live before you pull it in
to make sure nothing broke along the way.

82
00:04:41.897 --> 00:04:44.854
So I can close those down,
I know everything is good,

83
00:04:44.854 --> 00:04:48.886
I can come all the way down, and
then I can finally, merge pull request.

84
00:04:48.886 --> 00:04:54.190
They wanna make sure that you're being
very careful, so then I can Confirm merge

85
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.651
right there, and it will merge in, pull
request successfully merged and closed.

86
00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:02.396
Last thing here is it's gonna give
you the option to Delete the Branch,

87
00:05:02.396 --> 00:05:03.951
it's very safe to delete at this stage,

88
00:05:03.951 --> 00:05:07.093
if you ever need to reopen it for whatever
reason, there's ways you can do that.

89
00:05:07.093 --> 00:05:12.117
We're just gonna click on Delete branch
cuz we don't need it here anymore.

90
00:05:12.117 --> 00:05:13.608
This is deleting the Branch from GitHub,

91
00:05:13.608 --> 00:05:15.744
though, it's not doing anything
on your local computer.

92
00:05:15.744 --> 00:05:19.165
So locally, if we come and
take a look, it's kind of interesting,

93
00:05:19.165 --> 00:05:23.305
cuz when our SOURCE CONTROL updates, or,
sorry, I'm gonna click on this bottom

94
00:05:23.305 --> 00:05:26.866
part, you might already have it open,
but the SOURCE CONTROL Graph.

95
00:05:26.866 --> 00:05:33.711
And here we should get the,
I'm still in my hamburger menu,

96
00:05:33.711 --> 00:05:37.574
I'm gonna go back to my main branch.

97
00:05:37.574 --> 00:05:41.382
And if I go in my main,
you can actually see that it's showing us,

98
00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:42.642
can I zoom in on that?

99
00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:47.121
We can make it a bit bigger,
I can see the different

100
00:05:47.121 --> 00:05:51.709
work that was done here,
and let me zoom out again,

101
00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:57.276
there's the handle bar, okay,
let's just go full screen.

102
00:05:57.276 --> 00:06:01.540
So we can see here the different parts,
so here we'd finish page one,

103
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.082
we made the ranch, added the hamburger.

104
00:06:04.082 --> 00:06:06.163
These are the different
steps along the way,

105
00:06:06.163 --> 00:06:08.810
when we were making commits
along the way on that branch.

106
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.763
And then we can see that that branch
got pulled into the main thing,

107
00:06:11.763 --> 00:06:14.732
so it gives us a little bit of
a visualization of what's happened.

108
00:06:14.732 --> 00:06:19.198
So then I can now sync my changes, so it's
gonna pull the changes that are on GitHub

109
00:06:19.198 --> 00:06:23.164
back into my computer cuz these changes
were part of the hamburger menu.

110
00:06:23.164 --> 00:06:26.547
Branch locally, they're not locally
part of my main Branch yet.

111
00:06:26.547 --> 00:06:31.000
So going back to my main branch, I want
to sync those changes back into here, and

112
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.867
I can see the colors are all blue.

113
00:06:32.867 --> 00:06:36.235
If it's purple, it means it's
online on GitHub, if it's blue,

114
00:06:36.235 --> 00:06:37.989
it's also local on your machine.

115
00:06:37.989 --> 00:06:42.031
And you get the little visualizations
here showing you that as well.

116
00:06:42.031 --> 00:06:46.564
So we've merged our pull request number
one from your name and all of that, and

117
00:06:46.564 --> 00:06:48.083
everything is good to go.

118
00:06:48.083 --> 00:06:52.441
You will still have your hamburger branch
here, it's gonna stay local on your

119
00:06:52.441 --> 00:06:57.214
computer, you could leave it if you wanted
to, it probably won't cause any issues.

120
00:06:57.214 --> 00:07:01.027
But if you do wanna clean it up,
you can do, git,

121
00:07:01.027 --> 00:07:06.154
I did the wrong thing, it's control,
can we do it through here?

122
00:07:06.154 --> 00:07:11.074
I wonder, if I choose that Branch and

123
00:07:11.074 --> 00:07:17.279
I go to the menu Branch,
there we go, you can.

124
00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:21.504
So as long as the hamburger menu is the
active branch, we can go in the GitHub,

125
00:07:21.504 --> 00:07:25.928
the SOURCE CONTROL menu, go to Branch,
and then you can just Delete the branch.

126
00:07:25.928 --> 00:07:29.137
Make sure you're not in
the hamburger menu, I do apologize.

127
00:07:29.137 --> 00:07:37.863
From your main branch, you can go into,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: This SOURCE CONTROL menu,

128
00:07:37.863 --> 00:07:40.974
go to your branches, and
then you can Delete a branch.

129
00:07:40.974 --> 00:07:43.188
You can't delete the branch
that you're actively on,

130
00:07:43.188 --> 00:07:45.457
you can only delete other branches,
which makes sense.

131
00:07:45.457 --> 00:07:48.801
So Delete Branch,
which one do we wanna delete, and

132
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:52.541
we can delete our
hamburger menu from there.

133
00:07:52.541 --> 00:08:00.011
And now that feature is done, and
we are good to continue going.
