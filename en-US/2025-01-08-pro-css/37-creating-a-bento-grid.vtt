00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.534
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: With that section done,
we can move on down to the Bento Grid.

2
00:00:03.534 --> 00:00:05.703
I love Bento layouts,
they're quite popular right now.

3
00:00:05.703 --> 00:00:07.853
This isn't the fanciest one in the world,
but

4
00:00:07.853 --> 00:00:09.962
we also have to make
a decision along the way.

5
00:00:09.962 --> 00:00:11.243
If we look at the design,

6
00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:15.334
we have the really small size where
they're just stacked, nothing too fancy.

7
00:00:15.334 --> 00:00:16.752
It's already working.

8
00:00:16.752 --> 00:00:22.234
And then we have the large size that we
have now that looks something like this.

9
00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:24.268
We could also build in a middle-ground.

10
00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:27.178
This would be somewhere, again, if you're
actually working with the designer

11
00:00:27.178 --> 00:00:29.316
a discussion with them cuz they
didn't provide it for you,

12
00:00:29.316 --> 00:00:30.241
could be really useful.

13
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:33.294
But if you don't have anything in
the middle then you just get to

14
00:00:33.294 --> 00:00:34.224
decide what to do.

15
00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:36.950
And we'll build in a simple little
middle where it's two columns and

16
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.365
then we'll go up to the three here.

17
00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:41.843
And so, to do that, this is where, again,

18
00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:45.509
I didn't wanna rely on
the layout that we had.

19
00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:46.608
Sorry, we'll come to here.

20
00:00:46.608 --> 00:00:49.692
I didn't wanna rely on the layout for
the equal columns,

21
00:00:49.692 --> 00:00:53.043
just cuz so much of what we need
to build is completely custom.

22
00:00:53.043 --> 00:00:58.032
And when you have layouts like this, where
the elements sort of span across different

23
00:00:58.032 --> 00:01:02.066
amounts of rows or columns,
we just need to be very specific with it.

24
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:06.191
A hundred percent, this is a grid based
layout and not a Flexbox based layout.

25
00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:08.523
When I look at it,
you could build this with Flexbox.

26
00:01:08.523 --> 00:01:12.305
We used to do the layouts like this
with flexbox, but now that we have grid,

27
00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:13.340
it's a lot easier.

28
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.511
With Flexbox you'd have extra nesting of
divs just to create more columns, and

29
00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:19.142
it gets messy pretty quickly.

30
00:01:19.142 --> 00:01:20.910
And then when you wanna rearrange things,

31
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.129
you're quite limited in how
you're able to do that.

32
00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:25.438
For this, you could say it's a layout, but

33
00:01:25.438 --> 00:01:28.623
I'm gonna put it as a component
just because it's, again,

34
00:01:28.623 --> 00:01:32.450
this one specific use case that I
probably wouldn't use anywhere else.

35
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.914
If you had different Bento layouts, well,

36
00:01:34.914 --> 00:01:37.918
each Bento layout would
probably be a bit different.

37
00:01:37.918 --> 00:01:40.685
And so,
I'm just gonna do it in my components.

38
00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:46.513
So let's go look for that layer, and I'm
gonna do it sort of close to my hero area,

39
00:01:46.513 --> 00:01:52.698
again, just because the hero, the mushroom
guide, I'm gonna to plug it right here.

40
00:01:52.698 --> 00:01:58.643
And we need a name for it,
cuz it's a very unique layout.

41
00:01:58.643 --> 00:02:00.017
My faq queue is right here.

42
00:02:00.017 --> 00:02:03.671
So I did the wrapper, and
then I put all my cards in there.

43
00:02:03.671 --> 00:02:07.305
So I will come right
here after my wrapper.

44
00:02:07.305 --> 00:02:09.541
We could call it faq-bento.

45
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:14.257
You could just call it faq, faq-grid,
a name that makes sense to you.

46
00:02:14.257 --> 00:02:16.121
You might be wondering
why I'm saying bento.

47
00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:19.613
It's just the name that people give this
type of layout cuz it looks like those

48
00:02:19.613 --> 00:02:23.223
bento boxes you can get for food, where
they have these types of shapes in them.

49
00:02:23.223 --> 00:02:27.144
So if you look up bento layout for
inspiration or design or anything,

50
00:02:27.144 --> 00:02:29.315
if you wanna build a layout like this.

51
00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:33.890
If you look at bento, you'll see all sorts
of awesome layouts that use this sort of

52
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.496
mixed spanning grid thing.

53
00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:38.391
So I can put that at the very top.

54
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:42.134
Shrink all my cards down so
they're not getting in my way.

55
00:02:42.134 --> 00:02:45.411
And then after that last card,
close that div.

56
00:02:45.411 --> 00:02:51.594
So I have the bento grid, and
then I have these four coming in there.

57
00:02:51.594 --> 00:02:55.792
If we go back to my styles,
.faq-bento, and

58
00:02:55.792 --> 00:02:59.355
we can come up with something fun here.

59
00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:02.394
And this is, again,
talking about the utility classes versus

60
00:03:02.394 --> 00:03:05.329
components that are reusable,
versus just one off things.

61
00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.501
This is definitely like, I wouldn't wanna
have to build something like this with

62
00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:12.050
the utility class,
I find it just doesn't work.

63
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.730
We know that it needs to
be grid cuz I said so.

64
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.367
[LAUGH] So
we're gonna do a grid with a gap on there.

65
00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:20.845
And I can see if it's working just cuz
I should get my gap in between them.

66
00:03:20.845 --> 00:03:23.625
And again, don't be scared of
doing a really big number just so

67
00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:25.468
you can see that it's actually working.

68
00:03:25.468 --> 00:03:29.295
And it's small screen sizes,
we're done, that's it.

69
00:03:29.295 --> 00:03:31.735
Now we wanna come in
with larger screen sizes.

70
00:03:31.735 --> 00:03:36.105
And up until now we've been using the
media query of 760, so we'll start there.

71
00:03:36.105 --> 00:03:39.903
But I have a feeling that we
might need to change this.

72
00:03:39.903 --> 00:03:43.885
But we'll just say the width
is greater than 760.

73
00:03:43.885 --> 00:03:47.265
And we want to come in with
a more complicated grid now.

74
00:03:47.265 --> 00:03:48.749
So we can add some columns.

75
00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:53.018
Let's do grid-template-columns;,
or let's do the biggest one,

76
00:03:53.018 --> 00:03:55.376
because we know what that's gonna be.

77
00:03:55.376 --> 00:03:58.215
And then we can fill in
the middle-ground after actually,

78
00:03:58.215 --> 00:03:59.876
cuz I think that makes more sense.

79
00:03:59.876 --> 00:04:04.158
At the large screen size we need
three columns, is the way I see it.

80
00:04:04.158 --> 00:04:07.350
It can be sometimes hard to know,
this one's not too complicated.

81
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.120
Sometimes you'll need six columns to
be able to do what the grid looks like.

82
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.951
My suggestion is, anywhere you see a gap,
just draw a straight line going through.

83
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:19.768
So I see I have two vertical gaps,
so I know I need three columns.

84
00:04:19.768 --> 00:04:22.178
I'm also gonna need two rows.

85
00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:25.417
I tend not to declare grid template
rows unless I really need them.

86
00:04:25.417 --> 00:04:29.003
So we'll see if we can get away
without it this time around.

87
00:04:29.003 --> 00:04:35.791
So we can say repeat(3,
1fr); cuz I know I want three columns.

88
00:04:35.791 --> 00:04:40.999
And that means when we hit that break
point we get our three columns coming in.

89
00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:43.353
Awesome, it's a good start.

90
00:04:43.353 --> 00:04:45.818
We obviously need to make
the layout look a lot better.

91
00:04:45.818 --> 00:04:50.563
And when we have layouts like this that
have very specific areas for things to be.

92
00:04:50.563 --> 00:04:54.175
When we're using grid there's a couple
of different ways you can work.

93
00:04:54.175 --> 00:04:57.750
If you've played around with
grid much you'll probably

94
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.370
know about using grid column line numbers,
I like them, they're fine.

95
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.842
But when you have these different pieces
that sort of need to be rearranged

96
00:05:05.842 --> 00:05:09.258
multiple times from a small screen size
to a medium screen size to a larger

97
00:05:09.258 --> 00:05:09.940
screen size.

98
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.961
Having to select every
one of the children,

99
00:05:11.961 --> 00:05:14.425
every time that happens can
be a little bit annoying.

100
00:05:14.425 --> 00:05:19.209
If you use grid-template-areas,
you can control most of the layout

101
00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:23.831
changes that are happening without
touching the children at all and

102
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:27.658
just manipulating everything
here on the faq-bento.

103
00:05:27.658 --> 00:05:34.558
So even at the small screen sizes,
I'm gonna do a grid-template-areas:.

104
00:05:34.558 --> 00:05:41.376
This is one of those weird CSS things
where I'm gonna do it on a separate line.

105
00:05:41.376 --> 00:05:44.071
But I'm gonna write "card-one".

106
00:05:44.071 --> 00:05:46.240
And it's weird because it's
in quotation marks, and

107
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.128
I don't know why they decided to do
the quotation marks the way they did.

108
00:05:49.128 --> 00:05:53.713
It works well, but it's this other
thing with grid that's different from

109
00:05:53.713 --> 00:05:55.913
anywhere else you would do things.

110
00:05:55.913 --> 00:05:58.695
"Card-three" and a "card-four".

111
00:05:58.695 --> 00:06:02.926
And what this is basically doing is
saying, I'm gonna have one, two, three,

112
00:06:02.926 --> 00:06:03.567
four rows.

113
00:06:03.567 --> 00:06:07.922
The top row is gonna have the name of
card-one, the second row is gonna have

114
00:06:07.922 --> 00:06:12.779
a name of card-two, the third row is
card-three, the fourth row is card-four.

115
00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:16.484
Then what I can do here,
when I have this larger screen size and

116
00:06:16.484 --> 00:06:19.915
I have three columns, well,
I can come and look at that.

117
00:06:19.915 --> 00:06:25.264
I can say, you're just drawing it out,
basically.

118
00:06:25.264 --> 00:06:31.574
So grid-template-areas, once again, I
like being on a separate line once again.

119
00:06:31.574 --> 00:06:35.384
But now this is where it
gets a little bit different,

120
00:06:35.384 --> 00:06:39.551
cuz I say "card-one",
is gonna go in my first column.

121
00:06:39.551 --> 00:06:44.730
In my second column, but in the same
row I need the card-two, so card-two.

122
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.172
It's all within the same
set of quotation marks, but

123
00:06:47.172 --> 00:06:50.969
with a space between them to differentiate
that by being in the same quotation marks

124
00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:52.506
it's saying it's the same row.

125
00:06:52.506 --> 00:06:55.626
But now I'm defining two
different column names there,

126
00:06:55.626 --> 00:06:57.905
and then we need this third one over here.

127
00:06:57.905 --> 00:07:00.864
For that third one,
before we decide which card that is,

128
00:07:00.864 --> 00:07:02.845
let's go look at the smaller layout.

129
00:07:02.845 --> 00:07:06.695
Cuz that's actually my fourth card that's
all the way at the bottom, according to

130
00:07:06.695 --> 00:07:10.274
how we wrote our HTML, cuz our HTML
followed this layout that's right here.

131
00:07:10.274 --> 00:07:14.117
So that means here, whoops,

132
00:07:14.117 --> 00:07:18.429
let's go find the layout again.

133
00:07:18.429 --> 00:07:24.594
Here this is actually card-four, so
I can come here and write card-four.

134
00:07:24.594 --> 00:07:29.035
And then we can come down onto another
line, put another set of quotation marks,

135
00:07:29.035 --> 00:07:32.976
and now I'm working on this second
row that's down here at the bottom.

136
00:07:32.976 --> 00:07:38.131
We have card-three, and
then we have the second column.

137
00:07:38.131 --> 00:07:40.882
The second column also needs
the same card in there.

138
00:07:40.882 --> 00:07:43.422
So I can just say card-three again.

139
00:07:43.422 --> 00:07:47.457
And then we're in the last column,
we have card-four at the top.

140
00:07:47.457 --> 00:07:51.765
I want card-four also to go all the way
to the bottom, so I just write card-four.

141
00:07:51.765 --> 00:07:53.693
You're just basically drawing
it out the best way you can.

142
00:07:53.693 --> 00:07:56.765
If you wanna add extra spaces in
here to line things up, just so

143
00:07:56.765 --> 00:07:59.555
it's really obvious how it's
working you can do that.

144
00:07:59.555 --> 00:08:02.311
But when you save it prettier
we'll probably remove that extra

145
00:08:02.311 --> 00:08:03.514
spacing that you've put.

146
00:08:03.514 --> 00:08:06.066
The extra spaces won't
cause any difference or

147
00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:09.763
anything like that, but just so
you can sort of visualize a little bit

148
00:08:09.763 --> 00:08:12.471
more of what your grid's
actually looking like.

149
00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:15.181
So if I, prettier didn't take
it away when I hit save,

150
00:08:15.181 --> 00:08:17.312
so it keeps the formatting
kind of nice there.

151
00:08:17.312 --> 00:08:20.766
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: These names you're picking
for the grid areas aren't related to

152
00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:23.800
the HTML at all, right,
you're making these names up?

153
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.646
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Yeah, yeah,

154
00:08:24.646 --> 00:08:29.302
it won't impact classes, it has no
connection at all to anything I've done.

155
00:08:29.302 --> 00:08:33.475
You can call them anything you want,
you could probably just do them one, two,

156
00:08:33.475 --> 00:08:34.981
three four if you wanted to.

157
00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:36.110
Any name you want for

158
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:40.775
this, they're made up names that I'm just
deciding cuz it's easy to reference.

159
00:08:40.775 --> 00:08:45.744
But come up with different names
if you'd like to definitely.

160
00:08:45.744 --> 00:08:49.175
Now, when you do that, it feels like
something should have happened, but

161
00:08:49.175 --> 00:08:51.963
if we go take a look,
nothing really will have happened yet.

162
00:08:51.963 --> 00:08:54.894
We're still getting everything just
looking the same way it was before,

163
00:08:54.894 --> 00:08:57.222
cuz the browser doesn't know
what to really do with them.

164
00:08:57.222 --> 00:09:00.394
There's probably actually extra
columns and stuff being created.

165
00:09:00.394 --> 00:09:05.823
Now it's gonna be kind of weird, cuz these
cards haven't been assigned to anything.

166
00:09:05.823 --> 00:09:09.934
So we actually have to assign each
card to one of these grid areas.

167
00:09:09.934 --> 00:09:14.732
We could give each card a class to be
able to do that, and that would be fine.

168
00:09:14.732 --> 00:09:17.739
But whenever I do a layout like this,
I always wanna think of like,

169
00:09:17.739 --> 00:09:20.657
what if I took one of these out and
added like a new thing in there?

170
00:09:20.657 --> 00:09:23.493
Or what if I just wanted to
switch the position of two cards?

171
00:09:23.493 --> 00:09:27.903
So they come back and they go, actually,
Kevin, we'd really like this one here to

172
00:09:27.903 --> 00:09:31.503
go here and we're just gonna shuffle
them all in a different order.

173
00:09:31.503 --> 00:09:33.751
I don't wanna have to
move them in the HTML and

174
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:36.481
then remember which class
names they all need to have.

175
00:09:36.481 --> 00:09:40.204
So this is one of the few cases where I
think the best option is actually using

176
00:09:40.204 --> 00:09:40.923
nth-child.

177
00:09:40.923 --> 00:09:44.239
So that way, whatever order they are,
inside there, they're just

178
00:09:44.239 --> 00:09:47.853
gonna get positioned into the right place,
and it becomes very easy to do.

179
00:09:47.853 --> 00:09:56.522
So in here, I'm gonna do an :nth-child(1).

180
00:09:56.522 --> 00:10:01.748
Oops, gets a grid-area:.

181
00:10:01.748 --> 00:10:04.889
And this is where it's kind of weird,
cuz you don't use quotation marks anymore.

182
00:10:04.889 --> 00:10:06.894
You just write grid-area: one.

183
00:10:06.894 --> 00:10:10.525
Up here is plural cuz we're
defining multiple areas.

184
00:10:10.525 --> 00:10:13.699
We're creating the template
of all the different areas,

185
00:10:13.699 --> 00:10:18.310
over here is just grid-area singular cuz
we're assigning it to one of those areas.

186
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:25.290
And then, as you might guess two,

187
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:32.027
three, four, 2, 3, 4, and

188
00:10:32.027 --> 00:10:37.586
one, two, three, four.

189
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.202
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And now each one of them
has been assigned based on the order that

190
00:10:43.202 --> 00:10:45.954
they are, and
if I did that properly we should see,

191
00:10:45.954 --> 00:10:48.773
there we go,
our layout is sort of coming together.

192
00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:50.752
There's some issues with it, granted, but

193
00:10:50.752 --> 00:10:53.056
at least everything is going
where I expected it to.

194
00:10:53.056 --> 00:10:55.589
So these two first ones
just sit in the top one.

195
00:10:55.589 --> 00:10:59.740
This one stretches all the way down, and
then this other one's living over here.

196
00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.377
We do need to adjust the layout of
this one, we'll do that in a minute.

197
00:11:02.377 --> 00:11:05.584
For now, I'm pretty happy that we
actually got that layout coming together.

198
00:11:05.584 --> 00:11:10.570
And one thing I just wanna reiterate with
this is now that these have been assigned

199
00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:15.579
their areas, I can do whatever I want
where I'm declaring the different areas.

200
00:11:15.579 --> 00:11:17.065
And the cards are just
gonna lever I want to.

201
00:11:17.065 --> 00:11:21.571
I don't have to reselect any of those,
I just have to redefine the areas here.

202
00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:25.301
So really fast if we came in and

203
00:11:25.301 --> 00:11:30.689
said we'll just come in with another one.

204
00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:35.385
And we could change the breakpoints here,
but let's just say (500 width &gt; 500px).

205
00:11:35.385 --> 00:11:40.812
I could do a grid-template-areas:.

206
00:11:40.812 --> 00:11:46.562
Of, whoops, there we go.

207
00:11:46.562 --> 00:11:50.352
And we're not gonna keep this this way,

208
00:11:50.352 --> 00:11:54.477
but say we did "card-four card-one" and

209
00:11:54.477 --> 00:12:00.630
then we did a "card-three card-two" or
something like that.

210
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.790
It just means they're gonna go
to those positions at that size.

211
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:08.306
They've been assigned to the areas, I can
do as much as I want with the areas on

212
00:12:08.306 --> 00:12:12.700
the parent now, and everything's just
gonna fall into place every time.

213
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.002
It can be easy to over-rely on these
types of situations a little bit.

214
00:12:16.002 --> 00:12:19.214
I've even done it where I've gone
a bit overboard on using grid template

215
00:12:19.214 --> 00:12:22.532
areas cuz it feels like this magic
formula that just works all the time, and

216
00:12:22.532 --> 00:12:24.127
sometimes there's simpler ways.

217
00:12:24.127 --> 00:12:27.942
But when you do have a layout,
the content is not really changing, but

218
00:12:27.942 --> 00:12:31.240
it needs the different pieces
just get re-manipulated, or

219
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.649
manipulated depending on the screen size.

220
00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:36.300
Then I find grid-template-areas
are the easiest way to do it.

221
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.767
Now, as far as the break points go,

222
00:12:38.767 --> 00:12:42.892
I did say, do you wanna have
a two column version of it?

223
00:12:42.892 --> 00:12:46.641
If we go to, let's click there just so
we're looking at the browser.

224
00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:48.637
Once again, I sort of magic numbered it.

225
00:12:48.637 --> 00:12:52.207
[LAUGH] In a sense, if I'm looking here,
these look really narrow to me.

226
00:12:52.207 --> 00:12:55.197
They're getting kinda squished and
kinda way too small.

227
00:12:55.197 --> 00:12:58.110
So I'll probably make
that brick point bigger.

228
00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.687
And it's one of those things it takes,
again,

229
00:13:00.687 --> 00:13:04.050
either talk with your designer and
find what works with them.

230
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.130
Or you just sort of find the point
when you feel the break point makes

231
00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:07.908
the most sense.

232
00:13:07.908 --> 00:13:10.985
And right around there to
me it looks pretty good.

233
00:13:10.985 --> 00:13:14.558
So I'm gonna go with a 600 for that one.

234
00:13:14.558 --> 00:13:16.800
And then as we get bigger,
as we get bigger,

235
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.510
that's probably happening too early
as well, that's kind of narrow.

236
00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.710
I'd probably do that at
a bit of a wider size,

237
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:28.442
so we could do 800 or 900 and
play around with it a little bit.

238
00:13:28.442 --> 00:13:32.202
So looks a lot better at the 900 for me.

239
00:13:32.202 --> 00:13:35.427
The one thing I've done right now is I've
added two break points to my design that

240
00:13:35.427 --> 00:13:36.430
we didn't have before.

241
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.718
I was using 760 for everything.

242
00:13:38.718 --> 00:13:40.935
This one time I'm using
something a bit different, and

243
00:13:40.935 --> 00:13:42.880
I said having consistency
is really important.

244
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.149
I still stand by that, but

245
00:13:44.149 --> 00:13:48.143
you're gonna run into situations where
a layout doesn't work at certain sizes.

246
00:13:48.143 --> 00:13:51.946
So the one thing I would say is,
if I had a breakpoint that was 630 pixels,

247
00:13:51.946 --> 00:13:55.467
I would stick with my 630 here and
I wouldn't come up with a 600.

248
00:13:55.467 --> 00:13:59.216
I don't wanna have something
changing at 605, another one at 626,

249
00:13:59.216 --> 00:14:02.978
and really specific numbers that
you're coming in with the breakpoints.

250
00:14:02.978 --> 00:14:07.825
So now maybe I have three generic
breakpoints in my project, 600, the 760,

251
00:14:07.825 --> 00:14:08.806
and the 900.

252
00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:11.198
And those become the main ones
that I'm focused on going forward.

253
00:14:11.198 --> 00:14:15.225
So if I feel like the 760 doesn't work,
I know I could use one or the other.

254
00:14:15.225 --> 00:14:17.515
Another thing that we need
to do is fix our titles and

255
00:14:17.515 --> 00:14:19.124
we need to fix the layout down here.

256
00:14:19.124 --> 00:14:20.338
And actually let's just do this.

257
00:14:20.338 --> 00:14:27.089
This should just be a one, two, three and
a four, so I'll fix that right away.

258
00:14:27.089 --> 00:14:30.569
For this one, if you didn't do
it with the grid template areas,

259
00:14:30.569 --> 00:14:34.887
you could also just do grid template
columns cuz they're in the correct order,

260
00:14:34.887 --> 00:14:36.637
so it is an option there as well.

261
00:14:36.637 --> 00:14:40.239
When you're creating grid-template-areas,
if you haven't declared any

262
00:14:40.239 --> 00:14:44.672
grid-template-columns, like I haven't done
any here, it's still creating two columns.

263
00:14:44.672 --> 00:14:46.958
This is just implicitly creating them,

264
00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:51.946
cuz I'm telling it there should be two
columns through these grid-template-areas.

265
00:14:51.946 --> 00:14:54.559
There's the potential that maybe they're
a little bit of a different size.

266
00:14:54.559 --> 00:14:59.259
There's no harm in also having
the grid template columns.

267
00:14:59.259 --> 00:15:02.246
So we can do the repeat(2, 1fr) there.

268
00:15:02.246 --> 00:15:05.205
It's definitely not required,
you don't have to do it.

269
00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:08.195
If you like having that explicit
declaration there you can

270
00:15:08.195 --> 00:15:09.300
definitely have it.

271
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.341
But if you just put this and it's working,

272
00:15:12.341 --> 00:15:15.732
you can decide you don't
really wanna do that.

273
00:15:15.732 --> 00:15:17.511
But let's go fix those titles, and

274
00:15:17.511 --> 00:15:21.496
we can do the titles in the exact same way
that we did it for the previous section.

275
00:15:21.496 --> 00:15:22.634
We're looking at the parent.

276
00:15:22.634 --> 00:15:25.654
We had those card titles
that we can manipulate.

277
00:15:25.654 --> 00:15:31.575
So we can say that our card,
I think the only thing --card-title-font,

278
00:15:31.575 --> 00:15:36.122
no, color, the font size is,
I believe, the right one.

279
00:15:36.122 --> 00:15:40.243
And then we can do our
var(--text-high-contrast).

280
00:15:40.243 --> 00:15:45.711
And in doing that, let's,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: There we go,

281
00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:47.014
the right one has come through now.

282
00:15:47.014 --> 00:15:49.552
I forgot my semicolon before that and
it broke everything.

283
00:15:49.552 --> 00:15:53.947
But having that there, we can see it's
coming through with the right font color

284
00:15:53.947 --> 00:15:56.187
on those and it's looking pretty good.
