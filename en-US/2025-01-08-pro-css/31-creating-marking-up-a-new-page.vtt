00:00:00.126 --> 00:00:01.798
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: For
the second page we're gonna be doing,

2
00:00:01.798 --> 00:00:03.013
it's a separate course page.

3
00:00:03.013 --> 00:00:07.639
So if you've been following along so far
in the first course page, at the last one,

4
00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:12.221
the very last page in that first course
page, there's the link to get to part two.

5
00:00:12.221 --> 00:00:16.110
It's also the exact same URL, just change
the number one in the URL to the number

6
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.865
two, and it will go to the part two.

7
00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:21.045
For this second part, we're going
to be doing a few different things,

8
00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:23.760
we're gonna have a little bit
more interaction on this one.

9
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.452
But a big part of it is also going to be
seeing how we put a lot of work in that

10
00:00:28.452 --> 00:00:29.325
first part.

11
00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:32.461
It took a long time before we really
had the styles that were coming in,

12
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:35.077
and then the pieces sort of
fell together pretty quickly.

13
00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:38.398
And part of it will be when we start doing
page two, we'll see that, I can reuse

14
00:00:38.398 --> 00:00:41.683
a lot of what we've already done, and the
page should come together a lot faster.

15
00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:44.349
But then we also have to talk about
project maintenance a little bit because

16
00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:46.437
we're gonna have some new things
that we need to add to it.

17
00:00:46.437 --> 00:00:50.665
So how do we deal with a growing project,
where there's new things being added?

18
00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:54.691
That whole idea of reusing things that
already exist versus being able to

19
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:58.857
use things or have to build new things and
finding that balance once again.

20
00:00:58.857 --> 00:01:02.050
Some of the newer, cool, fun, things
we'll explore too are view transitions.

21
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.777
We're gonna look at single page and
cross document view transitions,

22
00:01:05.777 --> 00:01:08.634
talk about the idea of
progressive enhancements, and

23
00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:12.194
we'll also touch on some theming and
customizations near the end.

24
00:01:12.194 --> 00:01:16.050
And how you can do more with this project
or turn it into something else completely.

25
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.362
So when we're dealing with vanilla HTML,

26
00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:25.342
the easiest thing to do when you need a
new page is to just take your first page,

27
00:01:25.342 --> 00:01:28.572
copy it, paste it, and rename the file.

28
00:01:28.572 --> 00:01:33.549
The reason I like doing this, I'm gonna
call my mushroom guide, mushroom guide,

29
00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:34.199
dot HTML.

30
00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:38.064
The reason I like doing it that way is
just because I don't wanna forget anything

31
00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:38.825
along the way.

32
00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:42.468
And if I try and copy,
paste pieces from one page to the other,

33
00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:47.324
I invariably forget something along the
way, and then I start being frustrated.

34
00:01:47.324 --> 00:01:49.377
So we wanna make sure we
have that JavaScript file,

35
00:01:49.377 --> 00:01:52.409
we wanna make sure we have the link to
the Google fonts, to our style sheet.

36
00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.677
We wanna make sure our
navigation is exactly the same,

37
00:01:54.677 --> 00:01:56.562
there's a lot of pieces
that are identical.

38
00:01:56.562 --> 00:01:59.955
So we can just do a quick copy-paste,
and then you just have to go through and

39
00:01:59.955 --> 00:02:01.557
find the parts that are different.

40
00:02:01.557 --> 00:02:06.685
In this case, don't delete things that are
the same, so our navigation is the same.

41
00:02:06.685 --> 00:02:09.451
And the hero section is the same,
it's just the content that's changing.

42
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:13.270
So don't delete the hero section,
we can leave that hero section there, and

43
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.996
we'll change the content after.

44
00:02:14.996 --> 00:02:19.043
But our other sections are all different,
so

45
00:02:19.043 --> 00:02:24.060
I can come down and
find all of the ones down to my footer.

46
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.037
And I go slowly when I do this and try not
to zoom too fast just cuz I might catch

47
00:02:28.037 --> 00:02:30.836
something along the way
that I actually wanna keep.

48
00:02:30.836 --> 00:02:34.583
We can go through and delete all of those.

49
00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:38.451
Now, I'm gonna move this off to the side
cuz I wanna look at my Figma design at

50
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:40.822
the same time while I'm
doing this next part.

51
00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:43.036
So I have an idea of what
I'm trying to create.

52
00:02:43.036 --> 00:02:46.572
And again, when I'm doing the HTML, I
always like looking at the desktop one cuz

53
00:02:46.572 --> 00:02:50.127
that's where I see what the structure of
the page is actually going to look like.

54
00:02:50.127 --> 00:02:52.069
So the hero, as I said, is already done,

55
00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.795
we'll quickly change the content
in that in a little bit.

56
00:02:54.795 --> 00:02:58.724
And then after my hero,
we're gonna have a section here, and

57
00:02:58.724 --> 00:03:00.700
I'm gonna put some comments.

58
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.880
So here would be our
where to look section.

59
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.510
When we had our sections,
we always had a class of section on there,

60
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.554
so we can add that right away.

61
00:03:11.554 --> 00:03:15.458
And the padding looks like it's the larger
padding, so I'll leave that the same.

62
00:03:15.458 --> 00:03:18.903
In there, we need our two columns,
or actually, the first thing,

63
00:03:18.903 --> 00:03:21.207
we need the wrapper, so
I can put my wrapper.

64
00:03:21.207 --> 00:03:25.396
I need the two columns, so
I can do the equal-columns.

65
00:03:25.396 --> 00:03:28.757
I'm using them a little bit here,
I'm just doing dot, writing out the class,

66
00:03:28.757 --> 00:03:29.724
and then pushing tab.

67
00:03:29.724 --> 00:03:34.095
You can also push return, and
it gives you the div with the class on it.

68
00:03:34.095 --> 00:03:39.133
But in this case, once again, we want it
to be centered, and we want the wider gap.

69
00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:42.716
At this stage, we've actually
made this class of equal-columns,

70
00:03:42.716 --> 00:03:45.511
where one use case of it was
sort of the default setup.

71
00:03:45.511 --> 00:03:49.869
And then how we're doing it here,
and we used it over and over again,

72
00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:52.815
had the wider gap and
had the vertical center.

73
00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:55.761
So you might be like, well, more often,
this is what the default is.

74
00:03:55.761 --> 00:03:59.574
Maybe you come up with a different
modifier using or a simpler way to do

75
00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:03.871
this, but I'm just used to workng this
way and I find it my favour way to do it.

76
00:04:03.871 --> 00:04:07.719
So we can come right on there right
away and add those .attributes, or

77
00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:11.973
if you did modifier classes, you use
the modifier classes that you created.

78
00:04:11.973 --> 00:04:18.179
So we had data-allignment = centered,

79
00:04:18.179 --> 00:04:25.107
and data-gap is,
I think we called it large.

80
00:04:25.107 --> 00:04:28.637
Somebody can correct me if
I used a different name.

81
00:04:28.637 --> 00:04:33.661
I'm not gonna bring the content in
right away, but I'll just come here and

82
00:04:33.661 --> 00:04:38.794
we can do div and another div just so
we have space to bring our two columns in.

83
00:04:38.794 --> 00:04:40.486
And then with prettier,
it formats it for me.

84
00:04:40.486 --> 00:04:43.542
So we can be messy when
we're writing our HTML, and

85
00:04:43.542 --> 00:04:45.544
we can see the structure come in.

86
00:04:45.544 --> 00:04:48.075
If you'd rather bring the content
in right away, you definitely can.

87
00:04:48.075 --> 00:04:54.383
I'll bring in the tags, just like I
did when we were doing the first part.

88
00:04:54.383 --> 00:04:58.839
And then so I'll put my image tag here,
and later, we'll come through and

89
00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:02.609
actually bring in the image just so
we can focus on the content.

90
00:05:02.609 --> 00:05:09.810
h2 was a class of section-title and
then we needed three paragraphs.

91
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.767
If you haven't used Emmett before,
if you do a p*3 or

92
00:05:13.767 --> 00:05:17.992
a p star 3 and hit Tab,
it will give you three paragraphs.

93
00:05:17.992 --> 00:05:20.457
So we can speed you up a little
bit with things like that.

94
00:05:20.457 --> 00:05:21.930
Next up, we have the guide, and

95
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.891
we have to think about a little
bit how we're gonna do the guide.

96
00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:29.109
But I'm not gonna stress
about it too much,

97
00:05:29.109 --> 00:05:34.023
we can come here,
section with a class of section.

98
00:05:34.023 --> 00:05:36.260
And then in there, once again,
we need the wrapper,

99
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.964
it looks like the regular wrapper so
we can just put our wrapper.

100
00:05:38.964 --> 00:05:41.780
Then I need to sort of decide,
well, we do the easy wins first, so

101
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.493
we don't even have to make a decision.

102
00:05:43.493 --> 00:05:49.706
We can do an h2 class = section-title.

103
00:05:49.706 --> 00:05:51.427
Under that, we have those two filters.

104
00:05:51.427 --> 00:05:56.904
I'm just gonna use some select for
those, and we'll talk a bit about that,

105
00:05:56.904 --> 00:06:01.795
because their selects have some
limited styling you can do on them.

106
00:06:01.795 --> 00:06:05.433
But they'll get the job done,
so we'll use those for today.

107
00:06:05.433 --> 00:06:08.864
And then here,
I need to create the whole thing.

108
00:06:08.864 --> 00:06:12.862
I wouldn't suggest doing all of the cards
at once and then coming through and

109
00:06:12.862 --> 00:06:16.625
copying and pasting, and I'll explain
what I mean by that in a minute.

110
00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:18.393
But I think what I'm gonna do for

111
00:06:18.393 --> 00:06:22.531
now is I'm gonna need some sort of way
to organize this, so I'll put a div.

112
00:06:22.531 --> 00:06:25.336
I'll put a comment here to say cuz
we're gonna talk about it a bit later.

113
00:06:25.336 --> 00:06:33.633
We'll call this the grid of mushrooms
that we're going to be doing.

114
00:06:33.633 --> 00:06:37.896
And then I don't really know,
we have 12 cards here, and

115
00:06:37.896 --> 00:06:41.156
we'll come back to that and
figure that out.

116
00:06:41.156 --> 00:06:44.501
If you have an idea of how you'd
already wanna do that, by all means,

117
00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:45.377
you can go for it.

118
00:06:45.377 --> 00:06:49.257
But I think the easier thing is,
actually, once we get to creating these,

119
00:06:49.257 --> 00:06:51.044
we'll create one and then copy and

120
00:06:51.044 --> 00:06:55.188
paste it, and then change the content
through them as we go through those ones.

121
00:06:55.188 --> 00:07:01.793
And then we have this frequently
asked questions down here, so FAQ.

122
00:07:01.793 --> 00:07:06.644
We do a section, class = section.

123
00:07:06.644 --> 00:07:11.277
In this case, it has the dark background,
I think I forgot the green background up

124
00:07:11.277 --> 00:07:14.989
higher, but we could do the background
color on this one as well.

125
00:07:14.989 --> 00:07:20.492
So this would be background-extra-dark.

126
00:07:20.492 --> 00:07:23.729
That's also a section,
I'll turn off word wrap for now,

127
00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:27.975
even though I tend to leave it on most
of the time, but there's the section.

128
00:07:27.975 --> 00:07:31.583
Inside the section, we need the wrapper.

129
00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:36.496
In this case,
it's the wider version of it.

130
00:07:36.496 --> 00:07:43.342
So we had data-width = wide for
our wider wrappers.

131
00:07:43.342 --> 00:07:45.036
And then in here, we, once again,

132
00:07:45.036 --> 00:07:48.147
need to figure something out on
how we're gonna do this section.

133
00:07:48.147 --> 00:07:52.312
For this section, the columns, I think,
maybe they're not equal now that I'm

134
00:07:52.312 --> 00:07:54.838
looking at it, but
they're more or less equal.

135
00:07:54.838 --> 00:07:58.422
So you could come in with the
equal-columns, and then you could build on

136
00:07:58.422 --> 00:08:02.063
top of that to sort of create this bento
grid that we're going to be doing,

137
00:08:02.063 --> 00:08:03.504
and it would probably work.

138
00:08:03.504 --> 00:08:04.674
But because we have to do so

139
00:08:04.674 --> 00:08:07.976
much customization to have this
different type of layout coming in here,

140
00:08:07.976 --> 00:08:10.707
I don't like reusing something
that's a bit more generic.

141
00:08:10.707 --> 00:08:14.025
Just because I find then you're building
on top of it and then, I don't know,

142
00:08:14.025 --> 00:08:16.917
I just sort of have two different
things that are working together.

143
00:08:16.917 --> 00:08:20.066
I just like going with something
completely custom if it needs to look

144
00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:22.034
completely different like this one does.

145
00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:26.493
So we'll worry about this after, actually,
this one's a little bit simpler.

146
00:08:26.493 --> 00:08:28.588
And another piece of advice actually here,

147
00:08:28.588 --> 00:08:31.600
this is where I like to look at
what the mobile layout's doing.

148
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.149
Because I wanna see if I look at these
cards, they look at this here, but

149
00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:38.001
it's hard to know what order
they should actually be in.

150
00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:41.850
I know I need four different divs,
but I don't know which one goes first,

151
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:42.793
second, third.

152
00:08:42.793 --> 00:08:46.376
Is it one, two, three, four,
one, two, three, four?

153
00:08:46.376 --> 00:08:47.654
Can be hard to tell.

154
00:08:47.654 --> 00:08:50.806
And then even sometimes the order
of other things changes.

155
00:08:50.806 --> 00:08:52.976
So I know I need that complex layout,

156
00:08:52.976 --> 00:08:57.106
but then I can go and I can look at
my mobile now, or the mobile version,

157
00:08:57.106 --> 00:09:00.747
and I can get a better idea of
what the actual order of them are.

158
00:09:00.747 --> 00:09:05.300
And at this stage, I see that it's
always an image, always a title,

159
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.293
and then always
the paragraph at the bottom.

160
00:09:08.293 --> 00:09:12.904
So this is the simpler, or this is
sort of the basic version of it, and

161
00:09:12.904 --> 00:09:16.655
then we're gonna fancy up
the layout as it gets bigger.

162
00:09:16.655 --> 00:09:20.272
So we can just do a class of card for
these ones.

163
00:09:20.272 --> 00:09:22.598
We'll build these ones out cuz they're
easier than the other ones we'll be doing.

164
00:09:22.598 --> 00:09:25.723
Each one of these cards has a title, and

165
00:09:25.723 --> 00:09:30.088
we already created that,
it'd be an h3 with a class.

166
00:09:30.088 --> 00:09:36.904
I'll make it full screen so
it's less rappy, class of card__title.

167
00:09:36.904 --> 00:09:39.984
Actually, it was the image at the top,
wasn't it?

168
00:09:39.984 --> 00:09:46.519
We can bring in an image, the class title,
and then a paragraph underneath there.

169
00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:50.973
Then we only have four of those, so it's
in this part, it's probably easy enough,

170
00:09:50.973 --> 00:09:54.323
two, three, four, and
then you get the four cards coming in.

171
00:09:54.323 --> 00:09:57.964
So let's go back to seeing what we
actually have on the page, and go and

172
00:09:57.964 --> 00:09:59.275
look at our actual page.

173
00:09:59.275 --> 00:10:01.854
We have to get to there, for now,
I'm gonna write it up here just so

174
00:10:01.854 --> 00:10:03.111
I can actually see what we have.

175
00:10:03.111 --> 00:10:08.790
So it was our mushroom-guide.html in
my URL, and I can come take a look,

176
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:13.842
I see I have two broken selects,
I have these cards that are here.

177
00:10:13.842 --> 00:10:18.726
Obviously, things don't look fantastic,
but this is, I guess,

178
00:10:18.726 --> 00:10:24.310
the fun part of just going through and
getting the actual content on the page.

179
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:28.479
Whether you're using the markdown
files that were provided, or

180
00:10:28.479 --> 00:10:31.586
just grabbing it directly
from the Figma files,

181
00:10:31.586 --> 00:10:35.782
however you prefer working, but
we want to bring everything in.

182
00:10:35.782 --> 00:10:39.394
Some of these sections, like the hero,
as I mentioned, are already done.

183
00:10:39.394 --> 00:10:42.455
So those ones,
it's just about updating the content.

184
00:10:42.455 --> 00:10:49.499
So in this case, we had the quick
reference that goes right there.

185
00:10:49.499 --> 00:10:53.808
No, whoops, I'm in the wrong spot, I'm in
my navigation, go down a little lower.

186
00:10:53.808 --> 00:10:59.494
There we go,
quick reference mushroom guide.

187
00:11:01.644 --> 00:11:03.500
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: The three
paragraphs are different,

188
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.806
I'm just gonna go through this as
you're all going through it, and

189
00:11:06.806 --> 00:11:10.881
I'll talk a little bit, but this is sort
of the boring part of bringing in content.

190
00:11:10.881 --> 00:11:16.548
And one of the drawbacks of vanilla
HTML [LAUGH] and just having to copy,

191
00:11:16.548 --> 00:11:21.654
paste lots of stuff, but
it's part of the job a lot of the time.

192
00:11:21.654 --> 00:11:26.502
Where to look, bring that in,

193
00:11:26.502 --> 00:11:32.287
that was right here, copy, paste.

194
00:11:32.287 --> 00:11:36.450
I always do my paragraphs separately and
then copy, paste into them.

195
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:41.001
I used to bring text in and then try and
wrap it all, but I found that was a lot

196
00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:44.903
longer and harder for me to do,
so I've been doing it this way.

197
00:11:44.903 --> 00:11:49.510
The source for this image, assets,

198
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:53.378
look, I think it's that one.

199
00:11:53.378 --> 00:11:59.557
Once again, on your images, don't
forget to include meaningful alt text.

200
00:11:59.557 --> 00:12:05.414
So a white mushroom with
a large cap growing

201
00:12:05.414 --> 00:12:10.631
on the forest floor, let's do that.

202
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:13.824
While we're here, I'm looking at it and
you noticed we have a green background,

203
00:12:13.824 --> 00:12:16.803
and I mentioned, I forgot to put the green
background a little bit earlier.

204
00:12:16.803 --> 00:12:22.828
So on my section here,
I can also do my background accent.

205
00:12:22.828 --> 00:12:27.699
And I deleted the section class,
so I'll add that back in,

206
00:12:27.699 --> 00:12:33.134
and I can just double-check
to see how it's looking.

207
00:12:33.134 --> 00:12:34.299
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: My
background is now working.

208
00:12:38.387 --> 00:12:43.060
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Section is working,
background-accent.

209
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:47.395
There we go, I was missing
a space between the two of them.

210
00:12:47.395 --> 00:12:50.052
So that's coming in,
let's go look back here.

211
00:12:50.052 --> 00:12:52.870
The text is the larger size once again,
and

212
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.622
is white instead of being that off white.

213
00:12:55.622 --> 00:12:59.916
So if I look here, I could put this
in a lot of different places, but

214
00:12:59.916 --> 00:13:01.319
we have the div here.

215
00:13:01.319 --> 00:13:05.960
Don't forget we need to reintroduce flow,
so

216
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.008
at this, whoops, div-class= flow.

217
00:13:10.008 --> 00:13:15.489
And on this one,
I'm also gonna say font-size-lg and

218
00:13:15.489 --> 00:13:18.996
text-high-contrast, just so.

219
00:13:18.996 --> 00:13:21.829
Now, if I come take a look,
we get the larger font size and

220
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:23.143
the white text coming on.

221
00:13:23.143 --> 00:13:26.902
And one thing that's important with
this is it's not impacting the look of

222
00:13:26.902 --> 00:13:30.313
the section-titles because we're
relying on inheritance here.

223
00:13:30.313 --> 00:13:33.681
So when I'm making these changes to
the high contrast text and all of that,

224
00:13:33.681 --> 00:13:37.219
it's going to inherit into anything
that doesn't have any styling on there.

225
00:13:37.219 --> 00:13:41.940
So the paragraphs are just inheriting the
styles because the h2 has specific class

226
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.447
on there that's styling it specifically.

227
00:13:44.447 --> 00:13:48.963
It's not gonna alter the font size or
the color or

228
00:13:48.963 --> 00:13:54.045
anything like that, so
that comes in perfectly fine.

229
00:13:54.045 --> 00:13:58.034
If we keep on going, get to know
your mushrooms, we can grab that,

230
00:13:58.034 --> 00:14:01.119
section right there,
get to know your mushrooms.

231
00:14:01.119 --> 00:14:02.962
We have our selects, so for the selects,

232
00:14:02.962 --> 00:14:05.339
there's a few different
things that we need in here.

233
00:14:05.339 --> 00:14:07.985
Well, they're all gonna be options.

234
00:14:07.985 --> 00:14:09.485
So for each one of them,

235
00:14:09.485 --> 00:14:13.172
you do need to include the value
as well as what we see here.

236
00:14:13.172 --> 00:14:18.614
So we can do Season: all is my first one,
let's shrink this down.

237
00:14:18.614 --> 00:14:23.386
Again, word wrap is kind of annoying,
so I have the option, Season: all,

238
00:14:23.386 --> 00:14:26.083
season all is what
the user is going to see.

239
00:14:26.083 --> 00:14:30.605
We're gonna talk more about the selects
after as well to make them a little bit

240
00:14:30.605 --> 00:14:31.587
improved upon.

241
00:14:31.587 --> 00:14:34.810
But the value here is gonna
be really important for

242
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:39.120
actually creating the filter, so
we can just say all right there.

243
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:44.021
We can duplicate that line and
then just do

244
00:14:44.021 --> 00:14:49.260
a spring,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Summer,

245
00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.426
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Fall and Spring,

246
00:14:53.426 --> 00:14:57.891
summer fall, I would always
do the value with lowercase,

247
00:14:57.891 --> 00:15:01.091
it just makes life easier in the long run.

248
00:15:04.842 --> 00:15:07.925
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And
then we need the other second select.

249
00:15:07.925 --> 00:15:09.101
Actually, on the first one,

250
00:15:09.101 --> 00:15:11.651
you don't have to cuz the first
one will be selected by default.

251
00:15:11.651 --> 00:15:13.037
But on the first one,

252
00:15:13.037 --> 00:15:17.971
you can also indicate that that one is
the selected option from the get-go.

253
00:15:17.971 --> 00:15:21.722
But if you don't do one,
it'll always be the first one.

254
00:15:21.722 --> 00:15:26.707
For the second one, we have edible, or

255
00:15:26.707 --> 00:15:31.542
sorry, it'll be all once again, and

256
00:15:31.542 --> 00:15:35.938
then so here we can say Type: all.

257
00:15:37.098 --> 00:15:42.684
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Option, edible is Edible,

258
00:15:42.684 --> 00:15:47.570
and then we can do our last

259
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:52.931
option of toxic and Toxic.

260
00:15:52.931 --> 00:15:56.629
For these, you could do true false here,
if you wanted to as well, but

261
00:15:56.629 --> 00:16:00.781
I just found it easier once we get to the
other side and actually make this work.

262
00:16:00.781 --> 00:16:03.757
Using the same word for me was
a little bit more straightforward, but

263
00:16:03.757 --> 00:16:06.284
if you'd prefer true and
false there, you could do that.

264
00:16:06.284 --> 00:16:10.008
It'd just mean when you write
the JavaScript later on,

265
00:16:10.008 --> 00:16:14.615
it'd be a little bit different, but
if that makes more sense to you.

266
00:16:14.615 --> 00:16:16.705
Again, I'm gonna skip over these quickly,

267
00:16:16.705 --> 00:16:19.521
we'll come back to those in
a minute when we get to that part.

268
00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:23.901
And I'll just bring this content in
cuz this content is a little bit more

269
00:16:23.901 --> 00:16:25.144
straightforward.

270
00:16:25.144 --> 00:16:29.912
So each one of these has the image,

271
00:16:29.912 --> 00:16:33.534
assets, and then start.

272
00:16:33.534 --> 00:16:38.318
I tried to do the names to
be easy enough to find for

273
00:16:38.318 --> 00:16:42.881
the images,
a basket full of wild mushrooms.

274
00:16:46.435 --> 00:16:47.928
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: The title, we can grab.

275
00:16:52.282 --> 00:16:53.681
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Bring in the paragraph.

276
00:16:55.791 --> 00:17:01.132
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And I think that was one,
two, we'll go look actually again

277
00:17:01.132 --> 00:17:06.492
at the smaller design just so
we get the right order of these.

278
00:17:06.492 --> 00:17:09.093
So that's the first one,
second one is this one.

279
00:17:12.412 --> 00:17:15.660
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Again, if you're grabbing
it, I was just double-clicking a lot,

280
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.284
that will drill you down in Figma,

281
00:17:17.284 --> 00:17:20.704
but you can also control click if you
are grabbing it from the Figma file.

282
00:17:20.704 --> 00:17:27.172
Or if you're getting it from the markdown,
obviously, you're fine.

283
00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:32.085
How, whoops, assets,
identify probably, there we go.

284
00:17:32.085 --> 00:17:37.060
And then the alt text here, a mushroom

285
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:42.191
on top of a book showing the information

286
00:17:42.191 --> 00:17:46.403
about that mushroom, I guess.

287
00:17:46.403 --> 00:17:50.098
That's not the best alt text in the world,
we're going quickly here

288
00:17:50.098 --> 00:17:55.052
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Yeah,

289
00:17:55.052 --> 00:18:00.181
there we go, grab that.

290
00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:04.799
You don't wanna do that, and

291
00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:09.976
assets/where-to-find, and

292
00:18:09.976 --> 00:18:14.780
a mushroom covered in leaves,

293
00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:19.212
or a mushroom with a red cap,

294
00:18:19.212 --> 00:18:24.384
poking out from a pile of leaves,

295
00:18:24.384 --> 00:18:29.224
probably a little bit better.

296
00:18:29.224 --> 00:18:36.082
And last but not least,
we get down to this one and

297
00:18:36.082 --> 00:18:41.785
source assets, and then what seasons?

298
00:18:41.785 --> 00:18:50.535
best-seasons, alt A red capped
mushroom with white dots on it,

299
00:18:50.535 --> 00:18:55.785
growing out of a lots of forest floors,

300
00:18:55.785 --> 00:19:02.641
my alt text today, and
grab that text right there.

301
00:19:05.943 --> 00:19:09.655
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And we don't have our
sortable grid done yet, but if we come

302
00:19:09.655 --> 00:19:14.863
take a look, I close my DevTools and we'll
go full screen just to take a quick look.

303
00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:19.111
We should have the main part done,
that looks okay, we need to come and

304
00:19:19.111 --> 00:19:20.702
fix this up, obviously.

305
00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:24.174
And we need a layout here, but
at least all the content is in place,

306
00:19:24.174 --> 00:19:26.542
and we'll be able to
style that section out.

307
00:19:26.542 --> 00:19:30.813
So with that all done, we're ready to
start working on this page a bit more and

308
00:19:30.813 --> 00:19:33.126
getting that grid of cards put together.
