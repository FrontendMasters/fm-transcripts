00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.740
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: All right, so

2
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.649
now we get to get into the grid
of cards that we have here.

3
00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:07.561
So a little bit more HTML, a bit more
copying and pasting that we'll have to do.

4
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:09.576
This is the type of thing that often,

5
00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:14.062
if you're doing a bit more of an advanced
thing, you might be hooking into an API or

6
00:00:14.062 --> 00:00:18.113
something like that, to pull the data
into or from to generate the cards.

7
00:00:18.113 --> 00:00:20.010
And then you could have a lot
more cards and stuff like that.

8
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.407
But this would be a nice
introduction to this or

9
00:00:22.407 --> 00:00:24.993
something to look forward
to in a future project.

10
00:00:24.993 --> 00:00:27.332
For now,
we're gonna do it the old-fashioned way.

11
00:00:27.332 --> 00:00:31.300
And in this is why I also said, instead
of creating a whole bunch of cards,

12
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.836
it's probably a good idea.

13
00:00:32.836 --> 00:00:35.780
Just to create once you make sure
you have all the pieces you need.

14
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.133
And then once you're comfortable and
you have all of that and

15
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:42.616
we can just duplicate the old with
few work hooking into an NPA,

16
00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:46.385
go through all based on that,
what you created it for the first one.

17
00:00:46.385 --> 00:00:50.728
So, we do need a div class card.

18
00:00:50.728 --> 00:00:52.632
I'm trying as much as possibly
use semantic elements, and

19
00:00:52.632 --> 00:00:53.443
I'm using a lot of divs.

20
00:00:53.443 --> 00:00:57.577
A lot of the time, these little self
encapsulated things like these,

21
00:00:57.577 --> 00:01:01.163
you could make an argument that
they can could be an article.

22
00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:04.482
In articles, something has a self
encapsulated piece of information that you

23
00:01:04.482 --> 00:01:06.643
could play somewhere else,
on another website and

24
00:01:06.643 --> 00:01:08.571
it still makes sense
within its own context.

25
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:12.673
It doesn't need the outer context for
it to have value.

26
00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:16.562
You could probably make a case that these
could be articles because I have a title

27
00:01:16.562 --> 00:01:17.443
of the mushroom.

28
00:01:17.443 --> 00:01:20.123
I have the information about the mushroom
and a note about the mushroom.

29
00:01:20.123 --> 00:01:23.663
If this were somewhere else on
this page or anywhere else,

30
00:01:23.663 --> 00:01:25.335
it would still make sense.

31
00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:28.886
But I also feel like in this case, it's
part of this bigger picture as well, and

32
00:01:28.886 --> 00:01:31.232
it's important that it's
in this bigger picture.

33
00:01:31.232 --> 00:01:32.390
So I'm going with a div.

34
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.231
But if you'd rather use an article,

35
00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:39.365
you can probably make a very good case for
it to be one.

36
00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:44.895
I will do an h3 with
a class = card__title.

37
00:01:44.895 --> 00:01:47.449
The styling of that will talk
about a little bit later.

38
00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:50.840
I will give it the text right away,
chanterelle,

39
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.571
just so we can see a little
bit of what we're creating.

40
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:57.264
Here, we need these two
little type elements.

41
00:01:57.264 --> 00:01:59.900
So for those, I'm gonna use a list.

42
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.750
So, it's an unordered list.

43
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.552
With ul, in my mind this should still be
a list, and I'll explain why in a second.

44
00:02:07.552 --> 00:02:12.436
But, so I will do the row it's equal to
list that we talked about earlier when we

45
00:02:12.436 --> 00:02:15.251
were studying up our CSS and
doing the reset.

46
00:02:15.251 --> 00:02:20.336
And in there we have the li for edible and

47
00:02:20.336 --> 00:02:24.970
then we have another li for summer.

48
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.050
I'll come back to this list in a minute,

49
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.625
let's just get the other
content in there first.

50
00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:34.818
So in there as well, then we just have
a paragraph and grab that right away.

51
00:02:34.818 --> 00:02:38.643
And just if you're copying and pasting,
like we're gonna be doing today,

52
00:02:38.643 --> 00:02:42.290
I would encourage you to actually
Basically do the paragraph like this,

53
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.767
because it's gonna make
your life a bit easier.

54
00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:47.692
Because you can just come out of line
triple click, and paste in the new text,

55
00:02:47.692 --> 00:02:50.618
and you don't have to worry about the
paragraph tag on the top and the bottom.

56
00:02:50.618 --> 00:02:53.456
And then we have this little
bit at the bottom here.

57
00:02:53.456 --> 00:02:56.523
There's a lot of different
ways we could tackle this.

58
00:02:56.523 --> 00:02:59.046
We have it has a lighter
background color on it.

59
00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:02.736
That's the most important part of it,
you could use a utility class to do that,

60
00:03:02.736 --> 00:03:06.374
because we have a utility class that's
lightning for a light background, but

61
00:03:06.374 --> 00:03:08.321
we also have padding and a border radius.

62
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.456
So do you want to have
to do three of them and

63
00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:13.155
then have to have the same
three on every single one?

64
00:03:13.155 --> 00:03:19.378
Or we could just do something like a div
with a card note, if it was an article.

65
00:03:19.378 --> 00:03:21.205
Article, maybe you'd
say this is the footer.

66
00:03:21.205 --> 00:03:23.894
It doesn't really feel
like a footer to me, but

67
00:03:23.894 --> 00:03:27.872
it's up to you again on how you think
the semantics of this could work.

68
00:03:27.872 --> 00:03:33.046
I'm of the mind that HTML is actually
the hardest of all of the languages,

69
00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.383
because semantics are up for
debate, [LAUGH] and

70
00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:39.567
it's very hard to get
those things correct.

71
00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:43.747
Once again, just to make your life
easier for copying and pasting purposes,

72
00:03:43.747 --> 00:03:48.121
we could do the strong at the top, inside
the paragraph, and hopefully prettier

73
00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:52.015
doesn't break this on me, but
we can come in with the important notes.

74
00:03:52.015 --> 00:03:55.367
I think there, and then underneath that,

75
00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:58.821
I could come in with
the rest of it like that.

76
00:03:58.821 --> 00:03:59.892
I don't want to delete it.

77
00:03:59.892 --> 00:04:05.879
From the figma file, there we go,
copy that and paste it in.

78
00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.759
And now, when you're pasting in,
your important note always is there.

79
00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:12.895
You just triple click this line,
paste in the next text.

80
00:04:12.895 --> 00:04:15.803
The last thing we need to do,
before we duplicate this a bunch of times,

81
00:04:15.803 --> 00:04:17.268
you wanna talk more about the list.

82
00:04:17.268 --> 00:04:20.488
Right now, this list makes sense,
the list without Edible summer,

83
00:04:20.488 --> 00:04:22.110
some of the information about it.

84
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.189
We've been talking a lot about
accessibility as we've going through this.

85
00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:29.669
And if a screen reader were to come across
this, because we gave it the role of list,

86
00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.855
we will be changing the list style on it.

87
00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:34.790
It's going to say that it's
a list with two items in it, and

88
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.032
then it's gonna read out summer and
edible.

89
00:04:37.032 --> 00:04:41.209
You could probably figure out some context
about what that actually means, but

90
00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:44.341
especially the summer one could
be a little bit confusing.

91
00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:44.994
Edible, I think everybody
would understand.

92
00:04:44.994 --> 00:04:48.295
But we could add a little bit more

93
00:04:48.295 --> 00:04:53.192
information here by giving
this an aria label.

94
00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:57.988
And saying that this list is, let's say,
mushroom characteristics, like that.

95
00:04:57.988 --> 00:05:02.751
In general lists should have titles or
something that's giving the list some

96
00:05:02.751 --> 00:05:07.819
context, area label's, probably the
easiest way to do that on a regular basis.

97
00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:14.270
You can also link instead of viewing
an area label, if you have a heading,

98
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.110
you could give that heading an id and
you could use an area labeled.

99
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.362
Attribute and
then point to the id of the element,

100
00:05:23.362 --> 00:05:25.769
of the heading that's labeling it.

101
00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:30.543
I've seen times you could actually
create a heading that's completely uses

102
00:05:30.543 --> 00:05:34.961
the visibly heading and then link it,
but it feels like a bit more work.

103
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:37.288
Area label should be the last
choice that you do though.

104
00:05:37.288 --> 00:05:41.414
If you are labeling something and
that needs a little bit of extra context,

105
00:05:41.414 --> 00:05:42.800
sort of like in our menu.

106
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.068
We added the visibly hidden to
add the menu text in there,

107
00:05:46.068 --> 00:05:50.851
instead of doing an area label, because it
was really easy to do in that situation.

108
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:54.282
So area label does work if you
do need that extra context, but

109
00:05:54.282 --> 00:05:57.123
it should be probably
the last step along the way.

110
00:05:57.123 --> 00:05:59.952
The other thing is here
we could add a little

111
00:05:59.952 --> 00:06:03.497
bit more context here with the edible and
the summer.

112
00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:05.577
I'm gonna put these on
separate lengths too, again,

113
00:06:05.577 --> 00:06:06.988
to make our life a little bit easier.

114
00:06:06.988 --> 00:06:11.821
And just to make it a bit
visually more obvious

115
00:06:11.821 --> 00:06:16.781
with the span of class
is visually-hidden and

116
00:06:16.781 --> 00:06:21.360
inside that span this mushroom is edible,

117
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.702
so they get mushroom characteristics.

118
00:06:25.702 --> 00:06:29.015
This mushroom is edible,

119
00:06:29.015 --> 00:06:33.382
and then we could do another one for

120
00:06:33.382 --> 00:06:38.050
this span class is visually hidden,

121
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.567
and you could say, this or I dunno,

122
00:06:42.567 --> 00:06:47.837
best season to harvest this mushroom is,

123
00:06:47.837 --> 00:06:51.618
and then you have the summer.

124
00:06:51.618 --> 00:06:55.621
Just cause you have to think about,
again, when we're looking at the screen,

125
00:06:55.621 --> 00:06:58.309
this is kind of obvious what
those two tags are doing,

126
00:06:58.309 --> 00:07:01.980
especially if you have this other
information that's coming on there.

127
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.630
So, this just gives a little
bit of extra context for

128
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.445
when you're in other situations.

129
00:07:06.445 --> 00:07:07.686
And this can also help out for

130
00:07:07.686 --> 00:07:10.447
screen readers as well as bots
that are scraping your website.

131
00:07:10.447 --> 00:07:14.894
They're gonna see all of this content
too because it's inside of your HTML.

132
00:07:14.894 --> 00:07:17.626
So, it can be useful for
multiple different reasons.

133
00:07:17.626 --> 00:07:21.040
And the last thing I wanna do here,
while we're here,

134
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.428
is we do need to to be able to sorry sir.

135
00:07:23.428 --> 00:07:24.504
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Yeah just a quick question.

136
00:07:24.504 --> 00:07:26.218
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Would you ever recommend

137
00:07:26.218 --> 00:07:28.353
using a block quote for the card, note.

138
00:07:28.353 --> 00:07:30.590
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: if I'm not sure
about the semantics or something, or

139
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.619
if I it would be a good use case,
I'd probably go on the MDM and just look,

140
00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:35.579
because they'll give
the semantic use case.

141
00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:40.001
So we can do that fast MDM block quote,
because they always tell you sort of, so

142
00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:43.150
indicates the enclosed text
is an extended quotation.

143
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.531
So it really is meant for,

144
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:51.612
as the name sort of implies that it
should be a quote for something.

145
00:07:51.612 --> 00:07:55.249
They probably also often, yeah, you can
cite the quotes and stuff like that, but

146
00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:57.951
it really should be if you're
quoting something directly.

147
00:07:57.951 --> 00:07:59.817
In this case, it's just a visual.

148
00:07:59.817 --> 00:08:02.504
Difference, I know we use block
quotes a lot of the time just for

149
00:08:02.504 --> 00:08:05.294
a visual difference,
especially if you're writing markdown,

150
00:08:05.294 --> 00:08:08.562
because it's the easiest way just to
create a block that is easily to style.

151
00:08:08.562 --> 00:08:13.291
But if we're doing it properly, we should
be using them just for actual quotes, and

152
00:08:13.291 --> 00:08:16.488
that's why some a footer,
potentially maybe an aside,

153
00:08:16.488 --> 00:08:19.103
but I don't think an aside
is correct either.

154
00:08:19.103 --> 00:08:22.589
Cuz it is linked to the content
that we're, these sides, usually if

155
00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:26.929
it's tangential information, this is sort
of relevant information for what it is.

156
00:08:26.929 --> 00:08:28.518
So, I don't mind it just being a div,

157
00:08:28.518 --> 00:08:31.205
cuz it's more of just a visual
difference that's on there, and

158
00:08:31.205 --> 00:08:34.567
I don't really see a semantic difference
between this paragraph and this one.

159
00:08:34.567 --> 00:08:37.710
We just wanna visually highlight that
it's two different pieces of information.

160
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:38.882
At least that's how I'm seeing it.

161
00:08:38.882 --> 00:08:40.714
Again, HTML is really hard.

162
00:08:40.714 --> 00:08:43.553
The last thing that I wanna look at with
these lists is just to make our life

163
00:08:43.553 --> 00:08:45.903
easier when we're actually
going to be filtering things.

164
00:08:45.903 --> 00:08:50.630
Because when we're using JavaScript, we
have to filter, and it needs to know which

165
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.237
tags are actually on the element itself or
within that element.

166
00:08:54.237 --> 00:09:00.432
So on these, I am going to
give these a data attribute so

167
00:09:00.432 --> 00:09:05.156
we can see data edible is equal to edible.

168
00:09:05.156 --> 00:09:12.492
And then on this one, a data season
is equal to summer for the first one.

169
00:09:12.492 --> 00:09:16.725
And again, this is just for a way for
us to hook into it with JavaScript,

170
00:09:16.725 --> 00:09:21.327
you technically could actually get it to
get the inner text from here as well.

171
00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:25.553
I just find it's a lot easier if you have
a data attribute on there instead, and

172
00:09:25.553 --> 00:09:27.101
a little bit more reliable.

173
00:09:27.101 --> 00:09:31.629
So I'm gonna go with it that way, where
we're just throwing the data edible and

174
00:09:31.629 --> 00:09:35.615
a data season, if you have a different
name that you'd wanna give it,

175
00:09:35.615 --> 00:09:36.511
that's fine.

176
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:38.753
Again, this could I mentioned
the true false before,

177
00:09:38.753 --> 00:09:42.263
your data-edible could be true and false,
but then your JavaScript would be a little

178
00:09:42.263 --> 00:09:44.277
bit different from how
I'm gonna be doing mine.

179
00:09:44.277 --> 00:09:48.395
With that one in place, we have now
the fun of putting them all in there.

180
00:09:48.395 --> 00:09:55.571
So we can just, whoops, on the card here,
I can grab this entire one.

181
00:09:55.571 --> 00:09:58.211
In Visual Studio,
the default settings here,

182
00:09:58.211 --> 00:10:02.303
you can see this line goes all the way
down, just to make it easier to grab or

183
00:10:02.303 --> 00:10:05.345
you can just collapse the card so
it's easy to select.

184
00:10:05.345 --> 00:10:09.779
It's gonna select that plus everything
in it, and you can come in and

185
00:10:09.779 --> 00:10:10.931
put a second one.

186
00:10:10.931 --> 00:10:14.374
When you're doing this you could either
put all of them in and then go back

187
00:10:14.374 --> 00:10:18.450
through because there's a lot of these and
it's gonna be this huge thing in our html.

188
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.675
I actually find it easier
to just go one at time.

189
00:10:21.675 --> 00:10:25.563
And I'm gonna use the mobile view again,
just cuz they're in order, up and down.

190
00:10:25.563 --> 00:10:27.316
It makes my life a little bit easier.

191
00:10:27.316 --> 00:10:30.225
I will show you a few tricks
though to make it go a bit faster.

192
00:10:30.225 --> 00:10:34.844
So the first one is, actually I should
have done this also with the title,

193
00:10:34.844 --> 00:10:39.537
having the text always on its line just
means that when you're coming in and

194
00:10:39.537 --> 00:10:44.405
copying from here, again, double or
triple click, and it will bring it in.

195
00:10:44.405 --> 00:10:48.946
For the edible and for the season,
I'm gonna select the edible here, so

196
00:10:48.946 --> 00:10:52.529
I'm just double clicking
on the word edible, CTRL+D.

197
00:10:52.529 --> 00:10:56.412
If you're on Mac, it'd be a COMMAND+D,
and it's gonna select both of them, so

198
00:10:56.412 --> 00:10:58.849
I can just switch it at the same time and
rate toxic.

199
00:10:58.849 --> 00:11:02.515
And it changed it to toxic both so
I don't have to do it twice.

200
00:11:02.515 --> 00:11:07.346
Same thing here, double click on summer,
CTRL or COMMAND+D, and

201
00:11:07.346 --> 00:11:09.309
then this one is my spring.

202
00:11:09.309 --> 00:11:13.692
Copy that, triple click, paste it in,
it would be this paragraph,

203
00:11:13.692 --> 00:11:15.440
which it formatted for me.

204
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.075
So sometimes prettier will
format paragraphs and

205
00:11:18.075 --> 00:11:20.653
take away the spacing that
you wanted it to have.

206
00:11:20.653 --> 00:11:26.036
But we can paste that in there,
and then my important note,

207
00:11:26.036 --> 00:11:31.202
I just want this piece of it,
and then I can paste that in,

208
00:11:31.202 --> 00:11:36.174
hit Save, and
I already have the card in my clipboard.

209
00:11:36.174 --> 00:11:39.406
So again, I tend to just try and
shrink these down, because if not,

210
00:11:39.406 --> 00:11:41.637
it's gonna make, oops, that one's there.

211
00:11:41.637 --> 00:11:44.503
I tend to collapse them cuz it's
gonna make a giant wall and

212
00:11:44.503 --> 00:11:46.325
then you lose track of where you are.

213
00:11:46.325 --> 00:11:50.002
So, that's the first one, next one.

214
00:11:50.002 --> 00:11:51.791
How did I clipboard?

215
00:11:51.791 --> 00:11:52.948
I don't know if I have.

216
00:11:55.008 --> 00:11:56.225
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: There we go.

217
00:11:56.225 --> 00:12:00.992
If you're on Windows, I don't know what it
is on Mac, but if you push Windows+V you

218
00:12:00.992 --> 00:12:04.905
get like your clipboard history,
so that can be in handy sometimes.

219
00:12:04.905 --> 00:12:07.628
And now again,
we have the fun of just copy and pasting.

220
00:12:07.628 --> 00:12:09.813
So I'll let you do that while
I go through it too, and

221
00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:12.912
I'll just sort of talk my way through it,
so it's not too boring for you.

222
00:12:12.912 --> 00:12:18.079
But mushroom characteristics are fine.

223
00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:19.007
Edible is fine.

224
00:12:19.007 --> 00:12:19.981
Summer is fine.

225
00:12:23.658 --> 00:12:26.552
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: My formatting is gonna
format this for me every time that way.

226
00:12:26.552 --> 00:12:28.080
So that's okay.

227
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.665
And my important note.

228
00:12:33.311 --> 00:12:35.181
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Once you get
into the world of APIs, or

229
00:12:35.181 --> 00:12:37.640
if you've already have
entered into that world.

230
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:42.405
[LAUGH] You might find this particularly
painful, but it's not too bad.

231
00:12:42.405 --> 00:12:43.504
Collapse that down.

232
00:12:45.903 --> 00:12:53.256
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Let's paste that again,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And copy that again.

233
00:12:53.256 --> 00:12:59.316
There's also a shortcut in VS Code to be
able to grab these or to duplicate lines.

234
00:12:59.316 --> 00:13:02.686
So if you know the shortcuts,
by all means, do it your way.

235
00:13:02.686 --> 00:13:06.025
I just lost track of where
I was chicken in the woods.

236
00:13:06.025 --> 00:13:10.725
The best part about doing this is, I have
to say the people who named mushrooms,

237
00:13:10.725 --> 00:13:14.174
especially the toxic ones,
they have really good names.

238
00:13:14.174 --> 00:13:18.269
You have the death cap was the not
the lion's mane, destroying angel.

239
00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:23.595
They're quite dramatic with
their naming of their mushrooms.

240
00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:27.293
We have toxic, that one's also summer.

241
00:13:27.293 --> 00:13:31.363
Just make sure you're always
getting the data attribute

242
00:13:31.363 --> 00:13:34.677
as well as the text inside
the data attribute.

243
00:13:34.677 --> 00:13:39.251
If you miss the data attribute, then it
makes it a little bit difficult later on

244
00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:43.432
when we're doing the JavaScript,
because we need those to hook into.

245
00:13:49.706 --> 00:13:50.478
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: That one's good.

246
00:13:50.478 --> 00:13:54.585
I actually don't remember the code,
but let's see if I can remember it.

247
00:13:54.585 --> 00:13:56.803
Is it all controlled down?

248
00:13:56.803 --> 00:13:59.908
I have custom keyboard setup, so.

249
00:13:59.908 --> 00:14:01.772
Or custom binding for that shortcut.

250
00:14:01.772 --> 00:14:03.757
So I don't remember
what the actual one is.

251
00:14:08.023 --> 00:14:11.268
Mushroom characteristics,
this one is edible, but

252
00:14:11.268 --> 00:14:14.525
it's in the fall COMMAND+D,
fall for both of them.

253
00:14:21.547 --> 00:14:25.707
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: It takes a little bit of
time to do this, so I do apologize, but

254
00:14:25.707 --> 00:14:29.947
it's not too bad, and
I didn't give the finished code for it,

255
00:14:29.947 --> 00:14:35.394
just cuz part of writing HTML is the fun
of actually going through and writing it.

256
00:14:35.394 --> 00:14:38.623
Which does mean I have to do it too.

257
00:14:38.623 --> 00:14:47.485
Lions main,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Edible and fall.

258
00:14:51.507 --> 00:14:53.004
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: I think I
made a mistake along the way.

259
00:14:53.004 --> 00:14:56.352
We'll double check them
after fall is good, or

260
00:14:56.352 --> 00:15:00.200
if I did make a mistake,
it's not the end of the world,

261
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:05.613
but,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Paste

262
00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:08.003
that in important note.

263
00:15:08.003 --> 00:15:09.170
And I will say one thing,

264
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.125
people have been asking me if I
actually do much from foraging.

265
00:15:12.125 --> 00:15:16.753
I don't, but every time I'm reading the
safety warnings, I made a mistake here.

266
00:15:16.753 --> 00:15:19.923
Some of them are important notes, some of
them are safety warnings I meant to update

267
00:15:19.923 --> 00:15:21.886
the Figma file, so
they were all important notes.

268
00:15:21.886 --> 00:15:23.748
You can leave them all
important notes if you want.

269
00:15:23.748 --> 00:15:27.172
If you wanna copy the Figma file exactly,
by all means, go for it.

270
00:15:27.172 --> 00:15:28.405
I apologize for that.

271
00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:34.575
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Yeah, anytime I see
something that has potential lookalikes

272
00:15:34.575 --> 00:15:39.805
that are toxic, that would just scare me
to trying to harvest my own mushrooms.

273
00:15:43.899 --> 00:15:44.829
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Toxic.

274
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.744
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: You'll also notice I'm
not putting classes on the paragraphs and

275
00:15:58.744 --> 00:15:59.726
other things like that.

276
00:15:59.726 --> 00:16:03.938
Just because they're inheriting this
default styling our note actually is going

277
00:16:03.938 --> 00:16:06.134
to be a little bit smaller in font size,
but

278
00:16:06.134 --> 00:16:09.795
I'm not putting classes on, like,
card, paragraph, card, list,

279
00:16:09.795 --> 00:16:12.868
item, card, and like,
really doing the BEM style there.

280
00:16:12.868 --> 00:16:15.339
And this, if I don't need to do that,
I'm not going to,

281
00:16:15.339 --> 00:16:16.996
is basically the way I think about it.

282
00:16:16.996 --> 00:16:20.572
And then if it needs a modification
from what I'm already have

283
00:16:20.572 --> 00:16:24.930
then that's when I'm actually gonna
come in and bother giving it a class.

284
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:29.282
But if I can just rely on inheritance,
then I'm gonna rely on inheritance as

285
00:16:29.282 --> 00:16:32.274
much as I can because it just
makes life a lot easier.

286
00:16:36.478 --> 00:16:37.572
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Summer.

287
00:16:50.878 --> 00:16:54.492
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And while we're here,
I'll fix this in the Figma file,

288
00:16:54.492 --> 00:16:57.203
because that shouldn't be that was bold,

289
00:16:57.203 --> 00:17:02.126
there we go and I think, how many do I
have left, I still have of three or four?

290
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:17.570
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Well, the Shaggy, Maine,
again, the names of these are quite good,

291
00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:20.563
I don't know who names the mushrooms but

292
00:17:20.563 --> 00:17:25.776
it'd be a fun I guess if you discover
the mushroom, you get to name it.

293
00:17:34.243 --> 00:17:37.243
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: I definitely made
a table in one of them too, that's okay.

294
00:17:52.927 --> 00:17:58.012
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Edible and foul
the one thing I did learn from creating

295
00:17:58.012 --> 00:18:03.097
this guide is that you don't
wanna harvest mushrooms

296
00:18:03.097 --> 00:18:09.095
in the spring cuz the only ones
in the spring are the toxic ones.

297
00:18:09.095 --> 00:18:11.174
Granted, there's only
12 mushrooms here and

298
00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:13.714
I guarantee you there's other
ones that can be harvested.

299
00:18:18.579 --> 00:18:21.622
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Toxic and spring,

300
00:18:31.583 --> 00:18:36.343
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And that in and I think

301
00:18:36.343 --> 00:18:42.167
I'm on the last one good.

302
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.232
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Grab that, copy, paste.

303
00:18:54.966 --> 00:19:03.080
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Edible and the color
mistake there too that's okay, fall.

304
00:19:06.757 --> 00:19:07.860
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And,

305
00:19:17.459 --> 00:19:18.239
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: There we go, so

306
00:19:18.239 --> 00:19:20.640
if you're not done yet,
you can keep on going,

307
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.363
bringing those in I'm just gonna look
really quickly at my page to come and

308
00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:27.389
take a look at it, and
I can see that they're all coming in.

309
00:19:27.389 --> 00:19:31.306
And obviously, there's some styling and
different things we need to do on them,

310
00:19:31.306 --> 00:19:34.222
but the very first thing I'm
gonna do is just set up the grid.

311
00:19:34.222 --> 00:19:38.695
And if we come and take a look here,
once again, at small screen sizes,

312
00:19:38.695 --> 00:19:41.616
they're all just stacked, nothing too bad.

313
00:19:41.616 --> 00:19:44.633
But when we come and
take a look at the larger screen sizes,

314
00:19:44.633 --> 00:19:46.303
we need to have a grid like that.

315
00:19:46.303 --> 00:19:48.265
And so whenever I see something like this,

316
00:19:48.265 --> 00:19:50.402
my mind just goes to
grid rather than Flexbox.

317
00:19:50.402 --> 00:19:53.587
You can definitely pull this
off with Flexbox as well, but

318
00:19:53.587 --> 00:19:58.332
there'd be some compromises along the way,
and there's one solution that I always go

319
00:19:58.332 --> 00:20:01.133
to first when I see something
that looks like this.
