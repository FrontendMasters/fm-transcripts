1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.745
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So for this course,
this is what we're gonna be building.

2
00:00:01.745 --> 00:00:05.938
It is a fictional website for
a group called the Fungi Finders.

3
00:00:05.938 --> 00:00:07.794
So, there, it's a mushroom foraging group.

4
00:00:07.794 --> 00:00:09.951
You can see a screenshot
of it right there, and

5
00:00:09.951 --> 00:00:11.839
we can explore a finished version of it.

6
00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.422
The link is in the course website.

7
00:00:13.422 --> 00:00:14.602
And so if we dive into there,

8
00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:17.172
we can see the finished version
that's coming up right here.

9
00:00:17.172 --> 00:00:20.264
We have the home page where
we have some columns set up.

10
00:00:20.264 --> 00:00:22.616
A few images and
things along the way there.

11
00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:27.472
We can jump over to the second page with a
nice little transition through our pages.

12
00:00:27.472 --> 00:00:30.562
Two columns,
then we get this filtering thing here, so

13
00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:34.837
we can filter through the different types
of mushrooms that we have with a nice

14
00:00:34.837 --> 00:00:36.444
little animation on there.

15
00:00:36.444 --> 00:00:41.503
And then lower down on this page, we
have this bento-style layout for an FAQ.

16
00:00:41.503 --> 00:00:43.441
And, of course, all of this is responsive.

17
00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:47.362
So if we turn on our responsive mode,
we get different layouts and

18
00:00:47.362 --> 00:00:49.732
different sizes, all of it work fine.

19
00:00:49.732 --> 00:00:54.363
And we have a nice little transition that
comes in for our mobile navigation there,

20
00:00:54.363 --> 00:00:54.900
as well.

21
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.580
So we'll be looking at how we can do
all of these different things as we go

22
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.070
through this course.

23
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.542
And one thing that I'm focusing on a lot
through doing and creating this course is

24
00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:10.013
not only showing you how to do the steps
to make this one specific project cuz it's

25
00:01:10.013 --> 00:01:14.002
cool to make that, but I wanna make
it as highly adaptable as possible.

26
00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:16.137
So that what you're taking, first of all,

27
00:01:16.137 --> 00:01:19.207
is easy to customize if you wanna
make changes to this project.

28
00:01:19.207 --> 00:01:23.311
But also so you can be taking pieces and
the different things you're learning from

29
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:26.638
this project and
apply it to your future work as well.

30
00:01:26.638 --> 00:01:28.028
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: One
option you could have,

31
00:01:28.028 --> 00:01:30.568
if you don't like the idea
of mushroom foraging,

32
00:01:30.568 --> 00:01:34.384
is to make this into a different topic
as you're going through the course.

33
00:01:34.384 --> 00:01:36.560
But I would actually
recommend following along,

34
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.786
because a big part of this course is
to match the Figma design that we have.

35
00:01:39.786 --> 00:01:41.884
Cuz that's something we
have to do in real life,

36
00:01:41.884 --> 00:01:44.404
matching our websites to designs
that are provided to us.

37
00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:47.254
And then once you're finished with that,
if you do wanna customize it or

38
00:01:47.254 --> 00:01:50.573
change it into something else, that's a
really nice learning experience on how you

39
00:01:50.573 --> 00:01:53.590
can turn it into something new from what
you already have in the first place.

40
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.449
In the course website right here,

41
00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:59.435
there is a link directly to the Figma
file if you wanna go in through Figma.

42
00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:01.452
So if I dive into there,
I am in Figma, and

43
00:02:01.452 --> 00:02:04.188
I'm logged into it because I
have an account with them.

44
00:02:04.188 --> 00:02:06.032
And that means I can move around in here.

45
00:02:06.032 --> 00:02:07.569
I can get everything I want.

46
00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.423
I can zoom in.
I can grab the text directly from here.

47
00:02:10.423 --> 00:02:12.284
I can see the font sizes and
everything else.

48
00:02:12.284 --> 00:02:16.516
If you're logged into Figma, you can get a
lot of the information from here as well.

49
00:02:16.516 --> 00:02:20.715
If you don't have an account with them,
you'll be able to see the designs, but

50
00:02:20.715 --> 00:02:24.367
you won't actually be able to get
any of the information out of them.

51
00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:26.360
It is free to create a Figma account, and

52
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.539
you'll be able to use it that way
to get all of this information.

53
00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:31.583
So you could set up
an account if you want to.

54
00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:34.719
But if you'd prefer not to set up
an account, all of the design assets,

55
00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.700
images of all of the different things,
have all been exported, and

56
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.137
you can download them all here.

57
00:02:39.137 --> 00:02:42.759
So download assets, copy, and
designs will give you a zip file.

58
00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:47.087
And if you open up the zip file, you'll
find markdown files for page one and

59
00:02:47.087 --> 00:02:51.153
two, all the text, so you can just
copy and paste from those instead.

60
00:02:51.153 --> 00:02:53.878
We have all the assets, so
the images are provided to you.

61
00:02:53.878 --> 00:02:57.244
And then there's all
the colors in markdown, and

62
00:02:57.244 --> 00:02:59.579
the typography guides are there.

63
00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.303
And then the designs here
are all as JPEGs as well.

64
00:03:04.303 --> 00:03:06.110
So if you prefer not using Figma,
there's no issues there.

65
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.090
You can get them all just by coming in,
looking at the different JPEGs,

66
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.077
and analyzing them that way,
whatever you prefer along the way there.

67
00:03:16.077 --> 00:03:19.284
So you just download the zip,
unzip everything, and you're ready to go.

68
00:03:19.284 --> 00:03:20.430
Lastly, following along.

69
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.054
I'd encourage you to follow along.

70
00:03:22.054 --> 00:03:23.960
Don't just copy and paste the code.

71
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.578
There's quite a bit of code
that we're gonna be doing

72
00:03:26.578 --> 00:03:28.684
that's directly in this course website.

73
00:03:28.684 --> 00:03:31.184
So if you get stuck along the way,
or you want references,

74
00:03:31.184 --> 00:03:33.133
you can reference
the site as you're going.

75
00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:35.072
And if you get completely
stuck along the way,

76
00:03:35.072 --> 00:03:36.971
there's also this repo that's right here.

77
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:39.996
So if I open up that repo,
there's a part-1 and a part-2.

78
00:03:39.996 --> 00:03:43.689
And if you go into the part-1,
you'll see 04-start, 05-start, 06-start.

79
00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:45.741
That will give you the starting code for

80
00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:48.426
any of the sections that
are in the course website.

81
00:03:48.426 --> 00:03:51.992
So when we get to 04-start,
Plan of Attack, you could use the 04 one,

82
00:03:51.992 --> 00:03:54.611
05 would be the starting
of this section right here.

83
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:57.892
So if ever you're really stuck and
you need some code to compare to,

84
00:03:57.892 --> 00:04:00.782
you can always compare it to
the code that you find in there.

85
00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:05.296
There might be small discrepancies between
what's in the videos versus what's in that

86
00:04:05.296 --> 00:04:06.704
repo that's right there.

87
00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:08.583
But there'll be very small tweaks,

88
00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:12.580
just on some small differences I might be
making as I code my way through the site

89
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.564
compared to that version that
I created that time around.
