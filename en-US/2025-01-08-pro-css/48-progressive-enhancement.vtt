00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.204
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And what I just talked
about there with JavaScript is something

2
00:00:03.204 --> 00:00:05.751
that's considered
a progressive enhancement.

3
00:00:05.751 --> 00:00:09.673
We're enhancing the page for
users who have that feature, in this case,

4
00:00:09.673 --> 00:00:13.356
JavaScript, so most people are getting
the enhanced version of it.

5
00:00:13.356 --> 00:00:16.386
There's other times where we can
add progressive enhancements to our

6
00:00:16.386 --> 00:00:17.058
pages as well.

7
00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:21.462
And this is one of those situations that
comes up where people will be you know,

8
00:00:21.462 --> 00:00:24.617
should every user have
the exact same user experience?

9
00:00:24.617 --> 00:00:29.215
And people want cross browser
experiences to all be identical.

10
00:00:29.215 --> 00:00:33.125
And then there's the idea of
pixel perfection and all of this.

11
00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:37.338
I've always found it a little bit funny
that somebody's completely fine with one

12
00:00:37.338 --> 00:00:40.404
user having two different
experiences on a given website.

13
00:00:40.404 --> 00:00:42.359
Because if I open
a website on my phone and

14
00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:45.992
I go to the same website on my computer,
they're not the same experience.

15
00:00:45.992 --> 00:00:49.189
The layout is different,
the navigation is probably different,

16
00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:51.472
the interactions might even be different,
and

17
00:00:51.472 --> 00:00:54.570
that's me as a single user getting
two different experiences.

18
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.383
So, I don't understand why two users that
never see those two different, one user

19
00:00:59.383 --> 00:01:03.803
ends Fauci and one user on Chrome need
to have an exact same user experience.

20
00:01:03.803 --> 00:01:08.912
When one singular user can have multiple
different experiences on a single website.

21
00:01:08.912 --> 00:01:13.651
And the idea of progressive enhancement
is adding features that make

22
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:18.157
the site better or prettier or
do nice things, or whatever it is.

23
00:01:18.157 --> 00:01:22.001
It makes it enhances the website,
but it does so in a progressive way.

24
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:25.656
So we're not using a technology that
ruins the website for somebody else.

25
00:01:25.656 --> 00:01:28.740
Everything is completely functional,
they're getting the base styling.

26
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.982
They're gonna have
a website that works and

27
00:01:30.982 --> 00:01:34.754
then on users that are on more modern
browsers or support other features.

28
00:01:34.754 --> 00:01:38.425
Then even from could be JavaScript,
or it could be some CSS features, or

29
00:01:38.425 --> 00:01:40.123
it could be a lot of other things.

30
00:01:40.123 --> 00:01:44.556
If those are supported, then they get
that fancier version of whatever it is.

31
00:01:44.556 --> 00:01:48.789
And we're gonna be looking at a few
features, going forward from here that

32
00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.305
are really, really nice progressive
enhancements that we can add to our page.
