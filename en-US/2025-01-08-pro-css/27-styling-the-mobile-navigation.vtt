00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.938
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So with that done,
we've added or updated our HTML, so

2
00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:10.296
we can actually come over to our
source control and just say,

3
00:00:10.296 --> 00:00:17.049
addedhamburger button, and we can just
stage that change and commit that.

4
00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:20.081
Just again, it's a good practice,
every smaller change you're doing,

5
00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:21.679
you can commit these smaller changes.

6
00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.158
We can sync those changes so they're
saved and then continue working, just so

7
00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.332
you don't have one commit
that has everything.

8
00:00:27.332 --> 00:00:29.256
So if ever you do need to go backwards,

9
00:00:29.256 --> 00:00:32.092
it's easier to find the different
steps along the way.

10
00:00:32.092 --> 00:00:35.346
And with that done, we can now
think about styling the navigation.

11
00:00:35.346 --> 00:00:38.496
Because we have our button there,
does not look fantastic,

12
00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:41.971
but at least we can start getting
the mobile nav version of it done.

13
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:45.651
So I can jump back over to my
style sheet and I can come up and

14
00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:47.431
find the right component.

15
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:49.800
You could probably just do a search,
it would be faster, but

16
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.668
I can find that primary
navigation right here.

17
00:00:51.668 --> 00:00:53.610
As I mentioned a lot earlier,

18
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.583
this is one of the very few cases where I
actually use a max width media query or

19
00:00:58.583 --> 00:01:03.658
a desktop first approach, because this
is all the CSS I need for this to work.

20
00:01:03.658 --> 00:01:07.971
And I think one thing I
actually forgot earlier, so

21
00:01:07.971 --> 00:01:12.783
we can do it really quickly now
is a link of text decoration

22
00:01:12.783 --> 00:01:17.014
of none just to get rid of
the underlines on those.

23
00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:20.698
And yeah, that's all the styling I need
for my navigation at larger screen sizes,

24
00:01:20.698 --> 00:01:22.447
I don't have to make any changes to it.

25
00:01:22.447 --> 00:01:24.954
But on mobile sizes,
I need a lot more code, and

26
00:01:24.954 --> 00:01:28.178
I don't wanna have to revert
back to what I was doing before.

27
00:01:28.178 --> 00:01:33.629
So for this,
I'm gonna come in here with an app media,

28
00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:42.294
and I'm gonna do a width is less than 760
pixels this time, instead of larger than.

29
00:01:42.294 --> 00:01:46.239
Of course, this would also be if you're
using the older syntax, this would

30
00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:50.140
be coming in with doing a max width media
query instead of the min width one.

31
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.956
So we're only targeting small screens.

32
00:01:51.956 --> 00:01:56.616
I just find this as a much simpler
approach, path of least resistance.

33
00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.664
I don't have to rewrite or
overwrite things,

34
00:01:58.664 --> 00:02:01.446
I can just add the styling in where
I need that styling to exist,

35
00:02:01.446 --> 00:02:03.614
because we do need to
completely change things.

36
00:02:03.614 --> 00:02:07.757
For example, in here,
I can choose that URL, and

37
00:02:07.757 --> 00:02:10.631
we can do a list of flex direction.

38
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:15.328
Flex direction is going to be column now,
and they're gonna stack on top

39
00:02:15.328 --> 00:02:19.802
of each other instead, which is one
of the changes that we need to do.

40
00:02:19.802 --> 00:02:24.938
At this stage,
it just looking at the design itself,

41
00:02:24.938 --> 00:02:30.085
there's nothing too
complicated that we need to do.

42
00:02:30.085 --> 00:02:32.751
It's all the way over if you're
looking in the figma file.

43
00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:37.038
All the way on the right, we do have
generally what we want to style it as.

44
00:02:37.038 --> 00:02:40.135
So the hamburger is gonna stay there,
we need a green background,

45
00:02:40.135 --> 00:02:43.309
pump up the font sizes,
add those little separator lines in there.

46
00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:44.753
So what I might try and do,

47
00:02:44.753 --> 00:02:47.915
let's see if I can get this to
squeeze down at the bottom.

48
00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:50.067
So my UL, or actually not even that one.

49
00:02:50.067 --> 00:02:53.767
My primary navigation itself at
this stage, cuz if we come and

50
00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:57.268
take a look here,
I changed my flex-direction on the UL.

51
00:02:57.268 --> 00:03:00.815
But most of the styling for this actually
should be on the primary nav cuz this is

52
00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:04.008
what we're gonna be turning on and
off and our list is inside of there.

53
00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:08.784
So because of that, if I come on inside of
here, if we just look at the nesting, and

54
00:03:08.784 --> 00:03:12.690
this is where nesting sometimes
you just have to pay attention to.

55
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.048
So primary navigation,
that would be like right here.

56
00:03:16.048 --> 00:03:19.234
If I do background red,
you can see the primary,

57
00:03:19.234 --> 00:03:22.127
it's getting the red background on there.

58
00:03:22.127 --> 00:03:26.252
CSS, if ever you struggle
with knowing what's going on,

59
00:03:26.252 --> 00:03:28.366
add a background or a border.

60
00:03:28.366 --> 00:03:29.254
Everything is boxes,

61
00:03:29.254 --> 00:03:32.393
it can be really useful just to see where
it is if you're running into problems.

62
00:03:32.393 --> 00:03:36.003
And if it's not showing up,
put the background somewhere else.

63
00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:39.093
In this case, we want a background, so

64
00:03:39.093 --> 00:03:43.412
we might as well leave that
color is the accent-main.

65
00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:49.144
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So we can put that on
there, we need quite a bit of padding.

66
00:03:53.226 --> 00:03:55.870
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And I can see that
it's not like glued to the top corner of

67
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.526
the page,
I also know it's gonna have to close/open.

68
00:03:58.526 --> 00:04:01.332
I eventually wanna build
an animation into there as well.

69
00:04:01.332 --> 00:04:04.872
So because of all of that, and the syntax
highlighting has gotten a little weird in

70
00:04:04.872 --> 00:04:06.837
VS code,
because of the nested media query.

71
00:04:06.837 --> 00:04:11.434
Sometimes it just fixes itself,
so I do apologize for that.

72
00:04:11.434 --> 00:04:12.409
So if you prefer,

73
00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.635
you can always move it out if you don't
like the broken syntax highlighting.

74
00:04:16.635 --> 00:04:22.532
I'm going to do a position absolute,
because that's gonna make my life easier,

75
00:04:22.532 --> 00:04:27.070
plus the positioning of the button
fixes itself in doing that.

76
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.795
And then I can say a top of 0 and

77
00:04:29.795 --> 00:04:34.716
a right of 0 to get it off
into the corner right there.

78
00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:38.367
The font size I mentioned
needs to be bigger,

79
00:04:38.367 --> 00:04:43.568
I'm gonna go with my font size large,
and adjust it from there.

80
00:04:43.568 --> 00:04:47.925
Because we also need the font

81
00:04:47.925 --> 00:04:53.192
weight to be pulled the font family

82
00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:57.913
to be the font family heading,

83
00:04:57.913 --> 00:05:01.917
and this needs a var on it.

84
00:05:01.917 --> 00:05:03.977
And hit Save, and
just see where things are looking.

85
00:05:03.977 --> 00:05:07.086
They're not too bad actually, I'm pretty
happy with how that's looking right now.

86
00:05:07.086 --> 00:05:10.963
One problem is I've lost my button,
we'll fix that in a little bit.

87
00:05:10.963 --> 00:05:14.028
But for now,
I think the last thing I wanna do,

88
00:05:14.028 --> 00:05:18.290
I have a border radius that's only
in the bottom left over here.

89
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.943
So the easiest way to do that, you could
select that specific corner I always,

90
00:05:22.943 --> 00:05:26.625
I don't know why I don't like
the long hand of border radius.

91
00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:29.166
So I do it the hard way.

92
00:05:29.166 --> 00:05:36.056
Border radius 000, and
then order radius three.

93
00:05:36.056 --> 00:05:39.627
It's a little bit silly
to zero all of them, so

94
00:05:39.627 --> 00:05:43.574
if you prefer the long hand for
there, it's fine.

95
00:05:43.574 --> 00:05:50.160
For whatever reason, I always do it this
way, so I'm gonna keep doing it that way.

96
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.645
So looking at this,
I'm pretty happy with how it looks, but

97
00:05:52.645 --> 00:05:55.293
we do need these separators, and
we need to adjust the spacing.

98
00:05:55.293 --> 00:05:58.715
And right now that spacing
is coming from the UL here.

99
00:05:58.715 --> 00:06:01.178
If you start adding spacing
into something, and

100
00:06:01.178 --> 00:06:05.140
then you run into like issues or problems
with it, just go back to what you had,

101
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.684
but just try and figure out where
the initial spacing is coming from and

102
00:06:08.684 --> 00:06:11.778
just using your inspect is always
the easiest way to do that.

103
00:06:11.778 --> 00:06:16.374
And very easily, if it's coming from gap,
it's always gonna show the gap in this,

104
00:06:16.374 --> 00:06:20.078
like dark purple with lines shooting
through, at least in Chrome.

105
00:06:20.078 --> 00:06:24.206
I know Firefox shows gap differently
as well, I'm not sure about Safari.

106
00:06:24.206 --> 00:06:27.301
But see this way, you know right
away is it a gap from something, or

107
00:06:27.301 --> 00:06:28.645
is it a margin on something?

108
00:06:28.645 --> 00:06:32.054
Because you might forget where your
added spacing or made spacing things, so

109
00:06:32.054 --> 00:06:34.109
just finding out where
that is is a good thing.

110
00:06:34.109 --> 00:06:38.449
Because in this case, now that I
remember that it's coming from the gap,

111
00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:42.579
I'm actually gonna come on the UL and
say gap is 0 to bring them as close

112
00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:46.996
as possible together just because I
need to add those white lines in there.

113
00:06:46.996 --> 00:06:49.167
And if I had gaps,
it would be really awkward to try and

114
00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:52.274
figure out where that spacing on those
white lines is actually coming from.

115
00:06:56.111 --> 00:06:58.614
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: To add in those lines,
the easiest thing,

116
00:06:58.614 --> 00:07:02.785
in my opinion, actually I was gonna
do something more complicated when

117
00:07:02.785 --> 00:07:05.578
I was seeing the easiest
thing I could think of.

118
00:07:05.578 --> 00:07:08.614
Let's come in and
just choose our list items, and

119
00:07:08.614 --> 00:07:11.517
we're gonna do a twist
on the lobotomized owl.

120
00:07:11.517 --> 00:07:13.932
The lobotomized owl is the star plus star.

121
00:07:13.932 --> 00:07:18.626
We can do a star plus or LI plus LI,
which is effectively the same thing.

122
00:07:18.626 --> 00:07:24.847
So if I said color here, that's not
gonna work for color, background is red.

123
00:07:24.847 --> 00:07:27.038
The second and the third one
get the background that's red.

124
00:07:27.038 --> 00:07:30.570
The first one doesn't just,
instead of star plus star,

125
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:35.591
we're using the li + li just cuz I wanna
specifically only choose my list items.

126
00:07:35.591 --> 00:07:37.363
Yes.

127
00:07:37.363 --> 00:07:42.347
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can we use anchor position
to fix the menu to the button instead of

128
00:07:42.347 --> 00:07:44.021
position absolute.

129
00:07:44.021 --> 00:07:46.613
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: We could
definitely use anchor positioning,

130
00:07:46.613 --> 00:07:48.811
I'm a huge fan of anchor positioning.

131
00:07:48.811 --> 00:07:52.036
Right now if you wanted it
to grow out of the button,

132
00:07:52.036 --> 00:07:54.889
it would probably be
the easiest way to do it.

133
00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:59.213
But the browser support for
it's not fantastic yet, the poly fill for

134
00:07:59.213 --> 00:08:00.609
it's actually okay.

135
00:08:00.609 --> 00:08:04.494
It's not fully featured, cuz they paused
work on the polyfill for a while,

136
00:08:04.494 --> 00:08:08.334
because the syntax was getting updated for
how anchor positioning works.

137
00:08:08.334 --> 00:08:09.626
That's all been settled, and

138
00:08:09.626 --> 00:08:12.314
I'm pretty sure they've started
work on othe polyfill again.

139
00:08:12.314 --> 00:08:16.491
But for what we're doing in this, using
the polyfill, cuz you could do it with

140
00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:20.669
some of the simple stuff that it's able
to do, you could definitely use anchor

141
00:08:20.669 --> 00:08:24.687
positioning, but for this just to make
sure we have good browser support.

142
00:08:24.687 --> 00:08:29.105
You have to judge, I think a little bit
on that, on using new features, and

143
00:08:29.105 --> 00:08:33.875
we're gonna see some later on, where
if it breaks, it doesn't really matter,

144
00:08:33.875 --> 00:08:36.149
you're just missing the cool thing.

145
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:39.700
Whereas if anchor positioning breaks,
who knows where your menu is going, and

146
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.184
then it becomes a bit of a pain, so

147
00:08:41.184 --> 00:08:43.516
you just have to weigh like the pros and
cons of that.

148
00:08:43.516 --> 00:08:48.719
And if for you it's worth doing it,
cuz it's a personal project that you're

149
00:08:48.719 --> 00:08:54.323
doing just to experiment, then definitely
anchor positioning would be awesome or

150
00:08:54.323 --> 00:08:57.144
potentially using the polyfill as well.

151
00:08:57.144 --> 00:09:02.559
So with those, the bottom two allies
selected, and again, if you prefer,

152
00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:07.144
you could do this with not first child,
or something like that.

153
00:09:07.144 --> 00:09:09.292
That would work completely fine here.

154
00:09:09.292 --> 00:09:13.146
I don't know,
I'm a fan of this, so I use it.

155
00:09:13.146 --> 00:09:18.955
So we're choosing the second two
instead of a background of red,

156
00:09:18.955 --> 00:09:23.188
I could just do a border
top of two pixels solid.

157
00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:27.307
And this is the accent light.

158
00:09:27.307 --> 00:09:31.219
And for some reason,
it didn't wrap that for me.

159
00:09:31.219 --> 00:09:36.173
So, parentheses, var, and
I get the border coming between them.

160
00:09:36.173 --> 00:09:39.712
My first thought for that was to use
pseudo elements and they would definitely

161
00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:42.610
work, my brain just goes to using
before or after all the time.

162
00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:47.013
But for simple lines like this, just
throwing a border on there is perfect.

163
00:09:47.013 --> 00:09:48.935
In doing that, we just have to
figure out the spacing now.

164
00:09:48.935 --> 00:09:52.604
And again, with gap, it would be really
awkward because you need the gap in one

165
00:09:52.604 --> 00:09:56.454
place coming from the parent and then the
other space coming from somewhere else.

166
00:09:56.454 --> 00:10:00.160
So I like just having all
the spacing coming from one place.

167
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.165
And because I know it's on
the top of each one of these,

168
00:10:04.165 --> 00:10:07.648
then I can choose my margin-top and
I can do, or

169
00:10:07.648 --> 00:10:12.897
I've been using logical properties a lot,
so it could be margin-op.

170
00:10:12.897 --> 00:10:18.757
I could do a margin-block-start,
which is the logical property for

171
00:10:18.757 --> 00:10:24.914
top and say, that's 2rem, and
then I could do a padding-block-start

172
00:10:24.914 --> 00:10:29.300
of the same amount, and
it's going to space it out.

173
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.969
Spacing is a bit too big, but it's just
because the order we have padding,

174
00:10:32.969 --> 00:10:34.378
then border, then margin.

175
00:10:34.378 --> 00:10:38.694
I know I get the space, I get the line,
and then I get the margin coming on top,

176
00:10:38.694 --> 00:10:40.434
so it equally spaces them all.

177
00:10:40.434 --> 00:10:44.074
And then maybe these could
become 1.5 instead, and

178
00:10:44.074 --> 00:10:46.850
it looks a bit more similar to the design.

179
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:51.238
I could open my sidebar, but it's I'm
not gonna be able to see anything, so

180
00:10:51.238 --> 00:10:52.071
we can match.

181
00:10:52.071 --> 00:10:55.951
Let's see if I can get it.

182
00:10:55.951 --> 00:10:57.010
That's what I was worried about.

183
00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.129
Now that I fixed that menu.

184
00:11:05.105 --> 00:11:08.327
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: You just click Enough,
you'll eventually get in there.

185
00:11:08.327 --> 00:11:12.801
Another way you can get some spacing
values actually, if you select something

186
00:11:12.801 --> 00:11:17.228
and then you hold down ALT on your
keyboard, Option on a Mac, I'm guessing.

187
00:11:17.228 --> 00:11:21.364
When you hover over another element,
it shows you the spacing between them,

188
00:11:21.364 --> 00:11:25.002
so I can see it's 32 which should
be 2 RAM, but it looked too big.

189
00:11:25.002 --> 00:11:27.787
So I'm gonna eyeball that, and

190
00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:32.645
we'll adjust it a little bit
if we feel like it needs it.

191
00:11:32.645 --> 00:11:35.166
And you can see actually now
that I made that bigger,

192
00:11:35.166 --> 00:11:38.317
it's not showing me the mobile
nav when I'm at the larger sizes,

193
00:11:38.317 --> 00:11:41.775
it's only showing it to me when I'm
at the smaller screen sizes there.

194
00:11:41.775 --> 00:11:44.141
And let me just turn off.

195
00:11:44.141 --> 00:11:45.115
There we go.

196
00:11:45.115 --> 00:11:48.586
It's a control/ turns off the UI in figma,
so

197
00:11:48.586 --> 00:11:53.303
you just get the pictures, and
we get that coming right there.

198
00:11:53.303 --> 00:11:56.035
The last thing the styling
is basically done for it,

199
00:11:56.035 --> 00:11:59.465
the only thing left is we can't
see our button when it's opened.

200
00:11:59.465 --> 00:12:01.477
There's different ways that you
could try and deal with this.

201
00:12:01.477 --> 00:12:07.295
But because we have the position
absolute coming here on this,

202
00:12:07.295 --> 00:12:11.902
I am going to also give
this a z-index of 10, and

203
00:12:11.902 --> 00:12:18.522
then we could also come, that's all
nested in my primary navigation.

204
00:12:18.522 --> 00:12:20.075
And let's just go take a look here.

205
00:12:20.075 --> 00:12:25.856
I'm gonna select the button, which there's
different ways we could select it.

206
00:12:25.856 --> 00:12:27.621
You could add a class here.

207
00:12:27.621 --> 00:12:32.241
I already have an aria-controls, and just
to enforce the use of doing it the proper

208
00:12:32.241 --> 00:12:37.069
way, I'm gonna use the aria-controls as my
selector instead of also adding a class.

209
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:38.650
It's already there,
I might as well hook into it.

210
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.895
We've been using data attributes,
we might as well use this as well,

211
00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:43.985
and it just enforces
doing things properly.

212
00:12:43.985 --> 00:12:49.926
So I'm gonna come up here before
my primary navigation and

213
00:12:49.926 --> 00:12:53.454
just add the selector for this in.

214
00:12:53.454 --> 00:12:57.654
So it's a attribute as well, so
I just put the square brackets around it.

215
00:12:57.654 --> 00:13:03.330
And I can do a z-index of 100 on that,
just to make sure it's in front,

216
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.640
and then it's always going to be in front.

217
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.150
Actually, just really fast on that too.

218
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.571
And then the reason I'm doing
a z-index 100 here and a z-index 10,

219
00:13:11.571 --> 00:13:15.283
I could get away with not having that
10 on there, and it's still gonna work.

220
00:13:15.283 --> 00:13:19.849
I just wanna make sure it's in front of
things, so by putting the 10 on there,

221
00:13:19.849 --> 00:13:22.711
it's sort of one layer,
and then by coming here,

222
00:13:22.711 --> 00:13:25.115
I'm just my 100 as a further up layer.

223
00:13:25.115 --> 00:13:27.692
You could do this as
a much bigger number too

224
00:13:27.692 --> 00:13:31.852
just to make sure it's always on
your top layer and pushing forward.

225
00:13:31.852 --> 00:13:34.575
And I think z-index is one of those
things, and get messy really fast.

226
00:13:34.575 --> 00:13:38.522
So if you have a bit of a strategy of just
pushing things to sort of these general

227
00:13:38.522 --> 00:13:41.029
areas, it tends to work
out a little bit easier.

228
00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:41.940
Now for this button,

229
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.884
we also need to style it because
right now it does not look fantastic.

230
00:13:44.884 --> 00:13:46.943
And for
some people that are very sharp-eyed,

231
00:13:46.943 --> 00:13:49.880
you might have noticed a weird
issue that's happening with it, and

232
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.162
we had some foreshadowing
on why this would happen.

233
00:13:52.162 --> 00:13:56.083
But we're gonna do a background
of transparent and

234
00:13:56.083 --> 00:14:01.110
a border of 0, cuz buttons always
come with a border by default.

235
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:06.067
And we probably want to also come
in with a position, not a position,

236
00:14:06.067 --> 00:14:08.214
sorry, I was doing pointer.

237
00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:11.814
I want a cursor,
a pointer just to give us the little hand.

238
00:14:11.814 --> 00:14:13.885
And you can see that it's working now.

239
00:14:13.885 --> 00:14:16.998
We have our button there,
we can hover on top of it, but

240
00:14:16.998 --> 00:14:19.928
the problem with it is it
looks really funky [LAUGH].

241
00:14:19.928 --> 00:14:24.380
So I'll let you think a little
bit about why that looks so

242
00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.570
funky and how we can fix it.

243
00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:30.499
I just thought right now, though, I might
get a question about the z-index and

244
00:14:30.499 --> 00:14:33.666
why it's working, cuz I don't
have a position on this button,

245
00:14:33.666 --> 00:14:35.030
I just put that index on it.

246
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:39.499
But when they introduced grid,
they allowed z-index, the use z-index with

247
00:14:39.499 --> 00:14:43.435
grid, and it would just work without
having to have a position on it.

248
00:14:43.435 --> 00:14:47.210
And I don't know when, but at one point,
that also got added to Flexbox.

249
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:50.555
And it was just a happy accident
a while ago that I discovered that,

250
00:14:50.555 --> 00:14:52.308
I think it wasn't always a thing.

251
00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:56.335
But now if we come and take a look,
the button is a direct child of the site

252
00:14:56.335 --> 00:15:00.833
header inner, which has a display flex
on it, so I'm able to use the z-index on

253
00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:04.822
that without having a position on there,
because it's a flex child.

254
00:15:04.822 --> 00:15:08.637
Now, as for why the button looks so
weird, does anyone know why?

255
00:15:08.637 --> 00:15:12.574
Anyone think about something, what's
causing the hamburger to not look correct?

256
00:15:12.574 --> 00:15:16.532
It's a really, really silly thing,
and it's my fault, I made you do it.

257
00:15:16.532 --> 00:15:19.900
It's coming from in our base right here.

258
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.535
I said all images should have
a border radius, because I said,

259
00:15:22.535 --> 00:15:24.286
that's a nice shortcut that we can take.

260
00:15:24.286 --> 00:15:28.156
And it solved a lot of our problems,
because it gave all of our images,

261
00:15:28.156 --> 00:15:30.461
which all of them needed a border radius.

262
00:15:30.461 --> 00:15:34.354
But it just highlights why these types of
things can be a little bit like whoops,

263
00:15:34.354 --> 00:15:36.808
and it actually took me
a while to figure this out.

264
00:15:36.808 --> 00:15:39.213
[LAUGH] And I was like,
did I muck up my SVG?

265
00:15:39.213 --> 00:15:40.339
What's happening with this?

266
00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:41.915
It was really strange.

267
00:15:41.915 --> 00:15:44.618
And then enough inspecting and
a few other things, and

268
00:15:44.618 --> 00:15:48.812
I eventually realized, there's a border
radius that I forgot about on there.

269
00:15:48.812 --> 00:15:50.293
So it's just one of those
things to watch out for.

270
00:15:50.293 --> 00:15:53.802
Again, the trouble of putting
a general selector like this and

271
00:15:53.802 --> 00:15:58.434
definitely something to look forward to in
the future, like if you were to do this,

272
00:15:58.434 --> 00:16:00.703
why you really wanna be careful with it.

273
00:16:00.703 --> 00:16:07.768
I'm hesitant to say that in this type of
thing, we might as well just come in and

274
00:16:07.768 --> 00:16:13.675
say that the img has a border-radius of 0,
and then it fixes it.

275
00:16:13.675 --> 00:16:15.833
It definitely work.

276
00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:19.382
I feel like in a project like this,
I would want to note somewhere that this

277
00:16:19.382 --> 00:16:22.590
is a potential pitfall or
something that you could Could run into,

278
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:25.017
because then you could
start running into icons.

279
00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:28.654
Or you could have other things where
you definitely don't want that border

280
00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:29.526
radius on there.

281
00:16:29.526 --> 00:16:33.955
There's creative ways that you
could actually make this selector

282
00:16:33.955 --> 00:16:37.767
only work if it's a regular image and
not if it's an SVG.

283
00:16:37.767 --> 00:16:41.255
You could also have a utility class
that turns off border radiuses,

284
00:16:41.255 --> 00:16:45.106
which might be potentially the best way
to do it, just so if you run into it,

285
00:16:45.106 --> 00:16:48.621
you're like, okay, I don't want
it in this specific situation.

286
00:16:48.621 --> 00:16:52.954
But yeah, you could definitely have
something to any icons that would be

287
00:16:52.954 --> 00:16:57.642
either PNGs or SVGs with an attribute
selector would just get a border radius of

288
00:16:57.642 --> 00:17:01.075
0, which might also be a safe
way to approach it as well.

289
00:17:01.075 --> 00:17:05.524
Something to think about a little bit, but
just for this one, this is the only thing.

290
00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:08.920
So we'll throw that in there
with the caveat that maybe you

291
00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:13.027
can find a better solution as you
continue going through the project.

292
00:17:13.027 --> 00:17:16.192
Or if you wanna make an upgrade later on,

293
00:17:16.192 --> 00:17:20.578
that might be something that
you refactor a little bit.
