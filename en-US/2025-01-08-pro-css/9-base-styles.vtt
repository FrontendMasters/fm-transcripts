1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.815
And with all of that done, we want to
start getting into our regular base

2
00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:09.892
styles and setting the stage up for
everything else that's gonna happen.

3
00:00:09.892 --> 00:00:14.642
And this is where you really want
to lean into how CSS works and

4
00:00:14.642 --> 00:00:19.220
do as much here as you can so
you can write less CSS later on.

5
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.241
This is a step that I see people
not taking advantage of enough,

6
00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:25.889
we had the question about inheritance
earlier on, all of your text styles,

7
00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:28.065
most of that stuff's inherited right away.

8
00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:32.311
So if you set your typography and
your base styles up from the beginning,

9
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:35.386
it makes your life a lot
[LAUGH] Easier in the long run.

10
00:00:35.386 --> 00:00:39.463
So in here, and this is where you could
make an argument also, for a sub layer.

11
00:00:39.463 --> 00:00:43.013
Potentially, but I'm just gonna come
after the root selector closes,

12
00:00:43.013 --> 00:00:46.869
you'll also notice the difference in
the color, the braces that are in here.

13
00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:50.526
That's default VS code behavior now,
they used to need extensions for that, but

14
00:00:50.526 --> 00:00:51.434
we don't anymore.

15
00:00:51.434 --> 00:00:58.014
So, I know that's where the root's ending,
and I'm gonna do an html selector first.

16
00:00:58.014 --> 00:01:03.188
The html selector,
you don't need to set this on the html,

17
00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:09.831
you could do this on your body but I like
coming in with my font- family here.

18
00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:13.427
And so in this case,
I know my font- family is my font,

19
00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:15.552
I just do f I get the two choices.

20
00:01:15.552 --> 00:01:21.117
I choose my body, and the other
one I do here is my line- height.

21
00:01:21.117 --> 00:01:22.975
Actually with the line
he'd set earlier up, but

22
00:01:22.975 --> 00:01:24.981
a lot of time I'll set my
line- height here as well.

23
00:01:24.981 --> 00:01:29.303
It's one extra declaration, won't kill
anything, we're not really going to take

24
00:01:29.303 --> 00:01:33.162
advantage of this in this project, but
we have a lot of root properties now.

25
00:01:33.162 --> 00:01:34.749
We have root, people know of REM, so

26
00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:37.116
that's looking at the font
size of your HTML element.

27
00:01:37.116 --> 00:01:42.838
We also have root line height, root x,
root, other things, so it's for me, having

28
00:01:42.838 --> 00:01:48.015
these set here just means that those
will actually work in a predictable way.

29
00:01:48.015 --> 00:01:52.458
Because traditionally,
I used to always just apply these styles

30
00:01:52.458 --> 00:01:55.621
on the body instead of
having them on the HTML.

31
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:59.995
So these days, I put my font family and
my line height there, and

32
00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:03.328
then I come in with things
like my font size here.

33
00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:06.648
And the reason I come in
with my font size here and

34
00:02:06.648 --> 00:02:10.728
not on the HTML is because I
want my REM to stay consistent.

35
00:02:10.728 --> 00:02:14.208
The base font size that we had,
the font size 400, if we come and

36
00:02:14.208 --> 00:02:18.248
take a look at it, or actually that one's
staying the same at both sizes, but

37
00:02:18.248 --> 00:02:21.998
a lot of the time your font size at
your base level will actually change.

38
00:02:21.998 --> 00:02:26.867
And that means whatever one REM is would
change with everything if you'd set it on

39
00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:29.380
your HTML, which I don't wanna happen.

40
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.198
So I always, just for consistency sake,

41
00:02:33.198 --> 00:02:38.540
I like having the font size on my body,
so that would be my,

42
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.120
sorry, I was going to do
font-size- regular right there.

43
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.890
The color as well, you can just come
in with the color, in this case,

44
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.390
I prefixed them with text.

45
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.668
You might wanna prefix it just
with the word color instead.

46
00:02:52.668 --> 00:02:56.255
I have my text-main and
I should be able to hit save and

47
00:02:56.255 --> 00:02:58.183
I see those coming through.

48
00:02:58.183 --> 00:03:01.173
Right away, I know that there's a Problem,
because I can barely read my text.

49
00:03:01.173 --> 00:03:06.407
So that reminds me that I also want
to change my background-color, and

50
00:03:06.407 --> 00:03:11.554
this is why I like having live server
on so then I can do my background and

51
00:03:11.554 --> 00:03:16.544
in this case, it would be my
background-main, and I set it there.

52
00:03:16.544 --> 00:03:19.211
And again, this is why I really like
custom properties that are telling me

53
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:21.892
exactly how they're being used,
because I don't have to figure it out.

54
00:03:21.892 --> 00:03:26.711
I just look at my background colors,
and I probably know which one I want,

55
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:29.611
it makes my life a lot easier,
right there.

56
00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:32.746
So yeah, those are coming in,
those are looking pretty good,

57
00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:35.599
I might have forgotten something
along the way here too.

58
00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.276
I find a lot of the time when I'm
setting up these base styles,

59
00:03:38.276 --> 00:03:39.728
I sort of just do what I remember.

60
00:03:39.728 --> 00:03:41.504
And then I keep going,
and then every now and

61
00:03:41.504 --> 00:03:44.819
then you're gonna remember that you forgot
something you just go back and add it.

62
00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.337
There's this thing where people
feel like they have to write like

63
00:03:47.337 --> 00:03:48.495
the perfect code right away.

64
00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:51.270
There's no harm in like, I forgot
this one property, or this one thing.

65
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.674
So, we'll double check after to make
sure I didn't forget anything, but

66
00:03:54.674 --> 00:03:56.306
at this point, I would keep going.

67
00:03:56.306 --> 00:03:59.941
And we can set up some other things,
so this is my font-size, my color,

68
00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:02.157
we can do the same thing now for
my headings.

69
00:04:02.157 --> 00:04:07.721
So h1, h2, h3, maybe we have an h4
in this project, I'm not sure,

70
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:12.304
and we can do something like
font-family and then --ff.

71
00:04:12.304 --> 00:04:16.391
Once again for the heading,
I wouldn't set a font size here, but

72
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:20.121
if you do look in the project,
dive through the Figma file.

73
00:04:20.121 --> 00:04:23.874
All of the headings are the bright color,
so

74
00:04:23.874 --> 00:04:27.435
we can say the color is the high contrast.

75
00:04:27.435 --> 00:04:31.254
And I can see that's changed,
it's not the easiest thing to see, but

76
00:04:31.254 --> 00:04:33.933
you can definitely see
that it has shifted over.

77
00:04:33.933 --> 00:04:39.519
Then we can say that my h1 set up your
font styles, so the sizes I mean,

78
00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:45.014
so font-size is in this case,
actually we didn't decide earlier,

79
00:04:45.014 --> 00:04:51.294
so this would be something we'll come
back to and we style the main area there.

80
00:04:51.294 --> 00:04:55.944
So my font size, I have to decide
if I want the extra large and

81
00:04:55.944 --> 00:05:00.697
then if I'm gonna do something
to make the top area smaller.

82
00:05:00.697 --> 00:05:03.196
Or if I'm gonna say
that it's the large and

83
00:05:03.196 --> 00:05:06.121
then do something to make
the bottom text bigger.

84
00:05:06.121 --> 00:05:09.754
I'm gonna do it this way, but if you
think the other way around, makes sense.

85
00:05:09.754 --> 00:05:13.069
Choose whichever one you want, but
I should see that text get nice and big.

86
00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:17.429
Now, the one thing I will say here,
actually, with these is, right now,

87
00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:20.130
I'm selecting that on an h1,
for that one for

88
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.699
now, I'm gonna leave it on the h1 it's
probably not the end of the world, but

89
00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.120
I tend to avoid setting base
styles on the heading levels.

90
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.142
So a lot of people do like, doing like,
then they're h2 setting the styles there

91
00:05:32.142 --> 00:05:35.430
for like, the next font size down and
then the next font size down.

92
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.946
But wrong shortcut, if we come and

93
00:05:39.946 --> 00:05:43.853
take a look at the Figma file.

94
00:05:43.853 --> 00:05:47.191
If I look here like this,
makes sense to be an h2 and

95
00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:50.686
then these guys down here
wouldn't become an h3, so

96
00:05:50.686 --> 00:05:55.283
my h3 here is kind of big, not huge,
but it's big enough and orange.

97
00:05:55.283 --> 00:06:00.036
But then if I come and take a look here,
these are probably also h3s, and,

98
00:06:00.036 --> 00:06:04.650
there's these over here also gonna
be h3's when I'm looking at this.

99
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.522
And one problem that you can run into,
if you're using the regular

100
00:06:09.522 --> 00:06:14.047
selector like this is,
you're gonna start picking styles,

101
00:06:14.047 --> 00:06:18.941
you're gonna start picking elements
based on how you style them.

102
00:06:18.941 --> 00:06:24.042
Rather than picking the right
semantic element to go with it, so,

103
00:06:24.042 --> 00:06:29.794
I don't like having my style linked
to the semantic version of something.

104
00:06:29.794 --> 00:06:34.073
I just find that all it does is make
me make bad decisions along the way.

105
00:06:34.073 --> 00:06:37.250
So instead of linking it to an h1, h2,
h3, this one will leave like this and

106
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.902
potentially change a little bit later.

107
00:06:38.902 --> 00:06:43.338
But for my h2, we could come in,
and instead of that,

108
00:06:43.338 --> 00:06:46.616
maybe it's a section title instead, or

109
00:06:46.616 --> 00:06:51.548
maybe you could even have heading-md or
different things.

110
00:06:51.548 --> 00:06:53.139
We're gonn tackle this a little bit later,

111
00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:54.775
once we actually have
to start styling them.

112
00:06:54.775 --> 00:06:59.226
If you wanna start thinking about that
now, it's a really good thing to sort of

113
00:06:59.226 --> 00:07:03.205
start exploring and thinking about
a little bit just because, yeah,

114
00:07:03.205 --> 00:07:06.325
I like separating those
concerns as much as possible.

115
00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:09.611
Just to make sure I'm choosing
the right semantic element and

116
00:07:09.611 --> 00:07:13.527
then just using CSS to style it, and
doing that with a range of selectors,

117
00:07:13.527 --> 00:07:16.951
instead of linking it directly to the h1,
h2, h3, levels.

118
00:07:16.951 --> 00:07:21.274
Some projects you're gonna have, if you
have a blog site where it's just always

119
00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:25.426
consistent everywhere, then you're
fine just using your h1, h2, h3.

120
00:07:25.426 --> 00:07:29.032
Another thing that you might
see people do is h1, h1 so

121
00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:33.864
you could use an h1 selector or an h1
class if it's an h2 that needs to look

122
00:07:33.864 --> 00:07:38.648
like an h1 this is really popular, or
you could this could also be title.

123
00:07:38.648 --> 00:07:40.952
There's other ways of doing it,

124
00:07:40.952 --> 00:07:45.890
primary-title could be another one,
there's so many different ways

125
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:50.596
of doing this primary that it really
depends on how you like to work.

126
00:07:50.596 --> 00:07:54.644
I am of the mind where I tend not to want
to use the semantic selectors at all,

127
00:07:54.644 --> 00:07:58.501
just because then people,
especially if it's not a solo project, and

128
00:07:58.501 --> 00:08:03.029
other people are touching the code, you're
just enabling them to make a mistake.

129
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:06.703
So by not having any styles
associated with the semantics of it,

130
00:08:06.703 --> 00:08:10.867
it's a nice way to strip away that
potential problem that could come up.

131
00:08:10.867 --> 00:08:14.435
So the only other one here that I think
does deserve some styling are just

132
00:08:14.435 --> 00:08:15.335
the link colors.

133
00:08:15.335 --> 00:08:19.826
We don't really have any links in this
project outside of the navigation.

134
00:08:19.826 --> 00:08:21.840
So we don't have a lot to go on, but

135
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.667
just setting them up as a basic one
like this could go really well.

136
00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:28.553
But I do wanna highlight one thing in
there that you might not have seen before,

137
00:08:28.553 --> 00:08:29.485
which is focus visible.

138
00:08:29.485 --> 00:08:33.124
So if we come in here, and as I said,
we'll come back to the section and

139
00:08:33.124 --> 00:08:34.976
the heading things in a little bit,

140
00:08:34.976 --> 00:08:39.027
maybe I'll even take I'll leave this
one just because it looks a bit better.

141
00:08:39.027 --> 00:08:41.230
But we'll revisit that,
but with your link,

142
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.896
you can obviously come in
with whatever color you want.

143
00:08:43.896 --> 00:08:49.247
So in this case, it could even be a color
inherit in I think it's the high contrast,

144
00:08:49.247 --> 00:08:52.697
though, so
we'll do the high contrast for that one.

145
00:08:52.697 --> 00:08:57.406
And then I had an a hover, and
then a usually you would see something

146
00:08:57.406 --> 00:09:00.700
like this where you'd
be doing a focus state.

147
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.654
Focus is the old way of doing things,
it's when you're keyboard navigating.

148
00:09:04.654 --> 00:09:07.500
So let's just say the color here is red,
now, just so

149
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.789
we can actually see this in action,
if I tab over, the color of

150
00:09:10.789 --> 00:09:14.686
it changes because it's gained focus
while I'm tabbing on something.

151
00:09:14.686 --> 00:09:18.604
The default in all the browsers for
every element that was using focus is now.

152
00:09:18.604 --> 00:09:24.495
Focus-visible, which on a link
will work exactly the same way and

153
00:09:24.495 --> 00:09:27.662
won't actually change anything.

154
00:09:27.662 --> 00:09:31.529
The difference here is if you have
a button and we're gonna have a button

155
00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:35.987
eventually, so we'll delete this in a bit,
but I'm just gonna do it to show you.

156
00:09:35.987 --> 00:09:41.656
Hello there, if ever you have a button,
and let's just change this for

157
00:09:41.656 --> 00:09:46.677
now to button, just to highlight
what focus visible is doing.

158
00:09:46.677 --> 00:09:51.291
If I click on this,
when I'm hovering on top of it, whoops,

159
00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:56.729
let's change this to focus first,
and we'll do that as a background.

160
00:09:56.729 --> 00:09:58.155
Just to make it easy to see.

161
00:09:58.155 --> 00:10:01.549
If I click on it and
then move my mouse away, it's gained focus

162
00:10:01.549 --> 00:10:05.751
because when you click on something
that's interactive, it gains focus.

163
00:10:05.751 --> 00:10:08.832
Usually, when you click on a button,
something happens and you don't want it to

164
00:10:08.832 --> 00:10:11.753
keep that like the navigation opens or
something over here does something.

165
00:10:11.753 --> 00:10:16.484
You don't wanna users staring at this
button that has changed focus states so

166
00:10:16.484 --> 00:10:20.656
focus-visible prevents that
from happening, focus-visible.

167
00:10:20.656 --> 00:10:24.341
If I click on my button when I leave,
it's acting only as a hover,

168
00:10:24.341 --> 00:10:26.627
as long as I'm doing that with my mouse.

169
00:10:26.627 --> 00:10:27.941
If I keyboard navigate to it,

170
00:10:27.941 --> 00:10:31.253
when it gains focus, it's showing
because if your keyboard navigating,

171
00:10:31.253 --> 00:10:34.635
you need to be able to see what the users
actually highlighted or done there.

172
00:10:34.635 --> 00:10:38.960
So the basic rule is focused-visible
the browser, we'll figure it out based on

173
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.594
what the type of element it is and
how the users interacting with it.

174
00:10:42.594 --> 00:10:46.336
Whereas, if you just use focus, that state
will always get applied no matter what.

175
00:10:46.336 --> 00:10:50.871
So in general, focus-visibles probably
what you want to actually use there.

176
00:10:50.871 --> 00:10:57.738
So I'm gonna switch these both back to
being a, and then just do the color.

177
00:10:57.738 --> 00:11:02.051
And this case,
it was the brand-light on there for

178
00:11:02.051 --> 00:11:05.875
the hover state on those, and that's good.

179
00:11:05.875 --> 00:11:11.254
Then the underline and other things we'll
tackle once we get to the navigation,

180
00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:16.000
cuz I think in general you wanna leave
the underline on your links to make

181
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.261
sure people know that
they're actually links.
