00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.254
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: All right, so
we have our reset in place.

2
00:00:02.254 --> 00:00:05.733
One thing, though, that we wanna think
about a little bit, we're gonna be talking

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.492
about project maintenance,
one way we can do that is with layers.

4
00:00:08.492 --> 00:00:12.695
So layers is a relatively new feature
in CSS, but it's full baseline now, and

5
00:00:12.695 --> 00:00:15.752
it's something we're gonna
be seeing a lot more of, and

6
00:00:15.752 --> 00:00:17.681
I wanna explore it in this project.

7
00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:22.504
So we can use a layer to sort
of encapsulate our reset.

8
00:00:22.504 --> 00:00:26.802
And I'll, as we go through everything,
we'll explore the benefits of what layers

9
00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:29.113
can do but
I will show a really quick example.

10
00:00:29.113 --> 00:00:30.778
Whereas, if we come in here and

11
00:00:30.778 --> 00:00:33.917
it's really easy to do a layer
just at the top of your code,

12
00:00:33.917 --> 00:00:37.784
you can do an at layer, and then you
just give it whatever name you want.

13
00:00:37.784 --> 00:00:39.894
So I think reset makes sense here.

14
00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:45.512
Open enclosed parentheses,
we can grab everything that's there and

15
00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:48.569
just move it right inside that layer.

16
00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:49.857
Nothing really changes.

17
00:00:49.857 --> 00:00:51.822
The reset will work.

18
00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:56.476
It hasn't impacted anything but what the
cascade layers are doing is the same way

19
00:00:56.476 --> 00:01:00.319
that we have layers within our CSS and
within the cascade, right?

20
00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:03.947
That would go from like, the user agent
styles, the author styles, or, sorry,

21
00:01:03.947 --> 00:01:05.851
the user styles, and then our own styles.

22
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:10.252
This adds layers within our own CSS file.

23
00:01:10.252 --> 00:01:13.048
The advantage of that is,
say, this role of list,

24
00:01:13.048 --> 00:01:16.962
this has higher specificity on it
because it's a attribute selector.

25
00:01:16.962 --> 00:01:20.105
Attribute selector is
the same as a class selector.

26
00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:24.309
So if I did come into my HTML here,
and let's just come after here, or

27
00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:29.036
we have a list on our page already,
sorry, we have our nav there, or this ul.

28
00:01:29.036 --> 00:01:33.572
So this is saying anything with a role of
list, and this won't be the best example.

29
00:01:33.572 --> 00:01:37.983
But what I'm gonna do is just come here
and say the color should also be red so

30
00:01:37.983 --> 00:01:40.240
we can see it, and we can come on here.

31
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.189
And on that ul,
I can add a role is equal to list, and

32
00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.577
we want to get rid of that and
say list is here.

33
00:01:49.577 --> 00:01:55.076
And then we'll add a list item that we
can see that's not a link low there,

34
00:01:55.076 --> 00:01:56.951
so it will come in as red.

35
00:01:56.951 --> 00:02:00.934
And we'll also pump up the font size so

36
00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:06.296
it's a bit easier to see,
font size will be 2rem.

37
00:02:06.296 --> 00:02:11.079
So you can see the hello there is red, cuz
it's getting the color coming from this.On

38
00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:14.087
an attribute selector,
again higher specificity.

39
00:02:14.087 --> 00:02:18.821
If I come down, all the way down
outside of, actually this come up here.

40
00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:24.305
Another thing with layers is that then
you can collapse the entire layer so

41
00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:29.442
you can just hide your reset away
after and it doesn't get in the way.

42
00:02:29.442 --> 00:02:32.749
I could come here and
do an out layer of base, and

43
00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.658
I could say that my ul
has a color of green.

44
00:02:35.658 --> 00:02:39.502
And even though this is just
a regular element selector,

45
00:02:39.502 --> 00:02:43.355
it's Overwriting the attribute
selector from before.

46
00:02:43.355 --> 00:02:45.883
And the reason it's doing that is
because this layer comes second.

47
00:02:45.883 --> 00:02:49.877
So just CSS,
things that come after have more they win.

48
00:02:49.877 --> 00:02:54.784
In this case, this layer is coming after,
so this layer is winning.

49
00:02:54.784 --> 00:02:59.029
So it just makes a way that we can
run into less specificity issues.

50
00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:00.927
But again,
you want to plan things out properly.

51
00:03:00.927 --> 00:03:04.798
Properly, because this could also become
something where you have a change you're

52
00:03:04.798 --> 00:03:07.534
trying to make with an ID selector,
and it's not working.

53
00:03:07.534 --> 00:03:10.664
And you don't understand why, and it's
just because you have something in a layer

54
00:03:10.664 --> 00:03:13.135
down below that's an element
selector that's overwriting it.

55
00:03:13.135 --> 00:03:14.973
So you do want to be a little bit careful,
but

56
00:03:14.973 --> 00:03:17.211
I do think that they're
really worth exploring, and

57
00:03:17.211 --> 00:03:20.665
if you organize your layers in a logical
way, then they can be really beneficial.

58
00:03:20.665 --> 00:03:24.212
Because all of a sudden you are less
stressed about coming up with what was

59
00:03:24.212 --> 00:03:25.967
the specificity of this selector.

60
00:03:25.967 --> 00:03:29.570
Maybe now I can use this selector
where there were problems before, and

61
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.439
things like that.

62
00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:33.290
So, obviously we don't
wanna change our colors.

63
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.842
So, I'm gonna take that out and I will
take this out, and I will take that out.

64
00:03:40.842 --> 00:03:43.882
But yeah,
that sets us up nicely with our reset.

65
00:03:43.882 --> 00:03:47.132
And again, you can collapse that down,
so you know where to poke your way

66
00:03:47.132 --> 00:03:50.561
into there unless you need to get in
there, which makes life a bit easier to.

67
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:54.782
One other option that you can do as well
is you can decide what all your layers

68
00:03:54.782 --> 00:03:58.199
are without putting any code in them,
by doing an @layer and

69
00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:01.282
then just doing a comma
separated list of your layers.

70
00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:05.548
So, you could say reset, base, layout,

71
00:04:05.548 --> 00:04:10.535
components, and
have as many layers as you want.

72
00:04:10.535 --> 00:04:13.710
This is what's setting
the order of the importance.

73
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.342
And then you can have them down
here in any order you want.

74
00:04:16.342 --> 00:04:18.158
The order down here
doesn't matter anymore.

75
00:04:18.158 --> 00:04:21.395
It's this order at the top
that's Setting things up.

76
00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:22.773
So it can be really handy.

77
00:04:22.773 --> 00:04:26.869
You set up the stage, you know the order
of things, and then I like keeping

78
00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:30.921
them here in order, cuz it makes my
life easier to know where things are.

79
00:04:30.921 --> 00:04:33.287
But if ever you have some
weird stuff going on, or

80
00:04:33.287 --> 00:04:36.366
you need to have a different layer
down below, you can do that.

81
00:04:36.366 --> 00:04:40.217
Cuz you could also, this doesn't make
sense, but you could have a reset.

82
00:04:40.217 --> 00:04:43.796
Here as well, and
have code here and code here, but

83
00:04:43.796 --> 00:04:48.796
my base layer would still win,
because the reset comes after the base or

84
00:04:48.796 --> 00:04:52.321
before the base, so
the base is always gonna win.

85
00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:53.821
I wouldn't again, it gets complicated.

86
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:54.731
It gets weird doing this.

87
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:56.893
I wouldn't really recommend it but

88
00:04:56.893 --> 00:04:59.707
just want to say a little
bit on how that works.

89
00:04:59.707 --> 00:05:01.137
There's also sublayers.

90
00:05:01.137 --> 00:05:04.984
I'll talk about that more once
we've built out the project more.

91
00:05:04.984 --> 00:05:07.468
It's not something I think we need
on a project of this scale, but

92
00:05:07.468 --> 00:05:08.925
you can have layers inside of layers.

93
00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:13.204
But again, then you start running into
like the complexity of the whole thing.

94
00:05:13.204 --> 00:05:15.920
If you have a good grasp and
a good organization,

95
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.364
the sublayers could be useful,
but on a project of this size,

96
00:05:19.364 --> 00:05:22.230
I don't think there's
a huge Which benefit to it.

97
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.785
I'm not gonna have the declared one at
the top, just because I want to force

98
00:05:25.785 --> 00:05:28.503
myself to have them in a bit of
a logical order on the page.

99
00:05:28.503 --> 00:05:29.855
I think it's a bit easier, but

100
00:05:29.855 --> 00:05:33.452
it's a really common practice to declare
the order of them at the top of your file.

101
00:05:33.452 --> 00:05:36.043
So if you wanna leave that there,
you can do that, and

102
00:05:36.043 --> 00:05:39.911
we'll talk more about what layers are and
what they aren't as we go through it.

103
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:43.992
As well, just cuz there's certain things
you definitely don't wanna use layers for,

104
00:05:43.992 --> 00:05:46.819
even though it's sort of
people's first instinct to do so.

105
00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:49.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Can you explain the
difference with specificity inheritance?

106
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.120
I'm sure layers isn't inheritance.

107
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.805
It's more specificity, right?

108
00:05:54.805 --> 00:05:55.858
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Yeah, okay, so yeah,

109
00:05:55.858 --> 00:05:59.145
it's a really good question actually
because inheritance is a big part.

110
00:05:59.145 --> 00:06:03.456
Layers yes, okay,
the difference between specificity and

111
00:06:03.456 --> 00:06:06.170
inheritance with in terms of layers.

112
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.597
Layers won't impact inheritance, just
because, if something's being inherited,

113
00:06:10.597 --> 00:06:13.605
it's like, and
the big thing there is your color, right?

114
00:06:13.605 --> 00:06:17.407
If we come out here and

115
00:06:17.407 --> 00:06:22.907
they say body is color purple.

116
00:06:22.907 --> 00:06:24.493
Purple, when I do that,

117
00:06:24.493 --> 00:06:29.112
most of the text changes to purple
because it's inheriting that color.

118
00:06:29.112 --> 00:06:32.129
But my links aren't getting it,
my links are still blue, or

119
00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:34.925
maybe we'll make it green,
just so it stands out more.

120
00:06:34.925 --> 00:06:39.465
The links are still a blue color because
those have another style that's actually

121
00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:41.647
applied directly exactly on the link.

122
00:06:41.647 --> 00:06:43.525
So as long as it's being like, yeah,

123
00:06:43.525 --> 00:06:46.894
the layers won't have any impact
on the inheritance of something.

124
00:06:46.894 --> 00:06:50.677
Because they're just inheriting it from
wherever that color is coming from,

125
00:06:50.677 --> 00:06:52.640
no matter what the specificity of it is.

126
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.278
And then if you were to change
the color of the links,

127
00:06:56.278 --> 00:07:00.426
like, say, in our reset,
we change we could have a COVID.

128
00:07:00.426 --> 00:07:04.954
Color is green, and they'll become green.

129
00:07:04.954 --> 00:07:08.662
And then I could even
come down then here and

130
00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:14.551
say that my A color is yellow,
which we won't really be able to see.

131
00:07:14.551 --> 00:07:16.381
ut we can see they sort of disappear,

132
00:07:16.381 --> 00:07:19.517
just because this is overriding
the style that was in my reset.

133
00:07:19.517 --> 00:07:24.011
So we've broken out of having
inheritance with those and

134
00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:27.667
it's just about specificity
in those cases.
