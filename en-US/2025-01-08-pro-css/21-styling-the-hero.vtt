00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.695
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Up until now,
we've been doing a lot of utility classes,

2
00:00:02.695 --> 00:00:05.885
a lot of very generic things that
we're able to reuse over and over and

3
00:00:05.885 --> 00:00:07.813
over again in as many places as possible.

4
00:00:07.813 --> 00:00:09.244
Eventually you run out of those.

5
00:00:09.244 --> 00:00:13.432
[LAUGH] You get to some more unique areas,
where you have background images, or

6
00:00:13.432 --> 00:00:17.494
where you have just unique font sizes,
or other things that are happening,

7
00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:18.844
like we do with our hero.

8
00:00:18.844 --> 00:00:22.525
And those things just need to be styled,
there's not a lot you can do about that.

9
00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:26.400
And that's why I like utility classes,
I like reusable classes, and

10
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.026
at one point you sort of hit that
limit of how far you can push them.

11
00:00:30.026 --> 00:00:34.438
For our hero, we could use a mix
of utility classes and not, and

12
00:00:34.438 --> 00:00:38.197
I sort of did that a little bit already,
not too much.

13
00:00:38.197 --> 00:00:41.709
But I'm just gonna go look at,
I have my hero flow section, so

14
00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:45.309
I could come on here because my
hero should always be centered.

15
00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.497
So I could say this is also text center,
and

16
00:00:48.497 --> 00:00:52.408
then I could also say that
it's text high contrast.

17
00:00:52.408 --> 00:00:54.634
And then maybe there's something
else I could throw on there as well,

18
00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:55.853
the font size needs to change as well.

19
00:00:55.853 --> 00:01:00.022
So then I'd say, okay, this also needs
font-size, I think it's the md one that we

20
00:01:00.022 --> 00:01:02.990
need on there, and
it increases the font size that we need.

21
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.886
And this is where I start looking at that,
going, ugh, that's a lot.

22
00:01:06.886 --> 00:01:12.987
And I still need this hero class on here
to be able to add the background image and

23
00:01:12.987 --> 00:01:16.331
potentially do a few other little tweaks.

24
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:19.957
When I have that, and I still, first of
all, I'm hitting so many utility classes.

25
00:01:19.957 --> 00:01:23.784
It just makes me feel like, okay, maybe
this shouldn't just be utility classes,

26
00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:25.436
maybe it's time to create a class.

27
00:01:25.436 --> 00:01:30.212
And that just compounds even more when I
know I need to have a unique class to add

28
00:01:30.212 --> 00:01:34.345
some unique styling to it that I
can't do with my utility classes.

29
00:01:34.345 --> 00:01:38.973
So as much as possible,
I'll leave a couple of them on there, and

30
00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:41.257
this is really just decisions.

31
00:01:41.257 --> 00:01:45.200
I don't wanna recreate flow and I don't
wanna have to recreate my section spacing,

32
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.932
cuz those work and
they're exactly what I need them to be.

33
00:01:47.932 --> 00:01:52.587
But what I don't want is, all those other
things, it's easy enough to include in

34
00:01:52.587 --> 00:01:55.703
a single selector, and
it just means less confusion.

35
00:01:55.703 --> 00:01:57.903
If I'm needing to make a change,
I look here and

36
00:01:57.903 --> 00:02:01.203
I go, there's no text alignment or
no font sizes or other things,

37
00:02:01.203 --> 00:02:03.745
I know that that's just gonna
be on the hero selector.

38
00:02:03.745 --> 00:02:07.120
This is just finding that balance
that you find works for you.

39
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.108
I don't have much else to say on that one.

40
00:02:10.108 --> 00:02:12.968
The one thing I will do here,
we didn't do it yet, so

41
00:02:12.968 --> 00:02:16.088
I'm gonna add a span around
the word Mushroom Foraging,

42
00:02:16.088 --> 00:02:19.807
cuz that does need a different font
size and a different font color.

43
00:02:19.807 --> 00:02:24.432
And again, I could 100% do that
with just utility classes and

44
00:02:24.432 --> 00:02:30.233
it would work fine, but because I'm doing
this hero and it's unique to the hero or

45
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:35.054
unique to the h1, I'm going to
just combine all of this together.

46
00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:39.524
Cuz I'm going into component mode rather
than utility class mode, so my h1,

47
00:02:39.524 --> 00:02:44.416
if you wanted something more generic, site
title, something like that could work.

48
00:02:44.416 --> 00:02:47.702
I'm in my hero, I don't know,
I went back and forth on this, honestly,

49
00:02:47.702 --> 00:02:48.552
on what to call it.

50
00:02:48.552 --> 00:02:52.248
I'm just sort of partial to like
this title is specific to this area

51
00:02:52.248 --> 00:02:53.906
that's on this background.

52
00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:57.013
So it's really specific to
being in the hero area, so

53
00:02:57.013 --> 00:03:01.170
I'm going with the BEM style,
this is a title that belongs in the hero.

54
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.132
If you'd prefer just the h1,
if you'd prefer doing site title or

55
00:03:05.132 --> 00:03:08.740
having a generic one, like we did for
these section titles,

56
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.155
it's really up to you, and
what would work best for you.

57
00:03:12.155 --> 00:03:16.597
So we can come up to here ,we'd want
to go, it's definitely not base,

58
00:03:16.597 --> 00:03:20.093
not really layout,
because it's not layout related.

59
00:03:20.093 --> 00:03:24.573
It's very specific to one thing,
so I go into my components and

60
00:03:24.573 --> 00:03:26.273
I can create my .hero.

61
00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:32.865
First, you do the simple ones,
text-align center, nice.

62
00:03:32.865 --> 00:03:35.262
The font size here, as much as possible,

63
00:03:35.262 --> 00:03:39.793
I like relying on inheritance instead
of selecting the paragraphs, if I can.

64
00:03:39.793 --> 00:03:43.341
So I'll do the font-size here, and

65
00:03:43.341 --> 00:03:48.270
that can use the custom
property font-size-md.

66
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.455
Some of this I am remembering
just off the top of my head, but

67
00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:54.725
there's no harm if you go in
the Figma file and you look at it.

68
00:03:54.725 --> 00:03:58.393
You can get the information on what the
font sizes are in the panel on the side,

69
00:03:58.393 --> 00:04:01.005
so I do apologize that I'm
not always referencing it.

70
00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:03.673
But just coming in here,
checking the sidebar,

71
00:04:03.673 --> 00:04:05.632
which is really small on my screen.

72
00:04:05.632 --> 00:04:09.250
But you'll be able to get it and see
the specific sizes that are being used,

73
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.154
because the names I used are very similar
from the Figma file for the font sizes and

74
00:04:13.154 --> 00:04:14.373
the custom properties.

75
00:04:14.373 --> 00:04:19.556
So the font size should go up a little
bit, the color was my high-contrast.

76
00:04:19.556 --> 00:04:21.523
And this is a nice thing if you're using,

77
00:04:21.523 --> 00:04:25.083
like I named my utility classes the same
that I named my custom properties.

78
00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:28.944
The advantage with that is whether you're
doing it through a quick utility class or

79
00:04:28.944 --> 00:04:32.086
if you're doing it through the use
of just writing styles this way,

80
00:04:32.086 --> 00:04:34.624
there's no confusion about
what you're calling it,

81
00:04:34.624 --> 00:04:36.858
cuz you're using the same
name in both places.

82
00:04:36.858 --> 00:04:40.660
So if you need the high contrast text,
whether it's going to be through a custom

83
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.548
property or just through the utility
class, you'll remember what the name is.

84
00:04:44.548 --> 00:04:48.214
So that should make the text white instead
of the the other color that we had.

85
00:04:48.214 --> 00:04:51.917
We need a background image.

86
00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:55.591
People often ask me, what order do
I like putting my properties in?

87
00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:58.802
I do have a bit of an idea in my head,
but I usually just try and

88
00:04:58.802 --> 00:05:02.553
remember the things I need to put
on there, and I start putting them.

89
00:05:02.553 --> 00:05:04.646
I think that's one hero.

90
00:05:04.646 --> 00:05:09.773
You might get this where we
can see the image is repeating

91
00:05:09.773 --> 00:05:14.474
itself a little bit,
background-size is cover.

92
00:05:14.474 --> 00:05:19.938
You don't need to necessarily do this,
but background-position,

93
00:05:19.938 --> 00:05:25.041
center, just so it's always based
on the middle of the picture.

94
00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:28.134
People ask me sometimes about getting
a specific area of the image and

95
00:05:28.134 --> 00:05:31.239
where it's cropping and
everything when it's a background image.

96
00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:33.309
If it's a background image,
it should be decorational.

97
00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:36.900
The text is what's important if,
hopefully, you don't have a client that's

98
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.652
saying, I need this one specific thing
visible cuz positioning background images

99
00:05:40.652 --> 00:05:43.723
in very specific places isn't
the easiest thing to do in the world.

100
00:05:43.723 --> 00:05:44.411
There we go,

101
00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:48.117
we get that coming together, we just
need to fix up the title of it now.

102
00:05:48.117 --> 00:05:50.694
So we can come here, hero__title,

103
00:05:50.694 --> 00:05:55.283
or however you decided to come up
with your class name for there, and

104
00:05:55.283 --> 00:06:00.781
the font-size was my font-size-heading-lg,
so it should get a bit bigger.

105
00:06:00.781 --> 00:06:03.222
I might have had something
on there already,

106
00:06:03.222 --> 00:06:07.069
I had the h1 selector I think higher up
that I put, so that was coming through.

107
00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:09.769
You could either have the span
on the beginning of it, and

108
00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:12.301
that's setting the smaller
size that's white, and

109
00:06:12.301 --> 00:06:16.148
then the span over here, that's the larger
font size in orange, or vice versa.

110
00:06:16.148 --> 00:06:19.468
It really doesn't matter
which way around you do it.

111
00:06:19.468 --> 00:06:25.278
I always tend to do the first
thing I see as the main part,

112
00:06:25.278 --> 00:06:32.587
and then I can say my span that's
inside of there is the font-size xl.

113
00:06:32.587 --> 00:06:36.263
And again, this is why I like
using custom properties with

114
00:06:36.263 --> 00:06:40.613
really clear names that I remember,
cuz I know it's my extra large,

115
00:06:40.613 --> 00:06:44.454
I just put xl, and I get the list,
and choose the heading xl.

116
00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:50.694
And the color was my brand,
text-brand, and that comes in,

117
00:06:50.694 --> 00:06:56.454
and because of the way the custom
properties were set up,

118
00:06:56.454 --> 00:07:01.385
so if we go take a look back
at those in in our base.

119
00:07:01.385 --> 00:07:06.227
It mentioned that the 900 and
the 1000 were set to the same size,

120
00:07:06.227 --> 00:07:09.385
then, here I was making
them separate sizes.

121
00:07:09.385 --> 00:07:14.260
So the reason that I did that was just so
we get this happening, where it's smaller

122
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:19.433
sizes, it looks like that, and then this
becomes larger when we're at bigger sizes.

123
00:07:19.433 --> 00:07:24.273
One last problem is this looks really ugly
when the word of is sticking over here,

124
00:07:24.273 --> 00:07:27.630
just cuz of the difference in font size,
it is not nice.

125
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:32.878
So the easiest way to fix that, and
this is a really common thing that I do,

126
00:07:32.878 --> 00:07:38.316
is when you have something like this
that's making these types of changes.

127
00:07:38.316 --> 00:07:41.788
I also come in with a display of block,
and

128
00:07:41.788 --> 00:07:46.660
that way you just force it to
be on its own line all the time.

129
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.346
If you do this, do some testing,

130
00:07:48.346 --> 00:07:51.497
cuz sometimes it can lead to
some really awkward line breaks.

131
00:07:51.497 --> 00:07:55.920
But in this case, and
especially with the pretty the text wrap

132
00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.788
balanced on the heading,
I think it's helping us out a little bit.

133
00:08:00.788 --> 00:08:05.131
So if you're using Safar or Firefox, you
might be seeing it a little bit different.

134
00:08:05.131 --> 00:08:07.777
The balance should actually
work in all the browsers,

135
00:08:07.777 --> 00:08:09.396
it's the pretty that doesn't.

136
00:08:09.396 --> 00:08:14.984
So, yeah, the balance just helps us out
a little bit with the look of that,

137
00:08:14.984 --> 00:08:20.153
and then we get a nice hero area
that's coming together pretty well.
