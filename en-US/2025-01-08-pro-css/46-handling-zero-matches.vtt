00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.141
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Now there's
one thing that we don't see

2
00:00:06.141 --> 00:00:13.193
right now because my
screen is a little small.

3
00:00:13.193 --> 00:00:15.877
But if we were to go full screen
with this, that we might notice,

4
00:00:15.877 --> 00:00:18.461
I used the autofit no, it's good,
sorry that if we go here and

5
00:00:18.461 --> 00:00:21.677
I choose that I want the summer, that
my one card is stretching super large.

6
00:00:21.677 --> 00:00:24.900
Or if I do the spring same thing,
the cards are really big.

7
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.735
And this is because of some advice I
gave you, saying that Auto-fit is what

8
00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:33.898
you always want, and
Auto-fit is almost always what you want.

9
00:00:33.898 --> 00:00:37.689
It's definitely what I use
90 to 95% of the time.

10
00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:43.134
But in a situation like this, where you
potentially could have less content in it.

11
00:00:43.134 --> 00:00:47.272
If there's less content, that content,
it won't make empty grid cells.

12
00:00:47.272 --> 00:00:50.581
It's just gonna make those cells take
up as much space as they can take up.

13
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:52.768
That's the Auto-fit.

14
00:00:52.768 --> 00:00:56.096
If instead of doing that,

15
00:00:56.096 --> 00:01:00.494
we actually go to our styles here.

16
00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:03.089
And we'll find that Auto-fit.

17
00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.248
If I change this from Auto-fit
to Auto-fill instead.

18
00:01:08.248 --> 00:01:09.708
Let me go full screen again.

19
00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:14.470
When we don't have a lot of items, it
just creates empty cells instead of that

20
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.857
are fitting in that same way
that it would work before.

21
00:01:17.857 --> 00:01:20.210
So if you have all of them, it works, and

22
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.858
you have all the grids
like you would expect.

23
00:01:22.858 --> 00:01:25.700
But then when you do come down
to having less than four, and

24
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.470
you won't see this impact unless there's
less than four or less than three,

25
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.910
depending on how you have
how wide your screen is.

26
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.523
But then you'll end up with
the empty spaces here.

27
00:01:34.523 --> 00:01:37.064
This depends on what you
prefer in this situation.

28
00:01:37.064 --> 00:01:40.620
It's one of those rare ones where
I do feel like Auto-fill is

29
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.231
the actual better option.

30
00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:45.038
So if you are gonna change it here,
I would come here and

31
00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:48.103
also change the name of it just so
it matches the two of them.

32
00:01:48.103 --> 00:01:51.687
If you don't mind the card stretching and
you think you prefer that layout,

33
00:01:51.687 --> 00:01:53.200
then stay with the Auto-fill.

34
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.450
But I thought this is a nice example
of when Auto-fill actually does come

35
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.045
in in handy.

36
00:01:57.045 --> 00:01:59.356
And just if you do run
into that one situation,

37
00:01:59.356 --> 00:02:02.736
knowing that the alternative one is
there and that you can have one or

38
00:02:02.736 --> 00:02:06.730
the other depending on the type of content
you have, and with dynamic content.

39
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.495
I would say this is the one time often
where Auto-fit makes more sense,

40
00:02:10.495 --> 00:02:13.759
whereas if you have set content,
that's just not changing,

41
00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:17.233
most of the time, I find like
Auto-fill is the one that I lean on.

42
00:02:17.233 --> 00:02:21.489
If I change it all there, of course,
I also have to come in my HTML and

43
00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.654
I need to change this to
great Auto-fill as well.

44
00:02:24.654 --> 00:02:28.990
It could be useful to keep the Auto-fit,
duplicate it and have an Auto-fill and

45
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.559
an Auto-fit, then you can use the one
you need in any situation and

46
00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:34.495
just have it there waiting for you.

47
00:02:34.495 --> 00:02:37.863
But I would just leave it like this,
because we don't need it, and

48
00:02:37.863 --> 00:02:40.991
having unneeded CSS is one way
to blow file unnecessarily, so

49
00:02:40.991 --> 00:02:43.537
we'll keep it with what we need for
this project.

50
00:02:43.537 --> 00:02:46.372
But just know that you have those
two options if you need them.

51
00:02:46.372 --> 00:02:50.960
&gt;&gt; Student: Why do you use the hidden
instead of visibility hidden?

52
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.642
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: If I remember right,
let's just do it here really fast.

53
00:02:54.642 --> 00:02:57.881
So yeah, visibility hidden.

54
00:02:57.881 --> 00:02:59.876
Let's do it on my card.

55
00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:00.892
Its all of them.

56
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:08.621
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: .Card, visibility,
hidden with visibility hidden,

57
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:14.582
the problem is it does hide them,
it takes them away visually,

58
00:03:14.582 --> 00:03:18.751
but they still take up
room in the document.

59
00:03:18.751 --> 00:03:22.958
So it I don't have a lot of good there
are times where visibility hidden

60
00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:26.524
can be useful if you need
especially if it's something that

61
00:03:26.524 --> 00:03:28.757
needs that space to come in or out of.

62
00:03:28.757 --> 00:03:35.052
But because it reserves the space for
it, even while it's not there.

63
00:03:35.052 --> 00:03:37.799
And the hidden attribute, again,
all it's doing is a display, none.

64
00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.747
So we're just literally removing it.

65
00:03:39.747 --> 00:03:44.483
So also from an accessibility point of
view, if somebody were to filter it.

66
00:03:44.483 --> 00:03:47.283
Actually, I think the visibility
affects the accessibility tree too, but

67
00:03:47.283 --> 00:03:48.343
I'd have to look into that.

68
00:03:48.343 --> 00:03:50.591
But, yeah, that's the main thing.

69
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:54.349
If you need to reserve the space for it,
visibility hidden, if not displayed on or

70
00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:55.447
the hidden attribute.

71
00:03:55.447 --> 00:03:57.665
Whenever you have filters like this,

72
00:03:57.665 --> 00:04:01.490
you'll definitely run into
situations where nothing matches.

73
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.530
There we go, so in the spring,
nothing is edible, and

74
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.976
this is one of the drawbacks of the CSS
only solution, because if this happens.

75
00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:13.466
What are you gonna do to tell like it's
just weird that there's nothing there you

76
00:04:13.466 --> 00:04:16.584
it feels broken more than it
feels like something else.

77
00:04:16.584 --> 00:04:22.109
So in a situation like this, I find it
useful to come in just with a very quick,

78
00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.600
and I'm just gonna copy
it from the lesson here.

79
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.939
But just having a div or a paragraph or

80
00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:32.333
something that's saying that
there's no matches for that filter.

81
00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:34.194
And you can include that.

82
00:04:34.194 --> 00:04:37.806
I'm just gonna put it at the bottom,
all the way down.

83
00:04:37.806 --> 00:04:39.753
I should have collapsed my cards.

84
00:04:39.753 --> 00:04:43.917
It's a really long code block cuz
we have a lot of cards there.

85
00:04:46.771 --> 00:04:49.002
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: I can see it at the top,
that's my Auto-fill.

86
00:04:49.002 --> 00:04:53.459
So right after that auto fill probably,
I can put this in where it's saying

87
00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:57.991
no-matches for these filters, and
I'm including the hidden attribute on

88
00:04:57.991 --> 00:05:02.338
there to start with cuz I don't want
that to show up as a default, right?

89
00:05:02.338 --> 00:05:06.399
If I don't include that here down all
the way at the bottom of my filter here,

90
00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:07.801
I'd have the no matches.

91
00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:09.265
So it's putting the hidden on there.

92
00:05:09.265 --> 00:05:11.926
It gets a display none, and it's gone.

93
00:05:11.926 --> 00:05:15.944
And then what we want to do is,
if the user comes through and

94
00:05:15.944 --> 00:05:21.201
they get spring edible, we can show
that when they run into this situation.

95
00:05:21.201 --> 00:05:22.091
So to be able to do that,

96
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:24.285
we wanna jump back over to our
mushroom filter right here.

97
00:05:24.285 --> 00:05:26.646
And the first thing we want
to do is we do need to find,

98
00:05:26.646 --> 00:05:28.172
we need to be able to toggle that.

99
00:05:28.172 --> 00:05:33.625
So all the way at the top here,
we can come and say that we have the cons

100
00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:39.558
of we'll call it no results message
something very clear that we can do and

101
00:05:39.558 --> 00:05:43.117
use query selector once
again to find that.

102
00:05:43.117 --> 00:05:45.518
In this case,
I just had the class on there.

103
00:05:45.518 --> 00:05:47.572
If you have an ID or
something else, you can select it.

104
00:05:47.572 --> 00:05:50.849
If we take a look,
we have the class of new matches.

105
00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:54.460
So, I can know matches right there.

106
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.526
Now there's different ways
that you could approach this.

107
00:05:58.526 --> 00:06:02.463
But for me, the easiest way to do it is
one summary goes through the filter here.

108
00:06:02.463 --> 00:06:04.450
We wanna check if anything matches.

109
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.698
So in our filter cards here what we
could do is we could come in and

110
00:06:09.698 --> 00:06:14.651
say, we can get that let has
VisibleCards is actually gonna

111
00:06:14.651 --> 00:06:17.344
be equal to false to start with.

112
00:06:17.344 --> 00:06:22.197
As a starting point just cuz it's
gonna make it a little bit easier

113
00:06:22.197 --> 00:06:24.676
than toggling it in another way.

114
00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:27.068
And then what we can do is,
when we get this,

115
00:06:27.068 --> 00:06:31.556
where all of these things are matching,
so we're saying it's false by default.

116
00:06:31.556 --> 00:06:36.904
But then in this situation,
where we actually do have matches, so

117
00:06:36.904 --> 00:06:43.598
we're showing our card, we could then say
that has visible cards is equal to true.

118
00:06:43.598 --> 00:06:47.524
So if we do that, and
let's try that again, spring and edible.

119
00:06:47.524 --> 00:06:52.637
So now let's come here really fast,
and just at the end here

120
00:06:52.637 --> 00:06:57.754
we can just console log that
console log has visible cards,

121
00:06:57.754 --> 00:07:03.406
and we should be able to check,
inspect, go over to our console.

122
00:07:03.406 --> 00:07:07.652
And when we switch Spring,
we can see the true is coming in.

123
00:07:07.652 --> 00:07:09.397
There's 11 visible cards coming right now.

124
00:07:09.397 --> 00:07:11.400
So it's giving us how many we have.

125
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.839
So let's go to Edible now.

126
00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:15.949
And we're getting false for all of them.

127
00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:18.082
Whereas before,
we were getting one false in all of them..

128
00:07:18.082 --> 00:07:21.205
But now all of the cards
are returning false here.

129
00:07:21.205 --> 00:07:27.311
So we know that this is actually working
properly in that we have no visible cards.

130
00:07:27.311 --> 00:07:33.790
So then instead of doing this,
what we could say is,

131
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:38.063
if has visible cards are no results

132
00:07:38.063 --> 00:07:42.779
noResultsMessage.hidden = true,

133
00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:50.319
else then the noResultsMessage.hidden
is equal to false.

134
00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:55.952
And if you wanna use a ternary operator or
something a little

135
00:07:55.952 --> 00:08:01.260
bit more concise here,
there's no harm in that at all.

136
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.144
But now it should be that if
we do spring let's, yeah,

137
00:08:04.144 --> 00:08:06.866
spring we have our two that
are there that's fine.

138
00:08:06.866 --> 00:08:08.362
But if we go over to edible,

139
00:08:08.362 --> 00:08:12.343
because there's nothing matching
that our has visible cards is false.

140
00:08:12.343 --> 00:08:17.930
So it's going and it's saying that it's
removing that hidden attribute from there.

141
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.505
Then as soon as we make a change here,
and I say this summer, and

142
00:08:21.505 --> 00:08:23.541
we're getting our summer ones in.

143
00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:26.638
We have visible cards, so there is
true that's getting returned to here.

144
00:08:26.638 --> 00:08:32.041
So then we're turning that back off,
over to hidden right here.

145
00:08:32.041 --> 00:08:36.620
One thing you could also do here is
the styling of it, just if you wanted to,

146
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.856
if I come to the edible in the spring,
where we don't have any thing.

147
00:08:40.856 --> 00:08:41.820
It is a little bit small.

148
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.083
So if you want to fancy up the styling of
that or do something a bit more with it,

149
00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:46.000
by all means you can.

150
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.769
I'm just gonna leave it like that for
now, but

151
00:08:48.769 --> 00:08:52.390
you can make it larger and
more obvious what it's actually,

152
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.948
just to make sure users actually see it,
if you'd like to.
