00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So all of our HTML is
in place, we're ready to dive in and

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.793
start actually coding some stuff up or
coding some CSS and

3
00:00:06.793 --> 00:00:11.031
getting everything to look more like
the actual page looks right now.

4
00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:13.564
And as I've been saying as
we're going through this,

5
00:00:13.564 --> 00:00:16.043
hopefully you've been
looking at the design files,

6
00:00:16.043 --> 00:00:19.200
you sort of had an idea of how you
wanna approach all of these things.

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.563
And in the next group of lessons,
I'm gonna sort of break it down and

8
00:00:22.563 --> 00:00:26.575
go through the different stages of things
a little bit from the bigger picture and

9
00:00:26.575 --> 00:00:27.471
narrowing down.

10
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:30.865
And so if you wanna take some time
right now to look through it,

11
00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:35.107
cuz one example here is in I did header
.p, but this would be our hero area, or

12
00:00:35.107 --> 00:00:37.026
whatever is at the top of the page.

13
00:00:37.026 --> 00:00:41.527
I could limit the width of what I'm doing
up there, just by doing something like

14
00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:45.166
this but if we look at the Figma design,
as I mentioned earlier.

15
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:49.688
This area here with this narrow text,
is the same as this narrow area over here,

16
00:00:49.688 --> 00:00:54.274
then we have this area that's a certain
width which matches things on other pages

17
00:00:54.274 --> 00:00:56.578
talked about containers and wrappers.

18
00:00:56.578 --> 00:01:00.372
But even if you are setting things up and
just maybe when you wrote your HTML,

19
00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:03.351
you put a container or
a wrapper in each one of the sections.

20
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:07.419
But how are you gonna make this
one narrower than this section,

21
00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:11.118
and this one down here wider
than this section over here?

22
00:01:11.118 --> 00:01:14.696
We know we need columns, but
how are we gonna create those columns and

23
00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:18.704
before I talk about how I like to do it,
I'd like you to think a little bit about

24
00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:21.502
how you might start up
approaching these things too.

25
00:01:21.502 --> 00:01:25.791
Just looking at the layout, you don't have
to write any code necessarily right away,

26
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:29.316
but just having an idea of the different
things that you think would make

27
00:01:29.316 --> 00:01:33.251
it easier, reusable things that you could
do in this one area that then you could

28
00:01:33.251 --> 00:01:35.160
reuse here and reuse somewhere else.

29
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.939
And then if you have some ideas for
code that you'd wanna do for

30
00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.101
that, you can dive in and start trying
to style some of that up as well.

31
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:44.707
All right, so we're ready to continue
making some progress on this and

32
00:01:44.707 --> 00:01:48.373
start getting some CSS together to
make the layout start happening, but

33
00:01:48.373 --> 00:01:52.179
very quickly before we do that, and
we have our plan of attack and all that.

34
00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:53.439
So before we dive into that,

35
00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.848
I think this would be a good time we
haven't talked about it in a little while,

36
00:01:56.848 --> 00:01:59.591
but I did mention we're gonna
do some source control things.

37
00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:03.681
So we're not gonna do a big one right now,
but since we're gonna start writing some

38
00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:06.429
CSS, if you open up the source
control panel in VS code,

39
00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.726
if you initialized your repo before,
you should see the changes.

40
00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:14.591
In this case, I've changed, made changes
to my index and my style sheet, obviously,

41
00:02:14.591 --> 00:02:18.865
and because I brought my assets in after
all of those assets are showing up here

42
00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:19.412
as well.

43
00:02:19.412 --> 00:02:22.012
Down here below,
there's also the source control thing,

44
00:02:22.012 --> 00:02:25.194
we'll talk more about that after,
but for now, we'll hide that away.

45
00:02:25.194 --> 00:02:30.392
Basically, all we wanna do is put
in a message about what we've done.

46
00:02:30.392 --> 00:02:34.465
We haven't done a lot right now, but
we could have say finished the HTML,

47
00:02:34.465 --> 00:02:37.828
something like that to give us
a bit of a point on where we are.

48
00:02:37.828 --> 00:02:41.805
Could be a good thing if we muck things
up and we wanna go back where we sort of

49
00:02:41.805 --> 00:02:44.626
are saving our place in
the sand here a little bit, or

50
00:02:44.626 --> 00:02:47.990
creating like a little mark in
history about where we're at.

51
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.564
So I'm just gonna hit commit I haven't
staged anything, let's hit cancel.

52
00:02:51.564 --> 00:02:56.026
You can hit the plus sign next to every
one of these to commit them individually,

53
00:02:56.026 --> 00:02:58.170
this is if you're doing it like this.

54
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.018
If you already know how to
use Git with command line,

55
00:03:00.018 --> 00:03:01.411
of course you can be doing that as well.

56
00:03:01.411 --> 00:03:05.993
There's also the big stage all changes
that's right here or if you do commit

57
00:03:05.993 --> 00:03:10.790
without making any of them, and you get
this message, you can just hit yes, and

58
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.243
it's going to commit all of those
changes and then save them in that step.

59
00:03:15.243 --> 00:03:18.055
But we'll do it this way,
where I'll just hit the big plus there, so

60
00:03:18.055 --> 00:03:21.370
it's staged those changes now you can
see it's switched it from stage changes.

61
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.146
And then I can hit commit right there
they're now committed locally on

62
00:03:25.146 --> 00:03:27.578
my computer, and
then if I hit sync changes,

63
00:03:27.578 --> 00:03:30.783
it's gonna bring all of those
changes up to GitHub as well.

64
00:03:30.783 --> 00:03:33.983
And you can see because it's
the first time I'm doing that,

65
00:03:33.983 --> 00:03:37.325
I do get this message,
this action will pull and push commits.

66
00:03:37.325 --> 00:03:41.563
So you can hit OK, or in this case, I'm
gonna push OK, don't show again, just Just

67
00:03:41.563 --> 00:03:45.421
cuz I know what this is doing and I don't
want it to pop up every time I do this.

68
00:03:45.421 --> 00:03:46.426
So we do that, and

69
00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:50.258
just like that, all of those changes
we've made are now on GitHub.

70
00:03:50.258 --> 00:03:53.613
This could be good, again, we're
creating that little point in history.

71
00:03:53.613 --> 00:03:56.367
If you're working on multiple machines,
you go on another machine,

72
00:03:56.367 --> 00:03:58.981
you can get your project from there or
if you're working the team,

73
00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:01.516
people have access to the work
that you're doing there as well.
