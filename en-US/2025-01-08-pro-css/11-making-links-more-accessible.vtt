00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.277
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Now we're
almost finished with the HTML.

2
00:00:02.277 --> 00:00:05.961
We're almost ready to get into the
layouts, but there's a really important

3
00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:09.149
thing that I want to talk to you about,
which is meaningful links.

4
00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:14.746
This type of thing in designs that we have
now with these links reference guides,

5
00:00:14.746 --> 00:00:19.787
not the worst one, but learn more is
this epidemic that we have on these.

6
00:00:19.787 --> 00:00:24.651
Links that look like buttons that
are just really bad for everybody.

7
00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:28.231
But if ever you go to your designer and
you say this text in this link is useless,

8
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:29.264
they're gonna say and

9
00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:32.703
it should be this really long paragraph
to explain what this link is doing.

10
00:00:32.703 --> 00:00:36.151
Your designer is going to tell you you
can't do that because then the button

11
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:36.981
looks terrible.

12
00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:40.323
So there's actually a way that we
can create more meaningful links.

13
00:00:40.323 --> 00:00:44.372
And ideally, the links should be like, if
I look at a link and it says learn more,

14
00:00:44.372 --> 00:00:47.726
the problem with it is then, like,
what am I learning more about?

15
00:00:47.726 --> 00:00:50.120
Well, I guess connect with nature.

16
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.746
Well, where is that link
actually bringing me?

17
00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:52.588
It's kind of vague.

18
00:00:52.588 --> 00:00:53.935
What's actually happening?

19
00:00:53.935 --> 00:00:57.848
A user in this situation is kinda guessing
at what it's gonna bring them to.

20
00:00:57.848 --> 00:01:00.885
But at least if you're skimming the page
really fast, you You might have an idea.

21
00:01:00.885 --> 00:01:04.260
That's why the reference guide, you
probably know what you're getting here,

22
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.402
so it's not the end of the world but
it's still has some sort of vagueness.

23
00:01:07.402 --> 00:01:11.132
And again, if somebody is using an
assistive technology to go through a page

24
00:01:11.132 --> 00:01:13.816
and someone's keyboard
navigating through a page and

25
00:01:13.816 --> 00:01:15.638
they're just jumping link to link.

26
00:01:15.638 --> 00:01:17.468
They're just seeing like
the links you have.

27
00:01:17.468 --> 00:01:19.920
And then they hit Reference Guide and
they hit Learn More, and

28
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.327
they have learn more and
then they actually have to look up and

29
00:01:22.327 --> 00:01:24.471
see what else like what
are they learning more about.

30
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:29.053
It's just it's not the best pattern in
the world for keyboard navigators we can't

31
00:01:29.053 --> 00:01:33.520
really help them but for people that are
using screen readers we definitely can.

32
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.585
And to do that,
I'm going to grab this code here and

33
00:01:37.585 --> 00:01:40.055
put this in a utilities layer.

34
00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:42.971
So you'll grab this from the course.

35
00:01:42.971 --> 00:01:47.782
And I meant to put a link in here that it
looks like I forgot to put in the lesson.

36
00:01:47.782 --> 00:01:50.290
But if you just look up
visually-hidden class,

37
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.019
Scott O'Hara has a really good blog post,
and I linked to him earlier for

38
00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:57.157
one of the other things that we
looked at that explains this.

39
00:01:57.157 --> 00:02:00.315
Or the A11Y project also has
an explanation of what this is,

40
00:02:00.315 --> 00:02:02.076
like why we're doing it this way,

41
00:02:02.076 --> 00:02:05.622
because this looks like a really
complicated way to hide something.

42
00:02:05.622 --> 00:02:06.989
Basically, we're hiding it visually.

43
00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:10.386
And the other, well,
let me bring it in to our utilities.

44
00:02:10.386 --> 00:02:14.609
So I'll go to my CSS utilities,
I always have at the bottom.

45
00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:19.862
So you add layer utilities,
I'm gonna paste it in there.

46
00:02:19.862 --> 00:02:23.648
And I have it twice now there we go.

47
00:02:23.648 --> 00:02:28.440
So the other class name you will
see used for this is sr-only,

48
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.754
which is screen reader only.

49
00:02:30.754 --> 00:02:34.206
Again, I like verbose things that
people can understand right away.

50
00:02:34.206 --> 00:02:37.203
So visually hidden,
it says exactly what it's doing.

51
00:02:37.203 --> 00:02:39.529
So I like that class name better.

52
00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:44.303
And we're gonna add some content here
that sighted users won't see, but

53
00:02:44.303 --> 00:02:48.615
other people that are using screen
readers will be able to access.

54
00:02:48.615 --> 00:02:51.517
And we're actually gonna use this
in a few different places, but

55
00:02:51.517 --> 00:02:52.799
we can use this in our links.

56
00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.375
So let's just do class equals
button to get to the first one.

57
00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:59.610
And we'll do the second one first,
because I think this one's easier.

58
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.129
So if you ever have a learn more link,

59
00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.200
it should say what they're
learning more about.

60
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.188
So in this case, it's just gonna
bring us to the second page,

61
00:03:06.188 --> 00:03:07.632
which is the mushroom guide.

62
00:03:07.632 --> 00:03:15.419
So learn more about the different types of
mushrooms using our handy mushroom guide,

63
00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:20.078
or something like that,
something that's like.

64
00:03:20.078 --> 00:03:21.316
Where is this link going?

65
00:03:21.316 --> 00:03:22.170
What's it actually doing?

66
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.506
What context is it?

67
00:03:23.506 --> 00:03:26.595
And so now, if a user came across
this link and they get that context,

68
00:03:26.595 --> 00:03:28.691
they understand exactly what's happening.

69
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:31.932
But of course, if you had that as
a button, which we don't have styled, but

70
00:03:31.932 --> 00:03:34.432
if this was a button,
it would look absolutely terrible.

71
00:03:34.432 --> 00:03:37.500
Your designer is never gonna let
you do that or your client, so

72
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.335
you just come in here with a span and.

73
00:03:39.335 --> 00:03:42.949
That wraps all of that, and

74
00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:48.135
class is equal to visually hidden, and

75
00:03:48.135 --> 00:03:53.332
it will hide all of that extra content.

76
00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:55.245
So the content is there.

77
00:03:55.245 --> 00:03:57.938
It's part of the DOM, and
it's why we're not using a display none,

78
00:03:57.938 --> 00:04:00.834
because if something has a display
none on it screen reader won't see it.

79
00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:03.808
So we have this weird,
complex, odd, looking CSS.

80
00:04:03.808 --> 00:04:05.782
You do not need to remember this.

81
00:04:05.782 --> 00:04:09.457
Just do a Google search every time
you need it of screen reader only or

82
00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:13.792
visually hidden, and the first five
results will all give you this exact code.

83
00:04:13.792 --> 00:04:15.106
It's very common.

84
00:04:15.106 --> 00:04:19.436
It's used everywhere, so
it's very easy to find it.

85
00:04:19.436 --> 00:04:22.637
And we do the same thing for
the Reference Guide one here.

86
00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:29.308
Maybe we could just do
learn more about mushrooms,

87
00:04:29.308 --> 00:04:37.385
or let's do wild mushrooms using
our handy reference guide.

88
00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:42.187
And in this case, the span can go at
the top instead of at the bottom,

89
00:04:42.187 --> 00:04:46.421
and that gets, or here,
before I do that, we can hit Save.

90
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:53.674
We see the nice, big long link and then as
soon as I add the class="visually hidden",

91
00:04:53.674 --> 00:04:57.896
it shows me only the text
that I want that's there.

92
00:04:57.896 --> 00:04:58.989
So a nice way just to make.

93
00:04:58.989 --> 00:05:01.839
Your same way we're doing alt
text properly on our images to

94
00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:03.838
make sure that our sites are accessible.

95
00:05:03.838 --> 00:05:07.485
This is another way, and another
very simple step you can do to help

96
00:05:07.485 --> 00:05:09.974
improve the accessibility of your website.
