WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.932
All right, so to get our site online, the
first thing we're gonna wanna do is we've

2
00:00:02.932 --> 00:00:05.058
made a whole bunch of changes,
we made that initial commit.

3
00:00:05.058 --> 00:00:08.361
We did another follow-up one
when we finished our HTML, but

4
00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:10.906
we're gonna be hooking
up Netlify to GitHub.

5
00:00:10.906 --> 00:00:14.184
So, all the code that's going
online is coming through GitHub,

6
00:00:14.184 --> 00:00:17.590
so the first thing we need to do is
push those changes over to GitHub.

7
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.257
So it's the same process we did before,

8
00:00:19.257 --> 00:00:21.277
we came to the litter
Source Control thing here.

9
00:00:21.277 --> 00:00:26.279
We can stage those, so you just click
the plus for Stage All Changes, and

10
00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.531
then you can put in a message, so in this
case we could say finished page one.

11
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.203
Most of the time when you're doing these,

12
00:00:34.203 --> 00:00:38.450
you probably wanna do these in a bit
smaller sections along the way.

13
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.647
For what we're doing right now,

14
00:00:39.647 --> 00:00:41.750
I think it's completely fine
to have it set up in this way.

15
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.580
So finish page one, we can commit
that it's gonna ask us to sync,

16
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.984
we can hit sync changes, and
just like that, everything's up on GitHub.

17
00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:54.089
With our site up on GitHub, the next thing
we wanna do is connect it to Netlify.

18
00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.901
So I'm gonna just go to netlify.com, you
will need to have an account with them, so

19
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:01.516
you can sign up if If you don't have one,
it's free, doesn't take very long.

20
00:01:01.516 --> 00:01:06.444
I'm gonna log in cuz I already have an
account, and you can see I do us Netlify

21
00:01:06.444 --> 00:01:11.234
regularly for a lot of my own projects
cuz I think it's a pretty good host.

22
00:01:11.234 --> 00:01:15.411
Right here there's a big add new, there
is another way you can do this if you

23
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:18.064
wanna sort of not bother
with version control,

24
00:01:18.064 --> 00:01:20.743
where you'll see a thing
that looks like this.

25
00:01:20.743 --> 00:01:23.572
We can actually drag and
drop a folder into Netlify,

26
00:01:23.572 --> 00:01:26.803
and it will just build the project
that you drop into there.

27
00:01:26.803 --> 00:01:29.254
I wouldn't really recommend
getting used to that,

28
00:01:29.254 --> 00:01:31.381
cuz it's not the best
workflow in the world.

29
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:34.101
You can even update by
dropping new folders in there,

30
00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:37.607
it's cool how easy it is, but
the connection with GitHub is a bit more

31
00:01:37.607 --> 00:01:40.344
realistic to what you'll
be doing in the real world.

32
00:01:40.344 --> 00:01:43.797
And in the workforce, so
I'm gonna go to the add new site and

33
00:01:43.797 --> 00:01:46.575
I'm gonna choose import
an existing project.

34
00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:51.921
It's gonna ask you for what GI provider
you're using, so I'm gonna choose GitHub.

35
00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:56.214
If you did use a different GI provider,
you can go with whichever one you want,

36
00:01:56.214 --> 00:01:57.853
it will ask you to authorize.

37
00:01:57.853 --> 00:02:02.055
You can see I the big flash there cuz
I've already made the connection between,

38
00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:05.206
I've already authorized Netlify
to connect with GitHub.

39
00:02:05.206 --> 00:02:07.509
So you will have to give
it permission to do so,

40
00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.824
which means you'll probably have to log in
if you're not already logged into GitHub,

41
00:02:11.824 --> 00:02:14.508
you just say yes, and
now it has access to your repos.

42
00:02:14.508 --> 00:02:18.180
You do have a choice of giving it
access to all of your repositories, or

43
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.795
you can select only specific
ones if you you want,

44
00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:23.737
I just give it access to everything,
cuz it's easier.

45
00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:26.031
But if you're just worried
about privacy or anything and

46
00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:28.526
you just wanna focus on specific ones,
there's no problem.

47
00:02:28.526 --> 00:02:32.735
It's pretty easy just to select which
ones you want to give it access to.

48
00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:36.056
And when you get your list here in
Netlify, you'll only see the ones that

49
00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:38.792
you've given it access to,
instead of seeing all of them.

50
00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:40.920
In my case,
because I did choose all of them,

51
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.888
it can be hard to [LAUGH]
find the one I want.

52
00:02:42.888 --> 00:02:46.900
So I'm gonna come over here and right FEM,

53
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.481
I think it was from scratch and
it should find it.

54
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:55.088
There we go, two minutes ago, so
you can see it was very recently updated,

55
00:02:55.088 --> 00:02:55.729
its public.

56
00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:57.756
But again, if it was a private
repo that you're using,

57
00:02:57.756 --> 00:02:59.147
it's also going to be able to find it.

58
00:02:59.147 --> 00:03:03.627
There's no problem at all with
finding that, and you can click on it.

59
00:03:03.627 --> 00:03:07.938
It's gonna ask you for a site name, this
is gonna relate to the URL it's gonna use.

60
00:03:07.938 --> 00:03:12.962
You could you leave it blank and
you'll just get a random one,

61
00:03:12.962 --> 00:03:15.483
but we can do FEM from scratch.

62
00:03:15.483 --> 00:03:18.884
And I'm gonna do example,
give it any name you want,

63
00:03:18.884 --> 00:03:21.618
some you guys can fight over whoever gets.

64
00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:25.779
The default one, or the fungi finders
one add, I'll do check availability,

65
00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:28.122
it tells me that the site
name is available.

66
00:03:28.122 --> 00:03:30.796
Just nice to do that before you
get to the end and hit submit and

67
00:03:30.796 --> 00:03:32.166
find out you need to change it.

68
00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:35.709
But any name you want here,
choose whatever you want,

69
00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.495
there's some build sightings
along the way here as well.

70
00:03:39.495 --> 00:03:44.124
These you don't have to do anything too
fancy, for this project, if you get into

71
00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:48.570
other things, JavaScript frameworks and
things that require build steps.

72
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.279
There will be some parts that you'll have
to fill out here, though, Netlify does

73
00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.610
detect what you're using for those, so
it will auto fill a lot of these and

74
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.713
usually get it right, but
you'll wanna double check everything.

75
00:03:58.713 --> 00:04:02.076
In this case, main branch is correct,
we don't need anything else.

76
00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:04.936
We don't need any environment variables,
so

77
00:04:04.936 --> 00:04:08.174
I can just click Deploy FEM from scratch,
example.

78
00:04:08.174 --> 00:04:13.169
And in doing that, it does not take very
long, it brings us to this page where

79
00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.638
it will be a site deploy in progress,
and you just wait a little bit.

80
00:04:17.638 --> 00:04:21.843
In this case, it should go extremely
fast because it's just a static website,

81
00:04:21.843 --> 00:04:25.122
that has to throw some static
files online, and it will work.

82
00:04:25.122 --> 00:04:29.616
If there's a build step, it can take a
couple of minutes to go through the build,

83
00:04:29.616 --> 00:04:34.262
but sometimes it automatically updates
the screen to let you know when it's done.

84
00:04:34.262 --> 00:04:38.277
In my experience, sometimes you need
to refresh, and I can see it's not yet

85
00:04:38.277 --> 00:04:38.922
deployed.

86
00:04:38.922 --> 00:04:42.959
Sometimes when this happens, it's waiting
because I'm on a free account, so

87
00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:46.293
you just wait cuz you're in the queue
of sites that have to build.

88
00:04:46.293 --> 00:04:48.095
So if you find the wait a little bit long,

89
00:04:48.095 --> 00:04:51.116
you can also click on deploying your
site and see what the holdup is,

90
00:04:51.116 --> 00:04:54.724
where it's busy building and deploying
our site, but there's nothing wrong.

91
00:04:54.724 --> 00:04:55.908
I just have to wait,

92
00:04:55.908 --> 00:05:00.037
you can even play a little game of
find the card while you're waiting.

93
00:05:00.037 --> 00:05:01.435
We won't do that right now,

94
00:05:01.435 --> 00:05:04.831
once it's done you'll get everything
coming up to being complete.

95
00:05:04.831 --> 00:05:08.005
Hopefully there's no errors, there
shouldn't be anything that can happen when

96
00:05:08.005 --> 00:05:11.092
it's a static site, like we're doing now
with just HTML and CSS along the way.

97
00:05:11.092 --> 00:05:15.942
So we shouldn't see any problems,
you can say, open, production, deploy, but

98
00:05:15.942 --> 00:05:17.481
you might get a weird URL.

99
00:05:17.481 --> 00:05:20.978
No, it gave me the right one, sometimes
you get the wrong URL, but you can,

100
00:05:20.978 --> 00:05:23.344
if you look at the URL here,
it's the correct URL.

101
00:05:23.344 --> 00:05:26.590
FEM, from scratch,
example .netlify.app, and

102
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.696
this website is now online and
fully functional.

103
00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:34.088
Well, one page is fully there, so
you can share it with your friends or

104
00:05:34.088 --> 00:05:38.043
whatever you want to brag a little
bit about being done with it.

105
00:05:38.043 --> 00:05:40.577
And, yeah,
that's all you really need to do here,

106
00:05:40.577 --> 00:05:42.949
Netlify does offer you to
set up a custom domain.

107
00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.319
If you have an existing one,
it's super easy to connect to it, so

108
00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:50.814
you can do that, and
they give you HTTPS for free, so

109
00:05:50.814 --> 00:05:55.120
you'll have a secure connection,
along the way there as well.
