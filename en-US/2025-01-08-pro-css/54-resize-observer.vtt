00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.123
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So there's one thing you
might have noticed along the way you might

2
00:00:03.123 --> 00:00:05.374
not have, but
if you have a mobile navigation.

3
00:00:05.374 --> 00:00:09.532
One problem that can happen is
when you're resizing the browser.

4
00:00:09.532 --> 00:00:14.107
If it's opened, it's fine, but if it's
closed, you could run into the situation

5
00:00:14.107 --> 00:00:18.683
where, when you get to here, it's opened,
and then it transitions away because of

6
00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:21.343
all the transitions and
stuff we've said on it.

7
00:00:21.343 --> 00:00:24.945
And it's just because all of a sudden
it's getting to that media query and then

8
00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:28.672
the transition kicks in and it goes and
hides off and it's a little bit annoying.

9
00:00:28.672 --> 00:00:31.390
I will say I get asked
about this all the time and

10
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.065
my usual answer is the only people that
are ever resizing their browsers in these

11
00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:38.877
situations are other developers or
yourself.

12
00:00:38.877 --> 00:00:41.921
It's, a regular user's not doing anything.

13
00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:46.101
So it might not be something you
actually have to worry about, but

14
00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:50.284
if it really does bother you,
there's ways that we can solve it.

15
00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:54.789
So I'm just gonna do this in my
main.js this is where we have our

16
00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:56.831
navigation stuff already.

17
00:00:56.831 --> 00:01:00.499
And for this,
we want to be using a ResizeObserver.

18
00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:03.376
So if you've never used a ResizeObserver,

19
00:01:03.376 --> 00:01:06.419
they look like this just
new resize observer.

20
00:01:06.419 --> 00:01:11.317
There's older ways of doing this,
they're probably perfectly fine just

21
00:01:11.317 --> 00:01:15.762
the ResizeObservers just really
good at just doing this one thing.

22
00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:19.585
So from a performance standpoint,
it's really good.

23
00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:21.406
[LAUGH] doing what it does.

24
00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:24.318
So, yeah, just a new ResizeObserver there.

25
00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:27.067
So I'm just gonna bring
this one in right here,

26
00:01:27.067 --> 00:01:29.560
resizeObserver is a new ResizeObserver.

27
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.537
And it's just going to do something every
time the page is resizing, basically.

28
00:01:36.537 --> 00:01:41.265
When we're doing this, we can have
it looking for different things, but

29
00:01:41.265 --> 00:01:46.370
in this case, all I want it to do is look
at the body and when the page is resizing,

30
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.575
we can add this document .body.class list
and just some sort of class on there.

31
00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:54.555
It could be a resizing,
it could be a no animations.

32
00:01:54.555 --> 00:02:01.153
There's a number of different things
that you could have it put on there, so

33
00:02:01.153 --> 00:02:08.385
we can come in here, document.body.class
list, and we said resizing, right?

34
00:02:08.385 --> 00:02:12.302
So resizing, but anything that
would make sense for you, just so

35
00:02:12.302 --> 00:02:17.290
when things are resizing, we wanna make
sure nothing's actually happening, and

36
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.800
that means we wanna go
to our CSS file now.

37
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.639
This makes sense in the utilities.

38
00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.446
So I'll just put it all the way
at the bottom of my utilities.

39
00:02:25.446 --> 00:02:27.202
And we probably don't need it.

40
00:02:27.202 --> 00:02:30.693
Yeah, I'll put it at the top actually,

41
00:02:30.693 --> 00:02:35.017
just so we don't have to scroll so
far right here.

42
00:02:35.017 --> 00:02:41.833
Because of the way we have our layers set
up, you probably don't need to do this,

43
00:02:41.833 --> 00:02:46.759
but what I'm gonna do is just
transition none important.

44
00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:50.192
Again, I don't think we need
the important on here, but if,

45
00:02:50.192 --> 00:02:52.449
yeah, I don't think we really need it.

46
00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:53.491
We'll try it without, but

47
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:56.315
you could throw the important on there
if you really just wanna make sure.

48
00:02:56.315 --> 00:03:00.124
But using layers, it should make it so
we really don't need to have it there.

49
00:03:00.124 --> 00:03:03.804
And animation, none.

50
00:03:03.804 --> 00:03:04.913
I'm putting animation none.

51
00:03:04.913 --> 00:03:07.277
I don't have any animations on my page.

52
00:03:07.277 --> 00:03:11.141
And I would encourage testing in this
situation if you do have animations

53
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:13.812
because this would just
turn off the animations.

54
00:03:13.812 --> 00:03:18.591
The other alternative is
an animation play-state of

55
00:03:18.591 --> 00:03:22.528
paused I think it's paused yeah, paused.

56
00:03:22.528 --> 00:03:25.427
So if you had animations running
on your page and someone resizes,

57
00:03:25.427 --> 00:03:29.021
just the animations in their current state
would actually pause where they were.

58
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:31.848
And then when you finish resizing,
they would start going again.

59
00:03:31.848 --> 00:03:33.836
Maybe you don't wanna have this at all.

60
00:03:33.836 --> 00:03:37.167
Maybe you only wanna do this for
that one specific thing.

61
00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:39.835
So you'd be more specific
with what you're targeting,

62
00:03:39.835 --> 00:03:42.626
instead of doing it as this bulk thing for
your entire page.

63
00:03:42.626 --> 00:03:45.276
I also realized I did it on that class,
but I wanna do it for

64
00:03:45.276 --> 00:03:46.946
all the children that are in there.

65
00:03:46.946 --> 00:03:50.710
So, absolutely every element that's
inside my resizing is going to get no

66
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.937
transitions and the animation,
either the play state paused or

67
00:03:53.937 --> 00:03:57.123
just turning off the animations,
it depends on your use case.

68
00:03:57.123 --> 00:03:59.753
So, when we do this, we're partway there.

69
00:03:59.753 --> 00:04:04.036
We're gonna be adding that on there,
but we obviously also need to be able

70
00:04:04.036 --> 00:04:07.158
to remove the class from it
when the animation stops.

71
00:04:07.158 --> 00:04:10.882
And to do this, we're gonna use
the request animation frame, and

72
00:04:10.882 --> 00:04:14.623
then we need it to actually after that,
tell it to stop observing.

73
00:04:14.623 --> 00:04:19.720
No, sorry, we need to actually tell it to
observe the body itself for the resizing.

74
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.417
The reason we're using request
animation frame is because when we

75
00:04:23.417 --> 00:04:26.863
resize the browser,
the browser is repainting constantly.

76
00:04:26.863 --> 00:04:28.422
So it's just repaint,
repaint, repaint, repaint.

77
00:04:28.422 --> 00:04:30.330
So it's in the terms of the browser.

78
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.918
These are all animation
frames that are going on.

79
00:04:32.918 --> 00:04:37.868
And so when we stop resizing is when
it gets to the request animation frame,

80
00:04:37.868 --> 00:04:41.012
there's no more animation frames running,
so

81
00:04:41.012 --> 00:04:45.272
then we can remove the resizing
from the class list right there.

82
00:04:45.272 --> 00:04:47.477
So that's why I'm using
a request animation frame.

83
00:04:47.477 --> 00:04:50.904
There's other techniques that
use set timeout instead, just so

84
00:04:50.904 --> 00:04:54.281
after a certain period of time passes,
then it would remove it.

85
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:59.644
But this works really well, and it hooks
into how the browser likes to work.

86
00:04:59.644 --> 00:05:05.778
So in our JavaScript file right here,
we can bring that in.

87
00:05:05.778 --> 00:05:07.824
So we're just requestAnimationFrame.

88
00:05:07.824 --> 00:05:10.712
We're removing the resizing from there.

89
00:05:10.712 --> 00:05:15.313
And then that last part that we had here
was just, we need to say resizeObserver.

90
00:05:15.313 --> 00:05:16.961
We have to actually tell
it to do something.

91
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:18.596
We created the resizeObserver.

92
00:05:18.596 --> 00:05:20.145
It doesn't know what to watch yet.

93
00:05:20.145 --> 00:05:25.092
So then we say,
resizeObserver, observe, and

94
00:05:25.092 --> 00:05:31.013
then we tell it that we want
to look at the document.body.

95
00:05:31.013 --> 00:05:34.960
And it wasn't working and we saw that
it wasn't adding on the body there,

96
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.014
just because I had class list,
but I forgot to put add, so

97
00:05:38.014 --> 00:05:41.153
it never added it to the class
there when we were resizing.

98
00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:45.376
So now you can see, as long as that's
resizing, you can see it's on there, and

99
00:05:45.376 --> 00:05:47.786
then as soon as I let go,
the class goes away.

100
00:05:47.786 --> 00:05:52.070
And so if that resizing is on there,
when we go larger or

101
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.342
smaller, we don't get it firing at all.

102
00:05:55.342 --> 00:05:57.352
And then if we're not doing it,
the class goes away.

103
00:05:57.352 --> 00:05:59.599
So then the animations work as expected.
