00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.969
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Now we just looked
at creating the section class that

2
00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:03.852
we're using.

3
00:00:03.852 --> 00:00:05.997
The section class acts
a lot like a utility class.

4
00:00:05.997 --> 00:00:10.749
A wrapper in a very big way
is also a utility class.

5
00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:14.978
Some people think of utility classes as
things that are like one selector for

6
00:00:14.978 --> 00:00:16.629
one property value pair, but

7
00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:19.814
I find it's anything that
does one very specific thing.

8
00:00:19.814 --> 00:00:22.538
So wrap the content and
holding it in the middle or

9
00:00:22.538 --> 00:00:25.339
must setting the padding
like we've been doing.

10
00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:29.859
And I mention that I do think there's
useful times to have a lot of different

11
00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.902
utilities along the way, but finding the
balance is an important thing with them.

12
00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:37.881
But I like looking through the project,
so we did the spacing now.

13
00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:41.561
And if I come and look through
the project now, dive into the file,

14
00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:43.683
you hopefully saw some other things.

15
00:00:43.683 --> 00:00:48.303
I brought some of them up before on other
areas where we can have utility classes

16
00:00:48.303 --> 00:00:49.705
that could help us out.

17
00:00:49.705 --> 00:00:54.436
And the main thing I look for
to think of if something could be a useful

18
00:00:54.436 --> 00:00:59.582
utility is looking at, say,
I look at the paragraph that's right here.

19
00:00:59.582 --> 00:01:03.194
This paragraph, let me,
the paragraph right there,

20
00:01:03.194 --> 00:01:06.570
is identical to the paragraphs
that are down here,

21
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.673
except the font-size is bigger,
there's no other change.

22
00:01:10.673 --> 00:01:14.427
It's also identical to this
paragraph here, except this one,

23
00:01:14.427 --> 00:01:18.946
the color has changed on it, where this
one's the light brownish color, and

24
00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:20.913
this one here is just pure white.

25
00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:25.000
And then if I look in other places too,
like this one's actually in between that

26
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.058
this one's the same as this,
but it's slightly smaller.

27
00:01:28.058 --> 00:01:30.582
We have different font-sizes coming in.

28
00:01:30.582 --> 00:01:34.376
And one way we could do something like
this is on each one of these sections,

29
00:01:34.376 --> 00:01:38.652
I could choose, right now, all I've done
is called them section, it's section,

30
00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:39.518
class section.

31
00:01:39.518 --> 00:01:41.846
And I could come in here and
be like, okay,

32
00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:45.232
this section needs paragraphs
that are gonna be a bit bigger.

33
00:01:45.232 --> 00:01:48.298
So how would I distinguish,
how would I select that?

34
00:01:48.298 --> 00:01:50.195
And what a lot of people do is, okay,

35
00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:53.150
I'm gonna do section equals
joys of mushroom foraging.

36
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.052
And then down here, section class is
equal to start your adventure, or

37
00:01:57.052 --> 00:01:58.300
something like that.

38
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.310
And you start naming classes based on
the content of what's there inside

39
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.844
of each section, and then you just
style up that section as it is.

40
00:02:07.844 --> 00:02:11.928
That's first of all, a little bit hard
cuz sometimes the content can change.

41
00:02:11.928 --> 00:02:14.949
So if the content changed right here,
and the title was different,

42
00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:17.766
all of a sudden the class name
has completely lost its meaning.

43
00:02:17.766 --> 00:02:21.009
And the other problem is, as a project
grows or you need new sections that

44
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.217
are getting added, you end up repeating
yourself over and over again.

45
00:02:24.217 --> 00:02:28.212
Because you'll end up with these areas
that are very similar with these slight

46
00:02:28.212 --> 00:02:29.370
little differences.

47
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.767
Even looking at this section
versus this section,

48
00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:35.298
we have the background color change.

49
00:02:35.298 --> 00:02:38.856
But then, even this section or the two
areas that have the green background,

50
00:02:38.856 --> 00:02:40.402
the content is quite different.

51
00:02:40.402 --> 00:02:43.895
There's similarities between the two of
them, but we have the two columns here,

52
00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:45.730
we don't have it over here, for example.

53
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.744
So trying to find the similarities,
where there's small differences, for me,

54
00:02:49.744 --> 00:02:53.524
is what I search for when trying to figure
out the types of classes I could reuse

55
00:02:53.524 --> 00:02:54.768
just to help myself out.

56
00:02:54.768 --> 00:02:57.472
And sometimes, I sprinkle these
throughout a whole project.

57
00:02:57.472 --> 00:03:01.997
And then I find areas like, actually,
I'm gonna delete that to a make class,

58
00:03:01.997 --> 00:03:05.827
just cuz it's gonna be easier for
me to be able to do it that way around.

59
00:03:05.827 --> 00:03:06.845
And in the lesson,

60
00:03:06.845 --> 00:03:10.483
there is one that you can grab
the utilities that I think are useful.

61
00:03:10.483 --> 00:03:13.065
But the main thing that
I often do is actually,

62
00:03:13.065 --> 00:03:17.502
as I look through a lot of the things
here, the things that tend, in my opinion,

63
00:03:17.502 --> 00:03:21.765
to make the best utility classes
are background-colors and font-sizes.

64
00:03:21.765 --> 00:03:24.502
Sometimes things like border radiuses.

65
00:03:24.502 --> 00:03:27.599
I used to use a lot of margin and
padding utility classes, and

66
00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.128
I moved away from doing that.

67
00:03:29.128 --> 00:03:31.333
But if it's something
that you like having,

68
00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:35.221
you can definitely have those types of
utilities just cuz then you don't have to

69
00:03:35.221 --> 00:03:39.127
remember 16 pixels versus 21 pixels,
you just margin four or margin five.

70
00:03:39.127 --> 00:03:42.711
So if you put prefer that type of thin,
it's completely fine.

71
00:03:42.711 --> 00:03:45.538
I just, again,
finding that balance for me,

72
00:03:45.538 --> 00:03:48.082
I stopped using those
as much as I used to.

73
00:03:48.082 --> 00:03:52.555
I found it more tedious than anything and
it was easier just to have a class on

74
00:03:52.555 --> 00:03:56.474
something cuz, usually,
there's other parts to that as well.

75
00:03:56.474 --> 00:03:59.261
But for the font-sizes, for
background-colors, font-weights,

76
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:02.566
can occasionally be useful, I don't think
we need font-weights in this project.

77
00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:06.447
But if you have a lot of varying
font-weights, and all you need to change

78
00:04:06.447 --> 00:04:10.661
is the font-weight on an element and
nothing else about it, it can be useful.

79
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:14.247
Just like we're changing the color
in a couple of these spots

80
00:04:14.247 --> 00:04:18.829
where a utility class could potentially
be useful to do something like that.

81
00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.936
So one thing I tend to do, and
some people don't like this,

82
00:04:21.936 --> 00:04:24.687
so if you don't like it,
that's completely fine.

83
00:04:24.687 --> 00:04:31.042
But I actually do this a lot,
whoops, wrong layer, my base layer.

84
00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:35.135
I tend to use a lot of
these that I have all here.

85
00:04:35.135 --> 00:04:40.729
And I'm not gonna bother with the
border-radiuses, I don't think, but I tend

86
00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:46.168
to bother a lot with these ones, and I
turn a lot of these into utility classes.

87
00:04:46.168 --> 00:04:51.809
And it feels kind of weird having them as
a utility class and as a custom property.

88
00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:54.850
As we build out things here, hopefully,
you see why I bother doing it.

89
00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.162
But I'm gonna copy all of those,
come all the way down to the bottom,

90
00:05:00.162 --> 00:05:03.193
cuz that's where I have my utilities.

91
00:05:03.193 --> 00:05:08.274
And for me, this is the fastest way to
do it, is, we can bring them all in and

92
00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:13.877
actually just delete the ends off of all
of these just cuz I'm gonna be using them.

93
00:05:13.877 --> 00:05:18.726
But then I come in with a,
say, text-main, and I turn,

94
00:05:18.726 --> 00:05:22.269
whoops, I should have first put the var.

95
00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:26.839
I actually do a text-main as a color.

96
00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:32.202
And you see this can go really fast,
a var text-main.

97
00:05:32.202 --> 00:05:35.838
And when you start doing this, it can
feel like it's a bit of a long process.

98
00:05:35.838 --> 00:05:39.493
I didn't do an opening curly brace.

99
00:05:39.493 --> 00:05:45.585
Let me just fix that, there we go, and
might use very broken line right now.

100
00:05:45.585 --> 00:05:50.911
But once you have this setup,
its very fast to copy-paste.

101
00:05:50.911 --> 00:05:56.000
And I need my text-brand right so I just
select on the high-contrast, I should say,

102
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.473
I select the main, I push Command D or
Control D, so it select both of them.

103
00:06:00.473 --> 00:06:06.292
And then I can do high-contrast,
whoops, like that.

104
00:06:06.292 --> 00:06:08.094
And then we can get rid of that one.

105
00:06:08.094 --> 00:06:13.552
I can copy this one, paste it,
select the high-contrast,

106
00:06:13.552 --> 00:06:17.950
Control or Command D, and
that one was my brand.

107
00:06:20.196 --> 00:06:23.085
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Then we do the same
thing for the background-colors and

108
00:06:23.085 --> 00:06:24.075
everything else.

109
00:06:24.075 --> 00:06:27.152
So it doesn't take very long to
do if you're doing it quickly.

110
00:06:27.152 --> 00:06:31.128
If you don't wanna name the class
the same as the custom property,

111
00:06:31.128 --> 00:06:33.197
you don't have to do that either.

112
00:06:33.197 --> 00:06:37.762
You could do a BG here, which is what most
people would probably do, just cuz it's

113
00:06:37.762 --> 00:06:41.677
a bit faster and easier to write BG
than it is to write the alternative.

114
00:06:41.677 --> 00:06:46.242
But I would do my background-light,

115
00:06:46.242 --> 00:06:53.812
I'm just gonna copy this, and
then do my background-color.

116
00:06:53.812 --> 00:06:55.659
If you're doing utility classes,

117
00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:59.793
I would also strongly recommend doing
background-color and not background.

118
00:06:59.793 --> 00:07:02.784
Cuz occasionally,
you need a background-color and

119
00:07:02.784 --> 00:07:07.578
a background-image and you don't wanna run
this on short hand overwriting issues.

120
00:07:07.578 --> 00:07:11.370
So var background-light.

121
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.768
If you're doing thing with abate more
turing, some of this steps can be

122
00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:19.819
automated too, but again,
I don't find it that long to do this.

123
00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:22.855
Its gonna go full screen so
we can see everything I'm doing.

124
00:07:22.855 --> 00:07:26.261
Paste it in, light I think is,

125
00:07:26.261 --> 00:07:31.280
that's my main,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Main,

126
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.069
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And I'm just gonna do

127
00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:37.990
this one here.

128
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.585
You get the picture of how this
is working and how I work.

129
00:07:41.585 --> 00:07:44.314
And we'll do that one as the dark.

130
00:07:44.314 --> 00:07:48.060
And then, as I said, all of this is

131
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:53.256
available
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Down a little

132
00:07:53.256 --> 00:07:58.627
bit on the page where I'm giving
you the different ones I'm using.

133
00:07:58.627 --> 00:08:03.294
So if you wanna just go through and
grab these ones, it's exactly what I'm

134
00:08:03.294 --> 00:08:07.681
doing now, going through them all,
there's one additional thing.

135
00:08:07.681 --> 00:08:11.387
So just for speed sake, we can grab those
instead of copying and pasting everything.

136
00:08:11.387 --> 00:08:15.227
And I'm just gonna go from my
visually hidden and replace them all.

137
00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:21.299
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And then,
once you've done that,

138
00:08:21.299 --> 00:08:25.591
the only things I've added here is
a section title and a text-center.

139
00:08:25.591 --> 00:08:28.040
So text-align: center is gonna
be useful in a couple of spots.

140
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.052
It's always a hand you want to have.

141
00:08:30.052 --> 00:08:34.806
You might also wanna have a text-end or
a text-right for

142
00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:39.570
text alignment, right,
if you feel like you need that.

143
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.086
In this project, we don't need it, so
I'm not gonna add it just for having it.

144
00:08:43.086 --> 00:08:48.199
It'd be something, if I needed it later
on, I could add it as utility class.

145
00:08:48.199 --> 00:08:52.393
And for the section-title,
my main thinking with the section-title,

146
00:08:52.393 --> 00:08:57.124
it's that idea that I had before where I
mentioned I don't like attaching things to

147
00:08:57.124 --> 00:08:58.360
the semantic thing.

148
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.651
So even though all of my h2's do look
the same, I like having a class for that.

149
00:09:02.651 --> 00:09:05.514
And I just feel like, in this case,
section-title makes sense.

150
00:09:05.514 --> 00:09:08.072
I might have other h2's somewhere
else that will look differently.

151
00:09:08.072 --> 00:09:11.751
And in this case,
it's always the title or the heading, so

152
00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:16.913
you could call it section heading as well,
that I'd be using for each one of those.

153
00:09:16.913 --> 00:09:22.091
And then with those in place, it takes a
little while to set these up all the time.

154
00:09:22.091 --> 00:09:25.782
But then, when you start using them,
I'm gonna skip the hero area right here.

155
00:09:25.782 --> 00:09:28.743
And I know we haven't got to
the navigation yet, we'll get there soon.

156
00:09:28.743 --> 00:09:32.926
But then, when we get into our project,
the three columns will stay the same.

157
00:09:32.926 --> 00:09:34.815
But then we get to this one right here.

158
00:09:34.815 --> 00:09:37.221
So that's the start,
we're in the right spot.

159
00:09:37.221 --> 00:09:39.448
Well, we can start right
there where that span is.

160
00:09:39.448 --> 00:09:45.728
I can do my class is text-brand and
I get the color coming in.

161
00:09:45.728 --> 00:09:48.013
I don't really have anything
else to change there.

162
00:09:48.013 --> 00:09:50.895
It's something I'll probably use
occasionally, so it makes sense for

163
00:09:50.895 --> 00:09:51.565
me to have that.

164
00:09:51.565 --> 00:09:58.682
My h2, as I said, gets my class is
equal to section-heading title,

165
00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:05.815
which I think I made a mistake in
the font-size, cuz that looks tiny.

166
00:10:05.815 --> 00:10:08.821
We'll adjust that in a minute,
I do apologize.

167
00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:14.136
We'll come back to that in a minute,
cuz then I also have my section here that

168
00:10:14.136 --> 00:10:19.301
had the background-accent that gives
us the green background on there.

169
00:10:19.301 --> 00:10:24.814
Then if we come down to this section,
which is the next one, I do believe.

170
00:10:24.814 --> 00:10:29.077
Yeah, that one down here is right here.

171
00:10:29.077 --> 00:10:32.987
So for that one,
we wanna have the section,

172
00:10:32.987 --> 00:10:37.014
we'll have the background-extra-dark.

173
00:10:37.014 --> 00:10:41.402
And it's a bit hard to see, but
we definitely have a contrast in our text

174
00:10:41.402 --> 00:10:46.542
there, and my h2 will also get the class
= section-heading, and get too small.

175
00:10:46.542 --> 00:10:53.368
So we'll fix that title,
keep using the wrong one.

176
00:10:53.368 --> 00:10:54.924
Connect with nature.

177
00:10:54.924 --> 00:10:59.703
The only change I believe
we need down there

178
00:10:59.703 --> 00:11:03.694
is also the class section-title.

179
00:11:03.694 --> 00:11:07.067
And then we start getting the different
background-colors coming through,

180
00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:08.609
which makes life look a lot better.

181
00:11:08.609 --> 00:11:11.182
Let's just go see what I
did with my section-title.

182
00:11:11.182 --> 00:11:17.227
Heading-base, mm-hm,
I must have made a mistake early on then.

183
00:11:17.227 --> 00:11:22.191
Let's go find that, font-size.

184
00:11:22.191 --> 00:11:25.246
I think I know what it is,
it's not base, it's regular.

185
00:11:28.142 --> 00:11:31.765
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, it's regular,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Yeah,

186
00:11:31.765 --> 00:11:34.749
regular, there we go.

187
00:11:34.749 --> 00:11:37.654
Let's just go look down,
that's better, [LAUGH].

188
00:11:37.654 --> 00:11:41.005
So regular instead of the base, next up.

189
00:11:41.005 --> 00:11:46.083
If I go, let's just go look at this at
a little bit of a bigger screen size.

190
00:11:46.083 --> 00:11:53.604
I think this one too, I need to adjust
as well, so I'm just missing the joys.

191
00:11:53.604 --> 00:11:55.470
The joys, there we go.

192
00:11:55.470 --> 00:12:02.844
I have an h2 class = section-heading.

193
00:12:02.844 --> 00:12:06.540
Title I did that every single one,
I think, there we go,

194
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:14.679
awesome,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Again,

195
00:12:14.679 --> 00:12:17.549
I just really wanna preface,
this is how I like to work,

196
00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:20.864
how I feel like it helps me make
a website a little bit for faster.

197
00:12:20.864 --> 00:12:22.887
We've done a lot of
prep work up until now.

198
00:12:22.887 --> 00:12:26.574
And now that things are starting to come
together, we should see the speed of

199
00:12:26.574 --> 00:12:30.392
things increases as we do things, and
we're doing them in very generic ways.

200
00:12:30.392 --> 00:12:33.480
I'm not doing things based on how this
one section is looking on this one part

201
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.018
of the page.

202
00:12:34.018 --> 00:12:37.453
I'm trying to find things that are
universally going to be able to be applied

203
00:12:37.453 --> 00:12:38.103
everywhere.

204
00:12:38.103 --> 00:12:40.332
So it definitely leads
to a lot more build up.

205
00:12:40.332 --> 00:12:45.307
But as time goes on,
then our projects can grow from there.

206
00:12:45.307 --> 00:12:48.628
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So since you've
created some utility classes here,

207
00:12:48.628 --> 00:12:53.803
what's the difference with this than just
reaching for something like tailwind?

208
00:12:53.803 --> 00:12:57.837
It looks similar in the situation
with using utility classes.

209
00:12:57.837 --> 00:13:00.961
So is there a benefit to
writing with selectors or

210
00:13:00.961 --> 00:13:05.927
rules, especially, if you're trying
to split your code into components?

211
00:13:05.927 --> 00:13:08.334
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Yeah, so hopefully,
we're gonna see a little bit,

212
00:13:08.334 --> 00:13:10.810
I do I think there's tons of
value in utility classes.

213
00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.384
I just find that the pendulum
swings completely over in that

214
00:13:15.384 --> 00:13:19.866
direction that we end up with,
instead of, especially,

215
00:13:19.866 --> 00:13:25.090
when you're writing in a vanilla
situation like we're doing now.

216
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.630
It ends up at one point, like when
we start getting to other things,

217
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.140
where I'm looking for
things now that are like one-off changes.

218
00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.605
I can change the color text,
the background-color here,

219
00:13:32.605 --> 00:13:33.697
little things like that.

220
00:13:33.697 --> 00:13:37.215
When we get to say something like
the cards where I need padding,

221
00:13:37.215 --> 00:13:41.973
a border-radius, a background-color,
some spacing that gonna be consistent, so

222
00:13:41.973 --> 00:13:45.575
I'm gonna be throwing four or
five, six different things at it.

223
00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:49.366
Or if I'm doing a button or something like
that, instead of having seven utility

224
00:13:49.366 --> 00:13:52.599
classes that I might have to reuse
the exact same one somewhere else,

225
00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:53.845
that's where I'm okay.

226
00:13:53.845 --> 00:13:57.374
Once I pass like three utility classes,
maybe even two,

227
00:13:57.374 --> 00:14:00.990
maybe I could just use a class here and
make my life easier.

228
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:06.036
But I do think there's a lot of value in
starting with utilities, starting with

229
00:14:06.036 --> 00:14:10.876
the generic selectors, as much as
possible, doing what you can with them.

230
00:14:10.876 --> 00:14:13.501
And then you find these the more
situational things after that, and

231
00:14:13.501 --> 00:14:14.849
work on those ones individually.
