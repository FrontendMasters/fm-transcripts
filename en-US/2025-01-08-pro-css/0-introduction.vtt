00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.693
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Hello
my Frontend friends, and

2
00:00:01.693 --> 00:00:04.837
welcome to this course on
building a website from scratch.

3
00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:08.393
My name is Kevin, and I'm really
excited to bring you this course.

4
00:00:08.393 --> 00:00:13.541
First of all, if you don't know me, I'm
an educator and online content creator.

5
00:00:13.541 --> 00:00:17.390
And my joy is teaching people CSS and
helping them fall in love with it.

6
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.549
And if I can't help people
fall in love with CSS,

7
00:00:19.549 --> 00:00:22.667
I'm hoping to at least help them be
a little bit less frustrated by it.

8
00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:24.682
And I'm really excited for this project.

9
00:00:24.682 --> 00:00:27.570
First of all, cuz I've been
invited here by Frontend Masters,

10
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.398
who I was a subscriber to a long time ago.

11
00:00:29.398 --> 00:00:33.748
So it's really cool to be here in
the studio with them creating this course.

12
00:00:33.748 --> 00:00:37.761
And second of all, because this type of
project of making something from scratch

13
00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:41.657
just using vanilla HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript is my favorite thing to do, and

14
00:00:41.657 --> 00:00:43.683
definitely my favorite thing to teach.

15
00:00:43.683 --> 00:00:46.785
So I'm really looking forward to
bringing you through all the steps and

16
00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:48.762
helping you learn a few
things along the way.

17
00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:52.246
We're gonna be building out a website
based on a Figma design file that provides

18
00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:54.068
us both with the desktop and mobile view.

19
00:00:54.068 --> 00:00:57.323
So we'll be look making it completely
responsive, talking a bit about mobile

20
00:00:57.323 --> 00:01:00.054
first, desktop first,
the best ways to approach those things.

21
00:01:00.054 --> 00:01:03.946
And try to match our file as closely as
possible as we go through everything.

22
00:01:03.946 --> 00:01:07.960
And we're gonna be doing it,
as I mentioned just with HTML, CSS, and

23
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.265
Vanilla JavaScript.

24
00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:12.432
There's a place for frameworks and
everything else along the way, but

25
00:01:12.432 --> 00:01:15.459
just getting down into the fundamentals
is my favorite thing to do.

26
00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:19.547
So we're gonna be going through all of
those as we progress through this course.

27
00:01:19.547 --> 00:01:22.574
And because we are talking about
the fundamentals, just for

28
00:01:22.574 --> 00:01:26.548
who this course is for, I am assuming
that you've already written some HTML and

29
00:01:26.548 --> 00:01:27.816
CSS up until this point.

30
00:01:27.816 --> 00:01:31.662
You have an idea of how the text editor
works and the basics of all of that.

31
00:01:31.662 --> 00:01:35.563
Don't need to have tons of experience
with it, but enough on semantic elements,

32
00:01:35.563 --> 00:01:36.354
CSS selectors,

33
00:01:36.354 --> 00:01:40.271
and the different types of selectors and
how they work, and a bit on specificity.

34
00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:43.683
And just having covered the basics and
built some smaller projects will really

35
00:01:43.683 --> 00:01:46.071
help you out,
if you're starting out on this course.

36
00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:49.783
We will be using some JavaScript as well,
we're not gonna be doing too much, but

37
00:01:49.783 --> 00:01:52.530
a little bit of a base in there
will help you out definitely.

38
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.221
If you've never touched it, you'll still
be able to follow along as well, though.

39
00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:57.224
So it's not essential,

40
00:01:57.224 --> 00:02:00.197
but a little bit of JavaScript knowledge
will definitely be beneficial.

41
00:02:00.197 --> 00:02:03.854
And one thing I wanna be doing with this
course is also ensuring that we're looking

42
00:02:03.854 --> 00:02:07.299
at the big picture and looking at how we
can approach a project with the figment

43
00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:08.739
design like we're gonna have.

44
00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.104
To be able to dive in and
build it in the proper way and

45
00:02:11.104 --> 00:02:12.977
doing it with maintainable practices.

46
00:02:12.977 --> 00:02:16.086
So we're not just jumping into it,
looking at the first thing on the page and

47
00:02:16.086 --> 00:02:16.776
coding that up.

48
00:02:16.776 --> 00:02:19.650
We're gonna start by analyzing
the project, breaking it all down.

49
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.638
And really setting ourselves up for
success from the very beginning.

50
00:02:22.638 --> 00:02:25.614
So it takes a little bit longer to
really get into the nitty gritty of it.

51
00:02:25.614 --> 00:02:26.928
But once we get to those stages,

52
00:02:26.928 --> 00:02:29.764
everything just sorta falls into
place as we go through everything.

53
00:02:29.764 --> 00:02:33.141
We're gonna be exploring different naming
conventions you can use in your CSS,

54
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:35.673
and I'm gonna be offering up
a few different things, just so

55
00:02:35.673 --> 00:02:38.226
you can choose sorta the approach
that you think works best.

56
00:02:38.226 --> 00:02:42.378
But I'll be talking about it in the larger
idea of how to best keep your CSS

57
00:02:42.378 --> 00:02:43.547
organized as well.

58
00:02:43.547 --> 00:02:47.162
And along the way, we're gonna look at
also adding in some fun animations and

59
00:02:47.162 --> 00:02:50.454
transitions and other things that
can help with the user experience.

60
00:02:50.454 --> 00:02:53.557
So if all of that sounds good to you,
then this is the right course for you and

61
00:02:53.557 --> 00:02:55.497
I'm really excited to dive in,
so let's go.

62
00:02:55.497 --> 00:02:58.357
Now, just before we dive into
the actual code and all of that,

63
00:02:58.357 --> 00:03:01.449
a few things that you'll need before
you get started is an editor.

64
00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:05.561
You've already been writing some HTML and
CSS, so I'm assuming that you already have

65
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:08.447
one of preference,
I'll be using VS code as I go through it.

66
00:03:08.447 --> 00:03:12.070
So if you wanna have the same experience
and be able to follow along easily,

67
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.459
you might wanna use VS code.

68
00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.116
But if you have another one that you like
better, that's completely fine, you're

69
00:03:17.116 --> 00:03:20.618
free and welcome to use that one, though
I will be recommending two extensions,

70
00:03:20.618 --> 00:03:23.217
the first one is Live Server and
the second one is Prettier.

71
00:03:23.217 --> 00:03:26.764
Live Server just makes our life a lot
easier in that it refreshes the page for

72
00:03:26.764 --> 00:03:29.712
us every time we save, so
we don't have to do that ourselves.

73
00:03:29.712 --> 00:03:32.206
And Prettier takes care of
a lot of the formatting for us.

74
00:03:32.206 --> 00:03:34.245
So if you have messy code,
you hit save, and

75
00:03:34.245 --> 00:03:36.571
all the indentation
formatting is fixed for you.

76
00:03:36.571 --> 00:03:40.257
There is a little bit of configuration
to get Prettier working, by default,

77
00:03:40.257 --> 00:03:41.290
you'll install it.

78
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.886
It says it's there, it says it's working,
and it doesn't actually do anything.

79
00:03:43.886 --> 00:03:47.394
So early on in the course, we'll look
at how we can make sure that it's

80
00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:50.674
actually working properly as well,
once you have it installed.

81
00:03:50.674 --> 00:03:53.807
Speaking of the VS code and
just things that match what I have,

82
00:03:53.807 --> 00:03:57.239
if you do like the setup I have,
people often ask me about my theme and

83
00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.792
my font, so
I've linked them in the course page.

84
00:03:59.792 --> 00:04:04.004
So it's one dark pro var night and
Cascadia code is the font that I'm using.

85
00:04:04.004 --> 00:04:06.164
So there's links to both of
those in the course page.

86
00:04:06.164 --> 00:04:07.659
Another thing that you will need is,

87
00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.713
we will be talking a bit about version
control as we go through this course.

88
00:04:10.713 --> 00:04:13.052
So you will need to have Git
installed on your computer.

89
00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:16.962
If you've used Git or GitHub or anything
like that before, you'll already have it.

90
00:04:16.962 --> 00:04:21.029
If you don't know if you have it or not,
you can just follow the link in the course

91
00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.783
page, it's going to bring
you to the download area.

92
00:04:23.783 --> 00:04:26.961
Download it, a few clicks,
it gets installed on your computer and

93
00:04:26.961 --> 00:04:27.999
you're ready to go.

94
00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:32.032
And with that, I'd also recommend
having an account with GitHub,

95
00:04:32.032 --> 00:04:34.236
you can use one of the alternatives.

96
00:04:34.236 --> 00:04:37.092
If you're already using one of them,
that's completely fine, but

97
00:04:37.092 --> 00:04:38.779
I will be using GitHub throughout this.

98
00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:41.923
So if you wanna match my experience,
then I would recommend GitHub.

99
00:04:41.923 --> 00:04:46.075
And I'm also gonna be using VS Codes
built in GitHub integrations.

100
00:04:46.075 --> 00:04:47.944
So it just makes life a little bit easier.

101
00:04:47.944 --> 00:04:50.474
So, once again,
if you're following along with me,

102
00:04:50.474 --> 00:04:52.845
the easiest thing to do is
to have them the same way.

103
00:04:52.845 --> 00:04:56.246
But if you're comfortable with get already
know how to do it in the command line,

104
00:04:56.246 --> 00:04:58.606
then you'll be fine following
however you wanna do it.

105
00:04:58.606 --> 00:05:00.904
And last but not least, there is Netlify.

106
00:05:00.904 --> 00:05:03.744
We're gonna be looking at getting this
site online as well, and I'm gonna be

107
00:05:03.744 --> 00:05:06.645
using Netlify as the hosting for this,
it's really easy to get going with it.

108
00:05:06.645 --> 00:05:09.273
It's completely free to have an account
and host your websites with it.

109
00:05:09.273 --> 00:05:11.928
So if you don't already
have an account with them,

110
00:05:11.928 --> 00:05:15.712
you can set up an account now before
you dive in, it's really easy to do.

111
00:05:15.712 --> 00:05:18.262
Just like with GitHub,
there are alternative solutions.

112
00:05:18.262 --> 00:05:21.469
So there's cloud for pages, there's GitHub
pages, just to name a couple of them,

113
00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:22.789
there's also a lot of other ones.

114
00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.007
If you're more comfortable, you're
already having an account with that, and

115
00:05:26.007 --> 00:05:28.339
you know how all of that works,
that's completely fine.

116
00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:30.862
But once again, I'll be using
Netlify as I go through this,

117
00:05:30.862 --> 00:05:33.186
so if you want to follow along
with the steps I'm doing,

118
00:05:33.186 --> 00:05:35.580
then I would suggest setting
up an account with Netlify.
