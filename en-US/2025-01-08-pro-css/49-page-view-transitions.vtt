00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.061
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: All right, so the first
progressive enhancement we're gonna be

2
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:04.853
taking a look at is view transitions.

3
00:00:04.853 --> 00:00:08.490
And I do want to just preface this
a little bit that we're only gonna be

4
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.887
touching on the basics
of view transitions.

5
00:00:10.887 --> 00:00:12.038
They're really cool.

6
00:00:12.038 --> 00:00:15.521
You can do awesome stuff with them
without getting deep into them.

7
00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:19.840
But it's also a huge and really deep topic
that if you like what we cover in here

8
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.777
I Strongly suggest you learn,
dive in and learn a bit more about them.

9
00:00:23.777 --> 00:00:25.580
And there's two important things.

10
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.894
There's two different
types of view transitions.

11
00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:31.458
There's same document view transitions and
cross document view transitions.

12
00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:33.476
We're gonna be looking at both of them.

13
00:00:33.476 --> 00:00:36.072
It's a fancy name,
same document to cross document.

14
00:00:36.072 --> 00:00:40.259
Just is it within the page and
you're updating things on the page?

15
00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:43.873
Or is it between page when you're
navigating from one page to another, so

16
00:00:43.873 --> 00:00:46.380
cross document is when you
use your navigation to go

17
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.036
to a completely different page.

18
00:00:48.036 --> 00:00:49.183
So it's a really deep topic.

19
00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:53.903
You can dive way more in, but we're
gonna start with adding a cross document

20
00:00:53.903 --> 00:00:57.887
view transition because this is
the easiest thing in the world,

21
00:00:57.887 --> 00:01:00.789
where in your CSS,
come all the way to the top.

22
00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.029
We'll do this in our base actually,
I'm gonna do it, it's an at rule.

23
00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:07.450
I'll just throw it at the very top.

24
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.137
I don't know where I would
actually put this and

25
00:01:13.137 --> 00:01:18.115
at view Transition Navigation Auto, and

26
00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:23.815
it's basically opt-in
by doing it like this.

27
00:01:23.815 --> 00:01:28.048
And so now, if I'm on my page and
I go to a different page,

28
00:01:28.048 --> 00:01:32.834
you can actually see it cross-fades
from one page to the other.

29
00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:37.454
And that's all I had to do was adding that
view transition at rule at the top of my

30
00:01:37.454 --> 00:01:39.416
page and the navigation of auto.

31
00:01:39.416 --> 00:01:41.351
There's nothing else, it just works.

32
00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:44.645
And the default is the cross
fade that we were seeing.

33
00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:50.378
You can control the two pages separately,
so the one exiting, the one entering.

34
00:01:50.378 --> 00:01:52.251
There's a lot you can do with this,

35
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:54.945
just to show you one of
the things you can do with it.

36
00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:59.774
It's called a view-transition-group.

37
00:01:59.774 --> 00:02:04.402
And it looks like this, it's kind of weird
looking, and I'm going to put root here,

38
00:02:04.402 --> 00:02:07.576
because I'm selecting the root
of my document right now.

39
00:02:07.576 --> 00:02:11.582
It is the HTML that we're looking
at that's transitioning between

40
00:02:11.582 --> 00:02:12.504
the two pages.

41
00:02:12.504 --> 00:02:18.979
And let's just do an animation
duration of three seconds.

42
00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.210
And so now, if I I switch between pages,

43
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.561
it takes three seconds to cross fade from
one to the other, nothing too fancy.

44
00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:29.450
I wouldn't suggest slowing it down by that
much, but it just shows you you're just

45
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.301
hooking into regular animations
the same way you do before.

46
00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:37.614
So you could do an animation that slides
one page in and slides the other one out.

47
00:02:37.614 --> 00:02:39.127
I'm doing a view transition group.

48
00:02:39.127 --> 00:02:43.755
So it's taking both the old page and
the new page, it's treating them as one.

49
00:02:43.755 --> 00:02:48.738
If you wanted different animations for
both of them,

50
00:02:48.738 --> 00:02:53.176
you have your view,
transition, old and new.

51
00:02:53.176 --> 00:02:57.726
So the new of the root is the new
page that you're navigating to.

52
00:02:57.726 --> 00:03:01.919
And the old one, if you did the old here,
would be the page that you're leaving.

53
00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.543
So you could do a transition in one
direction, transition for the other, and

54
00:03:05.543 --> 00:03:08.912
the pages could actually slide, or
you could do other things that way.

55
00:03:08.912 --> 00:03:11.708
We're not gonna dive too deep into them,
as I said,

56
00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:15.156
you can use animations to control
everything that's going on.

57
00:03:15.156 --> 00:03:18.235
I'm just going to leave
the default one there at the top,

58
00:03:18.235 --> 00:03:20.943
and if it's something you
want to use to enhance.

59
00:03:20.943 --> 00:03:24.626
It's the page, or play around with it
a little bit more, you definitely can.

60
00:03:24.626 --> 00:03:28.734
The other thing really quickly,
the root is a default one.

61
00:03:28.734 --> 00:03:32.124
You can also add view transition
names as a property to elements, and

62
00:03:32.124 --> 00:03:34.711
then you can transition
individual things as well.

63
00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:38.095
It gets really powerful, where you could
have, like, the name of a card that you're

64
00:03:38.095 --> 00:03:40.967
clicking on becomes the title somewhere
else, and it animates to that.

65
00:03:40.967 --> 00:03:42.474
Position and it just works out of the box.

66
00:03:42.474 --> 00:03:44.246
It's really, really cool and

67
00:03:44.246 --> 00:03:48.208
how easy it is just throwing this at
the top of the page and it working.

68
00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:51.140
You will notice that it gets a little
squiggly here because VSCode

69
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.272
doesn't recognize it.

70
00:03:52.272 --> 00:03:56.991
So we're getting a syntax error but
as we can see it does work.

71
00:03:56.991 --> 00:03:59.914
And this is a really nice progressive
enhancement cause if it doesn't work and

72
00:03:59.914 --> 00:04:01.607
the browser doesn't understand what that.

73
00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:06.073
That is, it doesn't break anything,
they just get a regular page load, and

74
00:04:06.073 --> 00:04:06.978
it just jumps.

75
00:04:06.978 --> 00:04:12.002
But if it does work, then it will
transition from one to the other,

76
00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:14.532
and it's a little busted there.

77
00:04:14.532 --> 00:04:20.428
Let's refresh the page and
hopefully get the transition coming in.

78
00:04:20.428 --> 00:04:22.503
We saw it before, we knew it works.

79
00:04:22.503 --> 00:04:27.448
[LAUGH] It doesn't wanna animate now,
I don't know what I did, there we go,

80
00:04:27.448 --> 00:04:28.308
it's back.

81
00:04:28.308 --> 00:04:35.274
So we can transition back and forth.
