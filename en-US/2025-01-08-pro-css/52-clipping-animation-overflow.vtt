00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.689
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: You'll
notice one thing here.

2
00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:05.014
This is, when I open the menu, it's fine.

3
00:00:05.014 --> 00:00:09.467
Look, I'm gonna click the button, but look
down here at the bottom of the page, and

4
00:00:09.467 --> 00:00:12.855
we're getting some overflow
while it's sliding off the page,

5
00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:14.315
which is kind of annoying.

6
00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:18.878
This is a question that comes up a lot,
where, if you have something that's

7
00:00:18.878 --> 00:00:22.819
overflowing in certain situations,
it can be kind of annoying.

8
00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:26.967
And a lot of time you just do body and
HTML overflow hidden x, and

9
00:00:26.967 --> 00:00:29.724
you hide the stuff going off the x-axis.

10
00:00:29.724 --> 00:00:31.007
That doesn't happen often,

11
00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:33.840
but you can actually run into weird
scroll ball issues with that.

12
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.920
I actually had a website at one point
that had double scroll bars and

13
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.234
I couldn't solve it, and
it was because of that.

14
00:00:39.234 --> 00:00:46.833
And the first thing a lot of people try is
on their, we're gonna come all the way up.

15
00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:48.652
I'm just gonna do this on my site header.

16
00:00:48.652 --> 00:00:50.738
It doesn't really matter that
it's not in the media query.

17
00:00:50.738 --> 00:00:53.523
What people try and

18
00:00:53.523 --> 00:00:59.041
do here is the overflow x of hidden.

19
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:03.828
And I'm also gonna give that a position
of relative, just because right now,

20
00:01:03.828 --> 00:01:07.238
the absolute position is
relative to the whole page, so

21
00:01:07.238 --> 00:01:09.937
it's not actually inside the site header.

22
00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:11.862
And now I get this.

23
00:01:11.862 --> 00:01:14.644
Has anyone ever run into
something like this before?

24
00:01:14.644 --> 00:01:16.175
Yeah.

25
00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:19.073
This is one of the most
infuriating things in CSS,

26
00:01:19.073 --> 00:01:22.320
where you're changing
the overflow in one direction.

27
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.579
But because of the way overflow hidden
works is it's creating a new scroll

28
00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:31.198
environment, so it actually changes
the scroll behavior in both directions.

29
00:01:31.198 --> 00:01:35.376
The default is visible when you do
an overflow x or an overflow y of hidden.

30
00:01:35.376 --> 00:01:39.847
The other axis gets switched to auto and
auto adds scroll bars to something.

31
00:01:39.847 --> 00:01:41.727
So in this doesn't work.

32
00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:43.453
[LAUGH] it's just really annoying.

33
00:01:43.453 --> 00:01:45.541
It just broke my whole thing.

34
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:48.829
Another thing,
this isn't a progressive enhancement.

35
00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.310
The new thing that not enough people know
about is we have an overflow of clip

36
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.927
now as well.

37
00:01:52.927 --> 00:01:57.598
The purpose of clip was to introduce non
scroll bar environments instead of the way

38
00:01:57.598 --> 00:01:58.283
it worked.

39
00:01:58.283 --> 00:02:00.615
And it works the way you would think.

40
00:02:00.615 --> 00:02:02.129
The overflow hidden would work.

41
00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:05.657
We're clipping the thing that's
overflowing so it's instead of hiding it,

42
00:02:05.657 --> 00:02:06.625
we're clipping it.

43
00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:09.736
It's like a clip path, and it just works.

44
00:02:09.736 --> 00:02:14.717
And it actually has a really cool bonus
feature that doesn't really make sense in

45
00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:18.452
what we're doing now, but
it also comes with a clip margin,

46
00:02:18.452 --> 00:02:22.501
which I don't really know how to
show you how it works in this one.

47
00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:24.802
But this means you can add or

48
00:02:24.802 --> 00:02:29.919
let's do it in both directions overflow,
y of clip as well.

49
00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:33.084
So this makes no sense here, but
since we're talking about it.

50
00:02:33.084 --> 00:02:36.583
So I'm clipping it in both directions,
so it's hidden.

51
00:02:36.583 --> 00:02:41.653
But if I do a clip margin of one rim,
overflow clip margin,

52
00:02:41.653 --> 00:02:46.120
and you can actually like
overflow by a little bit.

53
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.823
So I'm clipping it, but
I'm giving that that extra space,

54
00:02:48.823 --> 00:02:51.580
probably not something you're
going to need very often, but

55
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.885
I think it's a fun thing, so I just
wanted to slip it into the lesson here.

56
00:02:54.885 --> 00:02:57.663
But in this case,
I would just leave it just like that.

57
00:02:57.663 --> 00:03:04.638
And then we get this fun little
animation coming in and out like that.
