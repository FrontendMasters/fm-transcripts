00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: We've talked
a lot about custom properties and

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.211
set up a lot of custom properties.

3
00:00:04.211 --> 00:00:07.222
One thing is, especially right now,
we have our primitives and

4
00:00:07.222 --> 00:00:10.025
then we have the semantic ones,
and do we really need both?

5
00:00:10.025 --> 00:00:12.574
We'll look a bit about
the benefits of that.

6
00:00:12.574 --> 00:00:17.221
Another thing I'm very partial for doing
is using locally scoped custom properties

7
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:20.967
as well, and with wrappers is one
of the places I do like using them.

8
00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:25.514
With the wrapper, the benefits aren't
necessarily as big as within other areas.

9
00:00:25.514 --> 00:00:29.332
But I like doing this just because
when you're modifying things or

10
00:00:29.332 --> 00:00:31.990
changing things,
I find it's a lot easier for

11
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.776
people when they're coming through the
code to know exactly what they're doing.

12
00:00:36.776 --> 00:00:40.976
And I see locally scoped custom properties
a lot like Levers that you're opening up

13
00:00:40.976 --> 00:00:44.036
within the code for
somebody to be able to come in and change.

14
00:00:44.036 --> 00:00:47.645
You're saying, sort of anything
that has that locally scoped

15
00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:52.345
custom property is something within this
thing that is allowed to be tweaked, and

16
00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:54.750
those other things should be left alone.

17
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.936
So in this example,
we could come here and say,

18
00:00:58.936 --> 00:01:04.903
wrapper max width is 1130, and
then in the modifier down here,

19
00:01:04.903 --> 00:01:10.677
I would just modify that custom property,
so wrapper max width.

20
00:01:10.677 --> 00:01:17.428
And then, of course, this here would
have to get changed to the variable,

21
00:01:17.428 --> 00:01:21.946
var(--wrapper--max-width, like that.

22
00:01:21.946 --> 00:01:24.683
You could also not declare
the custom property here and

23
00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:26.181
put the fallback value here.

24
00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:28.990
There are times when that
can be beneficial, and

25
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.053
I would say it's a good thing to do.

26
00:01:31.053 --> 00:01:34.051
We'll see examples of that
a little bit later, but

27
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:36.501
I'm kind of partial to doing it this way.

28
00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:42.057
And so then for the narrow one,
we could take the same

29
00:01:42.057 --> 00:01:47.121
approach, data--width is equal to narrow.

30
00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:51.128
And here we can say the wrapper-max-width,

31
00:01:51.128 --> 00:01:54.836
I think it's 720 off the top of my head.

32
00:01:54.836 --> 00:01:58.825
But you can double-check that in
the figma file just to see what

33
00:01:58.825 --> 00:02:00.487
the size is actually are.

34
00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:04.597
I'm also getting an error right now, and
I noticed when I saved my code wasn't

35
00:02:04.597 --> 00:02:07.839
formatting, and I can see prettier
highlighting in red right

36
00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:10.973
now at the bottom,
that means I did something wrong [LAUGH].

37
00:02:10.973 --> 00:02:15.576
It could be a number of different things,
sometimes it's a missing semi colon.

38
00:02:15.576 --> 00:02:19.864
In this case, layout, you can see
the bracket has changed to red here.

39
00:02:19.864 --> 00:02:24.536
VS code again, default highlights brackets
so that's opened, then it should be close,

40
00:02:24.536 --> 00:02:25.399
close, close.

41
00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:30.723
I think I'm missing a closing
bracket here, save, and there we go.

42
00:02:30.723 --> 00:02:32.513
The prettier is no longer red, and

43
00:02:32.513 --> 00:02:35.663
I'm just trying to make sure
that this opening yellow one has

44
00:02:35.663 --> 00:02:39.699
a corresponding closing yellow one before
I get to my next layer right there.

45
00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.999
So if ever you are using Prettier, it's
been working the entire time and you do

46
00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:46.510
save something and the formatting doesn't
happen, the same would be in the HTML.

47
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.231
If you have a missing or an extra
closing div or something like that,

48
00:02:50.231 --> 00:02:52.137
you'll notice it doesn't work.

49
00:02:52.137 --> 00:02:56.332
If you click on Prettier here too,
it will open up in this bottom area, and

50
00:02:56.332 --> 00:02:59.511
this is all my settings of it,
but if there's an error,

51
00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:02.848
it actually tells you what the error is,
usually in here.

52
00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:08.833
Or gives you an idea of what the problem
might be, so I can help you out as well.

53
00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.424
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: With
those wrappers in place,

54
00:03:13.424 --> 00:03:16.542
I'll do this with you
guys at the same time.

55
00:03:16.542 --> 00:03:20.646
I'm just gonna go through and use all the
wrappers in the places I need them, and

56
00:03:20.646 --> 00:03:21.940
I am gonna make a change.

57
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.967
I was gonna save this to when we styled
the hero, we're gonna get there in a bit.

58
00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:29.752
But because the hero area does need
like this text at the top is wider, and

59
00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:32.271
then this text down here is narrower.

60
00:03:32.271 --> 00:03:37.560
It just means the easiest way to do that,

61
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.938
in my mind,
is to actually close this one here and

62
00:03:43.938 --> 00:03:50.471
then open up a new div with
a class equals wrapper,

63
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:55.468
and the data width is equal to narrow.

64
00:03:55.468 --> 00:04:00.227
For the data attribute things, I'll just
let you know I got that from CUBE CSS,

65
00:04:00.227 --> 00:04:03.937
which was by Andy Bell,
I mentioned him for the reset as well.

66
00:04:03.937 --> 00:04:09.228
And in the first lesson I talk about
the data attributes in the course website,

67
00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:14.862
there is a link that goes to the CUBE CSS,
which is a naming convention that he uses.

68
00:04:14.862 --> 00:04:17.032
That's where I got the data
attribute thing from,

69
00:04:17.032 --> 00:04:19.313
and I just fell in love with it and
continued using it.

70
00:04:19.313 --> 00:04:21.285
But he goes into much more detail and
use cases.

71
00:04:21.285 --> 00:04:25.284
But again, we'll see a few of
those as we go through here.

72
00:04:25.284 --> 00:04:28.485
So in doing that, I should be able to see.

73
00:04:28.485 --> 00:04:33.844
What we'll do is actually,
I wanna see my project at full screen,

74
00:04:33.844 --> 00:04:37.591
so I'm just gonna switch
to my other desktop.

75
00:04:37.591 --> 00:04:40.873
So, I can see we don't have center,
so looks a bit funky.

76
00:04:40.873 --> 00:04:45.583
But I can see this is fullscreen, and
then this part down here is narrower, so

77
00:04:45.583 --> 00:04:46.964
I know it's working.

78
00:04:46.964 --> 00:04:51.774
The next part, the wrapper is
completely fine for that area,

79
00:04:51.774 --> 00:04:54.650
I just need it to be the normal width.

80
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.810
This next one is narrower,
so I just have to find it.

81
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.194
There's the wrapper data
width is equal to narrow.

82
00:05:04.194 --> 00:05:08.087
I keep putting them outside
of my quotation marks,

83
00:05:08.087 --> 00:05:13.618
then the two columns, both of those
have the data width is equal to wide.

84
00:05:13.618 --> 00:05:18.600
And again, please don't feel you have to
use the data attributes if you really

85
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.431
don't like them, but I do encourage
trying different things to see how they

86
00:05:23.431 --> 00:05:28.209
come together for you on any given
project, and to see if you like it or not.

87
00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:33.460
So this looks good, our navigation,
actually, I think needs a wide one.

88
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.267
There we can see it's
all within our wrapper.

89
00:05:35.267 --> 00:05:37.211
Here we're in a wrapper that's wider, so

90
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:39.377
the image is sticking off
to the side of it more.

91
00:05:39.377 --> 00:05:45.538
We have the wide one there, and then the
little happy foraging down at the bottom,

92
00:05:45.538 --> 00:05:49.757
which I don't think we need a wrapper for
necessarily.

93
00:05:49.757 --> 00:05:53.918
So I'm just gonna come all
the way back up to the very top,

94
00:05:53.918 --> 00:05:57.127
where I have the wrapper here and, whoops,

95
00:05:57.127 --> 00:06:02.070
data-width = wide there, cuz,
again, if we look at our design,

96
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.718
the navigation does have the wide
wrapper on it, right there.

97
00:06:09.864 --> 00:06:12.487
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Any thoughts about
data attributes versus modifier classes?

98
00:06:12.487 --> 00:06:16.765
I'm always curious when everyone-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just mentioning that

99
00:06:16.765 --> 00:06:22.714
Andy Bell and Hayden's book, Relearn,
every layout is a great resource for

100
00:06:22.714 --> 00:06:26.116
responsive design focused on CSS and HTML.

101
00:06:26.116 --> 00:06:30.395
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Yes, every layout is
fantastic at highly recommend it to

102
00:06:30.395 --> 00:06:31.116
people.

103
00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:35.321
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: I try not to
mention Andy too much, but

104
00:06:35.321 --> 00:06:40.287
I've learned a lot of CSS through him,
so [LAUGH] it sneaks in quite a bit.

105
00:06:40.287 --> 00:06:43.228
And Hayden has some really
good resources too.

106
00:06:43.228 --> 00:06:46.726
Actually, [LAUGH] just a bit of
talking about landmark regions,

107
00:06:46.726 --> 00:06:48.615
we're gonna dive into those now.

108
00:06:48.615 --> 00:06:51.682
Hayden has a series on his,
so it's Hayden Pickering.

109
00:06:51.682 --> 00:06:55.788
He has a series on his blog talking
in depth on what the semantics of

110
00:06:55.788 --> 00:06:58.477
each one means, cuz semantics are hard and

111
00:06:58.477 --> 00:07:03.350
it's not always easy to know what each
one means, so you can check those out.

112
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.801
He does have a bit of a crude
sense of humor to put it politely.

113
00:07:05.801 --> 00:07:11.059
So you have to, if you like it, if you
like Monty Python and don't mind some

114
00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:16.824
vulgar words, you'll like his blog posts,
otherwise you might not, but yeah.

115
00:07:16.824 --> 00:07:19.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: One other kind of thought or
question.

116
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.802
Someone in the chat says, regarding
data attributes, I'm wondering how or

117
00:07:23.802 --> 00:07:26.254
if there's a way they can be enumerated.

118
00:07:26.254 --> 00:07:29.491
For example,
wide can be easily misspelled,

119
00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:32.569
can we make it more
declarative in some way?

120
00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:35.341
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: I don't know if
there's a difference between that and

121
00:07:35.341 --> 00:07:39.693
modifier classes, it's just what it is I
think when we're authoring these things.

122
00:07:39.693 --> 00:07:45.414
But yeah, you could, I mean, yeah,
I'm trying to think of an alternative,

123
00:07:45.414 --> 00:07:48.288
but I think it is what it is a little bit.
