00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.816
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: All right, next up,
we have a lot of things in place now.

2
00:00:03.816 --> 00:00:06.896
So I do think it's a nice time to get
the rest of the HTML on the page so

3
00:00:06.896 --> 00:00:08.821
then we can start going through things and

4
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:12.251
actually applying a lot of these
styles to everything that we're doing.

5
00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:16.799
And so what I would actually suggest
is you take about five minutes or so

6
00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:19.898
to start writing the HTML for
everything here.

7
00:00:19.898 --> 00:00:22.602
Don't worry so much about bringing
the content in right now,

8
00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:24.994
just look at how you think
you would organize the page.

9
00:00:24.994 --> 00:00:28.308
Think about the semantic elements you
would be using along the way as you're

10
00:00:28.308 --> 00:00:29.560
going through things here.

11
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.074
So looking at the big picture,
if you have time to bring in the content,

12
00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:34.019
that's awesome.

13
00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:36.559
How would you set this up?

14
00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.084
Think of the different things you need
along the way and plug all of those

15
00:00:40.084 --> 00:00:43.925
different things in there, if you need
any extra things, you can add those.

16
00:00:43.925 --> 00:00:48.009
I'm gonna go through all of it along
the way in a few minutes to put it all

17
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:52.111
together and explain a bit of my thought
process and how I like to do it.

18
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:54.158
But I think it'd be fun
if you do that first, so

19
00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:57.374
we'll give you about five minutes to
go through and just get it in there.

20
00:00:57.374 --> 00:00:59.529
Again, focus on getting
all the elements there and

21
00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:02.650
then if you have time you can start
putting in the content in there as well.

22
00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:09.849
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: All right, so
I'm gonna dive into the HTML now.

23
00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:14.384
And one question I often get when I'm
diving into this is mobile first desktop

24
00:01:14.384 --> 00:01:14.886
first.

25
00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:15.994
What do you look at?

26
00:01:15.994 --> 00:01:17.846
And it depends on what I'm doing.

27
00:01:17.846 --> 00:01:22.856
I wouldn't look at the mobile site if
I'm doing the HTML, cuz the complexity

28
00:01:22.856 --> 00:01:27.730
comes with the larger layout and
how things actually have to be organized.

29
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.731
The only time I'll reference
the mobile version is if I just want to

30
00:01:30.731 --> 00:01:32.782
know maybe there's the order could change.

31
00:01:32.782 --> 00:01:36.712
And often you'll see the actual order
it would be in the DOM by looking at

32
00:01:36.712 --> 00:01:37.903
the mobile version.

33
00:01:37.903 --> 00:01:42.301
But when I'm writing my HTML, I always
prefer looking at the larger one, just cuz

34
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:46.596
I wouldn't know I need three columns if
I was only looking at the mobile design.

35
00:01:46.596 --> 00:01:50.818
So looking at this first, just because
I already came in with a section,

36
00:01:50.818 --> 00:01:52.698
I can add a section right there.

37
00:01:52.698 --> 00:01:55.974
I'm not giving you the class yet,
we'll talk more about naming these,

38
00:01:55.974 --> 00:01:58.349
you might have already gone through and
named them.

39
00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:02.281
So if you did, that's great, I'll talk
more about how I decide on doing those

40
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:06.346
things when it comes to actually styling
these different sections that we have.

41
00:02:06.346 --> 00:02:10.605
Inside this one at the top,
I see I have an &lt;h2&gt;, after the &lt;/h2&gt;,

42
00:02:10.605 --> 00:02:12.682
I have what looks like a paragraph.

43
00:02:12.682 --> 00:02:15.322
And then after that,
I need to have three columns over here.

44
00:02:15.322 --> 00:02:17.778
So I have to decide how I'm gonna do that.

45
00:02:17.778 --> 00:02:19.591
There's obviously
different ways of doing it.

46
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:22.790
And I'm not exactly sure how I
wanna create my columns yet.

47
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.693
So what I'm gonna do is put a little
comment here to say I need three columns.

48
00:02:26.693 --> 00:02:30.686
And because I know I need three columns,
I'm just going to put a div and

49
00:02:30.686 --> 00:02:32.594
I'll put a class on there later.

50
00:02:32.594 --> 00:02:35.096
So if you already gave that a class name,
keep what you had,

51
00:02:35.096 --> 00:02:36.463
there's no harm in that at all.

52
00:02:36.463 --> 00:02:39.163
You had a plan so
stick with your plan for now.

53
00:02:39.163 --> 00:02:43.245
And for each one of those, we have a div,
I did mention earlier that I'm gonna call

54
00:02:43.245 --> 00:02:45.570
these cards,
I sort of plan that a little bit.

55
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.393
So I will give that the class of card,
which should go inside of there.

56
00:02:51.393 --> 00:02:52.496
For things like this,

57
00:02:52.496 --> 00:02:55.818
I do like creating one then just copy
pasting it cuz I find it faster.

58
00:02:55.818 --> 00:02:57.085
If you're good with Emmett,

59
00:02:57.085 --> 00:03:00.087
you could also build this a little
bit quicker using Emmett shortcut.

60
00:03:00.087 --> 00:03:05.713
But we'll do it the long way,
where at the top I have my image.

61
00:03:05.713 --> 00:03:09.731
Always remember for your images that
you want to come in with an src for

62
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:10.500
the source.

63
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.749
But if you want it to be valid, you do
need to have the alt on there as well.

64
00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:15.857
We do want to put some
meaningful text in those,

65
00:03:15.857 --> 00:03:19.669
that's sometimes the hardest part in doing
everything that we're doing right now.

66
00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:24.257
Because this is an &lt;h2&gt; this
down here will be an &lt;h3&gt; and

67
00:03:24.257 --> 00:03:29.565
then after my &lt;h3&gt; you can come in
with a paragraph underneath that.

68
00:03:29.565 --> 00:03:33.856
And then I can just take this card, copy
it and there's faster ways if you know

69
00:03:33.856 --> 00:03:37.700
your VS Code shortcuts and
you wanna do this faster that's awesome.

70
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.693
I can come through all of those and
do that.

71
00:03:39.693 --> 00:03:41.902
You'll notice I got self
closing tags on the images,

72
00:03:41.902 --> 00:03:43.433
that's Prettier doing that for me.

73
00:03:43.433 --> 00:03:47.190
You don't have to have those, but
Prettier self closes tags like that.

74
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.751
So that's that section done.

75
00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:51.769
Obviously, I'll bring the content in soon,
but we can do that pretty quickly.

76
00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.258
Then down here, we have another section,
and know I need another section,

77
00:03:55.258 --> 00:03:57.726
I'm just doing this based
on the background colors.

78
00:03:57.726 --> 00:04:01.723
But often you see clear demarcations
of different sections as you're

79
00:04:01.723 --> 00:04:03.425
going through a site anyway.

80
00:04:03.425 --> 00:04:06.797
This one needs an &lt;h2&gt;, and we'll talk
about the different coloured text,

81
00:04:06.797 --> 00:04:10.443
if you've already brought it in, used
span, stuff like that, that's fantastic.

82
00:04:10.443 --> 00:04:11.772
We have a paragraph after it,

83
00:04:11.772 --> 00:04:14.922
we have a few decisions we're gonna
have to make a little bit later on.

84
00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:20.386
So in this next section,
I do have an image that's in there,

85
00:04:20.386 --> 00:04:24.684
so I can put an image,
and I do need two columns.

86
00:04:24.684 --> 00:04:29.104
So actually, before I bring that in, I
probably should have done the same thing,

87
00:04:29.104 --> 00:04:32.641
where I say, this is going to be
two columns, and we can have div.

88
00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:39.537
And if you didn't know in VS Code, you can
select something and drag and drop it.

89
00:04:39.537 --> 00:04:42.525
So I want to have my image
inside that first one.

90
00:04:42.525 --> 00:04:44.171
So that's just creating a column.

91
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:47.696
If you have classes on there,
that's great, but that will be,

92
00:04:47.696 --> 00:04:51.964
actually we're gonna have a few levels
of divs here now that I think about it.

93
00:04:51.964 --> 00:04:55.973
Cuz this outer div here is what's
gonna be creating my columns,

94
00:04:55.973 --> 00:04:58.361
so there'll be flex or grid on there.

95
00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:03.507
And then this will be the column on
the left and then the column on the right,

96
00:05:03.507 --> 00:05:07.526
you have another div and
that div will have the heading 2.

97
00:05:07.526 --> 00:05:12.603
Whoops, will have a paragraph in there and
another paragraph.

98
00:05:12.603 --> 00:05:15.495
And one reason it like just doing
all of this room doing the structure

99
00:05:15.495 --> 00:05:18.705
first before copying and pasting,
the text is, it's just for me easier.

100
00:05:18.705 --> 00:05:21.377
I can focus on one thing
is just the structure, and

101
00:05:21.377 --> 00:05:23.104
then I can worry about the text.

102
00:05:23.104 --> 00:05:26.132
And I don't get lost about where I am or
anything else and

103
00:05:26.132 --> 00:05:29.303
I can focus a little bit more
on what I want to be focused on.

104
00:05:29.303 --> 00:05:35.726
And down here we have, I'm gonna do a link
that will be going nowhere for now.

105
00:05:35.726 --> 00:05:37.834
And I guess we'll give that a class,
a button.

106
00:05:37.834 --> 00:05:39.387
If you use an actual button,

107
00:05:39.387 --> 00:05:43.479
we will switch that over to a link cuz
it's gonna bring us to the other page.

108
00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.578
So that would be a class,
just because it does look like a button,

109
00:05:48.578 --> 00:05:52.488
it makes sense to give it that class,
there we go.

110
00:05:52.488 --> 00:05:55.297
And then this next one is
actually exactly the same.

111
00:05:55.297 --> 00:06:00.006
So I can just take that entire section,
paste it.

112
00:06:00.006 --> 00:06:02.614
And then I can move this
down just cuz we're

113
00:06:02.614 --> 00:06:05.011
switching the image to the other side.

114
00:06:05.011 --> 00:06:07.855
And so I can cut that or
if you know, again,

115
00:06:07.855 --> 00:06:11.890
the VS Code shortcuts to move
stuff around, you can do that.

116
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.183
And I can hit save there, and then at
the very bottom I have that footer, so

117
00:06:16.183 --> 00:06:19.730
I'm gonna come outside of the main and
down here do a footer.

118
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.803
And just like at the top of the page,
I had the primary or the site,

119
00:06:24.803 --> 00:06:29.064
I should say, so
I'm gonna do class = site-footer.

120
00:06:29.064 --> 00:06:32.166
I don't think we're gonna have other
footers in this project, but if ever you

121
00:06:32.166 --> 00:06:35.472
did have another footer, cuz footers could
be used in lots of different elements.

122
00:06:35.472 --> 00:06:40.151
They can be used in articles, in sections,
in accents and other things like that.

123
00:06:40.151 --> 00:06:44.887
So having a class on there just to
distinguish the styling of that

124
00:06:44.887 --> 00:06:46.562
part does make sense.

125
00:06:46.562 --> 00:06:49.292
And now we have the fun part of
bringing in all the content,

126
00:06:49.292 --> 00:06:50.985
which is just copying and pasting.

127
00:06:50.985 --> 00:06:52.425
But I'll do this pretty quick, and

128
00:06:52.425 --> 00:06:54.450
I'll talk about some of
the things along the way.

129
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:59.337
But hopefully everybody's been
learning a bit about mushroom foraging

130
00:06:59.337 --> 00:07:01.910
as they've gone through all of this.

131
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.701
A few things I didn't do right now so
far as I've been bringing

132
00:07:06.701 --> 00:07:11.322
this in is I haven't done anything
in regards to how my lay.

133
00:07:11.322 --> 00:07:14.328
Well, I put the divs for
the two columns and the three columns,

134
00:07:14.328 --> 00:07:16.391
I didn't put any containers or wrappers.

135
00:07:16.391 --> 00:07:19.256
Which is often, actually,
I'll say, a mistake.

136
00:07:19.256 --> 00:07:20.879
Did I do early on in projects?

137
00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:24.505
Even if I had the foresight for it,
I always forget to actually do it, but

138
00:07:24.505 --> 00:07:28.084
it's something that I wanna talk
a little bit about in a future lesson.

139
00:07:28.084 --> 00:07:31.032
So I left them out on purpose,
if you had containers or wrappers,

140
00:07:31.032 --> 00:07:33.618
please do leave them in there,
cuz we will be using them.

141
00:07:33.618 --> 00:07:38.134
There's other ways of approaching
things now, with grid as well, but

142
00:07:38.134 --> 00:07:42.514
I'm just gonna stick with the nice,
simple, basic way of doing it.

143
00:07:42.514 --> 00:07:46.540
With this text here, I'm gonna grab it and
you don't always have to see these things.

144
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.335
Sometimes when you're coming
through to style them after,

145
00:07:49.335 --> 00:07:50.554
you can figure these out.

146
00:07:50.554 --> 00:07:56.753
But right away when I bring that in there,
I'm just gonna add a &lt;span&gt; right there,

147
00:07:56.753 --> 00:08:00.212
just so
I don't forget that I actually need it.

148
00:08:00.212 --> 00:08:04.058
Even though it'd be easy enough to we can
bring that in if you know what class you

149
00:08:04.058 --> 00:08:04.827
want on there.

150
00:08:04.827 --> 00:08:07.443
If you think it needs a class, so
you're going to use a descendant selector.

151
00:08:07.443 --> 00:08:10.546
These are the types of things to be
thinking about while you're bringing this

152
00:08:10.546 --> 00:08:12.658
in, but I know I need to
change the color of the text.

153
00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:14.397
So I know I wanna throw a span on there.

154
00:08:14.397 --> 00:08:16.855
It didn't do that at the top of the page,
but

155
00:08:16.855 --> 00:08:20.585
that'd be something that we can
bring in and do a little bit later.

156
00:08:20.585 --> 00:08:22.448
Same thing with class names.

157
00:08:22.448 --> 00:08:25.615
I'm doing it on purpose in this order,
without any real classes and

158
00:08:25.615 --> 00:08:27.180
just focusing on the structure.

159
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.623
But if you already had, pre-plants and
class names and stuff like that at this

160
00:08:31.623 --> 00:08:36.486
stage, if you're putting them in there, it
does make your life a little bit easier.

161
00:08:36.486 --> 00:08:41.408
Cuz then when you start getting more CSS
on your page, it's going to look good

162
00:08:41.408 --> 00:08:45.886
right out of the box, cuz your styles
are already being applied to it.

163
00:08:45.886 --> 00:08:50.248
This one, I'm just gonna write it myself,
reference guide.

164
00:08:50.248 --> 00:08:53.244
We're gonna talk about these
links in just a second as well,

165
00:08:53.244 --> 00:08:54.964
cuz there's a problem with them.

166
00:08:54.964 --> 00:08:59.503
It's not a big problem but it's
an important problem to talk about, and

167
00:08:59.503 --> 00:09:03.013
something that people
aren't always aware of.

168
00:09:03.013 --> 00:09:08.726
This one only has one paragraph,
and that one is Learn More.

169
00:09:08.726 --> 00:09:14.761
Capital M makes my life easier and
then there's the footer at the bottom.

170
00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:17.620
I'm gonna talk about the images cuz I do
want to talk about alt text a little bit.

171
00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:22.379
We'll do a paragraph and a link here.

172
00:09:22.379 --> 00:09:25.494
If ever you have a website,
personal website or anything else,

173
00:09:25.494 --> 00:09:28.217
when you have an a href down here,
you can do the mailto.

174
00:09:28.217 --> 00:09:31.979
We're gonna do it this way, mailto: and
just paste in the email address.

175
00:09:31.979 --> 00:09:33.969
And it means if someone clicks on it,

176
00:09:33.969 --> 00:09:37.706
it will send them an email as long
as their systems configured for it.

177
00:09:37.706 --> 00:09:40.018
Just know that bots well scrape those.

178
00:09:40.018 --> 00:09:43.551
So if you put it there, you might
start getting some spam in your inbox.

179
00:09:43.551 --> 00:09:47.360
And there's ways using
JavaScript to insert it after or

180
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.098
to obfuscate it a little bit for
JavaScript purposes.

181
00:09:51.098 --> 00:09:56.775
Or using JavaScript to do that to prevent
the bots from getting it happy foraging.

182
00:09:56.775 --> 00:10:00.216
Cool, for the images,
I said we'd talk about it.

183
00:10:00.216 --> 00:10:03.350
So when you're doing your images, please,

184
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:07.398
please, please always come
in with meaningful alt text.

185
00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:11.358
So I did try to name the images
in a way that would be, so

186
00:10:11.358 --> 00:10:13.655
that's like outdoor I think.

187
00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:16.305
First I did do webp,
webp is widely supported,

188
00:10:16.305 --> 00:10:19.964
you can use webp images wherever you want,
there's no problem.

189
00:10:19.964 --> 00:10:22.579
But do try and
come in with somewhat meaningful alt text.

190
00:10:22.579 --> 00:10:24.291
Alt text serves a few purposes.

191
00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:29.151
If the image doesn't load for
some reason, then at least they'll have

192
00:10:29.151 --> 00:10:33.207
that text explaining what
the image they should be seeing.

193
00:10:33.207 --> 00:10:37.062
It's also for assistive technology, is not
everybody's going to see those pictures

194
00:10:37.062 --> 00:10:39.192
and it reads the context
of the picture to them.

195
00:10:39.192 --> 00:10:46.994
So this could just be "A tightly grouped".

196
00:10:46.994 --> 00:10:52.325
This is always fun coming
up with this actually.

197
00:10:52.325 --> 00:10:55.842
And I will say,
I'm not a huge fan of AI for some stuff.

198
00:10:55.842 --> 00:10:59.456
They can write decent alt text but do
verify cuz they sometimes don't know what

199
00:10:59.456 --> 00:11:02.976
they're actually looking at, so
don't copy paste it without reading it.

200
00:11:02.976 --> 00:11:10.375
Tightly grouped brown mushrooms
growing up the base of a,

201
00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:17.480
or growing up a mossy tree trunk,
something like that.

202
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.624
Something that gives
a little bit of meaning and

203
00:11:19.624 --> 00:11:21.562
can describe the picture appropriately.

204
00:11:21.562 --> 00:11:25.688
For people, goes a really long way, and
it doesn't take that long to write.

205
00:11:25.688 --> 00:11:28.544
I've seen even there's a really good
blog post I don't have a link to it,

206
00:11:28.544 --> 00:11:29.526
I just thought of it now.

207
00:11:29.526 --> 00:11:33.816
But about how playing D&amp;D
can make you write better,

208
00:11:33.816 --> 00:11:38.975
better alt text, because you get
better at describing things.

209
00:11:38.975 --> 00:11:43.435
And so just, I'm gonna do them
pretty short for now, just so

210
00:11:43.435 --> 00:11:48.869
we don't spend too much time, so
just put "Wild mushrooms on a table".

211
00:11:48.869 --> 00:11:54.448
But the more descriptive your alt text is,
it's always going to be better.

212
00:11:54.448 --> 00:11:57.497
You'll also notice, I'm doing the forward
slash here at the beginning of my source,

213
00:11:57.497 --> 00:12:00.187
you don't need to include it,
it's still gonna work in this environment.

214
00:12:00.187 --> 00:12:02.585
Some builds require you to have that.

215
00:12:02.585 --> 00:12:05.417
If you're using and
doing other things, a lot of the time,

216
00:12:05.417 --> 00:12:08.350
you'll be going to the root cuz when
you have that build step in there,

217
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.856
it's a little bit different
than what we're doing today.

218
00:12:10.856 --> 00:12:14.062
This will work here, but if you omit
it and you just say assets like that,

219
00:12:14.062 --> 00:12:15.232
it's also going to work.

220
00:12:15.232 --> 00:12:19.512
So whichever you prefer for
today's is completely fine.

221
00:12:19.512 --> 00:12:23.335
/culinary,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And

222
00:12:23.335 --> 00:12:28.180
we'll just do "A plate of
food with mushrooms on top".

223
00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:33.498
Just so again, we're going kind of fast
through this and we only got two more.

224
00:12:33.498 --> 00:12:35.483
So it's not too bad.

225
00:12:35.483 --> 00:12:41.050
This is "/assets/get-to-know" and

226
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:46.307
"A man on his hands and knees harvesting

227
00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:50.647
a wild mushroom in the forest".

228
00:12:50.647 --> 00:12:56.541
And this last one down here two columns

229
00:12:56.541 --> 00:13:01.145
"/asset/" and connect,

230
00:13:01.145 --> 00:13:05.577
maybe nature, there it is.

231
00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:10.579
"A small white mushroom growing

232
00:13:10.579 --> 00:13:15.768
on a mossy forest floor", okay.

233
00:13:15.768 --> 00:13:17.596
Something like that, there we go.

234
00:13:17.596 --> 00:13:18.920
So as far as everything,

235
00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.333
we should be able to go look you
see if you have any broken images.

236
00:13:22.333 --> 00:13:25.515
You can see if you made any
mistakes along the way as well.

237
00:13:25.515 --> 00:13:32.396
So always go and look at your project, cuz
I have my button that I wanna take out,

238
00:13:32.396 --> 00:13:36.732
but trim that we do not need anymore,
there it is.

239
00:13:36.732 --> 00:13:39.721
I can delete that button from there,
and I can just go through to make sure

240
00:13:39.721 --> 00:13:41.835
everything's loading in
all my images are there.

241
00:13:41.835 --> 00:13:46.323
And at least just make sure your site's
looking half-decent at this stage and

242
00:13:46.323 --> 00:13:48.301
at least all the content is there.

243
00:13:48.301 --> 00:13:52.346
And by having those base styles already
in place, it should already look ok-ish.

244
00:13:52.346 --> 00:13:54.929
Because at least we have that base
that setting up the stage for

245
00:13:54.929 --> 00:13:56.924
everything else that
we're going to be doing.
