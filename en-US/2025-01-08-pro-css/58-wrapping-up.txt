>> Kevin Powell: And with that, I just wanna say congratulations on making it to the end of this course. It was only a two-page site. We covered tons of material. There was a lot in here, a lot that you might wanna go over, a lot that you might wanna practice.

[00:00:11]
But just yeah, congratulations on making it to the end and getting through this entire thing. And take the time to go through everything, to adjust everything. Don't jump right into another project. You can, of course, if you want to. But take the time to just digest everything, and then see, slowly, how you can start using these different things in different ways, and just integrating some of the ideas, hopefully, that you learned along the way here.

[00:00:32]
Because as much as possible, what I wanted to show is that CSS can both be maintainable and just a lot of fun to author. And so the early parts can take a little bit of setup, but that setup really pays off once you're starting to put more and more content on the page.

[00:00:45]
And then those fun flourishes, and other things that we can add at the end just to make the user experience a little bit more exciting and all of that. So I really do hope that you enjoyed it. I really enjoyed going through all of this with you. Yeah, so go out there and just remember to keep on making your corner of the Internet just a little bit more awesome.
