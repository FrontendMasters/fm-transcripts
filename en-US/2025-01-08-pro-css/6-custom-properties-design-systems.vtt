00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.574
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So, in our Figma design,
we have two sections colors and

2
00:00:03.574 --> 00:00:06.850
typography that are just
taking all of the styles and

3
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.252
variables that are in the Figma file and
making them easy for us to see.

4
00:00:11.252 --> 00:00:15.949
You also have in Markdown files the values
of all of these if you just wanna copy and

5
00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.523
paste a little bit
faster in creating them.

6
00:00:18.523 --> 00:00:22.465
But whenever we have these types of
things, it's usually a really good sign

7
00:00:22.465 --> 00:00:25.871
that you should just make some
custom properties in your own CSS.

8
00:00:25.871 --> 00:00:28.321
Just cuz it means these are the colors,
the font sizes, and

9
00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:31.274
other things that are gonna be reused
throughout your entire project.

10
00:00:31.274 --> 00:00:34.724
Again, we're thinking big picture,
we're setting things up for

11
00:00:34.724 --> 00:00:36.065
a little bit of a success.

12
00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:39.962
I will say, I call this a design system,
anybody who's watching this right now,

13
00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:43.197
who does design system work,
is going that's not a design system.

14
00:00:43.197 --> 00:00:45.885
This is a very simplistic
version of one but

15
00:00:45.885 --> 00:00:48.431
it's the type of a very simple version.

16
00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:52.534
But if you were in a larger design system
a lot of the same things we're talking

17
00:00:52.534 --> 00:00:56.845
about today will apply, but it just would
take a lot more work to set up properly.

18
00:00:56.845 --> 00:01:01.250
So we're gonna keep it with a very simple
design system setting up through custom

19
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.039
properties.

20
00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.595
So you might in the real world run into
much more robust versions than what we're

21
00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:08.232
looking at in today's one.

22
00:01:08.232 --> 00:01:11.596
The other thing is, a lot of the time
if you are working in a company and

23
00:01:11.596 --> 00:01:13.858
they do have a much more
robust design system,

24
00:01:13.858 --> 00:01:16.132
you'll be set up working
with what they have.

25
00:01:16.132 --> 00:01:20.630
But a lot of the time you'll have a client
throwing you a design file they happen to

26
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.475
get from a designer somewhere
that has nothing, or

27
00:01:23.475 --> 00:01:25.674
you'll get a file similar to this one.

28
00:01:25.674 --> 00:01:28.411
So it really depends on the environment
you're working and everything else.

29
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:32.366
But I wanna look at, when you are thrown
into this type of one, how you can work,

30
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:35.515
cuz again, the lessons will apply
on larger projects as well.

31
00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:40.652
And specifically for the colors in
this one, what I wanna look at is

32
00:01:40.652 --> 00:01:46.370
purposely did it in ways that I run into
a lot when I run into the real world.

33
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.373
So if we go and
look at the Figma file actually,

34
00:01:49.373 --> 00:01:54.001
it's in the top left, if you do go in
there you can open the JPEG as well.

35
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:58.029
If you do come in and take a look at
things, the naming of them is terrible.

36
00:01:58.029 --> 00:02:01.779
So we have a brown, that zoomed out
more than I planned on it, we have like,

37
00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:05.075
brown-1, brown-2, brown-3,
brown-4, brown-5.

38
00:02:05.075 --> 00:02:08.424
Then we have a primary color,
then we have accent dark,

39
00:02:08.424 --> 00:02:12.791
accent light, we have a gray, a white,
a red, a burnt orange, a teal.

40
00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:16.085
So the naming is a little bit
inconsistent along the way,

41
00:02:16.085 --> 00:02:17.946
the typography is a lot better.

42
00:02:17.946 --> 00:02:21.996
But one thing to notice with
the typography that's important is

43
00:02:21.996 --> 00:02:26.505
we have the mobile sizes here and
the font families that are being used.

44
00:02:26.505 --> 00:02:29.116
There is the title one here that
only has one font size, and

45
00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:32.540
if we come take a look at the desktop
version, there's two different ones.

46
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.507
And that's cuz in our hero section we have
the really big font at the top that has

47
00:02:36.507 --> 00:02:37.903
two different font sizes.

48
00:02:37.903 --> 00:02:41.037
But on mobile that it's actually
one size being used for

49
00:02:41.037 --> 00:02:45.114
both, we'll look at how we can tackle
that type of thing in a little bit.

50
00:02:45.114 --> 00:02:47.298
But we're gonna start
with the colors first,

51
00:02:47.298 --> 00:02:50.660
just cuz I wanna talk a little bit
about how I'm gonna be naming things.

52
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.143
And if you are in Figma like we are now,
and my UI is super small at the moment,

53
00:02:56.143 --> 00:02:59.573
I'm not sure it's smaller
than it usually is,

54
00:02:59.573 --> 00:03:03.282
maybe I can zoom in,
nope, that's interesting.

55
00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:08.349
But when you're in there, again,
you can control click or in this case I am

56
00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.747
actually giving you the hex codes and
the HSL and everything else that's here.

57
00:03:13.747 --> 00:03:17.041
On the side menu you'll
also see the color and

58
00:03:17.041 --> 00:03:20.254
you can get values from
those areas as well.

59
00:03:20.254 --> 00:03:23.678
Yeah, but
the easiest might be just coming in,

60
00:03:23.678 --> 00:03:27.883
grabbing either the hex codes or
grabbing the HSL values.

61
00:03:27.883 --> 00:03:30.223
Whichever one you wanna work in, and

62
00:03:30.223 --> 00:03:33.557
VS code makes it easy to
switch between them as well.

63
00:03:33.557 --> 00:03:38.432
Really fast if you wanna know more about
Figma as well front end masters does have

64
00:03:38.432 --> 00:03:40.992
a course on Figma that kind covers it all.

65
00:03:40.992 --> 00:03:44.130
So if you're poking around in here,
you're not super comfortable,

66
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.211
but you do wanna learn more about it,
you can check out that course and

67
00:03:47.211 --> 00:03:48.986
learn a bit more about how Figma works.

68
00:03:48.986 --> 00:03:49.840
But for today,

69
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.130
we don't need to get too much other than
the specific values that are in here.

70
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.219
So, how can we do it?

71
00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.676
Well, we'll copy this color right here,
just to start with, and

72
00:04:00.676 --> 00:04:04.689
I'm gonna copy that this is a choice
you're actually gonna have to make too,

73
00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.551
when you start coming in
with your custom properties.

74
00:04:07.551 --> 00:04:12.978
I asked people what they like to do, and
I got varying responses, some with layers.

75
00:04:12.978 --> 00:04:17.313
Some people like having a layer for
root or to be your custom,

76
00:04:17.313 --> 00:04:20.384
even custom props, something like that.

77
00:04:20.384 --> 00:04:24.402
If you wanna separate those, you
definitely can name it whatever you would

78
00:04:24.402 --> 00:04:28.500
like to name it, I have the habit of
just including it within my base styles.

79
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.995
We're gonna run into some weird syntax
highlighting issues in VS code when we

80
00:04:31.995 --> 00:04:33.992
do this that you'll see
a little bit later.

81
00:04:33.992 --> 00:04:38.325
But for now, I'm just gonna throw it in my
base styles, just cause it's my own habit.

82
00:04:38.325 --> 00:04:42.020
But definitely if you think that deserves
its own layer you could put it in there.

83
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.299
We're not gonna run into specificity
issues with the custom properties,

84
00:04:47.299 --> 00:04:49.739
so it's whatever you would like.

85
00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:51.485
And how I like to name my colors,

86
00:04:51.485 --> 00:04:54.472
when I don't have a color
system that exists already.

87
00:04:54.472 --> 00:04:56.382
So personal project that you're doing or

88
00:04:56.382 --> 00:05:00.099
you have a disaster of a design file now
where the names are really inconsistent.

89
00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.650
My main thing is I start with a clr for
color, I also will see after,

90
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.189
whoops, that's not what I wanted.

91
00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:11.103
I also have a prefix ff for
font family, fs for font size,

92
00:05:11.103 --> 00:05:15.753
anything like that, just cause it
makes it a little bit easier, and

93
00:05:15.753 --> 00:05:20.509
we'll see different ways that makes
our life easier within VS Code.

94
00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.485
I put the name, so in this case,
we'll stick with brown,

95
00:05:24.485 --> 00:05:29.453
we're gonna come in with the different
types of names you can also have.

96
00:05:29.453 --> 00:05:32.716
Yeah, anyway, we'll come in with
the different types of names we

97
00:05:32.716 --> 00:05:35.998
can have in a little bit, but
when you have a color brown like this.

98
00:05:35.998 --> 00:05:40.150
The system we were just looking at in
Figma, we had brown-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but

99
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.612
then we have a primary light.

100
00:05:41.612 --> 00:05:44.009
We have the primary dark and other things,

101
00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:48.550
it's nice to have a consistent naming
system and consistent numbering system.

102
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.890
I tend to do my colors all based off
of 500, with 500 being my quote,

103
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.077
unquote, middle ground one, and
then I would have a lighter version.

104
00:05:59.077 --> 00:06:05.516
Would be a clr-brown-400,
could be the slightly lighter one,

105
00:06:05.516 --> 00:06:10.742
and then a clr-brown-600,
would be a darker one.

106
00:06:10.742 --> 00:06:17.148
The reason I use 500 for my middle ground
is because that gives me 4,3,2,1 going up,

107
00:06:17.148 --> 00:06:22.921
and then a 6,7,8,9 going down, so I end
up with an equal amount on both sides.

108
00:06:22.921 --> 00:06:26.169
I also don't do 1,2,3,4,5,
which could definitely work,

109
00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:27.992
I know a lot of people who work that way.

110
00:06:27.992 --> 00:06:32.595
But if ever you get a new color added,
it's easy to come in here and

111
00:06:32.595 --> 00:06:37.888
do a clr-brown-450, and squeeze
an extra one in there if you have to.

112
00:06:37.888 --> 00:06:41.668
It's not gonna happen often,
but you never know, so

113
00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:44.784
I like doing it with my
numbering like that.

114
00:06:44.784 --> 00:06:49.441
The one weird thing that I do though
is I look at, if we come back to here,

115
00:06:49.441 --> 00:06:53.575
with all these browns that I have,
I don't have a light brown.

116
00:06:53.575 --> 00:06:57.978
I don't want this to be my middle brown,
cuz in my mind,

117
00:06:57.978 --> 00:07:00.998
if new colors were added to this site.

118
00:07:00.998 --> 00:07:05.479
Or new browns were added, they'd
probably be lighter than this one, and

119
00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:09.107
this would probably be my darkest
one all the way over here.

120
00:07:09.107 --> 00:07:13.978
So if I grab this one,
I'd actually have that

121
00:07:13.978 --> 00:07:18.856
darkest one as my --clr-brown-900.

122
00:07:18.856 --> 00:07:24.112
And I would go from there, the other thing
is, I do like having all my colors in HSL.

123
00:07:24.112 --> 00:07:26.513
It's just my own habit,
cuz then it makes it easy for

124
00:07:26.513 --> 00:07:28.213
me to adjust things if ever I have to.

125
00:07:28.213 --> 00:07:32.389
In VS code, if you hover over the little
color blocks that should automatically be

126
00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:34.642
coming in,
it shows you get a color picker.

127
00:07:34.642 --> 00:07:36.471
But if you click on
the hex code at the top,

128
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:39.243
it will change it and
cycle through the different color modes so

129
00:07:39.243 --> 00:07:41.926
you can switch things to the HSL
really easily if you want to.

130
00:07:41.926 --> 00:07:46.949
For this, it's really a little bit of
an approach to going through them,

131
00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:48.417
I was nice to you all.

132
00:07:48.417 --> 00:07:50.936
And if you come into the lesson page,

133
00:07:50.936 --> 00:07:55.659
I did provide the colors I'll be
using with the names I'll be using.

134
00:07:55.659 --> 00:07:59.484
If you do wanna copy and paste them
instead of having to get each one directly

135
00:07:59.484 --> 00:08:02.474
from Figma, it's good to know
how to get them from Figma.

136
00:08:02.474 --> 00:08:06.141
But yeah, just to speed everybody up, I
think that's one of those things we're not

137
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:08.584
learning much by copying and
pasting 15 values over.

138
00:08:08.584 --> 00:08:13.460
So if you do wanna grab them from
the course page, you can do that,

139
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.128
and just paste them in right there.

140
00:08:16.128 --> 00:08:18.992
The one thing you'll notice
is I did do a white here,

141
00:08:18.992 --> 00:08:21.540
you could also do a I
often call these neutral.

142
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.156
So neutral 100, and
my white is often a neutral 000, but

143
00:08:25.156 --> 00:08:28.926
the naming here could change
depending on how you wanna set it up.
