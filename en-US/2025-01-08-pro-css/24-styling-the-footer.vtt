00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.755
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: All right.

2
00:00:00.755 --> 00:00:02.791
Now we can move on down to our footer,

3
00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:05.495
probably the simplest
part of this entire page.

4
00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:08.818
So if we come take a look again at
the Figma design has a little bit

5
00:00:08.818 --> 00:00:10.723
of a darker background color to it.

6
00:00:10.723 --> 00:00:14.818
Text is centered, so you could definitely
use some utility classes here.

7
00:00:14.818 --> 00:00:15.998
It's finding that balance.

8
00:00:15.998 --> 00:00:17.544
Do you wanna throw a few utilities on it?

9
00:00:17.544 --> 00:00:20.131
Just remember that you need those
every time you have a footer.

10
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:24.261
Or in this case, when I created it,
I already threw a site footer class on

11
00:00:24.261 --> 00:00:27.199
there, so
I'm just gonna use a site footer class.

12
00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.072
There's a few things that we'd have to
select as children in here as well.

13
00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:34.755
Like this paragraph needs to be
different from the link that's here.

14
00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:37.780
So, you also have to decide
how you're gonna do that.

15
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.824
We need to control the spacing
between things, so

16
00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:42.124
there's a few things on here
we're going to have to do.

17
00:00:42.124 --> 00:00:46.928
I'm gonna give this a class and
it's kind of weird,

18
00:00:46.928 --> 00:00:50.429
but I will call it a site footer title.

19
00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.149
I'm keeping it as a paragraph just cuz I
don't feel like a heading semantically

20
00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:56.776
makes sense to have there.

21
00:00:56.776 --> 00:00:59.902
You could probably make an argument
that it should be a heading.

22
00:00:59.902 --> 00:01:02.850
But I'm gonna do it just as
a paragraph like that and

23
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.253
keeping that same title system we've
been using since the very beginning.

24
00:01:07.253 --> 00:01:09.715
So whatever element you use,
it doesn't matter.

25
00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:13.965
And then we can just come down,
this one you could argue whether,

26
00:01:13.965 --> 00:01:17.920
a little bit actually we have
our site header and all of this.

27
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.424
So again, I think it makes sense.

28
00:01:19.424 --> 00:01:23.194
You could say, should this go in layout,
just cuz it's kind of generic in a way,

29
00:01:23.194 --> 00:01:27.031
but it's specific enough on this one thing
that only lives on one part of the page.

30
00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:30.267
And just for organizational purposes,
cuz I have my header stuff here,

31
00:01:30.267 --> 00:01:32.452
I do like putting my footer
stuff with it as well.

32
00:01:32.452 --> 00:01:37.071
I put it after my navigation, just cuz
my navigation lives inside my header.

33
00:01:37.071 --> 00:01:39.041
It's just the way I organize things.

34
00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:43.542
If you have a different way of doing that,
that's fine, but I sorta I like keeping

35
00:01:43.542 --> 00:01:47.931
the footer header stuff altogether,
because it makes it easier for me to find.

36
00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:49.855
Some people prefer
the footer at the bottom,

37
00:01:49.855 --> 00:01:52.650
cuz the footer is the last thing
on every page, so it's up to you.

38
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.173
Site footer, text align center.

39
00:01:59.173 --> 00:02:01.792
It looks like it needs a bit of padding.

40
00:02:01.792 --> 00:02:05.664
I'm gonna just do some padding on
there and not use the section padding,

41
00:02:05.664 --> 00:02:07.133
cuz it looks kind of small.

42
00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:12.875
32 pixels, which would be 2rem or
32 pixels.

43
00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:15.699
And again, that's only padding
on the top and the bottom.

44
00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:19.360
So we can do padding block or
you can use the shorthand.

45
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.818
Padding block works for me there.

46
00:02:21.818 --> 00:02:27.495
And I'm gonna do a display
of grid with a gap of 2rem.

47
00:02:27.495 --> 00:02:29.641
And whenever I see a space like this,

48
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:34.223
this could fall apart if the footer got
updated and I'd have to refactor this.

49
00:02:34.223 --> 00:02:37.506
For me, this is the easiest way just
to put a big space between them and

50
00:02:37.506 --> 00:02:40.235
the spacing's the same through here,
here, and here.

51
00:02:40.235 --> 00:02:42.998
So that, to me, just makes a lot of sense.

52
00:02:42.998 --> 00:02:44.550
Flexbox do the same thing.

53
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.238
It's one less line of code with grid,
so I like using grid for it.

54
00:02:47.238 --> 00:02:50.208
The last thing, also with my padding,

55
00:02:50.208 --> 00:02:54.529
I'll put a background here,
and it's a bit darker, but

56
00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:59.585
not too dark, so I'm pretty sure
it's just the background dark.

57
00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:04.311
And then we can go take a look at what
that's given us, it looks pretty good.

58
00:03:04.311 --> 00:03:13.746
Site__footer_title, font-size,

59
00:03:13.746 --> 00:03:19.679
let's just go look here.

60
00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:26.676
That's only 20, so
I think that's the font-size medium.

61
00:03:28.461 --> 00:03:31.103
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And
the font-family is the heading.

62
00:03:32.844 --> 00:03:40.341
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And
then the font-weight is bold 700.

63
00:03:42.992 --> 00:03:46.015
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: There we go,
I think that looks pretty good.

64
00:03:46.015 --> 00:03:46.938
Should it be medium?

65
00:03:46.938 --> 00:03:48.814
Maybe the lg works a bit better there.

66
00:03:48.814 --> 00:03:51.612
And we have a footer that's come in.

67
00:03:51.612 --> 00:03:53.597
And the link at the bottom looks okay, but

68
00:03:53.597 --> 00:03:55.936
the color of it should
actually be a bit lighter.

69
00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:58.666
So I'm just gonna nest this
within my site footer,

70
00:03:58.666 --> 00:04:01.659
cuz I only wanna get just
a descendant selector anyway.

71
00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.902
And it's easier than giving it a class,
a color is,

72
00:04:05.902 --> 00:04:12.763
this is one of the problems with higher
specificity on anything, even with layers.

73
00:04:12.763 --> 00:04:17.526
High contrast, if I do this,
we've lost our hover state that was on

74
00:04:17.526 --> 00:04:21.049
there because we're
overwriting those styles.

75
00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.801
So I just need to come in and
bring in the hover and focus again.

76
00:04:27.951 --> 00:04:29.533
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And in this case,

77
00:04:29.533 --> 00:04:34.499
we'll just go back to the link
color that we had before.

78
00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:37.565
This shouldn't be high contrast.

79
00:04:37.565 --> 00:04:42.225
This should be the text-main, there we go.

80
00:04:42.225 --> 00:04:46.646
And then this one could go
back to our text-brand-light.

81
00:04:47.672 --> 00:04:50.756
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And
we get the light color coming on, but

82
00:04:50.756 --> 00:04:55.762
it's faded out compared to the links
we had at the top of the page.

83
00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:59.736
And with that, I think that's
all we need for our footer, and

84
00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:04.791
the page is coming together really,
really nicely with matching our layout.

85
00:05:04.791 --> 00:05:08.516
We just have this I'm gonna fix those
utility classes in a second on there, and

86
00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:10.615
then we can look at
getting our site online.

87
00:05:10.615 --> 00:05:14.643
All right, so for the card titles on here,
I just mentioned they were way too big.

88
00:05:14.643 --> 00:05:18.973
I just chose the wrong font size when
I was setting up the card title here.

89
00:05:18.973 --> 00:05:22.995
With the font-size-heading-regular
should have been the heading-small.

90
00:05:22.995 --> 00:05:26.736
And if we set that to
the heading-small right there,

91
00:05:26.736 --> 00:05:31.821
now it looks much better and much closer
to what we actually want it to be.

92
00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:36.130
So a quick fix there, and now we can
look at how we can get our site online.
