00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.152
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So
with all of those animations,

2
00:00:01.152 --> 00:00:03.427
all these other things that we've done,
it's all really cool.

3
00:00:03.427 --> 00:00:06.556
And we can do a lot of really nice user
experience things with all of these.

4
00:00:06.556 --> 00:00:08.767
Again, some of these
are progressive enhancements, so

5
00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:10.065
it might not work for everybody.

6
00:00:10.065 --> 00:00:13.861
But at least as the browsers
are improving and time goes on, more and

7
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:15.736
more people get access to those.

8
00:00:15.736 --> 00:00:19.384
Another thing that you can do to help
enhance your user experience is through

9
00:00:19.384 --> 00:00:20.812
some other customizations.

10
00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:24.185
And I wanted to talk a lot about
customizations from all those custom

11
00:00:24.185 --> 00:00:26.507
properties we set up
from the very beginning.

12
00:00:26.507 --> 00:00:30.665
And there's two different ways we can look
at how those customizations can benefit.

13
00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:33.876
One of them is so you can just turn
these things into new things and

14
00:00:33.876 --> 00:00:35.660
have fun with it and customize it for

15
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.714
new projects and take pieces from this and
do more with them.

16
00:00:38.714 --> 00:00:41.162
The other one is for
improving the user experience,

17
00:00:41.162 --> 00:00:43.729
potentially by bringing in
other themes to your site.

18
00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:44.992
This site is a dark theme.

19
00:00:44.992 --> 00:00:49.633
I'm a fan of dark themes, and I'm also
gonna take this fade-in animation off,

20
00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:52.991
cuz I don't think it helps
the user experience right now.

21
00:00:52.991 --> 00:00:55.992
But dark themes,
a lot of people love them.

22
00:00:55.992 --> 00:00:58.213
A lot of people,
especially long-form websites,

23
00:00:58.213 --> 00:00:59.785
they actually prefer light themes.

24
00:00:59.785 --> 00:01:03.249
So I wanna look at how we can
leverage everything we've

25
00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:06.571
done to easily be able just
to do some quick theming.

26
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:10.456
A proper light theme would require
a little bit more than what we're gonna do

27
00:01:10.456 --> 00:01:11.851
in the time we have now, but

28
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:14.965
I think it'll just highlight
how easy it is to make changes.

29
00:01:14.965 --> 00:01:19.199
And this could also be changes at a
different level as well where if you don't

30
00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:23.168
like the color theme that this website
has and you wanna just adjust it,

31
00:01:23.168 --> 00:01:26.497
it's gonna be very easy to do
those types of things as well.

32
00:01:26.497 --> 00:01:29.175
So if we come into our base layer here,

33
00:01:29.175 --> 00:01:32.776
where we had all of those
custom properties set up,

34
00:01:32.776 --> 00:01:38.502
this is really where the payoff comes from
having these tokens that we have here.

35
00:01:38.502 --> 00:01:42.755
And then having the more semantic
properties we have down here,

36
00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:45.760
cuz I don't wanna necessarily touch these.

37
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.452
I think these are great,
they're gonna do their job.

38
00:01:48.452 --> 00:01:52.529
The only limitation we have right now is
we don't really have enough colors for

39
00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:53.346
a light theme.

40
00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:58.279
So I'm actually gonna copy these and
paste them right here, and come in and

41
00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:03.602
just change these really fast,
100, 200, 300, 400 and we don't

42
00:02:03.602 --> 00:02:08.572
need another 5 just to give myself some
more tokens to be able to work with.

43
00:02:08.572 --> 00:02:10.871
And this is where having
these tokens at the top and

44
00:02:10.871 --> 00:02:12.909
then we use them in
different ways later on.

45
00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.588
This is also why I like HSL, cuz with HSL,
I can just tweak these values really easy.

46
00:02:17.588 --> 00:02:21.712
So maybe this is a 90%.

47
00:02:21.712 --> 00:02:25.743
And again, you'd wanna do a little
bit more of a careful job here and

48
00:02:25.743 --> 00:02:27.884
come up with something that works.

49
00:02:27.884 --> 00:02:31.591
I'm just eyeballing and throwing some
numbers at a board right now, and

50
00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:33.856
we'll see what it actually will look like.

51
00:02:33.856 --> 00:02:37.613
So having these light browns and
the dark browns in

52
00:02:37.613 --> 00:02:42.451
there will enable me now to be able
to come in with a custom theme.

53
00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:44.762
And we can just use a media query for
this.

54
00:02:44.762 --> 00:02:48.946
So let's come down here where we
have this version of everything,

55
00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:52.467
which is our default theme,
and I'm gonna include it.

56
00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:54.781
I'll do it after the colors and before.

57
00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:56.162
No, I'll just do it at the bottom,

58
00:02:56.162 --> 00:02:58.198
cuz it'll break the syntax highlighting,
if not.

59
00:02:58.198 --> 00:03:05.501
So @media and
we can do we prefers-color-scheme.

60
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:09.720
And because my system is set to dark,
I'm gonna put this to light.

61
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.468
We already created the dark theme,
the default is the dark theme.

62
00:03:12.468 --> 00:03:14.108
So we're gonna say light right there.

63
00:03:14.108 --> 00:03:16.630
So it just depends on the operating
system level at this point.

64
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.521
If the operating system
is set to a light theme,

65
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:20.613
they'll get the light
colors we're gonna create.

66
00:03:20.613 --> 00:03:24.403
If it's set to the dark theme, they get
the default ones we've already done.

67
00:03:24.403 --> 00:03:27.956
The one thing I will caveat with this
is if you're going to actually create

68
00:03:27.956 --> 00:03:30.822
a separate theme,
the media query is probably not enough,

69
00:03:30.822 --> 00:03:34.859
cuz a lot of people like dark themes, but
prefer reading long form in light themes.

70
00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.996
So having a manual toggle to go back and
forth between them is probably something

71
00:03:38.996 --> 00:03:43.257
you'd wanna do, simple button toggle
somewhere on your site that you could add,

72
00:03:43.257 --> 00:03:44.634
just a JavaScript class.

73
00:03:44.634 --> 00:03:48.547
Then that goes on the body that
toggles between the two, and

74
00:03:48.547 --> 00:03:53.653
it just changes the custom properties
the same way we're changing them now.

75
00:03:53.653 --> 00:03:57.389
And then we could just come in,
let's start.

76
00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.731
We'll start with these groups here,
so the background colors.

77
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:04.352
And this is, again, why I like having
these different levels of things.

78
00:04:04.352 --> 00:04:10.510
Because now in my light theme,
my extra light would just be my brown-100,

79
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.920
my light can be my brown-200,
this can now be my brown-300,

80
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.548
my brown-400 and guess that one
we'd have to play with extra dark.

81
00:04:21.548 --> 00:04:23.672
We'll see what happens,
we'll try it at 500 again.

82
00:04:23.672 --> 00:04:26.285
I'm experimenting a little
bit as I do this.

83
00:04:26.285 --> 00:04:28.619
And I don't really wanna change
my system preferences right now,

84
00:04:28.619 --> 00:04:29.714
cuz that's a pain in the butt.

85
00:04:29.714 --> 00:04:33.069
It takes a little while to do, and then
my whole system goes to a light theme.

86
00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:39.030
So if you open up your dev tools and
you push, not that, Ctrl+Shift+P,

87
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.567
Comd+Shift+P on a Mac,
you can write emulate light.

88
00:04:43.567 --> 00:04:48.078
And let's make that a bit bigger and
try that again so we can see what we did.

89
00:04:48.078 --> 00:04:49.920
Ctrl+Shift+P emulate, and

90
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.967
you can see you can actually emulate
all of these different things.

91
00:04:53.967 --> 00:04:58.420
So I wanna emulate a prefers-color-scheme:
light, and I can see that that's actually

92
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.246
come in, and I have a light
theme on my website right now.

93
00:05:01.246 --> 00:05:04.963
Now, some things are a little bit broken,
but hey, it's working and

94
00:05:04.963 --> 00:05:06.727
we've gotten some of that done.

95
00:05:06.727 --> 00:05:08.313
Part of the problem is the text colors,
but

96
00:05:08.313 --> 00:05:10.045
I've only changed background colors so
far.

97
00:05:10.045 --> 00:05:16.098
So I could also now come up to here,
grab, not those ones,

98
00:05:16.098 --> 00:05:21.121
but grab these right here, copy that,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Come

99
00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:24.163
down into this media query,
paste those in.

100
00:05:24.163 --> 00:05:30.260
And now this one my text-main would
probably be better off to be my brown-700.

101
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:38.692
It's a nice dark brown, my high-contrast
would be my clr-brown-900, let's say.

102
00:05:38.692 --> 00:05:43.857
You can see some changing, actually the
brand ones would probably stay the same.

103
00:05:43.857 --> 00:05:47.545
So we can stick with those, and you can
see it's not the nicest site in the world,

104
00:05:47.545 --> 00:05:49.348
but it's looking a little bit better.

105
00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:51.510
There's a few problems that
have come up by doing this,

106
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.403
we'll look at how we can
address what these are.

107
00:05:53.403 --> 00:05:57.699
But you can see quickly we're coming
through and being able to theme things.

108
00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:04.065
I am actually gonna change another one
here, which is that background accent.

109
00:06:04.065 --> 00:06:08.634
I think we'll change it to the var,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: No

110
00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:11.748
maybe that wouldn't work.

111
00:06:11.748 --> 00:06:12.832
Let's just go look fast.

112
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.564
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: The dark and the light
naming here still makes sense, but

113
00:06:17.564 --> 00:06:20.064
we'd almost wanna inverse them,
I'm not gonna do it for now.

114
00:06:20.064 --> 00:06:23.549
But it's the type of thing where you
start seeing these different areas, and

115
00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:26.925
we'll look at how we can solve this
problem with the dark text here anyway,

116
00:06:26.925 --> 00:06:29.357
cuz we have the same problem
that's happening here.

117
00:06:29.357 --> 00:06:32.037
But it just shows for
these other areas where we had those other

118
00:06:32.037 --> 00:06:35.180
background colors, we can quickly come in,
we can quickly retheme it,

119
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.981
but we're not changing those other
values that were at the top.

120
00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:41.151
We leave all of those tokens
alone that we created here.

121
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.867
And we're just reusing them
in different ways, and

122
00:06:43.867 --> 00:06:47.458
it opens up the easy way to add all
of the customizations that we need.

123
00:06:47.458 --> 00:06:50.361
Maybe you need a few extra tokens,
cuz you need lighter or

124
00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:52.493
darker colors to work with along the way.

125
00:06:52.493 --> 00:06:53.901
But by having this split,

126
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:58.381
it means I can change my background color
without changing what brown-900 is.

127
00:06:58.381 --> 00:07:02.346
Cuz if I change brown-900, it could have
big ramifications across my entire site.

128
00:07:02.346 --> 00:07:06.109
Whereas if I'm only changing that
one variable in this one situation,

129
00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:08.689
it just makes it a little
bit easier to work with.

130
00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:10.181
And you get that separation, so

131
00:07:10.181 --> 00:07:13.287
you can have a lot more customization
in how you're doing things.

132
00:07:13.287 --> 00:07:17.508
So to that end, actually, it probably
would be worth coming in here and again,

133
00:07:17.508 --> 00:07:19.213
creating a few more variables.

134
00:07:19.213 --> 00:07:23.947
So I'd encourage you, once we're done
with this course, to come through and

135
00:07:23.947 --> 00:07:27.319
potentially build out one or
multiple other themes, or

136
00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:29.270
just change the default theme.

137
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.626
If you don't feel like doing it, but

138
00:07:31.626 --> 00:07:35.285
trying to leave as many of
these here as they already are.

139
00:07:35.285 --> 00:07:38.537
And then just coming through and
making some changes or

140
00:07:38.537 --> 00:07:42.933
creating new tokens if you need them,
I'm gonna make a lighter one here.

141
00:07:42.933 --> 00:07:46.866
Let's say this is 69, something like that.

142
00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:53.232
So then what I could do is in my
light theme, we get down to there.

143
00:07:53.232 --> 00:07:59.044
The background-accent-main could actually
go to one of the lighter colors,

144
00:07:59.044 --> 00:08:02.873
just so everything gets
a little bit easier to read.

145
00:08:02.873 --> 00:08:06.825
So let me make color
green-300 just as an example.

146
00:08:06.825 --> 00:08:10.216
I don't think that would be the value
I'd wanna keep in this situation,

147
00:08:10.216 --> 00:08:12.051
that's my dark one, actually, right?

148
00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:14.647
Let's just say dark, there we go.

149
00:08:14.647 --> 00:08:16.958
So we can quickly just come in and
make a change to that so

150
00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.943
we're improving the readability and
making sure everything works.

151
00:08:19.943 --> 00:08:22.506
And so one of the problems that can
come with these types of things, though,

152
00:08:22.506 --> 00:08:25.369
when you've switched your dark theme and
everything could be looking pretty good.

153
00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:28.903
But you run into these situations where
some of the text you don't actually want

154
00:08:28.903 --> 00:08:29.702
it to be changed.

155
00:08:29.702 --> 00:08:33.794
So you can see here where we can't read
the text in my hero, cuz it has a dark

156
00:08:33.794 --> 00:08:38.231
background image, and the text going
dark could potentially be problematic.

157
00:08:38.231 --> 00:08:40.817
So one way that we can deal
with that is instead of, and

158
00:08:40.817 --> 00:08:43.462
this could be something you
set up from the beginning or

159
00:08:43.462 --> 00:08:47.333
it could just be on a case by case basis,
depending on how you're doing things.

160
00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:51.542
But in, let's go find, or here's the hero
right here where I have the color, and

161
00:08:51.542 --> 00:08:54.725
this is the color of my text
that's coming through right now.

162
00:08:54.725 --> 00:08:59.241
And what we could do is have this as
actually two separate colors that

163
00:08:59.241 --> 00:09:04.483
are possible, and we can do that through
a light-dark, that's right here.

164
00:09:04.483 --> 00:09:08.964
And in the light-dark, it's going to
set the color, if it's the light,

165
00:09:08.964 --> 00:09:11.473
you're giving it two different colors.

166
00:09:11.473 --> 00:09:14.352
You're giving it the color for
the light theme and the dark theme.

167
00:09:14.352 --> 00:09:18.176
So just to highlight how this is working,
cuz it's a little bit hard to see when we

168
00:09:18.176 --> 00:09:21.227
have this high contrast here, but
I could do this as red or blue.

169
00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:24.444
And so in doing that we can
see the red text is coming in.

170
00:09:24.444 --> 00:09:26.086
But if we were using our variables here,

171
00:09:26.086 --> 00:09:28.225
we could either just put
them both to the dark theme.

172
00:09:28.225 --> 00:09:33.149
So it's gonna stick with the dark one, or
I could just enforce color-scheme: dark,

173
00:09:33.149 --> 00:09:37.414
and then it's always going to take
the darker of the colors that are there.

174
00:09:37.414 --> 00:09:40.709
So depending on how you're
setting things up through it,

175
00:09:40.709 --> 00:09:44.475
if you need to enforce different colors,
the combination of using

176
00:09:44.475 --> 00:09:47.990
the light-dark for
your colors could be really beneficial.

177
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:52.463
And then you could come through and just
pick the right one specific color schemes

178
00:09:52.463 --> 00:09:55.972
in specific places where you
wanna enforce that along the way.

179
00:09:55.972 --> 00:10:00.075
So for your variables as well, instead
of setting them all up the way I've been

180
00:10:00.075 --> 00:10:04.052
doing now with the split ones, your color
set always to the light and dark and

181
00:10:04.052 --> 00:10:08.188
then force different ones, depending
on where you need those to be enforced.

182
00:10:08.188 --> 00:10:13.842
And so let's just fix this, so
it's using our dark color or

183
00:10:13.842 --> 00:10:16.906
our light color, I should say.

184
00:10:16.906 --> 00:10:21.838
In this case, I would actually
probably just come in with the token,

185
00:10:21.838 --> 00:10:26.601
or another option, too,
if you always need it to be a light color,

186
00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:29.089
is just to use the original token.

187
00:10:29.089 --> 00:10:33.587
If we take that off, and I take off that
it's not necessarily the best way to go,

188
00:10:33.587 --> 00:10:37.281
but that's another simpler option too,
where you can just say,

189
00:10:37.281 --> 00:10:40.934
in this one situation,
I just need it to always be a light color.

190
00:10:40.934 --> 00:10:43.422
I don't want it to switch
depending on the different things.

191
00:10:43.422 --> 00:10:45.282
So there's a few different
options you can take,

192
00:10:45.282 --> 00:10:46.975
find the one that you feel works best for
you.

193
00:10:46.975 --> 00:10:50.223
So with all of that, then that's just some
quick customizations that you can make.

194
00:10:50.223 --> 00:10:53.388
But as we looked at with our cards and
with the potential for our buttons and

195
00:10:53.388 --> 00:10:56.723
some other things, you can definitely
make a lot more customizations here.

196
00:10:56.723 --> 00:10:58.413
So you can add more theming to your site,

197
00:10:58.413 --> 00:11:01.662
you can add more pages to the site using
these things that you've been using.

198
00:11:01.662 --> 00:11:04.871
You can use the custom properties from
there to tweak the way things look,

199
00:11:04.871 --> 00:11:07.877
add more custom properties into
everything you've been doing along

200
00:11:07.877 --> 00:11:10.960
the way to tweak things even more,
just to make them even more robust.

201
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.628
And a lot of what we've done here worked
in this project, but it could be things

202
00:11:14.628 --> 00:11:18.645
that you take outta this project and build
into other projects as well, and use them.

203
00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:21.263
For the equal columns,
the auto fill and the auto fit, and

204
00:11:21.263 --> 00:11:24.736
a lot of the other things we've done
the way the custom properties are set up,

205
00:11:24.736 --> 00:11:27.703
those are things that don't just
have to live in isolation here.

206
00:11:27.703 --> 00:11:30.298
And that you don't have to recreate
over and over again, even if they

207
00:11:30.298 --> 00:11:33.027
do require a little bit of tweaking if
you pull them out of this project and

208
00:11:33.027 --> 00:11:34.090
put them into another one.

209
00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:38.296
It can be a really nice template or
base file that you just take to customize,

210
00:11:38.296 --> 00:11:42.194
do what you want with and reuse in
a lot of different ways along the way.
