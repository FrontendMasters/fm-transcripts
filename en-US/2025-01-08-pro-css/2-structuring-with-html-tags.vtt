1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So if we come here, I
said we're gonna do the navigation first.

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:09.678
One thing that I do like to do so we can
just do a header at the top of the page.

3
00:00:09.678 --> 00:00:13.330
And I'll talk more about this a little bit
later when we start doing some styling.

4
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.195
But on the header that's
at the top of my page,

5
00:00:16.195 --> 00:00:20.754
I always give this a class of either
site-header or primary-header, or

6
00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:23.711
something like that,
just to distinguish it.

7
00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:27.129
In this project I don't necessarily know
if we'll have multiple headers or not, but

8
00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:30.320
header is one of those types of elements
that could be used in different places.

9
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.054
So just having a class on
there could be useful.

10
00:00:33.054 --> 00:00:37.174
So I'm gonna go with site-header,
if you like primary-header, come up with

11
00:00:37.174 --> 00:00:41.361
a name that makes sense, just to say it's
the one that's at the top of your page.

12
00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:43.372
In there, we can have a nav.

13
00:00:43.372 --> 00:00:45.903
Once again,
I like having a class on that one too,

14
00:00:45.903 --> 00:00:49.533
because nav is another element that
you can reuse in different places.

15
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:54.838
And I'm gonna call this one [LAUGH]
just for fun, primary-header.

16
00:00:54.838 --> 00:00:58.974
And so I have a site-header, ooh,
sorry, not primary-header, primary-nav,

17
00:00:58.974 --> 00:01:00.035
or navigation even.

18
00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:05.179
I am someone who, let's just make
this a bit bigger for everybody.

19
00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:09.769
You'll see I have site-header and then
primary-navigation [LAUGH] class names

20
00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:13.628
are very vibe based as well,
as long as it distinguishes what it is.

21
00:01:13.628 --> 00:01:16.399
If you have multiple navs,
you might have a primary one,

22
00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.181
you might have a table of contents,
you might have a bread crumbs and things.

23
00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:23.425
As long as the names distinguish what
they're doing well, I think it's fine.

24
00:01:23.425 --> 00:01:27.552
And site-header, site-navigation could
work as well, but this is just the naming

25
00:01:27.552 --> 00:01:30.663
convention I've got used to over
the years, so I stick with it.

26
00:01:30.663 --> 00:01:35.764
In here, we can come in with a &lt;ul&gt;,
&lt;li&gt;, and

27
00:01:35.764 --> 00:01:42.662
an &lt;a href =""&gt;, and
we'll just close that off so we have that.

28
00:01:42.662 --> 00:01:46.344
And I can bring that in with actually,
this is the home page, so I could just do

29
00:01:46.344 --> 00:01:49.930
a forward slash, and then it would just
bring me to the root of the project.

30
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.566
And I forgot my logo, we'll bring that
in in a second, but we'll do Discover.

31
00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:59.815
Then the next one over,
let's just go look sorry,

32
00:01:59.815 --> 00:02:02.623
we have the mushroom guide and
then the FAQ.

33
00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:07.353
So I can just copy that,
paste it a couple of times,

34
00:02:07.353 --> 00:02:11.102
Discover, Mushroom Guide and the FAQ.

35
00:02:11.102 --> 00:02:14.163
And because these two don't exist yet,

36
00:02:14.163 --> 00:02:18.315
I am just gonna put those as
placeholder links for now.

37
00:02:18.315 --> 00:02:21.254
Bu some people like putting what
the page will eventually be or

38
00:02:21.254 --> 00:02:22.957
where the link will eventually go.

39
00:02:22.957 --> 00:02:25.952
You can do that if you want, I just like
being able to poke on round on stuff,

40
00:02:25.952 --> 00:02:27.155
even if the page isn't done.

41
00:02:27.155 --> 00:02:31.747
So, for now, I'm gonna use
some placeholders right there.

42
00:02:31.747 --> 00:02:35.204
And as I mentioned,
I also forgot to bring in the logo.

43
00:02:35.204 --> 00:02:41.236
So outside of my navigation,
I will bring in an image here.

44
00:02:41.236 --> 00:02:44.840
And my image will just go to my assets,
and in my assets,

45
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.926
I think it's just, is it logo?

46
00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:47.844
Nope.

47
00:02:47.844 --> 00:02:49.834
What did I call it?

48
00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:56.095
fungi-finders.svg, and because it is
an image, we do have an alt here.

49
00:02:56.095 --> 00:03:00.279
I'm of the mind most of the time that
logos don't necessarily need to have

50
00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:02.107
an alt, you can leave it blank.

51
00:03:02.107 --> 00:03:06.639
Just because images that are decorational
can have blank alts on them.

52
00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.342
You do wanna have an alt, and we'll talk
more about this, I think, a little bit

53
00:03:10.342 --> 00:03:14.130
later, cuz you always have to have an alt
attribute on an image for it to be valid.

54
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.727
But if you leave it blank, it's just
declaring that it's a decorational one.

55
00:03:17.727 --> 00:03:22.239
I wouldn't put fungi-finders logo in
this case, if you are gonna put some.

56
00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.400
And I think in this case, it does
make sense to have, so we could put

57
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.246
Fungi Finders just like that, cuz that's
the text that's in the image anyway.

58
00:03:29.246 --> 00:03:32.290
So it's describing what it's doing.

59
00:03:33.918 --> 00:03:37.332
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So there are a few
other things that we might need in

60
00:03:37.332 --> 00:03:38.726
here along the way.

61
00:03:38.726 --> 00:03:40.252
So if you have other bits that you did,

62
00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:42.661
don't change yours necessarily
to match what I have here.

63
00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:46.178
I'm gonna be using it a little bit to talk
about later on when we start actually

64
00:03:46.178 --> 00:03:47.756
making the layout come together.

65
00:03:47.756 --> 00:03:51.007
So if you had something to help with
layout purposes, that's awesome.

66
00:03:51.007 --> 00:03:56.083
But just having the image, the nav, and
everything else in there's fantastic.

67
00:03:56.083 --> 00:03:58.935
One thing I noticed as I was
doing this is my indentation

68
00:03:58.935 --> 00:04:02.407
is really big cuz this is the default
indentation from VS Code, but

69
00:04:02.407 --> 00:04:04.765
it also means Prettier is not working for
me.

70
00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:08.307
So if I go back to here and I hit Save,
my formatting is not getting changed.

71
00:04:08.307 --> 00:04:12.087
And I said that prettier might need
to have, if you've just installed it,

72
00:04:12.087 --> 00:04:16.110
you've never used it, I can see Prettier
down here, that's actually there.

73
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.527
It looks like it's working, but
it's not actually doing anything.

74
00:04:18.527 --> 00:04:21.020
So if that's the case you want
to go into your Settings.

75
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.746
If you go all the way down to the bottom,
you can get into your Settings right

76
00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:25.924
there, or, as I said,
I use the shortcut for everything.

77
00:04:25.924 --> 00:04:29.259
So the shortcut is just a Ctrl
back tick or if you're on Mac,

78
00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:30.873
it'd be command back tick.

79
00:04:30.873 --> 00:04:35.078
When you're in there, you can just look
up formatting or format maybe, and

80
00:04:35.078 --> 00:04:38.440
you'll see Default Formatter
is the default for it is none.

81
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.335
So when I'm in there I can go through and

82
00:04:40.335 --> 00:04:43.100
I can actually just choose
Prettier from the list there.

83
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.470
And I also want Format On Paste on and

84
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.793
Format On Save on just cuz
it makes my life easier.

85
00:04:48.793 --> 00:04:52.499
And with all of that done in there,
if I hit Save now,

86
00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:54.707
it formats everything for me.

87
00:04:54.707 --> 00:04:59.111
Prettier does default to having two
spaces instead of four for the tabs.

88
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:00.711
So if that's not something you like,

89
00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:03.017
I think that is one thing
that you can actually adjust.

90
00:05:03.017 --> 00:05:05.669
But Prettier is an opinionated formatter,
so

91
00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.415
it does have some things that you
can do in the settings to modify.

92
00:05:09.415 --> 00:05:12.980
But there's a lot of opinions that are
baked into it that you just sort of have

93
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:13.660
to live with.

94
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.611
And you can also get configuration files
and do a lot more with Prettier, but

95
00:05:17.611 --> 00:05:21.398
we're just going to ride with
the defaults for what we're doing today.

96
00:05:21.398 --> 00:05:26.174
As far as this next section down here,
there's a lot of different ways you might

97
00:05:26.174 --> 00:05:29.828
have written your HTML here,
and they're probably right.

98
00:05:29.828 --> 00:05:33.675
I'm gonna do a section, but if you
don't have a section, if you did a div,

99
00:05:33.675 --> 00:05:35.279
it probably doesn't matter.

100
00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:40.041
One thing people don't know about
sections is they're basically divs.

101
00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:45.025
They have semantic meaning to them, but
the main reason we use things like nav and

102
00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:50.008
other pieces or nav or header or footer,
a side, article is they actually become

103
00:05:50.008 --> 00:05:54.002
landmark regions,
which we'll talk about a little bit later.

104
00:05:54.002 --> 00:05:59.075
Sections are considered a landmark region,
but they only get that extra power to

105
00:05:59.075 --> 00:06:04.167
them if you add an area attribute in here,
which we'll see a little bit later on.

106
00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:06.724
But if you just use a section like this,
it's more for yourself.

107
00:06:06.724 --> 00:06:10.624
I often do this just cuz I find it
easier to have sections than just

108
00:06:10.624 --> 00:06:14.972
divs everywhere, but if you're
using a div, you're probably okay.

109
00:06:14.972 --> 00:06:18.528
In there, when I'm doing this,
I often just write my HTML first, and

110
00:06:18.528 --> 00:06:21.739
then I copy paste the text in,
I find it's a little bit easier.

111
00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:26.462
And in this case,
we can just copy paste three paragraphs,

112
00:06:26.462 --> 00:06:29.116
it's nothing too complicated.

113
00:06:29.116 --> 00:06:33.078
Again, Ctrl or
Cmd + Click into your text, copy it.

114
00:06:33.078 --> 00:06:38.307
We can paste that it in and remove
unusual line terminations, yes please.

115
00:06:38.307 --> 00:06:41.210
We shouldn't get that too often,

116
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.624
I think I did a one place
that would have that, oops.

117
00:06:45.624 --> 00:06:50.156
The other thing, I have word wrap off,
as you can notice.

118
00:06:50.156 --> 00:06:54.746
I think I'm on a different
keyboard again today, so

119
00:06:54.746 --> 00:07:01.751
I might not remember which key it is, but
if you do an Alt + Z, it should toggle.

120
00:07:01.751 --> 00:07:05.391
Oops, not that one, there it is, you
can Alt + Z will toggle your Word Wrap,

121
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:05.961
on and off.

122
00:07:05.961 --> 00:07:08.948
I don't know what that is on a Mac,
I do apologize.

123
00:07:08.948 --> 00:07:10.276
For when you're doing it,

124
00:07:10.276 --> 00:07:13.404
I just often have it off cuz I find
it's a lot easier to look at it.

125
00:07:13.404 --> 00:07:17.288
But when you save you can see Prettier
is also making a few changes there,

126
00:07:17.288 --> 00:07:20.354
just cuz it's limiting the total
line length of things.

127
00:07:20.354 --> 00:07:22.627
Just cuz often code,
if you have really long lines of code,

128
00:07:22.627 --> 00:07:23.954
it can be really hard to read them.

129
00:07:23.954 --> 00:07:26.053
So Prettier by default
limits line lengths,

130
00:07:26.053 --> 00:07:28.049
even if it's just text like we have today.

131
00:07:28.049 --> 00:07:31.339
But this actually makes it
easier to also come in and

132
00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:36.479
change the text if ever you need to cuz
the paragraph tags are on separate lines.

133
00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:39.306
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What do you think
about using the main tag for

134
00:07:39.306 --> 00:07:40.995
that portion of the page?

135
00:07:40.995 --> 00:07:43.646
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: A main tag
would be a good idea to have.

136
00:07:43.646 --> 00:07:47.707
If I were going to do the main, or
actually we're gonna have a main so

137
00:07:47.707 --> 00:07:48.860
we can do that now.

138
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.916
Where I'd bring a main in and
then have the main closing down here.

139
00:07:53.916 --> 00:07:57.090
And having the section in there,
just cuz if I look at the design,

140
00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.604
let's make that a bit bigger.

141
00:07:58.604 --> 00:08:01.033
The generally header
all the way at the top,

142
00:08:01.033 --> 00:08:03.331
footer all the way down at the bottom, and

143
00:08:03.331 --> 00:08:07.481
everything else here I would have as
part of the main content around there.

144
00:08:07.481 --> 00:08:09.111
Yeah, definitely a good call, thank you.

145
00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:13.630
We're talking about landmark regions and
I didn't have my main in there.

146
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.950
So if you had, again, other divs, other
things in here, maybe to hold the content,

147
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.841
that's awesome,
we're gonna need those eventually.

148
00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:23.607
So you could have come in with
some wrappers or some containers,

149
00:08:23.607 --> 00:08:25.977
I'm gonna save that for
a little bit of a later lesson.

150
00:08:25.977 --> 00:08:28.160
If you already have them in place,
leave them in place,

151
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.168
you don't have to match it
exactly like I have now.

152
00:08:30.168 --> 00:08:31.683
I just wanted to have
something on the page.

153
00:08:31.683 --> 00:08:36.839
So when I look at it we have something
there and then we start adding some CSS,

154
00:08:36.839 --> 00:08:42.175
at least we can see that we're having
some sort of impact on what we're doing.
