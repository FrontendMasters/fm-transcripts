00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.362
There in this idea of trying to be
generic, and this actually goes well with

2
00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:07.770
the question of when do you
wanna use utility class or not?

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.175
It's if we look in this, and this might
be a little bit of foreshadowing for

4
00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:12.971
something that will run into later on.

5
00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:17.521
Is that when we look at our images,
all of the images we have,

6
00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:21.562
every single one of them has
a border radius on there.

7
00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:24.606
So these images have it,
but it's a bit smaller.

8
00:00:24.606 --> 00:00:28.409
And then we have these images here that
have a larger border radius on them.

9
00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.831
So one thing we can do, and
you see this, and there's something,

10
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.126
it's just everywhere.

11
00:00:33.126 --> 00:00:37.158
Do I really wanna go on every single
image within my entire thing and

12
00:00:37.158 --> 00:00:40.187
add a utility class to it
to give it a round corner?

13
00:00:40.187 --> 00:00:42.848
Maybe not [LAUGH].
So it is something that you could decide

14
00:00:42.848 --> 00:00:45.734
that it actually makes
more sense to come in and

15
00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:50.399
just do a really generic selector, so
we could go all the way up to our base.

16
00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.147
Another thing that's nice with
layers is you can just search within

17
00:00:54.147 --> 00:00:57.629
your code base for your layer name,
so you can find it fast, and

18
00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.341
you're not searching
through your whole code.

19
00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:06.582
So in my base layer,
you potentially could come in and

20
00:01:06.582 --> 00:01:13.667
just say that all of your images
have a border radius on them.

21
00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:16.945
And we have some var border radius,

22
00:01:16.945 --> 00:01:21.324
I think it's three,
which is our biggest one.

23
00:01:21.324 --> 00:01:24.577
We might need to modify that on
the smaller ones we have that are in

24
00:01:24.577 --> 00:01:28.152
the cards later on, but then I just
get a border ES on every one of them.

25
00:01:28.152 --> 00:01:32.884
So sometimes, when you're going through,
if you see something that you think would

26
00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:35.327
save you time, try it out,
see if it works.

27
00:01:35.327 --> 00:01:38.391
Don't even need a utility class there,
cuz I think utility classes for

28
00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:39.987
this could potentially be tedious.

29
00:01:39.987 --> 00:01:40.943
But yeah, as I said,

30
00:01:40.943 --> 00:01:44.413
this might be a bit of foreshadowing that
you can run into trouble with these.

31
00:01:44.413 --> 00:01:49.711
So just do be a little bit careful if
you do decide to go down this route.

32
00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:52.436
But for now,
we'll leave it like this, just so

33
00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:56.063
we can see sort of implications
of what that can cause later on.
