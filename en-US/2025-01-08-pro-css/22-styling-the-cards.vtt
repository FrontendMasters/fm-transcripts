00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.830
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: All right, so

2
00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.509
another more specific thing that
we wanna work on is our cards.

3
00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:06.933
The hero, there's only one out of
the cards, there's multiple of those.

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:10.337
So we do need to think a little bit
about how we want to approach things.

5
00:00:10.337 --> 00:00:12.551
Cuz if we take a look at the Figma design,

6
00:00:12.551 --> 00:00:17.063
we could just make these cards that we see
cuz this is the part of the page we're at.

7
00:00:17.063 --> 00:00:19.298
And we could tackle those and
do what we want with them.

8
00:00:19.298 --> 00:00:21.724
We have different types of cards
that are all very similar.

9
00:00:21.724 --> 00:00:25.795
But there's some differences, the font
size of the titles noticeably being

10
00:00:25.795 --> 00:00:29.818
the one thing that actually switches
depending on the situation we're in.

11
00:00:29.818 --> 00:00:31.645
So ideally, when we start tackling this,

12
00:00:31.645 --> 00:00:34.962
we need to sort of be forward thinking
about like, how am I gonna treat those?

13
00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:36.634
And there's different
options we could take.

14
00:00:36.634 --> 00:00:37.483
I could say, you know what?

15
00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:40.850
My card titles are different enough
between each one of them that I'm only

16
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.291
gonna use utility classes for the titles,
cuz it's just the easiest way.

17
00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:48.380
I already have those utilities in place,
why bother worrying about anything else?

18
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.871
The other thing might be that you're
going to have different classes.

19
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:56.331
You can have a card title, one card title,
two card title freer, large, medium,

20
00:00:56.331 --> 00:00:57.565
small, or whatever.

21
00:00:57.565 --> 00:00:59.786
You could come up with
different modifiers or

22
00:00:59.786 --> 00:01:03.124
different titles in different classes for
it if you want it as well.

23
00:01:03.124 --> 00:01:06.866
Or I'm gonna suggest which is the third
way, which is how I like to work.

24
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.675
But again, any of those options
would be completely valid and

25
00:01:09.675 --> 00:01:11.305
there is no issues with any of them.

26
00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:15.269
We'll see more once we start builiding out
the other ones, the real benefit of them.

27
00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:19.638
But I think, hopefully, even now
the benefit will show through, but

28
00:01:19.638 --> 00:01:24.020
it will really hammer home once we
start bringing in those other ones.

29
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.106
But I'll say,
if you're stuck a little bit,

30
00:01:26.106 --> 00:01:28.633
the one thing I always say is
start with the easy things.

31
00:01:28.633 --> 00:01:31.926
If you're looking at this going, I'm not
sure what I'm gonna do with my titles, but

32
00:01:31.926 --> 00:01:33.410
I know what I need the font sizes to be.

33
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.064
I know what I need border radiuses to be,
and all these other things,

34
00:01:37.064 --> 00:01:39.904
the padding, do that first,
just get through that.

35
00:01:39.904 --> 00:01:41.915
And then you might get some
ideas on the other parts.

36
00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:45.214
Or at least you've made some forward
progress instead of just staring at

37
00:01:45.214 --> 00:01:47.492
something for a while and
not seeing any changes.

38
00:01:47.492 --> 00:01:50.096
So if I come and
take a look at the three cards here,

39
00:01:50.096 --> 00:01:52.525
I'm not gonna worry about the titles for
now.

40
00:01:52.525 --> 00:01:55.075
That's the hard part,
I don't wanna worry about the hard part.

41
00:01:55.075 --> 00:01:58.006
I'm gonna continue doing
this in my components layer.

42
00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:01.116
I see this, it's a reuable component,
more so than my hero, but

43
00:02:01.116 --> 00:02:03.506
it's still a component
that I'm gonna be doing.

44
00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:08.421
So while I'm in there,
I can come down outside

45
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:12.718
of the purple brace and .card on there.

46
00:02:12.718 --> 00:02:15.911
I know I need padding, so
I can say padding: 1rem;.

47
00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:19.580
Padding doesn't really show me much, so it
reminds me that I need a background-color.

48
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.662
So come in with the background-color.

49
00:02:21.662 --> 00:02:24.872
In this case, I don't really
remember what the color is, but

50
00:02:24.872 --> 00:02:27.481
I know I need it to be
lighter than that darker one.

51
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:31.450
So, again, the naming convention I used,
I have the different backgrounds in there

52
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.834
and then I just remember,
I probably had the main.

53
00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:38.298
So the background light is probably
the one I want, and hit save and

54
00:02:38.298 --> 00:02:40.304
I can see that that is the one.

55
00:02:40.304 --> 00:02:42.979
I'm just gonna gonna do this so
we can see our code a bit better,

56
00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:44.252
even if it looks a bit uglier.

57
00:02:44.252 --> 00:02:46.496
Looking at it at this size, there we go.

58
00:02:46.496 --> 00:02:49.846
So the light background-color comes in and
it's the same on all of the cards.

59
00:02:49.846 --> 00:02:52.478
So that works out perfectly for us.

60
00:02:52.478 --> 00:02:57.389
The other thing, they need
a border-radius, so border-radius.

61
00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.182
In this case,
I think it was the middle-ish one.

62
00:03:00.182 --> 00:03:02.836
So I'll try my --border-radius-2 and
take a look.

63
00:03:02.836 --> 00:03:05.722
And I think that's the right one.

64
00:03:05.722 --> 00:03:09.342
The problem is the images need a different
--border-radius-2 cuz they had

65
00:03:09.342 --> 00:03:10.159
the big one on it.

66
00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.978
I said that we'd run into a problem.

67
00:03:11.978 --> 00:03:13.926
This isn't the problem that we'd run into,

68
00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:15.934
we have another one that
will come up later on.

69
00:03:15.934 --> 00:03:20.414
But I could say that any card that's in an
image, and this would be again, you go and

70
00:03:20.414 --> 00:03:21.770
look at your Figma file.

71
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.802
And I can see that these cards have
this smaller border radius in here.

72
00:03:27.802 --> 00:03:32.178
If I go look, these ones don't have any
images, so I don't have to worry about it.

73
00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:35.664
But if I come and look at these ones, all
of these images that are coming in here as

74
00:03:35.664 --> 00:03:37.761
well, they all need
the same border-radius.

75
00:03:37.761 --> 00:03:40.146
So I can just assume based on that,

76
00:03:40.146 --> 00:03:45.589
that every single one of my cards that
has an image will have a border-radius.

77
00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:49.454
So this to me is the easier way than
creating another class that I have to

78
00:03:49.454 --> 00:03:51.367
remember to put on all of my cards.

79
00:03:51.367 --> 00:03:55.207
And this is that point where having
utility classes versus having classes,

80
00:03:55.207 --> 00:03:57.732
regular classes like
we're creating right now.

81
00:03:57.732 --> 00:04:01.203
Where I see the benefit of having a normal
class, I can throw a card on there and

82
00:04:01.203 --> 00:04:03.297
it treats everything
that's going on there.

83
00:04:03.297 --> 00:04:05.481
And it's just one thing
that I can repeat over and

84
00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:08.302
over instead of having to remember,
my card needs something,

85
00:04:08.302 --> 00:04:12.156
the image inside the card need something,
the title inside the card need something.

86
00:04:12.156 --> 00:04:17.066
If I can just do one parent class and it
handles everything for me, that's awesome.

87
00:04:17.066 --> 00:04:22.656
So border-radius would then
probably be --border-radius-1.

88
00:04:22.656 --> 00:04:26.994
I'm actually wondering,
that looks really small, so

89
00:04:26.994 --> 00:04:30.142
that might actually be the 3 and the 2.

90
00:04:30.142 --> 00:04:34.562
That looks a little bit better, so
I think it was the 3 and the 2.

91
00:04:34.562 --> 00:04:37.815
If ever you're doing your own
designs just really fast,

92
00:04:37.815 --> 00:04:42.218
if you have two elements that are nested
and both of them have a border radius,

93
00:04:42.218 --> 00:04:44.959
you do not want the border
radius to be the same.

94
00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:46.094
Cuz if it is the same,

95
00:04:46.094 --> 00:04:49.518
the one on the inside will look
like the border radius is bigger.

96
00:04:49.518 --> 00:04:51.177
Not super obvious in this case, but

97
00:04:51.177 --> 00:04:53.399
the one on the inside
should always be smaller.

98
00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:57.657
There's a formula to figure it out,
but well, these utilities or

99
00:04:57.657 --> 00:05:01.621
these custom properties work for
us, so we're good on that.

100
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:04.342
The text color is already taken
care of thanks to inheritance.

101
00:05:04.342 --> 00:05:07.018
The font size here is fine.

102
00:05:07.018 --> 00:05:08.837
So I'm just trying to
think really quickly.

103
00:05:08.837 --> 00:05:10.538
I don't see anything else
that I would need to add.

104
00:05:10.538 --> 00:05:12.192
If I forgot something,
we'll add it in a minute.

105
00:05:12.192 --> 00:05:14.263
But I wanna talk now about those titles.

106
00:05:14.263 --> 00:05:16.996
The two choices or
the three choices, as I said,

107
00:05:16.996 --> 00:05:21.133
we could either have to use utility
classes, which feels like the easiest

108
00:05:21.133 --> 00:05:24.757
solution because we have the utility
classes already in place.

109
00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:28.323
The problem with using the utility
classes is, when you get to here,

110
00:05:28.323 --> 00:05:31.951
you have to remember to use those
utility classes here, here, here,

111
00:05:31.951 --> 00:05:33.317
four times the same ones.

112
00:05:33.317 --> 00:05:36.262
Here, we have 12 cards, yeah, 12 cards.

113
00:05:36.262 --> 00:05:39.942
You'd have to do the same utility
classes across all of those ones.

114
00:05:39.942 --> 00:05:42.071
Then you're using the same
three ones over here.

115
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:44.642
If you add another card or
you switch out the content,

116
00:05:44.642 --> 00:05:47.284
then you have to remember to
put those same ones again.

117
00:05:47.284 --> 00:05:48.591
It's not the end of the world.

118
00:05:48.591 --> 00:05:51.436
If that makes sense to you because we
already have those things in place,

119
00:05:51.436 --> 00:05:52.756
by all means take that approach.

120
00:05:52.756 --> 00:05:55.409
I think it's functional, it works.

121
00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.964
It's just for me, when I start having
to repeat things, especially, again,

122
00:05:58.964 --> 00:06:01.153
in vanilla HTML and
CSS like we're doing today.

123
00:06:01.153 --> 00:06:04.327
The utility class is here, this is
when things start to fall apart for

124
00:06:04.327 --> 00:06:07.131
me a little bit, and
I prefer taking different approaches.

125
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:11.968
We could come in here and say if it's
an h3, cuz I think in all of these cards,

126
00:06:11.968 --> 00:06:13.166
it will be h3's.

127
00:06:13.166 --> 00:06:18.012
But once again, I don't like attaching
styles directly to the semantic element.

128
00:06:18.012 --> 00:06:21.260
Just because you might have cards later
on in the project where you change

129
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.652
the organization of the page.

130
00:06:22.652 --> 00:06:27.120
And it shouldn't be an h3 anymore,
it should be an h4 or an h2.

131
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:33.112
So for that, I do say coming in
with another class here does work.

132
00:06:33.112 --> 00:06:37.895
And we did the hero title, so I think it's
good to be consistent with a card title.

133
00:06:37.895 --> 00:06:40.978
If you have a different class name or
anything there you'd wanna use, you can.

134
00:06:40.978 --> 00:06:46.757
And if you don't mind using the semantic
tag, you could also select your h3's.

135
00:06:46.757 --> 00:06:49.017
But just be really careful with that for

136
00:06:49.017 --> 00:06:51.903
just the potential future
growth of the project.

137
00:06:51.903 --> 00:06:56.005
If I do that, it does mean on all those
cards, let's just do a quick find.

138
00:06:56.005 --> 00:06:58.422
Whoops, not, .card.

139
00:06:58.422 --> 00:07:02.012
To find them all, I just remembered
coming here, I see the grid flow.

140
00:07:02.012 --> 00:07:04.757
I use the grid flow because we created it,

141
00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:07.746
it's a nice way to have
consistent spacing.

142
00:07:07.746 --> 00:07:09.801
Do you really wanna do that
every time you have a card too?

143
00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:12.929
So let's do the titles first, but
then we'll circle back around to that.

144
00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:17.064
So on all three of these h3s,
I'm just gonna put my mouse there,

145
00:07:17.064 --> 00:07:21.896
scroll down, Alt and click, and
probably Option on a Mac, I'm guessing.

146
00:07:21.896 --> 00:07:23.099
And then the same thing here.

147
00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:26.858
So my cursor is in the same
place in all three, and

148
00:07:26.858 --> 00:07:29.994
I can just write it once, card-title.

149
00:07:29.994 --> 00:07:34.279
So card-title on that one,
card-title on that h3 and

150
00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:40.313
card-title down on that h3, except I
did it without the double underscore.

151
00:07:40.313 --> 00:07:44.089
So just to be consistent again, we'll do
the double underscore on all of those.

152
00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:46.349
What I'm gonna suggest is
gonna be a bit weird, but

153
00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:49.254
it's gonna hammer home why I like
using custom properties a lot.

154
00:07:49.254 --> 00:07:52.923
So for this,
let's start with the font size.

155
00:07:52.923 --> 00:07:58.180
And as a starting place, or actually I'm

156
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:04.802
gonna do a var(--card-title-font-size).

157
00:08:04.802 --> 00:08:09.394
If you prefer fs cuz it's
shorter by all means, font-size,

158
00:08:09.394 --> 00:08:12.943
comma, and
I'm gonna give it a default value.

159
00:08:12.943 --> 00:08:17.260
If I have a generic card,
what's my generic card going to look like?

160
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.592
And I have to make a decision on that.

161
00:08:19.592 --> 00:08:23.543
I'm just gonna say that these ones over
here are my generic card and the other

162
00:08:23.543 --> 00:08:27.694
ones are the modified versions, just
because this is the first one I'm doing.

163
00:08:27.694 --> 00:08:35.115
So the font size of that is quite big,
I think that's my heading-regular.

164
00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:38.123
We'll check that in a second.

165
00:08:38.123 --> 00:08:46.246
My color of it is gonna be
a VAR A card title color, comma.

166
00:08:46.246 --> 00:08:47.690
And that one's easy becaus
var(--card-title-color, ), and

167
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.697
that one is easy cuz
it's the --text-brand.

168
00:08:48.697 --> 00:08:54.330
And what this is doing is, because
the card title font size doesn't exist,

169
00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.158
it can't find that custom property.

170
00:08:57.158 --> 00:08:58.629
Oops, I made a small mistake here.

171
00:08:58.629 --> 00:09:02.106
I do need to wrap these in var and
it didn't do it for me.

172
00:09:02.106 --> 00:09:09.169
It's gonna use these other custom
properties as the fallback.

173
00:09:09.169 --> 00:09:11.670
So, yeah, these don't exist yet.

174
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.354
And so now when I come in,
and take a look at the card,

175
00:09:14.354 --> 00:09:16.553
it's using those two fallbacks instead.

176
00:09:16.553 --> 00:09:19.950
And let's just put this on multiple
lines cuz it might make it a bit more

177
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:20.768
easier to read.

178
00:09:20.768 --> 00:09:24.385
And then we can do the same thing for
the color.

179
00:09:24.385 --> 00:09:26.085
I'm not saying you need
to format it this way,

180
00:09:26.085 --> 00:09:28.103
I just wanted to show all
the text on the screen at once.

181
00:09:28.103 --> 00:09:30.697
So it's looking for
a card-title-font-size.

182
00:09:30.697 --> 00:09:33.612
It can't find one, so
it goes to this fallback instead,

183
00:09:33.612 --> 00:09:35.271
which gives it the bigger size.

184
00:09:35.271 --> 00:09:38.554
And then it looks for
the color, can't find it,

185
00:09:38.554 --> 00:09:41.369
uses this color as the fallback instead.

186
00:09:41.369 --> 00:09:45.540
Sometimes, when we did our wrapper and we
did other things, I was taking a different

187
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.681
approach, where I was coming on the card
title and I was setting the defaults here.

188
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:53.643
So --card-title, let's just say orange or
whatever, don't do this.

189
00:09:53.643 --> 00:09:55.847
Sometimes you'll wanna
do things like this,

190
00:09:55.847 --> 00:09:58.169
where you sort of wanna
encapsulate the styles.

191
00:09:58.169 --> 00:10:01.785
And you're just saying these are things
like levers that can be pulled and

192
00:10:01.785 --> 00:10:05.654
changed when you're doing it for
modifier classes or for different reasons.

193
00:10:05.654 --> 00:10:10.423
But if it's something that I wanna change
it on a large scale where I might wanna go

194
00:10:10.423 --> 00:10:15.133
on the parent and change what all of these
values are, I wanna open that door up.

195
00:10:15.133 --> 00:10:20.759
So let's just say on these cards,
I'm gonna do a quick example here.

196
00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:22.989
This isn't gonna work, so
don't leave it in your code.

197
00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:25.153
But I could come on my equal-columns now.

198
00:10:25.153 --> 00:10:29.356
And I could say any cards
that are in my equal-columns,

199
00:10:29.356 --> 00:10:34.374
I could just say that
the --card-title-font-size: 1rem.

200
00:10:34.374 --> 00:10:37.042
And now all of those cards
that are in equal columns,

201
00:10:37.042 --> 00:10:39.176
they're getting that font size on them.

202
00:10:39.176 --> 00:10:41.681
And we could do the same with the color.

203
00:10:41.681 --> 00:10:47.505
--Card-title-color: purple, and
we could change the color of them.

204
00:10:47.505 --> 00:10:50.022
Because it's not gonna
use the fallback anymore,

205
00:10:50.022 --> 00:10:52.256
it's gonna use the value that's over here.

206
00:10:52.256 --> 00:10:56.367
So as we get into the second page,
this type of thing can be really useful.

207
00:10:56.367 --> 00:11:01.509
Cuz we could say any card that's in this
parent can have these specific values for

208
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:05.153
the card title and for
other things along the way as well.

209
00:11:05.153 --> 00:11:07.878
So we can set it all up like that and
it's gonna pay off, again,

210
00:11:07.878 --> 00:11:09.435
a bit more work in the short-term.

211
00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:13.002
But in the long-term, it becomes
a lot more adaptable and robust.

212
00:11:13.002 --> 00:11:18.542
And at the same time,
I mentioned I put the grid flow on here.

213
00:11:18.542 --> 00:11:21.623
You could definitely leave it here,
but it could be one of those

214
00:11:21.623 --> 00:11:24.775
things where you want the flow to
change depending on the cards.

215
00:11:24.775 --> 00:11:27.841
I don't think we necessarily
need to do it in this case.

216
00:11:27.841 --> 00:11:32.227
But since we have all
the other classes on our card.

217
00:11:32.227 --> 00:11:36.681
And because that would mean every time
we use our card we'd always have to use

218
00:11:36.681 --> 00:11:41.223
the gridflow as well, it just seems
a little bit pointless for it to be there.

219
00:11:41.223 --> 00:11:44.489
When I'm using utility, the idea is
because this card is gonna need it and

220
00:11:44.489 --> 00:11:45.918
this card isn't gonna need it.

221
00:11:45.918 --> 00:11:48.265
A little bit like our background-colors.

222
00:11:48.265 --> 00:11:49.906
This section needs this background-color,

223
00:11:49.906 --> 00:11:51.807
this section needs
a different background-color.

224
00:11:51.807 --> 00:11:54.965
Because they're different, it makes sense
to be able to plug and play things.

225
00:11:54.965 --> 00:11:57.398
If it's always the same
style every time and

226
00:11:57.398 --> 00:12:01.891
you already have a parent class on there,
there's no reason not to just come on.

227
00:12:01.891 --> 00:12:06.932
Do a display: grid; gap: var:

228
00:12:06.932 --> 00:12:11.980
(--card-gap, 1rem);.

229
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.983
And I think our gap there might actually
wanna be smaller, I'm not sure.

230
00:12:14.983 --> 00:12:17.226
Maybe the 1rem is okay, though.

231
00:12:17.226 --> 00:12:20.720
And now we have a card that will be
able to be a little bit more robust.

232
00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:26.824
We can change it depending on
the situation by having the --card-gap,

233
00:12:26.824 --> 00:12:32.740
the background or, sorry, the title and
the colors changing on them.

234
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.638
Whereas the things that
we don't want changing,

235
00:12:35.638 --> 00:12:40.202
the border radius is always the same,
the background colors always the same.

236
00:12:40.202 --> 00:12:42.770
This is one of those situations,
too, where you might wanna say, hey,

237
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:43.325
you know what?

238
00:12:43.325 --> 00:12:46.298
I'm gonna have different cards on
another page, maybe I'm gonna take

239
00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:49.581
that same approach for the color, or
the same approach for the border radius.

240
00:12:49.581 --> 00:12:52.511
So again, I have one card,
lots of shared properties.

241
00:12:52.511 --> 00:12:56.327
But the more locally scoped properties
you do with fallbacks on them,

242
00:12:56.327 --> 00:13:00.338
you're opening up more levers that can
be pulled just to have one reusable

243
00:13:00.338 --> 00:13:02.745
component that can be tweaked and changed.

244
00:13:02.745 --> 00:13:04.251
It really depends on the project.

245
00:13:04.251 --> 00:13:06.155
I would actually leave it like this for

246
00:13:06.155 --> 00:13:08.423
now cuz it's doing exactly
what I want it to.

247
00:13:08.423 --> 00:13:11.367
And if I ever needed to
have more adjustments,

248
00:13:11.367 --> 00:13:16.361
it's not that hard to jump into this and
then just do a few tweaks along the way.
