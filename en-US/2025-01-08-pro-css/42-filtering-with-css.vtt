00:00:00.113 --> 00:00:03.524
With all that out of the way, we're
gonna get into more complex things and

2
00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:06.289
start growing both our JavaScript and
our CSS a little bit.

3
00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:08.076
And so we wanna stay organized
with what we're doing.

4
00:00:08.076 --> 00:00:10.465
We're gonna start by filtering the guide.

5
00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:14.295
And I'm gonna copy this selector here
just to show you how it works, instead of

6
00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:18.379
writing it out, cuz I'd probably make
a mistake, because it's kind of complex.

7
00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:22.783
But I just wanna show you that it's
possible to create filters using CSS only,

8
00:00:22.783 --> 00:00:24.784
and then caution against doing it,

9
00:00:24.784 --> 00:00:28.739
because there's lots of CSS-only
solutions out there that do work.

10
00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.493
Since I'm not gonna keep this,
I'm not gonna put it in a layer,

11
00:00:31.493 --> 00:00:33.285
I'm just gonna put it at the bottom here.

12
00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:35.235
And I'll explain what this is doing.

13
00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.948
This is actually one
selector on multiple lines,

14
00:00:37.948 --> 00:00:40.477
but I broke it down
because it's really long.

15
00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:45.291
And this is using has, which is CSS.

16
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:50.917
So I'm looking at my mushroom guide,
if my mushroom guide has the ID of season.

17
00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:54.822
So if we come look here in our guide,

18
00:00:54.822 --> 00:01:01.202
the guide is up higher,
I didn't put the IDs on them,

19
00:01:01.202 --> 00:01:06.043
on this select, I will add the ID=season.

20
00:01:06.043 --> 00:01:09.885
And on this select,
we can add an ID= edible.

21
00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:14.915
And so, I can say if the mushroom
guide has a season and the value of

22
00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:21.250
the season that is spring is the checked
one, so it's actually the selected one.

23
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.745
So we can go and do that,
we'll scroll up to our list,

24
00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:26.864
talking about scrolling a lot.

25
00:01:26.864 --> 00:01:28.102
That's our spring.

26
00:01:28.102 --> 00:01:33.239
So I can select my spring, and
then we can say that the card, so a child

27
00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:39.457
that's a card, that's not has data season
spring, and we can filter it that way.

28
00:01:39.457 --> 00:01:42.214
And it doesn't look like it
actually worked right now.

29
00:01:42.214 --> 00:01:43.355
Did I save my file?

30
00:01:43.355 --> 00:01:44.283
I didn't, there we go.

31
00:01:44.283 --> 00:01:47.064
It's filtered and
I only have my two spring ones.

32
00:01:47.064 --> 00:01:50.239
And I'm just saying that it's
a display none in that situation.

33
00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:54.051
And so I could actually copy this and
paste it and

34
00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:57.685
then do the same thing for
summer and summer.

35
00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:00.091
And it's going to work.

36
00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:02.890
But nobody's gonna understand
what the selector's doing.

37
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.477
And it's one of those things, like, I like
playing with this stuff cuz I like playing

38
00:02:07.477 --> 00:02:10.105
with weird selectors and
seeing what you can do.

39
00:02:10.105 --> 00:02:12.893
And there is value in learning
how these things work and

40
00:02:12.893 --> 00:02:14.712
understanding how this works, and

41
00:02:14.712 --> 00:02:18.544
it just gives you a deeper understanding
of has and a little bit more of CSS.

42
00:02:18.544 --> 00:02:21.783
But nobody's really gonna
like what you're doing here.

43
00:02:21.783 --> 00:02:26.095
We're doing DOM manipulation with CSS,
where you start having to

44
00:02:26.095 --> 00:02:30.407
ask is this really simpler than
writing a few lines of JavaScript?

45
00:02:30.407 --> 00:02:34.282
JavaScript tends to be really good
at making changes to the DOM.

46
00:02:34.282 --> 00:02:38.791
So it's like I could do it this way, but
this is a really complex way to do it.

47
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:43.192
And it actually limits some of the things
that I'm going to be able to do as well.

48
00:02:43.192 --> 00:02:45.603
If we wanna do animations or
do other things.

49
00:02:45.603 --> 00:02:50.543
I've actually spent a lot of time playing
with, trying to animate this, and

50
00:02:50.543 --> 00:02:52.368
it just becomes a time suck.

51
00:02:52.368 --> 00:02:55.938
And when you start doing that, that's like
the red flag that you should throw when

52
00:02:55.938 --> 00:02:58.070
you're coming up these
ridiculous selectors.

53
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.446
Again for learning purposes, fantastic.

54
00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:02.192
If you're just experimenting, go for it.

55
00:03:02.192 --> 00:03:05.142
But if you're pushing it to production and
you're just coming up with

56
00:03:05.142 --> 00:03:08.042
these crazy things and you're
breaking your head and you're having

57
00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:11.042
to go through these really complex
solutions to get something to work,

58
00:03:11.042 --> 00:03:14.300
that's probably a red flag that there's
an easier way to do it somehow else.

59
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.854
And with CSS-only solutions also, in this
situation it probably would be okay for

60
00:03:18.854 --> 00:03:20.611
an accessibility standpoint,

61
00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:25.112
but you want to be really careful when
there's user interaction with something.

62
00:03:25.112 --> 00:03:27.281
We saw that with our navigation
that we were opening and

63
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:29.271
closing where we had to
change our area expanded.

64
00:03:29.271 --> 00:03:32.041
There's ways of doing that
type of thing with CSS only.

65
00:03:32.041 --> 00:03:34.999
There's the checkbox hack that was very
popular for that type of thing for

66
00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.391
a while, but
there's accessibility concerns with that.

67
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.900
And when you're trying to deal with
User interaction with CSS only,

68
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.835
usually you're missing something along
the way in terms of being able to pass

69
00:03:44.835 --> 00:03:47.028
the extra information that's required.

70
00:03:47.028 --> 00:03:51.090
So as much as I love CSS and
I wish I could only do CSS all the time,

71
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.017
in this case, I won't suggest
doing the CSS only solution.

72
00:03:55.017 --> 00:03:59.647
I would instead suggest doing a little bit
of Javascript to do the filtering instead.
