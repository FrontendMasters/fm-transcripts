00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.334
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: All right, so now that
we've got our mobile navigation set up and

2
00:00:03.334 --> 00:00:06.919
we have it on our page, we need to
actually be able to open and close it.

3
00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.417
And to do this, we are gonna be
using a little bit of JavaScript.

4
00:00:10.417 --> 00:00:13.476
And along with just having to have
the JavaScript open and close it,

5
00:00:13.476 --> 00:00:16.749
there's a few other things we need to
do because we have those area labels

6
00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:18.053
that we were using in there.

7
00:00:18.053 --> 00:00:22.901
So we have the area expanded, that we
need to toggle to show if the element

8
00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:25.290
is actually open or closed as well.

9
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.932
So the very first thing we need to do is
actually create a JavaScript file to start

10
00:00:29.932 --> 00:00:31.540
writing some JavaScript.

11
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.223
So over in my file explorer here,
I can just make a new file.

12
00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:39.347
We can just call it main.js if
you wanted a different name,

13
00:00:39.347 --> 00:00:42.485
come in with the name that
you're comfortable with there.

14
00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:45.439
And we just don't wanna forget
once you create your file,

15
00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:49.476
cuz I've done it many times, just like
with my CSS files, I forget to link it and

16
00:00:49.476 --> 00:00:50.701
then it doesn't work.

17
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:54.880
And I don't know why nothing is working,
so we can come in with our script.

18
00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.738
The src can look at our main.js and
I'm gonna throw a defer on here.

19
00:01:00.738 --> 00:01:03.662
Just to make sure that the JavaScript
is running after the page is loaded.

20
00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:07.452
If you also put your script tag at
the bottom, that would do the same thing.

21
00:01:07.452 --> 00:01:10.852
I just like having everything in my head,
it's easier to stay organized that way.

22
00:01:10.852 --> 00:01:12.634
And then just defer the JavaScript.

23
00:01:12.634 --> 00:01:16.281
So the JavaScript won't start
slowing the page down as everything

24
00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:17.721
else is trying to come in.

25
00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:21.754
With that done, we need to figure out
the best way to actually get our button,

26
00:01:21.754 --> 00:01:25.786
cuz the first thing we need to do is get
that button so we can track and listen for

27
00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:26.552
clicks on it.

28
00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:30.146
And right now, the button itself
doesn't have much on there.

29
00:01:30.146 --> 00:01:33.794
If we go and take a look, or
it doesn't have a class or an ID on there,

30
00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:36.804
if we take a look at it, and
maybe we'll go full screen.

31
00:01:36.804 --> 00:01:41.009
We have the button there that just
has the area controls primary nav and

32
00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.654
the area expanded a false.

33
00:01:42.654 --> 00:01:45.902
You could definitely add either an ID,
a class, data attribute,

34
00:01:45.902 --> 00:01:49.161
anything you want to be able to
hook into that with the JavaScript.

35
00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:52.042
But I don't like adding things just for
the sake of it.

36
00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:59.557
And again, we can sort of enforce doing it
the proper, accessible way by making it.

37
00:01:59.557 --> 00:02:04.137
So we need to have our area controls on
there by using that as the way that we'll

38
00:02:04.137 --> 00:02:06.120
find the element in JavaScript.

39
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.840
So I'm just gonna copy that area controls
to make my life a little bit easier.

40
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.871
And over here, we can say const navToggle

41
00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:20.534
= document.querySelector.

42
00:02:20.534 --> 00:02:23.936
And inside of a parentheses,
you do it like you would do a regular

43
00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:26.746
element selector has to
be in quotation marks.

44
00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:31.613
Sorry, an attribute selector, so we do
need the square brackets in there, and

45
00:02:31.613 --> 00:02:34.752
I can paste in my area
controls equals primary nav.

46
00:02:34.752 --> 00:02:37.843
The one thing to be careful with
if you're doing this is because

47
00:02:37.843 --> 00:02:39.126
I'm using an attribute,

48
00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:42.883
the attribute does have the quotation
marks, with a double quote on there.

49
00:02:42.883 --> 00:02:47.186
So I just need to use the single quotes
out on the outside, or vice versa.

50
00:02:47.186 --> 00:02:49.233
If you're using double
quotes on the outside,

51
00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:52.265
you could replace the ones on
the inside with single quotation marks.

52
00:02:52.265 --> 00:02:56.206
Either one is fine but you just need to
be consistent with how that's working.

53
00:02:56.206 --> 00:02:58.891
If you're newer to JavaScript,
just really quickly,

54
00:02:58.891 --> 00:03:01.014
the querySelector's looking at the page.

55
00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:04.951
It's finding the first element on the page
that has this area attribute on there.

56
00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:09.772
It's just using a CSS selector the same
way as anything and it's finding that.

57
00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:13.976
Now, the other thing we do wanna get
is actually the navigation, as well,

58
00:03:13.976 --> 00:03:17.337
that would be something else we
gonna have to hide and show.

59
00:03:17.337 --> 00:03:19.496
So we might as well get
that while we're at it.

60
00:03:19.496 --> 00:03:23.157
In this case, we could either
get it by the class or the ID.

61
00:03:23.157 --> 00:03:26.656
We have the ID on there,
we have class on there, it's upto you.

62
00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:30.851
You could get element by ID slightly
faster than a query selector, but

63
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:33.492
the optimization there is pretty minimal.

64
00:03:33.492 --> 00:03:36.545
So you can decide which
way you wanna select it.

65
00:03:36.545 --> 00:03:39.815
Since am using just
a regular query after there,

66
00:03:39.815 --> 00:03:42.704
am gonna say const
primary Nav is equal to.

67
00:03:42.704 --> 00:03:47.997
We'll do it the same way,
document.query selector,

68
00:03:47.997 --> 00:03:51.495
and I'll do my primary navigation.

69
00:03:51.495 --> 00:03:58.588
Or if you want the ID again, we had that
as ID primary Nav, they both would work.

70
00:03:58.588 --> 00:04:00.670
With that in place now,
we might as well listen for

71
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.118
when things are being clicked on.

72
00:04:02.118 --> 00:04:06.620
So we can start with that by
saying our nav toggle, and

73
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.431
we want to add an event listener.

74
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:11.342
And event listeners listen for
all sorts of events,

75
00:04:11.342 --> 00:04:13.959
if you've never used one before,
there's tons of different things.

76
00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.774
You can look it up on the MDM
to see all the different things.

77
00:04:16.774 --> 00:04:20.522
We're gonna be looking at a couple
of different ones eventually, but

78
00:04:20.522 --> 00:04:24.091
we'll see here an event listener,
and I wanna listen for a click.

79
00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:27.757
We can just put click like that
inside quotation marks, single or

80
00:04:27.757 --> 00:04:28.898
double would work.

81
00:04:28.898 --> 00:04:32.654
You put a comma, and then after that,
you can put a function.

82
00:04:32.654 --> 00:04:37.103
We could have declare a function down here
and just do it as a callback right here.

83
00:04:37.103 --> 00:04:39.463
Or we can just do an anonymous
function right here.

84
00:04:39.463 --> 00:04:43.490
So I'm just gonna do an arrow function,
so parentheses,

85
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.268
fat arrow, and then opening,
closing curly braces and hit return.

86
00:04:48.268 --> 00:04:51.019
So I can do something when we click on it.

87
00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:57.042
So it's basically when I click do whatever
is inside of this function right here,

88
00:04:57.042 --> 00:05:02.734
and if I always like just doing a console
log of click, let's say, clicked.

89
00:05:02.734 --> 00:05:06.216
I just do this the same reason on my
CSS files, I like doing a background on

90
00:05:06.216 --> 00:05:09.527
the body of purple, or something
like that when I first get started,

91
00:05:09.527 --> 00:05:11.547
just to make sure what I've done worked.

92
00:05:11.547 --> 00:05:14.895
Instead of writing a whole bunch of code
and then realizing I made a silly mistake,

93
00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:18.014
but not knowing what it is, cuz I have
20 lines that I'm looking through.

94
00:05:18.014 --> 00:05:20.390
So right away,
we can test to see if this is working.

95
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.757
Because we're using a console log,
you can just right click and

96
00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:26.511
inspect or
however you like opening your dev tools.

97
00:05:26.511 --> 00:05:30.812
Look inside the console, and if you don't
see your console, like, if your dev tools

98
00:05:30.812 --> 00:05:34.183
are sort of squished off to the side,
it would be in the arrow here.

99
00:05:34.183 --> 00:05:37.721
This is in Chrome, it might be a little
bit different if you are in another

100
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:40.509
browser, and
you can select console from the drop down.

101
00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:43.205
And, if I click there,
we see clicked comes.

102
00:05:43.205 --> 00:05:46.257
And every time I click on it, we can
see it's working, cuz I'm getting that

103
00:05:46.257 --> 00:05:49.326
the number just keeps going up every
time I click on there, nice and simple.

104
00:05:49.326 --> 00:05:53.578
Of course, we don't want to just say it's
clicked, we actually wanna do something.

105
00:05:53.578 --> 00:05:57.543
And I mentioned the first thing we wanna
do is actually change the area expanded,

106
00:05:57.543 --> 00:06:00.123
cuz when we click on it,
it should become expanded.

107
00:06:00.123 --> 00:06:02.434
Or actually, let's just go look again.

108
00:06:02.434 --> 00:06:06.863
By default, the area expanded is set
to false because it will be closed,

109
00:06:06.863 --> 00:06:08.689
I know we can see it right now.

110
00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:11.164
But by default, it'd be closed,
when I click on it,

111
00:06:11.164 --> 00:06:14.574
I wanna switch that to being open, so
the area expanded will become true.

112
00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:18.318
For me,
the easiest way to do that is to first,

113
00:06:18.318 --> 00:06:22.835
we can check whether or not,
like what is it currently?

114
00:06:22.835 --> 00:06:26.216
So to do that, inside of here,
I'm gonna do another const.

115
00:06:26.216 --> 00:06:32.183
I'm gonna say is, or
we're gonna assume navOpened

116
00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:37.211
is equal to, and
then we get our navToggle.

117
00:06:37.211 --> 00:06:42.676
And from this we can get a getAttribute.

118
00:06:42.676 --> 00:06:45.353
And you can get any attribute you have,
if you're using data attributes,

119
00:06:45.353 --> 00:06:47.833
it's actually a little bit easier
cuz you have datasets you can use.

120
00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:53.866
But we can get attribute and
we can get our area expanded.

121
00:06:56.396 --> 00:06:59.915
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So
it'll look something like that.

122
00:06:59.915 --> 00:07:03.993
And once again,
then we can do a Console log, just so

123
00:07:03.993 --> 00:07:08.278
we can see what we're getting from that,
nav opened.

124
00:07:08.278 --> 00:07:12.486
And if we go back,
I'll do it, whoops, sorry.

125
00:07:12.486 --> 00:07:18.307
And then if we go, take a look in
the browser again, when I click on it,

126
00:07:18.307 --> 00:07:22.768
I did something wrong,
because I'm getting a null.

127
00:07:22.768 --> 00:07:27.680
Nav, toggle, get attribute, area expanded.

128
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.452
So yeah,
just make sure you spell things correctly.

129
00:07:29.452 --> 00:07:32.760
[LAUGH] And that's copying and pasting
from somewhere else is a good way to do

130
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.609
that if you knew it was spelled properly.

131
00:07:34.609 --> 00:07:35.278
So there we go,

132
00:07:35.278 --> 00:07:38.578
now we're always seeing that it's false
because we'd had it set to false.

133
00:07:38.578 --> 00:07:42.923
So by default it'd be coming through and
saying it false and because so

134
00:07:42.923 --> 00:07:45.647
we're saying nav opened is equal to false,

135
00:07:45.647 --> 00:07:49.122
basically, so
nav opened will either be true or false.

136
00:07:49.122 --> 00:07:51.744
So it just gives us
an idea of where we're at,

137
00:07:51.744 --> 00:07:54.302
I find it's sort of
an easy way to read that.

138
00:07:54.302 --> 00:07:59.439
So it just gives us an idea of where
we're at, I find it's sort of an easy way

139
00:07:59.439 --> 00:08:04.846
to read that, we say if nav Have opened
is equal you can either do true or false.

140
00:08:04.846 --> 00:08:05.889
It's up to you.

141
00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:11.678
We'll say, if it's equal to false, we want
to change it to something else, right?

142
00:08:11.678 --> 00:08:16.585
So if nav opened is equal to false, then
what we can do is say that our navToggle,

143
00:08:16.585 --> 00:08:22.032
and instead of doing a get attribute, when
we use get attribute, we're just getting.

144
00:08:22.032 --> 00:08:26.427
The value of what it's equal to,
you can also do a set attribute and

145
00:08:26.427 --> 00:08:28.388
when you do a set attribute and

146
00:08:28.388 --> 00:08:33.431
say area expanded because that's
the one we're changing it now expanded.

147
00:08:33.431 --> 00:08:37.589
You have to put two different things
the first one is what the attribute is.

148
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:39.892
And then you also have to come through and

149
00:08:39.892 --> 00:08:44.045
say what you actually wanna set it to
In this case, I wanna set it to true.

150
00:08:44.045 --> 00:08:49.046
Then here I can come in with an else and
say, we'll just copy

151
00:08:49.046 --> 00:08:54.266
this cuz it's a bit faster,
navToggle area expanded false.

152
00:08:54.266 --> 00:08:57.225
So we're saying if the nav
open is equal to false,

153
00:08:57.225 --> 00:08:59.628
we're gonna set the attribute to true.

154
00:08:59.628 --> 00:09:03.454
If the nav open is not equal to false,
that means it is equal to true,

155
00:09:03.454 --> 00:09:06.494
we're switching it over,
so it's one or the other.

156
00:09:06.494 --> 00:09:10.098
So now I've left this console
log down here at the bottom.

157
00:09:10.098 --> 00:09:13.375
So we should see when I click on it, it's
false, then true, then false, then true,

158
00:09:13.375 --> 00:09:14.340
then false, then true.

159
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.209
So it's gonna toggle back and
forth every time we click on it.

160
00:09:18.209 --> 00:09:22.717
One thing that's really important here is,
in, if you know JavaScript a little bit,

161
00:09:22.717 --> 00:09:25.742
you might feel like you can
just do something like this, so

162
00:09:25.742 --> 00:09:28.429
you could check like nav opened,
or do it that way.

163
00:09:28.429 --> 00:09:31.391
In a lot of situations,
that type of thing is the right idea,

164
00:09:31.391 --> 00:09:33.613
but in this situation, that doesn't work.

165
00:09:33.613 --> 00:09:36.877
And that's because when we're
getting the value of an attribute,

166
00:09:36.877 --> 00:09:40.955
it's always going to be a string, so it's
not actually a Boolean of true and false.

167
00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:44.193
It's just a piece of text
that's says true and false, so

168
00:09:44.193 --> 00:09:46.564
we actually have to say is equal to false.

169
00:09:46.564 --> 00:09:50.167
There's a way you could turn that into
a Boolean if you wanted to, but for me,

170
00:09:50.167 --> 00:09:53.898
I just put in a simple if else statement
here, I think that's completely fine.

171
00:09:53.898 --> 00:09:57.652
You could also fancy this up a little bit
as well with a good ternary operator.

172
00:09:57.652 --> 00:10:01.465
But I find this really clear, it's only
four lines, I think it's the easiest way,

173
00:10:01.465 --> 00:10:04.163
just if you're scanning through
to understand what it is.

174
00:10:04.163 --> 00:10:05.274
So in my opinion,

175
00:10:05.274 --> 00:10:09.209
I think that's the easiest way
to tackle that type of problem.

176
00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:12.411
Now, with that done, we need to figure
out how we're going to style it,

177
00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:14.049
to make it actually show up and hide.

178
00:10:14.049 --> 00:10:16.714
And there's a few different
choices here that you could take,

179
00:10:16.714 --> 00:10:18.281
none of them are necessarily wrong.

180
00:10:18.281 --> 00:10:24.271
So on here, we're already doing some work,
so we could say when this is set to false,

181
00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:28.781
we could add a class or
something else to the navigation itself.

182
00:10:28.781 --> 00:10:34.128
So, using JavaScript, you can dynamically
add that onto the our primary nav here,

183
00:10:34.128 --> 00:10:37.456
and so you can have a nav,
close nav, open classes.

184
00:10:37.456 --> 00:10:40.166
Or something like that that you're
also toggling at the same time.

185
00:10:40.166 --> 00:10:43.070
It would work completely,
it's not gonna cause any problems,

186
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.695
it's gonna work completely fine.

187
00:10:44.695 --> 00:10:48.316
So if you prefer taking that approach,
you can definitely do it.

188
00:10:48.316 --> 00:10:51.505
Once again, though,
since we're sort of in this area land and

189
00:10:51.505 --> 00:10:54.948
trying to enforce using the proper
area attributes on everything.

190
00:10:54.948 --> 00:10:59.588
I'm actually going to take advantage of
how the area expanded its switching to

191
00:10:59.588 --> 00:11:02.274
change the styling on
my navigation itself.

192
00:11:02.274 --> 00:11:06.390
So to be able to do that,
let's jump on over to the CSS.

193
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.160
All right, so now to style this up,

194
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.115
the first thing we want to do
is actually make it disappear.

195
00:11:11.115 --> 00:11:16.447
So on my primary navigation here, where
let's actually go down inside my media

196
00:11:16.447 --> 00:11:21.555
query cuz we want it to only be display
none if we're inside the media query.

197
00:11:21.555 --> 00:11:25.613
We want this Navigation if we're at
larger screen sizes should still show up,

198
00:11:25.613 --> 00:11:27.584
we'll deal with the button later on.

199
00:11:27.584 --> 00:11:30.902
But when we're at the smaller size,
we want the display none,

200
00:11:30.902 --> 00:11:33.542
and then when we click on it,
we want it to come in.

201
00:11:33.542 --> 00:11:37.851
And we have to be careful here because
we're inside of primary navigation, and

202
00:11:37.851 --> 00:11:39.604
then we're going inside here.

203
00:11:39.604 --> 00:11:44.251
So, if I wanna create another,
there's a way of doing it that is nested

204
00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:47.904
using an ampersand, but
it's kind of awkward to read.

205
00:11:47.904 --> 00:11:51.864
So this is one of those times where it's
probably better to come outside of that

206
00:11:51.864 --> 00:11:54.277
initial selector and
create a new media query.

207
00:11:54.277 --> 00:11:58.254
It is be a little bit simpler for you to
look at, but I'll show you the alternative

208
00:11:58.254 --> 00:12:01.666
after just in case you do prefer it,
keeping it all nested together.

209
00:12:01.666 --> 00:12:07.293
So, I'm gonna say @media,

210
00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:13.828
width is less than 760 pixels.

211
00:12:13.828 --> 00:12:19.304
What I'm gonna do now is I
want to base the display

212
00:12:19.304 --> 00:12:24.928
of the primary nav looking
at that area expanded.

213
00:12:24.928 --> 00:12:30.721
So we start with the area expanded,
in area expanded is equal to true,

214
00:12:30.721 --> 00:12:34.467
because if it is expanded,
we need to see it.

215
00:12:34.467 --> 00:12:38.001
And because the way we have our
DOM set up here, the HTML set up,

216
00:12:38.001 --> 00:12:41.537
our button is coming first and
the NAV is directly after it, and

217
00:12:41.537 --> 00:12:44.429
like we saw when we used
our plus selectors before.

218
00:12:44.429 --> 00:12:48.022
The plus selector is looking at
what comes directly before it.

219
00:12:48.022 --> 00:12:50.713
So in this case, or
it's not the selector, it's a combinator.

220
00:12:50.713 --> 00:12:57.888
So the plus combinator right there,
and then we can say.primarynavigation.

221
00:12:57.888 --> 00:13:04.762
And we can change that
to a display of block.

222
00:13:04.762 --> 00:13:08.615
And now when I click on it, it will
show up and when I click on it again,

223
00:13:08.615 --> 00:13:09.556
it will go away.

224
00:13:09.556 --> 00:13:14.015
So I can just make that a little bit
bigger so you can see everything.

225
00:13:14.015 --> 00:13:19.208
So, there's the media query, and this is
a bit specific to how we've set things up,

226
00:13:19.208 --> 00:13:24.113
as I mentioned, just because for this to
work is It has to be the button first, and

227
00:13:24.113 --> 00:13:25.656
then the nav right here.

228
00:13:25.656 --> 00:13:29.397
If you had anything else in between,
let's just put an empty element here,

229
00:13:29.397 --> 00:13:33.207
it doesn't matter what it is, it's
gonna break the functionality of that.

230
00:13:33.207 --> 00:13:36.788
Because the plus combinator is looking for
what's directly before it.

231
00:13:36.788 --> 00:13:40.449
So is the area expanded of
the element directly before it true,

232
00:13:40.449 --> 00:13:42.738
then I'll change it to display block.

233
00:13:42.738 --> 00:13:47.483
If you want something that could work
with a bit of some differences going on,

234
00:13:47.483 --> 00:13:50.189
you could switch this
plus out to the tilde.

235
00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:54.285
This is a general preceding sibling, so
as long as any of the siblings that came

236
00:13:54.285 --> 00:13:57.152
before it are the area expanded of true,
it will work.

237
00:13:57.152 --> 00:14:00.224
So then we restored our
functionality there,

238
00:14:00.224 --> 00:14:03.307
even though we have that
link in between them.

239
00:14:03.307 --> 00:14:05.888
Either one of them works,
It depends on one of them,

240
00:14:05.888 --> 00:14:08.896
I guess with the tilde it's
potentially a little bit safer.

241
00:14:08.896 --> 00:14:12.265
So again, this is anything that
comes that's a direct sibling.

242
00:14:12.265 --> 00:14:16.657
It won't look at other ancestors, it's
only looking at direct siblings that come

243
00:14:16.657 --> 00:14:19.240
before it that have this,
then we can toggle it.

244
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.156
Again, we could do this with just
toggling a class on and off,

245
00:14:22.156 --> 00:14:24.636
it's a little bit simpler
in the CSS side of things.

246
00:14:24.636 --> 00:14:27.150
Rather than having to come in with
this kinda weird thing that we're

247
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.819
doing right now.

248
00:14:27.819 --> 00:14:32.041
But this enforces us to use the proper
accessible way of doing things.

249
00:14:32.041 --> 00:14:35.645
So if you had another team member came
in and they were replicating this.

250
00:14:35.645 --> 00:14:39.097
The only way that it would work without
them writing any extra code is to have all

251
00:14:39.097 --> 00:14:42.568
of the correct semantics placed on
the elements they're putting on the page.

252
00:14:42.568 --> 00:14:45.110
So it's a nice way to enforce
things right It's right there.

253
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.902
Now I did mention that we could
do this with the nesting.

254
00:14:47.902 --> 00:14:52.476
So if you prefer everything being nested,
I'm gonna cut this out,

255
00:14:52.476 --> 00:14:57.370
bring it up inside where we have all
of our nesting, and switch this, and

256
00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.434
I think this is gonna work,
to an ampersand.

257
00:15:00.434 --> 00:15:03.743
Cuz the ampersand is the placeholder for
the original selector.

258
00:15:03.743 --> 00:15:07.045
And so, there we go, that still works.

259
00:15:07.045 --> 00:15:11.214
I would say that if anybody comes across
that, they're gonna look at it a little

260
00:15:11.214 --> 00:15:13.777
confused, this is not
the most readable thing.

261
00:15:13.777 --> 00:15:16.838
If you do this, leave a comment in your
code explaining what's going on cuz it

262
00:15:16.838 --> 00:15:17.885
just looks really weird.

263
00:15:17.885 --> 00:15:21.753
And people will not be used to seeing this
or you'll come back to your own project in

264
00:15:21.753 --> 00:15:24.409
a month cuz you wanna steal
this to use it on another one.

265
00:15:24.409 --> 00:15:26.845
And you'll have no idea what
this is actually either.

266
00:15:26.845 --> 00:15:30.130
So if you decide to do this,
[LAUGH] it looks weird.

267
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:33.816
So definitely leave a comment, but
I'm gonna leave it outside in its own

268
00:15:33.816 --> 00:15:36.610
media query,
just cause I find it a lot more readable.

269
00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:40.054
And even if this, you feel like it does
need a little bit of an explanation,

270
00:15:40.054 --> 00:15:43.128
leave a comment in your code to
explain what it's actually doing.

271
00:15:43.128 --> 00:15:46.523
All right, and next, so the last thing we
need to do here is we notice when we're at

272
00:15:46.523 --> 00:15:49.891
larger screen sizes, our button becomes
visible, which we don't want [LAUGH].

273
00:15:49.891 --> 00:15:53.252
It should only be there when we're
at our smaller screen sizes,

274
00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:55.382
this is the easiest part to fix for this.

275
00:15:55.382 --> 00:15:59.465
All we want to do is when we're
not inside any media queries,

276
00:15:59.465 --> 00:16:04.027
which is our larger screen sizes,
we can just come and in this case,

277
00:16:04.027 --> 00:16:08.853
I don't wanna use the area expanded,
cuz that toggles back and forth.

278
00:16:08.853 --> 00:16:12.854
But we do also have the area controls
that we used in our JavaScript as well to

279
00:16:12.854 --> 00:16:14.899
select it, so I'm gonna do that too.

280
00:16:14.899 --> 00:16:18.683
If you like or prefer having a class,
by all means, throw a class on here.

281
00:16:18.683 --> 00:16:22.436
I don't see the point in adding
a class if I don't have to,

282
00:16:22.436 --> 00:16:26.359
cuz I have something else that,
so that I can select it with.

283
00:16:26.359 --> 00:16:32.951
And I'll do a display of none, so it
vanishes away and I don't have a button.

284
00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:36.592
It's always gonna be gone now though,
but that's good at this size and not so

285
00:16:36.592 --> 00:16:38.062
good at smaller screen sizes.

286
00:16:38.062 --> 00:16:42.844
So then when we get into, or actually
we'll do this all the way at that bottom

287
00:16:42.844 --> 00:16:47.275
media query down here, cuz it's not
part of our primary navigation.

288
00:16:47.275 --> 00:16:52.492
So I can bring that back in,
make sure this one's not nested in that

289
00:16:52.492 --> 00:16:57.442
primary navigation media query,
and we do a display of block.

290
00:17:00.364 --> 00:17:02.962
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And so
now at the smaller screen sizes,

291
00:17:02.962 --> 00:17:08.176
we got our hamburger menu shows up and
at larger screen sizes, it disappears.

292
00:17:08.176 --> 00:17:12.675
That one should is a little bit simpler
on how we can get that one to work.

293
00:17:12.675 --> 00:17:17.045
One question I just thought about this is,
I am using a lot of attribute selectors,

294
00:17:17.045 --> 00:17:21.056
and I get comments sometimes with
the performance of attribute selectors.

295
00:17:21.056 --> 00:17:24.932
There's some really old articles
out there, like over ten years old,

296
00:17:24.932 --> 00:17:29.013
they talk about how attribute selectors
are slower than class selectors.

297
00:17:29.013 --> 00:17:31.378
The browsers are really
optimized these days.

298
00:17:31.378 --> 00:17:35.472
For most selectors, you can throw at it,
you won't see any difference at all in

299
00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:37.811
select performance
between the two of them.

300
00:17:37.811 --> 00:17:42.376
Or if you do, it's so small,
it's impossible to even notice.

301
00:17:42.376 --> 00:17:44.451
So yeah,
don't stress about attribute selectors,

302
00:17:44.451 --> 00:17:46.212
don't stress about descendant selectors.

303
00:17:46.212 --> 00:17:49.767
If you're using some really advanced,
crazy selectors with some modern

304
00:17:49.767 --> 00:17:53.341
tools that are just coming out that
the browsers haven't optimized for.

305
00:17:53.341 --> 00:17:56.393
It's the only time you could potentially
run into any issues with selector

306
00:17:56.393 --> 00:17:57.027
performance.

307
00:17:57.027 --> 00:18:00.428
And in general, selector performance,
again, CSS optimization,

308
00:18:00.428 --> 00:18:04.116
it could be something you're worried
about, but I'd worry about images,

309
00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:06.266
JavaScript and
a lot of other things first.
