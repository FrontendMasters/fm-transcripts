00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.665
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And
with all of these steps done and

2
00:00:01.665 --> 00:00:04.826
any other customizations you have
decided to make along the way,

3
00:00:04.826 --> 00:00:07.314
you obviously want this
site to be live and online.

4
00:00:07.314 --> 00:00:08.668
We've seen how we can do that, but

5
00:00:08.668 --> 00:00:10.875
we want to make sure all of
our updates are there as well.

6
00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:13.626
We have a bunch of changes
that we've made, so

7
00:00:13.626 --> 00:00:15.824
we do need to commit these right now.

8
00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:20.009
We're not in another branch, so
we can commit these directly to main,

9
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.702
commit button right there.

10
00:00:21.702 --> 00:00:24.459
And in this case,
because we're committing directly to main,

11
00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:26.356
which you sort of want
to avoid when you can.

12
00:00:26.356 --> 00:00:30.149
But when we do commit directly to main,
it's going to push those directly onto

13
00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.415
GitHub, directly into the main branch, so
Netlify will see those changes right away.

14
00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:38.450
And when it sees those changes,
I didn't leave a comment, so

15
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.332
it's very mad at me right now.

16
00:00:40.332 --> 00:00:44.985
That I should have left a comment on what
I was committing, so that's why it's

17
00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:49.093
stuck in limbo right now, because I
was talking while I was doing it.

18
00:00:49.093 --> 00:00:53.378
So we can just come here,
enter your commit message,

19
00:00:53.378 --> 00:00:56.820
finished, resight, is that gonna work?

20
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.596
I've never done it through this
window before, there we go.

21
00:01:00.596 --> 00:01:03.757
And then I can sync my changes.

22
00:01:03.757 --> 00:01:06.446
And those have been pushed up there,
you wait a few seconds,

23
00:01:06.446 --> 00:01:08.359
Netlify is going to build the site for
you.

24
00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:12.059
All of your new changes will be online and
you can go and check them out.

25
00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:16.459
So we can go right now back to Netlify,

26
00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:20.454
oops, or that's my GitHub repo.

27
00:01:20.454 --> 00:01:26.220
Let's just check, it was FEM from scratch,
example.netlify.app,

28
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.090
and we should see, hopefully it's
already finished building the site.

29
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.949
If not, I'll do a refresh,
find out right now, there we go.

30
00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:39.617
We have the new navigation there.,
everything is upline or online,

31
00:01:39.617 --> 00:01:40.374
I should say.

32
00:01:40.374 --> 00:01:46.948
And our site's working, so nice and easy
to do, again, speed up that animation.

33
00:01:46.948 --> 00:01:50.950
It's kind of annoying waiting for
that to come in, but

34
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.474
we can see that everything is
here in an online environment and

35
00:01:55.474 --> 00:01:58.529
see that working perfectly fine as well.
