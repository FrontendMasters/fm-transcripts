00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.657
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: We need
to style the tags and

2
00:00:01.657 --> 00:00:04.985
our spacing is actually
a little bit too large as well.

3
00:00:04.985 --> 00:00:08.783
If we take a look at the Figma file, we
used our card because our cards over here,

4
00:00:08.783 --> 00:00:10.836
the 1 rem of spacing is actually perfect.

5
00:00:10.836 --> 00:00:14.279
The spacing here is good, but
if you look at these ones,

6
00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.400
the spacing on them is a bit tighter,
so we do need to improve that.

7
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.217
For now, I'm gonna start by tackling
the tags and then we'll do the tags and

8
00:00:23.217 --> 00:00:28.111
the notes at the bottom and then we'll
tackle the titles and the other spacing

9
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:32.423
issue cuz those come together quite
quickly and in a fun little way.

10
00:00:32.423 --> 00:00:36.536
But the tags are the easier of the things
that we're going to be looking at.

11
00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:40.587
And once again, you probably
know where I'm going with this.

12
00:00:40.587 --> 00:00:45.547
That I like styling them based on
things that I already have instead of

13
00:00:45.547 --> 00:00:50.089
having to create a class plus
having a data attribute on there.

14
00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.940
I want the data attribute on there because
it makes my life easy to hook in with

15
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.486
JavaScript.

16
00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:55.050
It already exists.

17
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.904
It's telling me what this is, so
I might as well hook into that to change

18
00:00:58.904 --> 00:01:03.423
the colors of them whether they're, all
the different colors that are coming in.

19
00:01:03.423 --> 00:01:06.480
So I'm gonna copy this for now.

20
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.115
I'm gonna go to, let's find my components,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And

21
00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:16.730
my tag to me is a component,
it's only being used in this one place.

22
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.990
But again,
I wanna make something that potentially,

23
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.101
if there's a card somewhere
else that needs it, or

24
00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:23.721
maybe not even a card I can plug and
play this, use it anywhere.

25
00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:26.519
So that's why I'm not doing it as
a card tag or something else like that.

26
00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:30.333
I'm trying to make it
as generic as possible.

27
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:35.513
And I'm just gonna come all the way
down site, footer, hero, cards.

28
00:01:35.513 --> 00:01:37.955
We can do it just between my cards,
my buttons,

29
00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:39.855
those are the types of things again.

30
00:01:39.855 --> 00:01:43.589
Organization, I just try and be like,
this is more of like a one off.

31
00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:44.645
These are more reusable.

32
00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:49.584
You could even have sub layers,
which we'll talk about a bit later,

33
00:01:49.584 --> 00:01:52.322
to be able to do these, if you want to.

34
00:01:52.322 --> 00:01:56.176
So the first thing is,
I have the area label.

35
00:01:56.176 --> 00:02:01.402
One thing I didn't do, and that I maybe
should have done, is actually given these

36
00:02:01.402 --> 00:02:06.423
ULs all a class cuz this is one of those
times where it could actually be useful.

37
00:02:06.423 --> 00:02:11.384
We could technically hook into the area
label, if you prefer doing that, you can.

38
00:02:11.384 --> 00:02:12.765
Since I didn't do it,

39
00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:17.784
what I'm gonna do is actually just select
the role of list that's right here, and

40
00:02:17.784 --> 00:02:22.678
push command D Keyboard, which is going
to select the next one and the next one.

41
00:02:22.678 --> 00:02:27.008
And I'm just gonna go through and
select all of those and

42
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:31.443
try to make sure I don't go too far,
that's all of them.

43
00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:34.807
And then I'm just gonna
push left on my keyboard.

44
00:02:34.807 --> 00:02:39.063
So my cursor is moved over and
it's not selecting the roll of list.

45
00:02:39.063 --> 00:02:43.854
And then I can give that
a class is equal to tag list or

46
00:02:43.854 --> 00:02:48.325
tags, something like
that would work as well.

47
00:02:48.325 --> 00:02:49.606
And just double check.

48
00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:52.779
I can scroll up,
there are scroll down now, I should say.

49
00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:56.435
If I look, I can see that it's
added that on all of them.

50
00:02:56.435 --> 00:02:59.027
So I do apologize for
missing that a bit earlier.

51
00:02:59.027 --> 00:03:02.995
And again if you'd rather Just use
the area label, that would work as well.

52
00:03:02.995 --> 00:03:03.636
It's already there.

53
00:03:03.636 --> 00:03:05.874
It sorta follows the pattern
that we've already been doing.

54
00:03:05.874 --> 00:03:08.681
So you could do that.

55
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:13.800
And we can say our card list,
not card list, tag list.

56
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.216
I don't really need,
we do need to style this actually.

57
00:03:17.216 --> 00:03:23.204
Just throw a display of flex on there to
get them to go next to each other and

58
00:03:23.204 --> 00:03:26.750
add a gap, and
space them out a little bit.

59
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.470
So that's not too much.

60
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.462
Just to be safe, it could be something
where in the future there's more tags,

61
00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:36.755
you have less tags, you have other things,
we could also just do a flex-wrap of wrap

62
00:03:36.755 --> 00:03:39.133
on here that would just
prevent any overflow.

63
00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:40.644
You don't need to do this necessarily.

64
00:03:40.644 --> 00:03:43.908
This could be a change that you add later
on if you actually run into an issue, but

65
00:03:43.908 --> 00:03:45.468
it doesn't hurt having it there, and

66
00:03:45.468 --> 00:03:48.123
it just prevents future headaches
from potentially coming up.

67
00:03:48.123 --> 00:03:51.546
But it's not a big deal one way or
the other.

68
00:03:51.546 --> 00:03:56.013
The one thing I didn't do is add any
classes to the list items themselves,

69
00:03:56.013 --> 00:03:57.968
just because we have a tag list.

70
00:03:57.968 --> 00:04:01.103
So because my tag list has
to have list items in there.

71
00:04:01.103 --> 00:04:04.389
I know some people don't like having
descendant selectors we've already been

72
00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:05.134
using them a lot.

73
00:04:05.134 --> 00:04:10.271
So I'm very willing to do a tag list,
Li like that, so if you don't want to use

74
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:15.254
nesting, you could do it like that,
or because I've been using nesting,

75
00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:18.685
we can come in and
just grab that same type of thing.

76
00:04:18.685 --> 00:04:21.902
We're just creating a descendant selector.

77
00:04:21.902 --> 00:04:25.146
And yeah, I'm okay with doing one
two levels of descendants selectors.

78
00:04:25.146 --> 00:04:26.575
I don't think it's a problem.

79
00:04:26.575 --> 00:04:28.585
It's people complain
about no scope in CSS.

80
00:04:28.585 --> 00:04:32.301
We do have scope now, which is a new
thing, but this is scoping my selector.

81
00:04:32.301 --> 00:04:37.759
It's the list items that are in my tag
lists, and I can style them this way.

82
00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.120
So for that, we just wanna
give them a couple of things,

83
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.049
the padding will probably
have to play with.

84
00:04:42.049 --> 00:04:44.244
So for now, I'm gonna make it too big.

85
00:04:44.244 --> 00:04:46.990
So if you have a smaller number
by by all means, put it on there.

86
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.206
But I'm just going to give it
a little bit of padding, and

87
00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:52.626
I'm gonna have a bit of background color.

88
00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:56.899
And for the background color,
you might, whoops not, what I wanted.

89
00:04:56.899 --> 00:05:00.419
As you might have guessed,
we've been doing this a lot.

90
00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.146
You can call this tag, will do tag bg.

91
00:05:05.146 --> 00:05:08.249
And I'm gonna give a fallback
of a red just for now.

92
00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:09.916
We'll take that off after but

93
00:05:09.916 --> 00:05:14.060
it's a good way to make sure that all
of the colors we put on after working.

94
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.542
We're saying if the tag bg doesn't exist,
we use the red fallback.

95
00:05:17.542 --> 00:05:19.035
It just highlights it for us.

96
00:05:19.035 --> 00:05:23.033
So we can see that none of them actually
have an official color that we've put on

97
00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:23.591
them yet.

98
00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:25.601
And maybe we could fix our
padding now with that.

99
00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:30.335
It's gonna be really small on the top and
then a little bit bigger on the left and

100
00:05:30.335 --> 00:05:33.950
right, I think, but
the padding overall was really tiny.

101
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.759
And I do believe,
let's go look at the Figma file.

102
00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:42.630
But the font family is different.

103
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.859
And again, we can get that if I turn on.

104
00:05:46.859 --> 00:05:47.739
Let's double check.

105
00:05:47.739 --> 00:05:51.070
I can see it's using the outfit font
family, and the font size is 14.

106
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.301
So it's using the font family from our
headings, and it has our small font size.

107
00:05:56.301 --> 00:06:01.726
So that means here I can come in
with my font family of FF heading,

108
00:06:01.726 --> 00:06:07.762
even if it's not a heading that's
what we're primarily using it for.

109
00:06:07.762 --> 00:06:09.579
So I'm happy with that.

110
00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:15.079
The color was pure white, so
that was our high contrast.

111
00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:17.905
And, let's hit save on
that just to see them.

112
00:06:17.905 --> 00:06:18.831
That looks decent.

113
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:21.643
We'll have to check the font sizes.

114
00:06:21.643 --> 00:06:23.713
It was 14,
we already looked at that, sorry.

115
00:06:23.713 --> 00:06:29.286
So for that,

116
00:06:29.286 --> 00:06:34.859
we can come in

117
00:06:34.859 --> 00:06:39.934
font size.

118
00:06:39.934 --> 00:06:42.327
You'll notice there's an issue
with the backgrounds on them.

119
00:06:42.327 --> 00:06:43.890
Some of them are bigger,
some of them are smaller.

120
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:44.864
We'll talk more about that.

121
00:06:44.864 --> 00:06:47.206
So if you've run into that,
don't break your head over it.

122
00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:50.215
It's a simple fix that we'll
explore in a little bit.

123
00:06:50.215 --> 00:06:57.312
The last thing though I will do
is add a border radius to them.

124
00:06:57.312 --> 00:07:02.780
Border-radius-1 should
do the check on those.

125
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.441
And we might have to tweak the padding,
but

126
00:07:04.441 --> 00:07:07.366
actually if I'm looking at this one
over here, the padding looks decent.

127
00:07:07.366 --> 00:07:10.947
Maybe it's even a little bit
too big on the top and bottom,

128
00:07:10.947 --> 00:07:12.637
I'm gonna try putting 0.

129
00:07:12.637 --> 00:07:16.268
We might not need any,
that looks a little bit better actually.

130
00:07:16.268 --> 00:07:19.355
And again, these are stretching out,
so it's hard to tell for sure.

131
00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:24.000
We can always tweak this a little bit
after once they're not stretching anymore,

132
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.433
but something like that does look decent.

133
00:07:26.433 --> 00:07:30.145
And then for actually coloring them and
getting the correct colors on them,

134
00:07:30.145 --> 00:07:33.521
we have those data attributes that
I mentioned that we can hook into.

135
00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:40.458
So we had the data edible is equal to,
and we had the different ones.

136
00:07:40.458 --> 00:07:44.184
Or we had only two for this, so
data edible was either edible or

137
00:07:44.184 --> 00:07:48.066
if you did true and false,
you'd do it based on those, edible.

138
00:07:48.066 --> 00:07:54.425
And for the background color on these, I'm
gonna let you think about it a little bit.

139
00:07:54.425 --> 00:07:56.147
I'm gonna set them, but

140
00:07:56.147 --> 00:08:00.576
this is the one time I'm using
the primitive colors that we had.

141
00:08:00.576 --> 00:08:05.173
Because if we go all the way back up, I
mentioned that almost everything I try and

142
00:08:05.173 --> 00:08:09.630
set like a color to so like background,
accent, extra light, main, dark,

143
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.809
I'm coming in with these
semantic meanings for them.

144
00:08:12.809 --> 00:08:16.628
When I get these one off colors like this,
where I don't know what the context of

145
00:08:16.628 --> 00:08:20.563
them is, I find it hard to come up with a
semantic value for it, or a semantic name.

146
00:08:20.563 --> 00:08:22.633
So sometimes I leave these like this.

147
00:08:22.633 --> 00:08:27.757
You could do something like
this is a data sorry, error.

148
00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:29.199
This is success.

149
00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:30.092
And this is warning.

150
00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:34.871
That's sort of the typical like UI element
styles that you get with orange, red and

151
00:08:34.871 --> 00:08:36.861
blue, and those types of things.

152
00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:40.650
But then I always feel kind of weird doing
tags with them that are not related to

153
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:41.656
those names at all.

154
00:08:41.656 --> 00:08:44.671
And then I don't wanna
link it to the color.

155
00:08:44.671 --> 00:08:47.786
I don't know, I don't want it to
necessarily be toxic because then I might

156
00:08:47.786 --> 00:08:50.963
need that color for something else
where toxic doesn't really make sense.

157
00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:54.477
So, sometimes coming up with semantic
names can be a little bit tough and

158
00:08:54.477 --> 00:08:57.297
if I don't have more context
with the project I'm doing,

159
00:08:57.297 --> 00:08:59.498
I'll just leave those primitives in there.

160
00:08:59.498 --> 00:09:02.984
But if you have good names that you'd
rather use and you wanna create that

161
00:09:02.984 --> 00:09:06.891
extra layer with the semantic names,
100% I would encourage you to do that.

162
00:09:06.891 --> 00:09:08.835
And we're gonna explore later on today,

163
00:09:08.835 --> 00:09:12.163
a lot more about why I like having
the primitives and the semantics, and

164
00:09:12.163 --> 00:09:14.400
the value that you get
from having both of them.

165
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.717
But we'll get to that a little bit later.

166
00:09:18.717 --> 00:09:22.708
So let's get back to those tags though.

167
00:09:22.708 --> 00:09:28.631
So the edible in this case is, this
one's easier cuz it's our accent color.

168
00:09:28.631 --> 00:09:33.905
Background accent main should make.

169
00:09:33.905 --> 00:09:35.632
There you go.
You can see all the edible ones have come

170
00:09:35.632 --> 00:09:36.330
in with the green.

171
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.629
I think I have too many toxic ones.

172
00:09:37.629 --> 00:09:41.393
I forgot to change a couple of them
along the way, but that's okay.

173
00:09:41.393 --> 00:09:47.273
We can just copy that,
paste it, if it's toxic,

174
00:09:47.273 --> 00:09:52.453
as I said,
then I can just use the color red,

175
00:09:52.453 --> 00:09:55.824
500 and toxics working.

176
00:09:55.824 --> 00:09:58.602
I can see that has come through
on the different toxic ones.

177
00:09:58.602 --> 00:10:04.099
And then we do the same thing for
the other ones, so I can copy that one.

178
00:10:04.099 --> 00:10:07.025
Now instead of edible, it's the season and

179
00:10:07.025 --> 00:10:10.592
we just run through on
the different seasons we have.

180
00:10:10.592 --> 00:10:13.822
I should have copied this one
because it uses the same color.

181
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:19.322
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And
I'm just gonna make this a bit bigger so

182
00:10:19.322 --> 00:10:21.202
you can see all my code.

183
00:10:21.202 --> 00:10:25.824
So the summer, spring, and fall,

184
00:10:25.824 --> 00:10:29.994
there are no winter mushrooms.

185
00:10:29.994 --> 00:10:32.230
We don't harvest in the snow.

186
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:36.626
The spring is the color teal and

187
00:10:36.626 --> 00:10:40.691
the summer, sorry, fall,

188
00:10:43.999 --> 00:10:48.870
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Is the color orange,

189
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.579
I believe.

190
00:10:51.579 --> 00:10:56.273
And then I can just double check, and if I
don't see any bright red ones showing up,

191
00:10:56.273 --> 00:10:59.844
I know that I did it correctly and
everything is working there.

192
00:10:59.844 --> 00:11:00.414
Awesome.

193
00:11:00.414 --> 00:11:02.357
So, and just again, to reiterate,

194
00:11:02.357 --> 00:11:06.260
this is one of the reasons I like
hooking into like, the data attributes.

195
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.522
Instead of having to double the attribute
plus a selector just to do the exact same

196
00:11:10.522 --> 00:11:14.233
thing with the class, I said selector,
but I should have said class.

197
00:11:14.233 --> 00:11:17.177
There's no reason that we can't just
use our data attributes like this, and

198
00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:20.348
especially in a case like this where we're
hooking into it with the JavaScript that

199
00:11:20.348 --> 00:11:21.724
makes our life a lot easier as well.

200
00:11:21.724 --> 00:11:23.656
I think it makes a lot of
sense to do it this way.

201
00:11:23.656 --> 00:11:27.923
I also just realized I put background
colors on all of these, but

202
00:11:27.923 --> 00:11:32.111
we'd set up our BG tag so
I could have just redeclared that, and

203
00:11:32.111 --> 00:11:34.956
that was originally
what I was going to do,

204
00:11:34.956 --> 00:11:39.557
so we can just control D that and
switch the custom property instead.

205
00:11:39.557 --> 00:11:40.823
They have the exact same result.

206
00:11:40.823 --> 00:11:44.038
One or the other,
it's not really a huge change.

207
00:11:44.038 --> 00:11:46.349
So if you did it the way
with the background color,

208
00:11:46.349 --> 00:11:47.846
it would work completely fine.

209
00:11:47.846 --> 00:11:50.957
If you do it with the custom property
this way, it's also gonna work.

210
00:11:50.957 --> 00:11:53.785
So, it's not really a big
difference one way or the other.

211
00:11:53.785 --> 00:11:58.592
We'll see in the next section or
the next part where we do the titles.

212
00:11:58.592 --> 00:12:02.390
Why custom properties really can
help you out in styling things.

213
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:06.176
And to put the finishing touches on this
section, we're gonna fix up our titles and

214
00:12:06.176 --> 00:12:07.269
the spacing for these.

215
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:12.817
So to be able to do that, if I go over
to my mushroom guide here, HTML file.

216
00:12:12.817 --> 00:12:17.315
I am going to do one thing that I
mentioned we don't necessarily have to do

217
00:12:17.315 --> 00:12:22.278
when we're on the homepage, is on my class
all the way up here, not on that one.

218
00:12:22.278 --> 00:12:25.655
We're gonna go even higher on the section,
all the way up here.

219
00:12:25.655 --> 00:12:29.371
I'm actually gonna give this section
a name, and on the first page,

220
00:12:29.371 --> 00:12:33.105
I said, if you can avoid doing that,
we might as well avoid doing it.

221
00:12:33.105 --> 00:12:36.164
These are gonna be really hard to
come up with meaningful names,

222
00:12:36.164 --> 00:12:40.244
especially in generic areas like we've had
for a lot of this project, like for this,

223
00:12:40.244 --> 00:12:43.496
start your foraging adventure,
you don't want a class like that.

224
00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:44.795
This is just a two column.

225
00:12:44.795 --> 00:12:48.241
This is a two column like it's hard to
come up with a meaningful class name, so

226
00:12:48.241 --> 00:12:51.581
just using a couple of things to change
the background color is a really nice

227
00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:52.124
approach.

228
00:12:52.124 --> 00:12:55.762
In situations like what we're doing here,
and with our grid down at the bottom,

229
00:12:55.762 --> 00:12:58.490
these are sort of a bit unique
in how they're going to work and

230
00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.528
what they're doing.

231
00:12:59.528 --> 00:13:03.816
And it's a lot easier because this is like
a specific thing that it's a mushroom

232
00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:06.771
guide, and
we need to style it specifically for that.

233
00:13:06.771 --> 00:13:10.775
So in cases like that,
I think we can come up and

234
00:13:10.775 --> 00:13:15.209
just say this is our mushroom
guide space section.

235
00:13:15.209 --> 00:13:19.210
So it's still a section, but we just have
a little bit of changes we wanna make to

236
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.767
this, and it's going to be specific
to if that guide exists in there.

237
00:13:22.767 --> 00:13:25.191
If we're doing another section that
doesn't have the mushroom guide,

238
00:13:25.191 --> 00:13:25.715
that's fine.

239
00:13:25.715 --> 00:13:30.518
But this is only for if we have the
specific thing it contains our filters and

240
00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:33.197
all of that that we're going to be using.

241
00:13:33.197 --> 00:13:38.204
So in a case like this, I think it makes
sense to actually give it its own name.

242
00:13:38.204 --> 00:13:41.585
And, if we go back, and
I'm gonna back to the cards just so

243
00:13:41.585 --> 00:13:44.904
we can look at the CSS we wrote for
them a little while ago.

244
00:13:44.904 --> 00:13:47.533
On the titles,
we use the custom properties for

245
00:13:47.533 --> 00:13:50.767
the card-title-font-size and
card-title-color.

246
00:13:50.767 --> 00:13:54.710
We never really used these cuz we relied
on the fallbacks values that we put on

247
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:55.824
those when we did it.

248
00:13:55.824 --> 00:14:00.606
So we got the orange title with
the right font size originally on those

249
00:14:00.606 --> 00:14:03.002
ones that we did on the first page.

250
00:14:03.002 --> 00:14:06.435
But because we have these custom
properties that are here, and

251
00:14:06.435 --> 00:14:10.645
because they're using fallback values,
what that means is we can come in and

252
00:14:10.645 --> 00:14:14.100
let's for this one,
I'm gonna do this within my components.

253
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.174
I'm gonna do it with close to my hero,
because again, I see it sort of

254
00:14:17.174 --> 00:14:20.686
the hero's like a sectioning component
versus a card that could go anywhere.

255
00:14:20.686 --> 00:14:27.136
So after my hero I'm gonna
say a mushroom-guide.

256
00:14:27.136 --> 00:14:30.216
And I don't have to select
the cards that are inside there,

257
00:14:30.216 --> 00:14:32.256
cuz custom properties are inherited.

258
00:14:32.256 --> 00:14:37.105
So that means I can come in and
say that my card-title-font-size and

259
00:14:37.105 --> 00:14:42.035
let's just do something ridiculous for
now, and we'll go back here so

260
00:14:42.035 --> 00:14:48.061
we can see the change actually happen, and
hopefully it does let's just do three rem.

261
00:14:48.061 --> 00:14:52.906
And they get really big, and
then we could do our card title color and

262
00:14:52.906 --> 00:14:57.086
say that it's hot pink, and
they'll change to hot pink.

263
00:14:57.086 --> 00:15:02.006
So by creating these components that
have exposed custom properties relying

264
00:15:02.006 --> 00:15:05.487
on fallbacks that's sort
of the default setting, and

265
00:15:05.487 --> 00:15:09.055
then you can have the parent
that's redefining those.

266
00:15:09.055 --> 00:15:11.981
And that gets really powerful in how
you can use that, because you can say,

267
00:15:11.981 --> 00:15:14.954
you don't want to have to go on each one
of these cards that are in the mushroom

268
00:15:14.954 --> 00:15:18.001
guide and put a class on there, or
create a new class that's gonna change it.

269
00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:21.341
You can just go on the parent and
say, anything that's inside of here,

270
00:15:21.341 --> 00:15:23.248
it's gonna get these specific values.

271
00:15:23.248 --> 00:15:25.906
So in this case, you could just
put the numbers you want, but

272
00:15:25.906 --> 00:15:27.535
we have custom properties already.

273
00:15:27.535 --> 00:15:32.297
So in this case,
let's go look at our design.

274
00:15:32.297 --> 00:15:37.667
If we look at the title here,
it is, I didn't use the settings,

275
00:15:37.667 --> 00:15:43.335
but it's the 21 and it's the outfit,
or outfit we already knew,

276
00:15:43.335 --> 00:15:49.501
but it's the font size is 21 which
I believe is the font-size-large,

277
00:15:49.501 --> 00:15:53.902
and the title color it
didn't do my variable there.

278
00:15:53.902 --> 00:15:57.352
So I'll do it the long way,

279
00:15:57.352 --> 00:16:01.711
is the high contrast right there.

280
00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:07.726
Let me just wrap this, var,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Like that,

281
00:16:07.726 --> 00:16:13.297
hit save, and there we go,
those come in and they're styled nicely.

282
00:16:13.297 --> 00:16:15.583
And not only did we set that
up with our card titles, but

283
00:16:15.583 --> 00:16:18.380
the other thing we did with this is
when we were setting up the gaps.

284
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.354
We did something very similar.

285
00:16:20.354 --> 00:16:23.877
We can go and find that really fast, card.

286
00:16:23.877 --> 00:16:27.733
In our card, I set the gap up with
a card gap that doesn't exist, but

287
00:16:27.733 --> 00:16:29.503
we gave it the fallback of one.

288
00:16:29.503 --> 00:16:33.161
So by default, it's always gonna be one,
but if we need to overwrite it,

289
00:16:33.161 --> 00:16:34.527
we can do that very easily.

290
00:16:34.527 --> 00:16:39.096
So we can go back, we don't have to go
back the mushroom guides, right here.

291
00:16:39.096 --> 00:16:46.350
So I can also say that my card gap is,
say, 0.5 rem, or 0.57.

292
00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.986
That's too small, so I think it's
0.75 you can throw on there, and

293
00:16:49.986 --> 00:16:53.160
then it adjusts the size of the gap
that's on each one of those.

294
00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.258
So it's a really nice way I find to
be able to just have one parent.

295
00:16:56.258 --> 00:16:58.896
It can we're only restyling
our cards right now, but

296
00:16:58.896 --> 00:17:02.589
you could be coming through and making
changes to a lot of the sub components

297
00:17:02.589 --> 00:17:04.946
that are within something
by doing it this way.

298
00:17:04.946 --> 00:17:09.822
And it can just make it so
you just have these blocks that

299
00:17:09.822 --> 00:17:14.062
are resiling things and
it can be really handy.

300
00:17:14.062 --> 00:17:17.508
The last thing we need to do is our
little note that's down at the bottom, so

301
00:17:17.508 --> 00:17:18.339
we have our card.

302
00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:19.172
Card title.

303
00:17:19.172 --> 00:17:21.645
This one's nice and easy,
so we'll do it quickly.

304
00:17:21.645 --> 00:17:29.604
Card note, background color is the light.

305
00:17:29.604 --> 00:17:32.305
Probably the extra light
actually cuz our card's light.

306
00:17:32.305 --> 00:17:33.755
So now we can go to the extra light.

307
00:17:33.755 --> 00:17:37.301
And again, I like doing it this way cuz
then I don't have to think about what

308
00:17:37.301 --> 00:17:38.437
number something has.

309
00:17:38.437 --> 00:17:41.247
Give it a bit of padding.

310
00:17:41.247 --> 00:17:45.167
Maybe it's a 0.75, so
it's the same as our spacing.

311
00:17:45.167 --> 00:17:47.312
We can check the Figma file.

312
00:17:47.312 --> 00:17:51.055
And one thing I do with Figma files
is I just tend to eyeball it a lot.

313
00:17:51.055 --> 00:17:55.646
[LAUGH] Some designers don't appreciate
that I do that, but I'll eyeball it a lot.

314
00:17:55.646 --> 00:17:59.220
And then if I see there's a discrepancy,
then I'm not really getting it,

315
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.099
I'll actually go into the Figma file and
get the exact value that's being used.

316
00:18:03.099 --> 00:18:06.264
Padding is 0.75 and

317
00:18:06.264 --> 00:18:11.485
then we can do a border radius on there as

318
00:18:11.485 --> 00:18:16.559
well of br probably the 1, 2 maybe.

319
00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:18.931
And, I think that looks pretty good.

320
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:23.217
So if we full screen that all of those
cards are there, we have to style and

321
00:18:23.217 --> 00:18:26.816
make our selects work, but
at least the cards are all there.

322
00:18:26.816 --> 00:18:29.422
If we take a look,
it's nice and responsive and

323
00:18:29.422 --> 00:18:31.907
just works without us
having to do anything.

324
00:18:31.907 --> 00:18:35.072
We also have to fix the, whoops, sorry.

325
00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:39.105
We also have to fix the weird way
that things are stretching in them.

326
00:18:39.105 --> 00:18:42.229
But other than that, I think we're off
to a pretty good start on this section.
