00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:01.019
And with that,

2
00:00:01.019 --> 00:00:04.723
I just wanna say congratulations on
making it to the end of this course.

3
00:00:04.723 --> 00:00:05.907
It was only a two-page site.

4
00:00:05.907 --> 00:00:08.019
We covered tons of material.

5
00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.420
There was a lot in here,
a lot that you might wanna go over,

6
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.947
a lot that you might wanna practice.

7
00:00:11.947 --> 00:00:15.007
But just yeah, congratulations
on making it to the end and

8
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:16.947
getting through this entire thing.

9
00:00:16.947 --> 00:00:19.659
And take the time to go through
everything, to adjust everything.

10
00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:21.611
Don't jump right into another project.

11
00:00:21.611 --> 00:00:22.931
You can, of course, if you want to.

12
00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:25.743
But take the time to just digest
everything, and then see, slowly,

13
00:00:25.743 --> 00:00:28.799
how you can start using these different
things in different ways, and just

14
00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:32.171
integrating some of the ideas, hopefully,
that you learned along the way here.

15
00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:35.738
Because as much as possible,
what I wanted to show is that CSS can both

16
00:00:35.738 --> 00:00:38.211
be maintainable and
just a lot of fun to author.

17
00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:41.907
And so the early parts can take a little
bit of setup, but that setup really pays

18
00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:45.059
off once you're starting to put more and
more content on the page.

19
00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.678
And then those fun flourishes, and other
things that we can add at the end just to

20
00:00:48.678 --> 00:00:51.771
make the user experience a little
bit more exciting and all of that.

21
00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:52.997
So I really do hope that you enjoyed it.

22
00:00:52.997 --> 00:00:55.083
I really enjoyed going
through all of this with you.

23
00:00:55.083 --> 00:00:59.008
Yeah, so go out there and just remember to
keep on making your corner of the Internet

24
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:00.538
just a little bit more awesome.

25
00:01:00.538 --> 00:01:05.179
