00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.059
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: We have two completed
pages now, which is awesome, but

2
00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:07.030
there's one problem, our navigation
can bring us to the homepage, but

3
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.628
we can't get to our mushroom guide
cuz we have to fix those links.

4
00:00:10.628 --> 00:00:13.548
So we're gonna look at a couple of really
quick things here on what we can do to

5
00:00:13.548 --> 00:00:14.105
update that.

6
00:00:14.105 --> 00:00:18.554
Let's just do a find on here for
my primary navigation.

7
00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:23.574
So for this one, it's nice and
easy, it's my mushroom,

8
00:00:23.574 --> 00:00:28.289
we'll do it the same way,
mushroom-guide.html and

9
00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.300
I'm gonna do the same thing for
the other one.

10
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.672
Cuz the FAQ is on this page, I don't think
it's the best design practice to have

11
00:00:36.672 --> 00:00:39.805
a navigation where some links
are on one page anchored and

12
00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:44.592
other ones go to different places, but it
gives us some learning opportunities here.

13
00:00:44.592 --> 00:00:49.707
To do it, so because the FAQ is lower down
in the page, this would be similar to

14
00:00:49.707 --> 00:00:54.855
how we did our skip to main link, where I
can just do a hashtag here and put FAQ.

15
00:00:54.855 --> 00:01:01.806
So it's anchoring to that, it's gonna look
for the FAQ ID on our mushroom guide,

16
00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:06.568
which means we just need to go and
find that FAQ section.

17
00:01:06.568 --> 00:01:10.176
I can shrink that down, shrink that down,
and then we get the FAQ here.

18
00:01:10.176 --> 00:01:15.846
So on this section here,
I can just do an id="faq".

19
00:01:15.846 --> 00:01:21.007
And if that works, it means when I click
on the FAQ, I'm on the wrong page.

20
00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:25.308
We'll go back to the other one.

21
00:01:25.308 --> 00:01:32.057
If we're on the mushroom guide and we
click, it should go down to that section,

22
00:01:32.057 --> 00:01:36.103
except it looks like I
made a mistake in my link.

23
00:01:36.103 --> 00:01:36.850
That looks okay.

24
00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:43.846
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: There we go,
I just had to save.

25
00:01:43.846 --> 00:01:47.145
So it jumps down to the section
that we wanted to go down to.

26
00:01:47.145 --> 00:01:50.762
Then I can just grab this nav cuz
that's the only change I made.

27
00:01:50.762 --> 00:01:52.301
Make sure we copy that.

28
00:01:52.301 --> 00:01:57.707
Go over to my index page,
find the primary-nav here and

29
00:01:57.707 --> 00:02:01.972
just update it, so both navigations work.

30
00:02:01.972 --> 00:02:06.595
And double check cuz I pasted that in but
because it's collapsed I don't see it, but

31
00:02:06.595 --> 00:02:09.017
I can see that those
changes have been made.

32
00:02:10.803 --> 00:02:14.692
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So, now let's go
back to the larger screen size.

33
00:02:14.692 --> 00:02:17.322
That's our home page.
Mushroom guide goes to the other page.

34
00:02:17.322 --> 00:02:21.323
FAQ brings us down to the FAQ area
where I forgot to put my title.

35
00:02:21.323 --> 00:02:22.868
So let's go there and fix the title.

36
00:02:22.868 --> 00:02:26.377
And then we're gonna fix the scrolling and

37
00:02:26.377 --> 00:02:30.384
talk a little bit about
that while we're there.

38
00:02:30.384 --> 00:02:36.550
FAQ, bento grid wrapper, I never put
my h2, so we'll bring the h2 in.

39
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.690
Class="section-title", and

40
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.348
I think it was just
frequently asked questions.

41
00:02:46.348 --> 00:02:47.296
There we go.

42
00:02:47.296 --> 00:02:51.367
And seeing that, just to speed things up,

43
00:02:51.367 --> 00:02:56.693
we'll just add the flow here
to give me that space back.

44
00:02:56.693 --> 00:03:01.200
So yeah, when the user now clicks on
there, it brings us down to there.

45
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.548
So if I click FAQ, it jumps to there.

46
00:03:03.548 --> 00:03:06.964
This can be a little bit disorientating,
especially in a situation like this, or

47
00:03:06.964 --> 00:03:09.883
not disorientating, but if I'm on
Discover, and then I go here, and

48
00:03:09.883 --> 00:03:12.109
it brings me to a different page,
and then I go here and

49
00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:13.423
it brings me to the same place.

50
00:03:13.423 --> 00:03:16.648
It's not always obvious you're actually
on the same page that you were before.

51
00:03:16.648 --> 00:03:19.549
And then you start scrolling,
and you realize you are,

52
00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.464
it's one of the reasons
people like smooth scrolling.

53
00:03:22.464 --> 00:03:26.892
So we're gonna implement that right now
and talk quickly about implementing smooth

54
00:03:26.892 --> 00:03:29.523
scrolling, cuz it's really
easy to do with CSS.

55
00:03:29.523 --> 00:03:32.285
I'm gonna come all the way
up to my base styles.

56
00:03:32.285 --> 00:03:34.212
That's layout, my base.

57
00:03:34.212 --> 00:03:37.589
I already have an HTML selector,
so I'll do it in the same one.

58
00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:41.215
It can be anywhere you want, but
it does need to be on the HTML selector.

59
00:03:41.215 --> 00:03:43.740
This would just go on anything
that has a scroll bar.

60
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.132
So if I do it on my HTML selector, that's
where the scroll bar is coming right now.

61
00:03:48.132 --> 00:03:51.286
If you have overflow on other elements,

62
00:03:51.286 --> 00:03:56.665
you can add this to those elements
that you have scrolling on as well,

63
00:03:56.665 --> 00:04:03.378
where we do a scroll-behavior, not
scroll-width, scroll-behavior of smooth.

64
00:04:03.378 --> 00:04:07.732
And now if I click on the FAQ,
it slides and

65
00:04:07.732 --> 00:04:12.097
scrolls me down there, nice, easy win.

66
00:04:12.097 --> 00:04:13.981
Now, some people might be
looking at that going, no,

67
00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:16.638
where they're seeing me scroll up in
the page, and they really don't like it.

68
00:04:16.638 --> 00:04:20.234
My wife, if she's next to me, and
we're looking at a website together,

69
00:04:20.234 --> 00:04:23.830
if I scroll the page, she actually
has to look away while I'm scrolling,

70
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.281
it just gives her dizziness,
it drives her nuts.

71
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:29.720
She has a mild case of this with
a little bit of a vestibular issue.

72
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.556
Other people have much stronger vestibular
issues where they can actually get

73
00:04:33.556 --> 00:04:37.577
nauseous and worse from pages that have
movement that they're not in control of.

74
00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:40.185
So if they're scrolling the page
themselves, that's fine.

75
00:04:40.185 --> 00:04:43.930
But if the page is doing something
on its own, it just throws them off,

76
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.742
it can cause migraines,
it can cause other issues.

77
00:04:46.742 --> 00:04:49.054
With big things like this,
with large amounts of scrolling,

78
00:04:49.054 --> 00:04:50.839
it's something you really
have to be aware of.

79
00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:52.988
It's also really bad.

80
00:04:52.988 --> 00:04:56.068
If ever, I'm sure you've been
on websites where you see it,

81
00:04:56.068 --> 00:04:59.267
where you have logos going sideways,
or as you're scrolling,

82
00:04:59.267 --> 00:05:02.527
the scrolling this way is causing
scrolling going the other way,

83
00:05:02.527 --> 00:05:06.585
that's the worst thing you could ever do
for someone who has a vestibular issue.

84
00:05:06.585 --> 00:05:11.813
So what you can do is, and
people that have it really

85
00:05:11.813 --> 00:05:16.798
bad are going to have
enabled this in their system

86
00:05:16.798 --> 00:05:21.552
settings, at media prefers reduced motion.

87
00:05:21.552 --> 00:05:26.452
And there's two options for
the prefers reduced motion,

88
00:05:26.452 --> 00:05:30.554
there's reduced or there's no-preference.

89
00:05:30.554 --> 00:05:35.293
The no-preference one means the person
left their system settings the same,

90
00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:37.318
they're fine with everything.

91
00:05:37.318 --> 00:05:39.298
If you have the reduced one here,

92
00:05:39.298 --> 00:05:42.625
it means they've gone into
their system settings, and

93
00:05:42.625 --> 00:05:47.595
they've specifically opted in for reduced
motion at the operating system level.

94
00:05:47.595 --> 00:05:51.576
So the two options you have are, you put
the motion in, then you remove it, or

95
00:05:51.576 --> 00:05:55.323
you do it the other way around,
where here you have the no-preference.

96
00:05:55.323 --> 00:06:01.304
So the default is, there is no motion,
and then we can say,

97
00:06:01.304 --> 00:06:05.623
html scroll behavior smooth goes in here.

98
00:06:05.623 --> 00:06:07.646
And that way, if somebody has opted for
reduced motion,

99
00:06:07.646 --> 00:06:10.277
they won't get the smooth scrolling,
it's just going to appear there.

100
00:06:10.277 --> 00:06:15.139
And if they have opted in for it, or sorry
if they haven't touched anything in their

101
00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.996
settings, then it will
automatically scroll.

102
00:06:17.996 --> 00:06:21.191
There's one other issue
with the anchor scrolling.

103
00:06:21.191 --> 00:06:23.094
In this case, it's not a big deal, but

104
00:06:23.094 --> 00:06:26.687
just to highlight the issue that can
come up, I'm gonna move the ID here.

105
00:06:26.687 --> 00:06:32.641
Don't do this in your project necessarily,
but I'm gonna put it on the h2 instead.

106
00:06:32.641 --> 00:06:36.474
So when it scrolls down now,
it will probably scroll down and

107
00:06:36.474 --> 00:06:40.091
might not do what I want, but
it's not doing what I want.

108
00:06:40.091 --> 00:06:45.054
Sometimes you'll notice it scrolls down
like right to the text being right there.

109
00:06:45.054 --> 00:06:48.022
And the other thing that can happen
is you have a sticky header,

110
00:06:48.022 --> 00:06:49.650
stickier fixed position header.

111
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.917
The header will actually cover
the text of where you're scrolling to,

112
00:06:52.917 --> 00:06:56.466
just cuz it scrolls to exactly that spot,
and then the header is covering it.

113
00:06:56.466 --> 00:07:01.558
So we do have another thing we can add
with this, and I would actually include

114
00:07:01.558 --> 00:07:06.669
it out here, is scroll margin, or
padding, I might have got the wrong one.

115
00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:13.111
I'm gonna make it really big just to
highlight it, don't do it this big.

116
00:07:13.111 --> 00:07:18.208
But if we have a scroll margin, and
I do an FAQ, I chose the wrong one.

117
00:07:18.208 --> 00:07:20.666
Scroll padding, it is.

118
00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:23.427
Let's check that one out.

119
00:07:23.427 --> 00:07:27.312
There we go, and then I get 10
REM of padding on top of it, so

120
00:07:27.312 --> 00:07:29.309
it stops 10 REM before that.

121
00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:32.491
The reason I'm doing that over
here is cuz if I turn off or

122
00:07:32.491 --> 00:07:36.977
if a user doesn't have the smooth
scrolling on, that padding is still there.

123
00:07:36.977 --> 00:07:39.870
So when it hit the FAQ,
it's gonna jump to there and

124
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.181
it's gonna keep that padding
area on the top right there.

125
00:07:43.181 --> 00:07:46.042
So you could put this to
any number that you want.

126
00:07:46.042 --> 00:07:47.987
Just to be safe, if you have a navigation,

127
00:07:47.987 --> 00:07:50.971
just make sure that number is
bigger than what the navigation is.

128
00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:54.230
And I said I didn't know if
it was margin or padding,

129
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.017
I mix it up every time I do it.

130
00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:59.066
It's a weird one where scroll
padding is if you're putting it

131
00:07:59.066 --> 00:08:01.307
on the element that's actually scrolling.

132
00:08:01.307 --> 00:08:04.973
So, in this case,
my html has the scroll bar,

133
00:08:04.973 --> 00:08:09.582
so the padding goes on the element
that has the scroll bar.

134
00:08:09.582 --> 00:08:14.894
If instead you wanna do it on the element
itself that you're scrolling to,

135
00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:19.551
I could choose my FAQ, and on that,
I could put in scroll margin.

136
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:23.571
The margin would create a gap to
what's getting scrolled to directly on

137
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:25.859
the element that's being scrolled to.

138
00:08:25.859 --> 00:08:27.341
The padding is on the parent.

139
00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:31.002
It's just one of those things, try one, if
you got the wrong one, try the other one.

140
00:08:31.002 --> 00:08:34.584
And instead of doing the FAQ like that,
I'd probably just do target.

141
00:08:34.584 --> 00:08:36.227
It's a pseudo-class,

142
00:08:36.227 --> 00:08:41.152
anything that's being targeted on
the page can get that scroll margin, or

143
00:08:41.152 --> 00:08:46.177
you can do it here, but yeah, I tend to
just do it on the html element itself.

144
00:08:46.177 --> 00:08:50.447
Either one works, and if you try one and
it's the wrong one, try the other one, and

145
00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:51.434
then it will work.

146
00:08:51.434 --> 00:08:58.012
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you recommend a custom
scroll bar or any pros and cons to that?

147
00:08:58.012 --> 00:09:00.914
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Custom scroll bars
can look nice just for branding.

148
00:09:00.914 --> 00:09:07.216
They've always been a pain, Firefox had
their they actually did it the proper way,

149
00:09:07.216 --> 00:09:11.491
according to the spec, and
the other browsers didn't.

150
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:15.977
The proper spec things have been added to
Chrome, and I think they're on the way in

151
00:09:15.977 --> 00:09:20.218
Safari if they're not there already,
we can check really fast, actually.

152
00:09:20.218 --> 00:09:21.890
Scrollbar-width, yeah,
it's in the next version of Safari.

153
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:27.388
So, the scrollbar width and
the scrollbar color are actually

154
00:09:27.388 --> 00:09:33.002
standardized now, and
all the browsers are implementing it.

155
00:09:33.002 --> 00:09:37.901
Yeah, we have standardization,
but they're limited styling,

156
00:09:37.901 --> 00:09:43.247
the one that we had with the WebKit
version of it, you could do a lot more.

157
00:09:43.247 --> 00:09:47.244
The one thing I would say not to do is
custom scrolling in that it's like scroll

158
00:09:47.244 --> 00:09:50.581
jacking, where you're trying to
make it a smooth experience.

159
00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:54.737
So as you're scrolling, it looks like
it's a bit more fluid and everything, but

160
00:09:54.737 --> 00:09:58.111
then it's disconnected from what
the user's actually doing, so

161
00:09:58.111 --> 00:09:59.333
it can be a bit awkward.

162
00:09:59.333 --> 00:10:04.167
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I want to know if
you are in our own project and

163
00:10:04.167 --> 00:10:07.824
we want to set up a scroll motion,

164
00:10:07.824 --> 00:10:14.108
scroll smooth is enough or
do we need a library Lenny's?

165
00:10:14.108 --> 00:10:14.993
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: But you need sorry?

166
00:10:14.993 --> 00:10:18.648
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Do we need that
you use a library like Lenny's?

167
00:10:18.648 --> 00:10:19.450
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Yeah, no.

168
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:24.095
I'm a big fan of just doing this,
and not worrying about it.

169
00:10:24.095 --> 00:10:28.793
I think using a third party to bring
in the smooth scrolling is just way

170
00:10:28.793 --> 00:10:30.985
overkill for what it's doing.

171
00:10:30.985 --> 00:10:35.094
The one complaint about this is you can't
control it, there's no timing functions,

172
00:10:35.094 --> 00:10:37.925
there's nothing you can do to
modify how fast it's going.

173
00:10:37.925 --> 00:10:39.623
It just does what it does.

174
00:10:39.623 --> 00:10:44.078
So if you really need to customize it,
then you might wanna plug in or something,

175
00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:46.697
but I'm like,
do you really need to change it so

176
00:10:46.697 --> 00:10:50.193
it's 325 milliseconds or
something like, I don't know?

177
00:10:50.193 --> 00:10:53.586
It's how important is that customization,
but

178
00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:58.960
bringing in a plugin just for that, when
we have one line of CSS that can do it,

179
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.960
I tend to, let's just use what's there.
