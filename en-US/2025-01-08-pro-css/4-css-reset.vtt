00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.549
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Finally, time to get into
some actually writing some CSS with that

2
00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:03.149
out of the way.

3
00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.133
And the first thing we are gonna do,
though,

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.808
before we start having some fun
with it is resetting our CSS.

5
00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:11.559
CSS resets are something that's
a bit opinionated in a way.

6
00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.032
There's quite a few of
them that are out there.

7
00:00:13.032 --> 00:00:17.042
I mean, in this lesson on the website,
there is the reset I'll be using.

8
00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:19.958
And for this one,
I am gonna copy and paste it.

9
00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.697
We're not gonna be doing that as
we go through this course, but

10
00:00:22.697 --> 00:00:25.916
I am gonna explain the reset and
what everything is doing that's in here.

11
00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:26.872
Just really fast,

12
00:00:26.872 --> 00:00:30.895
this is based on a modified version of
Andy Bell's A (more) Modern CSS Reset.

13
00:00:30.895 --> 00:00:34.200
There are some differences that I've made
in here, I won't highlight what those are.

14
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.924
You can always compare notes
to what he did in his.

15
00:00:36.924 --> 00:00:40.200
But I would recommend checking out that
blog post if you do have some time just

16
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.759
cuz he does a really nice job
of going through everything and

17
00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:44.005
why he does the ones he does.

18
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:46.801
And you can then see the things that
I've done a little bit different.

19
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:48.754
When you're coming in with a reset,

20
00:00:48.754 --> 00:00:51.721
you also have to decide what
the purpose of the reset is.

21
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:56.091
In general, the idea of a reset is that
all browers are starting on the same level

22
00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:57.014
playing field.

23
00:00:57.014 --> 00:01:00.489
These days, some opinions do sneek
into them a little bit, though.

24
00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.390
But they should just be,
in my opinion, pretty lightweight and

25
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.605
not too heavy-handed, and just getting
everything set off in the right direction.

26
00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:13.265
So I'll save this and we'll see
a few changes happen, not very much.

27
00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:17.532
I think if you've written any CSS, you've
probably seen the box-sizing border-box,

28
00:01:17.532 --> 00:01:19.229
so I won't go into too much detail.

29
00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.310
Just means that if you add padding, you're
not altering the width of something.

30
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.263
The padding is included in the width,
so it makes our life a lot easier.

31
00:01:26.263 --> 00:01:29.478
I think that's the one thing everybody
in CSS can agree on is a good idea.

32
00:01:29.478 --> 00:01:33.045
This is something you don't see as often,
this text-size-adjust one.

33
00:01:33.045 --> 00:01:35.067
I put a link to the blog
post that explains.

34
00:01:35.067 --> 00:01:37.620
This is by Kilian Valkhof.

35
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.569
I'm gonna say his name wrong,
I apologize, Kilian.

36
00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.608
[LAUGH] But this is for on iOS devices.

37
00:01:44.608 --> 00:01:47.464
Only on phones,
if you turn them into landscape,

38
00:01:47.464 --> 00:01:49.784
it's gonna shift the font sizes on you.

39
00:01:49.784 --> 00:01:55.865
It's in there because of from the old days
when a lot of websites weren't mobile

40
00:01:55.865 --> 00:02:01.880
optimized and they just left it there,
so this prevents that from happening.

41
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.645
If you're doing things properly,
you're taking care of things,

42
00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:06.300
you don't want the font size to switch.

43
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.137
Hopefully, no one's looking at your
website on landscape on their phone, but

44
00:02:10.137 --> 00:02:11.754
someone will [LAUGH] invariably.

45
00:02:11.754 --> 00:02:13.008
So this just handles that.

46
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:14.725
There's this, margin: 0.

47
00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:18.598
A lot of people prefer
coming in with a star 0.

48
00:02:18.598 --> 00:02:22.501
If you wanna do that or
even the star 0, sorry, margin: 0 and

49
00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:24.574
padding: 0 on that, go for it.

50
00:02:24.574 --> 00:02:29.133
This one's just a little bit more specific
on what I'm setting the margins to.

51
00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:29.863
In this project,

52
00:02:29.863 --> 00:02:32.943
we could even get rid of some of these
things cuz we're not gonna have them.

53
00:02:32.943 --> 00:02:36.954
Highly leaving it there, though, just in
case the project rose that I don't have to

54
00:02:36.954 --> 00:02:39.848
come back in and add them later
on cuz that would be annoying.

55
00:02:39.848 --> 00:02:41.828
There's a third page, and
all of a sudden, you have a block quote.

56
00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:44.917
You don't wanna be like,
yeah, I wish I reset that.

57
00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:48.454
So if you do the *1 here,
that's completely fine.

58
00:02:48.454 --> 00:02:51.127
There are some things that margins
aren't the end of the world on, so

59
00:02:51.127 --> 00:02:52.336
I'm gonna leave it like that.

60
00:02:52.336 --> 00:02:57.046
Instead of having a ol and
ul of a margin and padding and

61
00:02:57.046 --> 00:03:00.934
list-style of none, as people like to do.

62
00:03:00.934 --> 00:03:04.163
Just because a lot of the time when we
have lists, we change the list styling,

63
00:03:04.163 --> 00:03:06.016
take off the margin, take off the padding.

64
00:03:06.016 --> 00:03:07.935
This has become a popular way of doing it.

65
00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:11.791
And I put, again, in a comment a link to
an article that goes into much more detail

66
00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:14.143
on it,
cuz I don't wanna talk about it too much.

67
00:03:14.143 --> 00:03:18.478
But it's just the Safari will remove
the semantics of a list if you do

68
00:03:18.478 --> 00:03:20.315
a list-style: none on it.

69
00:03:20.315 --> 00:03:24.169
They've actually changed that more
recently to if you have a list

70
00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.491
in a navigation, it won't remove it.

71
00:03:26.491 --> 00:03:31.233
This is voiceover on Safari,
which is one of the screen readers.

72
00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:34.953
The reason that they did that is cuz
developers like making everything a list.

73
00:03:34.953 --> 00:03:39.453
And then people that were using assistive
technologies, it's reading the website out

74
00:03:39.453 --> 00:03:42.332
to them and everything was
getting announced as a list.

75
00:03:42.332 --> 00:03:44.971
So they made the decision saying,
there's too many lists out there.

76
00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:47.629
It's annoying for users, and
users were complaining about it.

77
00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.515
So they said,
if you do a list-style: none,

78
00:03:50.515 --> 00:03:52.959
we're not gonna announce it as a list.

79
00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.513
This is if you want to make sure that
it actually is announced as a list,

80
00:03:56.513 --> 00:03:58.621
cuz you have a good reason for
it to be, but

81
00:03:58.621 --> 00:04:02.151
you know you need the list-style:
none on there, this is a choice.

82
00:04:02.151 --> 00:04:07.133
Another way you could actually
achieve the same thing or

83
00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:12.974
similar anyway is a list-style and
doing a empty space on there.

84
00:04:12.974 --> 00:04:16.308
I don't know enough about it to
recommend doing it that way, but

85
00:04:16.308 --> 00:04:18.408
there is some content by Sara Soueidan,

86
00:04:18.408 --> 00:04:21.703
where she's talked about that and
I just need to brush up on it.

87
00:04:21.703 --> 00:04:25.120
So that's another one you could look into,
or another option that you could look

88
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.391
into, where it will keep
the semantics of your list.

89
00:04:27.391 --> 00:04:30.922
Body, min-block-size,
I'm gonna talk about that,

90
00:04:30.922 --> 00:04:33.870
that's similar to a min-height of 100vh.

91
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.379
This is just to make sure if you need
to center something or whatever,

92
00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.110
it's just handy to have there,
I use it all the time.

93
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.367
And a default line-height,
the default is usually 1.4, I like 1.6.

94
00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:48.986
If you like 1.5, 1.7, in this project,
I'll just let you know,

95
00:04:48.986 --> 00:04:50.971
1.6 is what you wanna have.

96
00:04:50.971 --> 00:04:55.748
h1s, buttons, other things like that, so
h1, 2, 3, they're very large font sizes.

97
00:04:55.748 --> 00:04:58.075
Big line-height s look terrible,
we pull them in tighter.

98
00:04:58.075 --> 00:04:59.366
And buttons, inputs, labels,

99
00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:01.995
things that are one line that have
padding on the top and the bottom,

100
00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:05.154
we pulled the line-height down just to
make it easier to add the padding to them.

101
00:05:05.154 --> 00:05:09.009
And these are the ones we're gonna look at
really quickly, if you've never seen them,

102
00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.212
text-wrap: balance and text-wrap: pretty.

103
00:05:11.212 --> 00:05:15.402
So I'm gonna come on my h1 and
make the font size a bit bigger.

104
00:05:15.402 --> 00:05:21.061
Font-size of, we'll just say 3rem.

105
00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:25.546
If you have a text-wrap: balance, this is
for titles, which is why I have it on my

106
00:05:25.546 --> 00:05:29.584
h1 through h4 right now, not titles
necessarily, but for large text.

107
00:05:29.584 --> 00:05:32.976
And what it's gonna do, will open my
DevTools to play with this a little bit.

108
00:05:32.976 --> 00:05:33.543
There we go.

109
00:05:33.543 --> 00:05:38.471
So you can see I have this all in one
line, and when the browser gets smaller,

110
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:42.105
it's going to drop mushroom
foraging at the same time.

111
00:05:42.105 --> 00:05:46.057
It's balancing out the title instead of
having the title have mushroom foraging on

112
00:05:46.057 --> 00:05:46.574
one line.

113
00:05:46.574 --> 00:05:49.968
So if I take this off,
the word mushroom goes back there, and

114
00:05:49.968 --> 00:05:51.776
our title is less balanced out.

115
00:05:51.776 --> 00:05:55.406
It's just a little bit nicer of
a typography touch when it's balanced.

116
00:05:55.406 --> 00:05:56.810
It is a little bit opinionated,

117
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.880
maybe you'll run into a situation
where you don't actually like it.

118
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.908
But from a typography standpoint, it tends
to be an improvement over having that one

119
00:06:03.908 --> 00:06:06.194
little word that gets stuck
at the end of a line.

120
00:06:06.194 --> 00:06:11.278
We can take that off.

121
00:06:11.278 --> 00:06:13.961
The similar one we have, and
I said I'd mentioned text-wrap: pretty,

122
00:06:13.961 --> 00:06:15.308
this is a progressive enhancement.

123
00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:20.363
I believe it's still only in Chromium
browsers, is we can see that this

124
00:06:20.363 --> 00:06:25.518
paragraph right here at the bottom,
we have the words if misdentified.

125
00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:27.710
If I turn off my text-wrap: pretty,

126
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.662
we just have the word
misidentified all by itself.

127
00:06:30.662 --> 00:06:35.507
The idea here isn't with large blocks
of text, it's with paragraphs, lists.

128
00:06:35.507 --> 00:06:39.536
Anything that's multiple lines long,
you would use your text-wrap: pretty.

129
00:06:39.536 --> 00:06:42.525
And in typography, it's called an orphan,
when you have one word but

130
00:06:42.525 --> 00:06:43.851
all by itself on the last line.

131
00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:45.534
And it can just create an awkward look,

132
00:06:45.534 --> 00:06:48.802
especially if you have lots of text
with these little orphans down the side.

133
00:06:48.802 --> 00:06:52.201
So if you're on a browser where it's
not supported, it would look like this.

134
00:06:52.201 --> 00:06:55.855
If it is supported, it just makes
sure that no word is left by itself.

135
00:06:55.855 --> 00:07:00.188
This isn't the best example
because the if is so short, but

136
00:07:00.188 --> 00:07:04.707
maybe if we resize that a little bit for
one of the other lines.

137
00:07:04.707 --> 00:07:07.891
Can we get the other one line won't work,
or we can do it here with treasures.

138
00:07:07.891 --> 00:07:10.259
So treasures, I'll highlight it.

139
00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:13.085
The word treasures here
is either on there, or

140
00:07:13.085 --> 00:07:16.351
if it drops down,
the word hidden drops down with it.

141
00:07:16.351 --> 00:07:18.165
So that's what the text-wrap:
pretty is doing.

142
00:07:18.165 --> 00:07:23.055
Image, picture,
we're just setting the inline size.

143
00:07:23.055 --> 00:07:29.257
I had the block size before,
this would be the same as max-width, 100%.

144
00:07:29.257 --> 00:07:31.668
So block size is on the block axis.

145
00:07:31.668 --> 00:07:34.956
It's a logical, sorry,
inline size is on the inline axis.

146
00:07:34.956 --> 00:07:40.917
Block is our vertical axis, and it's
just the logical property for those two.

147
00:07:40.917 --> 00:07:43.005
And I'm very big on
logical properties now.

148
00:07:43.005 --> 00:07:46.063
So if you see inline, it's always
gonna mean you're left to right, and

149
00:07:46.063 --> 00:07:47.629
if you see block, it's up and down.

150
00:07:49.829 --> 00:07:51.215
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And then display: block.

151
00:07:51.215 --> 00:07:54.902
And then the last but not least are input,
button, textarea, select, font: inherit.

152
00:07:54.902 --> 00:07:57.791
Just cuz those don't actually
inherit your font properties, and

153
00:07:57.791 --> 00:07:59.604
that's why they often look kind of ugly.

154
00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:03.545
So by having that on there, it just keeps
a bit of consistency within your project.
