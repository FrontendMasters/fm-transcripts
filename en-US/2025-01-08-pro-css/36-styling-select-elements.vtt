1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.026
Next up, we have our selects that we wanna
style before we can keep on going up here,

2
00:00:04.026 --> 00:00:05.937
so we'll finish up with this section.

3
00:00:05.937 --> 00:00:08.607
So I'm gonna jump on over
to the mushroom guide here.

4
00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:12.445
The first thing I'm gonna do is I noticed
everything is really glued together.

5
00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:17.467
So inside my wrapper I am
gonna do a class of flow.

6
00:00:20.227 --> 00:00:24.637
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: We're gonna collapse this
down just cuz it takes up so much room and

7
00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:28.905
close that div, just to give us
that flow spacing we were doing.

8
00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:31.667
Again, if you decided to put
that flow on the wrapper,

9
00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:33.419
you'd have the same result here.

10
00:00:33.419 --> 00:00:36.089
And if you collapse everything down,
it's just adding the spacing.

11
00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:39.766
We have the h2, we get the spacing,
that's no spacing.

12
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:42.134
But it's adding the spacing
on top of the selects, and

13
00:00:42.134 --> 00:00:45.500
then it's adding the spacing here on top
of the grid that we have right there.

14
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.007
For these selects, we do wanna
do a couple of things with them.

15
00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:50.720
We need to change what they look like.

16
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.214
If you're in different browsers,
these will look a little bit different,

17
00:00:54.214 --> 00:00:57.720
styling an actual select right now is
something that's not very easy to do.

18
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.701
The select that we see here is fine,

19
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:03.416
it's the options inside that you
have basically no control over.

20
00:01:03.416 --> 00:01:07.364
There is work going on right
now to make selects styleable.

21
00:01:07.364 --> 00:01:10.418
Originally, we were gonna have a Select
menu, it was gonna be a new element.

22
00:01:10.418 --> 00:01:12.299
Now they're just giving us, I believe,

23
00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.948
it's new pseudo class instead
that we'll be able to add.

24
00:01:14.948 --> 00:01:17.788
I think it's only supported
in Chrome Canary right now or

25
00:01:17.788 --> 00:01:21.988
it might be in Chrome behind a flag, I'm
not sure, it's really experimental, but

26
00:01:21.988 --> 00:01:24.321
we will have styleable
selects in the future.

27
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:27.463
So if you're watching this,
you could look into that.

28
00:01:27.463 --> 00:01:31.755
But as of the time of doing this,
we cannot do anything on the really

29
00:01:31.755 --> 00:01:35.753
cool styling stuff, but
we can do some basic styling on them.

30
00:01:35.753 --> 00:01:40.595
The first thing I am going to do, though,
is just put a div here around my selects

31
00:01:40.595 --> 00:01:44.305
cuz one problem is they're
a little bit too close together.

32
00:01:46.385 --> 00:01:48.907
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: You'll notice that
they're already next to each other,

33
00:01:48.907 --> 00:01:50.609
selects are in-line elements-ish.

34
00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:53.249
They're sort of like images and
other things that go next to one another.

35
00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:54.702
But you can't control
the space between them.

36
00:01:54.702 --> 00:01:57.949
It's either an empty space or
they'll be stuck together.

37
00:01:57.949 --> 00:02:02.271
So by putting the div around there,
we can give that a class, and

38
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:04.764
I'm gonna call this a flex-group.

39
00:02:04.764 --> 00:02:05.817
We don't really need this.

40
00:02:05.817 --> 00:02:09.071
This is a class I use
on most of my projects.

41
00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:12.232
In this one, I don't happen to need
it except in this one space, but

42
00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:15.289
a lot of the time I do reuse this
class on lots of different things.

43
00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:17.204
We could even technically
use it on the navigation.

44
00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:20.451
Maybe we could have used it
on the tags here as well.

45
00:02:20.451 --> 00:02:24.674
But the flex-group, if I come to my CSS,

46
00:02:24.674 --> 00:02:28.308
I would put this in my layout layer.

47
00:02:28.308 --> 00:02:32.955
I'll put it right at
the top where I can do

48
00:02:32.955 --> 00:02:37.618
a flex-group is display: flex; gap.

49
00:02:37.618 --> 00:02:39.750
It's gonna look, actually,
a lot like what we did with our tags.

50
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.658
So we could always refactor the tags to
use it if you felt like you wanted to.

51
00:02:43.658 --> 00:02:49.178
A gap of 1 rem or
probably smaller actually, 0.5,

52
00:02:49.178 --> 00:02:55.898
and the optional, but I usually
put a flex-wrap of wrap on there.

53
00:02:58.091 --> 00:02:59.832
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And
let's just see if that.

54
00:02:59.832 --> 00:03:01.348
I didn't save my HTML file.

55
00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:02.615
So they're both saved.

56
00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:04.522
And because we're not changing much,

57
00:03:04.522 --> 00:03:08.581
you can always make the gap a lot bigger
just to verify that it's actually working.

58
00:03:08.581 --> 00:03:12.363
Cuz if you're making a small change to
something, you might wanna play with it.

59
00:03:12.363 --> 00:03:16.646
Always exaggerate if you're not sure
it's making a change, just to be safe.

60
00:03:19.506 --> 00:03:22.054
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So with a flex-group
like that is basically anytime you

61
00:03:22.054 --> 00:03:25.629
need things to go next to one another,
have a little bit of space between them,

62
00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.001
you just throw that on there.

63
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:31.063
Again, it's sort of like a layout utility
class that can be helpful in your

64
00:03:31.063 --> 00:03:31.716
projects.

65
00:03:31.716 --> 00:03:35.528
And with that done, that's in my layout
just cuz it's a reusable layout,

66
00:03:35.528 --> 00:03:38.387
I could potentially use that
anywhere I need in my site.

67
00:03:38.387 --> 00:03:41.612
I'm then gonna do a find
to go to my components.

68
00:03:41.612 --> 00:03:45.325
And in here,
I'm going to style my selects and

69
00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:49.051
I'm gonna do that down
where my buttons were.

70
00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:53.993
Just cuz I feel like it's related to
the buttons in the sense they're sort

71
00:03:53.993 --> 00:03:55.599
of like form elements.

72
00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.540
So there's the button and
going all the way down to the bottom.

73
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.194
And I can do a select, and I think I might
just do the general select like this.

74
00:04:04.194 --> 00:04:06.044
Cuz I think if you had
any selects on your site,

75
00:04:06.044 --> 00:04:07.668
they're probably gonna look the same.

76
00:04:07.668 --> 00:04:09.211
At least that's my thinking.

77
00:04:09.211 --> 00:04:11.614
It's rare that you have
different styling for them.

78
00:04:11.614 --> 00:04:14.506
But if you'd prefer to give it
a class like we did on our sections,

79
00:04:14.506 --> 00:04:17.408
it's fair enough, you could
definitely give it a class as well.

80
00:04:17.408 --> 00:04:19.570
And I'm just going to come in.

81
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.058
We don't need too much on there,

82
00:04:21.058 --> 00:04:25.314
a little bit of padding,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: A background-color,

83
00:04:27.528 --> 00:04:28.202
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: The green.

84
00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:30.984
So the green is our accent-main.

85
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.087
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: The color
is obviously wrong.

86
00:04:35.087 --> 00:04:38.061
Let's just go look fast,
I think my padding is way too big.

87
00:04:38.061 --> 00:04:41.856
So, yeah, we need the padding, the color,
I think the font is already okay.

88
00:04:43.357 --> 00:04:44.855
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So
the padding is a bit too big.

89
00:04:44.855 --> 00:04:50.665
The border: 0,
will always take a border off, whoops.

90
00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:56.769
Border-radius, probably, the 2.

91
00:04:56.769 --> 00:05:02.129
And the color will be the high-contrast.

92
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:08.180
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: One thing you'll notice
is the positioning of the little chevron

93
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.957
is not where it is in the design.

94
00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:12.515
If I do this,
I'll just shrink this down so

95
00:05:12.515 --> 00:05:14.943
if people want to see the code a bit more.

96
00:05:14.943 --> 00:05:17.050
But the chevron's thingy, the drop arrow,

97
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.661
isn't position the same way
as it is in the design here.

98
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:23.379
It's very similar,
might be a little bit off.

99
00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:25.131
Or you don't have control
over where that is.

100
00:05:25.131 --> 00:05:28.298
That's part of selects not being stylable.

101
00:05:28.298 --> 00:05:31.262
And I'm in Chrome right now, so
this is what the options look like.

102
00:05:31.262 --> 00:05:34.607
If you're in another browser,
it will look a little bit different.

103
00:05:34.607 --> 00:05:37.256
It's at the system level, so
the highlight-color could be different.

104
00:05:37.256 --> 00:05:40.986
Firefox, Safari, they all will look
slightly different from what you see here,

105
00:05:40.986 --> 00:05:42.676
there's nothing we can do about it.

106
00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:46.759
You just live with it, but for me this
is completely fine with how it's styled.

107
00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.693
I don't think it's worth stressing about
or coming in with a custom look for this.

108
00:05:49.693 --> 00:05:53.111
Cuz the advantage with using
the built in elements,

109
00:05:53.111 --> 00:05:58.094
if you don't need very specific styling
is they're keyboard accessible.

110
00:05:58.094 --> 00:06:02.233
So if I push Space, it opens it, and I
can use my arrow keys to go between them.

111
00:06:02.233 --> 00:06:06.907
And then I can select one of them
with either pushing Enter or, yeah,

112
00:06:06.907 --> 00:06:09.337
select one by pushing Enter there.

113
00:06:09.337 --> 00:06:13.404
Rebuilding that behavior in there
where the right keys are opening,

114
00:06:13.404 --> 00:06:15.237
closing, selecting things.

115
00:06:15.237 --> 00:06:18.348
If you wanna build a completely
custom one, is quite a lot of work.

116
00:06:18.348 --> 00:06:20.716
So it's always one of those
things of balancing out,

117
00:06:20.716 --> 00:06:23.250
is it worth coming in with
something completely custom?

118
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.376
Sometimes you have to do it,
but for now or for

119
00:06:26.376 --> 00:06:29.600
this project I think
this is completely fine.

120
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.476
And the last thing on that note is,
if you did want a custom chevron or

121
00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:36.196
something there that actually moves or
turns,

122
00:06:36.196 --> 00:06:39.463
you could technically do it
without any thing too fancy.

123
00:06:39.463 --> 00:06:44.217
But it would require you coming in and
wrapping the select in a div.

124
00:06:44.217 --> 00:06:47.868
And then you could use a pseudo
element as the dropdown arrow.

125
00:06:47.868 --> 00:06:52.913
Because you can't put a pseudo element
directly on a select, it won't work.

126
00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:54.300
You have to have an outer div.

127
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.593
All the stylings on the outer div,
you try and strip as much styling away on

128
00:06:58.593 --> 00:07:02.620
the select as you can and you sort
of style it through the other thing.

129
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.008
So it becomes a lot more work just to
change the little drop down to make it

130
00:07:06.008 --> 00:07:08.044
consistent from one browser to the other.

131
00:07:08.044 --> 00:07:10.903
So, again, that could be something
you could do as a progressive or

132
00:07:10.903 --> 00:07:13.314
an enhancement once we're
finished with this project,

133
00:07:13.314 --> 00:07:15.186
if it's something you'd wanna dive into.

134
00:07:15.186 --> 00:07:18.928
Here's the blog post, it's linked
in the lesson about feedback for

135
00:07:18.928 --> 00:07:20.294
customizable selects.

136
00:07:20.294 --> 00:07:22.994
Cuz it's really early,
early days right now.

137
00:07:22.994 --> 00:07:26.564
And the CSS Working Group's doing this
a lot, whereas, if they have a proposal,

138
00:07:26.564 --> 00:07:29.512
they build it into one of the browsers so
people can play with it, and

139
00:07:29.512 --> 00:07:30.788
then they ask for feedback.

140
00:07:30.788 --> 00:07:35.173
Is this what you want, does this work
the way that makes sense and all of that?

141
00:07:35.173 --> 00:07:37.039
So how they're doing it?

142
00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:42.584
Yeah, they're giving us this pseudo
element picker function thing.

143
00:07:42.584 --> 00:07:46.975
So you could actually style
things the way you'd want to.

144
00:07:46.975 --> 00:07:49.121
This is a long way away from
where we are right now.

145
00:07:49.121 --> 00:07:52.006
But if you're interested in it, it is in
the course notes if you wanna read more

146
00:07:52.006 --> 00:07:53.377
about it and give your opinion on it.

147
00:07:53.377 --> 00:07:55.921
Cuz they do need our opinions
when these things are happening.
