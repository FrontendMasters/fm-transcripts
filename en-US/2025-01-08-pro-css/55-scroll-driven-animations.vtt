1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.374
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Another really fun thing,
we're looking at a lot of animations,

2
00:00:03.374 --> 00:00:06.508
we did the view transitions,
we did animating from none, and

3
00:00:06.508 --> 00:00:09.598
we can also do scroll-driven
animations with CSS only now.

4
00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:15.103
You might have already done some of these
potentially with intersection observers,

5
00:00:15.103 --> 00:00:19.383
which are really cool, but
we can do a lot of CSS animations now, or

6
00:00:19.383 --> 00:00:24.292
a lot of animations now, based on scroll
position using some CSS features.

7
00:00:24.292 --> 00:00:27.367
I would say be very,
very careful with these please.

8
00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:30.045
It's a little bit like
I talked about before,

9
00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:34.524
where motion can just be overwhelming,and
it can just also be really tacky.

10
00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:39.248
So, [LAUGH] you want to be careful, not
just even right now, I find my navigation,

11
00:00:39.248 --> 00:00:41.313
some parts of it I would speed it up.

12
00:00:41.313 --> 00:00:44.850
And I'd also just make sure that
it's not a little bit too much.

13
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.740
Same thing with these scroll-driven
animations, you can feel like you want

14
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.730
everything, just, I can animate stuff
as I'm scrolling, it's super cool.

15
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.644
But just at one point,
it becomes a little bit much.

16
00:00:53.644 --> 00:00:58.022
And there's one advantage of
JavaScript scroll-driven animations,

17
00:00:58.022 --> 00:01:02.483
is that once it's fired,you can remove
that and it won't do it anymore.

18
00:01:02.483 --> 00:01:05.714
So if you have things animating onto
the page, and then as you scroll back up,

19
00:01:05.714 --> 00:01:09.262
then they animate back off, and then they
animate back on, you might not want that.

20
00:01:09.262 --> 00:01:12.565
With CSS, it's always going to just be
animating, whereas with JavaScript,

21
00:01:12.565 --> 00:01:15.079
it's a little bit easier just
to run the animation once, and

22
00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.579
then it's in that finished state.

23
00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.922
If you have any major motion and
other things, again, the preferred reduced

24
00:01:19.922 --> 00:01:23.277
motion, no preference, you might want
to include the animations in there.

25
00:01:23.277 --> 00:01:26.174
We're going to create a really simple
one for this, and I also want to look

26
00:01:26.174 --> 00:01:28.815
at a little bit of the pitfalls that
you can run into with it as well.

27
00:01:28.815 --> 00:01:31.227
If we jump in and
we take into our styles here,

28
00:01:31.227 --> 00:01:33.524
let's just come all the way to the bottom.

29
00:01:33.524 --> 00:01:38.889
And maybe you'd even have a a layer for
your animations.

30
00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:40.010
You could do that.

31
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.947
Layer, animations,
I don't know if we need it.

32
00:01:43.947 --> 00:01:45.906
If you feel like you do need it,
we can put it there,

33
00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:48.060
I'm just going to throw it at
the very bottom of my file.

34
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.441
I'm going to do an at key frames and
we'll call it fade-out.

35
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:57.394
0% or there's different ways you
can do key frame animations,

36
00:01:57.394 --> 00:02:01.314
if you haven't used animations before,
we're keeping it very simple,we're going

37
00:02:01.314 --> 00:02:03.962
to say where it's starting from and
where it's going to.

38
00:02:03.962 --> 00:02:08.421
So you could use percentages for
your keyframes, or

39
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:13.588
you could just say from
opacity: 1) to an opacity: 0),

40
00:02:13.588 --> 00:02:16.628
which just means it's fading out,

41
00:02:16.628 --> 00:02:22.127
we're going from this to that,
I think it's It's very clear.

42
00:02:22.127 --> 00:02:25.230
0%, 100% here would be the same thing.

43
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.569
Then, what we can do,

44
00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.975
is let's go find our hero,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And

45
00:02:32.975 --> 00:02:35.295
on the hero, I wanna fade that out.

46
00:02:35.295 --> 00:02:36.725
So we could say that,

47
00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:41.424
this has an animation: fade-out
which is the name of the animation.

48
00:02:41.424 --> 00:02:44.453
You also want to give it, generally
speaking, we'll do it the old school way.

49
00:02:44.453 --> 00:02:47.772
We'll say this is three seconds long,
and I'm gonna say forwards.

50
00:02:47.772 --> 00:02:52.035
And the forwards just means when you get
to the animation, stay at the last frame.

51
00:02:52.035 --> 00:02:55.626
So if I hit save on there, and I go and
look at my page, we'll go refresh it,

52
00:02:55.626 --> 00:02:57.907
over three seconds,
the hero's fading away.

53
00:02:57.907 --> 00:03:00.391
And then when we get to the end,
we have the Forwards on there, so

54
00:03:00.391 --> 00:03:02.241
it stays at that last frame and
it stays hidden.

55
00:03:02.241 --> 00:03:04.053
I'm actually going to
take away the forwards,

56
00:03:04.053 --> 00:03:05.470
and I'm wanna to take away the time.

57
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.808
We're just wanna to have
a fade out animation on there,

58
00:03:07.808 --> 00:03:10.396
because I don't want time to be
the eliminating factor here,

59
00:03:10.396 --> 00:03:13.810
the forwards you might want to leave,
but in this situation, we don't need it.

60
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.310
In some situations, you might need it.

61
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.573
So that's just testing and
playing with it and seeing what happens.

62
00:03:20.573 --> 00:03:24.421
And then we're gonna add
animation timeline here.

63
00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:29.642
And the animation timeline, you have
two options, you have either scroll,

64
00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:33.356
or I'll just do it like this for
now, or you have view.

65
00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:35.922
Those are the two different
ones that you can do.

66
00:03:35.922 --> 00:03:39.408
Scroll is gonna look from the top of
the page all the way to the bottom of

67
00:03:39.408 --> 00:03:39.963
the page.

68
00:03:39.963 --> 00:03:45.801
Whereas view is looking at that element
while it's inside the viewport.

69
00:03:45.801 --> 00:03:49.213
I think view is what you want most of the
time, because it's very rare that you're

70
00:03:49.213 --> 00:03:51.946
worried about top of the page all
the way to the bottom of the page.

71
00:03:51.946 --> 00:03:54.571
The one exception that I can
think of that's popular,

72
00:03:54.571 --> 00:03:58.049
is like a blog post that keeps track
of how far down the page you scrolled,

73
00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.209
so you sort of have like,
that's timeline going across the top.

74
00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.618
In that case, the scroll could
actually would be what you want.

75
00:04:06.618 --> 00:04:10.631
But if we just do view here,
hit save, it's kind of broken,

76
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:12.846
you can see it's working [LAUGH].

77
00:04:12.846 --> 00:04:16.296
And as I said, go down more,
it's fading out even more.

78
00:04:16.296 --> 00:04:19.495
The problem is the way that
the view works is by default,

79
00:04:19.495 --> 00:04:22.095
it will start the animation
somewhere else.

80
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.324
Let's also do this,
let's do this on every section.

81
00:04:24.324 --> 00:04:27.670
We're just gonna say section,
I'll just copy this.

82
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.654
I don't wanna leave it there, but it's
gonna show us better how it's working.

83
00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:36.504
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So, the animation starts
as soon as the section is entering

84
00:04:36.504 --> 00:04:37.505
the viewport.

85
00:04:37.505 --> 00:04:40.157
So, this green section,
it's already fade it out a little bit,

86
00:04:40.157 --> 00:04:41.277
though it's hard to tell.

87
00:04:41.277 --> 00:04:44.038
And then, when it gets to
the very top of the viewport,

88
00:04:44.038 --> 00:04:45.912
it's gonna hit the opacity of zero.

89
00:04:45.912 --> 00:04:50.607
Then this next one down there, as soon as
it enters the viewport, it's starting to

90
00:04:50.607 --> 00:04:55.033
fade away, and as soon as the entire thing
has reached the end of the viewport,

91
00:04:55.033 --> 00:04:57.811
then it hits that ending
state of the animation.

92
00:04:57.811 --> 00:05:02.770
This, again, we don't wanna do
it on each one of them, but

93
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.128
just to show you how this is working,
or some of the other options

94
00:05:08.128 --> 00:05:13.314
that we do have for these,
is to come in with an animation-r.

95
00:05:13.314 --> 00:05:17.245
And with the range as a shorthand,
we have a range end and

96
00:05:17.245 --> 00:05:21.608
a range start are the long form,
and range is for both of them.

97
00:05:21.608 --> 00:05:23.708
In this case,
I'm just gonna choose the start,

98
00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:25.925
cuz I wanna change when
the animation is starting.

99
00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:28.672
I don't want it to start right away.

100
00:05:28.672 --> 00:05:31.981
We're gonna start with one
though that's called cover,

101
00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:33.880
just to show you what cover does.

102
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.817
So cover means the animation
won't start until the element

103
00:05:38.817 --> 00:05:40.995
is fully in the viewport.

104
00:05:40.995 --> 00:05:42.088
I thought it would be here.

105
00:05:42.088 --> 00:05:43.316
It has to be within the viewport.

106
00:05:43.316 --> 00:05:45.369
This one's making more sense to me.

107
00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:47.469
But it's when we're covering it.

108
00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:51.928
What we actually want,
in this case, is exit.

109
00:05:51.928 --> 00:05:54.750
And this might seem a little bit strange,
but

110
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.958
it means we're starting the animation when
that element starts exiting the page.

111
00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.763
So, when the element starts exiting
the page, which is right here,

112
00:06:03.763 --> 00:06:07.714
when that here hits the top,
now it's actually starting to fade away.

113
00:06:07.714 --> 00:06:10.253
And then see how it clicked
in right there at the end.

114
00:06:10.253 --> 00:06:12.315
It's coming back in a little bit.

115
00:06:12.315 --> 00:06:19.219
The reason for that, is I mentioned you
might want to keep the forwards on here.

116
00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:24.753
That will keep it at the last frame, so it
won't actually, so that should, let's see.

117
00:06:24.753 --> 00:06:28.589
It's still doing it,
we'll tackle that in a second.

118
00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:32.931
But we'll go through this one should fade
away, and I guess probably click on again,

119
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:34.151
right at the end there.

120
00:06:34.151 --> 00:06:37.533
But it's fading away, and so
the animation is starting.

121
00:06:37.533 --> 00:06:40.038
This one's, Kinda broken because it's so
big of an element.

122
00:06:40.038 --> 00:06:42.983
But anyway,
you get the idea of how that's working.

123
00:06:42.983 --> 00:06:47.087
So I wouldn't do this on all of them, but
I would take this and move the animation

124
00:06:47.087 --> 00:06:50.703
range start just to be on the hero,
because if it's on every section,

125
00:06:50.703 --> 00:06:54.534
it's kind of annoying, and
I don't think users would appreciate that.

126
00:06:54.534 --> 00:06:57.273
But it's something at
the very top of the page,

127
00:06:57.273 --> 00:07:00.781
we could have it just fade away
as it's going down like that.

128
00:07:00.781 --> 00:07:04.371
And that somehow also fixed
that problem we had [LAUGH].

129
00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:06.538
Let me just take off the forwards,

130
00:07:06.538 --> 00:07:09.839
and just see if we get that
problem back again or not.

131
00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:10.608
Yeah, okay.

132
00:07:10.608 --> 00:07:15.238
So there's the problem, and then, so the
same thing as before, if I do forwards,

133
00:07:15.238 --> 00:07:17.951
it just means when we get
to that opacity of zero,

134
00:07:17.951 --> 00:07:22.081
we're gonna keep that opacityof zero,
once the animation is finished.

135
00:07:22.081 --> 00:07:25.871
And so now, with that there,
once we get to zero, it stays there.

136
00:07:25.871 --> 00:07:28.292
You wanna be a little
bit careful with this,

137
00:07:28.292 --> 00:07:32.743
because we are like making text disappear,
but for it could be a fun little effect

138
00:07:32.743 --> 00:07:35.641
where it just sort of fades
off as the user goes down.

139
00:07:35.641 --> 00:07:37.685
Why I say you have to be really
careful with this, though,

140
00:07:37.685 --> 00:07:39.201
with the sections it's kind of annoying.

141
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:43.605
You might be like, I could do something
cool, let's just copy the same thing.

142
00:07:43.605 --> 00:07:47.099
Copy that, I could do the same
thing on those cards, right?.

143
00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:50.482
[INAUDIBLE] Card,we could do that,
maybe not on exit, though,

144
00:07:50.482 --> 00:07:52.623
cuz that doesn't make sense for those.

145
00:07:52.623 --> 00:07:55.506
And now that can be kind of fun,
cuz you start playing around with it,

146
00:07:55.506 --> 00:07:57.771
you like your layout,
everything's looking good.

147
00:07:57.771 --> 00:08:03.791
And then you get to these Cards,
and we'll do the first page first.

148
00:08:03.791 --> 00:08:09.121
And, actually,
let's make a new animation for the cards.

149
00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:12.352
That's all the way at the bottom,
let's do a fade in.

150
00:08:12.352 --> 00:08:17.105
So for fade in,
all we're gonna do is switch the fade out,

151
00:08:17.105 --> 00:08:20.695
to a fade in, from a 0, to an opacity: 1.

152
00:08:20.695 --> 00:08:26.289
And then let's go find that card again,
that I just created, and the fade in.

153
00:08:26.289 --> 00:08:30.103
This is something people generally like
to do, where as you're going down,

154
00:08:30.103 --> 00:08:32.461
then you can have your
cards fade into the page.

155
00:08:32.461 --> 00:08:35.275
And in certain places,
it could actually look pretty good,

156
00:08:35.275 --> 00:08:39.081
we might want to tweak the ranges a little
bit, just to make sure that the right full

157
00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:42.140
opacity early enough on,
you could even do translates on those.

158
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.809
So they're like sliding in a little bit,
other things like that,

159
00:08:44.809 --> 00:08:46.537
you'd have a lot of fun with it, for sure.

160
00:08:46.537 --> 00:08:50.112
But, just be really careful, because
on this page, maybe with these ones,

161
00:08:50.112 --> 00:08:51.276
it actually works well.

162
00:08:51.276 --> 00:08:55.337
And we'd want to be careful there,
because there you can see it's coming in.

163
00:08:55.337 --> 00:08:59.217
I'm just gonna put a both here,
and see what happens.

164
00:08:59.217 --> 00:09:01.950
I think both might fix it for
everything, yeah.

165
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.032
So both is gonna keep it for
the forwards and the backwards, so

166
00:09:05.032 --> 00:09:09.419
it keeps the zero if it's at the beginning
of the animation, and it keeps the 100%,

167
00:09:09.419 --> 00:09:11.276
if it's at the end of the animation.

168
00:09:12.714 --> 00:09:16.369
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So, the cards fade in,
everything's fine, the user can use it.

169
00:09:16.369 --> 00:09:19.849
But, because I used the general.card
there, if I come onto here,

170
00:09:19.849 --> 00:09:22.414
it might be a little bit annoying,
because then,

171
00:09:22.414 --> 00:09:25.365
these are all sort of like
fading in,as I'm going down.

172
00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:27.364
I don't know if I like that as much.

173
00:09:27.364 --> 00:09:29.434
And then,
like this is still a little bit faded out.

174
00:09:29.434 --> 00:09:32.129
But then if I have other cards
that are close to the bottom,

175
00:09:32.129 --> 00:09:33.678
like this just looks weird to me.

176
00:09:33.678 --> 00:09:37.343
And then, why is this one faded out
a little bit and these ones, so you just

177
00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:41.447
wanna be really careful how you're using
it, don't do any blanket statements.

178
00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:44.744
And just be really careful with
animations, transitions, and

179
00:09:44.744 --> 00:09:45.727
things like that.

180
00:09:45.727 --> 00:09:49.503
I will say, for the prefers reduced
motion, don't worry about it for

181
00:09:49.503 --> 00:09:53.218
animation fading from micro animations,
little movement is fine.

182
00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:57.781
Micro animations can even improve the user
experience by telling them where to look.

183
00:09:57.781 --> 00:09:59.318
So for small things like this, it's fine.

184
00:09:59.318 --> 00:10:03.169
If you start throwing things around
the page as it's scrolling down,

185
00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:05.714
that's where you really
want to be careful and

186
00:10:05.714 --> 00:10:09.257
probably put things in the prefers
reduced motion media query.
