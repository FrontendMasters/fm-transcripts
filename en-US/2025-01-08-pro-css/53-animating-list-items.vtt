00:00:00.017 --> 00:00:03.817
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So, we have another
opportunity now to fancy this animation up

2
00:00:03.817 --> 00:00:08.908
even more, because when we're doing this
with our starting styles and all of that,

3
00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:13.784
while we're changing the display to block
and hidden of the navigation itself,

4
00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:16.749
that hides and
shows all of the children as well.

5
00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:20.120
So we can actually take advantage
of that to add animations or

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.711
transitions to the list
items if we wanted to.

7
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:27.200
Because right now, when I click on this,
and it slides down and then slides out,

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.576
what we could do is actually have the
individual list items animating as well.

9
00:00:31.576 --> 00:00:38.067
So, let's say we came on the primary
navigation that's right here,

10
00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:42.039
and I'm just want to select the list item.

11
00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:43.994
So let's actually go to
my regular ones first.

12
00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:47.099
I just wanna be in my primary navigation.

13
00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:49.090
There's my uL, so we'll come right here.

14
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.155
Let's just say Li, and

15
00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:56.434
we'll do a translate of
50%,just to see what that does.

16
00:00:56.434 --> 00:01:01.762
So when we open it, sort of shoved
off to the side a little bit,

17
00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:06.885
and we can come and
say this has a transition: translate and

18
00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:13.570
I'll just do 1s, I'm doing two there so
it's the transition plus a delay.

19
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.616
Don't keep these are way too long for
things like menus you do want users to

20
00:01:17.616 --> 00:01:22.121
be able to interact with put them pretty
quickly, but for educational purposes,

21
00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:24.097
I'm going pretty slow with these.

22
00:01:24.097 --> 00:01:29.160
So, we're going to
transition that translate,

23
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.100
and we can do that,
by coming here, where we have

24
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.922
that primary navigation, when it's opened,

25
00:01:38.922 --> 00:01:43.038
the Li can then have a translate of 00.

26
00:01:43.038 --> 00:01:47.971
So, ideally, it would actually be doing
that transition that we've run into that

27
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:49.944
same problem that we had before,

28
00:01:49.944 --> 00:01:53.396
where even though it's
the parent that's display none,

29
00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:58.619
all the children in there are also display
none, just because the parent isn't there.

30
00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.660
So they're getting added to the Page 2.

31
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.076
So on here,
we can also add a starting style.

32
00:02:05.977 --> 00:02:11.669
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And then,
translate 0 50%, I think is what we want.

33
00:02:14.162 --> 00:02:16.256
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: [LAUGH] wrong way,
that was kind of cool actually.

34
00:02:16.256 --> 00:02:18.753
That was completely accidental but
I kind of like that.

35
00:02:18.753 --> 00:02:22.014
[LAUGH] nice.

36
00:02:22.014 --> 00:02:25.820
We'll do it the other way,

37
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.791
negative 50%, it probably 0.

38
00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:33.739
And then so when I open them,
The other way, and

39
00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.763
then they can slide in we'll do it.

40
00:02:35.763 --> 00:02:40.800
One more time, and then we can
have them slide in a little bit.

41
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.131
Of course, if we're doing that, it would
also make sense for the starting-style

42
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:51.477
here, actually have no opacity of 0, and
then this would go up to an opacity of 1.

43
00:02:51.477 --> 00:02:55.130
So, we don't see them until
they start sliding in.

44
00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.414
And then, also just means up here,
I also wanna do my opacity,

45
00:03:00.414 --> 00:03:03.627
and for now, we'll do the 1s, 1s.

46
00:03:03.627 --> 00:03:09.150
So leaves, comes in,
Oop!, I broke something.

47
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.407
Transition, translate opacity.

48
00:03:14.298 --> 00:03:16.297
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Semicolon
after your opacity.

49
00:03:16.297 --> 00:03:17.957
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Thank you.

50
00:03:17.957 --> 00:03:19.109
Appreciate that.

51
00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:24.025
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Now,
I broke something else.

52
00:03:24.025 --> 00:03:26.636
There we go, and then they slide in.

53
00:03:26.636 --> 00:03:30.571
Not the coolest thing I like the sort of
the drop down I might change it after.

54
00:03:30.571 --> 00:03:31.572
[LAUGH] To be the other way,

55
00:03:31.572 --> 00:03:33.764
where they sort of bounced
upwards that was kind of neat.

56
00:03:33.764 --> 00:03:36.054
But, we'll stick with
what I was doing here,

57
00:03:36.054 --> 00:03:39.637
because there's one more thing that we
can do just to make it look a little

58
00:03:39.637 --> 00:03:42.728
bit cooler, at the same time where
we come all the way back up.

59
00:03:42.728 --> 00:03:45.432
And, what I would do is, on these,

60
00:03:45.432 --> 00:03:50.756
I would instead of having the delay
set like I'm setting it right now,

61
00:03:50.756 --> 00:03:56.463
what we could do is come in with
an animation, or we'll just call it delay.

62
00:03:56.463 --> 00:04:02.748
It's going to be a bit faster, and so
my delay as a default could be one second.

63
00:04:02.748 --> 00:04:06.546
And then so this is my delay here,

64
00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:12.377
var (--- delay) and var (--- delay), so

65
00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:17.954
everything should be
exactly the same as it was.

66
00:04:17.954 --> 00:04:20.217
And then they all slide in
with that delay on there.

67
00:04:20.217 --> 00:04:26.097
But then I could say that I
have my li nth child (2).

68
00:04:26.097 --> 00:04:31.786
And, we could say the delay is now 1.25s,
let's say.

69
00:04:31.786 --> 00:04:36.668
And li nth child(3),

70
00:04:36.668 --> 00:04:42.719
has a delay of 1.5 seconds.

71
00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:45.828
And again, if you're doing this, please
use faster times cuz users don't wanna

72
00:04:45.828 --> 00:04:48.232
wait that long for their animation or
for their menu to come in.

73
00:04:48.232 --> 00:04:54.323
And then we get a nice little,
[LAUGH] animation.

74
00:04:54.323 --> 00:04:56.553
Again, another nice little use case for

75
00:04:56.553 --> 00:05:00.368
custom properties there just to
add this little staggering effect.

76
00:05:00.368 --> 00:05:04.889
If you had tons of elements and you needed
them to sort of slide in, that might be

77
00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.408
a good use case for JavaScript too, just
to loop through, and you could do a set

78
00:05:09.408 --> 00:05:13.066
the delays through a just a style
attribute on each one of them.

79
00:05:13.066 --> 00:05:14.435
But if you just have three elements,

80
00:05:14.435 --> 00:05:16.429
it's easy enough to do it
within the child like this.
