00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.103
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: There's one last thing
that we wanna do with our navigation,

2
00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:06.217
which is making an easy way for
people to skip the navigation.

3
00:00:06.217 --> 00:00:10.012
And this might seem like why would
you wanna skip your navigation, but

4
00:00:10.012 --> 00:00:13.752
let's go over to frontendmasters.com,
who gives us this option.

5
00:00:13.752 --> 00:00:17.872
If you go to most websites online and
you hit Tab on your keyboard to get into

6
00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:21.137
the page, you can see a skip
to main content is showing up.

7
00:00:21.137 --> 00:00:24.222
You're not gonna be able to get
that to that with your mouse.

8
00:00:24.222 --> 00:00:27.601
You're only gonna get to it if you're
keyboard navigating, and if a hit enter,

9
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:30.449
it skips the navigation and
it goes to the other content on the page.

10
00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.319
The reason for this is, and there's a lot
of users who use keyboard navigation.

11
00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:38.674
They say, you come and
you go to your courses page, and

12
00:00:38.674 --> 00:00:42.664
then you start keyboard
navigating on this page.

13
00:00:42.664 --> 00:00:45.585
Imagine you go to the Courses page,
and then you have to go through

14
00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:48.577
all of these again to get to
the content that you just navigated to.

15
00:00:48.577 --> 00:00:51.729
And then finally, I get to it,
and then you go to another page.

16
00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.871
And then you tab, and you have to tab all
the way past all those navigation links

17
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:58.023
again and every page you're going to,
it's a very frustrating experience.

18
00:00:58.023 --> 00:00:59.112
So what you do is,

19
00:00:59.112 --> 00:01:04.056
the very first focusable element on the
page should be this skip to main content,

20
00:01:04.056 --> 00:01:08.874
which, again, click that then when I
tab through them into the main content.

21
00:01:08.874 --> 00:01:10.682
So it makes life a lot easier.

22
00:01:10.682 --> 00:01:14.016
It's very easy to implement, and it's
something that we should have on all of

23
00:01:14.016 --> 00:01:15.948
our projects that have
a navigation in them.

24
00:01:15.948 --> 00:01:22.211
So to be able to create that,
we can come in here.

25
00:01:22.211 --> 00:01:25.847
Using source control, once again,
we can create a new branch.

26
00:01:25.847 --> 00:01:29.417
So we can click on our
little branch at the bottom,

27
00:01:29.417 --> 00:01:33.591
create new branch, and
we can do skip-to-main-link.

28
00:01:35.937 --> 00:01:39.865
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Publish that branch,
so that branch is on Github and

29
00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:42.467
now we wannna get started with it.

30
00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:45.354
Let's just control, close that down.

31
00:01:45.354 --> 00:01:48.704
This is a part where you can decide
how you want to do things or

32
00:01:48.704 --> 00:01:50.515
what you wanna do to style it up.

33
00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:53.752
The very first thing
you're gonna wanna do,

34
00:01:53.752 --> 00:01:59.560
as long as it's the first stylable element
on your page, you can focus, sorry.

35
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.737
As long as it's the first focusable
element on your page, it's good.

36
00:02:03.737 --> 00:02:05.488
So you just have to decide
where you wanna put it,

37
00:02:05.488 --> 00:02:07.384
I'm gonna put it right as
the first thing in my body.

38
00:02:07.384 --> 00:02:10.707
It could be the first thing in your
header, it's really up to you.

39
00:02:10.707 --> 00:02:14.644
We'll just put a link that's
going to go to my main,

40
00:02:14.644 --> 00:02:17.246
it's going to say, skip to main.

41
00:02:17.246 --> 00:02:20.347
And let's give that a class so

42
00:02:20.347 --> 00:02:26.054
we can select it with CSS,
class = skip-to-main and

43
00:02:26.054 --> 00:02:31.527
maybe this could be skip
to main content right here.

44
00:02:31.527 --> 00:02:36.470
Now, if we go and take a look at our page,
we will get this big skip

45
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.066
to main that shows up here at the top,
which we don't want.

46
00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:45.668
The other thing is when you just click it,
we wanna to bring them somewhere, so

47
00:02:45.668 --> 00:02:47.828
I already put that, when I did that,

48
00:02:47.828 --> 00:02:50.711
we say that the href is
going to a hashtag of main.

49
00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:53.949
So we just come down to my main and
give that and

50
00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:57.952
id = main as well, so
when we click on it, I saved that,

51
00:02:57.952 --> 00:03:03.018
when I click It should shift down
a little bit and go to my main content.

52
00:03:03.018 --> 00:03:07.210
So you know it's working if it
does that little jump right there.

53
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.675
As far as styling this, we only want it
to be visible when users focus on it, so

54
00:03:11.675 --> 00:03:14.590
the only way you can get
to it is with the keyboard.

55
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.211
And to be able to do that, we've already
written some code that hides things.

56
00:03:18.211 --> 00:03:23.476
So we're gonna hook in, we're going to
steal that code that we already wrote, and

57
00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:28.538
it was all the way down in our utilities
layer, and it was this visually hidden.

58
00:03:28.538 --> 00:03:32.587
Now I don't wanna use the visually hidden
class on this, because if I use it,

59
00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:36.033
it's always going to be gone, and
there's no way to get into it.

60
00:03:36.033 --> 00:03:40.002
There is the option to modify the visually
hidden a little bit to just treat it so

61
00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:43.190
because this is a focusable element,
it still would work, but

62
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.497
we're gonna do it
a little bit differently.

63
00:03:45.497 --> 00:03:48.927
So I'm just gonna copy the same
code that we have here, and

64
00:03:48.927 --> 00:03:50.689
I consider this a component.

65
00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.719
So let's go find my layer
components right there, and

66
00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:59.811
it's the first thing on my page, so
I can put it right here at the top.

67
00:03:59.811 --> 00:04:05.660
.skip-to-main, I can paste that in.

68
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.922
So it will disappear, like the visually
hidden things have been doing

69
00:04:10.922 --> 00:04:16.104
up until now, but we come here and
we can use our not and say not focus.

70
00:04:16.104 --> 00:04:21.119
So if the element is not being focused on,
so if I tab, it's the very first thing.

71
00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:25.110
There we go, you can see it shows up on
my page and then if I push tab again,

72
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.099
we go into there.

73
00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:30.021
And if I go, shift tab goes backwards,
if ever you're keyboard navigating.

74
00:04:30.021 --> 00:04:32.083
So shift tab, I can see it again.

75
00:04:33.595 --> 00:04:36.188
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: One thing you don't
want it to do, is when we do this,

76
00:04:36.188 --> 00:04:40.239
you can see it's actually stretching the
top of the page cuz it's taking up space.

77
00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:43.806
So this is the typical type
of thing you would have

78
00:04:43.806 --> 00:04:46.421
definitely a display absolute on.

79
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:51.131
I caught myself, position absolute.

80
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:53.719
Display absolute is the most
common mistake I make and

81
00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:55.916
I can never figure out
why it's not working.

82
00:04:55.916 --> 00:05:00.086
Position absolute, just so
it's out of the flow.

83
00:05:00.086 --> 00:05:02.858
And then you can have fun
styling it however you want.

84
00:05:02.858 --> 00:05:04.756
Maybe we don't have anything,

85
00:05:04.756 --> 00:05:09.269
it's very rare that even your designers
will tell you how this gets to look.

86
00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:12.870
Usually, I give it a bit of padding,
a background color, so it stands out,

87
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:13.729
just something.

88
00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.528
So it's obvious that when it comes in,
people can see that they are on that.

89
00:05:17.528 --> 00:05:20.447
So you can style this up however you want,
I'm gonna do a little bit now.

90
00:05:20.447 --> 00:05:21.737
But you can code along, or

91
00:05:21.737 --> 00:05:24.972
you can just choose whatever styles
you'd prefer to put on this.

92
00:05:24.972 --> 00:05:31.021
But as I said, I like giving it
a background, so I'll use my accent main,

93
00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:35.120
which is the green one,
give it some padding, and

94
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.510
I guess a border radius would
probably look pretty good on there.

95
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:47.723
Something like that, did not mean
to jump to the bottom of my page.

96
00:05:47.723 --> 00:05:54.121
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Said, do you have
absolute positioning twice there?

97
00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:55.156
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Do I?

98
00:05:55.156 --> 00:05:56.754
I didn't need to add it, thank you.

99
00:05:59.948 --> 00:06:02.081
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: That's weird,
then why is it pushing my content down?

100
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.626
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Skip-to-main
: not(:focus).

101
00:06:23.742 --> 00:06:26.672
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Sorry no,
that should still work.

102
00:06:26.672 --> 00:06:30.329
One way you can debug a little bit if you
have focus elements is, in your Dev tools,

103
00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:31.661
there's this hover option.

104
00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:32.745
All of them have it somewhere.

105
00:06:32.745 --> 00:06:36.440
It's a little bit different depending on
the browser, and I don't want hover, but

106
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.648
I want when it's focused.

107
00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:42.949
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: I know what I did wrong,
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:45.581
I'm gonna cut these darlings off,

109
00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:49.537
I'm doing everything when
it's not being focused.

110
00:06:49.537 --> 00:06:53.278
So then when I did focus it,
it wasn't getting any of these styles.

111
00:06:53.278 --> 00:06:56.337
So we have that for
when it's not focused, and

112
00:06:56.337 --> 00:07:01.446
then we can have a regular skip-to-main
right here for the rest of the time.

113
00:07:01.446 --> 00:07:05.205
And on that, I'll want also that position.

114
00:07:06.923 --> 00:07:10.210
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Absolute, there we go.

115
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.848
So I can see it's come in there.

116
00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:15.168
You can move it off the side of the page
a little bit with your top, your left.

117
00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:16.671
Some people like it centered.

118
00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:20.587
Some people like to animate it in
with a transition, so it slides in.

119
00:07:20.587 --> 00:07:23.511
It's really up to you
how you wanna set it up.

120
00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:27.930
So, if we're near the top of the page,
when I tab on it,

121
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.520
it's there when I tab off,
tab on, tab off.

122
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.000
And yeah, just make sure this is
the styling when it's not visible, so

123
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.169
we're hiding it here.

124
00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:40.546
So don't put any of these styles you
want of what it looks like in that.

125
00:07:40.546 --> 00:07:44.105
Just put them on the regular
selector that comes afterwards.

126
00:07:44.105 --> 00:07:45.516
Now with that done, the future's done.

127
00:07:45.516 --> 00:07:49.865
That was a really nice easy win,
but we created a branch for that.

128
00:07:49.865 --> 00:07:52.652
So once again,
we wanna come into our source control.

129
00:07:52.652 --> 00:07:56.458
Let's just go full screen with VS Code and
zoom back out a little bit.

130
00:07:58.534 --> 00:08:02.644
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And we can come here,
we can stage all of those changes.

131
00:08:02.644 --> 00:08:04.754
I'm just gonna hide this bottom
thing cuz it makes it visually

132
00:08:04.754 --> 00:08:05.613
cluttered a little bit.

133
00:08:05.613 --> 00:08:10.542
I'm gonna stage those changes,
we can say added,

134
00:08:10.542 --> 00:08:15.370
skip to main link, commit,
sync those changes.

135
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.004
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: I have it over here,
jump back over.

136
00:08:22.004 --> 00:08:28.398
I think I closed my GitHub repo,
GitHub fem.

137
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:35.480
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: We have
skip-to-main link compare and

138
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:42.992
pull, you can write your description
added a skip to main for

139
00:08:42.992 --> 00:08:48.163
better a11y and keyboard navigation.

140
00:08:48.163 --> 00:08:50.562
And give more details,
whatever you want there.

141
00:08:50.562 --> 00:08:55.243
Create the pull request,
we should run into no issues.

142
00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:56.546
So then we can merge it.

143
00:08:56.546 --> 00:09:00.533
I can merge it now, even though Netlify
hasn't done the build for it, it's up to

144
00:09:00.533 --> 00:09:04.419
you, if you hit it fast enough, then
Netlify just won't bother building it.

145
00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:07.368
We can now delete my branch.

146
00:09:07.368 --> 00:09:10.998
Go back over to GitHub, and I'm doing
this part a little bit faster this time,

147
00:09:10.998 --> 00:09:13.708
just because we just went
through these exact same steps.

148
00:09:13.708 --> 00:09:17.154
Sorry, not back to GitHub yet,
back to VS code.

149
00:09:17.154 --> 00:09:21.593
We can go back to our main branch.

150
00:09:21.593 --> 00:09:28.517
If we look at our source control graph,
we should see, let's see refresh that.

151
00:09:28.517 --> 00:09:29.754
There we go.

152
00:09:29.754 --> 00:09:31.014
That's if you don't see those,

153
00:09:31.014 --> 00:09:33.225
there is that refresh button
down here that I just pushed.

154
00:09:33.225 --> 00:09:38.267
And it brought that in, so I can see that
this is being brought back in right there.

155
00:09:38.267 --> 00:09:43.322
And that means that we can see that I'm on
my main branch, all of this is come in.

156
00:09:43.322 --> 00:09:48.934
Because all of that has come in, I can
then safely go in my source control here,

157
00:09:48.934 --> 00:09:52.177
go to my branch, and
I can delete the branch.

158
00:09:52.177 --> 00:09:54.454
Skip-to-main, because all
of those changes are here.

159
00:09:54.454 --> 00:09:56.152
If you'd rather leave that there,

160
00:09:56.152 --> 00:09:59.611
again you can but what happens if you
start making all of these branches?

161
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:02.077
You'll just have tons of branches
that are all finished and

162
00:10:02.077 --> 00:10:04.407
you're not actually gonna
be working on them anymore.

163
00:10:04.407 --> 00:10:06.727
So, I like cleaning them up as I go.

164
00:10:06.727 --> 00:10:09.822
As long just make sure you've
merged your changes and

165
00:10:09.822 --> 00:10:13.690
brought them into the main branch
before you delete the other one.

166
00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.482
So there we go, all of that is done.

167
00:10:15.482 --> 00:10:20.170
Our first page is finished, and
now we can go into the second page and

168
00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.153
have some fun with that one.
