00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.525
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And speaking of writing
CSS, we're gonna be diving into it now,

2
00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:07.178
but before we write one line of CSS,
one thing that you should decide

3
00:00:07.178 --> 00:00:11.176
at the beginning of a project is how
you're going to approach writing it.

4
00:00:11.176 --> 00:00:15.562
Because a lot of the time I'm teaching
people at the very beginning of what

5
00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:20.441
they're learning, as soon as we get this
on the page, the first thing is, okay,

6
00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:21.525
let's style it.

7
00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:25.222
Because first of all,
it's boring looking at a page of the white

8
00:00:25.222 --> 00:00:28.030
background black text that
has no styling on it,

9
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.194
but also it feels like the right
time to start doing it.

10
00:00:31.194 --> 00:00:34.262
So the instinct at this point for a lot
of people is to start writing CSS for

11
00:00:34.262 --> 00:00:36.893
what they have here and
then they'll continue down the page.

12
00:00:36.893 --> 00:00:39.612
Or maybe they'll even just
write all the HTML and

13
00:00:39.612 --> 00:00:43.341
then they just dive in at the top of
the page and work their way down.

14
00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:45.092
I'm gonna say instead of doing that,

15
00:00:45.092 --> 00:00:47.618
you wanna have a plan in place
from the very beginning.

16
00:00:47.618 --> 00:00:50.094
Have an idea of how you wanna
be authoring your CSS and

17
00:00:50.094 --> 00:00:53.768
having an idea of what you're going to
be doing to make it as easy as possible.

18
00:00:53.768 --> 00:00:57.426
And just so you can maintain it in
the long run, instead of just being,

19
00:00:57.426 --> 00:00:58.980
this has a brown background.

20
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.438
This is a green, brown, green,
you're just redeclaring things over and

21
00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:07.355
over again, we wanna try to avoid
doing that as much as possible.

22
00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:09.903
Because this is a solo project,
you're doing it on your own,

23
00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.181
you're not working in a team.

24
00:01:11.181 --> 00:01:15.469
You get to decide how you wanna be doing
this and I'm gonna be hopefully throwing

25
00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.441
some ideas and things along the way to
you so you can make these decisions.

26
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:22.240
This obviously comes the big caveat
that if you're working in a team,

27
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.434
the right approach is whatever
your team has decided.

28
00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:26.544
So even if you disagree with it,
you don't have a choice,

29
00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:28.757
everybody needs to be consistent
with what they're doing.

30
00:01:28.757 --> 00:01:32.865
The big topic that always comes
up is utility first versus,

31
00:01:32.865 --> 00:01:35.836
quote, unquote, traditional methods.

32
00:01:35.836 --> 00:01:37.800
With the rise of Tailwind, obviously,

33
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.470
utility classes have become
very popular these days.

34
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.330
We have Tailwind and
lots of other utility libraries that have

35
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.140
come up that do things a little
bit differently than they do.

36
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.944
Tailwind can have its place
depending on how you're working, but

37
00:01:48.944 --> 00:01:50.905
in a vanilla project
like we're doing today.

38
00:01:50.905 --> 00:01:54.355
It doesn't really make sense just
cuz we're not gonna be working with

39
00:01:54.355 --> 00:01:58.685
component-based Javascript framework where
utility classes can actually be a little

40
00:01:58.685 --> 00:01:59.575
bit more useful.

41
00:01:59.575 --> 00:02:02.075
When you have to repeat yourself over and
over and over again for

42
00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:03.217
everything you're doing.

43
00:02:03.217 --> 00:02:07.358
Instead of having a component where
those classes only have to live once.

44
00:02:07.358 --> 00:02:10.110
Going in with a bit more of a traditional
method does make sense, and

45
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.366
we'll talk more about that idea between
the two of them as we go through things.

46
00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:17.234
But just not going all in with that,
I think for this type of project,

47
00:02:17.234 --> 00:02:18.378
it does make sense.

48
00:02:18.378 --> 00:02:21.439
The other thing though on that
is don't be dogmatic about

49
00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.105
how you're writing your CSS.

50
00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:26.696
I mentioned in one of the early lessons
that my own way of writing CSS has changed

51
00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:29.815
over the years, and it's gonna
continue changing as time goes on.

52
00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:32.553
Don't be the type of person that
says this is the right way to do it.

53
00:02:32.553 --> 00:02:35.874
It might be the right way for you, but
that doesn't mean it's the right way for

54
00:02:35.874 --> 00:02:36.438
everybody.

55
00:02:36.438 --> 00:02:39.014
And different projects are gonna
have different requirements and

56
00:02:39.014 --> 00:02:41.271
different approaches that you
might need to take to them.

57
00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:44.372
So in one project one way might be better,
in another project there might be

58
00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:47.098
an alternative that you can use
that would benefit that project.

59
00:02:47.098 --> 00:02:49.853
You wanna look at the whole
thing before you decide,

60
00:02:49.853 --> 00:02:52.542
I'm a very big fan of
finding a balance in general,

61
00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:56.563
I find that helps working in no matter
what size project you're working on.

62
00:02:56.563 --> 00:03:00.579
I used to be the biggest proponent of BEM,
it's what I used in every project I I did.

63
00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.701
And then slowly I started
using more utility classes and

64
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:06.701
sneaking them into BEM against
the rules of using it.

65
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:10.738
And then I actually had a push going
really far into utility classes, and

66
00:03:10.738 --> 00:03:12.788
then I found a bit of a middle ground,

67
00:03:12.788 --> 00:03:15.720
which is a bit of what I'll
be showing you all today.

68
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.729
And just finding sort of the right
balance between using them or

69
00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.330
what I feel is the right balance.

70
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.468
But that can change depending, again,
on the project, on the person, and

71
00:03:23.468 --> 00:03:24.804
everything else along the way.

72
00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:27.193
So in deciding all of
this from the beginning,

73
00:03:27.193 --> 00:03:30.210
the first thing I would suggest
is looking at the project.

74
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.804
And I said, we're gonna create a plan of
attack and do all of that, and deciding on

75
00:03:34.804 --> 00:03:39.486
how you wanna approach it, means looking
at the design and not looking at that one.

76
00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:43.708
I'm modifying the design not looking at
that one thing that we were just looking

77
00:03:43.708 --> 00:03:44.347
at before.

78
00:03:44.347 --> 00:03:47.853
Cuz when you could just come in and
you hyper focus on one area like that,

79
00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:50.903
it's really easy to say,
this is how I'm going to code this.

80
00:03:50.903 --> 00:03:54.984
And you could take 10,000 different ways
of coding this or spreading the CSS for

81
00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:58.508
this, and they'd all be perfectly
fine if this was your entire project.

82
00:03:58.508 --> 00:04:00.631
But then when you start zooming out,

83
00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:05.028
you start seeing a few things where you
might be able to get a bigger picture.

84
00:04:05.028 --> 00:04:09.431
We have certain widths of our site,
so this area here's kind of narrow,

85
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:14.285
where the text is, we have this area's
a bit wider, this area's really wide.

86
00:04:14.285 --> 00:04:18.447
We have the different background colors
that are going on, medium brown, the dark

87
00:04:18.447 --> 00:04:22.441
green, the dark brown, and the medium
brown, they sort of repeat each other.

88
00:04:22.441 --> 00:04:24.422
We have these cards that are coming in,
and

89
00:04:24.422 --> 00:04:27.737
the cards are a little bit of a tricky
one, cause I'm calling it a card.

90
00:04:27.737 --> 00:04:31.310
We have a background color,
we have a border radius on there,

91
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.241
and we have orange text as the title and
the paragraph text in there.

92
00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:39.619
If I come look over here, we have a very
similar thing but the title is different.

93
00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:42.838
But we still have the same background
color, the same padding on there, and

94
00:04:42.838 --> 00:04:43.904
the same border radius.

95
00:04:43.904 --> 00:04:46.458
And then over here as well,
we have the same background color,

96
00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:48.541
the same border radius and
other things like that.

97
00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:51.935
So looking beyond that first page, and
looking beyond the top of it, you can

98
00:04:51.935 --> 00:04:55.717
start looking for things where you go,
okay, maybe I see these similarities here.

99
00:04:55.717 --> 00:04:58.416
I wanna start thinking about that and
finding ways that,

100
00:04:58.416 --> 00:05:00.788
how can I address that and
how can I build those up.

101
00:05:00.788 --> 00:05:04.273
You don't need to have a plan right away,
but just being aware of those things.

102
00:05:04.273 --> 00:05:07.911
If I look at my images, all of
the images have border radiuses on them.

103
00:05:07.911 --> 00:05:09.488
These ones are a bit smaller,

104
00:05:09.488 --> 00:05:12.653
these images that are larger
have larger border radiuses.

105
00:05:12.653 --> 00:05:16.102
How would you tackle that,
what would you do to approach that?

106
00:05:16.102 --> 00:05:20.416
The text color in some places or
the font size and the text color changes.

107
00:05:20.416 --> 00:05:23.917
We have small text,
we have bigger paragraph text,

108
00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:25.917
even bigger paragraph text.

109
00:05:25.917 --> 00:05:30.806
How would you approach doing that,
how would you change the color from sort

110
00:05:30.806 --> 00:05:34.391
of a faded out white a little bit,
to the bright white.

111
00:05:34.391 --> 00:05:37.490
And how are you gonna decide on all of
these things, and looking at the entire

112
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.025
thing, and then poking and
looking at the mobile design too.

113
00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:42.818
To see if there's any big differences
that happen there with the font sizes and

114
00:05:42.818 --> 00:05:43.506
the other things.

115
00:05:43.506 --> 00:05:47.222
You really need to look at all of this
before you can decide on what you think is

116
00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:48.980
going to work best for the project.

117
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.920
Again, you don't need to have this is
exactly how I'm going to tackle each

118
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.993
one of these problems, but

119
00:05:52.993 --> 00:05:55.483
by being aware that these are all
things you need to figure out.

120
00:05:55.483 --> 00:05:58.487
It's gonna at least get you in the right
frame of mind as you're going through

121
00:05:58.487 --> 00:06:00.770
things to be looking at
everything in the bigger picture.

122
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.994
And when you are looking after when you
get down to say this section right here,

123
00:06:04.994 --> 00:06:09.557
you might look at this section and
then go, I'm putting these cards together.

124
00:06:09.557 --> 00:06:12.443
But I remember there's three
different types of cards, so

125
00:06:12.443 --> 00:06:14.129
I'm not just building this card.

126
00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:17.284
I'm building something that needs to
be able to be reused in different ways,

127
00:06:17.284 --> 00:06:19.577
with different title sizes and
other things like that.

128
00:06:19.577 --> 00:06:22.237
And then you have to start thinking about,
okay, how am I gonna do that title and

129
00:06:22.237 --> 00:06:23.045
those types of things?

130
00:06:23.045 --> 00:06:24.575
So always look big picture,

131
00:06:24.575 --> 00:06:28.803
analyze the design as much as possible
before you start writing any CSS at all.
