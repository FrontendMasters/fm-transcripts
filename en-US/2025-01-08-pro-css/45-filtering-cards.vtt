00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.897
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: So the next thing that we
need to do now is we need to be able to

2
00:00:02.897 --> 00:00:06.165
filter the cards based on what's
actually being selected here.

3
00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:07.919
And to be able to do that,

4
00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.108
that means we need to know what
these tags are on all of them.

5
00:00:12.108 --> 00:00:14.998
When we created those cards,
we come down a little bit.

6
00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:18.890
Each card has our tag list and
the tag list we have these data edible or

7
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.294
the data season that's coming on there.

8
00:00:21.294 --> 00:00:24.066
And this is where I said if you did true
and false, it would have to be a little

9
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.266
bit different, cuz we're just
going to look for a match for

10
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.078
what's coming through
on the current seasons.

11
00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:33.073
To be able to get that for each one of my
cards, when we did the const of cards at

12
00:00:33.073 --> 00:00:37.701
the top, it was a query selector all so
it's getting all of the cards.

13
00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:42.459
So to be able to filter the cards, what
we're going to do Is we can come here and

14
00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:45.391
create a new function,
called filter cards and

15
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:49.955
in our filter cards here we wanna go
through every single one of the cards.

16
00:00:49.955 --> 00:00:54.552
So i do cards dot for
each and when we do the for

17
00:00:54.552 --> 00:00:57.794
each it's we have to bring it.

18
00:00:57.794 --> 00:01:02.282
Inside of there, I'm gonna put parentheses
again, and just writing card and

19
00:01:02.282 --> 00:01:06.634
then say is equal to, or not equal to,
but we're gonna do the the fat arrow,

20
00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:11.270
we're doing a function there, so for
each card we're gonna do something to it.

21
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.050
So if I just did a console log card,
and we looked at our console,

22
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.771
it should give us, list,
we're not doing it.

23
00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:24.948
Let's just come here, filter cards,

24
00:01:24.948 --> 00:01:28.717
we just get a list of all
of our cards coming in.

25
00:01:28.717 --> 00:01:31.740
So obviously, we don't want
just a list of all the cards,

26
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.780
we wanna get all of the different
pieces that are in there.

27
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.618
So for each one of those cards,
I wanna go into that card, and

28
00:01:38.618 --> 00:01:40.209
I wanna find the season.

29
00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:48.994
So the season is going to be
the card.querySelector and data season.

30
00:01:51.645 --> 00:01:55.773
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Which is this, we need to
do the attribute selector here, so we had

31
00:01:55.773 --> 00:02:00.886
our data-season so it's gonna go and find
the list item that has the season on it.

32
00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:07.840
And then from there we can get
the data set, data set of the.season.

33
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.334
Whoops, not what I wanted, dataset.season.

34
00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:14.703
And I'll make this a bit bigger so
we can see it a bit clearer.

35
00:02:17.338 --> 00:02:20.419
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: I'll just
full screen it for a second.

36
00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.186
So we're gonna go in and look at the card,

37
00:02:23.186 --> 00:02:27.471
find the element that has a data season,
and then get from that.

38
00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:30.799
The other thing you could do here
is also like get attribute and

39
00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.531
get the value of the attribute.

40
00:02:32.531 --> 00:02:36.011
But if it's a data, you can just use
a data set if you have a data attribute.

41
00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:38.326
So we're getting the value
of our season from there.

42
00:02:38.326 --> 00:02:42.779
It's a bit repetitive in the way that
it looks, but it gets the job done.

43
00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:46.644
And then we can do the same thing for

44
00:02:46.644 --> 00:02:51.710
our edible is data-edible,
and the data set

45
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.462
we're getting the value
of the edible from there.

46
00:02:57.462 --> 00:03:02.205
So now, if we console blog,

47
00:03:02.205 --> 00:03:06.758
our season and our edible.

48
00:03:06.758 --> 00:03:11.284
We can go and take a look, and you can see
right now they're all we follow toxic fall

49
00:03:11.284 --> 00:03:13.062
edible, toxic summer edible.

50
00:03:13.062 --> 00:03:16.594
We're getting all of that information
from each one of the cards.

51
00:03:16.594 --> 00:03:22.709
So that information is being stored now,
we know what the values of those are.

52
00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.945
So now,
we can actually filter against those.

53
00:03:24.945 --> 00:03:28.500
So to be able to filter through them,
the main ideas that we wanna be able

54
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.315
to hide the ones that don't match and
show the ones that do match our filter.

55
00:03:32.315 --> 00:03:39.543
So to be able to do that,
the easiest thing to do is basically,

56
00:03:39.543 --> 00:03:44.692
we can say const matches
season is equal to.

57
00:03:44.692 --> 00:03:49.209
And we wannna check to see if
the season that we've got here matches

58
00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.902
the season that we have up here
that's been selected in our filters.

59
00:03:53.902 --> 00:03:58.842
So to be able to do that,
we can just say current

60
00:03:58.842 --> 00:04:04.188
filters.season is equal
to the current season.

61
00:04:04.188 --> 00:04:09.208
And const matches, edible is equal

62
00:04:09.208 --> 00:04:16.578
to current filters.edible
is equal to the edible.

63
00:04:16.578 --> 00:04:21.828
So if the value coming from our
current filters is matching the value

64
00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:26.431
that we pulled here,
they're the same, then it matches,

65
00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:30.871
and that's true, and if not,
one of those can be false.

66
00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:35.785
So the next thing we wanna do is show and
hide them, so

67
00:04:35.785 --> 00:04:39.472
we can say if the matches editable, and

68
00:04:39.472 --> 00:04:44.422
matches season,
cuz we need both of those to match.

69
00:04:44.422 --> 00:04:46.764
If one of the filters doesn't match,
we wanna hide it.

70
00:04:46.764 --> 00:04:50.940
So if both of those are actually matching,

71
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.049
we can come in with
a card.hidden is equal to false.

72
00:04:56.049 --> 00:04:59.556
And again, there's a more like you
could do this without the if else,

73
00:04:59.556 --> 00:05:01.708
I just find it's
the clearest way to do it.

74
00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:06.448
So I always do this for simple if else

75
00:05:06.448 --> 00:05:11.508
statements, card.hidden=true.

76
00:05:11.508 --> 00:05:13.834
And this should feel like it should work,
we're almost there,

77
00:05:13.834 --> 00:05:15.179
it's basically working actually.

78
00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:17.652
The functionality of this
should work except here.

79
00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:21.899
Well, yeah, the filter cards,
we don't wanna be doing that there.

80
00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:25.172
We wanna be doing that when
we update our filters, but

81
00:05:25.172 --> 00:05:29.416
we'll check this just really fast
to see if it's actually working.

82
00:05:29.416 --> 00:05:32.991
But the problem that's going to
happen with this right now is

83
00:05:32.991 --> 00:05:37.420
if we're putting the hidden on anything,
it's not actually gonna hide.

84
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.087
And this is a really annoying
thing in my opinion with CSS.

85
00:05:41.087 --> 00:05:45.636
Cuz if I come in and we'll do it manually,
just really fast here,

86
00:05:45.636 --> 00:05:50.022
let's go grab this first card,
which is the chanterelle, and

87
00:05:50.022 --> 00:05:53.033
let's throw a hidden attribute on there.

88
00:05:53.033 --> 00:05:57.075
It's not hidden, it's not gone,
even though, if we come and

89
00:05:57.075 --> 00:05:59.668
take a look here and inspect on that, and

90
00:05:59.668 --> 00:06:03.511
I find that card which is there
it has the hidden attribute.

91
00:06:03.511 --> 00:06:06.561
And if you look at the hidden attribute,

92
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:12.046
if we go down far enough in here we
should find, maybe I'm gonna miss it.

93
00:06:12.046 --> 00:06:15.721
I could filter by, I don't know if
the filter would work for selectors,

94
00:06:15.721 --> 00:06:17.054
I don't use it too often.

95
00:06:17.054 --> 00:06:19.935
The hidden should come with
a display non on it, but

96
00:06:19.935 --> 00:06:23.895
the display non is not gonna work,
because it has not specifity on it.

97
00:06:23.895 --> 00:06:27.067
Basically, and
because our card has a display greater or

98
00:06:27.067 --> 00:06:29.385
display flex, it's overwriting on it.

99
00:06:29.385 --> 00:06:33.329
So generally, in most projects I work on,

100
00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:37.824
in utilities and
attribute selector of hidden,

101
00:06:37.824 --> 00:06:42.644
just a display of none,
and now that first one,

102
00:06:42.644 --> 00:06:47.371
they've all disappeared,
cuz the way I set it up.

103
00:06:47.371 --> 00:06:49.847
So all of them have the hidden
attribute on there right now, and

104
00:06:49.847 --> 00:06:50.840
they've all vanished.

105
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.364
And that's actually, I think, or it's not
gonna update now with these, but, yeah,

106
00:06:55.364 --> 00:06:57.272
it didn't match the filters we had.

107
00:06:57.272 --> 00:07:00.247
So they all got the hidden on there,
and they've all disappeared.

108
00:07:00.247 --> 00:07:04.162
This is a really handy reason for
layers in my opinion because this isn't

109
00:07:04.162 --> 00:07:08.545
the highest specificity selector,
it's not bad It's an attribute selector.

110
00:07:08.545 --> 00:07:12.388
But because it's coming here within the
utilities, my utilities is at the bottom,

111
00:07:12.388 --> 00:07:14.510
I know anything that
gets the hidden on there.

112
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.212
We'll get a display none, and

113
00:07:16.212 --> 00:07:20.418
that's just a really convenient way to
be able to hide things along the way.

114
00:07:20.418 --> 00:07:23.752
Show and hide instead of toggling
a different class or doing something else,

115
00:07:23.752 --> 00:07:24.788
just toggling hidden.

116
00:07:24.788 --> 00:07:27.223
It's so easy to do because,
again, in the JavaScript,

117
00:07:27.223 --> 00:07:30.441
you can just say hidden is true or
false, it adds or removes the attribute.

118
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:33.384
You could also toggle the attribute,
there's other ways of doing it, but

119
00:07:33.384 --> 00:07:34.514
this is a nice, simple way.

120
00:07:34.514 --> 00:07:36.723
The problem,
there's two problems right now, though.

121
00:07:36.723 --> 00:07:40.969
One of them is, if we have it as all,
it never matches, so

122
00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:43.277
none of the filters match all.

123
00:07:43.277 --> 00:07:46.749
So that's why right now it's false, all
the cards are getting false on there, and

124
00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:47.900
I'm just running it here.

125
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.744
We don't wanna filter our cards now,

126
00:07:49.744 --> 00:07:52.755
we only wanna filter the cards
when we actually make a change.

127
00:07:52.755 --> 00:07:56.425
So let's fix this by getting the filter
to work at their appropriate time.

128
00:07:56.425 --> 00:08:00.512
So we'll take that out from here and
here when we're updating the filters after

129
00:08:00.512 --> 00:08:04.544
the filters have been updated, we don't
need to keep this console log there.

130
00:08:04.544 --> 00:08:06.981
We want to filter the cards.

131
00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:09.427
So now you can actually
see the cards are back in.

132
00:08:09.427 --> 00:08:11.874
If I say spring,
they're probably all gonna disappear.

133
00:08:11.874 --> 00:08:16.139
But if I say spring and toxic,
we actually get two showing up,

134
00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:19.184
because those two match these parameters.

135
00:08:19.184 --> 00:08:23.682
Or if I go to summer, that's there,
edible, so it's almost working.

136
00:08:23.682 --> 00:08:28.579
The problem right now is if I choose all,
anytime, all is selected,

137
00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:32.379
it fails, because fail the down here,
the matches,

138
00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:36.874
edible matches season only ever
works if it's exact matches.

139
00:08:36.874 --> 00:08:39.399
And not if we have the all
that's being selected.

140
00:08:39.399 --> 00:08:46.395
So, you can either do this up here or
do this within the if and else down here.

141
00:08:46.395 --> 00:08:49.661
So if it's matches edible and
matches season.

142
00:08:49.661 --> 00:08:53.483
And so the easiest way to do it now is
here we're looking for the matches edible.

143
00:08:53.483 --> 00:08:57.429
We could say if it's matches edible or

144
00:08:57.429 --> 00:09:01.755
with the two pipes there or if our filter.

145
00:09:01.755 --> 00:09:08.551
So currentFilters.edible

146
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:12.517
is equal to all.

147
00:09:12.517 --> 00:09:17.106
So if we just do that, it should work, we
can already see we have some stuff there.

148
00:09:17.106 --> 00:09:21.530
So if we're doing the edible one
right now, so we have that on all,

149
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:26.428
I should be able to filter by the summer,
even though we have the all here so

150
00:09:26.428 --> 00:09:29.750
it hasn't completely
broken like it was before.

151
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.036
And then we could do the same thing.

152
00:09:31.036 --> 00:09:33.921
I'm just gonna put this on another line so
we can see it all, or

153
00:09:33.921 --> 00:09:35.099
I'll just scroll over.

154
00:09:35.099 --> 00:09:40.666
So then the same thing here matchesSeason,
or

155
00:09:40.666 --> 00:09:46.531
if the currentFilters.season
is equal to all.

156
00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:50.124
And there we go, prettier,
broke it over multiple lines for me, so

157
00:09:50.124 --> 00:09:52.089
it's a little bit easier to look at.

158
00:09:52.089 --> 00:09:55.533
So we're seeing if it matches
the current filter we have or

159
00:09:55.533 --> 00:09:57.235
if the keyword all is there.

160
00:09:57.235 --> 00:10:01.598
So spring, we get the spring, if I, well,
the spring is not the best one cuz they're

161
00:10:01.598 --> 00:10:03.977
all, but there we go,
we get these coming in.

162
00:10:03.977 --> 00:10:08.167
We can change that to only toxic,
only edible, or we can get all of them.

163
00:10:08.167 --> 00:10:10.732
Or if I put this to toxic,
I can then go to all here, and

164
00:10:10.732 --> 00:10:12.396
we get all of them coming through.
