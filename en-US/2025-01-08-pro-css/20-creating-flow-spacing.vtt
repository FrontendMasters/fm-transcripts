00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.930
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Now, one thing
you might have noticed in our site

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.991
is all of our spacing disappeared, cuz
we did a margin zero really early on for

3
00:00:04.991 --> 00:00:07.227
our paragraphs or headings and
other things like that.

4
00:00:07.227 --> 00:00:10.347
And it looks kinda weird that
everything's glued together.

5
00:00:10.347 --> 00:00:14.935
And when we have spacing between type and
things like that,

6
00:00:14.935 --> 00:00:17.337
it's generally called flow.

7
00:00:17.337 --> 00:00:20.806
You have the CSS flow,
page flow includes that space normally.

8
00:00:20.806 --> 00:00:22.923
So we need to reintroduce the flow, and

9
00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:25.373
there's different ways
that we can do this.

10
00:00:25.373 --> 00:00:27.910
If you're used to Tailwind,
you know the prose class.

11
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.143
The prose class,
I have an example of it here, I don't,

12
00:00:31.143 --> 00:00:33.273
but I do mention it and
I have a link to it.

13
00:00:33.273 --> 00:00:36.564
The prose class brings margin-top and
bottom back,

14
00:00:36.564 --> 00:00:40.230
cuz their reset takes the margins away,
like we've done.

15
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.804
And their prose class takes anything
that's a descendant of that and

16
00:00:43.804 --> 00:00:47.700
adds the margin-top and bottom back in
with some tweaks to what those are.

17
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.231
There's another thing,
which is the lobotomized owl,

18
00:00:50.231 --> 00:00:52.615
which is by Heydon Pickering,
who coined that term.

19
00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:56.203
And I have a link to the article
from way back when he coined it,

20
00:00:56.203 --> 00:00:58.003
which is the * + * selector.

21
00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:01.702
You can see here,
it's actually on my shirt right now,

22
00:01:01.702 --> 00:01:07.147
that we have the * + * selector that's
right there, where it looks a bit weird.

23
00:01:07.147 --> 00:01:11.020
There's other ways that we can write that,
but basically, it reintroduces.

24
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.099
By doing it like this, we can
reintroduce flow back into our document.

25
00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:20.518
And if we go and take a look, I'm not
gonna use it properly at the beginning.

26
00:01:20.518 --> 00:01:25.724
But I'm just gonna come here and
do .flow &gt; * + *,

27
00:01:25.724 --> 00:01:30.029
and I'll show you the alternatives, too.

28
00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:33.271
I would suggest potentially leaving
a comment here cuz people do complain that

29
00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:34.361
it's not very readable.

30
00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:38.933
If they come across, it's not obvious
what it's doing, and I'm gonna say for

31
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.102
now, color is red.

32
00:01:40.102 --> 00:01:42.924
Just so
we can see what this is actually doing.

33
00:01:42.924 --> 00:01:45.773
And I'm gonna go,
where should we put this?

34
00:01:45.773 --> 00:01:49.787
I'll put it in the heading, the hero.

35
00:01:49.787 --> 00:01:53.579
So if we come all the way up to
the top and we find my hero,

36
00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.205
we'll do it on this wrapper just
cuz I have three paragraphs here.

37
00:01:58.205 --> 00:02:01.983
So in this wrapper,
if I add a flow, this paragraph and

38
00:02:01.983 --> 00:02:07.007
the next one after it are getting a red
color on it, the first one isn't.

39
00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:13.501
So what the * + * is,
it's using the direct sibling selector.

40
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:16.741
Or it's a preceding sibling selector, so

41
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:21.515
it's only selecting an element
if it has an element before it.

42
00:02:21.515 --> 00:02:25.807
So this paragraph, does it have an element
before it that's a direct sibling?

43
00:02:25.807 --> 00:02:27.060
Yes, it does.

44
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.759
Does this one?

45
00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:28.699
Yes, it does.

46
00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:29.525
Does this one?

47
00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:32.827
No, it doesn't, cuz if we look
in the HTML, it's at the top.

48
00:02:32.827 --> 00:02:36.956
It doesn't have a sibling that comes
before it, so it doesn't get selected.

49
00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:41.436
The alternative to writing
it this way is saying

50
00:02:41.436 --> 00:02:47.044
not(:first-child), and
you'd get the same result.

51
00:02:47.044 --> 00:02:51.063
If I hit save, it's selecting all
of them other than the first child.

52
00:02:51.063 --> 00:02:55.333
The only problem with doing it with the
not(:first-child) is this does bring in

53
00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:59.116
extra specificity with it, which
the star selector has no specificity.

54
00:02:59.116 --> 00:03:02.274
So here, we now have two class selectors.

55
00:03:02.274 --> 00:03:04.925
If you wanna get rid of the specificity,
we do have where now.

56
00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:08.577
So you could come in and say,
where:not(:first-child), and

57
00:03:08.577 --> 00:03:11.214
then you've eliminated
the specificity of it.

58
00:03:11.214 --> 00:03:15.291
And it's only a class selector again, but
it just feels really heavy-handed in my

59
00:03:15.291 --> 00:03:19.095
opinion, and it's really not that much
more readable than just doing this.

60
00:03:19.095 --> 00:03:23.145
I had a comment saying, selects
everything except the first direct child.

61
00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:27.696
I think is good enough for most people.

62
00:03:27.696 --> 00:03:32.168
Obviously, though,
instead of doing the color,

63
00:03:32.168 --> 00:03:36.334
what we can do here is do
it a margin-top of var.

64
00:03:36.334 --> 00:03:40.545
I'm goinna do it as a var(--flow-spacer),

65
00:03:40.545 --> 00:03:45.670
something like that, and
then just have a 1em as a default.

66
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.652
And I'm choosing 1em as a default
on purpose rather than 1rem,

67
00:03:51.652 --> 00:03:56.111
because for the flow of text,
here's this quick

68
00:03:56.111 --> 00:04:01.243
example I put together so
we don't have to build it out.

69
00:04:01.243 --> 00:04:06.508
This side here, they're both using
the * + * for these two columns.

70
00:04:06.508 --> 00:04:10.547
The one on the left is using
the one on the right is using rem.

71
00:04:10.547 --> 00:04:14.509
So the one on the left with the you'll
notice that the space here is bigger,

72
00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:17.310
because the is based on
the font size of that element.

73
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.391
So it's creating more space right here,
and

74
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:22.470
then it's creating more space here
cuz this is bigger than those.

75
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.155
And it creates just a better
visual hierarchy for

76
00:04:25.155 --> 00:04:27.391
the way typography is supposed to work.

77
00:04:27.391 --> 00:04:32.374
Anybody who knows about topography,
it's all about the hierarchy, and

78
00:04:32.374 --> 00:04:35.761
proximity to things is
the word I'm looking for.

79
00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:39.582
And so we're trying to keep the proximity
of what this is related to closer to here,

80
00:04:39.582 --> 00:04:42.053
and it just creates a more
visually appealing thing.

81
00:04:42.053 --> 00:04:44.077
It's easier to skim and everything else.

82
00:04:44.077 --> 00:04:48.808
Then when you have 1rem and
all the spacing ends up being the same.

83
00:04:48.808 --> 00:04:52.043
This is for regular flow text, there
are times you want consistent spacing,

84
00:04:52.043 --> 00:04:53.400
we'll look at that in a second.

85
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.988
But when you want regular flow,
it doesn't make sense,

86
00:04:56.988 --> 00:04:59.319
it just makes a lot of sense to use.

87
00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:03.274
And it's the reason we're using
margin-top instead of margin-bottom,

88
00:05:03.274 --> 00:05:06.624
cuz some people prefer doing
the same thing on margin-bottom.

89
00:05:06.624 --> 00:05:07.978
But I want a bigger margin
on top of the large text.

90
00:05:07.978 --> 00:05:12.776
So if I hook into the fact that the large
text 1em is bigger than 1m on my smaller

91
00:05:12.776 --> 00:05:16.210
text, using margin-top is
the easiest way to do that.

92
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.304
So flow, just like that,
gives us that type of thing.

93
00:05:20.304 --> 00:05:24.593
So that means we can come into our
project now that we've added that there,

94
00:05:24.593 --> 00:05:26.921
and we can add the flow wherever we want.

95
00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:30.361
Now, I did say I like having
wrappers just be wrappers.

96
00:05:30.361 --> 00:05:33.408
So this is another divisive thing,
well, it's not divisive, but

97
00:05:33.408 --> 00:05:34.962
it depends on how you like to work.

98
00:05:34.962 --> 00:05:39.932
But you might want to have
another div with a class of

99
00:05:39.932 --> 00:05:43.064
flow cuz you'll need it there.

100
00:05:43.064 --> 00:05:47.030
Cut that, paste it down here, and
have the wrapper and then the flow, or

101
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.253
you might just wanna put them together.

102
00:05:49.253 --> 00:05:52.911
I've done it both ways, it just depends,
you want another div or

103
00:05:52.911 --> 00:05:55.982
do you mind mixing the wrapper
plus the flow together?

104
00:05:55.982 --> 00:05:57.533
It's completely up to you.

105
00:05:57.533 --> 00:05:59.836
I am gonna add it to my hero too,
though, cuz right now,

106
00:05:59.836 --> 00:06:02.633
the mushroom foraging is touching
the text that's underneath it.

107
00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:04.213
So I can add a flow here.

108
00:06:04.213 --> 00:06:06.727
Whoops, I don't wanna remove those.

109
00:06:06.727 --> 00:06:12.935
I'm gonna add the flow right there just
to give us the space we need right there.

110
00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:14.620
The advantage of the flow being here too,

111
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.411
this font size actually
needs to be bigger.

112
00:06:16.411 --> 00:06:20.046
Potentially, we put the class there,
we have the utility for that now,

113
00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.080
but we can come down to the next section.

114
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.466
And it's a little bit annoying, and this
is one of the reasons when you do a reset,

115
00:06:25.466 --> 00:06:27.480
maybe you don't wanna
remove all your margins,

116
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.250
cuz then you do have to find a way
to bring spacing back into things.

117
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.027
So it is an argument for
not just nuking margins right off the top.

118
00:06:34.027 --> 00:06:37.046
So here we have the wrapper,
so I can do another flow.

119
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.292
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: And
I want to close it right there, so

120
00:06:42.292 --> 00:06:46.279
that adds the spacing between those,
I think.

121
00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:48.114
The cards, I'll talk about in a second.

122
00:06:48.114 --> 00:06:52.981
We'll come back to those in a minute,
but I'll leave those alone, and

123
00:06:52.981 --> 00:06:54.451
we'll circle back.

124
00:06:54.451 --> 00:06:58.486
The next section down here, these two,

125
00:06:58.486 --> 00:07:02.646
we need some flow, so I can add my .flow.

126
00:07:02.646 --> 00:07:06.330
While I'm on this one, though,
one thing I didn't do earlier, so

127
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.798
we did create those
utility classes before.

128
00:07:08.798 --> 00:07:13.958
So I am gonna say this is also a text,
no, sorry, font-size.

129
00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.436
I talked about them and
we didn't do a lot with them.

130
00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:20.808
font-size, I think it would be the md or
even lg, I think,

131
00:07:20.808 --> 00:07:24.839
which gives us that larger
font size that we had there.

132
00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:29.319
And we want the text to be white,
so I could do text-high-contrast.

133
00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:33.065
And this is where I have three utility
classes, basically on one element.

134
00:07:33.065 --> 00:07:36.092
And I might say, do I really want
three utility classes there or

135
00:07:36.092 --> 00:07:37.355
should it be a component?

136
00:07:37.355 --> 00:07:40.611
Cuz we also wanna come
on the very top here and

137
00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:43.348
probably do a text-center as well.

138
00:07:43.348 --> 00:07:47.744
And then everything centers cuz
that area is always centered.

139
00:07:47.744 --> 00:07:49.129
But this is where you will start seeing,

140
00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:51.207
when you have these different
utilities that are in there and

141
00:07:51.207 --> 00:07:53.630
you're going through your site,
how quickly you can start working.

142
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:58.892
Or these more generic selectors,
let's say, instead of utilities.

143
00:07:58.892 --> 00:08:03.616
So then we can come down to this
next section that's two columns.

144
00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:07.123
In this case,
I don't want it just by my wrapper,

145
00:08:07.123 --> 00:08:09.550
cuz my wrapper then has the image.

146
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:14.523
And after that, it has this div that's
sitting here, creating the other column,

147
00:08:14.523 --> 00:08:16.522
so that one can get the flow on it.

148
00:08:16.522 --> 00:08:22.504
And I could also do my font-size,
I keep saying text,

149
00:08:22.504 --> 00:08:26.545
font-size-lg on that one as well.

150
00:08:26.545 --> 00:08:31.089
We could come down to this next section,
wrapper equal-columns.

151
00:08:31.089 --> 00:08:32.995
I have this div that has the text in it.

152
00:08:32.995 --> 00:08:37.834
So basically, anytime I have text,
I need a flow class around it.

153
00:08:37.834 --> 00:08:41.645
And then if I do need to change
the font size, I can come in and

154
00:08:41.645 --> 00:08:44.628
do that at the same time, so font-size-lg.

155
00:08:44.628 --> 00:08:47.307
I think those are supposed
to be lg anyway.

156
00:08:47.307 --> 00:08:49.656
There we go, and
those ones come through like that.

157
00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:53.880
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: I might have
missed one along the way.

158
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.700
So it's one of those things that as
you're going through the project,

159
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.053
you might be like, I forgot a flow here,
you just add it in wherever you need it.

160
00:09:00.053 --> 00:09:03.255
So just making sure, and you just go
through and visually check your site after

161
00:09:03.255 --> 00:09:06.765
to see if there's things that are stuck
together that shouldn't be stuck together.

162
00:09:06.765 --> 00:09:10.903
I'm doing a quick check now, and the one
area that I see where I have a problem is

163
00:09:10.903 --> 00:09:13.878
inside my cards,
where everything is glued together.

164
00:09:13.878 --> 00:09:15.532
We'll get to that in the next little bit,

165
00:09:15.532 --> 00:09:18.801
just cuz those spacing we actually want
it to be consistent instead of different.

166
00:09:18.801 --> 00:09:24.164
So for those cards,
what we wanna do is we have two choices.

167
00:09:24.164 --> 00:09:25.536
You could use the flow and

168
00:09:25.536 --> 00:09:29.791
then you could change what the
--flow-spacer is to make it 1rem instead.

169
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:33.078
I personally have the habit
of doing a grid-flow,

170
00:09:33.078 --> 00:09:37.906
cuz it just distinguishes the two
between each other for me, grid-flow.

171
00:09:37.906 --> 00:09:41.181
And the reason I use grid for this, you
could also use Flexbox, but with Flexbox,

172
00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:42.766
you have to change the flex direction.

173
00:09:42.766 --> 00:09:44.161
With grid, you don't.

174
00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:48.889
And I do a display: grid and

175
00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:55.476
a gap: var(--grid-flow-gap.

176
00:09:55.476 --> 00:09:58.202
You get where this is going,
but 1rem instead of 1em.

177
00:09:58.202 --> 00:10:01.773
Even though in this situation
because it's a gap, the 1em,

178
00:10:01.773 --> 00:10:04.600
it wouldn't change
anything in any situation.

179
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.196
And this is the name, grid-flow, for me,
is because I know grid is going to be

180
00:10:09.196 --> 00:10:14.226
consistent spacing, cuz I know I'm gonna
be relying on gap instead of using margin.

181
00:10:14.226 --> 00:10:17.117
If you'd want consistent flow or,
I don't know,

182
00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:21.286
a name that would imply that the spacing
is always the same instead of being

183
00:10:21.286 --> 00:10:24.125
more general flow,
you can go with another name.

184
00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:28.467
For that, that would sort of hammer
home that idea a little bit better.

185
00:10:28.467 --> 00:10:31.778
But then on these cards that
we have here right now,

186
00:10:31.778 --> 00:10:37.025
we will change it a little bit after, but
I just wanna show how this can be useful.

187
00:10:37.025 --> 00:10:38.562
So I think I actually called those cards.

188
00:10:38.562 --> 00:10:44.599
So for now, we can also give each
one of those cards the grid-flow.

189
00:10:44.599 --> 00:10:47.909
And we could have done this a bit faster,
but

190
00:10:47.909 --> 00:10:52.219
we'll do it the slow way by
scrolling to each one of them.

191
00:10:52.219 --> 00:10:55.849
You can see this change it already made,
but if I make that bigger now and I go and

192
00:10:55.849 --> 00:10:57.114
take a look at those cards,

193
00:10:57.114 --> 00:10:59.880
we can see we get a bit of spacing
coming between them there.

194
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.920
And I just realized I
don't have any space here.

195
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.753
So I'm gonna fix that really fast while

196
00:11:07.753 --> 00:11:12.739
we're at it, which would be that flow.

197
00:11:12.739 --> 00:11:15.402
I'm gonna do it on here for now.

198
00:11:15.402 --> 00:11:17.602
No, we shouldn't need that, the wrapper.

199
00:11:17.602 --> 00:11:20.385
No, one second.

200
00:11:20.385 --> 00:11:25.755
We have the flow is adding flow to here.

201
00:11:25.755 --> 00:11:31.572
For this case,
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: I want an extra space,

202
00:11:31.572 --> 00:11:33.845
we'll figure that one out.

203
00:11:35.408 --> 00:11:39.864
&gt;&gt; Kevin Powell: Yeah, if we added
flow here, it would actually work.

204
00:11:39.864 --> 00:11:41.334
You can see it's adding the space there.

205
00:11:41.334 --> 00:11:45.674
Maybe I'll make that exception there just
so we don't have to get some extra divs,

206
00:11:45.674 --> 00:11:48.226
layers, a wrapper flow
could be a bit annoying.

207
00:11:48.226 --> 00:11:52.832
The reason that one's working is
because if we look directly in there,

208
00:11:52.832 --> 00:11:58.001
it's adding the space between this and
then those three columns we have there.

209
00:11:58.001 --> 00:12:02.404
So by having that extra flow and
then the nested flow.

210
00:12:02.404 --> 00:12:05.950
It might be an argument in this case,
actually,

211
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.460
of not having this one here at all.

212
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.907
We could do it that way to
simplify things a little bit and

213
00:12:10.907 --> 00:12:12.740
then just combining those two together.

214
00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.778
Maybe in this case,
we'll cheat a little bit and

215
00:12:15.778 --> 00:12:20.297
allow them to be combined just so
we don't have extra divs for nothing and

216
00:12:20.297 --> 00:12:23.208
having to redo the extra classes for
nothing.
