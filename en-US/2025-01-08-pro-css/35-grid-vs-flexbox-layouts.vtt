00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.536
One thing we noticed when styling
up our cards was there was this

2
00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:06.874
weird thing where the tags were
sometimes the wrong size and

3
00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:10.094
debugging these types of things
can be a little bit hard.

4
00:00:10.094 --> 00:00:13.136
If you ever look at the cards
at the smaller screens too,

5
00:00:13.136 --> 00:00:14.832
we won't see that happening.

6
00:00:14.832 --> 00:00:18.432
So if you run into something where layouts
are sort of behaving in an unexpected way,

7
00:00:18.432 --> 00:00:20.117
dev tools are definitely your friend.

8
00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:21.320
It's what you want to use.

9
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.433
And we can see that here,

10
00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:25.631
like all the little tags they look
fine when we're at the smaller size.

11
00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:28.583
But as we get to this larger size and
there's two columns,

12
00:00:28.583 --> 00:00:30.934
all of a sudden things
are a little bit weird and

13
00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:34.670
different where we have this bigger
space coming there and you can see it,

14
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.341
especially I think on this one,
the edible as well.

15
00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:39.597
And then if we get to three columns,

16
00:00:39.597 --> 00:00:43.372
we might even see it more on
some of them compared to others.

17
00:00:43.372 --> 00:00:46.454
And it can be really hard to understand
what's actually going on when these types

18
00:00:46.454 --> 00:00:47.464
of things are happening.

19
00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:51.226
But if you're using Grid or Flex,
which you're probably using, and

20
00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:54.544
you probably won't run into
these situations without them,

21
00:00:54.544 --> 00:00:58.072
I would use the grid inspectors
that come built into the browser.

22
00:00:58.072 --> 00:01:01.043
Because it just helps you visualize
what's actually happening With

23
00:01:01.043 --> 00:01:01.970
the grid or Flexbox.

24
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.814
You have the Flexbox inspectors.

25
00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:08.049
So if I come on this one, if you just
hover over with the little selector here,

26
00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.078
you can see what the grid looks like.

27
00:01:10.078 --> 00:01:13.828
But you also get these
little pills that show up.

28
00:01:13.828 --> 00:01:16.580
And if you click on the pill,
it's going to highlight it there for you.

29
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.802
And we can highlight that one, and
we'll do the third one too, just so

30
00:01:19.802 --> 00:01:21.284
we compare the three together.

31
00:01:21.284 --> 00:01:24.432
And you'll notice that the grids
are actually different from one card to

32
00:01:24.432 --> 00:01:25.056
the next one.

33
00:01:25.056 --> 00:01:28.688
The spacing here for Morel is like
there's empty space under it,

34
00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:32.982
where the top one's a lot tighter, and
then this one is actually bigger, and

35
00:01:32.982 --> 00:01:36.175
that's what's causing these
little pills to stretch.

36
00:01:36.175 --> 00:01:39.410
And yeah, so we get these differences
that are coming between each one of them.

37
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.811
And then immediately that means that it's
our grid that's causing an issue for

38
00:01:43.811 --> 00:01:47.634
this type of thing There's a few
different solutions you could use.

39
00:01:47.634 --> 00:01:51.414
There's ways of trying to wrangle grid and
trying to get it to work the way you want,

40
00:01:51.414 --> 00:01:53.844
but they do have to be kinda specific,
because grid,

41
00:01:53.844 --> 00:01:56.077
there's two things actually
that are going on.

42
00:01:56.077 --> 00:01:58.150
One of them is the parent is also a grid.

43
00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.564
So because the parent is a grid.

44
00:01:59.564 --> 00:02:03.197
All the items are stretching to
fill up the space that's there.

45
00:02:03.197 --> 00:02:05.913
And because this one has more
content than the one next to it,

46
00:02:05.913 --> 00:02:09.285
because we have three lines of text here,
so it's just taller in general.

47
00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:11.529
This one is stretching to fill that, and

48
00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:15.621
then because that one's stretching
the column or the rows that the grid is

49
00:02:15.621 --> 00:02:19.132
creating has extra space that
those things can live inside of.

50
00:02:19.132 --> 00:02:21.105
And so when these types of things happen,
it's just like,

51
00:02:21.105 --> 00:02:22.257
what's the best solution for it?

52
00:02:22.257 --> 00:02:25.686
Again, you could do some finagling
with grid to get it to work and

53
00:02:25.686 --> 00:02:30.197
just shrink those sizings down, but you
have to be quite specific, because you're

54
00:02:30.197 --> 00:02:34.285
setting you'd have to like, say which
one of the rows is bigger or smaller.

55
00:02:34.285 --> 00:02:37.597
You can use intrinsic sizes like auto or
min content and other things to do it, but

56
00:02:37.597 --> 00:02:38.634
you're still doing it.

57
00:02:38.634 --> 00:02:39.422
Row by row and

58
00:02:39.422 --> 00:02:43.594
on something like a card that you
just want it to go anywhere you want.

59
00:02:43.594 --> 00:02:45.621
It's probably not the best solution.

60
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:49.935
And what I would say is, if you run
into something like this, don't feel

61
00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:54.604
like you have to go with the original
thought or the initial thing that you did,

62
00:02:54.604 --> 00:02:59.376
be very open to potentially refactoring,
just changing the approach you did.

63
00:02:59.376 --> 00:03:01.714
As long as that thing
works across the board,

64
00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:04.308
it doesn't cause any other
issues along the way.

65
00:03:04.308 --> 00:03:08.764
That's what we're gonna do in this case,
because with what we want to do in

66
00:03:08.764 --> 00:03:13.504
this layout is we just want, instead of
the element, the grid creating rows and

67
00:03:13.504 --> 00:03:17.279
then the content filling those rows,
which is how Grid works.

68
00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:20.887
It's why I love Grid because you
control through the parent the children

69
00:03:20.887 --> 00:03:21.546
fit into it.

70
00:03:21.546 --> 00:03:26.051
But Flexbox is the one we saw it with the
navigation where the elements just take up

71
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:27.783
the space they need to take up.

72
00:03:27.783 --> 00:03:32.781
So in this case, you might go,
well, if grid isn't doing the job,

73
00:03:32.781 --> 00:03:37.957
maybe on these cards, I actually want
to switch it to a display flex and

74
00:03:37.957 --> 00:03:40.274
do a flex direction of column.

75
00:03:40.274 --> 00:03:43.173
If I hit Save, we'll see that
it actually fixes the problem.

76
00:03:43.173 --> 00:03:46.862
This is happening because Flexbox,
again, on the main access,

77
00:03:46.862 --> 00:03:49.556
items are just gonna be as
big as they need to be.

78
00:03:49.556 --> 00:03:50.751
They're not filling up any space.

79
00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:53.777
Each thing, if it's bigger,
it's bigger, if it's smaller,

80
00:03:53.777 --> 00:03:55.771
it's smaller, and it does its own thing.

81
00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:58.722
The children are what are in
control of the layout.

82
00:03:58.722 --> 00:04:02.144
The reason I went with grid initially
is because I needed even spacing in my

83
00:04:02.144 --> 00:04:05.179
columns, and I didn't want to
have to change my Flex direction,

84
00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:07.624
because it was an extra
declaration I didn't need.

85
00:04:07.624 --> 00:04:11.040
But when you're doing display flex and
switching the direction or

86
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.371
doing a display grid and just using gap,
they're very similar in how they work, but

87
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:17.937
there are a few different
things that can happen.

88
00:04:17.937 --> 00:04:22.457
So if one of them isn't working,
try doing the other one, see what happens.

89
00:04:22.457 --> 00:04:25.122
And if it's still something you're
fighting with, well then you sort of get

90
00:04:25.122 --> 00:04:27.254
into the weeds and you start
playing with it a little bit more.

91
00:04:27.254 --> 00:04:30.474
But sometimes a really quick
thing like this can be a big win.

92
00:04:30.474 --> 00:04:34.646
And trust me, I've wasted so much time
on these types of problems trying, like,

93
00:04:34.646 --> 00:04:37.013
convinced that my first
idea was the best one.

94
00:04:37.013 --> 00:04:39.622
Please don't be scared of
making changes along the way.

95
00:04:39.622 --> 00:04:41.836
If the first thing that you
set up was working, but

96
00:04:41.836 --> 00:04:43.857
then you start running
into trouble with it.

97
00:04:43.857 --> 00:04:46.799
Always think about the easiest
solution you can come up with first,

98
00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:49.703
instead of forcing the thing that
you're using to actually work.

99
00:04:49.703 --> 00:04:53.728
The other cool thing, and this would
happen with grid or with Flexbox,

100
00:04:53.728 --> 00:04:58.022
this option is available to us is with
these notes now you can see very clearly

101
00:04:58.022 --> 00:05:02.677
that the taller items versus the other
ones, this one's taking up a lot of space.

102
00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:04.239
This had all that extra room.

103
00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:06.000
That's why the items were stretching out.

104
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.878
The rows were getting a bit bigger
to fill up all that extra space.

105
00:05:08.878 --> 00:05:10.646
Now all that extra space is at the bottom.

106
00:05:10.646 --> 00:05:15.266
We happen to have this handy little card
note that's down here at the bottom.

107
00:05:15.266 --> 00:05:20.978
And if we look at the design, the note
is always all the way at the bottom,

108
00:05:20.978 --> 00:05:24.079
and let's see if we can find one there.

109
00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:28.073
There's a bigger space here, so the note
is always stuck to the bottom of the card,

110
00:05:28.073 --> 00:05:30.196
and we're leaving that other space there.

111
00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:35.118
One thing people don't use enough of
with Flexbox is taking advantage of

112
00:05:35.118 --> 00:05:36.986
how margin autos work for.

113
00:05:36.986 --> 00:05:42.104
Because when you have Flexbox or
grid margin, auto works on the top and

114
00:05:42.104 --> 00:05:46.977
bottom, unlike in the regular world or
the regular block format.

115
00:05:46.977 --> 00:05:49.945
So we can come here and
say that we just do a margin,

116
00:05:49.945 --> 00:05:53.570
we'll do block start to stick
with our logical properties.

117
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.898
But if you just do a margin top,
it would be the same thing.

118
00:05:56.898 --> 00:06:00.934
And we can say that it's Auto, and
then it pushes them all the way down to

119
00:06:00.934 --> 00:06:04.181
the bottom, and
it's adding the empty space to the top.

120
00:06:04.181 --> 00:06:07.529
Again, if you're in a block formatting
context, this won't work, but

121
00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:10.883
as if you're in grid or Flexbox,
margin, auto will push things around.

122
00:06:10.883 --> 00:06:15.733
It's a little bit easier to use
a Flexbox just because with grid,

123
00:06:15.733 --> 00:06:18.377
it's doing it within its own cell,

124
00:06:18.377 --> 00:06:22.539
rather than it just pushing
all the empty space around.
