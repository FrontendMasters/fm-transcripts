00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.490
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's a thing called
event delegation, or event bubbling.

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.136
There's a bunch of different names for
this.

3
00:00:06.136 --> 00:00:08.790
This is a favorite interview question for
junior developers.

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.570
So if you're trying to get a job I would
suggest paying attention to this section.

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.015
Maybe the whole course, but also this.

6
00:00:14.015 --> 00:00:15.860
[LAUGH] Also this part.

7
00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:22.371
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I have 5 buttons here, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

8
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:28.930
And I could go through and bind
an event listener to each one of them.

9
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.790
That's a bit tedious, and also it's
less efficient to do it that way.

10
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.870
It would be really nice if I could do
one event listener for all five, right?

11
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.243
So what I can do is I do
document.querySelector

12
00:00:40.243 --> 00:00:46.960
('.button-container') so that's the div
containing all of the buttons, right?

13
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.150
And I add an EventListener on that and
I'm listening for clicks and

14
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.340
it's listening to clicks inside
of that button-container, right?

15
00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:01.189
Now if I click on 2 for example,
it's gonna say you clicked on button 2.

16
00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:06.550
But I did that with one
EventListener on button-container.

17
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.541
Now that it works is when
I click on the button,

18
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:14.939
if the button doesn't necessarily prevent
it, that event bubbles to its parent.

19
00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.960
And to its parent and to its parent until
it eventually reaches the root of the dom

20
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.770
and it just fizzles out from there.

21
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.237
But that means that every layer I
can listen on those parents for

22
00:01:27.237 --> 00:01:31.020
clicks or changes or
inputs or things like that.

23
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.620
So in this particular case, I'm listening
for a click on the parent container.

24
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.290
So this does get fired,
if any one of these gets clicked.

25
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.510
You also get this event parameter that's
being fed into you by the browser.

26
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.238
And I can say, event.target,
and then I can know which

27
00:01:49.238 --> 00:01:53.978
one was clicked on by looking
at event.target, okay?

28
00:01:53.978 --> 00:01:56.842
And in this case,
I'm just doing event.target.innerText,

29
00:01:56.842 --> 00:01:59.449
innerText is just gonna be 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, right?

30
00:01:59.449 --> 00:02:02.565
So if I click on 5 then I get button 5.

31
00:02:04.912 --> 00:02:06.534
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know
why it's firing twice,

32
00:02:06.534 --> 00:02:09.690
it's probably something to do with,
it should not normally fire twice.

33
00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:15.940
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Probably cuz I've
refreshed the page in some weird way.

34
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.770
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, I don't know,
maybe this works different in Chrome.

35
00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:27.030
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's check for
just a second.

36
00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:43.000
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nope,
it's working in the same weird way.

37
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.430
Yeah I don't know what's
going on with that.

38
00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:49.561
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, quit.

39
00:02:53.078 --> 00:02:57.757
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, something that I
haven't done that you probably should do.

40
00:02:57.757 --> 00:03:01.473
Because it's listening for clicks and
button container, it's also listening for

41
00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:03.790
clicks that are not
necessarily on the buttons.

42
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.890
So if I click, I'm gonna click
right there next to the button.

43
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.190
It's still gonna be on button-container.

44
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.360
You clicked on button 1 2 3 4 5, so
it grabs all of the text, right?

45
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.337
So that's what's happening because
I'm clicking on button-container and

46
00:03:16.337 --> 00:03:18.417
it's grabbing all of the text
from all of the buttons.

47
00:03:18.417 --> 00:03:22.179
Because that's the inner
text of button-container.

48
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.399
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
how would I prevent that from happening?

49
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.716
Well, I could check if I did.

50
00:03:35.341 --> 00:03:38.771
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If I checked
if event.target.tag type,

51
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:41.352
I'm gonna have to look at this.

52
00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:49.865
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: x =
document.querySelector('button').

53
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.940
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay and
I can say x.tagname, yeah.

54
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.290
So what I can do here, I can say like.

55
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.280
Oops, get rid of that.

56
00:04:07.671 --> 00:04:12.958
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If event.target.tagName

57
00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:19.350
=== 'button', butt, wow.

58
00:04:23.679 --> 00:04:24.830
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm tired.

59
00:04:27.386 --> 00:04:32.664
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
then here I would say alert, right, jeez.

60
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.340
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This would work, right.

61
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.403
You would check the tag name,
see if it's a button.

62
00:04:39.403 --> 00:04:42.090
If it's a button, then do it,
if it's not a button, then ignore it.

63
00:04:45.053 --> 00:04:46.140
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sense?

64
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.209
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, what happens if
I wanna prevent this from moving up,

65
00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:55.220
if I wanna prevent it from
bubbling even further, right?

66
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.760
Let's say this parent container for
button-container had

67
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.810
another event listener that I
wanted to prevent from happening.

68
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.295
What you can say is event.prevent.

69
00:05:07.743 --> 00:05:11.358
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Default I think well
that's not what you would want to do it's

70
00:05:11.358 --> 00:05:13.870
preventPropagation I think is what it is.

71
00:05:17.387 --> 00:05:22.548
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I wanna make sure,
event.event prevent

72
00:05:22.548 --> 00:05:26.829
propagation I think is what it is.

73
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.140
Stop propagation, is what you do,

74
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.849
and that would prevent it from
going even further up, right?

75
00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.952
And it would just stop it
right there at that level.

76
00:05:35.952 --> 00:05:41.409
There is also prevent default which,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There are some things that

77
00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.820
like, like forms, that if you like click a
submit button on it will actually try and

78
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.170
do like a full submit to like a server or
something like that.

79
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.860
If you wanna prevent stuff like that from
happening, you'll use prevent default.

80
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.300
There are several things that you can do.

81
00:05:57.071 --> 00:05:59.240
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
this will be stop, stopPropagation.

82
00:06:04.025 --> 00:06:07.280
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so that is
event bubbling or event delegation,

83
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.730
you can kinda call it
either one of those things.

84
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.700
And again, when I interviewed
as a junior developer at some

85
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.560
of the big tech companies, this was
a favorite question for them to ask me.

86
00:06:19.299 --> 00:06:24.120
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about events,
about the dom?

87
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.094
This is kind of like the surface of the
dom but hopefully it's kind of demystified

88
00:06:28.094 --> 00:06:31.319
a little bit so you feel more
comfortable experimenting with it.

89
00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:35.020
This is, I would say maybe 50% of the way
that you're gonna interact with the dom.

90
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.366
There's a bunch more stuff
that you can do with it, but

91
00:06:37.366 --> 00:06:38.700
this is a good starting point.

92
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.238
Event listeners, and event bubbling,
and messing with style, and

93
00:06:42.238 --> 00:06:44.440
messing with text, and things like that.

94
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.432
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good?
Please?

95
00:06:49.432 --> 00:06:55.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Could we talk about
the target portion of that text?

96
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.762
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure, so events.target,

97
00:06:59.762 --> 00:07:04.660
this is the where the event happened,
right?

98
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.590
So here I have five different buttons,
right?

99
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.722
So if I click on button 5,

100
00:07:09.722 --> 00:07:14.580
then event.target is going to
be this button right here.

101
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.000
It would be the same object if I said
document.querySelector for this button.

102
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.090
It's going to be
the representation of that button.

103
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.450
I could just say something, let's just
get this into code so I can mess with it.

104
00:07:35.218 --> 00:07:38.570
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right,
let's just make this full screen I guess.

105
00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:43.800
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if I came in here and
said something like.

106
00:07:46.293 --> 00:07:52.620
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Event.target.innerText

107
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.575
equals CLICKED.

108
00:07:56.575 --> 00:07:59.760
So that means anytime I click on one of
those buttons it's gonna hit CLICKED,

109
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.600
or become CLICKED.

110
00:08:02.086 --> 00:08:04.180
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
let's go back to my browser.

111
00:08:06.905 --> 00:08:10.192
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here, so as soon as I
click on one of these buttons, like 3,

112
00:08:10.192 --> 00:08:11.810
it's gonna become CLICKED.

113
00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:17.700
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Does that make sense?

114
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.450
So it's whatever button that
ended up getting clicked on.

115
00:08:26.599 --> 00:08:31.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, just makes
the whatever it's focusing on actionable?

116
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.680
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so you can start
interacting with whatever was the target

117
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.220
thereof.

118
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

119
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.360
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, you got it.
