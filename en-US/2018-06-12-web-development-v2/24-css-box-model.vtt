00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.490
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So so far we've more or
less been using CSS to change colors,

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.980
change fonts, change text alignment.

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.970
You can also use CSS to kind
of layout your page, right?

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.355
You can think about like,

5
00:00:15.355 --> 00:00:19.242
how do I get like this nav bar
to stick at the top, right?

6
00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:20.390
That's just CSS,

7
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.775
how do I get like this gray background
with the white thing in front of it?

8
00:00:24.775 --> 00:00:29.566
Again, this is all just CSS.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm kinda calling

9
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:34.300
this layout CSS, that's just a term
that I'm using in this particular case.

10
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.335
So without CSS, you couldn't have
two boxes like this directly next to

11
00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:42.925
each other, so
you use CSS to do things like that.

12
00:00:42.925 --> 00:00:44.222
So let's talk about how that works.

13
00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:55.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well, do I get into that?

14
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.720
So I just wanted to briefly touch
on this thing called float.

15
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.980
The reason why I wanna touch on it
is because it was around for so

16
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.570
long, it's how we did layouts for so long,

17
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.480
that there's a lot of code
samples still around.

18
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.100
If you go work at any company,

19
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.220
they probably still have some stuff
left that's been done in float.

20
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.770
Any more, I think the answer is that
you don't need float hardly ever.

21
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.670
Let's go with very rarely.

22
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.854
I say that because I actually
did use it on this page, so.

23
00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:30.850
[LAUGH] But really,
only for specific use cases.

24
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.566
So here, I've done this thing called
float: left, which basically means take

25
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:41.029
up as much room,
go as far to the left as you possibly can.

26
00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:45.680
And then once you can't go any further,
stop there, right?

27
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.880
So for this particular one,
it floated left, and then in this one,

28
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.220
it floated left on top of that as well,
right?

29
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.710
So it just kept pushing to the left, and

30
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.530
you can do the exact same
thing by going right.

31
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.780
This would have to clear left, same thing.

32
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.041
See, now this it's pushing right.

33
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:04.250
I noticed that box one is
the furthest to the right,

34
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.000
because it started floating first.

35
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.360
So that's what floats do.

36
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.712
There's a better way to do it,
it's called flex, and

37
00:02:13.712 --> 00:02:15.809
that's what we're going
to be talking about for

38
00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:20.195
the rest of this particular class.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In fact,

39
00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:22.570
I use it right there, display: flex.

40
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.695
But we'll get there, we're not there yet.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

41
00:02:27.695 --> 00:02:30.840
again, these are just two divs.

42
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.790
And if you remember, divs typically clear
the entire line that they're on, right?

43
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.540
They take up the whole line,
unless you do something like float.

44
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.780
So that's something to keep in mind.

45
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.590
Or how do you center text?

46
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.500
This is probably the classic
junior developer question is

47
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.660
how do I vertically center something?

48
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.610
Google how do I vertically
center something, and

49
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.840
you'll see literally 1 million results.

50
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.790
Cuz there are so many, so, so

51
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.760
many problems with people trying
to do vertically centering text.

52
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.600
Now it's much,
much easier than it used to be.

53
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.242
It used to be extremely difficult,
it's not anymore,

54
00:03:14.242 --> 00:03:18.642
lucky you.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so

55
00:03:18.642 --> 00:03:23.990
let's talk about something
called the Box Model.

56
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.020
This is actually kind of important for
you to know, and if you can learn this

57
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.660
earlier rather than later,
it's going to be a real boon for you.

58
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.030
It actually took me far longer than
I care to admit to learn this.

59
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.840
I did not learn this
probably till my second job.

60
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.350
In fact, I probably didn't even know
the word Box Model I think untill then so,

61
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.460
you're already like one
step ahead of where I was.

62
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.520
It is a little confusing, but hopefully
we can kind of clear it up a little bit.

63
00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.209
It's worth understanding for sure.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

64
00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.780
the first thing we wanna
talk about is display mode.

65
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.678
There's a CSS property called display.

66
00:04:07.678 --> 00:04:12.110
And this is kind of like setting
what mode, measurements are made by.

67
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.660
So by itself, a div by default is display

68
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.510
block, that's the name of it will take up
100% of the width that it possibly can.

69
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.440
It respects height and
width and padding and

70
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.220
margins, which we'll talk
about those in a second.

71
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.070
But all those things just work for block.

72
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.020
Spans, on the other hand, are,
by default, display inline.

73
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.210
So if you remember, when we were
looking at that CodePen example, and

74
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.880
you had that yellow text
that was just inline,

75
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.570
the reason why that worked is
cuz it was display inline.

76
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.790
But the thing about display inline,
if you tell it something that's displayed

77
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.250
in line to be like width 200,
it will not respect that.

78
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.450
Because it's like, no, I'm inline.

79
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.900
I don't care about widths or heights, all
I'm trying to do is fit in lines of texts.

80
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.150
So that's what display inline does.

81
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.590
So you can actually make
spans act like divs,

82
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.100
and you can make divs act like spans
by just changing their displays.

83
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.370
I mean don't, [LAUGH] but you can.

84
00:05:24.015 --> 00:05:28.570
That power is given to you.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So like it sounds,

85
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.240
display inline makes a tag behave as
much as possible like it is text, right?

86
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.099
It tries to make it go behave
as much like it's text.

87
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.560
So if you wanna style some text in line,
this is way to do it.

88
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.890
If you try and
change anything with padding, margins and

89
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.610
those kind of things,
it just doesn't respect them.

90
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.700
So if you ever find yourself trying
to change the width of something, and

91
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.190
it's not doing anything,
might be display inline,

92
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.270
that's something you might
want to investigate.

93
00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.541
It's a common problem.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Blockening

94
00:06:00.541 --> 00:06:03.360
the hand will do all of those things.

95
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.138
If you change width and
height and padding and margins,

96
00:06:06.138 --> 00:06:10.237
it will respect those.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

97
00:06:10.237 --> 00:06:13.109
by default,
block takes the whole line to itself.

98
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.250
There is a median called
inline-block that will try and

99
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.850
act inside of text as much as possible.

100
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.960
It will try and put itself inside of text.

101
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.110
But it will still respect width and
height, and stuff like that.

102
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.102
So that's kind of like
the hybrid between the two.

103
00:06:29.484 --> 00:06:31.073
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So like this green box

104
00:06:31.073 --> 00:06:36.940
right here, this, I just put that in
there, that is display inline-block.

105
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.770
You can see that it's just a green box
that I gave a width and a height to.

106
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:49.138
That's done using inline-block.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

107
00:06:49.138 --> 00:06:54.010
but we get into a thing
called display flex.

108
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.154
Now, when I learned how to code, flex was
just like this far off future promise.

109
00:07:00.568 --> 00:07:01.332
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's like,

110
00:07:01.332 --> 00:07:03.848
this is the future, but you can't use it.

111
00:07:03.848 --> 00:07:07.346
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And so

112
00:07:07.346 --> 00:07:09.231
I didn't learn using flex, and so

113
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:14.210
I'm actually quite jealous that you
learning today get to start with flex.

114
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.810
We've advanced far enough that
most browsers support flex.

115
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.160
And I guess that's something that kind
of just bears mentioning right now.

116
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.860
When we add new things to the web
platform, it takes a long time for

117
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:29.630
them to catch on.

118
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.400
So we have a new thing called display grid
that we aren't going to talk about today,

119
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.240
that I wish I could talk about today.

120
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.980
But if you use display grid, you're
cutting out 15 or 20% of your users,

121
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.130
which is way too much, right?

122
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.290
You wanna cover 99% of your users.

123
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.392
So flex has really good coverage now,
so we are gonna talk about flex.

124
00:07:47.392 --> 00:07:51.936
And you should talk about grid, and
I think Jen has a course on grid, right,

125
00:07:51.936 --> 00:07:54.571
on Frontend Masters, which is quite good.

126
00:07:54.571 --> 00:07:56.570
&gt;&gt; Student: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

127
00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.660
So both of those, so
we'll go into flex today.

128
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.618
And I'm sure she goes even
further into depth than I do, and

129
00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:08.355
she's quite good at it as well.

130
00:08:08.355 --> 00:08:12.260
So that's what happens when the admin
syncs to the browser, and to JavaScript,

131
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.550
and to CSS.

132
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.330
You can play around with them, right?

133
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.150
You can use grid today, but not many
companies are using grid in production

134
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:25.410
today, or grid on their normal websites,
because it's too new.

135
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.830
So not many browser is supportive.

136
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:29.730
Anyway, flex.

137
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:34.430
Flex is awesome, and it allows you to do
some layout techniques that bases say like

138
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.750
hey, I need this to be laid out in
the center, and vertically centered, and

139
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.060
horizontally centered, and
spaced out in this particular way.

140
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.842
And flex will handle all of that for

141
00:08:42.842 --> 00:08:48.860
you in a really nice version.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's also display table.

142
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.000
You can make things that
are not tables act like tables.

143
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.350
Not sure why you would do that,
but it is possible.

144
00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.114
Again, don't.

145
00:08:57.114 --> 00:09:02.030
There's also display table of row,
and the display table cell.

146
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.470
We can actually make
real tables out of divs.

147
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.170
And then, I guess I didn't say,

148
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:11.970
but there is display none which is really
literally doesn't display it, right?

149
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.230
If you wanted to, in fact,

150
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:17.850
I use this all the time on websites that
are trying to show you ads and pop-overs.

151
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.130
I was like, you know what?

152
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.783
I don't like you, I'm just gonna say,
here, display none, and

153
00:09:22.783 --> 00:09:27.316
it just goes away.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Life hack.

154
00:09:28.341 --> 00:09:28.961
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now you don't have

155
00:09:28.961 --> 00:09:30.091
to pay for any of your newspapers.

156
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:32.536
I'm just kidding, you should
definitely pay for your own newspaper.

157
00:09:32.536 --> 00:09:37.404
[LAUGH]
Anyway,

158
00:09:37.404 --> 00:09:41.880
so those are the kind of displays
that we're going to be talking about.

159
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.770
There probably are more
that I'm not thinking of,

160
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.580
I think I covered almost all of them.

161
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.420
Any questions so far?

162
00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:01.460
Cool, so now we're gonna talk about the
box model, and what that actually means.

163
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:07.180
So height, width, padding, border, margin.

164
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:12.193
Those are the five properties
that will make up the complete

165
00:10:12.193 --> 00:10:18.430
element.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I kinda made this here.

166
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:22.669
It's kind of ugly colors, but I wanted
it to work for colorblind people, so

167
00:10:22.669 --> 00:10:29.211
that's why we made it the weird colors.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Imagine this red

168
00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:35.060
box with the white interior is actually
the element that we're talking about.

169
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:39.680
It would be like this.

170
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.772
This would be display block,
padding of 5 pixels,

171
00:10:43.772 --> 00:10:50.476
margin of 25 with a 3 pixels solid red
border with a background-color: white;.

172
00:10:50.476 --> 00:10:53.850
So the box itself would be white, right?

173
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:59.190
That's why you'd
the background-color: white.

174
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:03.050
The margin is 25 pixels, so
that's the blue part here.

175
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:03.900
That's the margin.

176
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.700
And then padding is 5 pixels, so

177
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:12.510
that's what this little thing between the
green dotted line, or dash line, rather.

178
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.480
And the red solid outer line,
that's the padding.

179
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.650
And then this here is the interior
content, where the text is, and

180
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:23.640
inside of the border right there,
or the green right there.

181
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.270
And then you have the border as well.

182
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:31.220
So Interior content,

183
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.550
padding, border, margin, so that's
the order that everything kinda goes in.

184
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:43.710
So things that are, the two that people
struggle with are padding versus margins.

185
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.520
That seems to be the part
where people struggle.

186
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.690
Padding is inside the border, right?

187
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:55.590
So if I have background color white,
the padding will be white colored,

188
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:59.120
and the margin will not,
the margin is outside the border, right?

189
00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.390
So it will not receive
the background color.

190
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:07.806
So margins outside, padding inside, cool?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now

191
00:12:07.806 --> 00:12:11.050
here's the million dollar question.

192
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:15.620
If I say width 200, what is 200?

193
00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.231
What is included in 200?

194
00:12:18.231 --> 00:12:20.860
And the answer is, it depends.

195
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:28.002
[LAUGH] It depends on what kind
of box sizing we're using.

196
00:12:28.002 --> 00:12:30.540
Now if you are using the default
one that they used forever,

197
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.860
it's called Content Box, which is
a name you can forget right now, and

198
00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.360
never think about again.

199
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:41.890
But it does not include the border,
which sucks, or padding.

200
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.050
It doesn't include padding or

201
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:47.170
border, which makes measuring things
precisely really really difficult.

202
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.690
Because you have to do math of okay,

203
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:54.610
this content's gonna be this wide, plus
this much padding, plus this much border.

204
00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:55.740
It's math that you don't wanna do.

205
00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.250
It'd be really nice if I said width 200,
it included the border,

206
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.190
it included the padding, and
it included the content.

207
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.040
That's the holy grail.

208
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.980
That's actually what we really want.

209
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.020
What you have to do is you have to set
everything into something that's called

210
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.939
box sizing border box.

211
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.560
You remember when I told you there is one
instance where I will allow you to us

212
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.120
the wildcard selector?

213
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.791
That's to set everything into box size and
border box.

214
00:13:20.791 --> 00:13:23.641
So that when you say width 200,
it includes the border,

215
00:13:23.641 --> 00:13:26.320
it includes the padding, and
it includes the content.

216
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.840
Otherwise, it's just content.

217
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.820
So do I have, yeah, up here.

218
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:44.010
The first thing I put on every
website is wildcard selector,

219
00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:48.066
box-sizing: order-box.

220
00:13:53.392 --> 00:13:54.457
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that's so, for

221
00:13:54.457 --> 00:13:59.900
this reason, that I don't have to think
about adding padding and borders together.

222
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.320
This makes everything on
the website being measured in

223
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.250
border box instead of content box.

224
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.230
They've done a ton of research into this.

225
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:11.720
There's a really good
article out of Google from

226
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.590
our friend Paul Irish that goes
over why this is okay to do.

227
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:19.350
I've done it for years now, so it's
okay to do, I would invite you to do it.

228
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.932
It just makes life a lot easier.

229
00:14:26.483 --> 00:14:29.823
&gt;&gt; Student2: What do opponents of this

230
00:14:29.823 --> 00:14:33.620
fear?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Opponents of it say you

231
00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.640
should never ever use
the wildcard selector.

232
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.830
Everyone's in favor of using border box,
that's a universal win.

233
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.640
But some people say never use the wildcard
selector ever, and they're wrong.

234
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:50.470
What they're worried
about is that wildcard,

235
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.610
selecting literally
everything on the document.

236
00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.630
You're selecting a lot of elements.

237
00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:59.730
And they're worried that would
come at the cost of performance.

238
00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:05.600
But they're actually quite efficient about
it, so performance concerns, I guess.

239
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.819
Other questions?
&gt;&gt; Student3: So

240
00:15:10.819 --> 00:15:13.820
if you really did have
some performance concerns,

241
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.144
would you skip using the wildcard and
actually go in and just use all of your

242
00:15:18.144 --> 00:15:25.055
selectors instead?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If

243
00:15:25.055 --> 00:15:31.304
they were real performance concerns,
I guess you would go in.

244
00:15:31.304 --> 00:15:36.725
And if you were using margins or
padding or things like that,

245
00:15:36.725 --> 00:15:42.880
you would just individually set
the box as a border box on it.

246
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.290
But they've done extensive testing,
even on old browsers, and

247
00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.570
it does not slow down the browser.

248
00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.757
So that's not a concern.
&gt;&gt; Student3: Okay.

249
00:15:51.757 --> 00:15:52.852
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good question.

250
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.377
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I did this on purpose

251
00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:05.930
that width padding, border,
margin, it goes in that order.

252
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:10.652
So width, padding, border, margins.

253
00:16:10.652 --> 00:16:14.224
Or rather, the ones that you minus,
you have padding,

254
00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:17.340
then you have border,
then you have margin, and

255
00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:24.951
it goes in that order.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

256
00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:27.310
yep, we talked about box sizing.

257
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.749
That's when you can use
this box-sizing border-box.

258
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:32.730
Don't put anything else in there.

259
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:36.714
This is the only thing that you're
allowed to do with the wildcard.

260
00:16:36.714 --> 00:16:38.200
You're not allowed to do anything else.

261
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:45.306
I can't imagine what you would want to do.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cuz most of the time,

262
00:16:45.306 --> 00:16:50.058
when you wanna set defaults for your page,
if you wanna set a default font or

263
00:16:50.058 --> 00:16:54.790
default color, or default background,
you'll do that on body.

264
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:58.430
You'll select body, and
then you'll put it on there, not here.

265
00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.607
This is the only thing that
you'll use this for is for

266
00:17:00.607 --> 00:17:05.486
border-box.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here's the article

267
00:17:05.486 --> 00:17:10.487
that I referenced from Paul Irish.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I

268
00:17:10.487 --> 00:17:13.998
think he's head of
Chrome Developer Relations is his title.
