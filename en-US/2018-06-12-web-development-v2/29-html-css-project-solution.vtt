1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
So, let's go ahead and
start styling these.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.525
Let's start by styling a story.

3
00:00:05.525 --> 00:00:10.824
So if we come back over here and
look at our mock up here, the whole

4
00:00:10.824 --> 00:00:16.828
thing has these kind of black bars on
the top and black bars on the bottom.

5
00:00:16.828 --> 00:00:20.886
Let's kind of start with kind
of the borders looking here.

6
00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:25.788
So, I'm gonna say border,

7
00:00:25.788 --> 00:00:30.900
how do I do it inside of here?

8
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.456
I did it with just, okay, so,
a story has a border of 1px solid,

9
00:00:36.456 --> 00:00:43.236
we'll say, you can say black, black is
like the blackest black that it can do.

10
00:00:43.236 --> 00:00:46.524
A really nice black that
I quite like is #333,

11
00:00:46.524 --> 00:00:49.437
it's a nice like a little
bit softer black.

12
00:00:49.437 --> 00:00:53.247
So that's what I tend to use.

13
00:00:53.247 --> 00:00:57.434
So you can see here,
these now have a black border on them.

14
00:00:57.434 --> 00:01:00.475
Typically you don't want text
pushed up right against the side,

15
00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:02.145
it looks a little mushed together.

16
00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:05.355
Just a nice, a little bit of padding
gives it a little bit of breathing room.

17
00:01:05.355 --> 00:01:08.436
So if you put it like 5px or
something like that,

18
00:01:08.436 --> 00:01:13.109
it just pushes things away from the sides
and makes it look a little nicer.

19
00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:16.056
Okay, I'm gonna do something
with the row here,

20
00:01:19.216 --> 00:01:25.214
I'm gonna make this display: flex; right,
make sense?

21
00:01:28.056 --> 00:01:32.169
And I'm gonna do align-items, and

22
00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:37.617
I want everything to be the same height,
right?

23
00:01:37.617 --> 00:01:42.372
That's something that we kind of see over
here, everything is the same height.

24
00:01:42.372 --> 00:01:44.712
Even though like this is not
actually taking up this,

25
00:01:44.712 --> 00:01:47.162
there's a lot of white space down here,
that's okay.

26
00:01:47.162 --> 00:01:52.171
So we're gonna do align-items:stretch;,

27
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:56.802
and now if we come back over here,
refresh,

28
00:01:56.802 --> 00:02:01.684
now it's kind of starting
to take some shape,

29
00:02:01.684 --> 00:02:05.708
kind of fix these titles a little bit.

30
00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:12.928
So, come up here and do story-title,
we're gonna make this font-weight:normal;,

31
00:02:12.928 --> 00:02:18.153
I made it italics in there as well so
this is gonna be text-style,

32
00:02:18.153 --> 00:02:25.566
no, font-style: Italic.

33
00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:29.764
Let's do font-size:, maybe 30px and

34
00:02:29.764 --> 00:02:33.377
give it a bit of margin on both sides so

35
00:02:33.377 --> 00:02:38.858
I'm gonna say margin: maybe
let's go with 15px 0,

36
00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:42.141
and then text-align:center.

37
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.570
Starting to look a little bit
more like what we have over here.

38
00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.482
Yeah, looking better.

39
00:02:57.994 --> 00:03:00.853
Another pro tip is if you
have dense text like this,

40
00:03:00.853 --> 00:03:03.055
this is kind of hard to read for people.

41
00:03:03.055 --> 00:03:06.491
So, we can give it maybe
a little bit more,

42
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:10.318
we're gonna go under here and
do story-text.

43
00:03:10.318 --> 00:03:14.429
There's a thing called line-height, which
is how much like space to put between

44
00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:17.422
things, like how things can
be double spaced or whatever.

45
00:03:17.422 --> 00:03:22.190
Usually, at least for dense text like
that, you want it to be at least 1.2,

46
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.519
which is like 1.2 normal spacing.

47
00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.776
It's a multiplier, you can think of
that as being like a multiplier.

48
00:03:27.776 --> 00:03:32.244
I'll give it like 1.5 just so
it looks a little bit more spaced out.

49
00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:38.571
And now it breathes a little bit more,
it's a little bit easier to see.

50
00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:44.596
Cool, So

51
00:03:44.596 --> 00:03:49.450
that looks pretty good,
we want this to be a little bit more,

52
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.553
we wanted this one to be bigger in the
middle rather than the ones on the side.

53
00:03:55.553 --> 00:03:57.529
Right now it's split into thirds and

54
00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:00.861
we would like it to be more
like split into 25, 50, 25.

55
00:04:00.861 --> 00:04:03.361
A couple ways we could do that.

56
00:04:03.361 --> 00:04:09.160
The easiest way is to set the quarter to

57
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.693
be 25% width, oops, width: 25%.

58
00:04:15.693 --> 00:04:19.485
Now, if we come back over
here that looks terrible,

59
00:04:19.485 --> 00:04:22.595
[LAUGH] not at all what
I was intending to do.

60
00:04:25.971 --> 00:04:30.597
And then have the half be width 50%,

61
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.745
Yeah, that looks like a little
bit more of spaced out.

62
00:04:39.525 --> 00:04:43.833
Another way you could do this is you
can use what's called flex grow,

63
00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:45.102
we look at Flexbox.

64
00:04:45.102 --> 00:04:47.520
This one I have to look up
cuz I can't always remember.

65
00:04:49.593 --> 00:04:53.998
So there's order, flex-grow,
yep, that's what I thought.

66
00:04:53.998 --> 00:04:58.990
So instead of doing width 25%,
you could do is say flex-grow and

67
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.417
for quarter you want it to be one unit,
right?

68
00:05:02.417 --> 00:05:05.922
And then you want this one to be
flex-grow:2 cuz you want it to be two

69
00:05:05.922 --> 00:05:06.775
units, right?

70
00:05:06.775 --> 00:05:09.775
So you can have one unit,
two units, one unit,

71
00:05:09.775 --> 00:05:14.433
that basically means that this half is
going to be double what quarter is.

72
00:05:14.433 --> 00:05:15.955
So now we can get rid of these widths.

73
00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:22.259
Maybe not,

74
00:05:41.237 --> 00:05:44.789
Flex-basis, maybe that's what it is,
anyway,

75
00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.592
you can get a little bit
more clever with it.

76
00:05:47.592 --> 00:05:49.350
The thing with flex-box is,

77
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.003
it's gonna make sure everything has a
proper width to take as much as it wants.

78
00:05:54.003 --> 00:05:57.863
For now we'll just stick with width 25%
cuz I think that's a little bit easier to

79
00:05:57.863 --> 00:05:58.428
deal with.

80
00:05:58.428 --> 00:06:03.400
Let's get this image
centered really quick, So,

81
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.835
a couple of ways you could do this,

82
00:06:06.835 --> 00:06:12.755
the easiest way I think is gonna
be I think we could just say,

83
00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:16.674
what did we say it was, story-image?

84
00:06:16.674 --> 00:06:17.455
Is that what we called it?

85
00:06:17.455 --> 00:06:20.926
I don't think we gave it a class, did we?

86
00:06:20.926 --> 00:06:26.353
We didn't, so this image here, we're
gonna say, story-image, save that and

87
00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:31.875
then refer to story-image, and let's
just make it take up 100% of its space.

88
00:06:35.543 --> 00:06:38.223
And that way,
now it gets a little bit bigger,

89
00:06:38.223 --> 00:06:42.853
it's gonna stretch the image a little bit
but also puppies so I'm okay with it.

90
00:06:46.007 --> 00:06:50.400
Good, how do we feel about this?

91
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.560
You can see it's a really iterative
process, you just kind of like,

92
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.425
do something is like how does that look?

93
00:06:55.425 --> 00:06:58.414
Then you do something and
let's say okay, now how does it look?

94
00:06:58.414 --> 00:07:01.349
And a lot of times, I'll just do this
directly in the dev tools as well.

95
00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:05.578
Yeah, this story text is a little small,
let's make that little bit bigger as well.

96
00:07:05.578 --> 00:07:11.187
Maybe like font-size:16px,
or something like that.

97
00:07:11.187 --> 00:07:14.368
That's exactly what it is,
good job Brian, let's try 18.

98
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.161
Yeah, there we go,
that looks a bit better.

99
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:27.525
Okay, how do we feel about the middle row?

100
00:07:27.525 --> 00:07:31.232
Did that go okay, do you kind of
understand how we worked out here?

101
00:07:31.232 --> 00:07:32.031
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

102
00:07:32.031 --> 00:07:37.491
&gt;&gt; Cool, Let's go do the bottom row,

103
00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:41.648
so let's go look at our picture,
our design.

104
00:07:41.648 --> 00:07:44.725
And we're gonna have another story here,
so

105
00:07:44.725 --> 00:07:50.153
we can pretty much just use this styling
that we have up here on this one, right?

106
00:07:50.153 --> 00:07:54.971
So, we're gonna have here another row,
section.row, and

107
00:07:54.971 --> 00:08:00.544
the first thing that we're gonna have
is another one of these stories.

108
00:08:00.544 --> 00:08:07.122
I'm just gonna again copy and paste it
cuz, Not super interested in rewriting it,

109
00:08:07.122 --> 00:08:11.938
but you would just yeah,
say another have another story there,

110
00:08:11.938 --> 00:08:17.930
come back here and look at our picture and
now we have another image right there.

111
00:08:21.553 --> 00:08:26.078
Okay and
then the next thing that we're gonna have

112
00:08:26.078 --> 00:08:30.709
is we're gonna have another article or
actually,

113
00:08:30.709 --> 00:08:34.705
this looks more like a navigation, right?

114
00:08:34.705 --> 00:08:36.960
Because it looks like how you would
navigate to the rest of the site.

115
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.740
So there's actually one called nav.

116
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.620
So I'm going to call this site-nav.

117
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.980
Right, and there's an element called nav.

118
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:49.660
And that's really useful because assistive
technologies like screen readers can say,

119
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.130
okay, this is a navigation.

120
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.970
I know that all the navigating
links are in there.

121
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.600
So it's also helpful for
accessibility technology.

122
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.933
And it's just useful to you in
the future and I was like, okay,

123
00:09:01.933 --> 00:09:03.383
this is where I stuck all my navigation.

124
00:09:07.126 --> 00:09:09.181
Okay, cool.

125
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:12.500
So what would you call these, right?

126
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.960
I don't really know what I would call it,
it's kind of a list actually.

127
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.020
So I might call this an unordered list
because it doesn't actually matter what

128
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.230
order these come in.

129
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:21.570
So I'm gonna call it an unordered list.

130
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:26.371
I'm gonna call this
nav-list in fact I might,

131
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:29.500
yeah, whatever this is fine.

132
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.100
Let's actually even make this.

133
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.090
Let's do it this way.

134
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.870
We're gonna get rid of the nav.

135
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.336
And we're just gonna make this
an unordered list and I think that's okay.

136
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:48.653
Okay, I'm gonna do an li and
then this is gonna be like nav-item, and

137
00:09:48.653 --> 00:09:54.110
I'm gonna have five of those,
And what did I have?

138
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:59.507
I had sports, I had politics,
I had local, I had.

139
00:09:59.507 --> 00:10:01.790
&gt;&gt; Technology.

140
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.030
&gt;&gt; Technology good one.

141
00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.670
And opinion maybe,
I don't know doesn't really matter.

142
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.800
Okay, so
now I have these five list items on there.

143
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.900
Come back over here.

144
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.474
There you see them and we're gonna
make this a three quarter as well.

145
00:10:20.474 --> 00:10:22.771
Three quarter.

146
00:10:26.413 --> 00:10:27.321
Cool.

147
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:34.277
So, now we have here underneath this,
this is gonna be a three quarter and

148
00:10:34.277 --> 00:10:39.799
this takes up 75% Come back over here,
look.

149
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.400
Yeah, looks more or
less like it's doing that.

150
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.265
Okay, and now we're gonna
come inside of the nav-list.

151
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:55.450
And inside of here, we're gonna
have another display flex, right?

152
00:10:55.450 --> 00:11:01.000
Because this is going to be flex
in the column direction, right.

153
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.566
So let's do that.

154
00:11:09.304 --> 00:11:12.767
So display, flex,

155
00:11:12.767 --> 00:11:17.862
it's gonna be flex direction

156
00:11:17.862 --> 00:11:22.725
column And

157
00:11:22.725 --> 00:11:28.564
then each one of these is going to be a
nav-item right, that's what we called it.

158
00:11:28.564 --> 00:11:31.007
This going to be with 100%.

159
00:11:33.649 --> 00:11:40.624
See what that looks like so far And

160
00:11:40.624 --> 00:11:43.497
let's see inspect element.

161
00:11:52.344 --> 00:12:00.140
Okay, those are all taking 100% So
what we wanna do is,

162
00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.880
we want each one of these to take up as
much space as it possibly can, right?

163
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:09.450
So that's gonna be What did I do here?

164
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:10.226
I can't even remember.

165
00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:15.140
Spectacular.

166
00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.060
I remember the way I got
this I really liked it.

167
00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.590
Line items center and flex 1.

168
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:21.390
That's what it is.

169
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:27.591
So there's a thing here that
you can say to basically which

170
00:12:27.591 --> 00:12:32.508
is take up as much space as you
possibly can, which is flex 1.

171
00:12:32.508 --> 00:12:34.520
Make sure that's actually
what I'm going for.

172
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.290
Yeah.

173
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.010
So let's talk about what flex 1 is for
just a second.

174
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:42.000
As you can see here I still have to refer
back to like what stuff I've done before,

175
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.320
I have to look at this page literally
like twice a day so what I did

176
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:52.790
here is I used flex which is a combination
of flex-grow, flex-shrink, and

177
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:57.409
flex basis, which is what I was not doing
before I needed to combine flex-grow and

178
00:12:57.409 --> 00:12:57.949
flex-shrink.

179
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:04.510
And if you do flex 1 that basically
says take up as much space as you can.

180
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:09.200
And in fact, if I went up here and
I made these flex 1, flex 2 and flex 3,

181
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.070
then that's how what I was going for
before.

182
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:13.890
So in any case.

183
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.950
So it kind of makes sense that if
you say flex 1 is just basically

184
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:22.820
each one of these is one item, and I want
you to take up as much space as possible.

185
00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:27.570
And each one of these is going to take
up 20% because there's five of them, but

186
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:28.510
if I deleted one of them,

187
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.990
it would take up 25% it kind of just
automatically does that adjusting for you.

188
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.080
Cool.

189
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:36.230
Okay.

190
00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:41.000
So that's what flex 1 is gonna do here for
us.

191
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.260
We wanted to color them each
kind of different colors.

192
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:52.094
So what we can do here is we can
say nav- item, nth child(1).

193
00:13:55.922 --> 00:14:00.622
And we can say background color.

194
00:14:00.622 --> 00:14:04.318
I'm gonna copy these colors because
I could not come up with these colors

195
00:14:04.318 --> 00:14:04.872
on my own.

196
00:14:11.804 --> 00:14:13.070
Okay?

197
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:14.730
And we're going to have five of these.

198
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:21.160
So I'm just gonna do nth child (3),
(4), (5).

199
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.320
You could go through and give each one of
these like their own class then style that

200
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.930
on the class, but this is a lot easier
because then if we change things around,

201
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.430
we don't have to change the classes.

202
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.826
And then I can just go and
copy all these colors.

203
00:14:37.065 --> 00:14:44.059
Oops Questions

204
00:14:44.059 --> 00:14:47.439
about this so

205
00:14:47.439 --> 00:14:53.279
far while I'm copying

206
00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:57.894
pasting colors.

207
00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:12.842
Okay, so if we come back over
here to fronted masters,

208
00:15:12.842 --> 00:15:18.703
now notice they all have nice colors,
right.

209
00:15:22.751 --> 00:15:24.030
So, this is annoying.

210
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:27.720
We have this like annoying padding here,
which is what we added ourselves.

211
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.950
We kind of have to go back and
override that.

212
00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:34.157
So what we're gonna do here with nav-list,

213
00:15:34.157 --> 00:15:38.594
we're gonna say have margin 0 and
padding 0.

214
00:15:42.401 --> 00:15:46.900
Refresh that,
that looks a little bit better, okay?

215
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.420
This still has bullets, right?

216
00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.850
It's getting that from
the unordered list part.

217
00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.860
And in this particular case,
we don't want it to have bullets.

218
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.530
So you can just come in here and
say, list style, none.

219
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.411
Come back over here if that drop that And

220
00:16:02.411 --> 00:16:06.270
now we would like all of these things
to be centered inside of them.

221
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.495
This would be another really easy case
that we could just come in here and say,

222
00:16:09.495 --> 00:16:15.070
display: flex and

223
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:20.550
we're gonna have it do align-items center.

224
00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:24.160
And we won't mess with
the justify-content,

225
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.920
we still want it to be
sort of left justified.

226
00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.600
So that's going to center
it vertically in here.

227
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.995
We're going to give it a bit
of a padding on the left to

228
00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.900
kind of get a little indented.

229
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:43.746
So we're going to say padding-left,
maybe 25 pixels.

230
00:16:43.746 --> 00:16:47.171
Get that nice and inside.

231
00:16:47.171 --> 00:16:55.411
And then we'll get another font size
on that to be more like a 30 pixels.

232
00:16:55.411 --> 00:17:01.560
Looks a little bit more like
what we're going for, right?

233
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:05.905
I think I made the font color
a nice little kind of grey.

234
00:17:05.905 --> 00:17:10.721
Maybe let's go with maybe a CCC or

235
00:17:10.721 --> 00:17:13.992
something like that.

236
00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:17.329
Sorry, not font color, just color.

237
00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:21.074
No, a bit darker than that,

238
00:17:21.074 --> 00:17:27.015
let's go with maybe like a 999, 666?

239
00:17:27.015 --> 00:17:30.879
That's not lucky, looks nice though.

240
00:17:30.879 --> 00:17:36.903
[LAUGH] Someone's gonna be upset,
we're gonna do 555.

241
00:17:36.903 --> 00:17:42.233
Okay, underneath that,
then we're gonna do a font-weight: bold.

242
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:51.591
We could change the font-family as
well to be more like a Arial or

243
00:17:51.591 --> 00:17:53.488
something like that.

244
00:17:53.488 --> 00:17:59.315
So that's another nice thing that
Visual Studio Code will do for you.

245
00:17:59.315 --> 00:18:02.628
Notice here, it actually has
this font stack, it's like, hey,

246
00:18:02.628 --> 00:18:05.063
here's a good group of
fonts to group together.

247
00:18:05.063 --> 00:18:08.930
So I just hit Enter, if like if
the computer has Arial, it will use Arial.

248
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.975
If it doesn't have Arial,
it will use Helvetica.

249
00:18:10.975 --> 00:18:13.454
And if it doesn't have Helvetica,
it'll say,

250
00:18:13.454 --> 00:18:15.698
just give me something that's sans serif.

251
00:18:15.698 --> 00:18:17.434
Which I do not wanna get into typography.

252
00:18:17.434 --> 00:18:20.195
Also, you don't wanna listen
about typography from me.

253
00:18:20.195 --> 00:18:24.800
But sans serif is just something that
doesn't have caps on the letters,

254
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.113
basically, or serifs, I guess,
as they are technically called.

255
00:18:29.113 --> 00:18:33.903
So that looks kind of nice, right?

256
00:18:33.903 --> 00:18:36.688
I made those links originally, so

257
00:18:36.688 --> 00:18:41.400
I guess I probably should go through and
make these links.

258
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.948
So I'm going to show you another
cool trick that you can do with

259
00:18:44.948 --> 00:18:46.187
Visual Studio Code.

260
00:18:46.187 --> 00:18:50.186
So Command, no, so if I hold Alt, so

261
00:18:50.186 --> 00:18:55.733
I'm holding my Alt key and
I click multiple times,

262
00:18:55.733 --> 00:19:00.390
I can have multiple cursors going at once.

263
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.724
And then I can just start
typing in all of them at once.

264
00:19:05.875 --> 00:19:07.255
We'll just make this go nowhere.

265
00:19:10.724 --> 00:19:14.790
Okay?

266
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:20.050
And then I'm going to go to
the next after that, paste that.

267
00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:25.781
And then I was able to do all of those
all at once, pretty cool, right?

268
00:19:25.781 --> 00:19:29.487
Rather than having to type and retype
that five different times or copy and

269
00:19:29.487 --> 00:19:30.699
paste a bunch of times.

270
00:19:30.699 --> 00:19:34.529
Again, you just hold alt, and
then you just click multiple times.

271
00:19:34.529 --> 00:19:39.455
So if I just click holding Alt here,
you'll notice that I just

272
00:19:39.455 --> 00:19:44.206
get a bunch of different cursors,
I can type in all of them.

273
00:19:48.025 --> 00:19:50.383
Yeah, anyway.

274
00:19:50.383 --> 00:19:51.637
Sublime does that as well.

275
00:19:51.637 --> 00:19:53.837
So that's not a unique thing to code.

276
00:19:53.837 --> 00:19:57.892
Actually most, I would say at this point,
most editors will do that.

277
00:19:57.892 --> 00:20:04.729
Okay, so now these are a different color,
because links have a default color.

278
00:20:04.729 --> 00:20:09.863
So we come back over here,
and we're gonna say,

279
00:20:09.863 --> 00:20:13.619
.nav-link dash a's, right, so

280
00:20:13.619 --> 00:20:19.269
we want to style every anchor
tag inside of nav links.

281
00:20:19.269 --> 00:20:22.918
We're gonna say text-decoration: none,

282
00:20:22.918 --> 00:20:27.147
color we'll move this color
that we have down here.

283
00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:40.104
Or, sorry nav-item rather.

284
00:20:40.104 --> 00:20:44.613
Okay, so now there is a link, you can
hover over them, it'll change the cursor.

285
00:20:44.613 --> 00:20:47.369
If you remember,
if you looked at this one,

286
00:20:47.369 --> 00:20:51.404
you'll notice that if you hover over it,
it'll underline it.

287
00:20:51.404 --> 00:20:55.305
Easy way to do that,

288
00:20:55.305 --> 00:20:59.207
is to do nav-link or

289
00:20:59.207 --> 00:21:04.950
rather nav.item a:hover.

290
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:09.736
And then I say text-decoration: underline.

291
00:21:14.161 --> 00:21:17.756
So now if I come back over here, refresh,
if I hover over it, it underlines it,

292
00:21:17.756 --> 00:21:19.974
just to let you know,
this is definitely a link.

293
00:21:19.974 --> 00:21:23.701
It's just a good kind of thing to do for
your users is if they hover over it and

294
00:21:23.701 --> 00:21:27.982
then they see something change about it,
they know that it's an interactive thing.

295
00:21:30.078 --> 00:21:30.714
Yes.

296
00:21:30.714 --> 00:21:36.137
&gt;&gt; So mine has the error right now that
it's underlining everything all the time.

297
00:21:36.137 --> 00:21:36.693
&gt;&gt; Okay.

298
00:21:36.693 --> 00:21:41.128
&gt;&gt; So, and I tested it on just one,
like sports, for example.

299
00:21:41.128 --> 00:21:45.347
And then I assigned it the hover,
just like you showed us.

300
00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:47.979
Do you know why possibly it could be?

301
00:21:47.979 --> 00:21:52.323
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the first thing you need to
do is you need to remove it right here.

302
00:21:52.323 --> 00:21:55.904
So do text-decoration: none first.

303
00:21:55.904 --> 00:22:00.155
Because links by default have a underline.

304
00:22:00.155 --> 00:22:03.930
So you have to explicitly say,
please remove this first.

305
00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.685
And it has to be specifically
on the anchor tag, your class,

306
00:22:06.685 --> 00:22:09.125
you have to be styling
specifically the anchor link.

307
00:22:09.125 --> 00:22:13.322
You can't be styling the li,
right, so going here,

308
00:22:13.322 --> 00:22:17.633
I can't style this and
say text-decoration: none.

309
00:22:17.633 --> 00:22:21.843
I have to actually be
styling the anchor tag.

310
00:22:21.843 --> 00:22:25.773
That's another common thing to do,
does that help?

311
00:22:25.773 --> 00:22:27.380
Okay.

312
00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:34.366
So pretty close here, actually,
I mean, that's more or less it.

313
00:22:34.366 --> 00:22:38.791
Let's try this just for fun,

314
00:22:38.791 --> 00:22:43.747
to make sure that I'm not crazy,

315
00:22:43.747 --> 00:22:49.599
flex: 1, flex: 2, and flex: 3.

316
00:22:49.599 --> 00:22:54.430
Yeah, so that more or less arrives to
the same, if you do flex: 1, flex: 2, and

317
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:55.131
flex: 3.

318
00:22:55.131 --> 00:22:56.227
Any questions?

319
00:22:56.227 --> 00:22:57.579
Yeah.

320
00:22:57.579 --> 00:23:01.691
&gt;&gt; Can you speak to when
it's best practice to use

321
00:23:01.691 --> 00:23:05.918
margin versus padding
to move content around?

322
00:23:05.918 --> 00:23:08.077
&gt;&gt; It's a great question.

323
00:23:08.077 --> 00:23:14.532
When should you use margins and
when should use padding?

324
00:23:14.532 --> 00:23:18.536
There are definitely cases where
it's just a total toss up and

325
00:23:18.536 --> 00:23:20.386
it doesn't really matter.

326
00:23:20.386 --> 00:23:23.654
In those cases, I tend to lean,
actually, I don't even really know.

327
00:23:23.654 --> 00:23:26.237
I would say I'd lean towards margins, but

328
00:23:26.237 --> 00:23:29.197
I don't even know if
that's necessarily true.

329
00:23:29.197 --> 00:23:32.396
I guess kind of the rule
of thumb is margins are for

330
00:23:32.396 --> 00:23:35.374
spacing things between each other, right?

331
00:23:35.374 --> 00:23:38.497
So if I was trying to like add
space between this section and

332
00:23:38.497 --> 00:23:41.699
this section over here,
they're two separate elements.

333
00:23:41.699 --> 00:23:46.231
And so if I put margins between them, it
would be like a no man's land that really

334
00:23:46.231 --> 00:23:49.016
no thing would own,
either one of those things.

335
00:23:49.016 --> 00:23:52.440
In that case, you definitely want
to use a margin between the two.

336
00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:56.264
Whereas I'll use padding more if it's
included inside of that element, right?

337
00:23:56.264 --> 00:24:00.976
So inside of these links here where I'm
creating spacing inside of the element,

338
00:24:00.976 --> 00:24:03.204
that's when you want to use padding.

339
00:24:03.204 --> 00:24:07.073
So you have to ask yourself is,
am I just spacing things out?

340
00:24:07.073 --> 00:24:11.383
Or am I actually spacing
things inside of something?

341
00:24:11.383 --> 00:24:12.873
Is that sufficiently vague?

342
00:24:12.873 --> 00:24:16.347
[LAUGH] That's the best I got for you.

343
00:24:16.347 --> 00:24:20.214
It's just one of those things that you
kinda look at it and you just kinda know.

344
00:24:20.214 --> 00:24:25.778
And I think that kind of knowing
just comes from doing it a lot.

345
00:24:25.778 --> 00:24:27.317
It's a really crappy answer.

346
00:24:27.317 --> 00:24:31.049
[LAUGH] It's what I got though.

347
00:24:31.049 --> 00:24:32.643
Yeah, please?

348
00:24:32.643 --> 00:24:34.550
&gt;&gt; I have a quick question.

349
00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:37.550
When you're doing the sports,
politics, local,

350
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:42.201
how did you get the text to line up within
those each individual little color box?

351
00:24:42.201 --> 00:24:43.468
&gt;&gt; Like how did I get into like center?

352
00:24:43.468 --> 00:24:44.441
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

353
00:24:44.441 --> 00:24:46.412
&gt;&gt; I used flex again.

354
00:24:46.412 --> 00:24:49.466
So this is flex within flex within flex.

355
00:24:49.466 --> 00:24:52.614
We're not joking,
it's literally three times.

356
00:24:52.614 --> 00:24:56.329
So let's look at that,
that's a really good question, though.

357
00:24:56.329 --> 00:25:01.459
Right nav item, so we're using flex: 1.

358
00:25:01.459 --> 00:25:08.237
So flex: 1 actually interacts with
the nav-list, which this is display: flex,

359
00:25:08.237 --> 00:25:13.304
then itself is doing display:
flex on the things inside of it.

360
00:25:13.304 --> 00:25:15.950
And you're doing that
with align-items: center,

361
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:19.490
that's actually what's going to get
it to center in the middle there.

362
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:20.827
Make sense?

363
00:25:20.827 --> 00:25:21.991
Cool.

364
00:25:21.991 --> 00:25:24.990
I don't expect you to have totally
arrived here by yourself, by the way.

365
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:29.562
Like this is actually a quite a difficult,
if I had given this to you without flex,

366
00:25:29.562 --> 00:25:32.759
first of all,
this would have been totally impossible.

367
00:25:32.759 --> 00:25:35.870
This would have been advanced,
pay someone a lot of money to do this.

368
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:39.405
Flex makes this possible that I could
teach this to you on the first day that

369
00:25:39.405 --> 00:25:40.960
you're learning HTML and CSS.

370
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:46.195
But if you got most of the way there
by yourself, you should feel pretty

371
00:25:46.195 --> 00:25:51.540
damn good about that, cuz this is not,
this is pretty industry stuff.

372
00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.888
These are things you would find yourself
doing at a job, which is pretty cool.
