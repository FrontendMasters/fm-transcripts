00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.559
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's talk about Comments.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

2
00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:10.380
we as coders and as human beings
are forgetful bunch of people.

3
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.210
We do something, and then we totally
forget why we did it [LAUGH].

4
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.780
I'm speaking very much
from personal experience,

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.380
because I do things all the time
that I cannot remember why I did it.

6
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.220
And particularly, if you asked me to
look at code that I wrote last week,

7
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.964
I cannot remember exactly why,
or how things worked.

8
00:00:28.964 --> 00:00:31.790
Because I write too much things,
I do too many things,

9
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.110
I just can't keep it all in my head.

10
00:00:34.546 --> 00:00:37.770
Usually, I try and
write HTML, and CSS, and

11
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.740
JavaScript that I would
call self-descriptive, so

12
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.790
that you look at it and just by looking
at the code you understand what it does.

13
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.940
That is the goal, that's the Holy Grail,

14
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.234
that's always what we're looking for,
is self-describing code.

15
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.919
The code reads like it executes.

16
00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:59.330
This is not always possible, but
you can't always have code like that.

17
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.410
Sometimes you need code to be a little
bit more clever, or it's just really,

18
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.500
really complicated.

19
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.248
For variety of reasons,

20
00:01:07.248 --> 00:01:12.600
your code will not describe
itselves in various different ways.

21
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.730
The remedy to this problem is comments,
right?

22
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.460
So in HTML, you have the ability
to leave comments, and

23
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.529
they look like these.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now

24
00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:30.468
if I go up here to where I had
all the stuff with the table.

25
00:01:30.468 --> 00:01:34.568
If I put a comment,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here.

26
00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:39.465
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is a comment.

27
00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:48.441
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'll talk about that in

28
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.012
just a second.

29
00:01:49.012 --> 00:01:52.057
This is my font that does this [LAUGH].

30
00:01:52.057 --> 00:01:54.456
My font combines things together.

31
00:01:54.456 --> 00:01:59.610
So this is actually an angle bracket
with two dashes next to it, and

32
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.502
my font just combines it together
to make it look like an arrow.

33
00:02:04.502 --> 00:02:08.873
Anyway, same thing here, this is actually
exclamation point dash dash, but

34
00:02:08.873 --> 00:02:11.402
when it does that,
it combines it together.

35
00:02:11.402 --> 00:02:14.670
That's just my font doing,
there's nothing special about it.

36
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.020
Anyway, so this is a comment right here.

37
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.960
You'll notice that this doesn't actually
show up here at all despite the fact that

38
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.780
this is being rendered out here.

39
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.800
That's the point of comments,

40
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.530
is that they don't actually end
up being shown to the end user.

41
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.947
It's purely for the programmer behind it.

42
00:02:29.947 --> 00:02:38.210
In fact, if we went and looked at the way
this code is looking, I'll show you how.

43
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.810
Where do we go?

44
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:48.987
Down, down, right there.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, I'm actually browsing.

45
00:02:48.987 --> 00:02:57.712
This is really hard to see.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's

46
00:02:57.712 --> 00:03:02.732
switch that to be like that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

47
00:03:02.732 --> 00:03:05.950
I'm gonna go through my HTML right here.

48
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.020
We'll just look at this one right here.

49
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.530
So that line that I
have highlighted there,

50
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.470
that's not being displayed anywhere.

51
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.472
It's just a comment,

52
00:03:16.472 --> 00:03:20.680
it's actually for the framework that's
running this website called React.

53
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.713
That's what it's outputting there.

54
00:03:22.713 --> 00:03:24.971
But this is just a comment
that's being put out there, and

55
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:26.180
it's not rendered anywhere.

56
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.060
it's purely for the programmer and
the, so that's what that does.

57
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.820
It's a way for you to leave comments,
like hey, I did this for this reason,

58
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.200
or I put this here for this reason.

59
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.525
It's for you to leave basically
a post-it note to your future self, or

60
00:03:42.525 --> 00:03:48.997
to your future colleague, as well.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Again,

61
00:03:48.997 --> 00:03:53.140
we're writing code to try and
make it maintainable.

62
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.970
Cuz it doesn't take a ton
of time to write code,

63
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.120
but you will spend a lot of time
maintaining the code that you write.

64
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.160
And so that's ultimately what
we're trying to optimize for.

65
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.535
We're not trying to optimize for
writing code as fast as possible, or for

66
00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:08.670
being as clever, or for
being as terse as possible.

67
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.840
We're writing code, so
that we can maintain it in the future.

68
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.940
Cuz inevitably, your code has bugs.

69
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.640
We just break stuff all the time.

70
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.539
And so you want to make it so when you
come back, when something is broken or

71
00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.769
when you need to change something that you
can understand it as quickly as possible.

72
00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:28.740
You can kind of formulate like this is
what this system is, inside of your brain.

73
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.980
And then you can make the changes
that you need and then move on.

74
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.320
So spend time getting it right, right?

75
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.950
Spend time making it maintainable,
spend time making it readable,

76
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.030
make code readable.

77
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.310
If I can give you one piece of
advice as one coder to another,

78
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.960
make code readable,
make code understandable, don't be clever.

79
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.704
Its fun to be clever, and do that on
your own damn time, not my time [LAUGH].

80
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.470
So, that's what comments are for,
they're like little post-it notes.

81
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.230
However, don't go overboard with comments.

82
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.124
So the danger with comments
is that oftentimes,

83
00:05:09.124 --> 00:05:12.570
a coder will go back in and
change something, right?

84
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.890
And then, but not delete the comments.

85
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.250
And so, you have these comments
that are super out of date,

86
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.580
that used to apply to old codes, but
still are floating around in your code.

87
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.680
And that's terrible,

88
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.489
because someone is gonna go, they're
gonna read the comment and like okay,

89
00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:29.490
these does this, and then they're gonna
go read the codes, it's like wait, no.

90
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.620
It doesn't do that, right?

91
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.590
And so you actually end up wasting even
more time, because you helped the future

92
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.680
person make an assumption about something,
and the assumption was wrong.

93
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.890
So that's a huge problem too.

94
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.439
So be sparing with comments,
I think is my next piece of advice for

95
00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:52.095
you.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then something like

96
00:05:52.095 --> 00:05:55.879
this, if I have an h1 right here, right,
and then right after I put the title.

97
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.950
This is not helpful, right?

98
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.260
This is not helpful
because if I look at this,

99
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.170
I damn well know that's
the title of article.

100
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.940
I don't mean some comments telling
me that's the article, right?

101
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.860
It's just like okay,
thank you captain obvious.

102
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.280
Yeah, I can figure that out.

103
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:22.010
So, use comments when the code
fails to describe what it does.

104
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.274
I think that's kind of
the best way to put it.

105
00:06:25.274 --> 00:06:28.904
[COUGH] I have arguments with people all
the time about how many comments to leave.

106
00:06:28.904 --> 00:06:31.214
Ideally, in far on the like less side,

107
00:06:31.214 --> 00:06:35.300
like use comments only when
they're absolutely necessary.

108
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.940
Whereas some of my colleagues at Netflix
were much more like, comments everything.

109
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.950
So that's a stylistic choice, as well.

110
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.570
I leave it up to you.

111
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.030
You should leave some comments.

112
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.610
I think that's a base layer.

113
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.900
But I comment far less things.

114
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.455
And I spend more time trying
to write code readable, but

115
00:06:57.455 --> 00:07:01.964
anyway.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

116
00:07:01.964 --> 00:07:03.695
this is me calling out Gem Young.

117
00:07:03.695 --> 00:07:07.915
[LAUGH] He's another
Frontend Masters teacher.

118
00:07:07.915 --> 00:07:11.804
My way of writing comments is better,
that's what I'm trying to say [LAUGH].

119
00:07:11.804 --> 00:07:14.730
I'm pretty sure he's not listening,
so I can say that.
