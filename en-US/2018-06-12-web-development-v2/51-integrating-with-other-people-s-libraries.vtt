1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.810
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Great, we're gonna
talk about something that you're

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.920
gonna to have to do if you get a job or
if you even build stuff on your own.

3
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.080
Often you have to integrate with
other people's libraries, right?

4
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.670
So people write these really
awesome libraries like Popmotion.

5
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.770
Popmotion is something for

6
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.200
doing animations,
I cannot write things like this by myself.

7
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.393
Really cool stuff though.

8
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.945
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So stuff like that,
this is written in JavaScript,

9
00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:34.383
it's done really well, it's well tested,
it's used on other people's websites.

10
00:00:34.383 --> 00:00:37.968
This is something that if I had to
write myself, I would literally spend

11
00:00:37.968 --> 00:00:41.632
weeks working just on this, but
I don't have to, someone did it for me.

12
00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:47.985
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this is beyond the
normal capabilities of just doing it like

13
00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:50.900
normal CSS stuff, you need to
involve JavaScript in this as well.

14
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.629
So this is a great library, Popmotion,
and I want to show you how you go about

15
00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.338
thinking about interacting
with these sorts of things.

16
00:01:01.338 --> 00:01:03.275
So the one that we're gonna do
is we're gonna do this one.

17
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.798
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Again, something I could
have never done by myself, right?

18
00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:13.887
You have to do like physics and
decay and stuff like that, and velocity,

19
00:01:13.887 --> 00:01:15.038
it's tough stuff.

20
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:25.108
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what we're going to do,
not that one, back.

21
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.889
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we're gonna take all of this and

22
00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:34.188
we're gonna put this into
a Visual Studio code project.

23
00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:39.332
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's just close
all of our calculator stuff.

24
00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:40.861
We're gonna create a new folder.

25
00:01:44.755 --> 00:01:49.063
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
we're gonna call it, nope,

26
00:01:49.063 --> 00:01:53.380
new folder, this is gonna be called.

27
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.245
I have one called Animation already, so
I'm just gonna call it Anim or, let's say,

28
00:01:58.245 --> 00:02:00.760
Popmotion, Popdemo, there we go, cool.

29
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.980
I'm gonna open Popdemo
in my Visual Studio.

30
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:15.630
Make this large, okay, we're gonna
have a new file called index.HTML.

31
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.923
Index.HTML, pastes,
this is just some boiler plate stuff,

32
00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:23.060
stuff that you have to have in there.

33
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.196
But the thing that you wanna notice here
is I have the script tag right here from,

34
00:02:27.196 --> 00:02:30.560
this is called a CDN,
a Content Delivery Network.

35
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.960
So I can actually load off of
the Internet just the Popmotion library,

36
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.260
right, so that's what this is.

37
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.569
I just went and
found it on this thing called UNPKG.

38
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.966
It's this place where you
can load the libraries from,

39
00:02:42.966 --> 00:02:46.190
load JavaScript from libraries straight
off the Internet to experiment with.

40
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.864
You shouldn't probably use UNPKG
in your day-to-day website, but

41
00:02:49.864 --> 00:02:52.050
it's great for rapid experimentation.

42
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.994
Okay, so load Popmotion and then we're
gonna write this file called animation.js.

43
00:02:58.994 --> 00:03:03.803
So save animation.js and then we're

44
00:03:03.803 --> 00:03:08.468
also going to load animation.css.

45
00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:13.965
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and so we're gonna
come in here, it is very important that

46
00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:18.278
animation comes second, right, because
this library needs to load first and

47
00:03:18.278 --> 00:03:21.570
then this library can use
the stuff from the first library.

48
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.000
If you do it the other way around and
you try and

49
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.515
reference stuff that's in Popmotion,

50
00:03:24.515 --> 00:03:27.330
this'll say,
I don't know what Popmotion is.

51
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.600
So it's important that this
animation comes second, okay?

52
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.200
Since this section's not about CSS, I'm
just gonna copy and paste the CSS in here.

53
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.817
The only thing that might be curious
to you is this border-radius 50%.

54
00:03:41.817 --> 00:03:46.040
I told you before, border-radius is
when you start rounding corners.

55
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.871
If you say 50%, it actually rounds the
corners so much that it's just a sphere.

56
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:51.374
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

57
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.688
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if I come back in here,
I'm gonna open and what

58
00:03:57.688 --> 00:04:02.530
did I call it, Popdemo index.html.

59
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.700
You can see here it's a circle,
that's how you do it.

60
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.912
You do border radius 50%,
it makes it a circle.

61
00:04:08.912 --> 00:04:12.137
Okay, cool, give it a background color.

62
00:04:12.137 --> 00:04:17.815
I made it same width and height, and
then I centered it right here using Flex.

63
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.917
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good, good so
far, nothing new, okay,

64
00:04:22.917 --> 00:04:26.285
I'm gonna come back here
to Intro to Web Dev.

65
00:04:31.734 --> 00:04:34.488
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's actually just
get this straight off of Popmotion,

66
00:04:34.488 --> 00:04:35.375
Popmotion.io.

67
00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:39.410
Here's something that I did not write,
this is someone else's library, and

68
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.680
I wanna do this on my web site.

69
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.065
So he's got like this little
code sample right here.

70
00:04:45.065 --> 00:04:49.990
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say, fork
on Code Pen, we've been using Code Pen.

71
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.683
And he has this code right here, and it's
like, I'm just gonna steal straight off of

72
00:04:53.683 --> 00:04:56.870
you, just straight up copy,
paste this business.

73
00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.373
So stuff I didn't write, okay, and

74
00:05:00.373 --> 00:05:05.345
now we'll talk about the code
here in just a second,

75
00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:08.745
but let's just see how this works.

76
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.175
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, I come back in here,
animation, refresh.

77
00:05:14.175 --> 00:05:15.836
Now, this works just the same way.

78
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.052
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Pretty cool, right?

79
00:05:21.052 --> 00:05:28.140
And I, quote unquote, wrote it [LAUGH],
I successfully stole it, is what I did.

80
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.620
Now, I don't want to get
into how Popmotion works.

81
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.340
This is definitely not
a course about Popmotion, but

82
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.900
I wanted to show you how you could go out
and integrate with someone else's library.

83
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.960
If I needed this for

84
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.530
whatever I was doing, this is exactly
the process I would personally go through.

85
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.170
Because I would just blatantly
rip-off their examples, and

86
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.540
then bastardize it to my own needs.

87
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.370
That's my job because I am a professional
bastardizer [LAUGH] professional bastard,

88
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.600
let's just go with it.

89
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.349
Cool, I hope my mom never
watches this course.

90
00:06:02.534 --> 00:06:04.254
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Something that
you might be looking at here is,

91
00:06:04.254 --> 00:06:06.150
I don't know what this looks like,
this looks new.

92
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.430
This is called destructuring.

93
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:18.040
It's the same thing as saying const
spring = window.popmotion.spring,

94
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.151
and then doing that for all of these.

95
00:06:22.151 --> 00:06:25.013
You're just saying,
I know there's something

96
00:06:25.013 --> 00:06:29.839
inside of Popmotion called spring, can you
just pull that out and call it spring?

97
00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:33.730
Oops, and do that for all of these.

98
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.881
It's just a little convenience thing to
make that go fast, does that make sense?

99
00:06:40.198 --> 00:06:44.917
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if I did these for
all of these, it would have to be for

100
00:06:44.917 --> 00:06:52.180
listen and then pointer, right, it would
be tedious to pull all of those out.

101
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.220
So that's what this does, and
it's called destructuring.

102
00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.270
What else is in here
that you might not see?

103
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.780
We haven't used arrow functions at all.

104
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.524
This is an arrow function, again,
this is my font being dumb,

105
00:07:05.524 --> 00:07:08.573
this is actually equal signs and
an angle bracket.

106
00:07:08.573 --> 00:07:11.745
It's made to look like an arrow, but
in my font if you put those two things

107
00:07:11.745 --> 00:07:15.180
next to each other it makes it
look like a nice little arrow.

108
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.127
This is exactly the same as saying,

109
00:07:19.127 --> 00:07:25.061
function (e),
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

110
00:07:25.061 --> 00:07:27.820
that's what an arrow function does,
it's another way of writing functions.

111
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.200
It's actually the newer
way of writing function.

112
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.750
There are some subtle differences to how
they're different and I would suggest that

113
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.798
you get into Kyle Simpson's course,
he's about to delve into that.

114
00:07:36.798 --> 00:07:41.551
But for now, you can think that
they're exactly the same thing.

115
00:07:43.783 --> 00:07:47.725
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Otherwise, I don't wanna
get into too much how everything else

116
00:07:47.725 --> 00:07:52.689
works, but suffice to say that that's
how I would integrate with this library.
