00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.270
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So parents and children.

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.464
So something first I want to tell you
is you would typically call &lt;div&gt; here,

3
00:00:07.464 --> 00:00:08.906
the parent of &lt;h1&gt;.

4
00:00:08.906 --> 00:00:11.030
It's because it encapsulates.

5
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.310
So that relationship is called &lt;div&gt;
is the parent, &lt;h1&gt; is the child.

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.732
And if I had one above &lt;div&gt;, like maybe
there was a section above &lt;div&gt; here,

7
00:00:21.732 --> 00:00:24.678
you would call that it's ancestor, right?

8
00:00:24.678 --> 00:00:29.264
Cuz it's even further that a parent.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then,

9
00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:34.300
if h1 had another paragraph next to it,
it would be its sibling.

10
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.518
I'm not making this up,

11
00:00:35.518 --> 00:00:39.964
that's what people call it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

12
00:00:39.964 --> 00:00:44.870
if I have a selector that says div,
which is this one out here.

13
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.120
Because this h1 is inside of the div, and

14
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm assuming that h1 has
nothing affecting it, right?

15
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.710
This h1 will be blue.

16
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.425
So the parent selectors
will affect the children.

17
00:00:57.634 --> 00:00:58.970
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: For the most part.

18
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.480
It depends on the property.

19
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.884
But in this particular case, this color
will permeate all of the div inside of it.

20
00:01:06.074 --> 00:01:07.794
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Does it make sense?

21
00:01:07.794 --> 00:01:08.982
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

22
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.149
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I have a ridiculous one

23
00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.876
right here.

24
00:01:12.876 --> 00:01:15.980
If I have body, and
then I have bunch of divs inside of it.

25
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.080
And this h1 inside of it.

26
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.168
And I say body color:orange,
this h1 will be orange.

27
00:01:21.168 --> 00:01:24.190
So something to keep in mind.

28
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.480
That'll work for most of the font ones,
like font family,

29
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.020
which is how you change is this Helvetica
or Arial, or what kind of font it is.

30
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.512
Those sorts of things.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

31
00:01:39.512 --> 00:01:43.779
so that's a basic primer into CSS,

32
00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:48.340
CSS properties, and CSS selectors.
