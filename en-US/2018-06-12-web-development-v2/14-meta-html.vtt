00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.982
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So hopefully you've
absorbed a little bit about HTML and

2
00:00:04.982 --> 00:00:07.173
kinda what the uses are.

3
00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:12.125
I feel pretty good about where we are with
HTML, and how much you've been taught and

4
00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:14.408
how much you can understand about it.

5
00:00:14.408 --> 00:00:19.362
We're gonna have another brief
maybe ten minute lesson kinda

6
00:00:19.362 --> 00:00:23.648
more about the meta level of HTML,
just structure and

7
00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:28.997
kinda the boring parts of it,
if we're being completely honest.

8
00:00:28.997 --> 00:00:33.032
And then we're gonna get into some CSS,
which will start, I think,

9
00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:35.268
being a little bit more fun, I think.

10
00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:40.219
So we are on the Meta HTML section,
section 6.

11
00:00:43.557 --> 00:00:46.391
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So mostly what
I've been trying to show you so

12
00:00:46.391 --> 00:00:48.189
far is visual and concrete.

13
00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:52.645
And things that are a little bit more,
it's easy to see if I change this,

14
00:00:52.645 --> 00:00:53.898
then I can see this.

15
00:00:53.898 --> 00:00:58.743
What we're gonna do now is gonna
be a little bit more subtle in

16
00:00:58.743 --> 00:01:03.495
how it affects your documents
that you're creating here.

17
00:01:03.495 --> 00:01:09.139
So let's just start with the bare bones
basic skeleton of an HTML document.

18
00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:11.876
Right now everything we've
been doing is just kind of in

19
00:01:11.876 --> 00:01:14.448
the confines of these little playgrounds,
right?

20
00:01:14.448 --> 00:01:16.495
But that's not usually actually
how you're writing code, right?

21
00:01:16.495 --> 00:01:19.976
Normally you're in your editor, and
you're creating index.HTML, and

22
00:01:19.976 --> 00:01:21.475
it has a bunch of stuff, right?

23
00:01:21.475 --> 00:01:26.671
And there's a certain amount of just
base layer stuff that you need,

24
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:29.282
the term for that is boilerplate.

25
00:01:29.282 --> 00:01:31.497
Do not know why it's called boilerplate.

26
00:01:31.497 --> 00:01:36.291
But when someone says boilerplate, it
means just like this repeated stuff that

27
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:38.734
you kind of always have to have,right?

28
00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:40.637
Basically it's like what you copy and

29
00:01:40.637 --> 00:01:44.869
paste from the last project to get started
on the next project, because we all do it.

30
00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.678
[LAUGH] And that's okay,
I do it every time I start a new project.

31
00:01:48.678 --> 00:01:53.252
So this is right here that
I have these ten lines.

32
00:01:53.252 --> 00:02:00.086
This is the base layer of what it
takes to have a basic HTML document.

33
00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:05.908
And we're gonna dissect it line by line,
so you understand what's going on.

34
00:02:05.908 --> 00:02:08.910
So if you can see all
these 10 lines of code,

35
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.833
all that comes out of
here is Check this out.

36
00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:15.669
That's it, which is the h1, right?

37
00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:19.427
But let's talk about the rest of it here.

38
00:02:19.427 --> 00:02:25.830
So the doctype HTML, the very,
very first thing right here.

39
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.724
I was talking about it before,
this is HTML5.1 that you're learning here.

40
00:02:30.724 --> 00:02:35.469
HTML5 has been out for
a decade, I'm gonna guess.

41
00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.267
It's been out a decent amount of time.

42
00:02:37.267 --> 00:02:41.395
It's to the point that HTML5 is not
even a thing that we really say anymore,

43
00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:43.019
it's just HTML now, right?

44
00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.593
That's just kinda the base layer
assumption that everything is HTML now.

45
00:02:47.593 --> 00:02:52.489
So the reason why we have this
thing right here is we need to let

46
00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.668
the browser know we're doing HTML5.

47
00:02:55.668 --> 00:02:59.516
We're doing the latest version of HTML,
and that's what this thing right here,

48
00:02:59.516 --> 00:03:01.041
the doctype, as it's called.

49
00:03:01.041 --> 00:03:04.625
You can give it other docktype
headers to use older versions.

50
00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:08.472
But I do not understand why you would
ever want to do that to yourself.

51
00:03:08.472 --> 00:03:12.350
But there's like strict HTML,
blah, blah, blah.

52
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.800
I can't even remember what they are,
because it's been so

53
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.173
long since I've worked with it.

54
00:03:16.173 --> 00:03:18.707
It's been literally since the beginning,

55
00:03:18.707 --> 00:03:22.484
my first job that I've done
anything else besides doctype HTML.

56
00:03:22.484 --> 00:03:24.936
And they look more or less all like this.

57
00:03:24.936 --> 00:03:26.927
It does have to be literally
the first line of the code.

58
00:03:26.927 --> 00:03:29.122
You can't even do a space here.

59
00:03:29.122 --> 00:03:31.190
It has to be literally the first line.

60
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.726
So that always should be there.

61
00:03:35.726 --> 00:03:43.002
The next thing that you're gonna have is
this HTML tag that's closed down here.

62
00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:47.553
That's just like everything
that goes inside your HTML tag.

63
00:03:47.553 --> 00:03:49.565
That's just the way that works.

64
00:03:49.565 --> 00:03:52.620
It's letting you know the beginning and
the ending of your doc.

65
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.131
And then, it's gonna have this lang=en,
en as you may have guessed stands for

66
00:03:58.131 --> 00:04:02.491
English and you're just letting
the browser know like, hey,

67
00:04:02.491 --> 00:04:05.309
I'm sending an English document down.

68
00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:09.783
You can put es there,
which would be Spanish.

69
00:04:09.783 --> 00:04:13.940
You would send whatever language you're
putting that in there so that the browser

70
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.234
knows, cool you're about to receive
Japanese, be prepared to receive Japanese.

71
00:04:18.234 --> 00:04:19.393
Like that kind of stuff right?

72
00:04:21.885 --> 00:04:26.323
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Also just kind of as a side
note your browser has a language that's

73
00:04:26.323 --> 00:04:31.336
set for it, it's usually set by,
I downloaded this browser in America.

74
00:04:31.336 --> 00:04:33.208
It just assumes that I
want to speak English and

75
00:04:33.208 --> 00:04:35.856
it assumes that I will change it
if I don't want to speak English.

76
00:04:35.856 --> 00:04:40.638
So my browser is actually requesting
English from whatever website I go to and

77
00:04:40.638 --> 00:04:42.929
then it's receiving English back.

78
00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:48.489
So that's done through headers which we
will talk about headers in a little bit.

79
00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:52.092
But basically it's meta information that
I'm sending from my browser saying like

80
00:04:52.092 --> 00:04:53.902
hey, do you have any English documents?

81
00:04:53.902 --> 00:04:58.881
And then it sends back and with this it
says yes, here is your English document.

82
00:04:58.881 --> 00:05:03.889
So again, again we'll get more
into headers later in the course.

83
00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.517
So that's the HTML lang equals that, okay?

84
00:05:07.517 --> 00:05:12.509
We're gonna talk about head here for
a second which is this one right here.

85
00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.228
Now keep in mind that there is a header
and a head and they are different.

86
00:05:16.228 --> 00:05:19.780
So we're talking about head at this
moment in time, just so you know.

87
00:05:21.137 --> 00:05:24.871
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Every HTML document
has a head and has a body.

88
00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:31.552
And in the head goes all the meta
information about your document.

89
00:05:31.552 --> 00:05:35.540
So in this particular case,
we're just putting the title.

90
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.108
And the title is like if
you Google something,

91
00:05:40.108 --> 00:05:43.280
let's just Google something.

92
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.792
If I Google Frontend Masters.

93
00:05:47.792 --> 00:05:52.457
So this part, right here,
is what's in their title, right?

94
00:05:52.457 --> 00:05:55.318
So it's the title of the document.

95
00:05:55.318 --> 00:05:56.690
That's what goes in title.

96
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.445
It's also, if I click on this,

97
00:05:58.445 --> 00:06:02.028
notice when I click on it it's
gonna be what's up here in the tab?

98
00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:05.533
So it's also what goes right there.

99
00:06:05.533 --> 00:06:06.174
Right?

100
00:06:06.174 --> 00:06:07.179
That is the title.

101
00:06:10.261 --> 00:06:10.850
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's weird.

102
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.602
I'm gonna watching myself [LAUGH].

103
00:06:13.602 --> 00:06:17.096
Okay so
that's what the title goes in there?

104
00:06:17.096 --> 00:06:19.334
It's whatever you should it call
whatever the name of the document is.

105
00:06:19.334 --> 00:06:21.838
It's like this one's called
Intro to Web Dev V2.

106
00:06:21.838 --> 00:06:24.842
That makes sense so that when someone
navigates to another tab it's like okay,

107
00:06:24.842 --> 00:06:25.982
there's my Web Dev document.

108
00:06:25.982 --> 00:06:29.025
I'm just gonna click back on that one.

109
00:06:29.025 --> 00:06:30.303
So that should always be there.

110
00:06:30.303 --> 00:06:33.472
There are lots of other
things that can go in head,

111
00:06:33.472 --> 00:06:36.653
you can configure like the view port for
example.

112
00:06:36.653 --> 00:06:41.970
So the view port is like,
how do I wanna explain that?

113
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.324
If I'm on a mobile phone,
do I want the website to shrink to

114
00:06:45.324 --> 00:06:48.336
the size of the phone or
do I want it to continue like so

115
00:06:48.336 --> 00:06:51.493
they have to scroll side to
side to see the whole thing?

116
00:06:51.493 --> 00:06:54.929
You can configure that,
those sorts of things inside of the head.

117
00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:59.310
It's just like that meta information that
the user doesn't necessarily see, but

118
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.947
still needs to be configured.

119
00:07:00.947 --> 00:07:03.053
That stuff all goes in head.

120
00:07:03.053 --> 00:07:08.336
All of your CSS Links all
go in the head as well.

121
00:07:08.336 --> 00:07:12.154
There's some other things as well.

122
00:07:12.154 --> 00:07:15.724
So basically if it's a thing
that's not shown to the user but

123
00:07:15.724 --> 00:07:20.208
it's used to configure your website,
those sorts of things go in the head.

124
00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:23.896
Body, so the things that go in body
is what we've been writing so far.

125
00:07:23.896 --> 00:07:26.868
It's all your divs,
spans, etc, etc, right?

126
00:07:26.868 --> 00:07:29.020
All that stuff is gonna
go inside of your body.

127
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.029
That's the step that
people are going to see.

128
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:37.104
So that's where our H1 went,
I put a comment in there, yeah.

129
00:07:39.888 --> 00:07:41.263
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then, that is like,

130
00:07:41.263 --> 00:07:44.605
this is the bare minimum stuff
that you need to run a website.

131
00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:50.126
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's actually a couple
other things that probably should

132
00:07:50.126 --> 00:07:50.673
be in there.

133
00:07:50.673 --> 00:07:53.459
But we're kind of ignoring for
now which is okay.

134
00:07:59.644 --> 00:08:04.600
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so
last thing I want to talk about

135
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.666
are script, style, and link.

136
00:08:08.666 --> 00:08:14.193
So Script is how you link
JavaScript files into your HTML.

137
00:08:14.193 --> 00:08:18.275
Because your HTML and your JavaScript
files are going to be separate files,

138
00:08:18.275 --> 00:08:21.591
you are not gonna put them together
you gonna separate them and

139
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:23.980
believe me it's gonna end up being better.

140
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.830
So that's gonna be linked
in via script tag.

141
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.044
And it's the same thing with link.

142
00:08:29.044 --> 00:08:31.898
Link is how you bring in all of your CSS.

143
00:08:31.898 --> 00:08:35.972
And then again and your CSS isn't
gonna live in a different file and

144
00:08:35.972 --> 00:08:38.610
you're gonna be brought in via a link tag.

145
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:43.043
Today we're gonna be using a lot of Style
tags, just because I want you to be able

146
00:08:43.043 --> 00:08:46.832
to see your HTML and your CSS at
the same time and be able to edit them.

147
00:08:46.832 --> 00:08:48.996
That´s not typically how
you´re gonna do things.

148
00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:52.198
You typically are gonna have a link
tag with a separate CSS file that's

149
00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:53.180
gonna be brought in.

150
00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:58.462
But just for today, just for demonstration
purposes, we´re gonna be using style tags.

151
00:08:58.462 --> 00:09:02.127
So we'll get more into that when
we kind of get there but just so

152
00:09:02.127 --> 00:09:07.224
you know this is a typical, you definitely
you don't wanna use style text normally.

153
00:09:07.224 --> 00:09:14.542
So what a style tag is can actually put
CSS inside of the style tag, it will work.

154
00:09:14.542 --> 00:09:17.720
We'll see what that looks
like in the next section.

155
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.382
So any questions about this Meta HTML?

156
00:09:22.382 --> 00:09:27.983
It's kind of again nebulous
because it's hard to visualize.

157
00:09:27.983 --> 00:09:32.071
So, it's one of those things that you just
like, you just kinda have to do it and

158
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:34.161
you forget that you do it and it's fine.

159
00:09:34.161 --> 00:09:38.449
[LAUGH] Because normally you don't
have to change it very much.

160
00:09:38.449 --> 00:09:41.218
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What does meta mean?

161
00:09:41.218 --> 00:09:42.075
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What does meta mean?

162
00:09:42.075 --> 00:09:42.997
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

163
00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:51.030
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: How do I
want to explain that?

164
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.180
It's a good question.

165
00:09:55.988 --> 00:09:58.126
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In this particular case,
I don't know,

166
00:09:58.126 --> 00:10:02.036
I'm not gonna define meta because I'm
probably not gonna get it right, but

167
00:10:02.036 --> 00:10:05.518
in this particular case it means
something that you are doing that is

168
00:10:05.518 --> 00:10:08.171
not necessarily going to
be displayed on the page.

169
00:10:08.171 --> 00:10:12.644
It's not necessarily going to have
like an immediate concrete effect.

170
00:10:12.644 --> 00:10:18.058
So if I change what the title is is not
gonna change the way that my page looks.

171
00:10:18.058 --> 00:10:22.791
But it's still affecting my page and
probably more subtle always.

172
00:10:22.791 --> 00:10:25.576
That changes the way the page just,
works, right?

173
00:10:25.576 --> 00:10:30.245
Like if I changed the DOCTYPE, it would
change the way that the page was rendered.

174
00:10:30.245 --> 00:10:34.496
It would use a different rendering engine
underneath it, which would change,

175
00:10:34.496 --> 00:10:38.557
how things were laid out, and how they
were what colors and, I don't know,

176
00:10:38.557 --> 00:10:39.836
things of that nature.

177
00:10:39.836 --> 00:10:42.961
So they're more subtle changes.

178
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:45.986
So, it's a sufficiently vague answer.

179
00:10:45.986 --> 00:10:49.130
It's kind of difficult to define.

180
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.434
But, I mean, it's a good question.

181
00:10:52.434 --> 00:10:53.467
Yeah, of course.
