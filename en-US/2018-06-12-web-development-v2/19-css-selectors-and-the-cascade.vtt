00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: CSS Selectors and
the Cascade.

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:06.938
So now we're gonna talk about the C
part we're gonna answer our friend's

3
00:00:06.938 --> 00:00:08.582
question which one wins?

4
00:00:08.582 --> 00:00:10.116
Which is always a good question.

5
00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:17.516
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The Cascade,

6
00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:21.320
this is always just the part that I
get least excited to talk about, okay.

7
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.211
The cascade is gonna cause you so
many problems.

8
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:26.306
It's going to take years off your life.

9
00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:31.306
[LAUGH] It's really cool,
you can see why they created it but

10
00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:35.506
I've worked at enough
companies to see it used and

11
00:00:35.506 --> 00:00:39.309
abused in so many terrible, terrible ways.

12
00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.234
That's why I get a little stressed
out whenever I say the word cascade.

13
00:00:43.234 --> 00:00:49.568
So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's

14
00:00:49.568 --> 00:00:55.141
say I have two paragraphs,
must have broken this somewhere around.

15
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:57.823
But pretend this one's red and
pretend this one's green.

16
00:00:57.823 --> 00:01:01.085
And I wanna make them
style different ways.

17
00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:04.313
As you might imagine I might use
classes to differentiate the two.

18
00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:07.064
That's what we talked about previously.

19
00:01:07.064 --> 00:01:11.514
So I would say this one would be,
I don't know error text and

20
00:01:11.514 --> 00:01:16.320
this would be success text or
something to that effect, right,

21
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.904
some semantic good name thereof.

22
00:01:18.904 --> 00:01:22.361
So we did that with
the section on classes and

23
00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:27.413
making sure that we've labeled
them well and things like that.

24
00:01:27.413 --> 00:01:32.356
And we do a thing here like,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This one would

25
00:01:32.356 --> 00:01:34.287
be called branding and
this one would be called post title.

26
00:01:34.287 --> 00:01:35.622
And this would have one set of styling.

27
00:01:35.622 --> 00:01:36.702
And this would be another sort of styling.

28
00:01:39.128 --> 00:01:40.259
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is
what I'm saying here,

29
00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.787
we're gonna be using the style tag here.

30
00:01:41.787 --> 00:01:43.865
This is not typically how you would do it.

31
00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:47.882
You would typically have a separate
CSS file and a separate HTML file.

32
00:01:47.882 --> 00:01:52.886
But for instruction purposes,
we're just doing it all in one file, cool?

33
00:01:52.886 --> 00:01:58.615
The other thing I will tell you is that
this style will bleed outside of this,

34
00:01:58.615 --> 00:01:59.969
just so you know.

35
00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.224
So, if I say all h1s on the page should

36
00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:10.441
be,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Orange,

37
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:13.414
this won't affect the entire page.

38
00:02:13.414 --> 00:02:16.466
So just be aware that if you start
seeing things that look really

39
00:02:16.466 --> 00:02:20.112
weird it's probably because you put
something in a code block somewhere.

40
00:02:20.112 --> 00:02:24.707
Okay, so if I have an h1 here called
branding and an h1 here called

41
00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:29.645
blog-post-title and I want this one
to be red and this one to be green.

42
00:02:29.645 --> 00:02:35.611
This one I select branding and
this one I select blog post title.

43
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:39.239
The way that you differentiate
that I am asking for a class and

44
00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.672
not for a tag is you put this period here.

45
00:02:41.672 --> 00:02:47.605
This period before
the selector means class.

46
00:02:50.577 --> 00:02:54.176
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, yeah, just make sure
you remember that the period means class.

47
00:02:54.176 --> 00:02:59.205
So if I wanna select the class
called branding, I do .branding.

48
00:02:59.205 --> 00:03:03.431
Or if I wanna do blog post title,
it's .blog-post-title.

49
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:07.599
If I delete this dot,
it's gonna mess this up.

50
00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.849
It's going to be looking literally for
a tag called branding,

51
00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.541
which is not a real tag, but
that's what it's going to be looking for.

52
00:03:14.541 --> 00:03:16.584
Does it make sense?

53
00:03:16.584 --> 00:03:18.895
So .branding.

54
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.282
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's what you
look for, you look for the dot.

55
00:03:29.984 --> 00:03:33.792
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Generally speaking
should you style on tags or classes?

56
00:03:33.792 --> 00:03:38.541
Always style on classes,
don't style on tags.

57
00:03:38.541 --> 00:03:41.687
Hardly ever, I would not suggest it.

58
00:03:41.687 --> 00:03:46.589
The only time that I would suggest
styling on tags is if you literally

59
00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:50.720
mean everything in this
document should look like this.

60
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.722
And a good example of that was,
if I'm doing a website like this one,

61
00:03:54.722 --> 00:03:59.414
this Intro to Web Dev, and if I go look at
this, you'll notice that all of my all of

62
00:03:59.414 --> 00:04:02.119
my anchor tags,
all of my links look the same.

63
00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:06.774
That makes sense, because now I want
all anchor tags to look like that.

64
00:04:06.774 --> 00:04:09.318
That would make sense for
me to style by a tag.

65
00:04:09.318 --> 00:04:12.696
But I only wanna do that if I
literally mean every single one.

66
00:04:12.696 --> 00:04:15.227
That make sense?

67
00:04:15.227 --> 00:04:19.488
I would say that I'm giving mostly
my opinion on these things.

68
00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:23.528
There might be people that disagree with
me but they would be wrong first of all.

69
00:04:23.528 --> 00:04:27.951
[LAUGH] And second I don't think
it's actually that controversial.

70
00:04:27.951 --> 00:04:30.390
I think most people would tell
you a relatively similar thing.

71
00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:37.226
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So style by class.

72
00:04:37.226 --> 00:04:39.408
That's just kind of a thing
that you wanna get used to.

73
00:04:39.408 --> 00:04:41.321
Mostly you should be styling by classes.

74
00:04:44.827 --> 00:04:48.271
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You will have a lot of
heartache that you'll accidentally

75
00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:52.919
be styling things using tags that you can
avoid if you always style by classes.

76
00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.346
It's just a better idea.

77
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.360
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Err on the side
of using classes too much.

78
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.925
If you're not sure one way or
the other just go with classes.

79
00:05:04.925 --> 00:05:08.937
You might need like a tiny bit extra
writing but doing a tiny bit of extra

80
00:05:08.937 --> 00:05:12.145
writing will save you a lot
of heartache in the long run.

81
00:05:14.698 --> 00:05:16.244
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,
any questions about that so far?

82
00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:20.389
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Please.

83
00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.429
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I see that
you're styling by class there.

84
00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:28.612
Can you show us how you
would style by tag?

85
00:05:28.612 --> 00:05:32.836
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
you would just put h1 instead.

86
00:05:32.836 --> 00:05:33.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: With the dot?

87
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:37.586
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

88
00:05:39.513 --> 00:05:42.031
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's not gonna work for
other reasons.

89
00:05:42.031 --> 00:05:42.847
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

90
00:05:42.847 --> 00:05:44.947
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which we'll get to
literally in the next section.

91
00:05:44.947 --> 00:05:46.459
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, I was just asking-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You wondered why it

92
00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:47.000
wouldn't work.

93
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.475
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,
it wasn't working with mine.

94
00:05:48.475 --> 00:05:54.199
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
there are reasons which we'll talk about.

95
00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:55.002
But good question.

96
00:05:58.462 --> 00:06:01.376
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's refresh this page,
I think I broke something.

97
00:06:01.376 --> 00:06:05.593
Okay, that's an astute observation.

98
00:06:05.593 --> 00:06:10.597
So, you can see here,
I was sitting on the beach in Sydney,

99
00:06:10.597 --> 00:06:14.415
actually, when I was writing this section.

100
00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:16.089
I was like, I wish I could stop here.

101
00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.946
I can't.

102
00:06:16.946 --> 00:06:20.673
[LAUGH] So this is the part where CSS,
this to me,

103
00:06:20.673 --> 00:06:23.669
what we've done so far is pretty fun.

104
00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:28.011
You just make a rule and
see change and it's kinda fun.

105
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:33.684
There's a thing called the cascade
that has bitten me in the ass so

106
00:06:33.684 --> 00:06:36.999
many times that it just it's not fun.

107
00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:41.950
So I'm going to invite you to
avoid using the cascade as much

108
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.122
as possible,
keep you CSS as simple as possible.

109
00:06:46.122 --> 00:06:49.570
And avoid making it more and more complex.

110
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.248
And I'll give you some like war stories
and horror stories towards the end when

111
00:06:53.248 --> 00:06:55.992
you understand a little bit
more what I'm talking about.

112
00:06:55.992 --> 00:06:57.886
So the cascade.

113
00:06:57.886 --> 00:07:02.027
Someone asked before what happens
basically if I have two conflicting

114
00:07:02.027 --> 00:07:02.946
tags, right?

115
00:07:02.946 --> 00:07:06.069
If I have two things that are both
saying the same thing one of

116
00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:07.393
them has to win, right?

117
00:07:07.393 --> 00:07:11.591
If I say this one says green and
this one says orange and

118
00:07:11.591 --> 00:07:14.118
they both match which one wins?

119
00:07:14.118 --> 00:07:18.052
Cuz it's either gonna be green or
it's gonna be orange.

120
00:07:18.052 --> 00:07:21.291
It's not gonna be both, and it's not
gonna mix them, that would be way worse.

121
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:23.824
[LAUGH] So
you can be grateful it doesn't do that.

122
00:07:23.824 --> 00:07:27.532
I should write a library that does that,
that sounds terrible.

123
00:07:27.532 --> 00:07:31.352
[LAUGH] Okay, terrible ideas.

124
00:07:31.352 --> 00:07:35.872
So if I have .title here,
.title here, I think I probably like

125
00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:40.326
ruined the surprise so
far because I scrolled down far enough.

126
00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:42.739
Which one wins and why?

127
00:07:42.739 --> 00:07:44.445
Cuz these both are the same thing, right?

128
00:07:44.445 --> 00:07:47.730
There's nothing preventing me from
putting .title on there twice.

129
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.770
Obviously green came out on top but why?

130
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.326
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Because it came last.

131
00:07:52.326 --> 00:07:53.429
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It came last.

132
00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:54.985
That's exactly the reason.

133
00:07:54.985 --> 00:07:59.412
If these two are exactly the same,
so when two things

134
00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:04.957
are considered equal in terms of
CSS the one that comes last wins.

135
00:08:04.957 --> 00:08:11.818
Even if I had title and other title,
I'm not very creative right now.

136
00:08:15.675 --> 00:08:17.717
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's still
selecting by one class.

137
00:08:17.717 --> 00:08:22.105
And it doesn't matter that
they're different in any respect.

138
00:08:22.105 --> 00:08:27.015
They're both one class, so
therefore the one that comes last wins.

139
00:08:27.015 --> 00:08:29.154
Good so far?

140
00:08:29.154 --> 00:08:34.680
So when everything's considered equal,
the one that comes further down, wins.

141
00:08:37.117 --> 00:08:43.656
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so when you have two
rules with the same class, it's legal.

142
00:08:43.656 --> 00:08:44.677
I would not suggest it.

143
00:08:44.677 --> 00:08:48.311
I can't see of any reason why you would
want to separate those things out,

144
00:08:48.311 --> 00:08:48.961
but you can.

145
00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:50.436
It's legal, just don't.

146
00:08:50.436 --> 00:08:53.299
Which one gets applied?

147
00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:54.552
It's the one that's on the bottom.

148
00:08:57.617 --> 00:09:00.056
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It'd be the same if we
had two different h1 selectors as well.

149
00:09:00.056 --> 00:09:03.635
So if this said h1 and this one said h1,
it would also be the one that came

150
00:09:03.635 --> 00:09:08.275
lower that would win,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

151
00:09:11.503 --> 00:09:12.075
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so

152
00:09:12.075 --> 00:09:16.868
what I wanted to point out here is, so
yes these are two different classes here.

153
00:09:16.868 --> 00:09:20.992
So title-2 and name brand-2,
but notice one thing, so

154
00:09:20.992 --> 00:09:24.879
I have main brand here 2 which
is losing on red, right?

155
00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:28.479
Because this one comes down so
this ends up being green, but

156
00:09:28.479 --> 00:09:31.079
this one does not specify border, right?

157
00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:39.346
So it does get a black border because it's
resolved on a property by property basis.

158
00:09:39.346 --> 00:09:41.618
So this is 1px solid black.

159
00:09:41.618 --> 00:09:45.171
Notice here that it does end
up having a black border.

160
00:09:45.171 --> 00:09:52.300
I can even actually,
if I say border-style: dashed,

161
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:56.254
so you can see a little better.

162
00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:03.023
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I say up here 1px
solid black and I change it here.

163
00:10:03.023 --> 00:10:05.368
So just the dashed part is being changed,
all right?

164
00:10:05.368 --> 00:10:09.757
So it's even more granularly resolved.

165
00:10:09.757 --> 00:10:12.137
Does that make sense?

166
00:10:12.137 --> 00:10:14.273
So I'm just overriding the border style.

167
00:10:14.273 --> 00:10:18.336
This is called the cascade.

168
00:10:18.336 --> 00:10:19.148
Just so you know.

169
00:10:19.148 --> 00:10:23.388
It's going through this cascading
effect of trying to resolve

170
00:10:23.388 --> 00:10:27.471
the properties to kinda get down
to one resolution of style.

171
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.895
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're dancing
around this thing that is called and

172
00:10:34.895 --> 00:10:37.710
again I hate this word, specificity.

173
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:43.470
[LAUGH] Like go around to
a hardened front end developer and

174
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:48.032
ask them what they think
about specificity.

175
00:10:48.032 --> 00:10:52.374
And they'll just get this long glance,
this 10,000 foot glance,

176
00:10:52.374 --> 00:10:54.835
all the stories I could tell you, right?

177
00:10:54.835 --> 00:10:59.526
It's just like they've been to war or
something.

178
00:10:59.526 --> 00:11:02.475
And you just end up
with these rats' nests,

179
00:11:02.475 --> 00:11:05.751
I'm showing you here very,
very simple cases.

180
00:11:05.751 --> 00:11:07.769
But imagine this 14 layers deep, and

181
00:11:07.769 --> 00:11:11.325
you're trying to figure out where
the hell did this style come from.

182
00:11:11.325 --> 00:11:14.251
That's why I'm telling you to keep
everything really, really simple.

183
00:11:14.251 --> 00:11:19.452
Because the simpler you keep it the less
problems that you're gonna have with this.

184
00:11:19.452 --> 00:11:24.820
And I have some bad examples
underneath here so you can see why.

185
00:11:29.104 --> 00:11:33.957
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's keep going here.

186
00:11:33.957 --> 00:11:35.873
We did that.

187
00:11:35.873 --> 00:11:39.739
Now we're going to get
into multiple classes.

188
00:11:39.739 --> 00:11:41.201
So I have title three here.

189
00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:48.573
So this has title-3 and main-brand-3, but
now up here I have main-brand-3.title-3.

190
00:11:48.573 --> 00:11:50.826
Which color wins?

191
00:11:50.826 --> 00:11:54.877
Red, because it is more specific.

192
00:11:54.877 --> 00:12:00.415
It has two classes,
this only has one class.

193
00:12:00.415 --> 00:12:03.839
This one is therefore more specific,
and therefore wins.

194
00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:07.659
This is the specificity part of this.

195
00:12:07.659 --> 00:12:13.174
Now notice there is no space here
between 3 and .title, right?

196
00:12:13.174 --> 00:12:15.239
That it's right there shoved together.

197
00:12:15.239 --> 00:12:17.503
If I put a space there, I break it.

198
00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:21.753
So need they need to be shoved together
and they're separated by a period.

199
00:12:23.459 --> 00:12:27.527
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cuz it's the main brand and
it's also the title classes,

200
00:12:27.527 --> 00:12:30.031
both of those classes which it has.

201
00:12:33.909 --> 00:12:36.359
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
there's no space between them,

202
00:12:36.359 --> 00:12:39.552
therefore it wins because
it has two classes.

203
00:12:39.552 --> 00:12:45.477
Now keep in mind that this h1, down here,
has to match both of those classes.

204
00:12:45.477 --> 00:12:48.797
It must have title-3, and
it must have main-brand-3.

205
00:12:48.797 --> 00:12:53.488
Just to show you.

206
00:12:53.488 --> 00:12:59.617
If this just has title-3,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Notice it's green, because

207
00:12:59.617 --> 00:13:03.798
it doesn't match the entire selector, so
it must match everything in the selector.

208
00:13:03.798 --> 00:13:05.620
That make sense?

209
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:11.266
Okay,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Next

210
00:13:11.266 --> 00:13:15.861
steps here, h1 comes lower on the page.

211
00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:22.245
And title-4, notice which one wins here.

212
00:13:22.245 --> 00:13:24.983
Orange, why?

213
00:13:24.983 --> 00:13:29.002
Because classes are more
specific than tags.

214
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.396
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Why, I don't know.

215
00:13:37.396 --> 00:13:38.463
Why do we do anything?

216
00:13:38.463 --> 00:13:40.832
[LAUGH] It just is.

217
00:13:40.832 --> 00:13:47.833
So let me give you a little device to
see if this helps you kind of determine.

218
00:13:47.833 --> 00:13:53.057
You can kind of think of it as being
a number where the first number is

219
00:13:53.057 --> 00:13:59.511
how specific the tag part is, the second
number is how specific the class part is.

220
00:13:59.511 --> 00:14:03.110
So I think they have it down here, yeah.

221
00:14:05.699 --> 00:14:10.258
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this has one class, so
it's ten specific and it has one tag so

222
00:14:10.258 --> 00:14:12.421
it's one specific, right?

223
00:14:12.421 --> 00:14:17.959
Whereas if they had like three
classes it'd be 30, right?

224
00:14:17.959 --> 00:14:21.525
So you can think of this tens place
as being how many classes there are?

225
00:14:21.525 --> 00:14:24.612
And the ones place of being
how many tags there are.

226
00:14:24.612 --> 00:14:29.049
So if I had three classes,
that's 30, compared to five tags,

227
00:14:29.049 --> 00:14:32.612
which is impossible, but
ignore that for a second.

228
00:14:32.612 --> 00:14:37.673
The 30 would be bigger than the 5 so
therefore the classes would win.

229
00:14:37.673 --> 00:14:39.476
Doesn't totally work out.

230
00:14:39.476 --> 00:14:44.610
If I had 11 tags,
one class would be still more specific.

231
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.105
So it's just kind of like a mental device,
it's kind of imperfect.

232
00:14:47.105 --> 00:14:51.575
But just think of classes
being more specific in text.

233
00:14:51.575 --> 00:14:53.386
That's ultimately what I'm
trying to get at here.

234
00:14:57.045 --> 00:15:00.178
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's move on and
just like get this even more complicated.

235
00:15:02.433 --> 00:15:07.098
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I have title-5,
name-brand-5, it's in h1.

236
00:15:07.098 --> 00:15:13.301
h1.main-brand-5, main-brand-5-title-5,

237
00:15:13.301 --> 00:15:17.766
and main-brand, so this one is one tag and

238
00:15:17.766 --> 00:15:22.982
one class, two tags and
two classes in one class.

239
00:15:26.651 --> 00:15:31.626
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So thinking about it,
this is one tag, this is 11, right?

240
00:15:31.626 --> 00:15:35.297
This is 20, and this is one.

241
00:15:35.297 --> 00:15:37.711
No, sorry, this is 10.

242
00:15:37.711 --> 00:15:39.998
So therefore the one that was 20 wins,
right?

243
00:15:39.998 --> 00:15:42.996
So the one with two classes so
therefore it becomes orange.

244
00:15:42.996 --> 00:15:46.680
Does that make sense, okay.

245
00:15:51.494 --> 00:15:56.928
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is how you do tags and
classes together, right?

246
00:15:56.928 --> 00:15:58.315
This is an h1, right?

247
00:15:58.315 --> 00:16:03.744
Has no period in front of it and
then a .main-brand-5, right?

248
00:16:03.744 --> 00:16:08.481
So that's how you get the tag and
selector together.

249
00:16:08.481 --> 00:16:11.441
I will invite you to not do this.

250
00:16:11.441 --> 00:16:14.448
This is usually not a good idea to
do the tags and classes together.

251
00:16:14.448 --> 00:16:18.312
The reason being is it should
usually just be enough for

252
00:16:18.312 --> 00:16:22.012
you have just main-brand-5,
that should be it.

253
00:16:22.012 --> 00:16:27.214
And you shouldn't really
be mixing tags and classes.

254
00:16:27.214 --> 00:16:30.603
If something is made for h1s,
it should always be in h1.

255
00:16:30.603 --> 00:16:34.795
So you don't normally wanna
select h1s differently than h2s.

256
00:16:34.795 --> 00:16:41.660
It wouldn't make a ton of sense for
me to have an h2-main-brand-5.

257
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.185
That's really strange, and

258
00:16:43.185 --> 00:16:47.031
it's gonna be hard to follow when
you're trying to write this code later.

259
00:16:47.031 --> 00:16:49.447
So I would stay away from that.

260
00:16:49.447 --> 00:16:54.648
Again, just in general,
avoid styling by tag.

261
00:16:54.648 --> 00:16:56.138
It's just not a good idea.
