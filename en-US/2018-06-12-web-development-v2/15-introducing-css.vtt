00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.798
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, given that,
we're gonna start working on some CSS

2
00:00:03.798 --> 00:00:11.653
now.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

3
00:00:11.653 --> 00:00:14.190
we're building our house.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.108
We now have all of the timber and
all of the drywall and

5
00:00:18.108 --> 00:00:22.510
all that kind of stuff just
ready to be moved around.

6
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.273
And now we're gonna start writing
the blueprints of that, so

7
00:00:25.273 --> 00:00:29.168
it's actually gonna tell us, okay, this
piece goes here, this piece is this color.

8
00:00:29.168 --> 00:00:34.680
This roof goes here, those sorts of
things, and we're gonna do that using CSS.

9
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.490
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

10
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.100
Or someone told me they thought for
the longest time was

11
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.215
that they were California Style Sheets,
which I think is way better.

12
00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:48.550
[LAUGH]
It is cascading though,

13
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.590
we will talk about why it's
called cascading later, but for

14
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.690
right now you can just assume
that they mean style sheets.

15
00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.910
That's whereas HTML's kind of
more like English-oriented.

16
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.616
I don't say English-oriented, but

17
00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:05.870
like language-oriented that you're
expressing ideas and content.

18
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.690
Content-oriented I think is actually
probably a better way of putting it.

19
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.610
CSS is a series of rules.

20
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.400
So you're basically creating rules
that like, if this condition is true,

21
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.380
then apply this style.

22
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.800
And it's just gonna be a bunch of rules.

23
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.646
In fact, they're literally called rules
and we'll look at more into that.

24
00:01:25.646 --> 00:01:29.810
It's gonna govern things like colors,
sizes, order, positioning, hiding,

25
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.750
showing, animations, and
it's really really powerful.

26
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.520
I'm definitely not the best
CSS developer in the world.

27
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.526
I would call myself merely adequate.

28
00:01:41.526 --> 00:01:44.900
[LAUGH] And
I hope to raise you also to adequacy.

29
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.200
There's some really,

30
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.740
really phenomenal things that you can
do with CSS that take true artistry.

31
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.830
It's as powerful as your artistry, I
suppose, I think is something I wanna say.

32
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.763
So you'll get people hat are really good
with the animations like Sarah Drasner or

33
00:02:02.763 --> 00:02:05.271
you get people that are really
good at taking data and

34
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:07.780
transforming it into these
beautiful works of art.

35
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.390
Which would be like Shirley Wu, who both
are Frontend Masters teachers as well.

36
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.070
You should definitely
check out their stuff.

37
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.240
I am going to show you how
to make boxes green and

38
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.810
stuff like that,
also important, I will say.

39
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.960
So that's what it is like.

40
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.480
This is a tool that will get you,
I'll get you started in this.

41
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.860
But it's up to you to
really master these skills.

42
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.000
So like HTML,
it's not really a programming language.

43
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.870
You don't really run CSS.

44
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.770
You just declare a bunch of rules, and

45
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.620
the browser setting then just
follows your rules that you make.
