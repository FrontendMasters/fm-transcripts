1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is
actually gonna be pretty good.

2
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.083
We're gonna have enough time for
me to explain the project for

3
00:00:06.083 --> 00:00:08.797
you and then we can break for the day.

4
00:00:08.797 --> 00:00:14.312
And you all can come back, and
we can work out this project together.

5
00:00:14.312 --> 00:00:19.956
So, this is actually gonna
be you creating a file,

6
00:00:19.956 --> 00:00:24.420
an index file with a separate CSS file and

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.854
creating this kind of layout.

8
00:00:27.854 --> 00:00:30.952
So this is gonna be
an HTML in a CSS project.

9
00:00:30.952 --> 00:00:33.228
You should have an index.html file.

10
00:00:33.228 --> 00:00:36.133
I would suggest creating, like,
it's own folder, you can put it,

11
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.149
like, on your desktop or
something like that.

12
00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.351
And inside of that folder we have
an index.html and have like a styles.css.

13
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:47.834
Doesn't actually matter what you call
it as long as you are consistent and

14
00:00:47.834 --> 00:00:50.238
you're going to create this website.

15
00:00:50.238 --> 00:00:55.088
So this is something that a designer
would hand you this hey I created

16
00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:58.067
this in Photoshop or InDesign or sketch,

17
00:00:58.067 --> 00:01:03.193
whatever the hipsters are using
these days, napkins, I'm not sure.

18
00:01:05.763 --> 00:01:08.523
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I want it to like this, right?

19
00:01:08.523 --> 00:01:12.587
And so you would go back and
you would use HTML and

20
00:01:12.587 --> 00:01:17.169
CSS to recreate basically
something of this nature.

21
00:01:18.927 --> 00:01:23.625
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you have all the tools,
this is a far bigger project than I've

22
00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:27.192
given you before but
I also think it's useful for

23
00:01:27.192 --> 00:01:31.552
you to kind of try and struggle and
Google and collaborate.

24
00:01:31.552 --> 00:01:33.242
Feel free to talk each other and

25
00:01:33.242 --> 00:01:38.649
all these sort of things
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

26
00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.627
yeah, one thing I wanted to show you.

27
00:01:42.627 --> 00:01:47.034
So if I open my Visual Studio Code here.

28
00:01:50.893 --> 00:01:54.385
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna
create a new file, and

29
00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:58.389
let's just say this goes on desktop.

30
00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:01.896
I'm gonna call it fem for
FrontEnd Masters,

31
00:02:01.896 --> 00:02:05.598
and inside of here I'm
gonna put index.html.

32
00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:13.291
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well, one thing
I'll show you that's really useful

33
00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:17.864
specifically with code,
if I put html:5 and

34
00:02:17.864 --> 00:02:22.802
just hit tab,
it generates all that stuff for me.

35
00:02:22.802 --> 00:02:26.269
And I wanna have to, I can't t remember
all that at the top of my head.

36
00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.898
You can leave the meta stuff as well.

37
00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:32.450
They are basically just saying like
this is encoded in this particular way.

38
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.768
This is how big I want the view port so
just you can leave that.

39
00:02:37.768 --> 00:02:42.089
And like I don't really actually know
what this one does, I just leave it.

40
00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:45.746
[LAUGH] It's one of those things that
like yeah, just leave it, it's fine.

41
00:02:45.746 --> 00:02:50.034
We'll call this Frontend Masters and

42
00:02:50.034 --> 00:02:55.265
we'll just put like h1
in here that says lol.

43
00:02:55.265 --> 00:02:58.037
Okay, so now I have this HTML document,

44
00:02:58.037 --> 00:03:01.231
I wanna show you how to
open it in your browser.

45
00:03:01.231 --> 00:03:04.605
So I have my browser open,
this works with Chrome or

46
00:03:04.605 --> 00:03:07.825
this works with, well,
basically any of them.

47
00:03:07.825 --> 00:03:12.758
I'm going to hit File,
Open File, or Cmd + O.

48
00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:14.413
That's usually what I do, I'm going
to find it, which is on my desktop.

49
00:03:14.413 --> 00:03:22.743
I'm gonna go FEM, I'm gonna go to
index.html and I'm gonna say Open.

50
00:03:22.743 --> 00:03:28.322
So you open it just like you would a word
document, but you do it with your browser.

51
00:03:28.322 --> 00:03:36.092
Normally you go to http:// with
this it's going to be file:///.

52
00:03:36.092 --> 00:03:41.216
What's happening here is your
computer is acting like a server.

53
00:03:41.216 --> 00:03:44.958
So your computer is acting like
a server and serving itself.

54
00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.266
Your file system is basically a server.

55
00:03:47.266 --> 00:03:50.478
That's what's going on behind the server,

56
00:03:50.478 --> 00:03:55.557
like literally your browser is making
requests to your same computer.

57
00:03:55.557 --> 00:03:57.272
That's how that works.

58
00:03:57.272 --> 00:03:59.746
So yeah, make sure you have this open.

59
00:03:59.746 --> 00:04:07.310
And then, if I come in here and
change this to say omg, like that.

60
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.444
And I save it, then I come over here.

61
00:04:09.444 --> 00:04:14.710
And if I hit Cmd + R, it'll refresh
the page and I can see my changes.

62
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.642
So you can kind of do
that rapid iteration.

63
00:04:17.642 --> 00:04:22.055
Same thing,
if you wanna create your index.css.

64
00:04:22.055 --> 00:04:24.034
I'm gonna come in here to this.

65
00:04:24.034 --> 00:04:28.974
I'm gonna create a new
file by hitting Cmd+N,

66
00:04:28.974 --> 00:04:32.072
I'm gonna say styles.css.

67
00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:34.361
Again there's no reason it
has to been called that.

68
00:04:38.223 --> 00:04:41.519
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna
put a new link tag in here.

69
00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:44.273
So the nice thing again about code is
I don't have to remember everything.

70
00:04:44.273 --> 00:04:49.576
I can just type link and then if I hit
tab it just generates a link tag for

71
00:04:49.576 --> 00:04:51.511
me which is really nice.

72
00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:57.059
This is called Emmet, this is available
in Sublime and other things, E-M-M-E-T.

73
00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:57.933
I'm not gonna show you how to do it.

74
00:04:57.933 --> 00:05:02.437
In fact there's a course on it from
Mike North on Frontend Masters.

75
00:05:02.437 --> 00:05:05.431
I feel like I haven't plugged
Frontend Masters enough today so

76
00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:06.567
I'm gonna do it again.

77
00:05:06.567 --> 00:05:07.960
Check that one out.

78
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.694
Anyway so I'm gonna say ./styles.css.

79
00:05:12.694 --> 00:05:18.269
It's gonna save that and
now I'm gonna say h1s have color red,

80
00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:23.028
come back over here,
refresh, now it's red, okay?

81
00:05:23.028 --> 00:05:25.839
I wanted to show you that cycle cuz
I don't want you to be confused about

82
00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:26.897
setting these things up.

83
00:05:26.897 --> 00:05:30.366
I don't really care about that,
I want you to learn the code,

84
00:05:30.366 --> 00:05:32.790
you can figure that other stuff out later.

85
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.141
You are gonna do this,
I suggest taking this one road at a time.

86
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:42.221
The first thing you should do is you
should make the title at the top which

87
00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:46.714
is the new times or whatever you want to
call it the name of your Fake newspaper.

88
00:05:46.714 --> 00:05:51.325
I want you to make a row of stories,
the one on the left and

89
00:05:51.325 --> 00:05:58.117
the one on the right are gonna be 25% and
the one in the middle is gonna be 50%.

90
00:05:58.117 --> 00:06:03.349
There's gonna be an image here in
the middle and these are gonna be titles.

91
00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:05.868
And these are gonna be text right here.

92
00:06:05.868 --> 00:06:08.454
So I would finish all of that first.

93
00:06:08.454 --> 00:06:11.692
So in order to get these to layout
correctly what does that look like to you?

94
00:06:11.692 --> 00:06:15.046
Like what are you gonna
use that we talked about?

95
00:06:15.046 --> 00:06:15.712
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is this the flex?

96
00:06:15.712 --> 00:06:18.421
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah it's gonna be flex,
good job.

97
00:06:18.421 --> 00:06:21.360
And they're the same height so
how are we gonna do that?

98
00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:27.928
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Stretch, maybe?

99
00:06:27.928 --> 00:06:31.952
If, what is it, a line item stretch.

100
00:06:35.326 --> 00:06:42.070
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's how you're
gonna start with that, and let's see.

101
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.953
And then I would finish this
entire top row first, right?

102
00:06:44.953 --> 00:06:49.694
Before you even start on this one, then
on the second row this is gonna be 25%,

103
00:06:49.694 --> 00:06:54.260
this one's going to be 75%, and
I don't really care what the colors are.

104
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.476
Just make these different colors.

105
00:06:55.476 --> 00:07:01.929
But notice that they're equally spaced,
and they're in a column direction, right?

106
00:07:01.929 --> 00:07:05.306
So that was gonna be something
more like flex column, right?

107
00:07:05.306 --> 00:07:12.403
Flex direction column, so other things.

108
00:07:12.403 --> 00:07:17.321
Google everything, [LAUGH] when
you forget it Google it again.

109
00:07:17.321 --> 00:07:19.723
It's not cheating,
it's literally what you're supposed to do.

110
00:07:19.723 --> 00:07:23.916
It's kind of the point,
you are professional Googlers.

111
00:07:23.916 --> 00:07:28.156
So please, please, please Google
everything, itÂ´s not cheating.

112
00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:32.954
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Actually to that point,
I saw a couple of people on Windows having

113
00:07:32.954 --> 00:07:37.240
trouble figuring out how to
open up an HTML file in Chrome.

114
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.831
And I forget even though I use
Windows everyday, so I Googled its and

115
00:07:40.831 --> 00:07:43.677
its Ctrl+O will let you get
into your File Explorer.

116
00:07:43.677 --> 00:07:46.591
That will then let you
open your HTML file.

117
00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:48.588
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, cool, perfect.

118
00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:57.454
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The image, the one that's
being displayed there is from a thing

119
00:07:57.454 --> 00:08:01.848
called PlaceCorgi,
[LAUGH] Which I just love this website.

120
00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:08.556
So they're just random images of corgies,

121
00:08:08.556 --> 00:08:14.006
[LAUGH] that's fantastic, right?

122
00:08:14.006 --> 00:08:21.051
So what this is, remember we were
talking about Lorem Ipsum text?

123
00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:23.068
These are like place for the images, so

124
00:08:23.068 --> 00:08:26.078
instead of like Lorem Ipsum
something it's like images.

125
00:08:26.078 --> 00:08:31.085
So with this you can put a number,
so placecorgi.com/500/300 would be

126
00:08:31.085 --> 00:08:37.285
500 with 300 height, and if you want it
to be 600, then you'll do 600/300 right.

127
00:08:37.285 --> 00:08:41.803
So you just give it dimensions, and it
gives you back in image of a corgi in that

128
00:08:41.803 --> 00:08:46.756
dimension so I wanted it to be more wide
than it is tall, so I gave it 500/300.

129
00:08:46.756 --> 00:08:53.271
That's just useful for
like laying out websites.

130
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:57.501
So that's a good thing to know,
yet the navigation box,

131
00:08:57.501 --> 00:09:01.745
which is this part down here,
that's the hardest part.

132
00:09:01.745 --> 00:09:04.555
So this actually, this uses display flex.

133
00:09:04.555 --> 00:09:06.609
And then inside of it,
it uses display flex again.

134
00:09:06.609 --> 00:09:13.341
So you have like nested display flexes,
that'll be useful to know.

135
00:09:13.341 --> 00:09:15.640
There's a lot of room to
reuse classes on this.

136
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.576
Like you could probably make all
the titles one class, for example, right?

137
00:09:18.576 --> 00:09:23.025
So that's a good thing to keep in mind,
take it one step at a time.

138
00:09:23.025 --> 00:09:27.403
That's actually a big part of
programming just in general.

139
00:09:27.403 --> 00:09:29.985
When you're a programmer they
give you large problems and

140
00:09:29.985 --> 00:09:33.302
the point is to take a very large problem
that you don't know how to solve and

141
00:09:33.302 --> 00:09:36.641
split it into two problems that are
hopefully a little bit easier to solve.

142
00:09:36.641 --> 00:09:39.476
And then break those into smaller problems
and smaller problems until eventually you

143
00:09:39.476 --> 00:09:41.058
arrive at something that's
like I can do that.

144
00:09:41.058 --> 00:09:42.244
I know how to do that.

145
00:09:42.244 --> 00:09:44.970
So break big problems into small problems.

146
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:55.783
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see, so if you see
here I said here's my complete version,

147
00:09:55.783 --> 00:09:57.363
if you click on it.

148
00:09:57.363 --> 00:10:00.637
That's an awesome picture.

149
00:10:00.637 --> 00:10:03.771
You can see how I did it here,
I gave you the complete thing.

150
00:10:03.771 --> 00:10:08.720
You can open the inspector and
say, Inspect Element right here.

151
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.235
The point here, this is not a test, right?

152
00:10:11.235 --> 00:10:15.325
I just want you to learn,
so that's why it's there.

153
00:10:15.325 --> 00:10:19.523
You can see here everything is all there.

154
00:10:19.523 --> 00:10:22.670
Personally, for me, the way that I learn,
I need to struggle.

155
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:28.856
So I would not first do this, but if you
get stuck and you're just frustrated,

156
00:10:28.856 --> 00:10:33.662
and about to throw your computer
against the wall, don't.

157
00:10:33.662 --> 00:10:37.197
Don't do this right now,
you should probably take an hour off and

158
00:10:37.197 --> 00:10:38.427
breathe a little bit.

159
00:10:38.427 --> 00:10:42.743
But after that, just take it easy.

160
00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:46.258
Do what's best for you and your learning
style, that's what I wanna say.

161
00:10:49.818 --> 00:10:51.992
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
you can cheat, that's fine.

162
00:10:51.992 --> 00:10:55.395
How I solved it is not the correct answer,
that's what I wanted to say.

163
00:10:55.395 --> 00:10:58.325
There are so many ways you could do this.

164
00:10:58.325 --> 00:11:02.772
You could totally do this using floats,
and that's just fine, right?

165
00:11:02.772 --> 00:11:06.906
You could totally do this without
using flex and flex regression column.

166
00:11:06.906 --> 00:11:12.623
It's gonna be a million times easier if
you do it that way, but totally up to you.

167
00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:19.409
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, like saying there's
a correct way is like saying there's

168
00:11:19.409 --> 00:11:22.432
a correct way to write a poem or
a correct way to paint a portrait.

169
00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:26.065
Like there's artistry in here as well.

170
00:11:29.401 --> 00:11:32.097
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And yeah, good luck.

171
00:11:32.097 --> 00:11:34.746
Does anyone have any questions
about the requirements or

172
00:11:34.746 --> 00:11:37.019
anything that we've talked
about at all today?

173
00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:39.240
Okay, thank you for
attending the first day.

174
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.256
You survived,like that's a big deal.

175
00:11:41.256 --> 00:11:45.443
You're 50% done, and you have
learned two of the three languages.

176
00:11:45.443 --> 00:11:50.312
We are done with HTML and CSS,
this is like your HTML and CSS capstone.

177
00:11:50.312 --> 00:11:56.976
So you learned two languages today,
which is pretty damn cool and not easy.

178
00:11:56.976 --> 00:11:58.993
You can seriously feel
pretty good about yourself.

179
00:11:58.993 --> 00:12:02.258
This is difficult stuff that
you have accomplished here.

180
00:12:02.258 --> 00:12:05.959
So, one, I'm proud of you for
sticking with it,

181
00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:10.730
[LAUGH] and, two, you just have
to learn one language tomorrow.
