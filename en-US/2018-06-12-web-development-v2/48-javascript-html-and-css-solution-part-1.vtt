00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.150
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We are gonna do
a Java Scripts, HTML, CSS project.

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.300
The calculator, this is difficult by
the way, this is not an easy thing to do.

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.910
I purposely gave you something
that was a little difficult,

4
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.819
working through a calculator involves
thinking through how a calculator works.

5
00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:22.551
So, you have this object,
you've used it in your entire life, and

6
00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:24.350
now you have to deconstruct it.

7
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.883
What is actually happening, how is this
like mechanically-logically working?

8
00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:32.628
So that's on purpose,
it's a useful exercise, so

9
00:00:32.628 --> 00:00:35.530
definitely make sure you give it a shot.

10
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.060
So first let's do the HTML, and
CSS, and JavaScript, parts of it.

11
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:50.132
So I'm gonna close that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

12
00:00:50.132 --> 00:00:52.140
we're gonna open a new file.

13
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.130
So a new folder.

14
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.100
It's gonna be called calculator.

15
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:07.302
And I'm gonna open this with VS Code.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

16
00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:10.197
first thing I need to do,
is I need an index.html.

17
00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:15.664
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Inside of calculator,

18
00:01:15.664 --> 00:01:17.640
index.html.

19
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:26.345
Okay I'm gonna do html:5, cuz I'm lazy.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

20
00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:31.600
this is going to be a calculator,
something like that, okay?

21
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.390
So, let's see how I.

22
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.770
I actually do it just
have it up here because,

23
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.410
there's no way I can
write this from memory.

24
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.120
So, first thing I'm gonna do
up here is I'm gonna write

25
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.650
a link tag to get ./calculator.css.

26
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.840
I'm gonna do just a div for
the whole thing called calc.

27
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.800
So that's gonna be,
everything's gonna be inside of this.

28
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.078
I'm gonna do a section for

29
00:02:06.078 --> 00:02:11.431
the screen.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

30
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:13.810
I'm just gonna make that
0 to start out with.

31
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.407
Then I'm gonna do a section for

32
00:02:18.407 --> 00:02:24.470
the calc buttons
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm

33
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.915
gonna do three different, or,
how many rows do I have here, four?

34
00:02:29.915 --> 00:02:38.447
Five rows, so
inside of here I'm gonna do .calc row,

35
00:02:38.447 --> 00:02:42.718
I'm gonna do four of them.

36
00:02:42.718 --> 00:02:48.850
And inside that, well,
let's just do that, times 4.

37
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.883
Well, this actually would be very useful.

38
00:02:50.883 --> 00:02:53.630
So, with this Emmet shorthand
that I'm showing you,

39
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.090
you can actually put things
inside of it as well.

40
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.118
So if you put the arrow, remember how
we did the Lawren Epson text before.

41
00:03:00.118 --> 00:03:04.761
Inside of that I'm gonna put
some buttons with a calc-button.

42
00:03:04.761 --> 00:03:07.388
And I'm gonna put four
of those in each row as

43
00:03:07.388 --> 00:03:11.983
well.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

44
00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:14.910
you can see here this generates
quite a bit of HTML for you.

45
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.888
It's really nice that I don't
have to keep copying and

46
00:03:16.888 --> 00:03:19.120
pasting this over and over again.

47
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.770
You do not have to learn Emmet, but for

48
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.030
me this is really fast cuz I can generate
a bunch of stuff really quickly.

49
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.920
The top row only needs three buttons.

50
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.120
And the bottom row only needs two buttons.

51
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.220
The reason being, if you remember,
where is my screen.

52
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.710
Right, three buttons for
this one, this is a double.

53
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:52.150
And three buttons for that one.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, let's go over here.

54
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.210
So the first one on this
one's gonna be a double.

55
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.150
And this one on the bottom is a triple.

56
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.630
Yeah, call that one a triple.

57
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.500
Okay, we'll go through each one of these.

58
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.190
And just do, that's a capital C for clear.

59
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.299
If you hit, on Mac, at least,
Ctrl+Command+Space,

60
00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.450
it'll bring up a selector thing so
you can select what you need.

61
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.050
I need the left arrow, right?

62
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.297
I need a left arrow.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

63
00:04:28.297 --> 00:04:30.530
I'm gonna scroll and find the left arrow.

64
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.920
And I double click on that, and
it inserts that here into my HTML, so

65
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.890
now I have a left arrow.

66
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.560
And this is gonna be a divide sign,
so I need to get a divide sign.

67
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.440
Or a division sign, rather.

68
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.316
So there's a division sign.

69
00:04:46.316 --> 00:04:50.504
7, 8,

70
00:04:50.504 --> 00:04:56.640
9, and then a multiplication sign,
which you could just put an x there.

71
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.850
That's actually not a real
multiplication sign.

72
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.358
That is a real multiplication sign, so

73
00:05:02.358 --> 00:05:07.314
we're going to put that in there.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then 4, 5, 6.

74
00:05:07.314 --> 00:05:13.450
4, 5, 6, and then a minus.

75
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.366
And then lastly we wanna put 0 as
the triple button, and then an equal sign.

76
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.503
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's all of our HTML.

77
00:05:25.503 --> 00:05:30.388
If we go, and let's open this and

78
00:05:30.388 --> 00:05:35.130
open calculator index.html.

79
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.220
Pretty cool little calculator.

80
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.240
Little tiny thing up there.

81
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.940
So let's go do some HTML and
CSS, see what that looks like.

82
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.468
We can bring in the CSS here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

83
00:05:50.468 --> 00:05:53.720
leave that up and come over here.

84
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.740
Make a new file.

85
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.342
Calculator.css.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And,

86
00:06:01.342 --> 00:06:04.160
first thing we do,
I'm gonna put that box size in border-box.

87
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.437
That's gonna be really helpful
in this particular case.

88
00:06:07.437 --> 00:06:11.388
Border-box, then I'm gonna do body,

89
00:06:11.388 --> 00:06:16.626
then I'm gonna do padding:0; and
margin:0;.

90
00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:20.370
Body by default has some padding against
the side, and didn't really want that,

91
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.430
so we are getting rid of that.

92
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:28.030
For .calc I made it width 400 pixels,
and just had a fixed width.

93
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.280
Background color.

94
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.200
Just made that a straight black.

95
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.560
And color, white, okay?

96
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.380
So that's gonna cover
all of our font needs.

97
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:49.109
For the screen, font size 40 pixels.

98
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.090
Some size.

99
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.440
You could probably make it even
a little bit bigger if you wanted to.

100
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.320
Font-family.

101
00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.030
I'm going to just use one of them
that the VS Code has for me.

102
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.010
There's one that it has with Courier New.

103
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.770
So the top one here.

104
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.592
So it's going to be Courier New, Courier,
and if it doesn't find that either,

105
00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:12.265
it's just gonna give up and do monospace
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there's three or

106
00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:17.700
four of them that you can guarantee
the browser has, for sure.

107
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:23.000
There's font-family, there's serif,
it will definitely have a serif font.

108
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.821
There's sans-serif,

109
00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:31.076
monospace,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cursive.

110
00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:34.906
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I can't remember,

111
00:07:34.906 --> 00:07:37.050
there might be a couple more.

112
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.810
Really, it's monospace,
serif, and sans serif.

113
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:47.520
Those are the ones you have to care about.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Text-align, right.

114
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.020
Cuz you want it to be right-aligned,
right?

115
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.810
If that makes sense.

116
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:55.130
Padding, I want 20 pixels on top and
5 pixels on the side.

117
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.590
So, that will be good for the screen.

118
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:04.056
So let's see how we are at so far.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Getting there,

119
00:08:04.056 --> 00:08:07.544
right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This looks

120
00:08:07.544 --> 00:08:10.997
correct.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

121
00:08:10.997 --> 00:08:19.578
now we do the calc buttons.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Calc-button,

122
00:08:21.849 --> 00:08:23.163
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: background-color.

123
00:08:26.503 --> 00:08:28.834
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I just grabbed something

124
00:08:28.834 --> 00:08:33.389
off the internet of how
it is actually d8d9db.

125
00:08:37.723 --> 00:08:38.527
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is that correct?

126
00:08:38.527 --> 00:08:41.556
d8d9db that's what I got, okay.

127
00:08:41.556 --> 00:08:48.171
color: black; height: 100px; width: 24.5%;

128
00:08:48.171 --> 00:08:55.044
the reason why we're doing
24.5% is we want that little,

129
00:08:55.044 --> 00:08:59.860
tiny black gutter.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: border: none,

130
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:06.553
you have to remove borders from buttons.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: border-radius,

131
00:09:06.553 --> 00:09:11.930
we also change that to 0,
border-radius is rounding corners.

132
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:18.039
If you give it like a 5 pixels, it will
have like a 5 pixel radius at the corners.

133
00:09:18.039 --> 00:09:20.990
Buttons by default, have a little bit
of rounding at the top of it, and

134
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.490
we're trying to get rid of that,
cuz we want it to be nice and

135
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:29.176
square.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: font-size: 40px;,

136
00:09:29.176 --> 00:09:31.910
cursor: pointer;.

137
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:38.608
So let's show you what that is,
okay, this looks nice.

138
00:09:38.608 --> 00:09:41.434
So, notice this has no random corner and

139
00:09:41.434 --> 00:09:45.770
notice my miles when I over
the button it changes to a pointer.

140
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.856
That's how you let people know this
is a clickable thing, right, and

141
00:09:49.856 --> 00:09:50.891
that's what you want.

142
00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:53.869
You want people to think like,
you want them to look at that and say,

143
00:09:53.869 --> 00:09:55.330
I can click on that.

144
00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.578
And so that pointer is just like little
indication with over is like, okay,

145
00:09:58.578 --> 00:09:59.962
cool, yeah I can click on that.

146
00:09:59.962 --> 00:10:04.329
So just a little helpful thing for people
to recognize that they can click on it.

147
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.188
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

148
00:10:08.188 --> 00:10:15.812
calc-button:hover.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

149
00:10:15.812 --> 00:10:19.799
we're just gonna change the background
color a little bit color.

150
00:10:19.799 --> 00:10:22.777
When people hover over things,
you make it just a little bit lighter as

151
00:10:22.777 --> 00:10:25.737
well.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

152
00:10:25.737 --> 00:10:29.052
this will as well make them think
that they can click on it, right?

153
00:10:29.052 --> 00:10:32.571
That's probably really subtle and a little
hard for you to see on the projector but

154
00:10:32.571 --> 00:10:35.937
I guarantee you it is changing colors
here, at least decently enough that I can

155
00:10:35.937 --> 00:10:42.199
tell.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay calc button:active,

156
00:10:42.199 --> 00:10:46.822
active is what happens
when it's pushed down.

157
00:10:46.822 --> 00:10:49.626
You wanna make it darker so people know
that they're pushing something down.

158
00:10:56.485 --> 00:10:58.447
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: bbbcbe.

159
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.968
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so now if I come over

160
00:11:02.968 --> 00:11:06.687
here and push, maybe I'll see that it
gets a little bit that it gets darker.

161
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.228
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So something like this,

162
00:11:18.228 --> 00:11:23.146
you wanna be really careful that you
choose colors with high contrast, right?

163
00:11:23.146 --> 00:11:27.321
So if I do came in here and
say color white, just to make an example.

164
00:11:32.842 --> 00:11:33.886
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can't see that,

165
00:11:33.886 --> 00:11:35.175
at all, can you?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No.

166
00:11:35.175 --> 00:11:36.007
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, I can see

167
00:11:36.007 --> 00:11:40.359
it a little bit, to the point that it's
mostly readable on my screen right here,

168
00:11:40.359 --> 00:11:43.047
but this is an excellent
example of why having high

169
00:11:43.047 --> 00:11:48.075
contrast is very important because on
that screen, you really can't tell.

170
00:11:48.075 --> 00:11:50.267
So there's a standard called AA,

171
00:11:50.267 --> 00:11:54.432
it's put out by the government
of Ontario if I'm not mistaking.

172
00:11:54.432 --> 00:11:57.932
But pretty much the whole internet adheres
to the systemic cuz it's really good.

173
00:11:57.932 --> 00:12:02.332
You wanna have a certain amount of
contrast between your colors so

174
00:12:02.332 --> 00:12:07.299
that people that have some sort of
disability with color can still see it.

175
00:12:07.299 --> 00:12:13.326
So, there's plenty of things on
the Internet they say like I said,

176
00:12:13.326 --> 00:12:18.540
just search for like,
AA access, or A11Y so, colors.

177
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.430
A11Y stands for accessibility,

178
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:26.640
the reason why it's that is there
is A then eleven letters and Y.

179
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.520
I don't wanna write accessibility
cuz I spell it wrong every time.

180
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.420
So that's why they write A11Y,
so color contrast checker,

181
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.970
this one works fine.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then so

182
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:43.414
you can see here for normal text, blue on
white passes but if I go too light, so you

183
00:12:43.414 --> 00:12:49.296
can see that it fails right about there.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this right here, believe

184
00:12:49.296 --> 00:12:53.378
it or not fails accessibility, it's
pretty readable even right there, right?

185
00:12:53.378 --> 00:12:57.617
But someone that had certain types of,
like,

186
00:12:57.617 --> 00:13:04.380
color blindness might not be able to
read that very well, so that's why.

187
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:09.090
There's triple A, triple A is a little
bit more strict than double A,

188
00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:14.290
for the most part, most people do not do
triple A, usually double A is plenty.

189
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:19.248
And notice that this still passes, so if
we had this color and it was large text,

190
00:13:19.248 --> 00:13:20.366
it still passes.

191
00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:23.285
So you get a little bit more leeway
the larger the text is, just so

192
00:13:23.285 --> 00:13:28.030
you know.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Always check this,

193
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.481
always do this, it's the responsible,

194
00:13:30.481 --> 00:13:34.116
ethical thing to do.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

195
00:13:34.116 --> 00:13:36.464
this is not responsible nor ethical.

196
00:13:36.464 --> 00:13:40.365
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

197
00:13:40.365 --> 00:13:45.234
let's go back to black.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now you

198
00:13:45.234 --> 00:13:50.308
might say like well the change from hover
is not really that big of a difference,

199
00:13:50.308 --> 00:13:54.020
someone that's colorblind
might not be able to see that,

200
00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:59.200
that's like more okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

201
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.890
it's not gonna prevent
someone from using the site.

202
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.490
Someone not being able to read something,
that prevents someone from reading

203
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:12.034
the site or using the site rather.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

204
00:14:12.034 --> 00:14:17.313
double,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I did some guessing and

205
00:14:17.313 --> 00:14:21.046
checking I'm gonna save you that process,
but

206
00:14:21.046 --> 00:14:26.473
this width ends up being 49.7% to
get the right kind of margins.

207
00:14:26.473 --> 00:14:30.767
And then triple ended up being

208
00:14:30.767 --> 00:14:35.416
width 74.8%, 74.8%

209
00:14:42.655 --> 00:14:48.866
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

210
00:14:48.866 --> 00:14:51.733
now we need to get these so
that they're on the same

211
00:14:51.733 --> 00:14:57.182
line.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Where's my

212
00:14:57.182 --> 00:15:03.939
flex on this?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's

213
00:15:03.939 --> 00:15:07.629
down further.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, let's just put that on

214
00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:14.344
right now, we're gonna put,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: calc-button-raw,

215
00:15:14.344 --> 00:15:20.067
and this is gonna be display: flex.

216
00:15:20.067 --> 00:15:24.660
align-content: stretch,
cuz we want them to be the same height.

217
00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:28.564
That's actually not gonna do anything
cuz they all have heights anyway but,

218
00:15:28.564 --> 00:15:30.556
nonetheless we're gonna do stretch.

219
00:15:30.556 --> 00:15:34.310
justify content: space-between, right?

220
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.017
Because we want it to go all
the way to the edges and

221
00:15:36.017 --> 00:15:40.231
then have all the gutters in the middle.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

222
00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:44.317
margin-bottom to be about 0.5%.

223
00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:55.545
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: calc-row is what I called

224
00:15:55.545 --> 00:16:00.208
it, I'm sorry.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay that got a little bit

225
00:16:00.208 --> 00:16:01.740
more dense, it's what we wanted.

226
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.518
It's starting to look more and

227
00:16:04.518 --> 00:16:11.820
more what we want it to look like.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We did that, we did that.

228
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.280
So the last thing that we're gonna do
up here where we did all the colors,

229
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.085
this one right here.

230
00:16:17.085 --> 00:16:22.601
[COUGH] So we want to change calc-button,

231
00:16:22.601 --> 00:16:29.070
but we wanna change the last one of them,
right?

232
00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:30.700
The last one in the row to be orange,
right?

233
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.552
So, how is this nice effect of everything
being orange on this last row.

234
00:16:34.552 --> 00:16:38.963
And so we're gonna use last-child, right?

235
00:16:38.963 --> 00:16:43.870
We want that background color
to be more of an orangey color.

236
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:48.747
So, that's gonna be df974c,

237
00:16:48.747 --> 00:16:53.464
and that's a nice orange color.

238
00:16:56.014 --> 00:16:58.100
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, right?

239
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:03.280
Just so you know, this does have a color
picker, how do you get it to come up?

240
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.930
I think you just hover it,
yeah, there you go.

241
00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.750
So you can actually just mess
with the color picker right here.

242
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:10.003
This is something that's built
into code but that's really nice,

243
00:17:10.003 --> 00:17:14.730
right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Something else is you can

244
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.838
combine these pseudo elements or
pseudo classes rather.

245
00:17:17.838 --> 00:17:22.521
So a calc-button:last-child, and
then I can do :hover as well,

246
00:17:22.521 --> 00:17:24.830
to get the hover effect.

247
00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:27.461
And I'm just gonna make that a little
bit lighter for the same reasons.

248
00:17:27.461 --> 00:17:35.588
So background color dfb07e,

249
00:17:35.588 --> 00:17:39.804
hit that pound.

250
00:17:39.804 --> 00:17:42.770
We also wanted to make the color
white here, color, white.

251
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:51.085
And gonna give it a darker one as well for

252
00:17:51.085 --> 00:17:56.279
calc-button:last child:active.

253
00:17:56.279 --> 00:18:01.243
And that background color,
it's gonna be a little bit darker.

254
00:18:01.243 --> 00:18:10.914
It's gonna be dd8d37.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So refreshing,

255
00:18:10.914 --> 00:18:14.480
now if you hover, you can probably see
that it gets a little bit lighter.

256
00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:20.260
If you push on it, it gets darker.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, right?

257
00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.980
Another note on accessibility.

258
00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.800
Notice when I click on this,
there's a little blue glow around it.

259
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.530
People try to remove this,

260
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:32.630
there is a CSS property to remove,
this is called appearance.

261
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:35.510
Don't and never, never do that.

262
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.980
The reason why is because when
people are tabbing around your site.

263
00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.310
So I'm hitting tab right now and moving,
you can see the blue outline moving.

264
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:46.070
People that can't use mice
have to do it this way.

265
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.450
This is how they move around the site.

266
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:51.810
And so if you say appearance none,
they can't tell where they are, right?

267
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:54.800
So even though you find that like it
doesn't fill in with your aesthetic or

268
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.430
whatever, you should never,
never remove it.

269
00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:00.264
And if anyone tells you to remove it,
throw your laptop at them.

270
00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:03.233
That's effective.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

271
00:19:03.233 --> 00:19:07.936
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So yeah, that's effective.

272
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:11.965
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so

273
00:19:11.965 --> 00:19:15.680
now we have this nicely
laid out calculator.

274
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:20.608
With all the gutters are looking nice.

275
00:19:20.608 --> 00:19:24.498
It's kinda well spaced out,
everything kinda fits together, and

276
00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:27.580
nothing I showedyou here is revolutionary,
right?

277
00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:32.040
It's all just a combination of various
things that I've taught you already.

278
00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:36.403
Now, if it wasn't immediately apparent
to you how to solve this problem,

279
00:19:36.403 --> 00:19:37.104
that's okay.

280
00:19:37.104 --> 00:19:39.582
Because I've shown you a bunch
of different tools, and

281
00:19:39.582 --> 00:19:42.810
I really haven't much shown you how
all the tools work together yet.

282
00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.070
This is very much a bunch of properties
working together to create this

283
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.290
synthetic hole.

284
00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:51.130
And that just comes from
doing it lots of times, okay?

285
00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:52.870
So this is just practice.

286
00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:59.640
But, if I'm you in your position,
it's pretty cool you can sit there and

287
00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:04.790
think as I have the tools,
I know how to do there, I can get this.

288
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:08.970
I just have to do a little bit more
experience before I figure out

289
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.810
how I can put the things that I know
together to get this sort of things.

290
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:19.285
Okay, so that's it for our CSS.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

291
00:20:19.285 --> 00:20:23.207
what we're gonna do now is
we're going to come in and

292
00:20:23.207 --> 00:20:26.855
do the JavaScripts.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can I ask a question really

293
00:20:26.855 --> 00:20:30.350
quick?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Please.

294
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:33.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What part of the calculator

295
00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:37.730
does the double and
the triple affect with the percentages,

296
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.230
what can you do?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This one's a double right,

297
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.070
so it's a double wide button, and

298
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:46.000
this is triple wide.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay and then, okay so

299
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.590
you just instead of,
is there a way to tell it to say hey,

300
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:56.620
wherever the 6 ends for example,
that's where we want the 0 to end?

301
00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:01.740
Or is this we can do here?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes, that's called grid.

302
00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:06.050
And so that's the new technique that you
can basically say I have this grid that's

303
00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:12.640
that would be like a four by four grid,
right, four by four?

304
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.990
Four by four grid, right?

305
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:20.070
And inside of that grid I want this
one to take up 2 at the top left, and

306
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:25.490
you just kind of laid out how you would
lay out a spreadsheet, pretty much.

307
00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:28.220
And then, it will just kind of
lay itself out like a rigid grid.

308
00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.070
So that's how I would
definitely use a grid for that.

309
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.050
For using Flex, you can also try and

310
00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:40.090
use the Flex number system
that I was showing you before.

311
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:42.710
It's hard to get that to line
out on a hard grid like this.

312
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.110
It's really important that
these gutters line up,

313
00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.130
otherwise it looks really strange.

314
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:51.746
So that's why I'm using
hard percentages of width.

315
00:21:51.746 --> 00:21:53.320
Does that answer your question?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Mm-hm.

316
