00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Overview of what
you'll be learning in this course.

2
00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:08.610
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: A large part of what
you're gonna be learning today is just

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.553
terminology, and I'm trying to strip
away the ones that you don't need,

4
00:00:12.553 --> 00:00:17.058
like there's some in here like monads, and
functors, and I know some alumni is gonna

5
00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:22.680
be super pissed off that I'm making fun of
functional programming, but I don't care.

6
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.540
I'm sure I've already
pissed them off before.

7
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.490
There's stuff like that
you can just ignore.

8
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.170
It's just high and mighty computer science
terminology that actually is not going

9
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.030
to serve you too much in your day to day.

10
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.770
What I'm trying to distill this down to is
words that you need today to be able to

11
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.830
search for the answers that you need.

12
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.700
So that's why you're gonna need to know
things like HTML tags, and functions, and

13
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.320
scope, because that actually is
gonna serve you really well when

14
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.940
you're trying to solve a problem.

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.770
And that's a big problem with computer
science in general is people want to use

16
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.398
the most technically accurate term,
like there's a framer called Angular

17
00:00:59.398 --> 00:01:04.388
that's quite well known for this,
that they'll use things like transclusion,

18
00:01:04.388 --> 00:01:09.304
which is, yes, that perfectly describes
what they're doing, but most people

19
00:01:09.304 --> 00:01:14.334
don't actually understand what that means,
which means it's worthless to me.

20
00:01:14.334 --> 00:01:16.907
So I'm trying to not use terms like that,
and

21
00:01:16.907 --> 00:01:21.648
I'm trying to give you the best terms to
be able to solve your problems, but again,

22
00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:25.849
if I use a term that you don't understand
I guarantee you that someone else

23
00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:30.301
doesn't understand, and so you should
definitely stop me and ask about it.

24
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:35.138
So let's see, a good limus test, if you
should understand the term, like if you

25
00:01:35.138 --> 00:01:39.835
should spend the time, if you repeatedly
hear it in whatever you're doing you

26
00:01:39.835 --> 00:01:44.459
should probably look it up, but if you
see a term that you don't understand,

27
00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.154
at least the first or second time, you
can probably just ignore it and move on,

28
00:01:49.154 --> 00:01:51.189
at least that's how I handle it.

29
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.360
Something else, you're going to have
to learn three languages today,

30
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.470
which is cool, I think [LAUGH].

31
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.470
It's like going into your language class,
it's like, by the way,

32
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.430
you're going to learn Japanese, German,
and Italian today, so buckle up.

33
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.309
[LAUGH] Hopefully it's a little bit easier
than that, but we're going to learn HTML,

34
00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:15.680
CSS, and JavaScript.

35
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.410
Luckily two of those
are kind of considered like

36
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.870
they're not programming languages,
because they don't actually execute,

37
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.330
they don't run, you can think of them more
like English that they're declarative

38
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.270
in the sense that you kind
of state what you mean, and

39
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.040
it's like English, but you can run
English, you just like say English, right?

40
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.530
And that's what HTML and CSS are,
they're not run languages,

41
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.660
they're just, you're stating something,
and then a computer later is

42
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.250
interpreting what you stated, right,
whereas JavaScript is actually

43
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.680
a full-fledge programming language that
you run, you run JavaScript, right.

44
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.823
If that doesn't make total sense right
now, when we kind of get into those,

45
00:02:58.823 --> 00:03:02.579
hopefully that'll make a bit more sense,
but just know that HTML and

46
00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.274
CSS are declared languages where
you're just stating something,

47
00:03:06.274 --> 00:03:10.003
whereas JavaScript you're telling
the computer to do something.

48
00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:15.857
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and then we'll
also go over the command line and

49
00:03:15.857 --> 00:03:20.250
how to use git, and
we'll talk about that when we get there.

50
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.410
That'll definitely be tomorrow.

51
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.137
So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sure I covered

52
00:03:27.137 --> 00:03:28.606
everything I wanted to talk about.

53
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.727
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I wanna make an analogy,
and I'm gonna reference this analogy

54
00:03:35.727 --> 00:03:39.900
a lot during this course, and
that's the analogy of building a house.

55
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.272
If you're thinking that
your website is a house,

56
00:03:44.272 --> 00:03:48.329
right, then we can kind of use HTML,
CSS, and

57
00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:53.241
JavaScript to kind of describe
the various parts of it.

58
00:03:53.241 --> 00:03:57.650
So you can think of HTML as,
like, the raw building material.

59
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.990
It's the drywall, it's the 2x4s,
it's the frame of the house.

60
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.225
In and of itself, if I just take
a bunch of lumber to a lot and

61
00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:10.080
just leave it there,
it's not a very good house.

62
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.300
Despite the fact that you have
everything to make a house,

63
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.055
you need to make the house.

64
00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:19.766
[LAUGH] You can't just leave
the building materials there and

65
00:04:19.766 --> 00:04:21.805
expect it to be a website.

66
00:04:21.805 --> 00:04:23.257
So that's kind of what html is.

67
00:04:23.257 --> 00:04:26.703
It's all the raw building materials and
then you're going to use CSS and

68
00:04:26.703 --> 00:04:29.440
JavaScript to kind of
put the house together.

69
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.601
So think of html as the raw
building materials.

70
00:04:32.601 --> 00:04:36.020
You can think of CSS more as
like blueprints for the house.

71
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.690
It's a bunch of rules that you use to
describe where you want things to go.

72
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.010
So I want this 2x4 to go on the south
wall, I want this one to go on the north

73
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.800
wall, I want these ones to go on the roof,
and things like that, so it's a bunch

74
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.460
of rules that describe what you
want the house to be organized as,

75
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.810
and what you want the colors to be and
those sorts of things.

76
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.793
So the CSS is the blueprints of the house,

77
00:05:01.793 --> 00:05:06.666
it's where everything is laid out,
it's where everything goes.

78
00:05:06.666 --> 00:05:09.359
It's both the layout and the style.

79
00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:11.301
So it's like what wallpaper's
gonna go on the walls.

80
00:05:11.301 --> 00:05:13.860
It's gonna be those sorts of things.

81
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.807
So it's the stylistic presentation
of your website is what CSS does.

82
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:26.390
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then lastly, so
you have the whole house together.

83
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.309
You can actually just stop
there with HTML and CSS.

84
00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:33.650
If your website doesn't have any really
interaction with it, like if you're just

85
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.990
making a website that describes events
happening at your local community center,

86
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.610
there's not really much
interaction with that.

87
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.451
It's basically like a flyer that
you've put online, [LAUGH] right,

88
00:05:45.451 --> 00:05:49.637
or a PDF, right,
that you've just put up on the Internet.

89
00:05:49.637 --> 00:05:51.570
You can stop there.

90
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.761
HTML and CSS is enough to make just that.

91
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:59.200
However, if you want anything to be
interactive with your website you need

92
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.934
JavaScript, that's the programing
language of the web, and

93
00:06:02.934 --> 00:06:06.606
I would kind make the analogy of
that being like a smart house.

94
00:06:06.606 --> 00:06:11.737
What if you wanted to drive your car into
your driveway, have the garage open,

95
00:06:11.737 --> 00:06:16.710
and the thermostat turn, on and it makes
you a cup of coffee, I don't know,

96
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.375
something like that, you would make
a bunch of programmatic things.

97
00:06:21.375 --> 00:06:24.364
Like, if this happens then do this,
and do this, and do this.

98
00:06:24.364 --> 00:06:29.580
Like once I do this thing, a bunch of
other things should happen, right.

99
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.001
That's kind of the smart house mentality,
and

100
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:34.372
that's kind of what JavaScript does for
you.

101
00:06:34.372 --> 00:06:37.290
You're kind of making
your website reactive.

102
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:42.210
So if the user clicks this button then
send this request over here and show them

103
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.130
this dialog, and gather this information
from them, and show them this image.

104
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.872
So it's kind of all these kind of
interactions that are happening and

105
00:06:50.872 --> 00:06:53.397
that's what JavaScript is gonna buy for
you.

106
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.352
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

107
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.362
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So yes you can make
website with zero JavaScript, however,

108
00:07:07.362 --> 00:07:11.258
most sites on the web now,
almost everything is using JavaScript.

109
00:07:11.258 --> 00:07:16.006
So you don't necessarily have
to have a smart home, but

110
00:07:16.006 --> 00:07:20.957
these days almost everything
does have JavaScript on it,

111
00:07:20.957 --> 00:07:24.709
so it is more common
than being a smart home.

112
00:07:24.709 --> 00:07:29.012
Lastly, we're gonna talk a little
bit about servers at the end.

113
00:07:29.012 --> 00:07:32.730
We're gonna work with
something called node JS,

114
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.810
which is a server side
programming using JavaScript.

115
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:42.443
So some of you might have heard of things
like Python, or Ruby, or Java, or Go, or

116
00:07:42.443 --> 00:07:45.964
C#, these are languages that you're
going to write on the server.

117
00:07:45.964 --> 00:07:48.280
We're not going to learn
any of those things.

118
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.970
One, cuz you definitely don't wanna
learn those things from me, [LAUGH] and

119
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.700
two, this is front-end masters, so
we're gonna work with JavaScript, and

120
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.980
the nice thing about working with
node is node is still JavaScript.

121
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.960
So, we're going to be running
JavaScript inside of your browser,

122
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.587
which is like the client side code,
that's the smart home kind of stuff, and

123
00:08:06.587 --> 00:08:08.870
then we're also going to be
running it on the server, and

124
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.580
you can think of the server like
the pizza place in your neighborhood.

125
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.460
So, you have a bunch of different houses,
a bunch of different like

126
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.310
people that are browsing your website
all calling into the one pizza place.

127
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:27.400
So one server serves multiple clients,
or multiple browsers, and phones,

128
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:33.280
and things like that, and you think when
you want a pizza, you pick up your phone,

129
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.560
you call them, you ask for something,
and then they send you something.

130
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.790
That's kind of the request response

131
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:44.510
cycle of what it's like to
interact with this server.

132
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.303
So that's kind of what the pizza place is.

133
00:08:50.303 --> 00:08:55.170
So to recap here, I just wrote it
down if you missed some of that.

134
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.810
HTML's the structure.

135
00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:02.710
It's going to contain all the texts, the
images, kind of just like the raw content.

136
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.650
Mostly it's gonna be text,
text and structuring.

137
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.580
The CSS is the blueprint.

138
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:14.240
This is gonna be where everything goes,
what color it is, what size it is,

139
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.910
what font it is, what the decorative
background images are, and

140
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.880
like HTML, CSS doesn't do anything
of itself, you're not going to be

141
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.570
executing anything with CSS, you're just
going to be describing what you want.

142
00:09:29.946 --> 00:09:33.760
Then the frontend JavaScript, which is the
JavaScript that is run inside the browser,

143
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.640
it's the stuff that you're,
the smart home stuff.

144
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.430
That's going to be if they click this,
then show them the dialog, or

145
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.560
download this image, or if they scroll
down far enough in their Instagram feed,

146
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.460
then we're going to load
more images at the bottom.

147
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.715
That's gonna be the kind of stuff
that JavaScript is gonna do for

148
00:09:51.715 --> 00:09:52.399
you on the client.

149
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:59.050
And then the backend code, which is
the pizza place, that's going to be,

150
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.720
someone's going to request more images
to show someone in their Instagram feed.

151
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.810
So the pizza place is gonna go in, it's
gonna find everything that the user asks

152
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:09.668
for, and
then it's gonna give it back to them.

153
00:10:09.668 --> 00:10:14.701
So that's gonna be reading from databases,
it's going to be doing server side

154
00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:19.658
calculations, anything that you would
need to centralize into your server,

155
00:10:19.658 --> 00:10:24.464
that's gonna go into that, and
one server's going to serve many clients,

156
00:10:24.464 --> 00:10:27.717
just like one pizza place
serves many households.

157
00:10:29.742 --> 00:10:30.981
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about that?

158
00:10:33.292 --> 00:10:34.140
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes, please.

159
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I still don't understand
why haven't we taken HTML and CSS,

160
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.390
even though they were
created at different times?

161
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.830
Why don't we meld them
both in the JavaScript and

162
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.850
then just use JavaScript for everything?

163
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.470
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question, why
don't we just use JavaScript for anything?

164
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.010
It's a lively debate that we could have.

165
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.650
So there are people doing that actually.

166
00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.370
In fact, one of my other courses,

167
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:06.260
which is Complete Intro to React,
React more or less achieves that.

168
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:11.500
It uses JavaScript to generate HTML,
which is something very common to do,

169
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.980
especially with the modern day
kind of infrastructure, but

170
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.530
right now it's actually really
important for you to understand

171
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:22.570
the primitives that it generates,
so the HTML that it does generate.

172
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.370
It's gonna make you a better programmer.

173
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:31.250
But eventually, I'm not gonna say it's
better, but there are people doing it.

174
00:11:32.733 --> 00:11:34.451
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know if I
have a better answer than that.

175
00:11:34.451 --> 00:11:35.932
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

176
00:11:35.932 --> 00:11:38.410
[LAUGH] that's a good question.

177
00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:42.390
So, a note about this course's website.

178
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.840
If you see a code sample like this
that's on a yellow background,

179
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.520
that's kind of probably hard to see,
but I promise you that it is kind of

180
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.690
a light yellow background there,
this code is not editable.

181
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:57.360
But if you see something like this,
this code is editable,

182
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:04.560
that's hard to say, so if I put like this

183
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:10.510
is super cool you'll see it
actually being used down here.

184
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.092
So I really hope that as
you're following along,

185
00:12:17.444 --> 00:12:18.770
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That you are messing

186
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:19.630
with these.

187
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:24.754
That you're breaking them,
that you're unbreaking them,

188
00:12:24.754 --> 00:12:27.906
and discovering and playing with it,

189
00:12:27.906 --> 00:12:32.535
cuz I think that's gonna
really help instruct you, and

190
00:12:32.535 --> 00:12:37.755
help you understand that if I
make this an h5 instead of an h1,

191
00:12:37.755 --> 00:12:41.819
it makes it look different and
things like that.

192
00:12:41.819 --> 00:12:47.800
So I spent a bunch of time making this
work so you better use it [LAUGH].

193
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.318
That's the sum of my story.

194
00:12:52.716 --> 00:12:56.247
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The one thing that
I will say is that if you break,

195
00:12:56.247 --> 00:13:01.330
if you write something that breaks
in here and it breaks really badly,

196
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:06.010
it might actually crash the webpage,
so just refresh the page.

197
00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:07.710
So that is something that you can do, and

198
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:11.060
if you do refresh the page it's going to
reset everything back to the way it was.

199
00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:15.453
So if you find some code that you're
really happy with and you want to keep,

200
00:13:15.453 --> 00:13:20.057
you should just copy and paste it into
a separate file that you're keeping, so

201
00:13:20.057 --> 00:13:22.037
that would be a good idea as well.

202
00:13:25.566 --> 00:13:27.076
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about that?

203
00:13:32.459 --> 00:13:33.559
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

204
00:13:33.559 --> 00:13:38.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So earlier when you said,
the lighter color we cannot edit it,

205
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.184
it is because of the lighter of the color,
or

206
00:13:41.184 --> 00:13:45.017
is that the background that
make it we can't edit it?

207
00:13:45.017 --> 00:13:47.440
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, that's a good question.

208
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.490
I made it look different so that you
can tell that you can't edit it, and

209
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.040
I did it on purpose,
because some of these things,

210
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.910
if you edit them,
you will definitely crash the webpage.

211
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.905
So it's to protect you from yourself,
or protect you from me,

212
00:14:01.905 --> 00:14:03.558
I think is probably more accurate.

213
00:14:03.558 --> 00:14:07.330
[LAUGH] So
there's no necessary technical reason.

214
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:11.940
It was a reason that I chose
to make it now editable.

215
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.350
Does that answer your question?

216
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:14.484
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

217
00:14:16.105 --> 00:14:17.028
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anyone else?

218
00:14:19.711 --> 00:14:22.224
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Someone
was asking inside that,

219
00:14:22.224 --> 00:14:26.510
what is that code that
you're just editing?

220
00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:28.110
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You're about to find out.

221
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:29.300
Good question.

222
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.080
What is that?

223
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:30.768
I will tell you.

224
00:14:30.768 --> 00:14:31.655
Very soon.

225
00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.384
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And like I'm being cheeky
by saying it that way, but there's a very

226
00:14:38.384 --> 00:14:42.786
deliberate order that these things kind
of build together, and so if we go in too

227
00:14:42.786 --> 00:14:47.410
many diatribes too early we're gonna get
off track, and there is a lot of content.

228
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:51.910
Just so you know, it's insane to try and
learn web development in two days.

229
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.530
It is just a ton of content, right?

230
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.600
So you're gonna kinda have
the firehose pointed at you,

231
00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.936
and sorry, not sorry, a little bit.

232
00:15:01.936 --> 00:15:07.150
[LAUGH] A lot of this is to
expose these things to you,

233
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:11.210
so you kind of understand the things
that you don't understand and

234
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:15.090
this is kind of a theory
that I have a little bit.

235
00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.661
You have what you don't know that you
don't know, and you can't Google or

236
00:15:18.661 --> 00:15:22.744
you can't talk about things that you don't
know that you don't know about, right,

237
00:15:22.744 --> 00:15:25.977
but as soon as these things enter
into this realm that you're like,

238
00:15:25.977 --> 00:15:29.547
I know these things exist, and so
when I go to try and use that, it's like,

239
00:15:29.547 --> 00:15:33.059
I don't know how to use it right now,
but I know how to Google it [LAUGH], and

240
00:15:33.059 --> 00:15:34.809
I think that's really important.

241
00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:38.490
So that's kind of like a big point of
this is to introduce you to these things.

242
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.630
I don't expect you to walk away
understanding all these things 100%.

243
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:46.584
What I expect you to be able to do is that
you would be able to if you needed to do

244
00:15:46.584 --> 00:15:47.770
that, right?

245
00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.600
So I'm exposing you to these concepts so

246
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.410
that you can learn them
more deeply as necessary.

247
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.141
Hopefully that makes some sense.

248
00:15:58.424 --> 00:16:01.088
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if I kind of say
I'm not gonna answer right now,

249
00:16:01.088 --> 00:16:05.339
that's the reason why I'm doing it, is so
I can come back later in the course and

250
00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:07.460
teach you some of these things.

251
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:13.040
The other thing is that a lot of these,
I'm covering this broad range of topics,

252
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.560
and what's nice about Frontend Masters is
they have a lot of like depth into each

253
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.520
one of these.

254
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.680
So, for example, we're going to just
like scratch the surface of git, but

255
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.760
if you want to like deep dive into git,

256
00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.530
there is an advanced git course on here
by Nina Zakharenko that is really good.

257
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.820
So you can check that out later.
