00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.435
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So hopefully this
was a helpful exercise for you.

2
00:00:04.435 --> 00:00:07.810
There's two things I
wanted to shout out to.

3
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.670
Just more resources to get in here,
particularly with Flexbox.

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.016
I think, hopefully, you kinda saw
here the power of Flexbox and

5
00:00:14.016 --> 00:00:15.670
a lot of stuff that you can do with it.

6
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.081
I did fix the problem.

7
00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:19.774
So now this is meeting up.

8
00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:23.929
Flexbox, if you need to do like a rigid
grid like we're doing right here,

9
00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.079
where corners have to meet up,
then doing that flex1,

10
00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.453
flex2, flex3 thing is not gonna work for
you super well.

11
00:00:30.453 --> 00:00:36.583
So you're gonna wanna do fix widths
of 25%, 50%, 75%, etc., or use Grid.

12
00:00:36.583 --> 00:00:39.900
So this would be a perfect opportunity for
you to use CSS Grid.

13
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.046
You could also do everything
inside of one container and

14
00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:51.750
use Flexbox as well, and
then use flex-wrap, that would also work.

15
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.604
I would not suggest the last option there.

16
00:00:55.604 --> 00:00:57.760
But I want you to see how cool Flexbox is.

17
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.630
It's something you can dive deep into.

18
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.930
I wanted to shout out Flexbox Zombies.

19
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.890
It's made by my good friend David Geddes.

20
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.405
There's Kent, we know him.

21
00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:15.150
[LAUGH] He teaches.

22
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.820
He's a Frontend Masters teacher.

23
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.020
So this will actually,
it's a game, and you have to shoot

24
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.840
the zombies using Flexbox,
it's pretty fun, with a crossbow.

25
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.350
There's crossbows involved.

26
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.620
That's how you know it's good.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So check that one out.

27
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.400
And there's also Flexbox Froggy.

28
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.124
I have less experience with this one.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But you have to get

29
00:01:41.124 --> 00:01:47.274
the froggy, and you have to say,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's

30
00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:54.720
gonna be justify-content: flex-end.

31
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.060
See, and then you get the frog to
jump onto the lily pad, right,

32
00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.960
that's kinda cool.

33
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.925
So that's another good one.

34
00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:05.390
And then I've said it a couple of times
here, please watch Jen's course on

35
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.310
Grid and Flex and responsive design and
all that kind of stuff.

36
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.673
It's gonna make you a lot better
CSS programmer, better than me for

37
00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:15.765
sure.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But that being said,

38
00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:20.780
you are now well-equipped
to do most things with CSS.

39
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.479
Maybe besides animations, [LAUGH]
that's an entire different skill set

40
00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.185
that you don't wanna learn from me, so.

41
00:02:28.185 --> 00:02:32.690
That's really all I'm gonna teach
you today about CSS and HTML.

42
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.570
So congratulations, you basically have
a base level proficiency now with HTML and

43
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:38.870
CSS.

44
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.540
So, cool, congratulations.
