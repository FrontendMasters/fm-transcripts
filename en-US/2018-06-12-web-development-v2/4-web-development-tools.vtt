1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.580
If we're gonna build a house,
a craftsperson needs their tools, right?

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.760
So I'm gonna go through here,

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.050
I'm going to basically talk a little
about what I'm going to be using,

4
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.630
and make some recommendations to you
of good tools, I think, to start with.

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.480
That being said,
if you have tools that you already like or

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.070
that you want to use,
I will try to bet as best as I can,

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.270
with my knowledge, accommodate all
the tools that I have knowledge of.

8
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.500
That being said,

9
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.547
if you're gonna be used tools that are
esoteric then you are on your own [LAUGH].

10
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.070
So, I am using macOS today,
if you can't tell.

11
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.800
I will do my best to try and
explain Windows as well.

12
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.020
That's quite funny,
cuz I work at Microsoft and

13
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.240
I do not use Windows [LAUGH].

14
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.790
So, I will do my best,
specifically with bash and windows,

15
00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.609
it gets really sketchy really quickly,
so we will work through it together.

16
00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.710
I think is the answer to that question,
anyway, we'll get there.

17
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.580
If you're on Linux, I have a little
bit more knowledge there of.

18
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.340
And what's nice about using Linux it's
it's pretty similar to Mac anyway, so

19
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.100
if you're using Linux,
you should be able to follow along more or

20
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.100
less with what I'm doing.

21
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.760
Also, I expect if you're using Linux
that you already have some of that

22
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.760
pre existing knowledge anyway.

23
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.120
So asking the developer
about their tools is

24
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.070
like the giant mistake because
they will rant to you for

25
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.860
hours about why they are right and
why everyone else is using terrible tools.

26
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.330
I don't know why we felt this need to
validate ourselves, I'm using this tool

27
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.150
and you have to use it too, or you have
to use this as well or you're an idiot.

28
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.430
I don't know, some dumb stuff like that.

29
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.850
And everyone's trying to use
like the latest shiny stuff,

30
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.910
just find tools that work for you.

31
00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.740
If something works for you and speaks
to you, then just go with that, right?

32
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.550
And that's awesome, and I really encourage
you to go down that, you don't have to use

33
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.170
what's new, you don't have to use what's
shiny, just use what works for you.

34
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.700
And be open minded, right?

35
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.534
Do try new tools and
see if they do work for you.

36
00:02:15.403 --> 00:02:17.803
And if you find yourself
fighting your tools,

37
00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:19.780
then you should question your tools.

38
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.395
That's the other thing as well.

39
00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.240
A little bit of investment in making sure
that you have the best tools will go

40
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.080
a long way.

41
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.595
So you should always be kind of
thinking about, how can I improve this.

42
00:02:33.395 --> 00:02:34.310
Okay.

43
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.560
The first thing is we're gonna be
building websites you need to choose what

44
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.570
browser you're going to use.

45
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.182
I'm using Firefox I'm a huge Mozilla fan
just in general with their mission and

46
00:02:46.182 --> 00:02:50.150
how they're going about making
the web a better place.

47
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.000
So I will be using Firefox you
are definitely welcome to use Chrome.

48
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.340
I think most people will
probably use Chrome.

49
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.890
And that's okay too.

50
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.730
Both of them are world-class
browsers that have

51
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.410
great developer tools as
well as Safari and Edge.

52
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.950
I don't know as much about Opera,
[LAUGH] but definitely in this class I can

53
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.140
speak really well to Edge Safari, Chrome
and Firefox and I will be using Firefox.

54
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.930
If you are using Safari,
if that's what you're liking to use.

55
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.100
I have this link here for you,

56
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.445
make sure you enable the developer
tools that's quite important.

57
00:03:27.445 --> 00:03:33.383
[LAUGH] Everything else they're
just enabled by default, yeah.

58
00:03:33.383 --> 00:03:36.071
Safari you have to actually go
check the boxes, I'm a developer,

59
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:37.560
please show me the developer tools.

60
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.020
Questions about that?

61
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.482
Yeah,
&gt;&gt; Do you use Developer Edition at all

62
00:03:45.482 --> 00:03:47.695
Firefox or just a regular.

63
00:03:47.695 --> 00:03:51.230
&gt;&gt; At work I actually use Nightly
which is even more bleeding edge

64
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.300
one than the Developer Edition.

65
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.570
Today I'm just gonna be
using the normal one.

66
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.510
I don't actually really know
the difference between all that,

67
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.300
there's like four different
versions of Firefox.

68
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.930
It used to make a difference because
the Nightly Developer one was so

69
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.860
far ahead they had made so
many changes to it.

70
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.537
But as of maybe six months ago,
they kind of merged that all together and

71
00:04:15.537 --> 00:04:17.639
now just the stable one is really great.

72
00:04:22.603 --> 00:04:24.105
Cool, good question.

73
00:04:24.105 --> 00:04:26.632
Anyone else?

74
00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:34.620
Okay, the editor.

75
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.136
So this is the tool that you're going
to be using to write code actually.

76
00:04:38.136 --> 00:04:42.900
There are many many options and
this is probably

77
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.565
the most contentious thing that you can
ask someone is what editor do you use?

78
00:04:46.565 --> 00:04:49.993
Cuz everyone has an opinion and
they're all terrible [LAUGH].

79
00:04:52.013 --> 00:04:54.580
I personally use Visual Studio Code.

80
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.300
This is no surprise,
cuz I do work at Microsoft and

81
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.160
I work closely with
the Visual Studio Code team.

82
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.700
That being said, it is a fantastic editor.

83
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.080
I'm a huge fan of it.

84
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.790
I was actually using this before
I even worked at LinkedIn.

85
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.220
I used this when I was working at Netflix,
so

86
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.000
this is actually an opinion I held
before I started working at Microsoft.

87
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.730
The biggest thing that gave me pause
about Visual Studio code when I was

88
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.060
thinking about trying it is, I used to
use Visual Studio when I was in college.

89
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.240
And it is a huge just like it's
a big program, it's very heavy.

90
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.480
It takes a lot of resources.

91
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.980
It's for writing, c++ and
serious programming and things like that.

92
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.760
And so I didn't wanna get back into that.

93
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.980
But it turns out Visual Studio code,

94
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.200
like the only thing that it really
shares with that is the name.

95
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.480
It's completely different.

96
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.690
It's written totally different.

97
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.700
It's a different code base.

98
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.970
It's written in TypeScript,
which is a flavor of JavaScript.

99
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.740
It's totally different from Visual Studio.

100
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.980
So I have a link on here.

101
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.910
If you wanna download it.

102
00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.530
Highly recommend it.

103
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.250
I'm a big fan.

104
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.665
I would say beginner friendly as well,

105
00:06:02.665 --> 00:06:05.821
which is another reason
that I recommend it to you.

106
00:06:09.488 --> 00:06:12.720
And there's a huge amount of
plugins available for it as well.

107
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.930
So if you have something that you want
it to do, someone's probably written

108
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.530
a plugin to help you do that as well,
which is really cool.

109
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.490
And the plugins are written in JavaScript,
so if you have an idea of something

110
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.270
that you want your editor to do, you can
write the code yourself after this, right?

111
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.820
Because you'll have the tool of
JavaScript that you'll be able to use.

112
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.340
If you're not feeling that,
feel free to use Sublime Text 3,

113
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.060
that's what I used for
a decade [LAUGH], so

114
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.950
I'm also very very familiar with Sublime,
it is a great tool, it's very fast.

115
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.970
That's what I liked about it, it opens
files really quickly, it's very efficient.

116
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.980
And there is Adam which I
have not spent any time with.

117
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.600
But there are people that do love it.

118
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.120
It's written by GitHub.

119
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.000
Sublime Text is written by just
a guy that now he has two or

120
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.080
three employees threaten,
working with them as well.

121
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.710
Atom and Visual Studio Code are 100% free.

122
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.440
There's, not even like a premium tier.

123
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.228
It's just a free tool, right?

124
00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:13.110
Sublime Text 3 is free to download and

125
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:18.480
it's forever in trial mode,
it has a trial that never expires.

126
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.730
So I think once you buy,
I think it's $80 if I remember correctly,

127
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.280
and then it'll just stop
showing an annoying pop up.

128
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:29.000
That's all, whenever you start
up the tool, it's worth paying.

129
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.590
For me like I spent enough time
looking at my editor, I've paid for

130
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:36.310
sublime several times over and I probably
should pay them more because they

131
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.429
bought me a decade of productivity,
which is worth something I suppose.

132
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.570
If you want something more Visual
Studio-esque, something a little bit more

133
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:50.010
like Eclipse or NetBeans or something like
that, there's a tool called WebStorm.

134
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.030
I have not used it either.

135
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.260
But it's a more complete suite of tools,
I would say.

136
00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.080
I'm not gonna speak a lot more to it but
it is not free you'd have to pay for

137
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.980
it but the people that do use it,
swear by it.

138
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.274
So Feel free to check
out WebStorm as well.

139
00:08:07.274 --> 00:08:11.015
Lastly, I'm going to state
that these tools exist and

140
00:08:11.015 --> 00:08:15.342
that you should not use them [LAUGH]
Unless you already use them.

141
00:08:15.342 --> 00:08:18.561
There's a tool called vim, and
there's a tool called Emacs.

142
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:22.947
These are command line tools,
they're very difficult to use.

143
00:08:22.947 --> 00:08:25.721
There's someone far smarter than I am.

144
00:08:25.721 --> 00:08:31.763
And also, you will know everyone that uses
them because they will tell you right,

145
00:08:31.763 --> 00:08:34.231
away that they use these things.

146
00:08:34.231 --> 00:08:36.923
I'm not upset, I'm not.

147
00:08:36.923 --> 00:08:38.444
I'm so sick of hearing about them.

148
00:08:38.444 --> 00:08:44.029
So anyway they exist,
I'm gonna tell you, don't use them.

149
00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:46.535
Because the people that are already
using them are gonna say screw you,

150
00:08:46.535 --> 00:08:47.673
I'm not gonna keep using them.

151
00:08:47.673 --> 00:08:52.271
And then everyone else hopefully will
listen to me and not use them so.

152
00:08:52.271 --> 00:08:53.962
Any questions about that?

153
00:08:53.962 --> 00:08:57.081
I bet you there is someone in
chat freaking out about this.

154
00:08:57.081 --> 00:09:00.651
Yep, knew it.

155
00:09:00.651 --> 00:09:05.226
[LAUGH] They're great tools, they just
have a super steep learning curve.

156
00:09:05.226 --> 00:09:07.244
And that's not what you want to do today.

157
00:09:07.244 --> 00:09:10.506
You already have a mountain ahead of you.

158
00:09:10.506 --> 00:09:13.641
&gt;&gt; Actually, most people are saying
that BIM was a nightmare and

159
00:09:13.641 --> 00:09:14.911
a rabbit hole to go down.

160
00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:17.238
Not the other way around.

161
00:09:17.238 --> 00:09:19.331
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; People are not defending it, for

162
00:09:19.331 --> 00:09:21.925
saying that there was
a lot of wasted time.

163
00:09:21.925 --> 00:09:25.284
&gt;&gt; The people that I talk,
I'm sure people going to contradict me.

164
00:09:25.284 --> 00:09:28.694
But the people that I've talked to about
is like it was a giant time suck and

165
00:09:28.694 --> 00:09:29.908
I kind of regret doing it.

166
00:09:29.908 --> 00:09:32.597
But now that I've done it,
I am going to continue doing it right.

167
00:09:32.597 --> 00:09:36.490
That's more or
less the sentiment about it.

168
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:40.481
It's, it's really interesting to watch
someone that's like a wizard of Emacs,

169
00:09:40.481 --> 00:09:44.245
like a Nina zakharchenko, the one of
the other front of masters teachers that I

170
00:09:44.245 --> 00:09:46.830
used to work with, actually and
now work with again.

171
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.292
She's a wizard with Emacs.

172
00:09:48.292 --> 00:09:51.926
It's really crazy to watch the stuff
that she can do super quickly or

173
00:09:51.926 --> 00:09:55.712
like the vim masters like Ryan Florence,
like they just fly, right?

174
00:09:55.712 --> 00:09:57.274
I don't want to do that, I don't care.

175
00:09:57.274 --> 00:09:58.594
I don't wanna spend too much time.

176
00:09:58.594 --> 00:10:01.891
[LAUGH] So Yes, you should.

177
00:10:01.891 --> 00:10:05.086
That's another thing is like,
tackle one mountain at a time, right?

178
00:10:05.086 --> 00:10:06.923
Like, don't try and

179
00:10:06.923 --> 00:10:12.856
learn an editor at the same time
as you're doing, learning to code.

180
00:10:12.856 --> 00:10:15.818
Any other questions?

181
00:10:15.818 --> 00:10:17.767
Or assertions that vim is terrible,
I'm listening.

182
00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:28.134
Okay, the terminal.

183
00:10:28.134 --> 00:10:31.103
So there's two things that I'm
kind of separating out here.

184
00:10:31.103 --> 00:10:33.431
There's the shell and the emulator, and

185
00:10:33.431 --> 00:10:36.500
hopefully I can kind of
explain the difference to you.

186
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.846
So I'll just bring up my terminal here.

187
00:10:40.846 --> 00:10:43.342
Terminal looks like this, right?

188
00:10:43.342 --> 00:10:46.021
I'm sure most of you seen this,
it's a little scary for

189
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:49.400
new people a breach approaching code
like this is the matrix, right?

190
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.544
It's actually just like a really
fancy File Explorer, or

191
00:10:53.544 --> 00:10:56.434
maybe it's a less fancy File Explorer.

192
00:10:56.434 --> 00:10:57.828
Let's go with that.

193
00:10:57.828 --> 00:10:59.950
Like this, right?
Like you click on something, and

194
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.895
like you click on here,
it's the same thing with here.

195
00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:06.098
So I would just go to like,
applications, right?

196
00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:10.317
And I can see what's inside of
the application, which is nothing,

197
00:11:10.317 --> 00:11:12.251
that's was CD talks, right?

198
00:11:12.251 --> 00:11:15.907
And you can see like,
what's in there, like, okay,

199
00:11:15.907 --> 00:11:18.062
I wanna go into web dev, right?

200
00:11:18.062 --> 00:11:19.113
You can see what's in there.

201
00:11:19.113 --> 00:11:22.653
We're going to spend an entire
section on that, but

202
00:11:22.653 --> 00:11:25.151
that's what the terminal is right.

203
00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:29.477
So the emulator is actually like the
window that you're running this thing in.

204
00:11:29.477 --> 00:11:34.426
So that would be in this case, I'm running
it in something called iTerm, you do,

205
00:11:34.426 --> 00:11:37.251
it really doesn't
actually matter too much.

206
00:11:37.251 --> 00:11:43.693
There's one built into Mac called
terminal.app looks like this.

207
00:11:43.693 --> 00:11:49.612
And you can see here it is the same thing,
right?

208
00:11:49.612 --> 00:11:53.547
So, that's what I'm
trying to say here is it

209
00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:58.113
doesn't really matter what
emulator that you use.

210
00:11:58.113 --> 00:12:02.846
So if you don't have anything installed,
just go ahead and use terminal.app.

211
00:12:02.846 --> 00:12:07.157
It's actually I'm told it's the fastest,
by far.

212
00:12:07.157 --> 00:12:09.709
[LAUGH] The reason why
I continue using iTerm,

213
00:12:09.709 --> 00:12:14.209
is it does this thing where I can actually
have two shells next to each other, and

214
00:12:14.209 --> 00:12:16.447
that's just really useful to me, so.

215
00:12:19.253 --> 00:12:23.835
So that is the emulator,
it does not matter,

216
00:12:23.835 --> 00:12:26.980
so just pick one and go with it.

217
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.532
So I'm using iTerm2 today.

218
00:12:30.532 --> 00:12:35.416
And the default Mac or
terminal.app one is great.

219
00:12:35.416 --> 00:12:39.752
There's another one called hyper, which is
like the hipster one to use at the moment.

220
00:12:39.752 --> 00:12:44.190
It is written in JavaScript which is
pretty cool, the last time I used it,

221
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.641
it was really slow so
I just got sick of it went back iTerm.

222
00:12:47.641 --> 00:12:50.597
But I'm sure untold it's
gotten better since then.

223
00:12:50.597 --> 00:12:53.721
So feel free to use hyper
if you are on Windows,

224
00:12:53.721 --> 00:12:57.890
I'm told that HyperX also works
really well for Windows, and

225
00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:02.076
there's one called CMDER,
I don't know anything about it.

226
00:13:02.076 --> 00:13:05.918
So use that at your own risk.

227
00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:10.069
If you're on Linux, I would just suggest
use whatever the one that Linux came with,

228
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:12.129
whatever your flavor of Linux came with.

229
00:13:12.129 --> 00:13:15.737
With in other words, I have no idea.

230
00:13:15.737 --> 00:13:19.799
[LAUGH] So any one of these

231
00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:25.089
totally fine does not matter.

232
00:13:25.089 --> 00:13:29.200
For the shells that's actually like
what the code that's running inside

233
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.658
the emulator, right, so

234
00:13:30.658 --> 00:13:34.587
you have iTerm and then iTerm is
running something inside of it right?

235
00:13:34.587 --> 00:13:36.640
That's called the shell.

236
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:42.406
And it does matter which shell
you're using, use bash please today.

237
00:13:42.406 --> 00:13:46.857
If you're using something else,
you are on your own and

238
00:13:46.857 --> 00:13:51.318
I do not know how to work in z,
sh or any of the other ones.

239
00:13:51.318 --> 00:13:53.660
Actually I quite like fish
which is another one but

240
00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.461
we are not using it because no
one else uses fish besides me.

241
00:13:56.461 --> 00:14:01.691
So we're using using fish, okay, cool.

242
00:14:01.691 --> 00:14:07.101
So fish is cool, anyway, just use bash.

243
00:14:07.101 --> 00:14:09.932
We're using bash today.

244
00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:13.131
And the reason being is that
everytime that you Google something,

245
00:14:13.131 --> 00:14:16.055
the answer is always written in bash,
100% of the time.

246
00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:18.460
No one writes in anything
else besides bash.

247
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:25.493
So that's a really good reason to use
bash, it's ubiquitous everywhere.

248
00:14:25.493 --> 00:14:29.369
Okay, so, that's you terminal tool.

249
00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:36.715
We will get much more into that probably
more towards the end of tomorrow.

250
00:14:36.715 --> 00:14:40.425
Lastly, just like you should be really
careful where you get your news from,

251
00:14:40.425 --> 00:14:44.250
you should also be really careful what
developer resources you are looking at,

252
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.756
when you are Googling things.

253
00:14:45.756 --> 00:14:49.383
And so I wanted to give you
a few that I trust personally.

254
00:14:49.383 --> 00:14:51.711
That whenever I'm googling something,

255
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:55.510
these are the first resources that
I see if they have anything on it.

256
00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:59.580
So, my favorite developer resource
of all time that I love and

257
00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.553
I literally have it open all the time,
like,

258
00:15:02.553 --> 00:15:07.268
I'm not exaggerating is literally
always open on my laptop is the MDN.

259
00:15:07.268 --> 00:15:09.789
It used to stand for
Mozilla Developer Network and

260
00:15:09.789 --> 00:15:12.980
now it's actually they've just
said it now it's called MDN.

261
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.261
It doesn't stand for anything more,
it's just called MDN.

262
00:15:16.261 --> 00:15:20.716
It's from Mozilla,
it's at developer.mozilla.org.

263
00:15:20.716 --> 00:15:23.196
And it is just it's the Bible, right?

264
00:15:23.196 --> 00:15:27.319
It's like it's everything about,
web programming in one spot.

265
00:15:27.319 --> 00:15:32.635
So if I have a question about, let's say,

266
00:15:32.635 --> 00:15:39.873
h1s, you just click here and
it just has it's complete,

267
00:15:39.873 --> 00:15:45.211
so it's going to have everything on here.

268
00:15:45.211 --> 00:15:48.283
So, but it's also approachable,
which is kind of rare.

269
00:15:48.283 --> 00:15:51.784
It's either something is complete and
complicated usually, or

270
00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.510
it's not complete and simple.

271
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.030
And they kind of strike
a good balance here.

272
00:15:55.030 --> 00:16:00.557
So MDN is just the best, anything that
you can always trust something that's

273
00:16:00.557 --> 00:16:07.451
on the MDN So yeah, great, great resource.

274
00:16:07.451 --> 00:16:10.570
There's another one out there called
w3schools that usually comes up

275
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:11.306
before the MDN.

276
00:16:11.306 --> 00:16:17.150
And I would suggest that you skip
w3schools and go to the MDN.

277
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.631
I am a huge fan of CSS tricks.

278
00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:25.633
This is specifically very helpful for
CSS and HTML.

279
00:16:25.633 --> 00:16:28.314
But they also have really good
JavaScript resources as well.

280
00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:33.339
And they also have amazing articles,
just in generals like a publication.

281
00:16:33.339 --> 00:16:38.704
But they have here, like Flexbox,
because that's usually what it is.

282
00:16:40.922 --> 00:16:45.006
So, like for example, we're going to
be learning about flex later today.

283
00:16:45.006 --> 00:16:50.016
And they had this amazing resource of
like, how to do flex really well and

284
00:16:50.016 --> 00:16:54.289
it has like diagrams and
it's really, really well written.

285
00:16:54.289 --> 00:16:59.171
So for learning about CSS in HTML,
I definitely suggest CSS tricks.

286
00:17:02.423 --> 00:17:06.377
For video content, there's a website
called Frontend Masters, it's okay.

287
00:17:06.377 --> 00:17:08.254
I give it like a 4 out of 10.

288
00:17:08.254 --> 00:17:11.953
I'm just kidding,
it's great, I like it a lot.

289
00:17:11.953 --> 00:17:15.461
I recommend a ton of resources in here,
not because they pay me to or

290
00:17:15.461 --> 00:17:16.601
anything like that.

291
00:17:16.601 --> 00:17:18.051
I mean, they could.

292
00:17:18.051 --> 00:17:18.705
You could.

293
00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:22.238
[LAUGH] But because I legitimately
think it's awesome content,

294
00:17:22.238 --> 00:17:25.117
like I've watched a bunch
of stuff on there myself,

295
00:17:25.117 --> 00:17:27.997
the kind of teachers that
they get are really great.

296
00:17:27.997 --> 00:17:29.933
So, if it's on Frontend Masters,

297
00:17:29.933 --> 00:17:33.036
you can pretty well guarantee
it's gonna be good stuff.

298
00:17:33.036 --> 00:17:34.273
It's worth watching.

299
00:17:37.487 --> 00:17:40.337
Lastly, if I'm working like
with a library or framework or

300
00:17:40.337 --> 00:17:42.333
some like specific piece of technology,

301
00:17:42.333 --> 00:17:45.823
it's usually a good idea to go directly
to the documentation to read it.

302
00:17:45.823 --> 00:17:50.098
So if I'm working with like react, I'll
usually go to the react documentation.

303
00:17:50.098 --> 00:17:53.955
And it's good to prefer those because the
developers will tend to keep those things

304
00:17:53.955 --> 00:17:56.948
up to date, whereas like
a Stack Overflow answer might be date.

305
00:17:56.948 --> 00:17:58.832
So, that's a good thing
to keep in mind as well.

306
00:17:58.832 --> 00:18:01.481
And that being also,
I don't have on here, but

307
00:18:01.481 --> 00:18:05.279
Stack Overflow actually usually is
a pretty good resource as well.

308
00:18:05.279 --> 00:18:08.403
Because usually, like,
even as things progress,

309
00:18:08.403 --> 00:18:12.887
people will re answer questions and
then upload them and things like that.

310
00:18:12.887 --> 00:18:16.845
So, Stack Overflow is also a good
place to get questions answered.

311
00:18:19.913 --> 00:18:23.814
Frontend Masters does this really cool
thing called the Frontend Handbook.

312
00:18:25.599 --> 00:18:27.629
It's written by this
guy named Cody Lindley.

313
00:18:27.629 --> 00:18:29.663
He's a really smart guy.

314
00:18:29.663 --> 00:18:33.772
And it's just kind of like a huge
overview of like the entire typography of

315
00:18:33.772 --> 00:18:35.711
the Frontend development world.

316
00:18:35.711 --> 00:18:37.503
And it's just great.

317
00:18:37.503 --> 00:18:42.935
There's, it's super exhaustive,
like they go over a bunch of stuff.

318
00:18:42.935 --> 00:18:46.350
It's, yeah, it's great.

319
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:51.498
So it's also good to just kind of peruse
and go through and see what's in there.

320
00:18:53.484 --> 00:18:56.414
And it's free like,
which is awesome as well.

321
00:19:00.226 --> 00:19:00.758
Cool.

322
00:19:00.758 --> 00:19:04.737
Any questions about any of
the tools that I've proposed?

323
00:19:04.737 --> 00:19:07.216
&gt;&gt; VS code also has
terminal built into it.

324
00:19:07.216 --> 00:19:09.655
&gt;&gt; That's a good point.

325
00:19:09.655 --> 00:19:10.716
In fact, that's great point.

326
00:19:10.716 --> 00:19:13.569
If you go into VS code,
do I have VS code open here?

327
00:19:19.155 --> 00:19:20.094
So this is VS code.

328
00:19:20.094 --> 00:19:21.553
This is what it looks like.

329
00:19:21.553 --> 00:19:24.648
And I think it's control Tilda, yeah,

330
00:19:24.648 --> 00:19:28.573
it brings up this terminal
down here in the bottom.

331
00:19:28.573 --> 00:19:31.684
And you can actually use the terminal
directly built into VS code as well.

332
00:19:31.684 --> 00:19:33.405
So, good point.

333
00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:41.915
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was asking if
we needed to download bash.

334
00:19:41.915 --> 00:19:42.645
&gt;&gt; Which is a great question.

335
00:19:42.645 --> 00:19:44.983
Do we need to download bash?

336
00:19:44.983 --> 00:19:49.844
The answer to that question is no,
because, every operating

337
00:19:49.844 --> 00:19:55.080
system should already have bash
installed including Mac Linux and

338
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.648
even windows 10 now actually does have it.

339
00:19:58.648 --> 00:20:04.748
If you are using Windows 10,
There are these steps right here,

340
00:20:04.748 --> 00:20:09.128
that if you click on it, it'll take
you to a link on the Microsoft docs,

341
00:20:09.128 --> 00:20:12.495
so it will take you to how
to enable it for Windows 10.

342
00:20:12.495 --> 00:20:17.209
If you're on anything before windows 10,
you are out, unfortunately out of luck.

343
00:20:17.209 --> 00:20:20.192
[LAUGH] So the only thing here
that you should have to actually

344
00:20:20.192 --> 00:20:23.474
download is whatever editor you're using,
I imagine most of you

345
00:20:23.474 --> 00:20:26.772
probably already have a browser
that you're comfortable with.

346
00:20:26.772 --> 00:20:30.752
But if not, then download
the browser that you want as well.

347
00:20:30.752 --> 00:20:34.067
Otherwise, everything should
already be on your computer
