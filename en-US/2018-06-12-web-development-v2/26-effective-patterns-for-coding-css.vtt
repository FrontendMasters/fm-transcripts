00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.560
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We've kind of been
talking about CSS in a vacuum,

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.060
we've been using style tags,
which I told you not to use.

3
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.665
You should not be using style
tags in your normal projects,

4
00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:10.090
just on these tiny little examples.

5
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.650
But somehow you need to connect
your CSS and your HTML together.

6
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.161
And I feel like a lot of times for
people that falls apart, like,

7
00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:21.300
how do I get these two disparate
ideas working together?

8
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.480
So we talked about the head tag in HTML,
right?

9
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.857
Inside of your head tag,
you can definitely put these style tags,

10
00:00:27.857 --> 00:00:30.160
it works just the way that we've
been working with them before.

11
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.840
But the better thing you
can do is put a link tag,

12
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.980
that's what this is right here, link.

13
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.128
You can use link technically for
other things, but 99.99% of the time, and

14
00:00:43.128 --> 00:00:47.654
I don't think actually I'm exaggerating,
I'm pretty sure it's accurate number,

15
00:00:47.654 --> 00:00:49.390
it's gonna be for stylesheets.

16
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.432
So you're gonna say rel="stylesheet',
that's how

17
00:00:52.432 --> 00:00:57.190
you let it know this is a stylesheet,
this should be interpreted as CSS.

18
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.980
And then you give it
an href of where it is.

19
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.824
So if I put ./style.css,
that means wherever my intex.html file is,

20
00:01:05.824 --> 00:01:08.780
it's in the same folder, right?

21
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.060
So look in the same folder, and
look for a file called styles.css.

22
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.700
That's what the ./style.css means.

23
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.590
We'll talk more about paths once
we get to working with the Bash,

24
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.500
but just believe me for now when I say ./,
it means look in the same directory.

25
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.132
Does that make sense to people?

26
00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:33.920
Okay, you can actually just say style.css,
without the ./, but

27
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.251
I put the ./ in there to kinda
get you thinking about that cuz

28
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:41.430
you're gonna see a lot more, and for
other things that ./ is required.

29
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.450
So if that's new to you, just get used
to seeing ./ meaning in the same folder,

30
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.671
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

31
00:01:50.671 --> 00:01:52.311
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Our my-brand,

32
00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:55.910
right here I have a my-brand.

33
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.810
And I'll write in my style.css file,

34
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.746
which is a totally different
file from my index.html file,

35
00:02:00.746 --> 00:02:04.390
I'll write this CSS rule, and
it will affect this h1 right here, right?

36
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.631
So if we follow how those things get
connected, they're are two separate files.

37
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:14.651
But because of this HTML, this index
file will be the first one loaded,

38
00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:19.609
the browser will say, you have a link tag,
I'm gonna go out and download this other

39
00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:23.451
file and bring that in, and
then I am going to apply for all CSS here.

40
00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:27.140
In fact, what really happens if you
browser reaches this, it stops,

41
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.340
it stops doing everything and
it waits for that to download.

42
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.782
So you wanna be careful because that will
slow down your site because obviously it's

43
00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:41.766
waiting for that stylesheet to load.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

44
00:02:41.766 --> 00:02:45.242
any questions about that?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, what is

45
00:02:45.242 --> 00:02:50.228
the difference between link and href?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Between link and

46
00:02:50.228 --> 00:02:51.520
href?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

47
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.503
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is a link tag,

48
00:02:52.503 --> 00:02:54.486
right, it's a specific kind of HTML tag.

49
00:02:54.486 --> 00:02:57.630
And this is the href attribute, right?

50
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.920
So it's describing something
about link and it's telling you

51
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.672
where the stylesheet is located.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Do you follow,

52
00:03:06.672 --> 00:03:08.713
does that make sense?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

53
00:03:08.713 --> 00:03:09.589
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

54
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:16.975
good question.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

55
00:03:19.747 --> 00:03:20.896
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: When to actually use

56
00:03:20.896 --> 00:03:22.540
the cascade?

57
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.630
So I spent this time kind of telling
you and drilling into your head,

58
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.545
don't use the cascade,
except sometimes when you use the cascade.

59
00:03:28.545 --> 00:03:34.210
[LAUGH] Now, imagine I have a website
with these nice looking buttons, right?

60
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.594
I have a Default Button, a Warn Button,
and a Success Button, and

61
00:03:38.594 --> 00:03:40.500
they're all on my web page.

62
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.400
I don't really wanna actually rewrite
the styles for this three separate times.

63
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.290
It'd be really nice if I could
just reuse most of the styles

64
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.160
that are the same, right?

65
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.190
Because it's the same border,
it's the same font, it's the font-weight,

66
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.890
it's the same font-size.

67
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.450
And later, if I wanna go in, it's like,
you know what, I don't really like that

68
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.410
this is bold, I'm just gonna get
rid of that particular part of it.

69
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.850
It'd be nice if it changed
all of them at once

70
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.940
rather than having to change
it three different times.

71
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.220
As programmers in general, we're generally
striving to not repeat ourselves.

72
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.604
DRY, do not repeat yourself.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

73
00:04:23.692 --> 00:04:25.676
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is a occasion where

74
00:04:25.676 --> 00:04:30.740
you wanna lightly, very,
very lightly, use the cascade.

75
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.530
So I have these three buttons.

76
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:40.900
I have the ex, just stands for example cuz
I was uncreative at the time, and btn is

77
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.730
a very common abbreviation you'll see for
button, when people put them in classes.

78
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.540
So I have one here that's
the Default Button,

79
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.040
and then I have one that's a Warn Button,
like, hey,

80
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.590
you're about to do something that
you're gonna regret or whatever.

81
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.270
And then I have one here for Success,

82
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.330
like you successfully have done something,
right?

83
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.740
So what I do here is I
have the Default Button.

84
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.040
I write all of the styles that I need for
the Default Button, and

85
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.130
then I will do just the bare
minimum that has to change for

86
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.750
the Warn Button and for
the Success Button.

87
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.040
So I change the color cuz this is black,
I change the background color, and

88
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.120
I change the border color,
and nothing else.

89
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.470
Everything else should go inside
of the Default Button, right?

90
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.300
So this is an occasion where you're
technically using the cascade because

91
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.130
these come lower on the page, right?

92
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.640
So that's how it wins.

93
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.570
Now, notice I'm not going crazy with these
selectors, I'm not throwing a bunch of

94
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:41.770
unnecessary stuff inside of the cascading
tags, this is very, very minimalistic.

95
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.330
The other thing that I will suggest that
you do if you are using the cascade,

96
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.780
make sure they all live in the same
file next to each other so

97
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.680
that you can read everything just
by scrolling through one file.

98
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.070
I will see a lot of times people will
have them across multiple files.

99
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.500
That's bad because
whenever something breaks,

100
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.800
you now have to look
across multiple files.

101
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.421
That's not a good thing.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions about that,

102
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:06.720
please.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So

103
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.050
is this an example where a comment saying,
hey, it gets thee properties

104
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.706
from this class would be useful?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I

105
00:06:15.706 --> 00:06:19.030
like what you're thinking about,
I think that's a good train of thought.

106
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.818
I think the way I would do
it is maybe here inside

107
00:06:22.818 --> 00:06:27.288
of ex-btn.warn I would put
something like this, and

108
00:06:27.288 --> 00:06:32.341
it would say, inherits from ex-btn or
something like that so

109
00:06:32.341 --> 00:06:37.491
people know it's like, hey,
this is actually meant to always

110
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:42.191
go with ex-btn.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

111
00:06:42.191 --> 00:06:44.750
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is that good practice?

112
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.000
Is that how it would typically be done?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know if I'm gonna

113
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.920
say typically.

114
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.889
I don't know if there's necessarily
any common practice around this.

115
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.180
Every company that I've worked for,
including Netflix,

116
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.570
including LinkedIn, my fault,

117
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:06.520
myself included as a party at fault,
all the CSS has always been a hot mess.

118
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.680
Just because over time, with like two
dozen engineers working on the same thing,

119
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.550
things just get out of control.

120
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.710
Cuz people are going fast and

121
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.680
they're iterating quickly, and
that's just really common to happen.

122
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.610
So anything that you can
do to keep things clean and

123
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.330
easy to digest and manage,
really, really, really helps.

124
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.763
So things like that would be helpful.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right now we're talking

125
00:07:30.763 --> 00:07:36.500
about writing raw CSS, and there's lots
of companies that still write raw CSS.

126
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.233
But there are higher level languages that
you can write, like Sass and Less, and

127
00:07:41.233 --> 00:07:45.062
there's these other technologies
that are very CSS-looking,

128
00:07:45.062 --> 00:07:49.308
that have additional features,
that you can actually group all of these

129
00:07:49.308 --> 00:07:52.330
things together, and
then it compiles out to CSS.

130
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.032
And so a lot of times, you'll rely on
tools like that to kind of help you to

131
00:07:56.032 --> 00:08:00.158
stay a little bit more honest
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It makes it hopefully

132
00:08:00.158 --> 00:08:01.520
a little bit more readable.

133
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.660
Often the case is it makes
it even less readable.

134
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.380
So with great power comes great
responsibility and everyone's like,

135
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.364
no we'll just take the great power and

136
00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:14.716
shirk the responsibility so.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

137
00:08:14.716 --> 00:08:16.710
But I think this would
be a useful pattern.

138
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.859
If I walked into code base and
I saw comments like that,

139
00:08:19.859 --> 00:08:23.320
I would be very pleased.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cuz it's like it's

140
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.578
thoughtful.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cuz if I see this one here

141
00:08:27.578 --> 00:08:33.220
in a vacuum, just the ex-btn-warn,
I don't know anything else about it right?

142
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.860
Assuming that I can't
see the ex-btn above it.

143
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.977
So if I saw something right away says,
this inherits from this, it's like, cool,

144
00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:44.592
I can immediately go look at that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Kind of closes that

145
00:08:44.592 --> 00:08:50.815
loop for me.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, other questions?

146
00:08:59.543 --> 00:09:00.173
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I've kind of

147
00:09:00.173 --> 00:09:03.795
just been hinting at this quite a bit so
far like I keep opening my devtools.

148
00:09:03.795 --> 00:09:06.718
But I want to formally introduce
you to your devtools really quick.

149
00:09:06.718 --> 00:09:11.181
So I have a decent amount of familiarity

150
00:09:11.181 --> 00:09:15.515
with both Chrome's and Firefox's.

151
00:09:15.515 --> 00:09:17.716
They both have really
different strengths and so

152
00:09:17.716 --> 00:09:20.300
I actually end up using both
of them with some frequency.

153
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.305
There's plenty of people,
there's plenty that just use Chrome.

154
00:09:25.305 --> 00:09:28.010
But Firefox has some
really good stuff too.

155
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.130
They've really made some leaps and bounds.

156
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:33.740
So the easiest way to open it,
the easiest way to remember it,

157
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.310
is just right-click on something and
say, inspect element.

158
00:09:38.986 --> 00:09:42.270
This will not show up in Safari unless
you turn on the developer tools, just so

159
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.420
you know.

160
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.350
So I say, Inspect Element, and

161
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.580
notice that it takes me directly to that
button that I right-clicked on, right?

162
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.790
So if you want to just wonder
what's going on with this element,

163
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.300
I don't understand why the CSS
is doing what it's doing.

164
00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.370
Just right click and inspect element.

165
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:05.890
Takes me to here and notice that it tells
me right here, it's getting the green

166
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:10.870
color from this x button success, and
it's also inheriting from this one.

167
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.530
So, the top one will be the most
specific one that it's inheriting from.

168
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.330
The next one underneath that will
be next most specific one, and

169
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:22.320
notice that all these things
here are crossed out.

170
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.400
It means like hey it actually does,

171
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.870
it's getting a background color of
gray if that's what that color is.

172
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:34.580
But it's not coming through because
something above it is more specific.

173
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.670
Now you can say that well,

174
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.730
I wonder what happens if
the background color wasn't set.

175
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.350
And so you can click that and then it
will show us like if this wasn't set,

176
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.480
this is what it would look like.

177
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.230
And you can kind of toggle that on and
off to see what that looks like.

178
00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.460
It's pretty powerful.

179
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.272
And I can even go as far to say, well, you
know, I wonder if the color was orange.

180
00:10:57.757 --> 00:11:02.638
Okay, that's what it would look like or
I wonder if

181
00:11:02.638 --> 00:11:07.434
the background color was crimson?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

182
00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:11.158
you can kind of just tool around with
things and kind of like experiment and

183
00:11:11.158 --> 00:11:14.830
like rapidly iterate,
I do this literally all the time, right?

184
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.870
So when I'm writing CSS,
I usually don't go straight to my editor,

185
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.530
I go straight to my browser I kind
of figure out what I want it to do,

186
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.370
just by messing around with it like this,
and then I just

187
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:29.410
copy everything that worked,
and paste it into my editor.

188
00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.663
And that's a really good
way just to go fast.

189
00:11:35.844 --> 00:11:36.603
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can,

190
00:11:39.715 --> 00:11:43.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Write additional rules, so

191
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:49.622
I could say,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What

192
00:11:49.622 --> 00:11:56.150
happens if this is on hover, oops, :hover.

193
00:11:56.150 --> 00:12:01.541
And I want the background color
to be cyan whenever I hover

194
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:08.255
over it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

195
00:12:08.255 --> 00:12:10.380
then I have to unset these as well.

196
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.760
So now whenever I hover over it it's cyan,
right?

197
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.430
So you can actually just like to
write these things right directly in

198
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.430
the dev tools.

199
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.350
I can go as far as,
now I can go to computed and

200
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:31.340
I can go and see, this is 128 by 25 pixels

201
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.800
with 4 padding on top and bottom and
15 padding on left and right.

202
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.712
I can see that it has two pixel border
top, two pixel border left, bottom, and

203
00:12:42.712 --> 00:12:43.630
right.

204
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:44.920
And it has no margins.

205
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.610
I was like, you know what?

206
00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:49.798
I wonder what this looks like if I just
change this to be 25 pixels margin

207
00:12:49.798 --> 00:12:52.407
right there and
just directly modify there as

208
00:12:52.407 --> 00:12:57.381
well.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you really

209
00:12:57.381 --> 00:12:59.708
wanna get into the weeds
of why something is,

210
00:12:59.708 --> 00:13:02.894
you can come in here to the computed and
you just scroll down and

211
00:13:02.894 --> 00:13:07.210
you can see everything that it has,
including all the defaults.

212
00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.355
So I can see here,

213
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.170
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Text align
some of the stuff down here.

214
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:21.830
And you can see this is
coming from forms.css, and

215
00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.740
this is coming from in line and
a bunch of stuff like that.

216
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.576
Yeah, that's layout.

217
00:13:28.576 --> 00:13:32.690
If you're using CSS grid,
it has some useful stuff here.

218
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.510
The box model properties
are all right here.

219
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.630
Animations, we're not doing any
animations at all in this course,

220
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.180
but It has really useful tools for

221
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:47.480
like, visualizing how animations are
happening and timelines for animations.

222
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.890
Stuff that was really difficult to do
before, that makes it a lot easier.

223
00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.050
You can see,
it's just using the system font but

224
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.420
you can see where those are coming from.

225
00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:02.949
What else?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

226
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:07.946
admin class so that is really useful
stuff all to be used from the Firefox,

227
00:14:07.946 --> 00:14:13.240
devtools but everything I showed
you is like 80% the same in Chrome.

228
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.412
So questions about that?

229
00:14:20.563 --> 00:14:22.978
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The easy way to open and

230
00:14:22.978 --> 00:14:26.171
close these is Alt+Cmd+I.

231
00:14:26.171 --> 00:14:30.895
And I don't know what it is in Windows.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Ctrl+Shift+I.

232
00:14:30.895 --> 00:14:33.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm going Ctrl+Shift+I.

233
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.120
Cool.

234
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.250
I think that opens it in most browsers.

235
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:44.291
And as you hit F12.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: What

236
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:50.135
would you say the strengths are, comparing
Firefox and Chrome devtools, like in

237
00:14:50.135 --> 00:14:55.850
what cases would you use one or the other?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: They've converged a lot.

238
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.170
There was a lot of stuff that Chrome used
to be able to do that Firefox couldn't,

239
00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.360
and Firefox has greatly caught up.

240
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.850
The reason being is they totally
reworked everything in Firefox.

241
00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:09.010
Now the Firefox devtools are built in
React, which I think is pretty cool.

242
00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.260
And so
they're able to iterate really quickly.

243
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.910
The grid inspector for Firefox is
really cool, if you're using CSS grid.

244
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:21.770
If you're doing performance profiling
of your JavaScript applications,

245
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.260
you still can't really beat Chrome.

246
00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.080
Chrome is a lot better at doing
profiling for that kind of stuff.

247
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.840
Like if you're looking, well I mean,
they both do memory leak kind of stuff.

248
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.058
I guess this does have performance
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

249
00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:36.820
I haven't actually too
much tooled with that.

250
00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.320
This one has this new style editor thing

251
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.720
that you can actually see
everything that's coming in as CSS.

252
00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.960
So for all the code highlighting
stuff here, you can see

253
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:54.440
here I have this codemirror.css, it
actually gives me the whole CSS document,

254
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.010
and I can edit the CSS
directly in my devtools here.

255
00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.640
And I can actually save,
and it will save back, so

256
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.040
I didn't even have to go open my editor.

257
00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.690
You can pretty much use your
browser as your editor.

258
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:11.432
Chrome does the same thing, too, so,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Really,

259
00:16:11.432 --> 00:16:16.072
really cool stuff.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

260
00:16:16.072 --> 00:16:18.920
right there, thanks, CodeMirror.

261
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.970
U is important for library stuff.

262
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:28.643
The problem is if I ever had to override
the library, which occasionally happens,

263
00:16:28.643 --> 00:16:32.715
I I have to do really crazy stuff if I
wanna override important things that

264
00:16:32.715 --> 00:16:36.547
you're not proud of, things you
have to take a shower afterwards.

265
00:16:40.978 --> 00:16:41.940
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Honestly,

266
00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:48.576
they're both fantastic browsers, and
just use the one that you're comfortable

267
00:16:48.576 --> 00:16:55.903
with.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If I

268
00:16:55.903 --> 00:16:59.550
go back to the inspector,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

269
00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.870
you can also dock to the side.

270
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:09.958
That's a useful thing to know.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This one's useful as well.

271
00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.930
Let's see, let's dock to the side.

272
00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:17.630
So I can actually look at this
website as if it was being loaded in,

273
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.130
let's say, an iPhone 6s.

274
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.521
So it makes it the correct height and
width.

275
00:17:23.521 --> 00:17:28.080
It will actually send headers to
the servers like, hey, I'm an iPhone.

276
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.540
Send me the iPhone version.

277
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.880
And so it kinda tricks the server
into sending you the iPhone version.

278
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.670
So you can actually debug what
your phone stuff will look

279
00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:39.800
like directly in your browser,
really, really useful to do.

280
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.401
Something else you can do is you can say,
hey,

281
00:17:42.401 --> 00:17:46.964
make this act like I'm on a cellphone or
make it slow down my website to the point.

282
00:17:46.964 --> 00:17:49.811
If I say good 2G and
try and refresh this page,

283
00:17:49.811 --> 00:17:52.660
it's gonna take a little
bit to load the page.

284
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.891
Hey, I actually did okay, go team.

285
00:17:57.891 --> 00:18:00.693
I did not write this website for
performance.

286
00:18:00.693 --> 00:18:02.303
But you can see now, it's still loading,

287
00:18:02.303 --> 00:18:07.008
which is crazy.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sure you always turn

288
00:18:07.008 --> 00:18:10.614
off throttling,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or else you're gonna have

289
00:18:10.614 --> 00:18:16.417
a bad time browsing the Internet.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

290
00:18:16.417 --> 00:18:21.140
you can use this color dropper to, hey,
I wonder what shade of blue that is.

291
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:27.550
So you can drag it around and see,
that's this hex number or this hex number.

292
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.454
Occasionally useful if you
need to figure out a color.

293
00:18:34.023 --> 00:18:34.839
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, good stuff.

294
00:18:36.242 --> 00:18:37.320
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Please.

295
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.750
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So do you typically,

296
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:42.710
when you're writing real websites,
do you have rules?

297
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:46.108
Say, okay, so if this is an iPhone,
we're gonna do this, and

298
00:18:46.108 --> 00:18:49.080
then you have to write certain rules for
the iPhone?

299
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:55.147
Or is it all supposed to work in every
single format, whether it's web or

300
00:18:55.147 --> 00:18:57.955
mobile or whatever else?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'll give

301
00:18:57.955 --> 00:19:02.799
you two answers that, as a general rule,
you want to not target specific browsers.

302
00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:06.425
Because whenever you target
specific browsers, things change.

303
00:19:06.425 --> 00:19:10.083
And then the things that you wrote to
target the specific browser no longer

304
00:19:10.083 --> 00:19:10.854
work anymore.

305
00:19:10.854 --> 00:19:14.409
And that creates more work for
me, and in general,

306
00:19:14.409 --> 00:19:18.470
I do not like doing work,
[LAUGH] so I try and minimize that.

307
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:26.070
The practical answer to that,
so the ideological, the ideal

308
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:30.020
answer to that would be, everything
should work perfectly in every browser.

309
00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:36.300
The practical answer to that is you
should really know who your audience is.

310
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:40.080
You should figure out, looking at
Google Analytics or something like that.

311
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:46.010
This website is being browsed by 95%
people that are using Windows 10 Edge.

312
00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:50.126
I'm gonna spend a whole lot more
time debugging in Windows 10 Edge.

313
00:19:50.126 --> 00:19:54.760
Iif only 0.001% of them
are using Samsung Internet,

314
00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.410
probably will never look
at Samsung Internet.

315
00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:01.690
So know your user base,
respond to your user base.

316
00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:04.890
Also recognize that you might
have 95% in Windows Edge,

317
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.136
because that's the only one that works.

318
00:20:07.136 --> 00:20:10.271
[LAUGH] And so, people are coming
on Firefox, like this is ugly and

319
00:20:10.271 --> 00:20:11.082
then bounce out.

320
00:20:11.082 --> 00:20:15.298
So you have to kind of question
your assumptions as well.

321
00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:20.755
But the example I always give is if
you're making a website that you can hail

322
00:20:20.755 --> 00:20:27.330
helicopters in Brooklyn, you need to work
on high end iPhones and that's about it.

323
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:31.450
You're probably not gonna have too many
people hailing it on Windows XP, for

324
00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:32.390
example.

325
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.916
So, you kind of have to
figure out where you are.

326
00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:39.537
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But idealistically,

327
00:20:39.537 --> 00:20:43.473
you're gonna base things
on the width of the page.

328
00:20:43.473 --> 00:20:47.454
That's generally the thing,
you use these things called media queries.

329
00:20:47.454 --> 00:20:50.810
If this is less than 200 pixels wide,
apply this style.

330
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.574
This is less than 500 pixels wide,
apply this style.

331
00:20:53.574 --> 00:20:56.752
If this is less than 800 pixels wide,
then apply these styles and

332
00:20:56.752 --> 00:21:00.222
see how these break points, that when
it gets this big, then it changes.

333
00:21:00.222 --> 00:21:02.151
When it gets this big, it changes again.

334
00:21:02.151 --> 00:21:06.431
You're just usually messing with widths,
font sizes, paddings,

335
00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:08.586
margins, those sorts of things.

336
00:21:08.586 --> 00:21:12.374
Good question, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So you said with font size,

337
00:21:12.374 --> 00:21:17.541
when you specify a pixel, it's not
actually a pixel, but is it a pixel

338
00:21:17.541 --> 00:21:23.470
when you're using margins and borders?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Once upon a time,

339
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.800
it actually used to be a physical pixel.

340
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:30.540
At some point in time, we realized
that a pixel is not a pixel anymore.

341
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:36.210
That what is a pixel for an iPhone is
far tinier than what is a pixel for

342
00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:40.870
a CRT from the 80s or whatever, right?

343
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:47.323
So at some point, they decided a pixel
is this readable unit for this monitor.

344
00:21:47.323 --> 00:21:53.247
And so it's some fixed width, that it's
ideally some amount of inches wide,

345
00:21:53.247 --> 00:21:55.867
I don't actually know what it is.

346
00:21:56.958 --> 00:22:00.278
But now it's like an inch, right?

347
00:22:00.278 --> 00:22:01.268
What is an inch?

348
00:22:01.268 --> 00:22:02.448
An inch is an inch, right?

349
00:22:02.448 --> 00:22:05.228
It's kinda the same thing,
a pixel is just a pixel.

350
00:22:05.228 --> 00:22:07.558
There might be a better answer for
that, but I don't actually know.
