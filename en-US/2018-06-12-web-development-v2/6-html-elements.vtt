1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.971
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
there are, I looked it up.

2
00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:07.324
Did I put how many there are?

3
00:00:07.324 --> 00:00:10.957
We're gonna go over some of the more
important ones right here, but,

4
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.996
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's some 300-odd tags,

5
00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:24.143
I think there's 300 or 350-ish tags.

6
00:00:24.143 --> 00:00:27.797
But you definitely, definitely, definitely
do not need to know all of them.

7
00:00:27.797 --> 00:00:28.738
I don't know all of them.

8
00:00:28.738 --> 00:00:30.104
I probably, I don't even know half.

9
00:00:30.104 --> 00:00:32.192
I guarantee you, I don't even know half.

10
00:00:32.192 --> 00:00:36.246
You probably use,
I'm gonna guess 50, at most.

11
00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:40.292
There's probably 1 to
30 that you use a lot,

12
00:00:40.292 --> 00:00:46.778
30 to 50 of them that you use sometimes,
and the rest that you use never.

13
00:00:46.778 --> 00:00:50.836
[LAUGH] And there's a certain
amount of them that are deprecated,

14
00:00:50.836 --> 00:00:53.208
is the word that we would use for that.

15
00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:56.588
Which is they used to exist, and
they are no longer in use, and

16
00:00:56.588 --> 00:00:58.733
you're discouraged from using them.

17
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.529
So there's a bunch of those as well.

18
00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:04.060
I mean, HTML is how old?

19
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.531
30 years old or
something like that, maybe longer.

20
00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:12.919
And when they were designing
how to use HTML, 30 years ago,

21
00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:16.585
they did not know how we were going
to be using and abusing it today.

22
00:01:16.585 --> 00:01:20.507
[LAUGH] So they could never have predicted
things that were gonna be good ideas and

23
00:01:20.507 --> 00:01:22.329
things that were gonna be bad ideas.

24
00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.278
That's why we're on HTML 5.1 right now,

25
00:01:25.278 --> 00:01:28.778
which means we're on the fifth
major revision of it.

26
00:01:28.778 --> 00:01:31.526
And the .1,
they added a couple more things as well.

27
00:01:31.526 --> 00:01:36.145
So there's a bunch of stuff that
has changed over the years.

28
00:01:36.145 --> 00:01:38.884
So, we'll get a bit more
into that later as well.

29
00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:44.149
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now we're gonna, we'll
talk about divs here in just a second.

30
00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.270
But we're gonna explore a bunch of
different kinds of tags that you should

31
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.832
know about.

32
00:01:47.832 --> 00:01:51.756
These are the, I would deem to
be some of the more useful ones.

33
00:01:51.756 --> 00:01:56.506
So we talked about h1 through h6,
which are headers, or headings rather.

34
00:01:59.815 --> 00:02:02.000
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this,
for example, is an h1.

35
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.215
Or no, this is an h2,
I think right here, this Types of Tags.

36
00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.164
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's gonna be
some sorta heading on the page,

37
00:02:10.164 --> 00:02:12.460
something that you would have at the top,
right?

38
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.843
That's gonna be some sorta title,

39
00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:19.381
some sort of important descriptor
that you want kinda to stand out.

40
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:21.499
That's why this one's bigger, it's bolder.

41
00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:22.580
It's a heading, right?

42
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.585
You're scrolling down, what you're
doing if you come to this page and

43
00:02:25.585 --> 00:02:27.253
you just wanna peruse it really quick.

44
00:02:27.253 --> 00:02:29.898
You're gonna scroll down really quick, and
you're just gonna look at headings, right?

45
00:02:29.898 --> 00:02:31.786
That's kind of what they're for.

46
00:02:34.427 --> 00:02:36.175
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
that's why you have h1 through h6.

47
00:02:36.175 --> 00:02:41.301
On this particular page, this basic HTML,
that's the h1 because that's

48
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:46.205
the most important thing this entire
page is about, Basic HTML, okay?

49
00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:53.180
And then everything underneath that,
these h2's are kinda subheadings in here.

50
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.939
So you can scroll down and just look at
Types of Tabs, and those sorts of things.

51
00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.710
And then if this had headings underneath
it, then you would have an h3, so

52
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.788
on and so forth.

53
00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:09.656
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
just to kinda highlight,

54
00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:13.535
a bunch of these are kinda
they're pretty squishy subjects,

55
00:03:13.535 --> 00:03:16.902
that there's not necessarily
the right way to do it.

56
00:03:16.902 --> 00:03:20.448
I kind of liken it to formatting
a Microsoft Word document.

57
00:03:20.448 --> 00:03:21.927
There's multiple ways to do this.

58
00:03:21.927 --> 00:03:25.937
It's as much artistic
license as it is engineering.

59
00:03:25.937 --> 00:03:30.719
Which you're gonna find a lot throughout
this course, is lot of this is just kinda

60
00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.977
doing your best,
taking the knowledge that you have and

61
00:03:33.977 --> 00:03:36.777
just applying it the best
way that you know how.

62
00:03:36.777 --> 00:03:38.759
That make sense?

63
00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:39.631
Any questions?

64
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:43.921
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

65
00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:52.874
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: p tags, so
p stands for paragraph.

66
00:03:52.874 --> 00:03:57.928
And you'll put paragraphs
of text inside of a p tag.

67
00:03:57.928 --> 00:04:03.236
So up here, this right here,
that little bit, that is a p tag, right?

68
00:04:03.236 --> 00:04:05.671
It's just a paragraph.

69
00:04:05.671 --> 00:04:09.026
And so if you have multiple
paragraphs next to each other,

70
00:04:09.026 --> 00:04:11.087
this is multiple p tags right here.

71
00:04:14.182 --> 00:04:15.012
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that's what it is.

72
00:04:15.012 --> 00:04:18.730
It's just whatever you would
put inside of a paragraph.

73
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.983
So you're gonna use p tags quite a bit.

74
00:04:21.983 --> 00:04:25.178
So only text goes inside of p tags.

75
00:04:25.178 --> 00:04:29.031
So for example,
you can't have a div inside of a p tag.

76
00:04:29.031 --> 00:04:30.952
Or you can't have an h1 inside of a p tag.

77
00:04:30.952 --> 00:04:32.754
Only text ends up going in there.

78
00:04:32.754 --> 00:04:38.015
And some sorta, spans can go in there,
things that describe text.

79
00:04:38.015 --> 00:04:39.793
Which we'll get to spans in just a second.

80
00:04:39.793 --> 00:04:44.163
But there's a bunch of things
that cannot go inside of a p tag.

81
00:04:44.163 --> 00:04:47.563
And what the browser will actually do if
you try to put something inside of there,

82
00:04:47.563 --> 00:04:48.818
it will actually kick it out.

83
00:04:48.818 --> 00:04:50.322
So it looks really weird.

84
00:04:50.322 --> 00:04:52.252
So don't put weird things in there.

85
00:04:52.252 --> 00:04:57.527
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anchor tags,

86
00:04:57.527 --> 00:05:00.154
so that's an a.

87
00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:04.792
These are links, right,
and it stands for anchor.

88
00:05:04.792 --> 00:05:07.132
I can't remember why it stands for anchor.

89
00:05:07.132 --> 00:05:11.020
I don't know why that's the appropriate
term for it, that's just what you call it.

90
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:17.417
[LAUGH] So this link right here,
where you put your pointer over and

91
00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:21.717
it turns to a cursor,
so you can click on it,

92
00:05:21.717 --> 00:05:25.462
that is an anchor tag, that is a link.

93
00:05:25.462 --> 00:05:32.386
So if you look here, so you have the a,
href equals frontendmasters.com, right?

94
00:05:32.386 --> 00:05:35.488
So this href is where it
actually ends up going,

95
00:05:35.488 --> 00:05:38.682
that needs another
quotation mark right there.

96
00:05:38.682 --> 00:05:41.737
Whatever, that's fine.

97
00:05:41.737 --> 00:05:43.374
Then this is the text inside of it.

98
00:05:43.374 --> 00:05:47.616
So you can see here,
this link actually doesn't go anywhere.

99
00:05:47.616 --> 00:05:49.018
But that's what it looks like.

100
00:05:49.018 --> 00:05:55.800
So you use a tags to create links, and
you would link it to some other URL.

101
00:05:57.792 --> 00:06:04.181
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: URL stands for
a Uniform Resource Location, I think.

102
00:06:04.181 --> 00:06:07.769
It's whatever the address is,
the Web address.

103
00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:11.713
So you can see up here, this is the Web
address for this particular page.

104
00:06:11.713 --> 00:06:14.746
That's what would go inside
of here instead of the href.

105
00:06:14.746 --> 00:06:18.194
You would put it in there, and then
the link would take you to that place.

106
00:06:18.194 --> 00:06:19.028
Does that makes sense?

107
00:06:21.533 --> 00:06:23.989
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
I'm seeing mostly head nods, so

108
00:06:23.989 --> 00:06:25.876
I feel pretty good about that.

109
00:06:28.874 --> 00:06:32.384
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That href, this part
right here, is called an attribute.

110
00:06:32.384 --> 00:06:35.550
And that is in the next lesson,
we will talk a lot more about attributes.

111
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:42.779
But basically, you can give additional
information to these tags via attributes.

112
00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:44.108
And again, we will go over that.

113
00:06:44.108 --> 00:06:45.216
We actually have a whole section on it.

114
00:06:45.216 --> 00:06:48.708
So if that doesn't make sense right now,
it's coming.

115
00:06:52.505 --> 00:06:56.323
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Div, okay, so
this is one we had the question about.

116
00:06:56.323 --> 00:06:58.246
It is short for division.

117
00:06:58.246 --> 00:07:02.065
And I like to think of
divs as cardboard boxes.

118
00:07:02.065 --> 00:07:06.208
That it's not actually, the cardboard
box is never the important part, right?

119
00:07:06.208 --> 00:07:08.168
It's actually what's inside
of the cardboard box.

120
00:07:08.168 --> 00:07:11.356
So it's just like a box
that you stick stuff in,

121
00:07:11.356 --> 00:07:14.877
you stick other,
more important things inside of.

122
00:07:14.877 --> 00:07:19.102
A div, in and of itself, has no what
we would call semantic meaning.

123
00:07:19.102 --> 00:07:22.446
It doesn't necessarily mean anything
because it's inside of a div.

124
00:07:22.446 --> 00:07:28.603
It's just kind of a no-name
container that you put stuff into.

125
00:07:28.603 --> 00:07:30.204
Does that makes sense?

126
00:07:30.204 --> 00:07:32.739
It's just,
you're gonna use divs everywhere.

127
00:07:32.739 --> 00:07:36.938
Because there's a lot of times where
you can't really describe anything in

128
00:07:36.938 --> 00:07:37.730
particular.

129
00:07:41.913 --> 00:07:45.419
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You don't need a tag
that has any sorta semantic meaning, so

130
00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:48.803
yeah, it's a generic tag for
grouping things together.

131
00:07:48.803 --> 00:07:52.180
Divs can be really useful with CSS.

132
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.022
And that's in particular where
you're gonna use them a bunch,

133
00:07:55.022 --> 00:07:57.454
just cuz they're really useful for
styling with CSS.

134
00:07:57.454 --> 00:07:59.406
So that's why you'll see those a lot.

135
00:08:01.544 --> 00:08:04.221
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
if you had a blog post kind of thing,

136
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:09.691
you'll kind of group the entire blog
post container into one div, usually.

137
00:08:09.691 --> 00:08:10.927
So yeah, spans.

138
00:08:10.927 --> 00:08:15.745
If a div is a cardboard box,
a span is like a Ziploc bag.

139
00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:17.378
It's like a smaller div.

140
00:08:17.378 --> 00:08:21.218
And you'll have spans
inside of paragraphs.

141
00:08:21.218 --> 00:08:24.958
So if I wanted to highlight this block of
text right there, something like that,

142
00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.773
I would put that inside of a span right?

143
00:08:26.773 --> 00:08:30.271
So it's actually just a small snippet
of whatever you're dealing with.

144
00:08:30.271 --> 00:08:32.202
You can have spans really
inside of anything.

145
00:08:32.202 --> 00:08:33.602
You can have them inside of h1's.

146
00:08:33.602 --> 00:08:36.443
You can have them inside of paragraphs,
inside of divs.

147
00:08:36.443 --> 00:08:37.839
They fit kinda anywhere.

148
00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:43.436
And it's just for this small block of
something, I'm gonna put a span around it.

149
00:08:43.436 --> 00:08:46.109
I don't actually end up
using them a terrible lot,

150
00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:48.981
just not usually that I need
to do something like that.

151
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:53.890
But if I needed to,
that's how I would do it.

152
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:57.757
Okay, so ols and uls.

153
00:08:57.757 --> 00:09:02.548
So ol stands for ordered list,
and ul stands for unordered list.

154
00:09:02.548 --> 00:09:07.735
So what you see here, where I had this
kinda list of tags that I'm talking about,

155
00:09:07.735 --> 00:09:09.507
this is an unordered list.

156
00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:12.517
So it's an unordered list,
because I could swap a and p, and

157
00:09:12.517 --> 00:09:14.592
it doesn't really make any difference.

158
00:09:14.592 --> 00:09:16.130
It doesn't change the meaning of the list.

159
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.146
It's an unordered list.

160
00:09:17.146 --> 00:09:18.918
It's just a list of stuff, and

161
00:09:18.918 --> 00:09:22.270
it doesn't really matter what
order it comes in, right?

162
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.903
So that's why this is an unordered list.

163
00:09:24.903 --> 00:09:28.312
If something was an ordered list,
it would be, if I change the order of it,

164
00:09:28.312 --> 00:09:29.896
it would change the meaning of it.

165
00:09:29.896 --> 00:09:31.395
So for an example,

166
00:09:31.395 --> 00:09:37.125
I have here the list of the ten most
populous cities in the world, right?

167
00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:41.497
I can't switch number one and number two,
or else that list is now incorrect, right?

168
00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:44.057
So that's when you would use an ol,
an ordered list.

169
00:09:44.057 --> 00:09:48.921
So and instead of here, of having bullets,
it would have numbers like one, two,

170
00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:52.670
three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten, so.

171
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.857
ol is ordered list,
ul is unordered list, and

172
00:09:55.857 --> 00:09:59.308
then all of the individual
elements inside of it.

173
00:09:59.308 --> 00:10:03.224
So the span one,
the ol one, the button one,

174
00:10:03.224 --> 00:10:07.779
these are li's,
they're list elements, right?

175
00:10:07.779 --> 00:10:12.244
So it's one individual entry inside
of the ol or inside of the ul.

176
00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:14.243
So you can see here, I have an example.

177
00:10:16.494 --> 00:10:18.904
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is a ul, so
it would be an unordered list.

178
00:10:18.904 --> 00:10:20.500
The ul ends here.

179
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:26.615
And I have one li here, another li here,
another li here, right?

180
00:10:26.615 --> 00:10:31.598
So you'll have an opening ul or ol,
and then you'll have a bunch of li's.

181
00:10:31.598 --> 00:10:34.895
And then you're gonna close your ul or
ol, just like that.

182
00:10:34.895 --> 00:10:36.111
Any questions about that?

183
00:10:38.789 --> 00:10:41.595
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's useful for
making lists of things.

184
00:10:41.595 --> 00:10:42.393
Buttons.

185
00:10:43.906 --> 00:10:45.636
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: A button is a button.

186
00:10:45.636 --> 00:10:48.636
It's very self descriptive
in this particular case,

187
00:10:48.636 --> 00:10:50.337
kinda hard to forget that one.

188
00:10:50.337 --> 00:10:55.397
Buttons, in and of themselves,
do not do anything out of the box, right?

189
00:10:55.397 --> 00:10:58.105
You don't put a button on the page and
it just suddenly does something.

190
00:10:58.105 --> 00:11:02.307
So usually this is for some,
it's a hook for JavaScript, right?

191
00:11:02.307 --> 00:11:05.777
It puts a button on the page, and
people know how to click buttons.

192
00:11:05.777 --> 00:11:08.658
It's one of those things that you look at,
and you instantly know what to do with it.

193
00:11:08.658 --> 00:11:14.589
And then you'll use JavaScript to respond
to a user clicking a button, right?

194
00:11:14.589 --> 00:11:19.381
So you'll put a button on a page, and
then later you'll attach JavaScript to it,

195
00:11:19.381 --> 00:11:21.610
to make it do something when clicked.

196
00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.739
That make sense?

197
00:11:23.739 --> 00:11:27.462
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you add anything for
accessibility within the button tag?

198
00:11:27.462 --> 00:11:30.890
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, you don't actually
have to, which is really nice.

199
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.862
That's another good reason
to use a button tag,

200
00:11:33.862 --> 00:11:37.575
is that the screen readers
already know to look for buttons.

201
00:11:37.575 --> 00:11:39.303
Cuz they know that
they're really important,

202
00:11:39.303 --> 00:11:41.080
and that that's how you
interact with the site.

203
00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.961
And I'm happy you bring that up.

204
00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:46.363
Because you can actually, there's
no reason you have to use a button.

205
00:11:46.363 --> 00:11:49.597
You can put a div there, and
you can make it work the same way.

206
00:11:49.597 --> 00:11:51.369
But a screen reader would not find a div,

207
00:11:51.369 --> 00:11:53.570
because a screen reader's not looking for
divs.

208
00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:54.591
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

209
00:11:54.591 --> 00:11:56.858
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
that's another good reason to use buttons,

210
00:11:56.858 --> 00:11:59.647
because screen readers already
know what to do with them.

211
00:11:59.647 --> 00:12:00.700
Good question.

212
00:12:02.361 --> 00:12:03.256
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Other questions?

213
00:12:07.731 --> 00:12:11.278
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so
let's just go up here in just a second, so

214
00:12:11.278 --> 00:12:13.840
you can see what a button looks like.

215
00:12:15.833 --> 00:12:22.465
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: &lt;button&gt;Click me.

216
00:12:22.465 --> 00:12:26.357
So if you don't do anything,
the button just looks like this, right?

217
00:12:26.357 --> 00:12:27.529
It looks very clickable.

218
00:12:27.529 --> 00:12:31.664
It's something like, when you click on it,
it depresses a little bit, right?

219
00:12:31.664 --> 00:12:35.437
So out of the box,
it already looks like a button.

220
00:12:35.437 --> 00:12:36.933
It looks like something you can click.

221
00:12:39.557 --> 00:12:41.873
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Later, we'll be able
to see how to style it different,

222
00:12:41.873 --> 00:12:44.601
make it look different,
make it look nicer and things like that.

223
00:12:44.601 --> 00:12:48.573
But also you kinda wanna
keep this aesthetic mostly,

224
00:12:48.573 --> 00:12:53.970
because that's what people expect
when they're looking for buttons.

225
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.683
And you wanna make your site
as intuitive as possible.
