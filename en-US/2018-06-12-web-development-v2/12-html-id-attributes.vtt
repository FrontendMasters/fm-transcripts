00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.390
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: IDs are far
less useful than classes,

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.870
to the point that I rarely
find myself using the IDs.

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:12.530
In ID you only have one of one ID in
a page, whereas I have multiple post here,

4
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.480
if I go down here towards to have my
ID right here, house metaphors post.

5
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.147
So if I make an ID for
something, you need to guarantee

6
00:00:27.147 --> 00:00:31.443
that that's the only one
of those on the page.

7
00:00:31.443 --> 00:00:35.338
And you use IDs for relatively
the same reason that you use classes,

8
00:00:35.338 --> 00:00:37.744
that you want to target them for styling.

9
00:00:37.744 --> 00:00:39.599
And you want to target them for
JavaScript but it's basically like.

10
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.530
You know a big flashing neon signs, like
this one right here is a housing metaphor

11
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.740
ID, and so I need to guarantee that
that's the only one on the page.

12
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.500
The reason why that's far less useful is
because by definition it's not reusable,

13
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.360
I can't reuse that because I
can only have one of those.

14
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.170
And as a program where I'm striving to
write less code, I'm striving to like

15
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.190
write this post styling, and
then reuse it a bunch of different times.

16
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.090
So therefore am stealing away from IDs
because I can only use those ones,

17
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.060
does that make sense?

18
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.110
There's kind of like
a legacy product as well,

19
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.720
like I think they were
somehow used previously,

20
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.329
and these days we kind of recognize it's
better to write things using classes.

21
00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:30.729
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And ideally, you want
IDs to not only be the only one on

22
00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.860
the webpage, but you want it to
be the only one on your site.

23
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.616
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Would one instance be
if you're assigning javascript to

24
00:01:42.616 --> 00:01:44.580
a specific Identifier.

25
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.190
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, that would be
probably the most common way to use an ID.

26
00:01:52.730 --> 00:02:02.630
Even then,
you could still use classes though.

27
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.819
So some people will tell you
absolutely never ever use IDs.

28
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.100
I'm not gonna go that far.

29
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.170
I will say that IDs are sledgehammers,

30
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.080
and so therefore most problems that we
have as programmers require more like,

31
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.180
you know, small, normal carpenter hammers.

32
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.720
However, there are problems
that require sledgehammers,

33
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.350
that's why sledgehammers exist.

34
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.026
[LAUGH] Like, we have IDs,
they are occasionally useful for things.

35
00:02:29.026 --> 00:02:33.980
That, so don't throw it away,

36
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.460
don't say I'm never, ever going to use
this, just very, very sparingly if ever.

37
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.630
So I don't, I cannot remember
the last time that I've use IDs but

38
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.740
I introduced some to you because
you will see documentation has a,

39
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.000
you will see bad code that
has that It's important for

40
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.530
you to know what they are,
but don't use them very much.

41
00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.770
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions about that?

42
00:03:02.271 --> 00:03:03.517
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

43
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.956
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So yeah, it looks something
like this that you would say, notice that

44
00:03:10.956 --> 00:03:17.420
the house metaphors post, this ID name is
very specific to what I'm talking about.

45
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.190
This is very much, like when not
to overextend house metaphors, and

46
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.700
notice that my class,
which is post, is very generic.

47
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.730
So they're on opposite
sides of the spectrum,

48
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.090
that IDs strive to be very specific
about what you're talking about.

49
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.770
And post strive to be as generic as
possible for that particular item.

50
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.700
So this is the most generic thing that I
could call this little container right

51
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.090
here, is a post.

52
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.374
That's why I called it that,

53
00:03:43.374 --> 00:03:49.200
because you want that bit of styling
to be as reusable as possible.

54
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.159
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You meant class,
because you said you want post to be as.

55
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.150
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes, so
post the class, yeah, thank you.

56
00:04:00.395 --> 00:04:01.501
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes.

57
00:04:04.246 --> 00:04:07.582
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Other questions?

58
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.687
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So things can have ids and
classes, things can have multiple classes,

59
00:04:17.687 --> 00:04:19.800
that's fine too.

60
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.000
So maybe this is a featured post or
something like that,

61
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.870
and I would make that have additional
style or something like that.

62
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.330
So you can have multiple
classes of the same thing,

63
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.146
you cannot have multiple IDs,
you can only have one ID.

64
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.459
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You will often see
things having multiple classes,

65
00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:41.630
that's very common.

66
00:04:50.297 --> 00:04:56.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Something that IDs are
useful for, they are useful for linking.

67
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.580
So, for example, if I wanted to link
someone to this particular section

68
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.870
of this particular page,
I actually put this here on purpose so

69
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.160
if you wanted to share this link.

70
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.580
If I click on this,
notice it takes me directly to an IDs.

71
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.540
Are the ID section, and
like scrolls me down to that point.

72
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.400
So if I open this in the new tab and

73
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.820
I paste it right there, it's gonna
take me directly to the ID section.

74
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.370
That's what IDs are actually
quite useful for,

75
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.750
is they allow you to deep link
directly to that point in the page, so

76
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.300
if I go back here and
inspect the element here.

77
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.820
Notice the ID here, IDs which
that's actually kind of a bad one,

78
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.470
I think that's more confusing
that it needs to be.

79
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.870
But let's look at the classes one.

80
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.110
Inspect element, so you can see here
the idea is called classes, and

81
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.600
then you can see up here in the URL,
it's a found classes.

82
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.470
So, it takes you to directly to that ID,
which is this corresponds to

83
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:16.199
whatever comes here after the found,
the hash, whatever you wanna call that.

84
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.850
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Does it make sense?

85
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.650
So that is one case that you would
definitely use ID's for, is deep linking.

86
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.800
And that's why it makes sense that
you would only have one on the page,

87
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.640
because there's only one place
that the browser can navigate to.

88
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:42.138
So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you can say here,

89
00:06:42.138 --> 00:06:46.730
if you click this link right here,
it will take you to this h1 right here.

90
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.775
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The navigator or
the header covers it but

91
00:06:51.775 --> 00:06:54.970
It's navigating to the top of the page.

92
00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.210
Any question so far?

93
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So I have one.

94
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.125
Besides like you said class
you can use multiple sign, or

95
00:07:10.125 --> 00:07:13.720
term on a page ID you can
only use one term per page.

96
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.785
But does it have any meaning,

97
00:07:15.785 --> 00:07:19.760
I mean, When I write ID,
does it have any meaning for it?

98
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.120
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Does it
have any meaning for it?

99
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Cuz I wanna see the word ID,
I keep thinking like ID interup,

100
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.655
identification
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right,

101
00:07:29.655 --> 00:07:31.480
that's what it means.

102
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.420
So it's like, it's a unique ID,
it's a unique identifier for

103
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.890
that particular element on a page.

104
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.090
Does that make sense?

105
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:39.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

106
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:41.470
Yeah.
