&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I want you to take,
maybe, a couple of minutes here, two or

2
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.140
three or max.

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.087
Don't look at the answer down here.

4
00:00:09.087 --> 00:00:12.000
And I want you to go through this
convoluted mess that I made for

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.790
you on purpose.

6
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.485
[LAUGH] This is bad
programming on purpose.

7
00:00:14.485 --> 00:00:17.183
And I want you to kinda figure out,
it's like, okay, that looks like it should

8
00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.377
work, that should work,
that won't work, this should work.
