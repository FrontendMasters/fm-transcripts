WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.436
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now I have this really
cool calculator project I wanna share

2
00:00:02.436 --> 00:00:03.076
with the world.

3
00:00:03.076 --> 00:00:04.649
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go to

4
00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:10.451
GitHub.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: To me it's gonna take

5
00:00:10.451 --> 00:00:13.736
me directly to a logged in page because
I have logged into my GitHub account.

6
00:00:13.736 --> 00:00:16.754
But you should sign up for
Git if you have not already, GitHub.

7
00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:18.530
Just so you know what that looks like.

8
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.047
I'm gonna open this in
a anonymous browser.

9
00:00:23.047 --> 00:00:26.340
And this is what it looks like, you
should pick a username and have an email,

10
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.860
etc, etc.

11
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.546
Once you get here, I want you to
click the plus sign up here and say,

12
00:00:31.546 --> 00:00:35.892
New Repository, okay?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

13
00:00:35.892 --> 00:00:40.538
we're gonna call it the fpm-example,
Frontend Masters, and

14
00:00:40.538 --> 00:00:46.381
this is an example.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

15
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:53.362
I'm gonna create a public repository.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: As for

16
00:00:53.362 --> 00:00:58.944
the intro to web dev.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, public repository.

17
00:00:58.944 --> 00:01:00.130
I'm going to ignore the README.

18
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.501
You have to be a premium member
to get private repositories,

19
00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:07.675
but don't be afraid of putting public
repositories out that are garbage.

20
00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:12.702
If you look at mine, I have 100 repos and
above, 75 of them are garbage.

21
00:01:12.702 --> 00:01:15.160
So that's fine, it's okay.

22
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.839
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So,

23
00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:21.071
how do someone going
into your GitHub account.

24
00:01:21.071 --> 00:01:25.702
That's wanting to offer you a job,
potential and flare,

25
00:01:25.702 --> 00:01:28.537
how do the model through the garbage

26
00:01:28.537 --> 00:01:31.852
versus what's actually good?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think people would have

27
00:01:31.852 --> 00:01:32.676
different opinions on it.

28
00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:34.949
So you have pin repositories.

29
00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:42.647
So if you go to my like page right here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is my profile page.

30
00:01:42.647 --> 00:01:43.892
Look at that beautiful smile.

31
00:01:43.892 --> 00:01:47.630
[LAUGH] These are the ones
that I'm more proud of.

32
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.690
So these ones I've
pinned to my repository.

33
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.343
Anything else is like I have, you have no
guarantees that it's gonna be anything

34
00:01:53.343 --> 00:01:59.620
good.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

35
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.147
so I'm gonna say create a repository,
I'm not gonna check that.

36
00:02:02.147 --> 00:02:04.678
So I'm gonna create this repository.

37
00:02:04.678 --> 00:02:07.227
Repository is like one atomic project.

38
00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:10.854
So that's what they call them,
is repositories, or repos, often,

39
00:02:10.854 --> 00:02:14.529
okay?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here, what I'm gonna do,

40
00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.452
is I'm gonna come here, and
I'm just going to copy this command right

41
00:02:17.452 --> 00:02:21.609
here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It doesn't get in remote at

42
00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:26.056
origin git, so a remote is,
Git is decentralized.

43
00:02:26.056 --> 00:02:28.338
So if you and
I were working on the same project,

44
00:02:28.338 --> 00:02:30.632
in theory we don't have
to go through a server.

45
00:02:30.632 --> 00:02:33.190
I could push to your computer.

46
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.817
Most people don't use it like that,

47
00:02:34.817 --> 00:02:37.290
most people have a centralized
place to put their code.

48
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.268
But you don't necessarily have to.

49
00:02:38.268 --> 00:02:41.491
That's why there's this concept of remote,
it's because you could have

50
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:44.510
multiple people and your all push in
to each other and stuff like that,

51
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.062
it's just not very common, okay?

52
00:02:46.062 --> 00:02:49.476
So git remote at origin,
then I'm gonna add this

53
00:02:49.476 --> 00:02:54.038
URL right there.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

54
00:02:54.038 --> 00:02:56.904
I'm gonna say that, okay?

55
00:02:56.904 --> 00:03:02.429
So now if I say git remote -vv,
you can see that I have this new remote to

56
00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:09.014
push to, so it's a place to push my code.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

57
00:03:09.014 --> 00:03:12.702
what I'm gonna do now is cuz I
have commits to push, right?

58
00:03:12.702 --> 00:03:17.337
I'm gonna say git push origin master.

59
00:03:17.337 --> 00:03:18.842
Master is the name of the branch.

60
00:03:18.842 --> 00:03:21.635
If you wanna learn more about
branching and stuff like that,

61
00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:25.050
definitely go check out Nina's course or
read another tutorial on this.

62
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.315
But right now we haven't
branched off with anything and

63
00:03:28.315 --> 00:03:30.759
the default name of the branch is Master.

64
00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.430
It's the master branch, right?

65
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.069
It's the overall master of the project.

66
00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.894
So I'm gonna say git push origin master,
and

67
00:03:37.894 --> 00:03:41.827
its gonna take my code and
push it up to GitHub.

68
00:03:41.827 --> 00:03:46.766
So now, if you go here and refresh the
page, you can see that I have this repo.

69
00:03:46.766 --> 00:03:50.286
And you can click in here and
you see my calculator.js and

70
00:03:50.286 --> 00:03:56.947
all that kinda stuff.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

71
00:03:56.947 --> 00:03:59.085
definitely keep all of your
code on GitHub, I do for sure.

72
00:03:59.085 --> 00:04:02.767
It's really nice because if I ever lose
my laptop, which I have done before,

73
00:04:02.767 --> 00:04:03.912
I can get it off GitHub.

74
00:04:03.912 --> 00:04:07.230
If I wanna like collaborate with you,
you can click up here and fork.

75
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.598
Which is the name of like,
I'm interested in modifying your code for

76
00:04:12.598 --> 00:04:17.489
my purposes or I wanna improve your codes
so that I can use it or things like that.

77
00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.552
You fork it so that you can modify,
because you can't come in and

78
00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:23.070
change my code,
you have to ask me to change my code.

79
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.350
But if you fork it,
you can modify your own copy of it.

80
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.469
That's what forking is.

81
00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:30.675
You can also come in here and star it,
which is like a social feature.

82
00:04:30.675 --> 00:04:32.937
I think this is neat, star, right?

83
00:04:32.937 --> 00:04:37.673
And then you can watch it as well which
is a way of like if you're interested in

84
00:04:37.673 --> 00:04:40.570
like the progress of a repo,
you can watch it.

85
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:47.200
It will give you notifications.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sense?

86
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.737
So I would say this is like the modern
programmers resume, is what their GitHub

87
00:04:51.737 --> 00:04:57.538
looks like.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

88
00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:04.123
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Pull request.

89
00:05:04.123 --> 00:05:07.326
So let's say I find a bug, right?

90
00:05:07.326 --> 00:05:11.498
For example, you find a typo with this
particular course on this course website,

91
00:05:11.498 --> 00:05:13.560
which there are a lot, I've seen them.

92
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.632
[LAUGH] If you go to
mygithub/bthold/intrawebdevv2,

93
00:05:17.632 --> 00:05:22.310
that's where all of the code for
this particular website lives.

94
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.630
It lives here, right?

95
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.891
So if you come in here as like,
hey this is broken, you can even see here.

96
00:05:30.891 --> 00:05:33.870
People have been opening
pull requests today.

97
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.594
Thank you to the people who have
been opening pull requests.

98
00:05:35.594 --> 00:05:39.790
So if I click on here and
I say, fix typos on line 64.

99
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.744
Good person.

100
00:05:42.744 --> 00:05:46.543
So I can see that Brandon, thanks Brandon.

101
00:05:46.543 --> 00:05:49.058
Notice that these edits
might be needing makes here.

102
00:05:49.058 --> 00:05:50.684
So he fixed some of the repos, so

103
00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:53.860
I can actually go in here and
see the commits that he has made.

104
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.887
So I can go here and see what is changed.

105
00:05:56.887 --> 00:06:01.886
So here I said image instead of imagine,
so he fixed that cuz he read my mind.

106
00:06:01.886 --> 00:06:07.187
And I'm pretty sure three has two Hs,
Brandon.

107
00:06:07.187 --> 00:06:10.780
So I'll let it slide this time but, yeah.

108
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.388
So obviously these are useful things,
I should fix these.

109
00:06:13.388 --> 00:06:16.431
So what I'm gonna do right now is I'm
gonna come over here and I'm just gonna

110
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:19.585
say merge pull request, because his code
is valid and it should be in the repo.

111
00:06:19.585 --> 00:06:21.684
So I said merge pull request and

112
00:06:21.684 --> 00:06:25.097
confirm merge.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now,

113
00:06:25.097 --> 00:06:29.195
my repo is updated with his changes,
it's all merged together.

114
00:06:29.195 --> 00:06:33.578
And I'm gonna say thank you.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

115
00:06:33.578 --> 00:06:34.530
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I can spell.

116
00:06:38.173 --> 00:06:38.932
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's how

117
00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:41.914
the process works for
incorporating new code, right?

118
00:06:41.914 --> 00:06:44.061
So what he did is he forked it,
he modified it and

119
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:46.065
he opened what's called the pull request.

120
00:06:46.065 --> 00:06:47.734
And then I looked at his pull request and

121
00:06:47.734 --> 00:06:51.364
I merged it into my code.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Does he work with you or

122
00:06:51.364 --> 00:06:53.922
is that just for fun?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: He's just a nice person,

123
00:06:53.922 --> 00:06:56.426
I've never met Brandon.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: He's a first time

124
00:06:56.426 --> 00:07:00.180
contributor.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: To this repo.

125
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.792
Yeah [LAUGH].
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

126
00:07:04.792 --> 00:07:06.471
really cool right though?

127
00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:10.210
It's collaborative,
we get to make all this stuff together.

128
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.437
And there's just nice people out there
doing things because they're nice

129
00:07:12.437 --> 00:07:17.667
people.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But

130
00:07:17.667 --> 00:07:18.771
that's the promise of Open Source, right?

131
00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:21.606
Like I'm putting all
this stuff out there for

132
00:07:21.606 --> 00:07:24.600
free and
in return people make it better for me.

133
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.176
So that's kinda of your reward for
putting stuff out there for free.

134
00:07:29.176 --> 00:07:33.732
It's because other people get to see,
it's okay, if you do it this way,

135
00:07:33.732 --> 00:07:35.540
it gets better.

136
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.648
In fact,
I put out a little thing here called,

137
00:07:38.648 --> 00:07:43.591
if I go back to my profile.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Called post

138
00:07:43.591 --> 00:07:47.758
CSS color blind, which is a little
repo for changing your website to

139
00:07:47.758 --> 00:07:51.796
see whether a color blind person
would see your website, right?

140
00:07:51.796 --> 00:07:56.358
So down here you can see
example of here is how your CSS

141
00:07:56.358 --> 00:08:00.270
would look if you
are normal seeing person.

142
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:05.455
This is what it would look like if
you had this particular disability.

143
00:08:05.455 --> 00:08:07.816
And here is what it would like if
you can't see any color, right?

144
00:08:07.816 --> 00:08:11.224
So this was something I threw together on
a weekend because I was curious if I could

145
00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:12.136
do it, really cool.

146
00:08:12.136 --> 00:08:15.078
And then, I just got busy and
I couldn't update it.

147
00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:19.286
There's an awesome guy named Ben Briggs
who works on post CSS, itself.

148
00:08:19.286 --> 00:08:23.944
And he came in and fixed all of my stuff
for me, and opened a giant pull request,

149
00:08:23.944 --> 00:08:25.867
and fixed everything, right?

150
00:08:25.867 --> 00:08:28.869
So these kinda things happen like
if you invest in a community,

151
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:30.286
the community invest in you,

152
00:08:30.286 --> 00:08:34.691
which I think it's really cool.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In particular I think

153
00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:35.969
the JavaScript community
is pretty friendly.

154
00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:40.174
So it's something that's you should
definitely try and get into.

155
00:08:40.174 --> 00:08:43.111
And don't have a lot of fear,
just go out and open pull requests and

156
00:08:43.111 --> 00:08:46.018
sometimes they'll say hey,
if you fix this then I'll merge it.

157
00:08:46.018 --> 00:08:50.638
Or sometimes they'll say,
I'm not going in this direction, so

158
00:08:50.638 --> 00:08:53.914
thanks for opening it but
I'm going this way.

159
00:08:53.914 --> 00:08:56.810
Or you can see here if you
go back to my other repo.

160
00:08:59.475 --> 00:09:00.548
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: People open issues,

161
00:09:00.548 --> 00:09:03.296
so this person says hey,
I'm getting a lot of issues.

162
00:09:03.296 --> 00:09:06.813
I'm seeing these kinda things and
I can come down here and

163
00:09:06.813 --> 00:09:09.020
say, maybe try this, right?

164
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.504
So that's what issues are, they're just
saying, hey, I don't know why this is

165
00:09:12.504 --> 00:09:15.199
working or this is broken or
maybe you should add this feature.

166
00:09:15.199 --> 00:09:18.430
It's kind of collaboration on
the future of your projects.

167
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.777
So GitHub is great.

168
00:09:20.777 --> 00:09:22.740
You should definitely get in on it.

169
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.265
It doesn't, I mean there's also GitLab,
there's also Bitbucket,

170
00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:27.961
there are several places
you can put your code.

171
00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:33.948
There's Visual Studios Team Services which
is the Microsoft version of it as well,

172
00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:39.905
so.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I have a quick question.

173
00:09:39.905 --> 00:09:40.695
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure.

174
00:09:40.695 --> 00:09:41.725
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So with all this,

175
00:09:41.725 --> 00:09:43.169
how it's open sourced,

176
00:09:43.169 --> 00:09:47.857
it's really nice because then everyone
can get together and work on something.

177
00:09:47.857 --> 00:09:52.457
But with the ability to fork it,
what's to stop somebody,

178
00:09:52.457 --> 00:09:56.250
what if I work on something for
ten hours, okay?

179
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.694
And I put it on GitHub and
I'm really proud of it and

180
00:09:59.694 --> 00:10:02.245
gonna show it to a future boss maybe.

181
00:10:02.245 --> 00:10:04.673
What's to stop somebody from
forking it and being like ha ha,

182
00:10:04.673 --> 00:10:07.474
this is mine, I did this?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The answer to your question

183
00:10:07.474 --> 00:10:11.770
is nothing, but there are kind of
things you can do to put in place.

184
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.389
So for example,

185
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:20.226
something that I do if you come here
to intro to web dev and you look here.

186
00:10:20.226 --> 00:10:25.380
I did put license on this, so
you can put legal license to your project.

187
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.383
This one in particular is
attribution non-commercial.

188
00:10:28.383 --> 00:10:31.424
So I spent a ton of time on
this particular course and

189
00:10:31.424 --> 00:10:36.160
it would be really crappy if someone
else made a lot of money off of it.

190
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.174
So this code and this content you can
share for free forever to everyone.

191
00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:45.160
But if you make money off of it,
I can sue you, right?

192
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.567
So you can attach license to things,
so that's your retribution.

193
00:10:48.567 --> 00:10:51.967
Most people, so
the code that I have on this, so

194
00:10:51.967 --> 00:10:55.716
the content is licensed
differently than the code.

195
00:10:55.716 --> 00:10:59.504
The code is Apache 2.0 and
that's, you can modify this,

196
00:10:59.504 --> 00:11:02.360
you can say that I wrote this,
I don't care.

197
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.609
I actually really don't care.

198
00:11:03.609 --> 00:11:05.612
I spent a bunch of time
on writing the code but

199
00:11:05.612 --> 00:11:07.354
that's not the important part to me.

200
00:11:07.354 --> 00:11:11.293
So for the most part, all the codes that
I put out into the world, you are free to

201
00:11:11.293 --> 00:11:15.033
fork, bastardize, claim, make money
off of all these things are fine.

202
00:11:15.033 --> 00:11:16.191
The only thing you can't do is sue me.

203
00:11:16.191 --> 00:11:20.041
[LAUGH] And
that's what these license provide for you.

204
00:11:20.041 --> 00:11:23.450
So then I wanna answer that
your question in multiple ways.

205
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.195
It's you can't do things to prevent
people from forking your code.

206
00:11:26.195 --> 00:11:29.116
You can actually disable the Fork
button on here as well, if you want to.

207
00:11:29.116 --> 00:11:34.203
They can still get it but,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's

208
00:11:34.203 --> 00:11:35.564
a sharing environment, right?

209
00:11:35.564 --> 00:11:40.956
So I make a lot of money at my job working
on top of things that people have built,

210
00:11:40.956 --> 00:11:41.540
right?

211
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.940
Like I work on Linux a ton,
which is the work of a ton of people, and

212
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.650
I don't pay them anything, right?

213
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:53.446
So the only thing I can do to pay
that community back is to release

214
00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:55.445
things that I do for free.

215
00:11:55.445 --> 00:11:59.390
So whenever I can I open source,
cuz I believe in the community,

216
00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:02.028
I believe that it moves humanity forward.

217
00:12:02.028 --> 00:12:04.555
As cheezy as that sounds.

218
00:12:04.555 --> 00:12:08.072
Does that answer your question?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Other

219
00:12:08.072 --> 00:12:10.666
questions?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: How do you go about

220
00:12:10.666 --> 00:12:14.472
getting a license?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can go to

221
00:12:14.472 --> 00:12:19.611
choosingalicense.com.

222
00:12:19.611 --> 00:12:26.779
Choosealisence.com, which is also from
GitHub, they put up this website.

223
00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:30.490
I want simple permissive,
it's gonna give you the MIT license.

224
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:33.760
If I'm concerned about patents which is, I
always do this one, personally Apache 2.0.

225
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.772
And I care about sharing.

226
00:12:36.772 --> 00:12:40.449
So you might be more interested in
something like this, which is you can fork

227
00:12:40.449 --> 00:12:44.370
this and you can modify it but
you have to open source anything you do.

228
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.699
Legally you have to open source it.

229
00:12:45.699 --> 00:12:49.836
You can close source anything with mine,
so that's why I always choose Apache 2.0.

230
00:12:49.836 --> 00:12:54.299
But if you Fork Bash for example,
which is what we've been using,

231
00:12:54.299 --> 00:12:59.255
you're actually legally obligated to
open source any changes you make.

232
00:12:59.255 --> 00:13:03.054
I'm not a lawyer so do not take
any advice from me whatsoever, but

233
00:13:03.054 --> 00:13:08.444
that is my understanding thereof.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's

234
00:13:08.444 --> 00:13:10.180
more choices down here
if you're interested.

235
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.926
But these are kind of the three
common ones that I see.

236
00:13:12.926 --> 00:13:15.941
I don't actually really see
very many people do copyleft,

237
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:17.699
which is what you would call this.

238
00:13:17.699 --> 00:13:21.353
I see most people do MIT, and
I think Apache is a superior license, so

239
00:13:21.353 --> 00:13:24.260
I personally choose that,
but MIT is far more common.
