WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.671
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is how you would
deploy this application to the cloud.

2
00:00:02.671 --> 00:00:06.396
And you could do this during,
using Microsoft Azure, and

3
00:00:06.396 --> 00:00:09.979
I go literally step by step
here of how you would do that.

4
00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:12.790
I'm not gonna do that for you right now,
but definitely go check it out.

5
00:00:17.194 --> 00:00:20.991
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can actually even
deploy directly from VSCode which is A+,

6
00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:22.196
it's really easy.

7
00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:22.765
Do I have it in.

8
00:00:24.696 --> 00:00:25.528
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, anyway.

9
00:00:27.978 --> 00:00:31.258
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anyone have questions
about deploying before I actually

10
00:00:31.258 --> 00:00:33.247
move on to just wrap up the course?

11
00:00:33.247 --> 00:00:37.858
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well,
we find more information on this,

12
00:00:37.858 --> 00:00:42.734
in the previous course
that you mentioned by

13
00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:48.028
the same person who was
doing like a full stack.

14
00:00:48.028 --> 00:00:51.752
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Jim does have,
he talks a lot about how to deploy code.

15
00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:54.123
So mine shows you how to do it to Azure.

16
00:00:54.123 --> 00:00:56.590
His shows you how to
do it to DigitalOcean.

17
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.863
So it's actually probably good
to look at both of those.

18
00:00:57.863 --> 00:01:02.270
And there's another about working
with Amazon as well, right?

19
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.790
So who wrote that course?

20
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.368
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't remember.

21
00:01:06.368 --> 00:01:09.750
There's another Frontend Masters course
about deploying to Amazon as well.

22
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.081
They're all slightly different.

23
00:01:11.081 --> 00:01:14.678
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, so what you're saying
is that this is like basically what we

24
00:01:14.678 --> 00:01:16.686
need to know in order to do the thing.

25
00:01:16.686 --> 00:01:17.569
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's not

26
00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:20.829
an extended other day course
that we would need to.

27
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.212
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's a deep subject,
I mean there's a whole job that does that,

28
00:01:25.212 --> 00:01:26.460
which is DevOps, right?

29
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.463
But this will get it out there and
working in production.

30
00:01:29.463 --> 00:01:30.835
Yeah, for sure.

31
00:01:30.835 --> 00:01:32.540
This is the first step.

32
00:01:34.362 --> 00:01:36.201
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The complete first step for
sure.

33
00:01:39.793 --> 00:01:44.257
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
let's wrap this up a little bit.

34
00:01:44.257 --> 00:01:48.897
So congratulations, you made up through
this like this is a grueling course

35
00:01:48.897 --> 00:01:51.442
like I dumped a bunch of knowledge on you.

36
00:01:51.442 --> 00:01:54.400
So the fact that you like
still upright in a chair or

37
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.755
mostly upright in a chair
[LAUGH] someone just fell over.

38
00:01:57.755 --> 00:02:01.806
[LAUGH] Is it's an accomplishment
like this is tough stuff.

39
00:02:01.806 --> 00:02:04.400
As soon a lot of people give
up way before this point.

40
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.280
So I know this is tough like I wrote it,
so I know how tough this was,

41
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.299
and I did not go easy on you.

42
00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.974
But I wanted you to understand all
the different concepts that are like

43
00:02:13.974 --> 00:02:14.617
the base level.

44
00:02:14.617 --> 00:02:17.694
And if you definitely have
the base level knowledge now, for

45
00:02:17.694 --> 00:02:19.214
being a frontend developer.

46
00:02:19.214 --> 00:02:22.648
So you are prepared definitely to go
into something like a boot camp without

47
00:02:22.648 --> 00:02:23.637
some interest deal.

48
00:02:23.637 --> 00:02:26.781
You're definitely in a place that
you go on to do more courses and

49
00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:27.896
on Frontend Masters.

50
00:02:27.896 --> 00:02:31.025
You're definitely in a place
that you can teach yourself and

51
00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:33.070
eventually get a job doing this.

52
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.074
So congratulations you're
more than halfway there.

53
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.024
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What's hard about web
development is that you have to understand

54
00:02:41.024 --> 00:02:42.572
a lot of things in order to just start.

55
00:02:42.572 --> 00:02:47.011
It's kinda like trying to like learn a new
language where you have to understand

56
00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:51.469
a bunch of grammar before you can even
start speaking to someone which is tough.

57
00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:56.320
So I got a bunch of advice for you,
the other thing that I wanted to point

58
00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.864
out here, a lot of times it's just
knowing the vocabulary to Google,

59
00:03:00.864 --> 00:03:02.577
that's half the battle.

60
00:03:02.577 --> 00:03:05.560
So if you know how to Google something,
that means you know how to learn it.

61
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.074
So hopefully this gave you a whole bunch
of new vocabulary to Google answers to

62
00:03:10.074 --> 00:03:11.122
your questions.

63
00:03:13.336 --> 00:03:15.647
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So my final advice for
you, always ask questions.

64
00:03:15.647 --> 00:03:19.325
If you get a job doing this, ask the
people around you until they're annoyed

65
00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:21.178
with you, and then keep asking them.

66
00:03:21.178 --> 00:03:23.600
And I'm not actually joking about that.

67
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.773
Ask so
many questions that you annoy yourself.

68
00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:28.753
Because you will learn so much faster,

69
00:03:28.753 --> 00:03:31.757
what we'll take you three hours
to figure out by yourself.

70
00:03:31.757 --> 00:03:33.860
Someone can just say,
yeah, you do it this way.

71
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.270
It can save you so much time.

72
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.246
You will be a much better engineer.

73
00:03:37.246 --> 00:03:40.690
I still has dumb questions all the time,
believe me.

74
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.376
I'm like asking address here and

75
00:03:42.376 --> 00:03:46.419
to some of the people the I worked with is
like Brian asked dumb shit all the time.

76
00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.670
[LAUGH] It's okay.

77
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.646
Please ask tons and
tons of questions, okay?

78
00:03:51.646 --> 00:03:54.132
Google everything and
then Google it again when you forget it.

79
00:03:54.132 --> 00:03:57.385
[LAUGH] I probably said that like six or
seven times over the course of this.

80
00:03:57.385 --> 00:04:01.009
It's because I've heard so
many new engineers say,

81
00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:06.495
like I feel like it's cheating to Google
things, and it's just not true at all.

82
00:04:06.495 --> 00:04:10.835
Don't burn out, it's really with these
kinda things that are really difficult to

83
00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:12.448
just go out in a flame of glory.

84
00:04:12.448 --> 00:04:17.183
And when you truly, truly burn out,
which I have before, once.

85
00:04:17.183 --> 00:04:21.808
I would open my computer and feel
panic because I was so stressed and so

86
00:04:21.808 --> 00:04:24.622
sick of sitting in front of the computer.

87
00:04:24.622 --> 00:04:29.080
So if you get there, it takes
a really long time to unravel that.

88
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.845
So recognize like when you're like
approaching to a point where you like

89
00:04:32.845 --> 00:04:34.766
really can't handle this anymore.

90
00:04:34.766 --> 00:04:37.881
Close your laptop, go outside,
go do something fun,

91
00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:42.283
go do something you're excited about,
take some time off, go on vacation,

92
00:04:42.283 --> 00:04:44.810
do all these things and
then come back to it.

93
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.099
Every developer will tell you
that one of the most effective

94
00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.918
debugging techniques is walking
away from your computer.

95
00:04:51.918 --> 00:04:56.125
So you close it go take a shower,
I have so many revelations in the shower.

96
00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:59.050
And then okay, and
I come back and I fix my problem.

97
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.501
Sometimes that just takes my brain
all second to assimilate information.

98
00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:05.319
I'll be thinking about like something
out and just pops out in my hand.

99
00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.573
So that's another thing that
you should definitely do.

100
00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:14.155
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If something interests you,
just chase it.

101
00:05:14.155 --> 00:05:16.923
A lot of times people are trying
to get the most marketable skills,

102
00:05:16.923 --> 00:05:18.046
I feel I have to learn React.

103
00:05:18.046 --> 00:05:20.109
That's not the best way
to do this in my opinion.

104
00:05:20.109 --> 00:05:24.312
This is just my opinion
in this particular case.

105
00:05:24.312 --> 00:05:28.209
It's so much easier to chase something
that you're really excited about.

106
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.912
I just have a motivational problem
in general that I'll try it and

107
00:05:32.912 --> 00:05:35.482
have to go learn something
that I just don't wanna do.

108
00:05:35.482 --> 00:05:39.050
And then I get really
burnt out really quickly.

109
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.422
Whereas, I'm super excited about Machine
Learning and it's like go learn everything

110
00:05:42.422 --> 00:05:44.754
I can about it, like you can't
tear me away from a computer.

111
00:05:44.754 --> 00:05:48.022
It'll be 3 AM and
I'm like what am I doing with my life?

112
00:05:48.022 --> 00:05:51.260
So that's really helpful to do.

113
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.054
Don't compare yourself to other people.

114
00:05:54.054 --> 00:05:58.814
This is another problem that I see a lot
with new engineers, that they're like,

115
00:05:58.814 --> 00:06:02.944
this person knows this and I don't
know it, and I feel dumb about it and

116
00:06:02.944 --> 00:06:03.727
that sucks.

117
00:06:03.727 --> 00:06:05.945
And it's not helpful, and
it's usually not true as well.

118
00:06:05.945 --> 00:06:10.180
I was actually happy with
how I put it in here.

119
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.114
You have a perfect knowledge
of your short comings and

120
00:06:13.114 --> 00:06:15.994
an imperfect knowledge of
their accomplishments.

121
00:06:15.994 --> 00:06:18.144
This means, you are usually
underestimating yourself and

122
00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:19.310
you're overestimating them.

123
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.311
So you don't know what
they are going through,

124
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:24.496
you don't know what they're
actually understanding.

125
00:06:24.496 --> 00:06:29.865
So just comparing yourself to other
people It's not a winning game.

126
00:06:29.865 --> 00:06:33.800
Compete against yourself,
I guess is what I'm trying to say.

127
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.206
Programming is a cycle of
feeling like an idiot and

128
00:06:37.206 --> 00:06:38.735
feeling like the smartest
person in the world.

129
00:06:38.735 --> 00:06:41.488
And it's a very,
very short cycle between the two.

130
00:06:41.488 --> 00:06:44.226
And definitely do not let either one
of those feelings go to your head.

131
00:06:44.226 --> 00:06:47.489
Don't let it get you down and
don't become a stuck up asshole.

132
00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:53.934
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then this one's just
kind of really important to me and

133
00:06:53.934 --> 00:06:56.195
I just really wanted to say it out loud.

134
00:06:56.195 --> 00:07:01.104
Which is the programming world has
recently been a world dominated

135
00:07:01.104 --> 00:07:04.770
by white dudes, guys that look like this.

136
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.566
If you're a white guy, work extra hard to
make sure that everyone feels included,

137
00:07:09.566 --> 00:07:13.210
and that's an active effort,
that takes volition to do that.

138
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.029
If you're not a white dude,
I'm not gonna give you advice,

139
00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:18.080
cuz I'm sure it would not be any good.

140
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.720
But I would say seek advice from
people that are smarter than me and

141
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.880
that have been in the field.

142
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.471
But no matter what it takes everyone
working together to make the programming

143
00:07:25.471 --> 00:07:27.527
world inclusive and inviting to everyone.

144
00:07:27.527 --> 00:07:31.767
So I'm inviting you to
work hard on this problem

145
00:07:31.767 --> 00:07:35.478
to make this a better place for everyone.

146
00:07:35.478 --> 00:07:38.370
If you like the course,
please give it a star GitHub.

147
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.722
You can click here it'll take you there,
and you just click little star.

148
00:07:40.722 --> 00:07:41.456
It helps me, and

149
00:07:41.456 --> 00:07:44.771
it helps share this to other people
that might wanna see the course as well.

150
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:50.213
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then here, you've kind
of seen these things down at the bottom

151
00:07:50.213 --> 00:07:55.066
but if you wanna see all of these things
cheering on, you deserve all of these.

152
00:07:55.066 --> 00:07:59.644
I asked them to kinda tell you
all these different things.

153
00:07:59.644 --> 00:08:01.380
So definitely go check this out,

154
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.419
you deserve all these things
people are saying you did it.

155
00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:08.419
The only people that can't become
developers are those that give up

156
00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:09.128
too early.

157
00:08:09.128 --> 00:08:10.548
It's things like that, it's really cool.

158
00:08:10.548 --> 00:08:13.692
So there's like 60 of them in there
you should definitely go read them.

159
00:08:15.044 --> 00:08:17.312
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, does anyone have
any final questions before we wrap up?

160
00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:24.507
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes?

161
00:08:24.507 --> 00:08:27.656
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there a person
on GitHub that you can think

162
00:08:27.656 --> 00:08:30.642
of that actively asks for contributors?

163
00:08:30.642 --> 00:08:32.015
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There is a tag.

164
00:08:33.517 --> 00:08:35.910
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: First of all,
Kent C Dodds is just really good at that.

165
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:40.905
First-time contributors to open source.

166
00:08:40.905 --> 00:08:44.441
First timers only,
there are issues that they put out there,

167
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:47.094
that they will only let
first-timers solve.

168
00:08:47.094 --> 00:08:48.046
So that one is really cool.

169
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.061
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Check that one out.

170
00:09:00.137 --> 00:09:03.361
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sometimes repose
will put first timers or easy for

171
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:09.205
people to getting introduced to projects,
so look at those tags in the projects.

172
00:09:09.205 --> 00:09:10.594
Okay, I know React GS does it.

173
00:09:10.594 --> 00:09:14.070
So Facebook/react.

174
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.526
If you go into here to their Issues,
Labels.

175
00:09:22.131 --> 00:09:28.170
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: They have these listed
by difficulty and good first issue.

176
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.094
That's a good one.

177
00:09:29.094 --> 00:09:33.256
So you can see these ones they've
identified as things that you could

178
00:09:33.256 --> 00:09:35.920
to today to contribute to React, right?

179
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.386
And lots of libraries have that.

180
00:09:37.386 --> 00:09:40.905
Does that answer your question?

181
00:09:40.905 --> 00:09:41.629
Cool.

182
00:09:41.629 --> 00:09:42.386
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good question.

183
00:09:42.386 --> 00:09:42.886
Any other questions?

184
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.874
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Definitely contribute
to Open Source like that's a big

185
00:09:47.874 --> 00:09:48.518
thing as well.

186
00:09:48.518 --> 00:09:50.318
You don't have to as well.

187
00:09:50.318 --> 00:09:53.976
The best thing you can like start to
contribute to open source is just using

188
00:09:53.976 --> 00:09:54.690
Open Source.

189
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.621
Then you'll have an opinion about it and
when you have an opinion about it,

190
00:09:57.621 --> 00:09:59.444
then you can make better
contributions to it.

191
00:09:59.444 --> 00:10:04.540
Okay, I'm way over time, but
I'm so excited to have done this.

192
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.719
I'm so happy that you all stuck with me.

193
00:10:05.719 --> 00:10:09.721
So thanks for coming and
please hit me up on Twitter, on GitHub,

194
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:13.745
LinkedIn, snail mail, I don't know,
whatever you wanna do.

195
00:10:13.745 --> 00:10:16.961
All right, thank you.

196
00:10:16.961 --> 00:10:19.616
