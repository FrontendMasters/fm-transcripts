00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:03.460
Awesome.

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.390
I'm really, really, really excited to be
here with all of you, for people attending

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.960
online, people that are watching it later,
and for people here in the audience.

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.515
First of all, let's go ahead and get
everyone to go to this link right here,

5
00:00:17.515 --> 00:00:21.230
bit.ly/intro-web-dev.

6
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.770
It is important that everything is
lowercase, so make sure you do that.

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.720
This is just going to take you to, I'm
gonna leave that up for just a second, but

8
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.180
it's gonna take you to the website
that you can see up behind it.

9
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.990
So, that should take you to this website,

10
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.670
INTRO TO WEB DEV v2 with all
these nice shades of blue.

11
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.220
You can see here,
just kinda to get the lay of the land.

12
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.220
This is a website here, it's on GitHub.

13
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.160
So that means all of this is open source.

14
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.690
All these materials will be
open source free and forever.

15
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.680
So, you can take this home afterward,

16
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.290
you can share this website
with anyone that wants it.

17
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.500
These are literally my notes.

18
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.680
That's why I have two laptops up here,
is because I have, actually right

19
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.260
now it's open on both computers at once,
just in case, I don't know.

20
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.910
It's like a safety blanket, I don't know.

21
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.280
[LAUGH] So I can type in this one,
I can read my notes off of this one.

22
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.310
So anyway, if you fall behind,
check the website, because again,

23
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.520
that's exactly what I'm reading from.

24
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.970
Please share this around.

25
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.880
That's what this is here for.

26
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.540
If you see mistakes or grammar mistakes,

27
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.410
I'm sure there are many of those,
please make a pull request on GitHub.

28
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.150
And we will show you how to do that
later today, how to make pull requests.

29
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.220
So, yeah.
