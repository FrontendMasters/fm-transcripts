1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.886
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now I really
wish I could stop here.

2
00:00:01.886 --> 00:00:05.901
[LAUGH] This just is getting worse.

3
00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:08.841
But you need to know because
eventually you're gonna be looking

4
00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:12.444
at a code that's terrible, and
you're gonna be wondering what's going on.

5
00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:15.444
And I want you, one,
understand what's going, and two,

6
00:00:15.444 --> 00:00:17.191
I want you to shame whoever did it.

7
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:20.680
It's a joke, don't shame people,
but also, don't do yourself.

8
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.288
That's ultimately,
that's really what I want you to do.

9
00:00:23.288 --> 00:00:25.443
Because if you and
I are working the same code base,

10
00:00:25.443 --> 00:00:26.907
I'm gonna be very upset with you.

11
00:00:26.907 --> 00:00:31.892
[LAUGH] So don't use these.

12
00:00:31.892 --> 00:00:34.439
Don't use these, don't use these.

13
00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:39.604
I'm gonna show you what they do and
how, but don't use them.

14
00:00:39.604 --> 00:00:43.245
We were talking about, sometimes there is
sledgehammers, these are wrecking balls.

15
00:00:43.245 --> 00:00:47.224
These are just way too powerful and
you are in a different dimension

16
00:00:47.224 --> 00:00:51.343
when you start using these and
you really just stop and ask yourself,

17
00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:54.344
how did I get here,
if you end up with using these.

18
00:00:57.251 --> 00:00:59.428
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we're going to style by ID.

19
00:00:59.428 --> 00:01:00.730
We were talking earlier about IDs and

20
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.623
how I don't think they're
necessarily a good idea.

21
00:01:02.623 --> 00:01:04.965
Styling by ID is yet a worse idea.

22
00:01:07.222 --> 00:01:11.877
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I talked about how you
have ones for tags, you have tens for

23
00:01:11.877 --> 00:01:15.357
classes, and
now you have hundreds for IDs.

24
00:01:15.357 --> 00:01:19.772
So one ID will overpower 10 classes.

25
00:01:19.772 --> 00:01:22.960
Actually 255,
if we're gonna be truly honest.

26
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.436
It will overpower 200 classes.

27
00:01:25.436 --> 00:01:28.772
So don't.

28
00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:33.298
So the way you select for an ID is use
the pound, and so this site brand, and

29
00:01:33.298 --> 00:01:36.371
you can see here,
this is a ridiculous selector.

30
00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:42.509
It has one tag, and
it has three different classes and

31
00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.430
it's still red because it's using an ID.

32
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.519
Right, this would be like 100,
and this would be 31.

33
00:01:52.816 --> 00:01:53.360
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: By the way,

34
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.643
I don't think I showed you this yet,
this is how you do comments in CSS.

35
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.659
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's actually any,
you just do a.

36
00:02:04.414 --> 00:02:08.174
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: /* */ anything between

37
00:02:08.174 --> 00:02:13.505
this,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is a comment,

38
00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:17.591
and it can be on a totally different line,
so it can be all the way down there.

39
00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:19.794
You don't have to put the stars here.

40
00:02:19.794 --> 00:02:23.061
It's just kind of a convention
to make it kind of easy for

41
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:25.293
your eyes to vertically align there.

42
00:02:25.293 --> 00:02:26.828
I don't know, it looks nice I suppose.

43
00:02:31.928 --> 00:02:33.055
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions?

44
00:02:35.415 --> 00:02:38.776
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So don't ever stop at ID.

45
00:02:38.776 --> 00:02:42.392
Ask questions if anyone tries to submit
code to your code base that does.

46
00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:46.285
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
just don't, it's a bad idea.

47
00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.625
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
ID selectors are just way too powerful.

48
00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:54.584
It's just not a good idea.

49
00:02:58.191 --> 00:03:02.691
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So do you wanna wreck
the wrecking ball is the question.

50
00:03:02.691 --> 00:03:09.101
So there's one that's even worse than
styling by ID, and it's called important.

51
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:13.236
[LAUGH] I wish I had never
seen these before, but

52
00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:18.551
I saw them all the time and
in a one code base I used to work in.

53
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:21.674
Okay, so I have site-brand-2 here, right?

54
00:03:21.674 --> 00:03:23.314
Let's see if I make this even less.

55
00:03:23.314 --> 00:03:24.386
Let's just make this in h1.

56
00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:28.029
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
this has nothing in it, right?

57
00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:30.810
This has one specificity.

58
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.419
This has 100 specificity.

59
00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.756
And I have here, Brand of my Website,
what color is this gonna be?

60
00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:41.894
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Green, right?

61
00:03:41.894 --> 00:03:47.152
Because here important overrides even, so
this is like the thousands place, right?

62
00:03:47.152 --> 00:03:52.935
This will override IDs,
which is just a giant problem.

63
00:03:52.935 --> 00:03:55.396
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that in every

64
00:03:55.396 --> 00:03:56.158
browser too?

65
00:03:56.158 --> 00:04:00.041
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mm-hm, yeah no it's quite
old, so it's been around for some time.

66
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:00.647
Yeah?

67
00:04:00.647 --> 00:04:06.618
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Was it necessary
where you worked and if so why?

68
00:04:06.618 --> 00:04:07.690
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Was it necessary?

69
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.922
Absolutely not, no way.

70
00:04:08.922 --> 00:04:11.881
[LAUGH] It's lazy developers.

71
00:04:11.881 --> 00:04:15.123
So let me explain to you how
these problems like unravel.

72
00:04:15.123 --> 00:04:19.314
Someone makes a CSS class and
they write something and they select it.

73
00:04:19.314 --> 00:04:22.579
And then sometime, three months later,
someone has to go over and

74
00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:25.280
design decided to change
something from red to green.

75
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.704
And they don't want to go figure out
where it was originally written, so

76
00:04:28.704 --> 00:04:31.639
they just write a new CSS class and
they make it more specific.

77
00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.646
So they had two classes,
then later someone adds three classes,

78
00:04:34.646 --> 00:04:37.663
someone adds four classes,
someone adds four classes and a tag.

79
00:04:37.663 --> 00:04:40.495
Someone is like, nope screw it,
I'm just gonna do an ID, and

80
00:04:40.495 --> 00:04:41.533
then throw an ID on it.

81
00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:44.983
And so it's just like this rats nest and
gets more and more tangled and

82
00:04:44.983 --> 00:04:46.962
someone's like it's important now.

83
00:04:46.962 --> 00:04:53.210
[LAUGH] So it's just this ridiculousness
and if you ever try to like unravel it and

84
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.872
make the code look better,
because at that point your codes

85
00:04:57.872 --> 00:05:02.927
impossible to understand where's
what's coming from where.

86
00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:05.228
Yeah, it's impossible,
it's just impossible to deal with.

87
00:05:05.228 --> 00:05:07.625
So no, it wasn't necessary at all.

88
00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:08.786
Does that answer your question?

89
00:05:08.786 --> 00:05:10.474
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, yeah.

90
00:05:10.474 --> 00:05:16.017
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So for all these IDs and
important, the cascade still applies?

91
00:05:16.017 --> 00:05:18.705
That if you have two importants on

92
00:05:18.705 --> 00:05:20.154
something,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep.

93
00:05:20.154 --> 00:05:25.116
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The bottom one or
two IDs on something, the bottom one, or

94
00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:27.858
the one closest will override.

95
00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:36.104
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There

96
00:05:36.104 --> 00:05:38.422
is a way to do two importants,
I forgot what it is.

97
00:05:44.683 --> 00:05:49.558
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anyway,
you can get into some weird stuff, yes.

98
00:05:53.284 --> 00:05:56.087
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Remember how some
things can only have one ID.

99
00:05:56.087 --> 00:05:58.597
So let's just get rid of that for
a second.

100
00:05:58.597 --> 00:06:02.299
Let's say I wanted to make this even more.

101
00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:03.697
We'll just get rid of that for a second.

102
00:06:06.036 --> 00:06:08.477
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What you
could do is you can do.

103
00:06:08.477 --> 00:06:10.795
There's nothing stopping you
from repeating yourself.

104
00:06:10.795 --> 00:06:14.482
So you can say site-brand-2,

105
00:06:14.482 --> 00:06:19.360
and then up here I can say site-brand-2.

106
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.248
So you can actually repeat yourself.

107
00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:24.838
But now it's become more specific, right?

108
00:06:24.838 --> 00:06:27.730
Or you can get even like more weird and

109
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:33.067
you can actually combine with
the class and say nav-head-2.

110
00:06:33.067 --> 00:06:37.269
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now it's more specific
cuz it has both a class and ID, right?

111
00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:40.862
So you can see this is kind of
a game you can play but you really,

112
00:06:40.862 --> 00:06:42.257
really don't want to.

113
00:06:42.257 --> 00:06:45.624
If you combine an ID
selector with class or

114
00:06:45.624 --> 00:06:50.834
with anything else ever,
just burn the code base to the ground.

115
00:06:50.834 --> 00:06:54.595
Just delete it and quit your job.

116
00:06:54.595 --> 00:06:56.306
No, I'm just kidding.

117
00:06:56.306 --> 00:07:00.118
Yeah you have serious problems when
you're combining IDs with anything else.

118
00:07:00.118 --> 00:07:03.649
That's when you know stuff
has seriously hit the fan.

119
00:07:06.537 --> 00:07:10.212
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
now that I've shown you all the stuff,

120
00:07:10.212 --> 00:07:12.577
I hope you never see it again.

121
00:07:12.577 --> 00:07:16.216
I bless you that you never have
to see these things again.

122
00:07:16.216 --> 00:07:17.120
Any questions?

123
00:07:19.112 --> 00:07:19.760
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Please.

124
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.800
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Are there any add-ons, or

125
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:27.970
I guess you'd call them plugins that
tracks where stuff is coming from?

126
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:32.345
So that developers can find
where the end of the string is?

127
00:07:32.345 --> 00:07:36.890
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The Dev tools are actually
really quite good at pointing to where

128
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:42.792
things came from, so this is actually not
gonna be super useful, maybe it will be.

129
00:07:42.792 --> 00:07:45.651
Let's take a look at my header here for
the website.

130
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:51.232
So if I Inspect Element, which is gonna
put me back in my developer tools.

131
00:07:51.232 --> 00:07:55.069
So you can see here that I have a nav bar.

132
00:07:55.069 --> 00:08:00.372
The nav bar class,
it's pointing at this coming from in line.

133
00:08:00.372 --> 00:08:03.232
But that's how my website was built.

134
00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:07.319
If I click on it,
it'll actually take me to the style sheet,

135
00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:09.416
where I was actually defined.

136
00:08:09.416 --> 00:08:14.932
So you don't actually really
even need any additional tools.

137
00:08:14.932 --> 00:08:17.676
Your developer tools are actually
quicker to do it now.

138
00:08:17.676 --> 00:08:22.861
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay, it's more
confusing why there would be lazy

139
00:08:22.861 --> 00:08:29.626
developers in the first place if
they can't find where it starts.

140
00:08:29.626 --> 00:08:32.495
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes,
I like where your head's at.

141
00:08:32.495 --> 00:08:33.368
[LAUGH] Absolutely,

142
00:08:33.368 --> 00:08:36.766
the first thing I would say is developer
tools haven't always been this good.

143
00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:42.376
That's maybe the past three to four years,
they've gotten really, really good.

144
00:08:42.376 --> 00:08:45.037
And even maybe the past two years
when they've gotten phenomenal.

145
00:08:45.037 --> 00:08:49.071
Specifically, Chrome and Firefox have
just taken huge bounds, it's really,

146
00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:50.689
really great developer tools.

147
00:08:50.689 --> 00:08:55.673
I mean, back in the day when we
were using old Firebug which

148
00:08:55.673 --> 00:08:58.826
is what Firefox dev tools used to be,

149
00:08:58.826 --> 00:09:03.320
it didn't really tell you
some of things like this.

150
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.581
And then beyond that,
people are still just lazy.

151
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:10.000
[LAUGH] A lot of people don't invest
the time to learn the developer tools and

152
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.611
learn their tooling really, really well.

153
00:09:12.611 --> 00:09:15.234
I would bet you there's some people that
don't even know that you can do that, and

154
00:09:15.234 --> 00:09:16.427
you could click through to see that.

155
00:09:16.427 --> 00:09:19.565
So it is worth the time to
invest into your tools and

156
00:09:19.565 --> 00:09:21.674
to learn how your browser works.

157
00:09:21.674 --> 00:09:23.961
Learn how to do your developer tools.

158
00:09:23.961 --> 00:09:28.865
In fact, there's a great Frontend Masters
course by Jon Kuperman on

159
00:09:28.865 --> 00:09:30.985
the Chrome developer tools.

160
00:09:30.985 --> 00:09:32.522
So that's worth doing as well.

161
00:09:35.858 --> 00:09:37.458
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But I don't know,
I don't know why people do that.

162
00:09:37.458 --> 00:09:42.715
[LAUGH] I'd like to say that I've never
done it, but I've definitely done it.

163
00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:46.198
I mean, it's one of those things that I
was working at a place that, obviously,

164
00:09:46.198 --> 00:09:46.825
no one cared.

165
00:09:46.825 --> 00:09:47.993
Because everyone else was doing it.

166
00:09:47.993 --> 00:09:50.569
And it was like, I don't have time
to clean up everyone else's mess, so

167
00:09:50.569 --> 00:09:51.639
I'm just gonna pile onto it.

168
00:09:54.329 --> 00:09:58.625
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's like if
you're in a crowd of people and

169
00:09:58.625 --> 00:10:02.000
they won't stop a crime going on.

170
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.128
Like there's somebody will
to blame anyone else, and

171
00:10:05.128 --> 00:10:07.308
everyone does that to everyone else.

172
00:10:07.308 --> 00:10:11.355
And there's some name for that phenomenon
that I can't remember what it is.

173
00:10:11.355 --> 00:10:16.764
The fusion of responsibility,
that's what it is.

174
00:10:16.764 --> 00:10:19.515
People are lazy.

175
00:10:19.515 --> 00:10:21.880
People, I am lazy, that's true.
