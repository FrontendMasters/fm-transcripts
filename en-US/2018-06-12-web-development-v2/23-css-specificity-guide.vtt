&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, something I wanted
to show you before we move on.

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.370
Two things I wanted to mention.

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.080
Both of these have to do with
Estelle Weyl, who is- she's fantastic.

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.310
She's one, when it comes to CSS, she's
like, gee, she is like top of the game.

5
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.190
She's really, really smart.

6
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.750
Really great person.

7
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.600
First of all, she has a Friend and
Masters course that's A plus,

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.030
like in depth CSS stuff.

9
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.239
Far, far more talented and far better
than I am with these kind of things,

10
00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.620
with things like she knows how to do and
things like that.

11
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.520
So if you wanna go deeper in CSS
that is definitely the path.

12
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.630
And then she also made this
thing called CSS SpeciFISHity,

13
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.210
which is quite cute, I think.

14
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.770
I did ask her if I could use this.

15
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.360
So, she gracefully allowed me to.

16
00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.570
And this kind of just like uses fish
to demonstrate how specificity works.

17
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.890
So the littlest one is
the universal selector,

18
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.540
which is the wild card one
that I was talking about.

19
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.760
And then you have plankton
which represents tags, right?

20
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.980
And then if you have two fish,
then you have, or like two planktons,

21
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.740
then you have two tag specificity.

22
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.500
And then,
you can have a bunch of them, but

23
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.800
it's still just a bunch of tiny plankton.

24
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.300
As soon as you specify one fish, right,

25
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.610
one fish beats all of
the plankton in the ocean.

26
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.217
I don't know if that's necessarily true,
but I'm saying it.

27
00:01:29.217 --> 00:01:32.020
[LAUGH] This is now
a course in marine biology.

28
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.010
[LAUGH]
That does more than

29
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.749
a bunch of plankton, right?

30
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.620
And so you can eventually get down here,
and you have a bunch of fish, and

31
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.940
you eventually get a shark, right?

32
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.290
And that's one ID, and
then if you do inline styles,

33
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.170
we haven't talk about inline styles,
that's on purpose a little bit.

34
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.510
But you can actually do styles directly
on your tags, like as a attribute on

35
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.080
your html, and
that actually outweighs IDs.

36
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.860
And then you have the bomb,
which is important,

37
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.530
which even outweighs that, right?

38
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.430
So just a nice little thing, I think
she actually sells posters of this,

39
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.190
which I think kinda cute.

40
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.530
There's also a version of
this that does Star Wars.

41
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.040
And they have storm troopers, and
Darth Vaders, and stuff like that,

42
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.310
which is kinda fun, too.

43
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.420
So, I just wanted to show you that.

44
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.060
It's kinda a nice concrete
visual to understand where

45
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.260
some of that stuff is coming out of.
