WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We have events and
listeners as well.

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.310
So a big reason that we use JavaScript, so

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.170
far, we've just been
kind of modifying things.

4
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.840
This would have been better in the first
place if I had just made it modified by

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.350
JavaScript because that's
what I wanted it to do.

6
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.330
But now, I'm gonna teach you how
to be reactive to user input,

7
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.970
which is more what JavaScript
is more useful for

8
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.948
in the browser.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if I have down here this

9
00:00:21.948 --> 00:00:26.250
Click me button, I want it to be able
to react to a user clicking on it.

10
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.620
I don't want it to just do nothing.

11
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.670
So if I click on it
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What is going on with this?

12
00:00:48.774 --> 00:00:49.276
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I swear this was

13
00:00:49.276 --> 00:00:50.120
working before.

14
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.430
So I'm just gonna do it inside of my

15
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.390
experiments here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

16
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.276
I'm going to put this in my index.html.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

17
00:00:58.276 --> 00:01:07.062
I'm just going to replace this.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This

18
00:01:07.062 --> 00:01:09.260
script tag does not end.

19
00:01:19.787 --> 00:01:22.720
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'll save that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now,

20
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.490
I'm going to open that index.html.

21
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.900
I have a one button on here,
if I click it, It says Hey there, right?

22
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.280
This is what an alert is.

23
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.950
An alert is these pop over
dialogues that everyone hates.

24
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.773
Yeah, that's an alert.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or

25
00:01:41.773 --> 00:01:45.781
I think there's also a dialogue.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's a bunch of

26
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:51.530
them.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's what that does.

27
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.257
Let's talk about the event
listener part of it.

28
00:01:54.758 --> 00:01:55.420
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So button,

29
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.800
I did a query selector.

30
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.150
I get a hold of the button, right?

31
00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.250
Which is this button up here.

32
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.790
I then do this function
called addEventListener.

33
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.130
So you're basically saying I'm waiting for
this event to happen,

34
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.514
whenever a click happens on this button,
run this function, right?

35
00:02:14.514 --> 00:02:18.510
So I'll wait for the click, as soon as
someone clicks, then run this function.

36
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.790
And inside of there,
I'm saying, hey there,

37
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.860
that's why I'm doing the alert, right?

38
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.530
So that's what an event listener does.

39
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.633
It's just waiting for something, there's
more types of events than just clicks,

40
00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:34.148
that's just one of them.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions

41
00:02:34.148 --> 00:02:39.002
about that?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

42
00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:42.545
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You'll often call these

43
00:02:42.545 --> 00:02:43.840
a callback.

44
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.950
You'll hear that word callback.

45
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.742
It's just a function that you provide that
gets called back by something else, and

46
00:02:51.742 --> 00:02:58.132
that's a callback.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Alert is a super,

47
00:02:58.132 --> 00:03:00.800
super annoying function,
so don't use alert.

48
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.790
It's useful for
debugging purposes and nothing else.

49
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.840
Or like you really want warn someone
like you're about to do something that's

50
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.473
going to screw something up,
just be super aware that you're doing

51
00:03:09.473 --> 00:03:12.840
that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

52
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.170
I wanted to break this down right here.

53
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.610
People kind of get weirded out by seeing
curly brace, parentheses, semi-colon.

54
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.790
So the curly brace is connected
to this function, right?

55
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.980
This parentheses is connected
to this parentheses right there.

56
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.290
And then, the semicolon being
the end of that statement, right?

57
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.087
So that's why all that stuff is together.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good?

58
00:03:43.926 --> 00:03:44.864
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

59
00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:50.755
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's do another example

60
00:03:50.755 --> 00:03:51.750
with an input tag.

61
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.210
So what I want to do is I wanna be
able to type something into an input.

62
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.030
And I want whatever is
being typed into this input

63
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.420
to immediately be put into
a different paragraph tag, right?

64
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.880
So if I type into it, does this work?

65
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.700
It does work, neat.

66
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.630
So as soon as I type into this something,

67
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.856
it's also putting it beneath it as well,
right?

68
00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:21.850
Understand the functionality there?

69
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.598
So what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna
grab the input, document.querySelector,

70
00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:28.212
input to copy.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then,

71
00:04:28.212 --> 00:04:32.120
I'm gonna grab the paragraph by querying
the selector p to copy to, right?

72
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.552
So this grabs the input.

73
00:04:34.552 --> 00:04:36.171
This grabs the paragraph.

74
00:04:36.171 --> 00:04:41.606
And so,
I'm gonna say input .addEventListener.

75
00:04:41.606 --> 00:04:44.090
And then, I'm gonna listen for keyup.

76
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.800
So keyup is whenever you lift
your finger off the key.

77
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.970
So whenever that happens, it's going to
copy whatever is inside of the input.

78
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.026
So input.value, right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I'm going to put

79
00:05:01.026 --> 00:05:06.948
that inside of paragraph.innerText.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make

80
00:05:06.948 --> 00:05:10.156
sense?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

81
00:05:10.156 --> 00:05:13.770
that's why this is,
I can't modify anything in this page.

82
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.797
I'm super annoyed by this.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anyway,

83
00:05:16.797 --> 00:05:19.350
you could also do keydown here.

84
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.211
That would technically work.

85
00:05:20.211 --> 00:05:24.300
So it would be whenever I pushed the
button down that the event would be fired.

86
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:31.360
However, keydown happens before
the value was inputted into the input.

87
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.204
So you would actually
always be one key behind,

88
00:05:33.204 --> 00:05:37.456
which is annoying.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

89
00:05:37.456 --> 00:05:41.210
let's just put that in, just to show you
what that actually ends up looking like.

90
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:49.791
Put this in here
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

91
00:05:49.791 --> 00:05:54.030
I'll refresh, make sure this works.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That does work.

92
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.254
Okay, so if I change this to keydown.

93
00:06:04.172 --> 00:06:04.965
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So notice I type F

94
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.936
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And nothing happens, right?

95
00:06:12.936 --> 00:06:16.938
But if I hit F again,
you get the last one, right?

96
00:06:16.938 --> 00:06:21.742
So I pressed the button,
keydown happens, and

97
00:06:21.742 --> 00:06:26.433
then whatever I typed
gets put into the input.

98
00:06:26.433 --> 00:06:30.051
So if I type G, keydown happens,
and then G gets put into the input,

99
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:31.840
and that's when it gets copied.

100
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.507
So it's always gonna one key behind.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

101
00:06:34.507 --> 00:06:39.900
that's why it's missing
the f there on the end.

102
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.446
So that's why we did keyup, cuz keyup
happens after the value is put into

103
00:06:42.446 --> 00:06:45.283
the input.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make

104
00:06:45.283 --> 00:06:47.094
sense?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

105
00:06:47.094 --> 00:06:50.910
these are subtleties that you
have to worry about with events.

106
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.150
And it's just one of those things that
you get by guessing and checking or

107
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.040
reading stocks.

108
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:03.989
Or something like that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

109
00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:05.265
we're sending that with innerText, and

110
00:07:05.265 --> 00:07:12.368
we're getting that from input.value.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

111
00:07:12.368 --> 00:07:17.220
I wanted to show you change.

112
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:22.340
So a change event happens
whenever you unfocus an input.

113
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.080
So I have this box right here, and
I can type in here Three, three, three.

114
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.860
Notice nothing has changed.

115
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.120
I'm about to click off of it.

116
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.250
So if I click off of it,
then it changes the color.

117
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.100
So it waits for
what's called a blur event.

118
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.500
So something focuses when I click on it,
and it blurs when I click off of it.

119
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.478
So if I come back in here and
say, I don't know,

120
00:07:46.478 --> 00:07:48.979
lime green.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Does that.

121
00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:54.200
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: My favorite color is peru.

122
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.360
I don't know if you knew this,
but peru is a color.

123
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.240
That is the color of peru.

124
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.210
I don't know where some
of these come from.

125
00:08:06.316 --> 00:08:07.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Medium sea green.

126
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:10.490
Yeah, that's a color.

127
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.920
[LAUGH]
Or there's tons, there's dodger blue.

128
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.050
If any of you are baseball fans.

129
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.130
There's a bunch of them.

130
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.720
And some of them are purely nonsensical.

131
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.734
Or this one's a favorite, papaya whip.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's like

132
00:08:28.734 --> 00:08:34.720
this weird yellowish color.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right?

133
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.785
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anyway, it's neither here

134
00:08:37.785 --> 00:08:42.808
nor there.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions

135
00:08:42.808 --> 00:08:45.240
about events in general?

136
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.710
You can put events on anything, right?

137
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.510
So I could put a click event on a div,
and that does work, right?

138
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.712
So it's not tied,
necessarily, to anything.

139
00:08:54.712 --> 00:08:56.970
What was the other thing
I wanted to say about it?

140
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.370
You can make your own events.

141
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.190
That is not something I typically do.

142
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.750
You can actually manually trigger events
on a div, and then you can listen for

143
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.220
that manually triggered event.

144
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.644
So I could listen for Briansevent.

145
00:09:08.644 --> 00:09:12.250
And then,
there's a way you can say on this div,

146
00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.540
trigger a briansevent on that event,
on that div.

147
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.130
It's not a very useful pattern, so I would
not suggest doing it, but it is possible.

148
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.580
Most of the time,
you're just listening for browser events.
