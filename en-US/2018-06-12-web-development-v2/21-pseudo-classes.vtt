00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.190
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're gonna talk
about pseudoclasses for a second.

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.570
So these are things that you
will end up using quite a bit.

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.428
Sometimes you wanna do CSS based on some
sort of state that the UI will find itself

4
00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:14.900
in.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And probably the most easy

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.620
one to demonstrate and one that you'll
commonly use is the hover pseudoclass.

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:26.345
So I have here this box over there, the
one that says Hover your mouse over me.

7
00:00:26.345 --> 00:00:29.532
And when I hover my mouse over it,
like I put my mouse over it,

8
00:00:29.532 --> 00:00:31.350
it changes styles, right?

9
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.340
So it's kind of reacting
to the user's input.

10
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.260
Now, when you will
typically use this is for

11
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.910
links, right, because links will change
colors, or they'll underline themselves.

12
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.470
I did it here, right?

13
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.869
If you go back to Intro to Web Dev,
they underline themselves,

14
00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:48.951
they get a little bit darker.

15
00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:54.958
And that's just based on the hover class.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And the way that

16
00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:59.700
you do that is I have hover example right
here, that has some set of colors, right?

17
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.440
And then I have hover-example:, so this
is the key thing that you're looking for

18
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.070
is the colon, :hover.

19
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.050
So that means any time that
it's both this class and

20
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.720
it's being hovered over,
then apply these styles.

21
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.059
So the background changes colors,
it changes width and height, etc,

22
00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:20.204
etc.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's a bunch of them.

23
00:01:20.204 --> 00:01:24.890
There's focus, if I'm doing an input and

24
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.900
the user clicks on it, you wanna outline
it in blue to let the user know it's like,

25
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.140
hey, you are focused
on this at the moment.

26
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.764
You can do :focus, there's :active, which
is like, I'm actively pushing a button.

27
00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:42.132
There is :checked for check boxes,
whenever they're checked,

28
00:01:42.132 --> 00:01:45.270
you can do different styles based on that.

29
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.020
There's a bunch of stuff.

30
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.870
Those are called pseudoclasses.

31
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.510
They do have a certain amount of
specificity associated with them,

32
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:03.910
and I believe it is like being a tag, no
it's a class, I think it's like a class.

33
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.485
So if did hover-example,

34
00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:16.360
and we'll do div, I did color

35
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.278
blue,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, not color,

36
00:02:21.278 --> 00:02:25.844
I want background color, background-color,

37
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.027
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

38
00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:34.870
I would expect this to stay blue.

39
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.330
No, it gets red, so, right,
because this is like a class, right?

40
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.260
So this is like 20,

41
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.453
whereas this one's like 11.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Whereas

42
00:02:45.453 --> 00:02:49.270
if I did hover-example twice,
hover-example.

43
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.412
So this is twice, this is 20,
this is 20, right?

44
00:02:53.412 --> 00:02:54.780
Which one wins?

45
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.938
The one that's lower on the page, so

46
00:02:56.938 --> 00:03:02.664
therefore it stays blue.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I mean,

47
00:03:02.664 --> 00:03:06.390
you can even see it, I've been doing this
for a decade or longer than a decade, and

48
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.970
I still get mixed up at this stuff.

49
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.753
And this is example stuff, so
I'm teaching to brand new beginners,

50
00:03:11.753 --> 00:03:14.442
which is why I try to avoid
it as much as possible.

51
00:03:14.442 --> 00:03:19.047
If everything's just styled with one
class, and sometimes two classes, it's

52
00:03:19.047 --> 00:03:21.564
great, it's a lot easier to work through.

53
00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:25.155
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions?

54
00:03:28.731 --> 00:03:29.646
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Student: I have

55
00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:30.514
a question in chat room.

56
00:03:30.514 --> 00:03:34.540
I think it goes to semantics and
defining things.

57
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.698
Is hover a class, or an event, or both?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes,

58
00:03:41.698 --> 00:03:47.115
[LAUGH] the answer is, depends on
what context we're talking about.

59
00:03:47.115 --> 00:03:53.248
In this very particular instance
right now, it is a pseudoclass,

60
00:03:53.248 --> 00:03:58.623
which means its specificity is
similar to that of a class.

61
00:03:58.623 --> 00:04:02.440
In JavaScript, there are hover events,
which we will get to.

62
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.863
I don't know if.

63
00:04:03.863 --> 00:04:05.490
It's not actually called hover.

64
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.228
It's called mouse enter and mouse leave at
that point, but that's what it's called,

65
00:04:11.228 --> 00:04:15.753
it's the same thing.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good

66
00:04:15.753 --> 00:04:21.072
question.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Other questions?

67
00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:30.830
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is another

68
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.802
pseudoclass, one called first-child.

69
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.802
So I have here an ol,
with three li's in it.

70
00:04:43.802 --> 00:04:47.127
And let's say I wanted to always
style the first one a different

71
00:04:47.127 --> 00:04:51.182
color.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, I could have just

72
00:04:51.182 --> 00:04:56.688
given this another class.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Another class,

73
00:04:56.688 --> 00:04:59.247
and I could have styled based on that,
right?

74
00:04:59.247 --> 00:05:04.411
And I could have use specificity
in the cascade to make that work.

75
00:05:04.411 --> 00:05:10.640
However, there's these kinda structural
pseudoclasses that you can use.

76
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.081
And of them is first-child.

77
00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:18.040
So it says, if it has
the first-child-example of class, and

78
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.840
also it is the first child in the list,
if that's the case,

79
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.340
then apply this particular class.

80
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.698
So this one,
because it's the first child in the list,

81
00:05:29.698 --> 00:05:36.067
it gets this green color, right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's one of them.

82
00:05:36.067 --> 00:05:37.460
There's also last-child.

83
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.520
So if I change this to last-child,
you get the last one.

84
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.681
And there's also one called nth-child,
which I don't really wanna get too

85
00:05:45.681 --> 00:05:48.764
much into, but I want you to
just be aware that it exists.

86
00:05:48.764 --> 00:05:53.319
Nth-child, and say, I wanted to get the
one in the middle, then I could just put 2

87
00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:58.349
in there, it's the second child.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or

88
00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:02.946
if I wanted to get the first and the third
one, you can actually end up doing math in

89
00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:05.649
here, not that anyone
wanted to do math today,

90
00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:10.563
but you could.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

91
00:06:10.563 --> 00:06:13.480
you give it a formula,
it will follow the formula.

92
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.330
That's what nth-child does,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is kinda fun.

93
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:27.403
But if we go back to first-child,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Inside

94
00:06:27.403 --> 00:06:29.280
of ol's you'll only ever put li's.

95
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.704
But let's just take for
a dump reason, I put a p in here for

96
00:06:34.704 --> 00:06:39.972
whatever reason.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Notice that

97
00:06:39.972 --> 00:06:43.880
nothing is green now because technically
this p is the first child, right?

98
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.020
And it doesn't match this one either
cuz it doesn't have first-child

99
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.480
example in there either.

100
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.298
So nothing matches,
you just get the red one.

101
00:06:56.062 --> 00:06:57.040
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions about that?

102
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.300
There are quite a few
pseudoclasses to look at, so

103
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.430
that's something you should check out.

104
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.792
I think I linked to
a CSS Tricks article on it,

105
00:07:08.792 --> 00:07:13.232
yep, so give that a look if you
wanna learn more about them.

106
00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:17.005
There's nth of type, which is another
one that's kind of interesting.

107
00:07:17.005 --> 00:07:19.149
I don't think I've ever used nth of type,

108
00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:21.600
that's just one those
things I just know about.

109
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:29.740
I do use nth-child, and nth-child is quite
useful, so is first-child and last-child.

110
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.620
So that's when to bother learning,
for sure
