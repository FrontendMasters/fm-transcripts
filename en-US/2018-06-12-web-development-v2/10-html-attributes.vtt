00:00:00.197 --> 00:00:06.369
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
we're gonna go on to more HTML steps.

2
00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:10.091
So, we just discussed tags.

3
00:00:10.091 --> 00:00:13.248
So I wanted to just as a brief side note,

4
00:00:13.248 --> 00:00:16.901
a tag is typically like a type of tag,
right?

5
00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:20.660
So, you have anchor tags,
p tags, things like that.

6
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.163
And then you have an element
which is one instance, right?

7
00:00:23.163 --> 00:00:27.548
So this is one element, this is another
element, this is another element, but

8
00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:28.922
you have types of tags and

9
00:00:28.922 --> 00:00:33.129
then you have one instance of the type
of tag which will be called an element.

10
00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.167
So that's, when I use the word element,
that's what I mean.

11
00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:39.007
The reason why I tell you
that is cuz I cannot stop

12
00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:41.637
saying the word element
[LAUGH] I have tried.

13
00:00:41.637 --> 00:00:47.799
So, that's what I mean when I say element,
it's one particular instance of that

14
00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:53.079
particular tag.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

15
00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.613
this is one element, one input element.

16
00:00:57.613 --> 00:01:01.605
Okay, attributes.

17
00:01:01.605 --> 00:01:06.102
So, often it's not enough just to
know what type of tag something is,

18
00:01:06.102 --> 00:01:09.090
we also usually need to
give additional data.

19
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.982
So, for these inputs,
we need to know if it's a check box, or

20
00:01:13.982 --> 00:01:18.702
a color picker, or a file picker,
or something like that.

21
00:01:18.702 --> 00:01:25.554
So, this right here, this type equals
business, this is a attribute, right?

22
00:01:25.554 --> 00:01:29.093
So I have an input tag and
I have a type attribute, and

23
00:01:29.093 --> 00:01:31.437
then this is the value right here.

24
00:01:31.437 --> 00:01:34.380
So I'll say type equals,
and then you need quotes.

25
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.183
These can be single quotes or
double quotes, either is fine.

26
00:01:38.183 --> 00:01:40.043
And then I'll give it some sort of value.

27
00:01:40.043 --> 00:01:44.831
For input tags in particular,
it has to be one of a subset, right,

28
00:01:44.831 --> 00:01:47.405
I can't just put anything in here.

29
00:01:47.405 --> 00:01:50.903
If I just put anything in there, it's
gonna say, I don't know what you mean, so

30
00:01:50.903 --> 00:01:51.941
I assume you mean text.

31
00:01:51.941 --> 00:01:54.833
[LAUGH] So
it just falls back to the default.

32
00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:58.695
In other words, it ignores it
if it doesn't know what it is.

33
00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:05.251
So that's why it has to be something
like color or numbers with another one.

34
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:11.185
So like if this is a number input,
you'll see here that it goes red.

35
00:02:11.185 --> 00:02:15.306
This is something that browser does
fire itself, I didn't write any code

36
00:02:15.306 --> 00:02:18.707
that does this, that says hey,
that's not a number [LAUGH].

37
00:02:18.707 --> 00:02:22.310
So then if I go back in here and
put 123, then it will work.

38
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.605
You also probably have a hard time seeing
it but there is also a little thing where

39
00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:30.567
I can increment and decrement it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I think, yeah,

40
00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:32.700
that's what that does.

41
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.515
Anyway, there's a bunch of them.

42
00:02:34.515 --> 00:02:39.874
That's just one instance of it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So type is an attribute.

43
00:02:39.874 --> 00:02:43.409
Different tags have different
attributes that they care about.

44
00:02:45.595 --> 00:02:46.570
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So for example,

45
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.770
if I gave a type tag to a p, or
a type attribute to a p tag,

46
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.254
that doesn't make any sense, right,
there is just one type of paragraph.

47
00:02:54.254 --> 00:02:57.016
There are no special attributes for
paragraphs,

48
00:02:57.016 --> 00:03:01.864
it's just a paragraph
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So over here,

49
00:03:01.864 --> 00:03:05.759
I give you a table of just
a bunch of different kinds.

50
00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:09.955
So here's a value,
this is a pre-filled value, right?

51
00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:12.986
So I can actually just edit
this right now, right?

52
00:03:12.986 --> 00:03:17.580
But for example if,
let's say I was doing a sign-up form, but

53
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.150
I already think I know what your name is,
right?

54
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.739
So I will put like Brian here so that when
you go to fill out that form it's like,

55
00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.493
hey I think your name is Brian but you
can edit this if that's incorrect, right?

56
00:03:30.493 --> 00:03:36.251
So that's what a value would be is
a pre-filled value into an input,

57
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:38.445
right, that make sense?

58
00:03:38.445 --> 00:03:39.621
Then you have placeholders.

59
00:03:39.621 --> 00:03:42.349
Notice that this is grey.

60
00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.245
I think you've seen this before.

61
00:03:44.245 --> 00:03:47.418
And then as soon as I start typing
that grey text is gonna go away.

62
00:03:47.418 --> 00:03:49.580
So, you might put something
here like first name,

63
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.453
what you actually want
them to put in there.

64
00:03:51.453 --> 00:03:54.693
So it's a placeholder value
while you're waiting for

65
00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:59.850
them to type something.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then

66
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.411
if I have an input type=checkbox.

67
00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:06.885
And then I can say hey,
start it out with this checked, right?

68
00:04:06.885 --> 00:04:09.770
It would be really nice
if people will say,

69
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.466
I consent to this form they
just prechecked it for you.

70
00:04:13.466 --> 00:04:15.626
I think legally,
they have to not check it.

71
00:04:15.626 --> 00:04:17.386
I don't know, I'm making shit up.

72
00:04:17.386 --> 00:04:20.639
I don't actually know, but
this is pre-checking and

73
00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.910
that's what the checked part means.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But

74
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.559
I can still check it and check it, right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

75
00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:32.728
that's what that means.

76
00:04:32.728 --> 00:04:38.430
If I have an attribute with no values,
so notice this one has the equals,

77
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.114
you know this is the placeholder thing,
this is the value.

78
00:04:43.114 --> 00:04:48.995
If I just put checked with no value after
it, that basically means true, right?

79
00:04:48.995 --> 00:04:51.448
So checked equals true
that would be the same

80
00:04:51.448 --> 00:04:54.682
thing.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

81
00:04:54.682 --> 00:04:56.683
here's a radio button, this one's checked.

82
00:04:56.683 --> 00:05:02.164
With radio buttons you can't uncheck them
you would have to have a group of them and

83
00:05:02.164 --> 00:05:03.920
then select another one.

84
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.770
Here is a check box and
then it's disabled.

85
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.036
Which means that you can see it's kinda
greyed out there and I can't actually,

86
00:05:10.036 --> 00:05:11.205
I'm trying to click on it and

87
00:05:11.205 --> 00:05:15.372
it won't let me click it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

88
00:05:15.372 --> 00:05:20.533
then this one,
this right here represents red.

89
00:05:20.533 --> 00:05:22.186
This is a hexadecimal number.

90
00:05:22.186 --> 00:05:25.608
You don't really have
to care how they work.

91
00:05:25.608 --> 00:05:31.015
But this FF0000 represents
red in hexadecimal.

92
00:05:31.015 --> 00:05:33.201
But I can click on it and
change it to something else,

93
00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:35.645
right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

94
00:05:35.645 --> 00:05:40.075
that's what the value is, it's
the initial value when someone lands on

95
00:05:40.075 --> 00:05:46.047
the website.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you want to figure

96
00:05:46.047 --> 00:05:50.406
out hexadecimals and that kinda stuff,
CSS Tricks has a great article on it.

97
00:05:50.406 --> 00:05:51.885
I would suggest looking that up.

98
00:05:51.885 --> 00:05:56.149
I think I linked to it somewhere
on this crazy website.

99
00:05:56.149 --> 00:06:02.296
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, any questions

100
00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:04.647
about attributes in general so far?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

101
00:06:04.647 --> 00:06:08.872
the color value you can either
put down those hexadecimal or

102
00:06:08.872 --> 00:06:14.021
you can actually put down color red.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

103
00:06:14.021 --> 00:06:17.128
I've never tried putting it here for
an input.

104
00:06:17.128 --> 00:06:19.403
I don't know if that would work.

105
00:06:19.403 --> 00:06:21.505
To be honest with you,
I would have to check.

106
00:06:21.505 --> 00:06:24.293
But normally the answer
to that question is yes.

107
00:06:24.293 --> 00:06:25.493
Well, I guess we can check right here.

108
00:06:25.493 --> 00:06:32.571
So, if I make this a color and
I say value= "red".

109
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:37.320
Yeah, it doesn't work in this particular
instance, but in CSS that normally works.

110
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.974
Just not this very instance [LAUGH],

111
00:06:42.974 --> 00:06:47.877
whereas if I said ff0000.

112
00:06:47.877 --> 00:06:50.519
Because this only works
with hexadecimal for

113
00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:55.376
inputs.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That

114
00:06:55.376 --> 00:06:59.281
would almost never be important [LAUGH].

115
00:06:59.281 --> 00:07:03.693
I've never used a color
picker in my entire career.

116
00:07:03.693 --> 00:07:05.610
Maybe I'm in the wrong line of work,
I don't know.
