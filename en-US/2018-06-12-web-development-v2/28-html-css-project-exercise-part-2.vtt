1
00:00:00.036 --> 00:00:00.624
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so

2
00:00:00.624 --> 00:00:05.048
it sounds like most people were able
to do pretty well with the project.

3
00:00:05.048 --> 00:00:08.336
If not,
we're gonna work through it right now, and

4
00:00:08.336 --> 00:00:11.569
you can kind of see how you
did in different things.

5
00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:16.831
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if you click here,
this is kind of what we were looking at.

6
00:00:19.382 --> 00:00:26.789
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll do this title first,
and then we'll kind of move down the rows.

7
00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.130
Does anyone have any questions
about it before we move forward?

8
00:00:31.517 --> 00:00:38.168
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you want to see this
page, I've made a little bit.ly link for

9
00:00:38.168 --> 00:00:42.244
it, it's bit.ly/news-project.

10
00:00:42.244 --> 00:00:44.946
Let me just make that a little bit
bigger on something so you can see it.

11
00:00:47.782 --> 00:00:49.983
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
this top link right here,

12
00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:54.567
this is if you lost the link to
the current project website,

13
00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:58.431
intro-web-dev, and
this is the news project.

14
00:00:58.431 --> 00:01:03.574
That's just gonna take you to this, so
just some easy short links for you.

15
00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.575
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna open my
project in Visual Studio Code.

16
00:01:09.732 --> 00:01:10.776
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So to remind you,

17
00:01:10.776 --> 00:01:15.033
this is how you open something using
your browser from your file system.

18
00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:18.289
You hit File &gt;Open File,
this should work on Windows,

19
00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.938
this should work on
every operating system.

20
00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:27.204
File &gt; Open, well, it's Cmd-O,
I also believe it's Ctrl-O for Windows.

21
00:01:27.204 --> 00:01:30.308
You'll open this dialogue, and then you
just got to go find where you put it.

22
00:01:30.308 --> 00:01:35.179
For me, it's on my desktop right there,

23
00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.646
FEM, and find the index.html file.

24
00:01:39.646 --> 00:01:43.891
And if you open that, you should
see whatever you have written so

25
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:48.543
far, which for me is this profound
statement from the scholar Brian.

26
00:01:50.025 --> 00:01:53.285
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's just talk about how you kinda break

27
00:01:53.285 --> 00:01:57.169
this down into a smaller
problem that you can solve.

28
00:01:59.458 --> 00:02:04.852
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So pretending that someone
gave me this, not the complete product,

29
00:02:04.852 --> 00:02:09.688
we'll ignore that for now, but
pretending more that someone

30
00:02:09.688 --> 00:02:14.447
gave me this image, right,
this non-interactive image.

31
00:02:14.447 --> 00:02:16.157
He's like, here,
I've made this in InDesign,

32
00:02:16.157 --> 00:02:17.837
I want you to turn this into HTML and
CSS, right?

33
00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:23.040
This is very common, this is how you'll
interact a lot of times with designers,

34
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.033
here's my design,
now go make this a thing, go make it work.

35
00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:28.933
So the first thing,
what I would do is, look at this.

36
00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:31.131
I kinda see three kind of hard sections.

37
00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:33.596
I see the title part,
The News Times at the top.

38
00:02:33.596 --> 00:02:35.973
I see this top row here, and
then I see the bottom row.

39
00:02:35.973 --> 00:02:39.295
And so those are kind of like the things
that I'm gonna break this problem

40
00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:39.848
down into.

41
00:02:39.848 --> 00:02:42.971
So the first thing I'm gonna start
with here is The News Times part.

42
00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:50.096
So get rid of this, and
I'm gonna make this something like.

43
00:02:50.096 --> 00:02:54.890
You can make it a div, you can make it
a section, we'll go with a section.

44
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.258
Like I said, there's no difference
between a div and a section, but

45
00:02:59.258 --> 00:03:02.666
you're kind of just,
here's a partition, right?

46
00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:05.769
Some sort of partition of your website
is a good place to use a section

47
00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:06.593
instead of a div.

48
00:03:06.593 --> 00:03:10.715
It has more meaning than a div,
so it doesn't actually matters.

49
00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:14.364
it's not actually going to change
anything, except for documentation for

50
00:03:14.364 --> 00:03:15.283
your future self.

51
00:03:15.283 --> 00:03:17.391
That's how you choose what
kind of tag you're gonna use.

52
00:03:17.391 --> 00:03:20.593
So we are gonna use a section,
it actually says right there.

53
00:03:20.593 --> 00:03:23.584
A section element represents
a generic section of a document or

54
00:03:23.584 --> 00:03:25.399
an application, thanks Code [LAUGH].

55
00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:28.680
So that's pretty cool.

56
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.984
You could even just make
this an h1 altogether.

57
00:03:34.794 --> 00:03:36.996
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We can do that,
let's do that.

58
00:03:36.996 --> 00:03:42.315
Each one class,
we're gonna call it the main-title or

59
00:03:42.315 --> 00:03:46.629
main-brand, let's go with main-brand.

60
00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.703
And whatever you want to
call your fictitious paper,

61
00:03:49.703 --> 00:03:51.896
it doesn't have to be The News Times.

62
00:03:51.896 --> 00:03:55.478
I kinda of based this
on the New York times,

63
00:03:55.478 --> 00:04:00.168
that's why I came up with
News Times [LAUGH] but up to you.

64
00:04:00.168 --> 00:04:02.008
Okay, so now I have the News Times.

65
00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:06.850
I come over here and I have this now very,
very nice looking whoever,

66
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.946
right here, The News Times.

67
00:04:08.946 --> 00:04:10.293
This is exactly what I wanted to do.

68
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:17.634
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm gonna come over
here and I'm gonna go to my style.css.

69
00:04:17.634 --> 00:04:21.483
I'm gonna change this to main-brand, and

70
00:04:21.483 --> 00:04:25.758
I'm gonna make this much larger,
font-size.

71
00:04:25.758 --> 00:04:31.376
And when writing CSS,
it is a ton of guess and check, right?

72
00:04:31.376 --> 00:04:35.974
So I'm just gonna say,
what happens if this is 50 pixels big?

73
00:04:35.974 --> 00:04:37.200
Refresh the page.

74
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.049
Eh, maybe a bit bigger,
let's do 60 pixels.

75
00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:42.593
Cool.

76
00:04:42.593 --> 00:04:45.282
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Bless you.

77
00:04:47.784 --> 00:04:51.323
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I have that, and
now I'm gonna come back over here.

78
00:04:51.323 --> 00:04:56.385
I was like, okay, I want this to be
centered, so I'm gonna say text-align:

79
00:04:56.385 --> 00:05:01.853
center, and I'm gonna say font-weight:
normal, cuz I don't want it to be bold.

80
00:05:01.853 --> 00:05:08.776
And then I'm gonna do font-family and
cursive, sounds nice.

81
00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:12.809
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now,
if I come over here and

82
00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:16.916
refresh, that's kind of a weird looking
News Times, but sure, it's close enough.

83
00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:20.465
[LAUGH] What did I actually do?

84
00:05:20.465 --> 00:05:22.944
I actually used some
specific font on here,

85
00:05:22.944 --> 00:05:25.095
if you wanna see what I actually used.

86
00:05:25.095 --> 00:05:30.370
Snell Roundhand, you should have guessed
that, I'm very disappointed in all of you.

87
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.375
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

88
00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:34.579
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, this is all of your

89
00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:35.366
faults [LAUGH].

90
00:05:35.366 --> 00:05:41.091
No, there's a thing on Mac called Fontbook
that you can just kinda browse through and

91
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:44.284
see what's actually
stored on your computer.

92
00:05:44.284 --> 00:05:48.713
So here's Brush Script MT,
that's what that looks like.

93
00:05:48.713 --> 00:05:51.953
This is not typically what you would do,
this is more for fun stuff.

94
00:05:51.953 --> 00:05:53.707
Because these are things
that'll be on Macs, and

95
00:05:53.707 --> 00:05:56.632
they won't be on other things, which is
obviously an unacceptable tradeoff if you

96
00:05:56.632 --> 00:05:58.335
were working on something
like Netflix.com.

97
00:05:58.335 --> 00:06:05.267
But nonetheless,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right, we will do this.

98
00:06:05.267 --> 00:06:10.291
Just for fun, there's a thing
called Google Fonts, click on this.

99
00:06:10.291 --> 00:06:13.817
And a ton, a ton, a ton of fonts, right?

100
00:06:13.817 --> 00:06:17.863
I want something that's gonna be cursive.

101
00:06:17.863 --> 00:06:18.712
Here you go.

102
00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:20.502
We actually just want handwriting.

103
00:06:25.568 --> 00:06:27.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there's this,
this looks kind of nice, right?

104
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.671
The Dancing Script.

105
00:06:29.671 --> 00:06:30.733
Or how about here?

106
00:06:30.733 --> 00:06:32.564
Great vibes, that looks perfect right?

107
00:06:32.564 --> 00:06:37.314
So we click on Great Vibes,
you can see what the font looks like.

108
00:06:37.314 --> 00:06:42.272
Then down here at the bottom somewhere,
where is it?

109
00:06:42.272 --> 00:06:43.350
I haven't used this one.

110
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:49.121
Select this font, okay, and
then you click on that and

111
00:06:49.121 --> 00:06:53.144
then you get this link tag right here.

112
00:06:53.144 --> 00:06:55.669
You just copy and paste this,
this little thing right here.

113
00:06:57.742 --> 00:07:00.643
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You come
into your index.html and

114
00:07:00.643 --> 00:07:03.452
you just paste it above your CSS.

115
00:07:03.452 --> 00:07:06.944
So this is gonna bring in
a CSS file from Google, and

116
00:07:06.944 --> 00:07:09.473
it's gonna bring this Great Vibes.

117
00:07:09.473 --> 00:07:13.258
This is okay, because now this is going to
download that font onto every person that

118
00:07:13.258 --> 00:07:14.300
visits your website.

119
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.119
Which is pretty cool, right?

120
00:07:18.727 --> 00:07:22.170
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'm gonna then copy and
paste this font-family right here,

121
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.584
down here at the bottom, and we're gonna
put that into my CSS where I wanna use it.

122
00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:30.099
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So instead of cursive here,

123
00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:33.172
I'm gonna have font-family: 'Great Vibes',
cursive;.

124
00:07:33.172 --> 00:07:34.213
What does this mean?

125
00:07:34.213 --> 00:07:35.492
It means that it's gonna try for
Great Vibes.

126
00:07:35.492 --> 00:07:40.565
If it doesn't find that, it's gonna say
cool, just put on cursive of some sort,

127
00:07:40.565 --> 00:07:45.506
which just means you're gonna get this
weird one that we have on there already.

128
00:07:49.286 --> 00:07:50.376
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
it's gonna look like that.

129
00:07:50.376 --> 00:07:53.476
But now, if I refresh the page,
it's gonna wait for a second and

130
00:07:53.476 --> 00:07:54.861
then, I need to save first.

131
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:57.899
Now if I refresh the page,
now I'm gonna get that instead.

132
00:08:00.803 --> 00:08:01.717
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's pretty cool, right?

133
00:08:01.717 --> 00:08:03.864
And that will work in
every modern browser.

134
00:08:03.864 --> 00:08:07.921
I wanna tell you why this is possibly
why you wouldn't wanna do this.

135
00:08:07.921 --> 00:08:09.481
This adds a lot of page wage, right?

136
00:08:09.481 --> 00:08:13.379
Cuz you're gonna download an entire font,
that's a lot of stuff, especially for

137
00:08:13.379 --> 00:08:14.782
just the title of something.

138
00:08:14.782 --> 00:08:17.560
You probably just wanna make
that an image instead, right?

139
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.938
So that's how you would
bring another font,

140
00:08:19.938 --> 00:08:22.263
that's not something you always wanna do.

141
00:08:22.263 --> 00:08:26.187
If you going to bring another font you
are probably wanna use it a lot, right?

142
00:08:26.187 --> 00:08:27.643
Does that make sense?

143
00:08:27.643 --> 00:08:31.155
The other thing is now Google has a little
bit of tracking in your website, right?

144
00:08:31.155 --> 00:08:33.940
Cuz now there, yeah?

145
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.395
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I just gonna ask, is the
browser smart enough to only get the font

146
00:08:37.395 --> 00:08:40.543
once, or does it follow every page and
reload every time?

147
00:08:40.543 --> 00:08:43.475
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, it caches it,
pretty smartly, no.

148
00:08:43.475 --> 00:08:45.475
That's a good question is how
often is it downloading it?

149
00:08:45.475 --> 00:08:51.757
It should cache it, and keep it for
let's look you can actually see.

150
00:08:51.757 --> 00:08:55.843
So I'm gonna come in here there's in my
dev tools there's a thing called network

151
00:08:55.843 --> 00:08:56.876
monitor over here.

152
00:08:56.876 --> 00:09:02.530
So if I refresh this again,
you can see this font family thing.

153
00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:06.540
And you can see how long the cash control,
it says never get rid of this.

154
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.350
So it's always going to keep it until your
browser just decides to throw it away.

155
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.780
So that's a long time.

156
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.426
[LAUGH] Cuz your browser
will keep quite a bit.

157
00:09:17.173 --> 00:09:19.154
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's a good question.

158
00:09:19.154 --> 00:09:21.769
But what I was gonna say before is
now Google does have a little bit

159
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:23.336
of tracking on your webpage, right?

160
00:09:23.336 --> 00:09:26.718
Every time that someone comes to your
website they're gonna download the font,

161
00:09:26.718 --> 00:09:28.069
and Google keeps track of that.

162
00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:30.664
So it's all tradeoffs.

163
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:36.831
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, but
it's worth it, again, it is cool.

164
00:09:38.956 --> 00:09:40.063
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Things to think about.

165
00:09:42.102 --> 00:09:45.361
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
now we have this News Times thing.

166
00:09:45.361 --> 00:09:47.609
I want it to be a little
bit more spacious, right?

167
00:09:47.609 --> 00:09:50.478
Cuz if we're looking at this, there's
a decent amount of space right at the top.

168
00:09:50.478 --> 00:09:51.577
So what am I gonna do?

169
00:09:51.577 --> 00:09:54.237
I'm gonna put a little bit
of margin on top and bottom.

170
00:09:54.237 --> 00:10:01.568
So I'm gonna say margin maybe 15 pixels,
that's actually less.

171
00:10:01.568 --> 00:10:05.057
I want it to may be 30 pixels,

172
00:10:05.057 --> 00:10:09.499
50 pixels, and let's actually do.

173
00:10:09.499 --> 00:10:12.914
We'll set this as margin top and
margin bottom,

174
00:10:12.914 --> 00:10:18.169
cuz we don't actually wanna one on
the side we just another top and bottom.

175
00:10:19.395 --> 00:10:23.255
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
pretty good, maybe about 60.

176
00:10:26.823 --> 00:10:27.464
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go.

177
00:10:27.464 --> 00:10:29.745
Now, it looks a little bit better.

178
00:10:29.745 --> 00:10:32.720
Now, we were talking about,
yeah, go ahead.

179
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:39.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Isn't it easier to use the
flex stuff for this, just do it center?

180
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.149
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Particularly for text, text
is quite easy to do just without flex.

181
00:10:44.149 --> 00:10:44.867
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

182
00:10:44.867 --> 00:10:49.654
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
you could definitely do this with

183
00:10:49.654 --> 00:10:53.972
flex as well, that would work.

184
00:10:53.972 --> 00:10:56.797
So were talking about
using combined things.

185
00:10:56.797 --> 00:11:02.446
Remember, we did like border: 3px solid
pink Margin has one of these as well.

186
00:11:02.446 --> 00:11:06.569
So have, notice that margin-top and
margin-bottom are the same.

187
00:11:06.569 --> 00:11:11.408
I can actually do margin: 60px 0;

188
00:11:11.408 --> 00:11:16.559
like that and get rid of this bottom too.

189
00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:22.113
And what that means is top and
bottom 60, left and right 0.

190
00:11:22.113 --> 00:11:24.489
Now, you ask me like how do I know that?

191
00:11:24.489 --> 00:11:27.617
I've just done this enough times that
I can remember it off the top my head.

192
00:11:27.617 --> 00:11:32.838
There's also if you wanted
to do different things for

193
00:11:32.838 --> 00:11:35.507
like top, bottom, left,

194
00:11:35.507 --> 00:11:40.496
right you can also do
margin: 60px 0 60px 0,

195
00:11:40.496 --> 00:11:44.691
and this would be the same as this and
this.

196
00:11:44.691 --> 00:11:49.169
It's north, east, south, west,

197
00:11:49.169 --> 00:11:54.520
just like that's how I remember it anyway.

198
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.401
There's also one that you
can do it with three, and

199
00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:00.296
I can never remember what
the order of the three is.

200
00:12:00.296 --> 00:12:04.236
So I never use it, of consequence
is I never used a three version.

201
00:12:04.236 --> 00:12:08.292
And then, the other one,
if you just do one margin: 60px,

202
00:12:08.292 --> 00:12:10.637
that would be 60px on every side.

203
00:12:10.637 --> 00:12:13.019
And padding works the same way,
just so you know.

204
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:18.318
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But I show you that
because you will see this a lot.

205
00:12:18.318 --> 00:12:22.951
So if you see just with two,
it's North South is the first one,

206
00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:25.059
East West is the second one.

207
00:12:25.059 --> 00:12:28.678
Cool, feel good about that.

208
00:12:28.678 --> 00:12:30.383
So we got that.

209
00:12:30.383 --> 00:12:34.361
Something that I will do just when I'm
trying to figure out where stuff is being

210
00:12:34.361 --> 00:12:34.915
laid out.

211
00:12:34.915 --> 00:12:38.644
I'll inspect element and
I'll just throw a border on it so

212
00:12:38.644 --> 00:12:41.852
I can tell like,
where is this actually sitting.

213
00:12:41.852 --> 00:12:44.398
Cuz right now you can't really
tell where it is, right?

214
00:12:44.398 --> 00:12:49.827
But if I just throw in a quick border and
say, border: 1px solid black,

215
00:12:49.827 --> 00:12:55.703
I can see that is actually the space
that it's taking up, it's just helpful.

216
00:12:55.703 --> 00:12:58.915
Now, when I refresh the page till it's
gone, because every time you refresh

217
00:12:58.915 --> 00:13:01.551
the page it drops all the stuff
that you've just written to it.

218
00:13:01.551 --> 00:13:05.534
So cool, good stuff.

219
00:13:05.534 --> 00:13:07.840
Coming back here.

220
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.120
Okay, so
we're gonna tackle this next piece first.

221
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.486
I'm gonna have some sort of section
that's gonna have all this HTML,

222
00:13:16.486 --> 00:13:19.377
CSS in it, and
I have three subsections in it.

223
00:13:19.377 --> 00:13:23.370
And I notice that I can still have a left
one, and the right one the same, and

224
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.498
it's just the middle one
that's gonna be any different.

225
00:13:26.498 --> 00:13:31.707
So come back with index.html,
I'm gonna do a section,

226
00:13:31.707 --> 00:13:38.905
I'm gonna call it,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know, row, maybe?

227
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:44.989
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we talked
a little bit about Emmet yesterday.

228
00:13:44.989 --> 00:13:47.519
I'm so used to doing this,
I'm just always do it.

229
00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:51.485
So I could use section class = roh,

230
00:13:51.485 --> 00:13:55.195
whatever and write it up by hand.

231
00:13:55.195 --> 00:14:00.556
But if you are using VS Code or
for using Emmet which you can find

232
00:14:00.556 --> 00:14:06.437
EMMET.io this will show you how to
install it and everything else,

233
00:14:06.437 --> 00:14:11.203
if you're using like sublime or
something like that.

234
00:14:11.203 --> 00:14:12.902
But if I do section.row,

235
00:14:12.902 --> 00:14:17.704
like I actually put the real CSS selector
right there, and I just hit tab.

236
00:14:17.704 --> 00:14:19.821
It just auto completes it out for me.

237
00:14:19.821 --> 00:14:22.787
So it makes it really fast to write.

238
00:14:22.787 --> 00:14:23.673
Does makes sense?

239
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.994
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You could do the same thing
if I did pound row as you might imagine

240
00:14:28.994 --> 00:14:31.735
that's the CSS selector for
having an ID of row.

241
00:14:31.735 --> 00:14:34.076
So you can go really fast with this.

242
00:14:36.907 --> 00:14:41.456
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so now I have a row,
and I'm gonna have kind of two different

243
00:14:41.456 --> 00:14:44.722
sections in it, or
three different, rather.

244
00:14:44.722 --> 00:14:45.724
I'm gonna have, and

245
00:14:45.724 --> 00:14:49.591
I'm gonna call these articles because
these are kinda article looking, right?

246
00:14:49.591 --> 00:14:51.002
So we're gonna go with article.

247
00:14:53.415 --> 00:14:57.981
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I could just in there as well, article.,

248
00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:04.901
we'll call this like story,
like a new story, something like that.

249
00:15:04.901 --> 00:15:08.255
And these one are gonna be
quarter stories, right?

250
00:15:08.255 --> 00:15:11.801
And this one's going to be a half story,
because it takes up a quarter of the row,

251
00:15:11.801 --> 00:15:13.536
the middle one takes up half of the row.

252
00:15:13.536 --> 00:15:19.854
So I'm gonna call this quarter as well.

253
00:15:19.854 --> 00:15:24.378
These ones have a title, you could put
this as a h1, you could put it as a h2,

254
00:15:24.378 --> 00:15:26.970
you could make a case for
either one of them.

255
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.583
This is the h1 of the article,
but it's the h2 of the page.

256
00:15:30.583 --> 00:15:32.891
I would personally
probably call this an h1.

257
00:15:32.891 --> 00:15:35.818
I tend to use a lot of h1s, but there
are people that would disagree with me.

258
00:15:35.818 --> 00:15:40.103
So that is definitely your judgement call.

259
00:15:40.103 --> 00:15:41.948
So I'm gonna call this story-title.

260
00:15:44.265 --> 00:15:45.613
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And what do I call?

261
00:15:45.613 --> 00:15:52.071
I don't know,
would just say student learn CSS, okay?

262
00:15:52.071 --> 00:15:56.523
Then Benita has well,
two paragraphs of text, so

263
00:15:56.523 --> 00:16:01.801
I'm gonna do story Text.

264
00:16:01.801 --> 00:16:06.786
Now, inside of them,
I wanna put this Lorem Ipsum text, right?

265
00:16:06.786 --> 00:16:11.694
Code will actually generate Lorem Ipsum
text for you, which is quite nice.

266
00:16:11.694 --> 00:16:14.341
So, I wanna say that I put that
angle bracket there to say,

267
00:16:14.341 --> 00:16:17.327
put this inside of there,
that's what the angle bracket means.

268
00:16:17.327 --> 00:16:22.873
And I'm gonna say Lorem maybe 40 words,
so lorem40.

269
00:16:22.873 --> 00:16:27.245
And if I hit Tab,
then I just get this paragraph of

270
00:16:27.245 --> 00:16:30.773
Lorem Ipsum text which is pretty nice.

271
00:16:30.773 --> 00:16:32.756
And then, I actually need two of them.

272
00:16:32.756 --> 00:16:34.739
So I can actually come in here and

273
00:16:34.739 --> 00:16:37.901
say hey, I actually need two of these,
times two.

274
00:16:39.997 --> 00:16:42.485
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, then you can
actually see the preview here.

275
00:16:42.485 --> 00:16:47.276
It shows you what you're actually gonna
auto complete out if you're curious.

276
00:16:47.276 --> 00:16:51.229
So now if I tab here I get two of those.

277
00:16:53.544 --> 00:16:58.218
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then I come back over here,
oops this one.

278
00:16:58.218 --> 00:17:00.224
Yep, looks pretty good.

279
00:17:03.966 --> 00:17:05.335
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions so far?

280
00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:11.129
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now,
if I look like I'm going really fast, and

281
00:17:11.129 --> 00:17:16.319
it's kinda hard to keep up with this, I've
been doing this a really long time, right?

282
00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.653
This has literally been my day job for
a decade.

283
00:17:19.653 --> 00:17:25.310
So, you can feel okay if you're
not going quite the speed.

284
00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.165
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I have done this so

285
00:17:30.165 --> 00:17:33.168
many times, I used to work on
a news website, literally.

286
00:17:33.168 --> 00:17:38.819
So, [LAUGH] this is stuff that I've
all done before a bunch of times.

287
00:17:38.819 --> 00:17:42.150
So please don't feel bad if you're
going a little bit slower than I am.

288
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.096
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

289
00:17:46.096 --> 00:17:49.280
So I'm actually gonna do the whole
HTML for the row first, and

290
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.003
then I'm gonna do the CSS for it.

291
00:17:51.003 --> 00:17:54.697
Cuz I think that would be the easiest way
to kinda get all the layouts correct.

292
00:17:54.697 --> 00:18:02.197
So the next article I'm gonna have here,
it's gonna be another article.

293
00:18:06.094 --> 00:18:08.617
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's gonna
be another story, and

294
00:18:08.617 --> 00:18:11.581
it's gonna be a half this time, right?

295
00:18:11.581 --> 00:18:13.607
Cuz it's gonna take up half the page.

296
00:18:13.607 --> 00:18:22.119
Inside of that, I'm gonna have
another h1 with story-title.

297
00:18:22.119 --> 00:18:25.612
And this one is that dogs are adorable.

298
00:18:28.689 --> 00:18:32.162
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Are adorable, okay?

299
00:18:32.162 --> 00:18:34.614
This one has an image tag.

300
00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:38.919
So the source was, if you remember

301
00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:44.561
correctly, http://placecorgi.com,

302
00:18:44.561 --> 00:18:49.760
actually I think this has to be s, https.

303
00:18:51.902 --> 00:18:59.400
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: / I think I did 500 whoops,
/500/300.

304
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.596
This is gonna give me a 500
by 300 image of a corgi,

305
00:19:02.596 --> 00:19:05.322
which is everything that
I've always wanted.

306
00:19:05.322 --> 00:19:12.091
And I'm gonna put here a picture
of an adorable corgi dog.

307
00:19:16.804 --> 00:19:20.685
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's a big temptation
inside of alt txt to say picture of,

308
00:19:20.685 --> 00:19:21.213
right?

309
00:19:21.213 --> 00:19:23.600
But it's always a picture, right?

310
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.527
It's inside of an image tag,
the screen reader knows it's an image.

311
00:19:26.527 --> 00:19:29.770
It's redundant to put
picture of something,

312
00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:34.268
just say what's actually in the picture,
just pro tip for you.

313
00:19:34.268 --> 00:19:39.549
Okay, then underneath that it's
gonna need one text paragraph,

314
00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:42.106
so I'm gonna put story-text.

315
00:19:42.106 --> 00:19:45.731
And inside of that, Lorem 40 or
something like that.

316
00:19:47.705 --> 00:19:52.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, I refresh here, and
it looks like that link is not working.

317
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:53.826
Why are you not working?

318
00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:03.122
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What did I do?

319
00:20:03.122 --> 00:20:05.505
Let's look at here.

320
00:20:05.505 --> 00:20:10.447
Inspect element, nope,
you do have to do HTTP.

321
00:20:10.447 --> 00:20:11.687
Okay, sorry.

322
00:20:15.324 --> 00:20:20.089
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go.
Okay so this is not secure, it's http:,

323
00:20:20.089 --> 00:20:25.676
I messed that up
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So make sure you get that.

324
00:20:25.676 --> 00:20:27.185
We need one more article and for

325
00:20:27.185 --> 00:20:31.092
the sake of time we're just gonna say
it's literally the same as the first one.

326
00:20:31.092 --> 00:20:34.344
So let's just put that down here as well.

327
00:20:34.344 --> 00:20:37.712
And this will be student learns HTML.

328
00:20:41.046 --> 00:20:42.922
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So coming back over here.

329
00:20:46.221 --> 00:20:49.929
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We now have our kind
of three stories for the top, right?
