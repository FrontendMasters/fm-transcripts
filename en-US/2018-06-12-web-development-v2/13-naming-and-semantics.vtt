00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.580
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
let's talk about naming a little bit.

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.870
There's a stupid computer science
joke that it's probably not

3
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.040
the first time you're gonna hear it and
definitely will not be the last.

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.649
There's two things that
are hard in computer science,

5
00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:19.960
cache invalidation, naming things,
and off-by-one errors.

6
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.592
We're not talking about cache
invalidation, cuz that is actually

7
00:00:24.592 --> 00:00:29.547
quite hard, but we as developers,
computer scientists, engineers,

8
00:00:29.547 --> 00:00:34.763
the stuff that we're doing now,
we name things all the time, constantly.

9
00:00:34.763 --> 00:00:39.825
75% of your job is just naming variables,
naming classes, naming IDs,

10
00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:44.410
naming tags that kind of stuff
we just name things constantly.

11
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.389
So it's tough to name things correctly and
it's always kind of a stuggle,

12
00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:51.930
but it's worth taking time pausing.

13
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.839
Thinking about a good name for something.

14
00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.051
And then if the semantic meaning
changes of whatever you named,

15
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:03.250
going back and actually change the name
to reflect whatever it means now.

16
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.970
Keeping names useful and

17
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.508
up to date is worth the time investment.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

18
00:01:10.508 --> 00:01:12.160
we are definitely not talking
about cache invalidation.

19
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.420
Naming things is hard.

20
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.659
And if you feel like it's hard,
it's because it's hard.

21
00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.240
[LAUGH] So that's accurate.

22
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.940
With classes,
you want to name things semantically.

23
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.729
I've said this word three or four times,
and you're going to hear it a lot,

24
00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.950
particularly with HTML and CSS.

25
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.687
You wanna name things after what they do,
and not what they look like.

26
00:01:38.687 --> 00:01:40.988
And that's what I mean when
I say name it semantically.

27
00:01:40.988 --> 00:01:44.740
Don't name it what it looks like,
name it what it does.

28
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.440
Let's dissect that.

29
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.577
Let's take some examples.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

30
00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:54.460
if I had this blog post right here, right?

31
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.910
My Cool Blog Post, and I was trying
to name this part of it, right?

32
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.800
This title, what would I call it?

33
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.580
There is a huge temptation to name that
red title because if you look at that,

34
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.570
right away you look at that and
it's like, that's red title, right?

35
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.950
And it's really obvious up front.

36
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.420
And for a while, or when you write it,
it makes sense to call that red title.

37
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.167
However, inevitably in the future if you
ever work with designers they want to

38
00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:23.697
change everything all the time.

39
00:02:23.697 --> 00:02:27.065
[LAUGH] And I'm not pointing fingers,
but it's definitely designer's faults.

40
00:02:27.065 --> 00:02:31.990
[LAUGH] Hopefully designers
are not listening to this.

41
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.649
I'm kidding, it's everyone's fault.

42
00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:37.095
But this always inevitably happens
where they come back with like, yeah,

43
00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:41.086
we're changing the branding, or we're
changing something, or it's a Tuesday, so

44
00:02:41.086 --> 00:02:42.250
you should change this.

45
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.870
I don't know, for whatever dumb reasons,
we like changing things all the time.

46
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:53.670
And so later, we come back and
we call it, and now it's green.

47
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.200
However, there's a problem now that the
class name for this is red-title, right?

48
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.036
So now it's actually not even
really describing what it is.

49
00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:02.847
That sucks.

50
00:03:02.847 --> 00:03:10.019
[LAUGH] Because you're going to go through
your CSS, and you're just like, red-title.

51
00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.910
And then you go look for
it on the page, you're like,

52
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.150
there's no red-titles on this.

53
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.470
Where did this come from, right?

54
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.040
And so it actually makes your job harder,
because you're gonna read something and

55
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.310
it doesn't mean what it reads.

56
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.903
And when you have to kinda do that
investigation to see something,

57
00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:27.882
understand it doesn't work, and
then understand why it doesn't work,

58
00:03:27.882 --> 00:03:32.053
that's four more steps that you have to
do before you actually understand how

59
00:03:32.053 --> 00:03:34.064
the system works, and that's bad.

60
00:03:34.064 --> 00:03:36.727
What I'm constantly telling you
is you need to optimize for

61
00:03:36.727 --> 00:03:38.890
your future self and
your future co-workers.

62
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.646
So you wanna do something
that's going to stick.

63
00:03:41.646 --> 00:03:46.520
And the less that you have
to rename things the better.

64
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.040
Because what happens if I'm
using this everywhere, right?

65
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.885
What happens if I have a thousand
different instances of red title and

66
00:03:52.885 --> 00:03:55.016
I have to go back and rename all those?

67
00:03:55.016 --> 00:03:57.530
No, I'm not doing that, right?

68
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.480
It'd be much better if we just called
it something that worked in both

69
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.450
cases, right?

70
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.568
So rather than naming
it what it looks like,

71
00:04:05.568 --> 00:04:07.560
we should name it about what it does.

72
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.680
So what we should call it,
something like post title.

73
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.808
Blog post title.

74
00:04:12.808 --> 00:04:14.675
Blog title.

75
00:04:14.675 --> 00:04:17.826
Something like that,
because if it changes from red to green,

76
00:04:17.826 --> 00:04:19.497
it still describes what it does.

77
00:04:19.497 --> 00:04:21.379
It's still a blog post title.

78
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.565
So does that make sense?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's worth

79
00:04:27.565 --> 00:04:31.458
taking time thinking about it,
don't call what it looks like,

80
00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:35.294
don't call it bold title,
don't call it capitalized title.

81
00:04:35.294 --> 00:04:36.094
I guarantee it,

82
00:04:36.094 --> 00:04:40.160
that whenever you call something like that
it's gonna change to be something else.

83
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.423
It just always happens like that,
you will definitely get burned by this.

84
00:04:44.423 --> 00:04:48.452
You'll still gonna get
burned by it anyway,

85
00:04:48.452 --> 00:04:54.082
because we're constantly burning
ourselves as developers.

86
00:04:54.082 --> 00:04:57.890
But I'm trying to help you have less fire

87
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.033
starter moments I suppose.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here I have another shout

88
00:05:02.033 --> 00:05:04.670
out to make sure that you're
choosing the right tags as well.

89
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.484
If something is an article
call it an article.

90
00:05:07.484 --> 00:05:11.110
If you have a section of your website
name it section, or if it's a nav,

91
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.570
you should call it a nav.

92
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.776
Those sorts of things.

93
00:05:21.658 --> 00:05:22.919
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So don't call it red-title,

94
00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.639
call it blog-post-title or
post-head or something like that.

95
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.396
Describe what it is and

96
00:05:29.396 --> 00:05:34.710
not what it looks like.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions so

97
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.656
far about any of that?

98
00:05:36.656 --> 00:05:40.292
Please.
&gt;&gt; Student: Is it fair to say that naming

99
00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:44.876
convention for
something like this is going to

100
00:05:44.876 --> 00:05:49.225
be a stylistic sort of
thing would maybe have

101
00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:54.200
hyphens over camel case?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's a good question.

102
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.769
Notice here that I'm saying red-tile,
right?

103
00:05:56.769 --> 00:06:01.810
He's asking, this is called kebab case,
in case you're wondering.

104
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.391
I did not make it up.
[LAUGH] That is actually what it's called.

105
00:06:04.391 --> 00:06:07.430
It looks like there's a skewer through it,
yeah?

106
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:14.643
Yeah, CSS is always done as kebab case,
that's by convention.

107
00:06:14.643 --> 00:06:18.097
And one of the reasons that that's
a convention and it's not camel case,

108
00:06:18.097 --> 00:06:20.773
camel case is like where
the first letter is lowercase and

109
00:06:20.773 --> 00:06:24.250
then every word after that is capitalized
and it's all shoved together.

110
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.663
Let's see if I can kinda just
quickly show you what that means.

111
00:06:29.663 --> 00:06:33.922
So if I made this like,

112
00:06:33.922 --> 00:06:37.740
thisIsCamelCase.

113
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.598
Like that, right?

114
00:06:41.598 --> 00:06:43.010
Where it's all shoved together.

115
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.187
That's called camel case, right?

116
00:06:46.187 --> 00:06:52.242
So the reason that CSS is kebab case is
cuz HTML in general is not case sensitive.

117
00:06:52.242 --> 00:06:56.044
So whether something is upper case or
lower case everything is actually,

118
00:06:56.044 --> 00:06:58.204
in the end, gets made lower case in HTML.

119
00:06:58.204 --> 00:07:00.508
So camel case is ultimately meaningless,

120
00:07:00.508 --> 00:07:05.180
because it loses all that information
once it gets put into the browser.

121
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:11.044
So in order to maintain the separation and
readability of everything,

122
00:07:11.044 --> 00:07:16.334
rather than making this camel case,
this-is-kebab-case.

123
00:07:16.334 --> 00:07:17.721
They do it like this for

124
00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:21.820
CSS to make it readable even when
it's still put into the browser.

125
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.046
Does that make sense?

126
00:07:25.046 --> 00:07:29.548
Cool.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here's a bunch of

127
00:07:29.548 --> 00:07:34.644
different cases, I think, anyway,
I won't show you all of them.

128
00:07:34.644 --> 00:07:36.270
Some of them are ridiculous.

129
00:07:38.335 --> 00:07:43.435
My favorite Spongebob cases is when you
alternate from lowercase to uppercase,

130
00:07:43.435 --> 00:07:46.051
I was told that Spongebob case.
&gt;&gt; Student2: I thought that was just

131
00:07:46.051 --> 00:07:48.919
a meme thing.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think that's why it

132
00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:49.821
got named that.

133
00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:51.495
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; multiple: [LAUGH]

134
00:07:51.495 --> 00:07:52.657
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It is a meme thing.

135
00:07:52.657 --> 00:07:53.295
&gt;&gt; Student2: Yeah.
