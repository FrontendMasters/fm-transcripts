WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.024
We have 22 sections here, seems like
a lot and that's because it kind of is.

2
00:00:06.024 --> 00:00:10.649
[LAUGH] But we'll get through this and
yeah, we'll go ahead and

3
00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:14.370
get into the introduction of the course.

4
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.712
So, really, really excited about this.

5
00:00:17.712 --> 00:00:19.839
Of all the courses that I've taught,

6
00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.773
this is one I've definitely
put the most time into.

7
00:00:22.773 --> 00:00:25.671
And this is a particularly
difficult subject to teach,

8
00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:29.630
just because I've been doing programming
for a really, really long time.

9
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.686
And, so I have forgotten what it's
like to learn how to write code.

10
00:00:34.686 --> 00:00:37.883
So, I have all these like layers
of knowledge in my head and

11
00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:40.753
I it's hard for
me to pull them back to say like okay,

12
00:00:40.753 --> 00:00:45.353
how can I speak to someone that doesn't
have the same vocabulary that I do, right?

13
00:00:45.353 --> 00:00:48.580
Something that I spent years and
years taking for granted.

14
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.137
So, your responsibility today both online
and in-person is to keep me honest.

15
00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:56.638
So, if I'm using terminology
that you don't understand or

16
00:00:56.638 --> 00:00:59.886
acronyms that you don't understand,
it's not that I'm trying to be a jerk.

17
00:00:59.886 --> 00:01:02.080
It's not that I'm trying
to inflate my own ego.

18
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.876
My ego is plenty big, believe me.

19
00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:09.337
It's because it's really difficult
to pull back those layers and

20
00:01:09.337 --> 00:01:13.300
realize that what I'm saying is
not vocabulary that you have.

21
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.822
But that being said, I worked really,
really hard to try and

22
00:01:15.822 --> 00:01:17.463
put this on common terms terminology.

23
00:01:17.463 --> 00:01:22.254
So hopefully, that works out, okay?

24
00:01:22.254 --> 00:01:27.085
So, there are some tips here
to succeed in this course.

25
00:01:27.085 --> 00:01:31.930
You don't have to be a wizard
of math to write coding.

26
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.907
In fact, the two subjects in my
opinion are quite orthogonal,

27
00:01:35.907 --> 00:01:37.940
in the sense that they're not.

28
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.734
You've been great at math and
terrible programming and

29
00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:41.690
be great at programming and
terrible at math.

30
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.485
I'm definitely the latter
of those two things.

31
00:01:43.485 --> 00:01:47.587
I don't know if I'm great at programming,
but I'm not very good at math.

32
00:01:47.587 --> 00:01:51.128
And so, that's why a lot of times
when people are approaching coding,

33
00:01:51.128 --> 00:01:55.081
that's one of the first things that I hear
is like I wasn't very good at math, or

34
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:57.340
they kind of try and
relate this back to math.

35
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.491
And like, there are mathematical things in
programming like if you are going to do

36
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:05.118
like data science and things like that,
but that's not necessarily.

37
00:02:05.118 --> 00:02:07.400
You're not gonna be doing like calculus,
right?

38
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.042
I don't think I've ever done
calculus with programming.

39
00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:15.536
So, that's something that you should
disabuse yourself of, like right now,

40
00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:21.120
like especially, what we're doing today,
doesn't have a lot to do with math.

41
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.397
And like I say here, in fact,
I see many artists, lawyers,

42
00:02:24.397 --> 00:02:27.880
linguists that actually have
great success writing code.

43
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.489
So yeah, just know that like,
you can definitely do this.

44
00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.124
This is open to everyone.

45
00:02:35.124 --> 00:02:39.753
In fact, I would say this is actually more
similar to learning a foreign language

46
00:02:39.753 --> 00:02:42.621
than it is to learning than
it is to learning math.

47
00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:46.415
In the sense that you learn a new
way of expressing yourself that you

48
00:02:46.415 --> 00:02:50.770
have an idea in your head and you want
to express that idea basically as code.

49
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.743
It's the same thing like,
when you're learning a language,

50
00:02:53.743 --> 00:02:57.105
you have this amorphous idea of like
what you want to say to the person and

51
00:02:57.105 --> 00:02:59.033
you have to use grammar to express that.

52
00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:01.250
I would say that's
probably a closer analogy.

53
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.017
So, that being said,
what you're going to do today is hard.

54
00:03:07.017 --> 00:03:11.338
[LAUGH] And so,
that there's no two ways about it, but

55
00:03:11.338 --> 00:03:14.997
learning to how to code
is not a simple thing.

56
00:03:14.997 --> 00:03:18.363
It's actually quite difficult and so,
I guarantee you like going through and

57
00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:20.340
learning some of these things.

58
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.605
They're just gonna,
like come up to us like, this is hard.

59
00:03:22.605 --> 00:03:26.078
I don't get this, and then you
start kind of going to the spirals,

60
00:03:26.078 --> 00:03:29.737
like I should get this or I can see
what this other person's doing, and

61
00:03:29.737 --> 00:03:31.554
they get it and I don't get it yet.

62
00:03:31.554 --> 00:03:35.030
Don't, don't go there, like it's not
a useful place to be in your brains.

63
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.334
Don't compare yourself to other people,
don't feel like you should

64
00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:41.305
be getting things like you either
do get it or you don't get it.

65
00:03:41.305 --> 00:03:44.220
And both of those things are okay, right?

66
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.394
There's no right way to do this.

67
00:03:45.394 --> 00:03:47.810
There's no correct speed
that you should be going at.

68
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.805
So, just learn on your own pace,
learn on your own terms.

69
00:03:52.805 --> 00:03:55.301
And sometimes you have to recognize like,

70
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:59.733
my brain is exhausted at this moment in
time and I need to stop, take a break,

71
00:03:59.733 --> 00:04:03.160
go for a walk,
all that kind of stuff before coming back.

72
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.151
So, just like wrecking,
like recognize your own feelings and

73
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:11.158
how you're doing and
kinda take stock of that as we're going.

74
00:04:11.158 --> 00:04:14.571
And just like, just take it easy,

75
00:04:14.571 --> 00:04:19.757
I think that's kind of what
I'm trying to say here.

76
00:04:19.757 --> 00:04:21.562
This one's really important right here.

77
00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:27.114
Never be afraid to Google anything and
everything.

78
00:04:27.114 --> 00:04:29.232
I think I kinda got this
feeling from school,

79
00:04:29.232 --> 00:04:33.260
where I felt like if I was Googling
something it means I was cheating.

80
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.272
But just Google everything,
it's not cheating,

81
00:04:36.272 --> 00:04:38.521
in fact it's actually requirement.

82
00:04:38.521 --> 00:04:41.770
Part of what you're learning
today is how to Google things.

83
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.578
In fact, that's kind of what it
is to be a programmer is like,

84
00:04:44.578 --> 00:04:47.829
we're just giving you additional
vocabulary of how to Google things.

85
00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:50.490
You're a professional Googler today.

86
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.254
So please, please, like at any time,
if you don't remember something,

87
00:04:54.254 --> 00:04:58.221
if you don't remember the order,
something goes in, all that kind of stuff.

88
00:04:58.221 --> 00:05:01.120
Just google it right away.

89
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.603
So, it's not cheating, it's a skill.

90
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.450
Don't be afraid to copy and paste code.

91
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.103
I see a lot of people online saying don't
copy and paste this, blah, blah, blah,

92
00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:12.980
whatever.

93
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.503
Just copy and paste it.

94
00:05:14.503 --> 00:05:19.010
Make your stuff work and then work
backwards to see how it works, right?

95
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.365
That's fine too.

96
00:05:20.365 --> 00:05:23.596
Like I program by
StackOverflow all the time.

97
00:05:23.596 --> 00:05:29.664
[LAUGH] Again, that's a skill as well,
so definitely do that.

98
00:05:29.664 --> 00:05:33.336
If you're not familiar with StackOverflow,
that's a website where you can go in and

99
00:05:33.336 --> 00:05:35.580
ask programming questions and
people will answer.

100
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.632
It's old enough at this point, that most
of the questions you're going to have.

101
00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:43.100
Plenty of other people have
had these questions before.

102
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.896
So, if you just like search for it on
StackOverflow, it'll probably come up.

103
00:05:47.896 --> 00:05:49.423
So, that's a great resource,

104
00:05:49.423 --> 00:05:53.810
you should definitely be checking out
StackOverflow as we go through things.

105
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.100
Be sure to ask dumb questions,
if it's not today to someone else.

106
00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.900
You can always reach out to me on Twitter,
my direct messages are always open.

107
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.860
So please ask lots of questions
to anyone that can answer them.

108
00:06:08.287 --> 00:06:13.990
And [COUGH] for me personally,
like I can be a bit of a slow learner.

109
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.022
And so for me, it's repeatedly
exposing myself to information.

110
00:06:18.022 --> 00:06:20.885
Like the third or
fourth time that I see it or google it or

111
00:06:20.885 --> 00:06:24.956
find it on StackOverflow, that's when
it finally like sinks into my brain.

112
00:06:24.956 --> 00:06:31.030
So if you're like me, then just continue
to expose yourself to that information.

113
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.723
And maybe hopefully,
someday it'll sink in or

114
00:06:35.723 --> 00:06:41.600
you'll just get really good at
googling that one web page.

115
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.075
So, what's really difficult about
learning to code is specifically with web

116
00:06:46.075 --> 00:06:50.138
development, is you have to learn a lot
of things all at once in order for

117
00:06:50.138 --> 00:06:52.200
just kind of get like a basic layer.

118
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.316
And it's really tough because you
have to kind of ignore some things.

119
00:06:56.316 --> 00:06:58.884
We're just gonna throw
a bunch of stuff at you, and

120
00:06:58.884 --> 00:07:01.274
parts of it you're just
gonna have to ignore and

121
00:07:01.274 --> 00:07:05.539
just realize that you're gonna come back
later and more deeply understand things.

122
00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:09.914
I get this with some students that they
wanna understand every piece as it goes

123
00:07:09.914 --> 00:07:14.313
together and there's some parts that
are just not worth learning right now.

124
00:07:14.313 --> 00:07:17.936
And that's really tough for some people
to say ignore that, and they're like no,

125
00:07:17.936 --> 00:07:20.390
I don't wanna ignore it,
I wanna learn that right now.

126
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:25.114
And you have to recognize that your
brain only has so much capacity for

127
00:07:25.114 --> 00:07:27.318
shoving stuff in it all at once.

128
00:07:27.318 --> 00:07:30.099
And so,
if you start shoving it minor details,

129
00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:35.118
you're kind of precluding yourself from
right now learning more important things.

130
00:07:35.118 --> 00:07:39.507
Again, I would compare this to learning a
foreign language because in order to like

131
00:07:39.507 --> 00:07:43.269
actually have a full conversation
with someone in a foreign language,

132
00:07:43.269 --> 00:07:46.548
you have to understand actually
quite a bit of stuff, right?

133
00:07:46.548 --> 00:07:49.910
You have to understand like grammatical
structures and syntax and conjugations and

134
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.190
agreements and those kinds of things and
it's kind of the same with programming.

135
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:58.058
You have to understand this whole set of
things before you can kind of put pieces

136
00:07:58.058 --> 00:07:58.807
together.

137
00:07:58.807 --> 00:08:01.473
So definitely, what I'm trying not,
trying to do too today is,

138
00:08:01.473 --> 00:08:04.055
have you ever seen that picture,
it's like how to draw an owl.

139
00:08:04.055 --> 00:08:09.357
[LAUGH] It's like draw a circle, and
then step two is draw the rest of the owl.

140
00:08:09.357 --> 00:08:12.228
[LAUGH] I'm trying not to do that today.

141
00:08:12.228 --> 00:08:15.556
So hopefully, what I'm going to
present you with it is like,

142
00:08:15.556 --> 00:08:18.381
here is a mostly complete and
now just draw the eyes.

143
00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:20.161
I want to learn things like that.

144
00:08:20.161 --> 00:08:24.287
We're kinda have to accept, I drew most of
the elf for you in the first place, and

145
00:08:24.287 --> 00:08:26.730
eventually you'll learn
how to do that later.

146
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:33.380
That's kind of the methodology for today.

147
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.630
Yeah, lastly,
this is not a get-rich-quick scheme.

148
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:41.484
And I get that quite a bit as well from
people learning how to code as they

149
00:08:41.484 --> 00:08:46.258
want to get like a Google job
making $500,000 a year today and

150
00:08:46.258 --> 00:08:49.320
it's like, this is actually a lot of work.

151
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.463
And despite, the fact that it doesn't
require you going to a university for

152
00:08:53.463 --> 00:08:56.960
four years and getting that
certificate and that kind of stuff,

153
00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.400
it's still a ton of work.

154
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:04.280
It requires a lot of investment, so
be prepared to work hard like this is

155
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:09.877
not something that's gonna make
you rich overnight, so that too.

156
00:09:09.877 --> 00:09:14.401
And entry level jobs are out there,
but you're gonna have to compete and

157
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:15.760
work hard for him.

158
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:22.788
So, it's possible, you should definitely
try, I think, but it is hard.

159
00:09:22.788 --> 00:09:31.310
So, The last thing I wanna say is just
kind of like how I structured this course.

160
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:35.039
And this is coming from a lot of
iterations from teaching a lot of these

161
00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:35.755
workshops.

162
00:09:35.755 --> 00:09:40.442
This used to be more structured towards
like exercises, like almost like homework,

163
00:09:40.442 --> 00:09:43.778
and homework that just pains me to say,
cuz I hate homework.

164
00:09:43.778 --> 00:09:46.510
[LAUGH] I was not very good at
homework when I was in college.

165
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.736
So, I found that when I gave
these exercises to people,

166
00:09:50.736 --> 00:09:54.792
a lot of times they would just like look
at it as like I don't know where to start,

167
00:09:54.792 --> 00:09:56.386
I don't know where to do this.

168
00:09:56.386 --> 00:09:59.589
And it actually just bore, like a lot of
frustration out of people rather than

169
00:09:59.589 --> 00:10:02.250
actually people like sitting there and
learning.

170
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.782
So, this workshop is more oriented
towards experimentation and playing so

171
00:10:06.782 --> 00:10:11.479
rather than having like a clear objective,
I present you with a bunch of code.

172
00:10:11.479 --> 00:10:14.956
And then, I was like, okay, now just
mess around with it and break it and

173
00:10:14.956 --> 00:10:15.592
unbreak it.

174
00:10:15.592 --> 00:10:20.780
And try doing this and refreshing and
all these kinds of different things,

175
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.674
and then we have a couple of big projects.

176
00:10:23.674 --> 00:10:26.375
And that's kind of where we'll
you'll actually get in and

177
00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:29.671
like actually write things by yourself but
during the course, in fact,

178
00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:31.308
we'll get to that in just a second.

179
00:10:31.308 --> 00:10:35.389
There's actually live code inside of
this website that you can just play with

180
00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:38.297
directly which will be
hopefully beneficial for you.

181
00:10:38.297 --> 00:10:40.296
This is how I think,
I would have preferred to learn,

182
00:10:40.296 --> 00:10:42.170
so I'm hoping that this will work for
you as well.
