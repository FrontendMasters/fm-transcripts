00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.862
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There are pseudoelements
which are a little bit more advanced-use

2
00:00:03.862 --> 00:00:07.250
case, which I don't really care
to get into here too much.

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.745
But basically if I have like a dev,

4
00:00:09.745 --> 00:00:13.280
a great example is this
result thing right here.

5
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.470
Notice this says like result here,

6
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.850
it was a nice way to indicate this is
a result of what's up here, right?

7
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.097
This actually is a pseudo element that I
say any time you have this kind of box,

8
00:00:25.097 --> 00:00:27.219
put this result thing up here.

9
00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:29.371
So this is actually
being generated by CSS,

10
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:32.580
it's not actually being generated by HTML.

11
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.921
That is done through a pseudoelement, and

12
00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:37.595
we can spend a whole bunch
of time learning that.

13
00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:41.121
I don't really care to get
into it too much now, but

14
00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:44.780
I left you an article if you
would like to get into it.

15
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.713
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Again,
from our good friends at CSS-Tricks,

16
00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.580
I feel they should pay me at this point.

17
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.483
I've said that a lot [LAUGH].

18
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.510
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions about selectors.

19
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.235
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think I pretty much tell
you everything about selectors just in

20
00:01:05.235 --> 00:01:08.473
general, or there is one more
I'm gonna tell you about that,

21
00:01:08.473 --> 00:01:10.795
you should almost never use except always.

22
00:01:10.795 --> 00:01:16.224
But before I get into that
are there any questions?

23
00:01:20.407 --> 00:01:25.290
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
there's one called the wildcard selector.

24
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.076
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I'm just gonna delete these here for

25
00:01:32.076 --> 00:01:37.187
just a second, I put *,
which means everything.

26
00:01:37.187 --> 00:01:38.719
Everything should have this.

27
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.305
And I'm gonna say everything
should be font-weight bold.

28
00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:49.410
Notice everything on my
website just became bold.

29
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.280
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's kinda fun, right?

30
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.172
That is what the wildcard does for you,

31
00:01:58.172 --> 00:02:02.030
it selects literally every
element like everything.

32
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.758
It has specificity of zero,
so it's the most easily

33
00:02:06.758 --> 00:02:11.490
thing to over ride, but
it does select everything.

34
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.687
Now, how often should do you use this?

35
00:02:16.687 --> 00:02:18.040
Pretty much never.

36
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.787
There's once very, very,

37
00:02:20.787 --> 00:02:24.440
very specific use case that we're
gonna get into here in just a second.

38
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.650
You will do this with a box-sizing,
border-box.

39
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.700
I actually put this little snippet of
CSS on every single website I develop.

40
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.182
Just once, you only need it once.

41
00:02:39.182 --> 00:02:42.773
But otherwise never use this wildcard, and

42
00:02:42.773 --> 00:02:48.413
we're about to get to what this does,
so just ignore it for a second.
