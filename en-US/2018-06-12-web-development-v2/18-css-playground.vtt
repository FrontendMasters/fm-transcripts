WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.339
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I gave you,
here, this CodePen.

2
00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:04.788
So CodePen is a website that I just
kind of hold near and dear to my heart.

3
00:00:04.788 --> 00:00:07.420
I think most web developers do.

4
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.298
It's kind of like the playground I gave
you, but it's even more elaborate and

5
00:00:11.298 --> 00:00:12.194
has more things.

6
00:00:12.194 --> 00:00:15.184
So what I would actually invite you to
do is click on this edit on CodePen,

7
00:00:15.184 --> 00:00:15.731
right here.

8
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.853
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's gonna
open this website for you.

9
00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:23.978
You can kind of just ignore the JS part,
cuz we're not doing any JS right now.

10
00:00:28.085 --> 00:00:31.765
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you can see here,
I did a bunch of HTML.

11
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:39.425
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, h1, h2,
h1, a bunch of CSS over

12
00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:44.262
here
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: To affect that and

13
00:00:44.262 --> 00:00:47.759
then you can see down here is like what
that actually ends up looking like.

14
00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:51.558
So I would say just like play
with it to your heart's content.

15
00:00:51.558 --> 00:00:57.037
And I'll kind of like step through like
how these things are working with a and

16
00:00:57.037 --> 00:00:57.973
yeah, why.

17
00:01:00.186 --> 00:01:04.579
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this h1, right here.

18
00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:08.236
First thing I want you to point
out cuz there's an h1 here and

19
00:01:08.236 --> 00:01:12.694
there's another one right there, and
I have an h1, select right here.

20
00:01:12.694 --> 00:01:16.556
So it affects both of them no matter
where they are on the page, right?

21
00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:21.127
Cuz it matches like anytime this
is an h1 then apply these things.

22
00:01:21.127 --> 00:01:22.006
Make sense?

23
00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:26.031
So that's why this one is
equally affected as this one.

24
00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:32.374
Cuz they both match the rule, so the rule
can be matched multiple times, okay.

25
00:01:32.374 --> 00:01:37.500
Font family, this is a font, right, so
the font is like how the font looks.

26
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.453
You can see that this font
looks different than this one.

27
00:01:41.453 --> 00:01:44.924
Right, they're using different fonts.

28
00:01:44.924 --> 00:01:49.717
Font could also be called like
a type set or something like that.

29
00:01:49.717 --> 00:01:51.228
Is anyone confused by the word font?

30
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.352
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
color red font size 50 pixels.

31
00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:03.121
It's quite large and
then text align right.

32
00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:05.957
So you can see here that it's
being pushed over to the right.

33
00:02:05.957 --> 00:02:07.494
That's what the text align right does.

34
00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:09.182
It says move this all the way
to the right side of the page.

35
00:02:12.494 --> 00:02:18.525
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, then we go down to
the h2, where it says this is the h2.

36
00:02:18.525 --> 00:02:19.899
Font family Monaco.

37
00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:24.274
Monaco is a monospaced font.

38
00:02:24.274 --> 00:02:29.916
And all that means is that every
character is exactly the same width.

39
00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:34.296
Whereas, if you look at this one this i,
is not nearly as wide as this h,

40
00:02:34.296 --> 00:02:35.834
right the h is far wider.

41
00:02:35.834 --> 00:02:39.598
Whereas Monaco, every one of
these is exactly the same width.

42
00:02:39.598 --> 00:02:40.566
It's monospace.

43
00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:45.019
That's what that means.

44
00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.432
The color is sea green.

45
00:02:47.432 --> 00:02:51.486
You can see that it's
a nice tealish color.

46
00:02:51.486 --> 00:02:55.379
Font size 40 pixels you can see it's
slightly smaller than this one.

47
00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:00.642
The border is 9 pixels dotted gray, so
you can see here they're dots on the side.

48
00:03:00.642 --> 00:03:07.443
There's also dashed and
there's also double I think is one, right?

49
00:03:07.443 --> 00:03:10.467
So there's a bunch of different kind
of border styles that you can use.

50
00:03:10.467 --> 00:03:13.749
I'll be honest I think really the only
one that I ever use is solid.

51
00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.285
But just they're out there.

52
00:03:16.285 --> 00:03:21.159
There's a bunch of stuff out there,
and then text to line center.

53
00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.801
So a curious thing you might be
noticing is, well, I have this h2 and

54
00:03:25.801 --> 00:03:29.015
the border goes all the way to the edge,
right?

55
00:03:29.015 --> 00:03:32.997
That's because these h1
will take the entire line,

56
00:03:32.997 --> 00:03:37.165
unless you tell them not to,
they take the entire line.

57
00:03:37.165 --> 00:03:41.013
We'll get to how to tell them
to not take the entire line, but

58
00:03:41.013 --> 00:03:46.369
by default divs take the whole line, h1
through h6, they all take the whole line,

59
00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:50.230
paragraphs take the whole line,
that's just what they do.

60
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.768
Unless you again instruct them
otherwise which we'll get there.

61
00:03:56.956 --> 00:03:58.524
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, paragraph.

62
00:03:58.524 --> 00:04:00.483
So we go down to the paragraph.

63
00:04:00.483 --> 00:04:04.601
Font family comic sans,
everyone's favorite font, I would say.

64
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:09.721
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Are the font
families standard from computer

65
00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:14.713
to computer whether you're on Mac or
is it?

66
00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:17.396
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The answer to
that question is yes and no,

67
00:04:17.396 --> 00:04:20.089
as any good question should be answered.

68
00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.270
There are a handful that
you can pretty well rely,

69
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.739
every computer has Aerial on it,
every computer as Helveticca on it,

70
00:04:27.739 --> 00:04:30.788
only Mac has San Francisco on it,
for example.

71
00:04:30.788 --> 00:04:33.619
So if you're on a Mac,
there is a thing called Font Book.

72
00:04:37.053 --> 00:04:41.807
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you can see on here,
these are the web fonts.

73
00:04:41.807 --> 00:04:46.075
If something, I don't what the equivalent
is on Windows for this but

74
00:04:46.075 --> 00:04:51.018
this it happens to exist for Mac, like
every computer has times new roman on it.

75
00:04:51.018 --> 00:04:53.233
So, there's certain things that
you can depend on being there.

76
00:04:53.233 --> 00:04:55.803
There's, whereas like I think mono code,

77
00:04:55.803 --> 00:04:59.422
I'm not sure you can depend on
that being on a every computer.

78
00:04:59.422 --> 00:05:04.012
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So what if you wanna use
a font, that you're not guaranteed it is

79
00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:08.352
gonna be on somebody's computer,
then how does that work?

80
00:05:08.352 --> 00:05:14.792
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: My first answer
to that question is don't.

81
00:05:14.792 --> 00:05:17.079
I know, I'm a jerk, I know.

82
00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:21.543
My second answer to that question is it is
possible, there's a thing called web fonts

83
00:05:21.543 --> 00:05:24.713
where you can basically include
fonts from Google usually.

84
00:05:24.713 --> 00:05:29.714
Google has a thing where you can just
like conclude their fonts on your page.

85
00:05:29.714 --> 00:05:30.930
But usually it's unnecessary.

86
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.070
Usually you can just say like
well you're trying to use

87
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.507
this like super impact ms font.

88
00:05:37.507 --> 00:05:41.508
Just use helvetica and call it a day or
something like that right.

89
00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:43.807
Usually you can just switch
to something else and

90
00:05:43.807 --> 00:05:46.229
not really sacrifice too
much in the way of design.

91
00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.406
And the reason why I say that is
those fonts usually end up being

92
00:05:50.406 --> 00:05:55.145
several hundred kilobytes, which is,
that's a lot of page weight,

93
00:05:55.145 --> 00:05:57.578
which in my opinion is not worth it.

94
00:05:57.578 --> 00:06:02.970
I know, been telling them for years,
and I will be telling them for years.

95
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.073
Does that answer your question?

96
00:06:04.073 --> 00:06:04.913
Okay, cool.

97
00:06:09.218 --> 00:06:13.162
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So a bunch of these
that I'm showing you are, well,

98
00:06:13.162 --> 00:06:15.682
Comic Sans is on every computer.

99
00:06:15.682 --> 00:06:20.386
Not that you should do anything in
Comic Sans, [LAUGH] but you can.

100
00:06:20.386 --> 00:06:26.552
So that's what you can see here is that
font size 30 pixels, background black.

101
00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:32.399
So that's why its black and then the color
is white and that's why it's on there,

102
00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:37.076
and then you can see in here that
I have some spans in here, right?

103
00:06:37.076 --> 00:06:42.304
And if you go down to span,
you can see that I have yellow

104
00:06:42.304 --> 00:06:47.761
underlined in italic and
you can see just that text that is

105
00:06:47.761 --> 00:06:52.894
inside the span is yellow and
underlined and italic.

106
00:06:52.894 --> 00:06:57.234
So that's what spans do,
they they do specific blocks of text.

107
00:07:00.885 --> 00:07:05.475
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Div, so
you can see here that did color blue and

108
00:07:05.475 --> 00:07:09.713
then inside of the div there's an h3, but

109
00:07:09.713 --> 00:07:15.747
the selector says div color blue,
so that h3 is still blue.

110
00:07:15.747 --> 00:07:20.999
So that's how it got that.

111
00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:25.041
Then if you go down to the ol,
you can see here,

112
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:32.222
there is a thing called list style and
there's several ways of doing list styles.

113
00:07:32.222 --> 00:07:34.958
So in this case I'm doing
roman numeral numbering.

114
00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.550
Roman numeral numbering.

115
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.635
But you can also do,
well if I just get rid of it.

116
00:07:41.635 --> 00:07:45.216
It'll go back to being numbers,
cuz that's what it is by default.

117
00:07:45.216 --> 00:07:47.963
Then you can change it to
upper Roman numerals and

118
00:07:47.963 --> 00:07:51.583
I think you can also do lower and
that also works as well, right?

119
00:07:51.583 --> 00:07:53.716
And they're lowercase
instead of uppercase.

120
00:07:56.365 --> 00:07:58.249
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But something you can do,

121
00:07:58.249 --> 00:08:03.735
which just to show you how flexible CSS
is, I can also do, I think, bullet.

122
00:08:03.735 --> 00:08:09.543
Nope, not bullet, but
I know square will work.

123
00:08:09.543 --> 00:08:11.314
So I change this to squares.

124
00:08:11.314 --> 00:08:12.645
Here's the problem, right?

125
00:08:12.645 --> 00:08:15.905
This is an ordered list, right?

126
00:08:15.905 --> 00:08:20.687
An ordered list has to be in that order or
it's considered not an ordered list,

127
00:08:20.687 --> 00:08:21.200
right?

128
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.504
It would be an unordered list.

129
00:08:22.504 --> 00:08:26.382
But I can style use CSS to
style it exactly the same way.

130
00:08:26.382 --> 00:08:31.443
This is going to be a common theme
throughout html and CSS for you.

131
00:08:31.443 --> 00:08:34.819
You can use and
abuse CSS as much as you want.

132
00:08:34.819 --> 00:08:38.529
You can play outside the system
as much as you want, but don't.

133
00:08:38.529 --> 00:08:41.734
The reason why you don't wanna do it is,
you screw up screen readers.

134
00:08:41.734 --> 00:08:43.682
And like that is a huge problem.

135
00:08:43.682 --> 00:08:47.550
So, you should learn how to and
then never do it.

136
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:52.267
[LAUGH] That's what I'm
trying to teach you.

137
00:08:52.267 --> 00:08:55.920
So, if something is an ordered list, make
sure that it looks like an ordered list,

138
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.340
that's all I'm trying to say.

139
00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:05.686
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So here, this is
the square instead of the normal circle.

140
00:09:05.686 --> 00:09:08.402
If I remove this, you'll see that
they go back to being circles.

141
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.017
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and

142
00:09:12.017 --> 00:09:15.129
then I made everything brown with
by changing the LI to brown.

143
00:09:17.614 --> 00:09:20.458
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then I have
another h2 at the end of the page.

144
00:09:24.551 --> 00:09:28.786
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions
about what you saw here?

145
00:09:31.124 --> 00:09:32.260
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah?

146
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.006
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a question
from Chad, about selectors.

147
00:09:35.006 --> 00:09:39.254
If you have two selectors like a div and
an h3 and you try and

148
00:09:39.254 --> 00:09:44.458
change the color in CSS, what
are the operations in terms of, which one

149
00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:50.055
decides the color of h3 if you have
the h3 separate, but also within a div?

150
00:09:50.055 --> 00:09:53.998
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question and
the entire next section talks about it.

151
00:09:53.998 --> 00:09:57.220
So, yeah,
I'm glad that you're thinking about that.

152
00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.711
It's a pain in the ass.

153
00:09:58.711 --> 00:10:07.535
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, go ahead.

154
00:10:07.535 --> 00:10:11.962
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And is it okay to,
within a span, assign a class to that?

155
00:10:11.962 --> 00:10:13.914
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

156
00:10:13.914 --> 00:10:16.025
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we'll be talking about
classes here in just a second as well.

157
00:10:16.025 --> 00:10:17.002
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I also like that

158
00:10:17.002 --> 00:10:18.034
you're thinking about that.

159
00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:18.787
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

160
00:10:18.787 --> 00:10:20.131
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: She's asking
about boiler plate.

161
00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:22.172
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Boiler plate for CSS.

162
00:10:22.172 --> 00:10:23.699
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I see what you're saying.

163
00:10:23.699 --> 00:10:29.407
No, there's no like ceremony or
rituals with CSS.

164
00:10:29.407 --> 00:10:34.684
This is exactly what your CSS
style sheet will look like.

165
00:10:34.684 --> 00:10:36.933
It's just a bunch of rules.

166
00:10:36.933 --> 00:10:38.029
Does that answer your question?

167
00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:41.263
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay cool, thank you,

168
00:10:41.263 --> 00:10:44.396
that's a good question.

169
00:10:44.396 --> 00:10:48.750
So with this HTML,
this HTML does not have the ceremony,

170
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:52.570
the ritual boilerplate around it,
but it would.

171
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:57.608
And if you actually like inspect element
and go through it, you would see it.

172
00:10:57.608 --> 00:10:59.074
This guy Justice is awesome.

173
00:10:59.074 --> 00:11:04.573
He's from Nigeria.

174
00:11:04.573 --> 00:11:07.737
He can't wait to see what you unleash.

175
00:11:07.737 --> 00:11:08.431
Neither can I.
