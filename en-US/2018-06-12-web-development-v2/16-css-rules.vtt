00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
if I have an h1 right here, and

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.918
I wanted to make this h1 red,
something like this.

3
00:00:07.918 --> 00:00:09.814
So how would I do that?

4
00:00:09.814 --> 00:00:12.629
You can't do that with just HTML.

5
00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.963
You need something else to come in and
effect that.

6
00:00:15.963 --> 00:00:20.284
So we're gonna write a CSS
rule to make that the case.

7
00:00:20.284 --> 00:00:22.028
So that is going to look like this.

8
00:00:22.028 --> 00:00:24.393
This is what CSS looks like.

9
00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:30.131
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's break down all of the pieces here.

10
00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:32.356
I have an h1 right here, right?

11
00:00:32.356 --> 00:00:34.285
This is called the selector.

12
00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:40.403
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The selector selects,
I think that follows, right?

13
00:00:40.403 --> 00:00:44.294
So in this case it's going to say,
every h1 on the page,

14
00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:49.258
if it is an h1, then apply everything
between the curly braces, okay?

15
00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:51.709
So these are called curly
braces in case you didn't know.

16
00:00:54.103 --> 00:00:57.216
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [COUGH] So it is apply
everything between the curly braces.

17
00:00:57.216 --> 00:01:04.288
Now we only have one thing to
apply between the curly braces.

18
00:01:04.288 --> 00:01:07.165
We say, the color: red.

19
00:01:07.165 --> 00:01:14.171
Color is called a property, so
there's how many properties?

20
00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:17.652
I said right there,
there are about 350 properties.

21
00:01:17.652 --> 00:01:22.064
This is a lot like HTML,
that you really are only gonna use,

22
00:01:22.064 --> 00:01:26.138
again, maybe 50 to 100 of them,
there's a lot.

23
00:01:26.138 --> 00:01:27.998
And there are people that are more,

24
00:01:27.998 --> 00:01:31.293
are better at this than I am that
will probably use more things.

25
00:01:31.293 --> 00:01:36.452
But for the most part, there's gonna be
about 50 of them that are gonna use a lot,

26
00:01:36.452 --> 00:01:39.935
and then the rest you're rarely,
if ever going to use.

27
00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:44.241
So color, as you may imagine is
quite useful, we use it quite a bit.

28
00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:48.440
So color is going to
change the font color.

29
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.216
That's just what it does.

30
00:01:50.216 --> 00:01:54.064
It's one of those things that you kind of
just have to know what these things do.

31
00:01:54.064 --> 00:01:55.552
And you can always Google it.

32
00:01:55.552 --> 00:01:57.690
You could just Google how
do I change font color, and

33
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.984
I guarantee it would be one
of the first things on there.

34
00:01:59.984 --> 00:02:05.010
So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then I

35
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.950
put red here, this is called the value.

36
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.055
And red happens to be
a value that CSS understands.

37
00:02:14.055 --> 00:02:16.362
It understands what red means.

38
00:02:16.362 --> 00:02:22.833
So that's why this works,
it turns the color red.

39
00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:25.873
We saw hex before,
you can also put hex here.

40
00:02:25.873 --> 00:02:29.345
In fact, I put right here all
the ones that CSS understands.

41
00:02:29.345 --> 00:02:32.398
It understands a bunch of
different ways of doing color.

42
00:02:32.398 --> 00:02:37.070
It understands hexadecimal,
it understands rgb.

43
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.131
This is how you would do rgb right here.

44
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:42.620
And it also understands hsl.

45
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.630
Which I do not know
nearly enough about hsl.

46
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.254
It stands for hue, saturation,
and lightness, I think.

47
00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:52.157
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Luminosity.

48
00:02:52.157 --> 00:02:52.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Luminosity.

49
00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:58.298
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's a mystery,
I'm just kidding.

50
00:02:58.298 --> 00:03:00.341
I know, I never use it,
I'll put it that way.

51
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:06.653
[LAUGH] And then it understands
150 what are called named colors.

52
00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:08.812
And there's some really
weird named colors.

53
00:03:10.742 --> 00:03:15.041
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But if you understand more
about like how CSS can do colors, I put

54
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:20.629
a link to an article there on CSS tricks,
really explains everything really well.

55
00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.175
And I'm not going to explain
it to you anymore than that,

56
00:03:23.175 --> 00:03:26.581
but,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

57
00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:28.578
then you see here there is a semicolon.

58
00:03:28.578 --> 00:03:32.707
That's just like punctuation in CSS it's
saying like I am done with this sentence.

59
00:03:32.707 --> 00:03:37.405
It really is like a period or
a full stop for CSS.

60
00:03:37.405 --> 00:03:41.481
You just at the end of every line you
just put a semicolon to say, I'm done and

61
00:03:41.481 --> 00:03:43.343
I'm gonna go onto the next thing.

62
00:03:43.343 --> 00:03:44.447
It does have to be there.

63
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:53.807
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I can put a lot
of things inside these rules.

64
00:03:53.807 --> 00:03:55.519
It doesn't just have to be one thing.

65
00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.902
You can see here, I do a lot more.

66
00:03:57.902 --> 00:04:02.168
So I knew another color,
limegreen is the color.

67
00:04:02.168 --> 00:04:06.020
Font-size 60 pixels,
that's the px stands for.

68
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.666
There are lots of ways of
doing measurements in CSS.

69
00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:16.538
So just like I can say,
that this person's five foot tall or so

70
00:04:16.538 --> 00:04:22.557
many centimeters tall, or
that are like 0.0001 miles tall, right?

71
00:04:22.557 --> 00:04:28.601
There's many different measurements for
doing height, just like there is for CSS.

72
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:32.324
You can do it in pixels,
you can do it in ms, you can do it in x.

73
00:04:32.324 --> 00:04:36.022
You can do it in centimeters,
you can do it in inches.

74
00:04:36.022 --> 00:04:39.069
There's a lot of ways to do that.

75
00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:44.475
I will say that mostly really
only use pixels and ems.

76
00:04:48.411 --> 00:04:50.211
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's maybe about it,
yeah.

77
00:04:50.211 --> 00:04:54.997
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So why are you just writing
the font size if you're already doing h1,

78
00:04:54.997 --> 00:04:57.119
that determines how big it is?

79
00:04:57.119 --> 00:05:00.311
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question, so

80
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:05.236
why are we telling it
a different font size?

81
00:05:05.236 --> 00:05:09.575
I guess maybe that's what our designs
dictated, that we wanted to be bigger or

82
00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:11.428
smaller, something like that.

83
00:05:11.428 --> 00:05:16.879
I think the default font size for
h1 is 36, if I'm not mistaken?

84
00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:20.654
36 pixels, so
you can see here this is quite large.

85
00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:25.744
So the reason why we would do that
is because we want to be larger.

86
00:05:25.744 --> 00:05:32.241
We designed it for some reason to be
larger than that, cuz we wanted to.

87
00:05:32.241 --> 00:05:35.101
[LAUGH] I don't know if I have
a better explanation than that.

88
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.219
Does that answer your question,
or not answer your question?

89
00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:42.341
[LAUGH] It is a good question though.

90
00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:47.070
Or for example, what if we
wanted it to not be bold, right?

91
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.718
Because, by default, yeah.

92
00:05:50.718 --> 00:05:54.438
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I was just wondering
if you could explain ems.

93
00:05:54.438 --> 00:05:55.313
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure.

94
00:05:55.313 --> 00:06:02.234
I think I have on here as well, another
CSS tricks article about measurements.

95
00:06:02.234 --> 00:06:08.092
So I will explain ems
because they are useful.

96
00:06:08.092 --> 00:06:10.612
A lot of times we're doing relative sizes.

97
00:06:10.612 --> 00:06:13.321
We want things to be like
relatively sized rather than just

98
00:06:13.321 --> 00:06:14.771
being like absolutely sized.

99
00:06:14.771 --> 00:06:16.987
So pixels is an absolute sizing.

100
00:06:16.987 --> 00:06:23.038
It's actually not literally pixels just so
you know, but we call them that.

101
00:06:23.038 --> 00:06:26.790
Ems is measured in relation to
what your font choice is, right?

102
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:32.230
So if I change fonts, then I want
the sizing to be relative to the font,

103
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:37.316
so what it actually does is it
measures the width of a lowercase m.

104
00:06:37.316 --> 00:06:39.412
That, something like that, right?

105
00:06:39.412 --> 00:06:44.331
And that's what ems is,
it's literally ms long.

106
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:45.682
Weird, right?

107
00:06:45.682 --> 00:06:51.415
[LAUGH] But it ends up being really
useful because even if you change fonts,

108
00:06:51.415 --> 00:06:56.328
all of your measurements will
change in relation to your font.

109
00:06:56.328 --> 00:07:00.723
It's a little confusing but
it actually ends up being quite nice.

110
00:07:00.723 --> 00:07:06.146
There's also xex, and
if that's the height of a lowercase x.

111
00:07:06.146 --> 00:07:12.043
I never use that one, [LAUGH] But
you can see the CSS tricks here,

112
00:07:12.043 --> 00:07:15.387
article to see all the rest of them.

113
00:07:15.387 --> 00:07:17.548
And that's how you write ems right there,
it's.

114
00:07:22.872 --> 00:07:23.792
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

115
00:07:26.866 --> 00:07:31.314
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions
on measurements, furthermore?

116
00:07:31.314 --> 00:07:32.973
I measure almost everything in pixels.

117
00:07:32.973 --> 00:07:34.400
Probably more things than I should.

118
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.827
It's just something that I've done for so

119
00:07:37.827 --> 00:07:42.212
long that you just kind of get
used to doing it that way.

120
00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:45.843
You will see things occasionally in rems.

121
00:07:45.843 --> 00:07:52.545
There's some weird behaviors
if you have resized ems.

122
00:07:52.545 --> 00:07:55.537
I don't really wanna get too
deep into that rabbit hole.

123
00:07:55.537 --> 00:07:56.728
It's a deep rabbit hole.

124
00:07:56.728 --> 00:08:03.276
So you can have rems which are root ems,
which are ems measured at the root level,

125
00:08:03.276 --> 00:08:09.069
which is like the top level of the page,
or based on the bodies width.

126
00:08:11.668 --> 00:08:12.870
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're
gonna leave it at that.

127
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:17.191
It's basically, ems that are not
affected by magnification, or

128
00:08:17.191 --> 00:08:19.901
like pinch to zoom, or things like that.

129
00:08:23.529 --> 00:08:24.209
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep.

130
00:08:26.169 --> 00:08:30.896
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So next thing I
would talk about is font weight, so

131
00:08:30.896 --> 00:08:34.396
you can make things bold or not bold.

132
00:08:34.396 --> 00:08:38.747
And that's how you do
that with font weight.

133
00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:42.082
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
each fonts are bold by default.

134
00:08:42.082 --> 00:08:46.433
If you wanna make them not bold you
have to say font-weight normal.

135
00:08:46.433 --> 00:08:49.411
And you can also do light as well.

136
00:08:49.411 --> 00:08:52.333
So if you want it to be extra thin.

137
00:08:52.333 --> 00:08:56.031
Text-decoration, you'll notice
that this is underlined, right?

138
00:08:56.031 --> 00:08:59.254
You can see the green
underlining right there.

139
00:08:59.254 --> 00:09:00.422
That's how you do that.

140
00:09:00.422 --> 00:09:05.209
You can also do over line, which I
don't know why you would ever do that,

141
00:09:05.209 --> 00:09:07.106
but you can, it's a thing.

142
00:09:07.106 --> 00:09:10.889
And there's also line through
if you wanna do strike through.

143
00:09:10.889 --> 00:09:15.643
Text transform, so
you'll notice here that this is all in

144
00:09:15.643 --> 00:09:21.086
uppercase despite the fact that
this is an h1 with normal casing.

145
00:09:21.086 --> 00:09:24.482
That's something you can do with CSS
is say make this all upper case.

146
00:09:24.482 --> 00:09:26.834
Which is kind of interesting.

147
00:09:26.834 --> 00:09:32.994
Word of caution,
I used to do localization for Netflix.

148
00:09:32.994 --> 00:09:35.409
Which is like translating from
language to language, right?

149
00:09:35.409 --> 00:09:37.420
And I did all the coding for that.

150
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.969
And if you do text-transform: uppercase,

151
00:09:39.969 --> 00:09:42.794
it changes the meanings
in different languages.

152
00:09:42.794 --> 00:09:46.390
For example, I know with Turkish it kind
of messes with the meaning depending if

153
00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:47.848
it's uppercase or lowercase.

154
00:09:47.848 --> 00:09:50.085
So be careful if you're developing for

155
00:09:50.085 --> 00:09:54.237
different languages that you don't
do text-transform: uppercase.

156
00:09:54.237 --> 00:09:59.261
We had to remove that a lot
throughout the Netflix code base.

157
00:09:59.261 --> 00:10:01.771
You can also do lowercase or capitalize,

158
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:07.066
which will capitalize the beginning
of every word, that works, too.

159
00:10:07.066 --> 00:10:09.600
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Border: 3 pixel solid pink.

160
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:16.178
So it's kind of hard to see there, but
there is a pink border there, I promise.

161
00:10:16.178 --> 00:10:20.447
That is three pixels wide and it's solid.

162
00:10:20.447 --> 00:10:25.230
So this is called a combined CSS property.

163
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.457
Cuz you can see there we have three
different values for one property, right?

164
00:10:28.457 --> 00:10:32.382
It's solid, it's pink, and
it's three pixels wide.

165
00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:37.165
This is actually the combination of
border-style: solid:, border-color: pink:,

166
00:10:37.165 --> 00:10:38.725
and border-with: 3px:.

167
00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:43.160
This is called like a short-hand CSS
property that you can kind of just shove

168
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.279
them altogether.

169
00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:48.457
You'll see that a lot, that's why I
wanted to show you that kind of front.

170
00:10:48.457 --> 00:10:51.073
But you can totally change
this to be five pixels wide.

171
00:10:51.073 --> 00:10:57.821
You can change this to be double border,
or dashed, or dotted borders.

172
00:10:57.821 --> 00:11:02.367
And obviously,
this can be any number of colors.

173
00:11:02.367 --> 00:11:06.032
So you'll see the lot, so
just kinda get use to it.

174
00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:08.936
We'll talk a lot more about the selector,

175
00:11:08.936 --> 00:11:14.109
there's actually a whole section on
it because it's a complicated beast.

176
00:11:14.109 --> 00:11:17.225
[LAUGH] But yeah, cool.
