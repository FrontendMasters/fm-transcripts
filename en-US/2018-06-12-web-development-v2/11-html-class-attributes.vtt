00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.652
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
classes are a special type of attribute,

2
00:00:03.652 --> 00:00:06.990
anything can have a class on it.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.944
There are some things, there are many
things you'll not use classes for, but

4
00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:13.530
any tag can have a class.

5
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.460
So, what classes are for, they in and
of themselves don't do anything.

6
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.100
So if you give something a class,

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.690
it's not necessarily going
to do anything by itself.

8
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.030
But it's basically like you sticking,
like, a post-it note on that and

9
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.210
saying, like,
this is this kinda theme, right?

10
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.890
So, I can have ten different
kind of divs on my page and

11
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.410
you're making like,
this is a blog post div.

12
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.560
And this one is a navigation div.

13
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.370
And it's like, you're labelling each
one of them at different kind of div.

14
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.350
Right, because there is
not that many tags so

15
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.270
you could use a different kind of tag for
each one.

16
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.860
So you need to kind of be able to invent
your own sort of labeling system.

17
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.410
That's really what this is,
is you're just labeling things here.

18
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.520
In summary, the way that CSS works is
that you make rules for things, right?

19
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.750
So you're saying if this is a div,
it's colored green.

20
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.720
However, if you have a a large website,

21
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.554
like something like Gmail,
you have literally thousands of divs.

22
00:01:14.554 --> 00:01:17.110
So you can't just say all
divs are colored green,

23
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.040
because you don't want everything
colored green on Gmail.

24
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.920
That doesn't make any sense.

25
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.200
So, what you do is you basically say,
this is a blog post div, and

26
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.760
I want all blog post divs colored green.

27
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.170
So you're saying like,
affect only these kinds of divs.

28
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.420
So, if you go back to our house analogy,

29
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.160
you don't wanna say every two by four
that I have goes on the south wall,

30
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.970
because then you don't have any two by
fours for the other three walls, right?

31
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.570
So what you'll do is you'll
mark some of the two by fours.

32
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.200
Like, these are south wall two by fours,
and only those ones go on the south wall,

33
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.330
and then these ones can go
in other places, right?

34
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.630
So that's what classes are for.

35
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.111
They allow you to label things so
that different things can affect them,

36
00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:00.835
both from CSS and from JavaScript.

37
00:02:04.121 --> 00:02:06.890
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What you name
them ends up being important.

38
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.285
Not because, it was actually div there,
it's not important for

39
00:02:13.285 --> 00:02:17.950
screen readers, that's one thing
that I wanted to point out.

40
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.570
Is that the classes are not used
by anything else other than you.

41
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.430
So, if you give them a bad name,

42
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.650
the only person that you're kind
of like screwing over is yourself.

43
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.006
[LAUGH] And
your future coworkers and such.

44
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:31.305
So, make sure you name them good things,

45
00:02:31.305 --> 00:02:35.784
and I'll give you some suggestions here
in just a second about what to name them.

46
00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:39.424
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you can see here,

47
00:02:39.424 --> 00:02:44.310
I kinda gave you an example of what this
might look like, giving things good names.

48
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.300
So that's what this class
equals business looks like.

49
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.660
So this is a header div.

50
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.207
This is a header-title.

51
00:02:51.207 --> 00:02:52.930
These are blog posts.

52
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.870
This is a post.

53
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.010
This is a post, right.

54
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.710
Notice that I have multiple posts, right.

55
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.810
It makes sense if you're
going through a blog,

56
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.200
they have multiple posts on there, right.

57
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.010
So, you would call each
one of them a post, so

58
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.570
that you can style them the same way.

59
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.690
You can make JavaScript
affect them in the same way.

60
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.840
And you can see that's what
this looks like right here.

61
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.770
So my blog will look like this.

62
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.750
And I used CSS to make
these look like this.

63
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.170
So that's why they look,

64
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.870
we'll talk about how to do that in
the next section or two sections.

65
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.481
So, yeah,
the reason why I called this a post and

66
00:03:32.481 --> 00:03:37.214
this a post is because I wanted them
both to have these grey outlines.

67
00:03:37.214 --> 00:03:39.314
And if I didn't call them the same thing,

68
00:03:39.314 --> 00:03:43.642
if I called this something else,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Notice it lost its

69
00:03:43.642 --> 00:03:44.490
border, right?

70
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.569
But as soon as they're both called post,
then they both have

71
00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.724
that gray border,
because I made CSS rules that affect post.

72
00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:05.165
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any
questions about classes?

73
00:04:05.165 --> 00:04:06.280
Does that make sense?

74
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.251
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

75
00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.950
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, yeah, I have
multiple posts on the same page, and

76
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:25.350
that's why classes are really useful,
is because they are very reusable.

77
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.320
So, if I make a post here, even if
I go to another part of my website,

78
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.560
I can still use that post
class that I created.
