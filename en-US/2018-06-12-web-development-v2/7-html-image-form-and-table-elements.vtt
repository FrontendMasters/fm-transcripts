1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.367
An img, this is a self closing tag,
it's our void tag.

2
00:00:06.367 --> 00:00:07.747
And it's an image, right?

3
00:00:07.747 --> 00:00:09.621
It makes sense, you don't have
anything inside of an image.

4
00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:13.242
An image is in and of itself enough,

5
00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:18.567
it's a one atomic unit that
cannot be broken apart.

6
00:00:18.567 --> 00:00:22.857
So yeah,
we'll get to that in just a second.

7
00:00:22.857 --> 00:00:28.250
So you give an image a source, right, src.

8
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.121
And it'll look something like this,
img src =, this will be some sort of

9
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:38.092
URL pointing to a picture that's being
hosted somewhere on the Internet.

10
00:00:38.092 --> 00:00:44.834
And so every image needs a source and
it also needs an alt, A-L-T.

11
00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:48.973
Going back to screen readers, obviously,
if you're blind you can't see images.

12
00:00:48.973 --> 00:00:52.285
However, it can be really important
what's in those images for

13
00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:54.690
someone to understand your website, right?

14
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.765
If you're having,
this is an arrow pointing at something or

15
00:00:57.765 --> 00:00:59.227
it has a other meaning to it.

16
00:00:59.227 --> 00:01:03.962
So you give it an alt, so
that when the screen reader arrives to

17
00:01:03.962 --> 00:01:08.985
this particular image,
it has some text to say about it, right?

18
00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:15.171
So let's actually just copy and
paste this up here.

19
00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:19.171
Come back up here.

20
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:24.640
So you have this little
puppy picture that pops up,

21
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.101
but let's say this image broke, right?

22
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:31.524
It actually will show them the alt text,
for whatever reason,

23
00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.733
if that image got moved or
broken or something like that.

24
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:37.382
So it also doubles as being a backup for
it as well.

25
00:01:37.382 --> 00:01:40.698
But also if someone's using a screen
reader and they tap onto this and

26
00:01:40.698 --> 00:01:43.112
it goes,
they obviously can't see the picture.

27
00:01:43.112 --> 00:01:48.185
It'll say, this is a picture
of an adorable puppy, right?

28
00:01:48.185 --> 00:01:53.138
So it's important to have
descriptive alts as well.

29
00:01:53.138 --> 00:01:57.104
Every image tag should have an alt,
100% of the time, always.

30
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.672
And again,
that's being a responsible citizen,

31
00:02:03.672 --> 00:02:06.416
that's recognizing that
the Internet is for everyone.

32
00:02:10.887 --> 00:02:15.155
So what is a subtle difference
that often people have

33
00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:19.912
a hard time with when they're
learning web development?

34
00:02:19.912 --> 00:02:23.799
Is you can actually put
images on a page with CSS.

35
00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:31.308
So you don't have to use an img tag,
you can put it on there via CSS.

36
00:02:31.308 --> 00:02:36.732
The only time that you wanna do this
if it's purely decorative, right?

37
00:02:36.732 --> 00:02:41.135
Like if you have a background image on
your page, right, that purely serves just

38
00:02:41.135 --> 00:02:44.697
to make your page look nice and
it's purely for aesthetic value,

39
00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:48.428
then that's when you're going to
use CSS to put the image on there.

40
00:02:48.428 --> 00:02:51.466
But if it's for
something like real content, right?

41
00:02:51.466 --> 00:02:54.484
Maybe we have an adoption website for
puppies, and

42
00:02:54.484 --> 00:02:57.512
we're putting that picture
of the puppy up there.

43
00:02:57.512 --> 00:03:00.460
That should be an img tag,
because it needs an alt tag, right?

44
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.907
So the CSS version can't do alt text.

45
00:03:03.907 --> 00:03:07.752
So that's why it's really important
that you need to use those img tags for

46
00:03:07.752 --> 00:03:09.716
everything that's not decorative.

47
00:03:09.716 --> 00:03:12.748
If it's purely decorative,
then you can use CSS for it.

48
00:03:12.748 --> 00:03:15.175
Does that make sense?

49
00:03:15.175 --> 00:03:15.715
Okay.

50
00:03:22.192 --> 00:03:24.568
The other thing that's useful is for
search engines,

51
00:03:24.568 --> 00:03:26.641
search engines will also
read alt tags as well.

52
00:03:30.686 --> 00:03:36.016
Inputs, we were just talking about inputs,
so this is an input right here.

53
00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:41.196
It's something that people can type into
for like, if you're filling out a form,

54
00:03:41.196 --> 00:03:45.863
you wanna put first name and last name,
you would use an input tag for this.

55
00:03:45.863 --> 00:03:48.069
There are many different
flavors of input tags.

56
00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.278
If you don't put anything, it just
assumes that you need a text input,

57
00:03:51.278 --> 00:03:53.216
which is the most common one, I would say.

58
00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:58.522
But there's also a color picker,
there's a number input,

59
00:03:58.522 --> 00:04:04.152
there's a date input,
there's a time input, file uploader.

60
00:04:04.152 --> 00:04:08.096
There's a bunch of them,
more that I'm not thinking of as well.

61
00:04:08.096 --> 00:04:12.384
So, I haven't read the numbers,
dates, colors, check boxes,

62
00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:15.040
radio buttons, a bunch of stuff like that.

63
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.237
We'll see more of that in the next
page as well, it looks like this.

64
00:04:22.237 --> 00:04:28.093
Text area, so what happens if you
had to write an essay, right?

65
00:04:28.093 --> 00:04:32.068
You don't wanna write an essay in this,
that would be terribly annoying, right?

66
00:04:32.068 --> 00:04:36.254
So it'd be useful if you
could do something like this.

67
00:04:38.994 --> 00:04:46.678
Textarea/textarea, right?

68
00:04:46.678 --> 00:04:49.461
So I'm sure you've seen all
these on websites, right.

69
00:04:49.461 --> 00:04:52.898
They're like this big and you can
write a bunch of stuff in them, and

70
00:04:52.898 --> 00:04:55.563
then you can hit Enter and
such, that is a text area.

71
00:04:55.563 --> 00:04:59.890
So it's a larger input that accommodates
larger bodies of text in them.

72
00:05:02.996 --> 00:05:05.473
Now something you might point out
to me at this point in time and

73
00:05:05.473 --> 00:05:08.584
you'd be absolutely right, is,
why is that not a self closing tag, right?

74
00:05:08.584 --> 00:05:14.388
Inputs are self closing tags,
so why aren't text areas?

75
00:05:14.388 --> 00:05:19.812
There's not a good reason, they just
aren't, they're old is the real reason.

76
00:05:19.812 --> 00:05:24.741
Text areas have been
around long enough that

77
00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:29.277
they were not made self-closing tags.

78
00:05:29.277 --> 00:05:33.863
Yeah, I mean,
if you put something in here,

79
00:05:33.863 --> 00:05:39.918
it'll like seed that as like
the beginning value, right?

80
00:05:39.918 --> 00:05:42.498
So you can put things in there,

81
00:05:42.498 --> 00:05:48.263
that would be like the initial value
of whatever's in the text area.

82
00:05:48.263 --> 00:05:51.576
You don't end up using text areas very
often, but it's good to know about them,

83
00:05:51.576 --> 00:05:52.216
they do exist.

84
00:05:52.216 --> 00:05:54.929
If you need long form text from a user.

85
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.734
Inputs, text areas, select,
select an option specifically.

86
00:06:04.734 --> 00:06:06.317
So like a drop down, right?

87
00:06:06.317 --> 00:06:10.095
I'm sure most of you have done select
the state that you're from, and

88
00:06:10.095 --> 00:06:12.349
you click on it, and you find Minnesota.

89
00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:16.173
And then you click on that, right,
that drop down is a select, right?

90
00:06:16.173 --> 00:06:20.691
And all the individual options in it are,
you guessed it, options.

91
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:26.939
So it will look like something like this,
select, option,

92
00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:32.954
then you have Seattle,
Portland, San Francisco, etc.

93
00:06:32.954 --> 00:06:36.507
And we'll get more into that later,
but they have various values as well.

94
00:06:36.507 --> 00:06:39.874
And that'll be the value that's actually
sent back to your server if they

95
00:06:39.874 --> 00:06:40.537
select that.

96
00:06:40.537 --> 00:06:43.394
So if I select Seattle, it's gonna
send back this version of Seattle.

97
00:06:53.769 --> 00:06:57.143
So the next one is a form.

98
00:06:57.143 --> 00:07:01.651
A form is for if you have like a large
form that someone's filling out that has

99
00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:07.092
first name, last name, state address, etc,
etc, that has a bunch of different inputs.

100
00:07:07.092 --> 00:07:09.106
You wanna gather that
up all into one place,

101
00:07:09.106 --> 00:07:11.731
you use a form as kinda like
the container for all of that.

102
00:07:13.635 --> 00:07:17.824
There's more to forms, we're not
necessarily gonna get into that today,

103
00:07:17.824 --> 00:07:21.369
because there's a lot of stuff
that you can get into with forms.

104
00:07:21.369 --> 00:07:23.873
And it's not particularly interesting,
in my opinion.

105
00:07:23.873 --> 00:07:28.027
[LAUGH] But yeah, forms are for
grouping together inputs,

106
00:07:28.027 --> 00:07:31.345
text areas, selects, those kind of things.

107
00:07:34.853 --> 00:07:39.195
Tables, so
tables get a really bad rap in HTML

108
00:07:39.195 --> 00:07:43.994
because back before we had
useful amounts of CSS,

109
00:07:43.994 --> 00:07:48.011
we used to layout websites using tables.

110
00:07:48.011 --> 00:07:52.382
Imagine trying to like paint
a picture using Excel, and

111
00:07:52.382 --> 00:07:56.755
that's what writing websites
using tables felt like.

112
00:07:56.755 --> 00:07:58.542
We're way beyond that now,

113
00:07:58.542 --> 00:08:02.720
we haven't used tables to lay out
things in a decade, I would say.

114
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.712
But people still have this aversion
to using tables because they're so

115
00:08:07.712 --> 00:08:09.635
traumatized by back then.

116
00:08:09.635 --> 00:08:14.395
You should still use tables if
you have a table of data, right?

117
00:08:14.395 --> 00:08:18.373
If you have something that you would
use Excel to display, then use a table,

118
00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:19.628
that's totally fine.

119
00:08:19.628 --> 00:08:21.939
If you're trying to lay out a website,
do not use tables.

120
00:08:21.939 --> 00:08:28.271
[LAUGH] So a table is like
the container for the entire table.

121
00:08:28.271 --> 00:08:32.648
A tr is one row and a td is one cell.

122
00:08:35.227 --> 00:08:36.858
So right here, I have a table.

123
00:08:36.858 --> 00:08:39.140
In fact, we can just copy and
paste that and see what it looks like.

124
00:08:42.568 --> 00:08:44.289
Let's go back up here.

125
00:08:48.826 --> 00:08:53.996
Right, so I have (0,0),
(1,0), (0,1), and (1,1).

126
00:08:53.996 --> 00:08:57.537
And let's just put these on different rows
so you can kinda see what that looks like.

127
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:16.067
Okay, so
the table contains the whole table, right?

128
00:09:16.067 --> 00:09:19.187
One tr is one row, right?

129
00:09:19.187 --> 00:09:22.180
Table row follows.

130
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.394
And then you have one td is one
individual cell here, right?

131
00:09:25.394 --> 00:09:30.479
So I have (0,0), which is there,
and then (1,0) is here.

132
00:09:30.479 --> 00:09:33.829
Then you have another tr,
so it's the next row down,

133
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:37.040
(0,1) (1,1) right there, make sense?

134
00:09:39.311 --> 00:09:43.947
So something that you'll kind of find
just with HTML and CSS in general is we

135
00:09:43.947 --> 00:09:48.452
start at the top left and we work our
way right and then we go down, right?

136
00:09:48.452 --> 00:09:51.733
So the first one we put on
here is the top left one,

137
00:09:51.733 --> 00:09:54.871
that's also how a bunch
of stuff works in CSS.

138
00:09:54.871 --> 00:09:58.904
So just get used to usually that the point
(0,0) is gonna be the top left of whatever

139
00:09:58.904 --> 00:10:00.023
you're working with.

140
00:10:03.548 --> 00:10:08.050
So if I were to put, Let's say

141
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:13.061
another table row in here,
it would go underneath it, right?

142
00:10:13.061 --> 00:10:14.729
Sure enough, it does.

143
00:10:23.797 --> 00:10:30.163
Rather it's this one is 2, 0 and

144
00:10:30.163 --> 00:10:34.940
1 and 2, anyway.

145
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.917
And then if I put another td right here,

146
00:10:43.739 --> 00:10:48.076
Right there, yeah, make sense?

147
00:10:48.076 --> 00:10:48.641
Cool.

148
00:10:53.926 --> 00:10:59.138
So that's tables, and yeah,
so there are many more tags.

149
00:10:59.138 --> 00:11:04.000
And I didn't even necessarily
cover all of the useful ones.

150
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.578
There are things like nav and header,
and footer, things like that.

151
00:11:10.578 --> 00:11:13.319
And article, and section, and
a bunch of stuff like that.

152
00:11:13.319 --> 00:11:17.681
So for example, you have something that's
like article, it's something that you

153
00:11:17.681 --> 00:11:21.437
put an article inside of,
it's very descriptive what's inside of it.

154
00:11:21.437 --> 00:11:25.829
It acts just a div,
like the way it mechanically works,

155
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:28.923
it works exactly like a div would work.

156
00:11:28.923 --> 00:11:32.888
But what's nice about it is if someone's
scraping your website like Google,

157
00:11:32.888 --> 00:11:35.603
they'll instantly knows,
this is an article.

158
00:11:35.603 --> 00:11:39.212
This is something I can throw into
where I would display an article.

159
00:11:39.212 --> 00:11:42.041
So it's useful for
machines that are reading it.

160
00:11:42.041 --> 00:11:47.425
So if you use useful HTML, machines
that are consuming it will know a little

161
00:11:47.425 --> 00:11:52.809
bit more about your website, and will
be able to rank you higher in Google or

162
00:11:52.809 --> 00:11:57.346
be able to scrape your website
in interesting and useful ways.

163
00:11:57.346 --> 00:12:01.153
And also screen readers will be
able to read it more readily.

164
00:12:01.153 --> 00:12:05.524
So there's a bunch more,
this will get you started, but

165
00:12:05.524 --> 00:12:10.731
you'll be learning HTML tags,
probably for at least a little bit.

166
00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:14.160
Any questions about anything
that we've talked about so far?

167
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.880
Please?

168
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.725
&gt;&gt; So when I did the button in two
different browsers, it looks different.

169
00:12:20.725 --> 00:12:23.462
A, is that something that you
ever have to be aware of?

170
00:12:23.462 --> 00:12:28.049
And B, is my hypothesis
correct that it's sort of like

171
00:12:28.049 --> 00:12:32.452
emoji between like Android and
Apple kind of thing?

172
00:12:32.452 --> 00:12:35.856
&gt;&gt; Yep, the answer is yes
to both of your questions.

173
00:12:35.856 --> 00:12:41.079
[LAUGH] So it's something you should
be aware of, usually that's okay.

174
00:12:41.079 --> 00:12:47.065
But when you use CSS, you can make them
look the same across operating systems and

175
00:12:47.065 --> 00:12:49.983
browsers, and all that kind of thing.

176
00:12:49.983 --> 00:12:54.166
But yes, it will look different by
default if you don't change anything.

177
00:12:54.166 --> 00:12:55.739
You will almost always change something.

178
00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.725
What's the other question?

179
00:13:00.725 --> 00:13:05.019
&gt;&gt; And then, is it just the difference in
the browser the same as an emoji looks

180
00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:08.172
different between Android and
an iPhone for example?

181
00:13:08.172 --> 00:13:11.089
&gt;&gt; Yes, it's the browser
that's making those different.

182
00:13:11.089 --> 00:13:15.960
It's the browsers more or
less trying to have convergent

183
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:20.433
looking things, but
a lot of it is up left up to them.

184
00:13:20.433 --> 00:13:24.888
Google and Chrome tends to make
things look more like Google, right?

185
00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:29.369
So it's more like material design, it's
more flat, those kind of things, whereas

186
00:13:29.369 --> 00:13:33.184
Firefox is has its own way of thinking,
Edge has its own way of thinking.

187
00:13:33.184 --> 00:13:37.729
So it's those kind of details
are left up to the browser vendors.

188
00:13:37.729 --> 00:13:40.898
It's a good question.

189
00:13:40.898 --> 00:13:45.395
In fact, that's actually one of the fun
slash horrifying parts of being a front

190
00:13:45.395 --> 00:13:48.963
end developer is making things
look the same across browsers.

191
00:13:48.963 --> 00:13:53.239
That's something that you constantly,
constantly battle with is,

192
00:13:53.239 --> 00:13:56.652
this works in Firefox, but
it doesn't work in Chrome.

193
00:13:56.652 --> 00:13:58.216
How many times have you said that?

194
00:13:58.216 --> 00:14:01.717
I've said that literally yesterday,
if we're being honest.

195
00:14:01.717 --> 00:14:04.801
[LAUGH] I literally had to fix
something for that very reason.

196
00:14:04.801 --> 00:14:12.417
So it's one of the common problems that
we deal with is cross browser problems,

197
00:14:12.417 --> 00:14:17.091
and the worst by far these
days is mobile Safari.

198
00:14:17.091 --> 00:14:19.938
I spend so much time fixing things for
mobile Safari.

199
00:14:19.938 --> 00:14:21.952
It used to be Internet Explorer.

200
00:14:21.952 --> 00:14:28.567
But luckily, not many people use
Internet Explorer anymore, so.

201
00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:29.703
Good questions.
