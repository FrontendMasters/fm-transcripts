00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So who am I?

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.764
I'm that guy,
if you couldn't tell [LAUGH].

3
00:00:05.764 --> 00:00:09.460
This is me having a Belgian
beer with my wife in Paris.

4
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.481
My name is Brian Holt.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I currently,

5
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.500
at this moment in time, work at Microsoft.

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.970
I'm a cloud developer advocate,
which means that my job is

7
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.860
to convince people that putting your
stuff on Microsoft Cloud is okay.

8
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.967
[LAUGH] Actually, the last lesson will be
us putting stuff into Microsoft Cloud, so

9
00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:34.669
you can actually see how that works.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I

10
00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:39.511
do a lot of traveling,
which is good and bad.

11
00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:44.895
I just moved to Seattle maybe eight weeks
ago, and I've only been home for six days.

12
00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:48.395
[LAUGH] Which is awesome,
cuz I get to be in places like this, but

13
00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:50.190
I also don't know where I live.

14
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.706
[LAUGH] But it's awesome.

15
00:00:53.706 --> 00:00:55.086
So yeah, I currently live in Seattle.

16
00:00:55.086 --> 00:00:56.580
I just moved there from San Francisco.

17
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.670
I'm on a podcast called
Frontend Happy Hour, which is pretty fun.

18
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.920
It's literally just us drinking and
talking about Javascript,

19
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.093
which is my two favorite things.

20
00:01:09.093 --> 00:01:12.240
Previously, I worked at LinkedIn,
Netflix, Reddit, and

21
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.710
a couple of other smaller companies
when I lived in Salt Lake City.

22
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.820
My biggest passions are people and
experiences.

23
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.944
So, that's why I love to travel.

24
00:01:23.944 --> 00:01:25.860
Anytime that I can be,
I try to be traveling.

25
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.610
What else?

26
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.363
I have a little dog named Luna,
she's adorable.

27
00:01:31.363 --> 00:01:37.680
[LAUGH] And please catch up
with me on social networks.

28
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.030
I posted all the ones that I use there.

29
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.560
Again, I just wanna give another
shout out to Frontend Masters.

30
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.413
I love to teach,
it's one of my greatest passions.

31
00:01:48.413 --> 00:01:52.912
It's not something I can fully totally
make a living at, this point in time, so

32
00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:56.823
that's why I still have my other job,
which I really do like as well.

33
00:01:56.823 --> 00:02:00.903
I like teaching because it forces you to
distill your knowledge down to something

34
00:02:00.903 --> 00:02:03.729
like crystal that you can
actually explain to someone.

35
00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.150
And then it forces you to acknowledge
the gaps in your own knowledge.

36
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.110
For me to truly master something,
I have to teach it to someone else.

37
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.860
These courses take a ton
of time to prepare.

38
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.640
So that's why I'm actually really
grateful to Frontend Masters.

39
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.425
They give me deadlines and
incentive to finish these workshops.

40
00:02:22.425 --> 00:02:25.569
So that's really, really great.

41
00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.862
And they also encourage me
to open source all material.

42
00:02:27.862 --> 00:02:30.346
So that even if people can't
afford to watch the videos,

43
00:02:30.346 --> 00:02:32.426
they can still have the website and
materials.

44
00:02:32.426 --> 00:02:34.840
And that's something that Frontend Masters
has really encouraged me to do.

45
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.007
So super, super grateful to all of them.

46
00:02:39.007 --> 00:02:43.593
And cool, last thing,
I did this last night.

47
00:02:43.593 --> 00:02:47.110
I got a bunch of people to tweet
encouraging things to you while you're

48
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.430
learning these courses.

49
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.382
And so at the bottom of every
page is an encouraging tweet for

50
00:02:52.382 --> 00:02:57.130
you to keep going, which I thought was,
I don't know, really cool.

51
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.270
And there's actually some really cool
people in here that have tweeted.

52
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.283
Other Frontend Masters like Kentsey Dodd
is in there and Sarah Drasner and

53
00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:05.325
Richard Feldman.

54
00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:09.720
And they're all in there encouraging
you to keep going and learning stuff.

55
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.900
So if you need a little boost,
just check that out.

56
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.395
Okay, does anyone have any
questions before we get

57
00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:21.240
started?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

58
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you speak just briefly

59
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.920
on, I'm always confused about
how you can fark something and

60
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.540
mess with it and
then call it your own code?

61
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.860
Where is that line between where
you just stole something and where

62
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.890
you can use it for your own personal gain?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a really good

63
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.143
question, and that's actually a good
question to answer I think right now.

64
00:03:43.143 --> 00:03:47.366
Because there's a ton of code in here
that I wrote that I absolutely want you

65
00:03:47.366 --> 00:03:47.976
to steal.

66
00:03:47.976 --> 00:03:50.796
[LAUGH] Please take
everything that I've written,

67
00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:52.901
this is all creative common license.

68
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:58.352
So we are all standing on
the shoulders of giants.

69
00:03:58.352 --> 00:03:59.536
I didn't create JavaScript.

70
00:03:59.536 --> 00:04:01.560
I didn't create the assembly
that's underneath it.

71
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.420
I didn't create the processes
that are underneath it.

72
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.060
So we are all in some way borrow or
stealing from someone else.

73
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.100
Some of us, and I would say most of
us that I know in the community,

74
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.100
are actually really enthused that
anyone would want to use our code.

75
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.866
I find it quite flattering that someone
actually cares that I wrote something.

76
00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:26.980
[LAUGH] So, I think the answer is like,
where is the ethical line?

77
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.421
I think as long as you're acknowledging
that I'm using this code.

78
00:04:32.421 --> 00:04:34.137
This person wrote this code and

79
00:04:34.137 --> 00:04:37.180
you're not presenting it as
if like I wrote this code.

80
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.320
Then I think you're okay, almost always.

81
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.686
But you should always follow the license.

82
00:04:43.686 --> 00:04:47.330
All the code that you're gonna see
is licensed in some way or another.

83
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.880
And if it's MIT licensed, which is
the most common one, it means that

84
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.440
you can literally take their code and
then say this is mine and I wrote it.

85
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.510
And that's actually okay.

86
00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.172
I mean, don't do that.

87
00:04:59.172 --> 00:05:01.000
But you could, right?

88
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.810
So I mean, it's what's ethical and
what's legal.

89
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.860
If it feels weird, then maybe don't.

90
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.730
But just follow your heart.

91
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:08.242
Nah, I'm just kidding.

92
00:05:08.242 --> 00:05:09.900
[LAUGH] Yeah, no,

93
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.918
most people want you to use their code.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay,

94
00:05:13.918 --> 00:05:18.151
I'm just wondering, yeah, cuz I come from
a background in school where if you copy

95
00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.510
the letter A from
somebody else's homework,

96
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.964
you're gonna fail.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

97
00:05:25.216 --> 00:05:26.567
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's definitely not

98
00:05:26.567 --> 00:05:27.740
like this.

99
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.254
The open source world, the programming
world is very much about sharing.

100
00:05:32.308 --> 00:05:32.996
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

101
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.354
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good question.
