1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.860
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I have embedded down.

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.190
This isn't from CodePen.

3
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.670
The CodePen is on another page.

4
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.790
So ignore this little part about CodePen.

5
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.400
Down here I left you
a really big playground.

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.237
I have just like a bunch of different HTML

7
00:00:14.237 --> 00:00:17.719
elements.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

8
00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:20.410
I want you to just toy around
with this a little bit.

9
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.910
So this just is a bunch of HTML, right?

10
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.950
So you can see here I have h1's
through h6's, a bunch of links.

11
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.130
We didn't talk about strong and.

12
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.240
So you can think of strong,
it's basically bold.

13
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.730
Here it's like, you're making a very
strong assertion, so it's gonna be bolded.

14
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.570
Usually it's bolded.

15
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.580
Maybe in a different context, it won't
be bold, it'll be a different color or

16
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.450
something like that.

17
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.300
But it's a strong emphasis,

18
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.360
or let's not say that,
it's a strong display of some sort, right?

19
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.090
So this text is strong, right?

20
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.540
Whereas you have here m, e, m stands for
emphasis that's usually italic.

21
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.360
Right, and you're like you're trying
to stick emphasis on something.

22
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.910
So, that's what those two are.

23
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.980
This is a bunch of paragraphs right here.

24
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.240
Have most of you seen
Lorem Ipsum text before?

25
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.490
That's what Lorem Ipsum is, right there.

26
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.580
If you've ever worked with a designer or
something like that,

27
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.970
usually they'll put
placeholder text in there.

28
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.020
And usually it starts with Lorem Ipsum,
that's why it's called Lorem Ipsum text.

29
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.214
It's meant to look like English, or
look like a readable language, but

30
00:01:34.214 --> 00:01:36.361
it's also meant to be nonsensical.

31
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:39.893
The reason why they put it in there is so,
it looks like there's real text in there,

32
00:01:39.893 --> 00:01:42.360
but it doesn't distract
from what you're doing.

33
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.570
So in this particular case, we're trying
to figure out what paragraphs look like.

34
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.900
But we don't wanna spend
time reading text.

35
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.480
There's studies that show if
there's readable text on something.

36
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.437
Someone will read it,
I think that follows [LAUGH].

37
00:01:55.437 --> 00:01:59.670
So, that's why Lorem Ipsum text is there,
it's placeholder text.

38
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.950
I intentionally put this in here because
if you work with web development at all,

39
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.994
you will definitely see Lorem Ipsum text,

40
00:02:06.994 --> 00:02:12.143
it's just everywhere.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's

41
00:02:12.143 --> 00:02:13.442
some images in here.

42
00:02:13.442 --> 00:02:15.590
Notice everything is
grouped together by divs.

43
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.400
That's something that
you can expect to see.

44
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.860
You can see here that there are comments
letting you know what each of these are.

45
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.527
Here's a bunch of different kinds of

46
00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:32.195
inputs.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I put it in here

47
00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:35.479
with the trailing slash and without just
so you can see that it does both work.

48
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.420
Text area.

49
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.150
Here's a select.

50
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.090
Here's a button, a table, and a marquee.

51
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.230
So we'll get down there.

52
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.393
So here's all the text.

53
00:02:52.393 --> 00:02:54.400
And please play with these, right.

54
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.330
The reason why I put these
playgrounds on here is so

55
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.580
that you can mess around with them and
see what changes when you change things.

56
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.038
So here's all the links.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you can't really see it

57
00:03:06.038 --> 00:03:10.506
on here, but if you hover over a link,
you can see in the bottom left of Firefox,

58
00:03:10.506 --> 00:03:16.871
it'll show you where the link goes.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here's

59
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:19.710
the various h1's through h6.

60
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.200
Here's strong text.

61
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.390
Here's emphasized text.

62
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.350
Now notice here strong and

63
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.740
are on different lines in my HTML.

64
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.790
But if you go down here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: They're on the same line.

65
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.750
This is because, like I was saying before,
white space is ignored.

66
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.590
So all the spaces, and tabs,
and enters are ignored here.

67
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.820
So these are put together
on the same line.

68
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.643
You can change that with CSS, but

69
00:03:54.643 --> 00:03:58.080
by default it does that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here's

70
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.840
all the paragraphs for
the Lorem Ipsum text.

71
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.620
Here's the three images.

72
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.810
Here's all of the different.

73
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.050
You can select a file.

74
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.970
Here's an input that
you can put stuff into.

75
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:19.381
Here's a color picker.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: A text area,

76
00:04:19.381 --> 00:04:21.950
there's a check box right there.

77
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.555
There's a radio button.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I bet you didn't know,

78
00:04:28.555 --> 00:04:32.771
well, I didn't know those were called
radio buttons until I started writing web

79
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:33.600
development.

80
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.590
Those are called radio buttons, you know
where you can only select one of them and

81
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.030
you can't select all of them.

82
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.070
That's called a radio button.

83
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.370
There's a select drop down, right.

84
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.120
There's a button.

85
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.380
And here's a marquee.

86
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.700
So do you remember those super old
websites that were like, on like,

87
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.590
Geocities that were super annoying and
had like, played music.

88
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.320
That's what marquee,
marquee is from a bygone era.

89
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.850
This doesn't work in some browsers now,
right?

90
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.090
There used to be blink as well,
that would blink the text.

91
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.478
Blink does not work anymore.

92
00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:16.195
[LAUGH] It's probably for the best.

93
00:05:16.195 --> 00:05:20.273
[LAUGH] But for whatever reason,
Marquis still works.

94
00:05:20.273 --> 00:05:23.910
So I was talking to someone that
works on Firefox about this.

95
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.424
They purposefully made it janky.

96
00:05:25.424 --> 00:05:28.749
[LAUGH] If you actually
look at this on Chrome,

97
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.080
let's look because I'm so
wildly entertained by this.

98
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.220
So if you go down here on Chrome,
it's moves right.

99
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.800
So there they made it janky on purpose,

100
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.594
I thought that was amazing.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

101
00:05:55.594 --> 00:06:00.660
any questions about tags so far?

102
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.420
Please.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So for the dropdown button,

103
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.740
I've always wondered, is there the option

104
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.580
to do something where you
can autofill the drop down?

105
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.700
Where you can start typing and
then it'll autofill with the drop down.

106
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.280
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay so

107
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.310
you can like basically like search for
something and

108
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.040
it'll like populate it?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, like if you start

109
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.910
instead of doing the button and then
going all the way down to Minneapolis.

110
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.520
If you start typing Minneapolis-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It kind of

111
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.000
just already works like that.

112
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.330
So if I select here.

113
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:42.160
So I just haven't selected and I start
typing, it will actually just do that.

114
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.072
But if you want a more intuitive,
better interface,

115
00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:47.860
there are libraries that will do it for
you.

116
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.100
The one that comes to mind is Harvest,
which I used to use all the time.

117
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.240
We'll just look.

118
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.039
jQuery, it's a jQuery plugin.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's at the bottom,

119
00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:00.010
chosen.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Chosen,

120
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.520
it's Chosen from Harvest.

121
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.020
Thank you.

122
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.909
So it'll be like this, right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,

123
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:10.303
okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is more like what

124
00:07:10.303 --> 00:07:11.390
you were looking for?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

125
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.970
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so,

126
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.210
one of the beauties of what
we do as developers is,

127
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.210
really smart people like the people over
at Harvest will write things like this and

128
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.540
then it just open sources like hey
if you wanna use this then, use it.

129
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:30.939
So share and share alike.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good question,

130
00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:34.420
and it's something you could
totally write yourself, too.

131
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.150
There's no reason that you have
to use what they're doing.

132
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.720
There's nothing that they're
doing that you couldn't do.

133
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.630
They did it really well, so
that's why I used theirs.
