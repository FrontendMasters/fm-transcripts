1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.140
Now, one of the things when I look
at this app, I think it's beautiful.

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.434
Tailwind makes everything easy.

3
00:00:07.434 --> 00:00:11.539
I noticed that a lot of
these other Electron apps,

4
00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:16.134
they got the fancy menu bars
that they made themselves,

5
00:00:16.134 --> 00:00:19.290
like the VS Code one or the GitHub one.

6
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.223
The GitHub one's got some gradients,
not to be whatever,

7
00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:26.670
it's looking a little dated, but you know.

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.940
I think Slack has got
a custom one nowadays.

9
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.570
I wanna get in on that.

10
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.798
I feel like I got almost
all the way there,

11
00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:35.165
except I've got this menu bar as well.

12
00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:39.085
And also this application feels this
is like the correct size for it.

13
00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:43.161
I don't wanna deal with the fact that
someone can stretch it out like this, or

14
00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:47.427
like this that's not ideally this should
keep track of things that I wanna save to

15
00:00:47.427 --> 00:00:48.385
the clipboards.

16
00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:53.331
I can say important,
quip that I wanna reuse a lot,

17
00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:57.095
and I should be able to like hit copy.

18
00:00:57.095 --> 00:01:02.453
But, this feels like an app that should
be like, roughly like that wide, right?

19
00:01:02.453 --> 00:01:05.534
Like and so
I wanna like have a little bit more

20
00:01:05.534 --> 00:01:10.470
control over this window than I
previously have had in the past.

21
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.457
So you can imagine the initial width and
height are set here as well.

22
00:01:14.457 --> 00:01:19.093
And through the magic of TypeScript, we've
got probably even get a sense of like

23
00:01:19.093 --> 00:01:21.970
some of the other ones
hidden in Mission Control.

24
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.535
Obviously that's a MacOS only one.

25
00:01:23.535 --> 00:01:26.660
Is it minimizable at all?

26
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.975
Right?

27
00:01:27.975 --> 00:01:31.306
So we'll say that the min height I don't
want to deal with it getting to like,

28
00:01:31.306 --> 00:01:34.810
I think that's fine, I can make it pretty
squirrely if I really put my mind to it.

29
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.160
I'm pretty sure I could
do something like that.

30
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.140
I don't want to allow that.

31
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.930
That's gross.

32
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.060
That's yeah, right?

33
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.330
Nobody wants that.

34
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.954
So we'll say that the min height,

35
00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:47.930
I think the min height is only going
to be no less than 400, feels right.

36
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.990
Same thing for the width, I don't need
to live by that, 300 feels right there.

37
00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.054
The max, let's see, max height, 800,

38
00:02:00.054 --> 00:02:05.800
I'm making values up to
be very clear with you.

39
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.690
Max width, you know what, 450.

40
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.340
We'll see if this looks any good at all.

41
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.498
And, they can't maximize it, so
it's not, they can minimize it,

42
00:02:14.498 --> 00:02:18.140
I don't care, it's not maximizable at all.

43
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.007
So we''ll start with that and
see what we got.

44
00:02:27.854 --> 00:02:29.840
All right, so now, I missed it.

45
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.550
There it is.

46
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.120
Can't go any bigger than 450.

47
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.648
Can't get any smaller than 300.

48
00:02:39.277 --> 00:02:45.360
Cool, so I've got some like, reasonable
like settings here, feels like good.

49
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.810
I do want to get like one of those
custom menu bar dailies that feels nice.

50
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.639
So with that, I'm simply going
to say that the Title Bar Style

51
00:02:57.718 --> 00:03:04.448
is hidden and there is a title,
let's see what happens if I just do that.

52
00:03:04.448 --> 00:03:10.349
I think I still need to do one more
tweak to get it to look totally right,

53
00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.660
we'll find out together.

54
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.075
Looks pretty good.

55
00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:17.662
The other one I was gonna do is,

56
00:03:21.662 --> 00:03:27.230
And we'll put that, no, I want, true.

57
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.680
And you can see, and there's
documentation for all this kind of stuff.

58
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.540
You can also read it here as well.

59
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.420
I want them visible, as well.

60
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.980
And there's a bunch of
other settings in here.

61
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.060
And that should get me
most of the way there.

62
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.302
But we're gonna notice something gross.

63
00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:48.227
Which is now I drag this thing, but

64
00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:53.010
like it's behaving like a web page,
which is disgusting.

65
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.966
I didn't go through all of this work
to create something that looked and

66
00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:58.810
felt like a web app not to be
able to drag the title bar.

67
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.804
All right, and
I don't want to select that and like no,

68
00:04:01.804 --> 00:04:05.190
that's not the behavior that
I've come to know and love.

69
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.913
You can see that I can't
maximize it though.

70
00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.365
That's cool.

71
00:04:09.468 --> 00:04:15.036
And to everyone's shock and amazement,
do you know how we fix this?

72
00:04:16.243 --> 00:04:17.746
CSS.

73
00:04:19.117 --> 00:04:22.790
Yeah, we fix it with CSS.

74
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.040
So with a little bit of CSS,
we can adjust this.

75
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.820
I happen to know that I gave
it the ID of titlebar.

76
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.564
So that is not a built in Electron thing,
that is just simply,

77
00:04:34.564 --> 00:04:37.860
I happen to be the person
who wrote the HTML.

78
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:45.860
So, there's basically two things we wanna
do, we wanna do user select, and none.

79
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.090
There are other options for this.

80
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.310
Just FYI, that's not important for
our time together.

81
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.370
Which is like, if you ever wanna say,
if they click on anything,

82
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.780
it selects the entire amount of text,
that's a different user select.

83
00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.430
I think it's like user-select all,
or something like that.

84
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.130
I don't remember.

85
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.360
But I use it in my app a lot.

86
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.462
And the other one is you can
tell it's safe because it starts

87
00:05:07.462 --> 00:05:12.567
out with two dashes,
which is --webKit.app-region,

88
00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:19.970
which is to say that this title bar is a
thing, you can drag this window by, right.

89
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.819
And so now we're saying that like don't
select the text in the title bar there,

90
00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.573
and also treat that entire title bar,
which is what

91
00:05:29.573 --> 00:05:34.490
that div has the ID of as a thing
that we can drag as part of the app.

92
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.100
All right y'all,
in the world status live coding faux pas,

93
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.260
this is what I typed, this is what it was.

94
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.890
It was one dash and not two dashes.

95
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.280
I feel like, am I just like, did I have
like a moment like where I've, what is it,

96
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.440
the Mandela Effect?

97
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.560
I always thought it was two dashes for
the like secret experimental like CSS.

98
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.270
Like, did I literally
forget how the world works?

99
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.190
Or is this one different and just soak?

100
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.290
I don't know.

101
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.420
So yeah WebKit app region and
now now look at that thing.

102
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.980
It's like a menu bar.

103
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.840
Or a title bar,
whatever it's supposed to be.

104
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.578
Now I can drag this around like,
it's a real app,

105
00:06:15.578 --> 00:06:18.960
like all of its friend app over here,
right?

106
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.900
I can do the same thing.

107
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.290
I'm now hanging out with
the cool kids in this sense.

108
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.800
Cool, so we have that in place.

109
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.690
That felt good.

110
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.550
We are going to do some
various different IPC things.

111
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.970
I just moved this one, too,
to show you, same basic idea.

112
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.761
And you don't have to have anything
written in the title bar if you don't

113
00:06:38.761 --> 00:06:39.270
want to.

114
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.390
It's all up to you once
you start controlling it.

115
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.220
But it's just CSS at that point.

116
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.962
We are going to have some
different IPC endpoints and

117
00:06:47.962 --> 00:06:54.580
I teased to you before there's a way
to not have to add it all to the d.ts.

118
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.902
It's just through some,
the magic of TypeScript,

119
00:06:58.902 --> 00:07:02.844
where we can do something like,
say const API.

120
00:07:07.058 --> 00:07:12.149
That's just saying that like when I
defined it, I'm not adding stuff to

121
00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:18.420
it later in TypeScript, and again, if you
are like I don't, I don't know TypeScript.

122
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:18.920
That's fine.

123
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.778
Let's do export type.

124
00:07:26.797 --> 00:07:29.647
So we're saying go look at this
thing that's never gonna change and

125
00:07:29.647 --> 00:07:31.340
figure out its type.

126
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.250
And then we'll export that.

127
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:42.700
Now in that clipping.d.ts or
actually Electron, I can just simply say,

128
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:51.367
Interface window like I did before,
capital W,

129
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.915
preload API.

130
00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:07.893
So now it will, in this file and basically
go figure out what the type of this object

131
00:08:07.893 --> 00:08:10.575
was, exports the type and
then use it here.

132
00:08:10.575 --> 00:08:13.679
Now clearly like right now that
is simply an empty object, but

133
00:08:13.679 --> 00:08:17.405
as I add stuff to it,
it'll automatically be on that type.

134
00:08:17.405 --> 00:08:19.855
If you like this, good,
here, yeah, use it.

135
00:08:19.855 --> 00:08:23.609
If you do want the sanity check of like
defining the types and the shape of what

136
00:08:23.609 --> 00:08:27.539
you put on the window and then making sure
what you write in preload makes sense,

137
00:08:27.539 --> 00:08:29.725
then do what we did in
the previous section.

138
00:08:29.725 --> 00:08:31.537
The reason I showed you both is like,

139
00:08:31.537 --> 00:08:34.715
honestly, I go back and
forth which one I like better.

140
00:08:34.715 --> 00:08:37.525
So you are more than
welcome to do the same.
