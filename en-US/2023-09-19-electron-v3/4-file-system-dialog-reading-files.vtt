1
00:00:00.081 --> 00:00:01.343
With that, right?

2
00:00:01.343 --> 00:00:06.173
I think it would be interesting
to look at what it would take

3
00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:09.920
to actually trigger
a file system dialog or

4
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.575
something along those lines and
play around with that.

5
00:00:14.575 --> 00:00:18.843
Now, eventually where we choose to go
with this towards the end of this little

6
00:00:18.843 --> 00:00:22.930
section together is I would like it when
I hit the open file button to do it.

7
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.028
All right, but we'll get there cuz we're
still somewhat new at the bridging

8
00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:32.980
the gap, if you will, between the main
process and the renderer process.

9
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.899
So let's kind of just start by, cool,

10
00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:43.424
can I do an OS thing
from inside of electron?

11
00:00:43.424 --> 00:00:46.961
And then we'll get the two way
communication of when they click this

12
00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:50.622
button, then tell the main process,
I would like a file open dialog,

13
00:00:50.622 --> 00:00:55.026
let them pick the file, read the file in the
main process, send me the content over to

14
00:00:55.026 --> 00:00:58.038
the render process so
I can display it in the DOM, right?

15
00:00:58.038 --> 00:01:03.451
That's kind of the first exercise we're
gonna kind of do together as a group

16
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:08.524
is just kind of getting that full
flow from interaction to file system,

17
00:01:08.524 --> 00:01:12.264
access, back into rendering into the DOM,
right?

18
00:01:12.264 --> 00:01:14.537
So that kind of first mission together.

19
00:01:14.537 --> 00:01:15.268
Like I said,

20
00:01:15.268 --> 00:01:19.193
there are a whole bunch of modules in
here that we can pull from and use.

21
00:01:19.193 --> 00:01:24.553
One of the ones we're gonna need
in this case is our good friend,

22
00:01:24.553 --> 00:01:28.261
the dialog module, Right?

23
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:33.069
And so dialog module is
the ability to open dialogs,

24
00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:36.487
file, save dialogs, so on so forth.

25
00:01:36.487 --> 00:01:43.397
And the ability to customize them in
a lot of interesting ways as well.

26
00:01:43.397 --> 00:01:48.559
And so we gonna just give
ourselves some room down here, and

27
00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:56.211
we'll go ahead and we will say something
along the lines of, showOpenDialog, right?

28
00:01:56.211 --> 00:02:02.232
And that's gonna, yeah, it'll be an async
function cuz, again, most of these things

29
00:02:02.232 --> 00:02:07.629
these days will return promises, which
means we can use them with async await.

30
00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:13.095
So in that case we can go ahead
pull this down and then we'll say,

31
00:02:13.095 --> 00:02:19.792
yeah, this is the result and so
we'll await this dialog.showOpenDialog.

32
00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:23.666
And there's a bunch of properties
you can give this, right?

33
00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:27.997
See if we can actually look at
the TypeScript answers here, right?

34
00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:31.561
And so you can configure it and customize
it and a lot of ways you might not be able

35
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:35.026
to normally do in Chromium or in just
regular Chrome in the browser, right?

36
00:02:35.026 --> 00:02:38.541
When we want an open file,
you can let them open an entire directory.

37
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:40.937
Do we want to let them
pick more than one file?

38
00:02:40.937 --> 00:02:42.022
Show hidden files?

39
00:02:42.022 --> 00:02:43.400
Do I give them the ability
to create a directory?

40
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.280
You have a lot of abilities
to customize this.

41
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.062
Do not add to recent.

42
00:02:50.062 --> 00:02:54.223
A bunch of different options here where
you have a lot more control than you would

43
00:02:54.223 --> 00:02:56.161
ever have, there are a lot of these.

44
00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:59.328
It's one of those things where there's
a lot of component parts of electron and

45
00:02:59.328 --> 00:03:02.352
at the same time you get a bunch of new
browser API's that also give you a bunch

46
00:03:02.352 --> 00:03:03.316
of cool stuff, right?

47
00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:07.724
But always I think the full level
cuz these are hooking into a lot of

48
00:03:07.724 --> 00:03:10.785
the MacOS and Windows frameworks directly.

49
00:03:10.785 --> 00:03:14.362
And so you will always get a little
bit more customization than you get in

50
00:03:14.362 --> 00:03:15.442
the browser as well.

51
00:03:15.442 --> 00:03:19.226
So here we're just saying one for
just open a file and

52
00:03:19.226 --> 00:03:23.272
then whatever they choose
will be saved in this result.

53
00:03:23.272 --> 00:03:28.202
And we will wait until we actually
trigger one of these to kind

54
00:03:28.202 --> 00:03:30.529
of see what that looks like.

55
00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:35.255
So, at this point we're just gonna
ask them to pick a file and

56
00:03:35.255 --> 00:03:41.303
then we're just going to see what we
get back from that module, right?

57
00:03:41.303 --> 00:03:44.921
And so what I'll probably do in this case
is I'm just gonna say showOpenDialog,

58
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:47.102
which is kind of where it
means the app will start up,

59
00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:50.491
and immediately,
as soon as it's got the focus,

60
00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:54.859
ask me for what kind of file I wanna open,
and like I said before.

61
00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.757
We just know that it will console log it,
right?

62
00:03:58.757 --> 00:04:03.737
Cool, so let's go ahead and
I'm going to then just kill this and

63
00:04:03.737 --> 00:04:08.696
restart it And

64
00:04:08.696 --> 00:04:14.180
you can see that I get a file open
dialog here as well, right?

65
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.624
And I can pick a file, we'll go ahead and

66
00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:26.039
grab this and
you can see that we get this array.

67
00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.204
We did not cancel.

68
00:04:27.204 --> 00:04:30.924
That's important cuz they could
choose to not open a file, right?

69
00:04:30.924 --> 00:04:33.710
And then we get an array of
the files that they selected.

70
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.765
Now obviously an array,
because we saw that we had the ability,

71
00:04:37.765 --> 00:04:42.288
we can turn off or turn on the ability
to select multiple files, right?

72
00:04:42.288 --> 00:04:46.488
In this case, and I will kinda kill
this app and restart it again.

73
00:04:51.762 --> 00:04:57.373
You will see that I cannot pick, you'll
see that I have not picked more than one.

74
00:04:57.373 --> 00:05:00.944
I know that I'm trying to hold Shift and
click on the second one, but

75
00:05:00.944 --> 00:05:03.338
I can't pick more than
one file in this case.

76
00:05:03.338 --> 00:05:07.371
And so then we have that we can see,
the canceled is false and

77
00:05:07.371 --> 00:05:10.123
we have the directory of files, right?

78
00:05:10.123 --> 00:05:15.168
And so we've gotten an initial
piece in here as well.

79
00:05:15.168 --> 00:05:19.154
We can also do something really cool,
which is,

80
00:05:19.154 --> 00:05:24.319
this application supports
rendering markdown files as HTML.

81
00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:29.700
So do I want to let them
open an image file?

82
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.471
Probably not, right?

83
00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:37.605
I probably wanna scope it
only to markdown files.

84
00:05:37.605 --> 00:05:42.211
And so what I'm able to do there is I can
actually give it this filters, right?

85
00:05:42.211 --> 00:05:45.866
I can actually say,
we will say name, and again,

86
00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:50.827
this name Markdown Files is actually,
you will not see it on MacOS,

87
00:05:50.827 --> 00:05:54.482
you will only see that one
on Windows where it's,

88
00:05:54.482 --> 00:05:58.950
where you pick the file type or
something along those lines.

89
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.004
That is not something that will appear on
MacOS, that'll only appear on Windows.

90
00:06:02.004 --> 00:06:07.294
So some of these things are a little
bit platform specific, that said,

91
00:06:07.294 --> 00:06:12.406
for a lot of the ones that we're gonna
do the sheer amount of code that I

92
00:06:12.406 --> 00:06:17.962
have to write for some of these platform
specific niceties is very little,

93
00:06:17.962 --> 00:06:22.581
this ain't bothering anyone even
if we only use it on MacOS.

94
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:27.640
In fact, we can argue that it's somewhat
at least adding clarity to my code.

95
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.697
All right,
it's not the worst thing in the world.

96
00:06:29.697 --> 00:06:30.528
And we got that in place.

97
00:06:30.528 --> 00:06:32.762
And again,
if you wanna also say dot mark down, yeah,

98
00:06:32.762 --> 00:06:34.520
put it whatever you want in there, right?

99
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.245
It doesn't matter.

100
00:06:36.245 --> 00:06:37.707
That'll all work.

101
00:06:37.707 --> 00:06:43.015
And then let's go ahead, I'm just going
to take a screenshot, for instance.

102
00:06:43.015 --> 00:06:48.135
And we'll go ahead and we'll drag it into

103
00:06:48.135 --> 00:06:53.401
this important documents folder as well,

104
00:06:53.401 --> 00:06:58.241
so that we can verify that screen shot.

105
00:06:58.241 --> 00:07:00.910
Cool, so
now I've got that filter in place.

106
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.001
Let's go ahead and
we'll start our code back up.

107
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.965
Boom, we'll go over to our app.

108
00:07:09.965 --> 00:07:13.894
And if I go into that important documents,
I cannot pick the screenshot, right?

109
00:07:13.894 --> 00:07:18.919
Cuz I've said only things that end in
a dot MD that are marked down files.

110
00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:21.394
Yeah, theoretically,
could I allow text files?

111
00:07:21.394 --> 00:07:24.234
Yeah, I could allow all those things,
right?

112
00:07:24.234 --> 00:07:27.467
But for the most part, I can get very
specific about what they can and

113
00:07:27.467 --> 00:07:28.166
cannot open.

114
00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:31.980
I don't necessarily have to have very
defensive code later to make sure there's

115
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.169
a file that I know about.

116
00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:34.538
And yeah, arguably,

117
00:07:34.538 --> 00:07:39.435
maybe you should still have the defensive
code just in case, but the idea that you

118
00:07:39.435 --> 00:07:44.062
can have full control of this window I
think is incredibly powerful as well.

119
00:07:44.062 --> 00:07:48.829
Great, and as you can see that time
I cancelled it at this point I get

120
00:07:48.829 --> 00:07:52.338
cancelled as true, and
I don't think about it.

121
00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:56.834
So then we come down to the fact
that we have a file path, right?

122
00:07:56.834 --> 00:08:00.306
So then the next step is,
I guess, to read the file.

123
00:08:00.306 --> 00:08:02.761
Does anyone wanna take a wild
guess on how to read a file?

124
00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:09.916
It's just a node library for reading
a file, you just have access to node.

125
00:08:09.916 --> 00:08:13.918
&gt;&gt; FS.
&gt;&gt; FS, I am a gentleman, so for

126
00:08:13.918 --> 00:08:17.795
me it's gonna be FS promises.

127
00:08:22.893 --> 00:08:25.870
In this case we'll do read file,
and there's again,

128
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.250
like if you said open directory,
you could do the read outer.

129
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:33.424
You have all of the options to read
files and node available to you.

130
00:08:33.424 --> 00:08:38.306
And if you want to use any of the other
libraries that are abstractions around

131
00:08:38.306 --> 00:08:43.340
to the FS library node like any other
file system like replacement libraries,

132
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.578
those all work to.

133
00:08:44.578 --> 00:08:46.182
And this is a node process.

134
00:08:46.182 --> 00:08:50.997
Anything like new node you can do here,
you're just running a predetermined

135
00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:55.960
version of node, given the electron
version that you're running and which and

136
00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.847
yeah, again, considering this is
electron 26, it is most likely maybe one

137
00:09:00.847 --> 00:09:05.172
minor version or patch version back or
something along those lines.

138
00:09:05.172 --> 00:09:10.272
So we could theoretically,
we know that if the result is canceled,

139
00:09:10.272 --> 00:09:13.587
just return, I don't want to do anything.

140
00:09:13.587 --> 00:09:18.058
And then we'll say give me the first
filePath from all those filePaths.

141
00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:23.572
And again, these are mostly
somewhat both defensive coding and

142
00:09:23.572 --> 00:09:28.791
then also some of us here need
to appease TypeScript as well.

143
00:09:28.791 --> 00:09:31.494
But I think it assumes that
if I haven't canceled it,

144
00:09:31.494 --> 00:09:34.145
that I have at least one filePath,
so that's good.

145
00:09:34.145 --> 00:09:38.595
So we can do content equals readFile or

146
00:09:38.595 --> 00:09:44.304
await readFile and
read that file and we should.

147
00:09:44.304 --> 00:09:51.008
Let's go ahead and we'll console log both,
the content and the result in this case.

148
00:09:56.904 --> 00:10:00.873
Cool, I'll go ahead and
I will go grab a file

149
00:10:03.927 --> 00:10:08.226
As you can see, the content is
the mark down that is in the file.

150
00:10:08.226 --> 00:10:10.721
The result is what we saw previously,
right?

151
00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:14.829
Now I have the ability to trigger
a file system dialog from my UI,

152
00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:19.710
then have that determine which one node
is gonna read from and read the file.

153
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:24.269
I am getting dangerously close
to actually getting it into

154
00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:27.431
the render context at this point, and so

155
00:10:27.431 --> 00:10:32.656
there's a few little slight tweaks
that I might choose to do here.

156
00:10:32.656 --> 00:10:36.252
That I'm just gonna kinda refactor it
slightly because I know future me is gonna

157
00:10:36.252 --> 00:10:38.032
want some of these refactors, right?

158
00:10:38.032 --> 00:10:41.670
&gt;&gt; Is there a way to get this code to
load without having to restart the app

159
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:42.374
every time?

160
00:10:42.374 --> 00:10:45.761
&gt;&gt; You can try to use nodemon or something
along those lines any of the things that

161
00:10:45.761 --> 00:10:48.642
will automatically restart
the code every single time, right?

162
00:10:48.642 --> 00:10:50.013
Will work as well.

163
00:10:50.013 --> 00:10:53.241
In so far that I am triggering
file system dialogs, and

164
00:10:53.241 --> 00:10:57.475
stuff along those lines right now,
I just chose to keep my life simple, and

165
00:10:57.475 --> 00:11:00.903
be manual about it, but yeah,
your client side code with Vite or

166
00:11:00.903 --> 00:11:04.230
Webpack will automatically
do the hot module reloading.

167
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.403
Your server side code, the same way you
can automatically restart any node server,

168
00:11:08.403 --> 00:11:09.754
if you like nodemon great,

169
00:11:09.754 --> 00:11:13.364
if there's some other library you'd
like to use that will work as well.

170
00:11:13.364 --> 00:11:17.855
Those are options you can either,
NPM, install dash D them and

171
00:11:17.855 --> 00:11:21.838
then use an NPX or
you can just globally install those and

172
00:11:21.838 --> 00:11:27.121
choose to nodemon this instead of NPM
start that will work for you as well.

173
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:29.254
I am personally going to choose not to.

174
00:11:29.254 --> 00:11:32.934
I just don't need to add extra chaos
elements while I'm live coding, right?

175
00:11:32.934 --> 00:11:35.012
Cuz no one wants me to stop and

176
00:11:35.012 --> 00:11:38.918
debug if I have some kind of
boo boo along those lines.

177
00:11:38.918 --> 00:11:44.570
So yeah, so the one thing that I just
wanna do here as a quick refactor

178
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:50.141
is just separate out the idea of
choosing a file and opening a file.

179
00:11:50.141 --> 00:11:54.359
Because we know that right now,
I can trigger showOpenDialog, but

180
00:11:54.359 --> 00:11:59.689
eventually on a long enough timeline, and
yeah, we won't get to all of these today.

181
00:11:59.689 --> 00:12:01.657
But there are other ways to open a file,
right?

182
00:12:01.657 --> 00:12:03.978
There's dragging it into the window,
right?

183
00:12:03.978 --> 00:12:07.488
And you might choose to use that API
that's available in the browser to

184
00:12:07.488 --> 00:12:09.521
communicate that you wanna open a file.

185
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:14.557
There's using a file open menu, right?

186
00:12:14.557 --> 00:12:16.117
For a given window or
something along those lines.

187
00:12:16.117 --> 00:12:20.609
There's a ton of different
ways to do this, right?

188
00:12:20.609 --> 00:12:25.457
And so I just don't necessarily
want to have both of those

189
00:12:25.457 --> 00:12:30.411
pieces of functionality
necessarily tied to each other.

190
00:12:30.411 --> 00:12:32.262
And we'll see why in a little bit.

191
00:12:32.262 --> 00:12:35.889
So I'm just gonna separate out
the idea of opening a file.

192
00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:40.847
And here we'll just say that opening file
will take some kind of filePath that

193
00:12:40.847 --> 00:12:42.232
is gonna be a string.

194
00:12:42.232 --> 00:12:44.647
And again this that is the level
of TypeScript that I'm dealing

195
00:12:44.647 --> 00:12:45.292
with right now.

196
00:12:45.292 --> 00:12:48.517
It's just saying that my argument is
a string and getting that safety.

197
00:12:48.517 --> 00:12:52.662
Other than that we've been doing
TypeScript the entire time, and

198
00:12:52.662 --> 00:12:54.968
you haven't necessarily noticed.

199
00:12:54.968 --> 00:12:57.361
So we got that in place.

200
00:12:57.361 --> 00:13:02.287
And then what we'll do is we'll just
kind of start by pulling this out.

201
00:13:05.327 --> 00:13:07.042
And we'll just say,

202
00:13:07.042 --> 00:13:12.486
we might even choose to return
the filePath in the showOpenDialog.

203
00:13:12.486 --> 00:13:16.641
I don't know necessarily what
I want totally just yet.

204
00:13:16.641 --> 00:13:19.388
But we'll figure it out as we get there,
right?

205
00:13:19.388 --> 00:13:24.352
So basically the same code except
now we've just separated it

206
00:13:24.352 --> 00:13:26.646
out just a teeny bit as well.

207
00:13:26.646 --> 00:13:32.195
There are a few other niceties and
this one is a "MacOS only" one.

208
00:13:32.195 --> 00:13:35.750
But like I said it won't do
anything different on Windows,

209
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:40.059
you will see no difference in the same
way this didn't do anything on MacOS.

210
00:13:40.059 --> 00:13:45.075
Everyone's gonna get some niceties for
themselves is that it is less apparent

211
00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:50.091
in modern versions of MacOS, but if
you've been on Mac a little bit, remember

212
00:13:50.091 --> 00:13:55.107
when it used to have that whole animation
where it would come down from the title

213
00:13:55.107 --> 00:14:00.129
bar in an accordion or whatever, like
a curtain that was coming down, right?

214
00:14:00.129 --> 00:14:01.846
There's a way to get that effect as well.

215
00:14:01.846 --> 00:14:04.973
Right now, my showOpenDialog just
kind of pops in front of the window.

216
00:14:04.973 --> 00:14:09.705
We can have it effectively
attached to the window as well.

217
00:14:09.705 --> 00:14:12.550
And because it is shockingly easy to do,

218
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:17.331
and I will also need this functionality
later, we're gonna do it.

219
00:14:17.331 --> 00:14:21.038
So we'll just say that our
showOpenDialog will take

220
00:14:21.038 --> 00:14:25.479
some kind of browser window,
which is gonna be a browser window.

221
00:14:25.479 --> 00:14:30.247
Again, that is the amount of TypeScript
that I need to deal with in my life

222
00:14:30.247 --> 00:14:31.038
right now.

223
00:14:31.038 --> 00:14:36.975
And we can pass it in as the first
argument to the showOpenDialog.

224
00:14:36.975 --> 00:14:41.657
And what that does
effectively on MacOS and

225
00:14:41.657 --> 00:14:50.384
MacOS only will effectively attach
showOpenDialog to that window, right?

226
00:14:50.384 --> 00:14:53.912
And again, if you're running
a slightly older version of MacOS,

227
00:14:53.912 --> 00:14:56.942
this will be more dramatic
than what we're about to see.

228
00:14:56.942 --> 00:15:04.073
But it's still a present and real thing.

229
00:15:04.073 --> 00:15:08.667
See this is why I use TypeScript because
I was about to go and look at it and

230
00:15:08.667 --> 00:15:13.811
it was not gonna work because I did not
pass in that mainWindow to that function.

231
00:15:13.811 --> 00:15:18.268
I was why do I have a red
dot next to my index.ts is

232
00:15:18.268 --> 00:15:23.414
because my code was broken and
because types are good.

233
00:15:23.414 --> 00:15:28.224
So with that, We can start it up.

234
00:15:30.293 --> 00:15:33.881
Now you can see that it is
kinda attached this window and

235
00:15:33.881 --> 00:15:39.497
as I move this window around, it's not the
same dramatic fully attached sheet that it

236
00:15:39.497 --> 00:15:44.809
was in previous versions of MacOS but it
is now very much attached to this window.

237
00:15:44.809 --> 00:15:47.211
If you are Windows or
Linux you notice nothing.

238
00:15:47.211 --> 00:15:51.450
In the same way that when we put that
markdown files in the filters those of us

239
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:56.051
on MacOS notice nothing, everyone gets
to notice nothing in a different sense.

240
00:15:56.051 --> 00:16:01.276
But those little accoutrements
are the things that separate this feeling,

241
00:16:01.276 --> 00:16:06.008
some janky app, why did I download
and install this on my computer to

242
00:16:06.008 --> 00:16:08.717
a thing that fits into that OS, right?

243
00:16:08.717 --> 00:16:11.471
And we are somewhat lucky because we're so

244
00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:16.597
used to web apps that we don't necessarily
have to, are there UI libraries that

245
00:16:16.597 --> 00:16:21.743
seek to make the buttons look like MacOS
or Windows buttons using CSS there are.

246
00:16:21.743 --> 00:16:26.829
I sense my personal belief system is
that there's an uncanny valley there,

247
00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:31.039
which is if you try to make it
look exactly like MacOS using CSS,

248
00:16:31.039 --> 00:16:35.021
you will get 80% there and
that is worse than not trying.

249
00:16:35.021 --> 00:16:38.635
But generally speaking, when we can get
some of these nice things, we'll see

250
00:16:38.635 --> 00:16:42.386
some other things we can do along the way,
we should go for it because it's good.

251
00:16:42.386 --> 00:16:44.780
So we've got that there as well.
