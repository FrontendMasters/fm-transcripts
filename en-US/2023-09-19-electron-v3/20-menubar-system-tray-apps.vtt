1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.674
So, let's make this a menu bar icon,
right,

2
00:00:03.674 --> 00:00:06.887
or at least there's two pieces to this.

3
00:00:06.887 --> 00:00:11.988
There is the ability to add stuff
to what is called a system tray

4
00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:17.180
in Windows and probably Linux,
and the menu bar in MacOS.

5
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.333
It'd be cool if we could
put icons in there as well.

6
00:00:25.123 --> 00:00:28.146
For those of you watching the live stream,
I had to make one change and

7
00:00:28.146 --> 00:00:29.043
push something up.

8
00:00:29.043 --> 00:00:32.647
For those of you watching
the recording this never happened and

9
00:00:32.647 --> 00:00:37.016
everything will be okay from the very
beginning because of the magic of Git.

10
00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:42.223
So I have these two icons, and
one thing I do wanna point

11
00:00:42.223 --> 00:00:47.600
out Is that the name is
somewhat important here.

12
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.680
And I will explain why in a second.

13
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.650
But I have these two icons.

14
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.380
And there are some rules
about getting it to fit in.

15
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.933
Generally speaking, you want,
I believe, depending on the OS,

16
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:07.953
it's somewhere between 16 and 18 pixels,
whether it's the Windows system tray or

17
00:01:07.953 --> 00:01:12.160
the Mac menu bar, and
then it also depends on what version.

18
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.510
I just tend to go with 18 by 18.

19
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.040
It has not failed me or
wronged me in any way, shape, or form.

20
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.055
The one thing that I want to draw
to your attention is that it is,

21
00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:31.130
at least on MacOS, critically important
that it ends in Template.png.

22
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.639
Because that is meaningful to MacOS.

23
00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:38.858
Furthermore, if one would
like to do this and

24
00:01:38.858 --> 00:01:42.744
make sure that it ends in Template.png,

25
00:01:42.744 --> 00:01:50.925
it is critically important that it have
exclusively one grayscale color, right?

26
00:01:50.925 --> 00:01:54.125
Now if one's gonna live a life like that,
might I suggest white or black?

27
00:01:54.125 --> 00:02:00.124
But it doesn't really matter,
it just matters that it is exclusively

28
00:02:00.124 --> 00:02:05.120
one grayscale color, PNG, and
that it ends in Template.

29
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.051
The reason for this is,
as long as you follow those rules,

30
00:02:10.051 --> 00:02:15.040
you do not need to make two different
icons for light and dark mode, right?

31
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.969
As long as there's one grayscale color and
it ends in template,

32
00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.023
MacOS will make it white
if it should be white, and

33
00:02:22.023 --> 00:02:25.580
it will make it black if
it should be black, right?

34
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.898
If you deviate from this, it is now on you
to read what mode the operating system is,

35
00:02:29.898 --> 00:02:32.300
what color the desktop background is.

36
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.070
Good luck on that one,
I don't even know how you did that one.

37
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.317
So generally speaking,
I would follow that rule if I were you and

38
00:02:41.317 --> 00:02:45.180
get all of this functionality for free.

39
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.086
I happen to use a white one at this point,
I think in the folder for fire sale,

40
00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:54.685
it's a black one, just so I can make
a point if I wanted to at some point,

41
00:02:54.685 --> 00:02:56.319
I don't really care to.

42
00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.237
But it will do the right thing on MacOS
as long as you follow that heuristic.

43
00:03:01.237 --> 00:03:07.853
With that, setting something up
as a system tray or menu bar,

44
00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:14.610
you're seeing a recurring theme here,
not that kind of tray.

45
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.890
Which is you can pull in the tray module.

46
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.618
I will let tray, ideally, hopefully,

47
00:03:23.618 --> 00:03:28.020
be a tray at some point or another.

48
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.880
You could theoretically try to keep
it bound to the window in app ready.

49
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.261
I guess I could probably just do
this in app ready, but you'll probably.

50
00:03:36.261 --> 00:03:40.385
I say probably, I've never thought about
whether or not you could have three menu

51
00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:44.300
bar icons from the same app cuz I've never
wanted to do that before in my life.

52
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.727
Sometimes when you're teaching people,
you realize that's a question I might get

53
00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:50.766
asked in about three minutes that
independently as a person trying to build

54
00:03:50.766 --> 00:03:52.930
something for
a reason had never occurred to me.

55
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.084
But you start to wonder these
questions that you're gonna ask about

56
00:03:55.084 --> 00:03:56.730
a second in advance.

57
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.480
I don't know.

58
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.390
I will leave that as an exercise
to the reader, probably.

59
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.134
But I want one, and so I will kind
of have that so I can use it for

60
00:04:06.134 --> 00:04:08.400
whatever I need to use it for.

61
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.780
And then I do need to wait for
the application to be ready.

62
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.950
At which point I can say,
let tray = new tray.

63
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:25.960
I don't think I have dirname in
an ESM situation, so I just will.

64
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.628
I happen to know that it's dots,
cuz it's from the directory

65
00:04:31.628 --> 00:04:36.976
that you start the application from,
is the process CWD.

66
00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:40.830
I used to know the difference
between dirname and

67
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.342
process current working
directory until ESM modules and

68
00:04:45.342 --> 00:04:50.713
node came out and dirname went away,
and you have to get a URL and get...

69
00:04:50.713 --> 00:04:56.088
I have written those functions in my
apps once and use them everywhere.

70
00:04:56.088 --> 00:04:59.821
The variable is called __dirname and
I treat it the same way, but

71
00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:03.232
I write that once per project,
I have since long forgotten.

72
00:05:03.232 --> 00:05:05.582
And this one is called tray template.

73
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.420
Let's just start there.

74
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.870
We don't need to let,
we want the global one.

75
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.686
Ideally, unless I have talked and

76
00:05:18.686 --> 00:05:24.080
opined on things changing
underneath me whilst working.

77
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.980
It looks like maybe I got
something wrong there.

78
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.949
Let's see, tray template,

79
00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:38.040
tray template, icons, there we go.

80
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.570
That's why we don't talk in code.

81
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:46.540
And now you can see that it
shows up in my menu bar as well.

82
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.260
And you can do all sorts
of stuff with this.

83
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.240
You could theoretically throw a context
menu on there and just have that show up.

84
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.070
For instance, let's do that.

85
00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.369
We could theoretically, let's say

86
00:06:07.885 --> 00:06:12.139
You can do tray on click, and you could
have it theoretically, I don't know,

87
00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.450
show a context menu,
something along those lines.

88
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.506
In fact, let's do this, let's make
a context menu which theoretically,

89
00:06:20.506 --> 00:06:25.450
you can IPC send over if they do
a right-click in the render process.

90
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.510
Or you can use it on the tray,
it's the same basic idea at this point.

91
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:35.420
But we could theoretically
just say const contextMenu.

92
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.600
And let's go ahead and say menu.

93
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.300
Gotta pull that in.

94
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.760
.buildFromTemplate, like we saw the with
application menu, cuz it's no different.

95
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.714
It's just instead of being
the application menu,

96
00:06:48.714 --> 00:06:51.132
it's a menu that you trigger
programmatically at some point.

97
00:06:51.132 --> 00:06:55.385
Whether that be on the context
menu event in the DOM, or,

98
00:06:55.385 --> 00:07:00.240
in this case, I'm doing it
from the main process as well.

99
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.171
And we'll just say, I don't know, label,

100
00:07:04.171 --> 00:07:08.730
we'll just say open,
I don't know, show window?

101
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.880
Let's do show window, that feels good.

102
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.782
We'll do show window, and,
we'll say that when they click on it,

103
00:07:15.782 --> 00:07:17.750
sure, that seems great.

104
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:18.710
I love it.

105
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.575
In fact, I'm just gonna do the same
stuff that we saw previously and

106
00:07:26.575 --> 00:07:29.805
make sure that it's
the focused window as well.

107
00:07:29.805 --> 00:07:32.744
And then, I don't know, let's do,
what do you think, quit?

108
00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:34.744
I like quit, let's do that.

109
00:07:34.744 --> 00:07:37.284
Nobody agreed with me, but it's fine.

110
00:07:37.284 --> 00:07:41.146
We can give that one the role of quit.

111
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.845
Cool and then what we can do is
we've got that menu in place,

112
00:07:49.845 --> 00:07:52.499
we've got our context menu.

113
00:07:52.499 --> 00:08:01.780
And then I can just do
tray.setContextMenu to that contextMenu.

114
00:08:06.222 --> 00:08:07.900
Show window, quit.

115
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:14.049
That's kinda cool, I guess, it's fine.
