1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.741
I'm trying to think if there's any
major things that we need to do here.

2
00:00:03.741 --> 00:00:05.524
Or I think the last two things for

3
00:00:05.524 --> 00:00:09.698
the OS integration piece of this would
be to get these two buttons working.

4
00:00:09.698 --> 00:00:13.482
Like I've said, reverting would just be
asking for the last saved content and

5
00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:14.641
changing the DOM back.

6
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:17.395
So I'll kinda leave that for
you all as well.

7
00:00:17.395 --> 00:00:22.087
But I think getting these two kinda show
two more I think important pieces that you

8
00:00:22.087 --> 00:00:25.822
might use in your application
rather than just more of the same.

9
00:00:25.822 --> 00:00:28.173
So why don't I do one of these, and

10
00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:31.831
then I'm gonna have you all
do the other one, right?

11
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:36.995
And so there's this library, which we
can argue and Electron maybe doesn't

12
00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:42.282
have the best name in the world, Called
shell, right, cuz I guess, whatever.

13
00:00:42.282 --> 00:00:46.981
If we go look at the shell library,
there's not a lot in here, but

14
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:51.262
there's showItemInFolder,
openPath, openExternal.

15
00:00:51.262 --> 00:00:54.903
You can actually legit trash
an item in the file system, right?

16
00:00:54.903 --> 00:00:59.113
So if I wanted to hit a Delete button,
we could literally.

17
00:00:59.113 --> 00:01:02.645
And it will handle all the parts
of moving it into the trash,

18
00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:04.916
operating system agnostic, right?

19
00:01:04.916 --> 00:01:10.307
So yes, you do need to think about
the UX of the peculiarities of your OS.

20
00:01:10.307 --> 00:01:14.395
But in terms of the specifics of
Linux versus Windows versus Mac OS,

21
00:01:14.395 --> 00:01:16.989
you don't have to think about any of that.

22
00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:20.927
You just call it based on
that kinda given behavior.

23
00:01:20.927 --> 00:01:25.902
So the ones that we care a lot about
are openPath, which we'll go ahead and

24
00:01:25.902 --> 00:01:30.492
seek to open it in the desktop
operating system's default manner.

25
00:01:30.492 --> 00:01:32.381
So for a markdown file,

26
00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:37.393
that is gonna be whatever you
normally open markdown files in.

27
00:01:37.393 --> 00:01:41.232
The other one that is super
useful is showItemInFolder.

28
00:01:41.232 --> 00:01:44.353
If we go into VS Code, for instance,

29
00:01:44.353 --> 00:01:48.900
I right-click this,
you'll see Reveal in Finder.

30
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.062
Guess what method that's using.

31
00:01:51.062 --> 00:01:56.200
It's using the one that
we have seen previously.

32
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.528
So I'll do Reveal in Finder and

33
00:01:59.528 --> 00:02:04.910
you get to do open in default application,
cool.

34
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.450
So I will say ipc,
icp is something very different.

35
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.689
We'll say show in file system,
show-in-folder, I like it.

36
00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:22.069
And honestly, I know the current file.

37
00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.782
I don't really need anything else
from that event to be clear.

38
00:02:27.782 --> 00:02:32.823
I can say if,
I don't wanna do the get currentFile cuz

39
00:02:32.823 --> 00:02:38.774
that's going to ask me for
the shows dialog if it's not there.

40
00:02:38.774 --> 00:02:43.670
So we'll just say,
if currentFile.filePath.

41
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.562
And then we gotta pull in
the shell module from Electron.

42
00:02:48.851 --> 00:02:51.800
Beyond that, we're just gonna
say open the current file.

43
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.643
I don't know what happens if
you give it an empty string.

44
00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:59.676
We can find that out
together in a little bit.

45
00:02:59.676 --> 00:03:03.372
But yeah, it will basically go ahead and

46
00:03:03.372 --> 00:03:08.163
proceed to show you where
that is in the file system.

47
00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:11.995
So all we need to do at
this point is then, again,

48
00:03:11.995 --> 00:03:15.555
do the dance of making it available,
right?

49
00:03:15.555 --> 00:03:20.402
So we can do show,
what did I call it in my main process?

50
00:03:20.402 --> 00:03:22.149
I called it show-in-folder?

51
00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:26.710
All right, let's call that here as well.

52
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.471
ShowInFolder, and
that really doesn't need anything other

53
00:03:31.471 --> 00:03:36.058
than to do ipcRenderer.send
show-in-folder, right?

54
00:03:36.058 --> 00:03:41.930
And like I said, if you get tired of this,
there are some ways to optimize this.

55
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.767
You could, for instance, keep an array
of the methods that you allow.

56
00:03:47.767 --> 00:03:52.997
And that way, you can only send
stuff over those channels that will,

57
00:03:52.997 --> 00:03:58.136
again, allow lists and give you
a certain amount of the security for

58
00:03:58.136 --> 00:04:00.589
a little bit more convenience.

59
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:05.611
The reason that I'm not choosing to do
that is because I am using TypeScript.

60
00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:09.784
And I would like the type checking for
the correct thing that each one,

61
00:04:09.784 --> 00:04:14.469
if it takes an HTML string, that's
different than just having an allow list.

62
00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:19.210
I will show you a way to get around
putting it in the type every time probably

63
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.203
right after this cuz I'm getting
really tired of doing this.

64
00:04:23.203 --> 00:04:27.173
But to kind of just make the point real
quick, we'll just showInFolder, and

65
00:04:27.173 --> 00:04:30.611
that doesn't really take anything,
so it's pretty easy to add.

66
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:34.670
There's an argument about why you
would also choose to do this manually,

67
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.557
which is there's something
about your own sanity.

68
00:04:37.557 --> 00:04:41.864
It's tedious, but
then you have to manually do it, right?

69
00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:46.922
But I'll show you how to get around it if
you wanna get around it as well, awesome.

70
00:04:46.922 --> 00:04:52.014
And like we said before,
that one's exposed there.

71
00:04:52.014 --> 00:04:57.314
So we can actually now just go
back into our renderer process and

72
00:04:57.314 --> 00:05:00.123
do Elements.ShowFileButton.

73
00:05:00.123 --> 00:05:05.275
And we'll just call it
window.api.showInFolder,

74
00:05:05.275 --> 00:05:08.749
and I do need to restart the process.

75
00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:14.246
I'm yelled at for something, but
it looks like I fixed that since then.

76
00:05:14.246 --> 00:05:19.421
Cool, and so now,
I probably need to enable that button.

77
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:21.129
We'll do it in the DOM for a second.

78
00:05:22.427 --> 00:05:25.895
So go ahead and
I think when I open a file,

79
00:05:25.895 --> 00:05:30.799
I probably need to also then
choose to on the file opened.

80
00:05:30.799 --> 00:05:34.857
But for the meantime,
we'll cheat for a second.

81
00:05:34.857 --> 00:05:38.029
And go ahead and
I should be able to click that.

82
00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:43.640
I opened that one in the default editor,
so I did the opposite one.

83
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.159
Let's see, I did openPath.

84
00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:51.794
I meant to do showItemInFolder, but
I gave you the answer for the exercise.

85
00:05:51.794 --> 00:05:57.560
So showItemInFolder versus openPath,
we'll open it in the default one.

86
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.313
It's what happens when you're talking and
typing simultaneously,

87
00:06:02.313 --> 00:06:05.614
so showInFolder, at least get the right,

88
00:06:05.614 --> 00:06:10.590
Have a little bit of self respect,
you know what I mean?

89
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.608
And then let's actually go ahead and say
while we're at it in the preload script.

90
00:06:16.608 --> 00:06:23.795
Cuz now we have that onFileOpen, so we'll
actually do this now in the renderer.

91
00:06:23.795 --> 00:06:29.332
So onFileOpen, we should be able
to say Elements.ShowFileButton

92
00:06:29.332 --> 00:06:33.032
disabled is now false
cuz we've opened one.

93
00:06:33.032 --> 00:06:39.443
And so now, it should be able to
see that we can, Upon opening it,

94
00:06:39.443 --> 00:06:44.434
it's now enabled and
then we see it in the file system.

95
00:06:44.434 --> 00:06:47.671
So we get that OS
integration there as well.

96
00:06:47.671 --> 00:06:52.181
So kinda gave you the answer, but
just for practice for a second,

97
00:06:52.181 --> 00:06:57.606
why don't you spend three minutes just
getting now the opposite one in place?

98
00:06:57.606 --> 00:07:01.090
The open and default application,
which is openPath, and

99
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.745
we'll kinda just do it
together real quick.

100
00:07:03.745 --> 00:07:07.075
And then, well, I think for the most part,

101
00:07:07.075 --> 00:07:10.867
wrap up this little application for
a little bit.

102
00:07:11.963 --> 00:07:16.641
All right, [COUGH] so
now we've got one of the buttons working.

103
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:20.619
We're just trying to get
the other one working.

104
00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:25.832
Luckily, it is a very similar
pattern in both cases.

105
00:07:25.832 --> 00:07:31.936
So we'll start with over in here,
we'll just say,

106
00:07:31.936 --> 00:07:37.360
ipcMain, and
then we're gonna do open-in-default,

107
00:07:39.548 --> 00:07:43.058
default-application.

108
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.299
And that is again one little guard clause,

109
00:07:49.299 --> 00:07:55.182
not entirely sure what happens
if you pass it an empty string.

110
00:07:55.182 --> 00:07:59.507
But we've got it in place, so
we'll do the openPath, and

111
00:07:59.507 --> 00:08:02.525
that should get us most of the way there.

112
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:12.224
ShowInDefaultApplication, and
that doesn't really involve anything.

113
00:08:13.658 --> 00:08:17.688
And now we should be able to say,

114
00:08:18.983 --> 00:08:23.933
We'll open in the default,
OpenInDefaultApplication,

115
00:08:23.933 --> 00:08:30.075
we'll listen for that, and
we'll also send that same message, right?

116
00:08:30.075 --> 00:08:32.610
And then the main process gets it.

117
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.170
Everything works out great.

118
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:36.759
We'll do the same.

119
00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:40.203
I might do at some point,
probably not right now,

120
00:08:40.203 --> 00:08:45.216
is cuz when we save a file, there's
also the fact that we now have a file.

121
00:08:45.216 --> 00:08:49.346
So I might just send a message being,
hey, we currently have a file now,

122
00:08:49.346 --> 00:08:52.548
right, which will then
activate all of these buttons.

123
00:08:52.548 --> 00:08:57.501
But for now,
we'll just do it here cuz I think it gets

124
00:08:57.501 --> 00:09:00.778
the point across as we go through.

125
00:09:00.778 --> 00:09:02.299
And real quickly,

126
00:09:02.299 --> 00:09:07.820
all we should need to do at that point
was kinda get into the flow of it.

127
00:09:09.377 --> 00:09:12.101
That one, so we should be able to file.

128
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.570
Now I can open that up,

129
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:21.148
showInDefaultApplication is
not a function.

130
00:09:21.148 --> 00:09:26.708
Did I not put it on there or
did I misspell it?

131
00:09:26.708 --> 00:09:34.057
I just added the type, I didn't actually,
the error message is legit.

132
00:09:36.791 --> 00:09:37.291
Cool.

133
00:09:39.749 --> 00:09:42.334
All right, now open a file.

134
00:09:45.102 --> 00:09:50.275
Almost, let's see,
we've got showInDefaultApplication,

135
00:09:50.275 --> 00:09:53.925
it says show-in-default-application.

136
00:09:53.925 --> 00:09:57.867
Did I open-in-default-application?

137
00:09:57.867 --> 00:10:01.728
One of these things is not like the other.

138
00:10:01.728 --> 00:10:09.111
I think open-in-default-application is
the better one, so I'm gonna go with that.

139
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.649
We'll keep that the same, though.

140
00:10:15.995 --> 00:10:23.895
Actually, I'll make it consistent,
we're worth it.

141
00:10:26.235 --> 00:10:30.017
The glory of TypeScript helping me.

142
00:10:30.017 --> 00:10:36.025
As long as I get the red squiggly
lines to vanish, we should be good.

143
00:10:36.025 --> 00:10:42.084
All right, openInDefaultApplication then
calls that openInDefaultApplication,

144
00:10:42.084 --> 00:10:46.903
openInDefaultApplication,
open-in-default-application.

145
00:10:46.903 --> 00:10:50.143
The security dance is fun, but arguably,

146
00:10:50.143 --> 00:10:54.284
the downside of losing the security dance,
also fun.

147
00:10:55.869 --> 00:10:56.414
Open file.

148
00:10:57.873 --> 00:11:01.622
And now we can open in
the default application.

149
00:11:01.622 --> 00:11:05.080
And again,
we're kind of becoming a nice player.

150
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.656
I would argue I was
about to make the joke.

151
00:11:07.656 --> 00:11:12.513
Look, we're playing nice with all
the other native applications as I

152
00:11:12.513 --> 00:11:16.220
in one Electron app hit
openInDefaultApplication,

153
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.775
which caused it to open up in
another Electron app on my computer.

154
00:11:20.775 --> 00:11:24.351
But I guess that's the value
of the course, right?
