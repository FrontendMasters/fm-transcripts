1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.742
What I want is something like this app,
or this app, or this app,

2
00:00:06.742 --> 00:00:12.150
where I see the app, or
I see a thing that I can interact with.

3
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.852
This isn't fun, I want something like

4
00:00:16.852 --> 00:00:21.420
one of these, right, in place here.

5
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.130
So there's a trick.

6
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.701
Can you do that in Electron?

7
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:31.473
No, you cannot, sorry.

8
00:00:31.473 --> 00:00:35.906
Can you hide this window and

9
00:00:35.906 --> 00:00:44.209
then use a library to
position it right about here?

10
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.228
And then when this is clicked,
show this window, and then hide it again?

11
00:00:51.228 --> 00:00:57.549
You can do that, [LAUGH] does that
get us almost all of the way there?

12
00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:59.822
It does, right?

13
00:00:59.822 --> 00:01:05.713
So we could turn this whole
app into a menu bar app and

14
00:01:05.713 --> 00:01:12.430
do that instead,
that feels like a thing that we could do.

15
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.749
And that is, again, shockingly simple.

16
00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:20.664
I'm just making sure, there's a library
that I might need to install,

17
00:01:20.664 --> 00:01:22.662
called electron-positioner.

18
00:01:22.662 --> 00:01:25.743
I have the types for it, all these dev
dependencies are in the wrong order.

19
00:01:25.743 --> 00:01:31.477
electron-positioner, which has a bunch of
functionality, but most notably it's for

20
00:01:31.477 --> 00:01:35.923
positioning windows, and
it's got a whole bunch of ways to do that.

21
00:01:35.923 --> 00:01:40.852
The ones that we care about in our
time together here is I wanna put

22
00:01:40.852 --> 00:01:42.690
it right here, right?

23
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.500
Where this menu ought to be,
to give the illusion.

24
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.350
And I mean, I don't even know,
who knows what these are, right?

25
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.380
These could be Electron apps too,
for all I know.

26
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.080
I want to give the illusion
that it is a peer to any one of

27
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.596
these other applications.

28
00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:02.095
So let's go ahead and let's try that out.

29
00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:07.480
And so, cool, we got that in place.

30
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.800
I don't really need this context
menu anymore, that was cool.

31
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.317
And again, you can literally do the same
when you right-click on something,

32
00:02:15.317 --> 00:02:16.760
have a custom menu.

33
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.426
It is effectively, you request the menu
through IPC, you send it back,

34
00:02:21.426 --> 00:02:22.274
you open it.

35
00:02:22.274 --> 00:02:26.874
So we've got this onClick here
that we can do stuff with.

36
00:02:26.874 --> 00:02:31.323
And so let's pull in
electron-positioner in this case.

37
00:02:31.323 --> 00:02:36.745
And so what I'll do here is I'll say,
import positioner.

38
00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:44.070
I think I want the full positioner,
if I'm not mistaken,

39
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.350
I'm doing that a little bit from memory.

40
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.867
So we've got, We've got positioner from,

41
00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:57.750
no, I might not have the right,
yeah, it looks good.

42
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.438
So by default, we will hide this window
because we don't wanna show it anymore.

43
00:03:02.438 --> 00:03:04.972
And we wanna make sure I don't have
that thing where it starts showing it

44
00:03:04.972 --> 00:03:05.900
for funzies.

45
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.932
Let's not ruin the surprise
of the Dev Tools as well, and

46
00:03:09.932 --> 00:03:12.370
we kinda have that piece in place.

47
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.001
I think I need this,
it's a class, Positioner.

48
00:03:25.318 --> 00:03:30.621
No, let's look in here and
find out what it is.

49
00:03:30.621 --> 00:03:34.556
It is a namespace, Electron Positioner,

50
00:03:34.556 --> 00:03:39.929
that is the default, so
that's just the default export.

51
00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:44.450
Cool, so we've got that in place, and

52
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.659
now what we wanna do is we go in here and
we say,

53
00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:58.517
positioner new Positioner for
that browser window, in this case.

54
00:03:58.517 --> 00:04:00.706
And we also need the tray position.

55
00:04:06.098 --> 00:04:08.549
No, I didn't ask for a capital letter.

56
00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.863
Which one would do, on this positioner?

57
00:04:11.863 --> 00:04:16.942
Yeah, you can see it's ruining
the surprise a little bit here.

58
00:04:16.942 --> 00:04:18.707
Actually, you can do
bottom right if you want.

59
00:04:18.707 --> 00:04:22.240
I want to calculate for
my points, I want the trayCenter.

60
00:04:25.447 --> 00:04:29.600
So basically, what this does is
it takes basically your window,

61
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.855
which it knows the bounds of,
to a certain extent.

62
00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:35.535
And it takes, in this case, the tray, and

63
00:04:35.535 --> 00:04:39.565
it will figure out how to kind of
change the x and y of that window.

64
00:04:39.565 --> 00:04:46.391
Why, IntelliSense, trayCenter.

65
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:50.559
I need it from the tray.getBounds.

66
00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:53.218
Sweet, and we've gotta make sure
we've declared that already.

67
00:04:53.218 --> 00:04:56.761
All right, so
positioner wraps a browser window and

68
00:04:56.761 --> 00:05:00.394
has the ability to manipulate
its location and size.

69
00:05:00.394 --> 00:05:06.145
So that we also then find where it should
be based on the center of our actual tray,

70
00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:10.730
which has a getBounds object,
which is an Electron rectangle.

71
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.494
It's doing the math for you, basically,
where's the tray, where's the window?

72
00:05:14.494 --> 00:05:19.472
Put the window by the center of the tray,
right?

73
00:05:19.472 --> 00:05:24.692
That's a lot of words out of my mouth
to do a relatively simple piece here.

74
00:05:24.692 --> 00:05:30.748
And then we just say browserWindow,
we can set the position,

75
00:05:30.748 --> 00:05:34.719
what's that last argument, animate?

76
00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:37.799
We're gonna keep that as false for
now, we might turn it to true so

77
00:05:37.799 --> 00:05:39.260
I can find out what that means.

78
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.959
I think you can watch it move,
it should be hidden as it happens.

79
00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:46.959
Cool, and then we can say tray.onClick.

80
00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:53.212
And so when that happens, all we really
wanna do at that point is we wanna say,

81
00:05:53.212 --> 00:06:00.295
there's no tray, cuz,
We'll return, that's fine.

82
00:06:03.945 --> 00:06:07.540
If the main window is visible,
then hide it, right?

83
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.400
Cuz we want it to toggle on and off.

84
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.463
And there's not a toggle, per se,
and you could write a function.

85
00:06:13.463 --> 00:06:22.940
If it's visible, hide it, otherwise,
Could else, I, as a general rule,

86
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.455
don't like else statements, but
I'll just return, I can't live like this.

87
00:06:28.455 --> 00:06:33.184
Return, cool, and then we can, basically,

88
00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:37.930
cuz the thing can move
based on where it moves.

89
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.861
So we've gotta move it again as well.

90
00:06:43.824 --> 00:06:45.779
I think we'll leave that there for
now, though.

91
00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:49.240
We'll do main window,
that should all be fine.

92
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.600
I don't think this is
gonna move in this case.

93
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.820
I'm gonna keep it here for a second.

94
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.382
I could choose to move this code down.

95
00:06:54.382 --> 00:06:55.536
I'm gonna just do a mainWindow.show.

96
00:06:59.618 --> 00:07:01.730
Or browserWindow.show.

97
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.779
All right, so this should,
when I click on it, show.

98
00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:06.479
There is one other thing,
it gets a little wonky,

99
00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:10.225
because there is a behavior we can
double click on things in Windows.

100
00:07:10.225 --> 00:07:15.330
I think technically Mac OS too,
so we're also just going to

101
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:21.520
say tray., IgnoreDoubleClickEvents,

102
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.450
otherwise, as you're trying to toggle
it on and off, it gets super weird.

103
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.107
But that's a thing you can do as well,
cuz you can listen to double-click events.

104
00:07:31.107 --> 00:07:40.392
No, we wanna, probably, let's choose to
move it, When we're about to show it.

105
00:07:43.686 --> 00:07:45.080
Cool, and let's try that.

106
00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:51.852
Look at that,
it feels like I got a menu bar out.

107
00:07:51.852 --> 00:07:56.914
It's nobody's business that I don't,
cuz it feels like it.

108
00:07:56.914 --> 00:07:59.348
And we saw before,
you can actually hide all of this as well.

109
00:07:59.348 --> 00:08:05.115
And hide that top bar as well, and
kind of do stuff along those lines,

110
00:08:05.115 --> 00:08:08.702
too, and kind of create a different feel.

111
00:08:08.702 --> 00:08:12.652
This app, I think you can actually
pull this off as well, and

112
00:08:12.652 --> 00:08:17.316
do stuff like that too, but you can
kinda get a little bit more nuanced.

113
00:08:17.316 --> 00:08:21.014
But you can actually have this
thing live in the menu bar,

114
00:08:21.014 --> 00:08:23.106
you could have it as something.

115
00:08:23.106 --> 00:08:26.330
You can kinda do some version where it
maybe appears as a normal window, or

116
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.750
have a menu,
stuff along those lines, yeah.

117
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:33.289
&gt;&gt; And because we can have multiple
different browser windows,

118
00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:38.540
we could have the intentional focus
version and the quick bar version?

119
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:42.611
&gt;&gt; Yep, right now, I've always
had this createWindow function,

120
00:08:42.611 --> 00:08:46.681
which is creating a window,
setting a known preload script, and

121
00:08:46.681 --> 00:08:49.287
then pointing it at a known index.html.

122
00:08:49.287 --> 00:08:53.843
You can have multiple HTML files, you can
have one for the menu bar icon, one for

123
00:08:53.843 --> 00:08:55.135
the full app, right?

124
00:08:55.135 --> 00:08:57.882
You can have them share
the same preloaded scripts, so

125
00:08:57.882 --> 00:08:59.741
they have access to the same things.

126
00:08:59.741 --> 00:09:01.157
Or maybe each one gets a different
set of things if you're being

127
00:09:01.157 --> 00:09:01.700
super secure, right?

128
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.234
You get a lot of flexibility in how
you wanna manage, navigate, and

129
00:09:05.234 --> 00:09:07.660
orchestrate all these windows as well,
yep.

130
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.072
And then theoretically,

131
00:09:09.072 --> 00:09:13.490
you could hold on to references to the
menu bar one as well as the main window.

132
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:17.703
And if something happens in one,
the main process kind of broker

133
00:09:17.703 --> 00:09:21.851
the communication to one of
the other windows as well, right?

134
00:09:21.851 --> 00:09:27.464
And so you can actually communicate
between them simultaneously too,

135
00:09:27.464 --> 00:09:28.500
but, yeah.

136
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.261
Awesome, so

137
00:09:29.261 --> 00:09:34.047
there's just one more slight thing we're
gonna talk about towards the end here.

138
00:09:34.047 --> 00:09:36.125
And we're gonna switch to one more app,

139
00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:40.223
which is just a super simple app that I'm
just mostly gonna take you on a tour of,

140
00:09:40.223 --> 00:09:42.623
which is about using native modules,
right?

141
00:09:42.623 --> 00:09:45.720
And just some of the tasting notes,
it's a little bit more,

142
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.740
we won't walk through it step by step.

143
00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.981
But just to kinda look at
what that looks like, and

144
00:09:50.981 --> 00:09:55.687
some of the nuances if you wanted to
have a SQLite database to persist data

145
00:09:55.687 --> 00:09:57.960
instead of just the file system.

146
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.941
It's a little bit more like, if you need
it kinda thing, so we won't go all the way

147
00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:05.497
in, but kind of just showing what
the different pieces around that too.
