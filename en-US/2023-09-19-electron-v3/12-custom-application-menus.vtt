1
00:00:00.387 --> 00:00:04.764
There's one last little
thing that we'll do here,

2
00:00:04.764 --> 00:00:11.129
just kinda show how it works, and
we'll visit this in other iterations is,

3
00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.414
out of the box,
you get a fairly okay menu, right?

4
00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:19.110
This does a lot of what you need it to do.

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.843
And in a lot of cases,
this might be all that you want.

6
00:00:23.843 --> 00:00:26.624
But if you want to build
your own application menu,

7
00:00:26.624 --> 00:00:29.480
like, if you look in VS code,
like, clearly.

8
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.257
They're not using the stock menu.

9
00:00:31.257 --> 00:00:36.690
If I go over to the GitHub app,
they are clearly not using the stock menu.

10
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.966
If you can also have full
control over the menu, and

11
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:44.945
the nice part is to no
one's particular shock,

12
00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:50.117
both it is relatively easy, but
you do have to do a little bit of

13
00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:55.101
massaging for the various OSs and
how you want it to behave.

14
00:00:55.101 --> 00:00:58.220
And so we can pull this in.

15
00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.615
There's another module called menu.

16
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.625
And menu's good for two things,
making an application menu as we've seen,

17
00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:13.260
and context menus, you also create custom
context menus when they right click and

18
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.197
stuff along those lines,
that is also an option as well.

19
00:01:17.197 --> 00:01:20.410
We will talk about the context
menus in a later section.

20
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.497
Let's look at the application menu
right now if you want to build your own

21
00:01:24.497 --> 00:01:25.639
application menu.

22
00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:31.138
I will say that that is something
that is a decision worth making

23
00:01:31.138 --> 00:01:36.329
because you get a relatively
good default application menu

24
00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.550
out of the box if you want to
have a custom application menu.

25
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.947
When I say you're kind of on your own,
that's not totally true as we'll see.

26
00:01:44.947 --> 00:01:50.040
There's a lot of like things to help you,
but you are somewhat on your own, right?

27
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.014
You are now responsible for
making an application menu.

28
00:01:53.014 --> 00:01:59.830
There are some niceties that we
will see as we go along though.

29
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.047
So menu.

30
00:02:01.047 --> 00:02:03.410
There's also a menu item class.

31
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.386
You can literally handcraft
a series of menu items and

32
00:02:07.386 --> 00:02:09.693
add them to the menu one by one.

33
00:02:09.693 --> 00:02:15.890
However, there is also
a relatively helpful tool.

34
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.590
If we do the menu,
there is a built from template, right,

35
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.574
which lets you use JavaScript niceties
like arrays and objects instead of like

36
00:02:24.574 --> 00:02:29.728
instantiating a butch of menu items one by
one with a certain number of arguments.

37
00:02:29.728 --> 00:02:33.546
You can pass an array of objects
as long as they adhere to

38
00:02:33.546 --> 00:02:38.526
the shape of a menu item It will then
build the menu out of that template.

39
00:02:38.526 --> 00:02:43.505
So generally speaking that is almost
always what you want unless you already

40
00:02:43.505 --> 00:02:47.704
have an existing menu that you're
trying to append stuff on to,

41
00:02:47.704 --> 00:02:49.431
stuff along those lines.

42
00:02:49.431 --> 00:02:53.530
So what we can do in this case
is we can say const template.

43
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.915
And I'm just gonna like
because I've got TypeScript.

44
00:02:57.915 --> 00:03:03.610
I'm gonna say that is an array of
menu constructor options, right?

45
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.559
If you're not using TypeScript then
you don't need to worry about that.

46
00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:10.179
But I'm just saying like, hey,
TypeScript, could you be a friend and

47
00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:12.874
as I'm working on this
if I make a boo boo,

48
00:03:12.874 --> 00:03:17.480
put a red squiggly line of anger that
lets me know that I made a boo boo.

49
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.214
So I don't have to embarrass myself
in front of my friends after I go and

50
00:03:21.214 --> 00:03:24.209
start up the app to find out
that my menu won't compile.

51
00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.600
So menu is an array.

52
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.003
If it's MacOS,
it's gonna be that menu bar along the top.

53
00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:33.028
If it's Windows or Linux,
you've seen it before,

54
00:03:33.028 --> 00:03:35.657
it's the one built into the window, right?

55
00:03:35.657 --> 00:03:38.495
It's an array,
the first is that top level set of menus.

56
00:03:38.495 --> 00:03:43.040
You can have sub menus, arguably,
to your heart's content.

57
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.971
I'm sure that there's a maximum depth
either enforced by the OS or electron.

58
00:03:46.971 --> 00:03:50.550
I have not personally sought to find it,
but

59
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.407
I assure that one can take sub
menus too far if one wanted to.

60
00:03:55.407 --> 00:04:00.437
So for instance let's say we wanna
just start with a file menu, so

61
00:04:00.437 --> 00:04:05.924
you put an object we can label it file and
then really there's initially

62
00:04:05.924 --> 00:04:10.788
like you could have, yeah,
you have a sub menu let's do that.

63
00:04:10.788 --> 00:04:15.440
And here we'll do a label of open, right?

64
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.510
And we got that in place and
we'll start there, right?

65
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.520
Actually, you know what we'll do click.

66
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.359
We're gonna say do that
show open dialogue.

67
00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:32.153
With this one,
we'll get the focused window in this case.

68
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.295
TypeScript's very upset,
like what if we don't have one?

69
00:04:38.295 --> 00:04:39.662
Okay, fine.

70
00:04:42.208 --> 00:04:45.210
And if there's no browser window.

71
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.088
We could literally call, create window
in this point and then point it there,

72
00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:50.754
which might be useful for Mac OS.

73
00:04:50.754 --> 00:04:54.940
So actually let's do that.

74
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.391
Let's be better people than we want to be.

75
00:04:57.391 --> 00:05:02.425
The one thing I need to check is,
does the create window

76
00:05:02.425 --> 00:05:08.014
that Electron Forge gave me out
of the box return the window.

77
00:05:09.014 --> 00:05:10.430
It does not.

78
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.229
This is a change I make every single
time if I'm using the template in there,

79
00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.829
which is sometimes I'd like that window.

80
00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:20.000
If thank you for making it,
I would like it, cool.

81
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.702
So then we'll say that browser window.

82
00:05:22.702 --> 00:05:29.900
If there's no browser window, then we'll
say, we can go get all the Windows.

83
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.425
Let's go create one.

84
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.278
Although, we'll get
the reference immediately.

85
00:05:42.278 --> 00:05:44.630
Cool, and then we'll pass
the browser window in there.

86
00:05:48.067 --> 00:05:52.320
Awesome, so if we have a browser window,
it'll get the focused one.

87
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.079
you could also, as you saw,
there was a get all windows.

88
00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:55.670
We can get the first one from the array.

89
00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:01.163
So I guess there's a world where the app
has a browser window that's not focused.

90
00:06:01.163 --> 00:06:05.102
Otherwise, I'm gonna say, if we don't have
one, just go ahead and create me one and

91
00:06:05.102 --> 00:06:06.120
show me it.

92
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.670
So what you would expect to see,
and this is gonna be where

93
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.760
we have fun time depending
on what OS you're using,

94
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.850
but generally speaking,
we'll have a little bit of

95
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:28.235
a different outcome depending
on what OS you're using, right?

96
00:06:28.235 --> 00:06:32.722
And so for
my friends who are using Windows or

97
00:06:32.722 --> 00:06:36.750
Linux, everything's gonna go great.

98
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.689
Everything's gonna be amazing.

99
00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:42.180
I'm gonna wait for the app.

100
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.086
Do we need for the app to be ready?

101
00:06:43.086 --> 00:06:44.680
I don't know, we'll find out together.

102
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.130
I think I don't need to wait for
the app to be ready.

103
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.660
But we'll say menu, setApplicationMenu to the
one that we just made from the template.

104
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.476
And so what you expect to see is
a file menu with an open, right?

105
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.770
And if you are on Windows or
Linux that is what you see.

106
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.470
And if you are on Mac OS you don't.

107
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.785
Because Mac OS the size of the first
menu is always the name of the app.

108
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.880
Right?
So you end up with a does the thing that

109
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.813
you expect it is the correct thing under
the hood it should be called file but

110
00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:23.434
Mac OS has a slightly odd behavior
where it expects that the first one is

111
00:07:23.434 --> 00:07:27.530
named after the app regardless
of what you've named it.

112
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:32.421
So that is one tiny thing that you need
to do, which is, if process platform is

113
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:36.640
Darwin and you could theoretically
make a function called is Mac,

114
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.116
which just does that for you if you
never wanna think about that again.

115
00:07:41.116 --> 00:07:46.010
You do the template and then you unshift.

116
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.738
Unshift, which is yeah,
no pop quiz on this one unshift,

117
00:07:50.738 --> 00:07:53.298
put something on the front of the array,

118
00:07:53.298 --> 00:07:57.310
something you'd never wanted
to do until like today, right?

119
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.474
And so we have the app name.

120
00:07:58.474 --> 00:08:00.640
We'll start with that for now.

121
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.400
And we'll get that in place.

122
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:10.548
Cool, so now we've got that Mac OS
specific tweak there, template.

123
00:08:10.548 --> 00:08:15.258
Cuz turns out the order in which
you modify arrays is important.

124
00:08:15.258 --> 00:08:18.690
If you use the array and
then mutate it, it didn't matter.

125
00:08:20.364 --> 00:08:24.740
Awesome, so we've got file,
we've got electron, there's no menu there.

126
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:30.448
But a fun fact is I can't copy that.

127
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.406
I can't copy any text in here.

128
00:08:36.406 --> 00:08:37.770
Why?

129
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.934
&gt;&gt; Because we haven't
told it how hotkeys work.

130
00:08:39.934 --> 00:08:41.130
&gt;&gt; I don't have a copy.

131
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.110
I don't have an edit menu anymore.

132
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.360
That has Command C.

133
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.437
So I can't copy.

134
00:08:47.437 --> 00:08:48.920
I can't paste.

135
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.100
I can't select all.

136
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:56.710
I can't do anything, because all of
those menu items are gone, right?
