00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.432
What's really cool is like think about
combining the two apps that we did

2
00:00:03.432 --> 00:00:04.115
previously.

3
00:00:04.115 --> 00:00:08.247
Let's say you had a file and you wanted to
do something where it's like reading from

4
00:00:08.247 --> 00:00:12.160
a file maybe parsing it and adding certain
things in at various like dominoes.

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.493
There's a whole bunch of ways
that you can like any given one

6
00:00:15.493 --> 00:00:17.568
of these things kinda cool, right?

7
00:00:17.568 --> 00:00:22.526
I think what is cooler is okay, what are
the if I could read from the file system,

8
00:00:22.526 --> 00:00:24.820
if I could pull system information,

9
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.400
if I had logs that are writing
to standard out, right?

10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.127
Could I grab that stream in node and
then build a UI on top of that,

11
00:00:33.127 --> 00:00:37.750
that allowed me to search and
manipulate those logs, right?

12
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.530
The interesting part always is not
any given one of the very tractable,

13
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.003
reasonable things that your approach but
it's the like, okay, what is the bespoke

14
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:49.730
use case where some app doesn't exist
at my job or in my hobby, right?

15
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.921
Like the other day we were doing
one with Arduinos and Johnny-Five,

16
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:55.900
like one could theoretically
build a Johnny-Five ui, right?

17
00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.048
And turn the LEDs on and off from here and
control the board directly.

18
00:01:00.048 --> 00:01:02.761
All of those things become possible.

19
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:08.250
So my challenge to you is if
we go into the code here.

20
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.895
In application.tsx clipping has an on
remove, but it also has an on copy,

21
00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:16.970
which is what like I'll give you
a hint when that gets triggered.

22
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.490
It's when somebody clicks that button,
right?

23
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.350
Could we take that, we already are wired
up some of the writing to the clipboard.

24
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.009
Could we just like, again, complete
the loop and get that piece in place?

25
00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.341
And then we've got kind of like, we can
kinda then do some other cool things with

26
00:01:33.341 --> 00:01:36.127
this app that involve like the OSS
integration, but let's like,

27
00:01:36.127 --> 00:01:37.839
at least we can copy from the clipboard.

28
00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:41.463
This app kinda stinks if
we can't do the opposite,

29
00:01:41.463 --> 00:01:46.680
awesome Cool, cool, cool.

30
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.260
So I guess the other part is
writing to the clipboard,

31
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.470
where ideally we should be
able to just do on copy.

32
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.080
Let's look at the actual
implementation here, as I remember.

33
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.200
So button on click we, yeah, whatever
the copy is, we passed the value in,

34
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.200
which should work for
my writing to the clipboard, right.

35
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.447
Cool.
So we will go ahead and

36
00:02:18.447 --> 00:02:24.640
try that out we'll say, on copy we'll
do window.api.writetoclipboard.

37
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.100
And now, if the world likes me,
I shouldn't even need to change anything.

38
00:02:35.587 --> 00:02:41.137
Is a hotdog a really a form of taco?

39
00:02:41.137 --> 00:02:45.863
Now, I should be able
to copy this clipboard.

40
00:02:45.863 --> 00:02:52.279
Yes, I can now save important things that
I need to reuse over and over again.

41
00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:53.900
2020 hindsight.

42
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.200
You know what this app would be
really good for, saving dank memes.

43
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.622
All right, that you need available to copy
to the clipboard at a moment's notice.

44
00:03:03.622 --> 00:03:06.100
I think that's maybe what I
should have done with this.

45
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.418
And then you maybe save
it to the file system so

46
00:03:08.418 --> 00:03:11.838
then you know exactly where to get them,
and you can see it as well.
