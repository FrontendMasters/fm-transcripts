00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.243
So you might be thinking to yourself,

2
00:00:02.243 --> 00:00:05.830
I can't even quit this application
from the menu right now.

3
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.239
Cmd+Q doesn't do anything, right?

4
00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:11.325
Cmd+W, nothing does anything, right?

5
00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:14.709
I didn't put an accelerator on here,
so nothing works.

6
00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:20.520
So you're like, well, I guess I have
to build this menu from scratch?

7
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.541
Ish, it's kind of nice if you
don't want the ability to copy,

8
00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:27.418
which if you're one of those monsters,
y'all ever use a website where you go try

9
00:00:27.418 --> 00:00:30.860
to copy something and they disable
your ability to copy something?

10
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.516
So then you have to go into the Chrome
Dev Tools and put it back, right?

11
00:00:34.516 --> 00:00:37.876
Yeah, where there's a will, there's a way.

12
00:00:37.876 --> 00:00:42.723
I guess if you wanted to get rid
of certain things, that's doable.

13
00:00:42.723 --> 00:00:47.640
So you would think that your job is now to

14
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.522
re-put everything in there.

15
00:00:51.522 --> 00:00:54.766
The nice part is that Electron's
got your back in this case.

16
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:59.391
It has a list of things
that we'll call menu roles,

17
00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:06.612
which can better be described as things
that you probably wanted to do, right?

18
00:01:06.612 --> 00:01:10.330
So I will do one and then I will give
you a minute to try out another one,

19
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.780
which is for that application menu, right?

20
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.150
If I go to it now, it's a very cool menu.

21
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.250
But if I said role is appMenu,
which is like,

22
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.217
hey, I have this menu, It's roughly an app

23
00:01:26.217 --> 00:01:31.185
menu now I get At least
the ability to quit and

24
00:01:31.185 --> 00:01:38.730
the like MacOS accoutrements that
you would find in here, right?

25
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.040
Don't have the ability to copy and
paste, right?

26
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.818
So take about two or three minutes just to
do a little quick exploration I will push

27
00:01:44.818 --> 00:01:46.270
up this branch as well.

28
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.860
Can you get us back in and
you edit menu please.

29
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.290
Right on, so
we can kinda acquiesce a little bit.

30
00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.210
If we've shifted up this label
appName with the appMenu,

31
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.010
one would hope that, theoretically,
the label, we can call it Edit,

32
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.621
and the nice part is you can
call it whatever you want.

33
00:02:08.621 --> 00:02:13.481
We can give it the role of editMenu,

34
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:18.347
but I also will show you real quick.

35
00:02:18.347 --> 00:02:19.536
With TypeScript,

36
00:02:19.536 --> 00:02:24.450
we have a bunch of, you can pull in the
full fileMenu that you had to begin with.

37
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.570
You pull in a whole editMenu, the app
menu that we saw before, a help menu.

38
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.310
There are also very specific like,
I just want paste, or just paste and

39
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.350
match style, or just quit, or
something along those lines.

40
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.285
So you can do an entire menu,
cuz honestly, some of these,

41
00:02:42.285 --> 00:02:47.030
like remove from recent documents,
how will you really gonna do that?

42
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.660
But a lot of these,
you can see that there's a whole bunch.

43
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.950
If you want to have undo,
so on and so forth.

44
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.496
And so you can kind of like,
yes, you're on the hook for

45
00:02:56.496 --> 00:03:00.735
creating your own application menu
if we replace the default one.

46
00:03:00.735 --> 00:03:04.651
But all the component pieces
are still lying around for

47
00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:08.670
you, with all of the native
OS functionality built in.

48
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.692
So for us if we just did editMenu,

49
00:03:10.692 --> 00:03:14.030
we will theoretically get
an Edit menu in place there.

50
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.593
And now if we go over to my awesome
application, the ability, I can't pull up

51
00:03:21.593 --> 00:03:26.495
the Dev Tools after I close them anymore
because I've gotten rid of that menu.

52
00:03:26.495 --> 00:03:29.693
And that's what we were
talking about earlier,

53
00:03:29.693 --> 00:03:31.959
but the default Edit menu is back.

54
00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.890
My File menu, it'd be great if I
could do Cmd+O here or Ctrl+O,

55
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.190
depending on the OS, and
I'll show you how to do that.

56
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.123
And then we'll probably leave this
one where it is for a little bit,

57
00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:45.820
cuz I think we've made
our point in this case.

58
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.875
So the one final tweak is
adding a keyboard shortcut or,

59
00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:52.140
in Electron terms,
an accelerator, to a menu item.

60
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.380
And that is super easy to do,
we simply type accelerator.

61
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.684
And you can kinda see, you kind of give
a string that means what it should be.

62
00:03:59.684 --> 00:04:03.428
And you can do Cmd+O, you can do Ctrl+O,

63
00:04:03.428 --> 00:04:07.276
but as anyone who has
used both a Windows PC or

64
00:04:07.276 --> 00:04:13.220
Linux PC as well as a Mac knows that
it is Ctrl on Windows and Linux.

65
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.654
It is Cmd on macOS, and
you could write a whole bunch of processes

66
00:04:16.654 --> 00:04:20.100
if that platform is Darwin, and
think about all that yourself.

67
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.062
Or you can simply write this and
Electron, under the hood,

68
00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:27.220
will figure out what it was supposed to be
for that OS, and it will make total sense.

69
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.258
So we can save that.

70
00:04:29.258 --> 00:04:30.978
And you can do this for
anything in your application.

71
00:04:30.978 --> 00:04:35.250
All those IPC calls that we said back and
forth, right?

72
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.879
You can simply call them, I mean,
that's why we kinda broke them up.

73
00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:42.393
You can go ahead, you can get any of
those and call any of them from menu,

74
00:04:42.393 --> 00:04:44.970
give them a different accelerator.

75
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.412
You can do any keystroke you want to do,

76
00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:52.370
any of the functionality that we had in
there, and it will all just kind of work.

77
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.686
But just to kind of verify that
in terms of our application, so

78
00:04:56.686 --> 00:05:01.650
now it's got Cmd+O, as you can see,
and I can hit that.

79
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.189
And I get the window, and now I can open.

80
00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:09.080
So we're getting dangerously close,
in a relatively short amount of time,

81
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.256
considering the amount of talking I did,
right?

82
00:05:12.256 --> 00:05:15.199
Dangerously close to what
is starting to feel and

83
00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.229
behave like a full desktop application,
right?

84
00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.519
And I won't lie to you, some of this is
like the 80-20 principle here, right?

85
00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:26.239
Like all the little tweaks are,
where a part of this is super important.

86
00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:31.695
But like I said, all things said and
done, relatively fast for the amount

87
00:05:31.695 --> 00:05:37.249
that we have, for as close as we've
gotten to a full desktop application.
