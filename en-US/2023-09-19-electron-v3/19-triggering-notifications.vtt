1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.438
In term, I'm trying to think of,
there are some other niceties.

2
00:00:03.438 --> 00:00:10.995
Some of them are cool, but there's
the ability to trigger notifications,

3
00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:17.031
right, which I think it is
the exact same API as the browser.

4
00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:18.635
And last time when we did this,

5
00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:22.894
it was cool because it was really hard to
trigger notifications from the browser or

6
00:00:22.894 --> 00:00:26.680
it wasn't widely supported like when
we did this four or five years ago.

7
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.173
Now it's new notification and
you can send it.

8
00:00:30.173 --> 00:00:33.005
It's very much the same API in the browser
but you can also do it from Node,

9
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:33.833
which is super cool.

10
00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:40.905
So now you can you can pull in,
You can say notification.

11
00:00:40.905 --> 00:00:45.938
Again, this is the main process,
so this is on the Node side.

12
00:00:45.938 --> 00:00:51.165
You can theoretically trigger notification
from the browser from your nodes.

13
00:00:51.165 --> 00:00:54.413
So if you had a long running process
of like, hey, go save this thing.

14
00:00:54.413 --> 00:00:59.074
Or I kicked off downloading a bunch of
Docker containers that are happening in

15
00:00:59.074 --> 00:01:02.229
the main process,
maybe away from the browser, but

16
00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:06.551
you could still trigger the notification
right from the node context.

17
00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:11.912
So for instance, we can,
let's do another global shortcut.

18
00:01:11.912 --> 00:01:15.614
Let's call this one, what do I do?

19
00:01:15.614 --> 00:01:21.279
I wanna say,
let's read from the clipboard,

20
00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:25.791
trying to think what I wanna do here.

21
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:34.946
And what we're gonna do is,
Let's see, let's do x.

22
00:01:34.946 --> 00:01:39.368
We're just gonna try to, you could
theoretically have scripts that, if it's

23
00:01:39.368 --> 00:01:43.666
markdown, turn it into HTML just to bring
everything together in my clipboard and

24
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:46.058
then write it back to the clipboard,
right?

25
00:01:46.058 --> 00:01:49.105
Or if you had image processing, you're
like, I have something in my clipboard,

26
00:01:49.105 --> 00:01:50.249
I wanna resize it to this thing.

27
00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:54.133
And then you could theoretically register
a shortcut without even really much of

28
00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:55.515
a UI to speak of whatsoever.

29
00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:59.319
And we'll talk about other ways if you
don't feel like this app needs a whole

30
00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.705
bunch of UI, but
you want some of these things.

31
00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:05.363
You could do any of this stuff and
you could theoretically like,

32
00:02:05.363 --> 00:02:07.271
we'll say content is readText.

33
00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:13.154
And that was a content = toUpperCase,

34
00:02:13.154 --> 00:02:16.012
yeah, whatever.

35
00:02:16.012 --> 00:02:16.847
It doesn't really matter.

36
00:02:16.847 --> 00:02:21.374
The point is that you could theoretically
have like all sorts of different processes

37
00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:24.833
or maybe just UI agnostic that
are happening in the background.

38
00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:26.994
And then you could say,
we're gonna write it.

39
00:02:26.994 --> 00:02:28.483
And then we do new notification.

40
00:02:32.297 --> 00:02:38.999
Yeah, we'll do that eventually, dot show,
and we'll say that the title is,

41
00:02:40.863 --> 00:02:44.907
Capitalized Clipboard Content.

42
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.643
Do I want body in this case?

43
00:02:49.643 --> 00:02:52.568
I can't remember if it's body or subtitle.

44
00:02:52.568 --> 00:02:54.038
I think it depends a little on the OSes.

45
00:02:54.038 --> 00:02:57.732
I think, on Mac OS,
you only get two things.

46
00:02:57.732 --> 00:03:03.237
Let's also put in a subtitle.

47
00:03:03.237 --> 00:03:07.619
I forgot, now, I will tell you cuz I've
done this enough times in my life.

48
00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:11.720
I know that I'm not gonna see the
notification because I'm presenting, and

49
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.322
Mac OS automatically
silences notifications.

50
00:03:14.322 --> 00:03:18.912
I know this cuz in 2017 one time we had
an hour where I was debugging code to

51
00:03:18.912 --> 00:03:21.805
realize that my notifications
was just muted.

52
00:03:21.805 --> 00:03:25.140
I will just say that in case you were
somebody who has your notifications muted

53
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.587
right now and you do not see this.

54
00:03:26.587 --> 00:03:31.225
Just learn from six years ago me and
some of the mistakes that I have made.

55
00:03:31.225 --> 00:03:33.761
So this is now
CommandOrControl+Shift+Alt+x.

56
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:36.424
That's a lot, but we'll go with it.

57
00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:40.049
And I don't think that's registered
to anything else right now, but

58
00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:40.979
we'll find out.

59
00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.213
So I'm gonna grab this right here.

60
00:03:43.213 --> 00:03:46.446
We'll copy it and then we should be able.

61
00:03:46.446 --> 00:03:50.746
And I should see, yeah, yeah,
we have a body and a subtitle,

62
00:03:50.746 --> 00:03:52.827
you can do all of them in macOS.

63
00:03:52.827 --> 00:03:55.896
And yeah, so
you can trigger notifications,

64
00:03:55.896 --> 00:03:59.997
even from things that have no
UI process whatsoever, right?

65
00:03:59.997 --> 00:04:05.485
And all of that kind of in place as well,
which is, I think, super cool.

66
00:04:05.485 --> 00:04:08.568
These OS integrations become, I think,
even if you feel like or you're like,

67
00:04:08.568 --> 00:04:11.098
I [INAUDIBLE] need to make an app but
maybe I have scripts with things

68
00:04:11.098 --> 00:04:13.536
that I'm doing that could benefit
from some of these things and

69
00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:15.212
the ability to have all this integration.

70
00:04:15.212 --> 00:04:18.366
Or I just needed some convenience
tools for my day to day job.

71
00:04:18.366 --> 00:04:23.649
You can whip this stuff up super
quickly and use it in your day to day.

72
00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:27.362
So we did notifications,
we did keyboard shortcuts.

73
00:04:28.548 --> 00:04:31.961
Let's see,
what else do we wanna talk about?

74
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:34.507
You know what would be kinda cool?

75
00:04:34.507 --> 00:04:38.698
It'd be kinda cool if I could
put it up here, right, and

76
00:04:38.698 --> 00:04:44.516
have that instead of having a full app and
maybe just click up here and have it.

77
00:04:44.516 --> 00:04:47.029
I feel like an app like this,
it makes sense, right?

78
00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:51.040
And then you could add up all the keyboard
shortcuts and stuff along those lines.

79
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.293
I feel like that's a good experience.

80
00:04:54.293 --> 00:04:54.934
So let's do that.

81
00:04:54.934 --> 00:04:56.768
Let's make it a, either menu bar or
a system tray icon.

82
00:04:56.768 --> 00:04:57.467
Yeah.

83
00:04:57.467 --> 00:05:01.968
&gt;&gt; So, we've got global shortcuts for
wherever you are and

84
00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.985
we've got accelerated menu things.

85
00:05:04.985 --> 00:05:10.071
Does a hotkey inside the application,
it's only registered

86
00:05:10.071 --> 00:05:15.466
in the application, have to be
also a menu accelerated command?

87
00:05:15.466 --> 00:05:17.953
&gt;&gt; I think so.

88
00:05:17.953 --> 00:05:25.541
I think that it's actually possibly true
for like at least macOS writ large, right?

89
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:30.898
Insofar that a fun fact, I will just say
this rather than give you a full tour.

90
00:05:30.898 --> 00:05:34.103
In macOS, for instance,
you can actually, any app,

91
00:05:34.103 --> 00:05:38.298
you can give anything a hotkey if
it doesn't already have one, right?

92
00:05:38.298 --> 00:05:43.135
And so I think that the hockey
are bound to menu items in macOS,

93
00:05:43.135 --> 00:05:47.988
barring some browser ability
to also listen for keystrokes.

94
00:05:47.988 --> 00:05:50.366
Cuz as you know, you can like do
certain keystrokes in web apps as well.

95
00:05:50.366 --> 00:05:55.223
So obviously, what you can do in the
browser, aside from all OS integration,

96
00:05:55.223 --> 00:05:56.775
probably still counts.

97
00:05:56.775 --> 00:06:01.335
But I think for the most part,
in terms of the OS level kind of stuff,

98
00:06:01.335 --> 00:06:05.984
I do think, at least in macOS,
has to be bound to a menu item, right?

99
00:06:05.984 --> 00:06:09.177
Now obviously you can listen for
key up and key down in the browser and

100
00:06:09.177 --> 00:06:10.643
get the correct combination.

101
00:06:10.643 --> 00:06:14.026
There are libraries that will multiplex
all of that and put it together.

102
00:06:14.026 --> 00:06:15.396
So yes, ish.

103
00:06:15.396 --> 00:06:18.439
But for the electron part,
which is, you know,

104
00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:22.532
the part I feel most qualified to
answer right now, that is true.

105
00:06:22.532 --> 00:06:27.394
Obviously with asterisks that there's
dark ways to do that kinda stuff.

106
00:06:27.394 --> 00:06:31.985
&gt;&gt; I'd forgotten about
all the browser keystroke

107
00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:33.595
listening-
&gt;&gt; Yah,

108
00:06:33.595 --> 00:06:35.927
those are also available to you as well.

109
00:06:35.927 --> 00:06:41.001
These are cool because for that, I didn't
even need the UI to be open, right?

110
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:45.045
That was just a node process that can
now do it running in the background,

111
00:06:45.045 --> 00:06:46.318
which is kind of cool.

112
00:06:46.318 --> 00:06:50.494
For those who I think get either needs
to be registered as a global shortcut or

113
00:06:50.494 --> 00:06:53.183
it needs to be bound to
a menu item as far as I know.
