1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.746
So now, we have the organizational
problem of, well, where are we gonna go?

2
00:00:03.746 --> 00:00:04.697
Do we go to Amazon?

3
00:00:04.697 --> 00:00:05.586
Do we go to Google?

4
00:00:05.586 --> 00:00:06.963
Ao we go to Azure, right?

5
00:00:06.963 --> 00:00:11.420
Or do we use something else like
some kind of boutique solution or

6
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.995
something like that.

7
00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:15.935
Developer problems
[LAUGH] I love this GIF.

8
00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:19.191
It made me feel so yeah,
I've gone through this quite a bit.

9
00:00:19.191 --> 00:00:20.291
What do I do?

10
00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:24.228
And this is this is pretty common with
developers to be honest with you.

11
00:00:24.228 --> 00:00:27.340
More often than not, there's two things.

12
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.923
Whenever a developer says like,
what do I do?

13
00:00:28.923 --> 00:00:29.968
I do what's going on?

14
00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:33.990
One it probably means a developer
hasn't been educated well enough.

15
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.304
And I don't mean technical?

16
00:00:35.304 --> 00:00:40.040
[LAUGH] I mean, they don't know
the specific internal knowledge, right?

17
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.383
Maybe they don't know how
to do deployments, right?

18
00:00:42.383 --> 00:00:45.895
Maybe they don't know how
to do configurations and

19
00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:48.680
their deployment just failed, right?

20
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.360
What do I do?

21
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.122
What do I do, right?

22
00:00:50.122 --> 00:00:55.030
These are the developer problems that
we actually deal with quite often.

23
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.992
So, when we look at developer problems,

24
00:00:56.992 --> 00:01:00.926
you're immediately gonna see a massive
shift and their perspective versus ours.

25
00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:04.570
[LAUGH] Source control, right?

26
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.380
Somebody gets hired into a company,
how do I edit my code, right?

27
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.360
How do we do it securely?

28
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.231
Service management?

29
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:14.310
How do I create my services, right?

30
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.265
How do I manage my services?

31
00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:18.228
Continuous integration, right?

32
00:01:18.228 --> 00:01:21.287
How do I make sure that
my code changes are okay.

33
00:01:21.287 --> 00:01:23.942
And then finally,
continuous delivery, right?

34
00:01:23.942 --> 00:01:28.684
Now, at the bottom, I note that
developers only deal with code and

35
00:01:28.684 --> 00:01:30.810
mechanisms to deploying it.

36
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.640
I really think that this is something
that every company should follow.

37
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.581
Why?

38
00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:38.490
Because that's all they care about.

39
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.210
[LAUGH] In all honesty, a dev does not
really care about why logs aren't working.

40
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.734
They don't really know, potentially,
why or even how that may have happened.

41
00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:54.411
And it can create tendencies of,
I don't wanna say conflict but

42
00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:59.347
miscommunication or it's like no,
I'm just trying to help you but

43
00:01:59.347 --> 00:02:05.148
what's really happening is you're dealing
with a pain point in our systems and

44
00:02:05.148 --> 00:02:07.592
I have to help you out of this now.

45
00:02:07.592 --> 00:02:10.062
If you have circumstances like that,

46
00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:14.615
where you find yourself where
developers rely on you to move forward,

47
00:02:14.615 --> 00:02:19.489
that is a developer problem, and
that's something that should be fixed.

48
00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.594
So when we talk about source control,
right.

49
00:02:21.594 --> 00:02:23.702
What are we talking about
that developers care about?

50
00:02:23.702 --> 00:02:26.070
Well, developers wanna know
how to access repos, right.

51
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.180
They wanna know how to get to their repos.

52
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.475
Branch protections and policies.

53
00:02:30.475 --> 00:02:32.594
Again, massively important.

54
00:02:32.594 --> 00:02:34.941
Developers will just merge things.

55
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:37.310
[LAUGH] They do not care.

56
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.437
And that's not to be rude, but it's simply
because we've gotten to a point now where

57
00:02:41.437 --> 00:02:44.720
there's expectations within
the developer experience, right?

58
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.264
Developers expect to see status checks,
and if it's not there, then they just go,

59
00:02:49.264 --> 00:02:51.701
okay, well [LAUGH] It didn't say it,
right?

60
00:02:51.701 --> 00:02:58.369
So having branch protections, do not
let anyone push to main, lock it down.

61
00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:01.590
You can't even, you should not
even be able to push to main.

62
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.228
As a matter of fact, and
this is how crazy I am,

63
00:03:04.228 --> 00:03:07.087
I can't even push to main
in my own private repos.

64
00:03:07.087 --> 00:03:12.798
[LAUGH] Because in the off chance that
I do, I could break something in prom.

65
00:03:12.798 --> 00:03:16.397
And when I'm doing my own personal
projects or I'm working on stream and

66
00:03:16.397 --> 00:03:20.233
stuff like that, it still means that I
wanna make sure everything's working

67
00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:21.602
fine and things like that.

68
00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:26.480
And yeah, if you accidentally push
to main or force push or whatever,

69
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.869
it's just so
hard to know what's gonna happen,

70
00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:34.762
unless you really understand
the changes that you're about to make.

71
00:03:34.762 --> 00:03:37.718
Having integration before that
that can run before that,

72
00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:39.659
check everything is really crucial.

73
00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:44.626
If you're at a company right now that
lets you push to main, that has to stop.

74
00:03:44.626 --> 00:03:46.782
[LAUGH] That has to stop.

75
00:03:46.782 --> 00:03:51.358
Developers must have standardized
procedures to manage code efficiently.

76
00:03:51.358 --> 00:03:53.599
You have to create those procedures.

77
00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.451
Then part of that process is gonna
be figuring out what they like.

78
00:03:57.451 --> 00:04:00.628
[LAUGH] Because sometimes
the procedures that you make

79
00:04:00.628 --> 00:04:03.387
aren't necessarily
the ones that they like.

80
00:04:03.387 --> 00:04:08.240
Sometimes you have to keep those
procedures, sometimes they can be changed.

81
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.940
But part of working through these
problems especially is to work together.

82
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.730
Like seriously it really is.

83
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.670
Service management,
now this is interesting.

84
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.030
A few of you might even look at this and
be like, wait,

85
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.584
why are developers managing services?

86
00:04:24.584 --> 00:04:26.214
What does that mean?

87
00:04:26.214 --> 00:04:29.938
Well, when we think about what
do developers care about,

88
00:04:29.938 --> 00:04:32.753
they do care about configuration, right?

89
00:04:32.753 --> 00:04:37.496
They do care about what their
environment is, the current state of it.

90
00:04:37.496 --> 00:04:38.526
Yeah.

91
00:04:38.526 --> 00:04:40.972
&gt;&gt; Just a general question.

92
00:04:40.972 --> 00:04:41.536
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

93
00:04:41.536 --> 00:04:44.990
&gt;&gt; How do you suggest you deal
with a hot fix emergency?

94
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.544
Usually an argument for
leaving backdoors on the main branch?

95
00:04:48.544 --> 00:04:52.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't do it, don't do it.

96
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.174
My job is a lot about telling people no.

97
00:04:57.174 --> 00:05:01.816
If you are at an organization
where you do not feel like you can

98
00:05:01.816 --> 00:05:06.366
express as a what you're being paid to do,
which is, hey,

99
00:05:06.366 --> 00:05:11.462
we need to make sure that we do this
in a way that's safely secure and

100
00:05:11.462 --> 00:05:17.488
it can be a fire, but like understand
that with fires, we put them out as fire.

101
00:05:17.488 --> 00:05:23.004
Yeah, fire like brigade,
not as just like, don't do that.

102
00:05:23.004 --> 00:05:26.990
So there still has to be policy and
practices even in that process.

103
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.526
So, basically you just tell them,
okay, just take a deep breath.

104
00:05:30.526 --> 00:05:35.235
[LAUGH] So open up the PR and
let's figure this out, and

105
00:05:35.235 --> 00:05:40.792
if that process takes a long time,
that's a problem, right?

106
00:05:40.792 --> 00:05:43.375
If you're hot fixes take
like three hours to do,

107
00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:47.344
then the thing you guys are really arguing
about is that it takes three hours

108
00:05:47.344 --> 00:05:50.940
to do a hot fix not that like which
approach is better or not, right?

109
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.881
And that's another part of determining
what's the actual problem, right?

110
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:56.826
When you get into
an argument with somebody,

111
00:05:56.826 --> 00:05:59.755
it's very easy to get distracted
by what you two are talking about.

112
00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:04.311
But the reality of it is it might not even
be the problem that you guys are trying to

113
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:05.338
actually solve.

114
00:06:05.338 --> 00:06:09.878
So really determining why are we
feeling the way we're feeling right

115
00:06:09.878 --> 00:06:13.720
now is actually pretty important
to solving the problem.

116
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.159
So yeah, don't do it and
reevaluate your practices so

117
00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:20.990
that those things don't become
as difficult in the future.
