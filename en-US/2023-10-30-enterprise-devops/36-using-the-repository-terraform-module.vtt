WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.856
So we have our workspace set up but
there's a difference between these two.

2
00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:09.803
And you can kind of tell by
just looking at it, right?

3
00:00:09.803 --> 00:00:13.556
One says like applied check
whereas the other one has nothing.

4
00:00:13.556 --> 00:00:16.375
Well, that's because we set up
the workspace to be local, right?

5
00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:20.828
This is again the one chicken before
the egg scenario where we kind of have

6
00:00:20.828 --> 00:00:24.406
to initialize state before we
can actually have it track.

7
00:00:24.406 --> 00:00:28.874
And that's because Terraform
doesn't know what the repo is yet.

8
00:00:28.874 --> 00:00:31.735
We haven't added that to state yet, right?

9
00:00:31.735 --> 00:00:33.910
We wanna do that next.

10
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.764
So now what we wanna do is we wanna
clone after we've created our workspace,

11
00:00:37.764 --> 00:00:41.459
we wanna clone our second repository,
which is our GitHub repository.

12
00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:46.911
I'm gonna say, gh pr clone for

13
00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:50.274
me github, cool.

14
00:00:50.274 --> 00:00:55.195
Okay, so now I have two automation
repositories a GitHub repository and

15
00:00:55.195 --> 00:00:56.493
a tfe repository.

16
00:00:56.493 --> 00:00:59.867
So now I'm gonna go into my
GitHub repository, right?

17
00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:03.339
And we're gonna start automating again.

18
00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:04.816
So in this scenario,

19
00:01:04.816 --> 00:01:09.256
we're gonna start directly out
of the box with configuration.

20
00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:11.920
We now know we like configuring things,
right?

21
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.283
And we now know that's
a convention we wanna keep.

22
00:01:14.283 --> 00:01:17.220
So let's create a new
file called locals.tf.

23
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.991
This is a pattern that we're gonna do and
keep doing, right?

24
00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:25.608
Now you guys know that we can do this,
right?

25
00:01:25.608 --> 00:01:26.480
You guys are aware of that.

26
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.035
And I asked you last time,
what do you think the names of

27
00:01:30.035 --> 00:01:33.298
the resources that we needed
to put in there were?

28
00:01:33.298 --> 00:01:36.605
Right, so now we're in
the GitHub Automation Repository.

29
00:01:36.605 --> 00:01:39.275
What do you think the names
are we need to put in here?

30
00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:42.979
&gt;&gt; It gonna depend on the
&gt;&gt; Repo names.

31
00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.192
&gt;&gt; Repo names, exactly.

32
00:01:44.192 --> 00:01:47.304
Repo names because that's
what we wanna iterate over.

33
00:01:47.304 --> 00:01:51.270
We wanna just make configurations for
all of our repos to start.

34
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.254
What I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna be very straightforward and

35
00:01:55.254 --> 00:01:59.038
I'm gonna create a variable
inside of locals called repos.

36
00:01:59.038 --> 00:02:04.456
And that map now has two repos
inside of it eci-terraform-tfe and

37
00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:06.789
eci-terraform-github.

38
00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.188
Now you might be like, hey Eric,
how are you gonna do that?

39
00:02:11.188 --> 00:02:13.320
They already exist.

40
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.830
Here's the last chicken
before the egg scenario.

41
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.893
These are our sources of truth, right?

42
00:02:19.893 --> 00:02:21.818
But so is Terraform.

43
00:02:21.818 --> 00:02:25.313
But Terraform depends on GitHub, right?

44
00:02:25.313 --> 00:02:30.084
So the path I just showed you was
the path of least resistance which is

45
00:02:30.084 --> 00:02:34.283
something must exist before we
can create the other thing.

46
00:02:34.283 --> 00:02:38.699
So we do Terraform repo first
to create Terraform Cloud.

47
00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:40.990
Sync, cool you're now in sync.

48
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.460
Okay, now that this is in sync go
over here and create the workspace.

49
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.726
Cool, okay awesome.

50
00:02:46.726 --> 00:02:49.700
But this workspace has nothing
to synchronize with yet, right?

51
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.160
So now manually create the repository.

52
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.440
Okay, cool but these two aren't
synced with these two yet, right?

53
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.545
So what we're gonna do
is this repo here and

54
00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:03.530
this repo here are gonna get
imported into this state.

55
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.413
And now terraform manages
our workspaces and

56
00:03:07.413 --> 00:03:11.612
our repositories everything
is automated now.

57
00:03:11.612 --> 00:03:16.730
Okay, so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna create a main.tf file.

58
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.124
Now, spoilers we're gonna be
using some more of my modules.

59
00:03:20.124 --> 00:03:24.609
But I have tested these on
a personal account so we are good.

60
00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.384
[LAUGH] So in this case what we
wanna do is we wanna copy and

61
00:03:28.384 --> 00:03:30.117
paste our first module.

62
00:03:30.117 --> 00:03:31.906
So I'm gonna go ahead and
give that to you so

63
00:03:31.906 --> 00:03:33.605
that you guys can start typing this out.

64
00:03:33.605 --> 00:03:37.919
But this is essentially
our repository module.

65
00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.275
Now this repository module
does a few things, right?

66
00:03:41.275 --> 00:03:46.030
For starters it, let's get rid of
this this doesn't need to be here.

67
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.083
It does the for_each like we're used to,
right?

68
00:03:49.083 --> 00:03:51.424
for_each like we're used to.

69
00:03:51.424 --> 00:03:54.767
We have a source which is
the GitHub repository module and

70
00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:57.146
the version that we're using, right?

71
00:03:57.146 --> 00:03:58.900
We then have a description.

72
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.740
I haven't added this to the config yet,
right?

73
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.813
But the reason why I said just start here
and then add your resource is because

74
00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:11.342
you don't know necessarily yet
what you're gonna have over here.

75
00:04:11.342 --> 00:04:12.183
You know what I mean?

76
00:04:12.183 --> 00:04:16.819
It's okay to start and be like, okay,
now let me go figure out what I need and

77
00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:18.564
then let me go at it, right?

78
00:04:18.564 --> 00:04:23.216
And so in this case what we wanna do is it
looks like we need to add a description

79
00:04:23.216 --> 00:04:28.186
for each repo, we need to add a potential
gitignore for each repo, a name for it.

80
00:04:28.186 --> 00:04:32.813
var.owner, okay, interesting, something
we might be reusing more than once.

81
00:04:32.813 --> 00:04:37.497
Topics for each repo and
visibility for each repo, okay?

82
00:04:37.497 --> 00:04:40.826
So let's go ahead and configure it.

83
00:04:40.826 --> 00:04:46.892
So the first one is gonna be for
our TFE repository.

84
00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:52.939
And it's gonna look something like that.

85
00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.688
So we're gonna say the description
Automation for Terraform Enterprise.

86
00:04:57.688 --> 00:05:02.102
The gitignore_template was the one
we already set it to, right?

87
00:05:02.102 --> 00:05:07.800
The eci-terraform-tfe that's
the name of the repository.

88
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.439
I don't know why that's actually in
there that doesn't need to be in there.

89
00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:16.097
Let me just check that really quick,

90
00:05:16.097 --> 00:05:20.918
yeah I might have actually done
that by accident sorry about that.

91
00:05:20.918 --> 00:05:26.859
I'm trying to think if there's
a reason why I have the name there,

92
00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:28.883
there shouldn't be.

93
00:05:28.883 --> 00:05:32.119
Yeah, so let's do this each.key.

94
00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:33.276
Yes, exactly.

95
00:05:33.276 --> 00:05:34.991
Yeah, we want it to be the key.

96
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:41.860
We always want the name of the repository
or the the resource name to be the key.

97
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.590
Now okay I know why I did this.

98
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.147
Let's say you're in a scenario where
your workspace doesn't match or

99
00:05:51.147 --> 00:05:57.090
your resource name might not match what
you wanna actually name it, right?

100
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.997
So here's a common scenario.

101
00:05:58.997 --> 00:06:03.031
If we go back to here and this is a bit
of a spoiler this is why I added this.

102
00:06:03.031 --> 00:06:09.143
We have prod network but then we also have
prod cluster and prod service, right?

103
00:06:09.143 --> 00:06:13.693
But there's another angle that
we're gonna take with this

104
00:06:13.693 --> 00:06:16.242
which is environments, right?

105
00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:19.186
So we're not just gonna have workspaces or

106
00:06:19.186 --> 00:06:22.308
resources that are just
their normal names.

107
00:06:22.308 --> 00:06:26.426
They might have other changes
to them like a dash prod or

108
00:06:26.426 --> 00:06:29.030
a dash dev or something like that.

109
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.483
And so in this scenario because we realize
that that's gonna be something we're gonna

110
00:06:33.483 --> 00:06:34.772
deal with in the future.

111
00:06:34.772 --> 00:06:38.099
We're actually gonna
keep the value.name here.

112
00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:42.999
And the reason for that is because
we do know that there might be

113
00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:47.996
a scenario where the key for
what we're trying to make might not

114
00:06:47.996 --> 00:06:52.256
match the value of the actual
name of the repository.

115
00:06:52.256 --> 00:06:55.471
In Terraform Cloud,
it makes a little bit more sense, right?

116
00:06:55.471 --> 00:06:57.493
Because there's never really
gonna be a disconnect.

117
00:06:57.493 --> 00:07:00.088
It's always gonna be like one-to-one so
to speak.

118
00:07:00.088 --> 00:07:04.331
But in this scenario, the flexibility
of passing the name gives you

119
00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:08.730
a little bit more options in the future
when you wanna be more dynamic.

120
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.506
Which is something we're
gonna do a little later.

121
00:07:10.506 --> 00:07:12.980
So let's keep the name for now, right?

122
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.330
But again, just note that this makes it so
we don't run over ourselves later.

123
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.985
Yeah.

124
00:07:17.985 --> 00:07:22.235
&gt;&gt; About the topics,
that array can you feed that anything?

125
00:07:22.235 --> 00:07:26.128
Or does that have to tightly correspond
to assigned topics on GitHub?

126
00:07:26.128 --> 00:07:27.253
&gt;&gt; No, you can type in anything.

127
00:07:27.253 --> 00:07:29.593
Yeah there
&gt;&gt; That's just an array local to

128
00:07:29.593 --> 00:07:33.927
the declarations here in locals for
however you wanna be tracking that stuff.

129
00:07:33.927 --> 00:07:40.341
&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, so for
example if I go back to my GitHub,

130
00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:45.286
if I go to my org &gt; View
organization you'll

131
00:07:45.286 --> 00:07:50.234
see here that I've got like eci-service,

132
00:07:50.234 --> 00:07:53.331
frontend-masters here.

133
00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:56.394
But then you'll see here my most
used topics like this is all from my

134
00:07:56.394 --> 00:07:59.849
organization so I can be like all
right let's look at frontend-masters.

135
00:07:59.849 --> 00:08:03.689
And then I can see my stuff, I can see
if there's other people's stuff as well.

136
00:08:03.689 --> 00:08:05.855
But you'll see here it's
looking in ALT-F4 by default.

137
00:08:05.855 --> 00:08:11.276
So it's really your own level of how you
wanna filter around in GitHub, yeah.

138
00:08:11.276 --> 00:08:14.912
&gt;&gt; I suppose my question then is if I
don't have topics configured in GitHub

139
00:08:14.912 --> 00:08:18.311
right now, if I put stuff in,
&gt;&gt; There's no topics to configure they're

140
00:08:18.311 --> 00:08:19.075
just like tags.

141
00:08:19.075 --> 00:08:20.294
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

142
00:08:20.294 --> 00:08:23.263
well you don't need to create them.

143
00:08:23.263 --> 00:08:26.205
They will just be whatever
you want them to be, yeah.

144
00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:28.698
Okay, cool so we've got that, right?

145
00:08:28.698 --> 00:08:33.210
Now let's do the exact same thing for
GitHub.

146
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:37.230
So I'm going to copy
this config real quick.

147
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:44.471
And I'm going to paste in the GitHub one,
okay?

148
00:08:46.367 --> 00:08:50.761
Yeah, okay so go ahead and get that one
in for me really quick before I close it.

149
00:08:50.761 --> 00:08:54.694
&gt;&gt; gitignore_template is do you
want Terraform to be in our GitHub?

150
00:08:54.694 --> 00:08:56.935
&gt;&gt; That's a predefined one.

151
00:08:56.935 --> 00:08:59.143
So Terraform just name it or

152
00:08:59.143 --> 00:09:03.878
just put the value as Terraform, GitHub
&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering do we

153
00:09:03.878 --> 00:09:07.874
want the terraform gitignore_template
to be in all of our GitHub.

154
00:09:07.874 --> 00:09:11.284
&gt;&gt; So let's think really quick,
what are we creating?

155
00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:13.650
We're creating a Terraform
automation repository right?

156
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.239
&gt;&gt; Is your automation
repository these aren't code

157
00:09:16.239 --> 00:09:19.166
repositories or
&gt;&gt; This repository is going to have

158
00:09:19.166 --> 00:09:22.906
the automation that will
create the other repositories,

159
00:09:22.906 --> 00:09:25.816
automation that helps automation, right?

160
00:09:25.816 --> 00:09:29.894
So Terraform Cloud is what made it so
that we can create our Terraform GitHub.

161
00:09:29.894 --> 00:09:33.408
And Terraform GitHub is gonna make it so
we can create all of our repositories.

162
00:09:33.408 --> 00:09:36.964
There is one other thing let me yeah,
the owner right so

163
00:09:36.964 --> 00:09:39.524
we said that we needed a owner, right?

164
00:09:39.524 --> 00:09:42.381
So we're gonna do variables,tf and

165
00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:47.554
we're going to paste in our owner
variable declaration, right?

166
00:09:47.554 --> 00:09:51.831
So I'm gonna go back to main
that's what my main looks like and

167
00:09:51.831 --> 00:09:54.558
that's what my variables looks like.
