1
00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:02.480
We're gonna start off by following
the three W's of strategy.

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.157
Now this is something that we do
explain in the DevOps course, but

3
00:00:05.157 --> 00:00:06.678
we're not gonna go too deep into it.

4
00:00:06.678 --> 00:00:09.850
But we just wanna make sure that we're
all on the same page here, okay?

5
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.780
So what problem are we trying
to solve is our first W.

6
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.330
That is most importantly the biggest
question you have to answer.

7
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.755
If you cannot answer what
problem you are trying to solve,

8
00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:24.630
you probably either don't have a problem,
or you don't know what the problem is.

9
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.180
So this is a very,
very important part of working in DevOps.

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.952
And sometimes, you'll have
circumstances where stuff is on fire.

11
00:00:33.952 --> 00:00:37.071
Nobody wants to be asked what problem
are you trying to solve while things

12
00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:37.639
are on fire.

13
00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:41.941
But the reality of it is, you still have
to, and that's why it's really important.

14
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:45.343
Also with when things are on fire,
you still have to ask, well,

15
00:00:45.343 --> 00:00:47.560
who are we solving this for, right?

16
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.848
Part of this position or
this practice is about making sure that

17
00:00:52.848 --> 00:00:59.656
you're doing what's best for the company
and the company's infrastructure.

18
00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:03.160
It's not about what a particular
developer may want, or

19
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.051
an opinion of a specific person, it's
about looking at the overall company and

20
00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:10.410
saying, okay, is this valuable?

21
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.325
And is this going to be solved for
the person we expect it to be solved for?

22
00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:16.900
And then again, the last one is,
why are we solving this problem?

23
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.242
So what are our problems, right?

24
00:01:20.242 --> 00:01:22.510
What are our problems if
we're a brand new company?

25
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.106
What would those look like?

26
00:01:25.106 --> 00:01:27.740
Well, we'd ask our first W, right?

27
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.501
Brand new company,
I just hired a whole bunch of people,

28
00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:33.210
what problems are we trying to solve?

29
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.313
Can anyone think of any problems?

30
00:01:35.313 --> 00:01:39.011
What would be first, maybe a couple
of things that you would think about?

31
00:01:39.011 --> 00:01:41.743
Brand new company just had hires,
nothing's been created yet,

32
00:01:41.743 --> 00:01:44.438
what would be something that you
might be concerned with first?

33
00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:45.277
Sure.

34
00:01:45.277 --> 00:01:46.095
&gt;&gt; Storage.

35
00:01:46.095 --> 00:01:46.894
&gt;&gt; Storage, yeah.

36
00:01:46.894 --> 00:01:47.714
&gt;&gt; Authentication.

37
00:01:47.714 --> 00:01:50.039
&gt;&gt; Authentication, yeah.

38
00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.923
&gt;&gt; Who owns what?

39
00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:53.570
&gt;&gt; Who owns what,
permissions are back stuff like that.

40
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.397
Yeah, anyone else?

41
00:01:54.397 --> 00:01:54.993
&gt;&gt; Cost.

42
00:01:54.993 --> 00:01:58.910
&gt;&gt; Cost, yeah, all of these things, right?

43
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.330
And we're not even talking technicals,
we're really not talking technicals yet.

44
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.588
But you can't, and this is something a lot
of engineers do, even I have tried to

45
00:02:07.588 --> 00:02:12.630
take a step back from, which is,
don't just fly down the problem, right?

46
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.360
Don't just be like,
we can technically solve it this way.

47
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.290
You have to take a step back and say like,
okay, what are we solving exactly here?

48
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.360
And so yeah,
you guys nailed a lot of this on the head.

49
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.028
For starters, for me, and I think that
some people might even argue this, but

50
00:02:28.028 --> 00:02:30.030
I think it's true, accessing control and

51
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.330
permissions is gonna be the first
thing you're worried about, why?

52
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.940
Because it's your intellectual property,
right?

53
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.980
You wanna make sure, and
companies fail at this constantly.

54
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.385
Companies constantly fail at not
putting good policies in place,

55
00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:45.464
not putting good permissions in place.

56
00:02:45.464 --> 00:02:47.238
And that's why you get data breaches,

57
00:02:47.238 --> 00:02:50.160
that's why you get a bunch of
other like broken stuff or things.

58
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.650
If you don't have good edges that
people can basically work around,

59
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.610
it makes it very difficult for
you to operate as a company.

60
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.250
So access control and permissions is huge.

61
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.140
It's a huge part of it.

62
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.036
If you are a software company then you'll
probably need to consider software life

63
00:03:05.036 --> 00:03:06.060
cycles, all right?

64
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.165
So, how are we gonna develop software?

65
00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:09.510
What tools are we gonna use?

66
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.580
How often are we gonna
release that software?

67
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.110
Who's gonna be doing what, right?

68
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.927
Things like that.

69
00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:16.138
And then you've got
supporting infrastructure.

70
00:03:16.138 --> 00:03:19.166
So, not only are we talking about
access control and permissions,

71
00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:21.996
now we are talking about how
are we gonna develop our software.

72
00:03:21.996 --> 00:03:24.856
Now it's like okay, well,
now we know what we want to build,

73
00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:26.516
what are we gonna build it on top of?

74
00:03:26.516 --> 00:03:27.970
[LAUGH] You know what I mean?

75
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.700
So infrastructure becomes
a big part of it.

76
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.646
And then finally, and I do think that this
is important, and unfortunately it is

77
00:03:34.646 --> 00:03:39.760
not something that is taken seriously
more, which is developer experience, DX.

78
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:48.060
To quickly talk about DX, and
I do talk about it more in the course.

79
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:55.170
For a DevOps perspective, developer
experience is crucial to the company.

80
00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.570
If developers aren't enjoying themselves,
you're not gonna get good product.

81
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.460
Why would you?

82
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.268
They're probably barely putting
in the effort they want to, or

83
00:04:04.268 --> 00:04:06.879
they're hating the technology
they're working around.

84
00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.332
And so it really does become part of
a problem to make sure that developers

85
00:04:11.332 --> 00:04:16.080
are actually enjoying what they're
building and what they're working on.

86
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.770
So, now that we know what problems
we're trying to solve, right?

87
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.240
Who are we solving these problems for,
right?

88
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.060
So the first is gonna be hands down
developers, through and through.

89
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.114
If you're a software company,
your problems are gonna be for

90
00:04:34.114 --> 00:04:35.350
developers, right?

91
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.620
Those are your end users.

92
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.341
Now the developers end users
are the people who go to the website,

93
00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:44.050
but your end users are developers.

94
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.505
You're also got end users for
quality assurance.

95
00:04:46.505 --> 00:04:48.857
So you're gonna be working with QA,
you're gonna be helping them,

96
00:04:48.857 --> 00:04:51.680
supporting them with the things
that they need, right?

97
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.410
So they're also part of the people
that you'll be helping.

98
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.770
IT, right?

99
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.630
Yes, you'll also be working with IT.

100
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.237
I know some companies that purposely
separate DevOps and IT and

101
00:05:02.237 --> 00:05:04.220
don't have them work together.

102
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.950
That's not a good idea.

103
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.099
At Hippo, where I work, IT and
DevOps work intrinsically together, so

104
00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.600
that we can integrate together.

105
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.530
And so we have a circumstance where we
have SSO, OneLogin, all this stuff.

106
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.150
And we went to IT and said,
okay, well, what do you need so

107
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.510
you can set up your authentication and
everything?

108
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.860
And then we'll build the automation
to provision the users where we need.

109
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.185
And so we enabled it to be able
to create users, manage them,

110
00:05:30.185 --> 00:05:33.330
do whatever they need to, and
then just gets automated.

111
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.170
So that's a problem we
don't even think about.

112
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.194
So having IT as a part of the people
that you're trying to solve problems for

113
00:05:38.194 --> 00:05:39.010
is very important.

114
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.760
And then others.

115
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.446
This can be any other organizational unit,
whatever, there might be other parts of

116
00:05:45.446 --> 00:05:50.060
your company that may need DevOps
infrastructure help, things like that.

117
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.716
But I think the biggest point here is
that outside of finance [LAUGH] and

118
00:05:55.716 --> 00:06:02.458
maybe some other parts of the company, you
touch a lot of the parts of the company.

119
00:06:02.458 --> 00:06:07.106
Your job in doing this role is to
come kinda make everyone happier,

120
00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:10.495
tor try to at least the best that you can.

121
00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:12.119
So, these are important people.

122
00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:15.869
If these people aren't on the list for
the people that you're trying to solve

123
00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:19.405
problems for, then you might not be
solving a problem valuable, yeah?

124
00:06:19.405 --> 00:06:22.591
&gt;&gt; If your company had significant
compliance requirements,

125
00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:26.405
would that be an instance where DevOps
actually does talk with finance?

126
00:06:26.405 --> 00:06:28.240
&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely, yeah.

127
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.575
DevOps would be in charge of
the compliance from the infrastructure

128
00:06:32.575 --> 00:06:33.800
perspective.

129
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.154
So, they would need to coordinate with
finance for an understanding when are we

130
00:06:37.154 --> 00:06:40.020
doing changes, when do we need to
take things into effect, right?

131
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.910
All that stuff.

132
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.010
And we do that at Hippo as well,
where I work, yeah.

133
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.323
We don't talk to legal very often, but
I mean, even when it comes down to like,

134
00:06:48.323 --> 00:06:52.448
we need to update our TOS, or we need to
do things like that, some of those things

135
00:06:52.448 --> 00:06:56.420
we personally take care of just because
of the importance and the severity.

136
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.649
We're an insurance company, so if we
get our TOS wrong, that's kind of bad?

137
00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:02.960
[LAUGH] And yeah, yeah, it can be that.

138
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.097
I think the overall thing to take
away here is, you should wanna help.

139
00:07:07.097 --> 00:07:12.623
Even if it seems like it might not be
something that is directly related to you,

140
00:07:12.623 --> 00:07:16.390
you are a figurehead for
the company in some ways, and

141
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.596
a lot of people will look to you for
that help.

142
00:07:19.596 --> 00:07:22.455
And then finally,
now that we know who, well,

143
00:07:22.455 --> 00:07:25.687
why are we solving these
specific problems, right?

144
00:07:25.687 --> 00:07:28.280
And so, this one's actually very easy.

145
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.391
I tried to separate it really
into two things, which is one,

146
00:07:31.391 --> 00:07:35.670
you have organization needs, and then
you have organization unit needs, right?

147
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.832
And if you've ever heard of this or
if you've ever created an SSL

148
00:07:38.832 --> 00:07:42.537
certificate before you've heard of OUs and
organizations, basically.

149
00:07:42.537 --> 00:07:47.931
It follows the same common pattern of you
have a global level of infrastructure,

150
00:07:47.931 --> 00:07:51.498
you have a lot of things that
you need to maintain, and

151
00:07:51.498 --> 00:07:56.150
these resources are reused by
other parts of the company, right?

152
00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.260
But then you also have specific resources
for specific parts of the company, and so

153
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.432
you kinda have to have like a layer here,
and

154
00:08:02.432 --> 00:08:05.206
then you have a layer that you
build on top of it, right?

155
00:08:05.206 --> 00:08:08.157
So the organization layer comes first,
the internal stuff, and

156
00:08:08.157 --> 00:08:11.173
the organizational units,
basically, are built on top of that.

157
00:08:11.173 --> 00:08:14.243
There can be more to this too,
but I think to try and

158
00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:17.990
think of this as plainly as
possible is probably a good idea.
