1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.090
So organization problems, right?

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.121
I actually used this in my last course
because it's such a good GIF, but

3
00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:07.450
it is very true.

4
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.167
Quite often than not,
when we have organizational problems,

5
00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:13.220
we just take them and
we put them over with the other fire.

6
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.401
And so we're going to be taking a look at
some of the organization problems that we

7
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:19.379
deal with fires quite often, right?

8
00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:24.092
So what are common problems
that orgs face, right?

9
00:00:24.092 --> 00:00:28.036
Well, now that we've talked about
what problems we're trying to solve,

10
00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:31.430
common organization problems
can be things like RBAC, right?

11
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.827
Making sure that you have
a good RBAC policy in place so

12
00:00:33.827 --> 00:00:37.721
that everywhere somebody tries accessing
something, there's permissions there,

13
00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:39.450
there might be groups there.

14
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.163
One thing that a lot of companies fail at
as well is assigning people individually

15
00:00:45.163 --> 00:00:51.870
instead of creating groups that people get
added to that then get added to projects.

16
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.683
The big reason for that is because then
you'd have the ability to do onboarding,

17
00:00:55.683 --> 00:00:59.382
where you can onboard somebody to a
specific thing and say, okay, now you have

18
00:00:59.382 --> 00:01:03.740
access to this you're on this team, and
this is actually how we do this at Hippo.

19
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.840
We don't have individuals
that is not allowed.

20
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.275
And you will get in
trouble if you do that.

21
00:01:08.275 --> 00:01:11.971
[LAUGH] But basically,
everything is team based.

22
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:16.170
So having that team based
perspective can be very helpful.

23
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.440
Domains and DNS is a huge one, right?

24
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.400
Again, I'm not even trying to talk about
the crazy engineering companies out there.

25
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.310
I'm just thinking simply, right?

26
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.460
What is your domain?

27
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.620
What is your DNS,
how does it route, right?

28
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.820
How do people get to your website?

29
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.130
Stuff like that.

30
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.320
And then underneath that is networking,
right?

31
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.860
So we've got domain set up now,
we've got DNS.

32
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.270
Well, what about networks?

33
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.630
What kinda networks do we need?

34
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.040
And then finally, resources,
right, compute and storage.

35
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.566
And you could see how we,

36
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:46.580
once again, are building layers
that stack on top of each other.

37
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.628
And this is gonna be a very,
very, honestly,

38
00:01:49.628 --> 00:01:53.468
DevOps is very much just like
playing with Legos, [LAUGH].

39
00:01:53.468 --> 00:01:56.816
You have components that you build and
then you build them on top of each other,

40
00:01:56.816 --> 00:02:00.228
and if you can keep that modularity,
then it doesn't matter what tool you use.

41
00:02:00.228 --> 00:02:03.462
It doesn't matter what
kind of practices you do,

42
00:02:03.462 --> 00:02:08.937
because they're all components that can
kinda be swapped in and out pretty easily.

43
00:02:08.937 --> 00:02:11.660
So let's talk about role-based
access control, and

44
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.000
what do we care about with that, right?

45
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.120
Well, again, we wanna have
the concept of organizational units.

46
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.275
We should start with teams, right?

47
00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:25.602
Have the concept of no individual has
access to something directly, right?

48
00:02:25.602 --> 00:02:28.412
Because if that happens and
that person leaves the company,

49
00:02:28.412 --> 00:02:29.689
then what do we do, right?

50
00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.490
So no individuals, right, teams.

51
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.735
And then what we do is, is we have
individuals or developers, again,

52
00:02:35.735 --> 00:02:37.000
be added to those teams, so

53
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.130
that then developers have proper
scopes to everything that they need.

54
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.984
Outside of that, we also might
have outside contributors, right?

55
00:02:43.984 --> 00:02:45.552
So you need to think about that.

56
00:02:45.552 --> 00:02:48.542
And that's another thing a lot of
companies don't consider because it might

57
00:02:48.542 --> 00:02:52.030
not be something that's on their plate or
something they're thinking about, right?

58
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.396
But sometimes you definitely have
people who come from the outside in and

59
00:02:55.396 --> 00:02:58.110
you think about, well,
how do we onboard those people?

60
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.010
How do we get those
people involved as well?

61
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.700
Domains and DNS,
this one's pretty simple as well.

62
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.640
More often than not, you'll have
a private DNS, and I do recommend this.

63
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.850
What do I mean by that?

64
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.207
I mean that you actually have
a completely separate domain for

65
00:03:16.207 --> 00:03:18.150
all of your private stuff.

66
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.380
Have a private domain.

67
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.080
For example, at Hippo,
we have Hippo Private.

68
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.406
So we got to hippo-private.com,

69
00:03:24.406 --> 00:03:29.630
that is a completely locked off
VPN-only accessible domain layer.

70
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.310
And all of our internal services
go through that, right?

71
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.630
Now why do we do that?

72
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.541
Because then we can standardize
how that works internally and

73
00:03:38.541 --> 00:03:43.220
it doesn't necessarily directly
impact our external domains.

74
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.085
External domains get crazy, you gotta
add all of these routing, redirects,

75
00:03:48.085 --> 00:03:49.470
all of these things.

76
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.560
And so we want private to be as simple and
as maintained as possible, right?

77
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.760
So having a top level domain for private
domains versus public is very helpful.

78
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.512
And a DNS management,
figuring out how you're gonna, do not,

79
00:04:04.512 --> 00:04:09.180
please do not cPanel it, okay,
we're way beyond cPanel now.

80
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.620
There's nice solutions out there for
DNS management,

81
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.840
Cloudflare, Amazon, Azure, right?

82
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.739
These solutions really help you set up
DNS management and routing easily, and

83
00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.640
they're good for that.

84
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.020
Honestly, I do not think you
should run your own DNS.

85
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.740
I don't, it's normally runs
into DNS being the problem.

86
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.330
So lean that onto somebody else, make
somebody else take care of that for you.

87
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.930
And the DNS, hopefully, won't be
a problem unless there's an outage.

88
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.620
Networking, as I said before,
private networks, public networks,

89
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.090
firewall security boundaries,
secure VPN connections, right?

90
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.474
The whole idea here is, is that,
going back to the private versus public,

91
00:04:49.474 --> 00:04:51.260
how do we get people into our networks?

92
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.830
How do we get developers
into our networks?

93
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.510
How do we make sure that the two don't
mesh or blend into each other, right?

94
00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.189
Networking does become a big problem
when you actually wanna talk about how

95
00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:07.007
are people going to work on things versus
how people are gonna buy things from us.

96
00:05:07.007 --> 00:05:09.514
VPN as well.

97
00:05:09.514 --> 00:05:11.690
So I know that there's
a lot of options out there.

98
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.160
I know you can do Bastion servers and
all those kinda things.

99
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.003
I think if you go back to what I said
before about wanting to provide a good

100
00:05:20.003 --> 00:05:23.900
developer experience, VPN should be easy.

101
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.223
VPN should not be a situation where
somebody has to open up their

102
00:05:27.223 --> 00:05:30.546
system settings, click the VPN,
copy and paste the address,

103
00:05:30.546 --> 00:05:32.820
copy and paste the security key.

104
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.110
It's very troublesome.

105
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.070
A lot of people just check out.

106
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.064
There's really great solutions
out there for VPNs today.

107
00:05:39.064 --> 00:05:40.397
We use Twingate.

108
00:05:40.397 --> 00:05:42.820
Twingate is a very,
very popular VPN solution.

109
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.860
It's really nice.

110
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.410
There's other options out there that
are even free, things like that.

111
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.947
I would recommend Twingate just because
Twingate also leans on the principles

112
00:05:50.947 --> 00:05:52.500
we've already talked about.

113
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.713
It's got RBAC, it's got team access,
it's got resource allocation and

114
00:05:55.713 --> 00:05:56.485
stuff like that.

115
00:05:56.485 --> 00:06:01.714
So finding something VPN wise that
actually makes that part of it easier for

116
00:06:01.714 --> 00:06:06.611
you can really help with getting
people into your private networks and

117
00:06:06.611 --> 00:06:07.860
stuff like that.
