1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.184
Now, the fun one,

2
00:00:01.184 --> 00:00:06.089
[LAUGH] we're gonna go to Amazon because
we need to create Amazon keys, right?

3
00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.786
This is the last thing that we need to do
to be able to make sure that our Terraform

4
00:00:09.786 --> 00:00:10.922
can run successfully.

5
00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:14.189
Okay, so I've got my credentials,
I'm gonna go ahead and hit Sign in.

6
00:00:16.389 --> 00:00:20.485
One of the reasons why I signed in
was cuz this is highly recommended.

7
00:00:20.485 --> 00:00:25.411
[LAUGH] There's a lot of people on
the Internet who would love to get access

8
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:30.176
to your Amazon account to make as
many botnets as they possibly could,

9
00:00:30.176 --> 00:00:31.890
as well as other things.

10
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.420
I highly recommend,
if on any of these things,

11
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.520
putting multifactor on Amazon account.

12
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.896
It'll just make sure that
you're as safe as possible,

13
00:00:40.896 --> 00:00:44.299
you don't have to be worried about people
accidentally getting your account.

14
00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:47.630
Amazon is definitely one of
the most attacked platforms.

15
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.919
So it's just something to consider.

16
00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:53.130
Okay, cool, so
now I have logged into my Amazon account.

17
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.244
Is everyone here?

18
00:00:54.244 --> 00:00:57.916
Yeah, all good?

19
00:00:57.916 --> 00:01:03.191
Cool, okay, so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna create a access key.

20
00:01:03.191 --> 00:01:06.035
But we're not gonna just
create an access key,

21
00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:09.528
we're also gonna make sure
that we have specific access.

22
00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:15.226
So here's a question,
who here logged in with a root account?

23
00:01:15.226 --> 00:01:17.341
You logged in with your root account?

24
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:19.963
Cool, who else here logged in with root,
did all of you guys?

25
00:01:19.963 --> 00:01:21.001
Okay, let me do that,

26
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:24.082
let me log in with my root account
because that's what we wanna do.

27
00:01:24.082 --> 00:01:26.789
So I'm gonna go back here.

28
00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:28.483
If you look at the bottom,

29
00:01:28.483 --> 00:01:33.950
you'll notice that there's also an option
that says Sign in using root user email.

30
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.052
This option is for

31
00:01:35.052 --> 00:01:39.688
pretty much the main stakeholder or
the main owner of the account, right?

32
00:01:39.688 --> 00:01:44.971
And so for me,
this would be my email, Right, and

33
00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:51.240
then my password, it's that one,
and then of course, my MFA.

34
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.724
Okay, so the reason why we're logging
into the root account is because,

35
00:01:56.724 --> 00:01:58.676
my cost went down, nice.

36
00:01:58.676 --> 00:02:04.445
The reason why we're logging into the root
account is cuz we wanna make sure,

37
00:02:04.445 --> 00:02:08.439
just like we did with Terraform or
any other service,

38
00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:12.011
that we set up good boundaries,
essentially.

39
00:02:12.011 --> 00:02:15.769
Do not create resources
with your root account.

40
00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.062
Do not do that, it's not a good idea.

41
00:02:18.062 --> 00:02:20.623
Nobody else can access that account but
you, and

42
00:02:20.623 --> 00:02:23.634
you also don't want anyone
else to access that account.

43
00:02:23.634 --> 00:02:28.941
The root account should basically
be locked off, third partied away,

44
00:02:28.941 --> 00:02:33.813
or not third partied,
two-factor off as much as possible away.

45
00:02:33.813 --> 00:02:38.984
And then what we do instead is
we're gonna create user groups and

46
00:02:38.984 --> 00:02:42.252
users that are specific for logging in.

47
00:02:42.252 --> 00:02:47.120
So the first thing we're gonna do is we're
gonna go to the top right-hand corner.

48
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.014
I'm sorry, no, we're gonna go to IAM.

49
00:02:52.014 --> 00:02:58.633
Type IAM in the top search, type in IAM,
and then navigate to the IAM page, okay?

50
00:02:58.633 --> 00:03:02.894
After we do that,
we're actually gonna create a user group.

51
00:03:02.894 --> 00:03:06.510
Now, notice I have a user group here, but
I'm gonna go ahead and create a new one.

52
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.525
We'll call this one Administrators2.

53
00:03:09.525 --> 00:03:11.838
But realistically,
this is your administrator's account.

54
00:03:11.838 --> 00:03:17.490
Like I said, always create groups, right?

55
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.701
Here's a good example.

56
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:24.238
At Hippo, when we decided to
move from our old AWS accounts

57
00:03:24.238 --> 00:03:28.875
to the new ones,
every user was manually put in.

58
00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:34.086
[LAUGH] Every single one of
our users was manually put in.

59
00:03:34.086 --> 00:03:38.436
That meant that every user had
their own ways of accessing things,

60
00:03:38.436 --> 00:03:43.187
their own policies that were added
throughout the years, it was a mess.

61
00:03:43.187 --> 00:03:46.632
And so when we move to our new accounts,
everybody got groups,

62
00:03:46.632 --> 00:03:48.721
everybody got added to those groups.

63
00:03:48.721 --> 00:03:53.567
And every previous permission of, but
I used to be able to access S3 and

64
00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:56.995
prod, why can't they do it
anymore is gone, right?

65
00:03:56.995 --> 00:03:59.993
Because you shouldn't be able to access
prod and S3, you know what I mean?

66
00:03:59.993 --> 00:04:01.300
You should not be able to do that.

67
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.634
So this is why these groups and
teams are so valuable.

68
00:04:07.634 --> 00:04:11.530
However, since I'm just making an
administrator, I'm just gonna scroll down.

69
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.208
Again, disregard any of
my existing groups, and

70
00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:16.841
then you'll see Attach
permissions policies.

71
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:21.552
What's nice about Amazon is they have
a ton of really great permission sets that

72
00:04:21.552 --> 00:04:26.420
are already set up, that already kind of
help you understand what you might want.

73
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.681
And if you just type in Admin,
you'll see a bunch of options related to

74
00:04:30.681 --> 00:04:34.528
administration of different
parts of their infrastructure.

75
00:04:34.528 --> 00:04:38.082
So for example,
if you had somebody managing API gateway,

76
00:04:38.082 --> 00:04:41.080
you could make them an API gateway admin,
right?

77
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.267
You don't have to worry about the rest
of the account being exposed, right,

78
00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:45.062
things like that.

79
00:04:45.062 --> 00:04:47.707
In this case,
we just want AdministratorsAccess, and

80
00:04:47.707 --> 00:04:49.350
this one is the good old star star.

81
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.594
This is the most terrifying and

82
00:04:51.594 --> 00:04:56.180
most granting access you can
have on Amazon, the double star.

83
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.994
However, this does really make sure that
if you're trying to create anything,

84
00:04:59.994 --> 00:05:02.640
manage anything,
you're not gonna get blocked by it.

85
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.788
So be aware of that, you are in God mode.

86
00:05:06.788 --> 00:05:09.960
We're going to click Create group.

87
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.410
And bam,
we have our now brand new created group.

88
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.638
So now that we have our group,

89
00:05:14.638 --> 00:05:16.810
the next thing we wanna do
is actually create a user.

90
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.241
So then we go in, we click Create users,
or Users, we click Create user, and

91
00:05:21.241 --> 00:05:22.280
we give it a name.

92
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.998
Now, I normally just give it like myself,
some people put in their email address.

93
00:05:26.998 --> 00:05:28.446
It's up to you, honestly.

94
00:05:28.446 --> 00:05:32.270
Doesn't have to be an email,
it can be flippy flop.

95
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.482
It doesn't matter.

96
00:05:33.482 --> 00:05:37.920
It's just whatever you wanna use
to log in with, that's up to you.

97
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.079
So in this case, I would do example.

98
00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:41.971
Now, before I move forward,

99
00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:46.980
what I wanna do is I wanna click Provide
user access to AWS Management Console.

100
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.592
The thing I'm logged into right now
is the management console, right?

101
00:05:50.592 --> 00:05:54.490
So I wanna be able to let others
like myself log into it as well.

102
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.971
So I'm gonna click this, and
then you'll notice that it says, hey,

103
00:05:57.971 --> 00:06:00.278
Are you providing console
access to a person?

104
00:06:00.278 --> 00:06:03.320
This is new, but this is actually
really nice new feature that

105
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.672
Amazon has provided that
we're not gonna use.

106
00:06:05.672 --> 00:06:09.070
[LAUGH] But
it's essentially another layer of

107
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.549
abstraction that they have now made for
users identities.

108
00:06:13.549 --> 00:06:14.889
And so if you wanted to,

109
00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.709
you could actually create a user
in what they call Identity Center.

110
00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:20.290
Homework for you guys.

111
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.010
Take a look at it, explore it,
I would recommend it.

112
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.970
We're not gonna do that right now, though,
we're just gonna create a normal IAM user.

113
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.803
So I'm gonna click I want
to create an IAM user.

114
00:06:29.803 --> 00:06:33.865
Now, it's up to you if you wanna
autogenerate a password and

115
00:06:33.865 --> 00:06:36.901
then be asked to rechange
it when you sign in.

116
00:06:36.901 --> 00:06:40.465
Or if you wanna uncheck that, and
then just click Custom password and

117
00:06:40.465 --> 00:06:41.821
put in your own password.

118
00:06:41.821 --> 00:06:46.350
It's up to you, whichever you wanna do.

119
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.025
In my case, I'm just gonna autogenerate
cuz I'm not gonna use this account, and

120
00:06:51.025 --> 00:06:52.669
then I'm gonna click Next.

121
00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:53.754
Here's the group's part.

122
00:06:53.754 --> 00:06:56.306
This is why we created our group first,
because if not,

123
00:06:56.306 --> 00:06:57.891
then I'd have to go Create group.

124
00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:01.058
I'd have to be pulled out of the flow,
go back through the whole process, and

125
00:07:01.058 --> 00:07:01.758
then come back.

126
00:07:01.758 --> 00:07:04.069
So that's why we created our group first.

127
00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:08.359
We click on that Administrators2,
hit Next.

128
00:07:08.359 --> 00:07:12.374
And then this is our Review and create, so
we'll see User name, example, password,

129
00:07:12.374 --> 00:07:13.206
Autogenerated.

130
00:07:13.206 --> 00:07:16.784
I'm in the administrators account or
administrator's group, and

131
00:07:16.784 --> 00:07:17.777
I hit Create user.

132
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.552
Did anyone have any problems doing that?

133
00:07:24.552 --> 00:07:26.482
No, cool.

134
00:07:26.482 --> 00:07:28.865
Okay, so once you click Create user,

135
00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:33.715
you're at the point now where Amazon
actually does some nice things for you.

136
00:07:33.715 --> 00:07:35.972
This used to not be done by the way.

137
00:07:35.972 --> 00:07:37.719
[LAUGH] They used to not do this, but

138
00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:40.745
I think they realized that
people don't copy things well.

139
00:07:40.745 --> 00:07:42.780
And so
what you can do is you have two options.

140
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.189
The first thing is you can
copy your console URL.

141
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:48.060
So this is something I would note.

142
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.497
This is something you're gonna need,
so you can copy it and

143
00:07:50.497 --> 00:07:53.742
just create a new tab for that cuz that's
what you're gonna wanna log in with.

144
00:07:53.742 --> 00:08:00.096
You'll notice that it prepopulates
your account for you, which is nice.

145
00:08:00.096 --> 00:08:02.297
You will also notice,
I got logged out, but

146
00:08:02.297 --> 00:08:05.275
you'll also notice that your
password was there, too, right?

147
00:08:05.275 --> 00:08:08.040
So you can save your credentials,
you can copy your password.

148
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.492
But realistically,
you wanna get to where I am now,

149
00:08:10.492 --> 00:08:12.180
which is you wanna log out, right?

150
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.424
So we've created our account,

151
00:08:14.424 --> 00:08:19.999
you wanna log out because we wanna log
into the account we just created, right?

152
00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:24.180
Now, again, I'm not gonna use that
account, I'm gonna use my other account.

153
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.363
So I'm gonna go in here,
just gonna autofill that, but

154
00:08:27.363 --> 00:08:32.128
again, you'll use your credentials, and
then you'll log in with that account.

155
00:08:42.735 --> 00:08:49.600
Cool, I'm actually gonna delete
the example user cuz I don't need it.

156
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.933
Now, what you'll notice
is because I'm an admin,

157
00:08:52.933 --> 00:08:55.601
I can even go in and delete users, right?

158
00:08:55.601 --> 00:09:00.166
So there's really not much we did here
from a security standpoint, except for

159
00:09:00.166 --> 00:09:05.020
just give myself a separate account to log
in that isn't the root account, right?

160
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:05.642
So again,

161
00:09:05.642 --> 00:09:10.501
it's really important to note that it's
still a complete admin-based account.

162
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:12.867
It's just a separate one
from the root account so

163
00:09:12.867 --> 00:09:14.723
that that doesn't get compromised.

164
00:09:14.723 --> 00:09:16.959
&gt;&gt; What would the account alias be?

165
00:09:16.959 --> 00:09:22.379
&gt;&gt; The account alias would
be your organization name.

166
00:09:22.379 --> 00:09:24.915
Yeah, I believe.

167
00:09:24.915 --> 00:09:28.236
So you see where it says e.reinert@.

168
00:09:30.415 --> 00:09:31.212
Wait.

169
00:09:31.212 --> 00:09:34.338
&gt;&gt; Yeah, otherwise,
you just get an account ID number.

170
00:09:34.338 --> 00:09:37.430
&gt;&gt; Okay, gotcha.

171
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.463
[LAUGH] All good?

172
00:09:45.732 --> 00:09:50.212
So this is why we do this first [LAUGH] so
we don't have to deal with it again later.

173
00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:56.981
How close are we until our next break?

174
00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:04.889
&gt;&gt; I mean,
pretty much anytime the next ten minutes.

175
00:10:04.889 --> 00:10:06.507
Yeah, if you wanna get through this and
then we can-

176
00:10:06.507 --> 00:10:07.056
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

177
00:10:07.056 --> 00:10:08.225
&gt;&gt; Take the break and go around.

178
00:10:08.225 --> 00:10:11.085
If anybody needs to get the last
couple of steps done or caught up,

179
00:10:11.085 --> 00:10:12.231
we can take time for that.

180
00:10:12.231 --> 00:10:15.475
&gt;&gt; Perfect, yeah, I was about to say,
after this, it's just coding.

181
00:10:15.475 --> 00:10:17.907
[LAUGH] So yeah, this is, hands down,

182
00:10:17.907 --> 00:10:22.710
one of the most difficult parts of this
whole thing, so [LAUGH] bear with me.

183
00:10:25.892 --> 00:10:27.784
Were you able to get in?

184
00:10:27.784 --> 00:10:32.242
&gt;&gt; I've had to get back into my root user
to look at what I named the thing because

185
00:10:32.242 --> 00:10:33.855
I didn't save that piece.

186
00:10:33.855 --> 00:10:38.118
&gt;&gt; Gotcha, no worries,
I'll give you a second here.

187
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.424
Is there any questions, by the way?

188
00:10:46.424 --> 00:10:48.721
Chat, do you guys have any questions for
me,

189
00:10:48.721 --> 00:10:51.995
anything you wanna argue with me about for
the next few minutes?

190
00:10:51.995 --> 00:10:55.280
[LAUGH] We can do that.

191
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.461
Gosh, I just opened up,
that was a bad idea.

192
00:10:58.461 --> 00:11:03.747
[LAUGH] And if you guys have any
questions as well, feel free to ask.

193
00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:07.276
&gt;&gt; So it should be the user
group that it's assigned to?

194
00:11:07.276 --> 00:11:10.935
&gt;&gt; Yes, it should be assigned to
the administrator user group, yeah.

195
00:11:13.988 --> 00:11:18.419
&gt;&gt; So Terraform is gonna run
as this user that we created?

196
00:11:18.419 --> 00:11:21.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gonna run on
that account for now, yeah.

197
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:28.670
&gt;&gt; Would it be somewhat safer
to have it as suma role?

198
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:32.791
&gt;&gt; Remember that we already made the
decision that we're gonna do star star.

199
00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:36.372
So if you wanna do it in this account or
you wanna do it in another account,

200
00:11:36.372 --> 00:11:39.484
maybe for your org,
don't do it in your own personal account,

201
00:11:39.484 --> 00:11:41.032
that'd be a good idea, yeah.

202
00:11:41.032 --> 00:11:43.949
But for personal stuff,
yeah, it's up to you.

203
00:11:43.949 --> 00:11:45.699
It's a good call, that's a very good call.

204
00:11:45.699 --> 00:11:46.513
Yeah, again,

205
00:11:46.513 --> 00:11:50.782
the only real difference here is just
the account cuz it's still the same level.

206
00:11:50.782 --> 00:11:54.945
I would say if you wanted to restrict,
then yeah, absolutely,

207
00:11:54.945 --> 00:11:56.343
you know what I mean?

208
00:11:56.343 --> 00:11:59.983
There are some limitations with
this approach, the first and

209
00:11:59.983 --> 00:12:02.085
most important one is Kubernetes.

210
00:12:02.085 --> 00:12:07.026
So when you create a Kubernetes cluster,
the identity of the IAM user you create

211
00:12:07.026 --> 00:12:11.247
it with is actually the only person
that can connect to the cluster.

212
00:12:11.247 --> 00:12:14.614
They don't really have an easy
way of working around that.

213
00:12:14.614 --> 00:12:17.479
So if you create,
say you do have a Terraform user and

214
00:12:17.479 --> 00:12:20.411
you create your cluster in
Terraform Cloud, right,

215
00:12:20.411 --> 00:12:24.861
then the only thing that can access that
cluster is the thing in Terraform Cloud.

216
00:12:24.861 --> 00:12:29.831
And so in that scenario, then you actually
have to take that key, right, connect to

217
00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:34.462
the cluster with it and then inject other
users that can access to that, yeah.

218
00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:36.400
Now, if you look in
the top right-hand corner,

219
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.971
you'll see that mine says ALTF4LLC.

220
00:12:37.971 --> 00:12:43.235
So if you go to IAM, So go to IAM,

221
00:12:43.235 --> 00:12:47.960
it's in the most obvious place.

222
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.645
If you look right here, there's a little
option that says Account Alias.

223
00:12:51.645 --> 00:12:54.710
And you can actually change
this to whatever you want.

224
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:59.182
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what tripped me up actually
was in the top right drop-down,

225
00:12:59.182 --> 00:13:02.880
it lists the ID with hyphens,
and I copy-pasted that.

226
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.900
&gt;&gt; Yep.

227
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.650
&gt;&gt; And is it just needs to be the numbers?

228
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.009
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

229
00:13:08.009 --> 00:13:10.163
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I literally clipboarded that and
it brought the hyphens with,

230
00:13:10.163 --> 00:13:11.300
which is-
&gt;&gt; Weird.

231
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.739
&gt;&gt; Kind of an anti-pattern.

232
00:13:12.739 --> 00:13:14.740
&gt;&gt; That is a big anti-pattern, yeah.

233
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.236
I would recommend making an alias
just to make it easier so

234
00:13:17.236 --> 00:13:18.745
you don't have to remember that.

235
00:13:18.745 --> 00:13:22.070
That's why I just made ALTF4LLC for me.

236
00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.100
So I would recommend that, yeah.
