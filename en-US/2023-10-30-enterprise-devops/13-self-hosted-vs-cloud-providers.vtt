00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.377
The next thing I really wanna talk
about is self-hosted versus cloud

2
00:00:04.377 --> 00:00:05.669
providers, okay?

3
00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:10.536
And if you're curious which one is which,
Guilfoyle, self-hosted, Dinesh,

4
00:00:10.536 --> 00:00:11.670
cloud providers.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.490
This is a really common question.

6
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.284
It happens a lot I don't know why but
it almost seems like people

7
00:00:20.284 --> 00:00:25.550
think it's easier to go to
self-hosted than it is to cloud.

8
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.533
And I think that's like
a common misconception.

9
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:33.674
I think it might be because like,
I know how a network switch works right or

10
00:00:33.674 --> 00:00:38.286
I know how to, plug in a computer and
these lower level pieces, I think,

11
00:00:38.286 --> 00:00:41.290
is what makes us confident
in self-hosting.

12
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.220
However, where that confidence is lost
is around the management of it, right?

13
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.985
Making sure that it's up all the time,

14
00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:50.140
making sure that it's
patched all the time.

15
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.670
And this is where a lot of that
is completely forgotten and lost.

16
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.200
So this is a super common question,
but in my opinion,

17
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.880
I don't necessarily think it's the right
question but let's go a bit further.

18
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.010
So should I self host my infrastructure?

19
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.540
No, I don't think you should.

20
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.330
However, and again, this is a big however,
it's up to the organization, okay?

21
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.110
That might be my personal opinion but
I will say.

22
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.384
If you're in a scenario where
self-hosting is maybe required,

23
00:01:21.384 --> 00:01:26.996
maybe the infrastructure's already been
there and there's not much flexibility.

24
00:01:26.996 --> 00:01:31.745
I have people in our community who
are talking in our discord daily

25
00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:35.559
about the challenges they
have with self-hosted.

26
00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:40.747
And a lot of the times,
it's the same problem, an outage, this or

27
00:01:40.747 --> 00:01:45.376
that and these are the reasons why
I say no, if you're a company.

28
00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:48.201
Now if you're just a person,
it doesn't really matter,

29
00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:51.892
you're hobbyist at that point you just
having fun, but if you're a company

30
00:01:51.892 --> 00:01:55.698
who doesn't wanna have to worry about
your servers being online all the time,

31
00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:58.207
doesn't have to worry
about the electrical bill.

32
00:01:58.207 --> 00:02:01.303
[LAUGH] Even into that, what I mean?

33
00:02:01.303 --> 00:02:05.164
These are just reasons why you would you
would use a cloud provider instead of

34
00:02:05.164 --> 00:02:06.257
a self host, right?

35
00:02:06.257 --> 00:02:08.657
[LAUGH] It's so much cheaper.

36
00:02:08.657 --> 00:02:11.159
Also, no, it's not.

37
00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.132
This is also a common misconception.

38
00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:15.220
And I'm gonna give a good example of this.

39
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.411
So I built a data center before,
and when we did it,

40
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:27.080
we spent around $50,000 in hardware for
a specific part of our section, right?

41
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.969
So we spent $50,000 on the tech, right?

42
00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.491
And then we spent probably another
month in implementation and

43
00:02:33.491 --> 00:02:36.810
development, getting it all set up and
running.

44
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.690
And not only that, then we also had to
hire somebody who was on colocation, so

45
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.650
that when I wasn't at the data center,
someone else could handle that for me.

46
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.080
Those are called like runners essentially.

47
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.240
They cost a lot of money.

48
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.900
Datacenters don't wanna
touch your servers.

49
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.261
And so a lot of the times your money
even though you're running it in a DC is

50
00:02:56.261 --> 00:03:00.482
around maintenance and making sure
that somebody's going to the data

51
00:03:00.482 --> 00:03:04.640
center often and checking these things and
stuff like that.

52
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.988
If you don't have these in place,
it's hard to be away from that

53
00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:13.240
physical component and
know that it's working all the time.

54
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.846
And so this is where I don't even
think it's cheaper because you

55
00:03:17.846 --> 00:03:21.740
have ongoing maintenance
that you just keep doing.

56
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.428
And that really just comes down to time
and money spent on those problems.

57
00:03:28.428 --> 00:03:32.414
And again, as I mentioned before,
you'll spend money on engineers, right?

58
00:03:32.414 --> 00:03:36.402
You'll spend more money on maintenance and
you'll spend more money on security and

59
00:03:36.402 --> 00:03:38.884
security is one we didn't even talk about,
right?

60
00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:43.404
I don't think any of you guys
have armored entrances or

61
00:03:43.404 --> 00:03:48.809
complete battery backup failsafes or
on premise security guards

62
00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:54.802
who monitor access to your,
these are things that if you self-host it,

63
00:03:54.802 --> 00:04:00.060
if you go into a co-location,
you're gonna pay for it.

64
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.320
And if you do it completely on-premises
yourself, you have to do it yourself.

65
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.625
These are things that you just get out
of the box with Amazon by simply saying,

66
00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:12.656
I'm gonna spend a little
bit more on my VPC.

67
00:04:12.656 --> 00:04:16.600
And so again, when should I self-host?

68
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.200
So here's a good example
of when you should.

69
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.810
Dropbox, Dropbox from ending and
this is from what I knew a while ago.

70
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.896
I don't know if it's still accurate,
but I know at one point,

71
00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:34.454
they separated their data
from the cloud to be on Prem.

72
00:04:34.454 --> 00:04:37.945
And a big reason for
that was just because it was easier for

73
00:04:37.945 --> 00:04:42.990
them to manage the actual data locally for
security and things like that, right?

74
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.160
But then all their API's and
stuff still existed in the cloud, right?

75
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.240
So they just use their on prem stuff for

76
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.230
the data storage part of
their their infrastructure.

77
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.430
Why did they do that?

78
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.176
Well, potentially for security reasons,

79
00:04:57.176 --> 00:05:00.142
maybe they had to bring
the data closer to home so

80
00:05:00.142 --> 00:05:05.351
that they wouldn't have to deal with like
shoot, what's the European security?

81
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:06.020
&gt;&gt; GDPR.

82
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.876
&gt;&gt; Yeah, GDPR and stuff like that right?

83
00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:12.665
Once you really start talking about these
things it becomes really challenging

84
00:05:12.665 --> 00:05:16.115
sometimes to do it on a cloud provider
level, especially when you're so

85
00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:17.000
big, right?

86
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.320
But they didn't say, well,
let's just move everything right.

87
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.168
They just took that one component and
they said, okay, well,

88
00:05:22.168 --> 00:05:25.230
this makes more sense for
us to host it ourselves, right?

89
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.963
And so this is, I think,

90
00:05:26.963 --> 00:05:32.342
a good scenario of where sure self-hosting
might be viable for you, right?

91
00:05:32.342 --> 00:05:35.679
Because it's about
saving yourself time and

92
00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:41.030
saving yourself really in the end
more opportunity to do other things.

93
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.076
And so if this gives you that,
then it's probably worth it.

94
00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:50.090
But gotta really be confident in the whole
management process of that, right?

95
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.897
So self-hosting should
really be isolated for

96
00:05:53.897 --> 00:05:58.381
separate managed infrastructure or
things like that.

97
00:05:58.381 --> 00:06:03.665
And as I said before I have self hosted I
literally used to go to a Colocation data

98
00:06:03.665 --> 00:06:08.788
center once a month I've been inside of
it, inside of DCs a lot and I've also

99
00:06:08.788 --> 00:06:14.380
done Private clouds as well I've worked
on OpenStack and I've worked on VMware.

100
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.129
And in both times it was not cheaper or
easier and

101
00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:21.045
more time was spent on maintenance.

102
00:06:21.045 --> 00:06:26.369
When it was at the CoLo, I was driving to
the data center a lot or we were spending

103
00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:31.535
thousands of dollars on having somebody
get up out of their chair, walk five

104
00:06:31.535 --> 00:06:36.808
feet and plug something in, because
that's what they charge if you do that.

105
00:06:36.808 --> 00:06:41.298
Whereas the Private cloud scenario, you're
entirely in charge of that cloud, right?

106
00:06:41.298 --> 00:06:45.661
So you're in charge of all the services,
you're in charge of all the data stuff, or

107
00:06:45.661 --> 00:06:47.756
all the databases and things like that.

108
00:06:47.756 --> 00:06:52.908
And so what happens if your database
breaks on your open source cloud provider?

109
00:06:52.908 --> 00:06:55.744
[LAUGH] Nothing works.

110
00:06:55.744 --> 00:07:00.619
And so this is what I mean by it's
just not easier because you take

111
00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:05.421
on the responsibility of what
you're essentially managing.

112
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:08.257
So, which cloud providers should I use?

113
00:07:08.257 --> 00:07:12.760
If we decide not to use self-hosted,
which cloud providers should I use?

114
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.910
I put Amazon on here.

115
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.358
We're gonna be using Amazon.

116
00:07:15.358 --> 00:07:19.370
I also put Google Cloud Platform and
Azure Cloud.

117
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.811
These I think are probably the most
talked about clouds out there right now.

118
00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:30.290
IBM is a more, I would say, focused on
specific problems, and they have a really

119
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:35.531
good solution but I think for general
purpose clouds, Amazon Web Services,

120
00:07:35.531 --> 00:07:40.717
GCP, and Azure Cloud are probably
the ones that people talk about the most.

121
00:07:40.717 --> 00:07:45.163
And what about other ones that you've seen
before, like DigitalOcean, Linode, Heroku,

122
00:07:45.163 --> 00:07:46.480
like where do those fit in?

123
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.193
So when I worked at MediaTemple,

124
00:07:50.193 --> 00:07:54.574
we got coined the phrase
a boutique hosting provider.

125
00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:59.299
And if you've ever gotten to like
shoes and stuff, there's boutiques for

126
00:07:59.299 --> 00:08:04.399
shoes, it's kinda the same concept is
these are providers that are very niche or

127
00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:05.710
very small.

128
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.981
And they actually normally 9 times out
of 10 already built on top of existing

129
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:11.040
providers.

130
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.488
So for example, Linodes,
object storage, that's just Amazon.

131
00:08:15.488 --> 00:08:17.933
[LAUGH] It's just rebranded Amazon.

132
00:08:17.933 --> 00:08:20.685
Same thing with a lot of DOs,
like droplets and stuff.

133
00:08:20.685 --> 00:08:25.275
That's not their infrastructure,
that's running on something else or

134
00:08:25.275 --> 00:08:27.578
at least it was, it might not be now.

135
00:08:27.578 --> 00:08:31.654
But a lot of these are essentially
what we call resellers.

136
00:08:31.654 --> 00:08:34.162
They're taking the products
that already exist and

137
00:08:34.162 --> 00:08:37.018
they're reselling on top of them for
a more premium value.

138
00:08:37.018 --> 00:08:40.174
They could be valuable to you,
but it's gonna be more expensive.

139
00:08:40.174 --> 00:08:44.580
A bucket through linode is just,
they want more of a cut.

140
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.300
So they're gonna take
a bit more out of it.

141
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.230
They're not really considered
enterprise cloud providers at

142
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.655
least from my perspective because they
already build on top of enterprise

143
00:08:52.655 --> 00:08:54.050
cloud providers that exist.

144
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.092
So again, how can they help?

145
00:08:57.092 --> 00:09:01.615
A good example of this is if
you have specific requirements,

146
00:09:01.615 --> 00:09:05.605
say you've got a frontend
team that wants to deploy or

147
00:09:05.605 --> 00:09:09.967
something like, edge,
workers or something like that.

148
00:09:09.967 --> 00:09:11.933
Cloud workers might be a good solution for
you.

149
00:09:11.933 --> 00:09:18.444
That's more of like a boutique-specific
niche thing, right?

150
00:09:18.444 --> 00:09:20.959
If you're into Next.js and all that stuff,

151
00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:24.346
those are popular solutions
that solve specific problems.

152
00:09:24.346 --> 00:09:25.522
And the last one,

153
00:09:25.522 --> 00:09:30.322
I think that really helps everyone is
they can help with speed to market.

154
00:09:30.322 --> 00:09:33.936
If you're in a situation where you
genuinely just don't care about any of

155
00:09:33.936 --> 00:09:37.608
your infrastructure, you're just
a developer who wants to host things,

156
00:09:37.608 --> 00:09:40.311
Heroku and
these other services are really powerful.

157
00:09:40.311 --> 00:09:42.130
They can get you there really quickly.

158
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.665
So, if you don't wanna build
infrastructure, essentially,

159
00:09:45.665 --> 00:09:48.590
these providers can really
help you with that.

160
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.380
This is the question I get a lot, right?

161
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:55.037
Which cloud providers should I use?

162
00:09:55.037 --> 00:09:59.466
I don't like, the TLDR on all of
this is I don't have a standardized,

163
00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:01.582
strict way of giving that to you.

164
00:10:01.582 --> 00:10:02.441
I don't.

165
00:10:02.441 --> 00:10:07.552
The reality of it is it's about your
confidence in trying something new and

166
00:10:07.552 --> 00:10:09.915
experimenting with it, really.

167
00:10:09.915 --> 00:10:13.547
And so, for me,
whenever I pick a cloud provider again,

168
00:10:13.547 --> 00:10:15.450
I evaluate my requirements.

169
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.840
I look and I see,
what do I just need to get this running?

170
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.380
Do I just need an EC2 instance or
just an instance?

171
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.700
Do I need a container?

172
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.560
Things like that.

173
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.871
And I think it's also good to include
possible future requirements with

174
00:10:28.871 --> 00:10:29.530
that as well.

175
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.570
There's a solid chance you might
be on that provider for a while.

176
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:36.361
So might ask yourself questions like,
would we ever get into serverless?

177
00:10:36.361 --> 00:10:39.468
Would we ever want to use a CDN
solution provided by them or

178
00:10:39.468 --> 00:10:41.660
other things like that?

179
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.580
But don't let that decision
be the guiding force.

180
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:51.754
It's just something that will help you
with getting through the the question.

181
00:10:51.754 --> 00:10:56.774
Determine which provider fits your needs
in the sense of actually look at what

182
00:10:56.774 --> 00:11:01.576
you need and say, okay, yep,
it does it, this, actually solves that.

183
00:11:01.576 --> 00:11:03.780
And then determine which one
fits your budget with it.

184
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.920
So once you know it can do what you want,
price it.

185
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:13.440
Do not go to the cloud
without pricing anything.

186
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.651
If you do that,
your credit card will cry, [LAUGH] okay?

187
00:11:16.651 --> 00:11:21.169
So you do not want to, even if
you're going to create an instance,

188
00:11:21.169 --> 00:11:26.175
go to Amazon's calculator,
all these big providers have calculators,

189
00:11:26.175 --> 00:11:31.501
you can look in at least see a vague idea
of how much you're gonna be spending and

190
00:11:31.501 --> 00:11:32.900
that's how I do it.

191
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.110
I'll build a small piece
of infrastructure.

192
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.503
I'll go to the calculator and then
I'll say, yep, that's not a good idea.

193
00:11:38.503 --> 00:11:42.500
[LAUGH] I'll go back and
I'll rebuild it until it's cost effective.

194
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.420
This is another one as well,
which I think is very important.

195
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.890
Test with a constant proof of concept.

196
00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.055
What does that mean?

197
00:11:49.055 --> 00:11:52.272
Basic hypothesis, what is it?

198
00:11:52.272 --> 00:11:53.640
The hypotherm?

199
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:58.505
I can't even speak, but the hypothesis
theory, that's what I'm trying to say,

200
00:11:58.505 --> 00:12:03.022
you have a constant, and you do the same
thing on all of them to actually be able

201
00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:05.480
to see what the differences are, right?

202
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.835
So going all the way back to the terraform
versus Pulumi examples that I showed

203
00:12:09.835 --> 00:12:10.639
you, right?

204
00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:13.721
You can do the same thing,
but with cloud providers.

205
00:12:13.721 --> 00:12:16.857
Build one network on Amazon,
build another one on GCP and

206
00:12:16.857 --> 00:12:18.695
realize why you don't like GCP.

207
00:12:18.695 --> 00:12:19.678
No, I'm just kidding.
[LAUGH] but

208
00:12:19.678 --> 00:12:23.467
realize why it might not be something
that you're interested in or not.

209
00:12:23.467 --> 00:12:28.241
And don't build one thing on one cloud and
then one on another and

210
00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:33.384
expect it to give you a reasonable
answer cuz they work differently.

211
00:12:33.384 --> 00:12:35.590
And then document your findings and
compare.

212
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.646
I genuinely think if you go through
this list for each cloud provider and

213
00:12:39.646 --> 00:12:43.702
by the time you get to the last one
you'll very confident in at least what

214
00:12:43.702 --> 00:12:47.900
you know and what you will wanna chose and
it might take a couple of times.

215
00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:52.213
You might try Amazon first then you might
try GCP and then you might try Azure and

216
00:12:52.213 --> 00:12:56.850
then you might look at all three of them
and then go like, Stick with your gut.

217
00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.490
What felt the easiest to use?

218
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:04.430
If it was that, then that might
be the best one for you to use.

219
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.465
It's not a simple decision, as I said, and

220
00:13:06.465 --> 00:13:08.890
it should be taken seriously
with proper research.

221
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.934
You're buying your next home for
your company.

222
00:13:11.934 --> 00:13:15.471
You have to be very considerate
of if that home is gonna help

223
00:13:15.471 --> 00:13:17.430
you scale the way that you want.
