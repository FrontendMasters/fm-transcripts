00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.781
So again, you should have basically this
code set up to where you have a locals

2
00:00:04.781 --> 00:00:08.920
now, you have a backend now,
and you have a main now, right?

3
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.030
So let's do what we always need to do.

4
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.630
What's the command you
think I need to run next?

5
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.840
&gt;&gt; Terraform init?

6
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.320
&gt;&gt; Nope, what's the next one?

7
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.164
We've already initialized,
so we're good there.

8
00:00:18.164 --> 00:00:19.818
&gt;&gt; Is it validate?

9
00:00:19.818 --> 00:00:22.645
&gt;&gt; Yes, validate.

10
00:00:22.645 --> 00:00:23.290
Looks good.

11
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.380
Now if we wanted to, we could init
one more time just to be safe.

12
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.380
But you only really need to initialize
when you change this value for a project.

13
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.458
So for example, if I went flippyflop,

14
00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.014
You'll see the module is not installed,
right?

15
00:00:42.014 --> 00:00:46.260
Now why would it say that when
we've already done it, right?

16
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.270
Terraform is also kinda dumb.

17
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.511
It might have magic but
it's also very dumb in some regards.

18
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:58.160
And when we create or when we copy our
modules, If I go back in here, this

19
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.071
looks like it says project and workspace,
which might make you think, cool, cool.

20
00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:07.696
Now, those are the resource names,
those are the actual resource names.

21
00:01:07.696 --> 00:01:11.431
So for example,
if I was to do another init,

22
00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:18.720
See how flippyflop's there now?

23
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.149
Terraform is kinda dumb in the sense
that it'll copy the same thing over and

24
00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.540
over and over again because it needs
that directory for that module.

25
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.990
It's just going to a directory and
saying, hey, I need this.

26
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.058
But if you're iterating over a for loop,

27
00:01:35.058 --> 00:01:39.090
then it needs to make sure that it doesn't
actually go to the wrong path, right?

28
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.652
So Terraform will look for
all of your modules you're using, and

29
00:01:42.652 --> 00:01:45.270
then it'll download all of them, right?

30
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.200
&gt;&gt; And it didn't get rid
of your project resource?

31
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.689
&gt;&gt; Because I didn't change the name of it.

32
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.782
Cuz down here it still says workspace.

33
00:01:52.782 --> 00:01:54.990
You mean,
why didn't it delete the existing one?

34
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.150
Just doesn't clean them up.

35
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.760
Yeah, it just doesn't do clean up, yeah.

36
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.380
So let's go back here and
then go to project again.

37
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.890
Let me reinitialize just so that I'm good.

38
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.065
And then, yeah, we're gonna do a validate.

39
00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.177
Figuration is valid,
fantastic, okay, cool.

40
00:02:14.177 --> 00:02:18.565
So let's do this, let's do a plan,
we're already there, right?

41
00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:25.262
We got a bit of a problem.

42
00:02:25.262 --> 00:02:27.206
Can anyone tell me what
this problem might be?

43
00:02:30.246 --> 00:02:32.489
Give you a hint somewhere around here.

44
00:02:36.463 --> 00:02:37.470
&gt;&gt; Gonna get rid of them.

45
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
we're actually gonna destroy them.

46
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.171
That's not good.

47
00:02:41.171 --> 00:02:42.960
Well, let's take a look and
see what we got here.

48
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.620
Well, okay, I see my workspace.

49
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.460
Cool, look at this.

50
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.596
You could see it's adding the key now,

51
00:02:48.596 --> 00:02:51.850
so we know that this is the new
workspace it wants to create.

52
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.136
But because we renamed it,
technically Terraform's now going,

53
00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:01.058
I don't know what this resource is.

54
00:03:01.058 --> 00:03:04.359
I created module.workspace.

55
00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.606
I didn't create module dot workspace
dot blah blah blah, right?

56
00:03:08.606 --> 00:03:10.074
So how do I fix that?

57
00:03:10.074 --> 00:03:14.108
This is a problem that a lot of people run
into where they'll create new automation

58
00:03:14.108 --> 00:03:18.335
and then they'll change it and they'll
go,like, no, what have I done, right?

59
00:03:18.335 --> 00:03:21.565
Don't worry,
there's a way of working around this.

60
00:03:21.565 --> 00:03:25.927
There used to not be, but about a year
ago, TerraForm realized that this

61
00:03:25.927 --> 00:03:29.732
was a terrible pain point, and
they made it a bit easier for us.

62
00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:32.920
They added another meta
argument called moved.

63
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.279
And just as you think it might do,
it's going to take something from

64
00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:43.000
one location and tell TerraForm
that it's somewhere else now.

65
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.930
So it's literally just from and to, right?

66
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.633
And so what we wanna do is,
is we wanna tell TerraForm, hey,

67
00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:55.986
whatever you thought was gone,
in this case, module.workspace,

68
00:03:55.986 --> 00:04:02.384
I'm gonna copy that,
I'm gonna go back to my main and

69
00:04:02.384 --> 00:04:07.120
I'm gonna go from,
because that's where I was, right?

70
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.862
But where I want to be, Is here.

71
00:04:17.073 --> 00:04:22.767
Right, we're using that key value
targeting again to tell TerraForm,

72
00:04:22.767 --> 00:04:27.823
hey, don't delete this, please,
[LAUGH] I need this, right?

73
00:04:27.823 --> 00:04:32.984
And we need to do it for one other thing,
which is our project, right?

74
00:04:32.984 --> 00:04:38.950
So both resources that are going to get
deleted must get moved values for them.

75
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.050
And sure enough,
you can see that it's saying, okay, cool.

76
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.490
I see that you're changing stuff, right?

77
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.910
However, this isn't, yeah, this is good.

78
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:50.540
Okay, cool, sorry.

79
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.670
So let's go here, project.

80
00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.275
Now if I save this and
I do a plan again, you could see now,

81
00:05:00.275 --> 00:05:06.100
look at this, 0 to add, 0 to change,
and 0 to destroy, right?

82
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.870
So we've now told TerraForm hey, these
got moved, so please don't delete them.

83
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.352
Please keep them and keep managing them.

84
00:05:13.352 --> 00:05:16.434
And you'll see here that it actually says,
okay, cool, I see it.

85
00:05:16.434 --> 00:05:20.284
So it will tell you even when it
recognizes that things have moved,

86
00:05:20.284 --> 00:05:21.490
which is nice.

87
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.924
So if you get here but
you don't see that things have moved,

88
00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:28.660
you might wanna take a look and
see why that might be going on.

89
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.735
So now, what I can do is I
can actually apply this, but

90
00:05:32.735 --> 00:05:36.200
you might be like, what are you applying?

91
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.380
Why are you doing that?

92
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.659
Well, technically, we did update state,
even though we didn't actually change any

93
00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.471
of the, right,we didn't actually change
the configuration of a project or

94
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:47.600
a workspace, right?

95
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.140
But we did tell TerraForm stuff
technically moved, right?

96
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.675
So we do still wanna apply that to
make sure that it knows that those

97
00:05:54.675 --> 00:05:57.660
changes actually happened, right?

98
00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.590
So we're gonna do terraform apply.

99
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.273
&gt;&gt; Do you have to make the move block and

100
00:06:02.273 --> 00:06:05.448
apply to reflect the changes it wants-
&gt;&gt; Yes

101
00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:07.520
&gt;&gt; And then you can remove it?

102
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.900
Or does the moved need to exist
in this case forever in the repo?

103
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it doesn't need to
exist forever in the repo.

104
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.620
Thankfully, [LAUGH] they realize that that
would be very annoying, cuz think about

105
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.430
it, then you move something again,
how do you do that, right?

106
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.630
So you move it once, and then you
apply it, and then after the move,

107
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.567
you can actually go in here and go into
your main file now that we've applied it,

108
00:06:31.567 --> 00:06:37.210
right, And then do a plan again.

109
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.620
Oop, sorry, dang it.

110
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.310
Don't Ctrl+C TerraForm while it's doing
stuff, it doesn't like it [LAUGH].

111
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.050
State is locking and all that,
it doesn't really work well.

112
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.549
So yeah, there you go,
you see how I've got no changes now and

113
00:06:51.549 --> 00:06:52.930
my moves are now gone.

114
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.150
So yeah,
you definitely can get rid of them.

115
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.015
Again, thankfully they made that nice for
us.

116
00:06:59.015 --> 00:06:59.690
So, cool.

117
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.940
So we now understand that we
can do some cool things, right?

118
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.290
We understand that we can have
our main resources, right?

119
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.403
We also understand that we can
create this really cool concept of

120
00:07:12.403 --> 00:07:15.840
a configuration domain
language of our own, right?

121
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.930
And then we also have our backend,
which enables us to push to the cloud.

122
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.563
And again, the biggest stuff I really want
you guys to take away here is locals is

123
00:07:23.563 --> 00:07:25.040
really powerful.

124
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.308
It seems like it's very not, but

125
00:07:27.308 --> 00:07:31.940
TerraForm does have a lot of
different types of variables, right?

126
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.830
You can have lists,
you can have strings, you can have maps.

127
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:39.750
And so what's really powerful is, is you
start using that in your configuration.

128
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:44.559
So if you wanna do for loops, if you wanna
do just direct values or nested values,

129
00:07:44.559 --> 00:07:49.210
you can really start to lean on
the language here to be able to do that.

130
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.143
And so yeah, congratulations,

131
00:07:51.143 --> 00:07:56.049
you have now officially set up your first
dynamic configuration within TerraForm.
