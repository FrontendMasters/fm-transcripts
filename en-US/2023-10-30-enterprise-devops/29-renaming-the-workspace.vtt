WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.070
We created a new set of resources, right?

2
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.400
You guys got to understand how
we move that to the cloud.

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.843
Then you guys got to understand how we can
create a configurable set of options or

4
00:00:13.843 --> 00:00:17.888
configurable map, essentially, or
DSL or whatever you wanna call it,

5
00:00:17.888 --> 00:00:21.469
that then made it so that powers
which resources gets created and

6
00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:24.559
how they're configured and
stuff like that, right?

7
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.424
But there's one other thing we kinda
wanna change here really quickly,

8
00:00:30.424 --> 00:00:33.538
which is this is just
called FVME CI Workspace.

9
00:00:33.538 --> 00:00:37.015
[LAUGH] It doesn't really give me much
of help of actually knowing what this

10
00:00:37.015 --> 00:00:38.550
workspace is, right?

11
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.350
So we wanna lean on our
moved one more time, right?

12
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.150
And what we want to do is we want to
actually change these names here, right?

13
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.730
And so
we're just gonna change this one to tfe.

14
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.250
The project can stay the same.

15
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.540
You can call it whatever you want.

16
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.940
That project is really not important.

17
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.689
But what is, is knowing which
workspace is which, right?

18
00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:09.105
And so we're gonna make sure to
rename the workspace from fem-eci

19
00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:15.500
workspace to fem-eci-tfe, because
this is for our Terraform automation.

20
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.870
However, if I plan this, okay, cool.

21
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.300
So here you go, pull one to add and
one to destroy.

22
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.288
No, we're getting into that
destroy situation again, right,

23
00:01:26.288 --> 00:01:30.213
because we changed the key,
the key is the name of the resource.

24
00:01:30.213 --> 00:01:35.257
And so what we wanna do, right, as we did
before is go to our main file, right?

25
00:01:35.257 --> 00:01:38.941
Now we don't have any moves here or
you either applied it and

26
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:40.940
they're still there, right?

27
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.872
I would recommend first after applying
to make sure all of your moves are done,

28
00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:48.640
right, we'll add a new moved.

29
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.551
And this one is gonna be
from module.workspace,

30
00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:59.211
eci-workspace.

31
00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:03.833
Oops, right?

32
00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:07.931
And I'm just going to
duplicate this really quickly,

33
00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:10.880
give it a 2, and then change it to tfe.

34
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.150
And I'll leave that up for
a second for you guys.

35
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.803
The point of this is, we don't want to
actually use the name workspace here,

36
00:02:19.803 --> 00:02:23.000
again, it just doesn't help us whatsoever.

37
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.922
But I'm showing you guys where changes
can impact when you accidentally or

38
00:02:28.922 --> 00:02:32.220
might not want to delete things, right?

39
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.649
So, keys, really important to try and
keep the same.

40
00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:38.910
If you change the key, you might
actually have to recreate that resource,

41
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.830
which means that you might
have to put a moved in there.

42
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.560
So it's just something to be considerate
of whenever you're making these

43
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.539
changes is, try and name it once the first
time, try and name it right, right?

44
00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.971
Try and think about what you're making
a little bit so that you're not

45
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:57.290
trying to have to go back and
do moves and all that kinda stuff, right?

46
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.634
And so once you've got that in place,
I'm going to do a plan.

47
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.408
And then sure enough, you could see now
my workspace name is being changed,

48
00:03:13.408 --> 00:03:16.050
right, but it's not being destroyed.

49
00:03:17.532 --> 00:03:22.543
And so then if I want,
I can do apply just like that.

50
00:03:22.543 --> 00:03:31.112
So I'll give you guys
a second to catch up.

51
00:03:33.972 --> 00:03:37.125
So now, if I go in Terraform Cloud,

52
00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:42.706
I should see it's already updated,
fem-eci-tfe, right?

53
00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:50.324
So as I said before, this is a scenario
where it really goes to show,

54
00:03:50.324 --> 00:03:54.170
again, be aware of the values
that you're changing.

55
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.658
You might accidentally change something
that if it's especially in a configuration

56
00:03:58.658 --> 00:04:03.530
loop like this or something, it could
impact the recreation of the service.

57
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.250
So just be aware of that, essentially.

58
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.810
Now, there is one slight change,
or one slight problem here, right?

59
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.762
And that problem is is that our backend.tf
is still pointed to our old workspace,

60
00:04:19.762 --> 00:04:20.280
right?

61
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.510
It's not called workspace anymore.

62
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.780
It's now called fem-eci-tfe, right?

63
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:35.650
So the second change we have to make
is to our actual backend.tf, right?

64
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.779
So again, I'm gonna just quickly
close this out, all right.

65
00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:44.869
There's the backend.tf file
that you need to update.

66
00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:48.351
Let me open up the main.tf file as well,
oops.

67
00:04:52.273 --> 00:04:53.560
There you go.

68
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.980
And so this is basically the two
files that you need to update.

69
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.453
And again, we are making sure
that the moved is added so

70
00:05:05.453 --> 00:05:09.821
that when we renamed our
project to terraform tfe or

71
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:14.020
fem-eci-tfe, that doesn't get recreated.

72
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.004
And then also because we
renamed the workspace,

73
00:05:17.004 --> 00:05:20.560
we have to make sure that
the backend is properly set.

74
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.471
Because otherwise if I didn't do that,
if I tried to do another plan,

75
00:05:24.471 --> 00:05:25.876
it would actually fail.

76
00:05:30.917 --> 00:05:35.835
Does anyone have any questions so
far, problems, anything like that?

77
00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:40.400
&gt;&gt; Since that workspace is basically
just a location for the state,

78
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.471
does it really matter if you keep,
I guess,

79
00:05:43.471 --> 00:05:47.970
the resources in one workspace but
the state in another?

80
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.274
&gt;&gt; Because we have
a terraform tfe workspace,

81
00:05:50.274 --> 00:05:53.771
the lifecycle of all those components
stay in that state, right?

82
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:57.568
But in the future when we create
a GitHub workspace, a network workspace,

83
00:05:57.568 --> 00:06:02.029
another workspace, you could merge states
together, sure, all in one workspace, or

84
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:05.250
you could put them in separate
workspaces and stuff like that.

85
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.217
But the goal of why we're separating
the states we are is to make it so

86
00:06:09.217 --> 00:06:12.010
that the changes stay together, right?

87
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.723
So, I guess I don't really know
where else this state would go,

88
00:06:16.723 --> 00:06:20.000
except for in this workspace, right?

89
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.017
You could create a project per, say like,
well, okay, when we get to GitHub, then

90
00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:30.268
we could create workspace for GitHub, but
then we'd have to manually do that, right?

91
00:06:30.268 --> 00:06:34.181
But with this approach, we can do
it automatically in one place, and

92
00:06:34.181 --> 00:06:36.756
then go to the other
place to create the repo.

93
00:06:36.756 --> 00:06:40.886
And that's kinda like what we talked
about yesterday where to set these up,

94
00:06:40.886 --> 00:06:42.830
you have to do two steps.

95
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.112
The step of the state is in terraform tfe,
and

96
00:06:45.112 --> 00:06:48.490
then the state of the repos in
TerraForm GitHub when we get to that.

97
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.457
But TerraForm GitHub has its own
state that we don't want mixed with

98
00:06:53.457 --> 00:06:54.419
terraform tfe.

99
00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:58.171
So when we update GitHub,
we don't wanna touch TerraForm, and so

100
00:06:58.171 --> 00:07:00.320
that's why we keep them separate.

101
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.870
&gt;&gt; Yes, separation of states.

102
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.495
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; I was curious,

103
00:07:03.495 --> 00:07:07.490
are there any nice visualizers for
state [INAUDIBLE].

104
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.990
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'd love to see you build it.

105
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.850
There's not much, no.

106
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.400
Have you ever seen huge dependency trees?

107
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.442
They just get [SOUND] it's like that.

108
00:07:20.442 --> 00:07:23.434
I think anytime anyone's
tried to visualize state,

109
00:07:23.434 --> 00:07:27.900
it's just this big madness of, it's
like Charlie Day and it's always sunny.

110
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:33.300
And it's like the huge wall but you'd
basically just be looking at that, so.

111
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.870
I'd love to see somebody visualize it
in a way where it's actually helpful.

112
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:37.970
I haven't seen that yet, though.

113
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.400
Yeah, really, I would love to see it.

114
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.551
The best way to look at
state right now is really

115
00:07:46.551 --> 00:07:54.480
doing this command right here,
doppler run -- terraform list.

116
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.140
Oop, sorry, list.

117
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.504
By the way, after we change
our backend make sure to init,

118
00:07:59.504 --> 00:08:02.220
you do have to do an init one more time.

119
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.737
So make sure to do that after
you change your backend.

120
00:08:04.737 --> 00:08:06.623
And then if I do state list,

121
00:08:06.623 --> 00:08:12.530
I can actually see everything that's
in my current state once it returns.

122
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:13.730
There we go.

123
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.910
So you could take this data and
then make it into a cool website or

124
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.050
something like that.

125
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.540
[LAUGH] That would be really cool.

126
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.970
But I haven't seen that yet,
unfortunately.
