1
00:00:00.197 --> 00:00:01.439
Automation providers.

2
00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.241
[LAUGH] So yeah, like I said,
I was just about to talk

3
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:10.502
about Pulumi Cloud and
all these other ones.

4
00:00:10.502 --> 00:00:13.048
I do think this is a pretty
accurate image [LAUGH] for

5
00:00:13.048 --> 00:00:15.838
it because this is a scenario
where you want to do this,

6
00:00:15.838 --> 00:00:19.011
where you want to say hey,
shut up and take my money, help me.

7
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:22.568
Just save me, make my life easier.

8
00:00:22.568 --> 00:00:26.519
So, should you use an automation provider,
right?

9
00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.591
We talked about should you run
a shell script over and over and over,

10
00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:33.172
should I actually pay
the money to do this?

11
00:00:33.172 --> 00:00:38.014
Because I am somebody who
had servers in his garage.

12
00:00:38.014 --> 00:00:42.382
[LAUGH] I have run stuff on-prem
to pinch every penny I can, but

13
00:00:42.382 --> 00:00:47.179
over the past, I would say a few years,
I've wanted to sleep more.

14
00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:51.172
[LAUGH] I've wanted to do actually
go out and do things more.

15
00:00:51.172 --> 00:00:56.107
And this is where, going back here,
this helps, right?

16
00:00:56.107 --> 00:00:59.362
Because what you can do is you
can just say, take my money and

17
00:00:59.362 --> 00:01:01.199
solve my problem for me, right?

18
00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.254
Out-of-the box with automation providers,

19
00:01:03.254 --> 00:01:06.398
they're gonna have standardized
practices already built in, right?

20
00:01:06.398 --> 00:01:11.404
So Terraform Cloud, Pulumi Cloud, they
already know how they run their pipelines.

21
00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:15.468
They already know how you can review
the pipelines, it's already built there.

22
00:01:15.468 --> 00:01:18.696
You don't have to think about it,
it's a turnkey solution, right?

23
00:01:18.696 --> 00:01:21.762
So if you're in a scenario where
we don't have any automation, or

24
00:01:21.762 --> 00:01:23.753
we have no way of managing our automation.

25
00:01:23.753 --> 00:01:27.473
Well, an automation provider could
actually be super helpful for you and

26
00:01:27.473 --> 00:01:31.442
get a bunch of other stuff out of the box
that you might not even expect, right?

27
00:01:31.442 --> 00:01:36.755
Another one that you've seen a lot,
collaboration features, right?

28
00:01:36.755 --> 00:01:41.285
You do not want a single person
managing all of your infrastructure,

29
00:01:41.285 --> 00:01:42.701
that is a fail point.

30
00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:47.991
[LAUGH] And if they leave or anything
like that, you are in trouble, right?

31
00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:53.147
So including collaboration in your
automation provider means I can

32
00:01:53.147 --> 00:01:58.855
make changes, but then somebody else
can approve and apply them, right?

33
00:01:58.855 --> 00:02:02.591
So, if you have different time zones,
you have different teams,

34
00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:06.126
they can work together and
you don't have to be worried about,

35
00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.608
is it gonna go safely to
where it needs to go?

36
00:02:08.608 --> 00:02:11.257
And then there's also additional
features like cost management.

37
00:02:11.257 --> 00:02:13.757
Some providers can look
at your AWS resources,

38
00:02:13.757 --> 00:02:17.328
tell you how much your cost-effectiveness
is and stuff like that.

39
00:02:17.328 --> 00:02:20.163
So there's a lot of value there.

40
00:02:20.163 --> 00:02:23.086
Do you need to spend money on providers?

41
00:02:23.086 --> 00:02:25.304
As I said before, no.

42
00:02:25.304 --> 00:02:28.513
And again,
this is the biggest takeaway, but

43
00:02:28.513 --> 00:02:32.391
it will help you focus money
on other problems, right?

44
00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:35.715
So if you say, okay,
here is money towards this,

45
00:02:35.715 --> 00:02:38.894
you don't have to worry
about those problems.

46
00:02:38.894 --> 00:02:42.043
Yes, that money is allocated to that,
but it's not a problem.

47
00:02:42.043 --> 00:02:44.273
It's just a financial thing, right?

48
00:02:44.273 --> 00:02:46.702
That's easier to solve in a lot of ways.

49
00:02:46.702 --> 00:02:50.379
Whereas when you go to another situation
and you need to solve it, well,

50
00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.020
that money has been allocated.

51
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.236
We don't have to worry about it.

52
00:02:53.236 --> 00:02:54.557
I don't have to be concerned about it.

53
00:02:54.557 --> 00:02:57.450
And now I can say, hey,
can I take some other money and

54
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.066
put it towards this, right?

55
00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:04.814
That argument becomes a lot easier
to convey and make possible.

56
00:03:04.814 --> 00:03:07.923
The reality of it is the decision
is up to the organization, right?

57
00:03:07.923 --> 00:03:12.546
The whole company should be able
to say what they think is, or

58
00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:15.547
at least the people involved, right?

59
00:03:15.547 --> 00:03:20.023
What if I don't want to spend
money on automation providers?

60
00:03:20.023 --> 00:03:23.832
And this goes back to the whole, what if
I just want to run a for loop over and

61
00:03:23.832 --> 00:03:25.376
over and over again, right?

62
00:03:25.376 --> 00:03:27.908
Sure, you can build your own solutions.

63
00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:30.677
Sure, you can use open source solutions,
and

64
00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:35.374
you can even pay engineers to build
solutions, employers, or contractors.

65
00:03:35.374 --> 00:03:39.562
However, and again,
this is where technology separates itself,

66
00:03:39.562 --> 00:03:43.098
you have to also look at this
from a business standpoint.

67
00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:47.090
No matter what, in pretty much any of
these solutions, or let me ask you this,

68
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.828
in any of these solutions
are you not spending money?

69
00:03:54.137 --> 00:03:56.094
&gt;&gt; Always at least opportunity cost.

70
00:03:56.094 --> 00:04:01.011
&gt;&gt; Yeah, is time valuable to you, right?

71
00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:06.486
Do you wanna spend eight hours
in the trenches of automation?

72
00:04:06.486 --> 00:04:10.347
No, [LAUGH] so no matter what,
you're gonna spend money on automation.

73
00:04:10.347 --> 00:04:12.681
So where do you wanna spend it?

74
00:04:12.681 --> 00:04:15.917
How can you make that easier, right?

75
00:04:15.917 --> 00:04:18.406
So what are some automation providers?

76
00:04:18.406 --> 00:04:21.086
Terraform Cloud, which is the one
we'll end up using, right?

77
00:04:21.086 --> 00:04:22.604
There's Pulumi Cloud.

78
00:04:22.604 --> 00:04:25.335
There's the Env0, Spacelift,
and other ones, right?

79
00:04:25.335 --> 00:04:29.294
There are many more, but these
are probably the most common ones that

80
00:04:29.294 --> 00:04:31.691
you're used to seeing or hearing about.

81
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:35.887
Terraform Cloud is, again, because
Terraform is the industry standard,

82
00:04:35.887 --> 00:04:40.486
they were able to lean on top of that and
make Terraform Cloud an industry standard.

83
00:04:40.486 --> 00:04:43.176
And this is, again,
what makes Terraform so great.

84
00:04:43.176 --> 00:04:47.330
Not only can you use the CLI locally,
but then you can also go to their cloud

85
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.817
platform and everything works
automatically out of the box.

86
00:04:50.817 --> 00:04:53.157
It maintains state of the infrastructure.

87
00:04:53.157 --> 00:05:00.497
So, if you are creating resources, well,
where does that actual state go, right?

88
00:05:00.497 --> 00:05:01.676
They take care of it for you,

89
00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:04.096
their platform will actually
just host the state for you.

90
00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:06.432
You don't have to be worried about that.

91
00:05:06.432 --> 00:05:08.459
It provides access control features.

92
00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:12.992
So out of the box, you get teams, you get
the ability to allow people to approve or

93
00:05:12.992 --> 00:05:14.005
deny workflows.

94
00:05:14.005 --> 00:05:17.388
And you don't have to be worried
if they can or can't do that,

95
00:05:17.388 --> 00:05:21.635
you can build that into the platform,
and it also includes infrastructure.

96
00:05:21.635 --> 00:05:24.281
So with Terraform Cloud,
you don't have to figure out, well,

97
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:25.653
what's gonna run my pipelines?

98
00:05:25.653 --> 00:05:27.621
Terraform Cloud can actually do that for
you.

99
00:05:27.621 --> 00:05:30.442
They have runners,
they have infrastructure there.

100
00:05:30.442 --> 00:05:34.039
So out of the box,
you really just have to run code.

101
00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.577
And I think that was their goal with
Terraform Cloud, was to be able to

102
00:05:37.577 --> 00:05:42.031
just say, okay, I was working locally, now
let me move all this to the cloud, right?

103
00:05:42.031 --> 00:05:43.561
And get all those benefits.

104
00:05:43.561 --> 00:05:46.296
So Terraform Cloud is really
a great choice for small or

105
00:05:46.296 --> 00:05:49.400
large companies that
are collaborating on infrastructure.

106
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.196
We use Terraform Cloud at Hippo.

107
00:05:51.196 --> 00:05:52.940
I think it's awesome.

108
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.838
I really do love using it because I can
have somebody go make some changes,

109
00:05:57.838 --> 00:06:01.712
and then they'll just copy and
paste me a link to the plan.

110
00:06:01.712 --> 00:06:04.812
Then I can go look at that plan
when I want, and even if I want to,

111
00:06:04.812 --> 00:06:06.584
I can approve it if I'm allowed to.

112
00:06:06.584 --> 00:06:09.504
So it really allows you to
kind of keep moving and

113
00:06:09.504 --> 00:06:11.768
keep collaborating well together.

114
00:06:14.179 --> 00:06:15.757
Okay, Pulumi Cloud.

115
00:06:15.757 --> 00:06:21.975
So Pulumi Cloud for starters is an [LAUGH]
alternative to Terraform Cloud, it is.

116
00:06:21.975 --> 00:06:23.284
It does the same thing.

117
00:06:23.284 --> 00:06:26.316
It maintains state of infrastructure
just like Terraform Cloud does.

118
00:06:26.316 --> 00:06:27.767
So you do get that benefit.

119
00:06:27.767 --> 00:06:33.606
You don't have to figure out, do I upload
it to a bucket or stuff like that.

120
00:06:33.606 --> 00:06:36.650
However, and please, Pulumi Cloud,

121
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.455
if you're out there, change this,
there's no pipelines.

122
00:06:41.455 --> 00:06:42.702
So with Pulumi Cloud,

123
00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:46.452
they don't actually give you
the ability to run pipelines for you.

124
00:06:46.452 --> 00:06:51.428
You have to go into your CI/CD,
have Pulumi run for

125
00:06:51.428 --> 00:06:55.379
you, and then have that whole process.

126
00:06:55.379 --> 00:07:00.511
So there is no real massive
collaborative value here.

127
00:07:00.511 --> 00:07:04.965
Again, I hope that changes, but when
we talk about what Terraform can do in

128
00:07:04.965 --> 00:07:08.076
collaboration versus right
now what Pulumi can do,

129
00:07:08.076 --> 00:07:10.353
I would say Pulumi Cloud is much more.

130
00:07:10.353 --> 00:07:14.209
If you just want something
that maintains your state and

131
00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:19.621
you have existing pipeline, you've
already got a lot of this already built,

132
00:07:19.621 --> 00:07:22.342
you just wanna plug in Pulumi, right?

133
00:07:22.342 --> 00:07:24.648
It can run in the CI and it's really easy.

134
00:07:24.648 --> 00:07:30.815
So it's great with existing pipelines and
hosting and things like that.

135
00:07:30.815 --> 00:07:32.759
Env0, Spacelift, and others.

136
00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:38.793
So why I separated Terraform and
Pulumi Cloud from these is because,

137
00:07:38.793 --> 00:07:43.067
yes, they are alternative
to Terraform Cloud.

138
00:07:43.067 --> 00:07:46.719
But on the third line is
the most important one,

139
00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:51.206
which is normally these
providers can actually run both.

140
00:07:51.206 --> 00:07:55.708
So what's really interesting about this
is these providers can say, all right,

141
00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:59.884
run some Terraform and then after that
run some Pulumi code, or after that,

142
00:07:59.884 --> 00:08:01.139
go do something else.

143
00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:04.816
So we actually evaluated Env0 at Hippo.

144
00:08:04.816 --> 00:08:06.948
It's a really good platform, I think.

145
00:08:06.948 --> 00:08:11.239
We didn't end up using it just because,
again, it didn't fit our use cases, right?

146
00:08:11.239 --> 00:08:16.288
But if we were using both Terraform and
Pulumi and we wanted to glue those

147
00:08:16.288 --> 00:08:21.255
two together, Env0, Spacelift,
these providers actually really

148
00:08:21.255 --> 00:08:25.899
do a good job of gluing those two
together, which is really nice.

149
00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:28.266
[LAUGH] So how do I choose, right?

150
00:08:28.266 --> 00:08:30.878
This is always the problem, it is,
this is always the problem.

151
00:08:30.878 --> 00:08:31.703
How do I choose?

152
00:08:31.703 --> 00:08:36.913
I get this question so
much in chat when I'm streaming.

153
00:08:36.913 --> 00:08:40.631
You seem to know all of this,
how can I know this, right?

154
00:08:40.631 --> 00:08:42.727
Well, I'm gonna show you.

155
00:08:42.727 --> 00:08:48.894
First one, like always, focus on the
problems you're actually trying to solve.

156
00:08:48.894 --> 00:08:50.466
What does that mean?

157
00:08:50.466 --> 00:08:54.765
Well, if you create an account
with Terraform Cloud,

158
00:08:54.765 --> 00:08:59.260
is that gonna get you to your
resources faster or slower?

159
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.560
If it gets you slower, don't do it,

160
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.843
[LAUGH] focus on the problem
you're trying to solve.

161
00:09:04.843 --> 00:09:07.095
Don't create new problems in the way for
you.

162
00:09:07.095 --> 00:09:11.666
And that's something that devs do a lot,
which is, we're all, I would say,

163
00:09:11.666 --> 00:09:13.343
a little bit distractible.

164
00:09:13.343 --> 00:09:17.543
[LAUGH] And everyone here I think can
agree to I started something, and

165
00:09:17.543 --> 00:09:21.889
then I got sidetracked, I went
a completely different direction, and

166
00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:24.584
then I forgot where I
originally came from.

167
00:09:24.584 --> 00:09:27.244
And then I came back to it and
then I was able to fix it, right?

168
00:09:27.244 --> 00:09:31.013
Just keep your focus on what
you're trying to solve so

169
00:09:31.013 --> 00:09:35.137
you don't have to deal with
other things to investigate.

170
00:09:35.137 --> 00:09:36.816
Focus on the tools that
you're already using.

171
00:09:36.816 --> 00:09:40.299
So if you get to the first one and
you're just like,

172
00:09:40.299 --> 00:09:44.434
you can still focus on the tools
that you're already using.

173
00:09:44.434 --> 00:09:49.589
So if your house, it's really,
really single tool use case and

174
00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:54.750
some of those other specific,
or require, what's it called?

175
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:59.048
Aspects that I mentioned earlier,
then that can help you.

176
00:09:59.048 --> 00:10:02.775
Your previous tools and how you build
things before can help you decide how you

177
00:10:02.775 --> 00:10:04.909
wanna build things going forward, right?

178
00:10:04.909 --> 00:10:07.040
And that can help you choose.

179
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.653
And then focus on the features
you need first, right?

180
00:10:10.653 --> 00:10:12.053
This is a big one.

181
00:10:12.053 --> 00:10:16.653
A lot of people, like I said before, will
look at providers and things like that and

182
00:10:16.653 --> 00:10:21.274
just see a shiny light or something,
and they'll be like, look at all these.

183
00:10:21.274 --> 00:10:23.739
But you're not gonna use
most of those things.

184
00:10:23.739 --> 00:10:26.132
[LAUGH] Most of the time people don't.

185
00:10:26.132 --> 00:10:29.383
Most of the time people will go to
a provider and be like, it's so

186
00:10:29.383 --> 00:10:32.021
awesome, but
it's almost more of a braggability thing

187
00:10:32.021 --> 00:10:34.737
than the actual practical use
of what the provider does.

188
00:10:34.737 --> 00:10:37.731
It's okay to just use a provider for
a simple use case.

189
00:10:37.731 --> 00:10:40.000
It's totally fine,
just focus on what you need.
