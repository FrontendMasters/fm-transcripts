00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.930
Beautiful, all right, so let's really
quickly go back to Terraform Cloud, and

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.315
let's go to Overview.

3
00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:08.267
Or, I'm sorry, let's go to Workspaces.

4
00:00:08.267 --> 00:00:09.204
Look at this.

5
00:00:09.204 --> 00:00:10.828
Hey, look at that.

6
00:00:10.828 --> 00:00:13.355
It's already running for me.

7
00:00:13.355 --> 00:00:19.365
Once I connected it to VCS, it went, okay,
cool, I see, we're good to go, awesome.

8
00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:23.370
So then it went in and it actually
started to try and plan for me, right?

9
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.094
It actually went in.

10
00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:29.780
So if I go into my workspace now,
this is the beauty of Terraform Cloud.

11
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.056
This is why I love Terraform Cloud.

12
00:00:32.056 --> 00:00:36.260
Because the CLI, you don't get this
experience, you know what I mean?

13
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.664
This is the collaborative part that I was
telling you about, where, okay, cool, hey,

14
00:00:40.664 --> 00:00:44.860
Erik, I just made some changes, can you go
check the pipeline for me and approve it?

15
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.029
Yeah, sure, let's do that.

16
00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:48.289
So I'm gonna click See Details.

17
00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.232
And look at this, now I can look
at my changes in this nice view.

18
00:00:52.232 --> 00:00:56.129
I can actually open this up,
see what's happening, right?

19
00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.569
But look at this, no,
it's getting reverted.

20
00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:01.397
My changes are getting reverted.

21
00:01:01.397 --> 00:01:04.289
Why, can anyone guess why?

22
00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:06.540
Has to do with state, source of truth.

23
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.730
&gt;&gt; We haven't changed
the GitHub repository yet?

24
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.600
&gt;&gt; We haven't pushed it yet.

25
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.300
Yeah, we haven't pushed our changes yet.

26
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.423
So you don't wanna actually apply this,

27
00:01:15.423 --> 00:01:18.950
otherwise you're just gonna revert
what you just applied, right?

28
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.383
And this is another one of those
chicken-before-the-egg scenarios,

29
00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:27.814
where you gotta get it to look in
a different direction before you actually

30
00:01:27.814 --> 00:01:30.043
start rolling out changes, right?

31
00:01:30.043 --> 00:01:33.380
So what we want to do is we
actually wanna commit our changes.

32
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.248
So I'm gonna say git status,

33
00:01:36.248 --> 00:01:41.306
add locals.tf main.tf
variables.tf data.tf.

34
00:01:41.306 --> 00:01:42.850
Do not add the tf-plan.

35
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.866
And again, if you wanted to, you can
add it to your gitignore later, right?

36
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:48.930
I'm gonna add those.

37
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.034
Again, I'm using a little
CLI tool called lazygit.

38
00:01:52.034 --> 00:01:56.548
I can also do git status, and

39
00:01:56.548 --> 00:02:01.450
then commit -m feat: setup.

40
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.700
We'll say, feat: setup vcs automation.

41
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.842
And then we will push that.

42
00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:21.180
Now, if we go back to Runs, refresh,
look at that, I got a new run.

43
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.710
You are now looking at
the full GitOps flow.

44
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.326
You are now seeing what happens when
Git is the source of truth, right?

45
00:02:29.326 --> 00:02:32.499
Now, if I discard, so one thing to note,

46
00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:37.685
Terraform will not run a run if
there is a previous run here, right?

47
00:02:37.685 --> 00:02:41.182
Cuz this one got planned,
and why might it do that?

48
00:02:41.182 --> 00:02:43.450
Why do you think Terraform is gonna say,
[SOUND],

49
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.509
I'm not gonna run another plan
before you have even run this one.

50
00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:48.000
Why might it do that?

51
00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.986
Terraform wants to follow the flow
of changes that you make.

52
00:02:54.986 --> 00:02:57.805
Terraform knows it's kinda
like a migration, right?

53
00:02:57.805 --> 00:03:01.525
You make some changes, then you might
make some other changes later, but

54
00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:05.140
these changes need to be here before
these changes can happen, right?

55
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.185
And so you wanna make sure
that it follows that path.

56
00:03:09.185 --> 00:03:11.856
So if you wanted to,
if you made a whole bunch,

57
00:03:11.856 --> 00:03:14.540
maybe somebody pushed five changes, right?

58
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.255
You'd go in, apply the first one,
apply the next one, apply the next one,

59
00:03:17.255 --> 00:03:17.989
apply the next one.

60
00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.764
Or you can go to the last one and

61
00:03:19.764 --> 00:03:23.760
then just tell it to discard all
the other runs and start from here.

62
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.870
Now, this is a choice that
you have to make, right?

63
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.540
Sometimes, most of the time, this is fine.

64
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.340
But if you have a set of ways that
things were changed, right, then yeah.

65
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.160
Okay, perfect, perfect, perfect.

66
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.943
The main reason why we're
running into this right now,

67
00:03:42.943 --> 00:03:48.029
from what I believe, whoa,
is because we haven't put

68
00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:52.815
any environment variables
into our configuration, so

69
00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:59.570
that it can actually talk to Terraform
Cloud the way that we want it to, right?

70
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.344
So right now in Doppler,
we have a TFE token and

71
00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:07.533
a TFE token variable, right?

72
00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:12.848
Well, the next thing we need to
do is we actually need to add

73
00:04:12.848 --> 00:04:19.040
the token that we use locally to
the workspace in the cloud, right?

74
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.966
Because that token has access to
everything, it should see everything,

75
00:04:22.966 --> 00:04:24.560
it can do everything we need.

76
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.180
The runner right now is just using
a token that it has available to it.

77
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.710
So if you wanna add a variable set, you
actually go to Settings &gt; Variable sets.

78
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:35.530
There we go.

79
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.941
And so on this page, you're gonna see
an option for Create variable set, okay?

80
00:04:40.941 --> 00:04:43.313
So I'm gonna click Create variable set.

81
00:04:43.313 --> 00:04:45.845
And then I'm gonna say fem-eci-tfe.

82
00:04:45.845 --> 00:04:52.720
This is gonna be the variable set for
our terraform-tfe workspace.

83
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.894
I'm then gonna go to Apply to workspaces,
and

84
00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:57.534
I'm gonna click the workspace
that I wanna apply it to.

85
00:04:57.534 --> 00:05:01.755
In this case it's fem-eci-tfe, okay?

86
00:05:01.755 --> 00:05:03.917
Then I'm gonna click Add variable.

87
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.682
Now you'll see that Terraform actually
allows you to add variables that

88
00:05:09.682 --> 00:05:11.800
are literal Terraform values.

89
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.510
This is a little bit of a hint of what
we're gonna be doing going forward, right?

90
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.179
But what I wanna do is I wanna add
an environment variable, right?

91
00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:24.413
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add
the environment variable TFE_TOKEN.

92
00:05:24.413 --> 00:05:28.830
And what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go to Doppler and

93
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.578
then I'm gonna copy the token
that I grabbed, right?

94
00:05:33.578 --> 00:05:38.040
So here, now I can't show it to
you now cuz I would dox myself.

95
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.393
These aren't valid tokens in here.

96
00:05:39.393 --> 00:05:42.989
But this token, you wanna copy it, right?

97
00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:45.770
So let me move this off screen for
a second so I can get that value.

98
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.960
Go here, oop, sorry,
go back to our variable set.

99
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.699
Now, if I paste this in,
you're gonna see it.

100
00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:58.259
[LAUGH] So what I'm gonna do is I'm
just gonna say what you'll have to

101
00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:02.640
do is paste it in and
then click the word Sensitive.

102
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.724
The reason why you do that is
because it will then make it so

103
00:06:05.724 --> 00:06:09.060
it's write-only and
it cannot be seen again.

104
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.929
If you don't do Sensitive, it thinks
that it's just a normal value and

105
00:06:13.929 --> 00:06:17.835
it will be able to be seen in
all sorts of different stuff.

106
00:06:17.835 --> 00:06:18.611
Go back here.

107
00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:20.913
All right,
let me get this off-screen really quick.

108
00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:22.683
Paste this in and hit Sensitive.

109
00:06:22.683 --> 00:06:26.257
And then hit Add variable at the bottom.

110
00:06:26.257 --> 00:06:30.450
Once you have that, you should have
something like that, TFE_TOKEN,

111
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.968
Sensitive overwrite, env, and
then Create variable set.

112
00:06:33.968 --> 00:06:38.027
Cool, okay, so now let's hope this works.

113
00:06:38.027 --> 00:06:41.148
[LAUGH] If we're hitting another
really weird Terraform Cloud part,

114
00:06:41.148 --> 00:06:43.310
this will probably be
the last one we would hit.

115
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.264
But let's go back to our
workspace after we've created it.

116
00:06:47.264 --> 00:06:51.691
And if I go to my workspace really
quick and I click Variables,

117
00:06:51.691 --> 00:06:55.113
I should see that TFE_TOKEN now here,
right?

118
00:06:55.113 --> 00:06:57.757
And so if I go to Run,
I wanna run a new run, and

119
00:06:57.757 --> 00:07:01.061
I wanna make sure that that
new run gets that value in it.

120
00:07:01.061 --> 00:07:03.350
So I'm gonna hit that, beautiful.

121
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.716
So again, Terraform Enterprise will
give you the ability to access

122
00:07:07.716 --> 00:07:11.320
Terraform Enterprise in
the runners by default.

123
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.660
But it might not have all
the permissions you need.

124
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.624
That's why we use our token, because our
token is the admin level that has access

125
00:07:19.624 --> 00:07:23.790
to everything and can do data lookups
that it might not be able to do.

126
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.269
But now you'll see, my plan is
finished and I have no changes, right?

127
00:07:29.269 --> 00:07:31.938
So I should have what?

128
00:07:31.938 --> 00:07:36.358
A workspace in TerraForm Cloud,
a repository in GitHub, and

129
00:07:36.358 --> 00:07:39.256
now those two synchronizing together.

130
00:07:39.256 --> 00:07:42.746
To where if I make a change here,
it'll change here, and

131
00:07:42.746 --> 00:07:46.696
those two stay in sync,
making GitOps our true source of truth.

132
00:07:46.696 --> 00:07:48.110
And we're good with that section.
