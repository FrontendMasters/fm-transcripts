1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.720
So again,
we've already set up our CLI tools, right?

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.171
We've already got Terraform installed, and
we've already got Doppler installed and

3
00:00:06.171 --> 00:00:07.460
everything's set up, right?

4
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.430
So what I'm going to do now is,
I'm gonna do a terraform init.

5
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.246
And I want you to note that I'm doing
terraform init without my Doppler

6
00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.288
command, right?

7
00:00:14.288 --> 00:00:15.750
Because as it is right now,

8
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.810
I'm not talking to terraform
cloud really whatsoever.

9
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.620
So I'm gonna do terraform init, and
then I'm gonna do terraform validate.

10
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.126
These two commands are really going to be
the two commands you start with when you

11
00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:27.546
create terraform automation.

12
00:00:27.546 --> 00:00:31.857
You want to initialize after you've
created something, so it can download all

13
00:00:31.857 --> 00:00:36.380
of the module or all the modules you're
using and all the providers you're using.

14
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.354
And so if you look at my repo, you'll see
that I have a .terraform directory, and

15
00:00:40.354 --> 00:00:42.950
inside of that I now have modules and
providers.

16
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.020
That's because Terraform just
downloads code at the end of the day.

17
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.069
These are the actual repos,
it's even got my flake files for Nicks and

18
00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:54.900
stuff like that in here, just because
it's the literal repository, right?

19
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.490
Same thing for the provider.

20
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.061
If we go all the way to the end,
that's the actual 20 megabyte binary for

21
00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.420
terraform, tfe provider.

22
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.740
So it literally just goes out and make
sure that it downloads everything for you.

23
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.980
That's what init does, right?

24
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.460
Init, right?

25
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.410
Validate will actually parse your code.

26
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.702
Now, it will not run your code
against the actual infrastructure, so

27
00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:22.939
it's not gonna tell you if it'll work from
a API level perspective, but from a syntax

28
00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.970
perspective, it will in fact tell you
what's working or what's not, right?

29
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.350
So again, if we do validate right, my
configuration is valid, so that's great.

30
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.724
Alright, so now what we want to do is
we actually want to apply this against

31
00:01:37.724 --> 00:01:39.480
Terraform Cloud, right?

32
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.590
So in this scenario, we actually want
to use our Doppler command here.

33
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.905
And the reason why we're
using our Doppler command,

34
00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:51.110
because we injected the TFE token
into our configuration, right?

35
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.830
In Doppler.

36
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.330
When I run Terraform Commands.

37
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.470
Now, it will actually be able
to connect the Terraform Cloud.

38
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.490
So I'm gonna do terraform plan, and I'm
gonna do -out note, a single dash here,

39
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.740
not a double dash, single dash and
then I'm gonna do Terraform plan.

40
00:02:07.637 --> 00:02:12.010
Now, you see when I run my plan,
I get two new resources.

41
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.473
The first is my project,
fem-ci-project under my organization,

42
00:02:17.473 --> 00:02:20.590
right, and then my workspace as well.

43
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.180
And you can see my
execution mode's been set.

44
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.460
You can see my name's been set,
organization.

45
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.740
All that good stuff.

46
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.714
So at this point, this plan looks
good we don't have any errors or

47
00:02:30.714 --> 00:02:32.230
any problems like that.

48
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.930
And so now if I wanted to,
I could actually apply this.

49
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.696
So to apply it, we really just go up,
go to the right or go to the left,

50
00:02:39.696 --> 00:02:43.155
sorry, delete everything
besides Terraform and

51
00:02:43.155 --> 00:02:48.630
the actual file name and
put apply in between Terraform and apply.

52
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.390
So the idea here is is that
we initialized, right?

53
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.190
We validated, right?

54
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.480
We planned and
now we're actually going to apply.

55
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.250
That cycle is really the whole cycle
you're going to be doing in TerraForm for

56
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.860
the rest of your experience with it.

57
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.970
Again, initialise,
validate, plan and apply.

58
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.162
So let's go ahead and apply.

59
00:03:15.973 --> 00:03:16.833
There we go.

60
00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:21.916
So if I go back to Terraform Cloud,
refresh my page.

61
00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:32.009
There we go, you can see I have
a brand-new workspace, and

62
00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.078
then underneath it,
you can see I have a project.

63
00:03:35.078 --> 00:03:39.653
Now, if I wanted to see that project I
could click this and just like before.

64
00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:42.441
Now, I can actually select
just any projects or

65
00:03:42.441 --> 00:03:46.460
any workspaces related to my
project that I created, right?

66
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.880
Now, we have a bit of organization
which is really nice.

67
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.526
The reason why we do this as
well is because in the future,

68
00:03:51.526 --> 00:03:54.370
you're probably going to
have a lot of workspaces.

69
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.965
So this will make it easier for you to
navigate when you're like what was that

70
00:03:57.965 --> 00:04:01.722
one specific component that I need access
to the really only other option you can do

71
00:04:01.722 --> 00:04:05.643
is searching workspaces and I'll be honest
it's not always helpful when like nine of

72
00:04:05.643 --> 00:04:09.237
them are named the same thing with like
one environment variable difference or

73
00:04:09.237 --> 00:04:12.178
something like that So,
I really do recommend using projects,

74
00:04:12.178 --> 00:04:15.882
they're super helpful, they're super
easy to navigate with, and honestly,

75
00:04:15.882 --> 00:04:18.860
I wish we used them at my work,
because we don't.

76
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.410
So that's why I'm telling you to use them.

77
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.103
Do as I say, not as I do.
