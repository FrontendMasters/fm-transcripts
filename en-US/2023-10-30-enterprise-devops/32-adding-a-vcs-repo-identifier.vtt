WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.052
So one more time, we're gonna take a super
quick look at what we got it, right?

2
00:00:03.052 --> 00:00:09.557
So we've added, if we go back,
we first added a new data file, right?

3
00:00:09.557 --> 00:00:12.417
Make sure you got that.

4
00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:19.227
And then we also added to our main,
the VCS repo configuration, right?

5
00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:20.081
Now, again, I apologize.

6
00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:23.545
I don't have a bunch of resolution at the
moment, so you can't see everything here,

7
00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:25.337
so I'll keep this open for
a second longer.

8
00:00:25.337 --> 00:00:30.015
&gt;&gt; Where in the code did we
define that each.value.vcs repo?

9
00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:30.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're not there yet.

10
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.198
[LAUGH] Yeah, give me a second,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

11
00:00:33.198 --> 00:00:34.518
&gt;&gt; Tricking me here too.

12
00:00:34.518 --> 00:00:35.400
&gt;&gt; It's okay, it's okay.

13
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.893
Yeah, I'm just trying to make sure
everything is updated on this one.

14
00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:42.065
So cool, we've got data,
right, we've got main.

15
00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:46.199
And then because it was flowed from,
[LAUGH] never mind, I'm just kidding.

16
00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.943
But yeah,
we're missing one other thing, right?

17
00:00:48.943 --> 00:00:53.747
We're missing one other thing, which is,
were missing our VCS repo identifier.

18
00:00:53.747 --> 00:00:58.807
What that means is that, yes,
we've told our workspace which

19
00:00:58.807 --> 00:01:04.154
ID the GitHub apps installation is,
but we also just told it that,

20
00:01:04.154 --> 00:01:09.709
hey, we're expecting a new value
from our configuration, right?

21
00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:13.538
Because the repo name might not match
the same name as the workspace,

22
00:01:13.538 --> 00:01:15.463
which in this case, it doesn't.

23
00:01:15.463 --> 00:01:22.134
So after we've added our data and
we've added the VCS, we go back to locals.

24
00:01:22.134 --> 00:01:24.101
Where do you think I go?

25
00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:24.790
&gt;&gt; Workspace.

26
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.387
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and what do you think I add?

27
00:01:28.387 --> 00:01:30.322
Y'all come on [LAUGH].

28
00:01:30.322 --> 00:01:30.946
&gt;&gt; Got that VCS.

29
00:01:30.946 --> 00:01:32.776
&gt;&gt; I gotta turn off copilot, man.

30
00:01:32.776 --> 00:01:35.802
[LAUGH] But yeah,
this is basically what we want, right?

31
00:01:35.802 --> 00:01:41.619
Now, this isn't exactly right because
it's actually terraform-tfe, right?

32
00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.274
But the VCS repo identifier
will include the name or

33
00:01:45.274 --> 00:01:50.205
owner of the repository,
as well as the repository itself, right?

34
00:01:50.205 --> 00:01:52.884
So this is the last
little bit that we need.

35
00:01:52.884 --> 00:01:58.738
So again, if I go all the way
to the beginning, data, right?

36
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.266
VCS repo, Right?

37
00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:15.850
Variables, Right?

38
00:02:19.503 --> 00:02:27.705
And then locals, Right, cool, okay.

39
00:02:27.705 --> 00:02:32.938
So now that we've got all that, what's the
first thing we do after we make changes?

40
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.916
&gt;&gt; Validate.

41
00:02:35.916 --> 00:02:37.451
&gt;&gt; Validate, yes.

42
00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:38.239
So we're gonna validate.

43
00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.862
We made a whole bunch of changes,
let's validate.

44
00:02:39.862 --> 00:02:43.636
Because as some of our
class members have learned,

45
00:02:43.636 --> 00:02:47.336
Terraform will do as far
as it can before it fails.

46
00:02:47.336 --> 00:02:50.984
So validation is always
super helpful here.

47
00:02:50.984 --> 00:02:52.375
Yeah, or at least it'll help, right?

48
00:02:52.375 --> 00:02:54.679
It might not always save you,
but it can help.

49
00:02:54.679 --> 00:03:00.087
So after we do that, then we're gonna
do a plan, right, TerraForm plan.

50
00:03:00.087 --> 00:03:05.044
And I'm gonna be honest, get comfortable
to going back to commands in shell.

51
00:03:05.044 --> 00:03:08.713
[LAUGH] You're gonna do it a lot,
up, up, up, down, down, down, and

52
00:03:08.713 --> 00:03:10.507
my personal favorite, Ctrl+R.

53
00:03:10.507 --> 00:03:12.259
And then you can actually just type in.

54
00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:16.215
So I'll do plan, and you'll notice that
sometimes it doesn't go to the one I want.

55
00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:19.078
So I just use space,
then it goes to the one I want.

56
00:03:19.078 --> 00:03:24.091
So again, you can do up, up, go the old
up fashion, the old down fashion,

57
00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:28.399
or you can do what's called back search or
back search in shell.

58
00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:30.959
And then you can actually
just do plan space, and

59
00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.089
then that should give you your command.

60
00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.945
So we hit Enter.

61
00:03:39.598 --> 00:03:41.395
Okay, so let's take a look here.

62
00:03:41.395 --> 00:03:45.862
We've got GitHub app installation ID,
identifier, ingress submodules.

63
00:03:45.862 --> 00:03:47.255
Cool, all that got added.

64
00:03:47.255 --> 00:03:55.807
But there's something else here that we
might not necessarily have that we want.

65
00:03:55.807 --> 00:03:58.410
You won't know what it is, but

66
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.334
it has to do with the execution mode
when we think about it from before.

67
00:04:04.334 --> 00:04:11.868
Right now it's set to local, but
if we connect as the VCS and

68
00:04:11.868 --> 00:04:17.606
it's set to local,
is it gonna run our code?

69
00:04:17.606 --> 00:04:18.422
&gt;&gt; No, [INAUDIBLE] not.

70
00:04:18.422 --> 00:04:19.882
&gt;&gt; It's not, yeah,
it's not, yeah, it's not.

71
00:04:19.882 --> 00:04:22.538
[LAUGH] It's just gonna see the changes,
right?

72
00:04:22.538 --> 00:04:26.797
So when I told you guys in the beginning,
set local to default, that's because it

73
00:04:26.797 --> 00:04:30.644
makes it easy for you to bootstrap
these repos and these things like that.

74
00:04:30.644 --> 00:04:33.827
But once you get an automation,
that value doesn't matter.

75
00:04:33.827 --> 00:04:36.637
We can tell it to do whatever we want.

76
00:04:36.637 --> 00:04:40.510
So there is actually one more
variable we wanna update here, and

77
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.169
it's the execution mode.

78
00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.398
We wanna set it to remote,
because now we're gonna

79
00:04:47.398 --> 00:04:54.215
tell Terraform cloud to actually
run in Terraform cloud, right?

80
00:04:54.215 --> 00:04:55.795
So now if I do a plan,

81
00:05:02.243 --> 00:05:06.773
We should see, wait, what?

82
00:05:09.922 --> 00:05:12.431
What's my problem?

83
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:13.242
&gt;&gt; It's hard-coded.

84
00:05:13.242 --> 00:05:14.686
&gt;&gt; It's hard-coded, yep.

85
00:05:14.686 --> 00:05:18.273
I messed up, right?

86
00:05:18.273 --> 00:05:20.739
Each., there you go.

87
00:05:20.739 --> 00:05:23.826
Thank you copilot.

88
00:05:23.826 --> 00:05:28.356
So again, that's why it's really important
to think about where you're adding stuff,

89
00:05:28.356 --> 00:05:31.167
and make sure that you're
doing it in the right places.

90
00:05:31.167 --> 00:05:36.172
Now we see our execution
mode set to remote, right?

91
00:05:36.172 --> 00:05:39.824
Fantastic, okay, yes.

92
00:05:39.824 --> 00:05:44.802
&gt;&gt; Is this a good pattern to define
static values in locals rather than using

93
00:05:44.802 --> 00:05:48.734
variables with TF VARs and
compute required structure?

94
00:05:48.734 --> 00:05:56.842
&gt;&gt; So I think it's good if you later
on want to override values, right?

95
00:05:56.842 --> 00:06:00.086
A lot of the stuff that I'm
using in variables, again,

96
00:06:00.086 --> 00:06:03.471
I'm using it because my
organization name might change,

97
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:08.534
my installation ID might change, my GitHub
organization name might change, right?

98
00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:13.090
So those are when I think it's valuable
to create a TF variables file,

99
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.104
put it in that.

100
00:06:14.104 --> 00:06:17.750
But right now, we're only doing this for
this one repo.

101
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.718
Going forward,

102
00:06:18.718 --> 00:06:23.430
we're actually gonna use Terraform code
to configure our workspaces, right?

103
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.972
And again,
we'll get into that in a second, but

104
00:06:25.972 --> 00:06:28.703
this is only really for
the initial bootstrapping.

105
00:06:28.703 --> 00:06:33.857
We solve configuration via
variables in the automation too.

106
00:06:33.857 --> 00:06:35.106
Let's do this one more time.

107
00:06:35.106 --> 00:06:40.366
Again, I'm gonna plan really fast,
make sure my changes are accurate, right?

108
00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:42.038
And then I'm gonna do an apply.
