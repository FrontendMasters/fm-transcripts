WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.201
So we're gonna go ahead and

2
00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:04.750
we're gonna do a couple of different
things here really quickly.

3
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.210
The next thing we really need to focus on
is our service infrastructure automation.

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.033
So if I go here, right, we see that we've
gotten pretty far, honestly, right?

5
00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:18.547
We got TFP now, we got GitHub now,
we got network, we got cluster.

6
00:00:18.547 --> 00:00:21.372
We don't have an opinionation
around our services, though,

7
00:00:21.372 --> 00:00:22.986
we have no automation around that.

8
00:00:22.986 --> 00:00:25.739
So even though we have an ECS
cluster up and running,

9
00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.189
we don't actually have automation for
that.

10
00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.151
Now, this is completely speculative.

11
00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:34.655
You can do this different ways,
it's totally up to you.

12
00:00:34.655 --> 00:00:40.301
My personal opinion is pick the scenario
that fits best for you, okay?

13
00:00:40.301 --> 00:00:44.983
What we're gonna do is,
we're gonna make one workspace that in

14
00:00:44.983 --> 00:00:49.940
the future could talk to
multiple cloud providers, okay?

15
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.125
However, if you wanted, you could also
have workspaces per cloud provider and

16
00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:58.140
follow that same pattern just like we
do with the other workspaces, right?

17
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.052
So this decision is kind of up to you,
right, but

18
00:01:01.052 --> 00:01:03.119
it is something that to consider.

19
00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.527
To make it quick for us,
I just kept everything in one repo.

20
00:01:06.527 --> 00:01:11.113
So let's go to GitHub, because remember,
we need a repository created for

21
00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:13.635
the repo that we're trying to copy from.

22
00:01:13.635 --> 00:01:18.266
So we're gonna go to, actually, sorry,
we're first going to pull, make sure we've

23
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:22.711
always got our recent changes because we
don't want to make changes accidentally,

24
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:24.290
[LAUGH] when we don't mean to.

25
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.974
And then I'm gonna create a new branch.

26
00:01:25.974 --> 00:01:34.575
Again, I'm gonna call this
feature/add-service-repo.

27
00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:39.230
And then I'm gonna go to my locals.tf,
right?

28
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.950
And I'm gonna copy and
paste from the repo.

29
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.032
Again, make sure that the visibility is
set to public if you don't see it set to

30
00:01:48.032 --> 00:01:48.900
public.

31
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.200
One other thing to note, this has
actually got a go gitignore_template.

32
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.484
Because it's a go so,
this is our actual service, right?

33
00:01:56.484 --> 00:02:01.490
This isn't automation,
this is our actual service, right?

34
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.544
So what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna create
that example product service, right?

35
00:02:06.544 --> 00:02:15.766
That's it, validate,
Feature/added-service-repository.

36
00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:19.363
Push it.

37
00:02:21.493 --> 00:02:23.000
Gh pr create.

38
00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.664
Go to our second branch or our second pr.

39
00:02:46.377 --> 00:02:49.849
And again, we might see some things
that are updating, don't worry about it.

40
00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.100
Focus on the things that we're creating,
which are these two repositories.

41
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.073
They look good, cool.

42
00:02:56.073 --> 00:03:00.236
Squash and merge, Beautiful.

43
00:03:00.236 --> 00:03:03.013
When you're really flying,
that's how quick it is.

44
00:03:03.013 --> 00:03:05.324
So yeah, cool.

45
00:03:08.082 --> 00:03:12.121
All right, now while this pipeline,
actually no, we need to wait for

46
00:03:12.121 --> 00:03:13.977
this pipeline, my apologies.

47
00:03:13.977 --> 00:03:18.213
Yeah, actually,
while this pipeline is running,

48
00:03:18.213 --> 00:03:24.820
I want you guys to also pull up the
Frontend Masters ECI service repository.

49
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.817
Now, this repository is the actual
service repo where the code exists for

50
00:03:28.817 --> 00:03:32.230
the service that we're gonna
be trying to deploy here.

51
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.340
Realistically, you wanna copy pretty
much everything in this repository.

52
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.331
So all the GitHub stuff,
the config stuff, the gitignore,

53
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:42.922
all of this needs to be copied, right?

54
00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:46.362
And so once our repository is created,
we're gonna do that.

55
00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:53.633
So if you ever find yourself in
a circumstance like this where it's just

56
00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:56.430
taking a while and you're like,
I don't know what to do,

57
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.220
you should probably just let it run.

58
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.538
The reason for that is that if
you cancel it while it's running,

59
00:04:01.538 --> 00:04:03.141
there might be state going on.

60
00:04:06.006 --> 00:04:09.864
I'm sorry, there might be state that is
still being updated or stuff like that.

61
00:04:09.864 --> 00:04:13.654
So if that's the case,
then it you could potentially cancel

62
00:04:13.654 --> 00:04:18.020
during the middle of those changes,
so I would let it just run.

63
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.364
There we go, i finally happened again.

64
00:04:19.364 --> 00:04:21.347
It just took a few seconds, no big deal.

65
00:04:21.347 --> 00:04:22.112
Yeah, okay, so

66
00:04:22.112 --> 00:04:25.520
if there was a TF cloud outage right now
then we would not be able to finish.

67
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.752
[LAUGH] And just to be fair, so yeah.

68
00:04:29.752 --> 00:04:31.162
Okay, cool so now we're applying.

69
00:04:31.162 --> 00:04:36.009
Applies normally go quicker because
plants have to go look up stuff check

70
00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.696
to see if things have changed all that
kind of stuff whereas applies can

71
00:04:40.696 --> 00:04:43.331
really just kinda do what they need to.

72
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:44.992
I'm just gonna keep refreshing here.

73
00:04:44.992 --> 00:04:48.030
There we go, here we go, created awesome.

74
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.396
So all of our repositories are created.

75
00:04:50.396 --> 00:04:52.238
So now I'm gonna clone it, right?

76
00:04:52.238 --> 00:04:54.054
I just created my service repo.

77
00:04:54.054 --> 00:04:57.683
I'm going to do git checkout
really quickly in my GitHub repo,

78
00:04:57.683 --> 00:05:00.430
pull my changes so
that I'm up to date, right?

79
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.128
And then I'm gonna go and I'm gonna
clone my last repo that we need for

80
00:05:05.128 --> 00:05:08.530
the course,
which is my ECI service repository.

81
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.708
And so here, again,

82
00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:13.903
we're gonna move really fast because
there's a few things we need to copy.

83
00:05:13.903 --> 00:05:16.975
The first one is
the GitHub workflows file.

84
00:05:16.975 --> 00:05:22.243
Now we are gonna be using GitHub workflows
underneath the hood, so it will be good

85
00:05:22.243 --> 00:05:27.524
of you to kind of get comfortable with
this bit, and look at what we've got here.

86
00:05:27.524 --> 00:05:31.917
The first thing to note is that
you'll see a registry name here.

87
00:05:31.917 --> 00:05:33.860
This is unique to you guys.

88
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.669
So this registry name, you will
have to update with the account ID

89
00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.634
of your account, right,
you cannot use my account to push images.

90
00:05:41.634 --> 00:05:45.601
But pretty much everything else but
outside of this will handle the deployment

91
00:05:45.601 --> 00:05:49.404
and the configuration of the service,
and I'll show you that in a second.

92
00:05:49.404 --> 00:05:55.632
So I'm gonna go ahead and
do new directory .github.

93
00:05:55.632 --> 00:05:58.776
Inside of that, new directory workflows.

94
00:05:58.776 --> 00:06:02.695
Inside of that, new file, main.yaml.

95
00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:04.085
I'm gonna paste in this whole thing.

96
00:06:04.085 --> 00:06:06.920
Now again, for me, this will work.

97
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.741
For you, however, this value right
here needs to be the value, sorry,

98
00:06:11.741 --> 00:06:16.257
this value right here needs to be
the value of your account, right, so

99
00:06:16.257 --> 00:06:18.872
this is your account number basically.

100
00:06:18.872 --> 00:06:24.322
So let's go ahead and save that, all
right, and then let's get the other file.

101
00:06:24.322 --> 00:06:28.365
Now again, these are all
related to the service itself.

102
00:06:28.365 --> 00:06:30.276
So we're gonna go to configs next.

103
00:06:30.276 --> 00:06:34.721
Remember how I told you that we
could keep the configuration of

104
00:06:34.721 --> 00:06:36.953
the service with the service?

105
00:06:36.953 --> 00:06:39.682
Well, this is how we're doing it,
at least for this approach.

106
00:06:39.682 --> 00:06:43.731
Now this may not be the approach you want
to take in an enterprise scenario, right?

107
00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:49.842
We can kind of say, okay, hey, let's
make some way of configuration possible.

108
00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:54.338
And then when we run the pipeline,
go get that data and apply it.

109
00:06:54.338 --> 00:06:59.130
So the only thing I really want you to
take away here is that, we have separated

110
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:04.247
configurations we've put them somewhere
else, right, somewhere is up to you.

111
00:07:04.247 --> 00:07:08.486
It can be Doppler, it can be Terraform,
it can be whatever you want, really.

112
00:07:08.486 --> 00:07:13.947
But we have separated the configs so
that they can run with the pipeline, okay?

113
00:07:13.947 --> 00:07:17.477
So what I'm gonna do is,
is I'm gonna copy this,

114
00:07:17.477 --> 00:07:21.780
new file, main.conf and
I'm gonna paste this in, right?

115
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.820
Now I have an actual configuration for
my services.

116
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.275
That means that my service is expecting
a Frontend Master instructor,

117
00:07:30.275 --> 00:07:35.910
a Frontend Master location, and a Frontend
Master version value or variables, right?

118
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.160
And then the rest of it is
pretty straightforward.

119
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.388
It's a gitignor,

120
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.950
Which already was kind of populated a bit.

121
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.536
Yeah, so exact same thing.

122
00:07:55.536 --> 00:08:00.181
Docker file, so we are using Docker, so
if you guys are curious and how we're

123
00:08:00.181 --> 00:08:04.970
actually, building the image, I would
recommend looking at the Docker file,

124
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:11.985
come on Docker file, Right, paste that in.

125
00:08:11.985 --> 00:08:16.758
Again the the contents of
these files are irrelevant.

126
00:08:16.758 --> 00:08:25.995
go.mod, And

127
00:08:25.995 --> 00:08:28.031
then finally the main.go.

128
00:08:28.031 --> 00:08:31.214
And by the way, I wanna make
a quick shout out to my coworker,

129
00:08:31.214 --> 00:08:35.413
she was actually the wonderful person
who created this example service for me.

130
00:08:35.413 --> 00:08:40.321
So, [LAUGH] shout out to him,
he's a wonderful developer and

131
00:08:40.321 --> 00:08:43.216
super nice friends, so thank you.

132
00:08:43.216 --> 00:08:45.918
Cool, so we'll save all that.

133
00:08:45.918 --> 00:08:50.602
And now,
we basically have our repository set up.

134
00:08:50.602 --> 00:08:55.912
We want to achieve the ability
to run this in Github actions,

135
00:08:55.912 --> 00:09:00.180
build the image,
push it to our ECR, right, and

136
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:05.614
then also update our configuration
files as needed, right?

137
00:09:05.614 --> 00:09:10.246
So what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna do git checkout -b

138
00:09:10.246 --> 00:09:15.523
feature/initial-commit, right,
my initial commit.

139
00:09:15.523 --> 00:09:20.903
And then I'm just gonna do this,
And add all my files, right?

140
00:09:20.903 --> 00:09:23.773
So I'm just adding all my files basically,
let's go ahead and

141
00:09:23.773 --> 00:09:26.872
just commit these first because we
need to create some automation.

142
00:09:26.872 --> 00:09:31.020
So we'll say feature
added all source files.

143
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.765
The reason why we're doing this first
is because our automation hasn't been

144
00:09:35.765 --> 00:09:40.510
necessarily created yet, right, so
we need to make sure that we do that now.

145
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.348
We just created the service repo, and

146
00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:45.140
that gives you an example of
how all that is wired up.

147
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.510
But we need to create
an automation repository for

148
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:55.972
actually handling the process of
doing our service infrastructure you.

149
00:09:55.972 --> 00:09:59.416
So I've gone ahead and
showed you how to set up a service, right?

150
00:09:59.416 --> 00:10:01.231
So let's now go ahead and make it so

151
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:03.930
that that service can exist
inside of automation.
