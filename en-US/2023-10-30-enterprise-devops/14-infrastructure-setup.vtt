1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.820
We're finally at the point where we're
actually ready to start building things.

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.900
So we're gonna build some infrastructure
between today and tomorrow.

3
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.680
And we're gonna be focusing on
a lot of different components.

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.042
So the first thing I'd like to do
is I would like to for starters,

5
00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:19.547
make sure that you know,
all the providers that we're choosing.

6
00:00:19.547 --> 00:00:23.718
So these URLs right here are all
the links that you will need.

7
00:00:23.718 --> 00:00:25.830
So, yes, we are doing things now.

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.668
These are all the links you'll
need to basically sign up for

9
00:00:28.668 --> 00:00:32.370
accounts if you dont have an account
with these specific things.

10
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.250
And if you have the slides,
feel free to do this now.

11
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.477
But what we'll need is we'll need each one
of you to make sure you have a Doppler

12
00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:45.110
account, a GitHub account, a Terraform
Cloud account, and an AWS account.

13
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.603
And we'll go through, we can go through
these more individually in a second, but

14
00:00:48.603 --> 00:00:52.070
if you want to get started on that
now you're more than welcome to.

15
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.613
You might see one of these and say like
we haven't talked about this at all,

16
00:00:55.613 --> 00:00:57.730
why is this on the list?

17
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.430
Doppler so it was brought up earlier
like how do you manage secrets?

18
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.180
Right?
Like how do you make sure you're not like

19
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.620
daxing yourself and stuff like that?

20
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.855
And for a long time,

21
00:01:06.855 --> 00:01:10.646
I didn't really have a good answer
to that [LAUGH] to be honest.

22
00:01:10.646 --> 00:01:15.244
I use vault in production like as a hashey
corpse vault as like a secret safe for

23
00:01:15.244 --> 00:01:17.437
services, but I didn't have one for

24
00:01:17.437 --> 00:01:22.490
like development like right now if we're
gonna build a whole bunch of Amazon stuff.

25
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.313
How do I make sure I don't share my
keys with you guys stuff like that and

26
00:01:28.313 --> 00:01:32.950
so yeah, the TLDR is doppler
is a CLI tool that makes it so

27
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.700
that you can inject secrets into your
CLI while you're running commands.

28
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.700
And so what you do is you go into Doppler.

29
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.880
And we'll do this again,
I'll show you in a second.

30
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.302
But you go into Doppler,

31
00:01:46.302 --> 00:01:50.571
you create a configuration with your
secrets inside of it, and then the CLI

32
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:54.978
will enable you to essentially pipe those
secrets into the environment and so

33
00:01:54.978 --> 00:01:59.400
that you can do it securely and
have a separate place for your secrets.

34
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.610
I highly recommend Doppler.

35
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.954
I really, really think it's a good product
especially if you're somebody who has dot

36
00:02:05.954 --> 00:02:10.178
files and dot m's laying around everywhere
and doesn't know how to save any of these

37
00:02:10.178 --> 00:02:14.045
things, Doppler will is a really,
really good product and it'll help you,

38
00:02:14.045 --> 00:02:18.180
at least from a developer perspective,
manage your secrets for you a lot better.

39
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.160
GitHub Actions, like I said,
there's a lot of ci, cd stuff on there.

40
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.963
I decided to go with GitHub Actions just
because source control's right next to our

41
00:02:27.963 --> 00:02:28.574
pipelines.

42
00:02:28.574 --> 00:02:30.330
What I mean it's all in one place.

43
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.390
We don't have to go and create a whole
another account or sign up another thing.

44
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.660
And so in this case it's right there.

45
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.910
We just add a file and it works.

46
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.173
And the last one,
Amazon we went with Amazon just

47
00:02:43.173 --> 00:02:47.150
because it's the most used
it's the most commonly used.

48
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.957
And a lot of the principles in
what we're gonna build should be

49
00:02:51.957 --> 00:02:56.130
easily movable to other
cloud providers if you need.

50
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.828
&gt;&gt; There's a question on
secrets in general like what I

51
00:03:00.828 --> 00:03:05.954
guess in your experience is
the biggest risk with secrets

52
00:03:05.954 --> 00:03:10.467
what are you trying to prevent cuz
&gt;&gt; Giving developers access to them.

53
00:03:10.467 --> 00:03:13.670
[LAUGH] Yeah.

54
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.650
So we don't let developers in
production touch secrets at Hippo.

55
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.596
They can touch it in any
other environment, but

56
00:03:21.596 --> 00:03:23.210
they cannot touch them in production.

57
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.060
We realized that they didn't care enough
to make it worthwhile to let them do that.

58
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.710
And it's not rudeness.

59
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.270
It's just like, it's so hard when you're
focused on building the feature to

60
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.600
then also have the energy to be like,
okay now let me deploy it.

61
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.891
And so we realized that with
production at least because it's so

62
00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:50.578
sick, like we had it's the thing we
need up all the time we decided that

63
00:03:50.578 --> 00:03:53.296
that would be something we took care of.

64
00:03:53.296 --> 00:03:57.110
And so with that, there's actual proper
policy where you have to create a ticket.

65
00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.050
You have to tell us which variables
you want, where you want them added.

66
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.000
And then we will go in and
add them for you.

67
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.090
In other environments, though,
developers can do it themselves.

68
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.150
So we have vault.

69
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.970
There's other solutions out there.

70
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.662
And they can go in and make their changes
and they basically, they can do all

71
00:04:15.662 --> 00:04:20.880
their changes before production,
to test what they want without us, right?

72
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.120
But then the moment it goes to prod,
that's when we say, okay,

73
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.230
give us the secrets and we'll update it.

74
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.315
So we just don't let them do it, yeah.

75
00:04:29.315 --> 00:04:33.880
[LAUGH] As for local dev and stuff,
we don't even use Doppler at Hippo.

76
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.990
Which is something I wish we did.

77
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.615
So at Hippo, we just good,
old-fashioned .m files and copying and

78
00:04:40.615 --> 00:04:42.380
pasting and readme docs.

79
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.983
And yeah,

80
00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:47.220
we're talking about an enterprise
company with over 150 developers.

81
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.780
It just kinda shows you that it still
is a pretty common way of doing stuff.

82
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.054
But it also goes to show you that
that's not something that's trying

83
00:04:58.054 --> 00:04:59.400
to be improved.

84
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.201
So we took that responsibility and we said
alright if it's prod you have to follow

85
00:05:04.201 --> 00:05:07.440
through us if anything else
just break it yourself.

86
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.450
Our motto really is, if it's
pre-production, break it, we don't care.

87
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.880
Prod is the only thing
we really care about.

88
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.149
So yeah, I do think that if
you're gonna have secrets though,

89
00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:22.062
at least at your company, using
a service like Vault, or even Doppler,

90
00:05:22.062 --> 00:05:25.150
something that can store them for you.

91
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.280
And have a database around that and
stuff like that, even in versioning.

92
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.120
If you change a secret and then you're
like, no, what was that last secret?

93
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.550
I got a revert.

94
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.900
That's things Doppler things like
that Vault can help you with that.

95
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.290
So, secrets again, they're massively,
they're intrinsic on two things.

96
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.551
One, your implementation, like how you're
deploying software, all that kinda stuff,

97
00:05:46.551 --> 00:05:48.770
and then two, your security policies.

98
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.910
How often are you gonna rotate your
secrets, who has access to them,

99
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:52.790
things like that.

100
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.337
So I really do hope that we start
using Doppler more at Hippo,

101
00:05:56.337 --> 00:05:59.410
because you can do that with Doppler,
for example.

102
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.260
You can have teams, you can have users,
and then you can have configs.

103
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.488
And the idea is, is what we'll show you in
a minute is you can create a config for

104
00:06:07.488 --> 00:06:11.846
service and then give only specific users
access to that config and Doppler, and

105
00:06:11.846 --> 00:06:15.210
then they can manage that and
update it and it'll be dynamic.

106
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.400
And not only that,
then they can run it locally.

107
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.220
And it's all in one place and
really easy to manage so

108
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.080
hopefully we'll do that in the future but
yeah we don't even do that yet
