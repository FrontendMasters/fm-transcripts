00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.130
So we've created our workspace, right?

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.540
However, there's a bit of a problem here.

3
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.320
The big problem is that
our state is local, right?

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.400
So right now, if I was like,
all right, cool, see you guys,

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.240
have a good one, right?

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.160
And my laptop destroyed somehow
the state's gone, right?

7
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.519
And if there was thousands of repost or
thousands of resources and

8
00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.540
stuff like that,
I'd be kind of in a bad state, right?

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.150
Get it?

10
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.590
What we wanna do is, is we wanna
move that state to the cloud, right?

11
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.850
So that we don't have to worry about
where it is and it's safety essentially.

12
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.040
And so to do that, we're gonna
click on our workspace, actually.

13
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.101
And you'll notice that there's a nice
little documentation set here where it

14
00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:43.141
actually includes some example code.

15
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:45.810
This is what's called a back end file,
right?

16
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.477
The idea here is is that right
now if we look at my code,

17
00:00:49.477 --> 00:00:53.350
I'm not actually pointing
my state to anything.

18
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.523
That's why it's local.

19
00:00:54.523 --> 00:00:58.401
But if I wanna make it so that my state
is actually pointed to something,

20
00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:02.310
I create a backend.tf file or
basically this file right here.

21
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.802
So I'm gonna copy this,
say new file backend.tf, and

22
00:01:06.802 --> 00:01:09.740
then I'm gonna edit that file.

23
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.301
And again, you should have this in
your workspace if you just created it,

24
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:18.720
so you can copy this,
paste it in and save it.

25
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.124
So now you should have a back end.tf file,
a main.tf file and

26
00:01:25.124 --> 00:01:27.842
a variables.tf file, all right?

27
00:01:27.842 --> 00:01:31.758
These are the three files that we need to
be able to not just automate our things,

28
00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.349
but also push them to the cloud.

29
00:01:36.243 --> 00:01:39.990
All right, so now what we're gonna do is,
is we're gonna init one more time.

30
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.547
Can anyone tell me why I might
need to initialize one more time?

31
00:01:44.636 --> 00:01:46.480
&gt;&gt; Migrate the state.

32
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.238
&gt;&gt; Yes, and the main reason why we
initialize is because when we initialize

33
00:01:51.238 --> 00:01:55.200
it, does that initial reach
out to Terraform Cloud.

34
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.459
So that's another reason why you
initialize, is because it makes it so

35
00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.718
that your backend's properly set up,
everything in your workspace or

36
00:02:01.718 --> 00:02:04.280
your environment is basically good to go.

37
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.923
So this time, however, you'll notice that
when I go back to my Terraform in it,

38
00:02:07.923 --> 00:02:10.220
I'm actually gonna put
Doppler in front of here.

39
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.390
Can anyone tell me why I put
Doppler in front of here?

40
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.640
&gt;&gt; Cuz you're gonna put
it in HashiCorp's cloud.

41
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.000
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, yeah.

42
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.154
So we're gonna do Doppler run, Terraform
in it, and then what we want it to do is

43
00:02:22.154 --> 00:02:25.998
because Doppler has the credentials
inside of it, we want Doppler to pass

44
00:02:25.998 --> 00:02:30.099
the Terraform cloud credentials and
then make it so that we can initialize it.

45
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.485
And sure enough As we initialize
TerraForm cloud goes, Hey, well,

46
00:02:36.485 --> 00:02:39.760
wait a minute,
I see that you have state locally.

47
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.120
Would you like us to migrate your
existing state to the cloud?

48
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.410
And sure enough, I can hit it.

49
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:52.780
I can type in yes, hit Enter There we go.

50
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.340
My state is now in the cloud.

51
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.660
So if we go back to our repo really
quickly, look at my TF state file.

52
00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.641
it's completely empty now.

53
00:02:59.641 --> 00:03:03.153
And if I even open it up there's
there's nothing in here, right?

54
00:03:03.153 --> 00:03:07.903
And so what we wanna do is is we wanna
really just delete all of these files,

55
00:03:07.903 --> 00:03:09.371
the three files here.

56
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:12.602
Now note one of these says
terraform.tf state backup.

57
00:03:12.602 --> 00:03:15.005
You might not wanna delete this file.

58
00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:19.197
[LAUGH] If you're in a circumstance where
you're initializing a repo that had a lot

59
00:03:19.197 --> 00:03:23.670
of resources in it already, you wanna make
sure that it's there, stuff like that.

60
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.570
It might be worth backing it up.

61
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.880
However, don't commit
it to the repository.

62
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.562
There are secrets and other things
that could potentially be in there and

63
00:03:31.562 --> 00:03:34.230
it would expose,
if you just committed that to Git.

64
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.350
So let's just delete these.

65
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.110
Right?
And then let's do a plan one more time.

66
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.750
So terraform plan.

67
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.825
And again, I'm gonna put doppler run
in front of it, because going forward,

68
00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:49.940
I need to be able to communicate
with Terraform Cloud.

69
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.930
If I can't,
then this will fail, all right?

70
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.216
So for example, if I actually Go here,
and then I hit enter,

71
00:03:56.216 --> 00:03:58.910
you'll see that I fail, right?

72
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:06.200
But if I do doppler run,
It'll actually work, right?

73
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.270
Because we're passing
in those credentials.

74
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.570
So you'll notice that it says,
hey, you got no changes.

75
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.310
Your infrastructure matches
the configuration, right?

76
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.280
Awesome, there we go.

77
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.658
We have officially set up our
repository in TerraForm cloud and

78
00:04:17.658 --> 00:04:21.035
we have automation running against
it with state in the cloud so

79
00:04:21.035 --> 00:04:23.475
that we don't have to
worry about anything.

80
00:04:23.475 --> 00:04:25.850
So that's the first step
of what we wanna do.
