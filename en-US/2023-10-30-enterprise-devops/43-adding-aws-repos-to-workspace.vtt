WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.140
So now what do we have?

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.814
Well, we have an automation repo for
an aws-network, and

3
00:00:05.814 --> 00:00:09.656
we have an automation repo for
an aws-cluster.

4
00:00:09.656 --> 00:00:13.568
So here again is one of the great
parts about automation.

5
00:00:13.568 --> 00:00:20.096
Once you create your automation repos,
you can essentially deploy them, right?

6
00:00:20.096 --> 00:00:24.899
Now, there's a couple of things we know,
which is we know we need workspaces.

7
00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.357
We know we need to connect it to VCS, and

8
00:00:27.357 --> 00:00:31.692
we also know at some point we have
to configure these things, right?

9
00:00:31.692 --> 00:00:32.746
So we gotta do all three of these.

10
00:00:32.746 --> 00:00:35.601
We gotta create repos,
we got to connect them to VCS,

11
00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:38.393
and then we have to add
the environment variables and

12
00:00:38.393 --> 00:00:41.580
all the other variables we need so
that it can run properly.

13
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.642
Cuz right now, if it tried connecting
to Amazon, do you think it would work?

14
00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:46.338
&gt;&gt; Probably not.

15
00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:49.389
&gt;&gt; Probably not, yeah,
because we don't have any of that, yeah.

16
00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:55.622
So what we're gonna do, is we're
gonna go back into our main tfe repo.

17
00:00:55.622 --> 00:01:00.676
Make sure to pull in so you got your
latest changes, and then git checkout- b.

18
00:01:00.676 --> 00:01:05.043
And this one we're gonna call
feature/add-resources or addworkspaces,

19
00:01:05.043 --> 00:01:06.863
we'll call it addworkspaces.

20
00:01:06.863 --> 00:01:13.952
So feature/addworkspaces, okay,
so now we're on a new branch.

21
00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:18.687
What file do you think I would go into?

22
00:01:18.687 --> 00:01:19.384
&gt;&gt; Locals.

23
00:01:19.384 --> 00:01:20.978
&gt;&gt; Locals, exactly, yep.

24
00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:26.478
Now, I'm gonna copy and
paste some code here, but

25
00:01:26.478 --> 00:01:30.818
remember, always reference
the branch in the repo if you need.

26
00:01:30.818 --> 00:01:35.897
All right, so you can go to the FEM1,
this is cluster,

27
00:01:35.897 --> 00:01:42.770
let me go to the Terraform one,

28
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.691
yeah, tfe and

29
00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:52.885
if we go to 5 we should
be able to go to locals,

30
00:01:52.885 --> 00:01:58.436
and if we keep scrolling, look at this.

31
00:01:58.436 --> 00:02:01.498
Whoa, wait a minute, variables?

32
00:02:01.498 --> 00:02:03.930
What do you mean variables?

33
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.878
This is another great
part about Terraform.

34
00:02:06.878 --> 00:02:11.628
We don't need to add variables anywhere
else because Terraform Cloud can

35
00:02:11.628 --> 00:02:12.861
store variables.

36
00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:17.197
So what this means is all you have to do
is create a repository for your automation

37
00:02:17.197 --> 00:02:21.419
and then deploy it to a workspace, and
that's exactly what we're gonna do.

38
00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:25.321
So I'm gonna copy this workspace,
the ECI AWS network workspace and

39
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:28.290
then I'm gonna copy
the cluster workspace as well.

40
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.933
There's two of them there,
ECI cluster, an ECI AWS network, okay?

41
00:02:33.933 --> 00:02:39.241
And remember, this is in the terraform-tfe
repo under the fifth branch, yes.

42
00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:42.490
&gt;&gt; I do you notice the second
one is titled cluster prod?

43
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.539
&gt;&gt; Yep, as we said before,
the cluster has to be an environment.

44
00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:52.207
And we've also said that we can't have the
same name for the same resource twice, so

45
00:02:52.207 --> 00:02:56.646
we have to put a unique separator there,
which in this case is the environment.

46
00:03:00.973 --> 00:03:04.047
So I'm gonna paste all of that in.

47
00:03:04.047 --> 00:03:06.593
I'm gonna just double check everything,
make sure it all looks good.

48
00:03:06.593 --> 00:03:13.264
So remote, look at this already set to
remote, bam, out of the box, right?

49
00:03:13.264 --> 00:03:17.701
Because there's nothing needed, it knows
the automation that it needs to look at,

50
00:03:17.701 --> 00:03:19.210
and it's just gonna run it.

51
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.035
Now, the important change or
difference is this part right here,

52
00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:25.508
we haven't introduced this yet, right?

53
00:03:25.508 --> 00:03:30.133
This is what makes it so that you
can programmatically configure your

54
00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:33.175
workspaces without having
to go into the UI.

55
00:03:33.175 --> 00:03:37.197
This also makes it so
that if you wanna rename a network or

56
00:03:37.197 --> 00:03:40.033
anything else, you actually go here.

57
00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:45.181
There's no need for a workspace for the
specific repo and one to one and all that

58
00:03:45.181 --> 00:03:50.642
stuff because we're gonna make a lot of
networks potentially in the future right?

59
00:03:50.642 --> 00:03:54.867
So what we're really trying to do is is
we're trying to make a multi use repo, and

60
00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:58.556
then just attach workspaces to it
with different variables, right?

61
00:03:58.556 --> 00:04:03.590
And that'll make it so
that we have different networks, okay?

62
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.694
So in this case we have our variables
array and then inside of it

63
00:04:08.694 --> 00:04:13.613
we have a terraform value, so
it says category terraform.

64
00:04:13.613 --> 00:04:17.407
Remember how we had environment
variables and terraform variables?

65
00:04:17.407 --> 00:04:21.220
This is how you differentiate those two,
if I wanted to have an environment

66
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.291
variables, I would just say M or
environment, one or two, I don't remember.

67
00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:29.255
HCL is important in
circumstances like this.

68
00:04:29.255 --> 00:04:34.615
When you have like an array, or an object,
or a map, or something like that,

69
00:04:34.615 --> 00:04:40.396
that requires parsing, you actually have
to tell it that it's an HCL or HCL value.

70
00:04:40.396 --> 00:04:44.971
That's because you can also do not, you
just do basic strings and stuff like that.

71
00:04:44.971 --> 00:04:49.259
So if you're doing in a scenario where
you're like I wanna pass an array to my

72
00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:53.212
workspace then I want to do that
through Terraform cloud you would then

73
00:04:53.212 --> 00:04:56.445
make sure that it's an HCL
variable that you're using.

74
00:04:56.445 --> 00:04:59.238
You'll notice that on
the second one though,

75
00:04:59.238 --> 00:05:02.970
I don't have that I just have
category key and value, right?

76
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.386
That's because these ones,
these aren't HCL values and

77
00:05:07.386 --> 00:05:13.061
remember I told you before there's a way
to where you can actually make it so

78
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:16.049
that there are like the same defaults.

79
00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:18.662
So you don't always have
to add these values.

80
00:05:18.662 --> 00:05:23.263
So to make that work,
there is one other change we need to do,

81
00:05:23.263 --> 00:05:26.530
which is we need to go
to the main.tf file.

82
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:33.362
And if you scroll down,
we'll see that we now have a try and

83
00:05:33.362 --> 00:05:38.535
a variable is being
added to our workspace.

84
00:05:38.535 --> 00:05:39.162
See that?

85
00:05:41.812 --> 00:05:47.049
So I'm gonna go to main, And

86
00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:50.595
then I'm gonna paste in my variables.

87
00:05:50.595 --> 00:05:56.726
Now this try is a nice little
function that Terraform provides.

88
00:05:56.726 --> 00:06:00.827
Which will make it so
that if this is not even populated,

89
00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:06.612
it will return with an array at least,
so it doesn't break anything, right?

90
00:06:06.612 --> 00:06:09.195
So that's why we put the try there.

91
00:06:09.195 --> 00:06:12.021
We don't have to put tries for
anything else,

92
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:16.959
because technically those variables
are being passed to the variables module.

93
00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:21.098
So that module then must have
tries inside of it to know for

94
00:06:21.098 --> 00:06:25.497
the circumstances of when we
are using the HCl value or not and

95
00:06:25.497 --> 00:06:29.571
stuff like that so
that's very helpful for us, right?

96
00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:33.419
So that's the network and on top of it
that's also us make making sure that

97
00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:36.229
the workspace is wired in
the way that we need, okay?

98
00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.256
So let's go back to this really
quickly and let's look at the cluster.

99
00:06:39.256 --> 00:06:42.792
Because again, like you said, there was
a couple interesting things about this

100
00:06:42.792 --> 00:06:44.517
workspace compared to the other ones.

101
00:06:44.517 --> 00:06:48.723
For starters, it's got an environment
attached to it, right?

102
00:06:48.723 --> 00:06:52.201
Well, the reason for
this is because if I did this and

103
00:06:52.201 --> 00:06:56.092
then I tried to create multiple clusters,
would it work?

104
00:06:56.092 --> 00:07:01.206
Nope, we'd have a conflict, so there still
is a bit of work that you have to do here.

105
00:07:01.206 --> 00:07:05.916
Now I'm gonna show you a little later how
we can even save ourselves more time, but

106
00:07:05.916 --> 00:07:10.420
I think you might even start seeing how
that's possible, right, with our for

107
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.006
loops and stuff like that.

108
00:07:12.006 --> 00:07:14.715
I showed you it with AZs and
subnets, right,

109
00:07:14.715 --> 00:07:18.006
all that kind of stuff,
it's the same paradigm here.

110
00:07:18.006 --> 00:07:23.648
Now, if we go to the cluster, you'll see
that cluster also has variables, right?

111
00:07:23.648 --> 00:07:26.717
And one of them is our don't look at that,

112
00:07:26.717 --> 00:07:30.328
it's the variables that
was in our repository.

113
00:07:30.328 --> 00:07:35.308
So let's take a quick step back one more
time and look at our chart, all right?

114
00:07:35.308 --> 00:07:40.276
So we've got TerraForm cloud and then
we've got our workspaces down here, right?

115
00:07:40.276 --> 00:07:45.881
You mustn't forget that this guy is gonna
go back, so that it can come back down and

116
00:07:45.881 --> 00:07:49.845
change other things And

117
00:07:49.845 --> 00:07:56.116
we said in the network module that we
wanna make this customizable, right?

118
00:07:56.116 --> 00:08:00.964
We can, in Terraform TFV,
it does not just become something

119
00:08:00.964 --> 00:08:06.097
that manages workspaces, but
it's also the source of truth for

120
00:08:06.097 --> 00:08:12.014
pretty much most of your configuration
of your infrastructure, right?

121
00:08:12.014 --> 00:08:15.500
These repositories
are meant to be dynamic.

122
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.305
They're meant to be plug and
play where I could give you it and

123
00:08:18.305 --> 00:08:20.840
you could run it just like
like we're doing right now.

124
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.659
The only thing that makes them unique to
you is the variables that you pass to

125
00:08:25.659 --> 00:08:27.275
the workspace, right?

126
00:08:27.275 --> 00:08:31.464
So in this circumstance what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna give myself a domain, so

127
00:08:31.464 --> 00:08:34.667
I'm gonna say, okay,
well I own the domain altofor.dev.

128
00:08:34.667 --> 00:08:37.710
So that's what my cluster
is gonna point to, right?

129
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:42.681
Anything on this domain when
we set it up for a service,

130
00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:47.664
it will then be something
like service.altifordev.

131
00:08:47.664 --> 00:08:52.875
We have ingress routing out of the box.

132
00:08:52.875 --> 00:08:58.133
Let me say that one more time for
you guys, we have ingress routing

133
00:08:58.133 --> 00:09:03.502
out of the box, this is very difficult and
annoying to do, right?

134
00:09:03.502 --> 00:09:07.504
But when you can think about like okay,
the cluster needs this, it needs that,

135
00:09:07.504 --> 00:09:09.056
it needs this, it needs that,

136
00:09:09.056 --> 00:09:12.431
it's just really easy to reproduce
these environments, right?

137
00:09:12.431 --> 00:09:15.286
So we know that our environment is prod,
right?

138
00:09:15.286 --> 00:09:18.612
And then the other thing you'll see
here is is it wants me to actually name

139
00:09:18.612 --> 00:09:19.274
the cluster.

140
00:09:19.274 --> 00:09:22.493
So I'm gonna put my name in here,
so I'm just gonna say E-Reinert.

141
00:09:22.493 --> 00:09:27.723
I recommend you guys doing the same, and
to be honest, they need to be unique

142
00:09:27.723 --> 00:09:33.561
because for this course, it's just to make
sure that you don't run over anything.

143
00:09:33.561 --> 00:09:38.054
So just give it your name,
first initial, last name, and

144
00:09:38.054 --> 00:09:43.188
then the last thing we're gonna do is,
is we're gonna create a VPC

145
00:09:43.188 --> 00:09:48.158
name variable that points
to our F-E-M-E-C-I-V-P-C.

146
00:09:48.158 --> 00:09:50.104
Well, where is that?

147
00:09:50.104 --> 00:09:53.471
You might ask, do you see it?

148
00:09:53.471 --> 00:09:55.491
What line is it on?

149
00:09:55.491 --> 00:09:57.902
What line is that workspace referencing?

150
00:10:01.287 --> 00:10:06.266
&gt;&gt; WPC name four, three lines above
&gt;&gt; The network name,

151
00:10:06.266 --> 00:10:11.061
yeah, so the network name here, right,

152
00:10:11.061 --> 00:10:17.226
is now being used as the VPC name for
the cluster here.

153
00:10:17.226 --> 00:10:19.772
See how those legos connect?

154
00:10:19.772 --> 00:10:23.402
This is why we create our own modules and

155
00:10:23.402 --> 00:10:27.475
create our own opinions around variables.

156
00:10:27.475 --> 00:10:30.522
Because if you try and
just use resources every time,

157
00:10:30.522 --> 00:10:35.479
you're just gonna constantly fall into
problems, because they are so generalized.

158
00:10:35.479 --> 00:10:39.382
That it's better for
you to make opinions around them and

159
00:10:39.382 --> 00:10:42.480
then keep making those
opinions on your own.

160
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.744
Instead of saying like I'm just gonna
always keep using the same resources and

161
00:10:46.744 --> 00:10:51.219
just juggling all this stuff, make it
easier on yourself, wrap them in a module.

162
00:10:51.219 --> 00:10:53.782
Give it some inputs give
it some outputs and

163
00:10:53.782 --> 00:10:58.409
then make it a workspace make it
composable, right, that's the goal here,

164
00:10:58.409 --> 00:11:02.056
high composability,
that's really what we want, right?

165
00:11:02.056 --> 00:11:03.500
Do we need the domain to be a route?

166
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:08.441
No, to be honest the domain does nothing
here [LAUGH] It's not actually attached to

167
00:11:08.441 --> 00:11:09.167
anything.

168
00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:14.071
It's just so that we can have
a domain value there to use, so

169
00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:17.515
it just has to be a valid
top level domain.

170
00:11:17.515 --> 00:11:22.995
So now that I've explained to you guys,
why we're doing what we're doing,

171
00:11:22.995 --> 00:11:26.978
right, let's provision some
infrastructure [LAUGH].

172
00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:31.049
So we're gonna do init really quick,
just to make sure, I'm sorry,

173
00:11:31.049 --> 00:11:34.649
not init my about validate,
validate, do validate, cool.

174
00:11:34.649 --> 00:11:40.479
So the validate looks good,
awesome, so now let's commit.

175
00:11:40.479 --> 00:11:48.492
So let's do, Yeah, git add.

176
00:11:48.492 --> 00:11:49.192
What were the files?

177
00:11:49.192 --> 00:11:54.182
Sorry, git status,
git add, locals, and main,

178
00:11:54.182 --> 00:11:59.173
git status git commit-m added resource or
added,

179
00:11:59.173 --> 00:12:04.180
we'll say added workspaces and
then we'll push.

180
00:12:12.196 --> 00:12:15.534
Create a PR, again,
you can navigate to the repo if you want.

181
00:12:20.945 --> 00:12:25.419
Now, it's funny [LAUGH] is
you're like five repos in, and

182
00:12:25.419 --> 00:12:28.447
this is your first PR to Terraform tfe.

183
00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:32.961
[LAUGH] So that gives you an idea
of how much is required to set up

184
00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:37.221
before you can actually get
into this approval process.

185
00:12:37.221 --> 00:12:38.927
But if we look here, okay,

186
00:12:38.927 --> 00:12:43.841
cool here's all my changes let's go to
my up that's good that's a good sign.

187
00:12:43.841 --> 00:12:48.170
So let's look here,
let's take a look at the plan, wow,

188
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.049
look at this automation, man, so nice.

189
00:12:51.049 --> 00:12:55.697
So because we're using the module
underneath to create workspaces,

190
00:12:55.697 --> 00:12:58.227
it has other automation inside of it.

191
00:12:58.227 --> 00:13:01.167
So it knows, hey,
I'll make this variable for

192
00:13:01.167 --> 00:13:04.852
you called azs, we'll go ahead and
populate that for you.

193
00:13:04.852 --> 00:13:08.410
We'll do the same thing for cidr,
we'll do the same thing for name, right?

194
00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:12.527
And then the cluster gets
to the exact same thing,

195
00:13:12.527 --> 00:13:17.245
variable set, environment,
name, BPC name, right?

196
00:13:17.245 --> 00:13:22.781
Cool, okay, so this looks good,
let's go back to our PR and

197
00:13:22.781 --> 00:13:26.379
we're just gonna confirm and squash.

198
00:13:33.161 --> 00:13:37.589
So now that we've merged our first PR to
terraform tfe, let's see what happens.

199
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:47.574
&gt;&gt; So it only does the plan on a branch,
but it doesn't let you commit.

200
00:13:47.574 --> 00:13:52.170
&gt;&gt; Branches are just for tests, merging to
main will let you actually apply it, yeah.
