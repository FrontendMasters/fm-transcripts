00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.169
Yeah, a couple of questions in the chat.

2
00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.792
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

3
00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:08.575
&gt;&gt; One is, what happens if we
delete one repo from locals in our

4
00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:13.657
GitHub automation repo will
Terraform delete this repo also?

5
00:00:13.657 --> 00:00:16.476
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, 100% yes.

6
00:00:16.476 --> 00:00:21.393
We talked about this yesterday, actually
just like in the off time, it will.

7
00:00:21.393 --> 00:00:24.861
Yeah, Terraform is literal one to one,
so if it's there, it'll be there, and

8
00:00:24.861 --> 00:00:26.090
if it's not, it won't be.

9
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.951
My personal recommendation is to disable
the ability to delete repos, right?

10
00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:35.681
Or make sure that you have
scoped permissions or,

11
00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.347
basically follow an archive pattern,
is good.

12
00:00:38.347 --> 00:00:43.677
GitHub does have archival options and
so you could basically say don't delete

13
00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:48.857
anything, but make an archive option
available to the repos in the config.

14
00:00:48.857 --> 00:00:53.977
And then every repo you want you
would just set archive to true.

15
00:00:53.977 --> 00:00:58.071
And this is actually what we do at GitHub,
I'm sorry, what we do at Hippo.

16
00:00:58.071 --> 00:01:03.401
So if I was to go here at Hippo,
actually here,

17
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:07.776
I can show you like a 5,000 foot,

18
00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:13.961
I'll just go to our repos
really quickly to show you.

19
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:17.817
So if I go to my Hippo, Hippo,
Analytics-Inc, and then let's go to,

20
00:01:17.817 --> 00:01:20.991
[MUSIC]

21
00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:24.446
Here, search, Analytics-Inc.

22
00:01:24.446 --> 00:01:32.828
I wanna to go to github, Terraform-github,
this is what our repo looks like.

23
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.565
And you can see every file is a different
set of repos that we're trying to

24
00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:41.586
solve problems with, right?

25
00:01:41.586 --> 00:01:44.457
And so, for example,
if I was to go to ops repos, which

26
00:01:44.457 --> 00:01:48.969
is the ones that I normally manage, here's
the layers of configurations that we do.

27
00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.588
So, we have like default ops
permissions for push and admin.

28
00:01:53.588 --> 00:01:57.069
We have specific providers because
we have different accounts.

29
00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:00.136
We'll have branching schemes and
enable branch protection.

30
00:02:00.136 --> 00:02:04.609
And these are lower-level logic,
right, in the HCL.

31
00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.517
Topics, branching scheme, context,

32
00:02:06.517 --> 00:02:09.834
right, some of the things that we
haven't even really talked about.

33
00:02:09.834 --> 00:02:15.329
But again, if I go into this search and
I search for the word archive.

34
00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:16.044
Yeah, there it is.

35
00:02:16.044 --> 00:02:20.741
We have an archived true, and so it won't
delete it, but it'll at least make it so

36
00:02:20.741 --> 00:02:23.414
that the repository isn't managed anymore.

37
00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:28.887
&gt;&gt; Is there a reason not to just create
a global variable set applied to all or

38
00:02:28.887 --> 00:02:32.041
some workspaces with the tokens needed?

39
00:02:33.915 --> 00:02:35.288
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you wanted to.

40
00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:37.706
We're only going through it
step by step for the course.

41
00:02:37.706 --> 00:02:44.736
So yeah, the layers of automation that
you wanna do, it's totally up to you.

42
00:02:44.736 --> 00:02:50.342
A lot of the step-by-step is really to
show you why we're doing what we're doing.

43
00:02:50.342 --> 00:02:54.509
Going forward you could, yeah,
you could do that for sure, yeah.

44
00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:57.502
&gt;&gt; And
if you want to archive a repository,

45
00:02:57.502 --> 00:03:02.174
how could this fit in the current
module setup with Terraform?

46
00:03:02.174 --> 00:03:06.734
&gt;&gt; So if you wanted to archive a
repository what you would do is you would

47
00:03:06.734 --> 00:03:07.378
go here.

48
00:03:07.378 --> 00:03:11.479
You would, I'm gonna be honest,
I don't know if I've made it so

49
00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:14.775
you can archive repos with
this particular module.

50
00:03:14.775 --> 00:03:20.915
So you might, Yeah, so I haven't
added archiving support with this.

51
00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:24.529
But if we go back to the GitHub,
and this is where like, again,

52
00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:29.033
sometimes it's nice to use a provider,
sometimes it's nice to use a module,

53
00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:32.260
sometimes that module might
not give you what you want.

54
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.960
So in this case,
I would actually go to GitHub, Terraform,

55
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.568
look at the provider here, and
then I would be like, okay,

56
00:03:41.568 --> 00:03:44.261
where's our repo, repository?

57
00:03:47.463 --> 00:03:48.674
There it is.

58
00:03:48.674 --> 00:03:52.049
And then scroll down
until you see archived.

59
00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.843
Yeah, and so this value would then be
what you would use on the resource and

60
00:03:58.843 --> 00:04:03.885
then you'd go to locals and
then you'd add archived,

61
00:04:03.885 --> 00:04:07.733
true or false basically up here, right?

62
00:04:07.733 --> 00:04:11.461
Archived, Bam, right?

63
00:04:11.461 --> 00:04:15.602
And then you can even do things like
defaults where there is the ability to say

64
00:04:15.602 --> 00:04:19.678
like if it doesn't exist then just set
it to not archive so that you only have

65
00:04:19.678 --> 00:04:23.519
archived in there, but that's
basically how you would do it, yeah.
