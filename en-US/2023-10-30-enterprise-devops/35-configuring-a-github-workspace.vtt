WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.372
So here's what we wanna do, right?

2
00:00:02.372 --> 00:00:07.915
Now that we've got our repository created
we can actually go back to our terraform

3
00:00:07.915 --> 00:00:12.996
automation now because half of the work
is actually already done, right?

4
00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:16.644
So the first part of the work that we did
before was like setting up terraform and

5
00:00:16.644 --> 00:00:20.200
all that stuff but that's done right,
and we just created the repository.

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.512
So all we really need to do now, right,

7
00:00:24.512 --> 00:00:30.548
is add the workspace with
its configuration, right?

8
00:00:30.548 --> 00:00:36.284
So I'm gonna go to locals, and
then I'm going to add a new workspace,

9
00:00:36.284 --> 00:00:39.504
let me copy and paste it from over here.

10
00:00:39.504 --> 00:00:41.830
I'm gonna add a new workspace.

11
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.700
For GitHub, and
I'm gonna call it femeci github, right?

12
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.518
Now note my little comment there which
is I'm setting it to local first.

13
00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:55.727
Can anyone tell me or
suggest think why am I be doing this?

14
00:00:55.727 --> 00:00:57.376
&gt;&gt; Debugging?

15
00:00:57.376 --> 00:00:58.168
Close.

16
00:00:58.168 --> 00:00:58.800
Close.

17
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.859
&gt;&gt; There's no state first time.

18
00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.242
&gt;&gt; There's no state first time.

19
00:01:01.242 --> 00:01:04.080
Exactly, because there's no state or
anything like that.

20
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.080
Like there's no automation in
the repository hasn't been set up yet.

21
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.072
There's no environment variables in
the cloud, so we know it's gonna fail.

22
00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:15.619
So we have to at least start where
a scenario where we're not just gonna

23
00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.070
immediately fail in front.

24
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.972
So to do that we're gonna go to now
this is where the organization name

25
00:01:21.972 --> 00:01:24.264
can actually be super helpful.

26
00:01:24.264 --> 00:01:27.319
So you'll see in my first one
I have my main name right but

27
00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.319
in this one I actually am
using the organization name.

28
00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:35.991
That's because I'm making an opinionation
here where I'm saying you

29
00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:42.418
know what let's just make it so that every
time I wanna use my main organization,

30
00:01:42.418 --> 00:01:46.316
I'll just use,
the GitHub organization name.

31
00:01:46.316 --> 00:01:49.390
So that's why we added it previously.

32
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.750
Was this because going forward,
I don't wanna like anything that's due.

33
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.126
You'll notice that almost
nothing here is duplicate.

34
00:01:56.126 --> 00:01:59.610
Right, unless we're trying
to make it be that.

35
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.718
So in this case because we're not, right,

36
00:02:02.718 --> 00:02:06.419
we can do that so go ahead and
get that in there for me.

37
00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:12.154
&gt;&gt; Can you do the curly bracket because
that's just string concatenation?

38
00:02:12.154 --> 00:02:12.908
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

39
00:02:12.908 --> 00:02:13.937
&gt;&gt; Literal?

40
00:02:13.937 --> 00:02:17.086
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's called string interpolation.

41
00:02:17.086 --> 00:02:19.677
But yeah,
I'm basically taking the variable and

42
00:02:19.677 --> 00:02:21.533
interpolating it into the stream.

43
00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:22.583
All right.

44
00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:28.151
So the cool part is once the tfe side
gets set up, [LAUGH] it's really that.

45
00:02:28.151 --> 00:02:29.216
That's it.

46
00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:32.000
So now what we can do is what,
what would I do here?

47
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.667
Would I validate or would I.

48
00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:38.543
&gt;&gt; We've made a new works.

49
00:02:38.543 --> 00:02:39.464
We made the new repos.

50
00:02:39.464 --> 00:02:42.203
That probably has to be initiated.

51
00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:45.883
&gt;&gt; Sure, but we have to do something
in Terraform Cloud first, right?

52
00:02:45.883 --> 00:02:47.920
We don't have a workspace yet.

53
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.779
I have the code in my repository but
would I run a plan here?

54
00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:54.467
Would I plan here?

55
00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:55.364
&gt;&gt; Nope.

56
00:02:55.364 --> 00:02:56.257
Just commit it.

57
00:02:56.257 --> 00:02:57.165
&gt;&gt; Just commit it.

58
00:02:57.165 --> 00:02:58.145
Yeah, exactly.

59
00:02:58.145 --> 00:02:59.063
I just commit it, and
this is the cycle, right?

60
00:02:59.063 --> 00:03:04.439
This is now how it works right commit.

61
00:03:06.358 --> 00:03:11.302
Let's validate just to be safe,

62
00:03:11.302 --> 00:03:15.195
and then commit, right.

63
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:23.405
So now we're gonna say
set up GitHub workspace.

64
00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:26.292
All right.

65
00:03:26.292 --> 00:03:28.750
Now what's cool is,
is again, at this point,

66
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.089
Terraform Cloud's completely automated.

67
00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:34.601
We don't have to go into Terraform Cloud
and make changes manually anymore.

68
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:38.903
So now once I push that up, I should
just be able to go back to my projects.

69
00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:46.666
And see a new plan.

70
00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:48.096
And there it is.

71
00:03:48.096 --> 00:03:49.647
There's my new plan.

72
00:03:49.647 --> 00:03:51.124
That's the lifecycle.

73
00:03:51.124 --> 00:03:53.792
Commit, push, go to Terraform Cloud and
check your plan.

74
00:03:53.792 --> 00:04:00.304
&gt;&gt; But
what's the local on this new workspace?

75
00:04:00.304 --> 00:04:01.657
You mean like what is the definition?

76
00:04:01.657 --> 00:04:04.343
&gt;&gt; No, why did why do we want to be local?

77
00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:05.316
I guess I didn't.

78
00:04:05.316 --> 00:04:08.180
&gt;&gt; Because it's a workspace we're
creating a TerraForm cloud.

79
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.483
Right?

80
00:04:09.483 --> 00:04:13.930
So, let's go back to our diagram and maybe
this will help it make sense again, right?

81
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.255
So there's two components to every
workspace that we must have.

82
00:04:17.255 --> 00:04:21.572
We must have a workspace and
then a repository that it tracks, right.

83
00:04:21.572 --> 00:04:26.133
But we're in a situation with both and
it's only Terraform and GitHub.

84
00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:27.738
Why is it only Terraform in GitHub?

85
00:04:27.738 --> 00:04:32.156
Because they're the two things that
maintain state, [LAUGH] right?

86
00:04:32.156 --> 00:04:34.799
Terraform cloud is the thing that
holds the state in the cloud.

87
00:04:34.799 --> 00:04:39.067
But then GitHub is the repository
that it tracks, right?

88
00:04:39.067 --> 00:04:41.020
These are manual processes.

89
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.657
Going forward, we'll only gonna create a
telephone network and a telephone cluster.

90
00:04:44.657 --> 00:04:47.581
We are actually gonna create
those at the same exact time.

91
00:04:47.581 --> 00:04:51.676
Because we have automation already set
up to create multiple work spaces at

92
00:04:51.676 --> 00:04:52.586
the same time and

93
00:04:52.586 --> 00:04:56.815
now we also have automation to create
repositories at the same time, right.

94
00:04:56.815 --> 00:05:00.963
So every time we take a step forward and
automation,

95
00:05:00.963 --> 00:05:05.880
we're making our required work less and
less and less right.

96
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.666
And so what we're doing is we're
first going to terraform cloud to

97
00:05:10.666 --> 00:05:14.693
create that because again,
what is dependent of what.

98
00:05:14.693 --> 00:05:17.507
The workspace is dependent
of the repository, so

99
00:05:17.507 --> 00:05:22.273
we create the repository first so that it
exists, even though it's empty, right?

100
00:05:22.273 --> 00:05:25.679
But then we create the workspace so
that it can find the repository,

101
00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:29.711
even though it's empty, but it can
connect and start synchronizing, right?

102
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:32.653
So then I can just start
pushing to the GitHub repo.

103
00:05:32.653 --> 00:05:37.623
And I don't have to plan like that removed
the need for me to go, okay, let's in it,

104
00:05:37.623 --> 00:05:40.082
let's plan, let's migrate the state.

105
00:05:40.082 --> 00:05:42.080
That doesn't need to be done anymore,
right?

106
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.052
But we still have to create
the main GitHub repo so

107
00:05:45.052 --> 00:05:48.614
that everything else can be tracked and
managed, right?

108
00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:52.845
Yeah, now, as Whisper said,
now we're just gonna be flying, and so

109
00:05:52.845 --> 00:05:55.592
in this scenario, because I've done that.

110
00:05:55.592 --> 00:05:56.138
There it is.

111
00:05:56.138 --> 00:06:01.139
There's my workspace, right example
workspace for GitHub work resources.

112
00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:07.139
There is my repo we know it's created,
so we know it shouldn't fail, right?

113
00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:09.198
And then we hit Confirm and apply.

114
00:06:09.198 --> 00:06:13.161
Now, you'll notice that once it's applied,
we have two workspaces now.

115
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:20.586
Terra or fem eci GitHub and fem eci tfp.
