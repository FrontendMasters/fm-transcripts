1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.840
So let's go ahead and keep moving forward.

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.050
So we just finished, finally, setting up
all of our access keys and everything.

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.160
So that's great.

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.760
We're ready now to fully get started.

5
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.735
And the first thing we're gonna do
is we're gonna start by creating our

6
00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:16.470
Terraform Cloud Automation.

7
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.700
When we look back at our chart,
nope, this one, right?

8
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.900
The first workspace that we talk about
working with is Terraform, right?

9
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.350
Because we wanna automate Terraform first.

10
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.070
So this is the first repository
that we're going to create.

11
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.236
Now, you might be like, hey Eric,

12
00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:36.870
why are we creating a repository if we
want to create Terraform automation?

13
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.600
Welcome to my world of the chicken
before the egg scenario.

14
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.092
So, a lot of the times
with infrastructure,

15
00:00:45.092 --> 00:00:49.760
you'll find yourself having to create
something before you can manage it, right?

16
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.600
And that might seem like, duh.

17
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.616
But what I actually mean by that is,
is sometimes you might have to manually

18
00:00:55.616 --> 00:00:59.970
create something and then import it into
state so that you can set it up properly.

19
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.520
Because, again, something has to create
the thing to create the thing, right?

20
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.030
And so in this case, we create the thing
so the thing can create the things, right?

21
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.440
And so we want to create a new repository.

22
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.140
So we're actually gonna go to GitHub.

23
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.829
Alright, so we're gonna go to GitHub.

24
00:01:20.623 --> 00:01:22.880
And we're gonna go to our account.

25
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.513
So in the top right hand corner,
just click on your profile

26
00:01:30.854 --> 00:01:35.733
And then, click on repositories,
and then here,

27
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:41.240
click new repository,
New, bam right there.

28
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.030
So we're gonna create a new manage
Terraform Cloud repository.

29
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.330
So we're gonna call it
fem-eci-terraform-tfe.

30
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.934
Let me zoom in a little bit for you guys.

31
00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:52.740
Come on now.

32
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.950
So that's the name we want to make.

33
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.570
You can give it a description
if you want or not.

34
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.960
It's totally up to you.

35
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.610
The main point is,
is that this must be done first, again,

36
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.700
chicken before the egg scenario.

37
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.299
Another reason why we're doing this
is we're doing it to create state

38
00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.380
in Terraform Cloud as well.

39
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.868
Right, Terraform Cloud
is our remote provider.

40
00:02:09.868 --> 00:02:15.440
So we have to actually create automation
and run it against Terraform Cloud.

41
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.480
So there's two reasons why we have
to create this repo first, right?

42
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.628
We're gonna work on the main branch for
now, but in the future, as I mentioned,

43
00:02:23.628 --> 00:02:25.950
we will have PRs and things like that.

44
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.700
The next thing you wanna do
is you wanna click private.

45
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.730
So I would make this private for now.

46
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.006
If you want to make it public, you can,
but I would just say private for now.

47
00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:37.660
I would also say Add README.

48
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.780
If you notice when I click Add README, do
you see what happens at the bottom there?

49
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.960
So this is kind of nice.

50
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.300
Which is if you add a readme or a
gitignore template or anything like that,

51
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.890
it will also initialize your
default branch for you.

52
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.946
So you don't wanna have to worry about
cloning something and then first commits,

53
00:02:54.946 --> 00:02:55.910
essentially.

54
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.900
This is a nice way of getting around it.

55
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.610
And what we're gonna do is we
are actually going to add a gitignore.

56
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.760
We're gonna add one for Terraform, right?

57
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.640
Cuz there's probably a bunch
of things that it generates.

58
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.408
We don't wanna have to worry
about stuff like that.

59
00:03:09.408 --> 00:03:12.053
And then we're gonna
click Create Repository.

60
00:03:14.258 --> 00:03:15.690
Okay, bam.

61
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.070
Now you should have your name,
then fem-eci-terraform-tfe.

62
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.790
Now, one of the things you
can do is you can go to

63
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.796
wherever you clone your code, right?

64
00:03:30.796 --> 00:03:34.853
So go to your terminal and
then find a place to put your code, right?

65
00:03:34.853 --> 00:03:38.704
For me, I have a really strict way of
doing things because I work with so

66
00:03:38.704 --> 00:03:42.400
many repositories, and
I'll show you my structure now.

67
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.291
So I have a development folder in
the main route of my home directory.

68
00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:48.403
This is where all of my dev code goes.

69
00:03:48.403 --> 00:03:54.297
No other part of my system besides things
like these dot files and whatnot go.

70
00:03:54.297 --> 00:03:58.465
So all my code goes into
the home development directory.

71
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.636
And it took me a long time to kind of
figure out how I wanted to organize things

72
00:04:02.636 --> 00:04:06.051
from there, because I'm a kind of person
who likes to work in different languages.

73
00:04:06.051 --> 00:04:08.811
I'm the kind of person who likes to
work with a lot of repositories and

74
00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:12.000
I'm also the kind of person that just
likes to write really random scripts every

75
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.920
now and then.

76
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.490
So this is the next layer for me is, do I
wanna work in a language and mess around?

77
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.120
Do I wanna write a script or do I
wanna actually work with a repository?

78
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.300
For me, it's a repository, so
I'm gonna go to the next thing.

79
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.154
Now, I also have in the past, worked with
other systems, so like azure.devops.com

80
00:04:31.154 --> 00:04:36.180
would be another one in here if your
repositories were say, in Azure.

81
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.032
So if you were to say, hey Eric,
how do you separate repos from provider to

82
00:04:40.032 --> 00:04:44.010
provider and know where they are and
know which provider it was before?

83
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.710
This is how I do it.

84
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.010
So that, for example, if we go in GitHub
then you'll see another layer, right?

85
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.260
This layer,
can anyone guess what this layer is?

86
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.730
&gt;&gt; User.

87
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.260
&gt;&gt; User, yeah, user exactly, yeah.

88
00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.430
Organization or user.

89
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.040
And so in this case, we've got ALT-F4,
and then we've got my personal one.

90
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.610
So for me, my clone path is this.

91
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.034
You don't have to do this.

92
00:05:09.034 --> 00:05:12.320
Like I said, I'm a bit of
an overachiever so it's up to you.

93
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.243
You don't really need to but this really
has helped me a lot with managing my

94
00:05:17.243 --> 00:05:20.307
repositories across many different places.

95
00:05:20.307 --> 00:05:22.877
So what I'm going to do and
there's two things you can do.

96
00:05:22.877 --> 00:05:28.160
You can do git clone and
then actually, we'll do git clone.

97
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.366
And then we'll go here, click this, and

98
00:05:30.366 --> 00:05:33.860
then click this little button
right here to copy your code.

99
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.170
That's the first thing you can do.

100
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.110
Do that should get your code, okay?

101
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.105
However, and this is something
that I've been messing with more.

102
00:05:44.105 --> 00:05:46.360
You can also use GitHub CLI.

103
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.344
Now, this was something that I
did include in the install, but

104
00:05:49.344 --> 00:05:51.440
it's up to you if you wanna use it or not.

105
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.210
It's totally up to you.

106
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.280
If you do use GitHub CLI,
you might have to authenticate.

107
00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.680
So you would do gh auth, and
then you would do login, right?

108
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.740
And it's gonna ask you, well,
where do you wanna log in, right?

109
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.302
You tell Github.com.

110
00:06:06.302 --> 00:06:08.480
I'm already logged in.

111
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.850
So it just says you're good.

112
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:11.780
I'll hit yes.

113
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.180
Now, which do you prefer your protocol for
your Git operations.

114
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.580
I actually don't prefer HTTPS.

115
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.610
I'd much rather use SSH because I'd
rather use the key that's on my system.

116
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.870
And so I hit SSH and then bam,
that's where it actually asks me, okay,

117
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.430
cool, what key do you want to use, right?

118
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.080
So I hit enter and
then get a title for your SSH key.

119
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.110
Now, it's actually asking me if
I want to upload my key, right?

120
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.150
So I've already done that.

121
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.140
So I don't have to go
through this process.

122
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.661
But if I wanted to,
I could then upload my key and do it.

123
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:49.410
So if you want you can use
GitHub host through this,

124
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:56.381
GitHub CLI through this sign in and
use this or you can use the clone action.

125
00:06:56.381 --> 00:07:01.126
We're really not gonna be using any of
the CLI except for like creating PRs and

126
00:07:01.126 --> 00:07:02.225
stuff like that.

127
00:07:02.225 --> 00:07:05.935
So let me let me cancel out
of this really quickly.

128
00:07:05.935 --> 00:07:06.735
Let me go one more time.

129
00:07:06.735 --> 00:07:09.025
So get GH off login here.

130
00:07:10.635 --> 00:07:15.305
Yes, I wanna re authenticate SSH,
skip, right?

131
00:07:15.305 --> 00:07:17.736
And then I wanna log in with browser.

132
00:07:17.736 --> 00:07:19.510
So here's my one time code.

133
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.166
I should then be, Where

134
00:07:27.166 --> 00:07:31.180
did sorry,
have to answer [LAUGH] There we go.

135
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.460
So I paste in my code.

136
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.451
I hit Continue, and then asks me,
what do I want access to.

137
00:07:37.451 --> 00:07:39.230
I click Authorize github.

138
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.920
Congratulations, you're all set.

139
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:46.682
Now, I'm logged in as myself, and what's
nice is now I can just do repo clone.

140
00:07:54.788 --> 00:07:56.350
A little easier, right?

141
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.770
A little nicer.

142
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:58.900
So it's up to you.

143
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:04.137
You're welcome to use
the normal Git operations,

144
00:08:04.137 --> 00:08:07.360
or you can use the GitHub CLI.

145
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.654
I personally like to use the GitHub,CLI,
so

146
00:08:10.654 --> 00:08:14.479
I'm gonna be using that but
I can do it in either way.
