WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.758
So let's move on to
the next thing we wanna do.

2
00:00:02.758 --> 00:00:09.349
Okay, so now after we've logged in,
we want to go to Security Credentials.

3
00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.151
And so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna go to the top right.

4
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:15.143
We're gonna click Security Credentials.

5
00:00:15.143 --> 00:00:17.094
This is the part that gets scary.

6
00:00:17.094 --> 00:00:21.229
Okay, cool, again,
I have no idea what's in here.

7
00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:27.315
And then what we're gonna do is we're
going to go to, where did I say it was?

8
00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:29.253
Access keys, yeah, okay.

9
00:00:29.253 --> 00:00:31.848
So you'll see here I have two
access keys at the moment.

10
00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:33.348
And it's okay, these are fine.

11
00:00:33.348 --> 00:00:35.253
It doesn't matter if these are shown.

12
00:00:35.253 --> 00:00:39.287
But these are basically my secret key IDs,
right?

13
00:00:39.287 --> 00:00:42.050
So these are the keys that
I've created on my account.

14
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.097
And right now, you'll see I have one,
or, I'm sorry,

15
00:00:45.097 --> 00:00:47.651
I have one that's been around for
260 days.

16
00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:50.072
And you can see it's even used S3, right?

17
00:00:50.072 --> 00:00:54.513
And I've got another one,
which is brand new, which is fem-eci.

18
00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:56.878
And that one was, actually,
I haven't even used it yet,

19
00:00:56.878 --> 00:00:59.217
more than likely because I
just used these credentials.

20
00:00:59.217 --> 00:01:01.703
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
delete this really quickly.

21
00:01:06.038 --> 00:01:08.116
And we're gonna create a new one.

22
00:01:08.116 --> 00:01:10.046
So I'm gonna hit Create access key.

23
00:01:10.046 --> 00:01:13.633
And the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna click Command Line Interface cuz

24
00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:14.460
this access key,

25
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.843
we don't really care about letting
access to the command line, right?

26
00:01:17.843 --> 00:01:20.246
And it might say, hey,
there's alternatives, that's fine.

27
00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.232
We're just gonna use what we want.

28
00:01:21.232 --> 00:01:24.530
So we understand the above recommendation,
and I wanna proceed with an access key.

29
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.179
I'm gonna hit Next, and
then I'm gonna give it a description.

30
00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.805
So I'll just say fem-eci, right?

31
00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:34.235
And then I'll click Create access key.

32
00:01:34.235 --> 00:01:36.962
Now, I have a brand new access key, right?

33
00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:38.004
And I have a secret key.

34
00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:42.438
Now, I'm not gonna show the secret key,
but just like we did with GitHub and

35
00:01:42.438 --> 00:01:45.349
Terraform, we're gonna go back to Doppler,
and

36
00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:48.355
now we're gonna add our AWS credentials,
right?

37
00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:54.252
So that's AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID.

38
00:01:54.252 --> 00:01:57.087
Paste in your value.

39
00:01:57.087 --> 00:02:03.314
It's gonna be AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.

40
00:02:03.314 --> 00:02:05.207
For now, just do us-west-2 for

41
00:02:05.207 --> 00:02:09.064
me because I did everything in
us-west-2 cuz I live in California.

42
00:02:09.064 --> 00:02:13.602
[LAUGH] So for now,
just do us-west-2 for me.

43
00:02:13.602 --> 00:02:18.289
And then AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,

44
00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:23.689
paste in your secret access key,
like that.

45
00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:24.714
And then hit Save.

46
00:02:24.714 --> 00:02:26.665
Okay, so let's go ahead and
jump back into it.

47
00:02:26.665 --> 00:02:29.855
So I wanna show you guys
something really quickly,

48
00:02:29.855 --> 00:02:32.388
which is how to actually set up Doppler.

49
00:02:32.388 --> 00:02:37.413
We want to make sure that Doppler can
actually authenticate with itself.

50
00:02:37.413 --> 00:02:40.194
And so what we wanna do is
we wanna type in doppler,

51
00:02:40.194 --> 00:02:43.788
and then if we hit Enter,
we'll get what's called mand pages.

52
00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:46.083
These are basically just explaining,

53
00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:49.081
telling us what all we can
do with the command line.

54
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:52.229
And if we look in here, we should see
a couple that are kind of important.

55
00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:53.589
The first one is login.

56
00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:56.325
[LAUGH] So
we actually wanna log into Doppler so

57
00:02:56.325 --> 00:02:58.557
that we can use our Doppler secrets.

58
00:02:58.557 --> 00:03:00.797
And so in that case, you do doppler login.

59
00:03:00.797 --> 00:03:03.724
Now, I already have access, right?

60
00:03:03.724 --> 00:03:05.851
I'm already within whatever.

61
00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:10.406
So what you do is you'd actually then
go through the process of signing into

62
00:03:10.406 --> 00:03:13.751
Doppler, and
then you'd be returned back to the CLI.

63
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:16.790
And so once you're done with that,
then, again,

64
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.978
you can open the authorization
page in your browser.

65
00:03:19.978 --> 00:03:21.618
I'll do that.

66
00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:24.033
Now, I have a SAML provider, so

67
00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:29.047
it's gonna actually make me go
through two, or what is it called?

68
00:03:29.047 --> 00:03:31.537
One, three-factor, whatever it is.

69
00:03:31.537 --> 00:03:33.807
Let me move this off for just a second.

70
00:03:33.807 --> 00:03:37.363
And then what you'll notice is you'll
see that you have an auth code that's

71
00:03:37.363 --> 00:03:38.596
provided to you, right?

72
00:03:38.596 --> 00:03:43.412
And so this auth code is what you're
actually going to use to paste

73
00:03:43.412 --> 00:03:46.664
into Doppler so
that you can log in, right?

74
00:03:46.664 --> 00:03:51.294
So once you do that,
I'll move this off to the side, or

75
00:03:51.294 --> 00:03:55.522
here, let's copy this,
paste that, hit Next,

76
00:03:55.522 --> 00:03:59.461
please don't, okay, cool, Finish Login.

77
00:03:59.461 --> 00:04:01.785
Manage Tokens, and there you go.

78
00:04:01.785 --> 00:04:05.362
You can see I've got my new token here,
and I should be logged in,

79
00:04:05.362 --> 00:04:07.391
and it says welcome, Erik, right?

80
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:11.542
The second thing I wanna do is I
actually wanna do doppler setup, right?

81
00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:16.770
So doppler setup makes it so that I can
choose a default environment to work in or

82
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.764
a default project to work in.

83
00:04:18.764 --> 00:04:21.011
And so in this case,
you'll see I have a ton of them.

84
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:25.499
But if I scroll down, I'm gonna go to my
default project for me, which is my name.

85
00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:29.789
Again, it might be example project for
you, it might be something else, but

86
00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.771
we hit Enter, and
then it'll tell us what it loaded.

87
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:38.489
So before when we did doppler run,
blah, blah, blah,

88
00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:45.305
blah, now, all we really have to
do is aws s3 ls, go back here.

89
00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:47.507
I don't have a backspace on this keyboard.

90
00:04:47.507 --> 00:04:50.807
Never mind [LAUGH] one second,
there we go.

91
00:04:50.807 --> 00:04:54.300
Get rid of all of this now.

92
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.222
And then that should work on its own,
bam, right?

93
00:04:57.222 --> 00:04:58.211
Makes it a little easier.

94
00:04:58.211 --> 00:04:59.729
You don't have to put in as many things.

95
00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:05.483
And the real point was I just wanted you
to see the flexibility with the CLI.

96
00:05:05.483 --> 00:05:10.038
And how I wanted to get you thinking
exactly the way you were thinking, of,

97
00:05:10.038 --> 00:05:13.003
cool, I can use this for
local development, but

98
00:05:13.003 --> 00:05:14.762
what else can I use this for?

99
00:05:14.762 --> 00:05:16.211
Could I have this in pipelines?

100
00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:19.878
Could this be something that
runs my service, right?

101
00:05:19.878 --> 00:05:22.296
So again, that's really
the big reason why we do that.

102
00:05:22.296 --> 00:05:26.727
But, yeah,
I would say save yourself some time and

103
00:05:26.727 --> 00:05:30.244
do the doppler login and doppler setup.
