1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.650
So the repo that we want to create
is really the product service repo.

2
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.560
So here let's sorry,
really quick, Locals, cool.

3
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.060
So I created an ECI service repository,
right?

4
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.472
This is for my actual service, but I have
no resources to automate it with, right?

5
00:00:23.472 --> 00:00:27.439
I created the service repository first
because I wanted to show you guys some of

6
00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.070
the things that we need.

7
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.660
We need a registry, right?

8
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.136
We need an image we know that
we're building with Docker and

9
00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:36.730
we know that we have configuration
variables and things like that, right.

10
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.635
So the next thing we wanna do is we want
to make automation that makes that service

11
00:00:40.635 --> 00:00:41.810
deployable.

12
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.162
So we're gonna go back
to here one more time.

13
00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:50.238
And this time we're gonna say
fem-eci-terraform-product-,

14
00:00:52.247 --> 00:00:54.232
Service, right?

15
00:00:54.232 --> 00:00:57.708
And as I was saying before,
all of the automation for

16
00:00:57.708 --> 00:01:01.898
the service repository that we
created will go in here, okay?

17
00:01:01.898 --> 00:01:04.377
So I'm gonna quickly delete all of this,
and

18
00:01:04.377 --> 00:01:07.064
I'm gonna replace it with
the stuff that I need.

19
00:01:10.434 --> 00:01:14.233
All right, let's get rid of this,
get rid of this.

20
00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:19.180
And there we go, now I have my Frontend
Masters ECI Terraform product service

21
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.930
repository as well.

22
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.760
And let's make sure that
this is public too.

23
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.153
Cool, so we added both of them.

24
00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:30.120
Now realistically, we could have
added both of these simultaneously,

25
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.695
but I wanted to show you guys
the process of a developer going in and

26
00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:38.140
then being like hey, I need to create
a service repository, how can I do it?

27
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.090
What I just did,
was essentially the process to do that.

28
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.021
So now that the developers created the
service repository, we need to make it so

29
00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:47.556
that we can actually create
the automation for it.

30
00:01:47.556 --> 00:01:51.031
Because it's a little bit like we need
them to do their job first before we can

31
00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:52.060
do ours, right?

32
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.424
So we're gonna say git checkout,
nope, sorry, cool.

33
00:01:58.424 --> 00:02:01.137
And then let's check our locals
really quickly just to make sure that

34
00:02:01.137 --> 00:02:01.760
it's in here.

35
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.200
Okay, cool.

36
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.849
And then git checkout -b added or

37
00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.106
add-service-automation.

38
00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.866
Git locals, see feature,

39
00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:27.770
added automation repo push, cool.

40
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.294
Okay, so we've added our automation repo,
I'm gonna do gh pr create.

41
00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:36.378
Go like this.

42
00:02:41.373 --> 00:02:44.057
And then, of course,
because it's connected to Terraform Cloud,

43
00:02:44.057 --> 00:02:45.100
it's gonna do a run.

44
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.936
So, we've gotta give it
a second to do its run.

45
00:02:56.933 --> 00:02:58.520
And there we go, beautiful.

46
00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.200
That looks great.

47
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.110
Okay, so let's go ahead and
keep moving, squash and merge.

48
00:03:05.738 --> 00:03:10.094
And as you can see,
my pattern is make some changes,

49
00:03:10.094 --> 00:03:14.357
review it in a pr, merge it,
and apply it, right?

50
00:03:14.357 --> 00:03:18.080
So while that's going,
I'm gonna go ahead and just clean this up.

51
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.918
So I'm gonna say git checkout main,
right, pull.

52
00:03:24.918 --> 00:03:31.680
And then get branch -a git branch
-d feature/add-service-automation.

53
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.730
And let's do a capital D just so
that it's all good.

54
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.970
Playing finished,
fantastic, Confirm &amp; Apply.

55
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.872
So we're gonna create our product service
repository that will maintain all of our

56
00:03:45.872 --> 00:03:47.563
service level automation.

57
00:03:47.563 --> 00:03:51.844
So this is the last repo we need.

58
00:03:51.844 --> 00:03:56.114
So we're gonna say,
eci-terraform-product-service.

59
00:03:56.114 --> 00:03:59.556
And you can see it's actually being
created underneath my screen, so

60
00:03:59.556 --> 00:04:00.965
I can't hit Enter just yet.

61
00:04:04.893 --> 00:04:06.700
Cool, now I'm gonna hit Enter.

62
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.830
Bam, cuz you can see here it got created.

63
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.010
Okay, cool.

64
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.589
So let's go ahead and
create our product service automation.

65
00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:17.131
To do this,
you're gonna go back to the example repo,

66
00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:19.758
eci-terraform-product-service.

67
00:04:19.758 --> 00:04:22.849
So terraform,

68
00:04:27.184 --> 00:04:30.308
-product-service.

69
00:04:32.916 --> 00:04:35.940
And then we're gonna copy
all the stuff in here.

70
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.770
And I'm gonna go to the branch 06 setup.

71
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.960
Remember, we wanna make sure
we follow these branches.

72
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.030
So I'm gonna go to module-service.

73
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.380
And you'll see here I have a module
actually inside of my repository.

74
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.364
Now we've been saying module,
module, module over, and over,

75
00:04:52.364 --> 00:04:56.776
and over again, but this is actually
a time where I decided to say, well,

76
00:04:56.776 --> 00:05:00.290
I want this repository to not
just deploy services to ECS.

77
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.939
Maybe in the future I also want this
repository to deploy to Google or

78
00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:05.510
other things like that.

79
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.040
And so
you can create these modules for that.

80
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.347
So you have a module for ECS, you have
a module for Kubernetes, you have a module

81
00:05:13.347 --> 00:05:17.463
for other things, and then this can go
out and connect to all those things and

82
00:05:17.463 --> 00:05:21.650
deploy all of your services to all
of its relative providers, right?

83
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.323
So what we're gonna do is we're
going to create a new directory,

84
00:05:24.323 --> 00:05:27.056
we're gonna create a module,
just like we have here, all right?

85
00:05:27.056 --> 00:05:30.490
And we're gonna create another
new directory, ECS service, okay?

86
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:37.530
Now, in this, we have three files,
a data file, data.tf, right?

87
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.063
Now again, feel free to look at this file
if you want, it's got some cool stuff

88
00:05:43.063 --> 00:05:47.444
in it, but it's mostly just to make it so
that this works the way that we want.

89
00:05:47.444 --> 00:05:48.378
Okay, cool.

90
00:05:48.378 --> 00:05:49.700
So we're gonna get rid of that.

91
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.390
We're gonna close that out, I mean.

92
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.390
Then we're gonna do the main.

93
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.377
So you'll notice that even in this module,

94
00:05:57.377 --> 00:06:04.619
I am still following the conventions
of data, main, right, stuff like that.

95
00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:08.714
New file, variables, right?

96
00:06:08.714 --> 00:06:13.354
Now this is important to note because
these are the variables for the service.

97
00:06:13.354 --> 00:06:17.500
So we wanna tell it which cluster it's
supposed to go into which environment?

98
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.350
What's the default image?

99
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.160
What's the log retention?

100
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.090
What's the name?

101
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.110
What's the parameters?

102
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.520
What's the secure parameters?

103
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.380
And what's the port, right?

104
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.408
These are very common, things that
you might expect with a service.

105
00:06:30.408 --> 00:06:35.160
And so these are things that we want
to add as optional parameters, right?

106
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.986
So we're gonna go to file variables .tf,
and

107
00:06:39.986 --> 00:06:44.824
we're gonna paste this in, right?, cool.

108
00:06:44.824 --> 00:06:48.824
Okay, so now we have a module
folder with all of our

109
00:06:48.824 --> 00:06:53.570
ECS relevant deployment
infrastructure code, right?

110
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.740
So once we have that, then we can
go to the root and use it, right.

111
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.226
So I'm gonna create a new file main.tf.

112
00:07:01.226 --> 00:07:04.458
I'm gonna copy everything that's in here,
and I'm gonna paste this.

113
00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:08.390
And you'll notice that it's very simple,
but look at the source here.

114
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.370
This is the important part,
the source, right?

115
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.230
The source is saying,
hey, you gotta go local.

116
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.256
You're not gonna go out to any remote
connection or anything like that,

117
00:07:19.256 --> 00:07:21.040
this is a local module, right?

118
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.596
The cluster name, environment,
image name these are all,

119
00:07:24.596 --> 00:07:27.745
right, parameters to that
module that we just made.

120
00:07:27.745 --> 00:07:32.341
And look at this, we just saw
this in our service repository.

121
00:07:32.341 --> 00:07:36.341
So when I told you that you can configure,
your service, right,

122
00:07:36.341 --> 00:07:39.783
let's go back to the service
repository really quick.

123
00:07:39.783 --> 00:07:43.690
If we go back to that service
repository and we go to configs,

124
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.994
look at the values of the configs
fem-instructor-Erik, okay?

125
00:07:47.994 --> 00:07:50.581
Well, we need an parameter
that's an fem-instructor.

126
00:07:50.581 --> 00:07:52.636
We need a location, okay?

127
00:07:52.636 --> 00:07:55.400
Well, that's got to be another parameter,
right, version?

128
00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.043
Okay, we're literally looking at the code
and saying what is this application

129
00:08:00.043 --> 00:08:04.080
expecting so that we can create
the resources needed for it, right?

130
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.000
So it's very easy to do.

131
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.164
The only other thing we're gonna do is,
we're gonna set the image.

132
00:08:09.164 --> 00:08:09.855
And again,

133
00:08:09.855 --> 00:08:14.570
that registry that I told you guys about
before should be customizable, right?

134
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.070
And the off chance that you change
registries or you wanted whatever,

135
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:21.170
that can be a variable,
the same thing with the environment.

136
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.988
So we're gonna do vvariables.tf.

137
00:08:25.906 --> 00:08:29.748
And we're going to, whoops, wrong.

138
00:08:31.847 --> 00:08:34.186
I'm right or wrong repo, go here.

139
00:08:34.186 --> 00:08:38.192
And we're going to paste this in, right?

140
00:08:38.192 --> 00:08:42.322
Now, the registry domain in this case,

141
00:08:42.322 --> 00:08:47.069
right would be the one in
ECR that I showed you.

142
00:08:47.069 --> 00:08:51.697
So we'd go back to ECR, and
I can just copy this part here, right,

143
00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:53.278
this first part here.

144
00:08:53.278 --> 00:08:57.212
If you don't see this,
you can go to create repository and

145
00:08:57.212 --> 00:09:02.270
it'll show you what's there so
that you can copy and paste it there.

146
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.959
But basically, we're gonna copy and
paste that, that is my registry.

147
00:09:05.959 --> 00:09:10.536
And I have officially set up my
automation for my service, right?

148
00:09:10.536 --> 00:09:15.016
Now, I'm not actually
going to connect this or

149
00:09:15.016 --> 00:09:21.182
anything like that, I'm gonna let
terraform do all that for me.

150
00:09:21.182 --> 00:09:24.372
But I still wanna do a Terraform valid or
Terraform init, right,

151
00:09:24.372 --> 00:09:27.041
just to make sure that
the initialization works well.

152
00:09:31.145 --> 00:09:34.743
And I wanna do a validate too just to
make sure that the code validate is

153
00:09:34.743 --> 00:09:35.900
fine, right?

154
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.080
Cool, okay.

155
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:43.240
So now what we're gonna do is we're
going to push these changes up,

156
00:09:44.708 --> 00:09:50.301
Okay, so let me just, [INAUDIBLE] one
second, trying to catch up with my notes.

157
00:09:50.301 --> 00:09:51.098
Cool, okay.

158
00:09:51.098 --> 00:09:59.990
So then we're gonna do git checkout -b
feature/add-service-automation, sure.

159
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.640
We're gonna go ahead and
add all of our specific files.

160
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:08.540
Again, you can also do git add main,
right, module, so forth and so

161
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.490
on, it's up to you.

162
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:16.870
I use lazygit, and then I'm going to
just say git commit added resources.

163
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.795
And I'm gonna push that up.

164
00:10:22.944 --> 00:10:27.291
Oops, cool, so
we're gonna do gh pr create.

165
00:10:27.291 --> 00:10:30.295
Again, always gonna be using prs, right?

166
00:10:30.295 --> 00:10:32.769
That's your flow now.

167
00:10:35.039 --> 00:10:39.018
Cool, now, I'm not gonna have automation
attached to this right now, and

168
00:10:39.018 --> 00:10:40.648
that's fine, totally fine.

169
00:10:40.648 --> 00:10:42.190
Let's just review our code.

170
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:46.259
Looks good, looks good, looks good, cool.

171
00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:48.269
Okay?

172
00:10:50.186 --> 00:10:53.457
And then let's merge it.

173
00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.918
So we created the repo
just like we have before.

174
00:10:58.918 --> 00:11:01.606
What else do we need to create?

175
00:11:01.606 --> 00:11:06.358
The workspace, right, so
we're gonna go back to our

176
00:11:06.358 --> 00:11:13.142
Terraform TFE Pull

177
00:11:13.142 --> 00:11:16.931
in, Go to locals.

178
00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.550
And we've got our network now,
we've got our cluster now.

179
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.698
All right, time to add our service.

180
00:11:26.028 --> 00:11:29.208
So I'm going to actually go to my notes.

181
00:11:29.208 --> 00:11:34.308
Copy and paste this, paste this in.

182
00:11:34.308 --> 00:11:39.910
Oops, I messed up my syntax a bit there.

183
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.220
Let me try that paste one more time.

184
00:11:46.725 --> 00:11:47.656
There we go.

185
00:11:47.656 --> 00:11:50.503
And now here's our service prod.

186
00:11:50.503 --> 00:11:53.534
Now let's take a look at this really
quick, cuz we had variables here.

187
00:11:53.534 --> 00:11:55.261
So let's take a look at these variables.

188
00:11:55.261 --> 00:11:59.139
Now you'll see that I've actually
got prod in here, because I'm

189
00:11:59.139 --> 00:12:03.860
trying to be specific and say, yes,
this workspace is for production,right?

190
00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.629
We've already got execution mode set up,

191
00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:08.490
because we know we want it to just
go ahead and start running, right?

192
00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.990
The repo is already there.

193
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.634
And then what we're gonna do
is we're going to say my name.

194
00:12:13.634 --> 00:12:16.730
And then you'll notice
that it's got -prod.

195
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:22.019
Now that wasn't in the cluster name,
so why are we using it as -prod here?

196
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.260
It's up to you,
I decided to make this explicit.

197
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:31.021
You could take the environment and then
say the name and then it attached prod for

198
00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:33.370
you, right, in the logic.

199
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:37.087
However, it's a little bit too much
magic for me, I like to know if I wanted

200
00:12:37.087 --> 00:12:40.761
to put prod on a different cluster or
something like that I could, right?

201
00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:44.616
And so the way to know that I am
actually looking at the right cluster,

202
00:12:44.616 --> 00:12:46.620
is just to go into console,right?

203
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:53.880
And then ECS, right, and then here it is.

204
00:12:53.880 --> 00:13:00.860
So fem-eci-ereinert-prod should
match fem-eci-ereinert-prod, okay?

205
00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.970
So I'm gonna validate.

206
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:08.902
Looks good, great, git checkout -b
feature/add-service-automation.

207
00:13:08.902 --> 00:13:15.668
Lazygit see feature added
service automation.

208
00:13:15.668 --> 00:13:20.572
And we're gonna push that up as well.

209
00:13:28.095 --> 00:13:31.360
Cool, so we're gonna do gh pr create.

210
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.308
And then we'll go to the pr.

211
00:13:44.026 --> 00:13:47.406
Now again, everything's already wired up,
so I'm just gonna come in here and

212
00:13:47.406 --> 00:13:49.150
take a quick look.

213
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.916
Product service, looks good, cluster name,

214
00:13:51.916 --> 00:13:55.038
looks good, prod, looks good,
cool, looks good.

215
00:13:55.038 --> 00:13:58.868
We got the check mark,
we're good to go, squash and merge.

216
00:13:58.868 --> 00:14:03.080
Okay, so we've gone ahead and
added our workspace.

217
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.670
Now we've run into this
a few times already.

218
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.980
So after we create this workspace,
do you think it's gonna work?

219
00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:12.490
Right, we just created a workspace for
Amazon.

220
00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.362
Do you think it's gonna work?

221
00:14:15.362 --> 00:14:16.531
&gt;&gt; It's a credentials?

222
00:14:16.531 --> 00:14:20.569
&gt;&gt; Exactly, so this is a common
scenario where maybe you start

223
00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:24.953
adding the variable sets to
the Terraform automation, right?

224
00:14:24.953 --> 00:14:28.234
So that then they can automatically
be added to the workspaces,

225
00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:29.643
right, that's up to you.

226
00:14:29.643 --> 00:14:32.862
I just I chose to do it manually for
now just so

227
00:14:32.862 --> 00:14:36.083
that you guys could see
your options there.

228
00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:40.683
But yeah, we're gonna need to make
sure that the workspace actually gets

229
00:14:40.683 --> 00:14:43.680
the AWS credentials after it's created.

230
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.274
But again, we're in a chicken before
the egg scenario where we have to wait for

231
00:14:47.274 --> 00:14:48.975
the workspace to be created to do so.

232
00:14:48.975 --> 00:14:52.507
And you'll notice that in this scenario,
it's waiting for the configuration

233
00:14:52.507 --> 00:14:56.370
actually be pulled in, so it's cloning our
repo, and then it's gonna plan and fail.

234
00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:00.360
So we're gonna go to Settings
one more time, right?

235
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.810
We're gonna go to variable sets.

236
00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:06.380
We've already got our variable set, but
we need to apply it to another repository.

237
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.150
And that is, sorry, service-prod, right?

238
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.901
So we'll save that variable set.

239
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:14.827
The pipeline is gonna fail, that's fine,

240
00:15:14.827 --> 00:15:19.620
cuz it started running before we
gave it the credentials, right?

241
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.880
So let's go here, new run, and start.

242
00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.040
Now again, this service has
a bunch of different stuff.

243
00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.442
So it has like an execution policy,
it has other execution policies,

244
00:15:31.442 --> 00:15:34.134
it has roles, it has parameters, right?

245
00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:38.355
It has all these other things that we know
we're gonna need that it's just gonna

246
00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:40.248
kinda create a out of the box for us.

247
00:15:40.248 --> 00:15:42.754
So I'm gonna hit Confirm &amp; Apply.

248
00:15:42.754 --> 00:15:47.794
And now, I wanna note,
every service going forward has

249
00:15:47.794 --> 00:15:53.880
the ability to do everything
that all the other services did.

250
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.356
So if you have a service that
needs different parameters,

251
00:15:56.356 --> 00:15:58.237
just give a different parameters, right?

252
00:15:58.237 --> 00:16:00.032
If it needs a different image or
a different name,

253
00:16:00.032 --> 00:16:01.160
just give it a different name.

254
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.941
But just like the repositories, right,

255
00:16:03.941 --> 00:16:09.360
the services now follow the same
standardization of the other ones, right?

256
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.820
So what's cool is, is look at that
green across the board, awesome.

257
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:17.190
We just finished setting up our
service infrastructure automation
