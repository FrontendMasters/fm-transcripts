WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.096
So let's go ahead and
start working on the next section, okay?

2
00:00:03.096 --> 00:00:07.044
So we've set up, now,
I do wanna note really quickly,

3
00:00:07.044 --> 00:00:12.424
if you're following along in the example
repositories, that's the URL,

4
00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:18.290
This has branches in it.

5
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.519
And if you click here,

6
00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.284
you'll see all of the branches of
everything we're gonna do today.

7
00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:26.111
So we just finished this,
we're gonna get to this next.

8
00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:30.332
Or actually, we finished this,
we finished this and we're here now, okay?

9
00:00:30.332 --> 00:00:32.437
So we're gonna go to
setup-vcs-configuration.

10
00:00:32.437 --> 00:00:36.159
Again, this is just so that you guys have
it if you wanna copy and paste code and

11
00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:38.243
stuff like that to make
it a little easier?

12
00:00:38.243 --> 00:00:41.510
But we're gonna still go
through it one-on-one.

13
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.797
So let me go back to my terraform.tfe,
switch back to my tab.

14
00:00:48.797 --> 00:00:52.970
Okay, so as I just said, we committed
our code, we pushed it up, right?

15
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.049
Awesome, but do you guys think
that if I go into right now and

16
00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:02.189
I change some code, you guys think that
it'll just do it automatically for

17
00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:04.166
me because it's in Git now?

18
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.840
What do you guys think?

19
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.786
&gt;&gt; Probably won't if you don't tell it to.

20
00:01:07.786 --> 00:01:11.570
&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, if you don't tell it to,
it's not gonna do anything, right?

21
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.807
And [LAUGH] it's so funny that you
said magic, because it is true.

22
00:01:15.807 --> 00:01:18.793
There's half of it where it's very
magical, and then there's other than half

23
00:01:18.793 --> 00:01:21.882
where it's, if you don't know what you're
doing, it's not gonna work at all.

24
00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:26.875
[LAUGH] And so this is one of
those scenarios where, yeah,

25
00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:32.610
we have to tell it, hey,
we need to synchronize to a repository.

26
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.260
The cool part about that is we actually
can do that in automation too,

27
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.795
which is pretty nice.

28
00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:42.784
So the first thing we wanna do is is
we wanna connect to version control.

29
00:01:42.784 --> 00:01:48.962
So what we're gonna do is is we're gonna
go to Settings in Terraform Cloud,

30
00:01:48.962 --> 00:01:53.508
and we're gonna scroll all
the way to Version Control.

31
00:01:53.508 --> 00:01:55.799
And then we're gonna click General.

32
00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.160
Or, I'm sorry, Providers,
my bad, Providers, right?

33
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.914
So these are VCS providers.

34
00:02:00.914 --> 00:02:04.946
These are the things that you can
actually connect git repositories to and

35
00:02:04.946 --> 00:02:06.220
all that fun stuff.

36
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.688
I'm gonna hit Add VCS provider.

37
00:02:08.688 --> 00:02:11.820
Now, it has a lot of options,
which is actually really nice.

38
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.737
They have integrated with
a lot of VCS providers.

39
00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:15.620
For us, we want GitHub.

40
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.038
Now, you'll notice that I
already have it installed.

41
00:02:18.038 --> 00:02:21.552
&gt;&gt; Yeah, my Terraform account is SSO.

42
00:02:21.552 --> 00:02:22.791
&gt;&gt; You signed in through.

43
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:24.540
Then yeah, it might already be connected.

44
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.112
Yeah, so if you signed in via SSO,
you might already see this connected.

45
00:02:28.112 --> 00:02:32.875
If you didn't have that,
you should have seen a GitHub link there.

46
00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:36.030
[LAUGH] And when you click that,
it will then make it so

47
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.641
that you can select which account you
want to install Terraform Cloud into.

48
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:42.620
You can see here I have
a bunch of different accounts.

49
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.709
I wanna install it into my main account,
right?

50
00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.089
So I'm gonna click on this, I'm gonna
tell it that I can access all my repos.

51
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.687
And then we're good to go.

52
00:02:51.687 --> 00:02:55.647
Now, I'm not actually gonna go through
this process, right, because I just

53
00:02:55.647 --> 00:02:59.350
wanted to show you what it looked
like to connect it to GitHub, right?

54
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.284
This is actually going into the workspace
and manually setting it up,

55
00:03:03.284 --> 00:03:05.692
which is what we don't want to do, right?

56
00:03:05.692 --> 00:03:07.990
We want this to be an automation.

57
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.740
So what we really wanna do is we
wanna figure out how we can add

58
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.125
this to automation, right?

59
00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:20.141
And the biggest way to do that is first
we need to understand or know what

60
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:25.765
is the application in GitHub so that we
can tell it this is the one unique value.

61
00:03:25.765 --> 00:03:30.462
Because we just installed it to GitHub,
we're gonna need the ID of that

62
00:03:30.462 --> 00:03:34.610
installation so that when we
tell the code, hey, use GitHub,

63
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.023
it has the key or the ID of
the installation that it knows how to use.

64
00:03:39.023 --> 00:03:43.809
So what we're gonna do first is we're
actually gonna navigate in GitHub one

65
00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:47.710
more time to our settings and
installations where I just was.

66
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.041
So if you go to GitHub,
scroll to Applications,

67
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:54.062
you'll see Terraform Cloud sitting here.

68
00:03:54.062 --> 00:04:00.560
What we wanna do is when we get here,
we wanna get the installation ID, right?

69
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.852
The installation ID is essentially, again,

70
00:04:04.852 --> 00:04:08.928
the ID that we want to get and
use in our code.

71
00:04:08.928 --> 00:04:13.202
So I'm gonna hit Configure, and
then I'm actually gonna do a little trick,

72
00:04:13.202 --> 00:04:16.289
which I'm gonna go to the left,
I'm gonna go to my URL,

73
00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.650
I'm gonna slide all the way over here.

74
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.850
You're good?
Cool, and then this is the ID.

75
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.506
So that's actually your
installation ID right there.

76
00:04:23.506 --> 00:04:25.186
Yes, welcome to DevOps.

77
00:04:25.186 --> 00:04:27.698
[LAUGH] This is the beauty of DevOps,

78
00:04:27.698 --> 00:04:30.895
finding where they hide
the things you need.

79
00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:34.744
And so yeah, sure enough, that's the only
real great place to find the installation

80
00:04:34.744 --> 00:04:36.410
ID, but it will give it to you there.

81
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.526
So yeah, go ahead and
let me, you got that now?

82
00:04:38.526 --> 00:04:39.475
Cool, okay.

83
00:04:39.475 --> 00:04:42.907
So now that we have our installation ID,
just copy that,

84
00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:46.137
put it somewhere in a notepad or
something like that.

85
00:04:46.137 --> 00:04:50.121
But what we wanna do after we get that
installation ID is we wanna go back to our

86
00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:54.470
automation and actually set it up so
that it can use that installation ID.

87
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.387
Now, I've already talked to you about
variables and locals and stuff like that,

88
00:04:58.387 --> 00:05:00.502
where do you think we
should put this value?

89
00:05:00.502 --> 00:05:02.900
Should it go in variables or
should it go in locals?

90
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.876
&gt;&gt; Probably variables.

91
00:05:03.876 --> 00:05:04.910
&gt;&gt; Why?

92
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.662
&gt;&gt; Because it might depend
on what user is doing.

93
00:05:08.662 --> 00:05:09.950
&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.

94
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.856
And it might change in the future,
you might disconnect.

95
00:05:12.856 --> 00:05:15.530
You might do what we just did,
which is accidentally break it.

96
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.313
[LAUGH] And you have to disconnect it and
reconnect it.

97
00:05:17.313 --> 00:05:20.711
Well, that means you got to go into
your automation, make a change, and

98
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:22.283
then rerun everything, right?

99
00:05:22.283 --> 00:05:24.023
Or we can just make it a variable.

100
00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:27.452
And so that variable then makes it so
that we can configure it elsewhere and

101
00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:29.820
it becomes easier to manage.

102
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.340
So what we're gonna do is we're
gonna add two new variables.

103
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.167
The first one is gonna be our
github-app-installation-id, and

104
00:05:37.167 --> 00:05:42.684
then the second one is going to be
our github-organization-name, right?

105
00:05:42.684 --> 00:05:47.043
Now the reason why we have both of
these is because as we've said before,

106
00:05:47.043 --> 00:05:51.331
Terraform Cloud doesn't really know
any of these things inherently,

107
00:05:51.331 --> 00:05:52.630
at least in our code.

108
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.485
It might know it on the Cloud website, but

109
00:05:55.485 --> 00:05:59.830
it won't know it in our
actual automation code.

110
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.996
And so this app installation ID,
we need to know that installation ID

111
00:06:04.996 --> 00:06:10.714
because this is what is in Terraform
Clouds database, basically, right?

112
00:06:10.714 --> 00:06:14.050
If we didn't have this, we'd have to
figure out another way of looking this up.

113
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.616
And I'll be honest,
this is the easiest way to manage this.

114
00:06:16.616 --> 00:06:17.460
Data lookups, and

115
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.400
stuff like that become a little bit
more challenging with app installations.

116
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.742
So I think this is the best
way to approach this.

117
00:06:23.742 --> 00:06:29.630
So what you're gonna do is, you're gonna
grab that app-installation-id that you

118
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:36.250
had from earlier, copy it, and we're just
gonna paste it right in here, right?

119
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.604
Then we can get this out of here,
and we're good.

120
00:06:40.604 --> 00:06:45.272
Now the only other thing we need to change
is the organization-name, all right?

121
00:06:45.272 --> 00:06:46.690
So we're gonna go here, and

122
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.893
you're gonna wanna give it
the github-organization-name.

123
00:06:49.893 --> 00:06:51.930
Now you might be like, well,
what's an organization?

124
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.051
Just user, it's just your username.

125
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:55.370
[LAUGH] Yeah, so it's just your username.

126
00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.847
My name is Erik Reinertsen.

127
00:07:01.464 --> 00:07:02.306
Cool.

128
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.215
So we've got those two, right?

129
00:07:08.215 --> 00:07:11.494
There's one other file we need to add,
and I'll put it up on the side so

130
00:07:11.494 --> 00:07:12.700
you guys have it.

131
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.050
And this is what is called a data file,
data.tf.

132
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.717
Now again, this is just a naming
convention, you can call it flibbity

133
00:07:19.717 --> 00:07:23.570
flurb, you can call it whatever you want,
[LAUGH] but I like to name the file

134
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.637
basically what all of the things are
inside it like I did with locals, right?

135
00:07:27.637 --> 00:07:31.546
So locals has locals, data has data.

136
00:07:31.546 --> 00:07:36.955
Data is essentially stuff that exists
outside of your current automation

137
00:07:36.955 --> 00:07:42.237
that you need to look up, right,
things that you need to find.

138
00:07:42.237 --> 00:07:48.065
And so what we really need to find
is our github-app-installation.

139
00:07:48.065 --> 00:07:50.191
And that's on the Terraform Cloud side.

140
00:07:50.191 --> 00:07:56.454
You guys see how we're slowly connecting
GitHub Terraform, we installed it, right?

141
00:07:56.454 --> 00:07:59.999
So now Terraform and
GitHub can communicate with each other.

142
00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:04.955
But we have to tell Terraform which
workspaces can have access to

143
00:08:04.955 --> 00:08:06.516
the installation so

144
00:08:06.516 --> 00:08:12.500
that we can set up that connection
between the workspace and the repository.

145
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.580
All we did was just authorize
Terraform to access it.

146
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.551
We didn't really tell it to
start syncing repos, right?

147
00:08:20.551 --> 00:08:27.180
And so what we wanna do is we want to
pass that variable to a data lookup.

148
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.255
This is really the equivalent
of an API call, right?

149
00:08:30.255 --> 00:08:34.932
It's gonna make an API call out to
Terraform Cloud and say, hey, I already

150
00:08:34.932 --> 00:08:39.683
know your organization, I already know
your user, so somewhere in there,

151
00:08:39.683 --> 00:08:44.370
there's got to be an installation
with this GitHub App ID in it.

152
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:49.740
If that's the case,
then I can find the Terraform side of it.

153
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.729
Once we have the Terraform side of it,
we can do one other thing.

154
00:08:55.170 --> 00:09:00.198
Which is we can then go
to our main.tf file, and

155
00:09:00.198 --> 00:09:08.514
we're gonna tell the workspace that it
needs to have what is called a VCS repo.

156
00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:12.108
Oops, right?

157
00:09:12.108 --> 00:09:15.356
So if we switch these, oops, sorry.

158
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:24.494
So if we switch these, get rid of
that really quickly, you can see that

159
00:09:24.494 --> 00:09:29.670
I've also added a new block of
configuration to the root of my workspace.

160
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:34.169
Now, why do I want this here?

161
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:41.219
Why am I telling something
that every workspace

162
00:09:41.219 --> 00:09:47.562
is going to be impacted by to
start tracking repositories?

163
00:09:47.562 --> 00:09:49.284
Why might I wanna do that?

164
00:09:49.284 --> 00:09:54.794
&gt;&gt; Because the workspaces are being
defined by those repositories.

165
00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:56.330
&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.

166
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.586
So the idea is is that we're
gonna have a one-to-one,

167
00:09:59.586 --> 00:10:02.720
where a workspace must have
a repo now going forward.

168
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.140
This is more of that chicken
before the egg scenario.

169
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:11.374
Where we didn't have a workspace, so
we had to create the workspace, right?

170
00:10:11.374 --> 00:10:15.163
We had a repo, but
we had to create the repo first so

171
00:10:15.163 --> 00:10:21.090
that we could then write the code to
then create the workspace, right?

172
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:25.371
However, after we committed that code and
we pushed it, nothing happened, right?

173
00:10:25.371 --> 00:10:29.874
And the whole idea behind that is
because although we have it set up,

174
00:10:29.874 --> 00:10:32.640
we don't have it connected yet, right?

175
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:38.310
And on top of that, we also know that
every workspace going forward from our

176
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:44.790
design, and again, I'll bring this up one
more time just so that you guys recall it,

177
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:49.928
but if we go back to our,
what's it called, the workflow, right?

178
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.986
Every workspace has a repo.

179
00:10:55.986 --> 00:11:00.921
So going forward,
we wanna make sure that every workspace we

180
00:11:00.921 --> 00:11:05.680
create asks for a repository,
and it must have that repo.

181
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.317
If it doesn't have it,
then it should not be created.

182
00:11:08.317 --> 00:11:12.396
This is a standardization
that we're setting, right?

183
00:11:12.396 --> 00:11:16.863
So that going forward you have to create
the repo so that we can then connect it.

184
00:11:16.863 --> 00:11:19.325
And that's why that connection
to GitHub is so important.

185
00:11:19.325 --> 00:11:23.627
Because going forward, Terraform has
to be able to access every single one

186
00:11:23.627 --> 00:11:26.030
of the repos that you need to use, right?
