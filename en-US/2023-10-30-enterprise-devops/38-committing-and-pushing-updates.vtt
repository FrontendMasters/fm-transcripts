1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.759
Great, we have it in state.

2
00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:08.469
And what's also cool is we can go to our
repositories right now and refresh them.

3
00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.845
And look, my tags are there now, right?

4
00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.822
I can see that my, well,
my about is still the same.

5
00:00:14.822 --> 00:00:18.160
But I can even go to Settings,
and then go to branches, and

6
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.406
then go to Edit, and I'll see all of
my branch protections are now set up.

7
00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:27.239
Require status checks, dismiss pull state,
require pull requests before merge.

8
00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.950
I can't even merge,
we cannot directly commit to main anymore.

9
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.340
We just locked ourselves out of that,
because we don't want that, right?

10
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.040
But during the bootstrap process,
we have to do that, right?

11
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.985
So really what happens is this
is the last step before we

12
00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:48.650
just fully are automated at this point.

13
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.114
So, yeah, we have our TFE repository.

14
00:00:53.114 --> 00:00:58.042
And then if I also go to my other repos,
we can see that I also have both of these,

15
00:00:58.042 --> 00:00:59.633
I've got the tag setup.

16
00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:06.318
And so now, we know that these two
are both set up properly, which is great.

17
00:01:06.318 --> 00:01:08.260
There's one other thing,
though we need to do.

18
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.085
Can anyone guess what that one last
step that we might need to do is?

19
00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:16.582
The next thing we wanna do is
we actually wanna make it so

20
00:01:16.582 --> 00:01:20.095
that this process is now 100% automated,
right?

21
00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:24.686
So we've pushed it,
it's in the state now, it exists, right?

22
00:01:24.686 --> 00:01:26.233
But we have no sink.

23
00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:28.429
If I push, it's still in local mode.

24
00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:30.280
Where do I go to enable sync?

25
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.765
&gt;&gt; Under the locals value for the GitHub.

26
00:01:34.765 --> 00:01:35.747
&gt;&gt; Not GitHub.

27
00:01:35.747 --> 00:01:37.120
&gt;&gt; I'll say, in the TFE.

28
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.680
&gt;&gt; Yep, why is it in TFE?

29
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.450
&gt;&gt; That's the control for
everything that we do going forward.

30
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.857
&gt;&gt; Exactly, in Terraform,
everything is managed in TFE now, okay?

31
00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:51.554
So if I wanna make it so
that a workspace, right,

32
00:01:51.554 --> 00:01:57.257
is actually able to do what I want it to,
I have to go into TFE and set that up.

33
00:01:57.257 --> 00:01:59.766
So we're gonna go into TFE, and hey, look,

34
00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:04.075
we already even knew this was gonna
happen, because we set it first as local.

35
00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:10.327
So I'm gonna get rid of that, and
I'm gonna type in remote, right?

36
00:02:10.327 --> 00:02:17.666
Now, I've committed my changes here,
right?

37
00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:21.961
But I can't push cuz I just
blocked myself out, right?

38
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:23.110
You have two options.

39
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.390
First option is actually make a branch,
[SOUND] or

40
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.634
you can do what I do,
which is just override it really quickly.

41
00:02:30.634 --> 00:02:32.111
And so that's what we're gonna do.

42
00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:37.013
So you can go to the repository,
you can go to Settings, go back to,

43
00:02:37.013 --> 00:02:40.713
oops, sorry, nope,
go back to Branches, Edit.

44
00:02:40.713 --> 00:02:44.220
And we're gonna go all the way down here,
and it says, do not allow bypassing.

45
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.171
This one little feature is actually
really nice, because it makes it for

46
00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:50.838
a period of time,
a really short period of time.

47
00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:53.600
You can disable this,
push up what you need to, and

48
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.051
then actually get into the pattern of
using your branches or stuff, or whatever.

49
00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:02.127
Another nice thing is the next time
that Terraform ply runs on GitHub,

50
00:03:02.127 --> 00:03:06.220
this will get reverted and
now my branch protection has been removed.

51
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.805
So again, just be aware, if you do
something like this, you really wanna make

52
00:03:10.805 --> 00:03:14.711
sure to [LAUGH] revert it, if not,
just run your GitHub plan again.

53
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:20.640
Okay, so really quickly,
we're gonna do git add locals.tf, right?

54
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.741
Make sure that that's there,
and then git commit -m.

55
00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.651
Make a github sync, right?

56
00:03:30.651 --> 00:03:34.284
I'm not gonna push yet, though, okay?

57
00:03:34.284 --> 00:03:37.940
The reason why is because I
haven't actually committed my

58
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.960
changes in GitHub yet, right?

59
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.372
So I planned and applied it, but I'm
about to tell it to start syncing, right?

60
00:03:46.372 --> 00:03:50.383
And so if I do that, it's gonna
basically think that it will try and

61
00:03:50.383 --> 00:03:51.897
delete things, right?

62
00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:56.757
So what we wanna do really quickly is we
wanna say git status, git add, backend.tf,

63
00:03:56.757 --> 00:04:00.216
locals.tf, main.tf, and
then variables.tf, right?

64
00:04:00.216 --> 00:04:05.934
Basically, everything in the GitHub
repo that we wanna commit, right?

65
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.889
And then we wanna do that branch
protection override one more time,

66
00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:15.762
all right?

67
00:04:15.762 --> 00:04:20.879
So now, I'm gonna go to my other repo,
and you can just change the URL.

68
00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:23.888
You can just go up here in your URL and
just change it from TFE to

69
00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:29.546
GitHub, And then go to Edit.

70
00:04:31.579 --> 00:04:36.083
And then scroll down and
change that again, right?

71
00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:39.600
And, again, it's okay, cuz we're
expecting this to run in a second.

72
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.054
So hit Save.

73
00:04:43.732 --> 00:04:48.517
Git commit -m, Initial

74
00:04:48.517 --> 00:04:53.586
setup, And then we git push.

75
00:04:56.756 --> 00:05:00.550
And you'll see I bypassed
a rule here as well.

76
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:07.251
Now, if I go to fem-eci-terraform-github,
we can see all of my stuff is here.

77
00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:12.101
So now, I can go back to tfe, right,

78
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:16.180
and then push as well, right?

79
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.984
So now, I've got both of my state pushed
up, everything is basically in sync.

80
00:05:21.984 --> 00:05:25.019
So what I wanna do now is
go back to Terraform Cloud.

81
00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:29.937
And you can see here,
here's my change and look at that,

82
00:05:29.937 --> 00:05:32.718
execution mode remote, okay?

83
00:05:32.718 --> 00:05:34.735
So I'm gonna Confirm and apply, cool.

84
00:05:34.735 --> 00:05:38.805
Okay, so now, what's gonna happen is
this is now set in remote mode, but

85
00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:41.577
you'll notice this time it didn't run,
right?

86
00:05:41.577 --> 00:05:45.239
Well, that's because when you set it in
remote for the first time, if it doesn't

87
00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:48.742
see or if it hadn't already seen any
changes, it's just not gonna run for us,

88
00:05:48.742 --> 00:05:52.170
which is actually good in this scenario,
because if it ran, it would fail.

89
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.162
Does anyone know why it would fail?

90
00:05:54.162 --> 00:05:57.801
&gt;&gt; It will try to create
repos that exist already and

91
00:05:57.801 --> 00:06:01.903
it probably doesn't have
access to the GitHub token.

92
00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:04.811
&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, it doesn't
have access to the GitHub token.

93
00:06:04.811 --> 00:06:08.468
So we need to add the GitHub
token to our eci workspace

94
00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:12.726
the same way that we added our
tfe token to our tfe workspace.

95
00:06:12.726 --> 00:06:17.702
We're gonna go to Settings,
Variable sets, create a variable set.

96
00:06:17.702 --> 00:06:24.583
We're gonna call this one, Fem-eci-github.

97
00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:27.237
I'm going to apply it to
a GitHub workspace, and

98
00:06:27.237 --> 00:06:29.782
then we're gonna add two variables, right?

99
00:06:29.782 --> 00:06:32.691
Cuz we know these are the two
variables that we need.

100
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:38.103
Oops, so first variable is gonna
be an environment variable,

101
00:06:38.103 --> 00:06:40.664
don't forget to click that.

102
00:06:40.664 --> 00:06:45.152
GITHUB_TOKEN, right, and
we need to get our token.

103
00:06:45.152 --> 00:06:47.249
Let me just move this off screen for
a second.

104
00:06:50.907 --> 00:06:53.282
I guess move that off screen too for
a second.

105
00:06:55.484 --> 00:06:59.472
So again, this is in Doppler, so
grab your GitHub token in Doppler.

106
00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:06.745
And paste that in,
hit Sensitive, and add variable.

107
00:07:06.745 --> 00:07:10.864
So now, you can see I have added
that variable, GITHUB_TOKEN.

108
00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:14.255
And then I'm gonna do one
more environment variable.

109
00:07:14.255 --> 00:07:18.900
And I'm gonna say, GITHUB_OWNER,

110
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.990
right, and then this is gonna be my name.

111
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.020
And again,
this doesn't have to be sensitive.

112
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.436
So now, we have a variable set for

113
00:07:29.436 --> 00:07:33.950
GITHUB_TOKEN and GITHUB_OWNER, cool?

114
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.114
I hit Create variable set, and

115
00:07:37.114 --> 00:07:42.471
now fem-eci-tfe is in
the Terraform workspace and

116
00:07:42.471 --> 00:07:48.086
fem-eci-github is in the GitHub workspace,
cool?

117
00:07:48.086 --> 00:07:52.832
So now, I can go to GitHub workspace and
hit New run up in the top, and

118
00:07:52.832 --> 00:07:54.263
hit Plan and apply.

119
00:08:07.392 --> 00:08:13.262
Hey, look at that, look at that.

120
00:08:13.262 --> 00:08:17.396
And hey, look at what it even realized,
look at that.

121
00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:21.045
It even saw that we disabled
branch protection, right?

122
00:08:21.045 --> 00:08:24.960
So it's like, no, no, no,
[LAUGH] we're re-enabling that.

123
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.032
Because why?

124
00:08:26.032 --> 00:08:28.470
Git is the source of truth, right?

125
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:32.928
So even if I go in, and I've done this
before, where I've made an override, and

126
00:08:32.928 --> 00:08:34.710
then two days later, I forgot.

127
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:35.990
Okay, so here's a good example.

128
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:39.158
We're working on Kubernetes clusters and

129
00:08:39.158 --> 00:08:43.650
our autoscaler needs a tag in
on an Amazon network resource.

130
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:48.789
But when we were experimenting with it,
my whole team was messing with it and

131
00:08:48.789 --> 00:08:52.340
I foolishly just went in and
added the tag manually.

132
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.822
I forgot that our Terraform network
automation also runs quite often.

133
00:08:56.822 --> 00:09:00.630
And so the other day, somebody went in
to work on their Kubernetes cluster and

134
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.390
they're like, my, autoscaling is not
working, [LAUGH] what's going on?

135
00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.588
And they're like, trying to figure it out,
trying to figure it out,

136
00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:07.383
trying to figure it out.

137
00:09:07.383 --> 00:09:09.830
And then one of them came to me and
was like, hi, this isn't working.

138
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:13.628
And I was like, I know why.

139
00:09:13.628 --> 00:09:16.513
[LAUGH] And so I went back and
sure enough it wasn't there.

140
00:09:16.513 --> 00:09:20.894
And I was like, this is why I did this,
I'm sorry, and we moved on.

141
00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:24.972
But yeah, the source of truth will
always be that going forward.

142
00:09:24.972 --> 00:09:29.782
Now, you might notice some other things
here like allow merge and [SOUND].

143
00:09:29.782 --> 00:09:35.734
Okay, when you use resources with
providers, they sometimes change.

144
00:09:35.734 --> 00:09:39.520
And on top of that, sometimes
there's bugs, don't get me wrong.

145
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.221
There's definitely bugs from time to
time when it comes to knowing what is

146
00:09:43.221 --> 00:09:45.080
the actual state of things, right?

147
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.101
We did technically apply this already.

148
00:09:48.101 --> 00:09:50.583
So the branch protections are in place,
the squash merge,

149
00:09:50.583 --> 00:09:51.783
all of this is already done.

150
00:09:51.783 --> 00:09:56.873
However, there's a bug right now
in the GitHub provider, which is

151
00:09:56.873 --> 00:10:02.781
that these commit messages should actually
be already in a PR title like this.

152
00:10:02.781 --> 00:10:05.009
You don't have to worry about this,
essentially.

153
00:10:05.009 --> 00:10:08.749
If you see variables in here that
are being set that you're like,

154
00:10:08.749 --> 00:10:13.033
I don't really know what this is,
you might wanna go out to the provider and

155
00:10:13.033 --> 00:10:15.550
just check to see is
there any bugs going on?

156
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.130
Is there anything like that?

157
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.860
These are all fine and safe for us,
so I'm not super worried about it.

158
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.644
But it's just something to note,
which is, remember,

159
00:10:24.644 --> 00:10:27.960
these are also things that are being
contributed to by developers.

160
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.115
They're gonna update stuff.

161
00:10:29.115 --> 00:10:33.035
GitHub is gonna update its API,
which then it comes to the resources,

162
00:10:33.035 --> 00:10:35.369
which then comes to your changes, okay?

163
00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:38.190
So that's the flow that
eventually kinda comes.

164
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.374
And so we're gonna hit Confirm and
apply here.

165
00:10:40.374 --> 00:10:42.010
It's gonna update our branch protections.

166
00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:45.693
Now, what's interesting is underneath
the hood, there's probably five or

167
00:10:45.693 --> 00:10:47.663
six API calls that it's making, right?

168
00:10:47.663 --> 00:10:49.725
That's the power of Terraform.

169
00:10:49.725 --> 00:10:52.419
It's gotta update a lot of things.

170
00:10:52.419 --> 00:10:54.032
But there we go.

171
00:10:54.032 --> 00:10:58.950
Now, we have Terraform Cloud fully
automated in a fully synchronized

172
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.465
set of changes with the source
of truth of GitOps.

173
00:11:02.465 --> 00:11:04.760
And we also have Terraform GitHub,

174
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.974
which is now powered by the source
of truth, which is our GitOps.

175
00:11:08.974 --> 00:11:13.762
So going forward, if we ever
create workspaces, where do we go?

176
00:11:13.762 --> 00:11:15.087
&gt;&gt; TFE.

177
00:11:15.087 --> 00:11:17.971
&gt;&gt; TFE, and
where do we wanna go if we create repos?

178
00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:18.753
&gt;&gt; GitHub.

179
00:11:18.753 --> 00:11:22.939
&gt;&gt; GitHub, right, and the automation repo,
right, for both of those.
