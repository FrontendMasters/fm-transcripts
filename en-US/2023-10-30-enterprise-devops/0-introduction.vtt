00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.306
Today is going to be a very great
start to hopefully what will be a very

2
00:00:04.306 --> 00:00:06.891
educational experience for all of you.

3
00:00:06.891 --> 00:00:11.610
We're going to be doing a workshop
on enterprise cloud infrastructure.

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.385
That might sound very daunting.

5
00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:19.521
[LAUGH] I have taken basically
the last six months of projects,

6
00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:23.585
things that I've built at
the company I work at.

7
00:00:23.585 --> 00:00:27.835
Things that I've built locally,
things that I've built on stream with my

8
00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:31.826
community, and I've accumulated
that into basically this course.

9
00:00:31.826 --> 00:00:36.329
And so the goal of this course, in a lot
of ways, hopefully, when you guys walk

10
00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.780
away from it, is to actually practically
know how to build infrastructure.

11
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.383
You might not build
the infrastructure that we build, but

12
00:00:43.383 --> 00:00:46.566
you should at least be able to see
the problems that you guys deal with and

13
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:47.968
take steps forward with that.

14
00:00:47.968 --> 00:00:50.404
So let's go and get started.

15
00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:53.697
First and foremost, hello there,
I am Erik Reinhart.

16
00:00:53.697 --> 00:00:57.270
This is also my follow message
every time you follow me on Twitch.

17
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.883
So for anyone who watches,
you'll appreciate that.

18
00:01:01.883 --> 00:01:05.139
I am a software engineer,
I'm a senior software engineer.

19
00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:08.146
I'm also known as Blackglasses online.

20
00:01:08.146 --> 00:01:11.632
So if you've ever heard anyone
call me BG or anything like that,

21
00:01:11.632 --> 00:01:13.970
that's my that's my tag on the Internet.

22
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.938
I am a content creator.

23
00:01:15.938 --> 00:01:20.169
I stream on the AltF4Stream on Twitch,
and we also do YouTube as well.

24
00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:22.908
I'm a flowchart artist, as I like to say.

25
00:01:22.908 --> 00:01:27.448
I fell in love with making flowcharts when
I started working with DevOps, and so

26
00:01:27.448 --> 00:01:30.658
it became a big part of what I do and
what I create as well.

27
00:01:30.658 --> 00:01:33.656
And then also, I'm a problem solver.

28
00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:38.504
I really wanted to kind of give you
guys a perspective of how I see

29
00:01:38.504 --> 00:01:43.278
myself because I do feel like it's
a part of why I am where I am.

30
00:01:43.278 --> 00:01:47.100
So my experience paths, I have
a pretty interesting experience path.

31
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.304
I started out in frontend, actually.

32
00:01:49.304 --> 00:01:55.129
I first started technically as a customer
support agent at a web hosting company,

33
00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:58.685
and then I started building
stuff on the CS floor.

34
00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:02.645
I got really excited about that, and
they started noticing me building things.

35
00:02:02.645 --> 00:02:05.012
And they were why is
the CS agent programming?

36
00:02:05.012 --> 00:02:08.184
And then they brought me over to
engineering about a year later and

37
00:02:08.184 --> 00:02:11.365
I started working on frontend for
a company called Media Temple.

38
00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:14.233
If you guys have ever heard of
Media Temple before, it's, or

39
00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:16.340
was, a pretty awesome web hosting company.

40
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.497
And I worked on the frontend for
that for about three years.

41
00:02:19.497 --> 00:02:24.993
I focused heavily on PHP,
the good old days, and

42
00:02:24.993 --> 00:02:31.039
CSS when it was sass and
lass and all of that fun stuff.

43
00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.450
And I did that, yeah,
for about three years.

44
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.536
And my curiosity is something
that's always led me towards

45
00:02:37.536 --> 00:02:39.425
the next part of my career.

46
00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:41.660
And so I started getting bored with it.

47
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.239
There's parts of programming frontend
which is really challenging, really fun,

48
00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.277
and really great.

49
00:02:47.277 --> 00:02:50.205
There's other parts to it which are adding
buttons and that's not very fun.

50
00:02:50.205 --> 00:02:53.841
[LAUGH] And I got to a point
where unfortunately the company

51
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:57.720
had focused more on selling
things than innovating things.

52
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.188
And so I felt that, and I was like,
I can't do this anymore.

53
00:03:01.188 --> 00:03:03.074
And so I actually led towards backend.

54
00:03:03.074 --> 00:03:06.212
I was like, all right, well,
let's try backend out.

55
00:03:06.212 --> 00:03:07.396
I've never done this before.

56
00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:10.900
And then I ended up actually
getting a job doing that.

57
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.874
I left Media Temple,
I went somewhere else.

58
00:03:13.874 --> 00:03:17.390
And I got a job doing backend for
about two and a half, three years.

59
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.262
And then once again, unfortunately,

60
00:03:19.262 --> 00:03:22.960
the company started becoming a little
bit more focused on just making money.

61
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.082
And so I kind of checked out there.

62
00:03:25.082 --> 00:03:26.862
And I led towards full stack.

63
00:03:26.862 --> 00:03:30.643
And what I started realizing through
this process was, is that one,

64
00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:34.358
I was accumulating knowledge of each
stack as I was going through and

65
00:03:34.358 --> 00:03:36.918
getting these different positions, right?

66
00:03:36.918 --> 00:03:40.193
But I was also learning what I liked and
what I didn't like.

67
00:03:40.193 --> 00:03:43.677
And that's really hard to do in this
industry from time to time, cuz there's so

68
00:03:43.677 --> 00:03:44.720
many things out there.

69
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.489
There's so many different ways and
so many different opportunities.

70
00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.290
And I get asked a lot,
how did you get to DevOps?

71
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.002
This is how.

72
00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:55.195
I kept following my curiosity.

73
00:03:55.195 --> 00:04:00.155
And so once I got into full stack,
and I really started seeing, wow,

74
00:04:00.155 --> 00:04:04.962
I can provision things and create
networks and all these other things.

75
00:04:04.962 --> 00:04:09.486
Interestingly enough,
I actually got a job position to start

76
00:04:09.486 --> 00:04:13.751
leaning into DevOps around my
third year into full stack.

77
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:18.021
And then that was when I just felt
deep down the rabbit hole and

78
00:04:18.021 --> 00:04:23.147
really became a problem solver,
which is really a lot of what DevOps is.

79
00:04:23.147 --> 00:04:27.376
So I really started focusing my career
on implementation, building things in

80
00:04:27.376 --> 00:04:31.614
frontend, and now today I'm supporting
those things and helping them grow.

81
00:04:31.614 --> 00:04:36.218
So welcome, [LAUGH] welcome to the course.

82
00:04:36.218 --> 00:04:40.489
So the introduction to the course, this is
actually two things I did in this course.

83
00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:41.990
One of them was I added a lot of GIFs.

84
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.243
Two, there are quotes from
AI in between here, so

85
00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:49.431
we get to see what AI's perspective
on some of these things are.

86
00:04:49.431 --> 00:04:52.794
So an introduction to the course,
the first quote we have is,

87
00:04:52.794 --> 00:04:57.596
if you don't know what problem you're
solving, you can't solve them, thanks, AI.

88
00:04:57.596 --> 00:05:01.181
[LAUGH] And so the reality of it is
that what we're really trying to do

89
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:04.716
is we wanna build off of what we
learned in DevOps for Developers.

90
00:05:04.716 --> 00:05:08.609
And really try and figure out what
problems we have to solve, right?

91
00:05:08.609 --> 00:05:09.866
And how we're going to solve them.

92
00:05:09.866 --> 00:05:13.540
So taking what we learned from
the previous course, right?

93
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.128
We want to break down common
problems an organization has, right?

94
00:05:17.128 --> 00:05:18.900
These are just common problems.

95
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.287
And a lot of the things about this in
this process is just think simply.

96
00:05:23.287 --> 00:05:27.715
We don't have to overcomplicate and
go super down the rabbit hole just yet.

97
00:05:27.715 --> 00:05:29.133
We're a brand new company.

98
00:05:29.133 --> 00:05:32.677
What are just the simple problems we're
gonna deal with out the gate, right?

99
00:05:32.677 --> 00:05:37.763
Secondly, and this is very important,
who are we solving these problems for?

100
00:05:37.763 --> 00:05:40.984
Right, when we talk about money and
we talk about a company,

101
00:05:40.984 --> 00:05:45.154
if you can't validate what that money's
going towards, then it's really,

102
00:05:45.154 --> 00:05:49.513
sometimes it's a situation where you might
have to take a step back and go, okay,

103
00:05:49.513 --> 00:05:52.126
I might just be solving this for
myself, right?

104
00:05:52.126 --> 00:05:55.350
Explain why it's important to
solve these problems, right?

105
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.903
So once you've decided, okay,
what the problem is, how do I identify it?

106
00:05:59.903 --> 00:06:03.011
We're gonna then explain, well,
why is it important to solve it?

107
00:06:03.011 --> 00:06:07.043
If you get past that, if you get past all
three of those, then we get to a point

108
00:06:07.043 --> 00:06:11.036
where we can actually build something
that we feel confident in building.

109
00:06:11.036 --> 00:06:14.946
So that's that's a big part of the course
that we're gonna be trying to do with

110
00:06:14.946 --> 00:06:16.616
everything we do in this course.

111
00:06:16.616 --> 00:06:19.850
So is DevOps for Developers
course required for this course?

112
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.260
No, it's not.

113
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.930
Not at all, but it will help.

114
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.009
The DevOps for Developers course does
a great job of creating fundamentals for

115
00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:30.490
you as well to help you understand
just what the DevOps mindset is.

116
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.624
I don't think it's required, but
if you wanna truly understand

117
00:06:34.624 --> 00:06:39.299
the fundamentals of how to think in
DevOps world, I do think it'll help.

118
00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:40.347
Should you watch it?

119
00:06:40.347 --> 00:06:41.318
Yes, you should.

120
00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:43.665
[LAUGH] I highly recommend watching it.

121
00:06:43.665 --> 00:06:45.620
I think we did a great job on it.
