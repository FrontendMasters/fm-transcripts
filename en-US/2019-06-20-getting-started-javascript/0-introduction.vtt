00:00:03.876 --> 00:00:05.671
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:08.133
This is Getting Into JavaScript.

3
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.106
I'm Kyle Simpson.

4
00:00:09.106 --> 00:00:13.257
A lot of you I know and
either know online or in person.

5
00:00:13.257 --> 00:00:17.030
So if you find me online,
you can always look for Getify,

6
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.498
that's my Gmail address,
my Twitter, my GitHub.

7
00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:22.754
There's lots of places to find me online.

8
00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:26.419
So any time that you are going
through this course, or afterwards,

9
00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.954
reviewing things, feel free to
find me online under Getify, and

10
00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:32.390
reach out with any feedback, questions.

11
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.325
I love getting to help people
learn about JavaScript.

12
00:00:36.325 --> 00:00:39.050
This is what I do for a living,
I just travel all over and

13
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.367
teach this kind of stuff.

14
00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:45.670
And it's a particular joy to teach
this exact course because getting

15
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.347
into JavaScript is really
the bootstrapping, if you will.

16
00:00:50.347 --> 00:00:52.888
It's the first steps for some of you,

17
00:00:52.888 --> 00:00:56.151
maybe never having done
any programming at all.

18
00:00:56.151 --> 00:01:00.440
And that's really exciting to see because
we know that a couple of years from now

19
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.975
you'll be mid and senior level
developers at at an amazing jobs.

20
00:01:03.975 --> 00:01:06.938
And it's cool to be part of
this first initial steps.

21
00:01:06.938 --> 00:01:10.048
So I'm excited to jump into
that journey with you.

22
00:01:10.048 --> 00:01:13.206
Let's dive in and
let's start talking about JavaScript.

23
00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:15.877
We'll first actually
look at programming and

24
00:01:15.877 --> 00:01:19.516
then programming specifically
in the context of JavaScript.

25
00:01:19.516 --> 00:01:21.557
As a companion to go
along with this course,

26
00:01:21.557 --> 00:01:24.053
I wanna point out one of
the books that I've written.

27
00:01:24.053 --> 00:01:26.419
This is in the You Don't Know JS
book series, and

28
00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:28.163
many of you know about that series.

29
00:01:28.163 --> 00:01:31.634
You can read the entire six-book
series for free online, and

30
00:01:31.634 --> 00:01:34.651
there's a link to the GitHub
repo here in the slides.

31
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:38.902
But they've also been published
officially as regular books.

32
00:01:38.902 --> 00:01:42.889
So you can find those any place that you
buy books online like Amazon and so forth.

33
00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:46.108
But the first book of that
series is called Up and Going.

34
00:01:46.108 --> 00:01:49.137
And I wanted to just
sort of frame that book.

35
00:01:49.137 --> 00:01:53.347
So the first chapter of that book is about
I've never done any programming before.

36
00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:56.710
What is a program, what is a line of code,
what is a statement?

37
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.332
And if you're in that boat, that's exactly
where chapter one was written for you.

38
00:02:00.332 --> 00:02:04.271
And the first part of our discussion
today will kinda quickly review some of

39
00:02:04.271 --> 00:02:08.085
those basic concepts, just in case any
of you have maybe never heard some

40
00:02:08.085 --> 00:02:11.038
of those words like statements or
expressions before.

41
00:02:11.038 --> 00:02:15.674
But this book should be seen as a
companion to this course to help you sort

42
00:02:15.674 --> 00:02:19.403
of as a roadmap go into more
detail on any of these topics.

43
00:02:19.403 --> 00:02:22.577
So if we say something, if we move
a little too quick on something,

44
00:02:22.577 --> 00:02:24.407
make sure you dive back into the book.

45
00:02:24.407 --> 00:02:27.445
Chapter one is all about I've
never programmed before and

46
00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:30.919
Chapter 2 is all about,
have done some programming before.

47
00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.094
I understand if statements and
for loops, but

48
00:02:33.094 --> 00:02:35.565
I've never really done
anything with JavaScript.

49
00:02:35.565 --> 00:02:40.140
What do I need to know to really
get up and going with JavaScript?

50
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.540
That's what chapter two is all about.

51
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.690
It goes into all the things that we'll
cover today, but in much more detail.

52
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.546
So look through chapter two.

53
00:02:46.546 --> 00:02:48.480
And then finally,
chapter three of this book,

54
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.870
that's it, it's only three chapters,
70 or 80 pages long.

55
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.592
But chapter three of the book is all
about orienting you to where to look for

56
00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:58.310
more information throughout
the rest of the series.

57
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.168
So it covers or it highlights and
overviews each one of the things that

58
00:03:03.168 --> 00:03:06.625
all the other five books
in this series focus on.

59
00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:10.202
So I definitely encourage you to go and
either read online for free or

60
00:03:10.202 --> 00:03:11.706
pick up a copy of this book and

61
00:03:11.706 --> 00:03:15.120
use this as your companion guide
as we go throughout the course.

62
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.657
The most common thing that people talk
about when they talk about starting a new

63
00:03:20.657 --> 00:03:25.107
programming language or starting the idea
of programming or maybe a new framework or

64
00:03:25.107 --> 00:03:26.689
a new tool is the Hello World.

65
00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.429
How do I make it say Hello World?

66
00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:34.248
And I wanted to give you just a quick
glimpse of a sort of Hello Worldish

67
00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:36.335
kind of JavaScript program.

68
00:03:36.335 --> 00:03:38.258
Obviously it doesn't
literally say Hello World.

69
00:03:38.258 --> 00:03:42.833
But it's just a quick glimpse, and by the
end of our discussion today you should be

70
00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:45.816
fully and
completely confident in this sort of code,

71
00:03:45.816 --> 00:03:49.547
being able to write this sort of thing for
yourself in JavaScript.

72
00:03:49.547 --> 00:03:52.682
So we have a couple of things that
are starting off right at the beginning.

73
00:03:52.682 --> 00:03:56.775
We've got a variable called teacher and
another one called twitterHandle and

74
00:03:56.775 --> 00:03:58.083
another one called age.

75
00:03:58.083 --> 00:03:59.546
And then we have this
thing called a function.

76
00:03:59.546 --> 00:04:03.808
The function whoAmI that takes some
inputs, those are called parameters.

77
00:04:03.808 --> 00:04:06.120
You see on line 6 a console.log,

78
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.807
that's how we print things
to the developer console.

79
00:04:09.807 --> 00:04:12.007
And then down on line 12, the whoAmI,

80
00:04:12.007 --> 00:04:14.810
that reference is actually
calling the function.

81
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.743
So if any of those things that I just said
in the last 20 seconds were like, wait,

82
00:04:18.743 --> 00:04:20.806
calling a function, what does that mean?

83
00:04:20.806 --> 00:04:23.787
Don't worry,
we're gonna get into all of those things.

84
00:04:23.787 --> 00:04:27.663
So this is the kind of code that we want
to be able to dive into and be totally

85
00:04:27.663 --> 00:04:32.072
confident on so that it's our foundation
for exploring the rest of the language.

86
00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:35.845
So that's our motivation for this course
that we're going to dive into today.

87
00:04:35.845 --> 00:04:39.660
But before we move on,
let's actually see that code running.

88
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.278
I've got that code loaded up in
a run JS environment this is one of

89
00:04:43.278 --> 00:04:44.352
my favorite ones.

90
00:04:44.352 --> 00:04:47.597
You can, of course,
also use something like a Chrome console,

91
00:04:47.597 --> 00:04:51.761
the developer console, or even use on
the command line something like Node.js.

92
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:53.234
But I'm gonna run this code.

93
00:04:53.234 --> 00:04:56.998
You'll notice I have the teacher,
twitterHandle, age, the function.

94
00:04:56.998 --> 00:05:00.062
I'm gonna run this code and
we'll see the output here on the right.

95
00:05:00.062 --> 00:05:02.024
You'll notice that it has
printed out a string.

96
00:05:02.024 --> 00:05:05.938
Hi, I'm Kyle, aka getify,
and I'm 39 years old.

97
00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:10.059
Now, if I had done this workshop
a few months ago, back before my most

98
00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:14.481
recent birthday, and I was 38,
if we change that value and we rerun it.

99
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.596
You'll notice that the value changed.

100
00:05:16.596 --> 00:05:21.201
Or if I, for some reason or another,
decided to change my Twitter

101
00:05:21.201 --> 00:05:25.157
handle to theGetify,
then we could change that value.

102
00:05:25.157 --> 00:05:28.333
And now you see that the value
changing every time we run it.

103
00:05:28.333 --> 00:05:31.648
So that's an example of the kinds of
things that you're gonna wanna play with

104
00:05:31.648 --> 00:05:33.138
as you go throughout this course.

105
00:05:33.138 --> 00:05:36.925
You're gonna wanna try the code, but it's
most important that you write the code and

106
00:05:36.925 --> 00:05:37.512
then run it.

107
00:05:37.512 --> 00:05:41.771
So make sure you're familiar with one of
these environments where you can execute

108
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:44.681
the code and
see those results hands-on for yourself.
