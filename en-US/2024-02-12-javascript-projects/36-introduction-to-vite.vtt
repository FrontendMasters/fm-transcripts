WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:08.820
With that,
let's learn a new hot tool, [LAUGH].

2
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.376
Okay, so at some point, we do need to pick
some tools to do some things, like for

3
00:00:13.376 --> 00:00:17.473
example, we picked a JavaScript to
write some code for the browser in.

4
00:00:17.473 --> 00:00:19.875
And that's not even our only choice,

5
00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:25.054
there's lots of other languages that we
can use to write for an ENCODE, but we're

6
00:00:25.054 --> 00:00:30.555
going to stick with JavaScript because
it's been doing the web favor since 1995.

7
00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:36.068
So the, The tool

8
00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:40.766
that we're gonna talk
about now is called Vite,

9
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:44.792
you can read all about it at vitejs.dev.

10
00:00:44.792 --> 00:00:49.918
And it is a tool that has become,
in my experience,

11
00:00:49.918 --> 00:00:53.139
increasingly known and used and

12
00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:58.673
liked in the JavaScript world for
a few reasons.

13
00:00:58.673 --> 00:01:04.313
One of them is that it does some very
fancy magic for your developer experience

14
00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:09.344
as you are building and like iterating
on a project of a certain type,

15
00:01:09.344 --> 00:01:13.682
which we'll talk about later,
that does things like, for

16
00:01:13.682 --> 00:01:18.540
example, allows you to change one
little part of your code base and

17
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.400
instantly see that update on your
test page that you're looking at

18
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.064
where we're looking things
that localhost and whatever.

19
00:01:28.064 --> 00:01:32.054
And it'll just instantly update all of
these things underneath the hood without

20
00:01:32.054 --> 00:01:34.459
you having to go in and
like reload everything and

21
00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:36.994
reset everything else that
you'd already set up.

22
00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:38.713
So, there's some fanciness there,

23
00:01:38.713 --> 00:01:42.530
there's lots more fanciness to read
about on the website and whatever.

24
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.300
It also, it integrates and supports with
a whole bunch of different frameworks.

25
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.335
So it's not like a React ecosystem tool,
or a view ecosystem tool.

26
00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:54.986
Although there is a lot of the view and
Vite,

27
00:01:54.986 --> 00:02:00.414
folks are quite close, so
there is a lot of view related things for

28
00:02:00.414 --> 00:02:05.249
it, but there's also a ton of
other React tooling for it,

29
00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:08.626
and vanilla stuff, and all this stuff.

30
00:02:08.626 --> 00:02:12.682
So, the other thing is thing is
that it uses another super popular

31
00:02:12.682 --> 00:02:17.034
tool called Rollup, which we're not
gonna get into the details of but

32
00:02:17.034 --> 00:02:20.064
it has this very open
kind of plug in system.

33
00:02:20.064 --> 00:02:23.602
So people can write little plug-ins
that help you as a developer with your

34
00:02:23.602 --> 00:02:27.384
developer workflow, you can kind of
customize it with this plug-in system.

35
00:02:27.384 --> 00:02:29.472
So that's why a lot of people like it for
JavaScript.

36
00:02:29.472 --> 00:02:35.564
Now, why are we talking about this
tool in the context of this course?

37
00:02:35.564 --> 00:02:40.385
So, the reason that I chose this here
is because I think it's approachable,

38
00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:44.982
I think it's like you don't have to
learn a whole new set of things in order

39
00:02:44.982 --> 00:02:47.409
to kinda get productive.

40
00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:52.289
It's also pretty widely used these
days for certain types of projects,

41
00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:56.289
single page apps with perhaps
a framework perhaps not, but

42
00:02:56.289 --> 00:03:01.169
basically like not a not the most
massive web app that you've ever seen,

43
00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:06.049
but something that's on the scale of
what we've been doing and bigger,

44
00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.875
but yeah,
in this kind of order of magnitude.

45
00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:14.195
And it provides lots of useful rabbit
holes for learning more about like how all

46
00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:17.793
of this tooling works,
all of the different options and magic and

47
00:03:17.793 --> 00:03:22.158
things that are happening, other tools
in the ecosystem like Rollup, etc.

48
00:03:22.158 --> 00:03:26.628
So, it's kind of, I think,
a good entry point, a main,

49
00:03:26.628 --> 00:03:31.285
if you will, for getting into
a whole bunch of other tools and

50
00:03:31.285 --> 00:03:35.128
frameworks and concepts and
in dev tooling.

51
00:03:35.128 --> 00:03:40.023
That's why I picked it, if you hate it,
that's cool, go use something else,

52
00:03:40.023 --> 00:03:42.946
but we're just gonna use
it a little bit here and

53
00:03:42.946 --> 00:03:46.330
hopefully it's gonna make
our lives a little easier.
