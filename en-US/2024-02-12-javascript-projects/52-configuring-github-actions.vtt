WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.593
I am going to go to my project
github.com/vakil/selfie-cam,

2
00:00:07.593 --> 00:00:09.903
is what I called it.

3
00:00:09.903 --> 00:00:14.127
And for you all, you can go to your own

4
00:00:14.127 --> 00:00:19.168
project if you have pushed it to GitHub,
and

5
00:00:19.168 --> 00:00:27.497
if not we can do this in our own time
with those Git instructions earlier.

6
00:00:27.497 --> 00:00:31.844
If you haven't set up a GitHub repository
before, once you've logged in and made

7
00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:36.065
an account, you can go to this plus button
up here and create a new repository and

8
00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:40.497
it'll walk you through the steps to
get your code up into that repository.

9
00:00:40.497 --> 00:00:43.957
But in any case,
in this case I have a repository, so

10
00:00:43.957 --> 00:00:46.168
let's just zoom in a little bit.

11
00:00:46.168 --> 00:00:50.516
There's a settings, a tab panel,
whatever we want to call it up here,

12
00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:54.863
with a whole bunch of settings,
like for example, what is it called and

13
00:00:54.863 --> 00:00:59.877
what's the default branch and all this
stuff, we're not gonna go into all of it.

14
00:00:59.877 --> 00:01:04.996
But there is a pages
item in the sidebar here,

15
00:01:04.996 --> 00:01:10.925
and the pages page is gonna
have all kinds of settings

16
00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:17.956
here that again you can read
all about at your leisure.

17
00:01:17.956 --> 00:01:21.669
But what we want to be doing here,
is we want to to be, and

18
00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:26.703
yours might look a little bit different
coz I have already started this up.

19
00:01:26.703 --> 00:01:32.133
But what we're gonna do is we're
gonna get even fancier and

20
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:37.780
we're gonna use GitHubs built
in actions to help us deploy our

21
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.765
Vite site automatically when we
push new code to our main branch.

22
00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:48.545
So you can choose that
option which is in data.

23
00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:53.045
But there is also another option which is
that you can have a different branch like

24
00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:54.445
a GH minus pages branch.

25
00:01:54.445 --> 00:02:00.121
This is also common, that only when
you push to that branch, will it run,

26
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:06.710
it's kind of, it'll look for a typical
site and it'll kind of run that for you.

27
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.549
But in this case,
we're gonna use GitHub Actions.

28
00:02:12.735 --> 00:02:14.128
So, okay.

29
00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:23.449
Luckily, the Vite team
has made a handy dandy

30
00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:29.006
walk through of what we
need to know in order to

31
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:34.149
deploy our Vite project as a static site.

32
00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:40.176
So static site, meaning once we've
built our site with npm run build,

33
00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:43.798
we essentially, if we go look in our dist,

34
00:02:48.962 --> 00:02:54.256
Dist directory here,
wrong direction, okay.

35
00:02:54.256 --> 00:02:57.691
We essentially just have some files.

36
00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:00.086
[LAUGH] We have an HTML file.

37
00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:05.039
We have some CSS and some JavaScript.

38
00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:09.782
These are just static files as opposed to
a website where I also have a whole server

39
00:03:09.782 --> 00:03:13.201
that is dynamically running and
responding to changes and

40
00:03:13.201 --> 00:03:17.178
perhaps messing with the content
of the front end, upper monitor,

41
00:03:17.178 --> 00:03:20.408
all kinds of other things
that could be happening.

42
00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:25.245
In this case, we just have, it's
essentially the same thing that we were

43
00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:28.053
doing before of just having a .html file,

44
00:03:28.053 --> 00:03:32.111
just with a lot of fanciness of
bringing in all those modules,

45
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:38.328
bundling it all up in one minified and
optimized JavaScript file, all that stuff.

46
00:03:38.328 --> 00:03:42.647
So that's what we're doing when we're
deploying a static site, is we are just

47
00:03:42.647 --> 00:03:46.642
taking these files and putting them on
the interwebs somewhere, [LAUGH] So

48
00:03:46.642 --> 00:03:50.636
that people can go to a URL and that'll
run a get request and that will fetch

49
00:03:50.636 --> 00:03:54.851
these files and then they will run in
the browser and we will have a Selfie Cam.

50
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:59.562
Okay, so for static sites

51
00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:07.824
The Vite team has given us a lovely guide,
and it also walks through

52
00:04:07.824 --> 00:04:12.285
the other options for using, and
it tells us how we gotta build,

53
00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:17.242
and make sure locally with preview
that things are looking okay, and so

54
00:04:17.242 --> 00:04:20.575
on and so forth, and
we can change things here.

55
00:04:20.575 --> 00:04:25.571
But it'll tell us also for
GitHub Pages and if you scroll down,

56
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:30.387
there's other options like GitLab Pages,
Netlify, etc.

57
00:04:31.827 --> 00:04:35.697
But we'll use GitHub Pages just for
convenience.

58
00:04:35.697 --> 00:04:39.987
And so it's gonna walk us through
the steps we need to follow.

59
00:04:39.987 --> 00:04:43.610
Okay, so
we're gonna kind of do this together.

60
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.877
And if questions come up,
please let's shout them out,

61
00:04:46.877 --> 00:04:49.270
coz probably other people have them too.

62
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.040
Okay, so we first of all
wanna set the correct base.

63
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.684
We said before, we want to,
since we probably, we don't have one yet,

64
00:04:57.684 --> 00:05:01.677
unless you all did some
configuring ahead of the game.

65
00:05:01.677 --> 00:05:06.377
We want to create a vite.config.js
file in our project.

66
00:05:06.377 --> 00:05:10.858
What this might look like, and
by the way, this define config, this is

67
00:05:10.858 --> 00:05:16.277
essentially just so that you can get
some helpful auto-complete from VS Code.

68
00:05:16.277 --> 00:05:18.453
It's not,
you could also just have like an,

69
00:05:18.453 --> 00:05:21.624
there's a whole Vite page about
the config file and everything.

70
00:05:21.624 --> 00:05:24.587
But for now, we can just do this,
and then if we're in code,

71
00:05:24.587 --> 00:05:26.522
we also get some helpful suggestions.

72
00:05:26.522 --> 00:05:30.395
Once I start defining a config, and

73
00:05:30.395 --> 00:05:35.432
I'm like, okay, what options do I have?

74
00:05:35.432 --> 00:05:39.792
And it's like, well,
I know about a user config base property,

75
00:05:39.792 --> 00:05:43.995
which is the base public path when
served in both development or

76
00:05:43.995 --> 00:05:47.546
in either development or production.

77
00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:50.516
And so the default is just slash.

78
00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:56.517
So just basically, this would be
equivalent to like anjanette.dev/.

79
00:05:56.517 --> 00:06:03.482
Or if we're using GitHub Pages out of the
box without configuring a custom domain,

80
00:06:03.482 --> 00:06:07.376
we get a site that's vakila.github.io/.

81
00:06:07.376 --> 00:06:11.914
And we're kind of barreling through this,
but

82
00:06:11.914 --> 00:06:15.885
[LAUGH] So
if we are deploying to that site,

83
00:06:15.885 --> 00:06:20.197
this is what GitHub Pages
refers to as a user or

84
00:06:20.197 --> 00:06:24.856
project, sorry, a user or
organization site.

85
00:06:24.856 --> 00:06:30.404
So for example I might have my personal
website hosted at vakila.github.io,

86
00:06:30.404 --> 00:06:31.326
let's say.

87
00:06:31.326 --> 00:06:35.961
And I might have a repository called
vakila.github.io in my GitHub account that

88
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:37.245
corresponds to that.

89
00:06:38.525 --> 00:06:46.583
But in our case, we have something more
like a project repository, a project site,

90
00:06:46.583 --> 00:06:54.315
which is where this is going to be
named something else like Selfie Cam.

91
00:06:54.315 --> 00:06:59.158
And so out of the box I get
vakila.github.io/selfiecam for

92
00:06:59.158 --> 00:07:05.039
this project site, if I don't configure
a custom domain or what have you.

93
00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:10.951
So, what that means is that we need to set

94
00:07:10.951 --> 00:07:16.159
the base to slash the name of our repo,
slash.

95
00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:16.999
And for now,

96
00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:21.984
that's hopefully all the config [LAUGH]
We're gonna need to do at the moment.

97
00:07:21.984 --> 00:07:26.015
Because we already have supported all
of those slightly older browsers in

98
00:07:26.015 --> 00:07:29.007
the production environment
with things like our Ify,

99
00:07:29.007 --> 00:07:33.299
Immediately invoked Function Expression,
so that if the browser that my user

100
00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:36.960
has doesn't have the fanciness
of top-level 0, 8, no probs.

101
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.495
Okay, and by the way, behind the scenes,
when we run npm run build,

102
00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:47.365
and it's looking at all those
different browser targets.

103
00:07:47.365 --> 00:07:52.405
It is doing some fancy magic to
reinterpret our JavaScript syntax

104
00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:57.455
into syntax that even older browsers
would be able to interpret.

105
00:07:58.725 --> 00:08:02.113
But it doesn't go that far [LAUGH] back.

106
00:08:02.113 --> 00:08:05.513
Okay, so back to our guide.

107
00:08:05.513 --> 00:08:10.183
All right, so now we go to that
settings page in our repository.

108
00:08:12.103 --> 00:08:13.880
That Pages tab, yeah.

109
00:08:17.016 --> 00:08:25.034
And this is where, wrong, this is where
we're gonna start choosing GitHub Actions.

110
00:08:25.034 --> 00:08:29.944
And GitHub Actions is a whole,
is there a course about CI and CD and?

111
00:08:29.944 --> 00:08:32.144
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Enterprise UI Development.

112
00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:34.714
&gt;&gt; The Enterprise UI Development
course probably covers a lot of this.

113
00:08:34.714 --> 00:08:40.003
GitHub Actions is essentially
a whole thing that is

114
00:08:40.003 --> 00:08:46.153
[LAUGH] intended to allow us to
automate certain workflows or

115
00:08:46.153 --> 00:08:54.640
certain things that happen when certain
events occur related to our repository,

116
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.560
for example,
when we push to a certain branch,

117
00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.726
we want to build our site
with an npm run build which

118
00:09:04.726 --> 00:09:10.138
is gonna run V-build, and
then we want to set it up to

119
00:09:10.138 --> 00:09:15.429
go up onto GitHub pages and
deploy to GitHub pages.

120
00:09:15.429 --> 00:09:22.170
So luckily we don't have to learn
everything about defining GitHub Actions,

121
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:27.377
jobs and workflows here today
coz the amazing V team has given

122
00:09:27.377 --> 00:09:32.992
us a sample configuration file
which this is gonna be a YAML file,

123
00:09:32.992 --> 00:09:38.299
that is going to, YAML is just
another type of, it's like yet

124
00:09:38.299 --> 00:09:42.927
another markup language,
it's another key value.

125
00:09:42.927 --> 00:09:46.967
It's an alternative to Jason in many
places, but that's what GitHub uses.

126
00:09:46.967 --> 00:09:50.813
And there's a whole bunch of
stuff in here that we can, again,

127
00:09:50.813 --> 00:09:54.822
go into the GitHub Pages,
GitHub Actions doc and read all about.

128
00:09:54.822 --> 00:10:00.722
But suffice it to say
that it's going to create

129
00:10:00.722 --> 00:10:06.169
a deploy job which GitHub
is going to run for

130
00:10:06.169 --> 00:10:13.295
us according to the declaratively
provided settings.

131
00:10:13.295 --> 00:10:17.361
So we can, if we're reading through
this we can see there's a few steps,

132
00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:20.379
we're doing some npm installs,
some npm run builds,

133
00:10:20.379 --> 00:10:24.710
we can read through all of this and
kind of familiarize ourselves to it later.

134
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:28.333
And so, and it's also based upon some
other kind of out-of-the-box actions that

135
00:10:28.333 --> 00:10:30.930
GitHub provides to make it
easier to work with pages.

136
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:34.260
Anyway, we don't need to
know all of this right now.

137
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:39.997
We need to know that we're
telling it to do this thing on,

138
00:10:39.997 --> 00:10:45.206
almost like an event listener,
a push to the main branch.

139
00:10:45.206 --> 00:10:52.086
That's when this whole
deploy job is gonna run.

140
00:10:53.126 --> 00:10:57.081
But for our intents and purposes,
we just press this copy button right here.

141
00:10:57.081 --> 00:10:59.956
[LAUGH] And we go into pages.

142
00:11:02.738 --> 00:11:09.672
Sorry, we make sure that our
GitHub Actions is selected here.

143
00:11:09.672 --> 00:11:16.435
And then we'll notice we
also have Actions tab.

144
00:11:16.435 --> 00:11:21.519
And if you, so probably when you have for
the first time selected GitHub Actions,

145
00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:26.230
I think it had a little wizard, but if
you ever want to go define a new Action,

146
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:31.186
you can go to this Actions tab and you can
see all of the fun things that I've had.

147
00:11:31.186 --> 00:11:34.689
We can create a new workflow, and

148
00:11:34.689 --> 00:11:39.319
it'll give me a whole bunch of options,
and

149
00:11:39.319 --> 00:11:45.577
I can walk through this kind
of these wizards and whatever,

150
00:11:45.577 --> 00:11:52.962
or I can just create a something.yaml
file within a special directory

151
00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:57.990
in my project called .github/workflows/.

152
00:11:59.765 --> 00:12:05.329
And so here's where I can put
a file like deploy GitHub Pages or

153
00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:10.358
something like that,
deploy pages maybe, whatever,

154
00:12:10.358 --> 00:12:15.402
deploy site, make it go,
whatever you want to call it.

155
00:12:16.442 --> 00:12:21.836
And that's where I can paste all of
my [LAUGH] fabulously Pre-configured,

156
00:12:21.836 --> 00:12:23.752
thank you, V team, job.

157
00:12:23.752 --> 00:12:27.667
And true, we can tweak this,
we can do whatever.

158
00:12:27.667 --> 00:12:32.686
So for example, in my Selfie Cam,
yes, I want to discard these

159
00:12:32.686 --> 00:12:38.658
pages coz if you go look at my repo,
github.com/vakila/selfie-cam,

160
00:12:38.658 --> 00:12:43.494
you will see there is already
this .github/workflows with

161
00:12:43.494 --> 00:12:49.696
the deploypages.yaml file that is
essentially what we all want to have now.

162
00:12:49.696 --> 00:12:53.002
And it's the same content
