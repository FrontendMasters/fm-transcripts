WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.231 --> 00:00:05.536
All right, time for a quick win, I think.

2
00:00:05.536 --> 00:00:09.706
We all need a few more W's in the day,
right?

3
00:00:09.706 --> 00:00:15.638
So our mission, should we choose to
accept it, is to have a dialogue.

4
00:00:15.638 --> 00:00:19.919
I don't mean just a chat,
although we will be chatting,

5
00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.409
of course,
with each other about dialogues.

6
00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:27.598
But dialogues in the web [LAUGH] world,
in HTML,

7
00:00:27.598 --> 00:00:33.778
are a way that we can essentially
create kind of sub [LAUGH] not windows,

8
00:00:33.778 --> 00:00:38.702
but sub interfaces,
not in the object oriented sense,

9
00:00:38.702 --> 00:00:41.677
but in the user interface sense.

10
00:00:41.677 --> 00:00:46.963
Which, for example, we've all seen
a million times, the little thing pops up,

11
00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:51.636
the rest of the background is blurred,
and we have to say no, thank you,

12
00:00:51.636 --> 00:00:56.411
I don't wanna subscribe to your
newsletter, or whatever it is, right?

13
00:00:56.411 --> 00:00:59.609
We've been there, and
now we make it our mission to do that so

14
00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.006
that other people can
have that experience.

15
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:07.314
No, but dialogues are very useful for
a lot of things.

16
00:01:07.314 --> 00:01:11.845
And they come in two varieties,
modal and non-modal.

17
00:01:11.845 --> 00:01:15.561
If there is a fancier word for non-modal,
please let me know, cuz I don't know.

18
00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:21.646
But [LAUGH] so a modal dialog is
that kind that I just mentioned,

19
00:01:21.646 --> 00:01:29.855
where nothing else on the page works until
you have dismissed the dialogue, yeah?

20
00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:32.061
&gt;&gt; A nodal, if you will.

21
00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:33.044
&gt;&gt; A nodal?

22
00:01:33.044 --> 00:01:37.175
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Amodal, [LAUGH] I don't know,

23
00:01:37.175 --> 00:01:39.358
like it, exactly.

24
00:01:39.358 --> 00:01:43.311
A nodal, okay, [LAUGH] love it.

25
00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:49.297
So we are given in JavaScript
a nice interface for

26
00:01:49.297 --> 00:01:53.241
talking to dialogue elements.

27
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:58.851
So HTML dialogue element would be the type
of HTML element that we get back from,

28
00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:04.564
let's say, running this query selector
that's looking for the dialogue tag.

29
00:02:04.564 --> 00:02:08.741
And pretend, in our page,
we just have that one.

30
00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:12.389
And if we call.show,
what we get is a non-modal dialogue,

31
00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:16.965
which means you can still do all the other
stuff on the page that you wanna do,

32
00:02:16.965 --> 00:02:19.127
but this thing is sort of popped up.

33
00:02:19.127 --> 00:02:25.329
So maybe like a little, these days, it
seems to be all AI chat boxes or whatever.

34
00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:30.694
[LAUGH] But modals, again, where we say,
okay, right now you're in this land

35
00:02:30.694 --> 00:02:36.248
of this little dialogue where we need you
to make some decisions or do something.

36
00:02:36.248 --> 00:02:42.503
Or maybe you just really wanna read the
privacy policy or whatever it is, right?

37
00:02:42.503 --> 00:02:47.452
So we have two methods on dialog elements.

38
00:02:47.452 --> 00:02:51.778
There's a show for the amodal nodals,

39
00:02:51.778 --> 00:02:55.710
the non-modal [LAUGH] dialogs, and

40
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.487
a show modal for, shockingly,
the modal dialogs.

41
00:03:01.487 --> 00:03:07.028
All right, so, this is essentially
[LAUGH] what users experience

42
00:03:07.028 --> 00:03:13.183
when we've called showModal and
your user wants to click on something.

43
00:03:13.183 --> 00:03:17.872
The page is Marge Simpson saying,
but we've opened up a dialogue,

44
00:03:17.872 --> 00:03:20.434
you can't click on the other stuff.

45
00:03:20.434 --> 00:03:27.722
So this is just a note about different
ways to interact with dialogues.

46
00:03:27.722 --> 00:03:32.232
But in this case,
we're gonna be focusing on modals.

47
00:03:32.232 --> 00:03:36.254
And our mission,
should we choose to accept it,

48
00:03:36.254 --> 00:03:41.457
is to use our newfound classy
JavaScript to basically take that

49
00:03:41.457 --> 00:03:47.461
dark mode toggle that we built earlier and
turn it into a modal dialogue.

50
00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:51.293
So a settings panel, something like that,

51
00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:56.796
which then we can open as a modal and
change our dark mode there.

52
00:03:56.796 --> 00:04:00.903
And the nice thing about
dialog element is,

53
00:04:00.903 --> 00:04:07.785
if you have a form inside of your dialog,
then when the form is submitted,

54
00:04:07.785 --> 00:04:12.562
or you can also call.close
on the dialog element.

55
00:04:12.562 --> 00:04:18.691
But even automatically, even without
in your JavaScript calling .close,

56
00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:23.230
which is sort of the counterpart
to .show or showModal.

57
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.419
Once this form is submitted, so
once someone clicks the submit button,

58
00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.901
the browser will close the dialog for you.

59
00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:33.118
So thanks, browser, for all you do for us.

60
00:04:33.118 --> 00:04:39.481
All right, so
we're gonna start essentially

61
00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:45.676
with where we left off with our dark mode,
and

62
00:04:45.676 --> 00:04:52.213
we are going to turn it
into dark-modal [LAUGH].

63
00:04:52.213 --> 00:04:54.331
So this is where we left off.

64
00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:59.098
We have this amazing
feat of engineering where

65
00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:03.994
we now are able to look
at websites in dark mode.

66
00:05:03.994 --> 00:05:07.804
And is it just me, or
every app, when they're like,

67
00:05:07.804 --> 00:05:10.864
we have dark mode now, it gets so excited.

68
00:05:10.864 --> 00:05:15.732
Google Maps, just today,
was like, I have dark mode.

69
00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:22.929
So we should be excited too cuz from
the get-go, we've had dark mode.

70
00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:24.349
We've had it before it was cool.

71
00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:25.839
Well, not really, but [LAUGH].

72
00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:29.969
So, anyway, we're gonna start here, and

73
00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:34.335
you can start from your
own finished version.

74
00:05:34.335 --> 00:05:38.087
There's also, you can find this

75
00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:44.122
darkmodal/index.html file,
and download that.

76
00:05:44.122 --> 00:05:45.506
And if you look at this,

77
00:05:45.506 --> 00:05:49.819
well, if you run it, you'll notice
you get some errors in your console.

78
00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:54.418
Making sure you haven't disabled
the [LAUGH] error logging.

79
00:05:54.418 --> 00:05:57.095
And these are some errors
complaining about,

80
00:05:57.095 --> 00:06:01.769
the form constructor's not implemented,
the modal constructor's not implemented,

81
00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:04.022
and the render method is not implemented.

82
00:06:04.022 --> 00:06:12.060
So what's going on here is I've kind of
started us out with, that's not helpful.

83
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.503
So this is essentially the same as our

84
00:06:17.503 --> 00:06:23.304
finished dark mode, /index.html.

85
00:06:23.304 --> 00:06:28.000
We've got basically the same HTML and

86
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.527
the same theme.js script.

87
00:06:31.527 --> 00:06:34.775
I've called it theme.js for
reasons that will become clearer later.

88
00:06:34.775 --> 00:06:38.331
[LAUGH] And we've got that toggled,
all set up, and

89
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:42.397
all taken care of here,
same as before, that's not new.

90
00:06:42.397 --> 00:06:46.949
However, now I've sort of kicked
us off with a little helper, but

91
00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:52.335
feel free to re-implement this on your
own from your finished dark mode file.

92
00:06:52.335 --> 00:06:55.544
I'm setting us up with
a couple of classes.

93
00:06:55.544 --> 00:06:58.679
So we're gonna want a Form class.

94
00:06:58.679 --> 00:07:04.409
We've got a Form class that
essentially is going to construct for

95
00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:10.659
us the type of dialog form that we
would have within our dialog element,

96
00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:16.937
which then can be submitted to close
the dialog, and so on and so forth.

97
00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:21.939
And it can contain whatever
controls we want the user to have.

98
00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:25.053
So whatever inputs,
like our input checkbox.

99
00:07:25.053 --> 00:07:28.254
So this form class is essentially gonna

100
00:07:28.254 --> 00:07:32.137
create objects that
represent this HTML form.

101
00:07:32.137 --> 00:07:37.480
And do the interaction with the DOM
that we need to do, like creating

102
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:43.503
a form element, maybe giving it a heading,
creating a close button, etc.

103
00:07:43.503 --> 00:07:48.314
And the constructor should accept
a type for the form, a title,

104
00:07:48.314 --> 00:07:53.837
which is just gonna be in this heading,
and an element with the contents,

105
00:07:53.837 --> 00:07:57.334
whatever else should be
children of the form.

106
00:07:57.334 --> 00:08:02.391
Your job is to implement that
constructor to satisfy that API.

107
00:08:02.391 --> 00:08:07.073
And that class is gonna be
instantiated by another class

108
00:08:07.073 --> 00:08:11.266
that we need to work on,
which is the modal class.

109
00:08:11.266 --> 00:08:13.989
So let's read through this, and

110
00:08:13.989 --> 00:08:19.637
this is just to accelerate us a little
bit, get us going a little bit.

111
00:08:19.637 --> 00:08:24.957
We have a modal class
that's similar to the form

112
00:08:24.957 --> 00:08:29.483
class is going to do the DOM stuff for us.

113
00:08:29.483 --> 00:08:34.610
But this is gonna be responsible for
actually creating the dialogue and

114
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:38.379
for making sure that we show
it in the modal version.

115
00:08:38.379 --> 00:08:42.356
So started us off with a couple of
properties that we're gonna have,

116
00:08:42.356 --> 00:08:44.974
like we're gonna have
a new button element.

117
00:08:44.974 --> 00:08:47.733
We're gonna have a dialogue element.

118
00:08:47.733 --> 00:08:52.761
And the constructor is going to
accept a name for this modal,

119
00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:58.676
a parent element that's going to be
where it's kind of contained, and

120
00:08:58.676 --> 00:09:03.721
a content element that's gonna
be whatever is inside of it.

121
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:09.395
And so, in the constructor,
we have some work to do.

122
00:09:09.395 --> 00:09:14.132
But what I've already set up for
you is an internal private

123
00:09:14.132 --> 00:09:18.384
method that is using this Form class,
which again,

124
00:09:18.384 --> 00:09:23.701
needs to be implemented,
to essentially create the Form element

125
00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:29.427
with whatever contents you passed
in to the constructor of the modal.

126
00:09:29.427 --> 00:09:32.955
So this is all just in
the interest of jumpstarting, but

127
00:09:32.955 --> 00:09:36.859
I do recommend after we do this,
if you'd like to on your own,

128
00:09:36.859 --> 00:09:40.636
start from scratch,
start with dark mode/index.html.

129
00:09:40.636 --> 00:09:45.229
And try to elaborate your own interface,
when I say interface,

130
00:09:45.229 --> 00:09:50.161
your own sort of API for dealing with
these modal and form objects, or

131
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:52.647
create maybe different objects.

132
00:09:52.647 --> 00:09:57.172
It is essentially,
now we're in the world of just high-level,

133
00:09:57.172 --> 00:10:01.860
how do we want users to be able to
program with this nice developer API

134
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.338
that we're exposing
through our modal objects?

135
00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:09.248
And so do feel free to redo
this with your own ideas, but

136
00:10:09.248 --> 00:10:13.250
just to get us going and
to make the win a little quicker.

137
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.643
We're also going to have
a render method on the modal,

138
00:10:17.643 --> 00:10:22.419
which is going to actually
attach all these little elements

139
00:10:22.419 --> 00:10:27.385
that we've been creating that
are all nicely encapsulated in

140
00:10:27.385 --> 00:10:32.276
these objects to the DOM and
put them actually into the page.

141
00:10:32.276 --> 00:10:37.146
So the idea is that, pretend we've gotten

142
00:10:37.146 --> 00:10:42.015
this edict from on high
from our boss that we

143
00:10:42.015 --> 00:10:46.633
need the modal object to work like this.

144
00:10:46.633 --> 00:10:47.818
There's gonna be some parent.

145
00:10:47.818 --> 00:10:51.347
In this case, it's gonna be the nav of our
page, just from how it was set up before.

146
00:10:51.347 --> 00:10:52.568
There's gonna be some content.

147
00:10:52.568 --> 00:10:57.684
And in this case, we're grabbing
the dark-mode [LAUGH] label,

148
00:10:57.684 --> 00:11:00.156
which is gonna be our content.

149
00:11:00.156 --> 00:11:04.036
But you know what, rename things,
do whatever you need to do.

150
00:11:04.036 --> 00:11:06.773
But the idea is, whatever,
we have some content.

151
00:11:06.773 --> 00:11:10.110
In this case, it's gonna be
the toggle that we already set up.

152
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.553
And, you know what?

153
00:11:13.553 --> 00:11:14.780
Is this where?

154
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.620
No, okay.

155
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.400
What's going on?

156
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.369
Then, importantly, we want our users
to be able to call a new modal,

157
00:11:24.369 --> 00:11:28.483
pass in whatever name they want,
settings in this case,

158
00:11:28.483 --> 00:11:33.558
pass in whatever parent where they
want this dialogue to live within.

159
00:11:33.558 --> 00:11:38.401
And pass in whatever content they
want to be inside of the form, and

160
00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:42.739
be able to render that modal
with two lines of code, right?

161
00:11:42.739 --> 00:11:47.186
So we wanna do all of the work for
our users, other devs, perhaps, or

162
00:11:47.186 --> 00:11:49.027
ourselves in the future, or

163
00:11:49.027 --> 00:11:53.883
our teammate that works on a different
part of the project or what have you.

164
00:11:53.883 --> 00:11:57.719
We want to make their life a super easy,

165
00:11:57.719 --> 00:12:02.720
lovely situation by giving
them these nice form and

166
00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.605
modal objects that they can
use to not have to worry

167
00:12:07.605 --> 00:12:12.046
about all of this appending children, etc.

168
00:12:12.046 --> 00:12:18.747
Okay, so
this is the sort of starting point.

169
00:12:18.747 --> 00:12:25.255
Have at it, try to implement
these missing constructors and

170
00:12:25.255 --> 00:12:31.388
methods, and we will regroup and
see what we have found.
