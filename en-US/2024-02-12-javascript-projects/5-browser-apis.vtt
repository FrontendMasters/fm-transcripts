1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.876
So, now, these browser APIs over here,

2
00:00:03.876 --> 00:00:09.724
we said Fetch is one of them,
we're gonna talk about some others.

3
00:00:09.724 --> 00:00:13.844
But essentially,
the browser can do so much stuff, and

4
00:00:13.844 --> 00:00:18.315
the browser exposes so
much of that stuff to JavaScript, and

5
00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:23.153
has all these kind of like gadgets and
tricks and tips and things.

6
00:00:23.153 --> 00:00:26.280
And if,
does anybody remember Inspector Gadget,

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.908
was this like cartoon
from when I was a kid.

8
00:00:28.908 --> 00:00:31.874
I don't know if it's still around,
that has,

9
00:00:31.874 --> 00:00:35.807
it's like this detective with
all this random capabilities,

10
00:00:35.807 --> 00:00:40.270
just packed into a little hat, and
that is sort of like our web browser.

11
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.538
This is like a little logo on your screen,
but it can do so much stuff.

12
00:00:44.538 --> 00:00:49.234
So, these browser APIs
are pretty large [LAUGH] in

13
00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:54.168
terms of the surface area
of understanding stuff.

14
00:00:54.168 --> 00:00:56.924
And so, do you have any guesses for

15
00:00:56.924 --> 00:01:02.722
where I'm gonna recommend you go when
there's any thing a browser can or

16
00:01:02.722 --> 00:01:07.399
might be able to do that you
would like to learn more about?

17
00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.704
&gt;&gt; MDN.
&gt;&gt; MDN, woo, yes, MDN,

18
00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:16.601
developer.mozilla.org.

19
00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:21.546
So MDN is an amazing learning resource for

20
00:01:21.546 --> 00:01:26.772
any kind of web related situation and,

21
00:01:26.772 --> 00:01:31.590
look there's a dark mode toggle [LAUGH].

22
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.150
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So okay, so let's say I wanna,

23
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.847
how does Fetch work again?

24
00:01:36.847 --> 00:01:41.489
Okay, well, this is the fetch global
function, blah, blah, blah, okay.

25
00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:46.017
But this is actually related to
the bigger picture Fetch API,

26
00:01:46.017 --> 00:01:50.991
which relates not just to JavaScript,
but also the wider browser.

27
00:01:50.991 --> 00:01:55.819
So I can find all these details
about the Fetch API and look,

28
00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.665
a little breadcrumb to
a whole web API's section,

29
00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:03.978
cool, cool, cool, cool,
nothing much to learn here.

30
00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:06.789
And these are only the links
I've clicked recently.

31
00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.039
[LAUGH] As you can see,
there is a lot going on.

32
00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.100
So, again, we're not gonna, by any
means we're gonna scratch the surface.

33
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.954
We're not gonna by any means cover all of
the different browser APIs you should know

34
00:02:18.954 --> 00:02:20.630
as a JavaScript developer.

35
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.912
None of that cuz it's an ever-growing
set and MDN is your friend.

36
00:02:27.912 --> 00:02:29.241
Say it with me.

37
00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:30.862
&gt;&gt; MDN is your friend.

38
00:02:30.862 --> 00:02:37.334
&gt;&gt; Yes, and we're gonna be returning
to that over and over again.

39
00:02:37.334 --> 00:02:42.348
Okay, so, when in doubt, checkout MDN for

40
00:02:42.348 --> 00:02:46.559
fun JavaScript facts out the wazoo.

41
00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:47.951
So, browser API's,

42
00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:52.288
let's talk about a couple of things
that we can access in JavaScript.

43
00:02:52.288 --> 00:02:58.202
So one thing is we get a fun little window
object, wouldn't really call it an API so

44
00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:03.365
much is like an interface to all
kinds of stuff that's happening here.

45
00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:09.578
So there is a global variable window
which poke around in the console,

46
00:03:09.578 --> 00:03:15.811
gives you essentially the window
where you currently find yourself.

47
00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:19.842
And by you,
I mean this little JavaScript script.

48
00:03:19.842 --> 00:03:24.756
[LAUGH] So we can look, for
example, at like, okay,

49
00:03:24.756 --> 00:03:31.477
what is the location of the current
tab in our modern sense that I'm in?

50
00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:36.015
Each tab is its own window,
because names are hard.

51
00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:40.097
And the location might be, for

52
00:03:40.097 --> 00:03:45.437
example, to the window API docs on MDN.

53
00:03:45.437 --> 00:03:46.701
Guess what?

54
00:03:46.701 --> 00:03:50.700
The window is kind of also where
we have all of these other

55
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.395
handy things that JavaScript
exposes to us as global variables.

56
00:03:55.395 --> 00:04:01.159
So like for example, we're used to
typing document.getelement blah, blah,

57
00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:06.515
that's actually the value of the document
property on the window object.

58
00:04:06.515 --> 00:04:11.092
It's just a handy convenience
that the browser exposes

59
00:04:11.092 --> 00:04:15.873
that to us in JavaScript as
the global variable document.

60
00:04:15.873 --> 00:04:20.597
And likewise, the console.logs that
we all know and love are also,

61
00:04:20.597 --> 00:04:26.227
all of this stuff is in the window, so the
window kind of is like, has everything.

62
00:04:26.227 --> 00:04:31.105
So there's all kinds of fun things you
can poke around in there if you wanna see

63
00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:32.543
what else is going on.

64
00:04:32.543 --> 00:04:35.561
There's also a property
called the navigator.

65
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:40.725
And this is, I guess,
a throwback to like Netscape days but

66
00:04:40.725 --> 00:04:44.758
the navigator basically
means the browser and

67
00:04:44.758 --> 00:04:49.303
it's sort of like what's
going on with this piece of

68
00:04:49.303 --> 00:04:53.772
software that the user is
using to read my webpage.

69
00:04:53.772 --> 00:04:56.321
So there's all kinds of
interesting stuff in there.

70
00:04:56.321 --> 00:05:00.380
Again, poke around in your console,
see what you can find.

71
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.434
But for example on my MacBook,
it knows what kind of CPU I'm writing,

72
00:05:06.434 --> 00:05:11.255
it also has this, there's a handy and
often use dot user

73
00:05:11.255 --> 00:05:16.179
agent property that tells you,
I'm in Mozilla, so

74
00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:21.722
Firefox browser which is running Gecko,
which is Mozilla's or

75
00:05:21.722 --> 00:05:26.478
Firefox's browser engine,
analogous to Chromium.

76
00:05:26.478 --> 00:05:31.472
If you're in Chrome,
you probably see Chromium there, yeah?

77
00:05:31.472 --> 00:05:34.664
Anybody else got any other
fun user agent values?

78
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.866
And yeah, and again, it knows even what
kind of architecture I'm running on.

79
00:05:41.866 --> 00:05:44.157
So, all kinds of fun stuff in there.
