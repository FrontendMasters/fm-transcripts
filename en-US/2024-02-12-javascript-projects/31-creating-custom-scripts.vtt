00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.960
If I were to, in my package.json, and
that is not, it's not square bracket.

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.100
Wait, yes, it is square brackets.

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.869
Okay, if I were in my
package.json to add a,

4
00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:17.151
all right,
let's be reasonable Anjana, okay?

5
00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:19.834
[LAUGH] All right.

6
00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:24.481
So if I were to add a, [LAUGH] so
now we're in VS Code and

7
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:26.924
I'm just gonna open here.

8
00:00:26.924 --> 00:00:29.392
Can folks see all right?

9
00:00:29.392 --> 00:00:33.616
So I have opened, so what I just did with
the code dot is open Code in this working

10
00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:37.281
directory, which has such an amazing
amount of information here.

11
00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:41.269
We have a package.json and
we have a whereAmI.js.

12
00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.348
If I were to write my own script,

13
00:00:43.348 --> 00:00:46.900
I can do basically whatever
I want at the command line.

14
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.119
So I could echo stuff.

15
00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:54.704
I could, I don't know, change
directories on people [LAUGH] I can do,

16
00:00:54.704 --> 00:00:58.412
keep in mind,
it'll be a different process.

17
00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:03.945
So I can do things like run a Node script,
say.

18
00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:11.674
So if I copy my super handy
dandy find-me script here.

19
00:01:11.674 --> 00:01:13.439
Now, yeah, no, it's not an array,
it's an object.

20
00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.516
Okay, so this is going to be a new
key value pair in this little

21
00:01:18.516 --> 00:01:23.814
scripts object that has all
of my script definitions.

22
00:01:23.814 --> 00:01:26.724
I literally just type it into
the package.json and I save.

23
00:01:28.264 --> 00:01:31.414
And now let me open the terminal here.

24
00:01:31.414 --> 00:01:32.934
Weird shortcut for that.

25
00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:36.288
Okay, so now, now that I have
this new script, I can run.

26
00:01:36.288 --> 00:01:38.465
I still can run test, same as before.

27
00:01:40.226 --> 00:01:46.487
And I also can run npm run find-me.

28
00:01:46.487 --> 00:01:51.391
And it tells me what it's doing,
it's running this whereAmI.js,

29
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:54.528
and it is doing what
the script told it to do.

30
00:01:54.528 --> 00:02:01.184
So this is basically the thing we end up
doing a lot a JavaScript developers is

31
00:02:01.184 --> 00:02:06.384
writing those little words npm
run a bajillion times a day,

32
00:02:06.384 --> 00:02:10.546
and messing with our
package.json as needed.

33
00:02:10.546 --> 00:02:13.452
Now, sometimes we mess with
it manually like I just did.

34
00:02:13.452 --> 00:02:20.835
But there's also, like we saw, the npm
init created that package.json for us.

35
00:02:20.835 --> 00:02:25.254
There's also other tools and other kind
of ways of getting started here that

36
00:02:25.254 --> 00:02:29.855
are gonna fill out a whole bunch of
useful information in your package.json.

37
00:02:29.855 --> 00:02:32.926
We've done it the hard way here so

38
00:02:32.926 --> 00:02:38.301
that we can make sure we've
got the fundamentals of like,

39
00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:43.140
what are the important
bits of this package.json?

40
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.569
How do we run things from
within our NPM package?

41
00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.621
How do we define new scripts for new,

42
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:53.264
hopefully more useful [LAUGH]
things we want to do, etc.
