00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.641
I would love to know, even if folks don't
feel comfortable sharing their code,

2
00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:06.350
although this is a safe space.

3
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.943
We are all messing up a lot here.

4
00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:14.048
So I've broken builds.

5
00:00:14.048 --> 00:00:21.055
I've gotten the names of very basic
[LAUGH] JavaScript things wrong.

6
00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:26.805
I've misled you a couple of times
about command, so I feel you.

7
00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:29.755
None of this has to be perfect in
any stretch of the imagination.

8
00:00:29.755 --> 00:00:37.525
So please don't feel shy, and please share
with us what you've got in the chat.

9
00:00:37.525 --> 00:00:41.187
And so we do have one that
I'm very excited to look at.

10
00:00:41.187 --> 00:00:46.700
Can you maybe tell us a little bit about
what you did for your hackathon project?

11
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.629
&gt;&gt; Yes, so I ended up doing two things.

12
00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.883
One thing I tried it on
mobile didn't work but

13
00:00:52.883 --> 00:00:56.406
I think that's a Riley
set an iPhone to network.

14
00:00:56.406 --> 00:01:02.693
But I added the there's like a shared API
up It pulls up the share sheet in your OS.

15
00:01:02.693 --> 00:01:04.347
I think it's mainly for iOS and

16
00:01:04.347 --> 00:01:08.083
Android because they have like share
sheets that you can share too.

17
00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:11.649
So, but yeah, so if you click on
the share image after you make it,

18
00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:14.604
it'll pull up the share,
it pulls up the share sheet.

19
00:01:14.604 --> 00:01:16.431
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we've got a new button,

20
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:21.203
which hopefully was relatively easy to put
in there and do a different modal thing.

21
00:01:21.203 --> 00:01:25.293
Then we have the Share button and
now I can like airdrop it

22
00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:29.743
to someone unsuspecting or
send a text message or whatever.

23
00:01:29.743 --> 00:01:30.913
This is very cool.

24
00:01:30.913 --> 00:01:33.363
Super cool, so
I'm in Safari right now on a Mac.

25
00:01:33.363 --> 00:01:36.145
So it does have access.

26
00:01:36.145 --> 00:01:39.832
And can you maybe point us to Where did
you find out about how that API works and

27
00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:41.102
what you need to call.

28
00:01:41.102 --> 00:01:42.912
&gt;&gt; Yes, let me see.

29
00:01:42.912 --> 00:01:44.632
I found it on MDN.

30
00:01:44.632 --> 00:01:45.833
&gt;&gt; Yay!

31
00:01:45.833 --> 00:01:47.259
It's our friend.

32
00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.262
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's see.

33
00:01:49.262 --> 00:01:51.082
Let me look it up again.

34
00:01:51.082 --> 00:01:52.102
&gt;&gt; And by the way.

35
00:01:52.102 --> 00:01:54.481
&gt;&gt; But yeah, just if you search for
share on MDN.

36
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:55.691
&gt;&gt; Sure.

37
00:01:55.691 --> 00:02:00.825
So a lot of browsers have a way
to set up search keywords.

38
00:02:00.825 --> 00:02:05.210
So I have a little MDN search keyword,
that when I type MDN,

39
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.157
whatever, it doesn't even
go to the search engine,

40
00:02:09.157 --> 00:02:13.135
it goes directly to
the search page of MDN.

41
00:02:13.135 --> 00:02:16.495
So this is a very handy
little feature here.

42
00:02:16.495 --> 00:02:19.678
So share API is what we're searching for?

43
00:02:19.678 --> 00:02:23.919
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you You just search share,
it's navigator.share.

44
00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:24.925
&gt;&gt; Okay.

45
00:02:24.925 --> 00:02:27.649
Let's try navigator it just popped up.

46
00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:29.119
There we go.
There we go.

47
00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:30.841
navigator.share.

48
00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:34.234
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Okay this feature is only available in

49
00:02:34.234 --> 00:02:39.239
some are all supporting browsers
on secure HTTPS.Websites.

50
00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.626
So, that's also something that
you can do in GitHub Pages,

51
00:02:43.626 --> 00:02:49.302
as I believe you can decide whether you
want to enforce that it is always HTTPS,

52
00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:51.899
which why not but this is very cool.

53
00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:56.394
Okay, the web shareAPI and again,
we have like so many of these API's.

54
00:02:56.394 --> 00:02:57.714
It's amazing.

55
00:02:57.714 --> 00:02:59.764
This is awesome.

56
00:02:59.764 --> 00:03:02.616
So I haven't worked But this very much but

57
00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:07.425
this is a fabulous interview like
these are all things that we can share

58
00:03:07.425 --> 00:03:11.031
with people using f they
have a supporting browser.

59
00:03:11.031 --> 00:03:15.682
And we can check the compatibility
table down here to see that okay,

60
00:03:15.682 --> 00:03:20.431
like Firefox for Android might work,
but not all of the parameters.

61
00:03:20.431 --> 00:03:24.247
But sadly my desktop Firefox won't be so
friendly with it.

62
00:03:24.247 --> 00:03:29.817
But a bunch of these other browsers,
Chrome, Safari, Opera, etc.

63
00:03:29.817 --> 00:03:30.402
All about it.

64
00:03:30.402 --> 00:03:33.706
So again, yeah, just a note to be
aware of the browser support for

65
00:03:33.706 --> 00:03:38.037
the thing you're using, and it's always
a good idea to have like fallbacks.

66
00:03:38.037 --> 00:03:41.757
So whether it's a try catch or
iffy, wrapped,

67
00:03:41.757 --> 00:03:46.320
async operation or whatever it is,
you should be all set.

68
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.402
All right, great.

69
00:03:47.402 --> 00:03:53.838
So like getting, okay, so this is
the other thing is we need to actually get

70
00:03:53.838 --> 00:04:00.700
the file in a useful chunk of information
that the browser knows what to do with.

71
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.582
A blob or
a file object based on that blob of data,

72
00:04:04.582 --> 00:04:09.532
all of these things base 64 URLs,
all of this stuff.

73
00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:14.392
As we go, we're probably having to learn
a little bit about under the hood.

74
00:04:14.392 --> 00:04:19.933
I see a meme, but
what does the underlying engine see?

75
00:04:19.933 --> 00:04:21.657
What kind of data is this?

76
00:04:21.657 --> 00:04:23.729
So some very good lessons to be had here.

77
00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:24.693
So yeah.

78
00:04:24.693 --> 00:04:29.620
&gt;&gt; That like two data URL
method on the Canvas API.

79
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.117
&gt;&gt; Okay, can you please?

80
00:04:32.117 --> 00:04:32.793
All right.

81
00:04:32.793 --> 00:04:35.274
&gt;&gt; That turns it into a base 64 string.

82
00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:40.772
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so this is a great way to
be then able to, and look, we've got.

83
00:04:40.772 --> 00:04:43.102
We've got some nested awaits here.

84
00:04:43.102 --> 00:04:43.902
This is awesome.

85
00:04:43.902 --> 00:04:45.886
And so this is where we can learn so
many cool tips and

86
00:04:45.886 --> 00:04:48.062
tricks from looking at each other's code.

87
00:04:48.062 --> 00:04:54.702
It's always a good idea to peruse other
people's way of approaching things.

88
00:04:54.702 --> 00:04:57.034
And this is some fabulous stuff
that we're learning here.

89
00:04:57.034 --> 00:05:03.422
We're converting the meme to a data URL,
which were then-.

90
00:05:03.422 --> 00:05:11.556
&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually I don't even know if
that I getting a batch need to be there.

91
00:05:11.556 --> 00:05:12.288
I don't even.

92
00:05:12.288 --> 00:05:13.762
&gt;&gt; Well, we can try it out and

93
00:05:13.762 --> 00:05:17.883
we can all you know fork each
other's repos back and forth.

94
00:05:17.883 --> 00:05:21.856
I don't know how complex of a fork tree
we're allowed to have on github, but

95
00:05:21.856 --> 00:05:23.958
in any case, this is awesome.

96
00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:27.348
Fabulous, thank you so much for
sharing excellent work fabulous.

97
00:05:27.348 --> 00:05:31.872
We've got a meme version in
the chat that uses an ML model

98
00:05:31.872 --> 00:05:35.928
to add a box around your
face after you click Save.

99
00:05:36.938 --> 00:05:37.765
Let's check it out.

100
00:05:37.765 --> 00:05:41.784
Okay and let's see if it works in Firefox.

101
00:05:41.784 --> 00:05:47.189
Great!
And somebody thought to put the links.

102
00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:53.817
Roshan Raja has put the amazingly clever,
and I wish I had thought of it,

103
00:05:53.817 --> 00:05:58.176
link to the project of
the GitHub repo in there.

104
00:05:58.176 --> 00:06:00.926
So, good call and let's do it.

105
00:06:00.926 --> 00:06:02.306
So we're gonna take a selfie.

106
00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:07.976
Save okay.

107
00:06:07.976 --> 00:06:11.716
And wow look, it knows where my face is.

108
00:06:11.716 --> 00:06:14.230
I am very impressed and
a little bit afraid.

109
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.476
[LAUGH] But this is awesome.

110
00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:23.723
So we'd love to hear a little bit
about what you used to build this,

111
00:06:23.723 --> 00:06:29.656
let's go through to the code,
thanks to this very handy link.

112
00:06:29.656 --> 00:06:33.278
Okay, let's take a look, maybe.

113
00:06:33.278 --> 00:06:34.984
&gt;&gt; Just look at the commit history, maybe.

114
00:06:34.984 --> 00:06:38.460
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, okay,
we've got a face API, sorry?

115
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.644
&gt;&gt; Nevermind.

116
00:06:39.644 --> 00:06:45.717
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm thinking we're
gonna wanna look at his face API,

117
00:06:45.717 --> 00:06:52.366
and there's some models and
things going on in our source, perhaps.

118
00:06:52.366 --> 00:06:53.336
Aha, face recognition.

119
00:06:55.356 --> 00:06:58.167
Wow, okay, so this face api.js,

120
00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:03.042
which I'm guessing we now see
as a dependency of the project,

121
00:07:03.042 --> 00:07:09.787
is giving us all of these methods for like
loading all of these different models.

122
00:07:09.787 --> 00:07:14.203
We're wrapping them all in a promise all,
which is a good way to basically,

123
00:07:14.203 --> 00:07:18.564
instead of having to like await this,
await that, await the other thing.

124
00:07:18.564 --> 00:07:21.680
We can write one await on a promise.all,
which will,

125
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.388
that promise, Returned by promise that
all will resolve when all of those other

126
00:07:26.388 --> 00:07:30.219
promises as the net as the method
would indicate have resolved.

127
00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:35.219
And then we've got kind of a mix of like
the then Ning and the catching cool.

128
00:07:35.219 --> 00:07:35.949
This is awesome.

129
00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:38.865
And there's some models
then in the models,

130
00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:46.042
Directory which I might not have up here,
but that's all good.

131
00:07:46.042 --> 00:07:49.750
Maybe it's in assets?

132
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.276
That's modals.

133
00:07:51.276 --> 00:07:52.041
That's fine, okay.

134
00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:55.600
[LAUGH] Anyway, so
I personally do not know this API and

135
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.062
how to maybe it's in Public?

136
00:07:58.062 --> 00:08:00.439
There we go.
Public models that makes sense.

137
00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:04.042
So these are gonna be hosted,
did with the site.

138
00:08:04.042 --> 00:08:07.252
So I'm curious to look at these.

139
00:08:07.252 --> 00:08:12.515
We've got some thing that is
essentially Jason file again,

140
00:08:12.515 --> 00:08:17.366
like it seems like the whole
JavaScript ecosystem comes

141
00:08:17.366 --> 00:08:22.066
down to Jason files,
that is somehow representing.

142
00:08:22.066 --> 00:08:28.876
To the machine learning magic
underneath what a face looks like.

143
00:08:28.876 --> 00:08:30.487
So that's really cool.

144
00:08:30.487 --> 00:08:34.313
Awesome, and this face, Jay,

145
00:08:34.313 --> 00:08:38.436
let's look at the package Jason.

146
00:08:40.886 --> 00:08:42.059
And yes., exactly.

147
00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:47.025
So we have this face API JS is
a package that we now can be inspired

148
00:08:47.025 --> 00:08:49.199
to go play with ourselves.

149
00:08:49.199 --> 00:08:50.859
So thank you so much for sharing.

150
00:08:50.859 --> 00:08:53.995
That's awesome, great work.

151
00:08:53.995 --> 00:08:58.080
Perhaps you could even do something
if I had given you more than an hour.

152
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.003
You could do something like
use this to then I don't know

153
00:09:03.003 --> 00:09:06.775
put sunglasses on people or something, so

154
00:09:06.775 --> 00:09:12.042
I the possibilities are limitless
very cool awesome work.
