WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:05.552
Okay, so now we get to have hopefully,
the satisfying experience

2
00:00:05.552 --> 00:00:10.799
of seeing all of these little robot
lions that are the tiny quick

3
00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:16.651
win projects that we've been working on,
the sort of mini projects.

4
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:21.364
Come together into one massive
object Voltron, warrior robot,

5
00:00:21.364 --> 00:00:25.143
if anybody remembers this
show from like the 80s.

6
00:00:25.143 --> 00:00:30.044
Anyways, the idea is that all of
these little kind of arbitrary

7
00:00:30.044 --> 00:00:34.946
exercises that we've been doing
are actually like things that

8
00:00:34.946 --> 00:00:39.752
we can build upon and we can build
them all in to An app that takes

9
00:00:39.752 --> 00:00:44.582
advantage of all of those different
things that we have done.

10
00:00:46.572 --> 00:00:51.843
So if we take our various quick wins,
and our now live selfie cam and

11
00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:56.456
the code that we needed to run
to talk to the user devices and

12
00:00:56.456 --> 00:01:00.435
everything, and
a little bit of extra niceties.

13
00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.767
A little bit of extra UI stuff,

14
00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:08.153
but nothing no really new
concepts that we haven't covered.

15
00:01:08.153 --> 00:01:12.413
Then we get MEME ME, and I can has meme is

16
00:01:12.413 --> 00:01:17.463
something that you too
can put over your face.

17
00:01:17.463 --> 00:01:22.332
All right, so there's a couple
different links here, [LAUGH] So

18
00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:25.412
sorry, they're not very easy to read.

19
00:01:25.412 --> 00:01:32.686
But if you go to anjana.dev/meme-me, you
will see my version of this little site,

20
00:01:32.686 --> 00:01:38.468
again, this is all,
we recognize this from our selfie cam.

21
00:01:38.468 --> 00:01:44.041
If I press Allow, then all right,
now I have some buttons and

22
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:51.378
when I click on the take selfie, I get
a modal, and it has a little preview here.

23
00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:54.428
This is one of the little extra bits
of code which we'll talk about.

24
00:01:54.428 --> 00:01:58.578
Somebody had a question
earlier about how do we draw?

25
00:01:58.578 --> 00:02:05.114
Do we need to draw a new photo for
every frame of the video stream.

26
00:02:05.114 --> 00:02:09.418
We don't need to, but it is useful if you
wanna have a live preview of what your

27
00:02:09.418 --> 00:02:13.525
selfie might look like so that you can
make sure you've got an amazing, or

28
00:02:13.525 --> 00:02:15.264
maybe I wanna do the this meme.

29
00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:23.969
And when I click that take photo, it's
going to now write it to this Canvas here.

30
00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:25.872
Now we're going to look at
the code base in a second, but for

31
00:02:25.872 --> 00:02:27.519
now we're just having fun.

32
00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.359
Then I can click this add text
button which, guess what?

33
00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.589
Another modal, did I have to rewrite
the same code over and over again?

34
00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:40.533
No, because you all already implemented
basically a modal component for me, so

35
00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:44.045
we can reuse that for
all these different buttons.

36
00:02:44.045 --> 00:02:47.650
And I can add some text, like,

37
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.675
breaks the build and then takes a break.

38
00:02:52.675 --> 00:02:55.825
[LAUGH] I've already tried this out.

39
00:02:55.825 --> 00:02:59.324
[LAUGH] Because now it's not my problem.

40
00:02:59.324 --> 00:03:01.569
If the build is broken and I take a break,

41
00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.814
then that's somebody else's problem,
right?

42
00:03:04.814 --> 00:03:10.104
But maybe I'm like, that's not really the
appropriate meme format of the image now.

43
00:03:10.104 --> 00:03:11.404
I want a different selfie.

44
00:03:11.404 --> 00:03:15.711
I can actually go in and
be like, I don't know,

45
00:03:15.711 --> 00:03:21.228
position myself like,
[LAUGH] Make an extra ridiculous one.

46
00:03:21.228 --> 00:03:22.568
And guess what?

47
00:03:23.608 --> 00:03:28.596
We also have a little settings button
where we can change the theme and

48
00:03:28.596 --> 00:03:30.318
it even stays changed.

49
00:03:31.358 --> 00:03:34.264
And so this is essentially,
so we saw earlier,

50
00:03:34.264 --> 00:03:39.132
we didn't really draw this meme me typed
text, but we drew that J S text we saw how

51
00:03:39.132 --> 00:03:42.272
that work we know how to
draw an image to the camera.

52
00:03:42.272 --> 00:03:48.968
We're going to talk about that live
preview in a second, but otherwise,

53
00:03:48.968 --> 00:03:55.556
all of this stuff with one little extra
thing to make sure that the text and

54
00:03:55.556 --> 00:04:00.745
the, [LAUGH] The image don't
kind of clobber each other.

55
00:04:00.745 --> 00:04:04.947
For example,
if I want to change the build or

56
00:04:04.947 --> 00:04:09.376
change the text, sorry, okay I don't know,

57
00:04:09.376 --> 00:04:13.820
do as, [LAUGH] I say,
not as I do, for example.

58
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:20.913
We're clearing out the Canvas first so
that we can then have a clean,

59
00:04:20.913 --> 00:04:26.799
and we're not just overwriting
lots of different text.

60
00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:29.041
So we'll look at the code in a second, but

61
00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:32.130
essentially this is all stuff
that we've already seen.

62
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.617
With one very small exception,
which is this live preview.

63
00:04:35.617 --> 00:04:36.489
And we'll talk about that.

64
00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:43.123
So if it ever felt during this marathon
of wins that I've been calling quick,

65
00:04:43.123 --> 00:04:45.613
but actually might not be so quick.

66
00:04:45.613 --> 00:04:50.403
We were just doing useless stuff that
could never be actually relevant for

67
00:04:50.403 --> 00:04:53.972
a moderate, more than one button site,
for example.

68
00:04:53.972 --> 00:04:56.589
No, do you have to build sites this way?

69
00:04:56.589 --> 00:05:00.506
No, can you have a totally different modal
class or maybe not a modal class at all?

70
00:05:00.506 --> 00:05:05.320
For sure, but all of those things
that we've done we can pull them all

71
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.902
together into an actual little app.

72
00:05:07.902 --> 00:05:12.645
And what we can do is actually save these
memes if you right-click on a Canvas just

73
00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:17.109
in general any canvas out there it'll
give you the option to save the image,

74
00:05:17.109 --> 00:05:20.559
same as if if you were clicking
on an image or what have you.

75
00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:25.171
So I can save these memes,
I can send them to all my friends,

76
00:05:25.171 --> 00:05:30.726
I can put them in my slides for
you to laugh at me, whatever, all right?

77
00:05:30.726 --> 00:05:32.266
So this is meme me.

78
00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:36.806
This is the project that we have all
been secretly building the whole time,

79
00:05:36.806 --> 00:05:37.754
essentially.

80
00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:40.838
All right,
shall we go look at the code base?

81
00:05:40.838 --> 00:05:41.356
&gt;&gt; Yep.

82
00:05:41.356 --> 00:05:45.210
&gt;&gt; Cool., [LAUGH] Okay.

83
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.888
So, this is at the corresponding,
I need like a new line in here.

84
00:05:48.888 --> 00:05:55.943
The corresponding repo is my same account,
slash meme me.

85
00:05:55.943 --> 00:06:00.345
I'm gonna want those slides later, so I'm
just gonna open this in a new tab, okay.

86
00:06:00.345 --> 00:06:03.104
All right, [COUGH] And
Firefox is helpfully

87
00:06:03.104 --> 00:06:08.022
telling me here that there's still
a tab here that's asking for my camera.

88
00:06:08.022 --> 00:06:10.930
Your browser may or may not be doing that,
but that's just what that's about.

89
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.892
Okay, so hopefully we see a lot
of stuff we recognize here,

90
00:06:16.892 --> 00:06:19.677
other than the very
unhelpful commit message.

91
00:06:19.677 --> 00:06:23.928
Again, do as I say not as I do write
more helpful commit messages than

92
00:06:23.928 --> 00:06:24.907
the word in it.

93
00:06:24.907 --> 00:06:29.595
But this is all I just committed this all
at once to show you sort of everything so

94
00:06:29.595 --> 00:06:31.133
we can take a look.

95
00:06:31.133 --> 00:06:33.755
I remembered to do a readme fab.

96
00:06:33.755 --> 00:06:37.997
[LAUGH] And and what we have is
again stuff that we recognize.

97
00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:45.772
We have things like an index.html that has
a little bit more going on than before,

98
00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:52.775
but essentially nothing like out of
the realm of what we've been seeing.

99
00:06:52.775 --> 00:06:57.439
So I have a canvas here,
put a little extra accessibility and

100
00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:02.659
all things in case it doesn't load there,
put a height.

101
00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:07.561
I have a few nested divs as one does for
actually containing things,

102
00:07:07.561 --> 00:07:11.199
which divs are allowed to do, I believe.

103
00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:14.885
The accessibility folks can
talk to me about it later.

104
00:07:14.885 --> 00:07:19.404
And then what I have is essentially
these little steps, I call them, but

105
00:07:19.404 --> 00:07:24.294
you could call them whatever you want,
where that corresponds to each of those

106
00:07:24.294 --> 00:07:27.797
different buttons,
which are gonna become my modals.

107
00:07:27.797 --> 00:07:31.997
So inside of each of those divs,
I have the content.

108
00:07:31.997 --> 00:07:36.117
Remember we had that when we pass into our
modal constructor, we pass in the parent,

109
00:07:36.117 --> 00:07:38.102
which is gonna be our little container.

110
00:07:38.102 --> 00:07:42.923
And then the content element,
which is gonna be a little button that

111
00:07:42.923 --> 00:07:48.094
I've just given a class modal content
to make our lives a little easier.

112
00:07:48.094 --> 00:07:51.684
And then inside of that,
we have whatever we need,

113
00:07:51.684 --> 00:07:55.365
an extra canvas for
the preview, a button ideally.

114
00:07:55.365 --> 00:07:58.335
And then for the different models,
whatever content they need.

115
00:07:58.335 --> 00:08:02.205
We have a couple of tech text inputs one
for the top and one for the bottom text.

116
00:08:03.365 --> 00:08:05.976
We have our we know this one we know and

117
00:08:05.976 --> 00:08:10.194
love our hopefully ID dark mode label and
its corresponding

118
00:08:10.194 --> 00:08:15.455
inputs that is a checkbox we
already know how all that works.

119
00:08:15.455 --> 00:08:17.845
And then I just have
some links in the footer.

120
00:08:17.845 --> 00:08:21.749
So this is all again kind of stuff we've
seen the only differences I've made

121
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:25.436
a couple extra modals with
slightly different inputs.

122
00:08:25.436 --> 00:08:28.483
And in this case a canvas which
we'll talk about writing to.

123
00:08:28.483 --> 00:08:31.276
Okay, so
that's what's happening in our index.html.

124
00:08:32.976 --> 00:08:33.916
All good so far.

125
00:08:35.246 --> 00:08:39.233
And we're we're loading some CSS which
this is just to make things you look okay.

126
00:08:39.233 --> 00:08:41.271
And again, not a CSS course and

127
00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:45.911
do not take my CSS as how you should
write it cuz I'm not very good at it.

128
00:08:45.911 --> 00:08:49.944
But in any case, we can go take the CSS
courses on Frontend Masters to make sure

129
00:08:49.944 --> 00:08:51.566
we're doing that part right.

130
00:08:51.566 --> 00:08:55.652
But we can just use these style sheets for
now.

131
00:08:55.652 --> 00:09:00.026
And some of these styles are, for
example, using the impact font,

132
00:09:00.026 --> 00:09:05.419
there's a class that then it's applying
that classic meme text font that impact.

133
00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:07.384
Okay, so
that's what's happening in our HTML.

134
00:09:07.384 --> 00:09:10.775
All right, so
if we go back into our root and

135
00:09:10.775 --> 00:09:15.025
pay no attention to meme.html,
that's nonsense.

136
00:09:15.025 --> 00:09:18.780
[LAUGH] I'm actually going to
delete that in a second, but

137
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.744
anyway, we have a main.js.

138
00:09:20.744 --> 00:09:25.422
And if we go into our package Jason sorry,
we can see that that is

139
00:09:25.422 --> 00:09:30.101
hopefully in line with what we
expect our package to look like,

140
00:09:30.101 --> 00:09:35.338
nothing really new here that we
haven't talked about already today.

141
00:09:35.338 --> 00:09:36.896
Yep, okay?

142
00:09:36.896 --> 00:09:39.942
So now if we go into our main JS,

143
00:09:39.942 --> 00:09:45.345
which again was referenced
in our HTML same as before.

144
00:09:45.345 --> 00:09:47.655
Now we can see what's
actually happening here.

145
00:09:47.655 --> 00:09:51.629
Let's zoom in a bit.

146
00:09:51.629 --> 00:09:57.160
Okay, so we're importing some things from

147
00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:03.890
some modules including our modal class for
example.

148
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:08.189
Which itself is using that form class,
but we're not actually using that in

149
00:10:08.189 --> 00:10:12.911
the index.html, so we're just letting
the modal take care of the form creation.

150
00:10:12.911 --> 00:10:18.492
And that is all basically copy-pasted
from what we did in our quick win, okay?

151
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.799
Then we have similarly to our earlier,

152
00:10:27.256 --> 00:10:33.299
Dark mode quick win, we have something
that's just a tiny bit different.

153
00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:35.044
Let's go look at it.

154
00:10:35.044 --> 00:10:40.161
So in our search there,
in our theme we're doing all

155
00:10:40.161 --> 00:10:45.992
of the stuff that we do to set
up our toggle, same as before.

156
00:10:45.992 --> 00:10:51.705
We're just wrapping it in a function
that then returns that element for

157
00:10:51.705 --> 00:10:55.227
the convenience of being
able to decide when

158
00:10:55.227 --> 00:10:58.480
that gets set up in our main.js, okay?

159
00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.620
But it's all the same code you already

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.878

00:11:13.878 --> 00:11:18.376
