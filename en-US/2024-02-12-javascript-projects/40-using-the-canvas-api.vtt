1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.588
So why don't we mess
around in our app here.

2
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.694
I'm going to go to my index.html,

3
00:00:11.694 --> 00:00:15.850
and I'm not even gonna worry
about this app element.

4
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.520
I'm just gonna put a canvas here.

5
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.267
I'm not even gonna say anything
else special about it.

6
00:00:23.267 --> 00:00:28.587
And this is also note that I can
load other scripts than main here.

7
00:00:28.587 --> 00:00:32.381
Typically the idea is,
I would just have one entry point,

8
00:00:32.381 --> 00:00:37.037
same as our package, like main.js
would do everything I want it to do.

9
00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:41.843
But let's say I want to have
another module that's interacting

10
00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:45.226
with a different part of the page or
the site.

11
00:00:45.226 --> 00:00:48.497
So I could make a module called canvas.js.

12
00:00:48.497 --> 00:00:50.278
Does that exist yet?

13
00:00:50.278 --> 00:00:51.199
No, it does not.

14
00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.491
Let's change that.

15
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:55.174
So we can make a new file.

16
00:00:55.174 --> 00:00:56.340
We can call it canvas.js.

17
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.208
And this is where we can put our
canvas manipulation code, for example.

18
00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:09.122
Now, as you notice, there's a few
different things happening here.

19
00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:14.322
Most things are in the root
directory of this project.

20
00:01:14.322 --> 00:01:17.053
Well, we have our node modules,
we know about that.

21
00:01:17.053 --> 00:01:19.490
There's also a public folder.

22
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.119
These are gonna be assets that are served
up just with the site, statically,

23
00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.896
no processing, just you can now
go find the favicon or whatever.

24
00:01:29.896 --> 00:01:34.441
Anyway, another common thing that you
see a lot of codebases do is have

25
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:36.377
a little bit more structure.

26
00:01:36.377 --> 00:01:39.108
Cuz once we start adding more and
more modules, this is gonna get

27
00:01:39.108 --> 00:01:42.258
a little unwieldy of having everything
in one directory, in one folder.

28
00:01:42.258 --> 00:01:46.408
So what you'll often see people do,
and we can just, no, not there.

29
00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:50.926
We can just do this right now,
is have [LAUGH] a src folder or

30
00:01:50.926 --> 00:01:53.574
src directory where typically,

31
00:01:55.236 --> 00:02:00.510
Our littler modules that we're
importing into our other modules,

32
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.227
all of the source code for
all these different things we might

33
00:02:05.227 --> 00:02:09.133
wanna be doing often lives
in this src directory.

34
00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:14.568
Now, when I just dragged and dropped
that counter.js file, which, remember,

35
00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:19.605
my main.js is importing, VS Code, and
this is VS Code magic, is like, you

36
00:02:19.605 --> 00:02:25.325
moved a file called counter.js that your
other files are importing as counter.js.

37
00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:29.668
Do you want to now update
those import statements so

38
00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:33.407
that we're importing src/counter.js?

39
00:02:33.407 --> 00:02:37.572
And to which I will say, yes,
VS Code, please do your job and

40
00:02:37.572 --> 00:02:39.057
make my life easier.

41
00:02:39.057 --> 00:02:44.161
And so now you'll see that VS Code
automatically updated my main.js

42
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:49.265
file to import from the src directory
instead of the root directory,

43
00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:51.821
the ./ that it was doing before.

44
00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:53.761
So that's just some VS Code magic for
us here.

45
00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.645
I'm also gonna put my new
empty Canvas.js in there.

46
00:03:02.645 --> 00:03:06.661
And at this point, it's just asking me
if you're intending to move this or

47
00:03:06.661 --> 00:03:09.530
did you just swipe on your
computer accidentally, or

48
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.783
are you a cat walking
on a keyboard [LAUGH]?

49
00:03:11.783 --> 00:03:12.928
And so, yes, I want to move it.

50
00:03:12.928 --> 00:03:16.558
It didn't ask me about any imports
because there are no imports,

51
00:03:16.558 --> 00:03:18.409
cuz there's nothing to import.

52
00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.303
So let's fix that.

53
00:03:20.303 --> 00:03:23.355
Okay, so here is where I
could do this type of thing.

54
00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.826
And now I'm actually not going
to export anything right now

55
00:03:30.826 --> 00:03:35.204
because we have added this
script tag that's going to

56
00:03:35.204 --> 00:03:39.696
run this script as a module
in the browser in this page.

57
00:03:39.696 --> 00:03:44.089
So it's gonna run through those lines
that code and do what they say.

58
00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:46.771
And let's see what happens.

59
00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:50.208
Okay, so going back to Canvas,
what we're doing is,

60
00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:54.990
we're setting the fillStyle to yellow,
and then we are filling a rectangle

61
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.671
with some numbers here,
which we'll talk about in a sec.

62
00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:03.874
And so once I save my, what happened?

63
00:04:03.874 --> 00:04:04.793
Did I?

64
00:04:04.793 --> 00:04:06.582
I turned it into an F, cool.

65
00:04:06.582 --> 00:04:09.829
Okay, once I save my file,

66
00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:15.284
hopefully, My, what happened?

67
00:04:15.284 --> 00:04:18.686
Something has gone awry.

68
00:04:18.686 --> 00:04:20.926
Disallowed MIME type, cool.

69
00:04:20.926 --> 00:04:25.365
Aha, I had not imported it, but

70
00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:30.792
I had referred to it as /canvas.js and

71
00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:34.090
not src/canvas.js.

72
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.398
This is gonna be ultimately
some Vite magic that's gonna

73
00:04:38.398 --> 00:04:42.972
turn whatever path I put in here
in my src values into whatever

74
00:04:42.972 --> 00:04:47.906
it's gonna ultimately resolve to
in the build, or in this case,

75
00:04:47.906 --> 00:04:52.234
in the temporary build that's
running in my dev server.

76
00:04:52.234 --> 00:04:57.066
And it's not really a build in
the live action freshest modules

77
00:04:57.066 --> 00:04:59.720
that are running in my dev server.

78
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.560
So again, we live and we learn.

79
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.588
Yes, so VS Code did not save us.

80
00:05:06.588 --> 00:05:10.995
Now we have no error and a yellow square,
well, two yellow squares.

81
00:05:10.995 --> 00:05:14.838
But this one we put there, so
we can feel good about that.

82
00:05:14.838 --> 00:05:19.604
Is this the most beautiful website
you've ever seen in your life?

83
00:05:19.604 --> 00:05:25.945
Okay, so now we have seen essentially
that we took a blank canvas,

84
00:05:25.945 --> 00:05:30.601
tabula rasa, and
we filled a yellow rectangle.

85
00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:31.791
And where did we fill it?

86
00:05:31.791 --> 00:05:37.738
Well, we filled it
starting at the position,

87
00:05:37.738 --> 00:05:41.248
the coordinate x0, y0.

88
00:05:41.248 --> 00:05:47.609
We filled a rectangle that is 100
pixels wide and 100 pixels high.

89
00:05:47.609 --> 00:05:50.679
So we started the corner of the rectangle.

90
00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:53.727
Imagine we're in our little MS Paint or
whatever, and

91
00:05:53.727 --> 00:05:58.580
we dragged down 100 pixels and 100 pixels
over, and we painted that rectangle.

92
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.296
And it was yellow because
the current fillStyle was yellow.

93
00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:04.418
So this is Canvas.

94
00:06:04.418 --> 00:06:08.577
There's all kinds of other
things we can do with it, and

95
00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:11.242
that is what we're gonna get into.

96
00:06:11.242 --> 00:06:14.080
But suffice it to say,
it's great at filling rectangles.

97
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.670
It can also do stuff like text.

98
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.407
And a good thing to keep in mind that
we might be comfortable with if we're

99
00:06:22.407 --> 00:06:26.146
used to positioning fixed elements and
stuff like that.

100
00:06:26.146 --> 00:06:30.192
But one thing that if we're used to doing,
I don't know,

101
00:06:30.192 --> 00:06:34.239
non-web data visualization or
math or things like that,

102
00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:39.032
we're not always used to the way
that the Canvas coordinate system,

103
00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:43.766
which is set up, which is 0,
0 is at the top-left of the element.

104
00:06:43.766 --> 00:06:49.058
Well, luckily, at least x and
y are still going the directions,

105
00:06:49.058 --> 00:06:54.159
but the y-axis goes down,
the values increase as you go down,

106
00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:58.121
and the x-axis increases
as you go to the right.

107
00:06:58.121 --> 00:07:02.892
So this is where basically
we told JavaScript, okay,

108
00:07:02.892 --> 00:07:07.142
take this Canvas context,
start at 0, 0, and

109
00:07:07.142 --> 00:07:11.911
draw a rectangle that is yellow,
fill it with yellow,

110
00:07:11.911 --> 00:07:16.390
that is 100 pixels wide and
100 pixels tall.

111
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:20.342
So we can also do that with text.

112
00:07:20.342 --> 00:07:25.528
And similarly to how we have,
can you just please wrap.

113
00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:29.495
Okay, [LAUGH] similar to
how we have the .fillStyle,

114
00:07:29.495 --> 00:07:33.561
we can change that after we
draw the yellow rectangle.

115
00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:37.863
If we wanna draw something black now,
we have to imperatively

116
00:07:37.863 --> 00:07:42.677
change the value of fillStyle,
which can cause some fun accidents.

117
00:07:42.677 --> 00:07:46.910
But anyway, and then we can also set
other properties on the context,

118
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.215
like the font style.

119
00:07:48.215 --> 00:07:53.294
And then we have, analogous to fillRect,
we have a fillText which,

120
00:07:53.294 --> 00:07:57.847
for example, we could pass in
our string.js, give it an x and

121
00:07:57.847 --> 00:08:01.807
a y to position the kind of
anchor of the text element.

122
00:08:01.807 --> 00:08:04.714
Which again, there's all kinds of
parameters and things that we can,

123
00:08:04.714 --> 00:08:06.180
there's fanciness that we can do.

124
00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:10.449
And then this last one is the,
this is where the text begins,

125
00:08:10.449 --> 00:08:13.314
I believe the bottom-left of the text.

126
00:08:13.314 --> 00:08:21.496
And then this is how wide we want to
allow it to be at most, max width.

127
00:08:21.496 --> 00:08:27.021
So if I save this now and I go back
to my instantly reloaded Vite app,

128
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:32.153
I have a much less pretty version
of the JavaScript logo that,

129
00:08:32.153 --> 00:08:36.811
but we drew it,
we didn't just import it from some SVG.

130
00:08:36.811 --> 00:08:40.564
So this is all to say,
we can do whatever we want on the Canvas.

131
00:08:40.564 --> 00:08:42.241
We can just go nuts.
