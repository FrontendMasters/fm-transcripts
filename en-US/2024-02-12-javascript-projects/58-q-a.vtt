00:00:00.321 --> 00:00:05.183
What are the most important things
a junior should be expected to know to

2
00:00:05.183 --> 00:00:06.733
land their first job?

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:11.323
&gt;&gt; Well, I believe for that question,
I will refer you to the entire

4
00:00:11.323 --> 00:00:16.094
wealth of interview-related content and
courses that there are.

5
00:00:16.094 --> 00:00:18.116
&gt;&gt; We have a beginner learning path.

6
00:00:18.116 --> 00:00:20.126
&gt;&gt; A learning path, yes, exactly.

7
00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:22.119
And isn't there a course
about interviewing?

8
00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:28.430
&gt;&gt; There is, we also have a free getting
a job course by Jerome Hardaway.

9
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.546
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So yeah,

10
00:00:29.546 --> 00:00:34.001
take a look at that on Frontend Masters,
it's completely free.

11
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:34.906
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

12
00:00:34.906 --> 00:00:38.080
&gt;&gt; We do have a lot of great
free beginner resources.

13
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.305
&gt;&gt; Definitely, but I will say this,

14
00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:45.447
as someone who has been on both sides of
the hiring table as a junior developer and

15
00:00:45.447 --> 00:00:49.773
as someone interviewing junior
developers and looking for them.

16
00:00:49.773 --> 00:00:52.951
In general, when people are hiring
a junior developer, and by people,

17
00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:56.246
I mean companies, which apparently in
the United States are also people.

18
00:00:56.246 --> 00:01:01.684
But anyway, [LAUGH] the thing that
folks are hiring a junior developer for

19
00:01:01.684 --> 00:01:03.749
is not expertise, right?

20
00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.881
For that,
you would be looking for someone,

21
00:01:06.881 --> 00:01:12.323
if you really need someone who just wrote
the book on some very specific thing,

22
00:01:12.323 --> 00:01:16.707
that's not the role that a junior
dev is gonna be applying for.

23
00:01:16.707 --> 00:01:22.261
Instead, what they're looking for
are people who are willing

24
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:27.814
to learn new concepts,
willing to take guidance from others,

25
00:01:27.814 --> 00:01:32.845
willing to work themselves on
solving problems that they

26
00:01:32.845 --> 00:01:38.116
might have before going and
asking somebody else for help.

27
00:01:38.116 --> 00:01:42.446
So in my experience, sure, there might
be certain things where they say,

28
00:01:42.446 --> 00:01:46.707
it's nice if you have some experience
with X,Y, Z tool and JavaScript,

29
00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:51.066
some particular framework that they
use on their product, what have you.

30
00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:55.191
But for junior level, there is a real,

31
00:01:55.191 --> 00:02:00.191
real value to being able
to ask good questions,

32
00:02:00.191 --> 00:02:07.821
which Julia Evans has a fabulous blog
post about asking good questions.

33
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:11.698
So yeah, Julia Evans, ask good questions,

34
00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:15.778
ought to do it in your
search engine of choice and

35
00:02:15.778 --> 00:02:21.201
I think it's jvns.ca is your site but
don't quote me on that.

36
00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:25.974
Anyway, basically, for example, being
able to say, okay, I have understood that

37
00:02:25.974 --> 00:02:29.486
this is the case and I have
understood that that is the case, but

38
00:02:29.486 --> 00:02:33.200
I'm confused about this thing and
I tried debugging it with this,

39
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.491
this, and this, and
I still don't know what that means.

40
00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:38.103
So could you please help me?

41
00:02:38.103 --> 00:02:42.217
So a team that has some senior
engineer's a lot of experience, but

42
00:02:42.217 --> 00:02:46.698
not a lot of time to mentor junior devs
is going to want people like that who

43
00:02:46.698 --> 00:02:49.213
are able to pick up new skills as they go.

44
00:02:49.213 --> 00:02:54.987
They're able to help get themselves
unstuck, and then they're able to go and

45
00:02:54.987 --> 00:03:00.423
ask for help when they need it, and
not just be stuck and not move forward.

46
00:03:00.423 --> 00:03:05.007
So I would say, more than worrying about,
have I learned the right frameworks and

47
00:03:05.007 --> 00:03:06.079
things like that?

48
00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.575
Learning on those higher level
kind of core scale things about

49
00:03:10.575 --> 00:03:14.638
communicating what you're
thinking about a problem,

50
00:03:14.638 --> 00:03:19.220
communicating what you have
struggled with or have learned and

51
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.249
ideas that you have and
things that you're interested in learning.

52
00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:26.521
All of that is also super valuable,

53
00:03:26.521 --> 00:03:30.473
especially when you're at that
junior dev job search level.

54
00:03:30.473 --> 00:03:35.904
So don't undervalue those type of things,
I would say.

55
00:03:38.216 --> 00:03:42.384
&gt;&gt; Trade offs for starting your career
at a startup versus a corporation.

56
00:03:42.384 --> 00:03:48.709
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Trade offs for starting your
career at a startup versus a corporation.

57
00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.473
Well, there's lots, I suppose [LAUGH].

58
00:03:52.473 --> 00:03:58.009
Startups generally tend to be pretty high
intensity environments, not all of them.

59
00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:02.002
But a lot of them are small teams
that are trying to do big things and

60
00:04:02.002 --> 00:04:05.270
are willing to put in super long hours and
weekends and

61
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.337
kind of make it the main
thing in their lives a lot.

62
00:04:08.337 --> 00:04:14.955
So that's a whole, Situation that
you may or may not be in for.

63
00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:20.650
Startups also generally tend to
have maybe not the best salaries,

64
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.927
but a potential large
upside on the equity front.

65
00:04:24.927 --> 00:04:30.421
But the thing is that, most startups
don't become the unicorns, as they say,

66
00:04:30.421 --> 00:04:35.683
worth billions of dollars, [LAUGH] what
have you, so your mileage may vary.

67
00:04:35.683 --> 00:04:41.462
Corporations, in my experience,
having not been a software developer at

68
00:04:41.462 --> 00:04:47.425
very big corporations myself, but
can sometimes be the helpful structure,

69
00:04:47.425 --> 00:04:51.389
especially if you're coming
in at a junior level.

70
00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.843
A helpful structure of
a very tightly scoped.

71
00:04:54.843 --> 00:04:59.087
This team works on this small thing and
not so much that everyone is wearing

72
00:04:59.087 --> 00:05:03.207
many hats and trying to do many things
at the same time vibe of a startup.

73
00:05:03.207 --> 00:05:06.642
Which can be a good thing
if it is helpful for

74
00:05:06.642 --> 00:05:11.614
you to kind of focus and
kind of get your foot in the door there.

75
00:05:11.614 --> 00:05:14.605
It can also sometimes feel
a bit constraining to people,

76
00:05:14.605 --> 00:05:18.549
especially once they start to get
a little more developed in their career.

77
00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:22.905
Or if you're the type of person who likes
to do all kinds of different things and

78
00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:26.007
doesn't like to be in a very
specialized role a lot, but

79
00:05:26.007 --> 00:05:27.597
that can also be different.

80
00:05:27.597 --> 00:05:31.426
There are some corporations that have kind
of sub organizations that essentially

81
00:05:31.426 --> 00:05:32.655
function like startups.

82
00:05:32.655 --> 00:05:38.276
So this is all to say it depends, [LAUGH]
I guess, but these days, unfortunately,

83
00:05:38.276 --> 00:05:43.341
the hiring market right now, as at
the time of filming, is pretty rough.

84
00:05:43.341 --> 00:05:47.566
And so I think regardless of whether
the market is good or the market is bad,

85
00:05:47.566 --> 00:05:51.256
regardless of whether it's a startup
that's got a job opening or

86
00:05:51.256 --> 00:05:53.620
a corporation that's got a job opening.

87
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.400
If you look for
the people that you're gonna work with and

88
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.048
are they the kinda people that you're
really excited to learn from and

89
00:06:02.048 --> 00:06:06.696
collaborate with, I think that is
gonna make a bigger difference than

90
00:06:06.696 --> 00:06:11.706
the overarching company structure to
your experience and career growth.

91
00:06:11.706 --> 00:06:16.672
But that's all one random person
on the Internet's opinion, so

92
00:06:16.672 --> 00:06:19.297
[LAUGH] take it with a grain of salt.

93
00:06:19.297 --> 00:06:23.732
So Mohammed works as a language teacher
and is now in the way of shifting career

94
00:06:23.732 --> 00:06:27.568
or mixing careers, and I just wanna
say that is exactly what I did.

95
00:06:27.568 --> 00:06:33.227
So I was an English as a foreign
language teacher, Circa,

96
00:06:33.227 --> 00:06:39.241
I don't know, 2008 to 2013,
something like that.

97
00:06:39.241 --> 00:06:42.541
And during that time,
I started getting interested in code,

98
00:06:42.541 --> 00:06:45.777
I started getting interested
in language learning tools and

99
00:06:45.777 --> 00:06:50.046
language teaching tools, things like
computer assisted language learning.

100
00:06:50.046 --> 00:06:52.695
And that's what opened the doors to me and
got me interested in software.

101
00:06:52.695 --> 00:06:59.226
And so first of all, it is awesome to see
other people going through that shift and

102
00:06:59.226 --> 00:07:05.102
I also know how hard it is and I feel you
and it is a climb, but you can do it.

103
00:07:05.102 --> 00:07:10.441
And then the question is, is it feasible
to create a whole website by myself?

104
00:07:10.441 --> 00:07:12.289
Yes, it is indeed feasible.

105
00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:16.702
And hopefully, through this course,
we have learned some tools for

106
00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:19.452
getting our selfie cam is a whole website.

107
00:07:19.452 --> 00:07:24.173
It is maybe not the most complex website,
it's not a Facebook or

108
00:07:24.173 --> 00:07:29.780
what have you, but it is a whole website
and you'll built it, so great job.

109
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:35.478
And also, sometimes we find,
I'm trying to recap here that

110
00:07:35.478 --> 00:07:41.846
we rabbit hole on certain questions or
certain things that we find,

111
00:07:41.846 --> 00:07:47.208
and we spend way too much time
writing code that we didn't

112
00:07:47.208 --> 00:07:52.122
know wasn't really the best
way to do it at the time,

113
00:07:52.122 --> 00:07:56.956
and I would say that is just
the way of [LAUGH] things.

114
00:07:56.956 --> 00:08:01.893
So for example,
there is a great resource that I meant to

115
00:08:01.893 --> 00:08:06.212
mention earlier when we
were talking about Git.

116
00:08:06.212 --> 00:08:08.819
Its real name starts with O and

117
00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:14.137
then there's a word that starts
with SH and rhymes with Git,

118
00:08:14.137 --> 00:08:20.727
but there is another version of
the site called dangitgit.com, I think.

119
00:08:20.727 --> 00:08:22.397
It makes a great point.

120
00:08:22.397 --> 00:08:27.167
It's a basically a way to get
yourself out of bad oopses in Git,

121
00:08:27.167 --> 00:08:28.881
so very useful thing.

122
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:31.085
Also, I believe Julia Evans and

123
00:08:31.085 --> 00:08:36.159
the author of that site who I'm blanking
on right now have a zine about it.

124
00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:40.547
Anyway, it makes the excellent
point point that sometimes you

125
00:08:40.547 --> 00:08:44.850
don't know the thing to put into
your search engine to look for

126
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:49.838
to solve your problem until you already
know how to solve your problem.

127
00:08:49.838 --> 00:08:52.991
So it's like this catch 22 chicken and
egg situation.

128
00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:56.131
And so sometimes,
as we've seen in JavaScript,

129
00:08:56.131 --> 00:08:59.288
there's eight bajillion
ways to do everything.

130
00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:02.890
So sometimes the way that
gets you moving forward,

131
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:07.499
whether it's the most optimal way or
something that somebody was

132
00:09:07.499 --> 00:09:12.544
really mean about on the Internet
when you asked question or whatever.

133
00:09:12.544 --> 00:09:17.375
Don't listen to the haters,
shake it off like Taylor, and

134
00:09:17.375 --> 00:09:23.279
keep writing the code that gets you
moving to the next step, I would say.

135
00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:27.173
So may the force be with you.
