1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.600
All right, so now, we've gotten a getVideo
function, but we haven't gotten a video.

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.977
So now, we should be able to do what
we did in the other module first,

3
00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:14.876
const video equals await getVideo,
I'm gonna to save.

4
00:00:14.876 --> 00:00:19.723
I'm gonna go back over here, and
we'll notice if your browser's sort of

5
00:00:19.723 --> 00:00:23.249
remembering that you already
gave this permission.

6
00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.793
You'll see in Firefox,
there's a little, hey,

7
00:00:25.793 --> 00:00:27.816
this has permission to use your camera.

8
00:00:27.816 --> 00:00:31.011
And maybe you see a little light on
your webcam or something like that.

9
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:35.799
If you hadn't, then you would probably
see something again like this, so

10
00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:37.831
we allow it, okay, cool.

11
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:42.261
And again, nothing happened,
so let us fix that, shall we?

12
00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:49.301
We want that draw image method,
which is available on the canvas context.

13
00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:53.579
Now, again, this is not choose our own
adventure of how we wanna organize this.

14
00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.491
But we have various options and we already
wrote some pretty useful code in here.

15
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:03.963
It's not all useful,
we're not gonna wanna do any of this.

16
00:01:06.393 --> 00:01:10.443
But what we could do, well,
we have pretty small modules here,

17
00:01:10.443 --> 00:01:12.553
so we could bring this into main.

18
00:01:12.553 --> 00:01:16.807
We could decide, how many different
modules do we really want to have for

19
00:01:16.807 --> 00:01:17.724
this project.

20
00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:20.561
Do we want them to be,
exporting their own utility functions or

21
00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:23.246
do we just want to be doing this
imperatively in one script.

22
00:01:23.246 --> 00:01:27.919
So that perhaps other developers that
are trying to contribute to this amazing

23
00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:28.993
selfie project.

24
00:01:28.993 --> 00:01:33.068
Are able to more easily see at
a glance everything that's happening.

25
00:01:33.068 --> 00:01:37.826
So I think it would be reasonable
to start moving some of this

26
00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:40.118
into camera if we wanted to.

27
00:01:40.118 --> 00:01:44.185
And perhaps maybe make a draw photo or
a paint or

28
00:01:44.185 --> 00:01:49.725
whatever method we wanna call it,
a function we wanna call it.

29
00:01:49.725 --> 00:01:54.108
So I'm just gonna go ahead and
empty out my canvas.js and we can just,

30
00:01:54.108 --> 00:01:56.275
you know what, we'll delete it.

31
00:01:56.275 --> 00:01:57.384
And while we're at it,

32
00:01:57.384 --> 00:02:01.167
why don't we also delete the counter
that we're that we're not using anymore.

33
00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:06.081
Yes, I am sure, delete,
love deleting code because you can't

34
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:10.547
have a bug in your code if you
don't have any code, right.

35
00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:14.687
[LAUGH] So imagine that meme here,
okay, we don't need this secret value.

36
00:02:15.717 --> 00:02:17.707
We do need to do some stuff with a canvas.

37
00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.919
Now, how we wanna set this up is,
again up to us.

38
00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:30.293
Now, do we wanna be grabbing this
canvas element from within a function,

39
00:02:30.293 --> 00:02:33.339
do we wanna be doing
it in the main module.

40
00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.709
Again, it's like,
there's reasons for everything.

41
00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.735
How does it sound to y'all
if we don't assume that we

42
00:02:40.735 --> 00:02:44.957
know which Canvas element
we're supposed to draw to.

43
00:02:44.957 --> 00:02:49.675
And we don't assume that there's just one
Canvas element with this query selector,

44
00:02:49.675 --> 00:02:52.900
or basically using just
the tag name Canvas.

45
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.866
What if we, in this module where
we are providing generally useful

46
00:02:57.866 --> 00:03:00.359
camera related functionality.

47
00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.717
We let our user decide what
canvas they want to draw

48
00:03:05.717 --> 00:03:10.579
stuff on, for example, sound okay, cool.

49
00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.969
So, what I'm going to do now
is wrap this little guy.

50
00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.804
Okay, we're going to export
it again in a function,

51
00:03:17.804 --> 00:03:20.080
which we can figure out the name for
later.

52
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.498
[LAUGH] Where it's going to
take in a canvas element, and

53
00:03:24.498 --> 00:03:29.579
then it can find the context on
that canvas, how's that sound?

54
00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:37.040
Okay, how about we call

55
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.044
this draw video on Canvas,

56
00:03:42.044 --> 00:03:45.534
what sounds good?

57
00:03:45.534 --> 00:03:48.351
Anybody gonna help me out
with a naming opinion?

58
00:03:48.351 --> 00:03:49.634
&gt;&gt; Draw a video.

59
00:03:49.634 --> 00:03:50.134
&gt;&gt; Draw a video.

60
00:03:52.834 --> 00:03:58.030
It's very symmetrical to our get video and
that's helpful because,

61
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.061
for example, if you have a whole
bunch of functions in your module.

62
00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:08.156
And some of them take, they're all related

63
00:04:08.156 --> 00:04:13.400
to video then some of them,
some of them say.

64
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.075
Video interaction interface,
whatever, and others say,

65
00:04:18.075 --> 00:04:22.667
yeah, do the thing,
we want to have consistency, right.

66
00:04:22.667 --> 00:04:24.727
So every code base might be different, but

67
00:04:24.727 --> 00:04:28.687
ideally, at least within our own code
base, we can be as consistent as possible.

68
00:04:28.687 --> 00:04:30.117
So that seems reasonable.

69
00:04:30.117 --> 00:04:34.776
The other thing we want to try
to be consistent with is, for

70
00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:38.114
example, if we have multiple unctions.

71
00:04:38.114 --> 00:04:43.025
And so here we're probably gonna need
like a video to draw, ultimately.

72
00:04:43.025 --> 00:04:46.139
But if we have multiple functions
that are taking in video elements and

73
00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:46.995
canvas elements.

74
00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:52.075
Let's not switch the order of the
parameters around on our users and stuff.

75
00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:54.583
Let's just keep things as
consistent as possible,

76
00:04:54.583 --> 00:04:57.441
keeping in mind that what we're
doing here in this module.

77
00:04:57.441 --> 00:05:01.954
Whether it is for our own internal use or
somebody else's use,

78
00:05:01.954 --> 00:05:05.886
some other stranger aka a friend and
developer buddy.

79
00:05:05.886 --> 00:05:09.248
That we haven't met yet
on the internet to use,

80
00:05:09.248 --> 00:05:12.623
we are exposing a way of
interacting with this.

81
00:05:12.623 --> 00:05:18.738
And we want to try to help our users
have as few headaches as possible.

82
00:05:18.738 --> 00:05:19.268
Okay, cool.
