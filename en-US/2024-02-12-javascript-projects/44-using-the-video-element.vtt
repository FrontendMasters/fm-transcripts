WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.082 --> 00:00:02.080
So we're gonna take in a video,
we're gonna take into Canvas.

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.059
All right, we're not done, but let us okay
yes, and it's bouncing because we have

3
00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:11.689
the permission still going but let's go
back to main and sort of symmetrical to

4
00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:15.431
how we got the video element which
was created by our get video.

5
00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:17.562
In this case, we can decide how we want,

6
00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:19.964
which Canvas we want to
pull from the page in.

7
00:00:19.964 --> 00:00:22.624
In this case, we only have one,
but who knows?

8
00:00:22.624 --> 00:00:26.160
You could go wild and
just have a whole bunch of can buy.

9
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.432
[LAUGH] And so
what we can do then there is we

10
00:00:31.432 --> 00:00:39.819
can import our new thing that
we call drawVideo, okay, great.

11
00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:44.902
[LAUGH] We can import java drawVideo
along with our getVideo by

12
00:00:44.902 --> 00:00:49.885
putting a comma between these here and
this is the exact same

13
00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:54.969
destructuring syntax that we
can use within an assignment or

14
00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.375
within a function declaration for
the parameters.

15
00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:01.398
So same syntax there,

16
00:01:01.398 --> 00:01:06.729
we can import multiple things
at once from the same module.

17
00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.921
Okay, so now we can do something like,
drawVideo,

18
00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:16.877
video, and helpfully,
VS Code is even telling me

19
00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:21.491
what the signature is
of my drawVideo method.

20
00:01:21.491 --> 00:01:25.774
And so those colon any, colon any, that's
some typeScript stuff that is probably

21
00:01:25.774 --> 00:01:29.263
an artifact of having written some
other TypeScript code in this and

22
00:01:29.263 --> 00:01:31.179
had set up some TypeScript tooling.

23
00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.144
But in any case, another reason
why TypeScript has gotten so

24
00:01:35.144 --> 00:01:40.045
popular is because it works really
nicely with these developer tools where

25
00:01:40.045 --> 00:01:41.771
it can give us all of this.

26
00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:45.152
Like kind of static in this information
that it gets from just reading our code

27
00:01:45.152 --> 00:01:47.702
base and looking at all
the declarations and everything,

28
00:01:47.702 --> 00:01:50.994
which then VS code can take advantage
of to give us helpful hints as we type.

29
00:01:50.994 --> 00:01:54.316
Okay, but for now,
we just it just reminds us that yes,

30
00:01:54.316 --> 00:01:56.956
we do the video first,
and then the canvas.

31
00:01:56.956 --> 00:02:01.885
Cool, fabulous, wonderful, all right.

32
00:02:01.885 --> 00:02:06.563
And nothing happened because we didn't
really do anything [LAUGH] let's fix it,

33
00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:09.656
okay, we have a video
element that we're not using,

34
00:02:09.656 --> 00:02:12.990
we have a Canvas that we're
get using to get the context.

35
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.286
And we're not using that either so
now we have to put them together and

36
00:02:17.286 --> 00:02:21.154
does anyone remember her without
me switching to this slide.

37
00:02:21.154 --> 00:02:27.420
Slides, what I need to do to draw
this video to this canvas context.

38
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.803
So it starts, let's see if
VS Code can help us, shall we?

39
00:02:33.803 --> 00:02:37.709
So it starts with basically all of
the stuff we're gonna do to the canvas is

40
00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.679
the rendering context is
what's gonna help us do that.

41
00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:42.612
So we'll start start typing context.

42
00:02:42.612 --> 00:02:43.903
Thanks, VS Code, yes.

43
00:02:43.903 --> 00:02:48.453
So what we're looking for, and we can
go back to our reference here, or our.

44
00:02:53.832 --> 00:02:58.268
Handy dandy MDN reference,
is to call context.drawImage, and

45
00:02:58.268 --> 00:03:01.261
then the video, and then the origin point.

46
00:03:01.261 --> 00:03:03.736
Point of where we want to
start drawing that video.

47
00:03:03.736 --> 00:03:07.092
And we could add a whole bunch of other
arguments to specify the sizes, but

48
00:03:07.092 --> 00:03:08.516
let's just try the basic.

49
00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:13.639
So copy, okay, fab,

50
00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:19.576
let's see what happens.

51
00:03:21.146 --> 00:03:26.138
Okay, well,
we have something happening, but

52
00:03:26.138 --> 00:03:31.875
it's probably not what we
intended to happen, right?

53
00:03:33.455 --> 00:03:36.705
So interesting, what's going on here?

54
00:03:36.705 --> 00:03:37.691
We drew something.

55
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:40.870
We drew nothing.

56
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.988
But, before it was just blank.

57
00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:44.338
Now we have a rectangle.

58
00:03:44.338 --> 00:03:46.137
So that's winning.

59
00:03:46.137 --> 00:03:49.118
[LAUGH] So we are drawing.

60
00:03:49.118 --> 00:03:49.948
This is all valid.

61
00:03:49.948 --> 00:03:55.708
We're drawing a video to the screen,
but let's poke around here.

62
00:03:55.708 --> 00:03:56.698
So we've been debugging.

63
00:03:56.698 --> 00:03:58.118
We've been poking around at things.

64
00:03:58.118 --> 00:04:01.628
We've been trying to look at different
events and I'm a little puzzled, but

65
00:04:01.628 --> 00:04:03.148
here's one thing that we can do.

66
00:04:03.148 --> 00:04:07.937
And again, does the web always make sense
to do it to any of us even if we've

67
00:04:07.937 --> 00:04:11.722
been doing it professionally for
years, like, no, no,

68
00:04:11.722 --> 00:04:17.408
all of the things, no, of course, and
I am certainly last at least of all.

69
00:04:17.408 --> 00:04:24.132
However, there's also something that we
could do which is essentially, wait for

70
00:04:24.132 --> 00:04:29.815
our user to actually interact with
the page, and click on the button.

71
00:04:31.515 --> 00:04:34.830
And so what we could do is, essentially,

72
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.895
instead of drawing the video on an event
that's just attached to the video,

73
00:04:40.895 --> 00:04:45.631
what we actually want the user
to be able to do is control when

74
00:04:45.631 --> 00:04:49.181
the picture gets taken, right, ideally.

75
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:54.258
So, let's start working on
our button click handler and

76
00:04:54.258 --> 00:04:57.218
see if we can find a workaround for

77
00:04:57.218 --> 00:05:02.422
this event situation that
we're not making progress on.

78
00:05:02.422 --> 00:05:04.005
How's that sound?

79
00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:04.741
&gt;&gt; Great.

80
00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:07.841
&gt;&gt; Fabulous, okay, so we have a button.

81
00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:12.549
Its id is counter, I mean we could change
that like maybe to camera because now that

82
00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:14.471
was a historical accident also.

83
00:05:16.521 --> 00:05:19.111
So now, I probably wanna get the button.

84
00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:21.974
We've done this a billion times,
so button.

85
00:05:21.974 --> 00:05:31.193
Document, get element by ID camera.

86
00:05:31.193 --> 00:05:34.390
I could have given it a different name
cuz it's a button, it's not a camera, but

87
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.941
like, I don't know, launch camera,

88
00:05:35.941 --> 00:05:38.560
whatever you can id away
how you feel appropriate.

89
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.230
And so now, instead of doing
this draw video in an event.

90
00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:45.841
When an event from the video fires,
we wanna wait for

91
00:05:45.841 --> 00:05:47.792
an event from the user
interaction to fire,

92
00:05:47.792 --> 00:05:50.681
which is actually more the behavior
we want this page to have.

93
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:52.821
We were just trying to see
if we could draw something.

94
00:05:52.821 --> 00:05:56.497
But really what we want to do is not
just be willy-nilly drawing frames to

95
00:05:56.497 --> 00:06:00.173
the canvas, we wanna be able to let
the user take a selfie cuz that's what

96
00:06:00.173 --> 00:06:01.761
the button says it does.

97
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:05.052
So [LAUGH] let's try to do that.

98
00:06:05.052 --> 00:06:12.974
So we can do button at our
handy dandy event listener,

99
00:06:12.974 --> 00:06:17.902
click, and then do some stuff and

100
00:06:17.902 --> 00:06:22.831
we can try to handle this in here,

101
00:06:22.831 --> 00:06:26.545
let us see if that works.

102
00:06:26.545 --> 00:06:28.635
I honestly, I'm not confident.

103
00:06:28.635 --> 00:06:32.304
And the other thing is,
what we could also do is since this video,

104
00:06:32.304 --> 00:06:36.574
it's not like a YouTube video or like some
kind of file that we want the user to

105
00:06:36.574 --> 00:06:39.555
only play when they're
ready to start watching it.

106
00:06:39.555 --> 00:06:41.985
It's like a live feed, right?

107
00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:45.484
So we can actually like start playing it
basically whenever because we're not now

108
00:06:45.484 --> 00:06:50.120
trying to make sure that there's a handler
before we fire the events and blah, blah.

109
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.268
So we could do this earlier in the file,
we could even

110
00:06:55.268 --> 00:07:01.831
probably put it back where it was
before in the get video function.

111
00:07:01.831 --> 00:07:03.469
And by the way, I was messing around.

112
00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:08.182
So this is again, this is just like
there's an older version of this API

113
00:07:08.182 --> 00:07:11.167
where you have to like do
a little more work and

114
00:07:11.167 --> 00:07:14.402
use the get an object URL and
blah blah blah.

115
00:07:14.402 --> 00:07:19.082
So this is like one pattern that you might
see a lot is like try something that is

116
00:07:19.082 --> 00:07:23.794
how modern browsers will do it and
if that doesn't work and ideally you're.

117
00:07:23.794 --> 00:07:28.086
Doing a little more checking that
this isn't like some other error,

118
00:07:28.086 --> 00:07:31.664
[LAUGH] then use the fallback
of the older way to do it.

119
00:07:31.664 --> 00:07:36.431
So just a sidebar on like, we're still
living in a world maybe we don't all have

120
00:07:36.431 --> 00:07:41.196
to support IE for anymore, but we're still
all living in a world where we do have

121
00:07:41.196 --> 00:07:44.195
a whole bunch of different user agents.

122
00:07:44.195 --> 00:07:46.875
And different devices, and
different, you know, all this stuff.

123
00:07:46.875 --> 00:07:49.425
So, we have a lot of
try-catching in our lives.

124
00:07:51.155 --> 00:07:53.088
And so, since this is a live feed,

125
00:07:53.088 --> 00:07:57.705
and it can be running the whole time,
we can just start playing it.

126
00:07:57.705 --> 00:07:58.245
Let's do that.

127
00:08:00.655 --> 00:08:04.230
And let's save this, and
let's see if we've made any progress.

128
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.570
Am I getting any errors?

129
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.870
No, okay, what's gonna happen?

130
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.525
Drumroll, please, honestly confused.

131
00:08:10.525 --> 00:08:16.268
Hey, [LAUGH] we got a ceiling, [LAUGH].
