1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.833
Okay, so
I wasn't very positioned in the frame.

2
00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:08.940
Okay, all right,
now I'm looking right at the camera.

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.060
And we're now getting into another
little issue that we have here.

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.770
Any idea why I'm getting this
very weird corner of my forehead?

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.960
&gt;&gt; Canva size?

6
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.408
&gt;&gt; The size of these two
things is different.

7
00:00:21.408 --> 00:00:24.571
We didn't set any canvas size,
any width or

8
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:27.477
height on our element in the canvas, and

9
00:00:27.477 --> 00:00:33.968
the video has some size that it is getting
from the camera that's attached, right?

10
00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:35.758
So they may or may not line up.

11
00:00:36.878 --> 00:00:41.639
And so
probably what we wanna do is make sure

12
00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:46.788
that we are drawing
the right size of things.

13
00:00:46.788 --> 00:00:49.668
And this is again where all those
arguments to our draw functions come in.

14
00:00:49.668 --> 00:00:51.410
We can poke around,
we can try a few different things.

15
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.513
Like, for example, we can do like video

16
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.826
Width is a property that we should have.

17
00:01:01.826 --> 00:01:03.856
Let's just try logging it.

18
00:01:06.096 --> 00:01:09.500
Whoa, console that console, okay.

19
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.674
And then on the canvas element,
I believe we also have access

20
00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:20.050
to a width property also it's
a property it's not a function,

21
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.131
[LAUGH] everything is a function
until it's not a function.

22
00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:32.490
Okay, so let's, [LAUGH] Just log these
as we draw this misshapen photo.

23
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.780
See what happens.

24
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.679
Okay, so you see the canvas, I believe the
default width for the canvas element if

25
00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.804
you don't set one, is 300 pixels wide,
whereas the video is 640 pixels wide.

26
00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:45.477
So that's not gonna happen.

27
00:01:45.477 --> 00:01:49.884
That's not gonna help us, right?

28
00:01:49.884 --> 00:01:53.173
We can make sure that we're
drawing the width here,

29
00:01:53.173 --> 00:01:58.856
video.video width if we want to make sure
that we're drawing all 600 and 40 pixels,

30
00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:04.128
we can do that and then we also match it
with there's a corresponding video height.

31
00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:06.869
But.

32
00:02:09.067 --> 00:02:14.268
Once again, if the canvas is too small,
that ain't gonna happen so we can scale

33
00:02:14.268 --> 00:02:19.472
down like for example, we could do some
multiplying of ratios to like scale down

34
00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:24.858
the ratio of the widths of the heights to
whatever the width of the canvas is, etc.

35
00:02:24.858 --> 00:02:32.487
But for now, in the interest
of getting on with our lives,

36
00:02:32.487 --> 00:02:37.749
let us just set the width on our canvas.

37
00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:39.888
I wonder, let's see, can we mess with it?

38
00:02:39.888 --> 00:02:47.007
Can this width equals video width?

39
00:02:47.007 --> 00:02:48.142
I don't know.
Will it work?

40
00:02:48.142 --> 00:02:48.731
Let's find out.

41
00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:49.542
Will it blend?

42
00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:53.362
Doesn't seem like it.

43
00:02:54.782 --> 00:02:56.570
Well, all right.
No, it worked on the width.

44
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.946
&gt;&gt; Yap,
&gt;&gt; At least now I have a whole forehead.

45
00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:05.460
[LAUGH] But I don't believe in our,
yes, there is a height.

46
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.792
Let's do it, let's set the height as well,

47
00:03:09.792 --> 00:03:14.587
okay, canvas.height = video.videoHeight.

48
00:03:14.587 --> 00:03:15.517
And now, I mean,

49
00:03:15.517 --> 00:03:18.989
we could use either of these
properties now in our draw image call.

50
00:03:20.718 --> 00:03:24.635
Moment of truth, drumroll please.

51
00:03:24.635 --> 00:03:29.327
[LAUGH] The most beautiful
photo ever taken.

52
00:03:29.327 --> 00:03:31.022
[LAUGH] Okay.

53
00:03:32.122 --> 00:03:37.992
All right, do I look super silly?

54
00:03:37.992 --> 00:03:39.166
Sure I do.

55
00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:42.434
But, did we take a selfie
with JavaScript and

56
00:03:42.434 --> 00:03:48.146
a whole bunch of modern APIs and
a modern build tool with a fancy logo?

57
00:03:48.146 --> 00:03:53.147
Also yes, so the takeaway here
is hopefully that although

58
00:03:53.147 --> 00:03:59.390
this may not be the most exciting piece
of the puzzle, it's a lot of fun.

59
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.805
[LAUGH] The most exciting
node package ever written.

60
00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:07.531
It's [LAUGH] also going to be
[LAUGH] a way to a small project

61
00:04:07.531 --> 00:04:11.656
that we can use to teach
ourselves about all these

62
00:04:11.656 --> 00:04:16.499
different APIs that we can then go on and
dig deeper into.

63
00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:23.869
So where we're going to leave us off here,
it's not on my face,

64
00:04:23.869 --> 00:04:29.055
is essentially with the idea
that like now that we have

65
00:04:29.055 --> 00:04:35.392
been through a whole bunch of
small projects, we did our modals,

66
00:04:35.392 --> 00:04:40.981
and we did our, and
we got lots of errors, and we.

67
00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:44.861
Found out lots of ways that
our assumptions can be wrong.

68
00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:49.741
And we had a few quick and
not so quick wins along the way.

69
00:04:49.741 --> 00:04:55.191
And also so there is a version of
my code up in this repository.

70
00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:56.841
Some of you might have
already clicked this button.

71
00:04:58.261 --> 00:05:01.264
I have committed the cardinal sin of not
having a readme in this repo, sorry.

72
00:05:01.264 --> 00:05:08.104
But in github/vacila, vacila,
or that's my name and initial.

73
00:05:08.104 --> 00:05:12.868
And then selfie minus cam is where you can
find the source code that is not go be

74
00:05:12.868 --> 00:05:15.995
identical to what we just
typed out together, but

75
00:05:15.995 --> 00:05:18.014
basically does the same thing.

76
00:05:18.014 --> 00:05:24.094
And that is also linked on
the course landing page.
