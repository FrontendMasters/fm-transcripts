WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.461 --> 00:00:03.598
Now, the fun begins.

2
00:00:03.598 --> 00:00:07.673
I have been promising you
hackathon time this whole time.

3
00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:13.183
And now we're here,
we are on the hack side.

4
00:00:13.183 --> 00:00:18.750
And so the idea now is we've
covered this is this Meme-Me repo

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.853
is essentially a review or a recap
with a couple little extra bits and

6
00:00:24.853 --> 00:00:29.259
bobs of all the stuff that
we have covered so far.

7
00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.744
But now, your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

8
00:00:34.744 --> 00:00:40.346
is to take this starter package
of the Meme-Me project and

9
00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:46.538
have at it with whatever other
stuff you would like to make it do.

10
00:00:46.538 --> 00:00:51.468
So we're gonna take some time to be
able to hack on this at our leisure,

11
00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:53.489
but here's the basic flow.

12
00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.563
We're now gonna start using GitHub's
features for open source collaboration.

13
00:00:59.563 --> 00:01:03.196
And this is the same thing that
would happen if, let's say,

14
00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:07.114
you notice a bug in Vite, and
you want to help the Vite team fix it,

15
00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:11.264
you would do essentially the same
thing that we're about to do here.

16
00:01:11.264 --> 00:01:16.876
So in case we haven't worked with
this before, what I'll ask y'all

17
00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:21.928
to do is go to my repo, so
github.com/vakilla/meme-me.

18
00:01:21.928 --> 00:01:26.624
And now instead of doing what we might
be used to doing of cloning this and

19
00:01:26.624 --> 00:01:30.303
it might it might give you this command or
downloading,

20
00:01:30.303 --> 00:01:32.435
we're not gonna do [LAUGH] that.

21
00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:36.256
Instead we're gonna go to
this fork button up here.

22
00:01:36.256 --> 00:01:40.987
You should see a fork button and
I have been forked this, yeah,

23
00:01:40.987 --> 00:01:43.230
cuz it's my own repository.

24
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.303
But if you click fork, it will basically
give you the same interface as creating

25
00:01:48.303 --> 00:01:53.224
a new repo except this repo that you're
about to create, which will be in, so

26
00:01:53.224 --> 00:01:58.145
in my case, I have a few different
GitHub organizations I'm involved with,

27
00:01:58.145 --> 00:02:00.447
we're not gonna worry about that.

28
00:02:00.447 --> 00:02:03.396
You perhaps only have one,
but in any case,

29
00:02:03.396 --> 00:02:08.262
this is probably in your personal Github
unless you want your boss to also

30
00:02:08.262 --> 00:02:12.594
have Meme-Me now as part of your
company's product offering.

31
00:02:12.594 --> 00:02:17.101
But [LAUGH] the idea is that
you'll choose yourself.

32
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:20.723
So in this case, well, I can't choose
myself cuz I already have this repo but,

33
00:02:20.723 --> 00:02:22.414
you'll be able to choose your name.

34
00:02:22.414 --> 00:02:25.244
You can rename the repo if you want,
you don't have to.

35
00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:29.798
You can give it a new description, you
can copy the main branch because I don't

36
00:02:29.798 --> 00:02:32.979
think I have any other branches,
I'm [LAUGH] not sure.

37
00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:37.452
And when you click Create Fork,
which I'm not able to do right now cuz I'm

38
00:02:37.452 --> 00:02:40.553
not gonna put it in one of
the other organizations,

39
00:02:40.553 --> 00:02:44.114
you will get now your own GitHub
repo that is a forked repo.

40
00:02:44.114 --> 00:02:47.797
So it points back to my repo as the,

41
00:02:47.797 --> 00:02:52.243
what's called, upstream repository.

42
00:02:52.243 --> 00:02:53.706
But now, essentially,

43
00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:57.404
you can develop the same way as
we did in our SelfieCam project.

44
00:02:57.404 --> 00:03:03.815
You can develop and deploy and
do all of your stuff In your fork and

45
00:03:03.815 --> 00:03:09.513
make it your own fork in the road
like take it in a different

46
00:03:09.513 --> 00:03:16.079
direction than my project and
make your own silly memefying app.

47
00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.623
Although it's not that silly,

48
00:03:17.623 --> 00:03:21.580
there are entire websites that people use
all the time to make these custom memes.

49
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.877
And now we have one so
we can have like tate like me memes.

50
00:03:26.877 --> 00:03:33.012
I mean I don't have to use the poos and
things all over the place.

51
00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:37.595
We need the poo [LAUGH] or otherwise or
drake or whoever I can just

52
00:03:37.595 --> 00:03:42.190
recreate all of my memes and
make people look at my silly face.

53
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.503
Okay, so that is the challenge.

54
00:03:46.503 --> 00:03:51.475
And now the question is, what would
you like to do with this project?

55
00:03:51.475 --> 00:03:52.859
You can do whatever you want.

56
00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.849
And I am very much looking forward
to seeing what you all come up with.

57
00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.919
But in case you need a little Creative
Jumpstart, we could make ourselves

58
00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:07.929
a kind of little feature or wish list
of things that we would like to have.

59
00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:11.268
So here are some ideas
that I would love to see.

60
00:04:11.268 --> 00:04:15.318
For example, the text is always
in the exact same place and

61
00:04:15.318 --> 00:04:17.640
it's not centered or anything.

62
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.504
And some memes have
different text placement,

63
00:04:21.504 --> 00:04:25.374
right, like the handshake
meme with the arms.

64
00:04:25.374 --> 00:04:29.534
Anyway, so maybe you wanns allow your
users to choose where the text goes.

65
00:04:29.534 --> 00:04:34.274
Maybe you want to give them more
pieces of text on the screen.

66
00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:38.175
Maybe you wanna give them additional
fonts and not force them to use impact.

67
00:04:38.175 --> 00:04:42.995
Maybe you wanna be able to set different
colors for the text, what have you.

68
00:04:42.995 --> 00:04:47.836
Or maybe you wanna even do
some digging in the Canvas and

69
00:04:47.836 --> 00:04:52.690
MDN docs and figure out how
to put filters on the image.

70
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.172
Which if you've worked with CSS filters,

71
00:04:56.172 --> 00:05:01.503
maybe you want a black and
white selfie instead of a colorful one.

72
00:05:01.503 --> 00:05:06.161
Or a sepia tone or an inversion to
do like, everything's bananas meme.

73
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:14.657
Anyway, maybe you want to be able to add
some emoji like a shades on the memes.

74
00:05:14.657 --> 00:05:19.984
Maybe you want there to be a Share
button so you can like yeah

75
00:05:19.984 --> 00:05:26.521
Generate a link to go [LAUGH] to your
Twitter account and share the image.

76
00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:29.316
Anything else that we can
think of is fair game here.

77
00:05:29.316 --> 00:05:33.718
So do folks have any other ideas of
stuff that maybe they will or won't do,

78
00:05:33.718 --> 00:05:37.276
but that they might do,
one could think of this app have it.

79
00:05:37.276 --> 00:05:37.885
Yeah?

80
00:05:37.885 --> 00:05:41.384
&gt;&gt; I was going to, cause this is the right
click, well, at least in Safari,

81
00:05:41.384 --> 00:05:44.786
the right-click on the Canvas and
save the image didn't really work.

82
00:05:44.786 --> 00:05:45.355
&gt;&gt; Doesn't work?

83
00:05:45.355 --> 00:05:45.955
Okay, gotcha.

84
00:05:45.955 --> 00:05:49.649
&gt;&gt; So I was gonna see, I was looking up to
see if there's a way to take Canvas and

85
00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:52.484
save it to an actual image,
and then hit a download link.

86
00:05:52.484 --> 00:05:54.857
&gt;&gt; A download button, yeah,
or a link, yeah, totally.

87
00:05:54.857 --> 00:05:57.713
Absolutely useful, yes, fabulous.

88
00:05:57.713 --> 00:05:58.883
Any other ideas?

89
00:05:58.883 --> 00:06:01.915
Just to get our imaginations going?

90
00:06:01.915 --> 00:06:03.562
In the chat, do we have any?

91
00:06:06.028 --> 00:06:08.007
&gt;&gt; Post it to social media.

92
00:06:08.007 --> 00:06:09.377
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

93
00:06:09.377 --> 00:06:14.347
Yeah, If we can figure out how to
programmatically get that image data.

94
00:06:14.347 --> 00:06:20.003
And then, perhaps one of our favorite
social media sites, has some information

95
00:06:20.003 --> 00:06:25.344
or had programmatically send a request
with the right info to your account?

96
00:06:25.344 --> 00:06:28.364
&gt;&gt; There's like a share web API, I think.

97
00:06:28.364 --> 00:06:34.237
&gt;&gt; And this is where we're gonna just have
to start digging on the interwebs and

98
00:06:34.237 --> 00:06:37.175
looking for Stack Overflow answers or

99
00:06:37.175 --> 00:06:41.234
blog posts that explain how to do stuff or
whatever.

100
00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:45.594
So at this point it's really we've opened
up into the wide world of web development.

101
00:06:45.594 --> 00:06:50.250
Especially when you're working on
pet projects and it's not that your

102
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:55.152
boss is specifying that you have to use
certain tools or do a certain thing.

103
00:06:55.152 --> 00:06:57.094
And really, sky's the limit here.
