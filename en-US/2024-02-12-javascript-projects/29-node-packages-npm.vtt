1
00:00:00.102 --> 00:00:05.615
And that brings us to nodes BFF, NPM.

2
00:00:05.615 --> 00:00:08.874
And some people will say that this
stands for Node Package Manager, but

3
00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:11.767
according to NPM, it does not stand for
Node Package Manager.

4
00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:16.443
It stands for NPM is a package manager,
or not a package manager or something.

5
00:00:16.443 --> 00:00:20.851
So anyway, if you go to npmjs.com,
you'll now see a new acronym for

6
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:24.879
NPM every, I don't know,
it's every time you go to the page or

7
00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:28.914
every few seconds, it changes so
it just they're fun random.

8
00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:30.765
NPM doesn't stand for
anything, it's just NPM.

9
00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:35.515
Anyway, so it is a package
manager [LAUGH] for JavaScript.

10
00:00:35.515 --> 00:00:37.539
It's not the only one.

11
00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.711
And increasingly, some developers

12
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:45.424
are starting to be big fans
of other package managers.

13
00:00:45.424 --> 00:00:50.273
So I'd say probably the two other
major ones that you might hear of,

14
00:00:50.273 --> 00:00:53.763
which we're not gonna
cover in this course, but

15
00:00:53.763 --> 00:00:58.977
I'm sure are widely learnable on
front-end masters are Yarn and PNPM.

16
00:00:58.977 --> 00:01:03.626
So just to be aware that this is not
the only way to get node packages,

17
00:01:03.626 --> 00:01:06.736
[LAUGH] but
it's the one that's most common.

18
00:01:06.736 --> 00:01:07.934
So we're gonna use it.

19
00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:11.661
And it's also great because it comes out
of the box with your node installation.

20
00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:16.562
So if you have node in your path here

21
00:01:16.562 --> 00:01:20.450
If you have access to node,

22
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.198
then you also have access to NPM.

23
00:01:25.198 --> 00:01:28.611
And these are different programs so they
have different versions and everything but

24
00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:29.725
they kinda go hand in hand.

25
00:01:29.725 --> 00:01:34.504
So there is an NPM for every node.

26
00:01:34.504 --> 00:01:39.645
[LAUGH] All right, so what is NPM steal?

27
00:01:39.645 --> 00:01:43.923
Well, it exposes us to a massive,

28
00:01:43.923 --> 00:01:48.504
absolutely massive collection of,

29
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.776
Code randos on the Internet have written,
basically.

30
00:01:52.776 --> 00:01:58.723
[LAUGH] So if you go to npmjs.com,
which why don't we just do that right now?

31
00:02:01.443 --> 00:02:04.519
And it used to be like a .org, but
I think, yeah, GitHub owns it now.

32
00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:06.237
So, nope.

33
00:02:06.237 --> 00:02:09.097
All right, so, and here's our,
yes, Neoplastic Plasma Medusa.

34
00:02:09.097 --> 00:02:10.386
All right, anyway.

35
00:02:10.386 --> 00:02:16.074
[LAUGH] So, if you search for pretty
much anything that comes to your mind,

36
00:02:16.074 --> 00:02:19.559
like the word that's on
my mind all the time,

37
00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:24.607
you will find 651 packages that
are somehow related to memes or

38
00:02:24.607 --> 00:02:29.774
have the word meme in them including
one that's just called meme.

39
00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:31.163
So what are all of these?

40
00:02:31.163 --> 00:02:33.444
I mean, do they have to be memes?

41
00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:34.293
No, they don't.

42
00:02:34.293 --> 00:02:37.118
They could also be something
related to a framework.

43
00:02:37.118 --> 00:02:41.365
Let's say like React, and
that's 6,000 packages and

44
00:02:41.365 --> 00:02:46.027
probably even more than that cuz
these are very round numbers, and

45
00:02:46.027 --> 00:02:48.787
I don't trust that that's a, [LAUGH].

46
00:02:48.787 --> 00:02:53.988
I mean React itself is a package on NPM.

47
00:02:53.988 --> 00:02:58.743
We're not gonna talk about React, but
any of these frameworks that we know,

48
00:02:58.743 --> 00:03:03.645
all of these different tools for this
framework, all kinds of other things that

49
00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:08.574
might be intended to accomplish different
functionality that you might want.

50
00:03:08.574 --> 00:03:13.102
Like, I don't know,
maybe I want to look for

51
00:03:13.102 --> 00:03:16.590
something related to cameras.

52
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.184
Well, somebody called Contra four years
ago published something called Camera,

53
00:03:21.184 --> 00:03:25.449
which is just a dead simple package to
create readable streams from connected

54
00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:26.058
webcams.

55
00:03:26.058 --> 00:03:27.579
Okay, cool.

56
00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.669
So, there is a whole bunch of stuff
here and the thing is that you'll

57
00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:38.046
find all information about like,
okay, what is this package called?

58
00:03:38.046 --> 00:03:43.431
A little description, there's maybe
some tags, the author of who it is,

59
00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:48.742
and what version is that, how long
ago it's published, all this stuff.

60
00:03:48.742 --> 00:03:52.504
And you will notice some very different
values in some of these, right?

61
00:03:52.504 --> 00:03:57.814
You'll notice some big names like,
for example, where were we?

62
00:03:57.814 --> 00:04:00.628
With React.

63
00:04:00.628 --> 00:04:01.720
Well, that doesn't seem right.

64
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.037
But anyway, [LAUGH] there'll
be like big companies that

65
00:04:07.037 --> 00:04:14.856
have their own repositories of all these
different tools that they've created.

66
00:04:14.856 --> 00:04:20.024
And then there'll also be just like
random people like me, on the Internet,

67
00:04:20.024 --> 00:04:24.571
publishing things that might have
no business publishing things.

68
00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:29.012
There will also be things that are decades
old, things that are hours old,

69
00:04:29.012 --> 00:04:31.704
[LAUGH] things that are days old or
months old.

70
00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:36.974
So this is all to say,
there is so much stuff here and

71
00:04:36.974 --> 00:04:41.143
there is absolutely no rhyme or reason or

72
00:04:41.143 --> 00:04:46.660
really much of a control
mechanism to vet any of this or

73
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.444
make sure that people aren't
doing malicious things.

74
00:04:52.444 --> 00:04:56.213
So when we're installing
stuff from the NPM registry,

75
00:04:56.213 --> 00:05:01.022
the registry is sort of like, these
are all the packages I know about and

76
00:05:01.022 --> 00:05:05.457
there are some custom ones, but
that's details you can look up.

77
00:05:05.457 --> 00:05:10.194
This NPMjs.com collection is
something we wanna really take with

78
00:05:10.194 --> 00:05:15.281
a grain of salt because it's just
code from strangers on the Internet.

79
00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:20.279
So we wanna be cautious whenever
we're using packages from here in our

80
00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:23.412
code because we don't know, like we said,

81
00:05:23.412 --> 00:05:28.257
JavaScript lets you do all kinds
of things out from underneath you.

82
00:05:28.257 --> 00:05:32.755
So word to the wise,
just keep in mind grain of salt.
