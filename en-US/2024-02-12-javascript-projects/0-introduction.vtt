00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.636
Hello and welcome, everyone,
to a JavaScript adventure

2
00:00:05.636 --> 00:00:10.100
that I hope proves fun and
fruitful for all of us.

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.183
My name is Anjana Vakil.

4
00:00:12.183 --> 00:00:19.334
And I hope we're all excited to be here,
to not just talk about some features and

5
00:00:19.334 --> 00:00:24.355
tools and
ecosystems related to the day-to-day lives

6
00:00:24.355 --> 00:00:29.293
of what we do as professional
JavaScript developers.

7
00:00:29.293 --> 00:00:34.169
But also to put those into
practice with some hands-on

8
00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:39.045
projects that we are going
to work through together and

9
00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:43.815
build up into a project that
I hope everyone is going to

10
00:00:43.815 --> 00:00:48.813
be able to take on and
keep working on after this course.

11
00:00:48.813 --> 00:00:53.599
So thank you all so much for
joining me for this.

12
00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:59.157
There is a little site up at
anjana.dev/professional-javascript

13
00:00:59.157 --> 00:01:04.428
where you can find these slides and
all of the links to the different

14
00:01:04.428 --> 00:01:09.511
projects we're gonna be working on,
and all of the resources,

15
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:15.845
and many, many gifts that I will be
showing you [LAUGH] throughout the course.

16
00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:19.172
And why don't we take a moment
to set ourselves up for

17
00:01:19.172 --> 00:01:23.708
success by wrapping our heads around
what we're gonna be looking at and

18
00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:28.633
thinking about during the course, and
where we're gonna take it from here.

19
00:01:30.273 --> 00:01:34.971
So this is intended to essentially be
a follow on to another course I had done

20
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:38.753
called JavaScript First Steps
to Professional.

21
00:01:38.753 --> 00:01:43.739
So we do all work from the assumption
that we have taken that course,

22
00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:48.246
we are familiar with the concepts
covered in that course.

23
00:01:48.246 --> 00:01:53.376
However, if you haven't, that'll be there,
we can go back as we need to.

24
00:01:53.376 --> 00:01:58.441
But essentially, if that course
focused more on some of the basic

25
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:04.818
language features and concepts and
mental models that we need for JavaScript.

26
00:02:04.818 --> 00:02:08.714
The hope for this course, the aim for

27
00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:13.994
our hands on adventure here
is to start moving from

28
00:02:13.994 --> 00:02:19.148
the theoretical in a nice
little tidy artificial

29
00:02:19.148 --> 00:02:25.813
classroom environment of writing
small JavaScript exercises

30
00:02:25.813 --> 00:02:31.741
into the wide weird world of
real world JS development.

31
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:35.925
And that world is very large and
in charge.

32
00:02:35.925 --> 00:02:40.106
So this is not by any means
a comprehensive overview of everything

33
00:02:40.106 --> 00:02:44.819
there is to know about being
a professional level JavaScript developer,

34
00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.325
by no stretch of the imagination.

35
00:02:47.325 --> 00:02:52.638
It is, however, another step forward,
hopefully, into the continuous,

36
00:02:52.638 --> 00:02:57.623
infinite journey that we all have in
front of us of learning JavaScript,

37
00:02:57.623 --> 00:03:01.323
because JavaScript is
a living breathing language.

38
00:03:01.323 --> 00:03:05.466
It is evolving as we learn it.

39
00:03:05.466 --> 00:03:09.397
So there is always something new to learn,
always something new to discover.

40
00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:12.279
And we are focusing here on
trying to move forward and

41
00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:14.714
not necessarily get to an end destination.

42
00:03:14.714 --> 00:03:18.719
It's the journey, not the destination.

43
00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:26.153
So the plan is we are going to
approach this journey in three parts.

44
00:03:26.153 --> 00:03:30.657
So in the first part of the course, we're
gonna talk about some more features of

45
00:03:30.657 --> 00:03:34.154
JavaScript as a language that
are a little bit more advanced,

46
00:03:34.154 --> 00:03:38.951
perhaps a little bit more complex, than
some of the things that we've seen before.

47
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:45.262
We'll also be doing some review of some
of the concepts that we have seen and

48
00:03:45.262 --> 00:03:49.683
worked with, but
perhaps just want a refresher on.

49
00:03:49.683 --> 00:03:53.274
But some of the new things that
we're going to be talking about,

50
00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:56.482
if you haven't explored these
very much in JavaScript.

51
00:03:56.482 --> 00:04:01.130
Are, for example, how does
JavaScript approach writing programs

52
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.985
in different paradigms of programming,

53
00:04:03.985 --> 00:04:08.811
like functional programming, and
object-oriented programming?

54
00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:13.557
What are some of the conveniences and
features of the language

55
00:04:13.557 --> 00:04:17.854
that we can use to write code
in those different styles?

56
00:04:17.854 --> 00:04:21.522
And how does that feel,
and how does that work?

57
00:04:21.522 --> 00:04:26.167
We're also gonna, in particular,
be talking a lot about objects.

58
00:04:26.167 --> 00:04:30.136
Because in JavaScript are of
the most important and

59
00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:34.391
are going to be something we
need to get very cozy with.

60
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:39.791
And we're gonna be talking about some
fancy objects that can do special things.

61
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:44.446
And we're gonna be looking at JavaScript,
not just in the sense of

62
00:04:44.446 --> 00:04:49.020
a language with certain syntax and
certain built-in objects and

63
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.343
variables that we can work with, but
also as a language that sits in the heart

64
00:04:54.343 --> 00:04:59.022
of the web browser, when we're
talking about it on the front end.

65
00:04:59.022 --> 00:05:04.886
And what the web browser gives to us in
terms of all of these amazing APIs for

66
00:05:04.886 --> 00:05:09.332
doing things for the user,
with the user's computer,

67
00:05:09.332 --> 00:05:14.537
all of the different wonderful
web capabilities that the browser

68
00:05:14.537 --> 00:05:19.098
exposes to us that we have
access to through JavaScript.

69
00:05:19.098 --> 00:05:23.030
So we're gonna be talking about
some of those browser APIs and

70
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.022
starting to get our feet wet with poking
around the massive ecosystem of things

71
00:05:28.022 --> 00:05:31.065
that we can do with JavaScript and
the browser.

72
00:05:31.065 --> 00:05:31.990
And in part 1,

73
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.923
we're gonna be focusing on projects that
are what I like to think of as quick wins.

74
00:05:36.923 --> 00:05:41.946
So relatively small,
focused on a particular concept or

75
00:05:41.946 --> 00:05:44.468
skill that we are learning.

76
00:05:44.468 --> 00:05:48.800
And we're going to hopefully be
feeling good about getting some things

77
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.613
implemented from the get go.

78
00:05:50.613 --> 00:05:51.923
So that's part 1.

79
00:05:51.923 --> 00:05:56.327
Then as we move into part 2,
we're going to zoom out a little bit.

80
00:05:56.327 --> 00:06:02.214
And we're gonna be thinking not just
about the features of the language and

81
00:06:02.214 --> 00:06:06.605
the browser environment, but
also some of the tools and

82
00:06:06.605 --> 00:06:12.504
tooling that we need to function as
our day-to-day lives as developers.

83
00:06:12.504 --> 00:06:18.120
And not just write code in our browser
console to check whether one value is or

84
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.982
is not equal to another [LAUGH]
value in JavaScript and

85
00:06:21.982 --> 00:06:26.846
things like that, but
also to actually build things for the web.

86
00:06:26.846 --> 00:06:31.619
So we're gonna talk about things like
version control, and Git, and GitHub.

87
00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:33.760
We're gonna talk about NodeJS,

88
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.814
which is a way to run JavaScript out of
the browser in the backend environment.

89
00:06:38.814 --> 00:06:43.004
We're gonna talk about npm and
the JavaScript package,

90
00:06:44.488 --> 00:06:48.302
Situation, [LAUGH] which
there's plenty to say about.

91
00:06:48.302 --> 00:06:52.032
We're also gonna be looking
at a tool called Vite,

92
00:06:52.032 --> 00:06:56.890
which is going to help us start
developing in a workflow that is very

93
00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.692
common to the professional
JavaScript developer's day to day.

94
00:07:01.692 --> 00:07:06.690
And is going to let us move from
the local environment where

95
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.586
we are just writing code on our
own machine to deploying it

96
00:07:11.586 --> 00:07:15.779
to the interwebs for
the rest of the world to see.

97
00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:21.184
And we're gonna be working on
some selfie-related projects,

98
00:07:21.184 --> 00:07:25.097
[LAUGH] moving through
this part of the course.

99
00:07:25.097 --> 00:07:31.625
So I won't give you any spoilers there,
but we will be seeing a lot of memes and

100
00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:36.257
a lot of selfies of Anjana,
so I apologize in advance.

101
00:07:36.257 --> 00:07:39.701
[LAUGH] And then in part 3,
we're really gonna open things up, and

102
00:07:39.701 --> 00:07:43.033
it's gonna start to become more
of a choose your own adventure.

103
00:07:43.033 --> 00:07:49.344
So as we learn these features of
the ecosystem, some of the tools,

104
00:07:49.344 --> 00:07:53.978
we're going to look at
the kind of higher level,

105
00:07:56.426 --> 00:08:00.816
Overwhelm that might ensue from having
a massive language like JavaScript

106
00:08:00.816 --> 00:08:05.690
in terms of its reach, and its community,
and its ecosystem, and all of the things

107
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.822
that we can do with the browser and
on the backend and all of this stuff.

108
00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:14.791
And we're gonna start to choose
our own adventure a little bit,

109
00:08:14.791 --> 00:08:19.759
with taking a given project and
making our own version of it, and

110
00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:23.915
adding new features,
changing the way things work.

111
00:08:23.915 --> 00:08:26.690
And really trying to
make things our own and

112
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.772
start exploring the parts
of web development,

113
00:08:29.772 --> 00:08:34.797
which is a vast universe that we are
excited to learn and excited to play with.

114
00:08:34.797 --> 00:08:39.692
So we're going to be thinking about it
as a little bit more of a hackathon

115
00:08:39.692 --> 00:08:43.863
than a particular exercise
project in part 3 of the course.

116
00:08:43.863 --> 00:08:46.075
So that is the grand plan.

117
00:08:46.075 --> 00:08:48.526
These are some of the main
concepts we're gonna cover.

118
00:08:50.286 --> 00:08:52.755
And in general,
let's keep in mind that we are all,

119
00:08:52.755 --> 00:08:55.001
especially in the web
development community,

120
00:08:55.001 --> 00:08:58.782
coming from different backgrounds,
we have different levels of experience.

121
00:08:58.782 --> 00:09:03.741
Some of us have been working
with computers for decades,

122
00:09:03.741 --> 00:09:08.387
some of us have just gotten
our first jobs in tech, and

123
00:09:08.387 --> 00:09:13.266
we are all welcome and
part of this collective journey.

124
00:09:13.266 --> 00:09:17.976
So there is a spot for
everyone, there is something

125
00:09:17.976 --> 00:09:22.476
everyone can learn and
share with other people.

126
00:09:22.476 --> 00:09:27.076
And the goal here is to focus
on moving forward, again, and

127
00:09:27.076 --> 00:09:32.320
growing our skills and growing our
capabilities to function in this

128
00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:38.313
massive ecosystem of web development,
and not on achieving certain goals.

129
00:09:38.313 --> 00:09:44.510
So the projects will just be a way for us
to start beefing up our JavaScript skills.

130
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.608
And as we go, whatever questions come up,

131
00:09:47.608 --> 00:09:52.177
whatever rabbit holes we wanna dive down,
more than welcome.

132
00:09:52.177 --> 00:09:57.352
This is a journey, like I said, and we're
all gonna be learning from each other,

133
00:09:57.352 --> 00:10:02.002
and hopefully we're gonna end up
somewhere interesting that's further

134
00:10:02.002 --> 00:10:04.630
along in our journey than we started out.
