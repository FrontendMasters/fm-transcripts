00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.470
That brings us to our next quick win,
which is to build a random clock.

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.550
Not as random as this gif, which I found
on the interwebs, but can we all take

3
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.200
a moment to appreciate that this
happened at some point in human history?

4
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.635
So we're gonna make something
slightly less random, but

5
00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:19.968
with a little randomness going on.

6
00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:27.880
So you may have seen those screen savers
where you've got like, the time showing up

7
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.549
and then it shows up somewhere else,
and then it shows up somewhere else.

8
00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:35.399
And then it shows up somewhere else.

9
00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.274
And it's like the most exciting
screensaver from 1993.

10
00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:43.269
Like, yeah.

11
00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.909
Well, we can do it in 2023 with
just a little bit of JavaScript.

12
00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:54.371
So, okay, in this,
I'm sorry, clock index.html,

13
00:00:54.371 --> 00:01:01.256
there is another little
pre-scaffolded webpage for you.

14
00:01:02.998 --> 00:01:11.138
That is going to do nothing
because we haven't built it yet.

15
00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:15.821
But the idea is we're gonna
turn this beautiful blank field

16
00:01:15.821 --> 00:01:19.109
into the 90 screensaver of our dreams.

17
00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:26.140
By using our friend math.random.

18
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.116
So this is another fun little
thing in the browser that we have.

19
00:01:29.116 --> 00:01:34.131
Math is this built-in object in JavaScript

20
00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:37.930
that has all kinds of fun tricks.

21
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.773
And one of the things it can do,
in addition to giving you constants,

22
00:01:45.773 --> 00:01:51.174
like pi-ish, [LAUGH] is that
we can call math.random and

23
00:01:51.174 --> 00:01:54.789
get a random number between 0 and 1.

24
00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.216
So we can use that, and if we call
it again, we get a different one,

25
00:01:58.216 --> 00:02:00.741
and we call it again, and
we get a different one.

26
00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:05.756
We can use that to essentially
pick random values and then scale

27
00:02:05.756 --> 00:02:11.981
them to a range that we're interested in,
of values that we care about.

28
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:21.115
So in this, so
it's actually clock.index.html.

29
00:02:21.115 --> 00:02:24.215
So, once you kind of get in download,
we've got some.

30
00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:28.001
We've got basically the same kind of
general setup the same style sheet and

31
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:28.730
everything.

32
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.720
We've got a super exciting
web page with like,

33
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.628
basically nothing in it,
except there is this clock div.

34
00:02:37.628 --> 00:02:42.534
And inside of it,
there is a little p element with an id.

35
00:02:42.534 --> 00:02:44.476
I wonder what that could be used for.

36
00:02:44.476 --> 00:02:46.796
So we're going to basically
grab that p element.

37
00:02:48.286 --> 00:02:53.275
Use our magical browser powers to get
the current time as a string cuz not every

38
00:02:53.275 --> 00:02:57.910
person can immediately calculate
from milliseconds since the epoch.

39
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.730
[LAUGH] And
then we're going to set the text

40
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.281
in that paragraph to this time string.

41
00:03:08.281 --> 00:03:14.274
And if you want to have a little fun
with it, randomly position it and

42
00:03:14.274 --> 00:03:20.709
color it by setting a style attribute
with values for things like color.

43
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.411
And top and left, which are offsets
basically from, and this is a positioned

44
00:03:27.411 --> 00:03:33.160
element, so it's gonna be offsets
in this little box that we've got.

45
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.834
And I want that to update every 3 seconds,

46
00:03:35.834 --> 00:03:40.440
because I don't need to know every
second of time, but every 3 seconds is

47
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.004
definitely an appropriate and
normal interval of time to want, right?

48
00:03:45.004 --> 00:03:49.540
So this is your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

49
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.273
is to make a super awesomely
old school clock screensaver.

50
00:03:54.273 --> 00:03:55.325
