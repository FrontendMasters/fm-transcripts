WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.897
So, we're going to now
get some video involved,

2
00:00:04.897 --> 00:00:10.036
and here begins the fun and
the road to selfie magic.

3
00:00:10.036 --> 00:00:18.398
So we also have a method on the context
object that allows us to draw an image and

4
00:00:18.398 --> 00:00:23.041
we can then pass in
a few different things.

5
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:28.216
So let's go see what we
pass in to the draw image,

6
00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:33.789
CanvasRenderingContext 2D,
draw image method.

7
00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:38.073
Another very long page,
okay with some hippos on it, that's fine.

8
00:00:38.073 --> 00:00:41.744
And yeah, there's a whole bunch of
overloads for this method signature, so

9
00:00:41.744 --> 00:00:43.845
there's all kinds of
things we can pass in.

10
00:00:43.845 --> 00:00:47.552
We're just gonna look at this
first one to get us started.

11
00:00:47.552 --> 00:00:54.337
We will pass in an image element to
that we wanna draw onto the Canvas and

12
00:00:54.337 --> 00:00:58.835
this could be all kinds
of image g type things.

13
00:00:58.835 --> 00:01:02.952
We could give it an image,
an image element, we could give it a SVG,

14
00:01:02.952 --> 00:01:06.003
we could give it a video
just what we're gonna do.

15
00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:09.227
We could give it bitmaps,
we can do all kinds of stuff.

16
00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:14.756
But basically we give it
something that the browser knows

17
00:01:14.756 --> 00:01:20.644
how to display as an image on the screen,
and then we give it.

18
00:01:24.704 --> 00:01:29.122
Essentially, this is now telling us
about all these fancy things, but

19
00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:32.446
the d stands for
sort of destination x-coordinate.

20
00:01:32.446 --> 00:01:34.903
So what's the top-left corner?

21
00:01:34.903 --> 00:01:37.874
Where is that gonna go in
the destination canvas?

22
00:01:37.874 --> 00:01:42.178
And the y coordinate is, well, these
two together are the top left corner,

23
00:01:42.178 --> 00:01:42.925
you feel me?

24
00:01:42.925 --> 00:01:48.825
So the idea then is that we can also do
stuff, if we want to only draw a subset of

25
00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:54.102
the image or only draw it to a certain
width from the original image.

26
00:01:54.102 --> 00:01:56.079
There's all kinds of different
settings we can do, but

27
00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.773
right now we're just
gonna draw a whole image.

28
00:01:57.773 --> 00:02:01.793
So we're gonna use this easy,
simplest overload here and

29
00:02:01.793 --> 00:02:06.153
you can read the whole rest of
this long page with hippos later.

30
00:02:06.153 --> 00:02:09.502
Okay, so how are we gonna do that?

31
00:02:09.502 --> 00:02:16.210
So yeah, if we draw, if we call drawImage
with one of these imagey type objects,

32
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.957
imagey type elements,
Canvas will figure it out for us.

33
00:02:20.957 --> 00:02:24.920
Now, anybody know what's
gonna happen when I do this?

34
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.406
&gt;&gt; It doesn't know what video is.

35
00:02:26.406 --> 00:02:27.703
&gt;&gt; Video is not defined.

36
00:02:27.703 --> 00:02:30.609
You know what?
You don't even need to meet and run it,

37
00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.306
we can believe that
this is not gonna work.

38
00:02:33.306 --> 00:02:35.929
Okay, all right, and
we scroll down in the vite logs.

39
00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:39.556
So vite has very helpfully been telling
me each time it reloads the page,

40
00:02:39.556 --> 00:02:44.241
like index changed, source canvas changed,
source canvas changed twice.

41
00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:48.847
Something messed up because you
don't know how to write a path but

42
00:02:48.847 --> 00:02:53.554
all of these things vite is sort of
helpfully telling us as it goes.

43
00:02:53.554 --> 00:03:00.259
So it's constantly running,
watching for our changes.

44
00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:02.081
Okay, so what if we get a video element?

45
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.006
How's that sound?

46
00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:05.168
Should we do that?

47
00:03:05.168 --> 00:03:09.874
Okay, so, and this is where, again,
it starts to become a choose your own

48
00:03:09.874 --> 00:03:13.926
adventure of like, how does it
make sense to organize our code?

49
00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:18.770
So maybe I want to have,
this is a file that kind of,

50
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.590
draw some JavaScript logos,

51
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.804
which isn't necessarily
what I ultimately wanna do.

52
00:03:26.804 --> 00:03:31.588
So maybe I want to actually
start working towards my end

53
00:03:31.588 --> 00:03:36.376
goal of having a camera that
we can then draw data from.

54
00:03:36.376 --> 00:03:41.126
So maybe we want to put this
in a file called, camera or

55
00:03:41.126 --> 00:03:45.043
video, or selfie, JS, whatever we want.

56
00:03:45.043 --> 00:03:48.452
And does everything need to start
with a C in our source directory?

57
00:03:48.452 --> 00:03:51.406
No, it does not,
this is just weird coincidence.

58
00:03:51.406 --> 00:03:54.998
But okay, this was an example of some
of the things we can do with Canvas.

59
00:03:54.998 --> 00:03:59.351
Now we're gonna try to do
the video thing that we wanna do.

60
00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:04.363
So, that means I'm gonna
have to go back and

61
00:04:04.363 --> 00:04:10.599
change my index.html, aha,
remembered this time.

62
00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:17.647
So once I do that, no more JS logo
because nothing's happening in camera.js,

63
00:04:17.647 --> 00:04:21.937
but so we can now start
grabbing some videos stuff.

64
00:04:21.937 --> 00:04:23.782
How's that sound?

65
00:04:23.782 --> 00:04:26.277
Okay, so let's go back up.

66
00:04:29.161 --> 00:04:33.062
So one thing we could do is add
a video element to our page,

67
00:04:33.062 --> 00:04:36.086
that's not the only way
we could play this.

68
00:04:36.086 --> 00:04:43.110
We could also, for example,
create a video element, I don't know.

69
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.578
And does this need to be on
the top level of this module?

70
00:04:48.578 --> 00:04:55.369
Not necessarily, could be in,
let's say a handy dandy,

71
00:04:55.369 --> 00:05:00.220
like get video function, for example and

72
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.208
I can call this, my goodness function,

73
00:05:05.208 --> 00:05:10.211
okay, get video, I'll satisfy syntax.

74
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:15.610
Okay [LAUGH] move all this up,
option up to do all of that.

75
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.569
No, I'm gonna have to await
some stuff in this function,

76
00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:26.965
one of the other things I'm gonna have
to do is actually get the user media.

77
00:05:26.965 --> 00:05:30.835
So I'm gonna want
an asynchronous function here.

78
00:05:30.835 --> 00:05:32.607
Cool?

79
00:05:32.607 --> 00:05:37.919
Now, what's gonna happen
when I run [LAUGH] This?

80
00:05:39.566 --> 00:05:41.503
Anybody see any issues?

81
00:05:41.503 --> 00:05:42.643
What's AVStream?

82
00:05:42.643 --> 00:05:44.364
&gt;&gt; What's AVStream?

83
00:05:44.364 --> 00:05:46.860
Well, I don't know.

84
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.078
Did I save it, no I did not,
okay, no, yes I did, all right.

85
00:05:53.078 --> 00:05:56.103
No, actually this didn't do anything
because this isn't a function and

86
00:05:56.103 --> 00:05:56.895
I never called it.

87
00:05:56.895 --> 00:06:01.649
So, [LAUGH] all right, so
if I do a wait, which, by the way,

88
00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:04.612
I can only do in a JavaScript module.

89
00:06:04.612 --> 00:06:10.266
So only in the type module
do I get top-level await,

90
00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:15.160
another fun little nugget
[LAUGH] of modules.

91
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.460
So I can do await, getVideo, and
maybe I capture that value as,

92
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.760
a video, for example, and semicolons
is a debate we can have another time.

93
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.540
All right, so now I get the expected
error somewhere, please move, okay,

94
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.642
that I don't have an AVI stream.

95
00:06:33.642 --> 00:06:34.339
What are you talking about?

96
00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:37.178
So let's make sure we
grab that user media,

97
00:06:37.178 --> 00:06:40.343
like we said we were gonna
do going further back.

98
00:06:40.343 --> 00:06:43.776
Okay, so we've figured out that we
want to use this navigator thing.

99
00:06:43.776 --> 00:06:48.364
And that this is another reason why
this getvideo is gonna have to be an AY

100
00:06:48.364 --> 00:06:53.498
function because this is an asynchronous
operation, getting the user media.

101
00:06:53.498 --> 00:06:58.626
And you know what I'm
gonna do at this point

102
00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:04.324
is actually just stop doing
the main js stuff for

103
00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:07.608
now, just so we can focus.

104
00:07:07.608 --> 00:07:11.853
Okay, still an error, here we are.

105
00:07:11.853 --> 00:07:17.486
Okay, so now I am basically
just pasting this code in,

106
00:07:17.486 --> 00:07:20.921
letting VS Code format it for me.

107
00:07:20.921 --> 00:07:23.527
We actually don't need the audio if
we just want to take a selfie, so

108
00:07:23.527 --> 00:07:24.867
let's not even worry about that.

109
00:07:24.867 --> 00:07:29.260
Let's only ask for the minimum permissions
that we need and not be like so

110
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.797
many projects out there that just want
access to basically everything your

111
00:07:33.797 --> 00:07:34.890
computer can do.

112
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:39.570
So let's just restrict it to
the minimum viable permissions,

113
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:46.853
which is gonna be video,
And, something happened,

114
00:07:46.853 --> 00:07:53.125
a little box popped up being like
allow this website to use your camera.

115
00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:58.227
Well, I don't know, maybe I'll allow it,

116
00:07:58.227 --> 00:08:01.595
okay, now we have a new book.

117
00:08:01.595 --> 00:08:06.004
A new error, which is that video is null

118
00:08:06.004 --> 00:08:11.226
because I never put a video
element in my HTML.

119
00:08:11.226 --> 00:08:15.059
So when I tried to select for
this video element, no dice.

120
00:08:15.059 --> 00:08:18.925
So what if I do like
create element instead and

121
00:08:18.925 --> 00:08:25.557
make one programmatically with the
phenomenal cosmic powers of my dumb API.

122
00:08:25.557 --> 00:08:28.053
Let's see if that is more helpful,okay.

123
00:08:28.053 --> 00:08:34.810
And you you'll notice that, like, at this
point,since vite is kind of automatically

124
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:40.770
updating what's happening in the page
here, you don't have to reapprove.

125
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:45.522
But if I were to,
let's say open this again in a new tab,

126
00:08:45.522 --> 00:08:50.175
every different run of this
script in the client will be

127
00:08:50.175 --> 00:08:53.632
asking the user for these permissions.

128
00:08:53.632 --> 00:08:57.552
So unless I, as the user, click that
remember, where the browser is just

129
00:08:57.552 --> 00:09:01.094
gonna stop asking me this,
every different user that sees this and

130
00:09:01.094 --> 00:09:05.293
even two different tabs in my device will
be able to make different decisions.

131
00:09:05.293 --> 00:09:08.924
So, question, what do you think
happens if I don't allow it?

132
00:09:12.574 --> 00:09:15.943
Let's find out,
[LAUGH] Okay, so if I block,

133
00:09:15.943 --> 00:09:20.567
heck no, I don't want local host
to have access to my camera.

134
00:09:20.567 --> 00:09:25.580
We get every an exception on this
getuser media function call,

135
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.173
that says,
nope you do not have permission,

136
00:09:29.173 --> 00:09:33.902
you tried to get that user media
the user did not want you to or

137
00:09:33.902 --> 00:09:38.650
the platform or
the browser something didn't want you to.

138
00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:44.699
And so that's the kind of thing that we
would probably in our app want to handle,

139
00:09:44.699 --> 00:09:49.122
let's say with a try catch,
maybe some, like, please,

140
00:09:49.122 --> 00:09:53.578
please, please give me permission module,
no, [LAUGH].

141
00:09:53.578 --> 00:09:58.506
But so just keep in mind that this will
error if it's not able to get that video

142
00:09:58.506 --> 00:10:01.600
because of like a permissions problem,
okay.

143
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.002
And just perhaps useful for
development is you can always kind of,

144
00:10:05.002 --> 00:10:06.520
in your different browsers,

145
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.607
there'll be different ways to sort of
reset your permissions for a given site.

146
00:10:10.607 --> 00:10:14.023
Anyway, okay, so back to our this one,

147
00:10:14.023 --> 00:10:19.050
where we have a whole beautiful
page of nothing happening,

148
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:23.089
amazing, let's go fix that,
shall we [LAUGH]?

149
00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:24.642
Okay, so first of all,

150
00:10:24.642 --> 00:10:29.773
what we said before is that we would all
feel a lot more comfortable if, instead

151
00:10:29.773 --> 00:10:35.094
of main js injecting this massive string
template into the inner HTML of our app.

152
00:10:35.094 --> 00:10:42.122
We just had this in our HTML, so let's
just go ahead and do that for ourselves.

153
00:10:42.122 --> 00:10:47.251
And now we can go to index and we're gonna
have to make some changes to this but

154
00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:50.153
okay, fine, we can leave this outer div.

155
00:10:50.153 --> 00:10:54.228
Now there's some things that
are probably not gonna work here,

156
00:10:54.228 --> 00:10:58.083
for example JavaScript's,
template literal $curlies.

157
00:10:58.083 --> 00:11:02.455
We're not in JavaScript anymore, where
we were inside of a template literal.

158
00:11:02.455 --> 00:11:06.433
So, what we can do,
though, thanks to vite,

159
00:11:06.433 --> 00:11:12.145
is in this HTML file I can reference
things that are public assets or

160
00:11:12.145 --> 00:11:16.939
other kind of recognized
assets that it'll capture for

161
00:11:16.939 --> 00:11:21.633
us if we're importing them
in our modules and things.

162
00:11:21.633 --> 00:11:25.493
For now, I don't know,
let's just pick one of these logos,

163
00:11:25.493 --> 00:11:27.584
let's go with the V logo, okay?

164
00:11:27.584 --> 00:11:31.209
So since vites's logo is
in our public directory,

165
00:11:31.209 --> 00:11:36.283
that means it's just a statically
served file from our server at root.

166
00:11:36.283 --> 00:11:40.764
So the public kinda goes away, that's
just for our organizational purposes.

167
00:11:40.764 --> 00:11:44.514
So what I'll do is, I'll just,
let's forget the JavaScript logo for now,

168
00:11:44.514 --> 00:11:47.007
since we all know that
that's what's happening.

169
00:11:47.007 --> 00:11:51.805
And what we can do is just use source,
vites.svg,

170
00:11:51.805 --> 00:11:56.052
and is there anything
else that won't work?

171
00:11:56.052 --> 00:11:59.633
&gt;&gt; Do you really want
the dot in front of that?

172
00:11:59.633 --> 00:12:03.591
&gt;&gt; Good question,
let's find out, it worked.

173
00:12:03.591 --> 00:12:09.735
I'm not getting the styles though because
those were being imported in my main.

174
00:12:09.735 --> 00:12:14.940
So why don't we go ahead and bring
back main and we could either we could

175
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:21.029
choose to import the Vite logo in here or
whatever but why don't we blow away this,

176
00:12:21.029 --> 00:12:25.195
counter related code and
just import our style for now.

177
00:12:25.195 --> 00:12:31.482
And then in my index, I wanna go back and
re-uncomment this name JS.

178
00:12:31.482 --> 00:12:34.482
Right now I'm loading two
different modules, which may or

179
00:12:34.482 --> 00:12:37.491
may not be what we want, so,
we can look at that in a second.

180
00:12:37.491 --> 00:12:40.467
But at least now I've got some
fancy styles happening and

181
00:12:40.467 --> 00:12:42.701
appearances are half the battle, right?

182
00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:46.838
And okay, my counter button is
quite sad because I deleted

183
00:12:46.838 --> 00:12:50.554
all the code that filled it
in with useful stuff, but

184
00:12:50.554 --> 00:12:55.640
that's okay because we're not super
interested in a counter button.

185
00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:02.825
We're perhaps more interested in, let's
say, Take Selfie button, for example.

186
00:13:02.825 --> 00:13:09.659
So we're just assuming success and being
the button we want to see in the world,

187
00:13:09.659 --> 00:13:14.356
and you know what,
I'm gonna do this for fun, [LAUGH].

188
00:13:14.356 --> 00:13:20.463
So now we're starting to get towards our
selfie app, where it's gonna say hello,

189
00:13:20.463 --> 00:13:25.973
you [LAUGH] and eventually, hopefully
we'll make this button do someday.
