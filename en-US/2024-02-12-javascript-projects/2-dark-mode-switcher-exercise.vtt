00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.311
How about we, stretch our
muscles a little bit with, well,

2
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:11.363
physically, if we can, and also,
mentally, with a little quick win,

3
00:00:11.363 --> 00:00:17.100
and just imagine a GIF of Darth Vader
[LAUGH] emerging from some fog.

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.432
This is a very exciting webpage.

5
00:00:21.432 --> 00:00:26.795
Web application [LAUGH] where
we have a little toggle,

6
00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:30.499
and is it even a website in 2023?

7
00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.470
If it doesn't support dark mode and
light mode, right?

8
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.679
No, we now have to have dark mode for
everything.

9
00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:39.169
So let's start there.

10
00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:40.729
This is the number one skill for

11
00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:44.546
professional JavaScript developers
implementing dark mode.

12
00:00:44.546 --> 00:00:46.436
All right, so we've got a little toggle.

13
00:00:46.436 --> 00:00:51.346
We've got a very excited Darth Vader,
because, obviously,

14
00:00:51.346 --> 00:00:53.856
his browser is set to dark mode.

15
00:00:55.726 --> 00:00:58.640
And we have a toggle that does nothing.

16
00:00:59.847 --> 00:01:02.512
Your job is to fix it.

17
00:01:02.512 --> 00:01:06.405
So, if you download this page,

18
00:01:06.405 --> 00:01:13.854
which is at
professional.javascript.darkmode.index.-

19
00:01:13.854 --> 00:01:18.525
html you will be able to poke around and

20
00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:24.459
see what is going on in
this very simple web app.

21
00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.989
It's a tiny, we'll call it a webpage.

22
00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:30.849
But it is an interactive, well not yet,
but will be interactive webpage.

23
00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:37.030
So if you save page as, you can save
it as whatever name you'd like and

24
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.308
open it in your favorite
text editor of choice.

25
00:01:41.308 --> 00:01:49.203
Okay, so in VS Code, this is roughly
what [LAUGH] this page should look like.

26
00:01:49.203 --> 00:01:53.366
If yours looks slightly different,
that is because of things that we're gonna

27
00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:55.975
talk about when we talk
about developer tooling,

28
00:01:55.975 --> 00:01:57.855
namely a little thing called beat.

29
00:01:57.855 --> 00:02:05.855
But essentially, you should be
experiencing a similar webpage.

30
00:02:05.855 --> 00:02:08.325
So we've got some stuff going on.

31
00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:12.259
We got some style sheets up there that are
just essentially adding some nice default

32
00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:13.225
styles to the page.

33
00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:18.218
We've got a pretty simple document
that as you saw doesn't really

34
00:02:18.218 --> 00:02:20.990
give us a lot to work with on the page.

35
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.126
But it has a very fancy header and
a nav element with one thing

36
00:02:26.126 --> 00:02:31.880
you can click on which is an input,
a checkbox input that basically

37
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.427
is styled to look like styled to
look like a toggle switch on off,

38
00:02:37.427 --> 00:02:41.334
but Checkboxes
are the appropriate input for

39
00:02:41.334 --> 00:02:45.386
something where it's either on or
it's off.

40
00:02:45.386 --> 00:02:48.098
So the question is,
is dark mode on or not?

41
00:02:48.098 --> 00:02:54.009
Now the fancy style that I
mentioned is being applied

42
00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:59.246
here also reads a custom
System attribute on,

43
00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:03.677
well, on any element, but right now,

44
00:03:03.677 --> 00:03:10.682
it's set on the main HTML element
that's called data theme.

45
00:03:10.682 --> 00:03:15.784
So data-attributes,
have folks run into these before?

46
00:03:15.784 --> 00:03:16.435
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

47
00:03:16.435 --> 00:03:21.386
&gt;&gt; Yeah, where do you
typically run into these, yeah

48
00:03:21.386 --> 00:03:22.259
&gt;&gt; Testing.

49
00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:23.561
&gt;&gt; Testing, okay.

50
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:28.661
So these are often used by all kinds
of different tools and libraries and

51
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:34.271
things like that as a way to essentially
let HTML elements kind of remember some

52
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:40.397
data that the browser doesn't care about
because these are just made up attributes.

53
00:03:40.397 --> 00:03:43.164
It's a convention to call them data minus,
and

54
00:03:43.164 --> 00:03:46.841
then whatever the piece of data
is that you're interested in.

55
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:50.243
But for example, it's quite easy
to read them in JavaScript and

56
00:03:50.243 --> 00:03:51.757
then do stuff accordingly.

57
00:03:51.757 --> 00:03:57.297
So the stylesheet that we've got
basically reads that data theme and

58
00:03:57.297 --> 00:04:02.836
applies the styling of her appropriately,
this is not a CSS class and

59
00:04:02.836 --> 00:04:07.767
you definitely wouldn't
want to take one from me.

60
00:04:07.767 --> 00:04:11.783
So this is we're just gonna let
somebody else handle that and

61
00:04:11.783 --> 00:04:15.687
who is handling that is
a little tool called Pico CSS.

62
00:04:15.687 --> 00:04:20.367
So, if you want to look that up, you can
find the stylesheet that we're using.

63
00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:25.428
Okay, so Pico CSS basically puts
everything that we've got in

64
00:04:25.428 --> 00:04:31.417
this page in dark mode because we
have this data theme equals dark.

65
00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:38.577
So there's also a data theme equals
light option that can change things.

66
00:04:38.577 --> 00:04:45.279
And if I were to just, Change that here,

67
00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:49.673
the whole page would turn
into something different.

68
00:04:49.673 --> 00:04:56.259
And let me do that in my browser here to
show you a little what it looks like.

69
00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.339
So, yay browser DevTools!

70
00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:01.159
I can just edit this page.

71
00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:02.499
Should live in the browser.

72
00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:08.509
Anybody else do this to mess with those
really annoying gatekeeping overlays?

73
00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.029
No, just me, okay.

74
00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:11.529
Now yes, we all do, right?

75
00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:15.937
So and if anybody is just needs a
refresher on how I got to this interface,

76
00:05:15.937 --> 00:05:19.190
which again is the same as what we use for
the console,

77
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.902
we're just in the inspector Tab
instead of the console tab.

78
00:05:22.902 --> 00:05:26.685
It's basically there should be
a right click and then inspect or

79
00:05:26.685 --> 00:05:31.776
Inspect Element option depending on your
browser but inspect will get you there.

80
00:05:31.776 --> 00:05:36.400
Okay, so if I change this to light, so

81
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.597
we've got now glaringly bright.

82
00:05:42.878 --> 00:05:47.594
Seen and there's a fun little bit
of CSS in there that swapping out

83
00:05:47.594 --> 00:05:52.823
the background image to so that we get
to see the light side of the force and

84
00:05:52.823 --> 00:05:55.428
not just stuffy old data.

85
00:05:55.428 --> 00:05:59.860
Okay, so your mission should you choose to
accept it is to do what I just did using

86
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.668
JavaScript.

87
00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:07.063
And in order to do that,
you're probably going to want to grab that

88
00:06:07.063 --> 00:06:12.049
HTML element somehow,
check on that data-theme attribute.

89
00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:14.609
There is that checkbox.

90
00:06:14.609 --> 00:06:19.321
There's a little handy-dandy
ID tag on it called toggle

91
00:06:19.321 --> 00:06:23.933
that you can use to find that and
set up an event handler,

92
00:06:23.933 --> 00:06:27.683
[LAUGH] otherwise known
as an event listener.

93
00:06:27.683 --> 00:06:31.208
[LAUGH] Onto that check box to
change the theme based on whether

94
00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:32.527
it's checked or not.
