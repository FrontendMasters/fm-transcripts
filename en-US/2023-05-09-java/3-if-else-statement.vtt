00:00:00.643 --> 00:00:05.196
All right let's talk about
more decision structures.

2
00:00:05.196 --> 00:00:08.927
So there's also the if-else statement.

3
00:00:08.927 --> 00:00:13.445
So if a certain condition occurs,
you do something, otherwise,

4
00:00:13.445 --> 00:00:15.069
you do something else.

5
00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:22.210
So it's two possible paths that can
happen based on a condition, all right?

6
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.906
So we'll write another program.

7
00:00:24.906 --> 00:00:27.122
This one is a quota calculator.

8
00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:32.474
So all salespeople are expected to
make at least 10 sales each week.

9
00:00:32.474 --> 00:00:36.761
For those who do,
they receive a congratulatory message.

10
00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:45.075
For those who don't, they're informed of
how many sales they were short, all right?

11
00:00:45.075 --> 00:00:46.005
Let's code it up.

12
00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.840
So we'll close this one,
go back to our decision structure package,

13
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.926
and we'll create another class here.

14
00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:02.658
We'll call this one quota calculator.

15
00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.693
So let's create our main method.

16
00:01:09.693 --> 00:01:13.110
We're going to ask for some input.

17
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.454
So, well, before we ask for
the input, what do we already know?

18
00:01:19.776 --> 00:01:23.225
The quota needs to be what?

19
00:01:23.225 --> 00:01:25.882
10, right?

20
00:01:25.882 --> 00:01:27.950
So let's go ahead and declare that.

21
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.414
And then we'll ask them how many sales,
right?

22
00:01:39.288 --> 00:01:43.439
We'll read that in with the scanner.

23
00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:50.132
You're getting good with the scanner?

24
00:01:50.132 --> 00:01:55.720
Should be, and then we will,
we forgot to close

25
00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.678
our scanner in our last program,
didn't we?

26
00:02:00.678 --> 00:02:06.317
So what I like to do is go ahead and
do it right away so I don't forget.

27
00:02:06.317 --> 00:02:09.333
And then go back to whatever code I want,
all right.

28
00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:14.173
So we've opened the scanner and
we want to read in the number of sales.

29
00:02:14.173 --> 00:02:19.948
So we'll say,
int sales = scanner.nextInt().

30
00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:26.111
All right, and now our close is good.

31
00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:31.094
Okay, so we've said,
if they did at least 10, right,

32
00:02:31.094 --> 00:02:35.082
we would give them
a congratulatory message.

33
00:02:35.082 --> 00:02:39.795
If not, we would let them know
that they didn't [LAUGH] do

34
00:02:39.795 --> 00:02:42.514
what they needed to do, right?

35
00:02:42.514 --> 00:02:46.483
So we're gonna set this
up with the FL structure,

36
00:02:46.483 --> 00:02:51.789
because that's two different
things that need to occur, right?

37
00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:55.808
So we say if, we put our condition here,

38
00:02:55.808 --> 00:03:02.087
which is sales is greater than or
equal to, right, the quota.

39
00:03:06.244 --> 00:03:08.645
Put a set of curly braces here.

40
00:03:08.645 --> 00:03:13.669
If this happens, we want to let
them know that they did a good job.

41
00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:15.221
So congrats!

42
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:21.753
You've met your quota.

43
00:03:21.753 --> 00:03:28.013
Otherwise, so
you specify otherwise with an else.

44
00:03:28.013 --> 00:03:31.802
The else doesn't need
parentheses in a condition,

45
00:03:31.802 --> 00:03:36.896
because the one condition applies
to both of these branches, right?

46
00:03:36.896 --> 00:03:40.694
So we just say else with
a set of curly braces.

47
00:03:40.694 --> 00:03:45.129
So if this condition is true,
it'll go inside of the if.

48
00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.258
If it's not true,
it'll go inside of the else.

49
00:03:48.258 --> 00:03:54.748
And here we'll go ahead and print,
you did not make your quota.

50
00:03:54.748 --> 00:03:57.540
Now our instructions also said,

51
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.933
to let them know how much
they came up short, right?

52
00:04:01.933 --> 00:04:07.234
So we can do a little calculation
before we print this out and

53
00:04:07.234 --> 00:04:09.469
say how short they were.

54
00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.272
So we can say,

55
00:04:12.272 --> 00:04:19.056
int salesShort = quota- sales.

56
00:04:19.056 --> 00:04:21.605
And we can add this here.

57
00:04:34.087 --> 00:04:38.725
You were,
now I'm adding this inside of a sentence,

58
00:04:38.725 --> 00:04:43.064
before, we've only appended
it to the very end.

59
00:04:43.064 --> 00:04:44.833
So there's a couple of ways to do this.

60
00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:50.603
The most straightforward way is
using the plus sign mid-sentence,

61
00:04:50.603 --> 00:04:53.295
and then saying, salesShort.

62
00:04:53.295 --> 00:04:55.202
So that's the variable.

63
00:04:55.202 --> 00:04:59.674
And then add in another plus
sign in finishing the sentence.

64
00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:05.410
So you wanna put spaces before and
after that within your quotes.

65
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.823
Sales short, all right.

66
00:05:10.823 --> 00:05:12.034
I think we're good to go here.

67
00:05:14.432 --> 00:05:16.992
Questions before we run?

68
00:05:16.992 --> 00:05:18.600
All right, let's run it.

69
00:05:24.847 --> 00:05:31.495
So let's do one that is under 10.

70
00:05:31.495 --> 00:05:35.798
Tell us, great, you didn't make it,
you were 1 sale short.

71
00:05:35.798 --> 00:05:38.644
Let's run again.

72
00:05:38.644 --> 00:05:43.113
This time we'll do right at 10.

73
00:05:43.113 --> 00:05:45.293
Congrats, you've met your quota.

74
00:05:45.293 --> 00:05:49.218
Let's do above 10.

75
00:05:49.218 --> 00:05:51.187
Great, you've met the quota.
