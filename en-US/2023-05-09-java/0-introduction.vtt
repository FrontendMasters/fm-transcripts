Hello everyone and
welcome to Java fundamentals.

2
00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.881
Java is one of the most popular
programming languages in the world,

3
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:12.080
especially for enterprise applications.

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.367
So you're making a good investment
by learning this today.

5
00:00:16.367 --> 00:00:21.297
I am Angie Jones,
I am certified Java programmer.

6
00:00:21.297 --> 00:00:27.798
I've been coding in Java since its
very early days over 20 years now.

7
00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:32.589
And I've taught many workshops and
courses and

8
00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:37.268
even classes at
the collegiate level in Java.

9
00:00:37.268 --> 00:00:39.674
And I am also a Java champion.

10
00:00:39.674 --> 00:00:42.706
So this should be fun, right?

11
00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:45.371
All right, so
we wanna go ahead and get set up.

12
00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:48.968
If you haven't already, install IntelliJ,

13
00:00:48.968 --> 00:00:53.498
the community edition, and
let me show you where that is.

14
00:00:53.498 --> 00:00:59.328
So you're gonna go to
jetbrains.com/idea/download.

15
00:00:59.328 --> 00:01:03.867
And you'll see three operating system
choices, Windows, Mac, or Linux.

16
00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:05.986
Choose your operating system,

17
00:01:05.986 --> 00:01:09.915
in this community edition is
the free open source version.

18
00:01:09.915 --> 00:01:11.970
So that's the one you wanna download.

19
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.907
If you already have IntelliJ Ultimate,
or you wanna use a different IDE,

20
00:01:17.907 --> 00:01:23.958
Eclipse, or VS Code or anything like that,
that's totally fine, okay?

21
00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.928
But this is what we'll be using today.

22
00:01:29.937 --> 00:01:34.767
After you download that,
go ahead and run the installer.

23
00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:37.034
It's pretty quick to install.

24
00:01:37.034 --> 00:01:40.850
And then I'm gonna go inside of here, so

25
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.816
I've already installed it,
I'm gonna say I want a new project

26
00:01:49.626 --> 00:01:55.142
And the type, we're gonna choose is Maven,
so we're gonna do a Maven project.

27
00:01:57.752 --> 00:02:02.567
And there's a little prompt up top
to create a general Maven project.

28
00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:04.283
Go to the New Project page.

29
00:02:04.283 --> 00:02:10.111
Has less options, so I'm just gonna
go there, makes my life easier.

30
00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:14.416
And let's go ahead and make a new project.

31
00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:21.977
You can call this whatever you wanna
call it, I'll just call it java_course.

32
00:02:21.977 --> 00:02:26.732
And you can put this anywhere
you want on your computer, so

33
00:02:26.732 --> 00:02:29.752
I'll just say frontend_masters.

34
00:02:29.752 --> 00:02:31.308
That's my location.

35
00:02:33.523 --> 00:02:36.519
You don't have to click
this Create Git repository.

36
00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.671
I will because I'll go ahead and

37
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:43.944
commit any changes that I'm doing in
the course so that you can download them.

38
00:02:45.194 --> 00:02:49.835
And you want your Language to be Java,

39
00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:53.171
Build system, Maven, for

40
00:02:53.171 --> 00:02:57.825
the JDK, you want Java 17 or later.

41
00:02:57.825 --> 00:03:01.218
I already have openjdk-17.

42
00:03:01.218 --> 00:03:05.208
If you don't have something that's 17 or
later,

43
00:03:05.208 --> 00:03:08.754
you can just choose this
Download JDK option.

44
00:03:10.021 --> 00:03:13.232
And then that'll show you
a bunch of different options.

45
00:03:13.232 --> 00:03:16.814
I recommend the Oracle OpenJDK.

46
00:03:16.814 --> 00:03:19.723
So that's the open source version of Java.

47
00:03:19.723 --> 00:03:23.087
Again, I'm gonna use 17, but

48
00:03:23.087 --> 00:03:27.422
you can use anything 17 or later, okay?

49
00:03:27.422 --> 00:03:28.997
And we'll just say Create.
