00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.856
So sometimes you're gonna find yourself
needing to flag errors within the code

2
00:00:04.856 --> 00:00:06.386
that you write, right?

3
00:00:06.386 --> 00:00:09.579
And you can do this by
throwing exceptions yourself.

4
00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:11.953
So I'm gonna teach you how to do that.

5
00:00:11.953 --> 00:00:16.148
We're gonna write a method that
calculates an employee's pay, but

6
00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:17.893
it does not allow overtime.

7
00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:22.758
So remember, we wrote something
like this very early on and

8
00:00:22.758 --> 00:00:28.208
we did a while loop right to input
validate the input well now we're

9
00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:33.391
a little bit more mature we can
throw an exception if we want to.

10
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:38.138
All right, so let's go ahead and
make a new class.

11
00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:44.824
And we'll call this one,
ThrowingExceptions.

12
00:00:57.772 --> 00:01:02.056
All right, inside of this class.

13
00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:07.260
Let's do a public static void,

14
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.541
not void, double.

15
00:01:10.541 --> 00:01:16.716
And we'll call this method calculatePay.

16
00:01:16.716 --> 00:01:20.967
And this method will accept hours,

17
00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:25.084
and it'll also accept a pay rate.

18
00:01:28.228 --> 00:01:30.514
Okay.

19
00:01:30.514 --> 00:01:35.189
And we want to say that this
method also throws an exception.

20
00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.311
So to do that, after the parameter list,
you would write the word throws and

21
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:44.672
then what exception do you want to throw?

22
00:01:44.672 --> 00:01:50.141
So for this one we want to throw negative

23
00:01:50.141 --> 00:01:55.955
input exception, which does not exist.

24
00:01:55.955 --> 00:01:59.776
So I'll also teach you how
to create an exception.

25
00:01:59.776 --> 00:02:03.735
So Java has a bunch of exceptions
that you can pull from,

26
00:02:03.735 --> 00:02:07.706
if none of them meet your needs,
you can write your own.

27
00:02:07.706 --> 00:02:10.271
&gt;&gt; You just like extend
the overall exception class.

28
00:02:10.271 --> 00:02:12.168
&gt;&gt; Let's see.

29
00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:20.419
All right, so inside of here,
let's go ahead and

30
00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:25.051
should we create the exception first.

31
00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:30.538
All right, I'm gonna put this here so
that everybody can see it better.

32
00:02:30.538 --> 00:02:33.841
All right, so
we got this negative input exception.

33
00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:38.242
It's basically just a class, so
let's go back to our exceptions.

34
00:02:38.242 --> 00:02:44.177
We're gonna make a new class,
give it a name.

35
00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:52.207
And then yes,
you are just going to inherit from

36
00:02:52.207 --> 00:02:57.612
exception because you get
a lot of good free stuff,

37
00:02:57.612 --> 00:03:00.518
right out the box, right?

38
00:03:00.518 --> 00:03:04.106
And all I would really need,
like that get message and

39
00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:08.013
all of that stuff will just
automatically be here for you so

40
00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:12.981
you don't have to like re-implement
all of that stuff, which is great.

41
00:03:12.981 --> 00:03:17.906
The only thing you really need
to add here is a couple of

42
00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:23.707
constructors that provides like a cause or
the message right so

43
00:03:23.707 --> 00:03:27.992
we're gonna provide a default constructor.

44
00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:36.220
Just so people have that,

45
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.254
this is a be a good example to
show you something else and

46
00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:47.833
then let's create another one that
allows people to give us a message.

47
00:03:47.833 --> 00:03:50.857
&gt;&gt; So it's this overloading the first one.

48
00:03:55.461 --> 00:03:57.630
&gt;&gt; Well I guess technically but

49
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.514
they aren't methods constructors
aren't methods but technically, yes.

50
00:04:03.514 --> 00:04:09.483
All right, so what I wanna do with
this one I wanna call my super,

51
00:04:09.483 --> 00:04:11.925
which is who's my super?

52
00:04:11.925 --> 00:04:12.605
&gt;&gt; Exception-.

53
00:04:12.605 --> 00:04:19.429
&gt;&gt; Exception is my super, and I wanna
give it the message that was given to me.

54
00:04:19.429 --> 00:04:24.725
All right, so that'll call the constructor
from exception that accepts a string.

55
00:04:24.725 --> 00:04:28.052
And then in my default one,
we don't gotta get too jazzy.

56
00:04:28.052 --> 00:04:34.227
I'm gonna call this And
I'm gonna give it my own message.

57
00:04:34.227 --> 00:04:38.395
So if they called me without a message,
I better make a message up.

58
00:04:38.395 --> 00:04:45.395
So I'm gonna say input must be
greater than or equal to 0.

59
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.851
What is this doing?

60
00:04:50.851 --> 00:04:52.263
Anyone?

61
00:04:56.622 --> 00:05:00.650
&gt;&gt; Calling the default
constructor of exception?

62
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.872
&gt;&gt; No.

63
00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:08.939
&gt;&gt; The specific exception object for
the negative input exception?

64
00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:10.510
&gt;&gt; Say it one more time.

65
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.333
&gt;&gt; Well, it's like we were messing
with those gutters and centers.

66
00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:17.747
We had this dot where it's
referring to the specific object

67
00:05:17.747 --> 00:05:22.267
of whatever you're talking about in
this case, a negative input exception.

68
00:05:22.267 --> 00:05:23.222
&gt;&gt; All right.

69
00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:24.549
Say it plain.

70
00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:25.210
&gt;&gt; It is.

71
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.343
I don't know how to say it.

72
00:05:26.343 --> 00:05:30.716
&gt;&gt; Tell me when I call this,
where am I going?

73
00:05:30.716 --> 00:05:32.430
Go on.

74
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.067
&gt;&gt; Line nine.

75
00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:38.163
&gt;&gt; I am going to line nine,
okay, very good.

76
00:05:38.163 --> 00:05:42.072
So, when I caled this with those,
I could say dot, right,

77
00:05:42.072 --> 00:05:46.469
remember we always talked about this,
this refers to this class.

78
00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:51.534
So, when i call this dot I'm saying okay
this dot and then any of its fields or

79
00:05:51.534 --> 00:05:57.174
methods or whatever when I say this with
parentheses I'm calling the constructor.

80
00:05:57.174 --> 00:06:01.823
And specifically whatever constructor
matches the argument that I'm sending so

81
00:06:01.823 --> 00:06:06.016
I gave it a string it must be calling
this constructor that takes a string.

82
00:06:06.016 --> 00:06:11.475
So instead of me like not
providing this one right

83
00:06:11.475 --> 00:06:16.669
I could have just provided
the other one I think

84
00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:21.474
that will work just fine let me see, yeah.

85
00:06:21.474 --> 00:06:27.929
&gt;&gt; But then anyone who no It doesn't
like because I didn't never mind.

86
00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:33.335
So here, I think I just have
an exception because I didn't throw it.

87
00:06:33.335 --> 00:06:35.737
Yeah, I don't have a return
statement with something like that.

88
00:06:35.737 --> 00:06:40.047
So I don't need this here,
but it's a great way for

89
00:06:40.047 --> 00:06:43.767
me to provide a message by default, Right?

90
00:06:43.767 --> 00:06:50.037
And I could have just
called super with this.

91
00:06:50.037 --> 00:06:52.475
That's another way I could have done this.

92
00:06:52.475 --> 00:06:56.376
I could have just said, super, right?

93
00:06:56.376 --> 00:06:59.408
But, that's kinda what I'm doing here/.

94
00:06:59.408 --> 00:07:05.460
So I want to just say call my
thing that calls the thing.

95
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:11.549
Just in case this ever gets updated to
do more than the super I got that cover.

96
00:07:11.549 --> 00:07:16.949
Now so I just wanted to flex and show you
a couple of different ways to do stuff.

97
00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:20.644
All right, so back to,
we have our exception.

98
00:07:20.644 --> 00:07:25.048
Well look at that little icon,
that means exception class.

99
00:07:25.048 --> 00:07:27.094
Wow, that's fancy.

100
00:07:27.094 --> 00:07:28.443
Y'all see?

101
00:07:28.443 --> 00:07:32.502
Okay, all right IntelliJ.

102
00:07:32.502 --> 00:07:40.267
All right so inside of our
calculatePay let's go ahead and

103
00:07:40.267 --> 00:07:45.178
we're going to say all right if hours

104
00:07:45.178 --> 00:07:50.091
is greater than 40 right that means

105
00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:56.608
the overtime then we want
to throw an exception.

106
00:07:56.608 --> 00:07:58.439
How do we throw exceptions?

107
00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:00.100
Throw?

108
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.067
We use the word throw.

109
00:08:02.067 --> 00:08:06.401
We say new and we call whatever
exception constructor we want,

110
00:08:06.401 --> 00:08:08.378
negative input exception.

111
00:08:08.378 --> 00:08:13.529
So here I have two options,
I could give it a specific message or

112
00:08:13.529 --> 00:08:20.442
I can just use the default constructor and
that already provided a message, right?

113
00:08:20.442 --> 00:08:24.440
&gt;&gt; What was the message you used on the
initial exception that you wrote again?

114
00:08:26.623 --> 00:08:30.967
&gt;&gt; I see Input must be greater than.

115
00:08:30.967 --> 00:08:34.024
&gt;&gt; So then you would want a new message
because that's not what's going on there.

116
00:08:34.024 --> 00:08:35.826
&gt;&gt; Here, that's right.

117
00:08:35.826 --> 00:08:40.040
So I actually want to throw
a different kind of exception.

118
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:45.529
So I want to show you all how you can do
multiple, like you can throw multiple

119
00:08:45.529 --> 00:08:50.941
exceptions from like the same class
&gt;&gt; Over time violation exception maybe.

120
00:08:50.941 --> 00:08:56.333
&gt;&gt; I'm gonna use one that's already in
Java so we don't have to create another

121
00:08:56.333 --> 00:09:01.742
one but I can say like, illegal argument
exception or something like that.

122
00:09:01.742 --> 00:09:04.677
There's so
many exceptions you can choose from you.

123
00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:08.063
&gt;&gt; So I could do something like that and
then I could change the messaging.

124
00:09:08.063 --> 00:09:11.727
So again, that's why you have one that
allows people to put the message.

125
00:09:11.727 --> 00:09:16.893
So I could put something
that's really specific

126
00:09:16.893 --> 00:09:21.933
to my case,
such as like ours must be less than or

127
00:09:21.933 --> 00:09:26.226
equal to 40 less than or equal to 40.

128
00:09:29.864 --> 00:09:36.180
Okay, so that'll call one of
Java's built-in exceptions.

129
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.449
And the illegal argument
exception is a runtime exception,

130
00:09:40.449 --> 00:09:43.640
which means that it is
unchecked exception.

131
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:48.981
So even though I am throwing this
method from throwing this exception

132
00:09:48.981 --> 00:09:54.241
from this method, I do not have to
declare that in my method header.

133
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:59.766
All right, so okay,
if the hours is greater than 40,

134
00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:02.141
we wanna throw that exception.

135
00:10:02.141 --> 00:10:09.488
Let's say else if
the hours is less than 0 or

136
00:10:09.488 --> 00:10:15.257
the pay rate It's less than zero.

137
00:10:15.257 --> 00:10:17.711
So we got these negative numbers, right?

138
00:10:17.711 --> 00:10:21.414
So that's when we can call
that negative input exception.

139
00:10:21.414 --> 00:10:25.335
So let's say throw new negative input

140
00:10:25.335 --> 00:10:26.591
exception
&gt;&gt; And

141
00:10:26.591 --> 00:10:28.716
that one you could leave
to the default messaging.

142
00:10:28.716 --> 00:10:29.810
&gt;&gt; Yep.

143
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.448
So finally,
if we make it through all of this,

144
00:10:32.448 --> 00:10:36.020
if we throw the exception,
this method is over, right?

145
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.168
So if we make it past all of this,
then we're good to go in,

146
00:10:40.168 --> 00:10:45.580
the home stretch, and we can go ahead and,
add our return statement.

147
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.894
So we want hours, times, the pay rate

148
00:10:56.678 --> 00:11:01.113
So this was a good example because
we created our own exception,

149
00:11:01.113 --> 00:11:05.550
we threw our own exception,
so that's a nice custom one.

150
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:09.313
We also threw an exception
that already exists,

151
00:11:09.313 --> 00:11:14.840
in Java we throw an unchecked exception
as well as a checked exception.

152
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:19.918
So we see that the checked exception
is the only thing that we have to

153
00:11:19.918 --> 00:11:25.100
declare in the header as throws and
we don't have to do the one here.
