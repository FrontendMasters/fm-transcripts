00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.703
So the next lesson is
on decision structures.

2
00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:09.239
So oftentimes programs, they have to
make some sort of decision, right?

3
00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:16.036
So we need to provide different
paths of execution within our code.

4
00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:22.166
So in this section, we'll look at
various types of decision structures,

5
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:28.514
as well as relational and logical
operators to help us evaluate conditions.

6
00:00:28.514 --> 00:00:33.634
So the first decision structure
we'll look at is the if statement.

7
00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:38.734
The if statement says if a certain
condition occurs, do something and

8
00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:42.804
then go back to the main flow
of the program, all right?

9
00:00:42.804 --> 00:00:44.431
So let's write another program.

10
00:00:44.431 --> 00:00:50.640
This one says that all salespeople
get a payment of $1,000 for the week,

11
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.148
and anyone who exceeds 10 sales gets
an additional bonus of 250, all right?

12
00:00:57.148 --> 00:00:58.903
So let's code this up.

13
00:00:58.903 --> 00:01:04.057
Okay, so within our project part, we're
going to create a new package, right?

14
00:01:04.057 --> 00:01:08.462
Cuz we're talking about a new
subject again, package,

15
00:01:08.462 --> 00:01:12.699
just typically some sort
of logical grouping, okay?

16
00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:15.077
So this one,
we'll call a decision_structure.

17
00:01:15.077 --> 00:01:17.126
Notice I'm starting with a lowercase.

18
00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:19.789
Two words, I'm gonna use a underscore.

19
00:01:23.423 --> 00:01:29.948
And in this decision structure,
let's create a new class.

20
00:01:29.948 --> 00:01:36.262
So we'll call this one SalaryCalculator.

21
00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:40.652
Salary begins with a capital S.

22
00:01:40.652 --> 00:01:42.691
All right, great.

23
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:46.090
First thing we need to create in here,
who remembers?

24
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.602
&gt;&gt; Main.

25
00:01:46.602 --> 00:01:48.156
&gt;&gt; Main method, all right.

26
00:01:48.156 --> 00:01:52.537
Another trick, I can type main tab.

27
00:01:56.449 --> 00:02:00.425
So within my main method,
let's go ahead and

28
00:02:00.425 --> 00:02:04.411
initialize the things
that we already know.

29
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:07.845
So we'll declare and
initialize some variables.

30
00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:13.013
So we can say the salary is 1000,

31
00:02:13.013 --> 00:02:19.033
that was given to us in the prompt, right?

32
00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:24.063
And then the bonus was 200,

33
00:02:24.063 --> 00:02:27.359
also in the prompt.

34
00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:31.972
And then the quota for
bonus was 10, right?

35
00:02:36.766 --> 00:02:42.670
All right, now let's get values for
things that we don't know.

36
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.556
So we'll need to do a little
bit of input and output.

37
00:02:45.556 --> 00:02:49.883
So we'll ask them how many sales,

38
00:02:52.168 --> 00:02:57.480
Did the employee get this week?

39
00:03:02.752 --> 00:03:06.599
And we're gonna wanna read that in,
so we'll use the scanner.

40
00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.774
Now, notice this is a brand new Java file,
so

41
00:03:09.774 --> 00:03:14.220
I needed to redefine this stuff,
you're not using it across.

42
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.409
Got an error for scanner,
what do I need to do?

43
00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:19.250
&gt;&gt; Import.

44
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.551
&gt;&gt; Import, very good, so now I have
my import statement up top here.

45
00:03:26.592 --> 00:03:30.640
And I'm gonna read from the console,
so that System .in.

46
00:03:36.142 --> 00:03:41.718
And we're going to store
the sales in its own variable,

47
00:03:41.718 --> 00:03:46.356
so we'll say int sales = scanner .nextInt.

48
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.915
Okay, and now, so
this was the main flow of the code,

49
00:03:52.915 --> 00:03:56.030
this is applicable to any employee.

50
00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.069
The prompt said if a person got more than
10 sales, then we need to add something.

51
00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.395
So that's where you have to make
a decision within your code, and

52
00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:07.158
we can do so with the if statement.

53
00:04:07.158 --> 00:04:12.225
So you simply write the word if and
a set of parentheses.

54
00:04:12.225 --> 00:04:15.670
Inside of the parentheses is a condition.

55
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.692
This condition must result in true or
false.

56
00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:24.488
So you're gonna write some sort of
expression that's either gonna be true or

57
00:04:24.488 --> 00:04:27.973
false, these are known as Boolean values,
all right?

58
00:04:27.973 --> 00:04:34.924
So if sales is greater than quota.

59
00:04:37.483 --> 00:04:40.606
That will be either true or
that will be false.

60
00:04:40.606 --> 00:04:46.290
If it is true, it'll go inside of
these curly braces after the if and

61
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.091
it'll execute any code that's
written inside of here, all right?

62
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:58.095
So we're saying if the sales
is greater than the quota,

63
00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:03.207
then their salary should
be updated to whatever

64
00:05:03.207 --> 00:05:08.332
their salary already is plus the bonus,
okay?

65
00:05:08.332 --> 00:05:10.049
So that's a quick detour.

66
00:05:10.049 --> 00:05:14.621
And then we go back to the main
flow of the program, which, again,

67
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:18.147
is applicable to anyone who runs this,
all right?

68
00:05:18.147 --> 00:05:21.932
So we can just simply
print out their salary.

69
00:05:27.204 --> 00:05:31.499
We'll append salary there, okay?

70
00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:32.575
Shall we run it?

71
00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:44.768
Okay, so
how many sales did the employee get?

72
00:05:44.768 --> 00:05:47.991
Let's say, and I am big on testing, so

73
00:05:47.991 --> 00:05:52.500
we'll check a couple of
different options with this.

74
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.943
So let's say something lower than 10,
maybe 5.

75
00:05:56.943 --> 00:06:00.288
Salary is 1,000, that's what we expected.

76
00:06:00.288 --> 00:06:07.367
All right, let's run it again, this
time we'll say right at that cap of 10.

77
00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:09.466
Great, they also get 1,000.

78
00:06:09.466 --> 00:06:13.403
And then we'll run it one more time,

79
00:06:13.403 --> 00:06:18.107
this time more than 10, let's say 15.

80
00:06:18.107 --> 00:06:21.093
This time they should get 1,200, right?

81
00:06:21.093 --> 00:06:28.683
1,200, so now we know that this works.
