1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.056
We are going to look at
the program that we've

2
00:00:04.056 --> 00:00:07.596
just written to close the fileReader.

3
00:00:07.596 --> 00:00:12.030
So we open Scanner,
we did not close it, right?

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.960
So remember, we wanna close our streams,
especially when you're dealing with files.

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.314
Because when you open a file
like the program does,

6
00:00:20.314 --> 00:00:25.151
you've all seen this before where you
try to manipulate some file open and

7
00:00:25.151 --> 00:00:28.443
some other application has this locked,
right?

8
00:00:28.443 --> 00:00:32.856
So you got this locked
until you let it go.

9
00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:38.810
So, we want to go and
close the fileReader.

10
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:45.348
Now this part is kind of tricky is like,
where should I close it?

11
00:00:45.348 --> 00:00:48.641
If I were just looking
at this on instinct,

12
00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:53.305
then I would probably want to
close it like after this while,

13
00:00:53.305 --> 00:00:57.433
because now I'm done reading
from the file, right?

14
00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:01.608
So let's say fileReader.close, and

15
00:01:01.608 --> 00:01:07.554
that's fine but
what if there was an exception thrown,

16
00:01:07.554 --> 00:01:15.665
maybe while we were reading from the file
that actually did happen, right?

17
00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:17.185
When we had that string.

18
00:01:17.185 --> 00:01:23.995
So if an exception is thrown here on
line 15 that input mismatch exception,

19
00:01:23.995 --> 00:01:28.920
it's going to go inside of
the input mismatch exception

20
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.295
catch block on line 21,
it never ever executes line 17.

21
00:01:36.142 --> 00:01:38.788
So I wouldn't close it, right?

22
00:01:38.788 --> 00:01:43.062
All right, so I think well,
crap, I don't wanna do that.

23
00:01:43.062 --> 00:01:50.583
What if I moved it inside of here,
or inside of the other exception?

24
00:01:50.583 --> 00:01:55.685
Well, now I can't even access
it cuz I'm outside of the scope,

25
00:01:55.685 --> 00:02:01.939
but even if I were to move scan reader
outside of the try block, let's do that.

26
00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.899
In fact, I'm gonna move this.

27
00:02:09.065 --> 00:02:13.323
I'm gonna just set it to
null to begin with, and

28
00:02:13.323 --> 00:02:17.058
then we'll set it in the try, all right?

29
00:02:17.058 --> 00:02:22.851
So if I move it to here, like if this one
is not thrown then this never gets close,

30
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:26.922
so this doesn't feel like
a good place to put it either.

31
00:02:26.922 --> 00:02:28.905
So it's like, okay, what do I do?

32
00:02:28.905 --> 00:02:34.103
Now, there's another
clause that you can add

33
00:02:34.103 --> 00:02:39.439
to these toe try catch
block is called finally.

34
00:02:41.503 --> 00:02:46.633
And finally just has a set of parentheses,
I mean not parentheses, curly braces,

35
00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:51.693
and you will add any statements that you
want executed after this try catch block,

36
00:02:51.693 --> 00:02:53.250
no matter what happens.

37
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.318
If you stay in the try,
if an exception is caught or whatever,

38
00:02:57.318 --> 00:03:01.154
I don't care,
after you're done with this whole thing,

39
00:03:01.154 --> 00:03:05.876
this finally block will say, well,
go ahead and do these statements.

40
00:03:05.876 --> 00:03:07.828
So this would be a good place to put that.

41
00:03:07.828 --> 00:03:11.173
We could say fileReader.close right here.

42
00:03:11.173 --> 00:03:15.924
So no matter what happens, finally I
want you to close that thing for me.

43
00:03:15.924 --> 00:03:17.611
&gt;&gt; How does the finally and

44
00:03:17.611 --> 00:03:22.595
the curly braces work with regards
to the scope of that try statement?

45
00:03:22.595 --> 00:03:28.866
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if I were to leave this here,
I don't think it would know that.

46
00:03:28.866 --> 00:03:30.159
Yeah, it wouldn't,

47
00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.050
cuz even the catch blocks didn't
know fileReader when it was here.

48
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.038
Remember, when we declare a variable
is only known within the curly braces

49
00:03:39.038 --> 00:03:43.627
that it's defined, so when we defined
it here, you can't use it and

50
00:03:43.627 --> 00:03:47.682
catch and you wouldn't be able
to use it and finally either.

51
00:03:47.682 --> 00:03:54.247
Which is why we needed to move it inside
of the curly braces of the method,

52
00:03:54.247 --> 00:03:59.216
so that you can access it
within these smaller scopes.

53
00:03:59.216 --> 00:04:04.357
So when resources such as input or
output streams are open, and

54
00:04:04.357 --> 00:04:09.595
an exception interrupts the flow
of the program, again, those

55
00:04:09.595 --> 00:04:16.304
resources aren't closed properly unless
you took specific precaution to do so.

56
00:04:16.304 --> 00:04:20.868
So we've already talked about
the finally part, right?

57
00:04:20.868 --> 00:04:24.786
So there's that and
that's perfectly fine, but

58
00:04:24.786 --> 00:04:30.958
there's also a better way that you can
handle this with a little bit less code.

59
00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.082
So that's with try with resources.

60
00:04:34.082 --> 00:04:37.033
Try with resources is gonna allow you to

61
00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:41.694
declare resources that you'll
be used within the try block.

62
00:04:41.694 --> 00:04:46.561
And then Java will automatically
close those resources for

63
00:04:46.561 --> 00:04:49.682
you after the execution of the block.

64
00:04:49.682 --> 00:04:51.419
So that's pretty nice.

65
00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.669
So we're going to update our code, and

66
00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:00.984
we're gonna automatically close
fileReader within the try block itself.

67
00:05:00.984 --> 00:05:06.892
So I'm gonna comment this out just so
you have this as an example, okay?

68
00:05:06.892 --> 00:05:08.845
Is that correct?

69
00:05:08.845 --> 00:05:11.418
&gt;&gt; You still have the exception for E.

70
00:05:12.898 --> 00:05:16.861
&gt;&gt; All right, so,
the way we would do this,

71
00:05:16.861 --> 00:05:22.089
this is the only time that
try has a set of parentheses.

72
00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:24.816
Otherwise, try just has the curly braces.

73
00:05:24.816 --> 00:05:29.229
But then within parentheses you can
declare, like any resources that

74
00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.763
you want automatically closed
at the end of this thing.

75
00:05:32.763 --> 00:05:39.332
So I would actually
define fileReader here.

76
00:05:39.332 --> 00:05:42.686
So I'm gonna take the fileReader.

77
00:05:42.686 --> 00:05:46.644
Man, okay,
I want you to have both of these examples.

78
00:05:46.644 --> 00:05:50.202
I'm just gonna copy this.

79
00:05:50.202 --> 00:05:52.212
Shoo, and I got a main.

80
00:05:52.212 --> 00:05:56.272
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Refactor into a new method,

81
00:05:56.272 --> 00:06:00.322
really good to just refactor
it into a new method.

82
00:06:00.322 --> 00:06:05.869
&gt;&gt; No, I'm gonna make,
I'm gonna copy this class,

83
00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:08.967
I'm gonna copy this class.

84
00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:18.496
All right, let's clone it.

85
00:06:18.496 --> 00:06:24.023
So I'm gonna copy,
we're gonna make a paste,

86
00:06:24.023 --> 00:06:28.729
and we'll call this one AutoClosable.

87
00:06:31.241 --> 00:06:32.183
No, what is it called?

88
00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:34.037
TryWithResources, let's just call it that.

89
00:06:34.037 --> 00:06:36.014
TryWithResources.

90
00:06:41.455 --> 00:06:47.301
Okay, So,

91
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:52.216
we can get rid of finally, yes.

92
00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:58.039
And then, with the try, we will declare

93
00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:03.079
our resource within the parentheses, and

94
00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:09.379
you can go ahead and
actually assign the value, too.

95
00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:18.154
And we'll clean this up, and that's it.

96
00:07:18.154 --> 00:07:22.870
So basically, I just put the declaration
inside of a set of parentheses

97
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.662
next to the try, and that has declared
this as a resource that I would like

98
00:07:27.662 --> 00:07:30.511
closed after we're done with this block.

99
00:07:30.511 --> 00:07:32.905
Now the only types of
resources you can put in here,

100
00:07:32.905 --> 00:07:34.528
you can't put anything you want.

101
00:07:34.528 --> 00:07:41.347
They have to be a subclass of
the AutoClosable class within Java.

102
00:07:41.347 --> 00:07:45.073
Scanner happens to be one of those,
so we're in luck.

103
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:48.991
&gt;&gt; Can you put more than one resource or
just one?

104
00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:50.189
&gt;&gt; You can.

105
00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:55.641
So if you wanted to put another resource,
see, I think I might have an example.

106
00:07:55.641 --> 00:08:00.223
Yeah, I do.

107
00:08:00.223 --> 00:08:01.857
Give me a moment.

108
00:08:01.857 --> 00:08:05.754
All right, so
I wanna combine these exceptions, too, so

109
00:08:05.754 --> 00:08:07.671
you have an example of that.

110
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:11.289
So we'll see, or

111
00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:16.114
let's get rid of that so

112
00:08:16.114 --> 00:08:21.910
nice and clean, all right.

113
00:08:23.725 --> 00:08:26.328
Oops, getMessage.

114
00:08:28.592 --> 00:08:31.398
All right, well, that looks nice.

115
00:08:34.164 --> 00:08:36.103
&gt;&gt; Clean, readable.

116
00:08:36.103 --> 00:08:37.044
&gt;&gt; You see?

117
00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:43.209
All right.
