00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.930
&gt;&gt; Kent: Cool, well let's go ahead and
we'll jump in to this first exercise.

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.730
So if you run, so I would suggest that
you do run the app, MPM, run, start.

3
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.660
So you can pull up exercise one, and you
can just edit the URL, it will be 01, and

4
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.250
it will take you to the exercise page.

5
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.410
If you look at the final version,
you've got handy dandy toggle button, and

6
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.830
that's what you're supposed
to build in the exercise.

7
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.320
So this first one is actually just
building a react component just to

8
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.070
warm up our brains for building stuff.

9
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.640
We warmed up our bodies with air squats,

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.970
we'll probably do that again
this afternoon, by the way.

11
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.730
But gotta warm up your brain,
so there´s no actual patterns

12
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.960
that we´ll being on this first one, but
yeah, you job is just to build this.

13
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.540
So go to the test and

14
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.440
swap out the usage from final,
or the usage from exercise one.

15
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.590
I also failed to mention,

16
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.900
you shouldn't have to change
anything else about the test.

17
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.080
This should be the only
thing you need to change.

18
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.580
And then run the test npm t.

19
00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:11.530
&gt;&gt; Kent: And I'll hit P 01 just to be
sure we're only running that one test.

20
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.660
And then open up the exercises.

21
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.170
And something that I failed to mention,

22
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.230
I should have, is this is Cody,
say hi to Cody.

23
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.730
Hi Cody.

24
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.550
Cody the koala bear, and

25
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.250
he is going to tell you when you
actually need to do something.

26
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.990
So sometimes there will be just
commentary in the comments.

27
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.940
I guess that's what comments are,
or commentary, right.

28
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.170
But at several points in
the comments there like, okay,

29
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.530
now you need to do this thing.

30
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.220
So Cody will be there when you
need to do something specific.

31
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.633
There's also Marty, the money bag, and

32
00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:58.950
Marty will be there to give you tips,
so when you see Marty.

33
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.306
There's also, I didn't give
this a name but the 100 symbol,

34
00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:03.780
what should that be called?

35
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.009
I don't know,
think of something to me later.

36
00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.526
But that will be when there's a bonus
thing that you could implement.

37
00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:17.830
&gt;&gt; Kent: Okay, so yeah,
that's pretty much it for this.

38
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.160
I'm going to give you about five minutes,
well, we'll do ten minutes for

39
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.640
this first exercise.

40
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.420
And then I'll come in and
we'll do this solution and move on.

41
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.487
Anybody have any questions?

42
00:02:30.503 --> 00:02:32.010
&gt;&gt; Kent: All right, fire away.

43
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.440
Yes?
I did have one question on mine,

44
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.030
it says how do we?

45
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.040
Yeah, somebody's asking me about running
testing code sandbox, good question.

46
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.180
So I'll pop open the code sandbox,
should have demoed this earlier.

47
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.875
So at the bottom here
there's this test tab,

48
00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:53.620
you pop that open and they're actually
running for you automatically.

49
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.890
So as you make changes, you can also click
on a specific file to rerun those tests.

50
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.490
You can toggle file watching,

51
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.680
but I don't know why you wouldn't
wanna just keep it going all the time.

52
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.970
So yeah, it's pretty cool, right?

53
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.760
Code sandbox is the coolest thing ever.

54
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.340
So, yeah, that's how you do it.

55
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.410
It will show you errors right here.
